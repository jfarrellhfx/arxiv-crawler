<h3>Hydrodynamic Stability Criterion for Colloidal Gelation under Gravity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13908" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13908</a>

Attractive colloids diffuse and aggregate to form gels, solid-like particle
networks suspended in a fluid. Gravity is known to strongly impact the
stability of gels once they are formed. However, its effect on the process of
gel formation has seldom been studied. Here, we simulate the effect of gravity
on gelation using both Brownian dynamics and a lattice-Boltzmann algorithm that
accounts for hydrodynamic interactions. We work in a confined geometry to
capture macroscopic, buoyancy-induced flows driven by the density mismatch
between fluid and colloids. These flows give rise to a stability criterion for
network formation, based on an effective accelerated sedimentation of nascent
clusters at low volume fractions that disrupts gelation. Above a critical
volume fraction, mechanical strength in the forming gel network dominates the
dynamics: the interface between the colloid-rich and colloid-poor region moves
downward at an ever decreasing rate. Finally, we analyze the asymptotic state,
the colloidal gel-like sediment, which we find not to be appreciably impacted
by the vigorous flows that can occur during the settling of the colloids. Our
findings represent the first steps toward understanding how flow during
formation affects the life span of colloidal gels.

When a free Fermi gas on a lattice is subject to the action of a linear
potential it does not drift away, as one would naively expect, but it remains
spatially localized. Here we revisit this phenomenon, known as Stark
localization, within the recently proposed framework of generalized
hydrodynamics. In particular, we consider the dynamics of an initial state in
the form of a domain wall and we recover known results for the particle density
and the particle current, while we derive analytical predictions for relevant
observables such as the entanglement entropy and the full counting statistics.
Then, we extend the analysis to generic potentials, highlighting the
relationship between the occurrence of localization and the presence of
peculiar closed orbits in phase space, arising from the lattice dispersion
relation. We also compare our analytical predictions with numerical
calculations and with the available results, finding perfect agreement. This
approach paves the way for an exact treatment of the interacting case known as
Stark many-body localization.

<h3>Average entanglement entropy of midspectrum eigenstates of  quantum-chaotic interacting Hamiltonians</h3>

To which degree the average entanglement entropy of midspectrum eigenstates
of quantum-chaotic interacting Hamiltonians agrees with that of random pure
states is a question that has attracted considerable attention in the recent
years. While there is substantial evidence that the leading (volume-law) terms
are identical, which and how subleading terms differ between them is less
clear. Here we carry out state of the art full exact diagonalization
calculations of clean spin-1/2 XYZ and XXZ chains with integrability breaking
terms to address this question in the absence and presence of $U(1)$ symmetry,
respectively. We first introduce the notion of maximally chaotic regime, for
the chain sizes amenable to full exact diagonalization calculations, as the
regime in Hamiltonian parameters in which the level spacing ratio, the
distribution of eigenstate coefficients, and the entanglement entropy are
closest to the random matrix theory predictions. In this regime, we carry out a
finite-size scaling analysis of the subleading terms of the average
entanglement entropy of midspectrum eigenstates. We find indications that, in
the middle of the spectrum, the magnitude of the negative $O(1)$ terms is only
slightly greater than the one predicted for random pure states.

<h3>Magnetism and Metallicity in Moiré Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</h3>

The ability to control the properties of twisted bilayer transition metal
dichalcogenides in situ makes them an ideal platform for investigating the
interplay of strong correlations and geometric frustration. Of particular
interest are the low energy scales, which make it possible to experimentally
access both temperature and magnetic fields that are of the order of the
bandwidth or the correlation scale. In this manuscript we analyze the moir\'e
Hubbard model, believed to describe the low energy physics of an important
subclass of the twisted bilayer compounds. We establish its magnetic and the
metal-insulator phase diagram for the full range of magnetic fields up to the
fully spin polarized state. We find a rich phase diagram including fully and
partially polarized insulating and metallic phases of which we determine the
interplay of magnetic order, Zeeman-field, and metallicity, and make connection
to recent experiments.

<h3>Electron-phonon coupling and competing Kekulé orders in twisted  bilayer graphene</h3>

Recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiments [K.P. Nuckolls et al.,
arXiv:2303.00024] have revealed the ubiquity of Kekul\'e charge-density wave
order in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Most samples are moderately
strained and show `incommensurate Kekul\'e spiral' (IKS) order involving a
graphene-scale charge density distortion uniaxially modulated on the scale of
the moir\'e superlattice, in accord with theoretical predictions. However,
ultra-low strain samples instead show graphene-scale Kekul\'e charge order that
is uniform on the moir\'e scale. This order, especially prominent near filling
factor $\nu=-2$, is unanticipated by theory which predicts a time-reversal
breaking Kekul\'e current order at low strain. We show that including the
coupling of moir\'e electrons to graphene-scale optical zone-corner (ZC)
phonons stabilizes a uniform Kekul\'e charge ordered state at $|\nu|=2$ with a
quantized topological (spin or anomalous Hall) response. Our work clarifies how
this phonon-driven selection of electronic order emerges in the strong-coupling
regime of moir\'e graphene.

<h3>Massive damage generation accompanying pyramidal slip in hexagonal-close  packed magnesium: an origin for its high hardening and brittleness</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13605" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13605</a>

Mg represents a group of technically important hexagonal-close packed (hcp)
metals whose mechanical behaviors are very different from body-centered cubic
(bcc) and face-centered cubic (fcc) metals and the underlying mechanisms remain
poorly-understood. It has been long known that Mg has high hardening and low
ductility, and this was conventionally attributed to the scarce of active
pyramidal slip. Recently immobilization of pyramidal dislocations was proposed
to be the origins. Here we present a different scenario that has hitherto never
been reported for Mg: mobile screw pyramidal dislocations double cross-slip and
continue to double cross-slip as they glide, generating abundant vacancy
clusters on the slipped planes. These vacancy clusters hinder subsequent
dislocation motion and thus directly result in hardening; their accumulation as
plastic deformation proceeds eventually causes premature fracture, i.e.
brittleness. The massive damage accompanying pyramidal slip discovered here
provides a different explanation for the long known hardening and brittleness
of Mg, and suggests that sufficient amount of pyramidal dislocations could
still be insufficient to effectively accommodate plasticity. Stabilizing
pyramidal dislocation motion to avoid cross-slip and subsequent damage
generation is also essential for property-improvement. The instability of
pyramidal slip, manifested as continuous cross-slip here (could be different
elsewhere), originates from its huge Burgers vector and could be a common
feature of its kind. The detailed cross-slip mechanism also provides insights
into the poorly known instabilities and complicated behavior of dislocations in
a broader range of crystals with low symmetry and/or large Burgers vectors,
including other hcp metals and ceramics.

<h3>Reduced absorption due to defect-localized interlayer excitons in  transition metal dichalcogenide-graphene heterostructures</h3>

Associating the presence of atomic vacancies to excited-state transport
phenomena in two dimensional semiconductors is of emerging interest, and
demands detailed understanding of the involved exciton transitions. Here we
study the effect of such defects on the electronic and optical properties of
WS$_2$-graphene and MoS$_2$-graphene van der Waals heterobilayers by employing
many-body perturbation theory. We find that the combination of chalcogen
defects and graphene adsorption onto the transition metal dichalcogenide layer
can radically alter the optical properties of the heterobilayer, due to a
combination of dielectric screening, the impact of the missing chalcogen atoms
in the intralayer and interlayer optical transitions, and the different nature
of each layer. By analyzing the intrinsic radiative rates of the most stable
subgap excitonic features, we find that while the presence of defects
introduces low-lying optical transitions, resulting in excitons with larger
oscillator strength, it also decreases the optical response associated to the
pristine-like transition-metal dichalcogenide intralayer excitons. Our findings
relate excitonic features with interface design for defect engineering in
photovoltaic and transport applications.

<h3>Interface and electromagnetic effects in the valley splitting of Si  quantum dots</h3>

<br>
<br>
The performance and scalability of silicon spin qubits depend directly on the
value of the conduction band valley splitting. In this work, we investigate the
influence of electromagnetic fields and the interface width on the valley
splitting of a quantum dot in a Si/SiGe heterostructure. We propose a new
three-dimensional theoretical model within the effective mass theory for the
calculation of the valley splitting in such heterostructures that takes into
account the concentration fluctuation at the interfaces and the lateral
confinement. With this model, we predict that the electric field is an
important parameter for valley splitting engineering, since it can shift the
probability distribution away from small valley splittings for some interface
widths. We also obtain a critical softness of the interfaces in the
heterostructure, above which the best option for spin qubits is to consider an
interface as wide as possible.

<h3>Optimising nanoporous supercapacitors for heat-to-electricity conversion</h3>

Innovative ways of harnessing sustainable energy are needed to meet the
world's ever-increasing energy demands. Supercapacitors may contribute, as they
can convert waste heat to electricity through cyclic charging and discharging
at different temperatures. Herein, we use an analytically-solvable model of a
cylindrical pore filled with a single file of ions to identify optimal
conditions for heat-to-electricity conversion with supercapacitors. We consider
Stirling and Ericsson-like charging cycles and show that the former or latter
yields more work when a supercapacitor operates under charge or voltage
limitations, respectively. Both cycles yield the most work for pores almost as
narrow as the size of the ions they contain, as is the case for energy storage
with supercapacitors. In contrast to energy storage, which can be maximised by
ionophobic pores, such pores do not yield the best heat-to-electricity
conversion, independently of the applied potential. Instead, we find that for a
given pore size, a moderately ionophilic pore harvests more work than
ionophobic and strongly ionophilic pores.

<h3>Two-fold symmetric superconductivity in the kagome superconductor  RbV3Sb5</h3>

<br>
<br>
The recent discovered kagome superconductors provide a good platform for
studying intertwined orders and novel states such as topology, superconductor,
charge density wave, et al. The interplay of these orders may spontaneously
break the rotational symmetry, and induce exotic phenomena such as nematicity,
or even nematic superconductor. Here we report a two-fold rotational symmetric
superconductivity of thin-film RbV3Sb5 in response to a direction-dependent
in-plane magnetic fields, in contrast to the six-fold structural symmetry of
the crystal lattice. The two-fold symmetry was evidenced by the
magnetoresistance transport experiments, critical magnetic field measurements
and the anisotropic superconducting gap. With different configuration, we
further observed the six-fold symmetry superimposed on the two-fold symmetry
near the boundary between normal states and superconducting states. Our results
present the correlation-driven symmetry breaking and highlight the promising
platform to study the intertwined orders such as unconventional
superconductivity in this correlated kagome family.

<h3>Enhancement of Charge Density Wave Correlations in a Holstein Model with  an Anharmonic Phonon Potential</h3>

<br>
<i>C. Kvande, C. Feng, F. Hébert, G. G. Batrouni, R. T. Scalettar</i>
<br>
<br>
The Holstein Hamiltonian describes itinerant electrons whose site density
couples to local phonon degrees of freedom. In the single site limit, at
half-filling, the electron-phonon coupling results in a double well structure
for the lattice displacement, favoring empty or doubly occupied sites. In two
dimensions, and on a bipartite lattice in $d \geq 2$, an intersite hopping
causes these doubly occupied and empty sites to alternate in a charge density
wave (CDW) pattern when the temperature is lowered. Because a discrete symmetry
is broken, this occurs in a conventional second-order transition at finite
$T_{\rm cdw}$. In this paper, we investigate the effect of changing the phonon
potential energy to one with an intrinsic double well structure even in the
absence of an electron-phonon coupling. While this aids in the initial process
of pair formation, the implications for subsequent CDW order are non-trivial.
One expects that, when the electron-phonon coupling is too strong, the double
wells become deep and the polaron mass large, an effect which reduces $T_{\rm
cdw}$. We show here the existence of regions of parameter space where the
double well potential, while aiding local pair formation, does so in a way
which also substantially enhances long range CDW order.

<h3>Transport and localization properties of excitations in one-dimensional  lattices with diagonal disordered mosaic modulations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13736" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13736</a>
<br>
<i>Ba Phi Nguyen, Kihong Kim</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a numerical study of the transport and localization properties of
excitations in one-dimensional lattices with diagonal disordered mosaic
modulations. The model is characterized by the modulation period $\kappa$ and
the disorder strength $W$. We calculate the disorder averages $\langle
T\rangle$, $\langle \ln T\rangle$, and $\langle P\rangle$, where $T$ is the
transmittance and $P$ is the participation ratio, as a function of energy $E$
and system size $L$, for different values of $\kappa$ and $W$. For excitations
at quasiresonance energies determined by $\kappa$, we find power-law scaling
behaviors of the form $\langle T \rangle \propto L^{-\gamma_{a}}$, $\langle \ln
T \rangle \approx -\gamma_g \ln L$, and $\langle P \rangle \propto L^{\beta}$,
as $L$ increases to a large value. This behavior is in contrast to the
exponential localization behavior occurring at all other energies. The
appearance of sharp peaks in the participation ratio spectrum at quasiresonance
energies provides additional evidence for the existence of an anomalous
power-law localization phenomenon. The corresponding eigenstates demonstrate
multifractal behavior and exhibit unique node structures. In addition, we
investigate the time-dependent wave packet dynamics and calculate the mean
square displacement $\langle m^2(t) \rangle$, spatial probability distribution,
participation number, and return probability. When the wave packet's initial
momentum satisfies the quasiresonance condition, we observe a subdiffusive
spreading of the wave packet, characterized by $\langle m^2(t) \rangle\propto
t^{\eta}$ where $\eta$ is always less than 1. We also note the occurrence of
partial localization at quasiresonance energies, as indicated by the saturation
of the participation number and a nonzero value for the return probability at
long times.

<h3>Propagation of Dirac waves through various temporal interfaces, slabs,  and crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13741" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13741</a>
<br>
<i>Seulong Kim, Kihong Kim</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the influence of the temporal variations of various medium
parameters on the propagation of Dirac-type waves in materials where the
quasiparticles are described by a generalized version of the pseudospin-1/2
Dirac equation. Our considerations also include the propagation of
electromagnetic waves in metamaterials with the Dirac-type dispersion. We focus
on the variations of the scalar and vector potentials, mass, Fermi velocity,
and tilt velocity describing the Dirac cone tilt. We derive the scattering
coefficients associated with the temporal interfaces and slabs analytically and
find that the temporal scattering is caused by the changes of the mass, Fermi
velocity, and vector potential, but does not arise from the changes of the
scalar potential and tilt velocity. We also explore the conditions under which
the temporal Brewster effect and total reflection occur and calculate the
change in total wave energy. We examine bilayer Dirac temporal crystals where
parameters switch between two different sets of values periodically and prove
that these systems do not have momentum gaps. Finally, we assess the potential
for observing these temporal scattering effects in experiments.

<h3>Bayesian Optimization of Metastable Nickel Formation During the  Spontaneous Crystallization under Extreme Conditions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13754" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13754</a>

<br>
<br>
Spontaneous crystallization of metals under extreme conditions is a unique
phenomenon occurring under far-from-equilibrium conditions that could enable
the development of revolutionary and disruptive metastable metals with unusual
properties. In this work, the formation of the hexagonal close-packed Nickel
(hcp-Ni) metastable phase during spontaneous crystallization is studied using
non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with the goal of
maximizing the fraction of this metastable phase in the final state. We employ
Bayesian Optimization (BO) with the Gaussian Processes (GP) regression as the
surrogate model to maximize the hcp-Ni phase fraction, where temperature and
pressure are control variables. MD simulations provide data for training the GP
model, which is then used with BO to predict the next simulation condition.
Such a BO-guided active learning leads to a maximum hcp-Ni fraction of 43.38%
in the final crystalized phase within 40 iterations when a face-centered cubic
(fcc) crystallite serves as the seed for crystallization from the amorphous
phase. When an hcp seed is used, the maximum hcp-Ni fraction in the final
crystal increases to 58.25% with 13 iterations. This study shows the promise of
using BO to identify the process conditions that can maximize the rare phases.
This method can also be generally applicable to process optimization to achieve
target material properties.

<h3>Symmetry manipulation of nonlinear optical effect for metallic TMDC</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13768" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13768</a>

<i>Ren Habara, Katsunori Wakabayashi</i>
<br>
<br>
Nonlinear optical (NLO) effect plays a crucial role to engineer optical
angular frequency and symmetry of electronic system. Metallic transition-metal
dichalcogenide (TMDC) is one of two-dimensional (2D) materials, which has no
inversion symmetry for odd-number-layer. In particular, odd-number-layered
NbSe$_2$ has spin splitting owing to Ising-type spin-orbit coupling. In this
paper, we numerically calculate the NLO charge and spin conductivities of
NbSe$_2$ based on an effective tight-binding model for several different
optical effects, i.e., symmetry manipulation by bi-circular light (BCL) and
bulk photovoltaic effect (shift and injection current). Under irradiation of
BCL which can control the symmetry of electronic system, the current can be
generated even in even-number-layered NbSe$_2$. Also, we find that shift
current can be generated for odd-number-layered NbSe$_2$, which is robust
against electronic scattering, i.e., topological current. The direction of
generated shift current can be switched by altering polarization of light. Our
results will serve to design opt-spintronics devices based on 2D materials to
manipulate the charge and spin current and their directions by controlling the
polarization of incident light which recasts the symmetry of electronic system.

Alloys with a first-order magnetic transition are central to solid-state
refrigeration technology, sensors and actuators, or spintronic devices. The
discontinuous nature of the transition in these materials is a consequence of
the coupling between the magnetic, electronic and structural subsystems, but in
a real experiment, it is difficult to observe and analyze the simultaneous
evolution of all the subsystems. As a result, it is very hard to determine the
main mechanisms of the transition and purposefully develop these advanced
magnetic materials. To resolve this issue, we changed the existing paradigm and
conducted simultaneous measurements of the macroscopic properties -
magnetization, temperature change of the sample, longitudinal and transversal
magnetostrictions - to reveal the rich details of the magneto-structural,
first-order transition occurring in the prototypical alloy LaFe11.8Si1.2. We
complement these findings with experiments on the atomistic scale, i.e., x-ray
absorption spectroscopy (XAS), x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and
M\"ossbauer spectroscopy, and then combine them with first-principles
calculations to reveal the full complexity and two-stage nature of the
transition. This new approach can be successfully extended to a large class of
advanced magnetic materials that exhibit analogous transformations.

<h3>Modelling of FG-TPMS plates</h3>

Functionally graded porous plates have been validated as remarkable
lightweight structures with excellent mechanical characteristics and numerous
applications. With inspiration from the high strength-to-volume ratio of triply
periodic minimal surface (TPMS) structures, a new model of porous plates, which
is called a functionally graded TPMS (FG-TPMS) plate, is investigated in this
paper. Three TPMS architectures including Primitive (P), Gyroid (G), and
wrapped package-graph (IWP) with different graded functions are presented. To
predict the mechanical responses, a new fitting technique based on a two-phase
piece-wise function is employed to evaluate the effective moduli of TPMS
structures, including elastic modulus, shear modulus, and bulk modulus. In
addition, this function corresponds to the cellular structure formulation in
the context of relative density. The separated phases of the function are
divided by the different deformation behaviors. Furthermore, another crucial
mechanical property of porous structure, i.e, Poisson's ratio, is also achieved
by a similar fitting technique. To verify the mechanical characteristics of the
FG-TPMS plate, the generalized displacement field is modeled by a seventh-order
shear deformation theory (SeSDT) and isogeometric analysis (IGA). Numerical
examples regarding static, buckling, and free vibration analyses of FG-TPMS
plates are illustrated to confirm the reliability and accuracy of the proposed
approach. Consequently, these FG-TPMS structures can provide much higher
stiffness than the same-weight isotropic plate. The greater stiffness-to-weight
ratio of these porous plates compared to the full-weight isotropic ones should
be considered the most remarkable feature. Thus, these complex porous
structures have numerous practical applications because of these high ratios
and their fabrication ability through additive manufacturing (AM) technology.

Hydrogel-based soft actuators can operate in sensitive environments, bridging
the gap of rigid machines interacting with soft matter. However, while
stimuli-responsive hydrogels can undergo extreme reversible volume changes of
up to ~90%, water transport in hydrogel actuators is in general limited by
their poroelastic behavior. For poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) the
actuation performance is even further compromised by the formation of a dense
skin layer. Here we show, that incorporating a bioinspired microtube graphene
network into a PNIPAM matrix with a total porosity of only 5.4 % dramatically
enhances actuation dynamics by up to ~400 % and actuation stress by ~4000 %
without sacrificing the mechanical stability, overcoming the water transport
limitations. The graphene network provides both untethered light-controlled and
electrically-powered actuation. We anticipate that the concept provides a
versatile platform for enhancing the functionality of soft matter by combining
responsive and two-dimensional materials, paving the way towards designing soft
intelligent matter.

Polar bubble domains are complex topological defects akin to magnetic
skyrmions that can spontaneously form in ferroelectric thin films and
superlattices. They can be deterministically written and deleted and exhibit a
set of properties, such as sub-10 nm radius and room-temperature stability,
that are highly attractive for dense data storage and reconfigurable
nano-electronics technologies. However, possibilities of controlled motion of
electric bubble skyrmions, a critical technology requirement currently remains
missing. Here we present atomistic simulations that demonstrate how external
electric-field perturbations can induce two types of motion of bubble skyrmions
in low-dimensional tetragonal PbZr$_{0.4}$Ti$_{0.6}$O$_3$ systems under
residual depolarizing field. Specifically, we show that, depending on the
spatial profile and magnitude of the external field, bubble skyrmions can
exhibit either a continuous motion driven by the external electric field
gradient or a discontinuous, teleportation-like, skyrmion domain transfer.
These findings provide the first analysis of dynamics and controlled motion of
polar skyrmions that are essential for functionalization of these particle-like
domain structures.

<br>
Electrical conductivity with gate-sweep in a few layer MoS$_2$-on-SiO$_2$
field-effect-transistor shows an abrupt reduction in hysteresis when cooled.
The hysteresis and time dependent conductivity of the MoS$_2$ channel are
modeled using the dynamics of interface traps' occupancy. The reduction in
hysteresis is found to be steepest at a blocking temperature near 225 K. This
is attributed to the interplay between thermal and barrier energies and fitted
using a distribution of the latter. Further, the charge stored in the blocked
traps is programmed at low temperatures by cooling under suitable gate voltage.
Thus the threshold gate-voltage in nearly non-hysteretic devices at 80 K
temperature is reversibly controlled over a wide range.

<br>
<br>
Harnessing the optoelectronic response of organic semiconductors requires a
thorough understanding of the fundamental light-matter interaction that is
dominated by the excitation of correlated electron-hole pairs, i.e. excitons.
The nature of these excitons would be fully captured by knowing the
quantum-mechanical wavefunction, which, however, is difficult to access both
theoretically and experimentally. Here, we use femtosecond photoemission
orbital tomography in combination with many-body perturbation theory to gain
access to exciton wavefunctions in organic semiconductors. We find that the
coherent sum of multiple electron-hole pair contributions that typically make
up a single exciton can be experimentally evidenced by photoelectron
spectroscopy. For the prototypical organic semiconductor buckminsterfullerene
(C$_{60}$), we show how to disentangle such multiorbital contributions and
thereby access key properties of the exciton wavefunctions including
localization, charge-transfer character, and ultrafast exciton formation and
relaxation dynamics.

<br>
<br>
We investigate the connection between the local electron correlation and the
momentum dependence of the spin susceptibility and the superconducting gap
functions in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, using density-functional theory combined with
dynamical mean-field theory. Adopting frequency-dependent twoparticle vertex
moves the zero energy spin susceptibility peaks towards the Brillouin zone
center, compared with random-phase approximation which basically retains the
peak positions closer to the Brillouin zone boundary as determined by the
Fermi-surface nesting. We find that dxy orbital plays a central role here via
its enhanced correlation strength. Solving the linearized Eliashberg equation
from this spin susceptibility, prime candidates of the superconducting gap
symmetry are a s-wave, along with a nearly degenerate d-wave solution, all in
spin singlet. Furthermore, another set of degenerate spin singlet gap functions
emerges, odd with respect to k-point as well as orbital exchanges. We show that
the stability of these gap functions are strongly dependent on the peak
position of the spin susceptibility in the Brillouin zone.

<h3>Triplet supercurrents in lateral Josephson junctions with a  half-metallic ferromagnet</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Spin triplet supercurrents in half-metallic ferromagnets (HMFs) would be a
valuable addition to the toolbox of superconducting spintronics since they
promise to be long-range, fully spin-polarized, and with high current density.
However, experimental studies on the subject remain scarce because there are
only few HMFs available. Here we report on the generation of triplet
supercurrents in mesoscopic lateral Josephson junctions, fabricated with the
conventional superconductor NbTi and the HMF La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$
(LSMO), having a typical junction length of 20~nm. We use the electrode
geometry as a tool to examine the triplet generator in the HMF and study
junctions shaped as bar, square, and disk. In all junctions, we find strong
supercurrents and high current densities, that are independent of the junction
geometry and are insensitive to the application of in-plane fields, ruling out
the magnetic vorticity in the disk geometry as the generator. Analysis of the
critical current interference pattern upon application of a perpendicular
magnetic field shows that the triplet supercurrent is highly constricted to the
rims of the disk devices, yet uniformly distributed in the bar-shaped devices.
The appearance of these rim supercurrents is tied to the combination of triplet
transport and the disk geometry but is not central to the generator mechanism.
Next, we analyze the temperature dependence of the critical current and find in
its quadratic dependence a strong indication for the triplet nature of the
supercurrents. Finally, we find the supercurrent to persist in junctions
fabricated from a NbTi/Ag/LSMO trilayer. The results strongly indicate that the
magnetic inhomogeneity needed for triplet generation resides in the LSMO layer
adjacent to the NbTi/LSMO interface.

<h3>Non-local superconducting single-photon detector</h3>

<i>Federico Paolucci</i>
<br>
<br>
We present and theoretically analyse the performance of an innovative
non-local superconducting single-photon detector. The device operates thanks to
the energy-to-phase conversion mechanism, where the energy of the absorbed
single-photon is transformed in a variation of the superconducting phase. To
this scope, the detector is designed in the form of a double-loop
superconductor/normal metal/superconductors (SNS) Josephson interferometer,
where the detection occurs in a long SNS junction and the read-out is operated
by a short SNS junction. The variation of the superconducting phase across the
read-out junction is measured by recording the quasiparticle current flowing
through a tunnel coupled superconducting probe. By exploiting realistic
geometry and materials, the detector is able to reveal single-photons of
frequency down to 10 GHz when operated at 10 mK. Furthermore, the device
provides value of signal-to-noise ratio up 10^4 in the range 10 GHz-10 THz by
selecting the magnetic flux and the bias voltage. This device can find direct
applications as single-photon detector in both basic science and quantum
technology, while the energy-to-phase conversion mechanism can be at the basis
of non-local read-out and memory architectures for superconducting qubits.

<br>
<br>
Molecules present a versatile platform for quantum information science, and
are candidates for sensing and computation applications. Robust spin-optical
interfaces are key to harnessing the quantum resources of materials. To date,
carbon-based candidates have been non-luminescent, which prevents optical
read-out. Here we report the first organic molecules displaying both efficient
luminescence and near-unity generation yield of high-spin multiplicity excited
states. This is achieved by designing an energy resonance between emissive
doublet and triplet levels, here on covalently coupled
tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl) methyl-carbazole radicals (TTM-1Cz) and anthracene.
We observe the doublet photoexcitation delocalise onto the linked acene within
a few picoseconds and subsequently evolve to a pure high spin state (quartet
for monoradicals, quintet for biradical) of mixed radical-triplet character
near 1.8 eV. These high-spin states are coherently addressable with microwaves
even at 295 K, with optical read-out enabled by intersystem crossing to
emissive states. Furthermore, for the biradical, on return to the ground state
the previously uncorrelated radical spins either side of the anthracene show
strong spin correlation. Our approach simultaneously supports a high efficiency
of initialisation, spin manipulations and light-based read-out at room
temperature. The integration of luminescence and high-spin states creates an
organic materials platform for emerging quantum technologies.

Due to presence of magnetic field gradient needed for coherent spin control,
dephasing of single-electron spin qubits in silicon quantum dots is often
dominated by $1/f$ charge noise. We investigate theoretically fluctuations of
ground state energy of an electron in gated quantum dot in realistic Si/SiGe
structure. We assume that the charge noise is caused by motion of charges
trapped at the semiconductor-oxide interface. We consider a realistic range of
trapped charge densities, $\rho \! \sim \! 10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, and typical
lenghtscales of isotropically distributed displacements of these charges,
$\delta r \! \leq \! 1$ nm, and identify pairs $(\rho,\delta r)$ for which the
amplitude and shape of the noise spectrum is in good agreement with spectra
reconstructed in recent experiments on similar structures.

<h3>Designing nontrivial one-dimensional Floquet topological phases using a  spin-1/2 double-kicked rotor</h3>

<br>
<i>Yusuke Koyama, Kazuya Fujimoto, Shuta Nakajima, Yuki Kawaguchi</i>
<br>
<br>
A quantum kicked rotor model is one of the promising systems to realize
various Floquet topological phases. We consider a double-kicked rotor model for
a one-dimensional quasi-spin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensate with spin-dependent
and spin-independent kicks which are implementable for cold atomic experiments.
We theoretically show that the model can realize all the Altland-Zirnbauer
classes with nontrivial topology in one dimension. In the case of class CII, we
show that a pair of winding numbers $(w_0,w_\pi)\in 2\mathbb{Z}\times
2\mathbb{Z}$ featuring the edge states at zero and $\pi$ quasienergy,
respectively, takes various values depending on the strengths of the kicks. We
also find that the winding numbers change to $\mathbb{Z}$ when we break the
time-reversal and particle-hole symmetries by changing the phase of a kicking
lattice. We numerically confirm that the winding numbers can be obtained by
measuring the mean chiral displacement in the long time limit in the present
case with four internal degrees of freedom. We further propose two feasible
methods to experimentally realize the spin-dependent and spin-independent kicks
required for various topological phases.

We present a detailed study of the electronic and magnetic ground state
properties of Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$Si using a combination of macroscopic and
microscopic experimental techniques. From these experiments we quantitatively
characterize the metal-insulator transition and magnetic/non-magnetic quantum
phase transition occurring at low doping levels in Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$Si. From
our study, we find a surprising closeness of the critical composition of the
metal-insulator transition at $x_{\mathrm{MIT}} = 0.014$ and the quantum phase
transition at $x_{\mathrm{LRO}} \sim 0.024-0.031$. It suggests that these
effects are cooperative and depend on each other.

<h3>Data-driven estimation of transfer integrals in undoped cuprates</h3>

<br>
<br>
Undoped cuprates are an abundant class of magnetic insulators, in which the
synergy of rich chemistry and sizable quantum fluctuations leads to a variety
of magnetic behaviors. Understanding the magnetism of these materials is
impossible without the knowledge of the underlying spin model. The typically
dominant antiferromagnetic superexchanges can be accurately estimated from the
respective electronic transfer integrals. Density functional theory
calculations mapped onto an effective one-orbital model in the Wannier basis
are an accurate, albeit computationally cumbersome method to estimate such
transfer integrals in cuprates. We demonstrate that instead a Gaussian Process
Regression (GPR) model, trained on the results of high-throughput calculations,
can predict the transfer integrals using the crystal structure as the only
input. Descriptors of our GPR model encode the spatial configuration and the
chemical composition of the local crystalline environment. A virtual toolbox
employing our model can be readily employed to determine leading superexchange
paths as well as for rapidly assessing the relevant spin model in yet unknown
cuprates.

The report on the near-ambient superconductivity in an nitrogen-doped
lutetium hydride has stimulated great interest in this material
(Dasenbrock-Gammon et al. 2023). While its superconductivity is still a subject
of debate, the structure of the claimed cubic phase remains uncertain. In this
work, we study the effect of nitrogen doping and pressure on the energetic and
dynamic stability of cubic LuH$_3$. Our findings indicate that both pressure
and nitrogen doping can enhance the stability of the cubic LuH$_3$ phase. We
propose a Lu$_8$H$_{21}$N structure that exhibits stable phonon, reasonable
thermodynamics stability at 1 GPa, and a similar XRD pattern to the
experimental data. However, we do not observe electron-phonon coupling in the
zone-center phonon modes of these crystal structures.

available in DSribe. For the many-body tensor representation (MBTR) and the
Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), we have also implemented analytic
derivatives. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the descriptor derivatives for
machine learning models of Cu clusters and perovskite alloys.

<h3>Revealing contributions to conduction from transport within ordered and  disordered regions in highly doped conjugated polymers through analysis of  temperature-dependent Hall measurements</h3>

<br>
<br>
Hall effect measurements in doped polymer semiconductors are widely reported,
but are difficult to interpret due to screening of Hall voltages by carriers
undergoing incoherent transport. Here, we propose a refined analysis for such
Hall measurements, based on measuring the Hall coefficient as a function of
temperature, and modelling carriers as existing in a regime of variable
"deflectability" (i.e. how strongly they "feel" the magnetic part of the
Lorentz force). By linearly interpolating each carrier between the extremes of
no deflection and full deflection, we demonstrate that it is possible to
extract the (time-averaged) concentration of deflectable charge carriers,
$\left<n_d\right>$, the average, temperature-dependent mobility of those
carriers, $\left<\mu_d\right>(T)$, as well as the ratio of conductivity that
comes from such deflectable transport, $d(T)$. Our method was enabled by the
construction of an improved AC Hall measurement system, as well as an improved
data extraction method. We measured Hall bar devices of ion-exchange doped
films of PBTTT-C$_{14}$ from 10--300 K. Our analysis provides evidence for the
proportion of conductivity arising from deflectable transport, $d(T)$,
increasing with doping level, ranging between 15.4% and 16.4% at room
temperature. When compared to total charge-carrier-density estimates from
independent methods, the values of $\left<n_d\right>$ extracted suggest that
carriers spend $\sim$37% of their time of flight being deflectable in the most
highly doped of the devices measured here. The extracted values of $d(T)$ being
less than half this value thus suggest that the limiting factor for
conductivity in such highly doped devices is carrier mobility, rather than
concentration.

We review the basic concepts and tools for mechanically unzipping RNA
hairpins using force spectroscopy. By pulling apart the ends of an RNA molecule
using optical tweezers, it is possible to measure the folding free energy at
varying experimental conditions. Energy measurements permit us to characterize
the thermodynamics of RNA hybridization (base pairing and stacking), the
dynamics of the formation of native and kinetic (intermediates and misfolded)
molecular states, and interactions with metallic ions. This paper introduces
basic concepts and reviews recent developments related to RNA force

dynamics. We emphasize the implications of mechanical unzipping experiments to

We utilize neural-network quantum states (NQSs) to investigate the
ground-state properties of the Heisenberg model on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice
via variational Monte Carlo method. We show that already relatively simple NQSs
can be used to approximate the ground state of this model in its different
phases and regimes. We first compare several types of NQSs with each other on
small lattices and benchmark their variational energies against the exact
diagonalization results. We argue that when precision, generality and
computational costs are taken into account, a good choice for addressing larger
systems is a shallow restricted Boltzmann machine NQS. We then show that such
NQS can describe the main phases of the model in zero magnetic field. Moreover,
NQS based on a restricted Boltzmann machine correctly describes the intriguing
plateaus forming in magnetization of the model as a function of increasing
magnetic field.

Point defect quantum bits in semiconductors have the potential to
revolutionize sensing at atomic scales. Currently, vacancy related defects,
such as the NV center in diamond and the VB$^-$ in hexagonal boron nitride
(hBN), are at the forefront of high spatial resolution and low dimensional
sensing. On the other hand, vacancies' reactive nature and instability at the
surface limit further developments. Here, we study the symmetric carbon
tetramers in hBN and propose them as a chemically stable spin qubit for sensing
in low dimensions. We utilize periodic-DFT and quantum chemistry approaches to
reliably and accurately predict the electronic, optical, and spin properties of
the studied defect. We show that the nitrogen centered symmetric carbon
tetramer gives rise to spin state dependent optical signals with strain
sensitive intersystem crossing rates. Furthermore, the weak hyperfine coupling
of the defect to their spin environments results in a reduced electron spin
resonance linewidth that may enhance sensitivity.

<br>
We study nonequilibrium steady states of a one-dimensional stochastic model,
originally introduced as an approximation of the Discrete Nonlinear
Schr\"odinger equation. This model is characterized by two conserved
quantities, namely mass and energy; it displays a ``normal", homogeneous phase,
separated by a condensed (negative-temperature) phase, where a macroscopic
fraction of energy is localized on a single lattice site. When steadily
maintained out of equilibrium by external reservoirs, the system exhibits
coupled transport herein studied within the framework of linear response
theory. We find that the Onsager coefficients satisfy an exact scaling
relationship, which allows reducing their dependence on the thermodynamic
variables to that on the energy density for unitary mass density. We also
determine the structure of the nonequilibrium steady states in proximity of the
critical line, proving the existence of paths which partially enter the
condensed region. This phenomenon is a consequence of the Joule effect: the
temperature increase induced by the mass current is so strong as to drive the
system to negative temperatures. Finally, since the model attains a diverging
temperature at finite energy, in such a limit the energy-mass conversion
efficiency reaches the ideal Carnot value.

<br>
<br>
When humidified at different moisture conditions, restrained spider silk
fibers can exhibit a very high supercontraction phenomenon. The hydration water
molecules induce a Hydrogen-bonds disruption process that, due to entropic
effects, decreases the natural -- zero force -- end-to-end chains length. By
considering a bundle of macromolecules, we describe supercontraction as a
possible actuation system and determine the maximum actuation force depending
on the silk properties at the molecular scale and on the constraining system
representing other silk threads or the actuated device. The comparison with
experimental results of Argiope trifasciata silk fibers show the effectiveness
of the proposed model in quantitatively predicting the experimental actuation
properties. The considered historical case study of obelisk rescue in Saint
Peter's Square (Rome) through ropes hydration is discussed evidencing the
optimal performances of this natural material adopted as moisture powered
actuator: we obtain a work density of 2.19 kJ/m3 making spider silk the most
performant hydration driven active material. Moreover we obtain a power density
of the order of 730 W/kg about three times the most performant carbon nanotube
actuators making such material very competitive as compared with all types of
actuator. The analytic description of the macroscopic actuation parameters from
microscale properties shows the possibility of adopting our approach also in
the field of bioinspired artificial silks design, possibly considering also
important non-linear effects in the actuated system.

Phase change materials, which show different electrical characteristics
across the phase transitions, have attracted considerable research attention
for their potential electronic device applications. Materials with
metal-to-insulator or charge density wave (CDW) transitions such as VO2 and
1T-TaS2 have demonstrated voltage oscillations due to their robust bi-state
resistive switching behavior with some basic neuronal characteristics. BaTiS3
is a small bandgap ternary chalcogenide that has recently reported the
emergence CDW order below 245 K. Here, we report on the discovery of DC voltage
/ current-induced reversible threshold switching in BaTiS3 devices between a
CDW phase and a room temperature semiconducting phase. The resistive switching
behavior is consistent with a Joule heating scheme and sustained voltage
oscillations with a frequency of up to 1 kHz has been demonstrated by
leveraging the CDW phase transition and the associated negative differential
resistance. Strategies of reducing channel sizes and improving thermal
management may further improve the device performance. Our findings establish
BaTiS3 as a promising CDW material for future energy-efficient electronics,

high pump fluences nonlinear dependence on the pump fluence is observed both in
the optical and terahertz probes.
