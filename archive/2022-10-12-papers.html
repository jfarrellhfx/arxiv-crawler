<h3>Realization of a spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid</h3>

The Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) theory describes the low-energy
excitations of strongly correlated one-dimensional (1D) fermions. In the past
years, a number of studies have provided a detailed understanding of this
universality class. More recently, theoretical investigations that go beyond
the standard low-temperature, linear-response, TLL regime have emerged as an
active area of research. While these provide a basis for understanding the
dynamics of the spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid, there are few experimental
investigations in this regime. Here we report the observation of a
thermally-induced spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid in an atomic Fermi gas
confined to 1D. We use Bragg spectroscopy to measure the suppression of
spin-charge separation and the decay of correlations as the temperature is
increased. Our results probe the crossover between the coherent and incoherent
regimes of the Luttinger liquid, and elucidate the interplay between the charge
and the spin degrees of freedom in this regime

<h3>Hydrodynamic Entropy and Emergence of Order in Two-dimensional Euler  Turbulence</h3>

Using numerical simulations, we show that the asymptotic states of
two-dimensional (2D) Euler turbulence exhibit large-scale flow structures due
to nonzero energy transfers among small wavenumber modes. These asymptotic
states, which depend on the initial conditions, are out of equilibrium, and
they are different from the predictions of Onsager and Kraichnan. We propose
"hydrodynamic entropy" to quantify order in 2D Euler turbulence; we show that
this entropy decreases with time, even though the system is isolated with no
dissipation and no contact with a heat bath.

<h3>Entanglement transitions with free fermions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05681" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05681</a>

We use Majorana operators to study entanglement dynamics under random free
fermion unitary evolution and projective measurements in one dimension. For
certain choices of unitary evolution, namely those which swap neighboring
Majorana operators, and measurements of neighboring Majorana bilinears, one can
map the evolution to the statistical model of completely packed loops with
crossings (CPLC) and study the corresponding phase diagram. This phase diagram
exhibits a transition from an area law to a critical Goldstone phase with a
logarithmic entropy scaling law. We generalize this model using the language of
fermionic Gaussian states to a general free fermion unitary evolution acting on
neighboring Majorana operators, and numerically compute its phase diagram. We
find that both the Goldstone and area law phases persist in this new phase
diagram, but with a shifted phase boundary. One important qualitative aspect of
the new phase boundary is that even for the case of commuting measurements, the
Goldstone phase persists up to a finite non-zero measurement rate. This is in
contrast with the CPLC, in which non-commuting measurements are necessary for
realizing the Goldstone phase. We also numerically compute the correlation
length critical exponent at the transition, which we find to be near to that of
the CPLC, and give a tentative symmetry based explanation for some differences
in the phase transition line between the CPLC and generalized models.

<h3>Hubbard Models for Quasicrystalline Potentials</h3>

Quasicrystals are long-range ordered, yet not periodic, and thereby present a
fascinating challenge for condensed matter physics, as one cannot resort to the
usual toolbox based on Bloch's theorem. Here, we present a numerical method for
constructing the Hubbard Hamiltonian of non-periodic potentials without making
use of Bloch's theorem and apply it to the case of an eightfold rotationally
symmetric 2D optical quasicrystal that was recently realized using cold atoms.
We construct maximally localised Wannier functions and use them to extract
on-site energies, tunneling amplitudes, and interaction energies. In addition,
we introduce a configuration-space representation, where sites are ordered in
terms of shape and local environment, that leads to a compact description of
the infinite-size quasicrystal in which all Hamiltonian parameters can be
expressed as smooth functions. This configuration-space picture allows one to
construct arbitrarily large tight-binding graphs for numerical many-body
calculations and enables new analytic arguments on the topological structure
and many-body physics of these models, for instance the conclusion that this
quasicrystal will host unit-filling Mott insulators in the thermodynamic limit.

<h3>A smooth transition towards a Tracy-Widom distribution for the largest  eigenvalue of interacting $k$-body fermionic Embedded Gaussian Ensembles</h3>

In spite of its simplicity, the central limit theorem captures one of the
most outstanding phenomena in mathematical physics, that of universality. While
this classical result is well understood it is still not very clear what
happens to this universal behaviour when the random variables become
correlated. A fruitful mathematically laboratory to investigate the rising of
new universal properties is offered by the set of eigenvalues of random
matrices. In this regard a lot of work has been done using the standard random
matrix ensembles and focusing on the distribution of extreme eigenvalues. In
this case, the distribution of the largest -- or smallest -- eigenvalue departs
from the Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko theorem yielding the celebrated Tracy-Widom
distribution. One may wonder, yet again, how robust is this new universal
behaviour captured by the Tracy-Widom distribution when the correlation among
eigenvalues changes. Few answers have been provided to this poignant question
and our intention in the present work is to contribute to this interesting
unexplored territory. Thus, we study numerically the probability distribution
for the normalized largest eigenvalue of the interacting $k$-body fermionic
orthogonal and unitary Embedded Gaussian Ensembles in the diluted limit. We
find a smooth transition from a slightly asymmetric Gaussian-like distribution,
for small $k/m$, to the Tracy-Widom distribution as $k/m\to 1$, where $k$ is
the rank of the interaction and $m$ is the number of fermions. Correlations at
the edge of the spectrum are stronger for small values of $k/m$, and are
independent of the number of particles considered. Our results indicate that
subtle correlations towards the edge of the spectrum distinguish the
statistical properties of the spectrum of interacting many-body systems in the
dilute limit, from those expected for the standard random matrix ensembles.

<h3>Average outpouring velocity and flow rate of grains discharged from a  tilted quasi-2D silo</h3>

The flow of granular materials through constricted openings is important in
many natural and industrial processes. These complex flows - featuring dense,
dissipative flow in the bulk but low-dissipation, low density outpouring in the
vicinity of the orifice - have long been characterized empirically by the
Beverloo rule and, recently, modeled successfully using energy balance. The
dependence of flow rate on the silo's angle with respect to gravity, however,
is not captured by current models. We experimentally investigate the role of
tilt angle in this work using a quasi-2D monolayer of grains in a silo. We
measure mass flow rate, the average exit velocities of grains, and the packing
fraction along the orifice with varying tilt angles. We propose a model that
describes our results (and earlier findings with 3D systems [H. G. Sheldon and
D. J. Durian, Granul. Matter 12, 579 (2010)]) by considering the dependence of
outpouring speed and angle with respect to the orifice angle and, importantly,
the angle of stagnant zones adjacent to the orifice. We conclude by posing
questions about possible extensions of our model in order to describe spatial
variations of exit velocity and density along the orifice cross section.

<h3>Magnetic anisotropy reversal driven by structural symmetry-breaking in  monolayer Î±-RuCl3</h3>

<br>
Layered {\alpha}-RuCl3 is a promising material to potentially realize the
long-sought Kitaev quantum spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. While
evidence of this exotic state has been reported under a modest in-plane
magnetic field, such behavior is largely inconsistent with theoretical
expectations of Kitaev phases emerging only in out-of-plane fields. These
predicted field-induced states have been mostly out of reach due to the strong
easy-plane anisotropy of bulk crystals, however. We use a combination of
tunneling spectroscopy, magnetotransport, electron diffraction, and ab initio
calculations to study the layer-dependent magnons, anisotropy, structure, and
exchange coupling in atomically thin samples. Due to structural distortions,
the sign of the average off-diagonal exchange changes in monolayer
{\alpha}-RuCl3, leading to a reversal of magnetic anisotropy to easy-axis. Our
work provides a new avenue to tune the magnetic interactions in {\alpha}-RuCl3
and allows theoretically predicted quantum spin liquid phases for out-of-plane
fields to be more experimentally accessible.

<h3>Role of inter-fibre bonds and their influence on sheet scale behaviour  of paper fibre networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05736" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05736</a>
<br>
<i>P. Samantray, R.H.J. Peerlings, T.J. Massart, O. RokoÅ¡, M.G.D. Geers</i>
<br>
In fibrous paper materials, an exposure to a variation in moisture content
causes changes in the geometrical and mechanical properties. Such changes are
strongly affected by the inter-fibre bonds, which are responsible for the
transfer of the hygro-mechanical response from one fibre to its neighbours in
the network, resulting in sheet-scale deformation. Most models developed in
literature assume perfect bonding between fibres. In the 3D reality, there is
some flexibility in the bond region, even for the perfectly bonded fibres,
because of the possibility of deformation gradients through the fibre
thickness. In earlier 2D idealizations, perfectly bonded fibres were assumed,
implying full kinematic constraint through the entire thickness of the sheet.
The purpose of the present study is to assess the effect of this assumption.
Using a homogenization approach, a random network of fibres is generated with
different coverages and modelled using finite elements. In order to understand
the role of bonding between fibres on the hygro-expansive behaviour of a
network, a bond model is developed. In this model, the fibres are modelled
using 2D regular bulk finite elements and the bonds are represented by
interfacial elements of finite stiffness, which are introduced between each
pair of fibres bonded in the network. These embedded interfacial elements form
a connection between two respective fibres, allowing relative displacements
between their mid-planes. The hygro-elastic response of networks obtained with
this bond model is investigated by varying the bond stiffness and the network
coverage under the application of mechanical loading and changes in moisture
content. Furthermore, the bond model is used to analyse the influence of
inter-fibre bonds on the anisotropic response of the paper fibre network.

<h3>Element-Specific First Order Reversal Curves Measured by Magnetic  Transmission X-ray Microscopy</h3>

<br>
The first order reversal curve (FORC) method is a macroscopic measurement
technique which can be used to extract quantitative, microscopic properties of
hysteretic systems. Using magnetic transmission X-ray microscopy (MTXM), local
element-specific FORC measurements are performed on a 20 nm thick film of CoTb.
The FORCs measured with microscopy reveal a step-by-step domain evolution under
the magnetic field cycling protocol, and provide a direct visualization of the
mechanistic interpretation of FORC diagrams. They are compared with
magnetometry FORCs and show good quantitative agreement. Furthermore, the high
spatial resolution and element-specific sensitivity of MTXM provide new
capabilities to measure FORCs on small regions or specific phases within
multicomponent systems, including buried layers in heterostructures. The
ability to perform FORCs on very small features is demonstrated with the
MTXM-FORC measurement of a rectangular microstructure with vortex-like Landau
structures. This work demonstrates the confluence of two uniquely powerful
techniques to achieve quantitative insight into nanoscale magnetic behavior.

<h3>Optimization of Non-Equilibrium Self-Assembly Protocols Using Markov  State Models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05749" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05749</a>

<br>
The promise of self-assembly to enable bottom-up formation of materials with
prescribed architectures and functions has driven intensive efforts to uncover
rational design principles for maximizing the yield of a target structure. Yet,
despite many successful examples of self-assembly, ensuring kinetic
accessibility of the target structure remains an unsolved problem in many
systems. In particular, long-lived kinetic traps can result in assembly times
that vastly exceed experimentally accessible timescales. One proposed solution
is to design non-equilibrium assembly protocols in which system parameters
change over time to avoid such kinetic traps. Here, we develop a framework to
combine Markov state model (MSM) analysis with optimal control theory to
compute a time-dependent protocol that maximizes the yield of the target
structure at a finite-time. We present an adjoint-based gradient descent method
that, in conjunction with MSMs for a system as a function of its control
parameters, enables efficiently optimizing the assembly protocol. We also
describe an interpolation approach to significantly reduce the number of
simulations required to construct the MSMs. We demonstrate our approach on two
examples; a simple semi-analytic model for the folding of a polymer of
colloidal particles, and a more complex model for capsid assembly. Our results
show that optimizing time-dependent protocols can achieve significant
improvements in yields of selected structures, including equilibrium free
energy minima, long-lived metastable structures, and transient states.

<h3>Generalized Rashba Electron-Phonon Coupling and Superconductivity in  Strontium Titanate</h3>

SrTiO3 is known for its proximity to a ferroelectric phase and for showing an
optimal doping for superconductivity with a characteristic dome-like behaviour
resembling systems close to a quantum critical point. Several mechanisms have
been proposed to link these phenomena, but the abundance of undetermined
parameters prevents a definite assessment. Here, we use ab initio computations
supplemented with a microscopic model to study the linear coupling between
conduction electrons and the ferroelectric soft transverse modes allowed in the
presence of spin-orbit coupling. We find a robust Rashba-like coupling, which
can become surprisingly strong for particular forms of the polar eigenvector.
We characterize this sensitivity for general eigenvectors and, for the
particular form deduced by hyper-Raman scattering experiments, we find a BCS
pairing coupling constant of the right order of magnitude to support
superconductivity. The ab initio computations enable us to go beyond the
linear-in-momentum conventional Rashba-like interaction and naturally explain
the dome behaviour including a characteristic asymmetry. The dome is attributed
to a momentum dependent quenching of the angular momentum due to a competition
between spin-orbit and hopping energies. The optimum density for having maximum
Tc results in rather good agreement with experiments without free parameters.
These results make the generalized Rashba dynamic coupling to the ferroelectric
soft mode a compelling pairing mechanism to understand bulk superconductivity
in doped SrTiO3.

<h3>Patterned bilayer graphene as a tunable, strongly correlated system</h3>

Recent observations of superconductivity in Moire graphene have lead to an
intense interest in that system, with subsequent studies revealing a more
complex phase diagram including correlated insulators and ferromagnetic phases.
Here we propose an alternate system, electrostatically patterned bilayer
graphene (PBG), in which a supermodulation is induced via metallic gates rather
than the moire effect. We show that, by varying either the gap or the
modulation strength, bilayer graphene can be tuned into the strongly correlated
regime. Further calculations show that this is not possible in monolayer
graphene. We present a general technique for addressing Coulomb screening of
the periodic potential and demonstrate that this system is experimentally
feasible.

In this research work, roll-to-roll chemical vapor deposited graphene device
electronic transport properties are benchmarked to elucidate and comprehend
mobility degradation in the real-world commercial application of graphene
devices. Multifarious device design morphology in the graphene and
two-dimensional material with diverse background materials compositions and
processing recipes incorporate various scattering sources in the devices. To
understand the nature of mobility degradation in roll-to-roll chemical vapor
deposited graphene production devices, we employed multi-scale, multi-physics
bottom-up, non-equilibrium Green's function-based quantum transport formalism.
In this framework, we numerically incorporate various scattering mechanisms to
deduce the measurand mobility at the last stage of computation to observe
various scattering potential impacts on the production device performance. We
have analyzed the variation in transmission, electronic charge density,
electrostatic Poisson potential, energy-resolved flux density, and
current-voltage characteristics and inferred the Drude mobility with different
scattering potentials in various graphene devices. These scattering mechanisms
treat scattering potentials as the first-order phonon Dyson self-energy term in
the third loop of the two-looped self-consistent Poisson-Non-equilibrium
Green's function iteration. Furthermore, multiple scattering scenarios
implemented through a generalized contact self-energy scattering calculation
ascribe the effect of contact scattering to the graphene device in
quasi-ballistic transport limit. In this scheme, the effect of all the physical
scattering mechanisms is lumped into one energy uncertainty or scattering rate
parameter to include in the device's contact self-energy interaction term bound
by the upper limit of Heisenberg uncertainty for the interacting quantum
charged particles.

<h3>First Principles Determination of the Potential-of-Zero-Charge in an  Alumina-coated Aluminum/Water Interface Model for Corrosion Applications</h3>

The surfaces of most metals immersed in aqueous electrolytes have a
several-nanometer-thick oxide/hydroxide surface layer. This gives rise to the
existence of both metal|oxide and oxide|liquid electrotlyte interfaces, and
makes it challenging to correlate atomic length-scale structures with
electrochemical properties such the potential-of-zero-charge (PZC). The PZC
value has been shown to be correlated the pitting onset potential for
corrosion. In this work, we conduct large-scale Density Functional Theory and
ab initio molecular dynamics to calculate the PZC of a
Al(111)|gamma-Al(2)O(3)(110)|water double-interface model within the context of
aluminum corrosion. By partitioning the multiple interfaces involved into
binary components with additive contributions to the overall work function and
voltage, we predict the PZC to be -1.53 V vs. SHE for this model. We also
calculate the orbital energy levels of defects like oxygen vacancies in the
oxide, which are critical parameters in theories associated with pitting
corrosion. We predict that the Fermi level at the PZC lies above the impurity
defect levels of the oxygen vacancies, which are therefore uncharged at the
PZC. From the PZC estimate, we predict the voltage needed to create oxygen
vacancies with net positive charges within a flat-band approximation.

<h3>Wave packet dynamics in a non-Hermitian exciton-polariton system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05860" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05860</a>
<br>
<i>Y.-M. Robin Hu, Elena A. Ostrovskaya, Eliezer Estrecho</i>
<br>
We theoretically investigate the dynamics of wave packets in a generic,
non-Hermitian, optically anisotropic exciton-polariton system that exhibits
degeneracies of its complex-valued eigenenergies in the form of pairs of
exceptional points in momentum space. We observe the self-acceleration and
reshaping of the wave packets governed by their eigenenergies. We further find
that the exciton-polariton wave packets tend to self-organize into the
eigenstate with the smaller decay rate, then propagate towards the minima of
the decay rates in momentum space, resulting in directional transport in real
space. We also describe the formation of pseudospin topological defects on the
imaginary Fermi arc, where the decay rates of the two eigenstate coincide in
momentum space. These effects of non-Hermiticity on the dynamics of exciton
polaritons can be observed experimentally in a microcavity with optically
anisotropic cavity spacer or exciton-hosting materials.

<h3>Spin Diffusion in Spin Glasses Have Two Magnetic Variables, $\vec{M}$  and $\vec{m}$</h3>

<br>
Experiment has established that spin-glasses can support a steady-state spin
current $\vec{j}_{i}$. However, the accepted theory of spin glass dynamics
permits oscillations but no steady-state spin current. Onsager's irreversible
thermodynamics implies that the spin current ia proportional to the gradient of
a magnetization. We argue, however, that the magnon distribution function
associated with the local equilibrium magnetization $\vec{M}$ cannot diffuse
because it represents $10^{23}$ variables. We therefore invoke the
non-equilibrium magnetization $\vec{m}$, which in spintronics is called the
{\it spin accumulation}. Applying the theory of irreversible thermodynamics we
indeed find that it predicts spin diffusion, and we consider other experimental
consequences of the theory.

<h3>Autoregressive neural Slater-Jastrow ansatz for variational Monte Carlo  simulation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05871" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05871</a>
<br>
<i>Stephan Humeniuk, Yuan Wan, Lei Wang</i>
<br>
Direct sampling from a Slater determinant is combined with an autoregressive
deep neural network as a Jastrow factor into a fully autoregressive
Slater-Jastrow ansatz for variational quantum Monte Carlo, which allows for
uncorrelated sampling. The elimination of the autocorrelation time leads to a
stochastic algorithm with provable cubic scaling (with a potentially large
prefactor), i.e. the number of operations for producing an uncorrelated sample
and for calculating the local energy scales like $\mathcal{O}(N_s^3)$ with the
number of orbitals (lattice sites) $N_s$, largely independent of the filling.
In cases where the autocorrelation time scales with the system size this
drastically changes the scaling of the computational effort for achieving a
certain Monte Carlo error. Direct sampling also improves the sampling
efficiency compared to the Metropolis update which can suffer from bottlenecks
due to low acceptance rate. The implementation is benchmarked on the
two-dimensional $t-V$ model of spinless fermions on the square lattice by
comparison with exact diagonalization, yielding consistent results for a
variational ansatz which is limited by the sign structure of a single Slater
determinant. By co-optimizing the reference Slater determinant in the presence
of the Jastrow factor the sign structure of the initial Hartree-Fock Slater
determinant can be changed considerably, which aids the optimization.

<h3>Pair distribution function analysis driven by atomistic simulations:  Application to microwave radiation synthesized TiO$_2$ and ZrO$_2$</h3>

A workflow is presented for performing pair distribution function (PDF)
analysis of defected materials using structures generated from atomistic
simulations. A large collection of structures, which differ in the types and
concentrations of defects present, are obtained through energy minimization
with an empirical interatomic potential. Each of the structures is refined
against an experimental PDF. The structures with the lowest goodness of fit
$R_w$ values are taken as being representative of the experimental structure.
The workflow is applied to anatase titanium dioxide ($a$-TiO$_2$) and
tetragonal zirconium dioxide ($t$-ZrO$_2$) synthesized in the presence of
microwave radiation, a low temperature process that generates disorder. The
results suggest that titanium vacancies and interstitials are the dominant
defects in $a$-TiO$_2$, while oxygen vacancies dominate in $t$-ZrO$_2$.
Analysis of the atomic displacement parameters extracted from the PDF
refinement and mean squared displacements calculated from molecular dynamics
simulations indicate that while these two quantities are closely related, it is
challenging to make quantitative comparisons between them. The workflow can be
applied to other materials systems, including nanoparticles.

<h3>Strong electron-phonon coupling and quasi-1D polaron in Sb$_2$S$_3$</h3>

<br>
Antimony sulphide (Sb$_2$S$_3$) is an Earth-abundant and non-toxic material
that is under investigation for solar energy conversion applications. However,
it still suffers from poor power conversion efficiency and a large open circuit
voltage loss that have usually been attributed to point or interfacial defects
and trap states. More recently, a self-trapped exciton has been suggested as
the microscopic origin for the performance loss. By using first-principles
methods, we demonstrate that Sb$_2$S$_3$ exhibits strong electron-phonon
coupling, which results in a large renormalization of 200 meV of the absorption
edge when temperature increases from 10K to 300K, and in a quasi-1D electron
polaron that is delocalized in the ribbon direction of the crystal structure,
but localized in the inter-ribbon directions. The calculated polaron formation
energy of 67 meV agrees well with experimental measurements, suggesting that
self-trapped excitons are likely to form with the mediation of an electron
polaron. Our results demonstrate the importance of systematically investigating
electron-phonon coupling and polaron formation in the antimony chalcogenide
family of semiconductors for optoelectronic applications.

The superconducting (SC) phase diagram in uranium ditelluride is explored
under magnetic fields ($H$) along the hard magnetic b-axis using a high-quality
single crystal with $T_{\rm c} = 2.1$ K. Simultaneous electrical resistivity
and AC magnetic susceptibility measurements discern low- and high-field SC
(LFSC and HFSC, respectively) phases with contrasting field-angular dependence.
Crystal quality increases the upper critical field of the LFSC phase, but the
$H^{\ast}$ of $\sim$15 T, at which the HFSC phase appears, is always the same
through the various crystals. A phase boundary signature is also observed
inside the LFSC phase near $H^{\ast}$, indicating an intermediate SC phase
characterized by small flux pinning forces.

<br>
Calculations combining first-principles electron-phonon ($e$-ph) interactions
with the Boltzmann equation enable studies of ultrafast carrier and phonon
dynamics. However, in materials with weak Coulomb screening, electrons and
holes form bound excitons and their scattering processes become correlated,
posing additional challenges for modeling nonequilibrium physics. Here we show
calculations of ultrafast exciton dynamics and related time-domain
spectroscopies using $ab~initio$ exciton-phonon (ex-ph) interactions together
with an excitonic Boltzmann equation. Starting from the nonequilibrium exciton
populations, we develop simulations of time-domain absorption and photoemission
spectra that take into account electron-hole correlations. We use this method
to study monolayer WSe$_2$, where our calculations predict sub-picosecond
timescales for exciton relaxation and valley depolarization and reveal the key
role of intermediate dark excitons. The approach introduced in this work
enables a quantitative description of nonequilibrium dynamics and ultrafast
spectroscopies in materials with strongly bound excitons.

<h3>Spatial spin-spin correlations of the single-impurity Anderson model  with a ferromagnetic bath</h3>

<br>
We investigate the interplay between the Kondo effect and the ferromagnetism
by an one dimension Anderson impurity model with a spin partially polarized
bath, using the projective truncation approximation under Lacroix basis.The
equal-time spatial spin-spin correlation function (SSCF) is calculated. For the
case of spin-unpolarized conduction electrons, it agrees qualitatively with the
results from density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). For system with
partially spin-polarized conduction electrons, an oscillation in the envelope
of SSCF emerges due to the beating of two Friedel oscillations associated to
two spin-split Fermi surfaces of conduction electrons. The period is
proportional to the inverse of magnetic field $h$. A fitting formula is
proposed to perfectly fits the numerical results of SSCF in both the short- and
long-range regions. For large enough bath spin polarization, a bump appears in
the curve of the integrated SSCF. It marks the boundary between the suppressed
Kondo cloud and the polarized bath sites.

<h3>Comment on Bilayer aggregate microstructure determines viscoelasticity  of lung surfactant suspensions by C.O. Ciutara and J.A. Zasadzinski, Soft  Matter, 2021, 17, 5170-5182</h3>

<i>Jean-FranÃ§ois Berret</i>
<br>
For applications of pulmonary surfactant delivery to the lungs, the question
of rheology of the existing clinical formulations is of upmost importance.
Recently, Ciutara and Zasadsinky (Soft Matter, 2021, 17, 5170-5182) measured
the rheological properties of Infasurf, Survanta and Curosurf, three of the
most used pulmonary surfactant substitutes. This study revealed that these
fluids are shear-thinning and characterized by a yield stress. The results
obtained by Ciutara et al. on Curosurf differ from our results published in
Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces, 2019, 178, 337-345 and in ACS Nano,
2020, 14, 466 - 475. In contrast, we found that Curosurf suspensions are
viscous Newtonian or slightly shear-thinning fluids, with no evidence of yield
stress. The purpose of this Comment is to discuss possible causes for the
discrepancy between the two studies, and to suggest that for biological fluids
such as surfactant substitutes, the microrheology technique of rotational
magnetic spectroscopy (MRS) can provide valuable results.

<br>
We demonstrate an unexpected decay-recovery behaviour in the time-dependent
$^{1}\mathrm{H}$ NMR relaxation times of water confined within a hydrating
porous material. Our observations are rationalised by considering the combined
effects of decreasing material pore size and evolving interfacial chemistry,
which facilitate a transition between surface-limited and diffusion-limited
relaxation regimes. Such behaviour necessitates the realisation of temporally
evolving surface relaxivity, highlighting potential caveats in the classical
interpretation of NMR relaxation data obtained from complex porous systems.

<br>
Experimental materials data are heterogeneous and include a variety of
metadata for processing and characterization conditions, making the
implementation of data-driven approaches for developing novel materials
difficult. In this paper, we introduce the Thin-Film Alloy Database (TFADB), a
materials data management platform, designed for combinatorially investigated
thin-film alloys through various experimental tools. Using TFADB, researchers
can readily upload, edit, and retrieve multidimensional experimental alloy
data, such as composition, thickness, X-ray Diffraction, electrical
resistivity, nanoindentation, and image data. Furthermore,
composition-dependent properties from the database can easily be managed in a
format adequate to be preprocessed for machine learning analyses. High
flexibility of the software allows management of new types of materials data
that can be potentially acquired from new combinatorial experiments.

<h3>Perfect optical spin-filtering in antiferromagnetic stanene nanoribbons  induced by band bending and uniaxial strain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06037" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06037</a>
<br>
<i>Fatemeh Rahimi, Arash Phirouznia</i>
<br>
Non-equilibrium spin-polarized transport properties of antiferromagnetic
stanene nanoribbons are theoretically studied under the combining effect of a
normal electric field and linearly polarized irradiation based on the
tight-binding model at room temperature. Due to the existence of spin-orbit
coupling in stanene lattice, applying normal electric field leads to splitting
of band degeneracy of spin-resolved energy levels in conduction and valence
bands. Furthermore, unequivalent absorption of the polarized photons at two
valleys which is attributed to an antiferromagnetic exchange field results in
unequal spin-polarized photocurrent for spin-up and spin-down components.
Interestingly, in the presence of band bending which has been induced by edge
potentials, an allowable quantum efficiency occurs over a wider wavelength
region of the incident light. It is especially important that the variation of
an exchange magnetic field generates spin semi-conducting behavior in the
bended band structure. Moreover, it is shown that optical spin-filtering effect
is obtained under the simultaneous effect of uniaxial strain and narrow edge
potential.

<h3>Charge, spin, and heat shot noises in the absence of average currents:  Conditions on bounds at zero and finite frequencies</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06051" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06051</a>
<br>
<i>Ludovico Tesser, Matteo Acciai, Christian SpÃ¥nslÃ¤tt, Juliette Monsel, Janine Splettstoesser</i>
<br>
Nonequilibrium situations where selected currents are suppressed are of
interest in fields like thermoelectrics and spintronics, raising the question
of how the related noises behave. We study such zero-current charge, spin, and
heat noises in a two-terminal mesoscopic conductor. In the presence of voltage,
spin and temperature biases, the nonequilibrium (shot) noises of charge, spin,
and heat can be arbitrarily large, even if their average currents vanish.
However, as soon as a temperature bias is present, additional equilibrium
(thermal-like) noise necessarily occurs. We show that this equilibrium noise
sets an upper bound on the zero-current charge and spin shot noises, even if
additional voltage or spin biases are present. We demonstrate that these bounds
can be overcome for heat transport by breaking the spin and electron-hole
symmetries, respectively. By contrast, we show that the bound on the charge
noise for strictly two-terminal conductors even extends into the
finite-frequency regime.

<br>
Skyrmion-hosting multilayer stacks are promising avenues for applications,
although little is known about the depth dependence of the magnetism. We
address this by reporting the results of circular dichroic resonant elastic
x-ray scattering (CD-REXS) and low-energy muon-spin relaxation (LE-{\mu}SR)
measurements on a stack comprising Ta/[CoFeB/MgO/Ta]16 on a Si substrate.
Energy dependent CD-REXS shows a continuous, monotonic evolution of the
domain-wall helicity angle with incident energy, consistent with a
three-dimensional hybrid domain-wall-like structure that changes from
N\'eel-like near the surface to Bloch-like deeper within the sample. LE-{\mu}SR
reveals that the magnetic field distribution in the first six layers of the
stack is distinct from that in layers further from the surface, quantifying the
depth at which the static and dynamic magnetic structure varies. By increasing
the applied magnetic field, we find a reduction in the volume occupied by
domain walls at all depths, consistent with a crossover into a region dominated
by skyrmions above approximately 180 mT.

<br>
The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model in a two-dimensional rectangular lattice
features gapless or gapped Dirac cones with topological edge states along
specific peripheries. While such a simple model has been recently realized in
photonic/acoustic lattices and electric circuits, its material realization in
condensed matter systems is still lacking. Here, we study the atomic and
electronic structure of a rectangular Si lattice on Ag(001) by angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. We demonstrate that
the Si lattice hosts gapped Dirac cones at the Brillouin zone corners. Our
tight-binding analysis reveals that the Dirac bands can be described by a 2D
SSH model with anisotropic polarizations. The gap of the Dirac cone is driven
by alternative hopping amplitudes in one direction and staggered potential
energies in the other one and hosts topological edge states. Our results
establish an ideal platform to explore the rich physical properties of the 2D
SSH model.

<h3>Rashba and Dresselhaus effects in doped methylammonium lead halide  perovskite MAPbI$_3$</h3>

<br>
Inorganic-organic lead halide perovskites, particularly methylammonium lead
halide (MAPbI$_3$) perovskite, is perceived to be a promising material for
optoelectronics and spintronics. However, lead toxicity and instability under
air and moisture restrict its practical uses. Hence, it is essential to reduce
lead extent by substituting appropriate alternatives and making a hybrid
perovskite. We substitute Sn and Ge in cubic MAPbI$_3$ and compare various
properties of hybrid perovskites by employing state-of-the-art
first-principles-based methodologies, viz., density functional theory (DFT)
with semilocal and hybrid functional (HSE06) and generalized gradient
approximation (PBE) combined with spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We mainly study
the Rashba-Dresselhaus (RD) effect which occurs here due to two major
mechanisms breaking inversion symmetry i.e., static and dynamic, and the
presence of heavy elements contributing to significant SOC. We find
non-negligible spin-splitting effects in the conduction band minimum (CBm) and
valence band maximum (VBM) for hybrid perovskites. For a deeper understanding
of the observed spin-splitting, the spin textures are analyzed and Rashba
coefficients are calculated. We find that Dresselhaus effect comes into picture
in substituted hybrids in addition to the usual Rashba effect observed in
pristine compound. Further, a significant value of Rashba coefficient was
observed in substituted hybrid perovskites. We also observe that the strength
of Rashba spin-splitting can be substantially tuned on application of uniaxial
strain ($\pm5\%$). More interestingly, we notice that some of the hybrids are
mechanically stable and ductile. Hence these hybrid perovskites can prove to be
potent for perovskite-based spintronic applications.

<h3>Molecular dynamics simulation of the ferroelectric phase transition in  GeTe: displacive or order-disorder?</h3>

<br>
<i>ÄorÄe DangiÄ, Stephen Fahy, Ivana SaviÄ</i>
<br>
Experimental investigations of the phase transition in GeTe provide
contradictory conclusions regarding the nature of the phase transition.
Considering growing interest in technological applications of GeTe, settling
these disputes is of great importance. To that end, we present a molecular
dynamics study of the structural phase transition in GeTe using a
machine-learned interatomic potential with ab-initio accuracy. First, we
calculate the asymmetric shape of the radial distribution function of the
nearest-neighbor bonds above the critical temperature, in agreement with
previous studies. However, we show that this effect is not necessarily linked
with the order-disorder phase transition and can occur as a result of large
anharmonicity. Next, we study in detail the static and dynamic properties of
the order parameter in the vicinity of the phase transition and find
fingerprints of both order-disorder and displacive phase transition.

I show a nontrivial functional giving a conservation quantity in the
collisional energy cascade of dissipative Maxwell gases: a fractional-calculus
extension of the mean energy. The conservation of this quantity directly leads
the power-law energy tail that is stationary during the temporal evolution. In
the thermal limit, this quantity naturally reduces to the standard mean energy.
This conservation law and its extension to particles with other interactions
are demonstrated with a Monte-Carlo simulation for inelastic gases.

Increasing attention is being paid to $\alpha$$_2$ Ti$_3$(Al,Sn)
precipitation from the $\alpha$ phase of titanium alloys owing to its effect on
slip band formation, localisation and the implications for fatigue performance
in jet engine titanium. However, the early stages of $\alpha$$_2$ precipitation
have historically been difficult to observe in TEM, neutron diffraction or atom
probe analysis. Here, small angle X-ray scattering is used to reexamine the
phase boundary in binary Ti-Al and Ti-Sn alloys with around 500 ppmw O. It is
found that the phase boundaries in the literature are approximately correct, at
6.2 wt.% Al and 16.9 wt.% Sn, and that this favours the use of Al as a solid
solution strengthener over Sn for ambient temperature applications. However,
once O content and phase partitioning in $\alpha$+$\beta$ alloys are taken into
account, this implies that Al$_{eq}$ limits for future alloy design of critical
rotating parts should be lowered substantially.

<h3>Thermodynamics of the Ising model encoded in restricted Boltzmann  machines</h3>

<br>
<i>Jing Gu, Kai Zhang</i>
<br>
The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a two-layer energy-based model that
uses its hidden-visible connections to learn the underlying distribution of
visible units, whose interactions are often complicated by high-order
correlations. Previous studies on the Ising model of small system sizes have
shown that RBMs are able to accurately learn the Boltzmann distribution and
reconstruct thermal quantities at temperatures away from the critical point
$T_c$. How the RBM encodes the Boltzmann distribution and captures the phase
transition are, however, not well explained. In this work, we perform RBM
learning of the $2d$ and $3d$ Ising model and carefully examine how the RBM
extracts useful probabilistic and physical information from Ising
configurations. We find several indicators derived from the weight matrix that
could characterize the Ising phase transition. We verify that the hidden
encoding of a visible state tends to have an equal number of positive and
negative units, whose sequence is randomly assigned during training and can be
inferred by analyzing the weight matrix. We also explore the physical meaning
of visible energy and loss function (pseudo-likelihood) of the RBM and show
that they could be harnessed to predict the critical point or estimate physical
quantities such as entropy.

<br>
Understanding thermodynamics in liquids at the atomic level is challenging
because of strong atomic interactions and lack of symmetry. Recent prior
theoretical works have focused on describing heat capacity of liquids in terms
of phonon-like excitations but often rely on fitting parameters and ad hoc
assumptions. In this work, we perform microscopic analysis on instantaneous
normal modes and velocity autocorrelations on molecular dynamics simulations of
single element systems over wide ranges of temperature (up to $10^8$ K) and
pressure (up to 1 TPa). Our results demonstrate that heat capacity of liquids
can be described by a combination of both solid-like and gas-like degrees of
freedom, leading to a unified framework to describe heat capacity of all three
phases of matter: solid, liquid, and gas.

<h3>Light-induced switch based on edge modes in irradiated thin topological  insulators</h3>

<br>

<br>
We investigate transport properties through nano-ribbons of thin topological
insulators irradiated by high frequency light with circular polarization. By
using high frequency regime, a coherent and quantized transport through the
nano-ribbon is guaranteed and then Lanadauer formalism is applicable. It is
demonstrated that the pseudo-spin edge modes inside the band gap can host
transmission through this nano-junction which their localization on the top and
bottom edges depend strongly on the light polarization. These edge modes
persist even if we apply a source-drain bias. Based on this edge selectivity
for the current, one can design a light-induced switch with an appropriate
on/off ratio of the current which is composed of two scattering regions with
opposite light polarization. The local current on each bond shows how the
current is passing through the edges and jumps into the opposite edge.
Furthermore, some other nano-junctions are proposed as electronic switches
which are designed based on the mass term engineering of the scattering region
by means of perpendicular magnetization induced by magnetic doping and also
structure inversion asymmetry applied on the scattering region.

<br>
We calculated the critical temperature in the framework of s+-+d-wave
multiband Eliashberg theory. We have solved these equations numerically to see
at what values of the input parameters there is a solution with a non-zero
critical temperature and what is the symmetry of the order parameter of this
solution. For our model we consider the pnictide case with simplifications that
allow us to obtain the most general possible information. For selected and
representative cases in which the order parameter has s+-+d symmetry, we
calculated the superconducting density of states, the temperature dependence of
the gaps, and the superfluid density so that comparison with experimental data
can be made. Finally, we show that such a system has only a twofold in-plane
symmetry and undergoes a transition from nodal to fully gapped with increasing
temperature.

Electrical switching of N\'eel order in an antiferromagnetic insulator is
desirable as a basis for memory applications. Unlike electrically-driven
switching of ferromagnetic order via spin-orbit torques, electrical switching
of antiferromagnetic order remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the
low-field magnetic properties of 30 nm thick, c-axis oriented
$\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ Hall devices using a diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center
scanning microscope. Using the canted moment of $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ as a
magnetic handle on its N\'eel vector, we apply a saturating in-plane magnetic
field to create a known initial state before letting the state relax in low
field for magnetic imaging. We repeat this procedure for different in-plane
orientations of the initialization field. We find that the magnetic field
images are characterized by stronger magnetic textures for fields along
$[\bar{1}\bar{1}20]$ and $[11\bar{2}0]$, suggesting that despite the expected
3-fold magneto-crystalline anisotropy, our $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ thin films have
an overall in-plane uniaxial anisotropy. We also study current-induced
switching of the magnetic order in $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. We find that the
fraction of the device that switches depends on the current pulse duration,
amplitude and direction relative to the initialization field. Specifically, we
find that switching is most efficient when current is applied along the
direction of the initialization field.

Recent experimental progress has produced Molecular Superfluids (MSF) in
thermal equilibrium; this opens the door to a new class of experiments
investigating the associated thermodynamic and dynamical responses. We review
the theoretical picture of the phase diagram and quasiparticle spectrum in the
Atomic Superfluid (ASF) and MSF phases. We further compute the parametric
dependence of the quasiparticle lifetimes at one-loop order. In the MSF phase,
the $U(1)$ particle number symmetry breaks to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and the spectrum
exhibits a gapless Goldstone mode in addition to a gapped
$\mathbb{Z}_2$-protected atom-like mode. In the ASF phase, the $U(1)$ symmetry
breaks completely, leaving behind a Goldstone mode and an unprotected gapped
mode. In both phases, the Goldstone mode decays with a rate given by the
celebrated Belyaev result, as in a single component condensate. In the MSF
phase, the gapped mode is sharp up to a critical Cherenkov momentum beyond
which it emits phonons. In the ASF phase, the gapped mode decays with a
constant rate even at small momenta. These decay rates govern the spectral
response in microtrap tunneling experiments and lead to sharp features in the
transmission spectrum of atoms fired through molecular clouds.

A pump-probe dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) experiment was carried out at
the Advanced Photon Source (APS) with nanosecond drive laser pulses and hybrid
mode X-ray probe pulses. We observe a thermal decay due to laser-induced heat
diffusion in a Germanium single crystal which matches the theoretical
prediction. The single pulse DFXM imaging in combination with the laser-pump
X-ray probe method could reveal thermal strain formation and propagation of the
acoustic wave "on-the-fly" generated by a laser-induced lattice deformation.
This will open a new avenue of materials research on laser-induced dynamic
phenomena in solids at sub-nanosecond time scales.

The rigidity transition occurs when, as the density of microscopic components
is increased, a disordered medium becomes able to transmit and ensure
macroscopic mechanical stability, owing to the appearance of a space-spanning
rigid connected component, or cluster. As a continuous phase transition it
exhibits a scale invariant critical point, at which the rigid clusters are
random fractals. We show, using numerical analysis, that these clusters are
also conformally invariant, and we use conformal field theory to predict the
form of universal finite size effects. Furthermore, although connectivity and
rigidity percolation are usually though to belong to different universality
classes and thus be of fundamentally different natures, we provide evidence of
unexpected similarities between the statistical properties of their random
clusters at criticality. Our work opens a new research avenue through the
application of the powerful 2D conformal field theory tools to understand the
critical behavior of a wide range of physical and biological materials
exhibiting such a mechanical transition.

Sn adatoms on a Si(111) substrate with 1/3 monolayer coverage form a
two-dimensional triangular adatom lattice with one unpaired electron per site
and an antiferromagnetic Mott insulating state. The Sn layers can be modulation
hole-doped and metallized using heavily-doped $p$-type Si(111) substrates, and
become superconducting at low temperatures. While the pairing symmetry of the
superconducting state is currently unknown, the combination of repulsive
interactions and frustration inherent to the triangular adatom lattice opens up
the possibility for a chiral order parameter. Here, we study the
superconducting state of Sn/Si(111) using scanning tunneling
microscopy/spectroscopy and quasi-particle interference imaging. We find
evidence for a doping-dependent $T_c$ with a fully gapped order parameter, the
presence of time-reversal symmetry breaking, and a strong enhancement of the
zero-bias conductance near the edges of the superconducting domains. While each
individual piece of evidence could have a more mundane interpretation, our
combined results suggest the tantalizing possibility that Sn/Si(111) is an
unconventional chiral d-wave superconductor.

Magnetic systems governed by exchange interactions between magnetic moments
harbor frustration that leads to ground state degeneracy and results in the new
topological state often referred to as a frustrated state of matter (FSM). The
frustration in the commonly discussed magnetic systems has a spatial origin.
Here we demonstrate that an array of nanomagnets coupled by the real retarded
exchange interactions develops a new state of matter, time frustrated matter
(TFM). In a spin system with the time-dependent retarded exchange interaction,
a single spin-flip influences other spins not instantly but after some delay.
This implies that the sign of the exchange interaction changes, leading to
either ferro- or antiferromagnetic interaction, depends on time. As a result,
the system's temporal evolution is essentially non-Markovian. The emerging
competition between different magnetic orders leads to a new kind of time-core
frustration. To establish this paradigmatic shift, we focus on the exemplary
system, a granular multiferroic, where the exchange transferring medium has a
pronounced frequency dispersion and hence develops the TFM.

Entanglement is crucial to many quantum applications including quantum
information processing, simulation of quantum many-body systems, and
quantum-enhanced sensing. Molecules, because of their rich internal structure
and interactions, have been proposed as a promising platform for quantum
science. Deterministic entanglement of individually controlled molecules has
nevertheless been a long-standing experimental challenge. Here we demonstrate,
for the first time, on-demand entanglement of individually prepared molecules.
Using the electric dipolar interaction between pairs of molecules prepared
using a reconfigurable optical tweezer array, we realize an entangling
two-qubit gate, and use it to deterministically create Bell pairs. Our results
demonstrate the key building blocks needed for quantum information processing,
simulation of quantum spin models, and quantum-enhanced sensing. They also open
up new possibilities such as using trapped molecules for quantum-enhanced
fundamental physics tests and exploring collisions and chemical reactions with
entangled matter.

The field of two-dimensional materials has mastered the fabrication and
characterisation of a broad range of novel high-quality compounds that feature
increasing complexity. Determination of the band structure parameters of such
complex materials is a major ingredient required for quantitative theory. This
task currently presents a formidable challenge: ab initio methods often do not
provide quantitatively accurate values of parameters, whereas inferring band
structure parameters from experiments is hindered by the complexity of the band
structure and indirect nature of experimental probes. In this work we propose a
general framework for determination of band structure parameters from
experimental data based on deep neural networks. As a specific example we apply
our method to the penetration field capacitance measurement of trilayer
graphene that effectively probes its density of states. First, we demonstrate
that a trained deep network gives accurate predictions for the penetration
field capacitance as a function of tight-binding parameters. Next, we use the
fast and accurate predictions from the trained network to automatically
determine tight-binding parameters directly from experimental data, with
extracted parameters being in a good agreement with values in the literature.
We conclude by discussing potential applications of our method to other
materials and experimental techniques beyond penetration field capacitance.

Topological states of matter lie at the heart of our modern understanding of
condensed matter systems. In two-dimensional (2D) quantum Hall insulators, the
non-trivial topology, defined by the first Chern number, manifests as a
quantized Hall conductance and protected ballistic edge modes. Besides
topological insulators and Weyl semi-metals experimentally realized in 3D
materials, a large variety of topological systems, theoretically predicted in
dimensions $D > 3$, remains unexplored - among them a generalization of the
quantum Hall effect in 4D. So far, topological properties linked with the 4D
Hall effect have been revealed via geometrical charge pump experiments in 2D
systems. A truly 4D Hall system has also been realized using electronic
circuits - however, no direct evidence of topological quantization has been
reported. Here, we engineer an atomic quantum Hall system evolving in 4D, by
coupling with light fields two spatial dimensions and two synthetic ones
encoded in the electronic spin $J = 8$ of dysprosium atoms. We measure the
characteristic properties of a 4D quantum Hall system, namely the quantization
of its electromagnetic non-linear response by a second Chern number, and the
special nature of its 3D hyperedge modes, which combine ballistic motion along
one orientation and insulating behaviour in the two remaining directions. We
also probe low-lying excitations, revealing non-planar cyclotron orbits in
contrast with their circular equivalents in $D\leq3$. Our findings pave the way
to the exploration of interacting quantum Hall systems in 4D, from the
investigation of strongly-correlated liquids to the simulation of high-energy
models in link with quantum gravity and Yang-Mills field theory.

In high temperature cuprate superconductors, it was found that the
superconducting transition temperature Tc depends on the number of CuO2 planes
(n) in the structural unit and the maximum Tc is realized in the trilayer
system (n=3). It was also found that the trilayer superconductors exhibit an
unusual phase diagram that Tc keeps nearly constant in the overdoped region
which is in strong contrast to the Tc decrease usually found in other cuprate
superconductors. The electronic origin of the Tc maximization in the trilayer
superconductors and its high Tc persistence in the overdoped region remains
unclear. By taking high resolution laser-based angle resolved photoemission
(ARPES) measurements, here we report our revelation of the microscopic origin
of the unusual superconducting properties in the trilayer superconductors. For
the first time we have observed the trilayer splitting in Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+d
(Bi2223) superconductor. The observed Fermi surface, band structures,
superconducting gap and the selective Bogoliubov band hybridizations can be
well described by a three-layer interaction model. Quantitative information of
the microscopic processes involving intra- and interlayer hoppings and pairings
are extracted. The electronic origin of the maximum Tc in Bi2223 and the
persistence of the high Tc in the overdoped region is revealed. These results
provide key insights in understanding high Tc superconductivity and pave a way
to further enhance Tc in the cuprate superconductors.

<h3>Charge Dimerization in Strongly Correlated Kagome Magnet FeGe</h3>

<br>
The intricate interplay between spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom
is the key for macroscopic quantum states, including high-temperature
superconductivity and quantum anomalous Hall effects. Recently, significant
interests have been focused on the kagome superconductor AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb,
Cs), where van Hove singularities near the Fermi level incorporate with lattice
instability triggering cascade symmetry-breaking orders. Lately, a strongly
correlated version of AV$_3$Sb$_5$ is realized in the kagome magnet FeGe. In
this material, a charge density wave (CDW) establishes deep in the A-type
antiferromagnetic phase and induces anomalous Hall effect. However, the role of
strong correlations and magnetism for the emergence of CDW is not fully
understood. Here, using hard x-ray diffraction and spectroscopy, we report an
experimental discovery of charge dimerization that coexists with the
2$\times$2$\times$1 CDW in FeGe. Combining with first principles calculations,
we show that the charge dimerization is stabilized by strong local Coulomb
interactions. Intriguingly, the formation of charge-dimerization enhances spin
polarization and is essential for the emergence of the 2$\times$2$\times$1 CDW
in the kagome-plane. Our results uncover an unconventional CDW mechanism in
correlated 3-dimensional metal and establish FeGe as a unique kagome-platform
hosting intertwined spin, charge, and lattice instabilities.

<h3>Wavefunction extreme value statistics in Anderson localization</h3>

<br>
We consider a disordered one-dimensional tight-binding model with power-law
decaying hopping amplitudes to disclose wavefunction maximum distributions
related to the Anderson localization phenomenon. Deeply in the regime of
extended states, the wavefunction intensities follow the Porter-Thomas
distribution while their maxima assume the Gumbel distribution. At the critical
point, distinct scaling laws govern the regimes of small and large wavefunction
intensities with a multifractal singularity spectrum. The distribution of
maxima deviates from the usual Gumbel form and some characteristic finite-size
scaling exponents are reported. Well within the localization regime, the
wavefunction intensity distribution is shown to develop a sequence of
pre-power-law, power-law, exponential and anomalous localized regimes. Their
values are strongly correlated, which significantly affects the emerging
extreme values distribution.

<h3>(La,Th)H$_{10}$: the potential high-$T_{c}$ superconductors stabilized  thermodynamically below 200 GPa</h3>

<br>
The recent high-pressure experimental discovery of superconductivity in
(La,Y)H$_{10}$, (La,Ce)H$_{9}$, (La,Ce)H$_{10}$, (Y,Ce)H$_{9}$, and
(La,Nd)H$_{10}$ shows that the ternary rare-earth clathrate hydride can be
promising candidate for high-temperature superconductor. In this work, we
theoretically demonstrate that the combination of actinide-metal thorium (Th)
and rare-earth-metal lanthanum (La) with hydrogen can also form some ternary
hydrides with cage-like structures to be stable at 200 GPa. Using the
evolutionary algorithms combined with the first-principles calculations, we
have predicted the pressure-dependent ternary phase diagram of
La$_{x}$Th$_{y}$H$_{z}$, particularly including the case of
(La$_{1-x}$Th$_{x}$)H$_{n}$ [or designated as (La,Th)H$_{n}$ for simplicity].
Our calculations show that the hydrogen-rich phases such as (La,Th)H$_{9}$
(only including $P\bar{6}m2$-LaThH$_{18}$) and (La,Th)H$_{10}$ (including
$I4/mmm$-La$_{3}$ThH$_{40}$, $R\bar{3}m$-LaThH$_{20}$, and
$I4/mmm$-LaTh$_{3}$H$_{40}$) with H$_{29}$ and H$_{32}$ cages can be
thermodynamically stable below 200 GPa. However, the phase decomposition can
happen to only (La,Th)H$_{9}$ when the pressure is above 150 GPa. More
importantly, the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) calculations show that the
(La,Th)H$_{10}$ series could the potential superconductors, of which
$I4/mmm$-La$_{3}$ThH$_{40}$ at 200 GPa exhibits the large EPC constant
$\lambda$ = 2.46 with a highest transition temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) of 210
K. Since there are few previous studies on ternary hydrides composed of
actinide metals, the present work would greatly stimulate the further discovery
of this type of ternary hydrides and provide useful guidance for the
high-pressure experimental studies on them.

<h3>Stacking-induced magnetic frustration and spiral spin liquid</h3>

<br>
Like the twisting control in magic angle twisted bilayer graphenes, the
stacking control is another mechanical approach to manipulate the fundamental
properties of solids, especially the van der Waals materials. We explore the
stacking-induced magnetic frustration and the spiral spin liquid on a
multilayer triangular lattice antiferromagnet where the system is built from
the ABC stacking with competing intralayer and interlayers couplings. By
combining the nematic bond theory and the self-consistent Gaussian
approximation, we establish the phase diagram for this ABC-stacked multilayer
magnet. It is shown that, the system supports a wide regime of spiral spin
liquid with multiple degenerate spiral lines in the reciprocal space,
separating the low-temperature spiral order and the high-temperature
featureless paramagnet. The transition to the spiral order from the spiral spin
liquid regime is first order. We further show that the spiral-spin-liquid
behavior persists even with small perturbations such as further neighbor
intralayer exchanges. The connection to the ABC-stacked magnets, the effects of
Ising or planar spin anisotropy, and the outlook on the stacking-engineered
quantum magnets are discussed.

<h3>Equilibrium States Corresponding to Targeted Hyperuniform Nonequilibrium  Pair Statistics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06446" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06446</a>
<br>
<i>Haina Wang, Salvatore Torquato</i>
<br>
The Zhang-Torquato conjecture [Phys. Rev. E 101, 032124 (2020)] states that
any realizable pair correlation function $g_2({\bf r})$ or structure factor
$S({\bf k})$ of a translationally invariant nonequilibrium system can be
attained by an equilibrium ensemble involving only (up to) effective two-body
interactions. To test this conjecture, we consider two singular nonequilibrium
models of recent interest that also have the exotic hyperuniformity property: a
2D "perfect glass" and a 3D critical absorbing-state model. We find that each
nonequilibrium target can be achieved accurately by equilibrium states with
effective one- and two-body potentials, lending further support to the
conjecture. To characterize the structural degeneracy of such
nonequilibrium-equilibrium correspondence, we compute higher-order statistics
for both models, as well as those for a hyperuniform 3D uniformly randomized
lattice (URL), whose higher-order statistics can be very precisely ascertained.
Interestingly, we find that the differences in the higher-order statistics
between nonequilibrium and equilibrium systems with matching pair statistics,
as measured by the "hole" probability distribution, provides measures of the
degree to which a system is out of equilibrium. We show that all three systems
studied possess the \textit{bounded-hole} property, and that holes near the
maximum hole size in the URL are much rarer than those in the underlying simple
cubic lattice. Remarkably, upon quenching, the effective potentials for all
three systems possess local energy minima with stronger forms of
hyperuniformity compared to their target counterparts. Our work is expected to
facilitate the self-assembly of tunable hyperuniform soft-matter systems.

Based on a chain of BBGKI equations with a modified boundary condition that
takes into account multiparticle correlations, kinetic equations in the
approximate "pairs" collisions and in the polarization approximation, taking
into account the interaction through the third particle, obtained. The
specifics of the model representation of the pair potential of particle
interaction through short-range and long-range parts were taken into account.
In the case of the short-range potential in the form of the potential of solid
spheres, the contribution of Enskog's revised theory to the complete
integration of the collision of the kinetic equation is obtained. The collision
integrals include paired quasi-equilibrium distribution functions that depend
on the nonequilibrium mean values of the particle number density and the
inverse temperature. The method of collective variables Yukhnovskii is applied
for the calculation of pair quasi-equilibrium distribution function with an
allocation of short-range and long-range parts in the potential of the
interaction of particles. In this case, the system with short-range interaction
is considered as a frame of reference.
