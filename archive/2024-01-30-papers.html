<h3>Near-field heat transfer and drag resistance in bilayers of composite  fermions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16477" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16477</a>
<br>
<i>Dmitry Zverevich, Alex Levchenko</i>
<p>Heat transfer is studied in the system of electron double layers of
correlated composite fermion quantum liquids. In the near-field regime, the
primary mechanism governing interlayer energy transfer is mediated by the
Coulomb interaction of thermally-driven charge density fluctuations. The
corresponding interlayer thermal conductance is computed across various
limiting cases of the composite fermion Chern-Simons gauge theory, encompassing
ballistic, diffusive, and hydrodynamic regimes. Plasmon enhancement of the heat
transfer is discussed. The relationship between the heat transfer conductance
and the drag resistance is presented for electron states formed in the
fractional quantum Hall effect of even denominator filling fractions.

<h3>Quantum Fragmentation in the Extended Quantum Breakdown Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16480" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16480</a>
<br>
<i>Bo-Ting Chen, Abhinav Prem, Nicolas Regnault, Biao Lian</i>
<p>We introduce a one-dimensional (1D) extended quantum breakdown model
comprising a fermionic and a spin degree of freedom per site, and featuring a
spatially asymmetric breakdown-type interaction between the fermions and spins.
We analytically show that, in the absence of any magnetic field for the spins,
the model exhibits Hilbert space fragmentation within each symmetry sector into
exponentially many Krylov subspaces and hence displays non-thermal dynamics.
Here, we demonstrate that the fragmentation naturally occurs in an entangled
basis and thus provides an example of "quantum fragmentation." Besides
establishing the nature of fragmentation analytically, we also study the
long-time behavior of the entanglement entropy and its deviation from the
expected Page value as a probe of ergodicity in the system. Upon introducing a
non-trivial magnetic field for the spins, most of the Krylov subspaces merge
and the model becomes chaotic. Finally, we study the effects of strong
randomness on the system and observe behavior similar to that of many-body
localized systems.

<h3>Optimization of scandium oxide growth by high pressure sputtering on  silicon</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16489" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16489</a>
<br>
<i>Pedro Carlos Feijoo, María Ángela Pampillón, Enrique San Andrés, María Luisa Lucía</i>
<p>This work demonstrates the viability of scandium oxide deposition on silicon
by means of high pressure sputtering. Deposition pressure and radio frequency
power are varied for optimization of the properties of the thin films and the
ScOx-Si interface. The physical characterization was performed by ellipsometry,
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction and transmission
electron microscopy. Aluminum gate electrodes were evaporated for
metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) fabrication. From the electrical
characterization of the MIS devices, the density of interfacial defects is
found to decrease with deposition pressure, showing a reduced plasma damage of
the substrate surface for higher pressures. This is also supported by lower
flatband voltage shifts in the capacitance versus voltage hysteresis curves.
Sputtering at high pressures (above 100 Pa) reduces the interfacial SiOx
formation, according to the infrared spectra. The growth rates decrease with
deposition pressure, so a very accurate control of the layer thicknesses could
be provided.

<h3>Optimization of gadolinium oxide growth deposited on Si by high pressure  sputtering</h3>

<br>
<i>Pedro Carlos Feijoo, María Ángela Pampillón, Enrique San Andrés</i>
<p>High k gadolinium oxide thin layers were deposited on silicon by
high-pressure sputtering (HPS). In order to optimize the properties for
microelectronic applications, different deposition conditions were used. Ti
(scavenger) and Pt (nonreactive) were e-beam evaporated to fabricate
metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) devices. According to x-ray diffraction,
x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy,
policrystaline stoichiometric Gd2O3 films were obtained by HPS. MIS with the
dielctric deposited at higher pressures also present lower flatband voltage
shifts in the C-V hysteris curves.

<h3>Towards metal electrode interface scavenging of rare-earth scandates: A  Sc2O3 and Gd2O3 study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16502" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16502</a>
<br>
<i>María Ángela Pampillón, Pedro Carlos Feijoo, Enrique San Andrés, María Toledano-Luque, Álvaro del Prado, Antonio Blázquez, María Luisa Lucía</i>
<p>AmorphousGd2O3 and Sc2O3 thin films were deposited on Si by high-pressure
sputtering (HPS). In order to reduce the uncontrolled interfacial SiOx growth,
firstly a metallic film of Gd or Sc was sputtered in pure Ar plasma.
Subsequently, they were in situ plasma oxidized in an Ar/O2 atmosphere. For
post-processing interfacial SiOx thickness reduction, three different top metal
electrodes were studied: platinum, aluminum and titanium. For both dielectrics,
it was found that Pt did not react with the films, while Al reacted with them
forming an aluminate-like interface and, finally, Ti was effective in
scavenging the SiO2 interface thickness without severely compromising gate
dielectric leakage.

<h3>Approach to Hyperuniformity of Steady States of Facilitated Exchange  Processes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16505" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16505</a>
<br>
<i>S. Goldstein, J. L. Lebowitz, E. R. Speer</i>
<p>We consider the fluctuations in the number of particles in a box of size L^d
in Z^d, d>=1, in the (infinite volume) translation invariant stationary states
of the facilitated exclusion process, also called the conserved lattice gas
model. When started in a Bernoulli (product) measure at density rho, these
systems approach, as t goes to infinity, a "frozen" state for rho<=rho_c, with
rho_c=1/2 for d=1 and rho_c<1/2 for d>=2. At rho=rho_c the limiting state is
hyperuniform, that is, the variance of the number of particles in the box grows
slower than L^d. We give a general description of how the variances at
different scales of L behave as rho increases to rho_c. On the largest scale,
L>>L_2, the fluctuations are normal (in fact the same as in the original
product measure), while in a region L_1<<L<<L_2, with both L_1 and L_2 going to
infinity as rho increases to rho_c, the variance grows faster than normal. For
1<<L<<L_1 the variance is the same as in the hyperuniform system. (All results
discussed are rigorous for d=1 and based on simulations for d>=2.)

<h3>Two-step conversion of metal and metal oxide precursor films to 2D  transition metal dichalcogenides and heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16513" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16513</a>
<br>
<i>Michael Altvater, Christopher Muratore, Michael Snure, Nicholas Glavin</i>
<p>From the laboratory to real-world applications, synthesis of two dimensional
(2D) materials requires modular techniques to control morphology, structure,
chemistry, and the plethora of exciting properties arising from these nanoscale
materials. In this review, we explore one of the many available synthesis
techniques; the extremely versatile two-step conversion (2SC) method. The 2SC
technique relies on deposition of a metal or metal oxide film, followed by
reaction with a chalcogen vapor at an elevated temperature, converting the
precursor film to a crystalline transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD). Herein,
we consider the variables at each step of the 2SC process including the impact
of the precursor film material and deposition technique, the influence of gas
composition and temperature during conversion, as well as other factors
controlling high quality 2D TMD synthesis. We feature the specific advantages
to the 2SC approach including deposition on diverse substrates, low temperature
processing, orientation control, and heterostructure synthesis, among others.
Finally, emergent opportunities that take advantage of the 2SC approach are
discussed to include next generation electronics, sensing, and optoelectronic
devices as well as catalysis for energy-related applications; spotlighting the
great potential of the 2SC technique.

<h3>Ultra-low glassy thermal conductivity and controllable, promising  thermoelectric properties in crystalline o-CsCu5S3</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16527" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16527</a>
<br>
<i>Jincheng Yue, Jiongzhi Zheng, Junda Li, Siqi Guo, Wenling Ren, Han Liu, Yanhui Liu, Tian Cui</i>
<p>We thoroughly investigate the microscopic mechanisms of the thermal transport
in orthorhombic \textit{o}-CsCu$_5$S$_3$ by integrating the
first-principles-based self-consistent phonon calculations (SCP) with the
linearized Wigner transport equation (LWTE). Our methodology takes into account
contributions to phonon energy shifts and phonon scattering rates from both
three- and four-phonon processes. Additionally, it incorporates the
off-diagonal terms of heat flux operators to calculate the total thermal
conductivity. The predicted $\kappa_\mathrm{L}$ with an extremely weak
temperature dependence following $\sim T^{-0.33}$, in good agreement with
experimental values along with the parallel to the Bridgman growth direction.
Such nonstandard temperature dependence of $\kappa_\mathrm{L}$ can be traced
back to the dual particlelike-wavelike behavior exhibited by thermal phonons.
Specifically, the coexistence of the stochastic oscillation of Cs atoms and
metavalent bonding among interlayer Cu-S atoms limits the particle-like phonon
propagation and enhances the wave-like tunneling of phonons. Simultaneously,
the electrical transport properties are determined by employing a precise
momentum relaxation-time approximation (MRTA) within the framework of the
linearized Boltzmann transport equation (LBTE). By properly adjusting the
carrier concentration, excellent thermoelectric performance is achieved, with a
maximum thermoelectric conversion efficiency of 18.4$\%$ observed at 800 K in
\textit{p}-type \textit{o}-CsCu$_5$S$_3$.} Our work not only elucidates the
anomalous thermal transport behavior in the copper-based chalcogenide
\textit{o}-CsCu$_5$S$_3$ but also provides insights for manipulating its
thermal and electronic properties for potential thermoelectric applications.

<p>Results are presented from several samples taken from leaves of the Pardon
Portico of Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba, where an alteration on their surface
was detected. Metal samples analyzed using X-ray microanalysis and powder x-ray
diffraction were predominantly constituted by copper with some amounts of zinc
attributed to brass, whereas other samples were also constituted by copper, tin
and lead attributed to bronze. Surface samples were analyzed using the same
techniques. In addition Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was also
used.The main compound identified in all the surface of the leaves is copper
chloride hydroxide (atacamite). Lead chlorides have also been found. These data
show that the sudden alteration that appears may be attributed to the use of
some cleaning product containing chloride. Other compounds detected in the
surface were gypsum, quartz and oxalates coming from environmental
contamination.

<h3>Stochastic Distinguishability of Markovian Trajectories</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16544" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16544</a>
<br>
<i>Asawari Pagare, Zhongmin Zhang, Jiming Zheng, Zhiyue Lu</i>
<p>The ability to distinguish between stochastic systems based on their
trajectories is crucial in thermodynamics, chemistry, and biophysics. The
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, $D_{\text{KL}}^{AB}(0,\tau)$, quantifies the
distinguishability between the two ensembles of length-$\tau$ trajectories from
Markov processes A and B. However, evaluating $D_{\text{KL}}^{AB}(0,\tau)$ from
histograms of trajectories faces sufficient sampling difficulties, and no
theory explicitly reveals what dynamical features contribute to the
distinguishability. This letter provides a general formula that decomposes
$D_{\text{KL}}^{AB}(0,\tau)$ in space and time for any Markov processes,
arbitrarily far from equilibrium or steady state. It circumvents the sampling
difficulty of evaluating $D_{\text{KL}}^{AB}(0,\tau)$. Furthermore, it
explicitly connects trajectory KL divergence with individual transition events
and their waiting time statistics. The results provide insights into
understanding distinguishability between Markov processes, leading to new
theoretical frameworks for designing biological sensors and optimizing signal
transduction.

<i>C. D. Rodriguez-Fernandez, E. Lopez Lago, C. Schroder, L. M. Varela</i>
<p>Electronic charge delocalization on the molecular backbones of ionic
liquid-forming ions substantially impacts their molecular polarizabilities.
Density functional theory calculations of polarizabilities and volumes of many
cations and anions are reported and applied to yield refractive indices of 1216
ionic liquids. A novel expression for the precise estimation of the molecular
volumes of the ionic liquids from simulation data is also introduced, adding
quadratic corrections to the usual sum of atomic volumes. Our significant
findings include i) that the usual assumption of uniform, additive atomic
polarizabilities is challenged when highly mobile electrons in conjugated
systems are present, and ii) that cations with conjugated large carbon chains
can be used together with anions for the design of ionic liquids with very high
refractive indices. A novel relation for the polarizability volume is reported
together with a refractive index map made up of the studied ionic liquids

<h3>Towards Accurate Prediction of Configurational Disorder Properties in  Materials using Graph Neural Networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16565" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16565</a>
<br>
<i>Zhenyao Fang, Qimin Yan</i>
<p>The prediction of configurational disorder properties, such as
configurational entropy and order-disorder phase transition temperature, of
compound materials relies on efficient and accurate evaluations of
configurational energies. Previous cluster expansion methods are not applicable
to configurationally-complex material systems, including those with atomic
distortions and long-range orders. In this work, we propose to leverage the
versatile expressive capabilities of graph neural networks (GNNs) for efficient
evaluations of configurational energies and present a workflow combining
attention-based GNNs and Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the disorder
properties. Using the dataset of face-centered tetragonal gold copper without
and with local atomic distortions as an example, we demonstrate that the
proposed data-driven framework enables the prediction of phase transition
temperatures close to experimental values. We also elucidate that the variance
of the energy deviations among configurations controls the prediction accuracy
of disorder properties and can be used as the target loss function when
training and selecting the GNN models. The work serves as a fundamental step
toward a new data-driven paradigm for the accelerated design of
configurationally-complex functional material systems.

<h3>Continuum excitations in a spin-supersolid on a triangular lattice</h3>

<p>Magnetic, thermodynamic, neutron diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering
are used to study spin correlations in the easy-axis XXZ triangular lattice
magnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$. Despite the presence of quasi-2D ``supersolid''
magnetic order, the low-energy excitation spectrum contains no sharp modes and
is instead a broad continuum resembling that of deconfined fractional
excitations. Applying a weak magnetic field drives the system into an $m$ = 1/3
fractional magnetization plateau phase where the excitations are sharp spin
waves.

<h3>A Loop-Opening Model for the Intrinsic Fracture Energy of Polymer  Networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16607" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16607</a>
<br>
<i>Shu Wang, Chase M. Hartquist, Bolei Deng, Xuanhe Zhao</i>
<p>We present a loop-opening model that accounts for the molecular details of
the intrinsic fracture energy for fracturing polymer networks. This model
includes not only the energy released from the scission of bridging chains but
also the subsequent energy released from the network continuum. Scission of a
bridging chain releases the crosslinks and opens the corresponding topological
loop. The released crosslinks will be caught by the opened loop to reach a new
force-balanced state. The amount of energy released from the network continuum
is limited by the stretchability of the opened loop. Based on this loop-opening
process, we suggest that the intrinsics fracture energy per broken chain
approximately scales with the product of the fracture force and the contour
length of the opened loop. This model predicts an intrinsic fracture energy
that aligns well with various experimental data on the fracture of polymer
networks.

<h3>Accelerating superconductor discovery through tempered deep learning of  the electron-phonon spectral function</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16611" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16611</a>
<br>
<i>Jason B. Gibson, Ajinkya C. Hire, Philip M. Dee, Oscar Barrera, Benjamin Geisler, Peter J. Hirschfeld, Richard G. Hennig</i>
<p>Integrating deep learning with the search for new electron-phonon
superconductors represents a burgeoning field of research, where the primary
challenge lies in the computational intensity of calculating the
electron-phonon spectral function, $\alpha^2F(\omega)$, the essential
ingredient of Midgal-Eliashberg theory of superconductivity. To overcome this
challenge, we adopt a two-step approach. First, we compute $\alpha^2F(\omega)$
for 818 dynamically stable materials. We then train a deep-learning model to
predict $\alpha^2F(\omega)$, using an unconventional training strategy to
temper the model's overfitting, enhancing predictions. Specifically, we train a
Bootstrapped Ensemble of Tempered Equivariant graph neural NETworks (BETE-NET),
obtaining an MAE of 0.21, 45 K, and 43 K for the Eliashberg moments derived
from $\alpha^2F(\omega)$: $\lambda$, $\omega_{\log}$, and $\omega_{2}$,
respectively, yielding an MAE of 2.5 K for the critical temperature, $T_c$.
Further, we incorporate domain knowledge of the site-projected phonon density
of states to impose inductive bias into the model's node attributes and enhance
predictions. This methodological innovation decreases the MAE to 0.18, 29 K,
and 28 K, respectively, yielding an MAE of 2.1 K for $T_c$. We illustrate the
practical application of our model in high-throughput screening for high-$T_c$
materials. The model demonstrates an average precision nearly five times higher
than random screening, highlighting the potential of ML in accelerating
superconductor discovery. BETE-NET accelerates the search for high-$T_c$
superconductors while setting a precedent for applying ML in materials
discovery, particularly when data is limited.

<h3>Ultrafast relaxation dynamics of excited carriers in metals: Simplifying  the intertwined dependencies upon scattering strengths, phonon temperature,  photon energy, and excitation level</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16621" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16621</a>
<br>
<i>D. M. Riffe, Richard B. Wilson</i>
<p>Using the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), we study the evolution of
nonequilibrium carrier distributions in simple ($sp$) metals, assumed to have
been instantaneously excited by an ultrafast laser pulse with photon energy $h
\nu$. The mathematical structure of the BTE scattering integrals reveals that
$h \nu$ is a natural energy scale for describing the dynamics. Normalizing all
energy quantities by $h \nu$ leads to a set of three unitless parameters --
$\beta / \delta$, $\gamma$, and $\alpha$ -- that control the relaxation
dynamics: $\beta / \delta$ is the normalized ratio of electron-phonon to
electron-electron scattering strengths, $\gamma$ is the normalized phonon
(lattice) temperature, and $\alpha$ is the normalized absorbed energy density.
Using this theory, we systematically investigate relaxation times for the
high-energy part of the distribution ($\tau_H$), energy transfer to the phonon
subsystem ($\tau_E$), and intracarrier thermalization ($\tau_{th}$). In the
linear region of response (valid when $\alpha$ is sufficiently small), we offer
heuristic descriptions of each of these relaxation times as functions of $\beta
/ \delta$ and $\gamma$. Our results as a function of excitation level $\alpha$
show that many ultrafast experimental investigations lie in a transition region
between low excitation (where the relaxation times are independent of $\alpha$)
and high excitation (where the two-temperature model of carrier dynamics is
valid). Approximate boundaries that separate these three regions are described
by simple expressions involving the normalized parameters of our model.

<h3>Canted antiferromagnetism in a spin-orbit coupled $S_{\text{eff}} = 3/2$  triangular-lattice magnet DyAuGe</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16622" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16622</a>
<br>
<i>Takashi Kurumaji, Masaki Gen, Shunsuke Kitou, Hajime Sagayama, Hironori Nakao, Taka-hisa Arima</i>
<p>Exploration of nontrivial magnetic states induced by strong spin-orbit
interaction is a central topic of frustrated magnetism. Extensive studies are
concentrated on rare-earth-based magnets and 4d/5d transition metal compounds,
which are mostly described by an effective spin $S_{\text{eff}} = 1/2$ for the
Kramers doublet of the lowest crystal-electric-field levels. Variety of
magnetic orderings may be greatly enhanced when magnetic dipolar moments
intertwined with multipolar degrees of freedom which are described by
higher-rank tensors and often require the magnetic ions with $S_{\text{eff}} >
1/2$. Here, our synchrotron x-ray diffraction near the Dy $L_3$ edge has
unveiled a canted antiferromagnetic ground state arising from a quasi-quartet
($S_{\text{eff}} = 3/2$) of 4f electrons in a triangular-lattice (TL)
rare-earth intermetallics DyAuGe. Magnetic moment and electric-quadrupole
moment are closely interlocked and noncollinear magnetic-dipole alignment is
induced by antiferroic electric-quadrupole (AFQ) ordering in the TL layers. The
correlation between the AFQ and canted magnetic structures is further confirmed
by phase transitions in an in-plane magnetic field. These findings offer
insights into the emergence of nontrivial magnetic states in frustrated TL
systems described beyond the $S_{\text{eff}} = 1/2$.

<h3>Layer group classification of two-dimensional materials</h3>

<br>
<i>Jingheng Fu, Mikael Kuisma, Ask Hjorth Larsen, Kohei Shinohara, Atsushi Togo, Kristian S. Thygesen</i>
<p>The symmetry of a crystal structure with a three-dimensional (3D) lattice can
be classified by one of the 230 space group types. For some types of crystals,
e.g. crystalline films, surfaces, or planar interfaces, it is more appropriate
to assume a 2D lattice. With this assumption, the structure can be classified
by one of the 80 layer group types. We have implemented an algorithm to
determine the layer group type of a 3D structure with a 2D lattice, and applied
it to more than 15,000 monolayer structures in the Computational 2D Materials
(C2DB) database. We compare the classification of monolayers by layer groups
and space groups, respectively. The latter is defined as the space group of the
3D bulk structure obtained by repeating the monolayer periodically in the
direction perpendicular to the 2D lattice (AA-stacking). By this
correspondence, nine pairs of layer group types are mapped to the same space
group type due to the inability of the space group to distinguish the in-plane
and out-of-plane axes. In total 18% of the monolayers in the C2DB belong to one
of these layer group pairs and are thus not properly classified by the space
group type.

<h3>Exceptional magnetic anomalies in TbIrIn5</h3>

<br>
<i>Ayusa Aparupa Biswal, Kartik K. Iyer, Kalobaran Maiti</i>
<p>We study the single crystal growth and the electronic properties of TbIrIn5.
The single crystals of TbIrIn5 were grown using the flux method. The analysis
of the x-ray diffraction pattern shows high-quality single crystals formed in a
tetragonal crystal structure. A trace of In-flux was also found in the data.
Temperature and field-dependent magnetic measurements exhibit strong anisotropy
and antiferromagnetic ordering with a Neel temperature of 43.2 K. The estimated
Tb-moment from the data in the paramagnetic regime is found to be close to its
free ion value. Interestingly, a strong diamagnetic behaviour and sharp
resistivity drop typical of the superconducting phase is observed below 2.6 K
which may have a link to the trace of indium present in the system. Further
studies are required to ascertain this finding.

<h3>Evidence of electron correlation and unusual spectral evolution in an  exotic superconductor, PdTe</h3>

<br>
<i>Ram Prakash Pandeya, Arindam Pramanik, Pramita Mishra, Indranil Sarkar, A. Thamizhavel, Kalobaran Maiti</i>
<p>We study the electronic structure of an exotic superconductor, PdTe employing
depth-resolved high resolution photoemission spectroscopy and density
functional theory. The valence band spectra exhibit large density of states at
the Fermi level with flat intensity in a wide energy range indicating highly
metallic ground state. The Pd 4d-Te 5p hybridization is found to be strong
leading to a highly covalent character of the itinerant states. Core level
spectra exhibit several features including the signature of plasmon
excitations. Although the radial extension of the 4d orbitals is larger than 3d
ones, the Pd core level spectra exhibit distinct satellites indicating
importance of electron correlation in the electronic structure which may be a
reason for unconventional superconductivity observed in this system. The
depth-resolved data reveal surface peaks at higher binding energies in both, Te
and Pd core level spectra. Interestingly, core level shift in Te-case is
significantly large compared to Pd although Te is relatively more
electronegative. Detailed analysis rules out applicability of the charge
transfer and/or band-narrowing models to capture this scenario. This unusual
scenario is attributed to the reconstruction and/or vacancies at the surface.
These results reveal the importance of electron correlation and surface
topology for the physics of this material exhibiting Dirac fermions and complex
superconductivity.

<h3>Unexpected linear conductivity in Landau-Zener model: limitations and  improvements of the relaxation time approximation in the quantum master  equation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16728" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16728</a>
<br>
<i>Ibuki Terada, Sota Kitamura, Hiroshi Watanabe, Hiroaki Ikeda</i>
<p>The nonequilibrium steady states of quantum materials have many challenges.
Here, we highlight issues with the relaxation time approximation (RTA) for the
DC conductivity in insulating systems. The RTA to the quantum master equation
(QME) is frequently employed as a simple method, yet this phenomenological
approach is exposed as a fatal approximation, displaying metallic DC
conductivity in insulating systems within the linear response regime. We find
that the unexpected metallic behavior is caused by the fact that the density
matrix in the RTA incompletely incorporates the first order of the external
field. To solve this problem, we have derived a new calculation scheme based on
the QME that ensure correct behavior in low electric fields. Our method
reproduces well the overall features of the exact electric currents in the
whole field region. It is not time-consuming, and its application to lattice
systems is straightforward. This method will encourage progress in this
research area as a simple way to more accurately describe nonequilibrium steady
states.

<p>Surfaces (interfaces) dictate many physical and chemical properties of solid
materials and adsorbates considerably affect these properties. Nitrogen
molecules, which are the most abundant constituent in ambient air, are
considered to be inert. Our study combining atomic force microscopy (AFM),
X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), and thermal desorption spectroscopy
(TDS) revealed that nitrogen and water molecules can self-assemble into
two-dimensional domains, forming ordered stripe structures on graphitic
surfaces in both water and ambient air. The stripe structures of this study
were composed of approximately 90% and 10% water and nitrogen molecules,
respectively, and survived in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions at
temperatures up to approximately 350 K. Because pure water molecules completely
desorb from graphitic surfaces in a UHV at temperatures lower than 200 K, our
results indicate that the incorporation of nitrogen molecules substantially
enhanced the stability of the crystalline water hydrogen bonding network.
Additional studies on interfacial gas hydrates can provide deeper insight into
the mechanisms underlying formation of gas hydrates.

<h3>Heavy-fermions in frustrated Hund's metal with portions of incipient  flat-bands</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16770" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16770</a>
<br>
<i>Yilin Wang</i>
<p>Flat-bands induced by destructive interference of hoppings in frustrated
lattices such as kagome metals, have been extensively studied in recent years
since they may lead to strongly correlated phenomena. However, in realistic
multiorbital $d$-electron materials, such flat-bands usually appear in small
portions of Brillouin zone and are away from Fermi level (dubbed as
``incipient"). Whether such incipient flat-band portions can induce very strong
electron correlations is an open question. Here, by density functional theory
plus dynamical mean-field theory calculations on the superconducting kagome
CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ and triangular CrB$_2$, we show that the roles of such incipient
flat-bands in driving electron correlations can be significantly amplified by
Hund's coupling $J_{\text{H}}$ in a Hund's metal. As a result, even moderately
$d$-electron heavy-fermions could be induced by enhancing the orbital
differentiation and Kondo-like effect of Hund's metals. This provides a
flexible route for generating $d$-electron heavy-fermion, and for controllably
inducing electron correlations and magnetic fluctuations suitable for emergence
of unconventional superconductivity, in frustrated Hund's metals with portions
of incipient flat-bands.

<h3>Simulation of the formation of patterned polymer films: using composite  substrates in evaporative lithography</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16794" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16794</a>
<br>
<i>Konstantin Kolegov</i>
<p>The continuing development of evaporative lithography is important for many
areas such as the creation of photonic crystals for optronics and
microelectronics, the development of biosensors for medical applications and
biotechnology, and for the formation of functional coatings for nanotechnology,
including the application of thin, protective polymer coatings. The article
proposes a mathematical model that allows us to explain the basic mechanisms of
the formation of thin polymer films (less than 50~$\mu$m thick) during their
deposition onto a composite substrate by methanol evaporation from a solution.
If the thermal conductivity of the substrate is spatially non-uniform, this
results in inhomogeneous evaporation along the free film surface. Therefore, as
the film dries, a patterned polymer coating is left behind on the substrate.
The mathematical model described here is based on the lubrication approximation
and takes into account the dependence of the solution density on the
concentration. The numerical computation results are in qualitative agreement
with the experimental data of other authors. The article shows that solutal
Marangoni flow plays a primary role in the process under consideration. This
study allows us to better understand the mechanisms that can be used in
evaporative lithography.

<h3>Accurate and efficient prediction of the band gaps and optical spectra  of chalcopyrite semiconductors from a non-empirical range-separated  dielectric-dependent hybrid: Comparison with many-body perturbation theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16805" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16805</a>
<br>
<i>Arghya Ghosh, Subrata Jana, Dimple Rani, Manoar Hossain, Manish K Niranjan, Prasanjit Samal</i>
<p>The accurate prediction of electronic and optical properties in chalcopyrite
semiconductors has been a persistent challenge for density functional theory
(DFT) based approaches. Addressing this issue, we demonstrate that very
accurate results can be obtained using a non-empirical screened
dielectric-dependent hybrid (DDH) functional. This novel approach showcases its
impressive capability to accurately determine band gaps, optical bowing
parameters, and optical absorption spectra for chalcopyrite systems. What sets
the screened DDH functional apart is its adeptness in capturing the many-body
physics associated with highly localized $d$ electrons. Notably, the accuracy
is comparable to the many-body perturbation based methods (such as $G_0W_0$ or
its various approximations for band gaps and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) on
the top of the $G_0W_0$ or its various approximations for optical spectra) with
less computational cost, ensuring a more accessible application across various
research domains. The present results show the predictive power of the screened
DDH functional, pointing toward promising applications where computational
efficiency and predictive accuracy are crucial considerations. Overall, the
screened DDH functional offers a compelling balance between cost-effectiveness
and precision, making it a valuable tool for future endeavors in exploring
chalcopyrite semiconductors and beyond.

<h3>Vanadium-Doped Molybdenum Disulfide Monolayers with Tunable Electronic  and Magnetic Properties: Do Vanadium-Vacancy Pairs Matter?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16806" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16806</a>

<i>Da Zhou, Yen Thi Hai Pham, Diem Thi-Xuan Dang, David Sanchez, Aaryan Oberoi, Ke Wang, Andres Fest, Alexander Sredenschek, Mingzu Liu, Humberto Terrones, Saptarshi Das, Dai-Nam Le, Lilia M. Woods, Manh-Huong Phan, Mauricio Terrones</i>
<p>Monolayers of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) are the most studied
two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), due to its
exceptional optical, electronic, and opto-electronic properties. Recent studies
have shown the possibility of incorporating a small amount of magnetic
transition metals (e.g., Fe, Co, Mn, V) into MoS2 to form a 2D dilute magnetic
semiconductor (2D-DMS). However, the origin of the observed ferromagnetism has
remained elusive, due to the presence of randomly generated sulfur vacancies
during synthesis that can pair with magnetic dopants to form complex
dopant-vacancy configurations altering the magnetic order induced by the
dopants. By combining high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission
electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) imaging with first-principles density
functional theory (DFT) calculations and magnetometry data, we demonstrate the
critical effects of sulfur vacancies and their pairings with vanadium atoms on
the magnetic ordering in V-doped MoS2 (V-MoS2) monolayers. Additionally, we
fabricated a series of field effect transistors on these V-MoS2 monolayers and
observed the emergence of p-type behavior as the vanadium concentration
increased. Our study sheds light on the origin of ferromagnetism in V-MoS2
monolayers and provides a foundation for future research on defect engineering
to tune the electronic and magnetic properties of atomically thin TMD-based
DMSs.

<h3>Emerging two-dimensional conductivity at Mott-band insulator interface</h3>

<i>I. V. Maznichenko, S. Ostanin, D. Maryenko, V. K. Dugaev, E. Ya. Sherman, P. Buczek, I. Mertig, M. Kawasaki, A. Ernst</i>
<p>Intriguingly conducting perovskite interfaces between ordinary band
insulators are widely explored, whereas similar interfaces with Mott insulators
are still not quite understood. Here we address the (001), (110), and (111)
interfaces between the LaTiO$_{3}$ Mott- and large band gap KTaO$_{3}$
insulators. Based on first-principles calculations, we reveal a mechanism of
interfacial conductivity, which is distinct from a formerly studied one
applicable to interfaces between polar wide band insulators. Here the key
factor causing conductivity is the matching of oxygen octahedra tilting in
KTaO$_{3}$ and LaTiO$_{3}$ which, due to a small gap in the LaTiO$_{3}$ results
in its sensitivity to the crystal structure, yields metalization of its
overlayer and following charge transfer from Ti to Ta. Our findings, also
applicable to other Mott insulators interfaces, shed light on the emergence of
conductivity observed in LaTiO$_{3}$/KTaO$_{3}$~(110) where the ''polar``
arguments are not applicable and on the emergence of superconductivity in these
structures.

<h3>Intermittent random walks under stochastic resetting</h3>

<br>
<i>Rosa Flaquer-Galmés, Daniel Campos, Vicenç Méndez</i>
<p>We analyze a one-dimensional intermittent random walk on an unbounded domain
in the presence of stochastic resetting. In this process, the walker alternates
between local intensive search, diffusion, and rapid ballistic relocations in
which it does not react to the target. We demonstrate that Poissonian resetting
leads to the existence of a non-equilibrium steady state. We calculate the
distribution of the first arrival time to a target along with its mean and show
the existence of an optimal reset rate. In particular, we prove that the
initial condition of the walker, i.e., either starting diffusely or relocating,
can significantly affect the long-time properties of the search process.
Moreover, we demonstrate the presence of distinct parameter regimes for the
global optimization of the mean first arrival time when ballistic and diffusive
movements are in direct competition.

<h3>Modelling the non-steady peeling of viscoelastic tapes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16851" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16851</a>
<br>
<i>M. Ceglie, N. Menga, G. Carbone</i>
<p>We present a model to study the non-steady V-shaped peeling of a viscoelastic
thin tape adhering to a rigid flat substrate. Geometry evolution and
viscoelastic creep in the tape are the main features involved in the process,
which allows to derive specific governing equations in the framework of energy
balance. Finally, these are numerically integrated following an iterative
scheme to calculate the process evolution assuming different controlling
conditions (peeling front velocity, peeling force, tape tip velocity). Results
show that the peeling behavior is strongly affected by viscoelasticity.
Specifically, for a given applied force, the peeling can either be prevented,
start and stop after some while, or endlessly propagate, depending on the
original undeformed tape geometry. Viscoelasticity also entails that the
interface toughness strongly increases when the tape tip is fast pulled, which
agrees to recent experimental observations on tougher adhesion of natural
systems under impact loads, such as see waves and wind gusts.

<h3>Line tension in a thick soap film</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16859" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16859</a>
<br>
<i>Théo Lenavetier, Gaëlle Audéoud, Marion Berry, Anaïs Gauthier, Raphael Poryles, C. Tregouet, Isabelle Cantat</i>
<p>The thickness of freshly made soap films is usually in the micron range, and
interference colors make thickness fluctuations easily visible. Circular
patterns of constant thickness are commonly observed, either a thin film disc
in a thicker film or the reverse. In this Letter, we evidence the line tension
at the origin of these circular patterns. Using a well controlled soap film
preparation, we produce a piece of thin film surrounded by a thicker film. The
thickness profile, measured with a spectral camera, leads to a line tension of
the order of 0.1 nN which drives the relaxation of the thin film shape,
initially very elongated, toward a circular shape.A balance between line
tension and air friction leads to a quantitative prediction of the relaxation
process. Such a line tension is expected to play a role in the production of
marginal regeneration patches, involved in soap film drainage and stability.

<h3>Quasicondensation and off-diagonal long-range order of hard-core bosons  during a free expansion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16860" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16860</a>
<br>
<i>A. Takács, S. Scopa, P. Calabrese, L. Vidmar, J. Dubail</i>
<p>Quasicondensation in one dimension is known to occur for equilibrium systems
of hard-core bosons (HCBs) at zero temperature. This phenomenon arises due to
the off-diagonal long-range order in the ground state, characterized by a
power-law decay of the one-particle density matrix $g_1(x,y)\sim
|x-y|^{-1/2}$~--~a well-known outcome of Luttinger liquid theory. Remarkably,
HCBs, when allowed to freely expand from an initial product state (i.e.,
characterized by initial zero correlation), exhibit quasicondensation and
demonstrate the emergence of off-diagonal long-range order during
nonequilibrium dynamics. This phenomenon has been substantiated by numerical
and experimental investigations in the early 2000s. In this work, we revisit
the dynamical quasicondensation of HCBs, providing a fully analytical treatment
of the issue. In particular, we derive an exact asymptotic formula for the
equal-time one-particle density matrix by borrowing ideas from the framework of
quantum Generalized Hydrodynamics. Our findings elucidate the phenomenology of
quasicondensation and of dynamical fermionization occurring at different stages
of the time evolution, as well as the crossover between the two.

<h3>Observation of dielectrically confined excitons in ultrathin GaN  nanowires up to room temperature</h3>

<p>The realization of semiconductor structures with stable excitons at room
temperature is crucial for the development of excitonics and polaritonics.
Quantum confinement has commonly been employed for enhancing excitonic effects
in semiconductor heterostructures. Dielectric confinement, which is potentially
much stronger, has proven to be more difficult to achieve because of the rapid
nonradiative surface/interface recombination in hybrid dielectric-semiconductor
structures. Here, we demonstrate intense excitonic emission from bare GaN
nanowires with diameters down to 6 nm. The large dielectric mismatch between
the nanowires and vacuum greatly enhances the Coulomb interaction, with the
thinnest nanowires showing the strongest dielectric confinement and the highest
radiative efficiency at room temperature. In situ monitoring of the fabrication
of these structures allows one to accurately control the degree of dielectric
enhancement. These ultrathin nanowires may constitute the basis for the
fabrication of advanced low-dimensional structures with an unprecedented degree
of confinement.

<p>We demonstrate an all-epitaxial and scalable growth approach to fabricate
single-crystalline GaN nanowires on graphene by plasma-assisted molecular beam
epitaxy. As substrate, we explore several types of epitaxial graphene layer
structures synthesized on SiC. The different structures differ mainly in their
total number of graphene layers. Because graphene is found to be etched under
active N exposure, the direct growth of GaN nanowires on graphene is only
achieved on multilayer graphene structures. The analysis of the nanowire
ensembles prepared on multilayer graphene by Raman spectroscopy and
transmission electron microscopy reveals the presence of graphene underneath as
well as in between nanowires, as desired for the use of this material as
contact layer in nanowire-based devices. The nanowires nucleate preferentially
at step edges, are vertical, well aligned, epitaxial, and of comparable
structural quality as similar structures fabricated on conventional substrates.

<h3>Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction as an infinite-range Penson-Kolb  pairing mechanism</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16877" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16877</a>
<br>
<i>Francesco Romeo, Alfonso Maiellaro</i>
<p>We demonstrate that the well-known $(k\uparrow, -k\downarrow)$
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction, when considered in real space, is
equivalent to an infinite-range Penson-Kolb pairing mechanism coexisting with
an attractive Hubbard term. Driven by this discovery and aiming at exploring
the conduction properties, we investigate the dynamics of fermionic particles
confined in a ring-shaped lattice. We assume that fermions are simultaneously
influenced by the pairing interaction and by an Aharonov-Bohm electromagnetic
phase, which is incorporated into the model in a highly non-trivial manner.
Remarkably, the aforementioned model shows Richardson integrability for both
integer and half-integer values of the applied magnetic flux $\Phi/\Phi_0$,
thus permitting the exact solution of a genuine many-body problem. We discuss
the ground state properties of both two-particle and many-particle systems,
drawing comparisons with results from the attractive Hubbard model. Our
approach combines exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group
techniques, and numerical solution of the Richardson equations. This
comprehensive analysis allows us to study various key metrics, including the
system's conductivity as a function of the interaction strength. In this way,
the BCS-BEC transition is investigated in a continuous manner, thus permitting
to shed light on fundamental aspects of superconducting pairing. Our findings
can be experimentally tested in a condensed matter context or, with greater
level of control, using \textit{atomtronics} platforms.

<h3>Collective quantum stochastic resonance in Rydberg atoms</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16894" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16894</a>
<br>
<i>Haowei Li, Konghao Sun, Wei Yi</i>
<p>We study the collective response of a group of dissipative Rydberg atoms to a
periodic modulation of the Rydberg excitation laser. Focusing on the emergent
collective-jump dynamics, where the system stochastically switches between
states with distinct Rydberg excitations, we show that the counting statistics
of the state switching is qualitatively changed by the periodic drive. The
impact is most prominent when the driving frequency is comparable to the
emergent collective-jump rate, as the jumps tend to synchronize with the
external drive, and their counting statistics exhibits a series of suppressed
subharmonics of the driving frequency. These phenomena are manifestations of a
novel type of stochastic resonance, where a cooperative collective state
switching is facilitated by quantum fluctuations in a many-body open system.
Such a collective quantum stochastic resonance further leads to an enhanced
signal-to-noise ratio in the power spectrum of the Rydberg excitations, for
which the synchronized collective jumps are viewed as the output signal. We
confirm the many-body quantum nature of the resonance by devising a cluster
model, under which the role of many-body correlations is analyzed by changing
the size of the atom clusters.

<h3>Exploring the giant dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect in massless Dirac  materials</h3>

<i>Youngjae Kim</i>
<p>The dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect, indicative of the transient light-matter
interaction regime between quantum and classical realms, is widely recognized
as an essential signature in wide bandgap condensed matter systems such as
dielectrics. In this study, we applied the time-resolved transient absorption
spectroscopy to investigate ultrafast optical responses in graphene, a
zero-bandgap system. We observed in the gate-tuned graphene that the massless
Dirac materials notably enhance intraband light-driven transitions,
significantly leading to the giant dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect compared to
the massive Dirac materials, a wide bandgap system. In addition, employing the
angle-resolved spectroscopy, it is found that the perpendicular polarization
orientation for the pump and the probe further pronounces the optical spectra
to exhibit the complete fishbone structure, reflecting the unique pseudospin
nature of Dirac cones. Our findings expand the establishment of emergent
transient spectroscopy frameworks into not only zero-bandgap systems but also
pseudospin-mediated quantum phenomena, moving beyond dielectrics.

<br>
<i>Xiaohanwen Lin, Fan Wu, Sara A. Lopéz-Paz, Fabian O. von Rohr, Marco Gibertini, Ignacio Gutiérrez-Lezama, Alberto F. Morpurgo</i>
<p>We investigate the c-direction conduction in CrSBr in the linear regime, not
accessible in other van der Waals (vdW) magnetic semiconductors, because of the
unmeasurably low current. The resistivity -- $10^8$ to $10^{11}$ times larger
than in the a- and b-directions -- exhibits magnetic state dependent thermally
activated and variable range hopping transport. In the spin-flip phase at 2 T,
the activation energy is 20 meV lower than in the antiferromagnetic state, due
to a downshift of the conduction band edge, in agreement with ab-initio
calculations. In the variable range hopping regime, the average hopping length
decreases from twice the interlayer distance to the interlayer distance at 2 T,
because in the antiferromagnetic state the large exchange energy impedes
electrons hopping between adjacent layers. Our work demonstrates that the
linear transport regime provides new information about electronic processes in
vdW magnetic semiconductors, and shows how magnetism influences these processes
both in real and reciprocal space.

<p>Proximity effect at superconductor/antiferromagnet (S/AF) interfaces, which
manifests itself as generation of Neel-type triplet correlations, leads to
sensitivity of the superconducting critical temperature to the mutual
orientation of the AF Neel vectors in AF/S/AF trilayers, which is called the
spin-valve effect. Here we predict that the spin-valve effect in AF/S/AF
heterostructures crucially depends on the value of the chemical potential of
the superconducting interlayer due to the occurrence of the finite-momentum
Neel triplet correlations. In addition we investigate equal-spin triplet
correlations, which appear in AF/S/AF structures for non-aligned Neel vectors
of the AFs, and their role in the nonmonotonic dependence of the
superconducting critical temperature of the AF/S/AF structure on the mutual
orientation of the AF Neel vectors. The influence of impurities on the
spin-valve effect is also investigated.

<p>The onset of nonequilibrium in a driven Anderson-insulator is identified by
monitoring the system with two-thermometers. Features of nonequilibrium appear
at surprisingly weak drive intensity demonstrating, among other things, that
conductivity may not be a reliable thermometer for ensuring linear-response
conditions. In addition, the spectral contents of the applied field could be
more important to take the system out of equilibrium than its absorbed power.
Ensuing hot-electron transport effects and the nontrivial role phonons play in
driven quantum systems are pointed out.

variation, the localization of charge carriers, and the optical transitions.
The results for a typical antimony-containing III-V alloy, GaAsSb, show that
the new scheme greatly improves the accuracy in reproducing the experimental
alloy band gaps compared to other widely used schemes. The atomistic nature of
the empirical tight-binding approach paired with a reliable parameterization
enables more detailed physical insights into the effects of disorder in alloyed
materials.

<p>We present a combined growth and transport study of superconducting
single-crystalline NdO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_2$. Evidence of two-dimensional
superconductivity with significant phase fluctuations of preformed Cooper pairs
preceding the superconducting transition is reported. This result is based on
three key observations. (1) The resistive superconducting transition
temperature $T_c$ (defined by resistivity $\rho \rightarrow 0$) increases with
increasing disorder. (2) As $T\rightarrow T_c$, the conductivity diverges
significantly faster than what is expected from Gaussian fluctuations in two
and three dimensions. (3) Non-Ohmic resistance behavior is observed in the
superconducting state. Altogether, our observations are consistent with a
temperature regime of phase-fluctuating superconductivity. The crystal
structure with magnetic ordering tendencies in the NdO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$ layers
and (super)conductivity in the BiS$_2$ layers is likely responsible for the
two-dimensional phase fluctuations. As such, NdO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_2$ falls
into the class of unconventional ``laminar" bulk superconductors that include
cuprate materials and 4Hb-TaS$_2$.

<i>Wen Jin, Xinlu Li, Gaojie Zhang, Hao Wu, Xiaokun Wen, Li Yang, Jie Yu, Bichen Xiao, Wenfeng Zhang, Jia Zhang, Haixin Chang</i>
<p>Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) have been widely applied in spintronic
devices for efficient spin detection through the imbalance of spin polarization
at the Fermi level. The van der Waals (vdW) nature of two-dimensional (2D)
magnets with atomic-scale flat surfaces and negligible surface roughness
greatly facilitates the development of MTJs, yet is only restricted to
ferromagnets. Here, we report A-type antiferromagnetism in 2D vdW
single-crystal (Fe0.8Co0.2)3GaTe2 with TN~203 K in bulk and ~185 K in 9-nm
nanosheets. The metallic nature and out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy make it a
suitable candidate for MTJ electrodes. By constructing heterostructures based
on (Fe0.8Co0.2)3GaTe2/WSe2/Fe3GaTe2, we obtain a large tunneling
magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of 180% at low temperature and the TMR retains at
near-room temperature 280 K. Moreover, the TMR is tunable by the electric field
down to 1 mV, implying the potential in energy-efficient spintronic devices.
Our work provides new opportunities for 2D antiferromagnetic spintronics and
quantum devices.

<p>We investigate the anomalous photo-induced band renormalization in correlated
materials, exemplified by the case of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$. The manifestation of this
anomaly is characterized by the alternating direction of band shift in response
to changes in the laser parameters or electron momentum. We attribute the
phenomena to the band inversion of the material and the selective excitation of
a high-lying flat band, leading to the competition between the Hartree shift
and the order collapse. These findings are based on {\it ab initio} determined
effective model for Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, in which we incorporate high-lying states
and the time-dependent GW simulation to follow the non-equilibrium dynamics
induced by the laser. Our findings reveal the sensitivity of the
non-equilibrium electronic dynamics to the band structure and laser protocols,
providing valuable guidance for the selection of suitable materials and lasers
in the engineering of band structures.

<p>Hybrid elastic and spin waves hold promises for energy-efficient and
versatile generation and detection of magnetic signals, with potentially long
coherence times. Here we report on the combined elastic and magnetic dynamics
in a one-dimensional magneto-mechanical crystal composed of an array of
magnetic nanowires. Phononic and magnonic modes are impulsively excited by an
optical ultrafast trigger and their decay is monitored by time resolved Magneto
Optical Kerr Effect, with complementary Brillouin Light Scattering measurements
and micromagnetic simulations. The strength and degree of mixing of coherent
and dissipative coupling of the quasi-particles is determined quantitatively.

<p>Understanding the nature of the photoexcitation and ultrafast charge dynamics
pathways in organic halide perovskite superlattices is key for their potential
applications as tunable light emitters, photon harvesting materials and
light-amplification systems. In this work we apply two-dimensional coherent
electronic spectroscopy (2DES) to track in real time the formation of
near-infrared optical excitons and their ultrafast decay into bi-excitons in
CH(NH2)2PbI3 nanocube superlattices. On the picosecond timescale, the strong
coupling between localized charges and specific lattice distortions leads to
the progressive formation of long-lived localized trap states. The analysis of
the temperature dependence of the excitonic intrinsic linewidth, as extracted
by the anti-diagonal components of the 2D spectra, unveils a dramatic change of
the excitonic coherence time across the cubic to tetragonal structural
transition. Our results offer a new way to control and enhance the ultrafast
coherent dynamics of photocarrier generation in hybrid halide perovskite
synthetic solids.

<p>We investigate a generalized interpolating Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Fibonacci (IAAF)
model with p-wave superconducting pairing. In the Aubry-Andr\'{e} limit, we
demonstrate that the system experiences transitions from a pure phase, either
extended or critical, to a variety of intermediate phases and ultimately enters
a localized phase with increasing potential strength. These intermediate phases
include those with coexisting extended and localized states, extended and
critical states, localized and critical states and a mix of extended, critical
and localized states. Each intermediate phase exhibits at least one type of
mobility edge separating different states. As the system approaches the
Fibonacci limit, both the extended and localized phases diminish, and the
system tends towards a critical phase.

<p>Second order perturbation solutions of profiles of bubbles suspended in
liquid and liquid gas interfaces when liquid all sinks in the bottom under
different accelerations are derived. Six procedures are developed based on
these solutions, and they are divided into two types. One takes coordinates of
endpoints of profiles as inputs, and the other takes liquid volume or gas
volume as inputs. Numerical simulation are performed with the Volume of Fluid
method and numerical results are in good agreement with predictions of these
procedures. Besides, the bigger the acceleration, the more flatter the bubble
will be until all liquid sinks to the bottom. Effects of accelerations on
bubbles shape must be considered. When liquid all sinks to the bottom,
predictions of liquid volume with the same liquid meniscus height as inputs
differs a lot under different accelerations. The most significant change of
liquid volume is when Bond is much smaller than 1. Effects of accelerations and
liquid contact angle on liquid gas interfaces must be considered during
evaluating liquid residue, and these findings will be great helpful for liquid
residue measurement and fine management in space.

<h3>Coupling strongly correlated electron systems to a tunable electronic  reservoir</h3>

<br>
<i>S. Bag, L. Fratino, A Camjayi, M. Civelli, M. Rozenberg</i>
<p>We study the effect of coupling an electronic reservoir to a Hubbard model
and to a Dimer Hubbard Model.
This is motivated by recent experiments on the effect of illumination on the
insulator-metal transition in a vanadium oxides and photo-conductive cadmium
sulfide heterostructure. We model the system as an electronic reservoir
hybridized to the correlated system. We assume that the light intensity
controls the hybridization coupling strength. We find that the light intensity
acts similarly as the temperature in the weak interaction regime. This is
consistent with the role played by electronic reservoirs in out-of-equilibrium
systems. In contrast, qualitative differences appear at strong coupling. We
show that modeling the V$_2$O$_3$ compound with a Hubbard model, our results
describe qualitatively well the observed illumination-driven suppression of the
insulator-metal transition. In contrast, in the DHM results fail to capture the
mild suppression observed in the case of VO$_2$. This indicates that the
lattice may play an important role in this case.

<p>Hybridization between the localized f-electrons and the delocalized
conduction electrons together with the crystal electric field (CEF) play a
determinant role in governing the many-body ground state of a
correlated-electron system. Here, we investigate the low-energy CEF states in
CeAg_2Ge_2, a prototype Kondo-lattice antiferromagnet where Kondo correlation
is found to exist within the antiferromagnetic phase. Using time-domain THz
reflection spectroscopy, we show the first direct evidence of two low-energy
CEF transitions at 0.6 THz (2.5 meV) and 2.1 THz (8.7 meV). The presence of
low-frequency infrared-active phonon modes further manifests as a Fano-modified
lineshape of the 2.1 THz CEF conductivity peak. The temporal spectral weights
obtained directly from the THz time traces, in addition, corroborate the
corresponding CEF temperature scales of the compound.

<p>Exploring high-temperature superconducting (high-$T_c$) material at ambient

Ca, Ga, Rb, Sr, and In; M are $3d$, $4d$, and $5d$ transition metals). These

screening calculations suggest that 26 compounds exhibit dynamic stability and
strong electron-phonon coupling. Among these 26 compounds, Mg$_2$RhH$_6$,
Mg$_2$IrH$_6$, Al$_2$MnH$_6$, and Li$_2$CuH$_6$ show promising energetic
stability and $T_c$ of more than 50 K at ambient pressure. This study

<h3>Condensates Breaking Up Under Rotation</h3>

<p>The ground state of a rotating Bose-Einstein condensate trapped in a
two-dimensional anharmonic--anisotropic potential is analyzed numerically at
the limit of an infinite number of particles. We find that the density breaks
up along the $x$ direction in position space and along the $p_y$ direction in
momentum space together with the acquisition of angular momentum. Side by side,
the anisotropies of the many-particle position variances along the $x$ and $y$
directions and of the many-particle momentum variances along the $p_y$ and
$p_x$ directions become opposite when computed at the many-body and mean-field
levels of theory. All in all, the rotating bosons are found to possess unique
correlations at the limit of an infinite number of particles, both in position
and momentum spaces, although their many-body and mean-field energies per
particle and densities per particle coincide and the condensate fraction is
100\%. Implications are briefly discussed.

<i>Gabriel Gouraud</i>
<p>In the first part of the article, we study one-dimensional noninteracting
fermions in the continuum and in the presence of the repulsive inverse power
law potential, with an emphasis on the Wigner function in the semiclassical
limit. In this limit, the Wigner function exhibits an edge called the Fermi
surf that depends only on the classical one-particle Hamiltonian. Around the
Fermi surf, under a well-defined semiclassical limit, the Wigner function can
be expressed in terms of Airy functions which yield a smooth matching between
the two regions delimited by the Fermi surf. In the second part of the article,
the system is prepared in the ground state of the inverse power law potential
where only the left half line is filled with fermions. Then the potential is
switched off, resulting in the emergence of a propagating quantum front. We
show that the power law decay of the pre-quench potential that separates the
left and right half systems leads to the emergence of the Airy kernel (well
known in Random Matrix Theory) at the quantum front in the long-time limit.

<h3>Unprecedentedly large superconducting gap in  HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+δ}$ with the highest $T_c$ at ambient pressure</h3>

<i>Chuanhao Wen, Zhiyong Hou, Alireza Akbari, Kailun Chen, Wenshan Hong, Huan Yang, Ilya Eremin, Yuan Li, Hai-Hu Wen</i>
<p>In cuprate superconductors, the highest superconducting transition
temperature $T_c$ is possessed by the HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$
(Hg-1223) system at ambient pressure, but the reason remains elusive. Here we
report the scanning tunneling microscope measurements on the Hg-1223 single
crystals with $T_c$ = 134 K. The observed superconducting gaps determined from
the tunneling spectra can be categorized into two groups: the smaller gap
$\Delta_1$ ranges from about 45 to 70 meV, while the larger gap $\Delta_2$ from
about 65 to 98 meV. The observed unprecedentedly large gap value gives a
straightforward explanation to the highest $T_c$ in the Hg-1223 system. The
largest gap observed here is comparable to the magnetic superexchange energy
and excludes any possibility of using phonon pictures to interpret the
superconductivity. Interestingly, an extremely strong particle-hole asymmetry
is observed in associating with a very robust coherence peak at the bias of the
larger gap in the hole branch of the Bogoliubov dispersion. We propose that the
observed asymmetry results from the interplay of a flat band (van Hove
singularity) in the electronic spectrum and the large superconducting gap in
the underdoped layer. This could be the main reason for the strong pairing, and
significant enhancement of the density of states in the hole branch of the
Bogoliubov band yielding strong phase coherence of Cooper pairs. A scenario
based on a trilayer model with an interlayer coupling can give a reasonable
explanation. Our results provide deep insight into understanding the mechanism
of superconductivity in cuprate superconductors.

<p>The electronic structure and magnetic properties of a newly predicted stable
ternary compound La$_{18}$Co$_{28}$Pb$_{3}$ are studied using electronic
structure analysis. The ground state of this compound is ferromagnetic, with
three positions of nonequivalent magnetic Co atoms. A strong dependence of
magnetic properties on volume shows that this system is situated near the point
of magnetic instability. A coexistence of high- and low-spin ferromagnetic
states as a function of volume near equilibrium was discovered. A corresponding
spin tunneling splitting was estimated. The stability of the theoretically
predicted magnetic ground state was tested by varying the Hubbard parameter.
The thermal spin fluctuations were added to estimate the paramagnetic moment
and a Curie temperature. The necessity of experimental verification of the
obtained results is emphasized.

<br>
<i>Patrycja Łydżba, Peter Prelovšek, Marcin Mierzejewski</i>
<p>Hilbert space fragmentation is an ergodicity breaking phenomenon, in which
Hamiltonian shatters into exponentially many dynamically disconnected sectors.
In many fragmented systems, these sectors can be labelled by statistically
localized integrals of motion, which are nonlocal operators. We study the
paradigmatic nearest-neighbor pair hopping (PH) model exhibiting the so-called
strong fragmentation. We show that this model hosts local integrals of motion
(LIOMs), which correspond to frozen density modes with long wavelengths. The
latter modes become subdiffusive when longer-range pair hoppings are allowed.
Finally, we make a connection with a tilted (Stark) chain. Contrary to the
dipole-conserving effective models, the tilted chain is shown to support either
Hamiltonian or dipole moment as an LIOM. Numerical results are obtained from a
numerical algorithm, in which finding LIOMs is reduced to the data compression
problem.

<p>Engineering new quantum phases requires fine tuning of the electronic,
orbital, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom. To this end, the kagome lattice
with flat bands has garnered great attention by hosting various topological and
correlated phases, when the flat band is at the Fermi level. Here we discover
unconventional nematiciy in kagome metal CoSn, where flat bands are fully
occupied below the Fermi level. Thermodynamic, dilatometry, resonant X-ray
scattering, inelastic neutron scattering, Larmor diffraction, and
thermoelectric measurements consistently hint at rotational symmetry-breaking
and nematic order that is pronounced only near T=225 K. These observations,
principally the nematic's finite temperature stability -- incipience -- can be
explained by a phenomenological model which reveals that thermally excited flat
bands promote symmetry breaking at a characteristic temperature. Our work shows
that thermal fluctuations, which are typically detrimental for correlated
electron phases, can induce new ordered states of matter, avoiding the
requirements for fine tuning of electronic bands.

<h3>Flocking by turning away</h3>

<br>
<i>Suchismita Das, Matteo Ciarchi, Ziqi Zhou, Jing Yan, Jie Zhang, Ricard Alert</i>
<p>Flocking, as paradigmatically exemplified by birds, is the coherent
collective motion of active agents. As originally conceived, flocking emerges
through alignment interactions between the agents. Here, we report that
flocking can also emerge through interactions that turn agents away from each
other. Combining simulations, kinetic theory, and experiments, we demonstrate
this mechanism of flocking in self-propelled Janus colloids with stronger
repulsion on the front than on the rear. The polar state is stable because
particles achieve a compromise between turning away from left and right
neighbors. Unlike for alignment interactions, the emergence of polar order from
turn-away interactions requires particle repulsion. At high concentration,
repulsion produces flocking Wigner crystals. Whereas repulsion often leads to
motility-induced phase separation of active particles, here it combines with
turn-away torques to produce flocking. Therefore, our findings bridge the
classes of aligning and non-aligning active matter. Our results could help to
reconcile the observations that cells can flock despite turning away from each
other via contact inhibition of locomotion. Overall, our work shows that
flocking is a very robust phenomenon that arises even when the orientational
interactions would seem to prevent it.

<p>Tissue surface tension influences cell sorting and tissue fusion. Earlier
mechanical studies suggest that multicellular spheroids actively reinforce
their surface tension with applied force. Here we study this open question
through high-throughput microfluidic micropipette aspiration measurements on
cell spheroids to identify the role of force duration and cell contractility.
We find that larger spheroid deformations lead to faster cellular retraction
once the pressure is released, regardless of the applied force and cellular
contractility. These new insights demonstrate that spheroid viscoelasticity is
deformation-dependent and challenge whether surface tension truly reinforces.

<p>A generation, propagation, and transfer of phonon angular momenta are
examined on thermal transport in chiral insulative and diamagnetic crystals of
$\alpha$-quartz. We found that thermally-driven phonons carry
chirality-dependent angular momenta in the quartz crystals and they could be
extracted from the quartz as a spin signal. Namely, chirality-induced
selectivity of phonon angular momenta is realized in the chiral quartz. We
argue that chiral phonons available in chiral materials could be a key element
in triggering or enhancing chirality-induced spin selectivity with robust spin
polarization and long-range spin transport found in various chiral materials.

<p>We report an implementation of the recursion method that addresses quantum
many-body dynamics in the nonperturbative regime. The implementation has two
key ingredients: a computer-algebraic routine for symbolic calculation of
nested commutators and a procedure to extrapolate the sequence of Lanczos
coefficients according to the universal operator growth hypothesis. We apply
the method to calculate infinite-temperature correlation functions for
spin-$1/2$ systems on one- and two-dimensional lattices. In two dimensions the
accessible timescale is large enough to essentially embrace the relaxation to
equilibrium. The method allows one to accurately calculate transport
coefficients. As an illustration, we compute the diffusion constant for the
transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice.

<h3>Stress and Alignment Response to Curved Obstacles in Growing Bacterial  Monolayers</h3>

<br>
<i>Blake Langeslay, Will Fahy, Gabriel Juarez</i>
<p>Monolayers of growing bacteria, confined within channel geometries, exhibit
self-organization into a highly aligned laminar state along the axis of the
channel. Although this phenomenon has been observed in experiments and
simulations under various boundary conditions, the underlying physical
mechanism driving this alignment remains unclear. In this study, we conduct
simulations of growing bacteria in 2D channel geometries perturbed by fixed
obstacles, either circular or arc-shaped, placed at the channel's center. Our
findings reveal that even sizable obstacles cause only short-ranged disruptions
to the baseline laminar state. These disruptions arise from a competition
between local planar anchoring and bulk laminar alignment. At smaller obstacle
sizes, bulk alignment fully dominates, while at larger sizes, planar anchoring
induces increasing local disruptions. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that
the resulting configurations of the bacterial system display a striking
resemblance to the arrangement of hard-rod smectic liquid crystals around
circular obstacles. This suggests that modeling hard-rod bacterial monolayers
as smectic, rather than nematic, liquid crystals may yield successful outcomes.
The insights gained from our study contribute to the expanding body of research
on bacterial growth in channels. Our work provides new perspectives on the
stability of the laminar state and extends our understanding to encompass more
intricate confinement schemes.

<i>Asier Zabalo, Massimiliano Stengel</i>
<p>We present a first-principles methodology, within the context of
linear-response theory, that greatly facilitates the perturbative study of
physical properties of metallic crystals. Our approach builds on ensemble
density-functional theory [Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 1337 (1997)] to write the
adiabatic second-order energy as an unconstrained variational functional of
both the wave functions and their occupancies. Thereby, it enables the
application of standard tools of density-functional perturbation theory (most
notably, the "$2n+1$" theorem) in metals, opening the way to an efficient and
accurate calculation of their nonlinear and spatially dispersive responses. We
apply our methodology to phonons and strain gradients and demonstrate the
accuracy of our implementation by computing the spatial dispersion coefficients
of zone-center optical phonons and the flexoelectric force-response tensor of
selected metal structures.

<i>Filippo Conforto, Yair Augusto Gutierrez Fosado, Davide Michieletto</i>
<p>Loop extrusion is one of the main processes shaping chromosome organisation
across the cell cycle, yet its role in regulating DNA entanglement and
nucleoplasm viscoelasticty remains overlooked. We simulate entangled solutions
of linear polymers under the action of generic Loop Extruding Factors (LEF)
with a model that fully accounts for topological constraints and LEF-DNA
uncrossability. We discover that extrusion drives the formation of
bottle-brush-like structures which significantly lower the entanglement and
effective viscosity of the system through an active fluidification mechanism.
Interestingly, this fluidification displays an optimum at one LEF every
300-3000 basepairs. In marked contrast with entangled linear chains, the
viscosity of extruded chains scales linearly with polymer length, yielding up
to 1000-fold fluidification. Our results illuminate how loop extrusion
contributes to actively modulate genome entanglement and viscoelasticity in
vivo.

<h3>Exploring Two-dimensional Coherent Spectroscopy with Exact  Diagonalization: Spinons and Confinement in 1D Quantum Magnets</h3>

<i>Yoshito Watanabe, Simon Trebst, Ciarán Hickey</i>
<p>Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) with terahertz radiation offers
a promising new avenue for the exploration of many-body phenomena in quantum
magnets. This includes the potential diagnosis of fractionalized excitations,
for which linear response often struggles due to the indistinguishability of a
continuum of fractional excitations from that caused by disorders or
impurities. However, the interpretation of the complex results produced by 2DCS
remains a challenge, and a general prediction of the spectral characteristics
of different types of excitations has not yet been established. In this paper,
we develop a numerical approach based on exact diagonalization (ED) to push our
understanding of 2DCS towards different scenarios. We first validate our
approach by comparing numerical ED and exact analytical results for the
spectroscopic signatures of spinons in one-dimensional transverse field Ising
model and develop how to deal with the inherently small system sizes in ED
calculations. Augmenting the model by a longitudinal field, we demonstrate
significant changes to the 2DCS spectrum upon the field-induced spinon pair
confinement, which can be rationalized in our ED calculations and from a
"two-kink" model (in the absence of integrability). One advantage of our ED
approach is its possible extension to finite temperatures, which we explore
using thermally pure quantum states and demonstrate to change the intensity and
spectroscopical patterns of 2DCS when going beyond the integrable model. Our
numerically exact results provide a benchmark for future experiments and
theoretical studies relying on approximation methods, and pave the way for the
exploration of fractionalized excitations in quantum magnets.
