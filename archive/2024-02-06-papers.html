<h3>Vanishing in Fractal Space: Thermal Melting and Hydrodynamic Collapse</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03361" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03361</a>
<br>
<i>Trung V. Phan, Truong H. Cai, Van H. Do</i>
<p>Fractals emerge everywhere in nature, exhibiting intricate geometric
complexities through the self-organizing patterns that span across multiple
scales. Here, we investigate beyond steady-states the interplay between this
geometry and the vanishing dynamics, through phase-transitional thermal melting
and hydrodynamic void collapse, within fractional continuous models. We present
general analytical expressions for estimating vanishing times with their
applicability contingent on the fractality of space. We apply our findings on
the fractal environments crucial for plant growth: natural soils. We focus on
the transport phenomenon of cavity shrinkage in incompressible fluid,
conducting a numerical study beyond the inviscid limit. We reveal how a minimal
collapsing time can emerge through a non-trivial coupling between the fluid
viscosity and the surface fractal dimension.

<h3>High temperature internal friction in a Ti-46Al-1Mo-0.2Si intermetallic,  comparison with creep behaviour</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03389" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03389</a>
<br>
<i>M. Castillo-Rodríguez, M.L. No, J.A. Jimenez, O.A. Ruano, J. San Juan</i>
<p>Advanced g-TiAl based intermetallics Mo-bearing have been developed to obtain
the fine-grained microstructure required for superplastic deformation to be
used during further processing. In the present work we have studied an alloy of
Ti-46Al-1Mo-0.2Si (at%) with two different microstructures, as-cast material
with a coarse grain size above 300 mm, and the hot extruded material exhibiting
a grain size smaller than 20 mm. We have used a mechanical spectrometer
especially developed for high temperature internal friction measurements to
study the defect mobility processes taking place at high temperature. The
internal friction spectra at different frequencies has been studied and
analyzed up to 1360 K in order to characterize the relaxation processes
appearing in this temperature range. A relaxation peak, with a maximum in
between 900 K and 1080 K, depending on the oscillating frequency, has been
attributed to Ti-atoms diffusion by the stress-induced reorientation of
Al-VTi-Al elastic dipoles. The high temperature background in both
microstructural states, as-cast and extruded, has been analyzed, measuring the
apparent activation parameters, in particular the apparent energies of
Ecast(IF) 4.4 +- 0.05 eV and Eext(IF) 4.75 +- 0.05 eV respectively. These
results have been compared to those obtained on the same materials by creep
deformation. We may conclude that the activation parameters obtained by
internal friction analysis, are consistent with the ones measured by creep.
Furthermore, the analysis of the high temperature background allows establish
the difference on creep resistance for both microstructural states

<h3>Microscopic inclusion statistics in a discrete 1-body spectrum</h3>

<i>Stephane Ouvry, Alexios P. Polychronakos</i>
<p>We present the microscopic formulation of inclusion statistics, a
counterpoint to exclusion statistics in which particles tend to coalesce more
than ordinary bosons. We derive the microscopic occupation multiplicities of
1-body quantum states and show that they factorize into a product of clusters
of neighbouring occupied states with enhanced statistical weights. Applying
this statistics to a one-dimensional gas of particles in a harmonic well leads
to a Calogero-like n-body inclusion spectrum with interesting physical
properties.

<h3>Sequential Adiabatic Generation of Chiral Topological States</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03433" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03433</a>
<br>
<i>Xie Chen, Michael Hermele, David T. Stephen</i>
<p>In previous work, it was shown that non-trivial gapped states can be
generated from a product state using a sequential quantum circuit. Explicit
circuit constructions were given for a variety of gapped states at exactly
solvable fixed points. In this paper, we show that a similar generation
procedure can be established for chiral topological states as well, despite the
fact that they lack an exactly solvable form. Instead of sequentially applying
local unitary gates, we sequentially evolve the Hamiltonian by changing local
terms in one subregion and then the next. The Hamiltonian remains gapped
throughout the process, giving rise to an adiabatic evolution mapping the
ground state from a product state to a chiral topological state. We demonstrate
such a sequential adiabatic generation process for free fermion chiral states
like the Chern Insulator and the $p+ip$ superconductor. Moreover, we show that
coupling a quantum state to a discrete gauge group can be achieved through a
sequential quantum circuit, thereby generating interacting chiral topological
states from the free fermion ones.

<h3>Nematic heavy fermions and coexisting magnetic order in CeSiI</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03442" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03442</a>
<br>
<i>Aayush Vijayvargia, Onur Erten</i>
<p>Motivated by the recent discovery of magnetism and heavy quasiparticles in
van der Waals material CeSiI, we develop an effective model that incorporates
the conduction electrons residing at the silicene layer interacting with the
local moments of the Ce ions. Ce sites are arranged on two layers of triangular
lattices, above and below the silicene layer, and they are located at the
center of the honeycomb lattice. This arrangement results in an effective
extended Kondo interaction along with a predominant ferromagnetic RKKY
interaction. Via mean-field theory of Abrikosov fermions, our analysis
indicates that the ground state of the monolayer can exhibit a non-magnetic
nematic heavy fermion phase that breaks $C_6$ rotational symmetry for small
Heisenberg exchange and a magnetically ordered phase for large Heisenberg
exchange. For intermediate values, a coexistence of magnetic order and a
uniform heavy Fermi liquid is stabilized where they reside on separate Ce
layers. We show that this phase can further be enhanced by an external electric
field. Our results provide a natural mechanism for the coexistence of magnetic
order and heavy fermions in CeSiI and highlight the possibility of
unconventional non-magnetic heavy fermions with broken rotational symmetry.

<h3>Nanosecond stochastic operation in perpendicular superparamagnetic  tunnel junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03452" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03452</a>
<br>
<i>Lucile Soumah, Louise Desplat, Nhat-Tan Phan, Ahmed Sidi El Valli, Advait Madhavan, Florian Disdier, Stéphane Auffret, Ricardo Sousa, Ursula Ebels, Philippe Talatchian</i>
<p>We demonstrate the miniaturization of perpendicularly magnetized
superparamagnetic tunnel junctions (SMTJs) down to 50 nm in diameter. We
experimentally show stochastic reversals in those junctions, with tunable mean
dwell times down to a few nanoseconds through applied magnetic field and
voltage. The mean dwell times measured at negligible bias voltage agree with
our simulations based on Langer's theory. We shed light on an Arrhenius
prefactor $\tau_0$ of a few femtoseconds, implying that the rates of
thermally-activated magnetic transitions exceed the GHz-to-THz limitation of
macrospin models, whereby $\tau_0\sim1$ ns. We explain the small prefactor
values by a Meyer-Neldel compensation phenomenon, where the prefactor exhibits
a large entropic contribution with an exponential dependence on the activation
energy. These findings pave the way towards the development of ultrafast,
low-power unconventional computing schemes operating by leveraging thermal
noise in perpendicular SMTJs, which are scalable below 20 nm.

<h3>First principles evaluation of phase stability in the In-Sn binary  system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03506" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03506</a>
<br>
<i>Michael Widom</i>
<p>The In-Sn binary alloy system exhibits several unusual features that
challenge crystallographic and thermodynamic expectations. We combine first
principles total energy calculation with simple thermodynamic modeling to
address two key points. First, we evaluate energies along the Bain path to
interpret the discontinuous transition between the phases $\alpha$-In (Pearson
type tI2) and $\beta$--In$_3$Sn (also Pearson type tI2) that are identical in
symmetry. Second, we demonstrate that the solid solution phases
$\beta$-In$_3$Sn and $\gamma$-InSn$_4$ (Pearson type hP1) exist at high
temperatures only, and they exhibit eutectoid decompositions at low
temperatures.

<h3>Bringing together two paradigms of non-equilibrium: Driven dynamics of  aging systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03516" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03516</a>
<br>
<i>Diego Tapias, Charles Marteau, Fabián Aguirre-López, Peter Sollich</i>
<p>There are two fundamental paradigms for non-equilibrium dynamics: on the one
hand, aging towards an equilibrium state that cannot be reached on reasonable
timescales; on the other, external driving that can lead to non-equilibrium
steady states. We explore how these two mechanisms interact, by studying the
behaviour of trap models, which are paradigmatic descriptions of slow glassy
dynamics, when driven by trajectory bias towards high or low activity. To
diagnose whether the driven systems continue to age, we establish a framework
for mapping the biased dynamics to a Markovian time evolution with
time-dependent transition rates. We find that the original aging dynamics
reacts in two qualitatively distinct ways to the driving: it can be destroyed
by driving of any nonzero strength (fragile aging), whereby the dynamics either
reaches an active steady state or effectively freezes; or it can persist within
a finite range of driving strengths around the undriven case (robust aging).
This classification into fragile and robust aging could form the basis for
distinguishing different universality classes of aging dynamics.

<h3>Efficient Generation of Grids and Traversal Graphs in Compositional  Spaces towards Exploration and Path Planning Exemplified in Materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03528" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03528</a>
<br>
<i>Adam M. Krajewski, Allison M. Beese, Wesley F. Reinhart, Zi-Kui Liu</i>
<p>Many disciplines of science and engineering deal with problems related to
compositions, ranging from chemical compositions in materials science to
portfolio compositions in economics. They exist in non-Euclidean simplex
spaces, causing many standard tools to be incorrect or inefficient, which is
significant in combinatorically or structurally challenging spaces exemplified
by Compositionally Complex Materials (CCMs) and Functionally Graded Materials
(FGMs). Here, we explore them conceptually in terms of problem spaces and
quantitatively in terms of computational feasibility.
This work implements several essential methods specific to the compositional
(simplex) spaces through a high-performance open-source library nimplex. Most
significantly, we derive and implement an algorithm for constructing a novel
n-dimensional simplex graph data structure, which contains all discretized
compositions and all possible neighbor-to-neighbor transitions as pointer
arrays. Critically, no distance or neighborhood calculations are performed,
instead leveraging pure combinatorics and the ordering in procedurally
generated simplex grids, keeping the algorithm $\mathcal{O}(N)$, so that graphs
with billions of transitions take seconds to construct on a laptop.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how such graph representations can be combined to
express path-planning problem spaces and to incorporate prior knowledge while
keeping the problem space homogeneous. This allows for efficient deployment of
existing high-performance gradient descent, graph traversal search, and other
path optimization algorithms.

<h3>A Theoretical Study of Doping Evolution of Phonons in High-Temperature  Cuprate Superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03537" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03537</a>
<br>
<i>Saheli Sarkar</i>
<p>Hole-doped high-temperature copper oxide-based superconductors (cuprates)
exhibit complex phase diagrams where electronic orders like a charge density
wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) appear at low temperatures. The origins
of these electronic orders are still open questions due to their complex
interplay and correlated nature. These electronic orders can modify the phonons
in the system, which has also been experimentally found in several cuprates as
a softening in the phonon frequency at the CDW vector. Recent experiments have
revealed that the softening in phonons in cuprates due to CDW shows intriguing
behavior with increasing hole doping. Hole doping can also change the
underlying Fermi surface. Therefore, it is an interesting question whether the
doping-induced change in the Fermi surface can affect the softening of phonons,
which in turn can reveal the nature of the electronic orders present in the
system. In this work, we investigate this question by studying the softening of
phonons in the presence of CDW and SC within a perturbative approach developed
in an earlier work. We compare the results obtained within the working model to
some experiments.

<h3>Influence of graphene on the electronic and magnetic properties of an  iron(III) porphyrin chloride complex</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03544" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03544</a>
<br>
<i>Young-Joon Song, Charlotte Gallenkamp, Genís Lleopart, Vera Krewald, Roser Valentí</i>
<p>Although iron-based catalysts are regarded as a promising alternative to
precious metal catalysts, their precise electronic structures during catalysis
still pose challenges for computational descriptions. A particularly urgent
question is the influence of the environment on the electronic structure, and
how to describe this properly with computational methods. Here, we study an
iron porphyrin chloride complex adsorbed on a graphene sheet using density
functional theory calculations to detail how much the electronic structure is
influenced by the presence of a graphene layer. Our results indicate that weak
interactions due to van der Waals forces dominate between the porphyrin complex
and graphene, and only a small amount of charge is transferred between the two
entities. Furthermore, the interplay of the ligand field environment, strong
$p$ $-$ $d$ hybridization, and correlation effects within the complex are
strongly involved in determining the spin state of the iron ion. By bridging
molecular chemistry and solid state physics, this study provides first steps
towards a joint analysis of the properties of iron-based catalysts from first
principles.

<h3>Gauging on the lattice and gapped/gapless topological phases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03566" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03566</a>
<br>
<i>Takamasa Ando</i>
<p>In this work, we explore topological phases of matter obtained by effectively
gauging or fermionizing the system, where the Gauss law constraint is only
enforced energetically. In contrast to conventional gauging or fermionizion,
the symmetry that is effectively gauged in low energy still generates a global
symmetry that acts on the whole Hilbert space faithfully. This symmetry turns
out to protect a non-trivial topological phase with other emergent symmetry, or
can have a non-trivial 't Hooft anomaly. We provide a precise formula for the
topological response action involving these symmetries in a general setup, as
well as find a formula for 't Hooft anomalies. As an application, we apply the
general treatment of the procedure to gapless systems and find various new
gapless SPT phases, such as the one carrying the Gu-Wen fermionic anomalies at
low energy.

<h3>A back-to-back diode model applied to MoS2 van der Waals Schottky diodes</h3>

<br>
<i>Jeffrey A. Cloninger, Raine Harris, Kristine L. Haley, Randy M. Sterbentz, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Joshua O. Island</i>
<p>The use of metal van der Waals contacts and the implicit reduction in
Fermi-level pinning in contacted semiconductors has led to remarkable device
optimizations. For example, using graphene as an electrical contact allows for
tunable Schottky barriers in transistors and barristors. In this study, we
present a double Schottky barrier model and apply it to barrier tunable all van
der Waals transistors. In a molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) transistor with
graphene and few-layer graphene contacts, we find that the model can be applied
to extract Schottky barrier heights that agree with the Schottky-Mott rule from
simple two-terminal current-voltage measurements at room temperature.
Furthermore, we show tunability of the Schottky barrier \textit{in-situ} using
a regional contact gate. Our results show that a basic back-to-back diode
model, applied to two terminal measurements, can capture the diode properties
of all-van-der-Waals transistors relatively well.

<h3>Collapse of Landau level in semi-Dirac materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03623" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03623</a>
<br>
<i>Daniil Asafov, Ilia Pavlov</i>
<p>Two-dimensional semi-Dirac models describe a family of novel materials that
have anisotropic dispersion with relativistic-type spectrum along one of the
spatial directions and non-relativistic along another. In the present paper we
perform a detailed analysis of Landau levels collapse for such models in
perpendicular magnetic field and in-plane electric field by using
semi-classical approach and tight-binding simulations. The anisotropic nature
of semi-Dirac dispersion manifests itself in the possibility of Landau level
collapse for only one of the electric field directions. In addition, the
topological transition with merging Dirac cones has its own distinct features
in Landau level collapse.

<h3>On Purely Macroscopic Theory of Rigid Semiconductors Constructed from  Multi-Continuum Model</h3>

<p>A complete and systematic derivation of the purely macroscopic theory of
rigid semiconductors is given. It is based on a five-continuum model of charged

electrostatics and is limited to nonmagnetizable materials.

<h3>Physics-based Modeling of Pulse and Relaxation of High-rate  Li/CF$_{x}$-SVO batteries in Implantable Medical Devices</h3>

<br>
<i>Qiaohao Liang, Giacomo Galuppini, Partha M. Gomadam, Prabhakar A. Tamirisa, Jeffrey A. Lemmerman, Michael J. M. Mazack, Melani G. Sullivan, Richard D. Braatz, Martin Z. Bazant</i>
<p>We present a physics-based model that accurately predicts the performance of
Medtronic's implantable medical device battery lithium/carbon monofluoride
(CF$_x$) - silver vanadium oxide (SVO) under both low-rate background
monitoring and high-rate pulsing currents. The distinct properties of multiple
active materials are reflected by parameterizing their thermodynamics,
kinetics, and mass transport properties separately. Diffusion limitations of
Li$^+$ in SVO are used to explain cell voltage transient behavior during pulse
and post-pulse relaxation. We also introduce change in cathode electronic
conductivity, Li metal anode surface morphology, and film resistance buildup to
capture evolution of cell internal resistance throughout multi-year electrical
tests. We share our insights on how the Li$^+$ redistribution process between
active materials can restore pulse capability of the hybrid electrode, allow
CF$_x$ to indirectly contribute to capacity release during pulsing, and affect
the operation protocols and design principles of batteries with other hybrid
electrodes. We also discuss additional complexities in porous electrode model
parameterization and electrochemical characterization techniques due to
parallel reactions and solid diffusion pathways across active materials. We
hope our models implemented in the Hybrid Multiphase Porous Electrode Theory
(Hybrid-MPET) framework can complement future experimental research and
accelerate development of multi-active material electrodes with targeted
performance.

<h3>No-exclaves percolation on random networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03689" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03689</a>
<br>
<i>Byungjoon Min, Eun-Kyu Park, Sang-Hwan Gwak, K.-I. Goh</i>
<p>No-exclaves percolation (NExP) is a nonlocal percolation process in which the
components are formed not only by the connected occupied nodes but also by the
agglomeration of empty nodes completely surrounded by the occupied nodes. It
has been studied in low dimensions, displaying such novel phenomena as the
discontinuous transition to complete percolation. However, its characteristics
in complex networks are still unexplored. In this paper, we study the NExP on
random networks by developing mean-field solutions using the generating
function formalism. Our theory allows us to determine the size of the giant
no-exclaves component as well as the percolation threshold, which are in
excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations on random networks and some
real-world networks. We show that on random networks NExP exhibits three phases
and two transitions between them: the phases are characterized by the presence
or absence of not only the giant no-exclaves component but also the giant
unoccupied component, which is the giant connected component composed solely of
unoccupied nodes. This work offers theoretical understanding on the anatomy of
phase transitions in the NExP process.

<h3>Evidence that the AT transition disappears below six dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03711" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03711</a>
<br>
<i>Bharadwaj Vedula, M. A. Moore, Auditya Sharma</i>
<p>One of the key predictions of Parisi's broken replica symmetry theory of spin
glasses is the existence of a phase transition in an applied field to a state
with broken replica symmetry. This transition takes place at the de
Almeida-Thouless (AT) line in the $h-T$ plane. We have studied this line in the
power-law diluted Heisenberg spin glass in which the probability that two spins
separated by a distance $r$ interact with each other falls as $1/r^{2\sigma}$.
In the presence of a random vector-field of variance $h_r^2$ the phase
transition is in the universality class of the Ising spin glass in a field.
Tuning $\sigma$ is equivalent to changing the dimension $d$ of the short-range
system, with the relation being $d =2/(2\sigma -1)$ for $\sigma < 2/3$. We have
found by numerical simulations that $h_{\text{AT}}^2 \sim (2/3 -\sigma)$
implying that the AT line does not exist below $6$ dimensions and that the
Parisi scheme is not appropriate for spin glasses in three dimensions.

<h3>Magnon mediated spin pumping by coupled ferrimagnetic garnets  heterostructure</h3>

<i>Anupama Swain, Kshitij Singh Rathore, Pushpendra Gupta, Abhisek Mishra, Gary Lee, Jinho Lim, Axel Hoffmann, Ramanathan Mahendiran, Subhankar Bedanta</i>
<p>Spin pumping has significant implications for spintronics, providing a
mechanism to manipulate and transport spins for information processing.
Understanding and harnessing spin currents through spin pumping is critical for
the development of efficient spintronic devices. The use of a magnetic
insulator with low damping, enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in crucial
experiments such as spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and spin pumping.
A magnetic insulator coupled with a heavy metal or quantum material offers a
more straight forward model system, especially when investigating spin-charge
interconversion processes to greater accuracy. This simplicity arises from the
absence of unwanted effects caused by conduction electrons unlike in
ferromagnetic metals. Here, we investigate the spin pumping in coupled
ferrimagnetic (FiM) Y3Fe5O12 (YIG)/Tm3Fe5O12 (TmIG) bilayers combined with
heavy-metal (Pt) using the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). It is observed that
magnon transmission occurs at both of the FiMs FMR positions. The enhancement
of spin pumping voltage (Vsp) in the FiM garnet heterostructures is attributed
to the strong interfacial exchange coupling between FiMs. The modulation of Vsp
is achieved by tuning the bilayer structure. Further, the spin mixing
conductance for these coupled systems is found to be 10^18 m^-2. Our findings
describe a novel coupled FiM system for the investigation of magnon coupling
providing new prospects for magnonic devices.

<h3>Probing early phase coarsening in a rapidly quenched Bose gas using  off-resonant matter-wave interferometry</h3>

<i>Tenzin Rabga, Yangheon Lee, Yong-il Shin</i>
<p>We experimentally investigate the evolution of spatial phase correlations in
a rapidly quenched inhomogeneous Bose gas of rubidium using off-resonant
matter-wave interferometry. We measure the phase coherence length $\ell$ of the
sample and directly probe its increase during the early stage of condensate
growth before vortices are formed. Once the vortices are formed stably in the
quenched condensate, the measured value of $\ell$ is shown to be linearly
proportional to the mean distance between the vortices. These results confirm
the presence of phase coarsening prior to vortex formation, which is crucial
for a quantitative understanding of the resultant defect density in samples
undergoing critical phase transitions.

<p>One of the essential functions of living organisms is spontaneous migration
through the deformation of their body, such as crawling, swimming, and walking.
Depending on the size of the object, the efficient migratory mode should be
altered because the contribution from the inertial and frictional forces acting
on the object switches. Although the self-propelling motion characterizing
active matter has been extensively studied, it is still elusive how a living
cell utilizes the mode switching of the self-propulsion. Here, we studied the
migration dynamics of amoeboid movement of free-living amoeba, Amoeba proteus,
for starved and vegetative phases, as typified by dynamic and stationary
states, respectively. Fourier-mode analysis on the cell shape and migration
velocity extracted two characteristic migration modes, which makes a
coexistence of amoeboid-swimmer like random motion and the active-droplet like
ballistic motion. While the amoeboid-swimmer mode governs random motion, the
active-droplet mode performs non-negligible contribution on the migration
strength. By employing the symmetry argument of the active-droplet, we discover
the supercritical pitchfork bifurcation of the migration velocity due to the
symmetry breaking of the cell shape represents the switching manner from the
motionless state to the random and the ballistic motions. Our results suggest
that sub-mm sized A. proteus utilizes both shape oscillatory migration of
deformed-swimmer driven by surface wave and convection based mass transfer,
called blebbing, as like as cm-sized active droplet to optimize the movement
efficiency.

<h3>Unveiling the charge density wave mechanism in vanadium-based Bi-layered  kagome metals</h3>

<p>The charge density wave (CDW), as a hallmark of vanadium-based kagome
superconductor AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs), has attracted intensive attention.
However, the fundamental controversy regarding the underlying mechanism of CDW
therein persists. Recently, the vanadium-based bi-layered kagome metal ScV6Sn6,
reported to exhibit a long-range charge order below 94 K, has emerged as a
promising candidate to further clarify this core issue. Here, employing
micro-focusing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ({\mu}-ARPES) and
first-principles calculations, we systematically studied the unique CDW order
in vanadium-based bi-layered kagome metals by comparing ScV6Sn6 with its
isostructural counterpart YV6Sn6, which lacks a CDW ground state. Combining
ARPES data and the corresponding joint density of states (DOS), we suggest that
the VHS nesting mechanism might be invalid in these materials. Besides, in
ScV6Sn6, we identified multiple hybridization energy gaps resulting from
CDW-induced band folding, along with an anomalous band dispersion, implying a
potential electron-phonon coupling driven mechanism underlying the formation of
the CDW order. Our finding not only comprehensively maps the electronic

<h3>DC current generation by dielectric loss in ferroelectrics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03768" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03768</a>
<br>
<i>Takahiro Morimoto, Naoto Nagaosa</i>
<p>We study dc current generation induced by microwave irradiation to
ferroelectric materials. The dc current generation originates from microwave
absorption called dielectric loss due to the delay of dielectric response. Such
current generation can be formulated as the low-frequency limit of the phonon
shift current which arises from an increase of electric polarization
accompanying photoexcitation of phonons due to the electron-phonon coupling. To
study the dc current generation by the dielectric loss, we apply the
diagrammatic treatment of nonlinear optical responses to photoexcitations of
phonons and derive the general formula for phonon shift current. We then study
the dc current generation in the low-frequency region and find that the dc
current scales as $\propto w^2$ for the linearly polarized light and time
reversal symmetric systems. We estimate the order of magnitude of the dc
current generation by dielectric loss, indicating its feasibility for
experimental detection in the GHz region.

<h3>Scalable Parallel Algorithm for Graph Neural Network Interatomic  Potentials in Molecular Dynamics Simulations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03789" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03789</a>
<br>
<i>Yutack Park, Jaesun Kim, Seungwoo Hwang, Seungwu Han</i>
<p>Message-passing graph neural network interatomic potentials (GNN-IPs),
particularly those with equivariant representations such as NequIP, are
attracting significant attention due to their data efficiency and high
accuracy. However, parallelizing GNN-IPs poses challenges because multiple
message-passing layers complicate data communication within the spatial
decomposition method, which is preferred by many molecular dynamics (MD)
packages. In this article, we propose an efficient parallelization scheme
compatible with GNN-IPs and develop a package, SevenNet (Scalable
EquiVariance-Enabled Neural NETwork), based on the NequIP architecture. For MD
simulations, SevenNet interfaces with the LAMMPS package. Through benchmark
tests on a 32-GPU cluster with examples of SiO$_2$, SevenNet achieves over 80%
parallel efficiency in weak-scaling scenarios and exhibits nearly ideal
strong-scaling performance as long as GPUs are fully utilized. However, the
strong-scaling performance significantly declines with suboptimal GPU
utilization, particularly affecting parallel efficiency in cases involving
lightweight models or simulations with small numbers of atoms. We also
pre-train SevenNet with a vast dataset from the Materials Project (dubbed
`SevenNet-0') and assess its performance on generating amorphous Si$_3$N$_4$
containing more than 100,000 atoms. By developing scalable GNN-IPs, this work
aims to bridge the gap between advanced machine learning models and large-scale
MD simulations, offering researchers a powerful tool to explore complex
material systems with high accuracy and efficiency.

<h3>Optical absorption and photoluminescence of single layer boron nitride  from a first principles cumulant approach</h3>

<i>Giovanni Marini, Matteo Calandra, Pierluigi Cudazzo</i>
<p>The photoluminescence spectrum of a single-layer boron nitride remains
elusive, marked by enigmatic satellites that hint at a significant but
unidentified exciton-phonon coupling.Here, by employing a first principles
approach based on the many-body cumulant expansion of the charge response, we
calculate the optical absorption and photoluminescence of a single layer boron
nitride. We identify the specific exciton-phonon scattering channels and
unravel their impact on the optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra
thereby providing an interpretation of the experimental features. Finally, we
show that, even in a strongly polar material such as h-BN monolayer, the
electron-hole interaction responsible for the excitonic effect results in the
cancellation of the Fr\"olich interaction at small phonon momenta. This effect
is captured only if the invariance of the exciton-phonon matrix elements under
unitary transformations in the Bloch functions manifold is preserved in the
calculation.

<h3>A Unified Model for Non-Fickian Diffusion and Anomalous Swelling of  Glassy Polymers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03844" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03844</a>
<br>
<i>Peihan Lyu, Zhaoyu Ding, Masao Doi, Xingkun Man</i>
<p>A sheet of glassy polymers placed in solvent shows swelling behaviors quite
different from that of soft polymers (rubbers and gels). (1) Non-Fickian
diffusion (called case II diffusion): As solvent permeates into the sample, a
sharp front is created between the swollen part and the glassy part, and it
moves towards the center at constant speed. (2) Non-monotonous swelling: The
thickness of the sample first increases and then decreases towards the
equilibrium value. Here, we propose a unified theory for the swelling of glassy
polymers. The theory regards the glassy polymers as a continuous mixture of
viscoelastic network and solvent, where the relaxation time of polymer varies
enormously depending on solvent concentration. We will show that this theory
explains the above two characteristics of such process in a simple and unified
framework. The theory predicts how the permeation speed of solvent and the
characteristic times of the swelling process depend on material parameters and
experimental conditions, which can be checked experimentally.

<p>We investigate the topological superconductor candidate UTe$_2$ using
high-resolution valence-band resonant inelastic x-ray scattering at the U
$M_{4,5}$-edges. We observe atomic-like low-energy excitations that support the
correlated nature of this unconventional superconductor. These excitations
originate from the U $5f^2$ configuration, which is unexpected since the short
Te2-Te2 distances exclude Te2 being 2-. By utilizing the photoionization
cross-section dependence of the photoemission spectra in combination with band
structure calculations, we infer that the stabilization of the U $5f^2$
configuration is due to the U $6d$ bonding states in the U-dimers acting as a
charge reservoir. Our results emphasize that the description of the physical
properties should commence with a $5f^2$ $ansatz$.

<h3>Emergent flux in a one-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixture</h3>

<br>
<i>Qi Song, Jie Lou, Yan Chen</i>
<p>We find a novel chiral superfluid (CSF) phase in a chain of Bose-Fermi
mixture, which has been validated using two unbiased numerical methods, density
matrix renormalization group and Grassmann multi-scale entanglement
renormalization ansatz. The system hosts the interplay between two types of
fermions: bare spinless fermions and composite fermions, the latter consisting
of a fermion and a boson. In the CSF phase, bosons condensate at non-zero
momentum |2{\pi}/L|, where L represents the size of the chain. In essence, the
local superfluid order parameter continuously rotates along the chain,
indicating that the 1D CSF phase spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry.
This symmetry breaking gives rise to an emergent flux in the background,
effectively optimizing the kinetic energy of the composite fermions within the
system. We provide a physical understanding at the mean-field level.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the 1D CSF phase can emerge in a more widely
applicable extended Hubbard model. The potential realization of this phase in
cold-atom experiments has also been explored.

<p>Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as frontiers for catalyzing
chemical reactions, yet the diverse combinations of active elements and support
materials, the nature of coordination environments, elude traditional
methodologies in searching optimal SAC systems with superior catalytic
performance. Herein, by integrating multi-branch Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) analysis models to hybrid descriptor based activity volcano plot, 2D SAC
system composed of diverse metallic single atoms anchored on six type of 2D
supports, including graphitic carbon nitride, nitrogen-doped graphene, graphene
with dual-vacancy, black phosphorous, boron nitride, and C2N, are screened for
efficient CO2RR. Starting from establishing a correlation map between the
adsorption energies of intermediates and diverse electronic and elementary
descriptors, sole singular descriptor lost magic to predict catalytic activity.
Deep learning method utilizing multi-branch CNN model therefore was employed,
using 2D electronic density of states as input to predict adsorption energies.
Hybrid-descriptor enveloping both C- and O-types of CO2RR intermediates was
introduced to construct volcano plots and limiting potential periodic table,
aiming for intuitive screening of catalyst candidates for efficient CO2
reduction to CH4. The eDOS occlusion experiments were performed to unravel
individual orbital contribution to adsorption energy. To explore the electronic
scale principle governing practical engineering catalytic CO2RR activity,
orbitalwise eDOS shifting experiments based on CNN model were employed. The
study involves examining the adsorption energy and, consequently, catalytic
activities while varying supported single atoms. This work offers a tangible
framework to inform both theoretical screening and experimental synthesis,
thereby paving the way for systematically designing efficient SACs.

<p>We analyze plasmonic oscillations in the coplanar graphene nanoribbon (GNR)
structures induced by the applied terahertz (THz) signals and calculate the GNR
impedance. The plasmonic oscillations in the CNR structures are associated with
the electron and hole inductances and the lateral inter-CNR capacitance. A
relatively low inter-GNR capacitance enables the resonant excitation of the THz
plasmonic oscillations in the CNR structures with long GNRs. The GNR structures
under consideration can be used in different THz devices as the resonant
structures incorporated in THz detectors, THz sources using resonant-tunneling
diodes, photomixers, and surface acoustic wave sensors.

<h3>Machine learning stochastic differential equations for the evolution of  order parameters of classical many-body systems in and out of equilibrium</h3>

<br>
<i>Francesco Carnazza, Federico Carollo, Sabine Andergassen, Georg Martius, Miriam Klopotek, Igor Lesanovsky</i>
<p>We develop a machine learning algorithm to infer the emergent stochastic
equation governing the evolution of an order parameter of a many-body system.
We train our neural network to independently learn the directed force acting on
the order parameter as well as an effective diffusive noise. We illustrate our
approach using the classical Ising model endowed with Glauber dynamics, and the
contact process as test cases. For both models, which represent paradigmatic
equilibrium and nonequilibrium scenarios, the directed force and noise can be
efficiently inferred. The directed force term of the Ising model allows us to
reconstruct an effective potential for the order parameter which develops the
characteristic double-well shape below the critical temperature. Despite its
genuine nonequilibrium nature, such an effective potential can also be obtained
for the contact process and its shape signals a phase transition into an
absorbing state. Also, in contrast to the equilibrium Ising model, the presence
of an absorbing state renders the noise term dependent on the value of the
order parameter itself.

<p>Spanning over two decades, the study of qubits in semiconductors for quantum
computing has yielded significant breakthroughs. However, the development of
large-scale semiconductor quantum circuits is still limited by challenges in
efficiently tuning and operating these circuits. Identifying optimal operating
conditions for these qubits is complex, involving the exploration of vast
parameter spaces. This presents a real 'needle in the haystack' problem, which,
until now, has resisted complete automation due to device variability and
fabrication imperfections. In this study, we present the first fully autonomous
tuning of a semiconductor qubit, from a grounded device to Rabi oscillations, a
clear indication of successful qubit operation. We demonstrate this automation,
achieved without human intervention, in a Ge/Si core/shell nanowire device. Our
approach integrates deep learning, Bayesian optimization, and computer vision
techniques. We expect this automation algorithm to apply to a wide range of
semiconductor qubit devices, allowing for statistical studies of qubit quality
metrics. As a demonstration of the potential of full automation, we
characterise how the Rabi frequency and g-factor depend on barrier gate
voltages for one of the qubits found by the algorithm. Twenty years after the
initial demonstrations of spin qubit operation, this significant advancement is
poised to finally catalyze the operation of large, previously unexplored
quantum circuits.

<h3>Revisiting the Lee-Yang singularities in the four-dimensional Ising  model: A tribute to the memory of Ralph Kenna</h3>

<br>
<i>J. J. Ruiz-Lorenzo</i>
<p>We have studied numerically the Lee-Yang singularities of the four
dimensional Ising model at criticality, which is believed to be in the same
universality class as the $\phi_4^4$ scalar field theory. We have focused in
the numerical characterization of the logarithmic corrections to the scaling of
the zeros of the partition function and its cumulative probability
distribution, finding a very good agreement with the predictions of the
renormalization group computation on the $\phi_4^4$ scalar field theory. We
have found that this agreement improves much more with the order of the
Lee-Yang zeros. To obtain these results, we have extended a previous study [R.
Kenna and C. B. Lang, Nucl. Phys. {\bf B393} 461 (1993)] in which were computed
numerically the first two zeros for $L\le 24$ lattices, to the computation of
the first four zeros for $L\le 64$ lattices.

<p>A boron-oxide termination of the diamond (100) surface has been formed by
depositing molecular boron oxide $\rm{B_2O_3}$ onto the hydrogen-terminated
(100) diamond surface under ultrahigh vacuum conditions and annealing to
$\rm{950^{\circ} C}$. The resulting termination was highly oriented and
chemically homogeneous, although further optimisation is required to increase
the surface coverage beyond the 0.4 ML achieved here. This work demonstrates
the possibility of using molecular deposition under ultrahigh vacuum conditions
for complex surface engineering of the diamond surface, and may be a first step
in an alternative approach to fabricating boron doped delta layers in diamond.

<h3>Spin-density-wave transition in double-layer nickelate La3Ni2O7</h3>

<br>
<i>Zhao Dan, Yanbing Zhou, Mengwu Huo, Yu Wang, Linpeng Nie, Meng Wang, Tao Wu, Xianhui Chen</i>
<p>Recently, a signature of high-temperature superconductivity above the liquid
nitrogen temperature (77 K) was reported for La3Ni2O7 under pressure. This
finding immediately stimulates intense interest in the possible high-Tc
superconducting mechanism in double-layer nickelates. Interestingly, the
pressure-dependent phase diagram inferred from transport measurements indicates
that superconductivity under high pressure emerges from the suppression of a
density-wave-like transition at ambient pressure, which is similar to
high-temperature superconductors. Therefore, clarifying the exact nature of the
density-wave-like transition is important for determining the mechanism of
superconductivity in double-layer nickelates. Here, nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy of 139La nuclei was performed to study the density-wave-like
transition in a single crystal of La3Ni2O7. The temperature-dependent 139La NMR
spectrum and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T1) provide unambiguous
evidence for a spin-density-wave (SDW) transition with a transition temperature
TSDW of ~ 150 K. Furthermore, the anisotropic splitting of the NMR spectrum
suggests a possible double spin stripe with magnetic moments along the c axis.
In addition, the present NMR measurements also revealed spatial inhomogeneity
of magnetism due to inner apical oxygen vacancies. All these results will be
helpful for building a connection between superconductivity and magnetic
interactions in double-layer nickelates.

<h3>Terahertz ratchet in graphene 2D metamaterial formed by a patterned gate  with an antidot arrayd</h3>

<p>We report the observation of the terahertz-induced ratchet effect in
graphene-based two-dimensional (2D) metamaterials. The metamaterial consists of
a graphite gate patterned with an array of triangular antidots placed under a
graphene monolayer. We show that the ratchet current appears due to the
noncentrosymmetry of the periodic structure unit cell. The ratchet current is
generated owing to the combined action of a spatially periodic in-plane
electrostatic potential and a periodically modulated radiation electric field
caused by near-field diffraction. The magnitude and direction of the ratchet
current are shown to be controlled by voltages applied to both back and
patterned gates, which change the lateral asymmetry, carrier type and density.
The phenomenological and microscopic theories of ratchet effects in
graphene-based 2D metamaterials are developed. The experimental data are
discussed in the light of the theory based on the solution of the Boltzmann
kinetic equation and the calculated electrostatic potential profile. The theory
describes well all the experimental results and shows that the observed ratchet
current consists of the Seebeck thermoratchet contribution as well as the
linear contribution, which is sensitive to the orientation of the radiation
electric field vector with respect to the triangles.

<p>This study analyzes the mechanical and elemental properties of lunar
meteorites DHOFAR 1084, JAH 838, NWA 11444, and HED meteorite NWA 6013.
Utilizing microscale rock mechanics experiments, i.e., nanoindentation testing,
this research reveals significant heterogeneity in both mechanical and
elemental attributes across the minerals of the samples. Olivines, pyroxen,
feldspar, and spinel demonstrate similar compositional and mechanical
characteristics. Conversely, other silicate and oxide minerals display
variations in their mechanical properties. Terrestrial olivines subjected to
nanoindentation tests exhibit increased hardness and a higher Young's modulus
compared to their lunar counterparts. A linear correlation is observed between
the H/Er ratio and both plastic and elastic energies. Additionally, the
alignment of mineral phases along a constant H/Er ratio suggests variations in
local porosity. This study also highlights the need for further research
focusing on porosity, phase insertions within the matrix, and structural
orientations to refine our understanding of these mechanical characteristics.
The findings have direct implications for in-situ resource utilization (ISRU)
strategies and future state-of-the-art impact models. This comprehensive
characterization serves as a foundational resource for future research efforts
in space science and mining.

<p>The layered honeycomb magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is the most promising
candidate for a Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL) that can host charge-neutral
Majorana fermions. Recent studies have shown significant sample dependence of
thermal transport properties, which are a key probe of Majorana quasiparticles
in the KQSL state, highlighting the importance of preparing high-quality single
crystals of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Here, we present a relatively simple and
reliable method to grow high-quality single crystals of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. We
use a two-step crystal growth method consisting of a purification process by
chemical vapor transport (CVT) and a main crystal growth process by
sublimation. The obtained crystals exhibit a distinct first-order structural
phase transition from the monoclinic ($C2/m$) to the rhombohedral ($R\bar{3}$)
structure at $\sim150$ K, which is confirmed by the nuclear quadrupole
resonance spectra with much sharper widths than previously reported. The Raman
spectra show the absence of defect-induced modes, supporting the good
crystallinity of our samples. The jumps in the thermal expansion coefficient
and specific heat at the antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at 7.6-7.7 K are
larger and sharper than those of previous samples grown by the CVT and Bridgman
methods and do not show any additional AFM transitions at 10-14 K due to
stacking faults. The longitudinal thermal conductivity in the AFM phase is
significantly larger than previously reported, indicating a very long mean free
path of heat carriers. All the results indicate that our single crystals are of
superior quality with good crystallinity and few stacking faults, which
provides a suitable platform for studying the Kitaev physics.

<p>Sapphire and rubies (undoped and Cr-doped $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ single
crystals) have been deformed in compression at temperatures lower than those
previously used in studies of dislocations in the basal slip plane (see part
I). Above 1400$^\circ$C, several features associating stacking faults out of
the basal planes and partial dislocations (dissociation, faulted dipoles) have
been observed in previous transmission electron microscope investigations. The
formation of these features involves climb controlled by atomic diffusion.
Properties of climb dissociated dislocations are discussed in relation with
dislocation dynamics. TEM examination of dislocation structures at lower
deformation temperatures (1000-1100$^\circ$C) shows that similar features are
formed but that they often imply cross-slip. A new mechanism for the formation
of faulted dipole by glide is presented and an explanation for the 30{\deg}
Peierls valley orientation is proposed. The presence of chromium has a small
influence on stacking fault energies on planes perpendicular to the basal
plane.

<p>In this paper, the origin of the threshold stress in pure 3 mol %-yttria
tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (YTZP) is analysed in detail. At this regard,
the two explanations reported in literature are discussed thoroughly. One of
them invokes dislocation activity as the origin for such quantity, whereas the
other one is based upon yttrium segregation at the grain boundaries. Crirical
assessment for both of them is performed, and it has allowed concluding that
the dislocation activity observed by Morita and Hiraga is just an artifact
created during sample preparation. Thence, segregation at the grain boundaries
seems to be the only mechanism accounting for a threshold stress and its
temperature and grain size dependence.

<i>Miguel Castillo Rodríguez, Jacques Castaing, Antonio Muñoz Bernabé, Patrick Veyssière, Arturo Domínguez Rodríguez</i>
<p>A model based on dislocation glide controlled by the nucleation and
propagation of kink pairs in a high Peierls stress crystal is revisited and
modified to account for changes in dislocation densities and segment lengths
with temperature and stress. It is applied to the critical resolved shear
stress (CRSS) for basal and prism plane slip in sapphire (alpha-Al2O3).
According to agreed-upon knowledge on dislocations in sapphire, basal slip and
prism plane slip are modelled with undissociated and dissociated dislocations,
respectively. In the latter case, partial dislocations move independently.
Amongst a number of sets of fitting parameters, good fits between experimental
and modelled CRSS9s are obtained in the long segment limit over the whole range
of temperatures by making use of physically sound parameters, including a
stress dependence of the dislocation density.

<p>Superconductivity in semiconductor nanostructures contains fascinating
physics due to the interplay between Andreev reflection, spin, and orbital
interactions. New material hybrids can access new quantum regimes and
phenomena. Here, we report the realization of epitaxial indium thin films on
PbTe nanowires.The film is continuous and forms an atomically sharp interface
with PbTe.Tunneling devices reveal a hard superconducting gap.The gap size,
1.08 to 1.18 meV, is twice as large as bulk indium (around 0.5 meV), due to the
presence of PbTe. A similar enhancement is also observed in the critical
temperature of In on a PbTe substrate. Zero bias conductance peaks appear at
finite magnetic fields. The effective g-factor (15 to 45) is notably enhanced
compared to bare PbTe wires (less than 10) due to the presence of In, differing
from Al-hybrids. Josephson devices exhibit gate-tunable supercurrents. The
PbTe-In hybrid enhances the properties of both, the superconductivity of In and
g-factors of PbTe, and thus may enable exotic phases of matter such as
topological superconductivity.

<h3>A novel and coupled Electromagnetic and Electrothermal software for  quench analysis of high field magnets</h3>

<i>Anang Dadhich, Philippe Fazilleau, Enric Pardo</i>
<p>High-field REBCO magnets contain several coils with many turns, and
electro-thermal quench is an issue that magnet designers need to take into
account. Thus, there is a need for a fast and accurate software to numerically
model the overall performance of full-scale magnets. High temperature
superconductors can be modeled using different techniques for electro-magnetic
(such as H-formulation and A-V formulation) and thermal (finite element method)
analysis. However, it takes a lot of time to model the electro-magnetic and
electro-thermal behavior of superconductors simultaneously in a commercial
software, especially for non-insulated or metal-insulated coils. We have
developed a novel software programmed in C++, which performs coupled
electro-magnetic and electro-thermal analysis using variational methods based
on Minimum Electro-Magnetic Entropy Production (MEMEP) and Finite Difference,
respectively. The developed software is applied to axi-symmetric fullscale
magnets of more than 30 T field strength for transient design (thermal quench
reliability), taking screening currents into account. We show that the magnets
incorporating non-insulated coils show less possibility of quench than the
metal insulated coils. Also, efficient cooling conditions at boundaries is
essential for such simulations. The model developed can be used for a quick and
complete electro-magnetic and electro-thermal analysis of superconducting high

<h3>Electrical conductivity of MgSiO3 at high temperatures and pressures:  implications for the Earth's mantle</h3>

<i>Samuel S. M. Santos, Lucy V. C. Assali, João F. Justo</i>
<p>The electrical conductivity of magnesium silicate MgSiO3 has been studied,
using the framework of the first-principles density functional theory and the
Boltzmann transport theory, under the thermodynamic conditions of the Earth's
lower mantle. We find that the conductivity of pristine MgSiO3 depends strongly
on the structural phase of the material, as well as on temperature and
pressure. The conductivity of the perovskite phase increases with increasing
pressure (depth of the lower mantle) up to 90 GPa, then decreases at higher
pressures due to a change in the material's band gap transition from direct to
indirect. Finally, the structural phase transition that MgSiO3 undergoes near
the bottom of the lower mantle, from perovskite to post-perovskite, causes an
increase in the conductivity of MgSiO3, which should contribute to the increase
in the electrical conductivity of the Earth's mantle under the thermodynamic
conditions of the Earth's D" layer.

<h3>Universal entanglement spectrum in gapless symmetry protected  topological states</h3>

<br>
<i>Xue-Jia Yu, Sheng Yang, Hai-Qing Lin, Shao-Kai Jian</i>
<p>Quantum entanglement marks a definitive feature of topological states.
However, the entanglement spectrum remains insufficiently explored for
topological states without a bulk energy gap. Using a combination of field
theory and numerical techniques, we accurately calculate and analyze the
entanglement spectrum of gapless symmetry protected topological states in one
dimension. We highlight that the universal entanglement spectrum not only
encodes the nontrivial edge degeneracy, generalizing the Li-Haldane conjecture
to gapless topological states, but also contains the operator content of the
underlying boundary conformal field theory. This implies that the bulk wave
function can act as a fingerprint of both quantum criticality and topology in
gapless symmetry protected topological states. We also identify a symmetry
enriched conformal boundary condition that goes beyond the conventional
conformal boundary condition.

<p>Van der Waals materials provide a versatile toolbox for the emergence of new
quantum phenomena and the fabrication of functional heterostructures. Among
them, the trihalide VI3 stands out for its unique magnetic and structural
landscape. Here we investigate the spin and orbital magnetic degrees of freedom
in the layered ferromagnet VI3 by means of temperature-dependent x-ray
absorption spectroscopy and x-ray magnetic circular and linear dichroism. We
detect localized electronic states and reduced magnetic dimensionality, due to
electronic correlations. We furthermore provide experimental evidence of (a) an
unquenched orbital magnetic moment (up to 0.66(7)) in the ferromagnetic state,
and (b) an instability of the orbital moment in proximity of the spin
reorientation transition. Our results support a coherent picture where
electronic correlations give rise to a strong magnetic anisotropy and a large
orbital moment, and establish VI3 as a prime candidate for the study of orbital
quantum effects.

<p>Single crystals of DyRh$_2$Si$_2$ and HoRh$_2$Si$_2$ were investigated by
thermal expansion and magnetostriction. The different types of magnetic order
can clearly be seen in these measurements, particularly the canting of the
moments away from the crystallographic $c$ direction below about 12~K and the
spin-flip for magnetic field applied along the $c$ direction. For
HoRh$_2$Si$_2$, an additional transition just below $T_{\rm N}$ is analyzed by
means of the Gr\"{u}neisen ratio and is likely caused by a change of the
magnetic structure. Our results nicely corroborate findings from other magnetic
and thermodynamic measurements on these materials and provide further evidence
suggesting the formation of magnetic domains.

<i>Gracie Chaney, Andrey Golov, Ambroise van Roekeghem, Javier Carrasco, Natalio Mingo</i>
<p>The structure and growth of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) region
between an electrolyte and an electrode is one of the most fundamental, yet
less-well understood phenomena in solid-state batteries. We present a
parameter-free atomistic simulation of the SEI growth for one of the currently
promising solid electrolytes (Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl), based on \textit{ab initio}
trained machine learning (ML) interatomic potentials, for over 30,000 atoms
during 10 ns, well-beyond the capabilities of conventional MD. This unveils a
two-step growth mechanism: Li-argyrodite chemical reaction leading to the
formation of an amorphous phase, followed by a kinetically slower
crystallization of the reaction products into a 5Li$_2$SLi$_3$PLiCl solid
solution. The simulation results support the recent, experimentally founded
hypothesis of an indirect pathway of electrolyte reduction. These findings shed
light on the intricate processes governing SEI evolution, providing a valuable
foundation for the design and optimization of next-generation solid-state
batteries.

<p>We report experimental and theoretical studies of MoTe$_2$-MoSe$_2$
heterobilayers with rigid moir\'e superlattices controlled by the twist angle.
Using an effective continuum model that combines resonant interlayer electron
tunneling with stacking-dependent moir\'e potentials, we identify the nature of
moir\'e excitons and the dependence of their energies, oscillator strengths and
Land\'e $g$-factors on the twist angle. Within the same framework, we interpret
distinct signatures of bound complexes among electrons and moir\'e excitons in
nearly collinear heterostacks. Our work provides fundamental understanding of
hybrid moir\'e excitons and trions in MoTe$_2$-MoSe$_2$ heterobilayers, and
establishes the material system as a prime candidate for optical studies of
correlated phenomena in moir\'e lattices.

<h3>A Mean-Field Study of Quantum Oscillations in Two-Dimensional Kondo  Insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04125" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04125</a>
<br>
<i>Kaize Wang, Yang Ge, Yashar Komijani</i>
<p>Magnetic oscillations in strongly correlated insulating systems have garnered
interest due to oscillations seemingly originating from the bulk, despite an
anticipated gapped spectrum. We use the large-$N$ mean-field theory to study
the behavior of normal and topological Kondo insulators under a magnetic field.
In both cases spinons acquire a charge and hybridize with electrons, producing
magnetic oscillations that resemble two-band noninteracting systems. We show
that in such band insulators magnetic oscillations are exponentially suppressed
at weak magnetic fields. A self-consistent mean-field calculation for the Kondo
insulators reveals that the temperature dependence of the oscillations departs
from the noninteracting case due to the temperature and magnetic-field
dependence of the hybridization, even though mean-field parameters remain
homogeneous at low fields. Larger magnetic fields result in the Kondo
breakdown, where the magnetic oscillation is solely due to the decoupled
conduction electrons. These findings offer new insights into the magnetic
properties of Kondo insulators, with implications for interpreting experimental
results in heavy fermion materials like SmB$_6$.

<h3>Balanced Quantum Hall Resistor</h3>

<br>
<i>Kajetan M. Fijalkowski, Nan Liu, Martin Klement, Steffen Schreyeck, Karl Brunner, Charles Gould, Laurens W. Molenkamp</i>
<p>The quantum anomalous Hall effect in magnetic topological insulators has been
recognized as a promising platform for applications in quantum metrology. The
primary reason for this is the electronic conductance quantization at zero
external magnetic field, which allows to combine it with the quantum standard
of voltage. Here we demonstrate a measurement scheme that increases the
robustness of the zero magnetic field quantum anomalous Hall resistor, allowing
for higher operational currents. This is achieved by simultaneous current
injection into the two disconnected perimeters of a multi-terminal Corbino
device to balance the electrochemical potential between the edges, screening
the electric field that drives back-scattering through the bulk, and thus
improving the stability of the quantization at increased currents. This
approach is not only applicable to devices based on the quantum anomalous Hall
effect, but more generally can also be applied to existing quantum resistance
standards that rely on the integer quantum Hall effect.

<h3>Quantitative Predictive Theories through Integrating Quantum,  Statistical, and Equilibrium, and Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics</h3>

<br>
<i>Zi-Kui Liu</i>
<p>Today's thermodynamics is largely based on the combined law for equilibrium
systems and statistical mechanics derived by Gibbs in 1873 and 1901,
respectively, while irreversible thermodynamics for nonequilibrium systems
resides essentially on the Onsager Theorem as a separate branch of
thermodynamics developed in 1930s. Between them, quantum mechanics was invented
and was quantitatively solved in terms of density functional theory (DFT) in
1960s. These three scientific domains operate based on different principles and
are very much separated from each other. In analogy to the parable of the blind
men and the elephant articulated by Perdew, they individually represent
different portions of a complex system and thus are incomplete by themselves
alone, resulting in the lack of quantitative agreement between their
predictions and experimental observations. Over the last two decades, the
author's group has developed a multiscale entropy approach (recently termed as
zentropy theory) that integrates DFT-based quantum mechanics and Gibbs
statistical mechanics and is capable of accurately predicting entropy and free
energy of complex systems. Furthermore, in combination with the combined law
for nonequilibrium systems developed by Hillert, the author developed the
theory of cross phenomena beyond the phenomenological Onsager Theorem. The
zentropy theory and theory of cross phenomena jointly provide quantitative
predictive theories for experimental observables as reviewed in the present
work.

<h3>Observation of the double quantum spin Hall phase in moiré WSe2</h3>

<br>
<i>Kaifei Kang, Yichen Qiu, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jie Shan, Kin Fai Mak</i>
<p>Quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators are a topologically protected phase of
matter in two dimensions that can support non-dissipative spin transport. A
hallmark of the phase is a pair of helical edge states surrounding an
insulating bulk. A higher (even) number of helical edge state pairs is usually
not possible in real materials because spin mixing would gap out the edge
states. Multiple pairs of helical edge states have been proposed in materials
with spin conservation symmetry and high spin Chern bands, but remained
experimentally elusive. Here, we demonstrate a QSH phase with one and two pairs
of helical edge states in twisted bilayer WSe2 at moir\'e hole filling factor
{\nu}= 2 and 4, respectively. We observe nearly quantized conductance or
resistance plateaus of h/({\nu}e^2 ) at {\nu} = 2 and 4 while the bulk is
insulating. The conductance is nearly independent of out-of-plane magnetic
field and decreases under an in-plane magnetic field. We also observe nonlocal
transport, which is sensitive only to the in-plane magnetic field. The results
agree with quantum transport of helical edge states protected by Ising spin
conservation symmetry and open a promising platform for low-power spintronics.

<h3>Functional renormalisation group approach to the finite-temperature Bose  polaron</h3>

<p>The non-perturbative functional renormalisation group (FRG) approach is
employed to study the Bose polaron problem at finite temperatures in the regime
of strong attractive bath-impurity interactions. Both two- and
three-dimensional configurations are considered. The appearance of two polaron
quasiparticle branches at finite temperatures is revealed, consistent with
recent findings by other analytical techniques. Then, ground-state polaron
energies are reported for selected interactions and temperatures within the gas
superfluid phase.

<h3>Ab initio calculation of the effective Coulomb interactions in MX2  (M=Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni; X=S, Se, Te): intrinsic magnetic ordering and  Mott insulating phase</h3>

<br>
<i>Afsaneh Karbalaee, Somayeh Belbasi, Hanif Hadipour</i>
<p>Correlated phenomena such as magnetism and Mott phase are a very
controversial issue in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDCs). With the aim of finding the value of correlation strength and
understanding the origin of ferromagnetic order in TMDCs, we first identify
relevant low-energy degrees of freedom on both octahedral T and trigonal
prismatic H lattices in MX2 (M=Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni; X=S, Se, Te) and then
determine the strength of the effective Coulomb interactions between localized
d electrons from the first principles using the constrained random-phase
approximation. The on-site Coulomb interaction (Hubbard U) values lie in the
range 1.4-3.7 eV (1.1-3.6 eV) and depend on the ground-state electronic
structure, d-electron number, and correlated subspace. For most of the TMDCs we
obtain 1 < U/W_b < 2 (the bandwidth W_b), which turn out to be larger than the
corresponding values in elementary transition metals. On the basis of the
calculated U and exchange J interaction, we have checked the condition to be
fulfilled for the formation of the ferromagnetic order by Stoner criterion. The
results indicate that experimentally observed MnX2 (X=S, Se) and VX2 (X=S, Se)
have an intrinsic ferromagnetic behavior in pristine form, although V-based
materials are close vicinity to the critical point separating ferromagnetic
from paramagnetic phase.

<h3>On the growing length scale in a replica-coupled glassforming liquid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04205" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04205</a>
<br>
<i>Niklas Küchler, Jürgen Horbach</i>
<p>Computer simulations are used to study a three-dimensional polydisperse model
glassformer in a replica-coupling setup where an attractive field $\propto -
\varepsilon Q$ of strength $\varepsilon$ can adjust the similarity of the
system to a fixed reference configuration with the overlap parameter $Q$. The
polydispersity in the model enables the efficient use of swap Monte Carlo in
combination with molecular-dynamics simulation from which we obtain fully
equilibrated liquid configurations at very low temperature, i.e., far below the
critical temperature of mode-coupling theory, $T_{\rm MCT}$. When the
$\varepsilon$-field is switched on, the fast dynamics with swaps allow
relaxation to the stationary state at temperatures below $T_{\rm MCT}$. In the
stationary state, the overlap $Q$ has a finite value that increases with
increasing $\varepsilon$. For a given temperature $T$, fluctuations of the
overlap around the average value become maximal at a critical field strength
$\varepsilon^\star(T)$. With decreasing $T$ along this
$\varepsilon^\star(T)$-line, overlap fluctuations increase and a transition
from a unimodal overlap distribution to a bimodal shape occurs. We give
evidence that these bimodal distributions are not due to first-order phase
transitions. However, they reflect finite-size effects due to a rapidly growing
length scale with decreasing temperature. We discuss the significance of this
length scale for the understanding of the glass transition.

<br>
<i>Sarath Sankar, Corentin Bertrand, Antoine Georges, Eran Sela, Yigal Meir</i>
<p>The Anderson overlap catastrophe (AOC) is a many-body effect arising as a
result of a shakeup of a Fermi sea due to an abrupt change of a local
potential, leading to a power-law dependence of the density of states on
energy. Here we demonstrate that a standard quantum-dot detector can be
employed as a highly tuneable probe of the AOC, where the power law can be
continuously modified by a gate voltage. We show that signatures of the AOC
have already appeared in previous experiments, and give explicit predictions
allowing to tune and pinpoint their non-perturbative aspects.

<h3>Universal distribution of the number of minima for random walks and  Lévy flights</h3>

<br>
<i>Anupam Kundu, Satya N. Majumdar, Gregory Schehr</i>
<p>We compute exactly the full distribution of the number $m$ of local minima in
a one-dimensional landscape generated by a random walk or a L\'evy flight. We
consider two different ensembles of landscapes, one with a fixed number of
steps $N$ and the other till the first-passage time of the random walk to the
origin. We show that the distribution of $m$ is drastically different in the
two ensembles (Gaussian in the former case, while having a power-law tail in
the latter $m^{-3/2}$ in the latter case). However, the most striking aspect of
our results is that, in each case, the distribution is completely universal for
all $m$ (and not just for large $m$), i.e., independent of the jump
distribution in the random walk. This means that the distributions are exactly
identical for L\'evy flights and random walks with finite jump variance. Our
analytical results are in excellent agreement with our numerical simulations.

<h3>Geometric theory of (extended) time-reversal symmetries in stochastic  processes -- Part I: finite dimension</h3>

<br>
<i>Jérémy O'Byrne, Michael E. Cates</i>
<p>In this article, we analyze three classes of time-reversal of a Markov
process with Gaussian noise on a manifold. We first unveil a commutativity
constraint for the most general of these time-reversals to be well defined.
Then we give a triad of necessary and sufficient conditions for the stochastic
process to be time-reversible. While most reversibility conditions in the
literature require knowledge of the stationary probability, our conditions do
not, and therefore can be analytically checked in a systematic way. We then
show that the mathematical objects whose cancellation is required by our
reversibility conditions play the role of independent sources of entropy
production. Furthermore, we give a geometric interpretation of the so-called
irreversible cycle-affinity as the vorticity of a certain vector field for a
Riemannian geometry given by the diffusion tensor. We also discuss the relation
between the time-reversability of the stochastic process and that of an
associated deterministic dynamics: its Stratonovitch average. Finally, we show
that a suitable choice of a reference measure - that can be considered as a
prior or a gauge, depending on the context - allows to study a stochastic
process in a way that is both coordinate-free and independent of the
prescription used to define stochastic integrals. When this reference measure
plays the role of a gauge choice, we interpret our previous results through the
lens of gauge theory and prove them to be gauge-invariant.

<h3>First-principles phase diagram of an interacting ionic chain</h3>

<i>Jamin Kidd, Ruiqi Zhang, Shao-Kai Jian, Jianwei Sun</i>
<p>The widely-used Kohn-Sham implementation of density functional theory (DFT)
maps a system of interacting electrons onto an auxiliary non-interacting one
and is presumably inaccurate for strongly correlated materials. We present a
concrete benchmark for DFT by examining the electronic ground state phase
diagram of a strongly interacting chain with uneven, non-integer nuclear
charges. The interplay between charge imbalance and Coulomb repulsion yields
two competing phases, a band insulator and a Mott insulator. By including
infinitesimal lattice distortions, DFT stabilizes the intermediate
spontaneously dimerized insulator phase that results from this competition. We
assess the phase diagram by mapping the bond length and nuclear charge ratio of
the chain to the ionic Hubbard model and performing highly accurate density
matrix renormalization group calculations. Our study demonstrates that explicit
symmetry breaking can be used as a tool to predict phase diagrams with
competing orders from DFT.
