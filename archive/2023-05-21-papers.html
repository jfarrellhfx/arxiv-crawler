<h3>Spectral form factors of unconventional superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11179" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11179</a>
<br>
<i>Sankalp Gaur, Victor Gurarie</i>

We show that spectral form factors of unconventional gapped superconductors
have singularities occurring periodically in time. These are the
superconductors whose gap function vanishes somewhere in momentum space
(Brillouin zone) but whose fermionic excitation spectrum is fully gapped. Many,
although not all, of these superconductors are topologically nontrivial. In
contrast, conventional fully gapped superconductors have featureless spectral
form factors which are analytic in time. Some gapless superconductors may also
have singularities in their spectral form factors, but they are not as
ubiquitous and their appearance may depend on the details of the interactions
among fermionic particles which form the superconductor and on the underlying
lattice where the particles move. This work builds on the prior publication [1]
where Loschmidt echo of topological superconductors, related but not identical
to spectral form factors, was studied. It follows that spectral form factors
could be used as a test of the structure of the superconducting gap functions.

<h3>Compass-like manipulation of electronic nematicity in Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11210" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11210</a>
<br>
<i>Masahiro Naritsuka, Izidor Benedičič, Luke C. Rhodes, Carolina A. Marques, Christopher Trainer, Zhiwei Li, Alexander C. Komarek, Peter Wahl</i>
<br>
<br>
Electronic nematicity has been found in a wide range of strongly correlated
electron materials, resulting in the electronic states having a symmetry that
is lower than that of the crystal that hosts them. One of the most astonishing
examples is Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$, in which a small in-plane component of a
magnetic field induces significant resistivity anisotropy. The direction of
this anisotropy follows the direction of the in-plane field. The microscopic
origin of this field-induced nematicity has been a long-standing puzzle, with
recent experiments suggesting a field-induced spin density wave driving the
anisotropy. Here, we report spectroscopic imaging of a field-controlled
anisotropy of the electronic structure at the surface of Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$. We
track the electronic structure as a function of the direction of the field,
revealing a continuous change with field angle. This continuous evolution
suggests a mechanism based on spin-orbit coupling resulting in compass-like
control of the electronic bands. The anisotropy of the electronic structure
persists to temperatures about an order of magnitude higher compared to the
bulk, demonstrating novel routes to stabilize such phases over a wider
temperature range.

<h3>Assembling Kitaev honeycomb spin liquids from arrays of 1D symmetry  protected topological phases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11221" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11221</a>
<br>
<i>Yue Liu, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Kevin Slagle, David F. Mross, Jason Alicea</i>
<br>
<br>
The Kitaev honeycomb model, which is exactly solvable by virtue of an
extensive number of conserved quantities, supports a gapless quantum spin
liquid phase as well as gapped descendants relevant for fault-tolerant quantum
computation. We show that the anomalous edge modes of 1D cluster-state-like
symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases provide natural building blocks for
a variant of the Kitaev model that enjoys only a subextensive number of
conserved quantities. The symmetry of our variant allows a single additional
nearest-neighbor perturbation, corresponding to an anisotropic version of the
$\Gamma$ term studied in the context of Kitaev materials. We determine the
phase diagram of the model using exact diagonalization. Additionally, we use
DMRG to show that the underlying 1D SPT building blocks can emerge from a
ladder Hamiltonian exhibiting only two-spin interactions supplemented by a
Zeeman field. Our approach may inform a new pathway toward realizing Kitaev
honeycomb spin liquids in spin-orbit-coupled Mott insulators.

<h3>Point-Gap Bound States in Non-Hermitian Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11227" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11227</a>
<br>
<i>Zixi Fang, Chen Fang, Kai Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, we systematically investigate the impurity-induced bound
states in 1D non-Hermitian systems. By establishing an exact relationship
between impurity potential and bound-state energy, we determine the minimum
impurity potential required to generate bound states within each point energy
gap. We demonstrate that the presence of Bloch saddle points necessitates a
finite threshold of impurity potential; otherwise, infinitesimal impurity
potential can create bound states. Furthermore, we show that the bound states
residing in the point gaps with nonzero spectral winding exhibit sensitivity to
boundary conditions and will be squeezed towards the edges when the boundaries
are opened, indicating the bulk-boundary correspondence in terms of point-gap
topology.

<h3>Dipole Screening in Pure Shear Strain Protocols of Amorphous Solids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11253" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11253</a>
<br>
<i>Chandana Mondal, Michael Moshe, Itamar Procaccia, Saikat Roy</i>
<br>
<br>
When amorphous solids are subjected to simple or pure strain, they exhibit
elastic increase in stress, punctuated by plastic events that become denser (in
strain) upon increasing the system size. It is customary to assume in
theoretical models that the stress released in each plastic event is
redistributed according to the linear Eshelby kernel, causing avalanches of
additional stress release. Here we demonstrate that contrary to the uniform
affine strain resulting from simple or pure strain, each plastic event is
associated with a non-uniform strain that gives rise to a displacement field
that contains quadrupolar and dipolar charges that typically screen the linear
elastic phenomenology and introduce anomalous length-scales and influence the
form of the stress redistribution. An important question that opens up is how
to take this into account in elasto-plastic models of shear induced phenomena
like shear-banding.

<h3>Energy dissipation in high speed impact on granular media</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11269" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11269</a>
<br>
<i>Manish Kumar Mandal, Saikat Roy</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we thoroughly investigate the impact process on the granular
media in the limit when the ratio of the impact velocity to the acoustic speed
becomes of the order of 0.01-1, which is far greater than the existing
literature (0.0001-0.001). We show that the energy dissipation is largely due
to the energy cost associated with the exploration between different metastable
states via large scale reorganization of the force chain network. In this
regime, the conventional drag force models break down, and the drag force can
not be decomposed into a depth dependent static pressure and a depth
independent inertial drag as proposed in the existing literature. The high
dynamical stress generates acoustic pulses, which propagate longer distances
rather than decaying exponentially, as observed in the previous works. In the
latter stage of the impact process, the boundary also plays an essential role
in the reorganization of the force chains as the reflected acoustic pulses
interact with the original impact pulses. Furthermore, we study the scaling of
the early stage peak forces with the impact velocity and find that spatial
dimensionality strongly influences the scaling.

<h3>Kinetic Pathway and Micromechanics of Vesicle Fusion/Fission</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11270" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11270</a>
<br>
<i>Luofu Liu, Chao Duan, Rui Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
Despite the wide existence of vesicles in living cells as well as their
important applications like drug-delivery, the underlying mechanism of vesicle
fusion/fission remains under debate. Here, we develop a constrained
self-consistent field theory (SCFT) which allows tracking the shape evolution
and free energy as a function of center-of-mass separation distance. Fusion and
fission are described in a unified framework. Both the kinetic pathway and the
mechanical response can be simultaneously captured. By taking vesicles formed
by polyelectrolytes as a model system, we predict discontinuous transitions
between the three morphologies: parent vesicle with a single cavity,
hemifission/hemifusion and two separated child vesicles, as a result of
breaking topological isomorphism. With the increase of inter-vesicle repulsion,
we observe a great reduction of the cleavage energy, indicating that vesicle
fission can be achieved without hemifission, in good agreement with simulation.
The force-extension relationship elucidates typical plasticity for separating
two vesicles. The super extensibility in the mechanical response of vesicle is
in stark contrast to soft particles with other morphologies such as cylinder
and sphere.

<h3>Jensen bound for the entropy production rate in stochastic  thermodynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11287" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11287</a>
<br>
<i>Matthew P. Leighton, David A. Sivak</i>
<br>
<br>
Bounding and estimating entropy production has long been an important goal of
nonequilibrium thermodynamics. We recently derived a lower bound on the total
and subsystem entropy production rates of continuous stochastic systems. This
`Jensen bound' has led to fundamental limits on the performance of collective
transport systems and permitted thermodynamic inference of free-energy
transduction between components of bipartite molecular machines. Our original
derivation relied on a number of assumptions, which restricted the bound's
regime of applicability. Here we derive the Jensen bound far more generally for
multipartite overdamped Langevin dynamics. We then consider several extensions,
allowing for position-dependent diffusion coefficients, underdamped dynamics,
and non-multipartite overdamped dynamics. Our results extend the Jensen bound
to a far broader class of systems.

<h3>Slowly decaying zero mode in a weakly non-integrable boundary impurity  model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11325" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11325</a>
<br>
<i>Hsiu-Chung Yeh, Gabriel Cardoso, Leonid Korneev, Dries Sels, Alexander G. Abanov, Aditi Mitra</i>
<br>
<br>
The transverse field Ising model (TFIM) on the half-infinite chain possesses
an edge zero mode. This work considers an impurity model -- TFIM perturbed by a
boundary integrability breaking interaction. For sufficiently large transverse
field, but in the ordered phase of the TFIM, the zero mode is observed to
decay. The decay is qualitatively different from zero modes where the
integrability breaking interactions are non-zero all along the chain. It is
shown that for the impurity model, the zero mode decays by relaxing to a
non-local quasi-conserved operator, the latter being exactly conserved when the
opposite edge of the chain has no non-commuting perturbations so as to ensure
perfect degeneracy of the spectrum. In the thermodynamic limit, the
quasi-conserved operator vanishes, and a regime is identified where the decay
of the zero mode obeys Fermi's Golden Rule. A toy model for the decay is
constructed in Krylov space and it is highlighted how Fermi's Golden Rule may
be recovered from this toy model.

<br>
Noncollinear antiferromagnets with novel magnetic orders, vanishingly small
net magnetization and exotic spin related properties hold enormous promise for
developing next-generation, transformative spintronic applications. A major
ongoing research focus of this community is to explore, control, and harness
unconventional magnetic phases of this emergent material system to deliver
state-of-the-art functionalities for modern microelectronics. Here we report
direct imaging of magnetic domains of polycrystalline Mn3Sn films, a
prototypical noncollinear antiferromagnet, using nitrogen-vacancy-based
single-spin scanning microscopy. Nanoscale evolution of local stray field
patterns of Mn3Sn samples are systematically investigated in response to
external driving forces, revealing the characteristic "heterogeneous" magnetic
switching behaviors in polycrystalline textured Mn3Sn films. Our results
contribute to a comprehensive understanding of inhomogeneous magnetic orders of
noncollinear antiferromagnets, highlighting the potential of nitrogen-vacancy
centers to study microscopic spin properties of a broad range of emergent
condensed matter systems.

<h3>Pyrovskite: A software package for the high throughput construction,  analysis, and featurization of two- and three-dimensional perovskite systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11354" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11354</a>
<br>
<i>Robert Stanton, Dhara J. Trivedi</i>
<br>
<br>
The increased computational and experimental interest in perovskite systems
comprising novel phases and reduced dimensionality has greatly expanded the
search space for this class of materials. In similar fields, unified frameworks
exist for the procedural generation and subsequent analysis of these complex
condensed matter systems. Given the relatively recent rise in popularity of
these novel perovskite phases, such a framework has yet to be created. In this
work, we introduce Pyrovskite, an open source software package to aid in both
the high-throughput and fine-grained generation, simulation, and subsequent
analysis of this expanded family of perovskite systems. Additionally we
introduce a new descriptor for octahedral distortions in systems including but
not limited to perovskites. This descriptor quantifies diagonal displacements
of the B-site cation in a BX$_6$ octahedral coordination environment, which has
been shown to contribute to increased Rashba-Dresselhaus splitting in
perovskite systems.

<h3>Estimating relaxation times from a single trajectory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11357" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11357</a>
<br>
<i>Takuma Akimoto, Eiji Yamamoto, Takashi Uneyama</i>
<br>
<br>
Complex systems such as protein conformational fluctuations and supercooled
liquids exhibit a long relaxation time and are considered to posses multiple
relaxation times. We analytically obtain the exact correlation function for
stochastic processes with multiple relaxation times. We show that the
time-averaged correlation function calculated by a trajectory whose length is
shorter than the longest relaxation time exhibits an apparent aging behavior.
We propose a method to extract relaxation times from a single trajectory. This
method successfully extracts relaxation times of a stochastic process with
multiple states when a state can be characterized by the values of the
trajectory. As an application of this method, we estimate several relaxation
times smaller than the longest relaxation time in conformational fluctuations
of a small protein.

<h3>Leveraging static quantum many-body scars into period-doubled responses</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11368" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11368</a>
<br>
<i>Wentai Deng, Zhi-Cheng Yang</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a scheme that generates period-doubled responses via periodically
driving certain Hamiltonians hosting quantum many-body scars, akin to recent
experimental observations in driven Rydberg atom arrays. Our construction takes
advantage of an su(2) spectrum generating algebra associated with the static
quantum-scarred Hamiltonian, which enacts a $\pi$-rotation within the scar
subspace after one period of time evolution with appropriately chosen driving
parameters. This yields period-doubled (subharmonic) responses in local
observables for any choice of initial state residing in the scar subspace. The
quasienergy spectrum features atypical $\pi$-paired eigenstates embedded in an
otherwise fully thermal spectrum.The protocol requires neither a large driving
frequency nor a large driving amplitude, and is thus distinct from the
prethermalization physics in previous investigations of the driven PXP model.
We demonstrate our scheme using several spin-1/2 and spin-1 quantum scarred
models possessing an exact su(2) spectrum generating algebra, as well as a
symmetry-deformed PXP model, where the su(2) algebra is only approximate. Our
results extend the class of models hosting quantum many-body scars that can be
leveraged to yield time-crystalline behaviors under periodic driving.

<h3>Diffusiophoresis-Enhanced Turing Patterns</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11372" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11372</a>
<br>
<i>Benjamin M. Alessio, Ankur Gupta</i>
<br>
<br>
Turing patterns are fundamental in biophysics, emerging from short-range
activation and long-range inhibition processes. However, their paradigm is
based on diffusive transport processes, which yields Turing patters that are
less sharp than the ones observed in nature. A complete physical description of
why the Turing patterns observed in nature are significantly sharper than
state-of-the-art models remains unknown. Here, we propose a novel solution to
this phenomenon by investigating the role of diffusiophoresis in Turing
patterns. The inclusion of diffusiophoresis enables one to generate patterns of
colloidal particles with significantly finer length scales than the
accompanying chemical patterns. Further, diffusiophoresis enables a robust
degree of control that closely mimics natural patterns observed in species like
the Ornate Boxfish and the Jewel Moray Eel. We present a scaling analysis
indicating that chromatophores, ubiquitous in biological pattern formation, are
likely diffusiophoretic, and that colloidal P\'eclet number controls the
pattern enhancement. This discovery suggests important features of biological
pattern formation can be explained with a universal mechanism that is
quantified straightforwardly from the fundamental physics of colloids and
inspires future exploration of adaptive materials, lab-on-a-chip devices, and
tumorigenesis.

<h3>Size distributions reveal regime transition of lake systems under  different dominant driving forces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11376" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11376</a>
<br>
<i>Shengjie Hu, Zhenlei Yang, Sergio Torres, Zipeng Wang, Ling Li</i>
<br>
<br>
Power law size distribution is found to associate with fractal,
self-organized behaviors and patterns of complex systems. Such distribution
also emerges from natural lakes, with potentially important links to the
dynamics of lake systems. But the driving mechanism that generates and shapes
this feature in lake systems remains unclear. Moreover, the power law itself
was found inadequate for fully describing the size distribution of lakes, due
to deviations at the two ends of size range. Based on observed and simulated
lakes in 11 hydro-climatic zones of China, we established a conceptual model
for lake systems, which covers the whole size range of lake size distribution
and reveals the underlying driving mechanism. The full lake size distribution
is composed of three components, with three phases featured by exponential,
stretched-exponential and power law distribution. The three phases represent
system states with successively increasing degrees of heterogeneity and
orderliness, and more importantly, indicate the dominance of exogenic and
endogenic forces, respectively. As the dominant driving force changes from
endogenic to exogenic, a phase transition occurs with lake size distribution
shifted from power law to stretched-exponential and further to exponential
distribution. Apart from compressing the power law phase, exogenic force also
increases its scaling exponent, driving the corresponding lake size power
spectrum into the regime of blue noise. During this process, the
autocorrelation function of the lake system diverges with a possibility of
going to infinity, indicating the loss of system resilience.

<h3>Emergence of long-range magnetic order from spin-glass state by tuning  electron density in a stoichiometric Ga-based quasicrystal approximant</h3>

This study reports the first observation of ferromagnetic (FM) order in the
non-Au-based approximant crystals (ACs) using a novel approach whereby a total
electron-per-atom (e/a) ratio of the spin-glass Ga50Pd36Gd14 1/1 AC is lowered
by simultaneously substituting certain ratios of a tri-valent Ga and a
zero-valent Pd by a mono-valent Au. The emergence of FM order by this method
was confirmed via magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, and specific heat
measurements. The findings of this study open up vast opportunities in
developing long-range magnetic orders from stoichiometric ACs, quasicrystals,
and even other RKKY compounds with spin-glass ground state.

<h3>A stable and low loss oxide for superconducting qubits</h3>

<br>
<br>
The dielectric loss of amorphous oxide layers is a major limiting factor for
the coherent time of superconducting qubits. Usually, the surface oxides of
superconductor film are lossy and unstable in air. To increase the coherence
time, it is essential for qubits to have stable and low dielectric loss oxides,
either as barrier or passivation layers. Here, we demonstrate that a kind of
amorphous tantalum oxide on Ta film is robust and stable by means of chemical
and structural analysis. Such kind of oxide layer forms in a self-limiting
process on the surface of {\alpha}-Ta (110) film in piranha solution, yielding
stable thickness and steady chemical composition. Quarter-wavelength coplanar
waveguide resonators are made to study the loss of this oxide. An internal
quality factor of above three million is measured at single photon level for
fresh device, and it is still over two million even after exposed to air for
months. Furthermore, we propose a method to fabricate all-tantalum
superconducting qubits using this kind of oxide as the dielectric and
passivation layers.

<h3>DFT + U Study of structural, electronic, optical and magnetic properties  of LiFePO4 Cathode materials for Lithium-Ion batteries</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11459" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11459</a>
<br>
<i>A.K. Wabeto, K.N. Nigussa, L.D. Deja</i>
<br>
<br>
In this study, we have employed a DFT+U calculation using quantum-espresso
(QE) code to investigate the structural, electronic, optical, and magnetic
properties of LiFePO$\rm_{4}$ cathode material for Li-ion batteries. Crystals
of LiFePO$\rm_{4}$ and related materials have recently received a lot of
attention due to their very promising use as cathodes in rechargeable
lithium-ion batteries. The structural optimization was performed and the
equilibrium parameters such as the lattice constants, and the bulk modulus are
calculated using QE code and found to be a=4.76 {\AA}, b=6.00 {\AA}, c=10.28
{\AA}, B=90.2 GPa, respectively. The projected density of states (PDOS) for the
LiFePO$\rm_{4}$ material is remarkably similar to experimental results in
literature showing the transition metal $3d$ states forming narrow bands above
the O $2p$ band. The results of the various spin configurations suggested that
the ferromagnetic configuration can serve as a useful approximation for
studying the general features of these systems. In the absence of Li, the
majority spin transition metal $3d$ states are well-hybridized with the O 2p
band in FePO$\rm_{4}$. The result obtained with a DFT + U showed that LiFePO4
is direct band gap materials with a band gap of 3.82 eV, which is within the
range of the experimental values. The PDOS analyses show qualitative
information about the crystal field splitting and bond hybridization and help
rationalize the understanding of the structural, electronic, optical, and
magnetic properties of the LiFePO$\rm_{4}$ as a novel cathode material. On the
basis of the predicted optical absorbance, reflection, refractive index, and
energy loss function, LiFePO$\rm_{4}$ is demonstrated to be viable and
cost-effective, which is very suitable as a cathode material for Li-ion
battery.

<br>
This paper presents the findings of the synthesis of multicomponent (Al, W,
Ni, Ti, Nb) alloy coatings from mosaic targets. For the study, a pulsed
magnetron sputtering method was employed under different plasma generation
conditions: modulation frequency (10 Hz and 1000 Hz), and power (600 W and 1000
W). The processes achieved two types of alloy coatings, high entropy and
classical alloys. After the deposition processes, scanning electron microscopy,
X-ray diffraction, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy techniques were
employed to find the morphology, thickness, and chemical and phase compositions
of the coatings. Nanohardness and its related parameters, namely H3.Er2, H.E,
and 1.Er2H ratios, were measured. An annealing treatment was performed to
estimate the stability range for the selected coatings. The results indicated
the formation of as-deposited coatings exhibiting an amorphous structure as a
single-phase solid solution. The process parameters had an influence on the
resulting morphology-a dense and homogenous as well as a columnar morphology,
was obtained. The study compared the properties of high-entropy alloy (HEA)
coatings and classical alloy coatings concerning their structure and chemical
and phase composition. It was found that the change of frequency modulation and
the post-annealing process contributed to the increase in the hardness of the
material in the case of HEA coatings.

Highly efficient and sustainable resources of energy are of great demand
today to combat with environmental pollution and the energy crisis. In this
work, we have examined the novel 2D Janus AsTeX (X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers
using first-principles calculations and explore their potential energy
conversion applications. We have demonstrated the thermal, energetic, dynamic
and mechanical stability of AsTeX (X = Cl, Br, and I) monolayers. Janus AsTeX
(X = Cl, Br and I) monolayers are indirect bandgap semiconductors with high
carrier mobilities and excellent visible light optical absorption. Our findings
demonstrate that the Janus AsTeCl and AsTeBr monolayers exhibits low lattice
thermal conductivity and excellent electronic transport properties obtained
using semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory including various scattering
mechanism. Additionally, the redox potential of water is adequately engulfed by
the band alignments of the AsTeCl and AsTeBr monolayers. The water splitting
process under illumination can proceeds spontaneously on Janus AsTeBr
monolayer, while a minimal low external potential (0.26-0.29 eV) is required to
trigger water splitting process on Janus AsTeCl monolayer. A more than 10% STH
efficiency of these monolayers indicate their potential practical applications
in the commercial production of hydrogen. Thus, our study demonstrates that
these monolayers can show potential applications in energy conversion fields.

various exciting phenomena to investigate, it's simultaneously challenging to
make stable bio-spinterfaces, as biomolecules are sensitive to many factors
that it encounters during thin-film growth to device fabrication. The
chirality-induced spin-selectivity (CISS) effect is an exciting discovery
demonstrating an understanding that a specific electron's spin (either UP or
DOWN) passes through a chiral molecule. The present work utilizes Ustilago
maydis Rvb2 protein, an ATP-dependent DNA helicase (also known as Reptin) for
the fabrication of bio-spintronic devices to investigate spin-selective
electron transport through protein. Ferromagnetic materials are well-known for
showing spin-polarization, which many chiral and biomolecules can mimic. We
report spin-selective electron transmission through Rvb2 that exhibits 30% spin
polarization at a low bias (+ 0.5 V) in a device configuration, Ni/Rvb2
protein/ITO measured under two different magnetic configurations. Our findings
demonstrate that biomolecules can be put in circuit components without any
expensive vacuum deposition for the top contact. Thus, it holds a remarkable
potential to advance spin-selective electron transport in other biomolecules
such as proteins, and peptides for biomedical applications.

<h3>Unraveling the magnetic structure of YbNiSn single crystal via crystal  growth and neutron diffraction</h3>

Neutron and x-ray diffraction experiments were performed on the ternary
intermetallic compound YbNiSn, formerly categorized as a ferromagnetic Kondo
compound. At zero field, an increase in scattering intensity was observed on
top of allowed and forbidden nuclear reflections below Tc, breaking the
reflection condition of the crystal symmetry Pnma. This indicates that the
magnetic structure of YbNiSn is antiferromagnetic-type, rather than the
previously proposed simple collinear ferromagnetic structure. Temperature
dependence of the scattering intensity of the 011 reflection confirmed the
magnetic ordering at 5.77(2) K. No incommensurate satellite reflection was
observed at 2.5 K. By applying external magnetic field of 1 T along the a axis,
the magnetic intensity at the nuclear-forbidden 001 position was suppressed,
while a slight enhancement at the nuclear-allowed 002 position was observed.
This suggests a spin-flip transition under the external magnetic field along
the a axis in YbNiSn. The proposed magnetic structures at zero field and 1 T
correspond to the magnetic space groups of Pn'm'a and Pnm'a', respectively. The
piezomagnetic effect and the switch between the two magnetic space groups by
the external stress, which could be detected by the anomalous Hall effect, are
proposed.

<h3>Controlling the excitation spectrum of a quantum dot array with a photon  cavity</h3>

<br>
<br>
We use a recently proposed quantum electrodynamical density functional theory
(QEDFT) functional in a real-time excitation calculation for a two-dimensional
electron gas in a square array of quantum dots in an external constant
perpendicular magnetic field to model the influence of cavity photons on the
excitation spectra of the system. The excitation is generated by a short
elecrical pulse. The quantum dot array is defined in an AlGaAs-GaAs
heterostructure, which is in turn embedded in a parallel plate far-infrared
photon-microcavity. The required exchange and correlation energy functionals
describing the electron-electron and electron-photon interactions have
therefore been adapted for a two-dimensional electron gas in a homogeneous
external magnetic field. We predict that the energies of the excitation modes
activated by the pulse are generally red-shifted to lower values in the
presence of a cavity. The red-shift can be understood in terms of the
polarization of the electron charge by the cavity photons and depends on the
magnetic flux, the number of electrons in a unit cell of the lattice, and the
electron-photon interaction strength. We find an interesting interplay of the
exchange forces in a spin polarized two-dimensional electron gas and the square
lattice structure leading to a small but clear blue-shift of the excitation
mode spectra when one electron resides in each dot.

Identification of novel multiferroic materials with high-ordering
temperatures remains at the forefront of condensed matter physics research. In
this regard, the antiferromagnetic RCrO$_3$ compounds (like GdCrO$_3$)
constitute a promising class of multiferroic compounds, which, however, mostly
become ferroelectric concomitant with the antiferromagnetic ordering much below
room-temperature, arising from a subtle competition between the ferroelectric
off-centering mode and a non-polar antiferrodistortive rotation mode that
inhibits ferroelectricity. Recently, room-temperature ferroelectricity of
structural origin, arising from off-centering displacements of R and Cr ions,
has been identified in spark-plasma sintered GdCrO$_3$ [Suryakanta Mishra et
al., Phys. Rev. B 104, L180101 (2021)]. Interestingly, some of the
experimentally observed non-ferroelectric RCrO$_3$ compounds have been
theoretically predicted to host similar ferroelectric instabilities. Here, we
have identified two such non-ferroelectric RCrO3 compounds, one DyCrO$_3$
(which is reported as a quantum paraelectric) and another LaCrO$_3$ (which is
paraelectric), and using a modified synthesis protocol involving
spark-plasma-sintering (SPS), we have been successful in engineering an
intrinsic room-temperature ferroelectricity in the paramagnetic state, driven
by noncentrosymmetric structural phase in both SPS sintered DyCrO$_3$ and
LaCrO$_3$, in contrast to room-temperature paraelectricity in solid-state
synthesized DyCrO$_3$ and LaCrO$_3$. While the ferroelectricity in SPS-prepared
DyCrO$_3$ and LaCrO$_3$ is stable at room-temperature, it undergoes an
irreversible transition from a ferroelectric (Pna2$_1$) phase to a paraelectric
(Pbnm) phase at 440 K. Significantly, SPS-sintered LaCrO$_3$, which undergoes
antiferromagnetic ordering at 290 K, emerges as a promising near
room-temperature multiferroic material.

<h3>Phononic Switching of Magnetization by the Ultrafast Barnett Effect</h3>

The Barnett effect, discovered more than a century ago, describes how an
inertial body with otherwise zero net magnetic moment acquires spontaneous
magnetization when mechanically spinning. Breakthrough experiments have
recently shown that an ultrashort laser pulse destroys the magnetization of an
ordered ferromagnet within hundreds of femtoseconds, with the spins losing
angular momentum to circularly-polarized optical phonons as part of the
ultrafast Einstein-de Haas effect. However, the prospect of using such
high-frequency vibrations of the lattice to reciprocally switch magnetization
in a nearby magnetic medium has not yet been experimentally explored. Here we
show that the spontaneous magnetization temporarily gained via the ultrafast
Barnett effect, through the resonant excitation of circularly-polarized optical
phonons in paramagnetic substrates, can be used to permanently reverse the
magnetic state of the substrate-mounted heterostructure. With the handedness of
the phonons steering the direction of magnetic switching, the ultrafast Barnett
effect offers a selective and potentially universal method for exercising
ultrafast non-local control over magnetic order.

<h3>Photocatalytic Properties of Anisotropic $β$-PtX$_2$ (X= S, Se) and  Janus $β$-PtSSe monolayers</h3>

The highly efficient photocatalytic water splitting to produce clean energy
requires novel semiconductor materials to achieve high solar-to-hydrogen energy
conversion efficiency. Herein, the photocatalytic properties of anisotropic
$\beta$-PtX$_2$ (X=S, Se) and Janus $\beta$-PtSSe monolayers are investigated
based on density functional theory. Small cleavage energy for \{beta}-PtS2
(0.44 J/m2) and $\beta$-PtSe$_2$ (0.40 J/m$^2$) endorses the possibility of
their mechanical exfoliation from respective layered bulk material. The
calculated results find \{beta}-PtX2 monolayers to have an appropriate bandgap
(~1.8-2.6 eV) enclosing the water redox potential, light absorption
coefficients (~104 cm$^{-1}$), and excitons binding energy (~0.5-0.7 eV), which
facilitates excellent visible-light driven photocatalytic performance.
Remarkably, an inherent structural anisotropy leads to the anisotropic and high
carrier mobility (up to ~5 x 10$^3$ cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ S$^{-1}$) leading to fast
transport of photogenerated carriers. Notably, the small required external
potential to derive hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction
processes with an excellent solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency of
$\beta$-PtSe$_2$ (~16%) and $\beta$-PtSSe (~18%) makes them promising
candidates for solar water splitting applications.

<h3>First Principles Study of 2D Ring-Te and its Electrical Contact with  Topological Dirac Semimetal</h3>

In recent years, researchers have manifested their interest in the
two-dimensional (2D) mono-elemental materials of group-VI elements because of
their excellent optoelectronic, photovoltaic and thermoelectric properties.
Despite the intensive recent research efforts, there is still a possibility of
novel 2D allotropes of these elements due to their multivalency nature. Here,
we have predicted a novel 2D allotrope of tellurium (ring-Te) using density
functional theory. Its stability is confirmed by phonon and ab-initio molecular
dynamics simulations. The ring-Te has an indirect band gap of 0.69 eV (1.16 eV)
at PBE (HSE06) level of theories and undergoes an indirect-direct band gap
transition under the tensile strain. The higher carrier mobility of holes
(~103cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$), good UV-visible light absorption ability and low
exciton binding (~0.35 eV) of ring-Te gives rise to its potential applications
in optoelectronic devices. Further, the electrical contact of ring-Te with
topological Dirac semimetal (sq-Te) under the influence of electric field shows
that the Schottky barriers and contact types can undergo transition from p-type
to n-type Schottky contact and then to ohmic contact at higher electric field.
Our study provides an insight into the physics of designing high-performance
electrical coupled devices composed of 2D semiconductors and topological
semimetals.

Highly efficient, environmental friendly and renewable sources of energy are
of great need today to combat with increasing energy demands and environmental
pollution. In this work, we have investigated the novel 2D allotropes i.e.,
$\beta$-Te$_2$X (X = S, Se) using first-principles calculations and study their
potential applications in light harvesting devices. Both the monolayers possess
to have the high stability and semiconducting nature with an indirect band gap.
The high carrier mobilities and excellent optical absorption of these
monolayers make them potential candidates for solar conversion applications. We
have proposed the type-II heterojunction solar cells and calculated their power
conversion efficiencies (PCEs). The small conduction band offset and
appropriate band gap of donor material in case of
$\beta$-Te$_2$S(S-Side)/$\alpha$-Te$_2$S(Te-Side) heterojunction results in the
PCE of ~ 21%. In addition to that, the band alignments of these monolayers
properly engulf the redox potentials of the water. The overpotentials required
to trigger the hydrogen reduction (HER) and water oxidation (OER) half
reactions reveal that HER and OER preferred the acidic and neutral mediums,
respectively. The calculated solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiencies of
$\beta$-Te$_2$S ($\beta$-Te$_2$Se) monolayers come out to be ~ 13 % (~12 %),
respectively, which implies their practical applications in water splitting.
Thus, our work provides strong evidence regarding the potential applications of
these materials in the field of light harvesting devices.

<h3>Structural Dynamics Descriptors for Metal Halide Perovskites</h3>

Metal halide perovskites have shown extraordinary performance in solar energy
conversion. They have been classified as "soft semiconductors" due to their
flexible corner-sharing octahedral networks and polymorphous nature.
Understanding the local and average structures continues to be challenging for
both modelling and experiments. Here, we report the quantitative analysis of
structural dynamics in time and space from molecular dynamics simulations of
perovskite crystals. The descriptors cover a wide variety of properties,
including octahedral tilting and distortion, local lattice parameters,
molecular orientations, as well as the spatial correlation of these properties.
To validate our methods, we have trained a machine learning force field (MLFF)
for methylammonium lead bromide (CH$_3$NH$_3$PbBr$_3$) using an on-the-fly
training approach with Gaussian process regression. The known stable phases are
reproduced and we find an additional symmetry-breaking effect in the cubic and
tetragonal phases close to the phase transition temperature. To test the
implementation for large trajectories, we also apply it to 69,120 atom
simulations for CsPbI$_3$ based on an MLFF developed using the atomic cluster
expansion formalism. The structural dynamics descriptors and Python toolkit are
general to perovskites and readily transferable to more complex compositions.

<h3>Josephson-type oscillations in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein  condensates with nonlinear optical lattices</h3>

<br>
We consider spin orbit coupled Bose Einstein Condensate in presence of linear
and nonlinear optical lattices within the framework of quasi-one-dimensional
Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Based on a variational approach, we find an
effective potential and show that the atomic population imbalance between these
states executes Josephson-type oscillation. We find that the oscillation
amplitude depends sensitively on center of mass motion of the coupled system.
Maximum value of the oscillation amplitude remains constant if the center of
mass is at rest. It oscillates if the center of mass moving in optical lattice.
We find that a nonlinear optical lattice induces an additional phase and thus
influences the JT oscillation.

We theoretically study the quantum transport in a three-dimensional spin-1
chiral fermion system in the presence of coulomb impurities based on the
self-consistent Born approximation. We find that the flat-band states
anomalously enhance the screening effect, and the electrical conductivity is
increased in the low-energy region. It is also found that reducing the
screening length leads to an increase in the forward scattering contribution
and, thus, an increase in the vertex correction in the high-energy region.

The search for high-temperature superconductors in hydrides under high
pressure has always been a research hotspot. Hydrogen-based superconductors
offer an avenue to achieve the long-sought goal of superconductivity at room
temperature. We systematically explore the high-pressure phase diagram,
electronic properties, lattice dynamics and superconductivity of the ternary
Ca-Al-H system using ab initio methods. We found two stable ternary hydrides at
50 GPa: Cmcm-CaAlH5 and Pnnm-CaAl2H8, which both are semiconductors. At 200
GPa, a new phase of P21/m-CaAlH5, P4/mmm-CaAlH7 and a metastable compound
Immm-Ca2AlH12 were found. Furthermore, P4/mmm-CaAlH7 has obvious phonon
softening of high frequency vibrations along the Z-A direction, point A and
point X, which improves the strength of electron-phonon coupling. Therefore, a
superconducting transition temperature Tc of 71 K is generated at 50 GPa. In
addition, the thermodynamic metastable Immm-Ca2AlH12 exhibits a superconducting
transition temperature of 118 K at 250 GPa. These results are very useful for
the experimental searching of new high-Tc superconductors in ternary hydrides.

<br>
<br>
We study the Raman response, for $B_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ light-polarization
symmetries, of the charge density wave phase appearing in the underdoped region
of cuprate superconductors. We show that the $B_{2g}$ response provides a
distinctive signature of the charge order, independently of the details of the
electronic structure and from the concomitant presence of a pseudogap, in sharp
contrast with the behavior of the $B_{1g}$ response. This well accounts for the
Raman experimental results. We then clearly identify a charge density wave
energy scale, and show that its doping dependence is eventually driven by the
monotonic behavior of the pesudogap. This has also been pointed out in Raman
experiments, and it is suggestive of a pseudogap ruling the multiple energy
scales of the exotic phases appearing in the cuprate phase diagram.

<br>
Low-temperature neutron diffraction experiments at P = 8 GPa have been
conducted to investigate the magnetic structures of metallic Holmium at high
pressures by employing a long d-spacing highflux diffractometer and a
Paris-Edinburgh press cell inside a cryostat. We find that at P = 8 GPa and T =
5 K, no nuclear symmetry change is observed, keeping therefore the hexagonal
closed packed (hcp) symmetry at high pressure. Our neutron diffraction data
confirm that the ferromagnetic state does not exist. The magnetic structure
corresponding to the helimagnetic order, which survives down to 5 K, is fully
described by the magnetic superspace group formalism. These results are
consistent with those previously published using magnetization experiments.

The topological singularity of the Bloch states close to the Fermi level
significantly enhances nonlinear electric responses in topological semimetals.
Here, we systematically characterize this enhancement for a large class of
topological nodal-point fermions, including those with linear,
linear-quadratic, and quadratic dispersions. Specifically, we determine the
leading power-law dependence of the nonlinear response functions on the
chemical potential $\mu$ defined relative to the nodal point. We identify two
characteristics that qualitatively improve nonlinear transports compared to
those of conventional Dirac and Weyl fermions. First, the type II (over-tilted)
spectrum leads to the $\log\mu$ enhancement of nonlinear response functions
having zero scaling dimension with respect to $\mu$, which is not seen in a
type-I (moderately or not tilted) spectrum. Second, the anisotropic
linear-quadratic dispersion increases the power of small-$\mu$ divergence for
the nonlinear response tensors along the linearly dispersing direction. Our
work reveals new experimental signatures of unconventional nodal points in
topological semimetals as well as provides a guiding principle for giant
nonlinear electric responses.

Strong light-matter interaction constitutes the bedrock of all photonic
applications, empowering material elements with the ability to create and
mediate interactions of light with light. Amidst the quest to identify new
agents facilitating such efficient light-matter interactions, a class of
promising materials have emerged featuring highly unusual properties deriving
from their dielectric constant {\epsilon} being equal, or at least very close,
to zero. Works so far have shown that the enhanced nonlinear optical effects
displayed in this 'epsilon-near-zero' (ENZ) regime makes it possible to create
ultrafast albeit transient optical switches. An outstanding question, however,
relates to whether one could use the amplification of light-matter interactions
at the ENZ conditions to achieve permanent switching. Here, we demonstrate that
an ultrafast excitation under ENZ conditions can induce permanent all-optical
reversal of ferroelectric polarization between different stable states. Our
reliance on ENZ conditions that naturally emerge from the solid's ionic
lattice, rather than specific material properties, suggests that the
demonstrated mechanism of reversal is truly universal, being capable of
permanently switching order parameters in a wide variety of systems.

<h3>On the validity of the bipolaron model for undoped and AlCl4- doped  PEDOT</h3>

<br>
<br>
The conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is one of the
most highly researched materials, yet electronic structure investigations of
conducting polymers are still uncommon. The bipolaron model has traditionally
been the dominant attempt to explain the electronic structure of PEDOT. Though
recent theoretical studies have begun to move away from this model, some
aspects remain commonplace, such as the concepts of bipolarons or polaron
pairs. In this work, we use density functional theory to investigate the
electronic structure of undoped and AlCl4- doped PEDOT oligomers. By
considering the influence of oligomer length, oxidation or doping level and
spin state, we find no evidence for self-localisation of positive charges in
PEDOT as predicted by the bipolaron model. Instead, we find that a single or
twin peak structural distortion can occur at any oxidation or doping level.
Rather than representing bipolarons or polaron pairs, these are electron
distributions driven by a range of factors, which also disproves the concept of
polaron pairs. Localisation of distortions does occur in the doped case,
although distortions can span an arbitrary number of nearby anions.
Furthermore, conductivity in conducting polymers has been experimentally
observed to reduce at very high doping levels. We show that at high anion
concentrations, the non-bonding orbitals of the anions cluster below the
HOMO-LUMO gap and begin to mix into the HOMO of the overall system. We propose
that this mixing of highly localised anionic orbitals into the HOMO reduces the
conductivity of the polymer and contributes to the reduced conductivity
previously observed.

Abundant chemical diversity and structural tunability make organic-inorganic
hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) a rich ore for ferroelectrics. However, compared
with their inorganic counterparts such as BaTiO$_3$, their ferroelectric key
properties, including large spontaneous polarization ($P_s$), low coercive
field ($E_c$), and strong second harmonic generation (SHG) response, have long
been great challenges, which hinder their commercial applications. Here, a
quasi-one-dimensional OIHP DMAGeI$_3$ (DMA=Dimethylamine) is reported, with
notable ferroelectric attributes at room temperature: a large $P_s$ of 24.14
$\mu$C/cm$^2$ (on a par with BaTiO$_3$), a low $E_c$ below 2.2 kV/cm, and the
strongest SHG intensity in OIHP family (about 12 times of KH$_2$PO$_4$ (KDP)).
Revealed by the first-principles calculations, its large $P_s$ originates from
the synergistic effects of the stereochemically active $4s^2$ lone pair of
Ge$^{2+}$ and the ordering of organic cations, and its low kinetic energy
barrier of small DMA cations results in a low $E_c$. Our work brings the
comprehensive ferroelectric performances of OIHPs to a comparable level with
commercial inorganic ferroelectric perovskites.

Knots are deeply entangled with every branch of science. For more than a
hundred years, the biggest open challenge in knot theory has been to formalise
a knot invariant that can unambiguously distinguish any two knotted curves. At
the same time, the intuitive hypothesis that the geometry of a curve may encode
information on the underlying curve topology remains an open conjecture. Here,
we propose a neural network (NN) approach that takes as input a geometric
representation of a knotted curve and can classify knots more accurately than
any existing knot polynomial. More specifically, we show that NNs trained using
a 'local writhe' representation can distinguish knots that share one or many
topological invariants and knot polynomials, such as knot mutants. We also show
that our approach can be scaled up to classify all knots up to 10-crossings
with 95 % accuracy. Our results not only pave the way to create artificial
intelligence tools that can unambiguously classify and eventually generate
curves with any knot topology but, perhaps more importantly, identifies local
3D writhe as a geometric signature of knot topology potentially leading to new
topological invariants.

Thermoelectric devices can directly convert waste heat into electricity,
which makes them an important clean energy technology. The underlying materials
performance can be evaluated by the dimensionless figure of merit ZT. Metal
halides are attractive candidates due to their chemical flexibility and ease of
processing; however, the maximum ZT realized (ZT = 0.15) falls far below the
level needed for commercialization (ZT > 1). Using a first-principles procedure
we assess the thermoelectric potential of copper halide CsCu2I3, which features
1D Cu-I connectivity. The n-type crystal is predicted to exhibit a maximum ZT
of 2.2 at 600 K along the b-axis. The strong phonon anharmonicity of this
system is shown by locally stable non-centrosymmetric Amm2 structures that are
averaged to form the observed centrosymmetric Cmcm space group. Our work
provides insights into the structure-property relations in metal halide
thermoelectrics and suggests a path forward to engineer higher-performance
heat-to-electricity conversion.

topological edge magnons, orders ferromagnetically (FM) (T$_C=61$ K) in the
bulk, but antiferromagnetic (AFM) order has been observed in nanometer thick
flakes, attributed to monoclinic (M) type stacking. We report neutron
scattering measurements on a powder sample where the usual transition to the
rhombohedral (R) phase was inhibited for a majority of the structure. Elastic
measurements (and the opening of a hysteresis in magnetization data on a
pressed pellet) showed that an AFM transition is clearly present below $\sim$50
K, coexisting with the R-type FM order. Inelastic measurements showed a
decrease in magnon energy compared to the R phase, consistent with a smaller
interlayer magnetic coupling in M-type stacking. A gap remains at the Dirac
point, suggesting that the same nontrivial magnon topology reported for the R
phase may be present in the M phase as well.

In this work we propose a new scheme to engineer subharmonic responses via
scar states in a generalized PXP model. We first show that the generalized PXP
model also possesses a band of scar states like the pristine PXP model does. In
addition, we reveal that a generalized forward scattering approximation (FSA)
still works for these scar states. We further argue that the FSA subspace
exhibits an $SO(3)$ symmetry, which enables an $SO(3)$-FSA approach for the
scar states. When such a model is placed under periodic driving, nontrivial
Floquet scar states emerge in the quasienergy spectrum. One appealing feature
of such Floquet scar states is that they can support subharmonic responses akin
to the discrete time crystalline phase. In particular, such subharmonic
responses can exist beyond the conventional prethermalization regime, where
either large frequencies or large driving amplitudes are required.

$ $Dual-phase $\gamma$-TiAl and $\alpha_2$-Ti$_{3}$Al alloys exhibit high
strength and creep resistance at high temperatures. However, they suffer from
low tensile ductility and fracture toughness at room temperature. Experimental
studies show unusual plastic behaviour associated with ordinary and
superdislocations, making it necessary to gain a detailed understanding on
their core properties in individual phases and at the two-phase interfaces.
Unfortunately, extended superdislocation cores are widely dissociated beyond
the length scales practical for routine first-principles density-functional
theory (DFT) calculations, while extant interatomic potentials are not
quantitatively accurate to reveal mechanistic origins of the unusual
core-related behaviour in either phases. Here, we develop a highly-accurate
moment tensor potential (MTP) for the binary Ti-Al alloy system using a DFT
dataset covering a broad range of intermetallic and solid solution structures.
The optimized MTP is rigorously benchmarked against both previous and new DFT
calculations, and unlike existing potentials, is shown to possess outstanding
accuracy in nearly all tested mechanical properties, including lattice
parameters, elastic constants, surface energies, and generalized stacking fault
energies (GSFE) in both phases. The utility of the MTP is further demonstrated
by producing dislocation core structures largely consistent with expectations
from DFT-GSFE and experimental observations. The new MTP opens the path to
realistic modelling and simulations of bulk lattice and defect properties
relevant to the plastic deformation and fracture processes in $\gamma$-TiAl and
$\alpha_2$-Ti$_{3}$Al dual-phase alloys.

The Joint Automated Repository for Various Integrated Simulations (JARVIS)
infrastructure at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is
a large-scale collection of curated datasets and tools with more than 80000
materials and millions of properties. JARVIS uses a combination of electronic
structure, artificial intelligence (AI), advanced computation and experimental
methods to accelerate materials design. Here we report some of the new features
that were recently included in the infrastructure such as: 1) doubling the
number of materials in the database since its first release, 2) including more
accurate electronic structure methods such as Quantum Monte Carlo, 3) including
graph neural network-based materials design, 4) development of unified
force-field, 5) development of a universal tight-binding model, 6) addition of
computer-vision tools for advanced microscopy applications, 7) development of a
natural language processing tool for text-generation and analysis, 8) debuting
a large-scale benchmarking endeavor, 9) including quantum computing algorithms
for solids, 10) integrating several experimental datasets and 11) staging
several community engagement and outreach events. New classes of materials,
properties, and workflows added to the database include superconductors,
two-dimensional (2D) magnets, magnetic topological materials, metal-organic
frameworks, defects, and interface systems. The rich and reliable datasets,
tools, documentation, and tutorials make JARVIS a unique platform for modern
materials design. JARVIS ensures openness of data and tools to enhance
reproducibility and transparency and to promote a healthy and collaborative
scientific environment.
