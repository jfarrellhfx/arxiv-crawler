<h3>The functional generalization of the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation and its  Gauge-like symmetry</h3>

We argue that one can model deviations from the ensemble average in
non-equilibrium statistical mechanics by promoting the Boltzmann equation to an
equation in terms of {\em functionals} , representing possible candidates for
phase space distributions inferred from a finite observed number of degrees of
freedom.
We find that, provided the collision term and the Vlasov drift term are both
included, a gauge-like redundancy arises which does not go away even if the
functional is narrow.
We argue that this effect is linked to the gauge-like symmetry found in
relativistic hydrodynamics \cite{bdnk} and that it could be part of the
explanation for the apparent fluid-like behavior in small systems in hadronic
collisions and other strongly-coupled small systems\cite{zajc}.
When causality is omitted this problem can be look at via random matrix
theory show, and we show that in such a case thermalization happens much more
quickly than the Boltzmann equation would infer. We also sketch an algorithm to
study this problem numerically

<h3>Superfolded configuration induced low thermal conductivity in  two-dimensional carbon allotropes revealed via machine learning force  constant potential</h3>

Understanding the fundamental link between structure and functionalization is
crucial for the design and optimization of functional materials, since
different structural configurations could trigger materials to demonstrate
diverse physical, chemical, and electronic properties. However, the correlation
between crystal structure and thermal conductivity (\k{appa}) remains
enigmatic. In this study, taking two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotropes as
study cases, we utilize phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) along with
machine learning force constant potential to thoroughly explore the complex
folding structure of pure sp2 hybridized carbon materials from the perspective
of crystal structure, mode-level phonon resolved thermal transport, and atomic
interactions, with the goal of identifying the underlying relationship between
2D geometry and \k{appa}. We propose two potential structure evolution
mechanisms for targeted thermal transport properties: in-plane and out-of-plane
folding evolutions, which are generally applicable to 2D carbon allotropes. It
is revealed that the folded structure produces strong symmetry breaking, and
simultaneously produces exceptionally strongly suppressed phonon group
velocities, strong phonon-phonon scattering, and weak phonon hydrodynamics,
which ultimately lead to low \k{appa}. The insight into the folded effect of
atomic structures on thermal transport deepens our understanding of the
relationship between structure and functionalization, which offers
straightforward guidance for designing novel nanomaterials with targeted
\k{appa}, as well as propel developments in materials science and engineering.

<h3>Anomalous Hall effect in ultraclean electronic channels</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05401" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05401</a>
<br>
<i>K.K. Grigoryan, D.S. Zohrabyan, M.M. Glazov</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a theory of anomalous Hall effect in ultraclean channels with
two-dimensional electron gas. In ultraclean systems, the electron mean free
path due to static disorder and phonons is considered to be much larger
compared to the channel width. The electron momentum relaxation and
conductivity are mainly determined by the diffusive scattering at the channel
edges and electron-electron collisions making electron magnetotransport highly
nontrivial. The anomalous Hall electric field and Hall voltage are generated
owing to the skew scattering of electrons, side-jump, and anomalous velocity
effects that appear as a result of the spin-orbit coupling. We study both
ballistic and hydrodynamic transport regimes which are realized depending on
the relation between the electron-electron mean free path and the channel
width. Compact analytical expressions for the anomalous Hall field and voltage
are derived. We demonstrate that both in the ballistic and hydrodynamic regime
the electron momentum relaxation in the bulk of the channel due to impurities
or phonons is required for the anomalous Hall effect in contrast to the normal
Hall effect and conductivity that can appear due to the electron-electron
collisions combined with momentum relaxation at the channels edge scattering.

<h3>Weakly supervised learning for pattern classification in serial  femtosecond crystallography</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04474" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04474</a>

Serial femtosecond crystallography at X-ray free electron laser facilities
opens a new era for the determination of crystal structure. However, the data
processing of those experiments is facing unprecedented challenge, because the
total number of diffraction patterns needed to determinate a high-resolution
structure is huge. Machine learning methods are very likely to play important
roles in dealing with such a large volume of data. Convolutional neural
networks have made a great success in the field of pattern classification,
however, training of the networks need very large datasets with labels. Th is
heavy dependence on labeled datasets will seriously restrict the application of
networks, because it is very costly to annotate a large number of diffraction
patterns. In this article we present our job on the classification of
diffraction pattern by weakly supervised algorithms, with the aim of reducing
as much as possible the size of the labeled dataset required for training. Our
result shows that weakly supervised methods can significantly reduce the need
for the number of labeled patterns while achieving comparable accuracy to fully
supervised methods.

<h3>Crystal Structure Prediction by Joint Equivariant Diffusion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04475" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04475</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) is crucial in various scientific
disciplines. While CSP can be addressed by employing currently-prevailing
generative models (e.g. diffusion models), this task encounters unique
challenges owing to the symmetric geometry of crystal structures -- the
invariance of translation, rotation, and periodicity. To incorporate the above
symmetries, this paper proposes DiffCSP, a novel diffusion model to learn the
structure distribution from stable crystals. To be specific, DiffCSP jointly
generates the lattice and atom coordinates for each crystal by employing a
periodic-E(3)-equivariant denoising model, to better model the crystal
geometry. Notably, different from related equivariant generative approaches,
DiffCSP leverages fractional coordinates other than Cartesian coordinates to
represent crystals, remarkably promoting the diffusion and the generation
process of atom positions. Extensive experiments verify that our DiffCSP
significantly outperforms existing CSP methods, with a much lower computation
cost in contrast to DFT-based methods. Moreover, the superiority of DiffCSP is
also observed when it is extended for ab initio crystal generation.

Two-dimensional materials offer a unique range of magnetic, electronic and
mechanical properties which can be controlled by external stimuli. Pressure is
a particularly important stimulus, as it can be achieved readily and can
produce large responses, especially in low-dimensional materials. In this paper
we explore the pressure-dependence of the structural and magnetic properties of
a two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) molecular framework antiferromagnet with
ferromagnetic layers, Ni(NCS)$_2$, up to 8.4 kbar. Through a combination of
X-ray and neutron diffraction analysis, we find that Ni(NCS)$_2$ is
significantly more compressible than comparable vdW metal halides, and its
response is anisotropic not only out of the plane, but also within the layers.
Using bulk magnetisation and neutron diffraction data, we show that the ambient
layered antiferromagnetic phase is maintained up to the largest investigated
pressure, but with an enhanced N\'eel temperature, $T_\mathrm{N}$, ($\Delta
T_\mathrm{N} / T_\mathrm{N} = +19$ %) and a large pressure sensitivity ($Q =
\frac{1}{T_\mathrm{N}} \frac{\mathrm{d}T_\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{d}P} = +2.3$ %
kbar$^{-1}$), one of the larger values of magnetic pressure responsiveness for
a vdW material. Density functional theory calculations suggest that this is due
to increasing three-dimensionality. These results provide some of the first
insights into the pressure response of molecular framework vdW magnets and
suggest investigation of other molecular framework vdW magnets might uncover
contenders for future pressure-switchable devices.

<h3>Multimodal machine learning for materials science: composition-structure  bimodal learning for experimentally measured properties</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04478" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04478</a>

The widespread application of multimodal machine learning models like GPT-4
has revolutionized various research fields including computer vision and
natural language processing. However, its implementation in materials
informatics remains underexplored, despite the presence of materials data
across diverse modalities, such as composition and structure. The effectiveness
of machine learning models trained on large calculated datasets depends on the
accuracy of calculations, while experimental datasets often have limited data
availability and incomplete information. This paper introduces a novel approach
to multimodal machine learning in materials science via composition-structure
bimodal learning. The proposed COmposition-Structure Bimodal Network (COSNet)
is designed to enhance learning and predictions of experimentally measured
materials properties that have incomplete structure information. Bimodal
learning significantly reduces prediction errors across distinct materials
properties including Li conductivity in solid electrolyte, band gap, refractive
index, dielectric constant, energy, and magnetic moment, surpassing
composition-only learning methods. Furthermore, we identified that data
augmentation based on modal availability plays a pivotal role in the success of
bimodal learning.

<h3>Inner product regularized multi-energy X-ray tomography for material  decomposition</h3>

<br>
<br>
Multi-energy X-ray tomography is studied for decomposing three materials
using three X-ray energies and a classical energy-integrating detector. A novel
regularization term comprises inner products between the material distribution
functions, penalizing any overlap of different materials. The method is tested
on real data measured of a phantom embedded with Na$_2$SeO$_3$, Na$_2$SeO$_4$,
and elemental selenium. It is found that the two-dimensional distributions of
selenium in different oxidation states can be mapped and distinguished from
each other with the new algorithm. The results have applications in material
science, chemistry, biology and medicine.

<h3>Modeling of electrochemical oxide film growth -- a PDM refinement</h3>

The Point Defect Model (PDM) is known for over 40 years and has brought
deeper insight to the understanding of passivity. During the last decades it
has seen several changes and refinements, and it has been widely used to
analyze growth kinetics of different alloys. Nevertheless, the model has been
based on still unconfirmed assumptions, as constant and potential independent
electric field strength. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Refined
PDM (R-PDM) in which we replace those assumptions by using additional equations
for charge distribution including new physically valid boundary conditions
based on considering finite dimensions for the defects by introduction of two
defect layer at the film boundaries and by calculating the potential drop at
the surface of the film towards the solution over the compact double layer. The
calculations by the R-PDM show that the original PDM assumptions are only valid
for very specific parameter combinations of oxide film growth and vacancies
transport and cannot generally be taken for granted. We believe our findings of
electric field and potential drop dependency on the external potential to pave
the way for a more realistic description of passive layer formation.

<h3>Addressing the Accuracy-Cost Tradeoff in Material Property Prediction: A  Teacher-Student Strategy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04482" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04482</a>
<br>
<i>Dong Zhu, Zhikuang xin, Siming Zheng, Yangang Wang, Xiaoyu Yang</i>
<br>
<br>
Deep learning has revolutionized the process of new material discovery, with
state-of-the-art models now able to predict material properties based solely on
chemical compositions, thus eliminating the necessity for material structures.
However, this cost-effective method has led to a trade-off in model accuracy.
Specifically, the accuracy of Chemical Composition-based Property Prediction
Models (CPMs) significantly lags behind that of Structure-based Property
Prediction Models (SPMs). To tackle this challenge, we propose an innovative
Teacher-Student (T-S) strategy, where a pre-trained SPM serves as the 'teacher'
to enhance the accuracy of the CPM. Leveraging the T-S strategy, T-S CrabNet
has risen to become the most accurate model among current CPMs. Initially, we
demonstrated the universality of this strategy. On the Materials Project (MP)
and Jarvis datasets, we validated the effectiveness of the T-S strategy in
boosting the accuracy of CPMs with two distinct network structures, namely
CrabNet and Roost. This led to CrabNet, under the guidance of the T-S strategy,
emerging as the most accurate model among the current CPMs. Moreover, this
strategy shows remarkable efficacy in small datasets. When predicting the
formation energy on a small MP dataset comprising merely 5% of the samples, the
T-S strategy boosted CrabNet's accuracy by 37.1%, exceeding the enhancement
effect of the T-S strategy on the whole dataset.

<h3>Separate measurement- and feedback-driven entanglement transitions in  the stochastic control of chaos</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study measurement-induced entanglement and control phase transitions in a
quantum analog of the Bernoulli map subjected to a classically-inspired control
protocol. When entangling gates are restricted to the Clifford group, separate
entanglement ($p_\mathrm{ent}$) and control ($p_\mathrm{ctrl}$) transitions
emerge, revealing two distinct universality classes. The control transition has
critical exponents $\nu$ and $z$ consistent with the classical map (a random
walk) while the entanglement transition is revealed to have similar exponents
as the measurement-induced phase transition in Clifford hybrid dynamics. This
is distinct from the case of generic entangling gates in the same model, where
$p_\mathrm{ent} = p_\mathrm{ctrl}$ and universality is controlled by the random
walk.

<br>
<br>
We present the development of a versatile apparatus for a 6.2 eV laser-based
time and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with micrometer spatial
resolution (time-resolved $\mu$-ARPES). With a combination of tunable spatial
resolution down to $\sim$11 $\mu$m, high energy resolution ($\sim$11 meV),
near-transform-limited temporal resolution ($\sim$280 fs), and tunable 1.55 eV
pump fluence up to $\sim$3 mJ/cm$^2$, this time-resolved $\mu$-ARPES system
enables the measurement of ultrafast electron dynamics in exfoliated and
inhomogeneous materials. We demonstrate the performance of our system by
correlating the spectral broadening of the topological surface state of
Bi$_2$Se$_3$ with the spatial dimension of the probe pulse, as well as
resolving the spatial inhomogeneity contribution to the observed spectral
broadening. Finally, after in-situ exfoliation, we performed time-resolved
$\mu$-ARPES on a $\sim$30 $\mu$m few-layer-thick flake of transition metal
dichalcogenide WTe$_2$, thus demonstrating the ability to access ultrafast
electron dynamics with momentum resolution on micro-exfoliated and twisted
materials.

<h3>Deformed Fredkin model for the $ν{=}5/2$ Moore-Read state on thin  cylinders</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04527" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04527</a>
<br>
<i>Cristian Voinea, Songyang Pu, Ammar Kirmani, Pouyan Ghaemi, Armin Rahmani, Zlatko Papić</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a frustration-free model for the Moore-Read quantum Hall state on
sufficiently thin cylinders with circumferences $\lesssim 7$ magnetic lengths.
While the Moore-Read Hamiltonian involves complicated long-range interactions
between triplets of electrons in a Landau level, our effective model is a
simpler one-dimensional chain of qubits with deformed Fredkin gates. We show
that the ground state of the Fredkin model has high overlap with the Moore-Read
wave function and accurately reproduces the latter's entanglement properties.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the model captures the dynamical response of the
Moore-Read state to a geometric quench, induced by suddenly changing the
anisotropy of the system. We elucidate the underlying mechanism of the quench
dynamics and show that it coincides with the linearized bimetric field theory.
The minimal model introduced here can be directly implemented as a first step
towards quantum simulation of the Moore-Read state, as we demonstrate by
deriving an efficient circuit approximation to the ground state and
implementing it on IBM quantum processor.

<h3>Dissipationless counterflow currents above T_c in bilayer  superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04531" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04531</a>
<br>
<i>Guido Homann, Marios H. Michael, Jayson G. Cosme, Ludwig Mathey</i>
<br>
<br>
We report the existence of dissipationless currents in bilayer
superconductors above the critical temperature $T_c$, assuming that the
superconducting phase transition is dominated by phase fluctuations. Using a
semiclassical $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory, we show that thermal fluctuations
cause a transition from the superconducting state at low temperature to a
resistive state above $T_c$, accompanied by the proliferation of unbound
vortices. Remarkably, while the proliferation of vortex excitations causes
dissipation of homogeneous in-plane currents, we find that counterflow
currents, flowing in opposite direction within a bilayer, remain
dissipationless. The presence of a dissipationless current channel above $T_c$
is attributed to the inhibition of vortex motion by local superconducting
coherence within a single bilayer, in the presence of counterflow currents. Our
theory presents a possible scenario for the pseudogap phase in bilayer
cuprates.

<h3>Quantum Quenches of Conformal Field Theory with Open Boundary</h3>

<br>
<i>Xinyu Liu, Alexander McDonald, Tokiro Numasawa, Biao Lian, Shinsei Ryu</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a method to derive the exact formula of entanglement entropy for
generic inhomogeneous conformal field theory (CFT) quantum quenches with open
boundary condition (OBC), which characterizes the generic boundary effect
unresolved by analytical methods in the past. We identify the generic OBC
quenches with Euclidean path integrals in complicated spacetime geometries, and
we show that a special class of OBC quenches, including the M\"obius and
sine-square-deformation quenches, have simple boundary effects calculable from
Euclidean path integrals in a simple strip spacetime geometry. We verify that
our generic CFT formula matches well with free fermion tight-binding model
numerical calculations for various quench problems with OBC. Our method can be
easily generalized to calculate any local quantities expressible as one-point
functions in such quantum quench problems.

<h3>Flatband slows down polariton dynamics in strongly coupled cavities</h3>

<br>
<br>
Flatbands in condensed-matter, atomic physics, and quantum optics stand as
the basis for several strongly correlated quantum many-body phenomena such as
Wigner crystallization, the fractional quantum Hall effect and Moir\'e-related
physics. Besides inspiring analogies among diverse physical fields, flatbands
are highly sought-after in photonics because they allow unconventional light
flows such as slow-light. Here, we realize room-temperature slow-light with
Frenkel polaritons excited across two strongly coupled cavities. We demonstrate
the formation of a tuneable flatband appearing in absence of a periodic
in-plane potential. Our simple photonic architecture enables the unique spatial
segregation of photons and excitons in different cavities and maintains a
balanced degree of mixing between them. This unveils a dynamical competition
between many-body scattering processes and the underlying polariton nature
which leads to an increased fluorescence lifetime. The polariton features are
further revealed under appropriate resonant pumping, where we observe
suppression of the flatband polariton fluorescence intensity.

<h3>Fluid-driven slow slip and earthquake nucleation on a slip-weakening  circular fault</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04567" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04567</a>
<br>
<i>Alexis Sáez, Brice Lecampion</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the propagation of fluid-driven fault slip on a slip-weakening
frictional interface separating two identical half-spaces of a
three-dimensional elastic solid. Our focus is on axisymmetric circular shear
ruptures as they capture the most essential aspects of the dynamics of
unbounded ruptures in three dimensions. In our model, fluid-driven aseismic
slip occurs in two modes: as an interfacial rupture that is unconditionally
stable, or as the quasi-static nucleation phase of an otherwise dynamic
rupture. Unconditionally stable ruptures progress through four stages.
Initially, ruptures are diffusively self-similar and the interface behaves as
if it were governed by a constant friction coefficient equal to the static
friction value. Slip then accelerates due to frictional weakening while the
cohesive zone develops. Once the latter gets properly localized, a finite
amount of fracture energy emerges along the interface and the rupture dynamics
is governed by an energy balance of the Griffith's type. In this stage, fault
slip transition from a large-toughness to a small-toughness regime. Ultimately,
self-similarity is recovered and the fault behaves again as having a constant
friction coefficient, but this time equal to the dynamic friction value. When
slow slip is the result of a frustrated dynamic instability, slip also
initiates self-similarly at a constant peak friction coefficient. The maximum
aseismic rupture size varies from a critical nucleation radius (shear modulus
divided by slip-weakening rate) to infinity near the limit that separates the
two modes of aseismic sliding. We provide analytical and numerical solutions
for the problem solved over its full dimensionless parameter space. Due to its
three-dimensional nature, the model enables quantitative comparisons with field
observations as well as preliminary engineering design of hydraulic stimulation
operations.

<h3>New type of Bernstein modes in two-dimensional electron liquid</h3>

<br>
<br>
Bernstein modes are formed as a result of non-local coupling of collective
excitations and cyclotron harmonics in magnetized plasma. In degenerate solid
state plasma they are typically associated with magnetoplasmons. A new type of
Bernstein modes arises in two-dimensional electron liquid at sufficiently
strong quasiparticle interaction. We consider Bernstein modes originating from
coupling between quasiparticle cyclotron harmonics and shear magnetosound
waves. The latter may be responsible for the giant peak in radio-frequency
photoresistance observed in high-quality GaAs quantum wells. Using Landau-Silin
kinetic equation with an arbitrary strength of the interparticle Landau
interaction, we trace the reconstruction of Bernstein mode spectrum in
high-quality 2D electron systems across the crossover between weakly
interacting degenerate electron gas and the correlated electron liquid.
Sensitivity of Bernstein modes to the strength of quasiparticle interaction
allows one to use them for spectroscopy of Landau interaction function in the
electron Fermi liquids.

<br>
<br>
The quenched unitary Bose gas is a paradigmatic example of a strongly
interacting out-of-equilibrium quantum system, whose dynamics become difficult
to describe theoretically due to the growth of non-Gaussian quantum
correlations. We develop a conserving many-body theory capable of capturing
these effects, allowing us to model the post-quench dynamics in previously
inaccessible time regimes. By comparing our results directly to experiment, we
answer long-standing fundamental questions regarding the heating and population
dynamics in the gas, specifically highlighting the dominance of strong lossless
correlations rather than incoherent atomic losses. Our general framework, which
reframes the dynamics of unitary quantum systems in terms of explicit
connections to microscopic physics, can be broadly applied to any quantum
system containing strong few-body correlations.

We study the influence of quantizing perpendicular magnetic fields on the
ground state of a bilayer with electron and hole fluids separated by an opaque
tunnel barrier. In the absence of a field, the ground state at low carrier
densities is a condensate of s-wave excitons that has spontaneous interlayer
phase coherence. We find that a series of phase transitions emerge at strong
perpendicular fields between condensed states and incompressible incoherent
states with full electron and hole Landau levels. When the electron and hole
densities are unequal, condensation can occur in higher angular momentum
electron-hole pair states and, at weak fields, break rotational symmetry. We
explain how this physics is expressed in dual-gate phase diagrams, and predict
transport and capacitively-probed thermodynamic signatures that distinguish
different states.

<h3>High-entropy effect at rare-earth site in DyNi</h3>

We report the structural and magnetic properties of RNi (R=Dy,
Tb$_{1/3}$Dy$_{1/3}$Ho$_{1/3}$, and
Gd$_{1/5}$Tb$_{1/5}$Dy$_{1/5}$Ho$_{1/5}$Er$_{1/5}$) to investigate the
high-entropy effect at the rare-earth site. The lattice parameters are almost
unchanged by the increase of configurational entropy, which is due to the
successive partial substitution of Dy by pair of rare earth elements located on
both sides of Dy in the periodic table. All compounds exhibit ferromagnetic
ground states. The replacement of Dy with Tb+Ho, which does not have magnetic
interactions in competition with Dy, does not affect the magnetic ordering
temperature. Although (Gd$_{1/5}$Tb$_{1/5}$Dy$_{1/5}$Ho$_{1/5}$Er$_{1/5}$)Ni
shows the Curie temperature close to that of DyNi, an additional magnetic
anomaly, which would be a spin reorientation, is observed probably due to the
introduction of competing magnetic interactions between R=Gd and Er compounds
and R=Tb, Dy, and Ho ones. We have also assessed the magnetocaloric effect, and
the configurational entropy dependence of the magnetic entropy change reflects
that of the temperature derivative of the magnetic susceptibility. Our analysis
suggests the possibility of enhancing magnetocaloric properties by designing
the anisotropy of rare-earth magnetic moments in the high-entropy state.

We propose and investigate an extension of the Caspar-Klug symmetry
principles for viral capsid assembly to the programmable assembly of
size-controlled triply-periodic polyhedra, discrete variants of the Primitive,
Diamond, and Gyroid cubic minimal surfaces. Inspired by a recent class of
programmable DNA origami colloids, we demonstrate that the economy of design in
these crystalline assemblies -- in terms of the growth of the number of
distinct particle species required with the increased size-scale (e.g.
periodicity) -- is comparable to viral shells. We further test the role of
geometric specificity in these assemblies via dynamical assembly simulations,
which show that conditions for simultaneously efficient and high-fidelity
assembly require an intermediate degree of flexibility of local angles and
lengths in programmed assembly. Off-target misassembly occurs via incorporation
of a variant of disclination defects, generalized to the case of hyperbolic
crystals. The possibility of these topological defects is a direct consequence
of the very same symmetry principles that underlie the economical design,
exposing a basic tradeoff between design economy and fidelity of programmable,
size controlled assembly.

<br>
<br>
In the electromagnetic multipole expansion, magnetic octupoles are the
subsequent order of magnetic multipoles allowed in centrosymmetric systems,
following the more commonly observed magnetic dipoles. As order parameters in
condensed matter systems, magnetic octupoles have been experimentally elusive.
In particular, the lack of simple external fields that directly couple to them
makes their experimental detection challenging. Here, we demonstrate a
methodology for probing the magnetic octupole susceptibility using a product of
magnetic field $H_i$ and shear strain $\epsilon_{jk}$ to couple to the
octupolar fluctuations, while using an adiabatic elastocaloric effect to probe
the response to this composite effective field. We observe a Curie-Weiss
behavior in the obtained octupolar susceptibility of \ce{PrV2Al20} up to
temperatures approximately forty times the putative octupole ordering
temperature. Our results demonstrate the presence of magnetic octupole
fluctuations in the particular material system, and more broadly highlight how
anisotropic strain can be combined with magnetic fields to formulate a
versatile probe to observe otherwise elusive emergent `hidden' electronic
orders.

<br>
<br>
The Fe intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD), Fe$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$,
exhibits remarkable resistance switching properties and highly tunable spin
ordering phases due to magnetic defects. We conduct synchrotron X-ray
scattering measurements on both under-intercalated ($x$ = 0.32) and
over-intercalated ($x$ = 0.35) samples. We discover a new charge order phase in
the over-intercalated sample, where the excess Fe atoms lead to a zigzag
antiferromagnetic order. The agreement between the charge and magnetic ordering
temperatures, as well as their intensity relationship, suggests a strong
magnetoelastic coupling as the mechanism for the charge ordering. Our results
reveal the first example of a charge order phase among the intercalated TMD
family and demonstrate the ability to stabilize charge modulation by
introducing electronic correlations, where the charge order is absent in bulk
2H-NbS$_2$ compared to other pristine TMDs.

<br>
<br>
In this study, we attempted to model vacancy ordered half Heusler compounds
with 18 valence electron count (VHH) derived from 19 VEC compounds such as
TiNiSb such that the compositions will be Ti0.75NiSb, Zr0.75NiSb and Hf0.75NiSb
with semiconducting behavior. The main motivation is that such a
vacancy-ordered phase not only introduces semi conductivity but also it
disrupts the phonon conducting path in HH alloys and thus reduces the thermal
conductivity and as a consequence enhances the thermoelectric figure of merit.
In order to predict the formation energy ({\Delta}Hf) from composition and
crystal structure we have used 4684 compounds for their {\Delta}Hf values are
available in the material project database and trained a machine learning model
with R2 value of 0.943. Using this trained model, we have predicted the
{\Delta}Hf of a list of VHH. From the predicted database of VHH we have
selected Zr0.75NiSb and Hf0.75NiSb to validate the machine learning prediction
using accurate DFT calculation. The calculated {\Delta}Hf for these two
compounds from DFT calculation are found to be comparable with our ML
prediction. The calculated electronic and lattice dynamics properties show that
these materials are narrow band gap semiconductors and are dynamically stable
as their all-phonon dispersion curves are having positive frequencies. The
calculated Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity as well as thermal
conductivity, power factor and thermoelectric figure of merit are analyzed.

<br>
<br>
Many-body interactions play a crucial role in quantum topological systems,
being able to impact or alter the topological classifications of
non-interacting fermion systems. In open quantum systems, where interactions
with the environment cause dissipation and decoherence of the fermionic
dynamics, the absence of hermiticity in the subsystem Hamiltonian drastically
reduces the stability of the topological phases of the corresponding closed
systems. Here we investigate the non-perturbative effects induced by the
environment on the prototype Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain coupled to local
harmonic oscillator baths through either intra-cell or inter-cell transfer
integrals. Despite the common view, this type of coupling, if suitably
engineered, can even induce a transition to topological phases. By using a
world-line Quantum Monte Carlo technique we determine the phase diagram of the
model proving that the bimodality of the probability distribution of the
polarization signals the emergence of the topological phase. We show that a
qualitative description can be obtained in terms of an approach based on the
Cluster Perturbation Theory providing, in particular, a non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian for the fermionic subsystem and insights on the dissipative
dynamics.

<h3>Generic Mott-Hubbard phase diagram for extended Hubbard models without  Umklapp scattering</h3>

<br>
<br>
We determine the ground-state phase diagram for the 1/r-Hubbard model with
repulsive nearest-neighbor interaction at half band-filling using the
density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. Due to the absence of
Umklapp cattering, the phase diagram displays finite regions for the three
generic phases, namely, a Luttinger liquid metal for weak interactions, a
Mott-Hubbard insulator for dominant Hubbard interactions, and a
charge-density-wave insulator for dominant nearest-neighbor interactions. Up to
moderate interactions strengths, the quantum phase transitions between the
metallic and insulating phases are continuous, i.e., the gap opens continuously
as a function of the interaction strength. We conclude that generic short-range
interactions do not change the nature of the Mott transition qualitatively.

<h3>Room-temperature strong coupling of hexane-dispersed colloidal CdSe  nanoplatelets in a microcavity composed of two Bragg reflectors</h3>

<i>Masaru Oda, Kazuaki Yamato, Jyunya Egashira, Hisao Kondo</i>
<br>
<br>
CdSe nanoplatelets (NPLs) are suitable for exploring strong light-matter
coupling in semiconductor nanocrystal systems due to their giant oscillator
strength and large exciton binding energy. Herein, we report on the facile
fabrication and optical characterization of a half-wavelength planar
microcavity, which consists of two distributed Bragg reflectors with a hexane
layer containing concentrated colloidal CdSe NPLs. Using a hexane solution
layer instead of the typically used dried active layers makes the layer thin
and flat, even under dense NPL conditions, without stressing or charging of the
NPLs' surfaces. Reflectance spectra showed that strong light-matter coupling
can be realized at room temperature and that the vacuum Rabi splitting energy
is 53.5 meV. Intense photoluminescence (PL) emerges at the lower polariton
branch where 25.1 meV (longitudinal optical (LO)-phonon energy) below the
energy of the polariton dark states, indicating that the relaxation from the
dark states occurs efficiently in this microcavity owing to LO-phonon-assisted
relaxation. We describe the reflectance and PL properties using the model that
a cavity photon couples to a one-exciton state delocalized over nonuniformly
orientated NPLs. This model contributes to an intuitive and quantitative
understanding of the microcavity containing colloidal NPLs.

<h3>High pressure-temperature proton migration in P-3 brucite [Mg(OH)2]:  Implication for electrical conductivity in deep mantle</h3>

Hydrous minerals contribute largely to the transport and distribution of
water into the mantle of earth to regulate the process of deep-water cycle.
Brucite is one of the simplest layered dense hydrous mineral belonging to
MgO-SiO2-H2O ternary system, which contains significant amount of water in the
form of OH- groups, spanning a wide range of pressure stability.
Simultaneously, the pressure (p) and temperature (T) induced mobility of
protons within the layered structure of brucite is crucial for consequences on
electrical conductivity of the mantle. Using ab initio molecular dynamics
(AIMD) simulations, we investigate the diffusion of H in high-pressure trigonal
P-3 polymorph of brucite in a combined p-T range of 10-85 GPa and 1250-2000K,
relevant to the mantle of earth. The AIMD simulations reveal an unusual
pressure-dependence of the proton migration in brucite characterized by maximum
H-diffusion in the pressure range of 72-76 GPa along different isotherms. We
predict that in the P-3 brucite the H mobility is onset only when a critical
hydrostatic pressure is attained. The onset pressure is observed to drop with
increasing temperature. The H-diffusion in brucite phase at elevated p-T takes
place in such a manner that the process results in the amorphization of the
H-sublattice, without disturbing the Mg- and O-sublattices. This selective
amorphization yields a pool of highly mobile protons causing a subsequent
increment in the electrical conductivity in P-3 brucite. Our calculated values
of conductivity are compared with ex-situ geophysical magnetic satellite data
indicating that brucite can be present in larger quantities in the lower mantle
than previously observed. This hydroxide phase can occur as segregated patches
between the dominant constituents e.g., silicates and oxides of the lower
mantle and thus can explain the origin of high electrical conductivity therein.

Simulation of the intermediate levels of disorder found in multi-component

Van der Waals magnetic materials are an ideal platform to study
low-dimensional magnetism. Opposed to other members of this family, the
magnetic semiconductor CrSBr is highly resistant to degradation in air, which,
besides its exceptional optical, electronic, and magnetic properties, is the
reason the compound is receiving considerable attention at the moment. For many
years, its magnetic phase diagram seemed to be well-understood. Recently,
however, several groups observed a magnetic transition in magnetometry
measurements at temperatures of around 40 K that is not expected from
theoretical considerations, causing a debate about the intrinsic magnetic
properties of the material. In this letter, we report the absence of this
particular transition in magnetization measurements conducted on high-quality
CrSBr crystals, attesting to the extrinsic nature of the low-temperature
magnetic phase observed in other works. Our magnetometry results obtained from
large bulk crystals are in very good agreement with the magnetic phase diagram
of CrSBr previously predicted by the mean-field theory; A-type
antiferromagnetic order is the only phase observed below the N\'eel temperature
at TN = 131 K. Moreover, numerical fits based on the Curie-Weiss law confirm
that strong ferromagnetic correlations are present within individual layers
even at temperatures much larger than TN.

Band gap is known as an effective parameter for tuning the Lande $g$-factor
in semiconductors and can be manipulated in a wide range through the bowing
effect in ternary alloys. In this work, using the recently developed virtual
substrate technique, high-quality InAsSb alloys throughout the whole Sb
composition range are fabricated and a large $g$-factor of $g\approx -90$ at
the minimum band gap of $\sim 0.1$ eV, which is almost twice that in bulk InSb
is found. Further analysis to the zero gap limit reveals a possible gigantic
$g$-factor of $g\approx -200$ with a peculiar relativistic Zeeman effect that
disperses as the square root of magnetic field. Such a $g$-factor enhancement
toward the narrow gap limit cannot be quantitatively described by the
conventional Roth formula, as the orbital interaction effect between the nearly
triply degenerated bands becomes the dominant source for the Zeeman splitting.
These results may provide new insights into realizing large $g$-factors and
spin polarized states in semiconductors and topological materials.

According to density functional theory, any chemical property can be inferred
from the electron density, making it the most informative attribute of an
atomic structure. In this work, we demonstrate the use of established physical
methods to obtain important chemical properties from model-predicted electron
densities. We introduce graph neural network architectural choices that provide
physically relevant and useful electron density predictions. Despite not
training to predict atomic charges, the model is able to predict atomic charges
with an order of magnitude lower error than a sum of atomic charge densities.
Similarly, the model predicts dipole moments with half the error of the sum of
atomic charge densities method. We demonstrate that larger data sets lead to
more useful predictions in these tasks. These results pave the way for an
alternative path in atomistic machine learning, where data-driven approaches
and existing physical methods are used in tandem to obtain a variety of
chemical properties in an explainable and self-consistent manner.

Cell rearrangements are fundamental mechanisms driving large-scale
deformations of living tissues. In three-dimensional (3D) space-filling cell
aggregates, cells rearrange through local topological transitions of the
network of cell-cell interfaces, which is most conveniently described by the
vertex model. Surprisingly, these transitions are not yet mathematically
properly formulated due to a rather convoluted architecture of the conventional
vertex model. As a result, the vertex model is generally difficult to
implement, especially in its full 3D representation. Indeed, the few existing
implementations of the full 3D vertex model rely on highly customized and
complex software-engineering solutions, which cannot be transparently
delineated and are thus mostly non-reproducible. We propose a solution to this
outstanding problem by introducing a new formulation of the vertex model,
called Graph Vertex Model~(GVM). GVM is based on storing the topology of the
cell network into a knowledge graph. Its data structure, uniquely defined by a
metagraph, allows performing cell rearrangement events by simple graph
transformations, which are themselves represented by graphs. These graph
transformations are mathematically well formulated and consist of elementary
operations, such as deletions and creations of links between nodes of the
knowledge graph, which are straight-forward to implement. Significantly, in the
GVM's data representation, complex topological changes in 3D space-filling
polyhedral packings can be broken down into a composition of more fundamental
T1 transitions. Remarkably, when applied to a 2D system, these transformations
reduce to a single T1 transition. This finding unifies topological transitions
in 2D and 3D space-filling packings and suggests that the GVM's graph data
structure may be the most natural representation of these systems.

Coherent topologically close-packed (TCP) precipitate plates in magnesium
alloys are found beneficial to the strength and creep resistance of alloys. To
comprehensively screen these TCP plates in the three most common hcp alloys,
magnesium (Mg), titanium (Ti), and zirconium (Zr) alloys, we performed
high-throughput first-principles calculations under a three-step screening
strategy. Our results indicate that the hcp-to-TCP structural transformations
(that is, the formation of coherent TCP plates) are prone to occur in Mg
alloys, while hcp-Ti and Zr alloys tend to favor hcp-to-bcc structural
transformations rather than the formation of TCP plates. Furthermore, these
screened results are basically consistent with experimental observations,
supporting the reliability of these results. The insights gained contribute to
a deeper understanding of precipitation behavior in various hcp-based alloys at
the atomic level and serve as a basis for screening coherent precipitates of
technological importance in other metallic systems.

<br>
<br>
In this paper the fundamental parameters of high-$T_c$ superconductivity are
shown to be connected to the statistics of pairons (hole pairs in their
antiferromagnetic environment) on a square lattice. In particular, we study the
density fluctuations and the distribution of the area surrounding each pairon
on the scale of the antiferromagnetic correlation length $\xi_{AF}$, for the
complete range of hole concentration. We show that the key parameters of the
phase diagram, the $T_c$ dome, and the pseudogap temperature $T^*$, emerge from
the statistical properties of the pairon disordered state. In this approach,
the superconducting and the pseudogap states appear as inseparable phenomena.
The condensation energy, which fixes the critical temperature, is directly
proportional to the {\it correlation energy} between pairons and {\it not} to
the energy gap, contrary to conventional superconductors.
When the correlation energy between pairons is suppressed by fluctuations,
either thermally, by disorder, or in the vortex core, the pseudogap state of
disordered pairons is obtained. We attribute the unique features of cuprate
superconductivity to this order-disorder transition in real space, which
clearly differs from the BCS mechanism. Our predictions are in quantitative
agreement with low-temperature tunneling and photoemission spectroscopy
experiments.

Niobium halides, Nb3X8 (X = Cl,Br,I), which are predicted two-dimensional
magnets, have recently gotten attention due to their breathing kagome geometry.
Here, we have studied the electronic structure of Nb3Br8 by using
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and first-principles
calculations. ARPES results depict the presence of multiple flat and weakly
dispersing bands. These bands are well explained by the theoretical
calculations, which show they have Nb d character indicating their origination
from the Nb atoms forming the breathing kagome plane. This van der Waals
material can be easily thinned down via mechanical exfoliation to the ultrathin
limit and such ultrathin samples are stable as depicted from the time-dependent
Raman spectroscopy measurements at room temperature. These results demonstrate
that Nb3Br8 is an excellent material not only for studying breathing kagome
induced flat band physics and its connection with magnetism, but also for
heterostructure fabrication for application purposes.

<br>
<br>
We characterize formation of vacancies at a surface slab model and contrasted
the results to bulk of lead-halide perovskites using cubic CsPbI$_3$ as a
representative structure. The defect-free CsI-terminated (100) surface does not
trap charge carriers. In the presence of defects (vacancies), the surface is
anticipated to behave as $p$-type. The formation energy of cesium vacancies
$V_\text{Cs}^{-}$ is lower at the surface than in bulk with iodine vacancies
$V_\text{I}^{+}$ having a similar energy (near 0.25-0.4 eV) in the range of
chemical potentials compatible with solution processing synthesis conditions.
Major surface vacancies produce shallow host-like energy states with a small
Franck-Condon shift, which renders them electronically harmless (same as in
bulk). The spin-orbit coupling contributes to the defect tolerance of
lead-halide perovskite surfaces by causing delocalization of electronic states
associated with $n$-type defects and retraction of lowest unoccupied states
from the surface due to a mixing of Pb-$p_{x,y,z}$ orbitals. The results
explain a high optoelectronic performance of two-dimensional structures,
nanoparticles, and polycrystalline thin films of lead-halide perovskites in
spite of abundance of interfaces in these materials.

The key obstacle to the realization of a scalable quantum computer is
overcoming environmental and control errors. Topological quantum computation
has attracted great attention because it has emerged as one of the most
promising approaches to solving these problems. Various theoretical schemes for
building topological quantum computation have been proposed. However,
experimental implementation has always been a great challenge because it has
proved to be extremely difficult to create and manipulate topological qubits in
real systems. Therefore, topological quantum computation has not been realized
in experiments yet. Here, we report the first experimental realization of
topological quantum computation with electric circuits. Based on our proposed
new scheme with circuits, Majorana-like edge states are not only observed
experimentally, but also T junctions are constructed for the braiding process.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of topological quantum computing
through a set of one- and two-qubit unitary operations. Finally, our
implementation of Grover's search algorithm demonstrates that topological
quantum computation is ideally suited for such tasks.

One-dimensional graphene superlattice subjected to strong Kronig-Penney (KP)
potential is promising for achieving electron lensing effect, while previous
studies utilizing the modulated dielectric gates can only yield a moderate,
spatially dispersed potential profile. Here, we realize high KP potential
modulation of graphene via nanoscale ferroelectric domain gating. Graphene
transistors are fabricated on PbZr$_{0.2}$Ti$_{0.8}$O$_{3}$ back-gates
patterned with periodic, 100-200 nm wide stripe domains. Due to band
reconstruction, the h-BN top-gating induces satellite Dirac points in samples
with current along the superlattice vector $\hat{s}$, a feature absent in
samples with current perpendicular to $\hat{s}$. The satellite Dirac point
position scales with the superlattice period ($L$) as $\propto L^{\beta}$, with
$\beta = -1.18 \pm 0.06$. These results can be well explained by the high KP
potential scenario, with the Fermi velocity perpendicular to $\hat{s}$ quenched
to about 1% of that for pristine graphene. Our study presents a promising
material platform for realizing electron supercollimation and investigating
flat band phenomena.

We propose a simple theoretical model referred to as the {\it two-band model}
to realize both a large Seebeck coefficient and high electrical conductivity,
resulting in a high thermoelectric (TE) power factor ($PF$). Using the
Kubo--Luttinger linear response theory, we apply this model to the TE response
of an FeSe thin film reported by Shimizu {\it et al.} to show a high $PF$ with
strong temperature dependence. The effects of superconducting fluctuations and
excitonic correlations are found to not be critical.

<br>
<br>
We report a transition from the ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal ($N_F$)
phase to a lower-temperature, antiferroelectric fluid phase having reentrant
isotropic symmetry ($I_A$), in the liquid crystal compound RM734 doped with
small concentrations of the ionic liquids BMIM or EMIM. Even a trace amount of
ionic liquid dopant facilitates the kinetic pathway for the transition from the
$N_F$ to the $I_A$, enabling simple cooling to produce this isotropic fluid
phase rather than resulting in crystallization. The $I_A$ was also obtained in
the absence of specific ionic liquid doping by appropriate temperature cycling
in three distinct, as-synthesized-and-purified batches of RM734, two commercial
and one from our laboratory. An additional birefringent, lamellar-modulated,
antiferroelectric phase with the director parallel to the layers, resembling
the smectic $Z_A$, is found between the paraelectric and ferroelectric nematic
phases in RM734/BMIM mixtures.

Self-propelled particles in anisotropic environments can exhibit a motility
that depends on their orientation. This dependence is relevant for a plethora
of living organisms but difficult to study in controlled environments. Here, we
present a macroscopic system of self-propelled vibrated granular particles on a
striated substrate that displays orientation-dependent motility. An extension
of the active Brownian motion model involving orientation-dependent motility
and inertial effects reproduces and explains our experimental observations. The
model can be applied to general $n$-fold symmetric anisotropy and can be
helpful for predictive optimization of the dynamics of active matter in complex
environments.

<h3>Extracting the number of type-B Goldstone modes and the dynamical  critical exponent for a type of scale-invariant states</h3>

<br>
<i>Huan-Qiang Zhou, Yan-Wei Dai, Qian-Qian Shi, Ian P. McCulloch, Murray T. Batchelor</i>
<br>
<br>
A generic scheme is proposed to perform a finite-entanglement scaling
analysis for scale-invariant states, which appear to be highly degenerate
ground states arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking with type-B Goldstone
modes. This allows us to extract the number of type-B Goldstone modes and the
dynamical critical exponent, in combination with a finite block-size scaling
analysis, from numerical simulations of quantum many-body systems in the
context of tensor network representations. The number of type-B Goldstone modes
is identical to the fractal dimension, thus reflecting an abstract fractal
underlying the ground state subspace. As illustrative examples, we investigate
the spin-$s$ Heisenberg ferromagnetic model, the $\rm{SU}(3)$ ferromagnetic
model and the $\rm{SO}(4)$ spin-orbital model.

<h3>Type-B Goldstone modes and a logarithmic spiral in the staggered $\rm  SU(4)$ ferromagnetic spin-orbital model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04973" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04973</a>
<br>
<i>Qian-Qian Shi, Huan-Qiang Zhou, Ian P. McCulloch, Murray T. Batchelor</i>
<br>
<br>
It is found that the staggered $\rm SU(4)$ ferromagnetic spin-orbital model
accommodates highly degenerate ground states arising from spontaneous symmetry
breaking with type-B Goldstone modes. The spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern
is ${\rm SU(4)} \rightarrow {\rm U(1)} \times {\rm U(1)} \times {\rm U(1)}$,
with three type-B Goldstone modes. An abstract fractal underlies the ground
state subspace with the fractal dimension identified with the number of type-B
Goldstone modes. This connection is established by evaluating the entanglement
entropy, which exhibits a universal finite system-size scaling behaviour. The
latter in turn implies that the entanglement entropy scales logarithmically
with the block size in the thermodynamic limit. In addition, the ground state
degeneracies, depending on the boundary conditions adopted, constitute the two
Fibonacci-Lucas sequences. In the limit of large system size their asymptotic
forms become a self-similar logarithmic spiral. As a result, the model has a
non-zero residual entropy $S_{\!r} = -2 \ln R $, where $R=(\!
\sqrt{6}-\!\sqrt{2})/2$.

<h3>Giant nonreciprocity of current-voltage characteristics of  noncentrosymmetric supercondctor-normal metal-superconductor junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05034" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05034</a>
<br>
<i>T. Liu, M. Smith, A. V. Andreev, B. Z. Spivak</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a theory of nonreciprocal current-voltage (I-U) characteristics in
noncentrosymmetric superconductor-normal metal-superconductor junctions. We
show that at small voltages the nonreciprocal features of the I-U
characteristics can be expressed entirely in terms of the dependence of the
nonreciprocal part of the quasiparticle density of states in the normal metal
part of the junction on the order parameter phase difference $\chi$ across the
junction. The amplitude of the nonreciprocity in this regime is proportional to
the inelastic quasiparticle relaxation time $\tau_{in}$, and can be much larger
than that in normal materials, where it is proportional to the elastic
relaxation time $\tau_{el}$. At low bias the I-U characteristics possess
additional symmetry, not present in normal conductors; they remain invariant
under simultaneous reversal of current, voltage and the magnetic field.

<h3>Cavity-Magnon-Polariton spectroscopy of strongly hybridized  electro-nuclear spin excitations in LiHoF4</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05051" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05051</a>
<br>
<i>Yikai Yang, Peter Babkevich, Richard Gaal, Ivica Zivkovic, Henrik M. Ronnow</i>
<br>
<br>
We first present a formalism that incorporates the input-output formalism and
the linear response theory to employ cavity-magnon-polariton coupling as a
spectroscopic tool for investigating strongly hybridized electro-nuclear spin
excitations. A microscopic relation between the generalized susceptibility and
the scattering parameter |S11| in strongly hybridized cavity-magnon-polariton
systems has been derived without resorting to semi-classical approximations.
The formalism is then applied to both analyze and simulate a specific systems
comprising a model quantum Ising magnet (LiHoF4) and a high-finesse 3D
re-entrant cavity resonator. Quantitative information on the electro-nuclear
spin states in LiHoF4 is extracted, and the experimental observations across a
broad parameter range were numerically reproduced, including an external
magnetic field titraversing a quantum critical point. The method potentially
opens a new avenue not only for further studies on the quantum phase transition
in LiHoF4 but also for a wide range of complex magnetic systems.

<h3>Power laws of natural swarms are fingerprints of an extended critical  region</h3>

<br>
<i>R. González-Albaladejo, L. L. Bonilla</i>
<br>
<br>
Collective biological systems display power laws for macroscopic quantities
and are fertile probing grounds for statistical physics. Besides power laws,
natural insect swarms present strong scale-free correlations, suggesting
closeness to phase transitions. Swarms exhibit $imperfect$ dynamic scaling:
their dynamical correlation functions collapse into single curves when written
as functions of the scaled time $t\xi^{-z}$ ($\xi$: correlation length, $z$:
dynamic exponent), but only for short times. Triggered by markers, natural
swarms are not invariant under space translations. Measured static and dynamic
critical exponents differ from those of equilibrium and many nonequilibrium
phase transitions. Here, we show that the recently discovered scale-free-chaos
phase transition of the harmonically confined Vicsek model has a novel extended
critical region for finitely many insects. Unlike results of other theoretical
approaches, our numerical simulations of the critical region reproduce the
previously described features of natural swarms and yield static and dynamic
critical exponents that agree with observations.

<h3>Critical-like gelation dynamics in cellulose nanocrystal suspensions</h3>

<br>
<i>Lise Morlet-Decarnin, Thibaut Divoux, Sebastien Manneville</i>
<br>
<br>
We use time-resolved mechanical spectroscopy to offer a detailed picture of
the gelation dynamics of cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) suspensions following
shear cessation in the presence of salt. CNCs are charged, rodlike colloids
that self-assemble into various phases, including physical gels serving as soft
precursors for biosourced composites. Here, series of linear viscoelastic
spectra acquired across the sol-gel transition of CNC suspensions are rescaled
onto two master curves, that correspond to a viscoelastic liquid state prior to
gelation and to a soft solid state after gelation. These two states are
separated by a critical gel point, where all rescaling parameters diverge in an
asymmetric fashion, yet with exponents that obey hyperscaling relations
consistent with previous works on isotropic colloids and polymer gels. Upon
varying the salt content, we further show that these critical-like dynamics
result in both time-connectivity and time-concentration superposition
principles.

<br>
<br>
The low-dimensional ferroelectrics, ferrielectrics and antiferroelectrics are
of urgent scientific interest due to their unusual polar, piezoelectric,
electrocaloric and pyroelectric properties. The strain engineering and strain
control of the ferroelectric properties of layered 2D Van der Waals materials,
such as CuInP$_2$(S,Se)$_6$ monolayers, thin films and nanoflakes, are of
fundamental interest and especially promising for their advanced applications
in nanoscale nonvolatile memories, energy conversion and storage, nano-coolers
and sensors. Here, we study the polar, piezoelectric, electrocaloric and
pyroelectric properties of thin strained films of a ferrielectric
CuInP$_2$S$_6$ covered by semiconducting electrodes and reveal an unusually
strong effect of a mismatch strain on these properties. In particular, the sign
of the mismatch strain and its magnitude determine the complicated behavior of
piezoelectric, electrocaloric and pyroelectric responses. The strain effect on
these properties is opposite, i.e., "anomalous", in comparison with many other
ferroelectric films, for which the out-of-plane remanent polarization,
piezoelectric, electrocaloric and pyroelectric responses increase strongly for
tensile strains and decrease or vanish for compressive strains.

<h3>Pattern formation of phase-separated lipid domains in bilayer membranes</h3>

<br>
<i>Qiwei Yu, Andrej Košmrlj</i>
<br>
<br>
Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) composed of as few as three lipid species
can phase separate into small-scale lipid domains with stripes and dots
patterns. These patterns have been experimentally characterized in terms of how
their size and morphology depend on temperature, membrane composition, and
surface tension, which revealed inconsistencies with existing theoretical
models. Here, we demonstrate that the experiments can be explained with a
theory that considers both the elastic deformation of the membrane and the
phase separation of lipids, which are coupled by a preferred bilayer curvature.
We combine analytical and numerical approaches to elucidate how characteristic
pattern size and morphology emerge from these interactions. The results agree
with existing experiments and offer testable predictions such as non-monotonic
dependence of the domain size on osmotic pressure and pattern hysteresis upon
cycling external stimuli. These predictions motivate new directions for
understanding the spatial patterning and organization mechanisms of biological
membranes.

<i>Chinmay Katke, Peter A. Korevaar, C. Nadir Kaplan</i>
<br>
<br>
Acid-induced release of stored ions from polyacrylic acid hydrogels (with a
free surface fully permeable to the ion and acid flux) was observed to increase
the gel osmotic pressure that leads to rapid, temporary swelling faster than
the characteristic solvent absorption rate of the gel. Here we develop a
continuum poroelastic theory that quantitatively explains the experiments by
introducing a "gel diffusio-phoresis" mechanism: Steric repulsion between the
gel polymers and released ions can induce a diffusio-osmotic solvent intake
counteracted by the diffusio-phoretic expansion of the gel network. For
applications ranging from drug delivery to soft robotics, engineering the gel
diffusio-phoresis may enable stimuli-responsive hydrogels with amplified strain
rates and power output.

We propose a quantum Monte Carlo algorithm capable of simulating the
Bose-Hubbard model on arbitrary graphs, obviating the need for devising
lattice-specific updates for different input graphs. We show that with our
method, which is based on the recently introduced Permutation Matrix
Representation Quantum Monte Carlo [Gupta, Albash and Hen, J. Stat. Mech.
(2020) 073105], the problem of adapting the simulation to a given geometry
amounts to generating a cycle basis for the graph on which the model is
defined, a procedure that can be carried out efficiently and and in an
automated manner. To showcase the versatility of our approach, we provide
simulation results for Bose-Hubbard models defined on two-dimensional lattices
as well as on a number of random graphs.

Silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs)
fabricated on a SIMOX (001) substrate, which is a kind of silicon on insulator
(SOI) substrate, that is annealed at high temperature for a long time are known
to exhibit large valley splitting, but the origin of this splitting has long
been unknown. Extended zone effective-mass approximation (EMA) predicts that
strain significantly affects valley splitting. In this study, we analyzed
valley splitting based on this theory and found that the shear strain along
<110> of approximately 5% near the buried oxide (BOX) interface is a promising
source for large valley splitting.

<br>
The origin of magnetic anisotropy in magnetic compounds is a longstanding
issue in solid state physics and nonmagnetic ligand ions are considered to
contribute little to magnetic anisotropy. Here, we introduce the concept of
ligand driven magnetic anisotropy in a complex transition-metal oxide. We
conducted X ray absorption and X ray magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopies
at the Ru and O edges in the 4d ferromagnetic metal SrRuO3. Systematic
variation of the sample thickness in the range below 10 nm allowed us to
control the localization of Ru 4d t2g states, which affects the magnetic
coupling between the Ru and O ions. We found that the orbital magnetization of
the ligand induced via hybridization with the Ru 4d orbital determines the
magnetic anisotropy in SrRuO3.

<h3>Coupled-cluster theory for trapped bosonic mixtures</h3>

We develop a coupled-cluster theory for bosonic mixtures of binary species in
external traps, providing a promising theoretical approach to demonstrate
highly accurately the many-body physics of mixtures of Bose-Einstein
condensates. The coupled-cluster wavefunction for the binary species is
obtained when an exponential cluster operator $e^T$, where
$T=T^{(1)}+T^{(2)}+T^{(12)}$ and $T^{(1)}$ accounts for excitations in
species-1, $T^{(2)}$ for excitations in species-2, and $T^{(12)}$ for combined
excitations in both species, acts on the ground state configuration prepared by
accumulating all bosons in a single orbital for each species. We have
explicitly derived the working equations for the bosonic mixtures by truncating
the cluster operator upto the single and double excitations and using an
arbitrary sets of orthonormal orbitals for each of the species. Further, the
comparatively simplified version of the working equations are formulated using
the Fock-like operators. Finally, using an exactly solvable many-body model for
bosonic mixtures that exists in the literature allows us to implement and test
the performance and accuracy of the coupled-cluster theory for situations with
balanced as well as imbalanced boson numbers and for weak to moderately strong
intra- and inter-species interaction strengths. The comparison between our
computed results using coupled-cluster theory with the respective analytical
exact results displays remarkable agreement exhibiting excellent success of the
coupled-cluster theory for bosonic mixtures. All in all, the correlation
exhaustive coupled-cluster theory shows encouraging results and it could be a
promising approach in paving the way for high-accuracy modelling of various
bosonic mixture systems.

<h3>Interplay of disorder and interaction in the bilayer band-insulator : A  Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo study</h3>

<br>
<br>
Earlier work [arXiv:1206.2407,arXiv:2206.06085] have shown the band insulator
(BI) to superfluid (SF) phase transition in the half-filled bilayer attractive
Hubbard model. In this paper we append the effects of random on-site disorder
on the single particle properties and two particle pair-pair correlations in
that model. Using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulation we observe
that the on-site random disorder plays a significant role in the localization
of on-site pairs, hence in the reduction of the effective hopping. This results
in an increase of the double occupancy, which is an effect similiar to the
attractive interaction. We find no change in the critical value of the
interaction at which the model undergoes from BI to SF regime even though the
pair-pair correlations get suppressed for finite on-site disorder strengths
V_d/t=0.1-0.8. We also confirm that the weak disorder suppresses the SF phase
largely in the strong-coupling limit. Hence the region of the SF phase reduces
in the presence of random on-site disorder. Finally, through finite-size
scaling we have estimated the critical disorder strength V_d^c/t~1.44 at
|U|/t=5.

We study the stationary and excitation properties of a one-dimensional
quantum droplet in the two-component Bose mixture trapped in a harmonic
potential. By constructing the energy functional for the inhomogeneous mixture,
we elaborate the extended the Gross-Pitaevskii equation applicable to both
symmetric and asymmetric mixtures into a universal form, and the equations in
two different dimensionless schemes are in a duality relation, i.e. the unique
parameters left are inverse of each other. The Bogoliubov equations for the
trapped droplet are obtained by linearizing the small density fluctuation
around the ground state and the low-lying excitation modes are calculated
numerically.It is found that the confinement trap changes easily the flat-top
structure for large droplets and alters the mean square radius and the chemical
potential intensively. The breathing mode of the confined droplet connects the
self-bound and ideal gas limits, with the excitation in the weakly interacting
Bose condensate for large particle numbers lying in between. We explicitly show
how the continuum spectrum of the excitation is split into discrete modes, and
finally taken over by the harmonic trap. Two critical particle numbers are
identified by the minimum size of the trapped droplet and the maximum breathing
mode energy, both of which are found to decrease exponentially with the
trapping parameter.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has been extensively used
for imaging complex materials down to atomic resolution. The most commonly
employed STEM imaging modality of annular dark field produces
easily-interpretable contrast, but is dose-inefficient and produces little to
no contrast for light elements and weakly-scattering samples. An alternative is
to use phase contrast STEM imaging, enabled by high speed detectors able to
record full images of a diffracted STEM probe over a grid of scan positions.
Phase contrast imaging in STEM is highly dose-efficient, able to measure the
structure of beam-sensitive materials and even biological samples. Here, we
comprehensively describe the theoretical background, algorithmic implementation
details, and perform both simulated and experimental tests for three iterative
phase retrieval STEM methods: focused-probe differential phase contrast,
defocused-probe parallax imaging, and a generalized ptychographic gradient
descent method implemented in two and three dimensions. We discuss the
strengths and weaknesses of each of these approaches using a consistent
framework to allow for easier comparison. This presentation of STEM phase
retrieval methods will make these methods more approachable, reproducible and
more readily adoptable for many classes of samples.

The manipulation of the valley degree of freedom can boost the technological
development of novel functional devices based on valleytronics. Here, we
demonstrate the valley-dependent charge transport controlled by the external
strain for bismuth with three equivalent electron valleys. The strain response
of resistance, namely elastoresistance, exhibits the evolutions in both
antisymmetric and symmetric channels with decreasing temperature. Our developed
semiclassical transport model that captures the essence of elastoresistance
behaviors pinpoints the primary role of changes in valley density depending on
the symmetry of the induced strain, which is consistent with the results of
strain-dependent quantum oscillation measurements. These facts suggest the
successful tune and evaluation of the valley populations through
strain-dependent charge valley transport.

<br>
<br>
In this study, the optical response to a terahertz pulse was investigated in
the transition metal chalcogenide Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, a candidate excitonic
insulator. First, by irradiating a terahertz pulse with a relatively weak
electric field (0.3 MV/cm), the spectral changes in reflectivity near the
absorption edge due to third-order optical nonlinearity were measured and the
absorption peak characteristic of the excitonic phase just below the interband
transition was identified. Next, by irradiating a strong terahertz pulse with a
strong electric field of 1.65 MV/cm, the absorption of the excitonic phase was
found to be reduced, and a Drude-like response appeared in the mid-infrared
region. These responses can be interpreted as carrier generation by exciton
dissociation induced by the electric field, resulting in the partial melting of
the excitonic phase and metallization. The presence of a distinct threshold
electric field for carrier generation indicates exciton dissociation via
quantum-tunnelling processes. The spectral change due to metallization by the
electric field is significantly different from that due to the strong optical
excitation across the gap, which can be explained by the different melting
mechanisms of the excitonic phase in the two types of excitations.

<br>
Charged carriers in solids diffuse from hot to cold sides under temperature
gradient to induce the thermoelectric voltage. Carrier filtering effect, which
only passes either electrons or holes for the conduction process, is an
efficient method to enhance such voltage, although it is challenging to
experimentally realize it especially in conventional metals with weak energy
dependence of the density of states near the Fermi level. Here we measure the
in-plane and out-of-plane thermopower of the layered perovskite Sr$_2$RuO$_4$
single crystals above room temperature, and find that the out-of-plane
thermopower is largely enhanced with increasing temperature, while the in-plane
one seems to remain a temperature-independent constant value which is expected
from the Heikes formula. The observed large out-of-plane thermopower may
originate from the recently proposed intriguing hole filtering effect in the
body-centered tetragonal system, in which the carrier hopping through the
centered atom is essential. Thus, the present carrier filtering effect may be a
universal property to be applicable in various materials belonging to such
crystal system.

The asymmetric properties of Janus two-dimensional materials commonly depend
on chemical effects, such as different atoms, elements, material types, etc.
Herein, based on carbon gene recombination strategy, we identify an intrinsic
non-chemical Janus configuration in a novel purely sp$^2$ hybridized carbon
monolayer, named as Janus-graphene. With the carbon gene of tetragonal,
hexagonal, and octagonal rings, the spontaneous unilateral growth of carbon
atoms drives the non-chemical Janus configuration in Janus-graphene, which is
totally different from the chemical effect in common Janus materials such as
MoSSe. A structure-independent half-auxetic behavior is mapped in
Janus-graphene that the structure maintains expansion whether stretched or
compressed, which lies in the key role of $p_z$ orbital. The unprecedented
half-auxeticity in Janus-graphene extends intrinsic auxeticity into pure sp$^2$
hybrid carbon configurations. With the unique half-auxeticity emerged in the
non-chemical Janus configuration, Janus-graphene enriches the functional carbon
family as a promising candidate for micro/nanoelectronic device applications.

Frustration is a ubiquitous phenomenon in many-body physics that influences
the nature of the system in a profound way with exotic emergent behavior.
Despite its long research history, the analytical or numerical investigations
on frustrated spin models remain a formidable challenge due to their extensive
ground state degeneracy. In this work, we propose a unified tensor network
theory to numerically solve the frustrated classical spin models on various
two-dimensional (2D) lattice geometry with high efficiency. We show that the
appropriate encoding of emergent degrees of freedom in each local tensor is of
crucial importance in the construction of the infinite tensor network
representation of the partition function. The frustrations are thus relieved
through the effective interactions between emergent local degrees of freedom.
Then the partition function is written as a product of a one-dimensional (1D)
transfer operator, whose eigen-equation can be solved by the standard algorithm
of matrix product states rigorously, and various phase transitions can be
accurately determined from the singularities of the entanglement entropy of the
1D quantum correspondence. We demonstrated the power of our unified theory by
numerically solving 2D fully frustrated XY spin models on the kagome, square
and triangular lattices, giving rise to a variety of thermal phase transitions
from infinite-order Brezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions, second-order
transitions, to first-order phase transitions. Our approach holds the potential
application to other types of frustrated classical systems like Heisenberg spin
antiferromagnets.

Solution self-assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers (BCs) is typically
performed by a solvent-to-water exchange. However, BC assemblies are often
trapped in metastable states depending on the mixing conditions such as the
magnitude and rate of water addition. BC self-assembly can be performed under
near thermodynamic control by dialysis, which accounts for a slow and gradual
water addition. In this Letter we report the use of a specifically designed
dialysis cell to continuously monitor by dynamic light scattering and
small-angle neutron scattering the morphological changes of PDMS-b-PEG BCs
self-assemblies during THF-to-water exchange. The complete phase diagrams of
near-equilibrium structures can then be established. Spherical micelles first
form before evolving to rod-like micelles and vesicles, decreasing the total
developed interfacial area of self-assembled structures in response to
increasing interfacial energy as the water content increases. The dialysis
kinetics can be tailored to the time scale of BC self-assembly by modifying the
membrane pore size, which is of interest to study the interplay between
thermodynamics and kinetics in self-assembly pathways.

<br>
Is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) substantially different from Glauber
dynamics? This is a fundamental question at the time of understanding the most
used training algorithm in the field of Machine Learning, but it received no
answer until now. Here we show that in discrete optimization and inference
problems, the dynamics of an SGD-like algorithm resemble very closely that of
Metropolis Monte Carlo with a properly chosen temperature, which depends on the
mini-batch size. This quantitative matching holds both at equilibrium and in
the out-of-equilibrium regime, despite the two algorithms having fundamental
differences (e.g.\ SGD does not satisfy detailed balance). Such equivalence
allows us to use results about performances and limits of Monte Carlo
algorithms to optimize the mini-batch size in the SGD-like algorithm and make
it efficient at recovering the signal in hard inference problems.

<br>
<br>
We report an example that demonstrates the clear interdependence between
surface-supported reactions and molecular adsorption configurations. Two
biphenyl-based molecules with two and four bromine substituents, i.e.
2,2-dibromo-biphenyl (DBBP) and 2,2,6,6-tetrabromo-1,1-biphenyl (TBBP), show
completely different reaction pathways on a Ag(111) surface, leading to the
selective formation of dibenzo[e,l]pyrene and biphenylene dimer, respectively.
By combining low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, synchrotron
radiation photoemission spectroscopy, and density functional theory
calculations, we unravel the underlying reaction mechanism. After
debromination, a bi-radical biphenyl can be stabilized by surface Ag adatoms,
while a four-radical biphenyl undergoes spontaneous intramolecular annulation
due to its extreme instability on Ag(111). Such different chemisorption-induced
precursor states between DBBP and TBBP consequently lead to different reaction
pathways after further annealing. In addition, using bond-resolving scanning
tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we determine the bond
length alternation of biphenylene dimer product with atomic precision, which
contains four-, six-, and eight-membered rings. The four-membered ring units
turn out to be radialene structures.

<h3>Electronic heat tunneling between two metals beyond the WKB  approximation</h3>

Two metals at different temperatures separated by large gaps exchange heat
under the form of electromagnetic radiation. When the separation distance is
reduced and they approach contact (nanometer and sub-nanometer gaps), electrons
and phonons can tunnel between the bodies, competing and eventually going
beyond the flux mediated by thermal photons. In this transition regime the
accurate modeling of electronic current and heat flux is of major importance.
Here we show that, in order to quantitatively model this transfer, a careful
description of the tunneling barrier between two metals is needed and going
beyond the traditional WKB approximation is also essential. We employ
analytical and numerical approaches to model the electronic potential between
two semi-infinite jellium planar substrates separated by a vacuum gap in order
to calculate the electronic heat flow and compare it with its radiative
counterpart described by near-field radiative heat transfer. We demonstrate
that the results for heat flux and electronic current density are extremely
sensitive to both the shape and height of the barrier, as well as the
calculation scheme for the tunneling probability, with variations up to several
orders of magnitude. Using the proximity force approximation, we also provide
estimates for tip-plane geometries. The present work provides realistic models
to describe the electronic heat flux, in the scanning-thermal-microscopy
experiments.

Lithium battery industry is booming, and this fast growth should be supported
by developing industry friendly tools to control the quality of positive and
negative electrode materials. Raman spectroscopy was shown to be a cost
effective and sensitive instrument to study defects and heterogeneities in
lithium titanate, popular negative electrode material for high power
applications, but there are still some points to be clarified. This work
presents a detailed thermal Raman study for lithium titanate and discusses the
difference of the number of predicted and experimentally observed Raman-active
bands. The low temperature study and the analysis of thermal shifts of bands
positions during heating let us to conclude about advantages of the proposed
approach with surplus bands and recommend using shifts of major band to

<h3>A New Physical Picture of Pairing Mechanism in Superconductors: Could  the Electron be a Composite Particle?</h3>

<br>
<br>
The physical pictures of the electron pairing structure and pairing
mechanisms in superconductors are reviewed. An initial idea for a new physical
picture of the origin and nature of the pairing is proposed. The idea is based
on the assumption that the electron is no longer a single fundamental but a
composite particle. This property is hidden in the normal state. How a natural
pairing could occur in the superconducting state and the processes closely
related to this change inside the atom are developed in a new physical picture
with new insight(although it needs verification and real evidence for now). An
attempt, to show that a zero resistance to a direct current and Josephson
effects could be used as example evidences for this assumption, is presented by
means of this new insight in general schematical analogy. A possible new
research direction, hopefully to achieve room temperature superconductors, is
suggested as a consequence.

<h3>Topological nonsymmorphic insulator versus Dirac semimetal in KZnBi</h3>

<br>
<br>
KZnBi was discovered recently as a new three-dimensional (3D) Dirac semimetal
with a pair of bulk Dirac fermions in contrast to the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ trivial
insulator reported earlier. In order to address this discrepancy, we have
performed electronic structure and topological state analysis of KZnBi using
the local, semilocal, and hybrid exchange-correlation (XC) functionals within
the density functional theory framework. We find that various XC functionals,
including the SCAN meta-GGA and hybrid functionals with 25$\%$ Hartree-Fock
(HF) exchange, resolve a topological nonsymmorphic insulator state with the
glide-mirror protected hourglass surface Dirac fermions. By carefully tuning
the modified Becke-Jhonson (mBJ) potential parameters, we recover the correct
orbital ordering and Dirac semimetal state of KZnBi. We further show that
increasing the default HF exchange in hybrid functionals ($> 40\%$) can also
capture the desired Dirac semimetal state with the correct orbital ordering of
KZnBi. The calculated energy dispersion and carrier velocities of Dirac states
are found to be in excellent agreement with the available experimental results.
Our results demonstrate that KZnBi is a unique topological material where large
electron correlations are crucial to realize the Dirac semimetal state.

Tin perovskites are the most promising environmentally friendly alternative
to lead perovskites. Among tin perovskites, FASnI3 (CH4N2SnI3) shows optimum
band gap, and easy processability. However, the performance of FASnI3 based
solar cells is incomparable to lead perovskites for several reasons, including
energy band mismatch between the perovskite absorber film and the charge
transporting layers (CTLs) for both types of carriers, i.e., for electrons
(ETLs) and holes (HTLs). However, the band diagrams in the literature are
inconsistent, and the charge extraction dynamics are poorly understood. In this
paper, we study the energy band positions of FASnI3 based perovskites using
Kelvin probe (KP) and photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS) to provide a
precise band diagram of the most used device stack. In addition, we analyze the
defects within the current energetic landscape of tin perovskites. We uncover
the role of bathocuproine (BCP) in enhancing the electron extraction at the
fullerene C60/BCP interface. Furthermore, we used transient surface
photovoltage (tr-SPV) for the first time for tin perovskites to understand the
charge extraction dynamics of the most reported HTLs such as NiOx and PEDOT,
and ETLs such as C60, ICBA, and PCBM. Finally, we used Hall effect, KP, and
time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) to estimate an accurate value of the
p-doping concentration in FASnI3 and showed a consistent result of 1.5 * 1017
cm-3. Our findings prove that the energetic system of tin halide perovskites is
deformed and should be redesigned independently from lead perovskites to unlock
the full potential of tin perovskites.

The Comment's author argues that a correct description of reactive systems
should incorporate the explicit interaction with reservoirs, leading to a
unified system-reservoirs entity. However, this proposition has two major
flaws. Firstly, as we will emphasize, this entity inherently follows a
thermodynamic equilibrium distribution. In the Comment, no indication is
provided on how to maintain such a system-reservoirs entity in a
non-equilibrium state. Secondly, contrary to the author's claim, the inclusion
of system-reservoir interaction in traditional stochastic modeling of reactive
systems does not automatically alter the limited applicability of path
thermodynamics to problematic reactive systems. We will provide a simple
demonstration to illustrate that certain elementary reactions may not involve
any changes in reservoir components, which seems to have been overlooked by the
author.

Nickelate superconductors are outstanding materials with intriguing analogies
with the cuprates. These analogies suggest that their superconducting mechanism
is similarly unconventional, although this fundamental question is currently
under debate. Here, we scrutinize the role played by electronic correlations in
enhancing the electron-phonon coupling in the infinite-layer nickelates and the
extent to which this may promote superconductivity. Specifically, we use $ab$
$initio$ many-body perturbation theory to perform state-of-the-art $GW$ and
Eliashberg-theory calculations. We find that the electron-phonon coupling is in
effect enhanced compared to density-functional-theory calculations. This
enhancement may lead to low-$T_c$ superconductivity in the parent compounds
already. However, it remains marginal in the sense that it cannot explain the
record $T_c$s obtained with doping. Conventional superconductivity then appears
to be preempted by another mechanism in the infinite-layer nickelates.

<h3>Majorana fermion induced power-law scaling in the violation of  Wiedemann-Franz law</h3>

<br>

Violation of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law in a 2D topological insulator due
to Majorana bound states (MBS) is studied via the Lorenz ratio in the
single-particle picture. We study the scaling of the Lorenz ratio in the
presence and absence of MBS with inelastic scattering modeled using a
B\"uttiker voltage-temperature probe. We compare our results with that seen in
a quantum dot junction in the Luttinger liquid picture operating in the
topological Kondo regime. We find that the scaling of the Lorenz ratio in our
setup corresponds to the scaling in the Luttinger-liquid setup only when both
phase and momentum relaxation occur, but not when only phase relaxation occurs.
This suggests that the interplay between the presence of Majorana bound states
and the type of inelastic scattering process, can have a significant impact on
the violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in 2D topological insulators.

<br>
<br>
We synthesize CoFeRuSn equiatomic quaternary Heusler alloy using arc-melt
technique and investigate its structural, magnetic and transport properties.
The room temperature powder X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that CoFeRuSn
crystallizes in cubic crystal structure with small amount of DO3 - disorder.
The field dependence of magnetization shows non-zero but small hysteresis and
saturation behavior up to room temperature, indicating soft ferromagnetic
nature of CoFeRuSn. The magnetic moment estimated from the magnetization data
is found to be 4.15 {\mu}B / f.u., which is slightly less than the expected
Slater-Pauling rule. The deviation in the value of experimentally observed
moment from the theoretical value might be due to small disorder in the
crystal. The low temperature fit to electrical resistivity data show absence of
quadratic temperature dependence of resistivity, suggesting half-metallic
behavior of CoFeRuSn. The high Curie temperature and possible half-metallic
behavior of CoFeRuSn make it a highly promising candidate for room temperature
spintronic applications.

We report on the dependence of curvilinear shaped coplanar waveguides on the

techniques on either concentrically or eccentrically shaped antennas, we show
how the link budget is directly affected by the spin wave interference, in good
agreement with near-field diffraction simulations. This work demonstrates the
feasibility to inductively probe a magnon interference pattern with a
resolution down to 1$\mu$m$^2$, and provides a methodology for shaping spin
wave beams from an antenna design. This methodology is successfully implemented

A spin system is studied, with simultaneous permutation-symmetric Potts and

The global phase diagram is calculated from the renormalizaton-group solution
with the recently improved (spontaneous first-order detecting) Migdal-Kadanoff
approximation or, equivalently, with hierarchical lattices with the inclusion
of effective vacancies. Five different ordered phases are found: conventionally
ordered ferromagnetic, quadrupolar, antiferromagnetic phases and algebraically
ordered antiferromagnetic, antiquadrupolar phases. These five different ordered
phases and the disordered phase are mutually bounded by first- and second-order
phase transitions, themselves delimited by multicritical points: inverted
bicritical, zero-temperature bicritical, tricritical, second-order bifurcation,
and zero-temperature highly degenerate multicritical points. One rich phase
diagram topology exhibits all of these phenomena.

A unique co-existence of extremely large magnetoresistance (XMR) and
topological characteristics in non-magnetic rare-earth monopnictides
stimulating intensive research on these materials. Yttrium monobismuthide (YBi)
has been reported to exhibit XMR up to 105% but its Topological properties
still need clarification. Here we use the hybrid density functional theory to
probe the structural, electronic and topological properties of YBi in detail.
We observe that YBi is topologically trivial semimetal at ambient pressure
which is in accordance with reported experimental results. The topological
phase transitions i.e., trivial to non-trivial are obtained with volumetric
pressure of 6.5 GPa and 3% of epitaxial strain. This topological phase
transitions are well within the structural phase transition of YBi (24.5 GPa).
The topological non-trivial state is characterized by band inversions among Y-d
band and Bi-p band near {\Gamma}- and X-point in the Brillouin zone. This is
further verified with the help of surface band structure along (001) plane. The
Z2 topological invariants are calculated with the help of product of parities
and evolution of Wannier charge centers. The occurrence of non-trivial phase in
YBi with a relatively small epitaxial strain, which a thin film geometry can
naturally has, might make it an ideal candidate to probe inter-relationship
between XMR and non-trivial topology.

A spin-glass system with a smooth or fractal outer surface is studied by
renormalization-group theory, in bulk spatial dimension d=3. Independently
varying the surface and bulk random-interaction strengths, phase diagrams are
calculated. The smooth surface does not have spin-glass ordering in the absence
of bulk spin-glass ordering and always has spin-glass ordering when the bulk is
spin-glass ordered. With fractal (d>2) surfaces, a sponge is obtained and has
surface spin-glass ordering also in the absence of bulk spin-glass ordering.
The phase diagram has the only-surface-spin-glass ordered phase, the bulk and
surface spin-glass ordered phase, and the disordered phase, and a special
multicritical point where these three phases meet. All spin-glass phases have
distinct chaotic renormalization-group trajectories, with distinct Lyapunov and
runaway exponents which we have calculated.

We study a one-dimensional mixture of two-color fermions and scalar bosons at
the hard-core limit, focusing on the effect that the next-neighbor interaction
between fermions has on the zero-temperature ground state of the system for
different fillings of each carrier. Exploring the parameters of the problem, we
observed that the non-local interaction modifies the well-known mixed and
spin-selective Mott insulators, and we also found the emergence of three
unusual insulating states with peculiar charge density wave orderings, a fully
out-of-phase density of carriers for bosonic half-filling, an insulator with
the same bosonic and fermionic fillings, and a different spin-selective
insulator where the bosonic filling matches the density of one kind of fermion.
Modern cold-atom setups correspond to the ideal experimental setting where
these incommensurable insulators can be observed.

Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), a wide bandgap, two-dimensional solid-state

h-BN exhibiting optically detected magnetic resonance at room temperature, and
we propose a model for its electronic structure and optical dynamics. Using
photon emission correlation spectroscopy in conjunction with time-domain
optical and microwave experiments, we establish key features of the emitter's
electronic structure. Specifically, we propose a model that includes a spinless
optical ground and excited state, a metastable spin-1/2 configuration, and an
emission modulation mechanism. Using optical and spin dynamics simulations, we
constrain and quantify transition rates in the model, and we design protocols
that optimize the signal-to-noise ratio for spin readout. This constitutes a
necessary step toward quantum control of spin states in h-BN.

transition channels with s, p, and d character, enhancing multipole transitions
that contribute to the pre-peak. The RIXS spectra at K and L1 edges are
remarkably similar, opening the way to soft X-ray RIXS experiments to probe
semi-core s states. The RIXS calculations reveal two distinct regimes based on
the behavior with incoming photon energy ($\omega_1$). For $\omega_1$ in
resonance with the XAS threshold, we observe Raman-like behavior, where the
RIXS spectra show significant dependence on $\omega_1$ , reflecting the
coupling between absorption and emission processes. For higher $\omega_1$ ,
above the XAS threshold, the study reveals fluorescence features that appear at
constant emission energy, and can be explained via X-ray emission spectroscopy
(XES).

The dynamical properties of skyrmions can be exploited to build devices with
new functionalities. Here, we first investigate a skyrmion-based ring-shaped
device by means of micromagnetic simulations and Thiele equation. We
subsequently show three applications scenarios: (1) a clock with tunable
frequency that is biased with an electrical current having a radial spatial
distribution, (2) an alternator, where the skyrmion circular motion driven by
an engineered anisotropy gradient is converted into an electrical signal, and
(3) an energy harvester, where the skyrmion motion driven by a thermal gradient
is converted into an electrical signal, thus providing a heat recovery
operation. We also show how to precisely tune the frequency and amplitude of
the output electrical signals by varying material parameters, geometrical
parameters, number and velocity of skyrmions, and we further prove the correct
device functionality under realistic conditions given by room temperature and
internal material defects. Our results open a new route for the realization of
energy efficient nanoscale clocks, generators, and energy harvesters.

Odd-frequency pairing is an unconventional type of Cooper pairing in
superconductors related to the frequency dependence of the corresponding
anomalous Green function. We show by a combination of analytical and numerical
methods that odd-frequency pairing is ubiquitously present in the current of
Andreev-scattered particles across a junction formed by a normal metal (N) and
a superconductor (S), even if the superconducting pairing is of conventional
$s$-wave, spin singlet type. We carefully analyze the conductance of NS
junctions with different pairing symmetries ($s$-wave, $p$-wave, $d$-wave). In
all cases, we identify a generic equal balance of even and odd frequency
pairing to the contributions related to Andreev reflection. This analysis shows
in retrospect that the presence of odd-frequency pairing in electric currents
across NS junctions is rather the rule, not the exception. This insight stems
from an alternative approach of analyzing the transport problem of hybrid
structures. It is based on the Kubo-Greenwood formula with direct access to
symmetries of the anomalous Green functions characterizing the superconducting
pairing. We expect that our predictions substantially enrich the interpretation
of transport data across NS junctions in many material combinations.

Intrinsic magnetic topological insulators have emerged as a promising
platform to study the interplay between topological surface states and
ferromagnetism. This unique interplay can give rise to a variety of exotic
quantum phenomena, including the quantum anomalous Hall effect and axion
insulating states. Here, utilizing molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), we present a
comprehensive study of the growth of high-quality MnBi2Te4 thin films on Si
(111), epitaxial graphene, and highly ordered pyrolytic graphite substrates. By
combining a suite of in-situ characterization techniques, we obtain critical
insights into the atomic-level control of MnBi2Te4 epitaxial growth. First, we
extract the free energy landscape for the epitaxial relationship as a function
of the in-plane angular distribution. Then, by employing an optimized
layer-by-layer growth, we determine the chemical potential and Dirac point of
the thin film at different thicknesses. Overall, these results establish a
foundation for understanding the growth dynamics of MnBi2Te4 and pave the way
for the future applications of MBE in emerging topological quantum materials.

<h3>Superconductivity-induced improper orders</h3>

The study of improper phases in the context of multiferroic materials has a
long history, but superconductivity has yet to be connected to the network of
ferroic orders. In this work, we highlight an overlooked mechanism that couples
superconducting order parameters to odd-parity orders in the charge or spin
sectors such that the latter emerge as improper orders. For that, we explore a
novel perspective of nonsymmorphic symmetries based on extended symmetry groups
in real space. We highlight how nonsymmorphic symmetries can generate rather
nonintuitive couplings between order parameters. In particular, we find that a
bilinear in the superconducting order parameter can couple linearly to
odd-parity orders in centrosymmetric systems. Our findings can account for the
unusual phenomenology of CeRh$_2$As$_2$, a recently discovered heavy fermion
superconductor, and open the door for exploring nonsymmorphic symmetries in the
broader context of improper orders with potential applications to functional
materials.
