<h3>Hydrodynamic magnetotransport in two-dimensional electron systems with  macroscopic obstacles</h3>

In high-quality conductors, the hydrodynamic regime of electron transport has
been recently realized. In this work we theoretically investigate
magnetotransport of a viscous electron fluid in samples with
electron-impermeable obstacles. We use the two approaches to describe the fluid
flow. The first one is based on the equations of hydrodynamics of a charged
fluid, which assume that the kinetic equation takes into account the two
harmonics of the electron distribution function. The second approach is based
on the equations that are obtained by taking into account three harmonics of
the distribution function (''quasi-hydrodynamics''). Within the hydrodynamic
approach, we consider the cases of the rough and the smooth edges of the disks,
on which the electron scattering is diffusive or specular, respectively. The
longitudinal magnetoresistivity turns out to be strong and negative, the same
for both rough and smooth discs edges to within small corrections. For rough
discs, the Hall resistivity is equal to its standard value. For smooth discs
the Hall resistance acquire a small correction to the standard value,
proportional to the Hall viscosity. In the quasi-hydrodynamic approach, we
considered the case of smooth discs and small magnetic fields. In the regime
when the flow is substantially different from the hydrodynamic one, the
longitudinal resistivity does not depend on the shear stress relaxation time
(but depends on the relaxation time of the third angular harmonic), while the
correction to the standard Hall resistivity does not depend on both relaxation
times. We compare the results of the hydrodynamic calculation of the
longitudinal resistance with the experimental data on magnetotransport in
high-quality GaAs quantum wells with macroscopic defects. A good agreement of
theory and experiment evidences in favor of the realization of the hydrodynamic
transport regime in such systems.

<h3>Exact Quantum Many-Body Scars in Higher-Spin Kinetically Constrained  Models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06357" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06357</a>
<br>
<i>Dong Yuan, Shun-Yao Zhang, Dong-Ling Deng</i>
<br>
<br>
We discover a variety of exact quantum many-body scars in higher-spin
kinetically constrained models, through the recently developed DMRG-S algorithm
[Zhang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 020402]. Specifically, for the higher-spin
PXP model on arbitrary bipartite lattices of any spatial dimension, we find
exact many-body scars that are equidistantly spaced in the energy spectrum and
exhibit similar structures to the ground state of the
Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. For the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model
with a tilted potential in a certain parameter regime, whose effective model is
equivalent to a kinetically constrained spin model with four degrees of freedom
on each site, we find several many-body scars at energy $E=0$ and $E=\pm
\sqrt{2}$ that can be exactly represented as matrix product states with finite
bond dimensions. Our results demonstrate that larger local degrees of freedom
in the kinetically constrained models provide a much broader space for the
emergence of quantum many-body scars and weak ergodicity breaking.

<h3>Emergent dynamics of scale-free interactions in fractional quantum Hall  fluids</h3>

We show that even in the limit of large cyclotron gap, Landau level (LL)
mixing can be dominant with scale-free interaction between charged ``elementary
particles" in a fractional quantum Hall system, as long as the filling factor
exceeds certain critical values. The corresponding Hamiltonians with scale-free
interaction can serve as exact model Hamiltonians for certain composite Fermion
or parton states (unlike the well-known TK Hamiltonians where the number of LLs
needs to be fixed by hand), and they are natural physical Hamiltonians for 2D
systems embedded in higher-dimensional space-time. Even with LL mixing the null
spaces of such Hamiltonians (spanned by the ground state and the quasiholes)
can be analytically obtained, and we show these are the generalisation of the
conformal Hilbert spaces (CHS) to more than one LLs. The effective interaction
between the anyons for these topological phases emerges from the kinetic energy
of the ``elementary particles", leading to an interesting duality between
strongly and weakly interacting systems that can be easily understood via the
tuning of parameters in the scale-free interaction. We also propose a novel
experimental platform for approximately realising such model Hamiltonians with
trion like particles, that can potentially lead to very robust (non-Abelian)
FQH phases from two-body Coulomb-based interaction.

Localized or propagating Majorana boundary modes are the key feature of
topological superconductors. While being a rarity in natural compounds, the
tailored manipulation of quantum matter offers novel opportunities for their
realization. Specifically, lattices of Shiba bound states that arise when
magnetic adatoms are placed on the surface of a conventional superconductor can
be used to create topological minibands within the superconducting gap of the
substrate. Here, we exploit the possibilities of scanning tunneling microscopy
to create and probe adatom lattices with single atom precision to create
topological crystalline superconductors. Their topological character and
boundary modes are protected by the spatial symmetries of the adatom lattice.
We combine scanning probe spectroscopy, spin-sensitive measurements, first
principle calculations, and theoretical modeling to to reveal signatures
consistent with the realization of two types of mirror-symmetry protected
topological superconductors: (i) with full bulk gap and topological edge as
well as higher-order corner states and (ii) with symmetry-protected bulk nodal
points. Our results show the immense versatility of Shiba lattices to design
the topology and sample geometry of 2D superconductors.

<h3>Two-dimension to three-dimension transition of chiral spin liquid and  fractional quantum Hall phases</h3>

There have been lots of interest in two-dimensional (2D) fractional phases
with an emergent U (1) gauge field. However, many experimental realizations are
actually in three-dimensional (3D) systems with infinitely stacked 2D layers.
Then a natural question arises: starting from the decoupling limit with 2+1d U
(1) gauge field in each layer, how does the gauge field become 3+1d when
increasing inter-layer coupling? Here we propose a 2D to 3D transition through
condensing inter-layer exciton. The Goldstone mode of the condensation becomes
the missing az component in the 3D phase. As a simple example, we construct a
3D chiral spin liquid (CSL) from infinitely stacked 2D CSL. The 3D CSL has a
gapless photon mode with dispersion $\omega \sim q_z^2$ in the z-direction. The
same theory also applies to the fractional quantum Hall phase. At the 2D to the
3D transition point, there are gapless modes at each $q_z$ along a line $q =
(0,0,q_z)$ in momentum space, in contrast to a conventional critical point with
gapless mode only at one momentum. Meanwhile, the scaling dimension $\Delta
(q_z)$ has $q_z$ dependence, indicating a more non-trivial structure than a
simple decoupled fixed point. Our theory can also be generalized to a critical
point between a generic infinite component Chern-Simons-Maxwell theory (iCSM)
with both intra-layer and inter-layer Chern Simons term and a 3D gapless phase.
Certain iCSM theories have recently been shown to describe gapped non-foliated
fracton orders. Therefore we have a continuous transition between a gapped
fracton order and a 3D gapless phase.

<h3>Haldane phases and phase diagrams of the S = 3/2, 1 bilinear-biquadratic  Heisenberg model on the orthogonal dimer chain</h3>

<br>
<br>
We systematically study the effects of higher-order interactions on the S =
3/2, 1 orthogonal dimer chains using exact diagonalization and density matrix
renormalization group. Due to frustration and higher spin, there are rich
quantum phases, including three Haldane phases, two gapless phases and several
magnetically ordered phases. To characterize these phases and their phase
transitions, we study various physical quantities such as energy gap, energy
level crossing, fidelity susceptibility, spin correlation, entanglement
spectrum and central charge. According to our calculations, the biquadratic
term can enhance the Haldane phase regions. In particular, we numerically
identify that a Haldane phase in S = 3/2 case is adiabatically connected to the
exact AKLT point when adding bicubic term. Our study on the orthogonal dimer
model, which is a 1D version of Shastry-Sutherland model, provides insights
into understanding the possible S = 3/2, 1 Haldane phases in quasi-1D and 2D
frustrated magnetic materials.

<h3>Noise-induced transport in the Aubry-AndrÃ©-Harper model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06373" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06373</a>
<br>
<i>Devendra Singh Bhakuni, TalÃ­a L. M. Lezama, Yevgeny Bar Lev</i>
<br>
<br>
We study quantum transport in a quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH)
model induced by the coupling of the system to a Markovian heat bath. We find
that coupling the heat bath locally does not affect transport in the
delocalized and critical phases, while it induces logarithmic transport in the
localized phase. Increasing the number of coupled sites at the central region
introduces a transient diffusive regime, which crosses over to logarithmic
transport in the localized phase and in the delocalized regime to ballistic
transport. On the other hand, when the heat bath is coupled to equally spaced
sites of the system, we observe a crossover from ballistic and logarithmic
transport to diffusion in the delocalized and localized regimes, respectively.
We propose a classical master equation, which captures our numerical
observations for both coupling configurations on a qualitative level and for
some parameters, even on a quantitative level. Using the classical picture, we
show that the crossover to diffusion occurs at a time that increases
exponentially with the spacing between the coupled sites, and the resulting
diffusion constant decreases exponentially with the spacing.

<h3>Charge response function probed by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering:  the signature of electronic gaps of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-Î´}$</h3>

<br>
In strongly correlated systems the complete determination of the dynamical
susceptibility $\chi(\textbf{q}, \omega)$ is of special relevance because of
the entwinement of the spin and charge components. Although Resonant Inelastic
X-Ray Scattering (RIXS) spectra are directly related to both the charge
($\chi''_c(\textbf{q}, \omega)$) and the spin ($\chi''_s(\textbf{q}, \omega)$)
contributions, only the latter has been extensively studied with RIXS so far.
Here we show how to extract from RIXS spectra of high-$T_c$ superconducting
cuprates relevant properties of $\chi''_c$, such as the presence of the
superconducting gap and of the pseudogap. In particular, we exploit the
temperature dependence of the Cu L$_3$ edge RIXS spectra of underdoped
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ at specific wave-vectors q. The signature of the
two gaps is in the departure of the low energy Bosonic excitation continuum
from the statistical temperature-dependence. This approach can be immediately
used to investigate systematically the nature of the pseudogap in cuprates,
thereby taking advantage of the RIXS technique that does not suffer the
limitations of surface-sensitive electron spectroscopies. Its extension to
other interesting materials is foreseen.

<h3>Machine Learning Accelerated Discovery of Corrosion-resistant  High-entropy Alloys</h3>

Corrosion has a wide impact on society, causing catastrophic damage to
structurally engineered components. An emerging class of corrosion-resistant
materials are high-entropy alloys. However, high-entropy alloys live in
high-dimensional composition and configuration space, making materials designs
via experimental trial-and-error or brute-force ab initio calculations almost
impossible. Here we develop a physics-informed machine-learning framework to
identify corrosion-resistant high-entropy alloys. Three metrics are used to
evaluate the corrosion resistance, including single-phase formability, surface
energy and Pilling-Bedworth ratios. We used random forest models to predict the
single-phase formability, trained on an experimental dataset. Machine learning
inter-atomic potentials were employed to calculate surface energies and
Pilling-Bedworth ratios, which are trained on first-principles data fast
sampled using embedded atom models. A combination of random forest models and
high-fidelity machine learning potentials represents the first of its kind to
relate chemical compositions to corrosion resistance of high-entropy alloys,
paving the way for automatic design of materials with superior corrosion
protection. This framework was demonstrated on AlCrFeCoNi high-entropy alloys
and we identified composition regions with high corrosion resistance. Machine
learning predicted lattice constants and surface energies are consistent with
values by first-principles calculations. The predicted single-phase formability
and corrosion-resistant compositions of AlCrFeCoNi agree well with experiments.
This framework is general in its application and applicable to other materials,
enabling high-throughput screening of material candidates and potentially
reducing the turnaround time for integrated computational materials
engineering.

<h3>Random lasing in a solution of reflective colloidal particles: the  effect of interfaces and inter-particle correlations</h3>

The propagation of light across 2D and 3D slabs of reflective colloidal
particles in a fluid-like state has been investigated by simulation. The
colloids are represented as hard spheres with and without an attractive
square-well tail. Representative configurations of particles have been
generated by Monte Carlo. The path of rays entering the slab normal to its
planar surface has been determined by exact geometric scattering conditions,
assuming that particles are macroscopic spheres fully reflective at the surface
of their hard-core potential. The analysis of light paths provides the
transmission and reflection coefficients, the mean-free path, the average
length of transmitted and reflected paths, the distribution of scattering
events across the slab, and the angular spread of the outcoming rays as a
function of dimensionality and thermodynamic state. The results highlight the
presence of a sizeable population of very long paths, which play an important
role in random lasing from solutions of metal particles in an optically active
fluid. The output power spectrum resulting from the stimulated emission
amplification decays asymptotically as an inverse power law. The present study
goes beyond the standard approach based on a random walk confined between two
planar interfaces and parametrised in terms of the mean-free path and
scattering matrix. Here, instead, the mean free path, the correlation among
scattering events, and memory effects are not assumed a priori but emerge from
the underlying statistical mechanics model of interacting particles. Moreover,
the approach joins smoothly the ballistic regime of light propagation at low
density with the diffusive regime at high density of scattering centres. These
properties are exploited to investigate the effect of weak polydispersivity and
of large density fluctuations at the critical point of the model with the
attractive potential tail.

Exploring anisotropy and diverse magnetization dynamics in specimens with
vanishing magnetic moments presents a significant challenge using traditional
magnetometry, as the low resolution of existing techniques hinders the ability
to obtain accurate results. In this study, we delve deeper into the examination
of magnetic anisotropy and quasi-static magnetization dynamics in \mrg\,(MRG)
thin films, as an example of a compensated ferrimagnetic half-metal, by
employing anomalous Hall effect measurements within a tetragonal crystal
lattice system. Our research proposes an innovative approach to accurately
determine the complete set of anisotropy constants of these MRG thin films. To
achieve this, we perform anomalous Hall voltage curve fitting, using torque
models under the macrospin approximation, which allow us to obtain out-of-plane
anisotropy constants $K_1=4.0\times10^4$ J m$^{-3}$ ($K_1/M=0.655$\,T) and
$K_2=2.54\times10^4$ J m$^{-3}$ ($K_2/M=0.416$\,T), along with a weaker
in-plane anisotropy constant $K_3=3.48\times10^3$ J m$^{-3}$
($K_3/M=0.057$\,T). By additionally employing first-order reversal curves
(FORC) and classical Preisach hysteresis (hysterons) models, we are able to
validate the efficacy of the macrospin model in capturing the magnetic behavior
of MRG thin films. Furthermore, our investigation substantiates that the
complex quasi-static magnetization dynamics of MRG thin films can be
effectively modelled using a combination of hysteronic and torque models. This
approach facilitates the exploration of both linear and non-linear quasi-static
magnetization dynamics, in the presence of external magnetic field and/or
current-induced effective fields, generated by the spin-orbit torque and spin
transfer torque mechanisms.

Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are promising candidates for
optoelectronic application and quantum information processes due to their
inherent out-of-plane 2D confinement. In addition, they offer the possibility
of achieving low-dimensional in-plane exciton confinement, similar to
zero-dimensional quantum dots, with intriguing optical and electronic
properties via strain or composition engineering. However, realizing such
laterally confined 2D monolayers and systematically controlling size-dependent
optical properties remain significant challenges. Here, we report the
observation of lateral confinement of excitons in epitaxially grown in-plane
MoSe2 quantum dots (~15-60 nm wide) inside a continuous matrix of WSe2
monolayer film via a sequential epitaxial growth process. Various optical
spectroscopy techniques reveal the size-dependent exciton confinement in the
MoSe2 monolayer quantum dots with exciton blue shift (12-40 meV) at a low
temperature as compared to continuous monolayer MoSe2. Finally, single-photon
emission was also observed from the smallest dots at 1.6 K. Our study opens the
door to compositionally engineered, tunable, in-plane quantum light sources in
2D semiconductors.

<h3>Mean-squared displacement and variance for confined Brownian motion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06429" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06429</a>

For one-dimension Brownian motion in the confined system with the size $L$,
the mean-squared displacement(MSD) defined by $\left \langle (x-x_0)^2
\right\rangle$ should be proportional to $t^{\alpha(t)}$. The power $\alpha(t)$
should range from $1$ to $0$ over time, and the MSD turns from $2Dt$ to $c
L^2$, here the coefficient $c$ independent of $t$, $D$ being the diffusion
coefficient. The paper aims to quantitatively solve the MSD in the intermediate
confinement regime. The key to this problem is how to deal with the propagator
and the normalization factor of the Fokker-Planck equation(FPE) with the
Dirichlet Boundaries. Applying the Euler-Maclaurin approximation(EMA) and
integration by parts for the small $t$, we obtain the MSD being
$2Dt(1-\frac{2\sqrt{\xi} }{3\pi\sqrt{\pi}})$, with
$t_{ch}=\frac{L^2}{4\pi^2D},\xi\equiv \frac{t}{t_{ch}}$, and the power
$\alpha(t)$ being $\frac{1-0.18\sqrt{\xi}}{1-0.12\sqrt{\xi}}$. Further, we
analysis the MSD and the power for the $d$-dimension system with
$\gamma$-dimension confinement. In the case of $\gamma< d$, there exists the
sub-diffusive behavior in the intermediate time. The universal description is
consistent with the recent experiments and simulations in the micro-nano
systems. Finally, we calculate the position variance(PV) meaning $\left\langle
(x-\left\langle x \right\rangle)^2 \right\rangle$. Under the initial condition
referring to the different probability density function(PDF) being $p_{0}(x)$,
MSD and PV should exhibit different dependencies on time, which reflect
corresponding diffusion behaviors.As examples, the paper discusses the
representative initial PDFs reading $p_{0}(x)=\delta(x-x_0)$, with the midpoint
$x_0=\frac{L}{2}$ and the endpoint $x_0=\epsilon$(or $0^+$).The MSD(equal to
PV) reads $2Dt(1-\frac{5\pi^3 Dt}{L^2})$,and
$\frac{4}{\pi}(2Dt)[1+\frac{2\sqrt{\pi Dt}}{L}]$for the small $t$,respectively.

<h3>Probing NV and SiV charge state dynamics using high-voltage nanosecond  pulse and photoluminescence spectral analysis</h3>

Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) and silicon-vacancy (SiV) color defects in diamond are
promising systems for applications in quantum technology. The NV and SiV
centers have multiple charge states, and their charge states have different
electronic, optical and spin properties. For the NV centers, most
investigations for quantum sensing applications are targeted on the negatively
charged NV (NV$^{-}$), and it is important for the NV centers to be in the
NV$^{-}$ state. However, it is known that the NV centers are converted to the
neutrally charged state (NV$^{0}$) under laser excitation. An energetically
favorable charge state for the NV and SiV centers depends on their local
environments. It is essential to understand and control the charge state
dynamics for their quantum applications. In this work, we discuss the charge
state dynamics of NV and SiV centers under high-voltage nanosecond pulse
discharges. The NV and SiV centers coexist in the diamond crystal. The
high-voltage pulses enable manipulating the charge states efficiently. These
voltage-induced changes in charge states are probed by their photoluminescence
spectral analysis. The analysis result from the present experiment shows that
the high-voltage nanosecond pulses cause shifts of the chemical potential and
can convert the charge states of NV and SiV centers with the transition rates
of $\sim$ MHz. This result also indicates that the major population of the SiV
centers in the sample is the doubly negatively charged state (SiV$^{2-}$),
which is often overlooked because of its non-fluorescent and non-magnetic
nature. This demonstration paves a path for a method of rapid manipulation of
the NV and SiV charge states in the future.

This article reports a comparative study of bulk and surface properties in
the transition metal dichalcogenide 1T-TaS$_2$. When heating the sample, the
surface displays an intermediate insulating phase that persists for $\sim 10$ K
on top of a metallic bulk. The weaker screening of Coulomb repulsion and
stiffer Charge Density Wave (CDW) explain such resilience of a correlated
insulator in the topmost layers. Both time resolved ARPES and transient
reflectivity are employed to investigate the dynamics of electrons and CDW
collective motion. It follows that the amplitude mode is always stiffer at the
surface and displays variable coupling to the Mott-Peierls band, stronger in
the low temperature phase and weaker in the intermediate one.

While topology is a property of a quantum state itself, most existing methods
for characterizing the topology of interacting phases of matter require direct
knowledge of the underlying Hamiltonian. We offer an alternative by utilizing
the one-particle density matrix formalism to extend the concept of the Chern,
chiral, and Chern-Simons markers to include interactions. The one-particle
density matrix of a free-fermion state is a projector onto the occupied bands,
defining a Brillouin zone bundle of the given topological class. This is no
longer the case in the interacting limit, but as long as the one-particle
density matrix is gapped, its spectrum can be adiabatically flattened,
connecting it to a topologically equivalent projector. The corresponding
topological markers thus characterize the topology of the interacting phase.
Importantly, the one-particle density matrix is defined in terms of a given
state alone, making the local markers numerically favorable, and providing an
invaluable tool for characterizing topology of interacting systems when only
the state itself is available. To demonstrate the practical use of the markers
we use the chiral marker to identify the topology of the ground state of the
Majorana-XYZ model as well as the midspectrum eigenstates of the Ising-Majorana
chain across the transition between the ergodic and many-body localized phases.

Many organisms in nature use local interactions to generate global
cooperative phenomena. To unravel how the behavior of individuals generates
effective interactions within a group, we introduce a simple model, wherein
each agent senses the presence of others nearby and changes its physical motion
accordingly. This generates between agents interactions that are not physical
but rather virtual. We study the radial distribution function to quantify the
emergent interactions for both social and anti-social behavior; We identify
social behavior as when an agent exhibits a tendency to remain in the vicinity
of other agents, whereas anti-social behavior as when it displays a tendency to
escape from the vicinity of others. Using Langevin dynamics simulations, we
discover that under certain conditions, positive correlations, which indicate
attraction can emerge even in the case of anti-social behavior. Our results are
potentially useful for designing robotic swimmers that can swim collectively
only based on sensing the distance to their neighbors, without measuring any
orientational information.

Conventional vapor deposition or epitaxial growth of two-dimensional (2D)
materials and heterostructures is conducted in a large chamber in which masses
transport from the source to the substrate. Here we report a chamber-free,
on-chip approach for growing a 2D crystalline structures directly in a
nanoscale surface-confined 2D space. The method is based on a surprising
discovery of a rapid, long-distance, non-Fickian transport of a uniform layer
of atomically thin palladium (Pd) on a monolayer crystal of tungsten
ditelluride (WTe2), at temperatures well below the known melting points of all
materials involved. The resulting nanoconfined growth realizes a controlled
formation of a stable new 2D crystalline material, Pd7WTe2 , when the monolayer
seed is either free-standing or fully encapsulated in a van der Waals stack.
The approach is generalizable and highly compatible with nanodevice
fabrication, promising to expand the library of 2D materials and their
functionalities.

A hallmark of many unconventional superconductors is the presence of
many-body interactions which give rise to broken symmetry states intertwined
with superconductivity. Recent resonant soft x-ray scattering experiments
report commensurate $3a_0$ charge density wave order in the infinite layer
nickelates, which has important implications regarding the universal interplay
between charge order and superconductivity in both the cuprates and nickelates.
Here, we present x-ray scattering and spectroscopy measurements on a series of
NdNiO$_{2+x}$ samples which reveal that the signatures of charge density wave
order are absent in fully reduced, single-phase NdNiO$_2$. The $3a_0$
superlattice peak instead originates from a partially reduced impurity phase
where excess apical oxygens form ordered rows with 3 unit cell periodicity. The
absence of any observable charge density wave order in NdNiO$_2$ highlights a
crucial difference between the phase diagrams of the cuprate and nickelate
superconductors.

<br>
<br>
Low-dimensional ferroelectric tunnel junctions are appealing for the
realization of nanoscale nonvolatile memory devices due to their inherent
advantage of device miniaturization. Those based on current mechanisms still
have restrictions including low tunneling electroresistance (TER) effects and
complex heterostructures. Here, we introduce an entirely new TER mechanism to
construct the nanotube ferroelectric tunnel junction with ferroelectric
nanotubes as the tunneling region. When rolling a ferroelectric monolayer into
a nanotube, due to the coexistence of its intrinsic ferroelectric polarization
with the flexoelectric polarization induced by bending, there occurs
metal-insulator transition depending on radiative polarization states. For the
pristine monolayer, its out-of-plane polarization is tunable by an in-plane
electric field, the conducting states of the ferroelectric nanotube can thus be
tuned between metallic and insulating via axial electric means. Using
{\alpha}-In2Se3 as an example, our first-principles density functional theory
calculations and nonequilibrium Green's function formalism confirm the
feasibility of the TER mechanism and indicate an ultrahigh TER ratio exceeding
9.9*10^10% of the proposed nanotube ferroelectric tunnel junctions. Our
findings provide a promising approach based on simple homogeneous structures
for high density ferroelectric microelectronic devices with excellent ON/OFF
performance.

NaPrTe$_2$, NaNdTe$_2$, and NaTbTe$_2$ are found to be triangular lattice
magnets with the alpha-NaFeO$_2$ structure, where lanthanoid atoms with 4f
electrons form a triangular lattice, based on the structural analysis and
physical property measurements of synthesized polycrystalline samples. The
alpha-NaFeO$_2$ structure is a new polymorph of NaPrTe$_2$, which has been
reported to crystallize in the cubic LiTiO$_2$ structure. Polytypism in
NaPrTe$_2$ was discussed based on the structural parameters determined by the
Rietveld analysis. NaPrTe$_2$ is suggested to be in the proximity of the phase
boundary between the LiTiO$_2$ and alpha-NaFeO$_2$ types, as compared to
NaNdTe$_2$ and NaTbTe$_2$, indicating that this compound might be interesting
from the perspectives of the dimensional control of geometrically frustrated
lattices. The magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity data indicated that
NaPrTe$_2$ do not show long-range magnetic order or a spin-glass transition
above 2$^\circ$ K.

Methylammonium-lead-halide compounds have emerged as promising bandgap
engineering materials due to their ability to fine-tune the energy gap through
halogen element mixing. We present a comprehensive investigation of the
temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) transition characteristics
exhibited by single crystals of chlorine and bromine-based methylammonium lead
halides. MAPbCl3 and MAPbBr3 crystals exhibit a distinct sharp free exciton
transition with an abrupt transition behavior associated with the structural
phase transition as the temperature varies. However, when the two halogen
elements are mixed within the crystals, no structural phase transition is
observed. This study explores the temperature-dependent variations in
integrated PL intensity, full-width-half-maximum, and peak transition energy of
the crystals. The obtained results discuss the intricate interplay between
temperature, crystal structure, and composition, providing valuable insights
into the optical properties and potential applications of organic-inorganic
hybrid methyl-ammonium lead halide single crystals as tunable energy gap
semiconductor materials.

The formation and stability of a sulfur-rich surface of the zinc blende ZnS
(001) single crystal have been examined by x-ray photoemission spectroscopy
(XPS), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and density-functional theory
(DFT) calculations. LEED patterns obtained from ZnS (001) surface prepared in
ultrahigh vacuum conditions are compatible to the formation of the ($1 \times
2$) reconstruction. Further XPS investigation is consistent with the conversion
of the surface region into a sulfur-rich surface. DFT calculations support the
S-richer ZnS surface hypothesis and the indirect notion of increasing in the
conductivity of such a new structure.

The phase distribution in a Bose-Einstein condensate can realize various
topological states which can be classified according to distinct winding
numbers. While states with different winding numbers are topologically
protected in the linear Schr\"odinger equation, when nonlinearities are
introduced, violations of the topological protection can occur, leading to
unwinding. Exciton-polariton condensates constitute a weakly nonlinear open
dissipative system that is well suited to studying such physics. Here we show
that exciton-polariton condensates display a spontaneous phase unwinding from a
$\pi$- to zero-state. While such an effect was previously observed in a
one-dimensional polariton-condensate array and explained as occurring due to
single-particle mode competition, we offer a new explanation in terms of
collective phase unwinding of metastable states. We clarify that the collective
transition is caused by the combined effect of nonlinearity and topological
defects in the condensates. Reanalyzing the experimental data, we find an
evidence of the collective phase unwinding.

With the development of quantum technology, hybrid devices that combine
superconductors (S) and semiconductors (Sm) have attracted great attention due
to the possibility of engineering structures that benefit from the integration
of the properties of both materials. However, until now, none of the
experiments have reported good control of band alignment at the interface,
which determines the strength of S-Sm coupling and the proximitized
superconducting gap. Here, we fabricate hybrid devices in a generic way with
argon milling to modify the interface while maintaining its high quality.
First, after the milling the atomically connected S-Sm interfaces appear,
resulting in a large induced gap, as well as the ballistic transport revealed
by the multiple Andreev reflections and quantized above-gap conductance
plateaus. Second, by comparing transport measurement with Schr\"odinger-Poisson
(SP) calculations, we demonstrate that argon milling is capable of varying the
band bending strength in the semiconducting wire as the electrons tend to
accumulate on the etched surface for longer milling time. Finally, we perform
nonlocal measurements on advanced devices to demonstrate the coexistence and
tunability of crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) and elastic co-tunneling (ECT)
-- key ingredients for building the prototype setup for realization of Kitaev
chain and quantum entanglement probing. Such a versatile method, compatible
with the standard fabrication process and accompanied by the well-controlled
modification of the interface, will definitely boost the creation of more
sophisticated hybrid devices for exploring physics in solid-state systems.

<h3>Dynamical freezing and switching in periodically driven bilayer graphene</h3>

A class of integrable models, such as the one-dimensional transverse-field
Ising model, respond nonmonotonically to a periodic drive with respect to the
driving parameters and freezes almost absolutely for certain combinations of
the latter. In this paper, we go beyond the two-band structure of the
Ising-like models studied previously and ask whether such unusual nonmonotonic
response and near-absolute freezing occur in integrable systems with a higher
number of bands. To this end, we consider a tight-binding model for bilayer
graphene subjected to an interlayer potential difference. We find that when the
potential is driven periodically, the system responds nonmonotonically to
variations in the driving amplitude $V_0$ and frequency $\omega$ and shows near
absolute freezing for certain values of $V_0/\omega$. However, the freezing
occurs only in the presence of a constant bias in the driving, i.e., when $V=
V'+V_0 \cos{\omega t}$. When $V'=0$, the freezing is switched off for all
values of $V_0/\omega$. We support our numerical results with analytical
calculations based on a rotating wave approximation. We also give a proposal to
realize the driven bilayer system via ultracold atoms in an optical lattice,
where the driving can be implemented by shaking the lattice.

<h3>Mapping Orthorhombic Domains with Geometrical Phase Analysis in  Rare-Earth Nickelate Heterostructures</h3>

Most perovskite oxides belong to the Pbnm space group, composed by an
anisotropic unit cell, A-site antipolar displacements and oxygen octahedral
tilts. Mapping the orientation of the orthorhombic unit cell in epitaxial
heterostructures that consist of at least one Pbnm compound is often required
to understand and control the different degrees of coupling established at
their coherent interfaces and, therefore, their resulting physical properties.
However, retrieving this information from the strain maps generated with
high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy can be challenging,
because the three pseudocubic lattice parameters are very similar in these
systems. Here, we present a novel methodology for mapping the crystallographic
orientation in Pbnm systems. It makes use of the geometrical phase analysis
algorithm, as applied to aberration-corrected scanning transition electron
microscopy images, but in an unconventional way. The method is fast and robust,
giving real-space maps of the lattice orientations in Pbnm systems, from both
cross-sectional and plan-view geometries and across large fields of view. As an
example, we apply our methodology to rare-earth nickelate heterostructures, in
order to investigate how the crystallographic orientation of these films
depends on various structural constraints that are imposed by the underlying
single crystal substrates. We observe that the resulting domain distributions
and associated defect landscapes mainly depend on a competition between the
epitaxial compressive/tensile and shear strains, together with the matching of
atomic displacements at the substrate/film interface. The results point towards
strategies for controlling these characteristics by appropriate substrate
choice.

<h3>Structural pathway for nucleation and growth of topologically  close-packed phase from parent hexagonal crystal</h3>

The solid diffusive phase transformation involving the nucleation and growth
of one nucleus is universal and frequently employed but has not yet been fully
understood at the atomic level. Here, our first-principles calculations reveal
a structural formation pathway of a series of topologically close-packed (TCP)
phases within the hexagonally close-packed (hcp) matrix. The results show that
the nucleation follows a nonclassical nucleation process, and the whole
structural transformation is completely accomplished by the shuffle-based
displacements, with a specific 3-layer hcp-ordering as the basic structural
transformation unit. The thickening of plate-like TCP phases relies on forming
these hcp-orderings at their coherent TCP/matrix interface to nucleate ledge,
but the ledge lacks the dislocation characteristics considered in the
conventional view. Furthermore, the atomic structure of the critical nucleus
for the Mg2Ca and MgZn2 Laves phases was predicted in terms of Classical
Nucleation Theory (CNT), and the formation of polytypes and off-stoichiometry
in TCP precipitates is found to be related to the nonclassical nucleation
behavior. Based on the insights gained, we also employed high-throughput
screening to explore several common hcp-metallic (including hcp-Mg, Ti, Zr, and
Zn) systems that may undergo hcp-to-TCP phase transformations. These insights
can deepen our understanding of solid diffusive transformations at the atomic
level, and constitute a foundation for exploring other technologically
important solid diffusive transformations.

<br>
<br>
In nano-scale systems coupled to finite-size reservoirs, the reservoir
temperature may fluctuate due to heat exchange between the system and the
reservoirs. To date, a stochastic thermodynamic analysis of heat, work and
entropy production in such systems is however missing. Here we fill this gap by
analyzing a single-level quantum dot tunnel coupled to a finite-size electronic
reservoir. The system dynamics is described by a Markovian master equation,
depending on the fluctuating temperature of the reservoir. Based on a
fluctuation theorem, we identify the appropriate entropy production that
results in a thermodynamically consistent statistical description. We
illustrate our results by analyzing the work production for a finite-size
reservoir Szilard engine.

Many-body localised phases of disordered, interacting quantum systems allow
for exotic localisation protected quantum order in eigenstates at arbitrarily
high energy densities. In this work, we analyse the manifestation of such order
on the Hilbert-space anatomy of eigenstates. Quantified in terms of non-local
Hilbert-spatial correlations of eigenstate amplitudes, we find that the spread
of the eigenstates on the Hilbert-space graph is directly related to the order
parameters which characterise the localisation protected order, and hence these
correlations, in turn, characterise the order or lack thereof. Higher-point
eigenstate correlations also characterise the different entanglement structures
in the many-body localised phases, with and without order, as well as in the
ergodic phase. The results pave the way for characterising the transitions
between many-body localised phases and the ergodic phase in terms of scaling of
emergent correlation lengthscales on the Hilbert-space graph.

Harnessing spin and parity degrees of freedom is of fundamental importance
for the realization of emergent quantum devices. Nanostructures embedded in
superconductor--semiconductor hybrid materials offer novel and yet unexplored
routes for addressing and manipulating fermionic modes. Here we
spectroscopically probe the two-dimensional band structure of Andreev bound
states in a phase-controlled hybrid three-terminal Josephson junction. Andreev
bands reveal spin-degeneracy breaking, with level splitting in excess of 9 GHz,
and zero-energy crossings associated to ground state fermion parity
transitions, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Both effects occur
without the need of external magnetic fields or sizable charging energies and
are tuned locally by controlling superconducting phase differences. Our results
highlight the potential of multiterminal hybrid devices for engineering quantum
states.

<br>
Properties of superconducting devices depend sensitively on the parity (even
or odd) of the quasiparticles they contain. Encoding quantum information in the
parity degree of freedom is central in several emerging solid-state qubit
architectures. Yet, accurate, non-destructive, and time-resolved parity
measurement is a challenging and long-standing issue. Here we report on control
and real-time parity measurement in a superconducting island embedded in a
superconducting loop and realized in a hybrid two-dimensional heterostructure
using a microwave resonator. Device and readout resonator are located on
separate chips, connected via flip-chip bonding, and couple inductively through
vacuum. The superconducting resonator detects the parity-dependent circuit
inductance, allowing for fast and non-destructive parity readout. We resolved
even and odd parity states with signal-to-noise ratio SNR $\approx3$ with an
integration time of $20~\mu$s and detection fidelity exceeding 98%. Real-time
parity measurement showed state lifetime extending into millisecond range. Our
approach will lead to better understanding of coherence-limiting mechanisms in
superconducting quantum hardware and provide novel readout schemes for hybrid
qubits.

<br>
<br>
In active matter systems, non-Gaussian, exact scaling exponents have been
claimed in a range of systems using perturbative renormalization group (RG)
methods. This is unusual compared to equilibrium systems where non-Gaussian
exponents can typically only be approximated, even using the exact (or
functional/nonperturbative) renormalization group (ERG). Here, we perform an
ERG analysis on the ordered phase of incompressible polar active fluids and
find that the exact non-Gaussian exponents obtained previously using a
perturbative RG method remain valid even in this nonperturbative setting.
Furthermore, our ERG analysis elucidates the RG flow of this system and enables
us to identify an active Goldstone regime with nontrivial, long-ranged scaling
behavior for parallel and longitudinal fluctuations.

Despite the considerable interest for antiferromagnets which appeared with
the perspective of using them for spintronics, their experimental study,
including the imaging of antiferromagnetic textures, remains a challenge. To
address this issue, quantum sensors, and in particular the nitrogen-vacancy
(NV) defects in diamond have become a widespread technical solution. We review
here the recent applications of single NV centers to study a large variety of
antiferromagnetic materials, from quantitative imaging of antiferromagnetic
domains and non-collinear states, to the detection of spin waves confined in
antiferromagnetic textures and the non-perturbative measurement of spin
transport properties. We conclude with recent developments improving further
the magnetic sensitivity of scanning NV microscopy, opening the way to detailed
investigations of the internal texture of antiferromagnetic objects.

Materials that can host macroscopic persistent current are important because
they are useful for energy storage. However, there are very few examples of
such materials in nature. Superconductors are known as an example in which flow
of supercurrent can persist up to 100,000 years. The chiral magnetic current is
possibly the second example predicted by the chiral magnetic effect. It was
proposed to be realized in recently discovered Weyl semimetals. However, a
no-go theorem negates the chiral magnetic effect and shows that the chiral
magnetic current is generally absent in any equilibrium condensed-matter
system. Here we show how to break the no-go theorem by resorting to dynamical
transitions in time-frequency space. By driving an insulator using a
time-periodic potential and coupling it to a phonon heat bath that provides
suitable dissipation, we show that a Floquet-Weyl semi-metallic phase with
Fermi-Dirac-like distribution emerges. Furthermore, we show that even in the
presence of a static magnetic field, the resulting steady Floquet-Weyl
semimetal supports non-vanishing chiral magnetic current. Our dynamical model
provides a systematic way to fully realize the chiral magnetic effect in
condensed matter systems.

The wave nature of matter implies wavepackets with minimal combined
uncertainty in position and momentum, a limit which can hardly be reached for
clouds of large atom numbers of interacting particles. Here, we report on a
high-flux source of ultra-cold atoms realizing near-Heisenberg-limited
expansion rates upon release from the trap. Depending on the value of the
scattering length, we model our system either with a scaling approach based on
the Thomas-Fermi approximation, or with a variational approach based on a
Gaussian atomic density approximation, observing the transition between the
weak and strong interaction regimes. Finally, we discuss applications of our
methods to test foundational principles of quantum mechanics such as the
superposition principle or their extension to other atomic species.

We study an exclusion process on a ring comprising a free defect particle in
a bath of normal particles. The model is one of the few integrable cases in
which the bath particles are partially asymmetric. The presence of the free
defect creates localized or shock phases according to parameter values. We use
a functional approach to Bethe equations resulting from a nested Bethe ansatz
to calculate exactly the mean currents and diffusion constants. The results
agree very well with Monte-Carlo simulations and reveal the main modes of
fluctuation in the different phases of the steady state.

The path integral formulation of quantum mechanical problems including
fermions is often affected by a severe numerical sign problem. We show how such
a sign problem can be alleviated by a judiciously chosen constant imaginary
offset to the path integral. Such integration contour deformations introduce no
additional computational cost to the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm, while its
effective sample size is greatly increased. This makes otherwise unviable
simulations efficient for a wide range of parameters. Applying our method to
the Hubbard model, we find that the sign problem is significantly reduced.
Furthermore, we prove that it vanishes completely for large chemical
potentials, a regime where the sign problem is expected to be particularly
severe without imaginary offsets. In addition to a numerical analysis of such
optimized contour shifts, we analytically compute the shifts corresponding to
the leading and next-to-leading order corrections to the action. We find that
such simple approximations, free of significant computational cost, suffice in
many cases.

recently discovered double-layer high-temperature superconductor
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure. Our calculations reveal dual nature of Ni-$d$
electrons with almost localized $d_{z^2}$ orbitals due to onsite Coulomb
repulsion and very flat hybridization bands of Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and
Ni-$d_{z^2}$ quasiparticles near the Fermi energy. We find that the
quasiparticle effective mass are greatly enhanced by the Hund's rule coupling
and their lifetimes are inversely proportional to the temperature, which
explains the experimentally observed strange metal behavior in the normal
state. We also find strong antiferromagnetic spin correlations of Ni-$d$
electrons, which may provide the pairing force of quasiparticles for the
high-temperature superconductivity. These give a potential explanation of two
key observations in experiment and connect the superconducting
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with cuprate high-temperature superconductors. The presence
of flat bands and the interplay of orbital-selective Mott, Hund, and Kondo
physics make La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ a unique platform for exploring rich emergent
quantum many-body phenomena in the future.

Two-dimensional organic porous networks (2DOPNs) have opened new vistas for
tailoring the physicochemical characteristics of metallic surfaces. These
typically chemically bound nanoporous structures act as periodical quantum
wells leading to the 2D confinements of surface electron gases, adatoms and
molecular guests. Here we propose a new type of porous network with weakly
interacting 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine (TPT) molecules on a Cu(111)
surface, in which a temperature-driven (T-driven) phase transition can
reversibly alter the supramolecular structures from a close-packed (CP-TPT)
phase to a porous-network (PN-TPT) phase. Crucially, only the low-temperature
PN-TPT exhibits subnano-scale cavities that can confine the surface state
electrons and metal adatoms. The confined surface electrons undergo a
significant electronic band renormalization. To activate the spin degree of
freedom, the T-driven PN-TPT structure can additionally trap Co atoms within
the cavities, forming highly ordered quantum dots. Our theoretical simulation
reveals a complex spin carrier transfer from the confined Co cluster to the
neighbouring TPT molecules via the underlying substrate. Our results
demonstrate that weakly interacting 2DOPN offers a unique quantum switch
capable of steering and controlling electrons and spin at surfaces via tailored
quantum confinements.

Two-dimensional metal-organic porous networks (2D-MOPNs) are highly ordered
quantum boxes for exploring surface confinements. In this context, the electron
confinement from occupied Shockley-type surface states (SS) has been vigorously
studied in 2D-MOPNs. In contrast, the confinement of excited surface states,
such as image potential states (IPSs), remains elusive. In this work, we apply
two-photon photoemission to investigate the confinement exemplarily for the
first image state in a Cu-coordinated T4PT porous network (Cu-T4PT). Due to the
lateral potential confinement in the Cu-T4PT, periodic replicas of the IPS as
well as the SS are present in a momentum map. Surprisingly, the first IPS
transforms into a nearly flat band with a substantial increase of the effective
mass (> 150 %), while the band dispersion of the SS is almost unchanged. The
giant confinement effect of the excited electrons can be attributed to the
wavefunction location of the first IPS perpendicular to the surface, where the
majority probability density mainly resides at the same height as repulsive
potentials formed by the Cu-T4PT network. This coincidence leads to a more
effective scattering barrier to the IPS electrons, which is not observed in the
SS. Our findings demonstrate that the vertical potential landscape in a porous
architecture also plays a crucial role in surface electron confinement.

Two-dimensional metal-organic porous networks (2D-MOPNs) have been identified
as versatile nanoarchitectures to tailor surface electronic and magnetic
properties on noble metals. In this context, we propose a protocol to
redecorate a ferromagnetic surface potential landscape using a 2D-MOPN.
Ultrathin cobalt (Co) films grown on Au(111) exhibit a well-ordered surface
triangular reconstruction. On the ferromagnetic surface, the adsorbed
2,4,6-tris(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5triazine (T4PT) molecules can coordinate with the
native Co atoms to form a large-scale Co-T4PT porous network. The Co-T4PT
network with periodic nanocavities serves as a templating layer to reshape the
ferromagnetic surface potential. The subsequently deposited C60 molecules are
steered by the network porous potential and the neighboring C60 interactions.
The prototype of the ferromagnetic-supported 2D-MOPN is a promising template
for the tailoring of molecular electronic and spin properties.

<h3>Impact of vacancies on twisted bilayer graphene quantum point contacts</h3>

<br>
<br>
We carry out an extensive numerical study of low-temperature electronic
transport in quantum point contacts based on twisted bilayer graphene. Assuming
ballistic electron dynamics, quantized plateaus in the conductance are observed
in defect-free samples when the twisting angle is large enough. However,
plateaus are smeared out and hardly noticeable on decreasing the angle. Close
to the magic angle, the conductance around the charge neutrality point drops
significantly and the quantization steps visible at higher angles are no longer
appreciable. Furthermore, we consider the effects of a random distribution of
vacancies on the quantum point contact. Whereas the electron-hole symmetry is
broken in pristine samples, we find that this symmetry is restored upon
increasing the concentration of vacancies. We explain this effect by a
reduction of the effective interlayer coupling due to the presence of the
vacancies.

<h3>Edge state behavior in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger like model with  periodically modulated hopping</h3>

Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model is one of the simplest models to show
topological end/edge states and the existence of Majorana fermions. Here we
consider a SSH like model both in one and two dimensions where a nearest
neighbor hopping features spatially periodic modulations. In the 1D chain, we
witness appearance of new in-gap end states apart from a pair of Majorana zero
modes (MZM) when the hopping periodicity go beyond two lattice spacings. The
pair of MZMs, that appear in the topological regime, characterize the end modes
each existing in either end of the chain. These, however, crossover to both-end
end modes for small hopping detuning strength in a finite chain. Contrarily in
a 2D SSH model with symmetric hopping that we consider, both non-zero and zero
energy topological states appear in a finite square lattice even with a simple
staggered hopping, though the zero energy modes disappear in a ribbon
configuration. Apart from edge modes, the 2D system also features corner modes
as well as modes with satellite peaks distributed non-randomly within the
lattice. In both the dimensions, an increase in the periodicity of hopping
modulation causes the zero energy Majorana modes to become available for either
sign of the detuning. But interestingly with different periodicity for hopping
modulations in the two directions, the zero energy modes in a 2D model become
rarer and does not appear for all strength and sign of the detuning.

<h3>Quartet currents in a biased three-terminal diffusive Josephson junction</h3>

Biasing a three-terminal Josephson junction (TTJ) with symmetrical voltages
$0,V,-V$ leads to new kinds of DC currents, namely quartet Josephson currents
and phase-dependent multiple Andreev reflection (MAR) currents. We study these
currents in a system where a normal diffusive metallic node $N$ is connected to
three terminals $S_{0,1,2}$ by barriers of arbitrary transparency. We use the
quantum circuit theory to calculate the current in each terminal, including
decoherence. In addition to the stationary combination
$\varphi_Q=\varphi_1+\varphi_2-2\varphi_0$ of the terminal phases $\varphi_i$,
the bias voltage $V$ appears as a new and unusual control variable for a DC
Josephson current. A general feature is the sign changes of the current-phase
characteristics, manifesting in minima of the quartet ``critical current".
Those sign changes can be triggered by the voltage, by the junction
transparency or by decoherence. We study the possible separation of quartet
currents from MAR currents in different regimes of parameters, including an
"funnel" regime with very asymmetric couplings to $S_{0,1,2}$. In the regime of
low transparency and asymetric couplings, we provide an analytic perturbative
expression for the currents which shows an excellent agreement with the full
numerical results.

Electrically connected and plasmonically enhanced molecular junctions combine
the optical functionalities of high field confinement and enhancement (cavity
function), and of high radiative efficiency (antenna function) with the
electrical functionalities of molecular transport and electrically driven light
emission. They are supposed to play a leading role in emerging nanoscale
optoelectronic devices; yet, this development is hindered by an insufficient
control and understanding of atomic-scale phenomena that govern the optical and
electrical behavior of plasmonic nanojunctions under ambient operating
conditions. For instance, displacement of a single atom may drastically
influence the junction's conductance and its optical near-field distribution.
Here, we investigate tunneling-induced light emission from a self-assembled
metal-molecule-metal junction embedded in a plasmonic cavity at
room-temperature. We find that despite the presence of hundreds of molecules in
the junction, electrical conductance and light emission are both highly
sensitive to atomic-scale fluctuations - a phenomenology reminiscent of
picocavities observed in Raman scattering and of luminescence blinking from
photo-excited plasmonic junctions. We present a minimal electrical model that
is able to capture all main experimental features. Contrasting with these
microscopic fluctuations, the overall plasmonic and electronic functionalities
of our devices feature an excellent long-term stability and reproducibility at
room temperature and under electrical bias of several volts, allowing for
measurements over several months. Our work contributes to the understanding of
atomic fluctuations in molecular plasmonic junctions and to the development of
more robust and scalable platforms for nanoscale optoelectronics.

Technologies that function at room temperature often require magnets with a
high Curie temperature, $T_\mathrm{C}$, and can be improved with better
materials. Discovering magnetic materials with a substantial $T_\mathrm{C}$ is
challenging because of the large number of candidates and the cost of
fabricating and testing them. Using the two largest known data sets of
experimental Curie temperatures, we develop machine-learning models to make
rapid $T_\mathrm{C}$ predictions solely based on the chemical composition of a
material. We train a random forest model and a $k$-NN one and predict on an
initial dataset of over 2,500 materials and then validate the model on a new
dataset containing over 3,000 entries. The accuracy is compared for multiple
compounds' representations ("descriptors") and regression approaches. A random
forest model provides the most accurate predictions and is not improved by
dimensionality reduction or by using more complex descriptors based on atomic
properties. A random forest model trained on a combination of both datasets
shows that cobalt-rich and iron-rich materials have the highest Curie
temperatures for all binary and ternary compounds. An analysis of the model
reveals systematic error that causes the model to over-predict
low-$T_\mathrm{C}$ materials and under-predict high-$T_\mathrm{C}$ materials.
For exhaustive searches to find new high-$T_\mathrm{C}$ materials, analysis of
the learning rate suggests either that much more data is needed or that more
efficient descriptors are necessary.

Magnetic multilayers with interlayer exchange coupling have been widely
studied for both static and dynamic regimes. Their dynamical responses depend
on the exchange coupling strength and magnetic properties of individual layers.
Magnetic resonance spectra in such systems are conveniently discussed in terms
of coupling of acoustic and optical modes. At a certain value of applied
magnetic field, the two modes come close to being degenerate and the spectral
gap indicates the strength of mode hybridisation. In this work, we
theoretically and experimentally study the mode hybridisation of
interlayer-exchange-coupled moments with dissimilar magnetisation and thickness
of two ferromagnetic layers. In agreement with symmetry analysis for
eigenmodes, our low-symmetry multilayers exhibit sizable spectral gaps for all
experimental conditions. The spectra agree well with the predictions from the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation at the macrospin limit whose parameters are
independently fixed by static measurements.

Exploring the uncharacterized magnetic phases of Co$^{2+}$ chain compounds is
critical for finding new low-dimensional magnets hosting quantized excitations.
We map the unexplored magnetic phases of the Co$^{2+}$ chain compound
Li$_2$CoCl$_4$. Magnetometry reveals magnetic ordering below 7 K with a
metamagnetic transition near 16.5 kOe and a gradual transition to a
field-aligned paramagnetic state above 31 kOe. Curie-Weiss fits to the high
temperature susceptibility reveal a high-spin (spin-$\frac{3}{2}$) state for
cobalt. Heat capacity data, though, give a magnetic entropy change of 5.46
J/mol, consistent with cobalt effective spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems. To
characterize the zero-field antiferromagnetic ordering, we separately
calculated the energy of proposed magnetic structures with density functional
theory and collected 3.5 K neutron diffraction data, finding that
Li$_2$CoCl$_4$ has ferromagnetic chains with antiferromagnetic interactions
between them. Increasing field rotates these spin chains, producing the
antiferromagnetic to intermediate to paramagnetic transition sequence.

The entanglement asymmetry is a novel quantity that, using entanglement
methods, measures how much a symmetry is broken in a part of an extended
quantum system. So far it has only been used to characterise the breaking of
continuous Abelian symmetries. In this paper, we extend the concept to cyclic
$\mathbb{Z}_N$ groups. As an application, we consider the XY spin chain, in
which the ground state spontaneously breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin parity
symmetry in the ferromagnetic phase. We thoroughly investigate the
non-equilibrium dynamics of this symmetry after a global quantum quench,
generalising known results for the standard order parameter.

The existence of fractionally quantized topological corner states serves as a
key indicator for two-dimensional second-order topological insulators (SOTIs),
yet has not been experimentally observed in realistic materials. Here, based on
first-principles calculations and symmetry arguments, we propose a strategy for
achieving SOTI phases with in-gap corner states in
(MnBi$_2$Te$_4$)(Bi$_2$Te$_3$)$_{m}$ films with antiferromagnetic (AFM) order.
Starting from the prototypical AFM MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer, we show by an
effective lattice model that such SOTI phase originate from the interplay
between intrinsic spin-orbital coupling and interlayer AFM exchange
interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the nontrivial corner states are
linked to rotation topological invariants under three-fold rotation symmetry
$C_3$, resulting in $C_3$-symmetric SOTIs with corner charges fractionally
quantized to $\frac{n}{3} \lvert e \rvert $ (mod $e$). Due to the great recent
achievements in (MnBi$_2$Te$_4$)(Bi$_2$Te$_3$)$_{m}$ systems, our results
providing reliable material candidates for experimentally accessible AFM
higher-order band topology would draw intense attentions.

Using first-principles and model Hamiltonian approach, we explore the
electronic properties of polar-polar LaVO$_3$/KTaO$_3$ (LVO/KTO, 001)
hetero-interfaces of up to six and five layers of KTO and LVO, respectively.
Our calculations suggest the presence of multiple Lifshitz transitions (LT) in
the $t_{2g}$ bands which may show up in high thermal conductivity and Seebeck
coefficient. The LT can be tuned by the number of LaVO$_3$ layers or gate
voltage. The spin-orbit coupling is found to be negligible, coming only from
the Ta $5d_{xy}$-derived band, 5$d_{xz}$ and 5$d_{yz}$ bands being far away
from the Fermi level. The magnetic properties of the interfaces, due to
Vanadium ions, turn out to be intriguing. The magnetic states are highly
sensitive to the number of layers of LaVO$_3$ and KTaO$_3$: the interfaces with
equal number of LVO and KTO layers always favor an antiferromagnetic (AFM)
ordering. Moreover, the combination of even-even and odd-odd layers shows an
AFM order for more than two LaVO$_3$ layers. The spin-polarized density of
states reveals that all the interfaces with ferromagnetic (FM) ground states
are \textit{half-metallic}. The small energy differences between AFM and FM
configurations indicate a possible coexistence of competing AFM and FM ground
states in these interfaces. In addition, the interface requires different
number of LVO layers for it to be metallic: half-metallic FM for three and
above, and metallic AFM for four and above.

The development of high-activity and low-price cathodic catalysts to
facilitate the electrochemical sluggish O$_2$ reduction reaction (ORR) is very
important to achieve the commercial application of fuel cells. Here, we have
investigated the electrocatalytic activity of two-dimensional single-layer
Nb-doped zirconium diselenide (2D Nb-ZrSe$_2$) towards ORR by employing the
dispersion corrected Density Functional Theory (DFT-D) method. Through our
study, we computed structural properties, electronic properties, and energetics
of the 2D Nb-ZrSe$_2$ and ORR intermediates to analyze the electrocatalytic
performance of the 2D Nb-ZrSe$_2$. The electronic properties calculations
depict that the 2D monolayer ZrSe$_2$ has a large band gap of 1.48 eV, which is
not favorable for the ORR mechanism. After the doping of Nb, the electronic
band gap vanishes and 2D Nb-ZrSe$_2$ acts as a conductor. We studied both the
dissociative and associative pathways through which the ORR can proceed to
reduce the oxygen molecule (O$_2$). Our results show that the more favorable
path for O$_2$ reduction on the surface of the 2D Nb-ZrSe$_2$ is the 4e$^-$
associative path. The detailed ORR mechanisms (both associated and
dissociative) have been explored by computing the changes of Gibbs free energy
({\Delta}G). All the ORR reaction intermediate steps are thermodynamically
stable and energetically favorable. The free energy profile for the associative
path shows the downhill behavior of the free energy vs. the reaction steps,
suggesting that all ORR intermediate structures are catalytically active for
the 4e$^-$ associative path and a high 4e$^-$ reduction pathway selectivity.
Therefore, 2D Nb-ZrSe$_2$ is a promising catalyst for the ORR which can be used
as an alternative ORR catalyst compared with expensive platinum (Pt).

<h3>A large deformation theory for coupled swelling and growth with  application to growing tumors and bacterial biofilms</h3>

<br>
<br>
There is significant interest in modelling the mechanics and physics of
growth of soft biological systems such as tumors and bacterial biofilms. Solid
tumors account for more than 85% of cancer mortality and bacterial biofilms
account for a significant part of all human microbial infections.These growing
biological systems are a mixture of fluid and solid components and increase
their mass by intake of diffusing species such as fluids and nutrients
(swelling) and subsequent conversion of some of the diffusing species into
solid material (growth). Experiments indicate that these systems swell by large
amounts and that the swelling and growth are intrinsically coupled. However,
existing theories for swelling coupled growth employ linear poroelasticity,
which is limited to small swelling deformations, and employ phenomenological
prescriptions for the dependence of growth rate on concentration of diffusing
species and the stress-state in the system. In particular, the termination of
growth is enforced through the prescription of a critical concentration of
diffusing species and a homeostatic stress. In contrast, by developing a fully
coupled swelling-growth theory that accounts for large swelling through
nonlinear poroelasticity, we show that the emergent driving stress for growth
automatically captures all the above phenomena. Further, we show that for the
soft growing systems considered here, the effects of the homeostatic stress and
critical concentration can be encapsulated under a single notion of a critical
swelling ratio. The applicability of the theory is shown by its ability to
capture experimental observations of growing tumors and biofilms under various
mechanical and diffusion-consumption constraints. Additionally, compared to
generalized mixture theories, our theory is amenable to relatively easy
numerical implementation with a minimal physically motivated parameter space.

A boson sampler implements a restricted model of quantum computing. It is
defined by the ability to sample from the distribution resulting from the
interference of identical bosons propagating according to programmable,
non-interacting dynamics. Here, we demonstrate a new combination of tools for
implementing boson sampling using ultracold atoms in a two-dimensional,
tunnel-coupled optical lattice. These tools include fast and programmable
preparation of large ensembles of nearly identical bosonic atoms
($99.5^{+0.5}_{-1.6}\;\%$ indistinguishability) by means of rearrangement with
optical tweezers and high-fidelity optical cooling, propagation for variable
evolution time in the lattice with low loss ($5.0(2)\;\%$, independent of
evolution time), and high fidelity detection of the atom positions after their
evolution (typically $99.8(1)\;\%$). With this system, we study specific
instances of boson sampling involving up to $180$ atoms distributed among $\sim
1000$ sites in the lattice. Direct verification of a given boson sampling
distribution is not feasible in this regime. Instead, we introduce and perform
targeted tests to determine the indistinguishability of the prepared atoms, to
characterize the applied family of single particle unitaries, and to observe
expected bunching features due to interference for a large range of atom
numbers. When extended to interacting systems, our work demonstrates the core
capabilities required to directly assemble ground and excited states in
simulations of various Hubbard models.
