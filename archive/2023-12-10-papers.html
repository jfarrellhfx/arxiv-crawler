<h3>Electron Magneto-Hydrodynamics in Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04896" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04896</a>

<i>Jack N. Engdahl, Aydın Cem Keser, Thomas Schmidt, Oleg P. Sushkov</i>
<p>We consider the hydrodynamic flow of an electron fluid in a channel formed in
a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with no-slip boundary conditions. To
generate vorticity in the fluid the flow is influenced by an array of
micromagnets on the top of 2DEG. We analyse the viscous boundary layer and
demonstrate anti-Poiseuille behaviour in this region. Furthermore we predict a
longitudinal Hall effect, where a periodic magnetic field generates a voltage
modulation in the direction of transport. From the experimental point of view
we propose a method for a precise measurements of the properties of different
electron fluids. The results are applicable to graphene away from the charge
neutrality point and to semiconductors.

<h3>Phonon topology and winding of spectral weight in graphite</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04575" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04575</a>
<br>
<i>N. D. Andriushin, A. S. Sukhanov, A. N. Korshunov, M. S. Pavlovskii, M. C. Rahn, S. E. Nikitin</i>
<p>The topology of electronic and phonon band structures of graphene is well
studied and known to exhibit a Dirac cone at the K point of the Brillouin zone.
Here, we applied inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) along with $\textit{ab
initio}$ calculations to investigate phonon topology in graphite, the 3D
analogue of graphene. We identified a pair of modes that form a very weakly
gapped linear anticrossing at the K point that can be essentially viewed as a
Dirac cone approximant. The IXS intensity in the vicinity of the quasi-Dirac
point reveals a harmonic modulation of the phonon spectral weight above and
below the Dirac energy, which was previously proposed as an experimental
fingerprint of the nontrivial topology. We illustrate how the topological
winding of IXS intensity can be understood in terms of atomic displacements,
and highlight that the intensity winding is not in fact sensitive in telling
quasi- and true Dirac points apart.

<h3>Second- and third-order properties of multidimensional Langevin  equations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04585" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04585</a>
<br>
<i>Yeeren I. Low</i>
<p>Recent work has addressed the problem of inferring Langevin dynamics from
data. In this work, we address the problem of relating terms in the Langevin
equation to statistical properties, such as moments of the probability density
function and of the probability current density, as well as covariance
functions. We first review the case of linear Gaussian dynamics, and then
consider extensions beyond this simple case. We address the question of
quantitative significance of effects. We also analyze underdamped
(second-order) processes, specifically in the limit where dynamics in state
space is almost Markovian.

<h3>Current induced magnetisation in metal without space-inversion symmetry</h3>

<p>Magneto-electric effect, that is an appearance of magnetisation induced by
electric current is allowed by symmetry in metals with crystal structure
without space inversion. The microscopic origin of this effect is spin-orbit
coupling of electrons with a non-centrosymmetric crystal lattice lifting spin
degeneracy of electron energy and mixing spin and orbital degrees of freedom.
The presented calculation of magnetisation induced by current based on the
application of kinetic equation for the matrix distribution function of
electrons occupying the states in two bands split by the spin-orbit
interaction.

<h3>Haldane Bundles: A Dataset for Learning to Predict the Chern Number of  Line Bundles on the Torus</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04600" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04600</a>
<br>
<i>Cody Tipton, Elizabeth Coda, Davis Brown, Alyson Bittner, Jung Lee, Grayson Jorgenson, Tegan Emerson, Henry Kvinge</i>
<p>Characteristic classes, which are abstract topological invariants associated
with vector bundles, have become an important notion in modern physics with
surprising real-world consequences. As a representative example, the incredible
properties of topological insulators, which are insulators in their bulk but
conductors on their surface, can be completely characterized by a specific
characteristic class associated with their electronic band structure, the first
Chern class. Given their importance to next generation computing and the
computational challenge of calculating them using first-principles approaches,
there is a need to develop machine learning approaches to predict the
characteristic classes associated with a material system. To aid in this
program we introduce the {\emph{Haldane bundle dataset}}, which consists of
synthetically generated complex line bundles on the $2$-torus. We envision this
dataset, which is not as challenging as noisy and sparsely measured real-world
datasets but (as we show) still difficult for off-the-shelf architectures, to
be a testing ground for architectures that incorporate the rich topological and
geometric priors underlying characteristic classes.

<h3>A holographic view of topological stabilizer codes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04617" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04617</a>
<br>
<i>Thomas Schuster, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Ashvin Vishwanath, Norman Y. Yao</i>
<p>The bulk-boundary correspondence is a hallmark feature of topological phases
of matter. Nonetheless, our understanding of the correspondence remains
incomplete for phases with intrinsic topological order, and is nearly entirely
lacking for more exotic phases, such as fractons. Intriguingly, for the former,
recent work suggests that bulk topological order manifests in a non-local
structure in the boundary Hilbert space; however, a concrete understanding of
how and where this perspective applies remains limited. Here, we provide an
explicit and general framework for understanding the bulk-boundary
correspondence in Pauli topological stabilizer codes. We show -- for any
boundary termination of any two-dimensional topological stabilizer code -- that
the boundary Hilbert space cannot be realized via local degrees of freedom, in
a manner precisely determined by the anyon data of the bulk topological order.
We provide a simple method to compute this "obstruction" using a well-known
mapping to polynomials over finite fields. Leveraging this mapping, we
generalize our framework to fracton models in three-dimensions, including both
the X-Cube model and Haah's code. An important consequence of our results is
that the boundaries of topological phases can exhibit emergent symmetries that
are impossible to otherwise achieve without an unrealistic degree of fine
tuning. For instance, we show how linear and fractal subsystem symmetries
naturally arise at the boundaries of fracton phases.

<h3>Simultaneous Quantum Information Transfer and Quantum Operations in  Quantum Dot Arrays Mediated by Spin-Orbit Interaction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04631" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04631</a>
<br>
<i>D. Fernández-Fernández, Yue Ban, Gloria Platero</i>
<p>Quantum information transfer is fundamental for scalable quantum computing in
any potential platform and architecture. Hole spin qubits, owing to their
intrinsic spin-orbit interaction (SOI), promise fast quantum operations which
are fundamental for the implementation of quantum gates. Yet, the influence of
SOI in quantum transfer protocols remains an open question. Here, we
investigate, using Shortcuts to Adiabaticity, the long-range transfer of hole
spin states and quantum distribution of entangled pairs in a semiconductor
quantum dot array. We demonstrate that electric field manipulation allows
dynamical control of the SOI, enabling simultaneous implementation of quantum
gates during the transfer, with the potential to significantly accelerate
quantum algorithms. By harnessing the ability to perform quantum gates in
parallel with the transfer, we employ dynamical decoupling schemes to focus and
preserve the spin state, leading to higher transfer fidelity.

<h3>Decoherence through Ancilla Anyon Reservoirs</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04638" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04638</a>
<br>
<i>Nayan Myerson-Jain, Taylor L. Hughes, Cenke Xu</i>
<p>We explore the decoherence of the gapless/critical boundary of a topological
order, through interactions with the bulk reservoir of "ancilla anyons." We
take the critical boundary of the $2d$ toric code as an example. The intrinsic
nonlocal nature of the anyons demands the strong and weak symmetry condition
for the ordinary decoherence problem be extended to the strong or weak gauge
invariance conditions. We demonstrate that in the $\textit{doubled}$ Hilbert
space, the partition function of the boundary is mapped to two layers of the
$2d$ critical Ising model with an inter-layer line defect that depends on the
species of the anyons causing the decoherence. The line defects associated with
the tunneling of bosonic $e$ and $m$ anyons are relevant, and result in
long-range correlations for either the $e$ or $m$ anyon respectively on the
boundary in the doubled Hilbert space. In contrast, the defect of the $f$ anyon
is marginal and leads to a line of fixed points with varying effective central
charges, and power-law correlations having continuously varying scaling
dimensions. We also demonstrate that decoherence-analogues of Majorana zero
modes are localized at the spatial interface of the relevant $e$ and $m$ anyon
decoherence channels, which leads to a universal logarithmic scaling of the
R\'enyi entropy of the boundary.

<h3>Field-free Josephson diode with controllable efficiency using magnetic  tunnel barrier</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04650" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04650</a>
<br>
<i>Pramod K. Sharma, Sagnik Banerjee, Biswajit Dutta, Vansh Singhal, Pushpak Banerjee, Hridis K. Pal, Avradeep Pal</i>
<p>Josephson diodes (JDs) offer a promising route towards realizing
dissipation-less rectification at low temperatures. To be practically viable, a
JD must operate at zero magnetic fields, exhibit high operating frequencies and
efficiency, and possess tunability and scalability. In this study, we propose
and experimentally demonstrate a straightforward mechanism that encompasses all
these crucial features. Our approach involves utilizing an asymmetric Josephson
junction with a magnetic weak link to attain a diode effect in the switching
current. We substantiate this concept experimentally through the fabrication of
mesa-type sputter-deposited tri-layered ferromagnetic long NbN/GdN/NbN
Josephson junctions (JJs) in cross geometry. A robust zero-field diode effect
is observed with an efficiency boost of up to 40% achievable through
modification of the micromagnetic structure of the barrier. Notably, these
diodes maintain high efficiency across a wide temperature range, from the
lowest temperatures up to at least 4.2K, and exhibit an operating frequency of
nearly 28GHz.

<h3>Why neural functionals suit statistical mechanics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04681" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04681</a>
<br>
<i>Florian Sammüller, Sophie Hermann, Matthias Schmidt</i>
<p>We describe recent progress in the statistical mechanical description of
many-body systems via machine learning combined with concepts from density
functional theory and many-body simulations. We argue that the neural
functional theory by Samm\"uller et al. [Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 120, e2312484120
(2023)] gives a functional representation of direct correlations and of
thermodynamics that allows for thorough quality control and consistency
checking of the involved methods of artificial intelligence. Addressing a
prototypical system we here present a pedagogical application to hard core
particle in one spatial dimension, where Percus' exact solution for the free
energy functional provides an unambiguous reference. A corresponding standalone
numerical tutorial that demonstrates the neural functional concepts together
with the underlying fundamentals of Monte Carlo simulations, classical density
functional theory, machine learning, and differential programming is available

<h3>Influence of Gamma-X mixing on optical orientation and alignment of  excitons in (In,Al)As/AlAs quantum dots</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04683" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04683</a>
<br>
<i>S. V. Nekrasov, N. O. Mikhailenko, M. D. Ragoza, T. S. Shamirzaev, Yu. G. Kusrayev</i>
<p>The effect of Gamma-X mixing on the energy levels fine structure of indirect
in k-space excitons in an ensemble of (In,Al)As/AlAs quantum dots with type I
band alignment was experimentally studied. Using the methods of optical spin
orientation and optical alignment in a magnetic field, an increase in the
anisotropic exchange splitting of excitonic levels (from approximately 0.6 to 5
ueV) due to the Gamma-X mixing was revealed. The extent of direct electronic
states admixing to indirect ones depends on the size of the quantum dot. On the
other hand, the optical and spin properties of excitons change radically with
increasing of the Gamma states admixture to the X states: in the absence of a
magnetic field, the optical orientation of excitons decreases from 18 to 3%,
while the alignment of excitons is restored from 6 to 53%.

<h3>Integrated Design of Aluminum-Containing High-entropy Refractory B2  Alloys with Synergy of High Strength and Ductility</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04708" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04708</a>
<br>
<i>Jie Qi, Xuesong Fan, Diego Ibarra Hoyos, Michael Widom, Peter K. Liaw, Joseph Poon</i>
<p>Refractory high-entropy alloys, RHEAs, are promising high-temperature
structural materials. Their large compositional space poses great design
challenges for phase control and high strength-ductility synergy. The present
research pioneers using integrated high-throughput machine learning with Monte
Carlo simulations to effectively navigate phase-selection and
mechanical-properties predictions, developing aluminum-containing RHEAs in
single-phase ordered B2 alloys demonstrating both high strength and ductility.
These aluminum-containing RHEAs achieve remarkable mechanical properties,
including compressive yield strengths up to 1.6 GPa, fracture strains exceeding
50 percent, and significant high-temperature strength retention. They also
demonstrate a tensile yield strength of 1.1 GPa with a tension ductility of 6.3
percent. Besides, we identify a valence-electron-count domain for alloy
brittleness with the explanation from density-functional theory and provide
crucial insights into elements' influence on atomic ordering and mechanical
performance. The work sets forth a strategic blueprint for high-throughput
alloy design and reveals fundamental principles that govern the mechanical
properties of advanced structural alloys.

<h3>Optimal Routes to Ultrafast Polarization Reversal in Ferroelectric  LiNbO3</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04732" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04732</a>
<br>
<i>R. Tanner Hardy, Conrad Rosenbrock, Gus Hart, Jeremy A. Johnson</i>
<p>We use the frozen phonon method to calculate the anharmonic potential energy
surface and to model the ultrafast ferroelectric polarization reversal in
LiNbO3 driven by intense pulses of THz light. Before stable switching of the
polarization occurs, there exists a region of excitation field-strengths where
transient switching can occur, as observed experimentally [Physical Review
Letters 118, 197601 (2017)]. By varying the excitation frequency from 4 to 20
THz, our modeling suggests that more efficient, permanent polarization
switching can occur by directly exciting the soft mode at 7 THz, compared to
nonlinear phononic-induced switching driven by exciting a high frequency mode
at 18 THz. We also show that neglecting anharmonic coupling pathways in the
modeled experiment can lead to significant differences in the modeled switching
field strengths.

<h3>Cryogenic platform to investigate strong microwave cavity-spin coupling  in correlated magnetic materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04750" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04750</a>
<br>
<i>Aulden K. Jones, Martin Mourigal, Michael P. Lilly</i>
<p>We present an experimental demonstration of loop-gap resonators (LGRs) for
continuous-wave electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy at cryogenic
temperatures and to investigate the hybridization of solid-state magnetic
materials with microwave cavity modes. The simple experimental setup,
implemented in a conventional cryogenic platform for materials research, allows
to obtain ESR spectra to temperatures as low as 2 K. The versatility of this
approach is demonstrated through experiments on two transition-metal-based
Heisenberg antiferromagnets, CuSO$_4$5H$_2$O and MgCr$_2$O$_4$, showcasing
simple measurements of their gyromagnetic factor and magnetic susceptibilities.
Our work also demonstrates the realization of strong microwave cavity-spin
coupling in CuSO$_4$5H$_2$O and delves into the challenges of fitting ESR
spectra under strong hybridization conditions, underscoring the significance of
proper calibration and stabilization.

<h3>Analytical model and dynamical phase-field simulation of terahertz  transmission across ferroelectrics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04824" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04824</a>
<br>
<i>Taorui Chen, Bo Wang, Yujie Zhu, Shihao Zhuang, Long-Qing Chen, Jia-Mian Hu</i>
<p>We theoretically investigate the steady-state transmission of continuous
terahertz (THz) wave across a freestanding ferroelectric slab. Based on the
Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory of ferroelectrics and the coupled equations
of motion for polarization and electromagnetic (EM) waves, we derive the
analytical expressions of the frequency- and thickness-dependent dielectric
susceptibility and transmission coefficient at the thin slab limit in the
harmonic excitation regime. When the slab thickness is much smaller than the
THz wavelength in the ferroelectric, the analytical predictions agree well with
the numerical simulations from a dynamical phase-field model that incorporates
the coupled dynamics of strain, polarization, and EM wave in multiphase
systems. At larger thicknesses, the transmission is mainly determined by the
frequency-dependent attenuation of THz waves in the ferroelectric and the
formation of a standing polarization/THz wave. Our results advance the
understanding of the interaction between THz wave and ferroelectrics and
suggest the potential of exploiting ferroelectrics to achieve
low-heat-dissipation, nonvolatile voltage modulation of THz transmission for
high-data-rate wireless communication.

<h3>Theory of Non-equilibrium Asymptotic State Thermodynamics: Interacting  Ehrenfest Urn Ring as an Example</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04826" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04826</a>
<br>
<i>Chi-Ho Cheng, Pik-Yin Lai</i>
<p>A generalized class of non-equilibrium state, called non-equilibrium
asymptotic state (NEAS), is proposed. The NEAS is constructed within the
framework of the Fokker-Planck equations in thermodynamic limit. Besides the
usual equilibrium state and non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), the class of
NEAS could also cover non-equilibrium periodic state (NEPS) in which its
dynamics shows periodicity, non-equilibrium quasi-periodic state (NEQPS), and
non-equilibrium chaotic state (NECS) in which its dynamics becomes chaotic.
Based on the theory of NEAS thermodynamics, the corresponding thermodynamics of
different NEAS could also be determined. Finally the interacting Ehrenfest urn
ring model is used as an example to illustrate how different kinds of NEAS
(equilibrium state, uniform NESS, non-uniform NESS, NEPS) in three-urn case are
identified in our framework. In particular, the thermodynamics of NEPS and its
phase transitions to other types of NEAS are studied.

<h3>Field-induced phase transitions and anisotropic magnetic properties of  the Kiteav-Heisenberg compound Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$</h3>

<br>
<i>A. K. Bera, S. M. Yusuf, F. Orlandi, P. Manuel, L. Bhaskaran, S. A. Zvyagin</i>
<p>Spin systems with honeycomb structures have recently attracted a great deal
of attention in connection with the Kitaev quantum spin liquid state (QSL)
predicted theoretically. One possible Kitaev QSL candidate is
Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ realizing a honeycomb lattice of pseudo-spin-1/2.
Field-dependent single-crystal neutron diffraction technique allows us to
determine the microscopic spin-spin correlations across the field induced phase
transitions for H//a and H//a* in plane field directions. Our results reveal
phase transitions, initially to a canted zigzag antiferromagnetic state at
approximately 60 kOe, followed by a possible transition to a partially
polarized state over the range of 90-120 kOe, and finally to a field-induced
fully polarized state above 120 kOe. We observe distinct field dependencies of
the magnetic peak intensities for H//a and H//a*. In addition, low-temperature
electron spin resonance in magnetic fields H//c yields a complete softening for
one of the antiferromagnetic resonances at ~ 40 kOe, revealing a field-induced
phase transition. The present work, thus, provides new insights into the field
evolution of the important Kitaev-Heisenberg spin system Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$.

<p>Advanced microelectronics in the future may require semiconducting channel
materials beyond silicon. Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, characterized by
their atomically thin thickness, hold immense promise for high-performance
electronic devices at the nanometer scale with lower heat dissipation. One
challenge for achieving high-performance 2D semiconductor field effect
transistors (FET), especially for p-type materials, is the high electrical
contact resistance present at the metal-semiconductor interface. In
conventional bulk semiconductors, low resistance ohmic contact is realized
through heavy substitutional doping with acceptor or donor impurities at the
contact region. The strategy of substitutional doping, however, does not work
for p-type 2D semiconductors such as monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$).In
this study, we developed highly efficient charge-transfer doping with
WSe$_2$/$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ heterostructures to achieve low-resistance ohmic
contact for p-type WSe$_2$ transistors. We show that a hole doping as high as
3$\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ can be achieved in the WSe$_2/\alpha$-RuCl$_3$
heterostructure due to its type-III band alignment. It results in an Ohmic
contact with resistance lower than 4 k Ohm $\mu$m at the p-type monolayer
WSe$_2$/metal junction. at room temperature. Using this low-resistance contact,
we demonstrate high-performance p-type WSe$_2$ transistors with a saturation
current of 35 $\mu$A$\cdot$ $\mu$m$^{-1}$ and an I$_{ON}$/I$_{OFF}$ ratio
exceeding 10$^9$ It could enable future microelectronic devices based on 2D
semiconductors and contribute to the extension of Moore's law.

<h3>Enhancement of Goos-Hänchen shifts in graphene through Fizeau drag  effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04850" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04850</a>
<br>
<i>Rafi Ud Din, Muzamil Shah, Reza Asgari, Gao Xianlong</i>
<p>We investigate the Goos-H\"{a}nchen shifts in reflection for a light beam
within a graphene structure, utilizing the Fizeau drag effect induced by its
massless Dirac electrons in incident light. The magnitudes of spatial and
angular shifts for a light beam propagating against the direction of drifting
electrons are significantly enhanced, while shifts for a beam co-propagating
with the drifting electrons are suppressed. The Goos-H\"{a}nchen shifts exhibit
augmentation with increasing drift velocities of electrons in graphene. The
impact of incident wavelength on the angular and spatial shifts in reflection
is discussed. Furthermore, the study highlights the crucial roles of the
density of charged particles in graphene, the particle relaxation time, and the
thickness of the graphene in manipulating the drag-affected Goos-H\"{a}nchen
shifts. This investigation offers valuable insights for efficiently guiding
light in graphene structures under the influence of the Fizeau drag effect.

<h3>The Formal Theory of Green's Function in non-Hermitian Systems</h3>

<p>In this paper, we employ the generalized Bloch theory to rediscover the
generalized Brillouin zone theory and follow this way to obtain Green's
function of the non-Hermitian system. We focus on a classical chiral model and
give the exact expression of the Green function for a finite-size system and
the formal expression of the Green function suitable for infinite size. Based
on these results, we further derive the correlation matrix and validate it
numerically against direct calculations for a system of size 40. The numerical
results show the accuracy of our exact expression and the high fidelity of our
formal expression.

<h3>Floquet engineering of many-body states by the Ponderomotive potential</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04892" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04892</a>
<br>
<i>Zhiyuan Sun</i>
<p>The Ponderomotive force is a static second order force that a particle feels
in an oscillating field, whose static potential may be called the Ponderomotive
potential. We generalize this notion to that for generic degrees of freedom in
periodically driven quantum many-body systems, and propose it as a convenient
tool to engineer the non-equilibrium steady states beyond the single particle
level. Applied to materials driven by light, the Ponderomotive potential is
intimately related to the optical conductivity, which is enhanced close to
resonances. We show that the Ponderomotive potential from the incident light
may be used to induce exciton condensates in semiconductors, to generate
attractive interactions leading to superconductivity in certain electron-phonon
systems, and to create additional free energy minima in systems with
charge/spin/excitonic orders. These effects are shown for realistic parameters
such that they can be readily verified in ultrafast experiments.

<h3>Coordination Engineering in Zirconium-Nitrogen-Functionalized Materials  for N2 Reduction: A First-Principles Simulation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04894" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04894</a>
<br>
<i>Jianpeng Guo, Hao Luo, Qinfu Zhao, Bingbing Suo, Bo Zhou, Haiyan Zhu, Zhiyong Zhang, Qi Song</i>
<p>Coordination engineering was employed to optimize the coordination
environment of the Zr atom anchored on the porphyrins (PP). Five promising
ZrPP-A candidates as electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR)
were identified through a four-step screening strategy. First-principles
calculations were utilized to evaluate the performance of the candidate
electrocatalysts for NRR. A comprehensive search for reaction pathways revealed
that NRR reactions with these selected catalysts tend to follow a hybrid
pathway. It is found that orbital hybridization and charge transfer between Zr
and its coordination atoms, as well as between ZrPP-A and the adsorbed N2
ensured the stability and high catalytic activity of these selected ZrPP-A. Zr
plays a crucial role in coordinating charge transfer during the NRR process.
Simultaneously, the coordinating atoms and the PP moiety jointly provide
additional charge transfers to or from the adsorbate. An asymmetric
coordination environment results in an asymmetric charge distribution of the
substrate, causing the adsorbed polarized N2 molecule oriented toward the
asymmetric charge aggregation region. Our work underscores the importance of
considering not only the single-atom catalyst itself but also its coordination

<p>Ultrafast optical excitations allow creating new metastable and hidden states
in quantum materials. However, the fundamental material properties required to
support new emergent order are largely unknown. Here we show for two colossal
magnetoresistive (CMR) manganites that electronic phase separation (EPS)
strongly favors non-thermal behavior and exploit this to stabilize an
optically-induced conducting state. Our results shed light on the role of EPS
in optical control of CMR manganites and provide guidance for the design of
materials that can exhibit non-equilibrium states of matter.

<p>The study of open-shell nanographenes has relied on a paradigm where spins
are the only low-energy degrees of freedom. Here we show that some
nanographenes can host low-energy excitations that include strongly coupled
spin and orbital degrees of freedom. The key ingredient is the existence of
orbital degeneracy, as a consequence of leaving the benzenoid/half-filling
scenario. We analyze the case of nitrogen-doped triangulenes, using both
density-functional theory and Hubbard model multiconfigurational and
random-phase approximation calculations. We find a rich interplay between
orbital and spin degrees of freedom that confirms the need to go beyond the
spin-only paradigm, opening a new venue in this field of research.

<h3>Dirac plasmon polaritons and magnetic modes in topological-insulator  nanoparticles</h3>

<br>
<i>Nikolaos Kyvelos, Vassilios Yannopapas, N. Asger Mortensen, Christos Tserkezis</i>
<p>We report the existence of previously unreported magnetic modes with
record-high magnetic Purcell factors in topological-insulator nanospheres.
Focusing on Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$, and based on full electromagnetic Mie theory, we
find magnetic modes arising from the surface current on the conductive surface
of the topological insulator due to the existence of delocalized surface
states. These currents are induced by electrons in the topologically protected
states within the Dirac cone. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Dirac
plasmon polaritons resulting from the interaction between THz photons and Dirac
electrons dramatically influence both the electric and the magnetic transitions
of quantum emitters placed near Bi$_2$Se$_3$ nanospheres, providing
significantly enhanced Purcell factors and entering the strong-coupling regime.
These findings indicate that Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ nanospheres exhibit a rich
optical response, stemming from both bulk and topologically protected surface
states, making them promising candidates for enhancing strong light--matter
interactions in the fields of nanophotonics and THz technologies.

<h3>Toward Modeling the Structure of Electrolytes at Charged Mineral  Interfaces using Classical Density Functional Theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04976" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04976</a>
<br>
<i>Thomas Petersen</i>
<p>The organization of water molecules and ions between charged mineral surfaces
determines the stability of colloidal suspensions and the strength of
phase-separated particulate gels. In this article we assemble a density
functional that measures the free energy due to the interaction of water
molecules and ions near electric double layers. The model accounts for the
finite size of the particles using fundamental measure theory, hydrogen-bonding
between water molecules using Wertheim's statistical association theory,
long-range dispersion interactions using Barker and Henderson's high
temperature expansion, electrostatic correlations using a functionalized
mean-spherical approximation, and Coulomb forces through the Poisson equation.
These contributions are shown to produce highly correlated structures, aptly
rendering the layering of counter-ions and co-ions at highly charged surfaces,
and permitting the solvation of ions and surfaces to be measured by a
combination of short-ranged association and long-ranged attraction. The model
is tested in a planar geometry near soft, charged surfaces to reproduce the
structure of water near graphene and mica. For mica surfaces, explicitly
representing the density of the outer oxygen layer of the exposed silica
tetrahedra in the domain permits water molecules to hydrogen-bind to the
surface. When electrostatic interactions are included, water molecules assume a
hybrid character, being accounted for implicitly in the dielectric constant but
explicitly otherwise. The disjoining pressure between approaching like-charged
surfaces is calculated, demonstrating the model's ability to probe pressure
oscillations that arise during the expulsion of ions and water layers from the
interfacial gap, and predict the strong inter-attractive stresses that form at
narrow interfacial spacing when the surface charge is overscreened.

<h3>Phase Shift in AC Magnetocaloric Effect Measurements as an Indicator of  the Order of Magnetic Phase Transitions</h3>

<br>
<i>Akhmed M. Aliev, Adler G. Gamzatov, Zaur Z. Alisultanov</i>
<p>It is shown that the phase shift between an applied weak alternating magnetic
field and the magnetocaloric response signal of the magnetic material is
drastically sensitive to the order of phase transition. Namely, at the
second-order phase transition, the phase shift does not depend on the magnetic
field magnitude, while in the first-order phase transition this one depends
significantly on the field strength. We have shown that this effect follows
from the general critical dynamics theory.

<h3>Gas-to-soliton transition of attractive bosons on a spherical surface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04984" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04984</a>
<br>
<i>A. Tononi, G. Astrakharchik, D. S. Petrov</i>
<p>We investigate the ground state properties of $N$ bosons with attractive
zero-range interactions characterized by the scattering length $a>0$ and
confined to the surface of a sphere of radius $R$. We present the analytic
solution of the problem for $N=2$, mean-field analysis for $N\rightarrow
\infty$, and exact diffusion Monte-Carlo results for intermediate $N$. For
finite $N$ we observe a smooth crossover from the uniform state in the limit
$a/R\gg 1$ (weak attraction) to a localized state at small $a/R$ (strong
attraction). With increasing $N$ this crossover narrows down to a discontinuous
transition from the uniform state to a soliton of size $\sim R/\sqrt{N}$. The
two states are separated by an energy barrier, tunneling under which is
exponentially suppressed at large $N$. The system behavior is marked by a
peculiar competition between space-curvature effects and beyond-mean-field
terms, both breaking the scaling invariance of a two-dimensional mean-field
theory.

<h3>Quasiparticles-mediated thermal diode effect in Weyl Josephson junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05008" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05008</a>
<br>
<i>Pritam Chatterjee, Paramita Dutta</i>
<p>We theoretically show quasiparticles-driven thermal diode effect (TDE) in an
inversion symmetry-broken (ISB) Weyl superconductor (WSC)-Weyl semimetal
(WSM)-WSC Josephson junction. A Zeeman field perpendicular to the WSM region of
the thermally-biased Weyl Josephson junction (WJJ) induces an asymmetry between
the forward and reverse thermal currents, which is responsible for the TDE.
Most interestingly, we show that the sign and magnitude of the thermal diode
rectification coefficient is highly tunable by the superconducting phase
difference and external Zeeman field, and also strongly depends on the junction
length. The tunability of the rectification, particularly, the sign changing
behavior associated with higher rectification enhances the potential of our WJJ
thermal diode to use as functional switching components in thermal devices.

<h3>Emergent Antiferromagnetic Behavior in EuCl$_3$ Monolayer: A  Comprehensive First-Principles Study Including Hubbard-SOC Interplay</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05018" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05018</a>
<br>
<i>Nurcan Kutluk Kalkan, Ilkay Ozdemir, Yusuf Yuksel, Umit Akinci, Johannes V. Barth, Ethem Aktürk</i>
<p>We present a comprehensive study on the electronic and magnetic properties of
the EuCl$_3$ monolayer using first-principles calculations. By taking into
account the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the Hubbard effects, we elucidate the
influence of these interactions on the structural properties of EuCl$_3$
monolayer. Comparing the lattice parameters obtained with the PBE+SOC and
PBE+SOC+Hubbard effects reveals an increase in the lattice parameters when
including the Hubbard effect. In the absence of the Hubbard interaction, the
magnetic ground state of the EuCl$_3$ monolayer exhibits a preference for a
ferromagnetic (FM) configuration as determined by the PBE+SOC calculations.
However, the introduction of the Hubbard parameter leads to a shift in the
magnetic ground state preference towards an antiferromagnetic (AFM) N\'{e}el
state. Based on the calculated energy values, Monte Carlo simulations are
carried out to determine the N\'{e}el temperature $(T_N)$. Our simulations
yield a N\'{e}el temperature of \SI{390}{\kelvin} for the EuCl$_3$ monolayer,
indicating the temperature at which the transition from a paramagnetic phase to
an antiferromagnetic phase occurs. These results highlight the importance of
incorporating the SOC and the Hubbard effect in accurately describing the
electronic and magnetic properties of the EuCl$_3$ monolayer. Our results
contribute to a deeper understanding of the fundamental physics underlying the
behavior of this intriguing two-dimensional material and provide insights into
its potential applications in spintronics and magnetic devices.

<h3>Proximity-induced nonlinear magnetoresistances on topological insulators</h3>

<br>
<i>M. Mehraeen, Steven S.-L. Zhang</i>
<p>We employ quadratic-response Kubo formulas to investigate the nonlinear
magnetotransport in bilayers composed of a topological insulator and a magnetic
insulator, and predict both unidirectional magnetoresistance and nonlinear
planar Hall effects driven by interfacial disorder and spin-orbit scattering.
These effects exhibit strong dependencies on the Fermi energy relative to the
strength of the exchange interaction between the spins of Dirac electrons and
the interfacial magnetization. In particular, as the Fermi energy becomes
comparable to the exchange energy, the nonlinear magnetotransport coefficients
can be greatly amplified and their dependencies on the magnetization
orientation deviate significantly from conventional sinusoidal behavior. These
findings may not only deepen our understanding of the origin of nonlinear
magnetotransport in magnetic topological systems but also open new pathways to
probe the Fermi and exchange energies via transport measurements.

<i>Bo Fan, Ellák Somfai, Ralf Stannarius, Tamás Börzsönyi</i>
<p>Shear induced orientational ordering of asymmetric elongated particles is
investigated experimentally. Corn grains and pegs with one end sharpened are
studied using X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) during quasistatic shearing and
silo discharge. We show that asymmetries can be detected in the orientational
distributions of the particles, which are related to the modulated rotation of
the particles during shear flow. Namely, when the particles rotate in a plane
that is not horizontal, they spend more time with the sharper (lighter) end
pointing up, which can be explained using energetic arguments. We quantify the
resulting asymmetry of the orientational distribution in a split bottom Couette
cell and in a silo discharge process.

<h3>Electron-hole collision-limited resistance of gapped graphene</h3>

<br>
<i>Arseny Gribachov, Vladimir Vyurkov, Dmitry Svintsov</i>
<p>Collisions between electrons and holes can dominate the carrier scattering in
clean graphene samples in the vicinity of charge neutrality point. While
electron-hole limited resistance in pristine gapless graphene is well-studied,
its evolution with induction of band gap $E_g$ is less explored. Here, we
derive the functional dependence of electron-hole limited resistance of gapped
graphene $\rho_{eh}$ on the ratio of gap and thermal energy $E_g/kT$. At low
temperatures and large band gaps, the resistance grows linearly with $E_g/kT$,
and possesses a minimum at $E_g \approx 2.5 kT$. This contrast to the Arrhenius
activation-type behaviour for intrinsic semiconductors. Introduction of
impurities restores the Arrhenius law for resistivity at low temperatures
and/or high doping densities. The hallmark of electron-hole collision effects
in graphene resistivity at charge neutrality is the crossover between
exponential and power-law resistivity scalings with temperature.

<h3>Spiralling molecular structures and chiral selectivity in model  membranes</h3>

<br>
<i>Alexander P. Fellows, Ben John, Martin Wolf, Martin Thämer</i>
<p>Since the lipid raft model was developed at the end of the last century, it
became clear that the specific molecular arrangements of phospholipid
assemblies within a membrane have profound implications in a vast range of
physiological functions. Studies of such condensed lipid islands in model
systems using fluorescence and Brewster angle microscopies have shown a wide
range of sizes and morphologies, with suggestions of substantial in-plane
molecular anisotropy and mesoscopic structural chirality. Whilst these
variations can significantly alter many membrane properties including its
fluidity, permeability, and molecular recognition, the details of the in-plane
molecular orientations underlying these traits remain largely unknown. Here, we
use phase-resolved sum-frequency generation microscopy on model membranes of
phospholipid monolayers with mixed molecular chirality, which form micron-scale
circular domains of condensed lipids, to fully determine their
three-dimensional molecular structure. We find that the domains possess curved
molecular directionality with spiralling mesoscopic packing. By comparing
different enantiomeric mixtures, both the molecular and spiral turning
directions are shown to depend on the lipid chirality, but with a clear
deviation from mirror symmetry in the formed structures. This demonstrates
strong enantioselectivity in the domain growth process, which has potential
connections to the evolution of homochirality in all living organisms as well
as implications for enantioselective drug design.

<h3>Scaling of Hybrid QDs-Graphene Photodetectors to Subwavelength Dimension</h3>

<i>Gökhan Kara, Patrik Rohner, Erfu Wu, Dmitry N. Dirin, Roman Furrer, Dimos Poulikakos, Maksym V. Kovalenko, Michel Calame, Ivan Shorubalko</i>
<p>Emerging colloidal quantum dot (cQD) photodetectors currently challenge
established state-of-the-art infrared photodetectors in response speed,
spectral tunability, simplicity of solution processable fabrication, and
integration onto curved or flexible substrates. Hybrid phototransistors based
on 2D materials and cQDs, in particular, are promising due to their inherent
photogain enabling direct photosignal enhancement. The photogain is sensitive
to both, measurement conditions and photodetector geometry. This makes the
cross-comparison of devices reported in the literature rather involved. Here,
the effect of device length L and width W scaling to subwavelength dimensions
(sizes down to 500 nm) on the photoresponse of graphene-PbS cQD
phototransistors was experimentally investigated. Photogain and responsivity
were found to scale with 1/LW, whereas the photocurrent and specific
detectivity were independent of geometrical parameters. The measurements were
performed at scaled bias voltage conditions for comparable currents. Contact
effects were found to limit the photoresponse for devices with L < 3 {\mu}m.
The relation of gate voltage, bias current, light intensity, and frequency on
the photoresponse was investigated in detail, and a photogating efficiency to
assess the cQD-graphene interface is presented. In particular, the specific
detectivity values in the range between 10^8 to 10^9 Jones (wavelength of 1550
nm, frequency 6 Hz, room temperature) were found to be limited by the charge
transfer across the photoactive interface.

<h3>Selective damping of plasmons in coupled two-dimensional systems by  Coulomb drag</h3>

<i>Ilya Safonov, Aleksandr S. Petrov, Dmitry Svintsov</i>
<p>The Coulomb drag is a many-body effect observed in proximized low-dimensional
systems. It appears as emergence of voltage in one of them upon passage of bias
current in another. The magnitude of drag voltage can be strongly affected by
exchange of plasmonic excitations between the layers; however, the reverse
effect of Coulomb drag on properties of plasmons has not been studied. Here, we
study the plasmon spectra and damping in parallel two-dimensional systems in
the presence of Coulomb drag. We find that Coulomb drag leads to selective
damping of one of the two fundamental plasma modes of a coupled bilayer. For
identical electron doping of both layers, the drag suppresses the acoustic
plasma mode; while for symmetric electron-hole doping of the coupled pair, the
drag suppresses the optical plasma mode. The selective damping can be observed
both for propagating modes in extended bilayers and for localized plasmons in
bilayers confined by source and drain contacts. The discussed effect may
provide access to the strength of Coulomb interaction in 2d electron systems
from various optical and microwave scattering experiments.

<h3>Manipulating Topological Properties in Bi$_2$Se$_3$/BiSe/TMDC  Heterostructures with Interface Charge Transfer</h3>

<i>Xuance Jiang, Turgut Yilmaz, Elio Vescovo, Deyu Lu</i>
<p>Heterostructures of topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ on transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDCs) offer a new materials platform for studying novel
quantum states by exploiting the interplay among topological orders, charge
orders and magnetic orders. The diverse interface attributes, such as material
combination, charge re-arrangement, defect and strain, can be utilized to
manipulate the quantum properties of this class of materials. Recent
experiments of Bi$_2$Se$_3$/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures show signatures of strong
Rashba band splitting due to the presence of a BiSe buffer layer, but the
atomic level mechanism is not fully understood. We conduct first-principles
studies of the Bi$_2$Se$_3$/BiSe/TMDC heterostructures with five different TMDC
substrates (1T phase VSe$_2$, MoSe$_2$, TiSe$_2$, and 2H phase NbSe$_2$,
MoSe$_2$). We find significant charge transfer at both BiSe/TMDC and
Bi$_2$Se$_3$/BiSe interfaces driven by the work function difference, which
stabilizes the BiSe layer as an electron donor and creates interface dipole.
The electric field of the interface dipole breaks the inversion symmetry in the
Bi$_2$Se$_3$ layer, leading to the giant Rashba band splitting in two quintuple
layers and the recovery of the Dirac point in three quintuple layers, with the
latter otherwise only occurring in thicker samples with at least six
Bi$_2$Se$_3$ quintuple layers. Besides, we find that strain can significantly
affect the charge transfer at the interfaces. Our study presents a promising
avenue for tuning topological properties in heterostructures of two-dimensional
materials, with potential applications in quantum devices.

<p>In the one-dimensional isothermal case, we introduce a simple model of
nonlinear viscoelasticity within the Rational Extended Thermodynamics (RET)
framework. The differential system is entirely determined by the universal

existence of smooth solutions for appropriately small initial data. In the
linear case, the system reduces to the well-known Maxwell model, thereby
representing a plausible nonlinear extension of the Maxwell-type model.

<br>
<i>Suman Mondal, Fabian Heidrich-Meisner</i>
<p>We study a partially disordered one-dimensional system with interacting
particles. Concretely, we impose a disorder potential to only every other site,
followed by a clean site. The numerical analysis of finite systems reveals that
the ergodic regime with a large entanglement extends to higher disorder
strengths compared to a fully disordered system. More importantly, at large
disorder, there exist eigenstates with large entanglement entropies and
significant correlations between the clean sites. These states have volume-law
scaling, embedded into a sea of area-law states, reminiscent of inverted
quantum-scar states. These eigenstate features leave fingerprints in the
nonequilibrium dynamics even in the large-disorder regime, with a strong
initial-state dependence. We demonstrate that certain types of initial
charge-density-wave states decay significantly, while others preserve their
initial inhomogeneity, the latter being the typical behavior for many-body
localized systems. This initial-condition dependent dynamics may give extra
control over the delocalization dynamics at large disorder strength and should
be experimentally feasible with ultracold atoms in optical lattices.

<p>By determining the superconducting lower and upper critical fields
$H_\mathrm{c1}(T)$ and $H_\mathrm{c2}(T)$, respectively, in a high-purity
spherical Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ sample via ac-susceptibility measurements, we obtain
the temperature dependence of the coherence length $\xi$ and the penetration
depth $\lambda$ down to 0.04$T_c$. Given the high sample quality, the observed
$T^2$ dependence of $\lambda$ at low temperatures cannot be explained in terms
impurity effects. Instead, we argue that the weak type-II superconductor
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ has to be treated in the non-local limit. In that limit, the
penetration depth data agree with a gap structure having vertical line nodes,
while horizontal line nodes cannot account for the observation.

<p>In the unconventional superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, uniaxial stress along the
$[100]$ direction tunes the Fermi level through a Van Hove singularity (VHS) in
the density of states, causing a strong enhancement of the superconducting
critical temperature $T_\textrm{c}$. Here, we report measurements of the London
penetration depth $\lambda$ as this tuning is performed. We find that the
zero-temperature superfluid density, here defined as $\lambda(0)^{-2}$,
increases by $\sim$15%, with a peak that coincides with the peak in
$T_\textrm{c}$. We also find that the low temperature form of $\lambda(T)$ is
quadratic over the entire strain range. Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we
find that the gap increases from $\Delta_0 \approx 350~\mu$eV in unstressed
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ to $\Delta_0 \approx 600~\mu$eV in a sample strained to near the
peak in $T_c$. With a nodal order parameter, an increase in the superconducting
gap could bring about an increase in the superfluid density through reduced
sensitivity to defects and through reduced non-local effects in the Meissner
screening. Our data indicate that tuning to the VHS increases the gap
throughout the Brillouin zone, and that non-local effects are likely more
important than reduced scattering.

<i>Linghan Zhu, Yizhou Wang, Li Yang</i>
<p>Realizing direct-bandgap quantum dots working within the deep-ultraviolet
frequency is highly desired for electro-optical and biomedical applications
while remaining challenging. In this work, we combine the first-principles
many-body perturbation theory and effective Hamiltonian approximation to
propose the realization of arrays of deep-ultraviolet excitonic quantum dots in
twisted bilayer hexagonal boron nitride. The effective quantum confinement of
excitons can reach ~400 meV within small twisting angles, which is about four
times larger than those observed in twisted semiconducting transitional metal
dichalcogenides. Especially because of enhanced electron-hole attraction, those
excitons will accumulate via the so-call exciton funnel effect to the
direct-bandgap regime, giving the possibility to better luminescence
performance and manipulating coherent arrays of deep-ultraviolet quantum dots.

<h3>Force Matching and Iterative Boltzmann Inversion Coarse Grained Force  Fields for ZIF-8</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05192" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05192</a>
<br>
<i>Cecilia M. S. Alvares, Rocio Semino</i>
<p>Despite the intense activity at the electronic and atomistic resolutions,
coarse grained (CG) modeling of MOFs remains largely unexplored. One of the
main reasons for this is the lack of adequate CG force fields. In this work, we
present Iterative Boltzmann Inversion (IBI) and Force Matching (FM) force
fields for modeling ZIF-8 in three different coarse grained resolutions. Their
ability of reproducing structure, elastic tensor and thermal expansion is
evaluated and compared with that of MARTINI force-fields considered in previous
work.[C. M. S. Alvares et al, J. Chem. Phys., 158, 194107 (2023).] Moreover,
MARTINI and FM are evaluated in their ability of depicting the swing effect, a
subtle phase transition ZIF-8 undergoes when loaded with guest molecules.
Overall, we found that all our force fields reproduce structure reasonably
well. Elastic constants and volume expansion results are analyzed and the
technical and conceptual challenges in reproducing them are explained. Force
matching exhibits promising results for capturing the swing effect. This is the
first time these CG methods, widely applied in polymer and biomolecules
communities, are deployed to model porous solids. We highlight the challenges
of fitting CG force fields for these materials. This work opens the door to a
whole new line of developments in the field of modeling MOFs and other porous
crystalline solids.

<i>Joe Marshall, Chris A. Hooley</i>
<p>We revisit the fitting of the Fang-Bernevig-Hu model [Europhys. Lett. 86,
67005 (2009)] to inelastic neutron scattering data carried out by Lipscombe et
al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 057004 (2011)]. We demonstrate that there are many
quite different parameter choices within the experimentally observed phase
(AFM3) that provide approximately equally good fits to the neutron data. We
note that (a) all of these parameter sets lie very close to a point of
transition between the AFM3 phase and one of its neighbors in the classical
phase diagram, and (b) many of them involve rather large values of the
third-neighbor coupling $J_3$. In light of these observations, we discuss
whether the modeling of FeTe may need revision to allow for a slightly non-AFM3
ground state, orbital as well as spin physics on the Fe sites, the effects of
electron itinerancy, or a combination of these.

<p>In-situ Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) is an instrumental technique
that has traditionally been used to understand how the choice of materials
processing has the ability to change local structure and composition. However,
more recent advances to observe and react to transient changes occurring at the
ultrafast timescales that are now possible with EELS and Transmission Electron
Microscopy (TEM) will require new frameworks for characterization and analysis.
We describe a machine learning (ML) framework for the rapid assessment and
characterization of in operando EELS Spectrum Images (EELS-SI) without the need
for many labeled training datapoints as typically required for deep learning
classification methods. By embedding computationally generated structures and
experimental datasets into an equivalent latent space through Variational
Autoencoders (VAE), we effectively predict the structural changes at latency
scales relevant to closed-loop processing within the TEM. The framework
described in this study is a critical step in enabling automated, on-the-fly
synthesis and characterization which will greatly advance capabilities for
materials discovery and precision engineering of functional materials at the
atomic scale.

<p>A series of (1-x)[(2BaO-0,5Na2O)-1P2O5] -xNb2O5 (BNPN, x=0,41, 0,43, 0,45,
0,48) glass-ceramics based on phosphate glasses have been prepared via a
controlled-crystallization route. The structure, dielectric properties,
interfacial polarization, and energy storage properties were systematically
investigated. The x-ray diffraction results showed the simultaneous presence of
Ba2NaNb5O15 tungsten bronze structure (TTB) and the NaNbO3 perovskite. A stable
dielectric constant over a temperature range from 25-200{\deg}C, low dielectric
losses less than 0,03, and excellent frequency stability at room temperature
were obtained. The decrease in niobium content promoted TTB crystallization
with the improvement of the high dielectric properties of the system. The
optimum of the dielectric constant and recoverable energy storage density were
obtained for BNP41 crystallized at 1000{\deg}C. Analyses of the complex
impedance indicated that the niobium content and crystallization temperature
affect the interfacial polarization.

<h3>First-order, continuous, and multicritical Bose-Einstein condensation in  Bose mixtures</h3>

<p>We address the possibility of realizing Bose-Einstein condensation as a
first-order phase transition by admixture of particles of different species. To
this aim we perform a comprehensive analysis of phase diagrams of two-component
mixtures of bosons at finite temperatures. As a prototype model, we analyze a
binary mixture of Bose particles interacting via an infinite-range (Kac-scaled)
two-body potential. We obtain a rich phase diagram, where the transition
between the normal and Bose-Einstein condensed phases may be either continuous
or first-order. The phase diagram hosts lines of triple points, tricritical
points, as well as quadruple points. We address the structure of the phase
diagram depending on the relative magnitudes of the inter- and intra-species
interaction couplings. In addition, even for purely repulsive interactions, we
identify a first-order liquid-gas type transition between non-condensed phases
characterized by different particle concentrations. In the obtained phase
diagram, a surface of such first-order transitions terminates with a line of
critical points.

<h3>Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Nanoporous Tungsten</h3>

<i>Jarod Worden, Celine Hin</i>
<p>Developing materials that can withstand the intense environments of nuclear
fusion reactors is critical in developing long-term commercial viability for
energy production. Tungsten is the primary candidate as a plasma facing
material due to its exceptional resilience in extreme fusion settings. However,
the continuous high energy helium and neutron damage threatens mechanical
stability, calling into question the long time commercial reliability for
fusion energy generation. In order to address these issues, novel methods of
nanoporous structures have been shown to suppress and annihilate the
accumulation of defects that leads to structural instability that can be
applied to improve the reliability of tungsten as a plasma facing material.
There is currently a lack of experimental data on nanoporous Tungsten that
needs to be considered when choosing appropriate applications for this
material. Molecular dynamic simulations were utilized in examining the
mechanical and thermodynamic response of nanoporous tungsten systems under
fusion reactor relevant conditions under compressive strain. Bicontinuous
nanoporous structured Tungsten with small relative densities are shown to have
outstanding thermodynamic and mechanical stability under compression compared
to other Tungsten systems by possessing reduced defect densities and unique
defect twinning.

<h3>Tensorial properties via the neuroevolution potential framework: Fast  simulation of infrared and Raman spectra</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05233" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05233</a>

<i>Nan Xu, Petter Rosander, Christian Schäfer, Eric Lindgren, Nicklas Österbacka, Mandi Fang, Wei Chen, Yi He, Zheyong Fan, Paul Erhart</i>
<p>Infrared and Raman spectroscopy are widely used for the characterization of
gases, liquids, and solids, as the spectra contain a wealth of information
concerning in particular the dynamics of these systems. Atomic scale
simulations can be used to predict such spectra but are often severely limited
due to high computational cost or the need for strong approximations that limit
application range and reliability. Here, we introduce a machine learning (ML)
accelerated approach that addresses these shortcomings and provides a
significant performance boost in terms of data and computational efficiency
compared to earlier ML schemes. To this end, we generalize the neuroevolution
potential approach to enable the prediction of rank one and two tensors to
obtain the tensorial neuroevolution potential (TNEP) scheme. We apply the
resulting framework to construct models for the dipole moment, polarizability,
and susceptibility of molecules, liquids, and solids, and show that our
approach compares favorably with several ML models from the literature with
respect to accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate the
application of the TNEP approach to the prediction of infrared and Raman
spectra of liquid water, a molecule (PTAF-), and a prototypical perovskite with
strong anharmonicity (BaZrO3). The TNEP approach is implemented in the free and
open source software package GPUMD, which makes this methodology readily
available to the scientific community.

<h3>Dipolar coupled core-shell perpendicular shape anisotropy MTJ with  enhanced write speed and reduced cross-talk</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05245" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05245</a>
<br>
<i>N. Caçoilo, L. D. Buda-Prejbeanu, B. Dieny, O. Fruchart, I. L. Prejbeanu</i>
<p>The concept of Perpendicular Shape-Anisotropy Spin-Transfer-Torque Magnetic
Random-Access Memory tackles the downsize scalability limit of conventional
ultrathin magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) below sub-20 nm technological nodes.
This concept uses a thicker storage layer with a vertical aspect ratio,
enhancing the thermal stability factor thanks to the favorable contribution of
the shape anisotropy. However, the increased aspect ratio comes with an
increase in switching time under applied voltage and the cross-over to
non-uniform reversal mechanism at higher aspect ratio, limiting the gain in
scalability. Additionally, the larger volume of the magnetic cell significantly
increases the stray field acting on the neighboring devices compared to thin
MTJs. In this work, we propose the use of a dipolar-coupled core-shell system
as a storage layer. This improves both bottlenecks, as predicted by
micromagnetic simulations for magnetisation reversal, and a macrospin model to
estimate the stray field in a dense array.
