<h3>Macroscopic Fluctuations Anticipate the Critical Singularity Far Away  from the Charge Density Wave Transition</h3>

$(TaSe_4)_2I$ is a quasi-one-dimensional compound long-known to have a
charge-density wave (CDW) transition at around 263 K. We experimentally
establish that this transition, unlike what is seen in other CDW compounds such
as $TaS_2$, is a second-order critical transition. Critical fluctuations in the
CDW condensate, which couple to the dissipative normal carriers, are slow
enough to survive the thermodynamic limit and dominate the low-frequency
resistance noise. Around the transition region, we find a rapid increase in
their relaxation time, as well as a shift of the spectral weight of
fluctuations to lower frequencies. These are direct signatures of the critical
slowing down on account of the softening at the hydrodynamic amplitude modes.
Critical opalescence on the account of diverging isothermal susceptibility is
also seen in the very sharp growth of the variance. The distribution of
fluctuations in the transition region is skewed and strongly non-Gaussian. This
is on account of the breakdown of the validity of the central limit theorem as
the diverging coherence volume becomes comparable to the macroscopic sample
size. The temperature window where the fluctuations manifest as slow and
extended hydrodynamic modes is found to be very wide ($\delta\epsilon \approx
\pm 0.1$, where $\epsilon$ is the reduced critical temperature) but consistent
with the Ginzburg criterion.

We study the kinetics of vapor-liquid phase separation of a hydrodynamics
preserving three-dimensional one component Lennard Jones system in the presence
of external gravitational field using extensive molecular dynamic simulation. A
bicontinuous domain structure is formed when the homogeneous system near the
critical density is quenched inside the coexistence region. In the absence of
gravity, the domain morphology is statistically self-similar and the length
scale grows linearly with time. However, the presence of gravity destroys the
isotropy of the system and affects the scaling laws. We observe an accelerated
domain growth in the direction of the field at late time which resembles
sedimentation process. Consequently, a new length scale emerges which strongly
depends on the field strength. Similar behavior is observed in the direction
perpendicular to the applied field, with a different growth rate. Finally, the
validity of Porod's law and Superuniversality in such anisotropic systems is
verified in terms of two-point equal time order parameter correlation function
and static structure factor.

We investigate theoretically and numerically the impact of an elastic sphere
on a rigid wall in a viscous fluid. Our focus is on the dynamics of the
contact, employing the soft lubrication model in which the sphere is separated
from the wall by a thin liquid film. In the limit of large sphere inertia, the
sphere bounces and the dynamics is close to the Hertz theory. Remarkably, the
film thickness separating the sphere from the wall exhibits non-trivial
self-similar properties that vary during the spreading and retraction phases.
Leveraging these self-similar properties, we establish the energy budget and
predict the coefficient of restitution for the sphere. The general framework
derived here opens many perspectives to study the lubrication film in impact
problems.

<h3>Integrability is attractive</h3>

<br>
<i>Hyeongjin Kim, Anatoli Polkovnikov</i>

The interplay between quantum chaos and integrability has been extensively
studied in the past decades. We approach this topic from the point of view of
geometry encoded in the quantum geometric tensor, which describes the
complexity of adiabatic transformations. In particular, we consider two generic
models of spin chains that are parameterized by two independent couplings. In
one, the integrability breaking perturbation is global while, in the other,
integrability is broken only at the boundary. In both cases, the shortest paths
in the coupling space lead towards integrable regions and we argue that this
behavior is generic. These regions thus act as attractors of adiabatic flows
similar to river basins in nature. Physically, the directions towards
integrable regions are characterized by faster relaxation dynamics than those
parallel to integrability. The anisotropy between them diverges in the
thermodynamic limit as the system approaches the integrable point. We argue
that these directions also serve as attractors of the couplings' time evolution
if they are considered as dynamical degrees of freedom. Therefore, generic
systems are expected to dynamically self tune themselves to integrable or
nearly integrable regimes. As a side result, we provide numerical evidence that
the model with local integrability breaking quickly becomes chaotic but avoids
ergodicity even in the thermodynamic limit.

<h3>Magnon Diffusion Length and Longitudinal Spin Seebeck Effect in Vanadium  Tetracyanoethylene (V[TCNE]$_x$, $x \sim 2$)</h3>

<br>
<br>
Spintronic, spin caloritronic, and magnonic phenomena arise from complex
interactions between charge, spin, and structural degrees of freedom that are
challenging to model and even more difficult to predict. This situation is
compounded by the relative scarcity of magnetically-ordered materials with
relevant functionality, leaving the field strongly constrained to work with a
handful of well-studied systems that do not encompass the full phase space of
phenomenology predicted by fundamental theory. Here we present an important
advance in this coupled theory-experiment challenge, wherein we extend existing
theories of the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) to explicitly include the
temperature-dependence of magnon non-conserving processes. This expanded theory
quantitatively describes the low-temperature behavior of SSE signals previously
measured in the mainstay material yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and predicts a new
regime for magnonic and spintronic materials that have low saturation
magnetization, $M_S$, and ultra-low damping. Finally, we validate this
prediction by directly observing the spin Seebeck resistance (SSR) in the
molecule-based ferrimagnetic semiconductor vanadium tetracyanoethylene
(V[TCNE]$_x$, $x \sim 2$). These results validate the expanded theory, yielding
SSR signals comparable in magnitude to YIG and extracted magnon diffusion
length ($\lambda_m>1$ $\mu$ m) and magnon lifetime for V[TCNE]$_x$
($\tau_{th}\approx 1-10$ $\mu$ s) exceeding YIG ($\tau_{th}\sim 10$ ns).
Surprisingly, these properties persist to room temperature despite relatively
low spin wave stiffness (exchange). This identification of a new regime for
highly efficient SSE-active materials opens the door to a new class of magnetic
materials for spintronic and magnonic applications.

<h3>Absence of Spontaneous Magnetic Fields Due to Time-Reversal Symmetry  Breaking in Bulk Superconducting UTe2</h3>

<br>
We have investigated the low-temperature local magnetic properties in the
bulk of molten salt-flux (MSF) grown single crystals of the candidate
odd-parity superconductor UTe2 by zero-field muon spin relaxation (muSR). In
contrast to previous muSR studies of UTe2 single crystals grown by a chemical
vapour transport (CVT) method, we find no evidence of magnetic clusters or
electronic moments fluctuating slow enough to cause a discernible relaxation of
the zero-field muSR asymmetry spectrum. Consequently, our measurements on
MSF-grown single crystals rule out the generation of spontaneous magnetic
fields in the bulk that would occur near impurities or lattice defects if the
superconducting state of UTe2 breaks time-reversal symmetry. This result
suggests UTe2 is characterized by a single-component superconducting order
parameter.

We present a new velocity-gauge real-time, time-dependent density functional
tight-binding (VG-rtTDDFTB) implementation in the open-source DFTB+ software
package (https://dftbplus.org) for probing electronic excitations in large,
condensed matter systems. Our VG-rtTDDFTB approach enables real-time electron
dynamics simulations of large, periodic, condensed matter systems containing
thousands of atoms with a favorable computational scaling as a function of
system size. We provide computational details and benchmark calculations to
demonstrate its accuracy and computational parallelizability on a variety of
large material systems. As a representative example, we calculate laser-induced
electron dynamics in a 512-atom amorphous silicon supercell to highlight the
large periodic systems that can be examined with our implementation. Taken
together, our VG-rtTDDFTB approach enables new electron dynamics simulations of
complex systems that require large periodic supercells, such as crystal
defects, complex surfaces, nanowires, and amorphous materials.

<h3>Dynamic hysteresis at a noisy saddle-node shows power-law scaling but  nonuniversal exponent</h3>

Dynamic hysteresis, viz., delay in switching of a bistable system on account
of the finite sweep rate of the drive has been extensively studied in dynamical
and thermodynamic systems. Dynamic hysteresis results from slowing of the
response around a saddle-node bifurcation. As a consequence, the hysteresis
area increases with the sweep rate. Mean-field theory, relevant for noise-free
situations, predicts power law scaling with the area scaling exponent of 2/3.
We have experimentally investigated the dynamic hysteresis for a
thermally-driven metal-insulator transition in a high quality NdNiO$_3$ thin
film and found the scaling exponent to be about 1/3, far less than the mean
field value. To understand this, we have numerically studied Langevin dynamics
of the order parameter and found that noise, which can be thought to parallel
finite temperature effects, influences the character of dynamic hysteresis by
systematically lowering the dynamical exponent to as small as 0.2. The power
law scaling character, on the other hand, is unaffected in the range of chosen
parameters. This work rationalizes the ubiquitous power law scaling of the
dynamic hysteresis as well as the wide variation in the scaling exponent
between 0.66 and 0.2 observed in different systems over the last 30 years.

<h3>Casimir versus Helmholtz forces: Exact results</h3>

Recently, attention has turned to the issue of the ensemble dependence of
fluctuation induced forces. As a noteworthy example, in $O(n)$ systems the
statistical mechanics underlying such forces can be shown to differ in the
constant $\vec{M}$ magnetic canonical ensemble (CE) from those in the
widely-studied constant $\vec{h}$ grand canonical ensemble (GCE). Here, the
counterpart of the Casimir force in the GCE is the \textit{Helmholtz} force in
the CE. Given the difference between the two ensembles for finite systems, it
is reasonable to anticipate that these forces will have, in general, different
behavior for the same geometry and boundary conditions. Here we present some
exact results for both the Casimir and the Helmholtz force in the case of the
one-dimensional Ising model subject to periodic and antiperiodic boundary
conditions and compare their behavior. We note that the Ising model has
recently being solved in Phys.Rev. E {\bf 106} L042103(2022), using a
combinatorial approach, for the case of fixed value $M$ of its order parameter.
Here we derive exact result for the partition function of the one-dimensional
Ising model of $N$ spins and fixed value $M$ using the transfer matrix method
(TMM); earlier results obtained via the TMM were limited to $M=0$ and $N$ even.
As a byproduct, we derive several specific integral representations of the
hypergeometric function of Gauss. Using those results, we rigorously derive
that the free energies of the CE and grand GCE are related to each other via
Legendre transformation in the thermodynamic limit, and establish the leading
finite-size corrections for the canonical case, which turn out to be much more
pronounced than the corresponding ones in the case of the GCE.

<h3>Theoretical study of conventional semiconductors as transducers to  increase power and efficiency in betavoltaic batteries</h3>

Semiconductor materials play an important role as transducers of electrical
energy in betavoltaic batteries. Optimal selection of effective factors will
increase the efficiency of these batteries. In this study, based on common
semiconductors and relying on increasing the maximum efficiency of betavoltaic
batteries and the possibility of using 3H, 63Ni, and 147Pm beta sources, the
indicators and criteria for optimal selection of semiconductor materials are
determined. Evaluation criteria include the backscattering coefficient of beta
particles from semiconductors, efficiency of electron-hole pairs generation,
electronic specifications and properties, radiation damage threshold, radiation
yield, stopping power and penetration of beta particles in semiconductors,
physical characteristics, temperature tolerance, accessibility, and fabrication
are considered. Conventional semiconductors have been quantitatively evaluated
based on these criteria and compared with silicon semiconductors. 10
semiconductors, , diamond, 2H-SiC, 3C-SiC, 4H-SiC, AlN, MgO, B4C with effective
atomic number less than 14 and bandgap energy above 1.12 eV at room temperature
(300K) compared to Silicon semiconductors are evaluated. Finally, according to
the evaluation indicators, Diamond, c-BN, and 4H-SiC are more suitable
semiconductors in terms of efficiency have selected, respectively. The results
indicate that for planar batteries, a betavoltaic semiconductor type junction
for Schottky diamond with 147pm radioisotope, and 4H-SiC semiconductors with
63Ni or 3H radioisotopes, and for three-dimensional structures of betavoltaic
batteries, Si combination with 147pm or 63Ni radioisotopes is recommended.

<h3>Accelerating force calculation for dislocation dynamics simulations</h3>

Discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations offer valuable insights into
the plastic deformation and work-hardening behavior of metals by explicitly
modeling the evolution of dislocation lines under stress. However, the
computational cost associated with calculating forces due to the long-range
elastic interactions between dislocation segment pairs is one of the main
causes that limit the achievable strain levels in DDD simulations. These
elastic interaction forces can be obtained either from the integral of the
stress field due to one segment over the other segment, or from the derivatives
of the elastic interaction energy. In both cases, the results involve a
double-integral over the two interacting segments. Currently, existing DDD
simulations employ the stress-based approach with both integrals evaluated
either from analytical expressions or from numerical quadrature. In this study,
we systematically analyze the accuracy and computational cost of the
stress-based and energy-based approaches with different ways of evaluating the
integrals. We find that the stress-based approach is more efficient than the
energy-based approach. Furthermore, the stress-based approach becomes most
cost-effective when one integral is evaluated from analytic expression and the
other integral from numerical quadrature. For well-separated segment pairs
whose center distances are more than three times their lengths, this
one-analytic-integral and one-numerical-integral approach is more than three
times faster than the fully analytic approach, while the relative error in the
forces is less than $10^{-3}$. Because the vast majority of segment pairs in a
typical simulation cell are well-separated, we expect the hybrid
analytic/numerical approach to significantly boost the numerical efficiency of
DDD simulations of work hardening.

Ordered media often support vortex structures with intriguing topological
properties. Here, we investigate non-Abelian vortices in tetrahedral order,
which appear in the cyclic phase of spin-2 Bose--Einstein condensates and in
the tetrahedratic phase of bent-core nematic liquid crystals. Using these
vortices, we construct topologically protected knots in the sense that they
cannot decay into unlinked simple loop defects through vortex crossings and
reconnections without destroying the phase. The discovered structures are the
first examples of knots bearing such topological protection in a known
experimentally realizable system.

Recent advancement in superconducting radio frequency cavity processing
techniques, with diffusion of impurities within the RF penetration depth,
resulted in high quality factor with increase in quality factor with increasing
accelerating gradient. The increase in quality factor is the result of a
decrease in the surface resistance as a result of nonmagnetic impurities doping
and change in electronic density of states. The fundamental understanding of
the dependence of surface resistance on frequency and surface preparation is
still an active area of research. Here, we present the result of RF
measurements of the TEM modes in a coaxial half wave niobium cavity resonating
at frequencies between 0.3-1.3 GHz. The temperature dependence of the surface
resistance was measured between 4.2 K and 1.6 K. The field dependence of the
surface resistance was measured at 2.0 K. The baseline measurements were made
after standard surface preparation by buffered chemical polishing.

Machine learning offers promising tools to develop surrogate models for
polymer structure-property relations. Surrogate models can be built upon
existing polymer data and are useful for rapidly predicting the properties of
unknown polymers. The accuracy of such ML models appears to depend on the
feature space representation of polymers, the range of training data, and
learning algorithms. Here, we establish connections between these factors for
predicting the glass transition temperature of polymers. Our analysis suggests
linear models with a smaller number of fitting parameters are as accurate as
nonlinear models with a large number of hidden and unexplainable parameters.
Also, the performance of a monomer topology-based ML model is found to be
qualitatively identical to that of a physicochemical descriptor-based ML model.
We find that the transferability of ML models enhances as the property range of
the training data increases. Moreover, we establish new Tg polymer chemistry
correlations via ML. Our work illustrates how ML can advance the fundamental
understanding of polymer structure-property correlations.

<h3>Multiple Slater determinants and strong spin-fluctuations as key  ingredients of the electronic structure of electron- and hole-doped  Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO4)$_6$O</h3>

<br>
<br>
LK-99, with chemical formula Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO4)$_6$O, was recently
reported to be a room-temperature superconductor. While this claim has met with
little support in a flurry of ensuing work, a variety of calculations (mostly
based on density-functional theory) have demonstrated that the system possesses
some unusual characteristics in the electronic structure, in particular flat
bands. We have established previously that within DFT, the system is insulating
with many characteristics resembling the classic cuprates, provided the
structure is not constrained to the $P$3(143) symmetry nominally assigned to
it. Here we describe the basic electronic structure of LK-99 within
self-consistent many-body perturbative approach, quasiparticle self-consistent
GW (QSGW) approximation and their diagrammatic extensions. QSGW predicts that
pristine LK-99 is indeed a Mott/charge transfer insulator, with a bandgap gap
in excess of 3eV, whether or not constrained to the $P$3(143) symmetry. The
highest valence bands occur as a pair, and look similar to DFT bands. The
lowest conduction band is an almost dispersionless state of largely Cu $d$
character. When Pb$_9$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O} is hole-doped, the valence bands modify
only slightly, and a hole pocket appears. However, two solutions emerge: a
high-moment solution with the Cu local moment aligned parallel to neighbors,
and a low-moment solution with Cu aligned antiparallel to its environment. In
the electron-doped case the conduction band structure changes significantly:
states of mostly Pb character merge with the formerly dispersionless Cu $d$
state, and high-spin and low spin solutions once again appear. Thus we conclude
that with suitable doping, the ground state of the system is not adequately
described by a band picture, and that strong correlations are likely.

the motion of poles of scattering amplitudes in energy/frequency complex plane.

<br>
<br>
We numerically study stochastic resonance in the unzipping of a model
double-stranded DNA by a periodic force. We observe multiple peaks in
stochastic resonance in the output signal as the driving force frequency is
varied for different force amplitudes, temperature, chain length, and chain
heterogeneity. Multiple peaks point to the existence of multiple stable and
metastable states, which correspond to dynamical states of partially zipped and
unzipped conformations and transitions between them. We quantify such
transitions by looking at the time evolution of the fraction of bound base
pairs. We obtain phase diagrams in the force amplitude-temperature plane both
in the resonance frequency of the primary peak and the output signal at the
peak value. We further obtain an excellent scaling behavior of the output
signal for changing lengths of the DNA. Resonance behavior is also affected by
chain heterogeneity as it depends strongly on which base pair the periodic
forcing is applied.

<h3>Fermi Surface Spin Texture and Topological Superconductivity in  Spin-Orbit Free Non-Collinear Antiferromagnets</h3>

<br>
<br>
We explore the relationship among the magnetic ordering in real space, the
resulting spin texture on the Fermi surface, and the related superconducting
gap structure in non-collinear antiferromagnetic metals without spin-orbit
coupling. Via a perturbative approach, we show that a non-collinear magnetic
ordering in a metal can generate a momentum-dependent spin texture on its Fermi
surface, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, if the metal has more than
three sublattices in its magnetic unit cell. Thus, our theory naturally extends
the idea of altermagnetism to non-collinear spin structures. When
superconductivity is developed in a magnetic metal, as the gap-opening
condition is strongly constrained by the spin texture, the nodal structure of
the superconducting state is also enforced by the magnetism-induced spin
texture. Taking the non-collinear antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice as a
representative example, we demonstrate how the Fermi surface spin texture
induced by noncollinear antiferromagnetism naturally leads to odd-parity
spin-triplet superconductivity with nontrivial topological properties.

Using Green's function equation of motion within Lacroix decoupling scheme,
we examine the thermoelectric transport features of a strongly interacting

description of the thermoelectric transport in the Kondo regime requires a
complete self-consistent treatment of Green's function. The linear
thermoelectric properties, including electrical conductivity, thermal
conductivity, thermopower, and figure of merit, are analyzed as a function of
temperature ranging from Kondo to Coulomb blockade regime. The results
presented here are qualitatively consistent with existing results obtained
using different theoretical techniques.

Cluster formation of microscopic swimmers is key to the formation of biofilms
and colonies, efficient motion and nutrient uptake, but, in the absence of
other interactions, requires high swimmer concentrations to occur. Here we
experimentally and numerically show that cluster formation can be dramatically
enhanced by an anisotropic swimmer shape. We analyze a class of model
microswimmers with a shape that can be continuously tuned from spherical to
bent and straight rods. In all cases, clustering can be described by
Michaelis-Menten kinetics governed by a single scaling parameter that depends
on particle density and shape only. We rationalize these shape-dependent
dynamics from the interplay between interlocking probability and cluster
stability. The bent rod shape promotes assembly even at vanishingly low
particle densities and we identify the most efficient shape to be a semicircle.
Our work provides key insights into how shape can be used to rationally design
out-of-equilibrium self-organization, key to creating active functional
materials and designing targeted two-component drug delivery.

Josephson junctions are currently used as base elements of superconducting
logic systems. Long enough junctions subject to magnetic field host quantum
phase 2{\pi}-singularities - Josephson vortices. Here we report the realization
of the superconducting memory whose state is encoded by the number of present
Josephson vortices. By integrating the junction into a coplanar resonator and
by applying a microwave excitation well below the critical current, we were
able to control the state of the memory in an energy-efficent and
non-destructive manner. The performance of the device is evaluated, and the
routes for creating scalable cryogenic memories directly compatible with
superconducting microwave technologies are discussed.

<br>
<br>
We experimentally investigate supercurrent through Coulomb islands, where
island and leads are fabricated from semiconducting nanowires with fully
surrounding superconducting shells. Applying flux along the wire yields a
series of destructive Little-Parks lobes with reentrant supercurrent. We find
Coulomb blockade with 2$e$ peak spacing in the zeroth lobe and 1$e$ average
spacing, with regions of significant even-odd modulation, in the first lobe.
Evolution of Coulomb-peak amplitude through the first lobe is consistent with a
theoretical model of supercurrent carried predominantly by zero-energy states
in the leads and the island.

Quantum cascade lasers are of high interest in the scientific community due
to unique applications utilizing the emission in mid-IR range. The possible
designs of QCL are quite limited and require careful engineering to overcome
some crucial disadvantages. One of them is an active region (ARn) overheat,
that significantly affects the laser characteristics in the pulsed operation
mode. In this work we consider the effects related to the non-equilibrium
temperature distribution, when thermal resistance formalism is irrelevant. We
employ the heat equation and discuss the possible limitations and structural
features stemming from the chemical composition of the AR. We show that the
presence of alloys in the ARn structure fundamentally limits the heat
dissipation in pulsed and CW regimes due to their low thermal conductivity.
Also the QCL post-growths affects the thermal properties of a device only in
(near)CW mode while it is absolutely invaluable in the pulsed mode

Rashba spin-orbit coupled systems are an important class of materials noted
for diverse fundamental and applied phenomena. Recently, the emergence of
non-linear Hall effect under conditions of time-reversal symmetry has been
discovered in materials with broken inversion symmetry. In this work, we study
the second- and third-order Hall response in Rashba systems with hexagonal
warping. Starting with a low-energy model, we obtain the analytic expressions
and discover the unique dipole profile in Rashba systems with hexagonal
warping. Furthermore, we extend the analysis using a realistic tight-binding
model. Next, we predict the existence of a third-order Hall effect in these
systems, and calculate the Berry connection polarizability tensor analytically.
We also show how the model parameters affect the third-order conductivity. Our
predictions can help in the experimental realization of Berry curvature
multipole physics in Rashba materials with hexagonal warping, and provide a new
platform for engineering the non-linear Hall effects.

<br>
<br>
We consider a one-dimensional system of spinless fermions with single
particle and pair hoppings in a potential on-site disorder. The pair hopping
term violates integrability of the model and enhances superconducting
fluctuations in the bulk of the liquid. By means of the Abelian bosonization
and extensive numerical DMRG calculations we provide evidence that sufficiently
large pair hopping amplitude guarantees the survival of the Tomonaga-Luttinger
liquid phase at weak disorder. Large disorder drives the system to the Bose
glass phase, realising the Giamarchi-Schulz scenario in such a system.

<br>
<br>
The structures of multiply quantized vortices (MQVs) of equal-population
atomic Fermi superfluid in a rotating spherical bubble trap are analyzed by
solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equation throughout the BCS-Bose
Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover. Consistent with the Poincare-Hopf
theorem, a pair of vortices emerge at the poles of the rotation axis in the
presence of azimuthal symmetry, and the compact geometry provides confinement
for the MQVs. While the single-vorticity vortex structure is similar to that in
a planar geometry, higher-vorticity vortices exhibit interesting phenomena at
the vortex center, such as a density peak due to accumulation of normal Fermi
gas and reversed circulation of current due to in-gap states carrying angular
momentum, in the BCS regime but not the BEC regime because of the subtle
relations between the order parameter and density. The energy spectrum shows
the number of the in-gap state branches corresponds to the vorticity of a
vortex, and an explanation based on topological correspondence is provided.

<br>
<br>
We report a new Au-Ga-Ce 1/1 approximant crystal (AC) which possesses a
significantly wide single-phase region of 53 - 70 at% Au and 13.6 - 15.1 at%
Ce. Single crystal X-ray structural analyses reveal the existence of two types
of structural degrees of freedom, i.e., the Au/Ga mixing sites and the
fractional Ce occupancy site: the former enables a large variation in the
electron concentration and the latter allows a variation in the occupancy of a
magnetic impurity atom at the center of the Tsai-type cluster. Following these
findings, the influences of two types of structural modifications on the
magnetism are thoroughly investigated by means of magnetic susceptibility and
specific heat measurements on the Au-Ga-Ce 1/1 AC. The spin-glass (SG) state is
found to be the ground state over the entire single-phase region, showing a
robust nature of the SG state against both structural modifications. In
addition, a gigantic specific heat (C/T) is commonly observed at low
temperatures for all the compositions, which is consistently explained as a
consequence of the spin-freezing phenomenon, not of a heavy Fermion behavior as
reported elsewhere. Moreover, the origin of the SG state in the 1/1 Au-Ga-Ce AC
is attributed to the existence of non-magnetic atom disorder in the Au/Ga
mixing sites. Furthermore, a Kondo behavior is observed in the electrical
resistivity at low temperatures, which is enhanced by increasing the Ce
concentration, verifying that a Ce atom introduced at the cluster center
behaves as a Kondo impurity for the first time.

<h3>Thermodynamic cost of precise timekeeping in an electronic underdamped  clock</h3>

<i>Ashwin Gopal, Massimiliano Esposito, Nahuel Freitas</i>
<br>
<br>
Clocks are inherently out-of-equilibrium because, due to friction, they
constantly consume free energy to keep track of time. The Thermodynamic
Uncertainty Relation (TUR) quantifies the trade-off between the precision of
any time-antisymmetric observable and entropy production. In the context of
clocks, the TUR implies that a minimum entropy production is needed in order to
achieve a certain level of precision in timekeeping. But the TUR has only been
proven for overdamped systems. Recently, a toy model of a classical underdamped
pendulum clock was proposed that violated these relations (Phys. Rev. Lett.
128, 130606), thus demonstrating that the TUR do not hold for underdamped
dynamics. We propose an electronic implementation of such a clock, using a
resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) circuit and a biased CMOS inverter (NOT
gate), which can work at different scales. We find that in the nanoscopic
single-electron regime of the circuit, we essentially recover the toy model
violating the TUR bound. However, in different macroscopic regimes of the
circuit, we show that the TUR bound is restored and analyze the thermodynamic
efficiency of timekeeping.

$\mathrm{LiHoF_{4}}$ is a magnetic material known for its Ising-type
anisotropy, making it a model system for studying quantum magnetism. However,
the theoretical description of $\mathrm{LiHoF_{4}}$ using the quantum Ising
model has shown discrepancies in its phase diagram, particularly in the regime
dominated by thermal fluctuations. In this study, we investigate the role of
off-diagonal dipolar terms in $\mathrm{LiHoF_{4}}$, previously neglected, in
determining its properties. We analytically derive the low-energy effective
Hamiltonian of $\mathrm{LiHoF_{4}}$, including the off-diagonal dipolar terms
perturbatively, both in the absence and presence of a transverse field. Our
results encompass the full $B_{x}-T$ phase diagram, confirming the significance
of the off-diagonal dipolar terms in reducing the zero-field critical
temperature and determining the critical temperature's dependence on the
transverse field. We also highlight the sensitivity of this mechanism to the
crystal structure by comparing our calculations with the $\mathrm{Fe_{8}}$
system.

<br>
We performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on hexagonal
MnTe, a candidate for an altermagnet with a high critical temperature
(TN=307K). By utilizing photon-energy-tunable ARPES in combination with
first-principles calculations, we found that the band structure in the
antiferromagnetic phase exhibits a strongly anisotropic band-splitting
associated with the time-reversal-symmetry breaking, providing the first direct
experimental evidence for the altermagnetic band-splitting. The magnitude of
the splitting reaches 0.8 eV at non-high-symmetry momentum points, which is
much larger than the spin-orbit gap of ~0.3 eV along the GammaK high-symmetry
cut. The present result paves the pathway toward realizing exotic physical
properties associated with the altermagnetic spin-splitting.

<h3>Unifying temperature definition in atomistic and field representations  of conservation laws</h3>

<br>
This work presents a formalism to derive field quantities and conservation
laws from the atomistic using the theory of distributions as the mathematical
tool. By defining temperature as a derived quantity, as that in molecular
kinetic theory and atomistic simulations, a field representation of the
conservation law of linear momentum is precisely derived and expressed in terms
of temperature field, leading to a unified atomistic and continuum description
of temperature and a new conservation equation of linear momentum that,
supplemented by an interatomic potential, completely governs thermal and
mechanical processes across multiple scales from the atomic to the continuum
and can solve for atomistic trajectories for systems at finite temperatures, as
well as the evolution of local field quantities in space and time with atomic
or multiscale resolution. Four sets of numerical examples are presented to
demonstrate the efficacy of the formulation in capturing the effect of
temperature or thermal fluctuations, including phonon density of states,
thermally activated dislocation motion, dislocation formation during
heteroepitaxy, and attenuation of longitudinal acoustic waves as a result of
their interaction with thermal phonons.

We present high-pressure resistance measurements up to 40 GPa on recently
discovered titanium-based kagome metal CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$. At ambient pressure,
CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ shows no evidence of superconductivity in resistivity and
specific heat. By applying pressure, superconductivity emerges and the
superconducting transition temperature ${\it T}_{\rm c}$ reaches its first
maximum of 1.2 K at $\sim$5 GPa. Then the ${\it T}_{\rm c}$ is suppressed by
pressure and cannot be detected around 10 GPa, manifesting as a superconducting
dome. Remarkably, upon further increasing pressure above $\sim$13 GPa, another
superconducting dome shows up, with the maximum ${\it T}_{\rm c}$ of 0.6 K and
ending pressure at $\sim$36 GPa. The variation of ${\it T}_{\rm c}$ displays a
clear double-dome shape in the superconducting phase diagram. Our work
demonstrates the similarity between CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ and CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, providing
valuable insights into the rich physics of these novel kagome metals.

Hydrogen is a promising energy carrier that can push forward the energy
transition because of its high energy density (142 MJ kg-1), variety of
potential sources, low weight and low environmental impact, but its storage for
automotive applications remains a formidable challenge. MgH2, with its high
gravimetric and volumetric density, presents a compelling platform for hydrogen
storage; however, its utilization is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of
hydrogen uptake/release and high temperature operation. Herein we show that a
novel layered heterostructure of reduced graphene oxide and organosilica with
high specific surface area and narrow pore size distribution can serve as a
scaffold to host MgH2 nanoparticles with a narrow diameter distribution around
~2.5 nm and superior hydrogen storage properties to bulk MgH2. Desorption
studies showed that hydrogen release starts at 50 {\deg}C, with a maximum at
348 {\deg}C and kinetics dependent on particle size. Reversibility tests
demonstrated that the dehydrogenation kinetics and re-hydrogenation capacity of
the system remains stable at 1.62 wt.% over four cycles at 200 {\deg}C. Our
results prove that MgH2 confinement in a nanoporous scaffold is an efficient
way to constrain the size of the hydride particles, avoid aggregation and
improve kinetics for hydrogen release and recharging.

The unsaturated linear magnetoresistance (LMR) has attracted widely attention
because of potential applications and fundamental interest. By controlling the
growth temperature, we realized the metal-to-insulator transition in
Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructures. The LMR is observed in metallic samples
with the electron mobility varying over three orders of magnitude. The observed
LMR cannot be explained by the guiding center diffusion model even in samples
with very high mobility. The slope of the observed LMR is proportional to the
Hall mobility, and the crossover field, indicating a transition from quadratic
(at low fields) to linear (at high fields) field dependence, is proportional to
the inverse Hall mobility. This signifies that the classical model is valid to
explain the observed LMR. More importantly, we develop an analytical expression
according to the effective-medium theory that is equivalent to the classical
model. And the analytical expression describes the LMR data very well,
confirming the validity of the classical model.

Nanodiscs are binary discoidal complexes of a phospholipid bilayer
circumscribed by belt-like helical scaffold proteins. Using coarse-grained and
all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we explore the stability, size, and
structure of nanodiscs formed between the N-terminal domain of apolipoprotein
E3 (apoE3-NT) and variable number of
1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) molecules. We study both
parallel and antiparallel double-belt configurations, consisting of four
proteins per nanodisc. Our simulations predict nanodiscs containing between 240
and 420 DMPC molecules to be stable. The antiparallel configurations exhibit an
average of 1.6 times more amino acid interactions between protein chains and 2
times more ionic contacts, compared to the parallel configuration. With one
exception, DMPC order parameters are consistently larger in the antiparallel
configuration than in the parallel one. In most cases, the root mean square
deviation of the positions of the protein backbone atoms is smaller in the
antiparallel configuration. We further report nanodisc size, thickness, radius
of gyration, and solvent accessible surface area. Combining all investigated
parameters, we hypothesize the antiparallel protein configuration leading to
more stable and more rigid nanodiscs than the parallel one.

Classical Heisenberg model with both a nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic
interaction and long-range dipole-dipole interactions is investigated by
numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation. The ground state of the
model without the dipole-dipole interactions is known to be a classical spin
liquid and the system does not order at all temperature because of strong
frustration. On the other hand, the ordered state of the model with weak
dipolar interactions is known to be the so-called Palmer-Chalker (PC) state, in
which a pair of spins and another pair of spins are antiparallel and the former
is perpendicular to the latter for each tetrahedron of the lattice. Here
ordered states of the model are obtained for various values of the relative
strength of the two kinds of the interactions. Besides the spin liquid state
and the PC-like state, states that might be considered as glassy state, states
of period 8, states of period 4, and states of period of 4 on one sublattice
and 8 on other three sublattices are realized. Among the states with period 4
or (and) 8, multi-{\bf K} structures are observed.

We present a scaling view of underscreening observed in salt solutions in the
range of concentrations greater than about 1M, in which the screening length
increases with concentration. The system consists of hydrated clusters of
positive and negative ions with a single unpaired ion as suggested by recent
simulations. The environment of this ion is more hydrated than average which
leads to a self-similar situation in which the size of this environment scales
with the screening length. The prefactor involves the local dielectric constant
and the cluster density. The scaling arguments as well as the cluster model
lead to scaling of the screening length with the ion concentration, in
agreement with observations.

We derive the incremental equations for a hyperelastic solid that incorporate
surface tension effect by assuming that the surface energy is a general
function of the surface deformation gradient. The incremental equations take
the same simple form as their purely mechanical counterparts and are valid for
any geometry. In particular, for isotropic materials, the extra surface elastic
moduli are expressed in terms of the surface energy function and the two
surface principal stretches. The effectiveness of the resulting incremental
theory is illustrated by applying it to study the Plateau--Rayleigh and Wilkes
instabilities in a solid cylinder.

The accelerated optical lattice has emerged as a valuable technique for the
investigation of quantum transport physics and has found widespread application
in quantum sensing, including atomic gravimeters and atomic gyroscopes. In our
study, we focus on the adiabatic evolution of ultra-cold atoms within an
accelerated optical lattice. Specifically, we derive a time bound that delimits
the duration of atomic adiabatic evolution in the oscillating system under
consideration. To experimentally substantiate the theoretical predictions,
precise measurements to instantaneous band populations were conducted within a
one-dimensional accelerated optical lattice, encompassing systematic variations
in both lattice's depths and accelerations. The obtained experimental results
demonstrate a quantitatively consistent correspondence with the anticipated
theoretical expressions. Afterwards, the atomic velocity distributions are also
measured to compare with the time bound. This research offers a quantitative
framework for the selection of parameters that ensure atom trapped throughout
the acceleration process. Moreover, it contributes an experimental criterion by
which to assess the adequacy of adiabatic conditions in an oscillating system,
thereby augmenting the current understanding of these systems from a
theoretical perspective.

Surface charging is a phenomenon ubiquitously observable in in-situ

on the electron-optical imaging of surface charging on a nanostructured surface
following femtosecond-multiphoton photoemission. By quantitatively extracting
the light-induced electrostatic potential and studying the charging dynamics on
the relevant timescales, we gain insights into the details of the multi-photon
photoemission process in the presence of a background field. We study the
interaction of the charge distribution with the high-energy electron beam and
secondary electrons and propose a simple model to describe the interplay of
electron- and light-induced processes.

Finding tunable van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets that operate at above room
temperature is an important research focus in physics and materials science.
Most vdW magnets are only intrinsically magnetic far below room temperature and
magnetism with square-shaped hysteresis at room-temperature has yet to be
observed. Here, we report magnetism in a quasi-2D magnet Cr1.2Te2 observed at
room temperature (290 K). This magnetism was tuned via a protonic gate with an
electron doping concentration up to 3.8 * 10^21 cm^-3. We observed
non-monotonic evolutions in both coercivity and anomalous Hall resistivity.
Under increased electron doping, the coercivities and anomalous Hall effects
(AHEs) vanished, indicating a doping-induced magnetic phase transition. This
occurred up to room temperature. DFT calculations showed the formation of an
antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase caused by the intercalation of protons which
induced significant electron doping in the Cr1.2Te2. The tunability of the
magnetic properties and phase in room temperature magnetic vdW Cr1.2Te2 is a
significant step towards practical spintronic devices.

The alkaline-earth orthovanadate Sr$_3$V$_2$O$_8$ with the palmierite
structure is reported to host a dielectric anomaly as well as a structural
phase transition above the room temperature. With V$^{5+}$ ions and tetrahedral
oxygen coordination, the crystal structure of this compound is not studied in
detail from first principles yet. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis
of the crystal structure and instabilities of M$_3$V$_2$O$_8$ ($\text{M} =
\text{Ca, Sr, Ba}$) orthovanadates with the palmierite structure using first
principles density functional theory. We find that as the M$^{2+}$ cation size
decreases, a significant structural distortion that changes the symmetry from

the oxygen tetrahedra. Our calculations also indicate that the polar
instability in these compounds are suppressed by these tetrahedral rotations.

<h3>Electrical Magnetochiral current in Tellurium</h3>

We have studied theoretically the effect of Electrical Magneto-Chiral
Anisotropy (eMChA) in $p$-type tellurium crystals. It is shown that the terms
$k_i B_j$ in the hole Hamiltonian, linear both in the wave vector ${\mathbf k}$
and the magnetic field ${\mathbf B}$, do not lead to the eMChA and one needs to
include the higher-order terms like $k_i^3 B_j$. Two microscopic mechanisms of
the effect are considered. In the first one only elastic scattering of holes by
impurities or imperfections are taken into consideration only. In the second
mechanism, besides the elastic scattering processes the hole gas heating and
its energy relaxation are taken into account. It is demonstrated that he both
contributions to the magneto-induced rectification are comparable in magnitude.
The calculation is performed by using two independent approaches, namely, in
the time relaxation approximation and in the limit of of small chiral band
parameter $\beta$. A bridge is thrown between the eMChA and magneto-induced
photogalvanic effects.

<h3>Toward a global phase diagram of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall  effect</h3>

Recent experiments on the twisted semiconductor bilayer system $t$MoTe$_2$
have observed integer and fractionally quantized anomalous Hall effects, which
occur in topological moir\'e bands at zero magnetic field. Here, we present a
global phase diagram of $t$MoTe$_2$ throughout the filling range $0\leq n\leq
1$, substantiated by exact diagonalization calculations. At a magic angle, we
find that the system resembles the lowest Landau level (LLL) to a remarkable
degree, exhibiting an abundance of incompressible fractional quantum anomalous
Hall states and compressible anomalous composite Fermi liquid states. Away from
the magic angle, particle-hole symmetry is strongly broken. Some LLL-like
features remain robust near half filling, while others are replaced,
predominantly by charge density waves near $n=0$ and anomalous Hall Fermi
liquids near $n=1$. Among LLL-like phases, we find the anomalous composite
Fermi liquid at $n=\frac{1}{2}$ to be most robust against deviations from the
magic angle. Within the band-projected model, we show that strong particle-hole
asymmetry above the magic angle results from interaction enhanced quasiparticle
dispersion near $n=1$. Our work sets the stage for future exploration of
LLL-like and beyond-LLL phases in fractional quantum anomalous Hall systems.

<h3>Gapless fluctuations and exceptional points in semiconductor lasers</h3>

<br>

We analyze the spectrum of spatially uniform, single-particle fluctuation
modes in the linear electromagnetic response of a semiconductor laser. We show
that if the decay rate of the interband polarization, $\gamma_p$, and the
relaxation rate of the occupation distribution, $\gamma_f$, are different, a
gapless regime exists in which the order parameter $\Delta^{(0)} (k)$ (linear
in the coherent photon field amplitude and the interband polarization) is
finite but there is no gap in the real part of the single-particle fluctuation
spectrum. The laser being a pumped-dissipative system, this regime may be
considered a non-equilibrium analog of gapless superconductivity. We analyze
the fluctuation spectrum in both the photon laser limit, where the interactions
among the charged particles are ignored, and the more general model with
interacting particles. In the photon laser model, the order parameter is
reduced to a momentum-independent quantity, which we denote by $\Delta$. We
find that, immediately above the lasing threshold, the real part of the
fluctuation spectrum remains gapless when $0 < | \Delta | < \sqrt{2 / 27} \, |
\gamma_f - \gamma_p |$ and becomes gapped when $| \Delta |$ exceeds the upper
bound of this range. Viewed as a complex function of $|\Delta|$ and the
electron-hole energy, the eigenvalue set displays some interesting exceptional
point (EP) structure around the gapless-gapped transition. The transition point
is a third-order EP, where three eigenvalues (and eigenvectors) coincide.
Switching on the particle interactions in the full model modifies the spectrum
of the photon laser model and, in particular, leads to a more elaborate EP
structure. However, the overall spectral behavior of the continuous
(non-collective) modes of the full model can be understood on the basis of the
relevant results of the photon laser model.

<br>
<br>
The performance of iron-based superconductors in high magnetic fields plays
an important role for their practical application. In this work, we measured
the magnetostriction and magnetization of BaFe$_{1.908}$Ni$_{0.092}$As$_{2}$
single crystals using pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 T and static magnetic
fields up to 33 T, respectively. A huge longitudinal magnetostriction (of the
order of 10$ ^{-4} $) was observed in the direction of the twin boundaries. The
magnetization measurements evidence a high critical-current density due to
strong bulk pinning. By using magnetization data with an exponential
flux-pinning model, we can reproduce the magnetostriction curves qualitatively.
This result shows that the magnetostriction of
BaFe$_{1.908}$Ni$_{0.092}$As$_{2}$ can be well explained by a
flux-pinning-induced mechanism.

<br>
<br>
The lowest energy states in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers
follow valley selection rules, which have attracted vast interest due to the
possibility of encoding and processing of quantum information. However, these
quantum states are strongly affected by the temperature-dependent intervalley
scattering causing complete valley depolarization, which is hampering any
practical applications of TMD monolayers at room temperature. Therefore, for
achieving clear and robust valley polarization in TMD monolayers one needs to
suppress parasitic depolarization processes, which is the central challenge in
the growing field of valleytronics. Here, in electron-doping experiments on TMD
monolayers, we demonstrate that strong doping levels beyond $10^{13}$~cm$^{-2}$
can induce 61\% and 37\% valley contrast at room temperature in tungsten
diselenide and molybdenum diselenide monolayers, respectively. Our results
indicate that charged excitons in TMD monolayers can be utilized as quantum
units in designing of practical valleytronic devices operating at 300 K.

<br>
<br>
The discovery of all-optical ultra-fast deterministic magnetization switching
has opened up new possibilities for manipulating magnetization in devices using
femtosecond laser pulses. Previous studies on single pulse all-optical
helicity-independent switching (AO-HIS) have mainly focused on perpendicularly
magnetized thin films. This work presents a comprehensive study on AO-HIS for
in-plane magnetized GdxCo100-x thin films. Deterministic single femtosecond
laser pulse toggle magnetization switching is demonstrated in a wider
concentration range (x=10% to 25%) compared to the perpendicularly magnetized
counterparts with GdCo thicknesses up to 30 nm. The switching time strongly
depends on the GdxCo100-x concentration, with lower Gd concentration exhibiting
shorter switching times (less than 500 fs). Our findings in this geometry
provide insights into the underlying mechanisms governing single pulse AO-HIS,
which challenge existing theoretical predictions. Moreover, in-plane magnetized
GdxCo100-x thin films offer extended potential for opto-spintronic applications
compared to their perpendicular magnetized counterparts.

We investigate the superconducting properties of inversion-symmetric twisted
trilayer graphene by considering different parent states, including
spin-singlet, triplet, and SO(4) degenerate states, with or without nodal
points. By placing transition metal dichalcogenide layers above and below
twisted trilayer graphene, spin-orbit coupling is induced in TTLG and, due to
inversion symmetry, the spin-orbit coupling does not spin-split the bands. The
application of a displacement field ($D_0$) breaks the inversion symmetry and
creates spin-splitting. We analyze the evolution of the superconducting order
parameters in response to the combined spin-orbit coupling and $D_0$-induced
spin-splitting. Utilizing symmetry analysis combined with both a direct
numerical evaluation and a complementary analytical study of the gap equation,
we provide a comprehensive understanding of the influence of spin-orbit
coupling and $D_0$ on superconductivity. These results contribute to a better
understanding of the superconducting order in twisted trilayer graphene.

The spin-fermion model was previously successful to describe the complex
phase diagrams of colossal magnetoresistive manganites and iron-based
superconductors. In recent years, two-dimensional magnets have rapidly raised
up as a new attractive branch of quantum materials, which are theoretically
described based on classical spin models in most studies. Alternatively, here
the two-orbital spin-fermion model is established as a uniform scenario to
describe the ferromagnetism in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice. This model
connects the magnetic interactions with the electronic structures. Then the
continuous tuning of magnetism in these honeycomb lattices can be predicted,
based on a general phase diagram. The electron/hole doping, from the empty
$e_{g}$ to half-filled $e_{g}$ limit, is studied as a benchmark. Our Monte
Carlo result finds that the ferromagnetic $T_{C}$ reaches the maximum at the
quarter-filled case. In other regions, the linear relationship between $T_{C}$
and doping concentration provides a theoretical guideline for the experimental
modulations of two-dimensional ferromagnetism tuned by ionic liquid or
electrical gating.

We study the breakdown of Anderson localization in the one-dimensional
nonlinear Klein-Gordon chain, a prototypical example of a disordered classical
many-body system. A series of numerical works indicate that an initially
localized wave packet spreads polynomially in time, while analytical studies
rather suggest a much slower spreading. Here, we focus on the decorrelation
time in equilibrium. On the one hand, we provide a mathematical theorem
establishing that this time is larger than any inverse power law in the
effective anharmonicity parameter $\lambda$, and on the other hand our numerics
show that it follows a power law for a broad range of values of $\lambda$. This
numerical behavior is fully consistent with the power law observed numerically
in spreading experiments, and we conclude that the state-of-the-art numerics
may well be unable to capture the long-time behavior of such classical
disordered systems.

Singlet fission (SF) is a multielectron process in which one singlet exciton
S converts into a pair of triplet excitons T+T. SF is widely studied as it may
help overcome the Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit for semiconductor
photovoltaic cells. To elucidate and control the SF mechanism, great attention
has been given to the identification of intermediate states in SF materials,
which often appear elusive due to the complexity and fast timescales of the SF
process. Here, we apply 10fs-1ms transient absorption techniques to high-purity
rubrene single crystals to disentangle the intrinsic fission dynamics from the
effects of defects and grain boundaries and to identify reliably the fission
intermediates. We show that above-gap excitation directly generates a hybrid
vibronically assisted mixture of singlet state and triplet-pair multiexciton
[S:TT], which rapidly (<100fs) and coherently branches into pure singlet or
triplet excitations. The relaxation of [S:TT] to S is followed by a relatively
slow and temperature-activated (48 meV activation energy) incoherent fission
process. The SF competing pathways and intermediates revealed here unify the
observations and models presented in previous studies of SF in rubrene and
propose alternative strategies for the development of SF-enhanced photovoltaic
materials.

We address the gas, liquid, and crystal phase behaviour of active Brownian
particles in three dimensions. The nonequilibrium force balance at coexistence
leads to equality of state functions for which we use power functional
approximations. Motility-induced phase separation starts at a critical point
and quickly becomes metastable against active freezing for P\'eclet numbers
above a nonequilibrium triple point. The mean swim speed acts as a state
variable, similar to the density of depletion agents in colloidal demixing. We
obtain quantitative agreement with recent simulation results and correctly
predict the strength of particle number fluctuations in active fluids.

For a smooth surface, the chemical composition can be readily evaluated by a
variety of spectroscopy techniques; a prominent example is X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), where the relative proportions of the elements are mainly
determined by the intensity ratio of the element-specific photoelectrons. This
deduction, however, is more intricate for a nanorough surface, such as black
silicon, since the steep slopes of the geometry mimic local variations of the
local emission angle. Here, we explicitly quantify this effect via an integral
geometric analysis, by using so-called Minkowski tensors. Thus, we match the
chemical information from XPS with topographical information from atomic force
microscopy (AFM). Our method provides reliable estimates of layer thicknesses
for nanorough surfaces. For our black silicon samples, we found that the oxide
layer thickness is on average comparable to that of a native oxide layer. Our
study highlights the impact of complex geometries at the nanoscale on the
analysis of chemical properties with implications for a broad class of
spectroscopy techniques.

The magnetic phases of electron-doped, infinite-layer

first-principles density functional calculations. We describe the
antiferromagnetic parent state, metallic phase transition, lattice structure
and magnetic anisotropy evolution upon doping, as well as pressure-induced
changes to the density of states at Fermi level that are consistent with
experiments where comparison is possible. We investigate low-energy states with
multiple magnetic configurations and study their specific heat coefficients and
magnetic exchange coupling, as well as the density of states at Fermi level.
The latter quantity is used to study the effects of spin fluctuations on the

<br>
CeRh$_2$As$_2$ is a new multiphase superconductor with strong suggestions for
an additional itinerant multipolar ordered phase. The modeling of the low
temperature properties of this heavy fermion compound requires a quartet
Ce$^{3+}$ crystal-field ground state. Here we provide the evidence for the
formation of such a quartet state using x-ray spectroscopy. Core-level
photoelectron and x-ray absorption spectroscopy confirm the presence of Kondo
hybridization in CeRh$_2$As$_2$. The temperature dependence of the linear
dichroism unambiguously reveils the impact of Kondo physics for coupling the
Kramer's doublets into an effective quasi-quartet. Non-resonant inelastic x-ray
scattering data find that the $|\Gamma_7^- \rangle$ state with its lobes along
the 110 direction of the tetragonal structure ($xy$ orientation) contributes
most to the multi-orbital ground state of CeRh$_2$As$_2$.

We study field-induced phase transitions of the minimal exchange model
proposed earlier for BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$, a candidate for Kitaev honeycomb
model, using numerical minimization of classical spin clusters. We show that
experimentally observed sequence of step-like transitions in magnetic field is
realized in the phase diagram of the minimal model. Surprisingly, intermediate
up-up-down plateau phase is stabilized only in the proximity of a
double-zigzag$-$zigzag phase boundary. We systematically map out the region of
stability of experimentally observed cascade of transitions and argue that
BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ exchange parameters are close to a region of strong phase
competition, which can explain suppressed saturation field.

III-nitride wide bandgap semiconductors exhibit large exciton binding
energies, preserving strong excitonic effects at room temperature. On the other
hand, semiconducting two-dimensional (2D) materials, including MoS$_2$, also
exhibit strong excitonic effects, attributed to enhanced Coulomb interactions.
This study investigates excitonic interactions between surface GaN quantum well
(QW) and 2D MoS$_2$ in van der Waals heterostructures by varying the spacing
between these two excitonic systems. Optical property investigation first
demonstrates the effective passivation of defect states at the GaN surface
through MoS$_2$ coating. Furthermore, a strong interplay is observed between
MoS$_2$ monolayers and GaN QW excitonic transitions. This highlights the
interest of the 2D material/III-nitride QW system to study near-field
interactions, such as F\"orster resonance energy transfer, which could open up
novel optoelectronic devices based on such hybrid excitonic structures.

uniaxial stress applied in the [001], [110] and [111] directions. The
calculated band gap reductions are equal to 126, 240 and 100 meV at 2$\%$

by deformation applied in the [110] direction. Microfabricated specimens have
been deformed using an on-chip tensile technique up to ~1$\%$ as confirmed by

As the quantification of metabolism, nonequilibrium steady states play a

steady states in continuous-time Markovian systems. The response to an
arbitrary perturbation is computed, and simplified in canonical cases. Beyond
response, we consider ensembles of NESS and derive a fluctuation-response
relation over a non-equilibrium ensemble. Some connections to quantum gravity
are pointed out, and the formulation is extended to a supersymmetric integral
one, which may form the basis of nontrivial solvable models of nonequilibrium
steady states.

Chromium-based nitrides are used in hard, resilient coatings, and show
promise for thermoelectric applications due to their combination of structural,
thermal, and electronic properties. Here, we investigated the electronic
structures and chemical bonding correlated to the thermoelectric properties of
epitaxially grown chromium-based multicomponent nitride Cr(Mo,V)Nx thin films.
Due to minuscule N vacancies, finite population of Cr 3d and N 2p states appear
at the Fermi level and diminishes the band opening for Cr0.51N0.49.
Incorporating holes by alloying V in N deficient CrN matrix results in enhanced
thermoelectric power factor with marginal change in the charge transfer of Cr
to N compared to Cr0.51N0.49. Further alloying Mo isoelectronic to Cr increases
the density of states across the Fermi level due to hybridization of the (Cr,
V) 3d and Mo 4d-N 2p states in Cr(Mo,V)Nx. The hybridization effect with
reduced N 2p states off from stoichiometry drives the system towards metal like
electrical resistivity and reduction in Seebeck coefficient compensating the
overall power factor still comparable to Cr0.51N0.49. The N deficiency also
depicts a critical role in reduction of the charge transfer from metal to N
site. The present work envisages ways for enhancing thermoelectric properties
through electronic band engineering by alloying and competing effects of N
vacancies.

the Zn-rich samples lose metallicity and show a metal-to-insulator

use it to demonstrate strong magnon-phonon coupling in FGT. We show a strong
interaction between magnons and acoustic phonons which leads to formation of
van Hove singularities originating in avoided level crossings and hybridization
between the magnonic and phononic bands in this material. We identify these
additional hybridization points in experiments and compare their energy with
density functional theory calculations. Our findings provide a platform for
designing the properties of dynamic magnon-phonon coupling in two-dimensional

symmetry, and the uniform pairing condition are assumed. It is found that the
relation obtained in [https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.014518]
between the superfluid weight in the flat band limit and the so-called minimal
quantum metric is valid even at the level of the generalized random phase
approximation. For an isolated, but not necessarily flat, band it is found that
the correction to the superfluid weight obtained from the generalized random
phase approximation $D_{\rm s}^{(1)} = D_{\rm s,c}^{(1)}+D_{\rm s,g}^{(1)}$ is
also the sum of a conventional contribution $D_{\rm s,c}^{(1)}$ and a geometric
contribution $D_{\rm s,g}^{(1)}$, as in the case of the known mean-field result
$D_{\rm s}^{(0)}=D_{\rm s,c}^{(0)}+D_{\rm s,g}^{(0)}$, in which the geometric
term $D_{\rm s,g}^{(0)}$ is a weighted average of the quantum metric. The
conventional contribution is geometry independent, that is independent of the
orbital positions, while it is possible to find a preferred, or natural, set of
orbital positions such that $D_{\rm s,g}^{(1)}=0$. Useful analytic expressions
are derived for both the natural orbital positions and the minimal quantum
metric, including its extension to bands that are not necessarily flat.
Finally, using some simple examples, it is argued that the natural orbital
positions may lead to a more refined classification of the topological
properties of the band structure.

Strongly enhanced electron-electron interaction in semiconducting moir\'e
superlattices formed by transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) heterobilayers
has led to a plethora of intriguing fermionic correlated states. Meanwhile,
interlayer excitons in a type-II aligned TMDC heterobilayer moir\'e
superlattice, with electrons and holes separated in different layers, inherit
this enhanced interaction and strongly interact with each other, promising for
realizing tunable correlated bosonic quasiparticles with valley degree of
freedom. We employ photoluminescence spectroscopy to investigate the strong
repulsion between interlayer excitons and correlated electrons in a WS2/WSe2
moir\'e superlattice and combine with theoretical calculations to reveal the
spatial extent of interlayer excitons and the band hierarchy of correlated
states. We further find that an excitonic Mott insulator state emerges when one
interlayer exciton occupies one moir\'e cell, evidenced by emerging
photoluminescence peaks under increased optical excitation power. Double
occupancy of excitons in one unit cell requires overcoming the energy cost of
exciton-exciton repulsion of about 30-40 meV, depending on the stacking
configuration of the WS2/WSe2 heterobilayer. Further, the valley polarization
of the excitonic Mott insulator state is enhanced by nearly one order of
magnitude. Our study demonstrates the WS2/WSe2 moir\'e superlattice as a
promising platform for engineering and exploring new correlated states of
fermion, bosons, and a mixture of both.

Machine learning (ML) is widely used to explore crystal materials and predict
their properties. However, the training is time-consuming for deep-learning
models, and the regression process is a black box that is hard to interpret.
Also, the preprocess to transfer a crystal structure into the input of ML,
called descriptor, needs to be designed carefully. To efficiently predict
important properties of materials, we propose an approach based on ensemble
learning consisting of regression trees to predict formation energy and elastic
constants based on small-size datasets of carbon allotropes as an example.
Without using any descriptor, the inputs are the properties calculated by
molecular dynamics with 9 different classical interatomic potentials. Overall,
the results from ensemble learning are more accurate than those from classical
interatomic potentials, and ensemble learning can capture the relatively
accurate properties from the 9 classical potentials as criteria for predicting
the final properties.

<h3>Breaking Rayleigh's law with spatially correlated disorder to control  phonon transport</h3>

Controlling thermal transport in insulators and semiconductors is crucial for
many technological fields such as thermoelectrics and thermal insulation, for
which a low thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) is desirable. A major obstacle for
realizing low $\kappa$ materials is Rayleigh's law, which implies that acoustic
phonons, which carry most of the heat, are insensitive to scattering by point
defects at low energy. We demonstrate, with large scale simulations on tens of
millions of atoms, that isotropic long-range spatial correlations in the defect
distribution can dramatically reduce phonon lifetimes of important
low-frequency heat-carrying modes, leading to a large reduction of $\kappa$ --
potentially an order of magnitude at room temperature. We propose a general and
quantitative framework for controlling thermal transport in complex functional
materials through structural spatial correlations, and we establish the optimal
functional form of spatial correlations that minimize $\kappa$. We end by
briefly discussing experimental realizations of various correlated structures.

<h3>Lorentz-Invariant Interactions in Honeycomb Lattice with Hubbard  Interaction</h3>

We derive Lorentz-invariant four-fermion interactions, including
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio type (NJL) and superconducting type, which are widely
studied in high-energy physics, from the Honeycomb lattice Hamiltonian with
Hubbard interaction. We investigate the phase transitions induced by these two
interactions and consider the effects of the chemical potential and magnetic
flux (Haldane mass term) on these phase transitions. We find that the chiral
excitation and superconductivity generated by the attractive interactions are
mainly controlled by the chemical potential, while the magnetic flux delimits
the domain of phase transition. Our analysis underscores the influence of the
initial topological state on the phase transitions, a facet largely overlooked
in prior studies. We present experimental protocols using cold atoms to verify
our theoretical results.

Over the past few years, the combination of diffuser and near-field electron
ptychography has drawn more attention by its ability to recover large field of
view with few diffraction patterns. In this paper, we purpose a novel design
and implementation of amplitude diffuser. The amplitude diffuser introduces
structures to the illumination while reducing the inelastic scattering. And the
amplitude diffuser is implemented at the condenser lens aperture, allowing us
to vary the illumination size under the same microscope setup. We demonstrate
the reconstruction results under both conventional Transmission Electron
Microscopy (TEM) mode as well as Lorentz mode.

<h3>A streamlined molecular-dynamics workflow for computing solubilities of  molecular and ionic crystals</h3>

Computing the solubility of crystals in a solvent using atomistic simulations
is notoriously challenging due to the complexities and convergence issues
associated with free-energy methods, as well as the slow equilibration in
direct-coexistence simulations. This paper introduces a molecular-dynamics
workflow that simplifies and robustly computes the solubility of molecular or
ionic crystals. This method is considerably more straightforward than the
state-of-the-art, as we have streamlined and optimised each step of the
process. Specifically, we calculate the chemical potential of the crystal using
the gas-phase molecule as a reference state, and employ the S0 method to
determine the concentration dependence of the chemical potential of the solute.
We use this workflow to predict the solubilities of sodium chloride in water,
urea polymorphs in water, and paracetamol polymorphs in both water and ethanol.
Our findings indicate that the predicted solubility is sensitive to the chosen
potential energy surface. Furthermore, we note that the harmonic approximation
often fails for both molecular crystals and gas molecules at or above room
temperature, and that the assumption of an ideal solution becomes less valid
for highly soluble substances.

The use of the Dunkl derivative, which is defined by a combination of the
difference-differential and reflection operator, allows the classification of
the solutions according to even and odd solutions. Recently, we considered the
Dunkl formalism to investigate the Bose-Einstein condensation of an ideal Bose
gas confined in a gravitational field. In this work, we address a similar
problem and examine an ideal Bose gas trapped by a three-dimensional harmonic
oscillator within the Dunkl formalism. To this end, we derive an analytic
expression for the critical temperature of the N particle system, discuss its
value at large-N limit and finally derive and compare the ground state
population with the usual case result. In addition, we explore two thermal
quantities, namely the Dunkl-internal energy and the Dunkl-heat capacity
functions. The Wigner parameter of the Dunkl formalism can be successfully used
to obtain a better agreement between experimental and theoretical results.

<h3>Phase transitions out of quantum Hall states in moir√© TMD bilayers</h3>

Motivated by the recent experimental breakthroughs in observing Fractional
Quantum Anomalous Hall (FQAH) states in moir\'e Transition Metal Dichalcogenide
(TMD) bilayers, we propose and study various unconventional phase transitions
between quantum Hall phases and Fermi liquids or charge ordered phases upon
tuning the bandwidth. At filling $\nu=-\frac{2}{3}$, we describe a direct
transition between the FQAH state and a Charge Density Wave (CDW) insulator.
The critical theory resembles that of the familiar deconfined quantum critical
point(DQCP) but with an additional Chern-Simons term. At filling
$\nu=-\frac{1}{2}$, we study the possibility of a continuous transition between
the composite Fermi liquid (CFL) and the Fermi liquid (FL) building on and
refining previous work by Barkeshli and McGreevy. Crucially we show that
translation symmetry alone is enough to enable a second order CFL-FL
transition. We argue that there must be critical CDW fluctuations though
neither phase has long range CDW order. We present experimental signatures the
most striking of which is a universal jump of both longitudinal and Hall
resistivities at the critical point. With disorder, we argue that the CDW order
gets pinned and the CFL-FL evolution happens through an intermediate
electrically insulating phase with mobile neutral fermions. A clean analog of
this insulating phase with long range CDW order and a neutral fermi surface can
potentially also exist. We discuss the properties of this phase and the nature
of its phase transitions. We also present a critical theory for the CFL to FL
transition at filling $\nu=-\frac{3}{4}$. Our work opens up a new avenue to
realize deconfined criticalities and fractionalized phases beyond familiar
Landau level physics in the moir\'e Chern band system.
