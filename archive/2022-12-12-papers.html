<h3>Toward precision Fermi liquid theory in flatland</h3>

The ultra-cold and weakly-coupled Fermi gas in two spatial dimensions is
studied in an effective field theory framework. Universal corrections to the
energy density are computed to three orders in the interaction strength with
special consideration given to the scale ambiguity associated with the
non-trivial renormalization of the singular contact interactions. The isotropic
superfluid gap is obtained to next-to-leading order, and nonuniversal
contributions to the energy density due to effective range effects, p-wave
interactions and three-body forces are computed. Results are compared with
precise Monte Carlo simulations of the energy density and the contact in the
weakly-coupled attractive and repulsive Fermi liquid regimes. In addition, the
known all-orders sum of ladder and ring diagrams is compared with Monte Carlo
simulations at weak coupling and beyond.

<h3>Fusing machine learning strategy with density functional theory to  hasten the discovery of MXenes for hydrogen generation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05213" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05213</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The complexity of the topological and combinatorial configuration space of
MXenes can give rise to gigantic design challenges that cannot be addressed
through traditional experimental or routine theoretical approaches. To this
end, we establish a robust and more broadly applicable multistep workflow from
the toolbox of supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms for predicting the
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity over 4,500 MM$^{\prime}$XT$_2$-type
MXenes, where 25\% of the material space (1125 systems) is randomly selected to
evaluate the HER performance using density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. As the most desirable ML model, the random forest regression
method with recursive feature elimination and hyperparameter optimization
accurately and rapidly predicts the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption
($\Delta$G$_{H}$) with a low predictive mean absolute error of 0.374 eV. Based
on these observations, the H-atom adsorbed directly on top of the outermost
metal atomic layer of the MM$^{\prime}$XT$_2$-type MXenes (site-2) with Nb, V,
Mo, Cr and Ti metals composed of carbon based O-functionalization are
discovered to be highly stable and active catalysts, surpassing that of
commercially available platinum based counterparts. Overall, the physically
meaningful predictions and insights of the developed ML/DFT-based multistep
workflow will open new avenues for accelerated screening, rational design and
discovery of potential HER catalysts.

<h3>Rectification of Confined Soft Vesicles Containing Active Particles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05255" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05255</a>
<br>
<i>M. C. Gandikota, A. Cacciuto</i>
<br>
<br>
One of the most promising features of active systems is that they can extract
energy from their environment and convert it to mechanical work. Self propelled
particles enable rectification when in contact with rigid boundaries. They can
rectify their own motion when confined in asymmetric channels and that of
microgears. In this paper, we study the shape fluctuations of two dimensional
flexible vesicles containing active Brownian particles. We show how these
fluctuations not only are capable of easily squeezing a vesicle through narrow
openings, but are also responsible for its rectification when placed within
asymmetric confining channels (ratchetaxis). We detail the conditions under
which this process can be optimized, and sort out the complex interplay between
elastic and active forces responsible for the directed motion of the vesicle
across these channels.

<h3>Exact results for sheared polar active suspensions with variable liquid  crystalline order</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05534" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05534</a>
<br>
<i>Aurore Loisy, Anthony P. Thompson, Jens Eggers, Tanniemola B. Liverpool</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider a confined sheared active polar liquid crystal with a uniform
orientation and study the effect of variations in the magnitude of
polarization. Restricting our analysis to one-dimensional geometries, we
demonstrate that with asymmetric boundary conditions, this system is
characterized, macroscopically, by a linear shear stress vs. shear strain
relationship that does not pass through the origin: At a zero strain rate, the
fluid sustains a non-zero stress. Analytic solutions for the polarization,
density, and velocity fields are derived for asymptotically large or small
systems and are shown by comparison with precise numerical solutions to be good
approximations for finite-size systems.

<h3>Virial expansion for the optical response of doped two-dimensional  semiconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05627" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05627</a>
<br>
<i>B. C. Mulkerin, A. Tiene, F. M. Marchetti, M. M. Parish, J. Levinsen</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a quantum virial expansion for the optical response of a doped
two-dimensional semiconductor. As we show, this constitutes a perturbatively
exact theory in the high-temperature or low-doping regime, where the electrons'
thermal wavelength is smaller than their interparticle spacing. The virial
expansion predicts new features of the photoluminescence, such as a non-trivial
shape of the attractive branch related to universal low-energy exciton-electron
scattering and an associated shift of the attractive peak from the trion
energy. Our results are in excellent agreement with recent experiments on doped
monolayer MoSe2 [Zipfel et al., Phys. Rev. B 105, 075311 (2022)] and they imply
that the trion binding energy is likely to have been overestimated in previous
measurements. Our theory furthermore allows us to formally unify two distinct
theoretical pictures that have been applied to this system, with the
conventional trion picture results emerging as a high-temperature and
weak-interaction limit of Fermi polaron theory.

<h3>Crossover from exciton polarons to trions in doped two-dimensional  semiconductors at finite temperature</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05635" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05635</a>
<br>
<i>A. Tiene, B. C. Mulkerin, J. Levinsen, M. M. Parish, F. M. Marchetti</i>
<br>
<br>
We study systematically the role of temperature in the optical response of
doped two-dimensional semiconductors. By making use of a finite-temperature
Fermi-polaron theory, we reveal a crossover from a quantum-degenerate regime
with well-defined polaron quasiparticles to an incoherent regime at high
temperature or low doping where the lowest energy "attractive" polaron
quasiparticle is destroyed, becoming subsumed into a broad trion-hole
continuum. We demonstrate that the crossover is accompanied by significant
qualitative changes in both absorption and photoluminescence. In particular,
with increasing temperature (or decreasing doping), the emission profile of the
attractive branch evolves from a symmetric Lorentzian to an asymmetric peak
with an exponential tail involving trions and recoil electrons at finite
momentum. We discuss the effect of temperature on the coupling to light for
structures embedded into a microcavity, and we show that there can exist
well-defined polariton quasiparticles even when the exciton-polaron
quasiparticle has been destroyed, where the transition from weak to strong
light-matter coupling can be explained in terms of the polaron linewidths and
spectral weights.

<h3>Phase Fluctuations in Two-Dimensional Superconductors and Pseudogap  Phenomenon</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05737" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05737</a>
<br>
<i>Xucheng Wang, Yang Qi</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the phase fluctuations in the normal state of a general
two-dimensional superconducting system with s-wave pairing. The effect of phase
fluctuations of the pairing fields can be dealt with perturbatively using
disorder averaging, after we treat the local superconducting order parameter as
a static disordered background. It is then confirmed that the phase
fluctuations above the two-dimensional Berenzinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition give birth to the pseudogap phenomenon, leading to a significant
broadening of the single-particle spectral functions. Quantitatively, the
broadening of the spectral weights at the BCS gap is characterized by the ratio
of the superconducting coherence length and the spatial correlation length of
the superconducting pairing order parameter. Our results are tested on the
attractive-U fermion Hubbard model on the square lattice, using unbiased
determinant quantum Monte Carlo method and stochastic analytic continuation.

<h3>Mechanical response of a thick poroelastic gel in contactless  colloidal-probe rheology</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05821" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05821</a>
<br>
<i>Caroline Kopecz-Muller, Vincent Bertin, Elie Raphael, Joshua D Mcgraw, Thomas Salez</i>
<br>
<br>
When a rigid object approaches a soft material in a viscous fluid,
hydrodynamic stresses arise in the lubricated contact region and deform the
soft material. The elastic deformation modifies in turn the flow, hence
generating a soft-lubrication coupling. Moreover, soft elastomers and gels are
often porous. These materials may be filled with solvent or uncrosslinked
polymer chains, and might be permeable to the surrounding fluid, which
complexifies further the description. Here, we derive the point-force response
of a semi-infinite and permeable poroelastic substrate. Then, we use this
fundamental solution in order to address the specific poroelastic lubrication
coupling associated with contactless colloidal-probe methods. In particular, we
derive the conservative and dissipative components of the force associated with
the oscillating vertical motion of a sphere close to the poroelastic substrate.
Our results may be relevant for dynamic surface force apparatus and contactless
colloidal-probe atomic force microscopy experiments on soft, living and/or
fragile materials, such as swollen hydrogels and biological membranes.

<h3>The effect of temperature and excitation energy on Raman scattering in  bulk HfS$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05924" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05924</a>
<br>
<i>Igor Antoniazzi, Natalia Zawadzka, Magdalena Grzeszczyk, Tomasz Woźniak, Jordi Ibáñez, Zahir Muhammad, Weisheng Zhao, Maciej R. Molas, Adam Babiński</i>
<br>
<br>
Raman scattering (RS) in bulk hafnium disulfide (HfS$_2$) is investigated as
a function of temperature (5 K $-$ 350 K) with polarization resolution and
excitation of several laser energies. An unexpected temperature dependence of
the energies of the main Raman-active (A$_{\textrm{1g}}$ and E$_{\textrm{g}}$)
modes with the temperature-induced blueshift in the low-temperature limit is
observed. The low-temperature quenching of a mode $\omega_1$ (134 cm$^{-1}$)
and the emergence of a new mode at approx. 184 cm$^{-1}$, labeled Z, is
reported. The optical anisotropy of the RS in HfS$_2$ is also reported, which
is highly susceptible to the excitation energy. The apparent quenching of the
A$_{\textrm{1g}}$ mode at $T$=5 K and of the E$_{\textrm{g}}$ mode at $T$=300 K
in the RS spectrum excited with 3.06~eV excitation is also observed. We discuss
the results in the context of possible resonant character of light-phonon
interactions. Analyzed is also a possible effect of the iodine molecules
intercalated in the van der Waals gaps between neighboring HfS$_2$ layers,
which inevitably result from the growth procedure.

<h3>The most probable path of Active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05941" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05941</a>
<br>
<i>Andrea Crisanti, Matteo Paoluzzi</i>
<br>
<br>
Using the path integral representation of the non-equilibrium dynamics, we
compute the most probable path between arbitrary starting and final points,
followed by an active particle driven by persistent noise. We focus our
attention on the case of active particles immersed in harmonic potentials,
where the trajectory can be computed analytically. Once we consider the
extended Markovian dynamics where the self-propulsive drive evolves according
to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we can compute the trajectory analytically
with arbitrary conditions on position and self-propulsion velocity. We test the
analytical predictions against numerical simulations and we compare the
analytical results with those obtained within approximated equilibrium-like
dynamics.

<h3>Gelation and Re-entrance in Mixtures of Soft Colloids and Linear  Polymers of Equal Size</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05992" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05992</a>
<br>
<i>D. Parisi, D. Truzzolillo, A. H. Slim, P. Dieudonné-George, S. Narayanan, J. C. Conrad, V. D. Deepak, M. Gauthier, D. Vlassopoulos</i>
<br>
<br>
Liquid mixtures composed of colloidal particles and much smaller
non-adsorbing linear homopolymers can undergo a gelation transition due to
polymer-mediated depletion forces. We now show that the addition of linear
polymers to suspensions of soft colloids having the same hydrodynamic size
yields a liquid-to-gel-to-re-entrant liquid transition. In particular, the
dynamic state diagram of 1,4-polybutadiene star-linear polymer mixtures was
determined with the help of linear viscoelastic and small angle X-ray
scattering experiments. While keeping the star polymers below their nominal
overlap concentration, a gel was formed upon increasing the linear polymer
content. Further addition of linear chains yielded a re-entrant liquid. This
unexpected behavior was rationalized by the interplay of three possible
phenomena: (i) depletion interactions, driven by the size disparity between the
stars and the polymer length scale which is the mesh size of this entanglement
network; (ii) colloidal deswelling due to the increased osmotic pressure
exerted onto the stars; and (iii) a concomitant progressive suppression of
depletion efficiency on increasing polymer concentration due to reduced mesh
size, hence a smaller range of attraction. Our results unveil an exciting new
way to tailor the flow of soft colloids and highlight a largely unexplored path
to engineer soft colloidal mixtures.

<h3>Circular motion subject to external alignment under active driving:  nonlinear dynamics and the circle map</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06024" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06024</a>
<br>
<i>Andreas M. Menzel</i>
<br>
<br>
Hardly any real self-propelling or actively driven object is perfect. Thus,
undisturbed motion will generally not follow straight lines but rather circular
trajectories. We here address self-propelled or actively driven objects that
move in discrete steps and additionally tempt to migrate towards a certain
direction by discrete angular adjustment. Overreaction in the angular alignment
is possible. This competition implies pronounced nonlinear dynamics including
period doubling and chaotic behavior in a broad parameter regime. Such behavior
directly affects the appearance of the trajectories, also during collective
motion under spatial self-concentration.

<h3>Slow inter-minima relaxation and its consequence for BEC of magnons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06085" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06085</a>
<br>
<i>Gang Li, Haichen Jia, Valery Pokrovsky</i>
<br>
<br>
Two recent articles of the Munster University experimental team led by S.O.
Demokritov displayed several important facts related to the Bose-Einstein
condensation of magnons (BECM) under permanent pumping first discovered in
2006. They contradicted existing theories of this phenomenon, which predict the
attractive interaction between magnons and strong spontaneous violation of the
reflection symmetry. In this article, we show that these theories implicitly
assumed all relaxation processes to be fast compared with the lifetime of the
magnons, whereas one of them -- relaxation between two minima of energy -- is
slow. We classify processes responsible for the inter-minima relaxation and
present their analytic theory. We analyze how the slow inter-minima relaxation
modifies the anticipated properties of a ferromagnet with the magnon
condensate.

<h3>Hofstadter states and reentrant charge order in a semiconductor moiré  lattice</h3>

The emergence of moir\'e materials with flat bands provides a platform to
systematically investigate and precisely control correlated electronic phases.
Here, we report local electronic compressibility measurements of a twisted
WSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterobilayer which reveal a rich phase diagram of
interpenetrating Hofstadter states and electron solids. We show that this
reflects the presence of both flat and dispersive moir\'e bands whose relative
energies, and therefore occupations, are tuned by density and magnetic field.
At low densities, competition between moir\'e bands leads to a transition from
commensurate arrangements of singlets at doubly occupied sites to triplet
configurations at high fields. Hofstadter states (i.e., Chern insulators) are
generally favored at high densities as dispersive bands are populated, but are
suppressed by an intervening region of reentrant charge-ordered states in which
holes originating from multiple bands cooperatively crystallize. Our results
reveal the key microscopic ingredients that favor distinct correlated ground
states in semiconductor moir\'e systems, and they demonstrate an emergent
lattice model system in which both interactions and band dispersion can be
experimentally controlled.

<h3>Intensity pseudo-localized phase in the glassy random laser</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05106" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05106</a>
<br>
<i>Jacopo Niedda, Luca Leuzzi, Giacomo Gradenigo</i>
<br>
<br>
Evidence of an emergent pseudo-localized phase characterizing the
low-temperature replica symmetry breaking phase of the complex disordered
models for glassy light is provided in the mode-locked random laser model. A
pseudo-localized phase corresponds to a state in which the intensity of light
modes is neither equipartited among all modes nor really localized on few of
them. Such a hybrid phase has been recently characterized in other models, such
as the Discrete Non-Linear Schr\"odinger equation, just as a finite size
effect, while in the low temperature phase of the glassy random laser it seems
to be robust in the limit of large size.

<h3>Anyonic exchange in a beam splitter</h3>

The exotic braiding of anyons is certainly the most tantalizing aspect of
fractional quantum Hall states. Although braiding is usually thought as a
two-dimensional adiabatic manipulation, the braiding phase can also be captured
in one dimension in an out-of-equilibrium setting. We discuss here to what
extend a beam splitter reveals the braiding phase when excited with voltage or
current pulses. We identify two main physical mechanisms that govern the sign
and the size of the output cross-correlations: the non-linearity, characterized
by the tunneling exponent, and the presence of holes in the incoming beams,
related to the braiding phase. We show how the incoming signals form an
environment for the beam splitter (akin to the dynamical Coulomb blockade
effect) and thus interpret the mixing not as a collision of particles, but as a
collision or interference of waves. We illustrate the physical picture with
various examples of excitations for integer and fractional Hall states and show
the emergence of genuine antibunching statistics when mixing dense voltage
pulses.

<h3>The entropy production of stationary diffusions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05125" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05125</a>
<br>
<i>Lancelot Da Costa, Grigorios A. Pavliotis</i>
<br>
<br>
The entropy production rate is a central quantity in non-equilibrium
statistical physics, scoring how far a stochastic process is from being
time-reversible. In this paper, we compute the entropy production of diffusion
processes at non-equilibrium steady-state under the condition that the
time-reversal of the diffusion remains a diffusion. We start by characterising
the entropy production of both discrete and continuous-time Markov processes.
We investigate the time-reversal of time-homogeneous stationary diffusions and
recall the most general conditions for the reversibility of the diffusion
property, which includes hypoelliptic and degenerate diffusions, and locally
Lipschitz vector fields. We decompose the drift into its time-reversible and
irreversible parts, or equivalently, the generator into symmetric and
antisymmetric operators. We show the equivalence with a decomposition of the
backward Kolmogorov equation considered in hypocoercivity theory, and a
decomposition of the Fokker-Planck equation in GENERIC form. The main result
shows that when the time-irreversible part of the drift is in the range of the
volatility matrix (almost everywhere) the forward and time-reversed path space
measures of the process are mutually equivalent, and evaluates the entropy
production. When this does not hold, the measures are mutually singular and the
entropy production is infinite. We verify these results using exact numerical
simulations of linear diffusions. We illustrate the discrepancy between the
entropy production of non-linear diffusions and their numerical simulations in
several examples and illustrate how the entropy production can be used for
accurate numerical simulation. Finally, we discuss the relationship between
time-irreversibility and sampling efficiency, and how we can modify the
definition of entropy production to score how far a process is from being
generalised reversible.

<h3>Exact Dynamical Equations for Kinetically-Constrained-Models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05132" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05132</a>
<br>
<i>Gianmarco Perrupato, Tommaso Rizzo</i>
<br>
<br>
The mean-field theory of Kinetically-Constrained-Models is developed by
considering the Fredrickson-Andersen model on the Bethe lattice. Using certain
properties of the dynamics observed in actual numerical experiments we derive
asymptotic dynamical equations equal to those of Mode-Coupling-Theory.
Analytical predictions obtained for the dynamical exponents are successfully
compared with numerical simulations in a wide range of models including the
case of generic values of the connectivity and the facilitation, random pinning
and fluctuating facilitation. The theory is thus validated for both continuous
and discontinuous transition and also in the case of higher order critical
points characterized by logarithmic decays.

<h3>Across-Layer Sliding Ferroelectricity in Graphene-Based Heterolayers:  Asymmetry of Next Neighbor Interlayer Couplings</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05182" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05182</a>
<br>
<i>Liu Yang, Menghao Wu</i>
<br>
<br>
Although most two-dimensional (2D) materials are non-ferroelectric with
highly symmetric lattices, symmetry breaking may take place in their bilayers
upon certain stacking order, giving rise to so-called sliding ferroelectricity
where the vertical polarizations can be electrically reversed via interlayer
translation. However, it is not supposed to appear in systems like graphene
bilayer with centro-symmetry at any stacking configuration, and the origin of
the recently reported ferroelectricity in graphene bilayer intercalated between
h-BN (Nature 2020, 588, 71) is still unclear. Here we propose a model of
across-layer sliding ferroelectricity that arises from the asymmetry of next
neighbor interlayer couplings. The vertical polarizations in intercalated
centro-symmetric 2D materials like graphene bilayer can be switched via
multilayer sliding, and the observed ferroelectric hysteresis can be clarified.
Moreover, such ferroelectricity can exist in a series of other heterolayers
with quasi-degenerate polar states, like graphene bilayer or trilayer on BN
substrate, or even with a molecule layer on surface where each molecule can
store 1 bit data independently, resolving the bottleneck issue of sliding
ferroelectricity for high-density data storage.

<h3>Tunable energy-level inversion in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein  condensates</h3>

<br>
<i>Huan-Bo Luo, Boris A. Malomed, Wu-Ming Liu, Lu Li</i>
<br>
<br>
A method to realize controllable inversion of energy levels in a
one-dimensional spin-orbit (SO)-coupled two-component Bose-Einstein condensate
under the action of a gradient magnetic field and harmonic-oscillator (HO)
trapping potential is proposed. The linear version of the system is solved
exactly. By adjusting the SO coupling strength and magnetic-field gradient, the
energy-level inversion makes it possible to transform any excited state into
the ground state. The full nonlinear system is solved numerically, and it is
found that the results are consistent with the linear prediction in the case of
the repulsive inter-component interaction. On the other hand, the
inter-component attraction gives rise to states of superposition and edge
types. Similar results are also reported for the system with the HO trap
replaced by the box potential. These results suggest a possibility to realize
any excited state and observe it in the experiment.

<h3>Fragmentation of a trapped bosonic mixture</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05227" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05227</a>
<br>
<i>Ofir E. Alon, Lorenz S. Cederbaum</i>
<br>
<br>
Fragmentation of bosons and pairs in a trapped imbalanced bosonic mixture is
investigated analytically using an exactly solvable model, the generic
harmonic-interaction model for mixtures. Closed-form expressions for the
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the reduced one-particle and two-particle
density matrices as a function of all parameters, the masses, numbers of
bosons, and the intraspecies and interspecies interactions, are obtained and
analyzed. As an application, we consider a system made of $N_1=100$
non-interacting species $1$ bosons embedded in a bath made of $N_2=10^6$
non-interacting species $2$ bosons, and show how fragmentation of the system's
bosons and pairs emerges from the system--bath interaction only. Interestingly,
the lighter the bosons comprising the bath are the stronger is the system's
fragmentation. Further applications are briefly discussed.

<h3>Dynamics of microswimmers near a liquid-liquid interface with viscosity  difference</h3>

<br>
<br>
Transport of material across liquid interfaces is ubiquitous for living cells
and is also a crucial step in drug delivery and in many industrial processes.
The fluids that are present on either side of the interfaces will usually have
different viscosities. We present a physical model for the dynamics of
microswimmers near a soft and penetrable interface that we solve using computer
simulations of Navier-Stokes flows. The literature contains studies of similar
isoviscous fluid systems, where the two fluids have the same viscosity. Here we
extend this to the more general case where they have different viscosities. We
investigate the effect of the fluid viscosity ratio on the movement patterns of
microswimmers. We find that swimmers systematically reorientate towards the
region containing the lower viscosity fluid. Ultimately this is expected to
drive the swimmers to behave as if they are more inclined to swim in low
viscosity fluids. Furthermore, in addition to the types of swimming already
reported in the isoviscous system, i.e. bouncing, sliding and penetrating, we
observed a hovering motion, in which strong pullers swim parallel to the
interface with a certain distance, which is consistent with the dynamics of
such swimmers near the solid wall.

Using the previously developed model we study the electrocaloric effect (ECE)
in antiferroelectric crystals of squaric acid. At low temperatures, the
polarization reorientation by the electric field applied along the
crystallographic $a$ axis of these crystals is predicted to be a two-stage
process, with one of the sublattice polarizations switched twice, by 90$^\circ$
each time. The $T$-$E$ landscapes of the model polarization and entropy are
explored. The ECE, characterized by the introduced electric Gr\"uneisen
parameter, is found to be negative in the antiferroelectric phase. In the
intermediate ferrielectric phase with perpendicular sublattice polarizations it
is positive at low fields, but becomes slightly negative below the transition
to the ferroelectric phase. In the ferroelectric phase the ECE is positive at
all temperatures and fields. Maximal EC temperature shift magnitude is
predicted to be just less than -3 K at 200 kV/cm. The supercritical behavior of
the Gr\"uneisen parameter in the crossover region between two bicritical end
points is explored.

In magnetically ordered materials with localized electrons, the fundamental
magnetic interactions are due to exchange of electrons [1-3]. Typically, only
the interaction between pairs of electrons' spins is considered to explain the
nature of the ground state and its excitations, whereas three-, four-, and
six-spin interactions are ignored. When these higher order processes occur in a
loop they are called cyclic or ring exchange. The ring-exchange interaction is
required to explain low temperature behavior in bulk and thin films of solid
$^3$He [4-8]. It also plays a crucial role in the quantum magnet La$_2$CuO$_4$
[9,10]. Here, we use a combination of time domain THz (TDTS) and magneto-Raman
spectroscopies to measure the low energy magnetic excitations in CoTiO$_3$, a
proposed Dirac topological magnon material [11,12] where the origin of the
energy gap in the magnon spectrum at the Brillouin zone center remains unclear.
We measured the magnetic field dependence of the energies of the two lowest
energy magnons and determine that the gap opens due to the ring-exchange
interaction between the six spins in a hexagon. This interaction also explains
the selection rules of the THz magnon absorption. Finally, we clarify that
topological surface magnons are not expected in CoTiO$_3$. Our study
demonstrates the power of combining TDTS and Raman spectroscopies with theory
to identify the microscopic origins of the magnetic excitations in quantum
magnets.

Short-range (SR) magnetic orders such as magnetic glass orders or
fluctuations in a quantum system usually host exotic states or critical
behaviors. As the long-range (LR) magnetic orders, SR magnetic orders can also
break time-reversal symmetry and drive the non-zero Berry curvature leading to
novel transport properties. In this work, we report that in EuZn$_2$As$_2$
compound, besides the LR A-type antiferromagnetic (AF) order, the SR magnetic
order is observed in a wide temperature region. The magnetization measurements
and electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements reveal the ferromagnetic (FM)
correlations for this SR magnetic order which results in an obvious anomalous
Hall effect above the AF transition. Moreover the ESR results reveal that this
FM SR order coexists with LR AF order exhibiting anisotropic magnetic
correlations below the AF transition. The interactions of LR and SR magnetism
evolving with temperature and field can host non-zero spin charility and berry
curvature leading the additional topological Hall contribution even in a
centrosymmetric simple AF system. Our results indicate that EuZn$_2$As$_2$ is a
fertile platform to investigate exotic magnetic and electronic states.

<h3>Dynamical optical conductivity for gapped $α-\mathcal{T}_3$  materials with a curved "flat" band</h3>

<br>
<br>
We have calculated the dynamical optical conductivity for
$\alpha-\mathcal{T}_3$ materials in the presence of a finite bandgap in their
energy bandstructure. This is a special type of energy dispersions because for
all $\alpha-\mathcal{T}_3$ materials with a bandgap, except graphene and a dice
lattice limits, the flat band receives a non-zero dispersion and assumes a
curved shape. The infinite ${\bf k}$-degeneracy of the flat energy band is also
lifted. Such a low-energy bandstructure could be obtained if an
$\alpha-\mathcal{T}_3$ material is irradiated off-resonant with circularly
polarized light. We have calculated the optical conductivity for the zero and
finite temperatures, as well as for the cases of a finite and nearly-zero
doping. We have demonstrated that analytical expressions could be in principle
obtained for all types of gapped $\alpha-\mathcal{T}_3$ materials and provided
the closed-form analytical expressions for a gapped dice lattice. Our numerical
results reveal some well-known signatures of the optical conductivity in
$\alpha-\mathcal{T}_3$ and silicene with two non-equivalent bandgaps, as well
as demonstrate some very specific features which have not been previously found
in any existing Dirac materials.

<h3>Microwave response of type-II superconductors at weak pinning</h3>

<i>B. V. Pashinsky, M. V. Feigel'man, A. V. Andreev</i>
<br>
<br>
Theory of linear microwave response of thin films of type-II superconductors
in the mixed state is developed taking into account random spatial fluctuations
of the parameters of the system, such as the order parameter, diffusion
coefficient, or film thickness. In the regime of collective pinning the
microwave response of the system exhibits strong frequency dispersion, arising
from nonequilibrium vortex core quasiparticles. The corresponding contribution
to the ac conductivity is controlled by the inelastic relaxation time, and may
exceed the usual Bardeen-Stephen conductivity. It is caused by the Debye-type
inelastic relaxation. Debye mechanism of microwave losses may be responsible
for strong effects of electromagnetic noise upon dc conductivity in the mixed
state at low temperatures.

Graphene shows a strong promise for detection of terahertz (THz) radiation
due to its high carrier mobility, compatibility with on-chip waveguides and
transistors, and small heat capacitance. At the same time, weak reaction of
graphene's physical properties on the detected radiation can be traced down to
the absence of band gap. Here, we study the effect of electrically-induced band
gap on THz detection in graphene bilayer with split-gate p-n junction. We show
that gap induction leads to simultaneous increase in current and voltage
responsivities. At operating temperatures of ~25 K, the responsivity at 20 meV
band gap is from 3 to 20 times larger than that in the gapless state. The
maximum voltage responsivity of our devices at 0.13 THz illumination exceeds 50
kV/W, while the noise equivalent power falls down to 36 fW/Hz^0.5. These values
set new records for semiconductor-based cryogenic terahertz detectors, and pave
the way for efficient and fast terahertz detection.

Mirror symmetric twisted trilayer graphene (tTLG) is composed of even parity
twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG)-like bands and odd parity Dirac-like bands.
Here, we study the mirror-symmetric and mirror-asymmetric Hofstadter-Moir\'{e}
(HM) fractal bands of tTLG. A novel quantum parity Hall state is identified in
mirror-symmetric tTLG at experimentally accessible charge densities. This
mirror symmetry-protected topological phase exhibits simultaneous quantized
Hall and longitudinal resistances. The effects of the displacement field on the
HM fractal bands of tTLG and topological phase transitions are also studied.
The application of an electric displacement field results in an emergent weakly
dispersive band at the charge neutrality point for a range of twist angles.
This zero-energy state resides in the middle layer. It is isolated from the HM
spectrum by an energy gap that scales proportional to the applied displacement
field, making it a prime candidate to host correlated topological states.

We propose a comprehensive set of indicators (including methods to obtain and
analyse them) for computational screening of candidate cathode materials for
rechargeable Zn-ion aqueous batteries relying on Zn$^{2+}$ intercalation
processes. The indicators capture feasibility of Zn$^{2+}$ intercalation and
transport within the material, the thermodynamic stability of charged and
discharged material structures, electrochemical stability of the cathode
material and electrolyte, volume expansion, and energy storage capacity. The
approach was applied to well-known cathode materials ($\alpha$-MnO$_2$ and
V$_2$O$_5$) as well as some potential alternatives (MoS$_2$, ZrP$_2$O$_7$,
MoO$_3$, and FeO$_2$). We show that selection of cathode materials for Zn-ion
aqueous rechargeable batteries is a multifaceted problem, and first principle
calculations can help to narrow down the search. Despite us being unable to
identify a particularly successful cathode material, tools and techniques
developed in this work can be applied more broadly to screen a wider array of
potential material compositions and structures, with the goal of identifying
next generation cathode materials for aqueous rechargeable batteries with the
intercalation energy storage mechanism not limited to Zn$^{2+}$ ions.

Well-defined spin-wave excitation with a band energy of 20 meV was observed
below $T_{N} = 76$ K. Using the linear spin-wave theory, the spectrum was
reasonably reproduced with honeycomb spin layers coupled along the stacking

Optical control of spin in semiconductors has been pioneered using
nanostructures of III-V and II-VI semiconductors, but the emergence of
two-dimensional van der Waals materials offers an alternative low-dimensional
platform for spintronic phenomena. Indium selenide (InSe), a group-III
monochalcogenide van der Waals material, has shown promise for opto-electronics
due to its high electron mobility, tunable direct bandgap, and quantum
transport. There are predictions of spin-dependent optical selection rules
suggesting potential for all-optical excitation and control of spin in a
two-dimensional layered material. Despite these predictions, layer-dependent
optical spin phenomena in InSe have yet to be explored. Here, we present
measurements of layer-dependent optical spin dynamics in few-layer and bulk
InSe. Polarized photoluminescence reveals layer-dependent optical orientation
of spin, thereby demonstrating the optical selection rules in few-layer InSe.
Spin dynamics are also studied in many-layer InSe using time-resolved Kerr
rotation spectroscopy. By applying out-of-plane and in-plane static magnetic
fields for polarized emission measurements and Kerr measurements, respectively,
the $g$-factor for InSe was extracted. Further investigations are done by
calculating precession values using a $\textbf{k} \cdot \textbf{p}$ model,
which is supported by \textit{ab-initio} density functional theory. Comparison
of predicted precession rates with experimental measurements highlights the
importance of excitonic effects in InSe for understanding spin dynamics.
Optical orientation of spin is an important prerequisite for opto-spintronic
phenomena and devices, and these first demonstrations of layer-dependent
optical excitation of spins in InSe lay the foundation for combining
layer-dependent spin properties with advantageous electronic properties found
in this material.

HgTe is a versatile topological material and has enabled the realization of a
variety of topological states, including two- and three-dimensional (3D)
topological insulators and topological semimetals. Nevertheless, a quantitative
understanding of its electronic structure remains challenging, in particular
due to coupling of the Te 5p-derived valence electrons to Hg 5d core states at
shallow binding energy. We present a joint experimental and theoretical study
of the electronic structure in strained HgTe(001) films in the 3D
topological-insulator regime, based on angle-resolved photoelectron
spectroscopy and density functional theory. The results establish detailed
agreement in terms of (i) electronic band dispersions and orbital symmetries,
(ii) surface and bulk contributions to the electronic structure, and (iii) the
importance of Hg 5d states in the valence-band formation. Supported by theory,
our experiments directly image the paradigmatic band inversion in HgTe,
underlying its non-trivial band topology.

<h3>Strain induced variations in transport and optical properties of  SrVO$_3$: a DFT+U study</h3>

<br>
<br>
First-principles calculations based on density functional theory + Hubbard U
(DFT+U) approach have been carried out to study the strain induced variations
in the optical and transport properties of the correlated perovskite SrVO$_3$.
By virtue of its conductivity, high carrier mobility and optical transparency,
SrVO$_3$ can be used as a potential replacement of indium tin oxide (ITO) as a
transparent conductor. As strain tuning is an effective way to tune the
electron-electron correlations in correlated oxides, the epitaxial strain
induced variations in V-3d bandwidth, band center shift and band splitting at
high symmetry points (${\Gamma}$, R) in SrVO$_3$ are investigated. The
alterations in resistivity, carrier concentration, Hall coefficient and plasma
frequency with applied strain are also elucidated. Our calculations revealed
that under tensile strain, the lifting of the threefold degeneracy of
3d-t$_{2g}$ orbital and d-band narrowing reinforces a relatively less
conducting state thus limiting the $\omega_P$ to lower frequencies. On the
contrary, in case of compressive strain the d-band widening predominates
leading to an increase in carrier concentration and decrease in resistivity
enhancing the metallic state. As a result, $\omega_P$ is increased to higher
frequencies which decreases the optical transparency window. Hence, our results
and findings clearly demonstrate the interdependence between the optical and
transport properties, and provides a detailed mechanism to tune the
optoelectronic properties of SrVO$_3$ for its applications as a transparent
conducting oxide.

Two-dimensional layered electrides possessing anionic excess electrons in the
interstitial spaces between cationic layers have attracted much attention due
to their promising opportunities in both fundamental research and technological
applications. Using first-principles calculations, we predict that the layered
bulk electride Zr2S is nonmagnetic with massive Dirac nodal-line states arising
from Zr-4d cationic and interlayer anionic electrons. However, the Zr2S(001)
surface increases the density of states at the Fermi level caused by the
surface potential, thereby inducing a ferromagnetic order at the outermost Zr
layer via the Stoner instability. Consequently, the time-reversal symmetry
breaking at the surface not only generates highly spin-polarized topological
surface states with intricate helical spin textures, but also hosts an
intrinsic anomalous Hall effect originating from the Berry curvature generated
by spin-orbit coupling. Our findings offer a playground to investigate the
emergence of ferromagnetism and anomalous Hall transport at the surface of
nonmagnetic topological electrides.

<br>
By using observations from pump-probe stroboscopic confocal microscopy and
spectroscopy, we demonstrate the dynamics of trions and the fractional quantum
Hall edge on the order of $\sim1$ ps. The propagation of the quantum Hall edge
state excited by a voltage pulse is detected as a temporal change in
reflectance in the downstream edge probed by optical pulses synchronized with
the voltage pulse. The temporal resolution of such stroboscopic pump-probe
measurements is as fast as the duration time of the probe pulse ($\sim1$ ps).
This ultra-fast stroboscope measurement enables us to distinguish between the
normal mode of edge excitation, known as the edge magneto-plasmon or charge
density wave, and other high-energy non-linear excitations. This is the only
experimental method available to study the ultra-fast dynamics of quantum Hall
edges, and makes it possible to derive the metric tensor $g_{\mu \nu}$ of the
$(1+1)=2$-dimensional curved spacetime in quantum universe and black hole
analogs implemented in the quantum Hall edge.

delta-function effective shell potentials for complex spectra of trapped
polariton modes and calculate corresponding condensation threshold optical
pumping powers. The exhaustive map of condensate quantum number transitions in
the multi-dimensional space of trap parameters, including a cascade of
topological charge increments, is drastically different from the single annular

We investigate the effect of spin orbit coupling on proximity induced
superconductivity in a normal metal attached to a superconductor. Specifically,
we consider a heterostructure where the presence of interfaces gives rise to a
Rashba spin orbit coupling. The properties of the induced superconductivity in
these systems are addressed within the tunneling Hamiltonian formalism. We find
that the spin orbit coupling induces a mixture of singlet and triplet pairing
and, under specific circumstances, an odd frequency, even parity, spin triplet
pairs can arise. We also address the effect of impurity scattering on the
induced pairs, and discuss our results in context of heterostructures
consisting of materials with spin-momentum locking.

<br>
<br>
It has long been known that quantum particles in a periodic lattice exhibit
an oscillatory motion that is solely driven by a constant and uniform force
field. In a strongly biased mesoscopic device, this would appear as an ongoing
time-dependent current oscillation (a Bloch oscillation) but, even when
electrons can move coherently and without scattering, a steady-state regime of
charge transport (a Landauer current) have been seen to quickly emerge. Here,
we theoretically investigate the non-equilibrium current dynamics of a strongly
biased two-terminal mesoscopic device, in order to show that such a system can
exhibit Bloch oscillations as a transient regime that relaxes into a Landauer
steady-state from charge being drained into the leads. Analytical results from
the one-dimensional Wannier-Stark ladder problem are combined with numerical
quantum time-evolution of a tight-binding toy model with finite leads to
characterize the decay times of transient Bloch oscillations and establish the
conditions under which they can occur.

<br>
<br>
Two-level systems (TLS) are rare quantum tunneling defects which govern the
physics of glasses at very low temperature. Because of their extremely low
density, it is very hard to directly identify them in computer simulations of
model glasses. We introduce a machine learning approach to efficiently explore
the potential energy landscape of glass models and identify two-level tunneling
defects. We design an algorithm that is able to rapidly predict the quantum
splitting between any two amorphous configurations produced by classical
simulations. This in turn allows us to shift the computational effort towards
the collection and identification of a larger number of TLS, rather than the
useless characterization of non-tunneling defects which are much more abundant.
Finally, we interpret our machine learning model to understand how TLS are
identified and characterized, thus giving physical insight into the features
responsible for their presence.

We consider an infinite system of particles on a line performing identical

causing the over-damped motion of particles. We investigate fluctuations of the
integrated current and the position of a tagged particle. We show that for $0 <
s < 1$, the standard deviations of both quantities grow as
$t^{\frac{s}{2(1+s)}}$. When $s>1$, the interactions are effectively
short-ranged, and the universal sub-diffusive $t^\frac{1}{4}$ growth emerges
with only amplitude depending on the exponent. We also show that the two-time
correlations of the tagged-particle position have the same form as for
fractional Brownian motion.

A high-current electron source for inverse photoemission spectroscopy (IPES)
is described. The source comprises a thermal cathode electron emission system,
an electrostatic deflector-monochromator, and a lens system for variable
kinetic energy (1.6 - 20 eV) at the target. When scaled to the energy
resolution, the electron current is an order of magnitude higher than that of
previously described electron sources developed in the context of electron
energy loss spectroscopy. Surprisingly, the experimentally measured energy
resolution turned out to be significantly better than calculated by standard
programs, which include the electron-electron repulsion in the continuum
approximation. The achieved currents are also significantly higher than
predicted. We attribute this "inverse Boersch-effect" to a mechanism of
velocity selection in the forward direction by binary electron-electron
collisions.

We demonstrate the possibility of engineering the optical properties of
transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers when one of the constitutive
layers has a Janus structure. This has important consequences for the charge
separation efficiency. We investigate different MoS$_2$@Janus layer
combinations using first-principles methods including electron-hole
interactions (excitons) and exciton-phonon coupling. The direction of the
intrinsic electric field from the Janus layer modifies the electronic band
alignments and, consequently, the energy separation between interlayer exciton
states -- which usually have a very low oscillator strength and hence are
almost dark in absorption -- and bright in-plane excitons. We find that
in-plane lattice vibrations strongly couple the two states, so that
exciton-phonon scattering may be a viable generation mechanism for interlayer
excitons upon light absorption. In particular, in the case of MoS$_2$@WSSe, the
energy separation of the low-lying interlayer exciton from the in-plane exciton
is resonant with the transverse optical phonon modes (40 meV). We thus identify
this heterobilayer as a prime candidate for efficient electron-hole pair
generation with efficient charge carrier separation.

Emergent non-reciprocal interactions violating Newton's third law are
widespread in out-of-equilibrium systems. It has been demonstrated recently
that phase separating mixtures with such non-reciprocal interactions between
components exhibit travelling states that have no equilibrium counterpart.
Using extensive Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate the existence and
stability of such travelling states in the collective dynamics of a generic
non-reciprocal particle system. By varying a broad range of parameters
including aggregate state of the mixture components, diffusivity, degree of
non-reciprocity, effective spatial dimension and density, we determine that
these dynamic travelling states exist only in a relatively narrow region of
parameter space. Our work also sheds light on the physical mechanisms for the
disappearance of travelling states when relevant parameters are being varied.
Our results have implications for a range of non-equilibrium systems including
non-reciprocal phase separating mixtures, non-equilibrium pattern formation and
predator-prey models.

Gauge theories on graphs and networks are attracting increasing attention not
only as approaches to quantum gravity but also as models for performing quantum
computation. We propose a Dirac gauge theory for topological spinors in $3+1$
dimensional networks associated to an arbitrary metric. Topological spinors are
the direct sum of $0$-cochains and $1$-cochains defined on a network and
describe a matter field defined on both nodes and links of a network. Recently
it has been shown that topological spinors obey the topological Dirac equation
driven by the discrete Dirac operator. Here these results are extended by
formulating the Dirac equation on weighted and directed $3+1$ dimensional
networks which allow for the treatment a local theory. The commutators and
anti-commutators of the Dirac operators are non vanishing an they define the
curvature tensor and magnetic field of our theory respectively. This
interpretation is confirmed by the non-relativistic limit of the proposed Dirac
equation. In the non-relativistic limit of the proposed Dirac equation the
sector of the spinor defined on links follows the Schr\"odinger equation with
the correct giromagnetic moment, while the sector of the spinor defined on
nodes follows the Klein-Gordon equation and is not negligible. The action
associated to the proposed field theory comprises of a Dirac action and a
metric action. The Dirac action involves the topological spinor, the metric
action is obtained from the contraction of the curvature tensor and only
involves the metric degrees of freedom of the network. We describe the gauge
invariance of the action under both Abelian and non-Abelian transformations and
we propose the equation of motion of the field theory of both Dirac and metric
fields. This theory can be interpreted as a limiting case of a more general
gauge theory valid on any arbitrary network in the limit of almost flat spaces.

We develop a theory of current-voltage (I-U) characteristics for
superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SNS) junctions. At small voltages
and sufficiently low temperatures the I-U characteristics of the junction is
controlled by the inelastic relaxation time, \tau_{in}. In particular, the
linear conductance is proportional to, \tau_{in}. In this regime the I-U
characteristics can be expressed solely in terms of dependence of the density
of states in the normal region, \nu(\chi), on the phase difference of the order
parameter across the the junction. In contrast, at large voltages the I-U
characteristics of the device is controlled by the elastic relaxation time,
\tau_{el}, which is much smaller than the inelastic one.

<h3>Intertwined Orders and Electronic Structure in Superconducting Vortex  Halos</h3>

We present a comprehensive study of vortex structures in $d$-wave
superconductors from large-scale renormalized mean-field theory of the
square-lattice $t$-$t'$-$J$ model, which has been shown to provide a
quantitative modeling for high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors. With an efficient
implementation of the kernel polynomial method for solving electronic
structures, self-consistent calculations involving up to $10^5$ variational
parameters are performed to investigate the vortex solutions on lattices of up
to $10^4$ sites. By taking into account the strong correlation of the model,
our calculations shed new lights on two puzzling results that have emerged from
recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments. The first concerns the
issue of the zero-biased-conductance peak (ZBCP) at the vortex core for a
uniform $d$-wave superconducting state. Despite its theoretical prediction, the
ZBCP was not observed in most doping range of cuprates except in heavily
over-doped samples at low magnetic field. The second issue is the nature of the
checkerboard charge density waves (CDWs) with a period of about 8 unit cells in
the vortex halo at optimal doping. Although it has been suggested that such
bipartite structure arises from low-energy quasiparticle interference, another
intriguing scenario posits that the checkerboard CDWs originate from an
underlying bidirectional pair-density wave (PDW) ordering with the same period.
We present a coherent interpretation of these experimental results based on
systematic studies of the doping and magnetic field effects on vortex solutions
with and without a checkerboard structure. The mechanism of the emergent
intertwined orders within the vortex halo is also discussed.

The Holstein model is a paradigmatic description of the electron-phonon
interaction, in which electrons couple to local dispersionless phonon modes,
independent of momentum. The model has been shown to host a variety of ordered
ground states such as charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity on
several geometries, including the square, honeycomb, and Lieb lattices. In this
work, we study CDW formation in the Holstein model on the kagome lattice, using
a recently developed hybrid Monte Carlo simulation method. We present evidence
for $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ CDW order at an average electron filling of
$\langle n \rangle =2/3$ per site, with an ordering wavevector at the
$K$-points of the Brillouin zone. We estimate a phase transition occurring at
$T_{c}\approx t/18$, where $t$ is the nearest-neighbor hopping parameter. Our
simulations find no signature of CDW order at other electron fillings or
ordering momenta for temperatures $T \geq t/20$.

The nature of the bulk topological order of the 5/2 non-Abelian fractional
quantum Hall state and the steady-state of its edge are long-standing open
questions. There is more than one candidate compatible with the experimental
findings, namely the anti-Pfaffian (APf) and particle-hole-Pfaffian (PHPf)
states in either full or partial thermal equilibration regimes [Banerjee et al.
Nature 559, 205-210 (2018)]. Previous proposals could only distinguish between
different thermal equilibration regimes of the APf edge [Park et al. PRL 125,
157702 (2020)], or, identify the underlying non-Abelian models, assuming no
edge equilibration [Yutushui et al. PRL 128, 016401 (2022)], a challenging
condition to achieve experimentally. Here we propose a set of dc
current-current correlations (electrical shot noise) that can distinguish among
the Pfaffian, APf and PHPf bulk states as well as between full or partial
thermal equilibration regimes. Our scheme is realizable with the existing
experimental platform.

The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) that arises in the magnetic
systems with broken inversion symmetry plays an essential role in topological
spintronics. Here, by means of atomistic spin calculations, we study an
intriguing type of DMI (g-DMI) that emerges in the films with composition
gradient. We show that both the strength and chirality of g-DMI can be
controlled by the composition gradient even in the disordered system. The
layer-resolved analysis of g-DMI unveils its additive nature inside the bulk
layers and clarifies the linear thickness dependence of g-DMI observed in
experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate the g-DMI induced chiral magnetic
structures, such as spin spirals and skyrmions, and the g-DMI driven field-free
spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching, both of which are crucial towards practical
device application. These results elucidate the underlying mechanisms of g-DMI
and open up a new way to engineer the topological magnetic textures.

<h3>Impedance-matched High-overtone Bulk Acoustic Resonator</h3>

A high-overtone bulk acoustic resonator (HBAR), in which a piezoelectric
transducer is set on an acoustic cavity, has been attracting attention in both
fundamental research and RF applications due to its scalability, high
frequency, and high quality factor. The acoustic impedance matching in HBARs is
crucial for efficient acoustic power transfer from the piezoelectric transducer
to the cavity. However, impedance mismatch remains in most HBARs due to the
metal layer insertion between the piezoelectric layer and cavity substrate. In
this study, we fabricated a nearly impedance-matched high-quality HBAR using an
epitaxial AlN piezoelectric layer directly grown on a conductive SiC cavity
substrate with no metal layer insertion. The small impedance mismatch was
verified from the variation in the free spectral range (FSR), which is
comparable to the best value in previously reported HBARs. The experimentally
obtained FSR spectra was greatly reproduced by using the Mason model. Broadband
phonon cavity modes up to the K-band (26.5 GHz) were achieved by reducing the
thickness of the AlN layer from 800 to 200 nm. The high figure of merit of
$f\times\text{Q} \sim 1.3\times 10^{13}\ \textrm{Hz}$ at 10 GHz was also
obtained. Our nearly impedance-matched high-quality HBAR will enable the
development of RF applications, such as low-phase noise oscillators and
acoustic filters, as well as research on high-frequency acoustic systems
hybridized with electric, optical, and magnetic systems.

We discuss the long time behaviour of a finite energy wave packet in
nonlinear Hamiltonians on infinite lattices at arbitrary dimension, exhibiting
linear Anderson localization. Strong arguments both mathematical and numerical,
suggest for infinite models that small amplitude wave packets may generate
stationary quasiperiodic solutions (KAM tori) almost undistinguishable from
linear wave packets. The probability of this event is non vanishing at small
enough amplitude and goes to unity at amplitude zero. Most other wave packets
(non KAM tori) are chaotic. We discuss the Arnold diffusion conjecture
(recently partially proven) and propose a modified Boltzmann statistics for
wave packets valid in generic models. The consequence is that the probability
that a chaotic wave packet spreads to zero amplitude is zero. It must always
remain focused around one or few chaotic spots which moves randomly over the
whole system and generates subdiffusion.We study a class of Ding Dong models
also generating subdiffusion where the nonlinearities are replaced by hard core
potentials. Then we prove rigorously that spreading is impossible for any
initial wave packet.

The discovery of non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has opened an exciting
direction for unveiling unusual physics and phenomena in non-Hermitian system.
Despite notable theoretical breakthroughs, actual observation of NHSE's whole
evolvement, however, relies mainly on gain medium to provide amplified mode. It
typically impedes the development of simple, robust system. Here, we show that
a passive system is fully capable of supporting the observation of the complete
evolution picture of NHSE, without the need of any gain medium. With a simple
lattice model and acoustic ring resonators, we use complex-frequency excitation
to create virtual gain effect, and experimentally demonstrate that exact NHSE
can persist in a totally passive system during a quasi-stationary stage. This
results in the transient NHSE: passive construction of NHSE in a short time
window. Despite the general energy decay, the localization character of skin
modes can still be clearly witnessed and successfully exploited. Our findings
unveil the importance of excitation in realizing NHSE and paves the way towards
studying the peculiar features of non-Hermitian physics with diverse passive
platforms.

Magnetic skyrmions are localized particle-like nontrivial swirls that are
promising in building high-performance topological spintronic devices. The
read-out functions in skyrmionic devices require the translation of magnetic
skyrmions to electrical signals. Here, we report combined real-space magnetic
imaging and anisotropic magnetoresistance studies on dipolar skyrmions. A
single skyrmion chain and single skyrmion are observed using Lorentz
transmission electron microscopy imaging. Meanwhile, the field, helicity, and
skyrmion count dependence of anisotropic magnetoresistance of the Fe3Sn2
nanostructures are obtained simultaneously. Our results demonstrate that the
anisotropic magnetoresistance of skyrmions is independent of the helicity and
proportional to the skyrmion count. Our work could promote read-out operations
in skyrmion-based spintronic devices.

We investigate the interplay between the non-Hermiticity and finite
temperature in the context of mixed state dynamical quantum phase transition
(MSDQPT). We consider a $p$-wave superconductor model, encompassing complex
hopping and non-Hermiticity that can lead to gapless phases in addition to
gapped phases, to examine the MSDQPT and winding number via the intra-phase
quench. We find that the MSDQPT is always present irrespective of the gap
structure of the underlying phase, however, the profile of Fisher zeros changes
between the above phases. Such occurrences of MSDQPT are in contrast to the
zero-temperature case where DQPT does not take place for the gapped phase.
Surprisingly, the half-integer jumps in winding number at zero-temperature are
washed away for finite temperature in the gapless phase. We study the evolution
of the minimum time required by the system to experience MSDQPT with the
inverse temperature such that gapped and gapless phases can be differentiated.
Our study indicates that the minimum time shows monotonic (non-monotonic)
behavior for the gapped (gapless) phase.

Transition metal dichalcogenides have been the subject of numerous studies
addressing technological applications and fundamental issues. Single-layer
PtSe2 is a semiconductor with a trivial bandgap, in contrast, its counterpart
with 25% of Se atoms substituted by Hg, Pt2HgSe3 (jacutingaite, a naturally
occurring mineral), is a 2D topological insulator with a large bandgap. Based
on ab-initio calculations, we investigate the energetic stability, and the
topological transition in Pt(HgxSe1-x)2 as a function of alloy concentration,
and the distribution of Hg atoms embedded in the PtSe2 host. Our findings
reveal the dependence of the topological phase with respect to the alloy
concentration and robustness with respect distribution of Hg. Through a
combination of our ab-initio results and a defect wave function percolation
model, we estimate the random alloy concentration threshold for the topological
transition to be only 9%. Our results expand the possible search for
non-trivial topological phases in random alloy systems.

Ultracold dilute gases provide ideal settings for measurements of atomic
structure. Helium has an internal structure sufficiently simple to permit
highly accurate predictions of its resonances and transition rates. Precise
laser spectroscopy of helium thus yields empirical constraints on such
calculations. These are desirable in the ongoing investigations seeking to
reconcile the disagreement between independent determinations of nuclear charge
radius data in both hydrogenic and helium atoms. Either the size of these
particles are truly constant and quantum electrodynamics (QED) is flawed, or
the theory is correct and some new physics is at play at the atomic scale.
Ultracold bose gases also serve as ideal testing ground to better understand
the physics of Bose-Einstein condensation, superfluidity, and the effects of
weak interactions in condensed-matter systems. The large internal energy of
helium's metastable excited state enables the measurement of the momentum of
single atoms, providing a new lens through which to examine both
weakly-interacting and strongly-correlated systems. This feature is employed to
investigate the quantum depletion of a BEC after expansion into the far-field.
Finally, the appendix reports on early progress towards the realization of an
optical lattice trap for helium.

Time reversal symmetric topological insulators are generically robust with
respect to weak local interaction, unless symmetry breaking transitions take
place. Using dynamical mean-field theory we solve an interacting model of
quantum spin Hall insulators and show the existence, at intermediate coupling,
of a symmetry breaking transition to a non-topological insulator characterised
by exciton condensation. This transition is of first order. For a larger
interaction strength the insulator evolves into a Mott one. The transition is
continuous if magnetic order is prevented, and notably, for any finite Hund's
exchange it progresses through a Mott localization before the condensate
coherence is lost. We show that the correlated excitonic state corresponds to a
magneto-electric insulator which allows for direct experimental probing.
Finally, we discuss the fate of the helical edge modes across the excitonic
transition.

<br>

Using theory and simulations, we carried out a first systematic
characterization of DNA unzipping via nanopore translocation. Starting from
partially unzipped states, we found three dynamical regimes depending on the
applied force, f: (i) heterogeneous DNA retraction and rezipping (f < 17pN),
(ii) normal (17pN < f < 60pN) and (iii) anomalous (f > 60pN) drift-diffusive
behavior. We show that the normal drift-diffusion regime can be effectively
modelled as a one-dimensional stochastic process in a tilted periodic
potential. We use the theory of stochastic processes to recover the potential
from nonequilibrium unzipping trajectories and show that it corresponds to the
free-energy landscape for single base-pairs unzipping. Applying this general
approach to other single-molecule systems with periodic potentials ought to
yield detailed free-energy landscapes from out-of-equilibrium trajectories.

As nanostructured devices become prevalent, interfaces often play an
important role in thermal transport phenomena. However, interfacial thermal
transport remains poorly understood due to complex physics across a wide range
of length scales from atomistic to microscale. Past studies on interfacial
thermal resistance have focused on interface-phonon scattering at the atomistic
scale but overlooked the complex interplay of phonon-interface and
phonon-phonon scattering at microscale. Here, we use the Peierls-Boltzmann
transport equation to show that the resistance from the phonon-phonon
scattering of non-equilibrium phonons near a Si-Ge interface is much larger
than that directly caused by the interface scattering. We report that
non-equilibrium in phonon distribution leads to significant entropy generation
and thermal resistance upon three-phonon scattering by the Boltzmann's
H-theorem. The physical origin of non-equilibrium phonons in Ge is explained
with the mismatch of phonon dispersion, density-of-states, and group velocity,
which serve as general guidance for estimating the non-equilibrium effect on
interfacial thermal resistance. Our study bridges a gap between atomistic scale
and less studied microscale phenomena, providing comprehensive understanding of
overall interfacial thermal transport and the significant role of phonon-phonon
scattering.

Polypropylene (PP) is a widely used polymer matter, which has many
advantages, such as rich sources, simple synthesis process, small density, low

in the research of polypropylene modified blending, including PP/ABS system,
PP/SBS system, etc. However, the research on PP/AS blend is relatively few, and
the experimental formula range is large, so it is difficult to determine the
optimal ratio. On the basis of previous experiments, this study further
narrowed the proportion range. Through AS modifying PP, the interface physical
effect of maleic anhydride addition on the mechanical properties of the blend
was discussed, and the optimal proportion was found to obtain the modified PP

We study the effect of spin-momentum locking inhomogeneity on the planar Hall
effect in topological insulators (TIs). Using the minimal model describing
surface states of 3D TIs and semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, we have derived
the planar Hall conductivity within the generalized relaxation time
approximation. We have found that the total planar Hall conductivity is a sum
of linear and nonlinear to the external electric field components. The linear
term is a conventional planar Hall conductivity which scales quadratically with
an external magnetic field, whereas the nonlinear term reveals bilinear
behaviour, i.e., changes its sign when either charge current density or
in-plane magnetic field orientation is reversed. We have shown that the
emergent nonlinear planar Hall effect is a consequence of spin-momentum locking
inhomogeneity in the TIs with isotropic energy dispersion and dominates under
the conventional planar Hall effect.

We consider the two-dimensional topological Chern insulator in the presence
of static disorder. Generic quantum states in this system are Anderson
localized. However, topology requires the presence of a subset of critical
states, with diverging localization length (the Chern insulator analog of the
`center of the Landau band states' of the quantum Hall insulator.) We discuss
geometric criteria for the identification of these states at weak disorder, and
their extension into the regime of strong disorder by analytical methods. In
this way, we chart a critical surface embedded in a phase space spanned by
energy, topological control parameter, and disorder strength. Our analytical
predictions are supplemented by a numerical analysis of the position of the
critical states, and their multifractal properties.

Disorder has appeared as one of the main mechanisms to induce topologically
trivial zero-energy states in superconductor-semiconductor systems, thereby
challenging the detection of topological superconductivity and Majorana bound
states. Here we demonstrate that, for disorder in any part of the system, the
formation of disorder-induced trivial zero-energy states can be to a large
extent mitigated by keeping the coupling between semiconductor and
superconductor weak. Furthermore, we find that the topological phase in this
weak coupling regime is robust against disorder, with a large and well-defined
topological gap which is highly beneficial for topological protection. Our work
shows the advantages and disadvantages of weak and strong couplings under
disorder, important towards designing superconductor-semiconductor hybrid
structures.

Data-driven methods, in particular machine learning, can help to speed up the
discovery of new materials by finding hidden patterns in existing data and
using them to identify promising candidate materials. In the case of
superconductors, which are a highly interesting but also a complex class of
materials with many relevant applications, the use of data science tools is to
date slowed down by a lack of accessible data. In this work, we present a new
and publicly available superconductivity dataset ('3DSC'), featuring the
critical temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ of superconducting materials additionally
to tested non-superconductors. In contrast to existing databases such as the
SuperCon database which contains information on the chemical composition, the
3DSC is augmented by the approximate three-dimensional crystal structure of
each material. We perform a statistical analysis and machine learning
experiments to show that access to this structural information improves the
prediction of the critical temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ of materials.
Furthermore, we see the 3DSC not as a finished dataset, but we provide ideas
and directions for further research to improve the 3DSC in multiple ways. We
are confident that this database will be useful in applying state-of-the-art
machine learning methods to eventually find new superconductors.

This paper theoretically investigates the impact of rectangular barrier
potential on the quantum transport properties of silicene field-effect
transistors. In particular, approximate analytical solutions of the Dirac
equation are given to obtain the transmission and reflection probabilities. The
Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism has been implemented in a developed computer
program to compute the conductance in terms of different scattering parameters.
The transport properties of silicene field-effect transistors can be
manipulated by a rectangular barrier. In particular, it is found that the
transmission probability is very sensitive to the barrier height and incident
energy. The results show the occurrence of Klein tunneling and resonant
tunneling, which strongly depend on the barrier width. A rectangular potential
barrier significantly enhances the Klein tunneling effect of Dirac electrons.
In fact, the perfect transmission can occur at a variety of oblique incidence
angles and is not just restricted to normal incidence. Besides, the
transmission profile shows a much more fragmented structure with increasing
barrier width, as occurred in Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonances. On the other hand,
the conductance exhibits a non-monotonic Fermi energy dependence and oscillates
rapidly with increasing barrier height. However, at a fixed value of barrier
height, there is almost no difference among the conductance profiles for a high
Fermi energy value. When the Fermi energy and the barrier height are equal, the
conductance drops to a local minimum. For a thin barrier, the conductance is
significantly reduced, unlike its oscillating behavior for a thicker one. Our
findings demonstrate the development of silicene field-effect transistors and
offer a fresh perspective on the relativistic uses of tunneling in silicene.

The effects associated with exciton Bose condensate formation in strongly
correlated spin crossover systems are considered within the effective
Hamiltonian obtained from the two-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori model. The
collective excitations spectrum at various points of the temperature-crystal
field phase diagram is calculated. The role of the electron-phonon interaction
is discussed. The exciton and magnetic order photoenhancement (induction) in
strongly correlated spin crossover systems a new mechanism based on the
cooperative effect of electron-phonon and interatomic exchange interactions and
the appearance of a massive collective phase mode is demonstrated.

We propose a mechanism for magnon-plasmon coupling and hybridization in
ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) systems. The electric field
associated with plasmon oscillations creates a non-equilibrium spin density via
the inverse spin galvanic effect. This plasmon-induced spin density couples to
magnons by an exchange interaction. The strength of magnon-plasmon coupling
depends on the magneto-electric susceptibility of the system and the wavevector
at which the level repulsion is happened. This wavevector may be tuned by an
applied magnetic field. In AFM systems, the degeneracy of two chiral magnons is
broken in the presence of a magnetic field, and we find two separate hybrid
modes for left-handed and right-handed AFM magnons. Furthermore, we show that
magnon-plasmon coupling in AFM systems is enhanced because of strong
intra-sublattice spin dynamics. We argue that the recently discovered
two-dimensional magnetic systems are ideal platforms to investigate proposed
magnon-plasmon hybrid modes.

We propose a scheme to realize the frustrated spin-1/2 quantum XX model with
ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices. Our approach is based on a square
ladder of magnetic flux close to $\pi$ with one real and one synthetic spin
dimension. Although this system does not have geometrical frustration, we show
that at low energies it maps into an effective triangular ladder with staggered
fluxes for specific values of the synthetic tunneling. We numerically
investigate its rich phase diagram and show that it contains bond-ordered-wave
and chiral superfluid phases. Our scheme gives access to minimal instances of
frustrated magnets without the need for real geometrical frustration, in a
setup of minimal experimental complexity.

<h3>Robust superconductivity and fragile magnetism induced by the strong Cu  impurity scattering in the high-pressure phase of FeSe</h3>

Superconductivity in FeSe is strongly enhanced under applied pressure and it
is proposed to emerge from anomalously coupled structural and magnetic phases.
Small impurities inside the Fe plane can strongly disrupt the pair formation in
FeSe at ambient pressure and can also reveal the interplay between normal and
superconducting phases. Here, we investigate how an impurity inside the Fe
plane induced by the Cu substitution can alter the balance between competing
electronic phases of FeSe at high pressures. In the absence of an applied
magnetic field, at low pressures the nematic and superconducting phases are
suppressed by a similar factor. On the other hand, at high pressures, above 10
kbar, the superconductivity remains unaltered despite the lack of any signature
in transport associated to a magnetic phase in zero-magnetic field. However, by
applying a magnetic field, the resistivity displays an anomaly preceding the
activated behaviour in temperature, assigned to a magnetic anomaly. We find
that the high-pressure superconducting phase of FeSe is robust and remains
enhanced in the presence of Cu impurity, whereas the magnetic phase is not.
This could suggest that high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity has a
sign-preserving order parameter in a presence of a rather glassy magnetic
phase.

We report on the experimental and theoretical studies of optical alignment
and optical orientation effects in an ensemble of core/shell CdSe/CdS colloidal
nanoplatelets. The dependences of three Stokes parameters on the magnetic field
applied in the Faraday geometry are measured under continuous wave resonant
excitation of the exciton photoluminescence. Theoretical model is developed to
take into account both bright and dark exciton states in the case of strong
electron and hole exchange interaction and random in-plane orientation of the
nanoplatelets in ensemble. The data analysis allows us to estimate the time and
energy parameters of the bright and dark excitons. The optical alignment effect
enables identification of the exciton and trion contributions to the
photoluminescence spectrum even in the absence of a clear spectral line
resolution.
