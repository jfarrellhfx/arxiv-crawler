<h3>Freezing density scaling of transport coefficients in the  Weeks-Chandler-Andersen fluid</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16603" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16603</a>
<br>
</p><i>S. A. Khrapak, A. G. Khrapak</i>
<p>It is shown that the transport coefficients (self-diffusion, shear viscosity,
and thermal conductivity) of the Weeks-Chandler-Anderson (WCA) fluid along
isotherms exhibit a freezing density scaling (FDS). The functional form of this
FDS is essentially the same or closely related to those in the Lennard-Jones
fluid, hard-sphere fluid, and some liquefied noble gases. This proves that this
FDS represents a quasi-universal corresponding state principle for simple
classical fluids with steep interactions. Some related aspects such as
Stokes-Einstein relation without a hydrodynamic diameter and gas-to-liquid
dynamical crossover are briefly discussed. Simple fitting formula for the
transport coefficients of the dense WCA fluid are suggested.

<h3>A Generalised Haldane Map from the Matrix Product State Path Integral to  the Critical Theory of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Chain</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16088" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16088</a>
<br>
</p><i>F. Azad, Adam J. McRoberts, Chris Hooley, A. G. Green</i>
<p>We study the $J_1$-$J_2$ spin-$1/2$ chain using a path integral constructed
over matrix product states (MPS). By virtue of its non-trivial entanglement
structure, the MPS ansatz captures the key phases of the model even at a
semi-classical, saddle-point level, and, as a variational state, is in good
agreement with the field theory obtained by abelian bosonisation. Going beyond
the semi-classical level, we show that the MPS ansatz facilitates a
physically-motivated derivation of the field theory of the critical phase: by
carefully taking the continuum limit -- a generalisation of the Haldane map --
we recover from the MPS path integral a field theory with the correct
topological term and emergent $SO(4)$ symmetry, constructively linking the
microscopic states and topological field-theoretic structures. Moreover, the
dimerisation transition is particularly clear in the MPS formulation -- an
explicit dimerisation potential becomes relevant, gapping out the magnetic
fluctuations.

<h3>Manipulating Majorana zero modes in the spin-1/2 Kitaev ladder</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16099" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16099</a>
<br>
</p><i>Haoting Xu, Hae-Young Kee</i>
<p>The one-dimensional $p$-wave superconductor, characterized by boundary
Majorana modes, has attracted significant interest owing to its potential
application in topological quantum computation. Similarly, spin-1/2 Kitaev
ladder systems with bond-dependent Ising interactions, featuring Majorana
fermions coupled with $Z_2$ flux, exhibit boundary Majorana modes when in a
topological phase. However, the ground state degeneracy, inherent in these
systems, may result in the annihilation of Majorana modes due to the
superposition of the two states. To address this issue, we introduce a
projective measurement that selects one of the degenerate $Z_2$ sectors,
enabling the emergence of Majorana modes. Once the state is selected, we show
that the application of the local spin operators on a bond flips the sign of
the adjacent $Z_2$ flux. Repeating such operators enables the system to reach a
desired $Z_2$ flux configuration. We present the phase diagram and the
appearance of Majorana modes at the interfaces of topological and
non-topological phases. These modes, along with boundary Majorana modes, can be
manipulated and fused by tuning the flux sectors achievable through applying
local spin operators. We also discuss the engineering of the Kitaev ladder and
open questions for future studies.

<h3>Boomerang effect in classical stochastic models</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16119" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16119</a>
<br>
</p><i>Santiago Zamora, Lisan M. M. Durão, Flavio Noronha, Tommaso Macrì</i>
<p>The phenomenon of Anderson localization, occurring in a disordered medium,
significantly influences the dynamics of quantum particles. A fascinating
manifestation of this is the "quantum boomerang effect" (QBE), observed when a
quantum particle, propelled with a finite initial velocity, reverses its
average trajectory, eventually halting at its starting point. This effect has
recently been demonstrated in an experiment replicating the quantum
kicked-rotor model. This research delves into the classical analog of QBE. We
uncover evidence of a similar effect in classical systems, characterized by the
absence of typical diffusion processes. Our investigation encompasses both
simplified probabilistic models and more complex phenomenological models that
link classical with quantum mechanics. The results indicate that the boomerang
effect is not confined to the quantum realm and may also be present in diverse
systems exhibiting subdiffusive behavior.

<h3>Mach-Zehnder Interferometer for spin waves: computing applications</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16142" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16142</a>
<br>
</p><i>Kirill A. Rivkin</i>
<p>Interferometers are some of the most important optical devices, yet their
spin wave based analogues so far received limited attention. In this work we
demonstrate how one can design Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) operating on
spin waves, and use to construct a spin wave version of a well known1 MZI based
AI computing device. Modeling, performed both micromagnetically and by using a
novel, finite difference based method, shows that some of the achievable
operational parameters are orders of magnitude superior to both optical and
CMOS based implementations.

<h3>Spectral Density and Sum Rules for Second-Order Response Functions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16144" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16144</a>
<br>
</p><i>Barry Bradlyn, Peter Abbamonte</i>
<p>Sum rules for linear response functions give powerful and
experimentally-relevant relations between frequency moments of response
functions and ground state properties. In particular, renewed interest has been
drawn to optical conductivity and density-density sum rules and their
connection to quantum geometry in topological materials. At the same time,
recent work has also illustrated the connection between quantum geometry and
second-order nonlinear response functions in quantum materials, motivating the
search for exact sum rules for second-order response that can provide
experimental probes and theoretical constraints for geometry and topology in
these systems. Here we begin to address these questions by developing a general
formalism for deriving sum rules for second-order response functions. Using
generalized Kramers-Kronig relations, we show that the second-order Kubo
formula can be expressed in terms of a spectral density that is a sum of Dirac
delta functions in frequency. We show that moments of the spectral density can
be expressed in terms of averages of equal-time commutators, yielding a family
of generalized sum rules; furthermore, these sum rules constrain the
large-frequency asymptotic behavior of the second harmonic generation rate. We
apply our formalism to study generalized $f$-sum rules for the second-order
density-density response function and the longitudinal nonlinear conductivity.
We show that for noninteracting electrons in solids, the generalized $f$-sum
rule can be written entirely in terms of matrix elements of the Bloch
Hamiltonian. Finally, we derive a family of sum rules for rectification
response, determining the large-frequency asymptotic behavior of the
time-independent response to a harmonic perturbation.

<h3>Deep Learning Interatomic Potential Connects Molecular Structural  Ordering to Macroscale Properties of Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) Polymer</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16187" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16187</a>
<br>
</p><i>Rajni Chahal, Michael D. Toomey, Logan T. Kearney, Ada Sedova, Joshua T. Damron, Amit K. Naskar, Santanu Roy</i>
<p>Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is an important commercial polymer, bearing atactic
stereochemistry resulting from nonselective radical polymerization. As such, an
accurate, fundamental understanding of governing interactions among PAN
molecular units are indispensable to advance the design principles of final
products at reduced processability costs. While ab initio molecular dynamics
(AIMD) simulations can provide the necessary accuracy for treating key
interactions in polar polymers such as dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen
bonding, and analyzing their influence on molecular orientation, their
implementation is limited to small molecules only. Herein, we show that the
neural network interatomic potentials (NNIP) that are trained on the
small-scale AIMD data (acquired for oligomers) can be efficiently employed to
examine the structures/properties at large scales (polymers). NNIP provides
critical insight into intra- and interchain hydrogen bonding and dipolar
correlations, and accurately predicts the amorphous bulk PAN structure
validated by modeling the experimental X-ray structure factor. Furthermore, the
NNIP-predicted PAN properties such as density and elastic modulus are in good
agreement with their experimental values. Overall, the trend in the elastic
modulus is found to correlate strongly with the PAN structural orientations
encoded in Hermans orientation factor. This study enables the ability to
predict the structure-property relations for PAN and analogs with sustainable
ab initio accuracy across scales.

<h3>Structural investigation of the quasi-one-dimensional topological  insulator Bi$_4$I$_4$</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16194" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16194</a>
<br>
</p><i>C. David Hinostroza, Leandro Rodrigues de Faria, Gustavo H. Cassemiro, J. Larrea Jiménez, Antonio Jefferson da Silva Machado, Walber H. Brito, Valentina Martelli</i>
<p>The bismuth-halide Bi$_4$I$_4$ undergoes a structural transition around
$T_P\sim 300$K, which separates a high-temperature $\beta$ phase ($T>T_P$) from
a low-temperature $\alpha$ phase ($T<T_P$). $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases are
suggested to host electronic band structures with distinct topological
classifications. Rapid quenching was reported to stabilize a metastable
$\beta$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ at $T<T_P$, making possible a comparative study of the
physical properties of the two phases in the same low-temperature range. In
this work, we present a structural investigation of the Bi$_4$I$_4$ before and
after quenching together with electrical resistivity measurements. We found
that rapid cooling does not consistently lead to a metastable
$\beta$-Bi$_4$I$_4$, and a quick transition to $\alpha$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ is
observed. As a result, the comparison of putative signatures of different
topologies attributed to a specific structural phase should be carefully
considered. The observed phase instability is accompanied by an increase in
iodine vacancies and by a change in the temperature dependence of electrical
resistivity, pointing to native defects as a possible origin of our finding.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the scenario that iodine
vacancies, together with bismuth antisites and interstitials, are among the
defects that are more likely to occur in Bi$_4$I$_4$ during the growth.

<h3>Dirac Impurity in a Luttinger liquid</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Lorenzo Gotta, Thierry Giamarchi</i>
<p>We consider a linearly-dispersing quantum impurity interacting through a
contact density-density term with a one-dimensional (1D) superfluid described
by the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory. Using a linked cluster expansion we
characterize the impurity dynamics by calculating approximate expressions for
the single-particle Green's function and for the time evolution of the density
profile. We show the existence of two different dynamical regimes: (i) a
$\textit{quasiparticle}$ regime, dominated by the presence of a finite lifetime
for the host impurity, and (ii) an $\textit{infrared-dominated}$ regime, where
the impurity causes a Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe of the 1D bath. We
discuss the possible experimental consequences of these findings for cold atoms
experiments.

<h3>Two qubit gate with macroscopic singlet-triplet qubits in synthetic  spin-one chains in InAsP quantum dot nanowires</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16229" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16229</a>
<br>
</p><i>Hassan Allami, Daniel Miravet, Marek Korkusinski, Pawel Hawrylak</i>
<p>We present a theory of a two qubit gate with macroscopic singlet-triplet (ST)
qubits in synthetic spin-one chains in InAsP quantum dot nanowires. The
macroscopic topologically protected singlet-triplet qubits are built with two
spin-half Haldane quasiparticles. The Haldane quasiparticles are hosted by
synthetic spin-one chain realized in chains of InAsP quantum dots embedded in
an InP nanowire, with four electrons each. The quantum dot nanowire is
described by a Hubbard-Kanamori (HK) Hamiltonian derived from an interacting
atomistic model. Using exact diagonalization and Matrix Product States (MPS)
tools, we demonstrate that the low-energy behavior of the HK Hamiltonian is
effectively captured by an antiferromagnetic spin-one chain Hamiltonian. Next
we consider two macroscopic qubits and present a method for creating a tunable
coupling between the two macroscopic qubits by inserting an intermediate
control dot between the two chains. Finally, we propose and demonstrate two
approaches for generating highly accurate two-ST qubit gates : (1) by
controlling the length of each qubit, and (2) by employing different background
magnetic fields for the two qubits.

<br>
</p><i>Carolina Paiva, Michael Fechner, Dominik M. Juraschek</i>
<p>We describe a mechanism by which both ferroelectric polarization and
magnetization can be created in nonpolar, nonmagnetic materials. Using a
combination of phenomenological modeling and first-principles calculations, we
demonstrate that ferroelectric polarization, magnetization, or both
simultaneously can be transiently induced by an ultrashort laser pulse upon
linearly, circularly, or elliptically polarized excitation of phonon modes in
$\gamma$-LiBO$_2$. The direction and magnitude of the multiferroic polarization
can be controlled by the chirality of the laser pulse and the phonon modes,
offering a pathway for controlling multiferroicity and magnetoelectricity on
ultrafast timescales.

<h3>K-core attack, equilibrium K-core, and kinetically constrained spin  system</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Hai-Jun Zhou</i>
<p>Kinetically constrained spin systems are toy models of supercooled liquids
and amorphous solids. In this Perspective, we revisit the prototypical
Fredrickson-Andersen (FA) kinetically constrained model from the viewpoint of
K-core combinatorial optimization. Each kinetic cluster of the FA system,
containing all the mutually visitable microscopic occupation configurations, is
exactly the solution space of a specific instance of the K-core attack problem.
The whole set of different jammed occupation patterns of the FA system is the
configuration space of an equilibrium K-core problem. Based on recent
theoretical results achieved on the K-core attack and equilibrium K-core
problems, we discuss the thermodynamic spin glass phase transitions and the
maximum occupation density of the fully unfrozen FA kinetic cluster, and the
minimum occupation density and extreme vulnerability of the partially frozen
(jammed) kinetic clusters. The equivalence between K-core attack and the fully
unfrozen FA kinetic cluster also implies a new way of sampling K-core attack
solutions.

<p>Previous studies on natural samples of pampaloite (AuSbTe) revealed the
crystal structure of a potentially cleavable and/or exfoliable material, while
studies on natural and synthetic montbrayite (Sb-containing Au$_2$Te$_3$)
claimed various chemical compositions for this low symmetry compound. Few
investigations of synthetic samples have been reported for both materials,
leaving much of their chemical, thermal and electronic characteristics unknown.
Here, we investigate the stability, electronic properties and synthesis of the
gold antimony tellurides AuSbTe and Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$
(montbrayite). Differential thermal analysis and $\textit{in situ}$ powder
x-ray diffraction revealed that AuSbTe is incongruently melting, while
Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ is congruently melting. Calculations of the
band structures and four-point resistivity measurements showed that AuSbTe is a
semiconductor and Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ a metal. Various synthesis
attempts confirmed the limited stable chemical composition of
Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$, identified successful methods to synthesize
both compounds, and highlighted the challenges associated with single crystal
synthesis of AuSbTe.

<h3>Realisation of de Gennes$'$ Absolute Superconducting Switch with a Heavy  Metal Interface</h3>

<p>In 1966, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes proposed a non-volatile mechanism for
switching superconductivity on and off in a magnetic device. This involved a
superconductor (S) sandwiched between ferromagnetic (F) insulators in which the
net magnetic exchange field could be controlled through the
magnetisation-orientation of the F layers. Because superconducting switches are
attractive for a range of applications, extensive studies have been carried out
on $F/S/F$ structures. Although these have demonstrated a sensitivity of the
superconducting critical temperature ($T_{c}$) to parallel (P) and antiparallel
(AP) magnetisation-orientations of the F layers, corresponding shifts in $T_c$
(i.e., ${\Delta}T_c = T_{c,AP} - T_{c,P}$) are lower than predicted with
${\Delta}T_c$ only a small fraction of $T_{c,AP}$, precluding the development
of applications. Here, we report $EuS/Au/Nb/EuS$ structures where EuS is an
insulating ferromagnet, Nb is a superconductor and Au is a heavy metal. For P
magnetisations, the superconducting state in this structure is quenched down to
the lowest measured temperature of 20 mK meaning that ${\Delta}T_c/T_{c,AP}$ is
practically 1. The key to this so-called absolute switching effect is a sizable
spin-mixing conductance at the $EuS/Au$ interface which ensures a robust
magnetic proximity effect, unlocking the potential of $F/S/F$ switches for low
power electronics.

<p>We investigate the effects of a Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beam on the
superconducting state. We show that the vortex angular momentum of a LG beam
affects the superconducting state and induces currents. The induction of the
current by light is illustrated on a Josephson loop and SQUID devices. In
particular, we establish that coupling a dc SQUID to the AC magnetic flux of a
LG beam can stabilize pi phase in the SQUID. This can happen via developing a
global or local minimum in the effective potential at pi. In the latter case,
this happens via the Kapitza mechanism.

<h3>Tuning the electronic and magnetic properties of NiBr$_2$ via pressure</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Soumen Bag, Jesse Kapeghian, Onur Erten, Antia S. Botana</i>
<p>Transition metal dihalides (MX$_2$, M= transition metal, X= halide) have
attracted much attention recently due to their intriguing low-dimensional
magnetic properties. Particular focus has been placed in this family in the
context of multiferroicity -- a common occurrence in MX$_2$ compounds that
adopt non-collinear magnetic structures. One example of helimagnetic
multiferroic material in the dihalide family is represented by NiBr$_2$. Here,
we study the evolution of the electronic structure and magnetic properties of
this material under pressure using first-principles calculations combined with
Monte Carlo simulations. Our results indicate there is significant magnetic
frustration in NiBr$_2$ due to the competing interactions arising from its
underlying triangular lattice. This magnetic frustration increases with
pressure and is at the origin of the helimagnetic order. Further, pressure
causes a sizable increase in the interlayer interactions. Our Monte Carlo
simulations show that a large (3-fold) increase in the helimagnetic transition
temperature can be achieved at pressures of around 15 GPa. This indicates that
hydrostatic pressure can indeed be used as a tuning knob to increase the
magnetic transition temperature of NiBr$_2$.

<h3>Germanium-based hybrid semiconductor-superconductor topological quantum  computing platforms: Disorder effects</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16285" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16285</a>
<br>
</p><i>Katharina Laubscher, Jay D. Sau, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<p>It was recently suggested that proximitized gate-defined Ge hole nanowires
could serve as an alternative materials platform for the realization of
topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Here, we theoretically study the
expected experimental signatures of Ge-based MZMs in tunneling conductance
measurements, taking into account that unintentional random disorder is
unavoidably present in realistic devices. Explicitly, we present numerically
calculated local and nonlocal tunneling conductance spectra (as functions of
bias voltage and magnetic field) for two different wire lengths, two different
disorder models, two different parent superconductors (Al and NbTiN), and
various disorder strengths, which we relate to an estimated lower bound for the
disorder strength in Ge-based hybrid devices that we extract from the
experimentally reported hole mobilities in current state-of-the-art
two-dimensional Ge hole gases. We find that even if the actual disorder
strength in the Ge-based hybrid device exceeds this theoretical lower bound by
an order of magnitude, the system is still in the weak disorder regime, where
the topological superconductivity is intact and the local conductance spectra
manifest clear end-to-end correlated zero-bias peaks if and only if the system
hosts topological end MZMs. This shows that, despite the relatively small
pristine topological gaps ($\sim\,$a few tens of $\mu$eV), Ge-based hybrid
devices are a promising alternative platform for Majorana experiments due to
the extremely high materials quality, which leads to an increased
gap-to-disorder ratio and, therefore, to less ambiguity in the experimental
tunneling conductance data compared to InAs-based devices.

<h3>Identifying the ground state phases by spin-patterns in the  Shastry-Sutherland model</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Yun-Tong Yang, Fu-Zhou Chen, Hong-Gang Luo</i>
<p>Exploring the influence of frustration on the phases and related phase
transitions in condensed matter physics is of fundamental importance in
uncovering the role played by frustration. In the two-dimensional square
lattice, a minimal frustration has been formulated in 1981 as the
Shastry-Sutherland (SS) model described by competitions between the
nearest-neighbor bond ($J_1$) and the next-nearest-neighbor one ($J_2$). In the
two limits of $\alpha=J_2/J_1$, i.e. $\alpha \ll 1$ and $\alpha \gg 1$, the
corresponding phases are the N{\'e}el antiferromagnet (AFM) and the
dimer-singlet(DS). Unfortunately, the intermediate regime remains
controversial, and the nature of transition from the N{\'e}el AFM to the
intermediate state is also unclear. Here we provide a pattern language to
explore the SS model and take the lattice size $L=4 \times4$ with periodic
boundary condition. We firstly diagonalize the Hamiltonian in an operator space
to obtain all fundamental spin-patterns and then analyze their energy and
occupancy evolutions with the frustration parameter $\kappa=\alpha /
(1+\alpha)$. Our results indicate that the intermediate regime is characterized
by diagonal two-domain spin-pattern while the N{\'e}el AFM state has a diagonal
single-domain and the DS has mixings of diagonal single- and four-domain. While
the transition from the DS to the intermediate phase occurred around $\alpha_c
= 1.5$ is the first-order in nature, consistent with that in literature, the
one from the intermediate phase to the AFM is clearly seen around $\alpha_c =
1.277$, where it has a reversal of the contributions from the single- and
two-domain patterns to the ground state. The result indicates that the pattern
language is powerful in identifying the possible phases in frustrated models.

</p><i>Henrik Jacobsen, Marek Barthkowiak, Tobias Weber, Uwe Stuhr, Bertrand Roessli, Christof Niedermayer, Urs Staub</i>
<p>Here we report on an elastic and inelastic neutron scattering study
addressing the effect of electric fields on quantum paraelectric SrTiO3. Our
elastic scattering results find small changes as a function of field in a
superlattice reflection that sample the octahedral rotations, which is
indicative of only weak coupling of octahedral rotation and electric
polarization. By collecting not only the change in gap, but also of the
dispersion, we can better quantify the changes in the lattice dynamics. The
findings are put in context to recent field DFT calculations predicting the
E-field effect on the atomic motions of the lowest lying transverse optical
(soft) mode. We find hints of non-linear coupling to the acoustic mode and to
the phonon with polarization perpendicular to the E-field, which shows the
non-linearity in the chemical potential that is also relevant when strongly
driving SrTiO3 with E-field (THz) pulses.

<h3>Imaging Tunable Luttinger Liquid Systems in van der Waals  Heterostructures</h3>

<p>One-dimensional (1D) interacting electrons are often described as a Luttinger
liquid1-4 having properties that are intrinsically different from Fermi liquids
in higher dimensions5,6. 1D electrons in materials systems exhibit exotic
quantum phenomena that can be tuned by both intra- and inter-1D-chain
electronic interactions, but their experimental characterization can be
challenging. Here we demonstrate that layer-stacking domain walls (DWs) in van
der Waals heterostructures form a broadly tunable Luttinger liquid system
including both isolated and coupled arrays. We have imaged the evolution of DW
Luttinger liquids under different interaction regimes tuned by electron density
using a novel scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) technique. Single DWs at low
carrier density are highly susceptible to Wigner crystallization consistent
with a spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid, while at intermediate densities
dimerized Wigner crystals form due to an enhanced magneto-elastic coupling.
Periodic arrays of DWs exhibit an interplay between intra- and inter-chain
interactions that gives rise to new quantum phases. At low electron densities
inter-chain interactions are dominant and induce a 2D electron crystal composed
of phased-locked 1D Wigner crystal in a staggered configuration. Increased
electron density causes intra-chain fluctuation potentials to dominate, leading

<h3>Does carrier localization affect the anomalous Hall effect?</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16368" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16368</a>
<br>
</p><i>Prasanta Chowdhury, Mohamad Numan, Shuvankar Gupta, Souvik Chatterjee, Saurav Giri, Subham Majumdar</i>
<p>The effect of carrier localization due to electron-electron interaction in
anomalous Hall effect is elusive and there are contradictory results in the
literature. To address the issue, we report here the detailed transport study
including the Hall measurements on $\beta$-Mn type cubic compound
Co$_7$Zn$_7$Mn$_6$ with chiral crystal structure, which lacks global mirror
symmetry. The alloy orders magnetically below $T_c$ = 204 K, and reported to
show spin glass state at low temperature. The longitudinal resistivity
($\rho_{xx}$) shows a pronounced upturn below $T_{min}$ = 75 K, which is found
to be associated with carrier localization due to quantum interference effect.
The upturn in $\rho_{xx}$ shows a $T^{1/2}$ dependence and it is practically
insensitive to the externally applied magnetic field, which indicate that
electron-electron interaction is primarily responsible for the low-$T$ upturn.
The studied sample shows considerable value of anomalous Hall effect below
$T_c$. We found that the localization effect is present in the ordinary Hall
coefficient ($R_0$), but we failed to observe any signature of localization in
the anomalous Hall resistivity or conductivity. The absence of localization
effect in the anomalous Hall effect in Co$_7$Zn$_7$Mn$_6$ may be due to large
carrier density, and it warrants further theoretical investigations,
particularly with systems having broken mirror symmetry.

<h3>Euler band topology in spin-orbit coupled magnetic systems</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Seung Hun Lee, Yuting Qian, Bohm-Jung Yang</i>
<p>The Euler class characterizes the topology of two real bands isolated from
other bands in two-dimensions. Despite various intriguing topological
properties predicted up to now, the candidate real materials hosting electronic
Euler bands are extremely rare. Here, we show that in a quantum spin Hall
insulator with two-fold rotation $C_{2z}$ about the $z$-axis, a pair of bands
with nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant turn into magnetic Euler bands under
in-plane Zeeman field or in-plane ferromagnetic ordering. The resulting
magnetic insulator generally carries a nontrivial second Stiefel-Whitney
invariant. In particular, when the topmost pair of occupied bands carry a
nonzero Euler number, the corresponding magnetic insulator can be called a
magnetic Euler insulator. Moreover, the topological phase transition between a
trivial magnetic insulator and a magnetic Stiefel-Whitney or Euler insulator is
mediated by a stable topological semimetal phase in which Dirac nodes carrying
non-Abelian topological charges exhibit braiding processes across the
transition. Using the first-principles calculations, we propose various
candidate materials hosting magnetic Euler bands. We especially show that
ZrTe$_5$ bilayers under in-plane ferromagnetism are a candidate system for
magnetic Stiefel-Whitney insulators in which the non-Abelian braiding-induced
topological phase transitions can occur under pressure.

<p>Nosocomial infections (NIs) are prevalent in intensive care units due to
antibiotic overuse. Metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs), like ZnO, offer potential
solutions, yet understanding how NPs size impacts their antibacterial efficacy
are lacking. This study focuses on the effect of nanoparticle size on kinetics
of bacterial strains growth. NPs were synthesized using a sol-gel process with
monoethanolamine (MEA) and water, characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD),
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Raman spectroscopy, confirming
crystallization and size variations. ZnO NPs with mean size of 22, 35 and 66 nm
were used against the most common nosocomial bacteria strains Escherichia coli
(Gram-negative), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative), and Staphylococcus
aureus (Gram-positive). The evaluation of NPs minimal inhibitory concentration
(MIC) and bactericidal concentration (MBC) revealed superior antibacterial
activity in smaller NPs. The bacterial population was monitored via optical
absorbance, showing reduced specific growth rate, prolonged latency period, and
increased inhibition percentage with smaller NPs, indicating a substantial
deceleration in the growth of microorganisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited
the smallest sensitivity to ZnO NPs, attributed to its environmental stress
resistance. Furthermore, the antibacterial efficacy of paint containing 1 wt%
of 22 nm ZnO NPs was assessed and displayed activity against E. coli and S.
aureus.

<p>Quasicrystal approximant (CexY1-x)Cd6 (0 < x < 1) forms a network of
corner-sharing octahedra. We report that (Ce0.8Y0.2)Cd6 exhibits an anomalous
magnetic transition which can be classified neither into the conventional
static magnetic ordering nor into spin glasses. The anomalous transition is
characterized by the coexistence of a static order and a frequency-dependent
sharp positive anomaly in the 3rd-harmonic susceptibility. Based on the
investigation of the reference systems CeCd6 and (Ce0.05Y0.95)Cd6, we speculate
that the anomalous transition could be induced by disorder in the possible
frustrated Ce-network in the presence of the Kondo effect.

</p><i>A.S.L. Ribeiro, R. Schott, C. Reichl, W. Dietsche, W. Wegscheider</i>
<p>We observed magnetocapacitance oscillations in InAs/GaSb quantum wells
separated by a $20$\,nm AlSb middle barrier. By realizing independent ohmic
contacts for electrons in InAs and holes in the GaSb layer, we found an
out-of-plane oscillatory response in capacitance representing the density of
states of this system. We were able to tune the charge carrier densities by
applying a DC bias voltage, identifying the formation of beating signatures for
forward bias. The coexistence of two distinguishable two dimensional charge
carrier systems of unequal densities was verified. The corresponding Landau
phase diagram presents distinct features originating from the two observed
densities. A giant Rashba coefficient ranging from $430-612$\,meV$\text{\AA}$
and large \textit{g}-factor value underlines the influence of spin orbit
interaction.

<p>We re-examine the self-phoresis of a particle that releases(removes) pairs of
ions into(from) the electrolyte solution. We show analytically that in the
linear regime the mathematical description of this system maps onto that of the
correlation-induced (self-)chemophoresis (CICP). This connection provides a
unifying perspective of the two phenomena, within which one recovers and
extends recent predictions as particular instances of CICP. Conversely,
ion-phoretic particles are identified as candidates for experimental

<h3>Quantification of 2D Interfaces: Quality of heterostructures, and what  is inside a nanobubble</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16441" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16441</a>
<br>
</p><i>Mainak Mondal, Pawni Manchanda, Soumadeep Saha, Abhishek Jangid, Akshay Singh</i>
<p>Trapped materials at the interfaces of two-dimensional heterostructures (HS)
lead to reduced coupling between the layers, resulting in degraded
optoelectronic performance and device variability. Further, nanobubbles can
form at the interface during transfer or after annealing. The question of what
is inside a nanobubble, i.e. the trapped material, remains unanswered, limiting
the studies and applications of these nanobubble systems. In this work, we
report two key advances. Firstly, we quantify the interface quality using
RAW-format optical imaging, and distinguish between ideal and non-ideal
interfaces. The HS-substrate ratio value is calculated using a transfer matrix
model, and is able to detect the presence of trapped layers. The second key
advance is identification of water as the trapped material inside a nanobubble.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that optical
imaging alone can quantify interface quality, and find the type of trapped
material inside spontaneously formed nanobubbles. We also define a quality
index parameter to quantify the interface quality of HS. Quantitative
measurement of the interface will help answer the question whether annealing is
necessary during HS preparation, and will enable creation of complex HS with
small twist angles. Identification of the trapped materials will pave the way
towards using nanobubbles for novel optical and engineering applications.

<h3>Potential energy surfaces from many-body functionals: analytical  benchmarks and conserving many-body approximations</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Giovanna Lani, Nicola Marzari</i>
<p>We investigate analytically the performance of many-body energy functionals,
derived respectively by Klein and Luttinger and Ward, at different levels of
diagrammatic approximations, ranging from second Born, to GW, to the so-called
T-matrix, for the calculation of total energies and potential energy surfaces.
We benchmark our theoretical results on the extended two-site Hubbard model,
which is analytically solvable and for which several exact properties can be
calculated. Despite its simplicity, this model displays the physics of strongly
correlated electrons: it is prototypical of the H$_2$ dissociation, a
notoriously difficult problem to solve accurately for the majority of
mean-field based approaches. We show that both functionals exhibit good to
excellent variational properties, particularly in the case of the
Luttinger-Ward one, which is in close agreement with fully self-consistent
calculations, and elucidate the relation between the accuracy of the results
and the different input one-body Green's functions. Provided that these are
wisely chosen, we show how the Luttinger-Ward functional can be used as a
computationally inexpensive alternative to fully self-consistent many-body
calculations, without sacrificing the precision of the results obtained.
Furthermore, in virtue of this accuracy, we argue that this functional can also
be used to rank different many-body approximations at different regimes of
electronic correlation, once again bypassing the need for self-consistency.

<h3>From weak to strong-coupling superconductivity tuned by substrate in TiN  films</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Yixin Liu, Zulei Xu, Aobo Yu, Xiaoni Wang, Wei Peng, Yu Wu, Gang Mu, Zhi-Rong Lin</i>
<p>The interplay between substrates and superconducting thin films has attracted
increasing attention. Here, we report an in-depth investigation on
superconducting properties of the epitaxial TiN thin films grown on two
different substrates by dc reactive magnetron sputtering. The TiN films grown
on (0001) sapphire exhibit (111) crystal orientation, while that grown on (100)
Si substrates exhibit (100) orientation. Moreover, the samples grown on Si
reveal a relatively lower level of disorder, accompanied by the higher critical
transition temperature $T_c$ and smaller magnitude of upper critical field
slope near $T_c$. Remarkably, we uncovered a rather high value of
superconducting gap (with $\Delta_0/k_BT_c$ = 3.05) in TiN film on Si
indicating a very strong coupling superconductivity, in sharp contrast to the
case using sapphires as the substrate which reveals a weak-coupling feature.
Further analysis shows that the weakened electronic screening effect due to the
high level of disorder and the suppressed electronic density of states may be
the underlying reasons for the occurrence of weak coupling superconductivity in
the TiN films based on sapphire substrate.

<h3>A finite-time quantum Otto engine with tunnel coupled one-dimensional  Bose gases</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16470" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16470</a>
<br>
</p><i>V.V. Nautiyal, R. S. Watson, K. V. Kheruntsyan</i>
<p>We undertake a theoretical study of a finite-time quantum Otto engine cycle
driven by inter-particle interactions in a weakly interacting one-dimensional
Bose gas in the quasicondensate regime. Utilizing a $c$-field approach, we
simulate the entire Otto cycle, i.e. the two work strokes and the two
equilibration strokes. More specifically, the interaction-induced work strokes
are modelled by treating the working fluid as an isolated quantum many-body
system undergoing unitary evolution. The equilibration strokes, on the other
hand, are modelled by treating the working fluid as an open quantum system
tunnel-coupled to another quasicondensate which acts as either the hot or cold
reservoir, albeit of finite size. We find that, unlike a uniform 1D Bose gas, a
harmonically trapped quasicondensate cannot operate purely as a \emph{heat}
engine; instead, the engine operation is enabled by additional \emph{chemical}
work performed on the working fluid, facilitated by the inflow of particles
from the hot reservoir. The microscopic treatment of dynamics during
equilibration strokes enables us to evaluate the characteristic operational
time scales of this Otto chemical engine, crucial for characterizing its power
output, without any \emph{ad hoc} assumptions about typical thermalization
timescales. We analyse the performance and quantify the figures of merit of the
proposed Otto chemical engine, finding that it offers a favourable trade-off
between efficiency and power output, particularly when the interaction-induced
work strokes are implemented via a sudden quench. We further demonstrate that
in the sudden quench regime, the engine operates with an efficiency close to
the near-adiabatic (near maximum efficiency) limit, while concurrently
achieving maximum power output.

<p>Antiperovskite nitrides are potential candidates for applications harvesting
solar light. With a comprehensive state-of-the-art approach combining hybrid
density-functional theory, many-body perturbation theory, the Wannier-Mott
model, density-functional perturbation theory, and the Feynman polaron model,
we explore excitonic and polaronic effects in X$_3$NA (X: Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, A =
Sb, As). For all of them, we uncover a significant influence of the ionic
dielectric screening on the static dielectric constant. Small exciton binding
energies, weak electron-phonon coupling, and high charge-carrier mobilities
facilitate enhanced charge transport in Mg$_3$NSb, Sr$_3$NSb, and Ba$_3$NSb.
Our results highlight the potential of these nitrides as optimal candidates for
efficient photovoltaic absorbers.

<p>Magnetic adatoms on superconductors give rise to Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR)
states that hold considerable interest for the design of topological
superconductivity. Here, we show that YSR states are also an ideal platform to
engineer structures with intricate wave-function symmetries. We assemble
structures of iron atoms on the quasi-two-dimensional superconductor
$2H$-NbSe$_2$. The Yu-Shiba-Rusinov wave functions of individual atoms extend
over several nanometers enabling hybridization even at large adatom spacing. We
show that the substrate can be exploited to deliberately break symmetries of
the adatom structure in ways unachievable in the gas phase. We highlight this
potential by designing chiral wave functions of triangular adatom structures
confined within a plane. Our results significantly expand the range of
interesting quantum states that can be engineered using arrays of magnetic
adatoms on superconductors.

<p>Recently, MnTe was established as an altermagnetic material that hosts

anomalous Hall effect. In addition to these effects arising from
altermagnetism, MnTe also hosts other magnetoresistance effects. Here, we study
the manipulation of the magnetic order by an applied magnetic field and its
impact on the electrical resistivity. In particular, we establish which
components of anisotropic magnetoresistance are present when the magnetic order
is rotated within the hexagonal basal plane. Our experimental results, which
are in agreement with our symmetry analysis of the magnetotransport components,
showcase the existence of an anisotropic magnetoresistance linked to both the
relative orientation of current and magnetic order, as well as crystal and
magnetic order.

topological properties of such MTI/SC heterostructures upon variation of the
geometry from wide slabs to quasi-1D nanoribbon systems and as a function of
the chemical potential, the magnetic doping, and the induced superconducting
pairing potential. To do so, we construct effective symmetry-constrained
low-energy Hamiltonians accounting for the real-space confinement. For a
nanoribbon geometry with finite width and length, we observe different phases
characterized by CMESs, MBSs, as well as coexisting CMESs and MBSs, as the
chemical potential, the magnetic doping and/or the width are varied.

<h3>Anomalous Directed Percolation on a Dynamic Network using Rydberg  Facilitation</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Daniel Brady, Simon Ohler, Johannes Otterbach, Michael Fleischhauer</i>
<p>The facilitation of Rydberg excitations in a gas of atoms provides an ideal
model system to study epidemic evolution on (dynamic) networks and self
organization of complex systems to the critical point of a non-equilibrium
phase transition. Using Monte-Carlo simulations and a machine learning
algorithm we show that the universality class of this phase transition can be
tuned. The classes include directed percolation (DP), the most common class in
short-range spreading models, and mean-field (MF) behavior, but also different
types of anomalous directed percolation (ADP), characterized by rare long-range
excitation processes. In a frozen gas, ground state atoms that can facilitate
each other form a static network, for which we predict DP universality. Atomic
motion then turns the network into a dynamic one with long-range (Levy-flight
type) excitations. This leads to continuously varying critical exponents
corresponding to the ADP universality class, eventually reaching MF behavior.
These findings also explain the recently observed critical exponent of Rydberg
facilitation in an ultra-cold gas experiment [Helmrich et al., Nature 577, 481
(2020)], which was in between DP and MF values.

<p>Quantitative analysis of microstructural features on the nanoscale, including
precipitates, local chemical orderings (LCOs) or structural defects (e.g.
stacking faults) plays a pivotal role in understanding the mechanical and
physical responses of engineering materials. Atom probe tomography (APT), known
for its exceptional combination of chemical sensitivity and sub-nanometer
resolution, primarily identifies microstructures through compositional
segregations. However, this fails when there is no significant segregation, as
can be the case for LCOs and stacking faults. Here, we introduce a 3D deep
learning approach, AtomNet, designed to process APT point cloud data at the
single-atom level for nanoscale microstructure extraction, simultaneously
considering compositional and structural information. AtomNet is showcased in
segmenting L12-type nanoprecipitates from the matrix in an AlLiMg alloy,
irrespective of crystallographic orientations, which outperforms previous
methods. AtomNet also allows for 3D imaging of L10-type LCOs in an AuCu alloy,
a challenging task for conventional analysis due to their small size and subtle
compositional differences. Finally, we demonstrate the use of AtomNet for
revealing 2D stacking faults in a Co-based superalloy, without any defected
training data, expanding the capabilities of APT for automated exploration of
hidden microstructures. AtomNet pushes the boundaries of APT analysis, and
holds promise in establishing precise quantitative microstructure-property
relationships across a diverse range of metallic materials.

<p>Ultracold quantum gases are usually prepared in conservative traps for
quantum simulation experiments. The atomic density inhomogeneity, together with
the consequent position-dependent energy and time scales of cold atoms in
traditional harmonic traps, makes it difficult to manipulate and detect the
sample at a better level. These problems are partially solved by optical box
traps of blue-detuned hollow beams. However, generating a high-quality hollow
beam with high light efficiency for the box trap is challenging. Here, we
present a scheme that combines the fixed optics, including axicons and prisms,
to pre-shape a Gaussian beam into a hollow beam, with a digital micromirror
device (DMD) to improve the quality of the hollow beam further, providing a
nearly ideal optical potential of various shapes for preparing highly
homogeneous cold atoms. The highest power-law exponent of potential walls can
reach a value over 100, and the light efficiency from a Gaussian to a hollow
beam is also improved compared to direct optical shaping by a mask or a DMD.
Combined with a one-dimensional optical lattice, a nearly ideal two-dimensional
uniform quantum gas with different geometrical boundaries can be prepared for
exploring quantum many-body physics to an unprecedented level.

<p>The Active Matter Evaluation Package (AMEP) is a Python library for analyzing
simulation data of particle-based and continuum simulations. It provides a
powerful and simple interface for handling large data sets and for calculating
and visualizing a broad variety of observables that are relevant to active
matter systems. Examples range from the mean-square displacement and the
structure factor to cluster-size distributions, binder cumulants, and growth
exponents. AMEP is written in pure Python and is based on powerful libraries
such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-image. Computationally expensive
methods are parallelized and optimized to run efficiently on workstations,
laptops, and high-performance computing architectures, and an HDF5-based data
format is used in the backend to store and handle simulation data as well as
analysis results. AMEP provides the first comprehensive framework for analyzing
simulation results of both particle-based and continuum simulations (as well as
experimental data) of active matter systems. In particular, AMEP also allows it
to analyze simulations that combine particle-based and continuum techniques
such as used to study the motion of bacteria in chemical fields or for modeling
particle motion in a flow field. AMEP is available at https://amepproject.de

<h3>Conductivity of lattice bosons at high temperatures</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Ivana Vasić, Jakša Vučičević</i>
<p>Quantum simulations are quickly becoming an indispensable tool for studying
particle transport in correlated lattice models. One of the central topics in
the study of transport is the bad-metal behavior, characterized by the direct
current (dc) resistivity linear in temperature. In the fermionic Hubbard model,
optical conductivity has been studied extensively, and a recent optical lattice
experiment has demonstrated bad metal behavior in qualitative agreement with
theory. Far less is known about transport in the bosonic Hubbard model. We
investigate the conductivity in the Bose-Hubbard model, and focus on the regime
of strong interactions and high-temperatures. We use numerically exact
calculations for small lattice sizes. At weak tunneling, we find multiple peaks
in the optical conductivity that stem from the Hubbard bands present in the
many-body spectrum. This feature slowly washes out as the tunneling rate gets
stronger. At high temperature, we identify a regime of $T$-linear resistivity,
as expected. When the interactions are very strong, the leading
inverse-temperature coefficient in conductivity is proportional to the
tunneling amplitude. As the tunneling becomes stronger, this dependence takes
quadratic form. At very strong coupling and half filling, we identify a
separate linear resistivity regime at lower temperature, corresponding to the
hard-core boson regime. Additionally, we unexpectedly observe that at half
filling, in a big part of the phase diagram, conductivity is an increasing
function of the coupling constant before it saturates at the hard-core-boson
result. We explain this feature based on the analysis of the many-body energy
spectrum and the contributions to conductivity of individual eigenstates of the
system.

<h3>Nucleation transitions in polycontextural networks towards consensus</h3>

</p><i>Johannes Falk, Edwin Eichler, Katja Windt, Marc-Thorsten Hütt</i>
<p>Recently, we proposed polycontextural networks as a model of evolving systems
of interacting beliefs. Here, we present an analysis of the phase transition as
well as the scaling properties. The model contains interacting agents that
strive for consensus, each with only subjective perception. Depending on a
parameter that governs how responsive the agents are to changing their belief
systems the model exhibits a phase transition that mediates between an active
phase where the agents constantly change their beliefs and a frozen phase,
where almost no changes appear. We observe the build-up of convention-aligned
clusters only in the intermediate regime of diverging susceptibility. Here, we
analyze in detail the behavior of polycontextural networks close to this
transition. We provide an analytical estimate of the critical point and show
that the scaling properties and the space-time structure of these clusters show
self-similar behavior. Our results not only contribute to a better
understanding of the emergence of consensus in systems of distributed beliefs
but also show that polycontextural networks are models, motivated by social
systems, where susceptibility -- the sensitivity to change own beliefs --
drives the growth of consensus clusters.

<p>The analysis in the present paper is based on the most known concept
introduced by the brilliant physicist Alexander Andreev: Andreev bound states
in a normal metal sandwiched between two superconductors. The paper presents
results of direct calculations of {\em ab initio} expressions for the currents
in a long ballistic SNS junction. The expressions are expanded in $1/L$ ($L$ is
the thickness of the normal layer). The main contribution $\propto 1/L$ to the
current agrees with the results obtained in the past, but the analysis suggests
a new physical picture of the charge transport through the junction free from
the problem with the charge conservation law. The saw-tooth current-phase
relation at $T=0$ directly follows from the Galilean invariance of the
Bogolyubov-de Gennes equations proved in the paper. The proof is valid for any
variation of the energy gap in space if the Andreev reflection is the only
scattering process. The respective roles of the contributions of bound and
continuum states to the current are clarified. They depend on the junction
dimensionality.

<p>The use of graphene in spintronic devices depend, on its ability to convert a
spin current into an electric charge current. We have systematically
investigated the spin pumping induced spin-to-charge current conversion at the
Graphene/FM interface and the effect of interface modification through high
spin orbit coupling (SOC) material (Pt) as an interlayer (IL) of varying
thicknesses by using broadband FMR spectroscopy. The spin mixing conductance
was enhanced from $1.66 \times 10^{18}$ m$^{-2}$ to $2.72 \times 10^{18}$
m$^{-2}$ where as the spin current density was enhanced from 0.135$\pm $0.003
to 0.242$\pm$0.004 MA/m$^{2}$ at the Graphene/FM interface due to the interface
modification using high SOC material Pt as an interlayer. We observe the value
of spin current to charge current conversion efficiency $\approx
0.292\times10^{-3}$ nm for the Graphene/FM interface. These findings support
the idea that Graphene in contact with high SOC material (Pt) be a potential
candidate for spintronic applications, specifically for spin-torque-based
memory applications.

<h3>Electronic structure, self-doping, and superconducting instability in  the alternating single-layer trilayer stacking nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16600" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16600</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yang Zhang, Ling-Fang Lin, Adriana Moreo, Thomas A. Maier, Elbio Dagotto</i>
<p>Motivated by the recently proposed alternating single-layer trilayer stacking
structure for the nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we comprehensively study this
system using {\it ab initio} and random-phase approximation techniques. Our
analysis unveils similarities between this novel La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ structure
and other Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate superconductors, such as a similar
charge-transfer gap value and orbital-selective behavior of the $e_g$ orbitals.
However, different from other Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate superconductors, we
do not observe any obvious reconstruction of the Fermi surface from ambient
conditions (Cmmm phase) to high pressures (P4/mmm phase). Pressure primarily
increases the bandwidths of the Ni $e_g$ bands, suggesting an enhancement of
the itinerant properties of those $e_g$ states. Furthermore, the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$
orbital also has a layer-selective behavior because the
antibonding-bonding-nonbonding splitting can only be obtained in the trilayer.
In addition, we observe a "self-doping" effect from the trilayer to the
single-layer sublattices and this effect will be enhanced by overall electron
doping. Moreover, we find a leading $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing state that is
restricted to the single-layer. Because the effective coupling between the
single layers is very weak -- due to the non-superconducting trilayer in
between -- this suggests that the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$
in this structure should be much lower than in the bilayer structure.

<h3>Markov generators as non-hermitian supersymmetric quantum Hamiltonians:  spectral properties via bi-orthogonal basis and Singular Value Decompositions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16605" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16605</a>
<br>
</p><i>Cecile Monthus</i>
<p>Continuity equations associated to continuous-time Markov processes can be
considered as Euclidean Schr\"odinger equations, where the non-hermitian
quantum Hamiltonian $\bold{H}={\bold{div}}{\bold J}$ is naturally factorized
into the product of the divergence operator ${\bold {div}}$ and the current
operator ${\bold J}$. For non-equilibrium Markov jump processes in a space of
$N$ configurations with $M$ links and $C=M-(N-1)\geq 1$ independent cycles,
this factorization of the $N \times N$ Hamiltonian ${\bold H}={\bold
I}^{\dagger}{\bold J}$ involves the incidence matrix ${\bold I}$ and the
current matrix ${\bold J}$ of size $M \times N$, so that the supersymmetric
partner ${\hat{\bold H}}= {\bold J}{\bold I}^{\dagger}$ governing the dynamics
of the currents living on the $M$ links is of size $M \times M$. To better
understand the relations between the spectral decompositions of these two
Hamiltonians $\bold{H}={\bold I}^{\dagger}{\bold J}$ and ${\hat {\bold H}}
={\bold J}{\bold I}^{\dagger}$ with respect to their bi-orthogonal basis of
right and left eigenvectors that characterize the relaxation dynamics towards
the steady state and the steady currents, it is useful to analyze the
properties of the Singular Value Decompositions of the two rectangular matrices
${\bold I}$ and ${\bold J} $ of size $M \times N$ and the interpretations in
terms of discrete Helmholtz decompositions. This general framework concerning
Markov jump processes can be adapted to non-equilibrium diffusion processes
governed by Fokker-Planck equations in dimension $d$, where the number $N$ of
configurations, the number $M$ of links and the number $C=M-(N-1)$ of
independent cycles become infinite, while the two matrices ${\bold I}$ and
${\bold J}$ become first-order differential operators acting on scalar
functions to produce vector fields.

<h3>Stochastic Dissipative Euler's equations for a free body</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16613" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16613</a>
<br>
</p><i>J.A. de la Torre, J. Sánchez-Rodríguez, Pep Español</i>
<p>Intrinsic thermal fluctuations within a real solid challenge the rigid body
assumption that is central to Euler's equations for the motion of a free body.
Recently, we have introduced a dissipative and stochastic version of Euler's
equations in a thermodynamically consistent way (European Journal of Mechanics
- A/Solids 103, 105184 (2024)). This framework describes the evolution of both
orientation and shape of a free body, incorporating internal thermal
fluctuations and their concomitant dissipative mechanisms. In the present work,
we demonstrate that, in the absence of angular momentum, the theory predicts
that principal axis unit vectors of a body undergo an anisotropic Brownian
motion on the unit sphere, with the anisotropy arising from the body's varying
moments of inertia. The resulting equilibrium time correlation function of the
principal eigenvectors decays exponentially. This theoretical prediction is
confirmed in molecular dynamics simulations of small bodies. The comparison of
theory and equilibrium MD simulations allow us to measure the orientational
diffusion tensor. We then use this information in the Stochastic Dissipative
Euler's Equations, to describe a non-equilibrium situation of a body spinning
around the unstable intermediate axis. The agreement between theory and
simulations is excellent, offering a validation of the theoretical framework.

<h3>Intrinsic and extrinsic plasmons in the hard x-ray photoelectron spectra  of nearly free electron metals</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16620" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16620</a>
<br>
</p><i>Mohammad Balal, Shuvam Sarkar, Pramod Bhakuni, Andrei Gloskovskii, Aparna Chakrabarti, Sudipta Roy Barman</i>
<p>Collective plasmon excitations in solids that result from the process of
photoemission are an important area of fundamental research. In this study, we
identify a significant number ($n$) of multiple bulk plasmons ($n\omega_p$) in
the hard x-ray photoelectron spectra of the core levels and valence bands (VBs)
of two well-known, nearly free electron metals, aluminum (Al) and magnesium
(Mg). On the basis of earlier theoretical works, we estimate the contributions
of extrinsic, intrinsic, and interference processes to the intensities of 1$s$
to 2$s$ core level plasmons. The intrinsic contribution diminishes from 22% for
1$\omega_p$, to 4.4% for 2$\omega_p$, and becomes negligible thereafter (0.5%
for 3$\omega_p$). The extrinsic and intrinsic plasmon contributions do not vary
significantly across a broad range of photoelectron kinetic energies, and also
between the two metals (Al and Mg). The interference contribution varies from
negative to zero as $n$ increases. An asymmetric line shape is observed for the
bulk plasmons, which is most pronounced for 1$\omega_p$. Signature of the
surface plasmon is detected in normal emission, and it exhibits a significantly
increased intensity in the grazing emission. The VB spectra of Al and Mg, which
are dominated by $s$-like states, exhibit excellent agreement with the
calculated VB based on density functional theory. The VB exhibits four multiple
bulk plasmon peaks in the loss region, which are influenced by an intrinsic
process in addition to the extrinsic process. On a completely oxidized aluminum
surface, the relative intensity of the Al metal bulk plasmon remains nearly
unaltered, while the surface plasmon is completely attenuated.

<h3>The magnetization process of classical Heisenberg magnets with  non-coplanar cuboc ground states</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Johannes Richter, Heinz-Jürgen Schmidt, Jürgen Schnack</i>
<p>We consider a classical Heisenberg model on the kagom\'{e} and the square
kagom\'{e} lattice, where at zero magnetic field non-coplanar cuboctahedral
ground states with twelve sublattices exist if suitable exchange couplings are
introduced between the other neighbors. Such 'cuboc ground states' are
remarkable because they allow for chiral ordering. For these models, we discuss
the magnetization process in an applied magnetic field $H$ by both numerical
and analytical methods. We find some universal properties that are present in
all models. The magnetization curve $M(H)$ usually contains only non-linear
components and there is at least one magnetic field driven phase transition.
Details of the $M(H)$ curve such as the number and characteristics (continuous
or discontinuous) of the phase transitions depend on the lattice and the
details of the exchange between the further neighbors. Typical features of
these magnetization processes can already be derived for a paradigmatic 12 spin
model that we define in this work.

<h3>Observation of intra-unit-cell superconductivity modulation</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Tianheng Wei, Yanzhao Liu, Wei Ren, Ziqiang Wang, Jian Wang</i>
<p>In unconventional high-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors, the
symmetry-breaking electronic orders intertwined with the superconductivity
provide important clues for understanding the nature of the unconventional
pairing mechanism. Recently, an exotic superconducting order showing spatially
periodic order parameter modulations and translational symmetry breaking,
namely the pair density wave (PDW) state, has attracted broad attention.
Without breaking translational symmetry, point group symmetry breaking may also
induce superconductivity modulations on different atom sites within a single
unit cell. However, the intra-unit-cell superconductivity modulation has never
been carefully investigated before. Here, using scanning tunneling
microscopy/spectroscopy, we report the observation of intra-unit-cell
superconductivity modulations in the superconducting gap size and the coherence
peak sharpness in monolayer high-Tc Fe(Te,Se) films epitaxially grown on
SrTiO3(001) substrates. Further analysis shows that the maxima and minima in
the superconductivity modulation are centered at the crystallographic locations
of the Te/Se atoms, revealing the breaking of the glide-mirror symmetry of the
Te/Se atoms in monolayer high-Tc Fe(Te,Se) films grown on SrTiO3(001). Our
findings provide precise microscopic information of superconductivity within
the lattice unit cell and indicate that the p-orbital electrons of the Te/Se
atoms also play an important role in Cooper pairing in unconventional high-Tc
iron-based superconductors.

<h3>Fidelity and criticality in the nonreciprocal Aubry-Andr{é}-Harper  model</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16704" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16704</a>
<br>
</p><i>Chen-Chang Zeng, Zhen Cai, Guang-Heng Wang, Gaoyong Sun</i>
<p>We study the critical behaviors of the ground and first excited states in the
one-dimensional nonreciprocal Aubry-Andr{\'e}-Harper model using both the
self-normal and biorthogonal fidelity susceptibilities. We demonstrate that
fidelity susceptibilities serve as a probe for the phase transition in the
nonreciprocal AAH model. For ground states, characterized by real eigenenergies
across the entire regime, both fidelity susceptibilities near the critical
points scale as $N^{2}$, akin to the Hermitian AAH model. However, for the
first-excited states, where $\mathcal{PT}$ transitions occur, the fidelity
susceptibilities exhibit distinct scaling laws, contingent upon whether the
lattice consists of even or odd sites. For even lattices, the self-normal
fidelity susceptibilities near the critical points continue to scale as
$N^{2}$. For odd lattices, the biorthogonal fidelity susceptibilities diverge,
while the self-normal fidelity susceptibilities exhibit linear behavior,
indicating a novel scaling law.

<h3>Log-normal glide and the formation of misfit dislocation networks in  heteroepitaxial ZnS on GaP</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16714" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16714</a>
<br>
</p><i>Alexandra Fonseca Montenegro, Marzieh Baan, Maryam Ghazisaeidi, Tyler J. Grassman, Roberto C. Myers</i>
<p>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) based electron channeling contrast imaging
(ECCI) is used to observe and quantify misfit dislocation (MD) networks formed
at the heteroepitaxial interface between ZnS and GaP grown by molecular beam
epitaxy (MBE). Below a critical thickness of 15-20 nm, no MDs are observed.
However, crystallographic features with strong dipole contrast, consistent with
unexpanded dislocation half-loops, are observed prior to the formation of
visible interfacial MD segments and any notable strain relaxation. At higher
film thicknesses (20 to 50 nm), interfacial MD lengths increase anisotropically
in the two orthogonal in-plane <110> line directions, threading dislocation
(TD) density increases, and a roughening transition is observed from atomically
smooth two-dimensional (2D) to a multi-stepped three-dimensional (3D)
morphology, providing evidence for step edge pinning via surface terminating
dislocations. The ZnS strain relaxation, calculated from the total MD content
observed via ECCI, matches the average strain relaxation measured by
high-resolution x-ray diffraction (HRXRD). The MD lengths are found to follow a
log-normal distribution, indicating that the combined MD nucleation and TD
glide processes must have a normal distribution of activation energies. The
estimated TD glide velocity ($v_{g}$) along [$\bar{1}$10] is almost twice that
along [110], but in both directions shows a maximum as a function of film
thickness, indicating an initial burst of plasticity followed by dislocation
pinning.

<h3>Superconducting Klein and anti-Klein tunneling in Weyl junctions</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Jiajia Huang, Luyang Wang, Dao-Xin Yao</i>
<p>Klein tunneling is an old topic in relativistic quantum physics, and has been
observed recently in graphene where massless particles reside. Here, we propose
a new heterostructure platform for Klein tunneling to occur, which consists of
a Weyl-semimetal-based normal state/superconductor (NS) junction. By developing
a Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk-like theory, we find that Klein tunneling occurs at
normal incidence, which can lead to differential conductance doubling. If the
(single) Weyl semimeltals are replaced by double Weyl semimetals, anti-Klein
tunneling will take place of Klein tunneling. Our work provides a theoretical
guide for the detection of (anti-)Klein tunneling in three-dimensional chiral
NS junctions.

</p><i>Sebastián E. Deghi, Raúl A. Bustos-Marún</i>
<p>Due to technological needs, nanoscale heat management, energy conversion and
quantum thermodynamics have become key areas of research, putting heat pumps
and nanomotors center stage. The treatment of these particular systems often
requires the use of adiabatic expansions in terms of the frequency of the
external driving or the velocity of some classical degree of freedom. However,
due to the difficulty of getting the expressions, most works have only explored
first-order terms. Despite this, adiabatic expansions have allowed the study of
intriguing phenomena such as adiabatic quantum pumps and motors, or electronic
friction. Here, we use nonequilibrium Green's functions, within a
Schwinger-Keldysh approach, to develop second-order expressions for the energy,
heat, and charge currents. We illustrate, through two simple models, how the
obtained formulas produce physically consistent results, and allow for the
thermodynamic study of unexplored phenomena, such as second-order
monoparametric pumping.

<p>Hydrogen energy is a high-efficiency and clean energy. Large-surface-area,
two-dimensional (2D) layered materials are expected to have an advantage in
hydrogen storage applications. Among a large number of 2D materials, monolayer
dichacogenides have emerged as promising candidate for hydrogen clean energy.
In the present work, first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics
simulations are carried out to investigate the adsorption behaviors of hydrogen
molecules on transition metal dichalcogenides and disulphides. Furthermore we
propose novel structures which may suitable for hydrogen storage. As the
concentration increaes, 2D shows thermodynamic stability even at room

<br>
</p><i>Zheng-Yuan Yue, Zheng-Tao Xu, Shuo Yang, Zheng-Cheng Gu</i>
<p>The physical nature of pseudogap phase is one of the most important and
intriguing problems towards understanding the key mechanism of high temperature
superconductivity in cuprates. Theoretically, the square-lattice $t$-$J$ model
is widely believed to be the simplest toy model that captures the essential
physics of cuprate superconductors. We employ the Grassmann tensor product
state approach to investigate uniform states in the underdoped ($\delta
\lesssim 0.1$) region. In addition to the previously known uniform $d$-wave
state, we discover a strongly fluctuating pair density wave (PDW) state with
wave vector $Q = (\pi, \pi)$. This fluctuating PDW state weakly breaks the
$C_4$ rotational symmetry of the square lattice and has a lower or comparable
energy to the $d$-wave state (depending on doping and the $t/J$ ratio), making
it a promising candidate state for describing the pseudogap phase.

<p>Single-molecule experiments provide insight into the motion (conformational
dynamics) of individual protein molecules. Usually, a well-defined but
coarse-grained intramolecular coordinate is measured and subsequently analysed
with the help of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to deduce the kinetics of protein
conformational changes. Such approaches rely on the assumption that the
microscopic dynamics of the protein evolve according to a Markov-jump process
on some network. However, the manifestation and extent of memory in the
dynamics of the observable strongly depends on the chosen underlying Markov
model, which is generally not known and therefore can lead to
misinterpretations. Here, we combine extensive single-molecule plasmon ruler
experiments on the heat shock protein Hsp90, computer simulations, and theory
to infer and quantify memory in a model-free fashion. Our analysis is based on
the bare definition of non-Markovian behaviour and does not require any
underlying model. In the case of Hsp90 probed by a plasmon ruler, the Markov
assumption is found to be clearly and conclusively violated on timescales up to
roughly 50 s, which corresponds roughly to $\sim$50% of the inferred
correlation time of the signal. The extent of memory is striking and reaches
biologically relevant timescales. This implies that memory effects penetrate
even the slowest observed motions. We provide clear and reproducible guidelines
on how to test for the presence and duration of memory in experimental
single-molecule data.

<p>Bottom-up assembly of nanocrystals (NCs) into ordered arrays, or
superlattices (SLs), is a promising route to design materials with new
functionalities, but the degree of control over assembly into functional
structures remains challenging. Using electrostatics, rather than density, to
tune the interactions between semiconductor NCs, we watch self-assembly
proceeding through a metastable liquid phase. We systematically investigate the
phase behavior as a function of quench conditions in situ and in real time
using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Through quantitative fitting to
colloid, liquid, and SL models, we extract the time evolution of each phase and
the system phase diagram, which we find to be consistent with short-range
attractive interactions. Using the phase diagram's predictive power, we
establish control of the self-assembly rate over three orders of magnitude, and
identify one- and two-step self-assembly regimes, with only the latter
implicating the metastable liquid as an intermediate. Importantly, the presence
of the metastable liquid increases SL formation rates relative to the
equivalent one-step pathway, and SL order counterintuitively increases with the
rate, revealing a highly desirable and generalizable kinetic strategy to
promote and enhance ordered assembly.

<h3>Ordered and disordered stealthy hyperuniform point patterns across  spatial dimensions</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Peter K. Morse, Paul J. Steinhardt, Salvatore Torquato</i>
<p>In previous work [Phys. Rev. X 5, 021020 (2015)], it was shown that stealthy
hyperuniform systems can be regarded as hard spheres in Fourier-space in the
sense that the the structure factor is exactly zero in a spherical region
around the origin in analogy with the pair-correlation function of real-space
hard spheres. In this work, we exploit this correspondence to confirm that the
densest Fourier-space hard-sphere system is that of a Bravais lattice. This is
in contrast to real-space hard-spheres, whose densest configuration is
conjectured to be disordered. We also extend the virial series previously
suggested for disordered stealthy hyperuniform systems to higher dimensions in
order to predict spatial decorrelation as function of dimension. This
prediction is then borne out by numerical simulations of disordered stealthy
hyperuniform ground states in dimensions $d=2$-$8$.

<h3>Optical Phase Aberration Correction with an Ultracold Quantum Gas</h3>

<p>We present an optical aberration correction technique for ultracold quantum
gas experiments which directly utilizes the quantum gas as a wavefront sensor.
The direct use of the quantum gas enables correcting aberrations that are
otherwise impractical to measure, e.g. introduced by vacuum windows. We report
a root-mean-square precision and accuracy of 0.01{\lambda} and 0.03{\lambda},
respectively, and also show independently the reduction of aberrations through
measurement of the trap frequency of our optical tweezer. These improvements
were achieved for a tweezer size that is well below our imaging resolution. The
present work is in particular intended to serve as a tutorial for
experimentalists interested in implementing similar methods in their
experiment.
