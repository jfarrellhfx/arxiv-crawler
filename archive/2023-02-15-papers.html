<h3>Dead or alive: Distinguishing active from passive particles using  supervised learning</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07353" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07353</a>

A longstanding open question in the field of dense disordered matter is how
precisely structure and the dynamics are related to each other. With the advent
of machine learning, it has become possible to agnostically predict the dynamic
propensity of a particle in a dense liquid based on its local structural
environment. Thus far, however, these machine learning studies have focused
almost exclusively on simple liquids composed of passive particles. Here we
consider a mixture of both passive and active (i.e. self-propelled) Brownian
particles, with the aim to identify the active particles from minimal local
structural information. We find that the established machine learning
approaches for passive systems are ineffective for our goal, implying that
dynamic propensity and non-equilibrium activity carry a fundamentally different
structural signature. To distinguish passive from active particles, we instead
develop a pseudo-static machine learning method that uses both local structural
order parameters and their averaged fluctuations as input. Our final neural
network is able to detect with almost 100% accuracy which particles are active
and which ones are not. Hence, our machine learning model can identify distinct
dynamical single-particle properties with minimal dynamical information.
Ultimately, these efforts might also find relevance in the context of
biological active glasses such as confluent cell layers, where subtle changes
in the microstructure can hint at pathological changes in cell dynamics.

Many biomolecular systems can be viewed as ratchets that rectify
environmental noise through measurements and information processing. As
miniaturized robots cross the scale of unicellular organisms, on-board sensing
and feedback open new possibilities for propulsion strategies that exploit
fluctuations rather than fight them. Here, we study extended media in which
many constituents display a feedback control loop between measurement of their
microstates and the capability to bias their noise-induced transitions. We dub
such many body systems informational active matter and show how information
theoretic arguments and kinetic theory derivations yield their macroscopic
properties starting from microscopic agent strategies. These include the
ability to self-propel without applying work and to print patterns whose
resolution improves as noise increases. We support our analytical results with
extensive simulations of a fluid of `thinker' type particles that can
selectively change their diameters to bias scattering transitions. This minimal
model can be regarded as a non-equilibrium analogue of entropic elasticity that
exemplifies the key property of this class of systems: self-propulsive forces
grow ever stronger as environmental noise increases thanks to measurements and
control actions undertaken by the microscopic constituents. We envision
applications of our ideas ranging from noise induced patterning performed by
collections of microrobots to reinforcement learning aided identification of
migration strategies for collections of organisms that exploit turbulent flows
or fluctuating chemotactic fields.

<h3>Ab Initio Predictions of Spin Defects in Simple Oxides</h3>

Simple oxides hold promises as hosts of spin qubits with coherence times tens
of times longer than those measured in diamond and silicon carbide. However, no
suitable spin defect has yet been found in these systems. Using high-throughput
first principles calculations, we predict spin defects in calcium oxide with
electronic properties remarkably similar to those of the NV-center in diamond.
These defects are charged complexes where a dopant atom -- Sb, Bi or I --
occupies the volume vacated by adjacent cation and anion vacancies. We show
that the Bi complex emits in the telecommunication range and the computed
many-body energy levels indicate that an optical cycle required for qubit
initialization can be realized. Our results pave the way to designing quantum
states with long coherence times in simple oxides, which are attractive
materials for quantum technologies.

<h3>Chemical logic gates on active colloids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07670" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07670</a>
<br>
<i>Jiang-Xing Chen, Jia-Qi Hu, Raymond Kapral</i>
<br>
<br>
Synthetic active colloidal systems are being studied extensively because of
the diverse and often unusual phenomena these nonequilibrium systems manifest,
and their potential applications in fields ranging from biology to material
science. Recent studies have shown that active colloidal motors that use
enzymatic reactions for propulsion hold special promise for applications that
require motors to carry out active sensing tasks in complicated biomedical
environments. In such applications it would be desirable to have active
colloids with some capability of computation so that they could act
autonomously to sense their surroundings and alter their own dynamics to
perform specific tasks. Here we describe how small chemical networks that make
use of enzymatic chemical reactions on the colloid surface can be used to
construct motor-based chemical logic gates. Some basic features of coupled
enzymatic reactions that are responsible for propulsion and underlie the
construction and function of chemical gates are described using continuum
theory and molecular simulation. Examples are given that show how colloids with
specific chemical logic gates can perform simple sensing tasks. Due to the
diverse functions of different enzyme gates, operating alone or in circuits,
the work presented here supports the suggestion that synthetic motors using
such gates could be designed to operate in an autonomous way in order to
complete complicated tasks.

<h3>Entropy bound for time reversal markers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07709" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07709</a>
<br>
<i>Gabriel Knotz, Till M. Muenker, Timo Betz, Matthias Kr√ºger</i>
<br>
<br>
Considering positive observables with specific symmetries under path reversal
yields a bound for entropy production, in terms of the deviation of the
observable mean from equilibrium, or, equivalently, in terms of the difference
of the mean measured in forward and backward dynamics. It is fundamentally
different than known relations such as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation.
The bound is met exactly for a two state process. We further exemplify the
relation for a trapped active Brownian particle. This relation is not limited
to Markov chains or specific dynamics.

<h3>Minimum Entropy Production by Microswimmers with Internal Dissipation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07711" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07711</a>
<br>
<i>Abdallah Daddi-Moussa-Ider, Ramin Golestanian, Andrej Vilfan</i>
<br>
<br>
The energy dissipation and entropy production by self-propelled microswimmers
differ profoundly from passive particles pulled by external forces. The
difference extends both to the shape of the flow around the swimmer, as well as
to the internal dissipation of the propulsion mechanism. Here we derive a
general theorem that provides an exact lower bound on the total, external and
internal, dissipation by a microswimmer. The problems that can be solved
include an active surface-propelled droplet, swimmers with an extended
propulsive layer and swimmers with an effective internal dissipation. We apply
the theorem to determine the swimmer shapes that minimize the total dissipation
while keeping the volume constant. Our results show that the entropy production
by active microswimmers is subject to different fundamental limits than the
entropy production by externally driven particles.

<h3>Out-of-equilibrium dynamics of two interacting optically-trapped  particles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07716" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07716</a>
<br>
<i>Victor S Dotsenko, Alberto Imparato, Pascal Viot, Gleb Oshanin</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a theoretical analysis of a non-equilibrium dynamics in a model
system consisting of two particles which move randomly on a plane. The two
particles interact via a harmonic potential, experience their own (independent
from each other) noises characterized by two different temperatures $T_1$ and
$T_2$, and each particle is being held by its own optical tweezer. Such a
system with two particle coupled by hydrodynamic interactions was previously
realised experimentally in B\'erut et al. [EPL {\bf 107}, 60004 (2014)], and
the difference between two temperatures has been achieved by exerting an
additional noise on either of the tweezers. Framing the dynamics in terms of
two coupled over-damped Langevin equations, we show that the system reaches a
non-equilibrium steady-state with non-zero (for $T_1 \neq T_2$) probability
currents that possess non-zero curls. As a consequence, in this system the
particles are continuously spinning around their centers of mass in a
completely synchronised way - the curls of currents at the instantaneous
positions of two particles have the same magnitude and sign. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the components of currents of two particles are strongly
correlated and undergo a rotational motion along closed elliptic orbits.

<h3>Transformation and reconstruction towards two-dimensional atomic  laminates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07718" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07718</a>
<br>
<i>Zhiguo Du, Zongju Cheng, Qi Zhao, Haiyang Wang, Qi Zhu, Hao Chen, Xiao Chen, Bin Li, Shubin Yang</i>
<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials derived from non-van der Waals solids are
promising due to their fantastic physical and chemical properties, but it
remains challenging to obtain 2D atomic laminates with high stability owing to
the strong intrinsic covalent/metallic bonds and highly exposed active surface.
Here, we report a versatile and scalable protocol to produce 2D atomic
laminates, based on an unexpected topological transformation of MAX phases
under hydrogen chloride gas, and/or subsequent reconstruction under some
programmed gases/vapors. In contrast to the known approaches with liquid or
molten medium, our method involves in a gas-phase reaction with fast
thermodynamics for A layers and positive Gibbs free energies for MX slabs.
Remarkably, through subsequent reconstruction in some active gases/vapors (O2,
H2S, P, CH4, Al and Sn metal vapors), a big family of 2D atomic laminates with
elusive configurations as well as high chemical/thermal stabilities and tunable
electrical properties (from metallic to semiconductor-like behaviors) are
achieved. Moreover, the resultant 2D atomic laminates can be facilely scaled up
to 10 kilograms. We believe that the 2D atomic laminates would have broad
applications in catalysis, energy storage, electromagnetic shielding interface
and microwave absorption.

<h3>Superconducting ground state study of valence skip compound AgSnSe$_2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
The valence-skipped superconductors are natural candidates for unconventional
superconductivity, as they can exhibit a negative effective, attractive
interaction for electron-pairing. This work reports comprehensive XRD,
magnetization, specific heat and muon spin rotation and relaxation measurements
($\mu$SR) on a valence-skipped compound: AgSnSe$_2$. The temperature dependence
of the electronic specific heat ($C_{el}(T)$) and of the upper critical field
($H_{c2}(T)$) provide evidence of two-gap superconductivity, which is also
confirmed by our transverse-field $\mu$SR measurements. Our zero-field $\mu$SR
measurements suggest preserved time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting
ground state of AgSnSe$_2$.

<h3>Acoustic phonon contribution to the resistivity of twisted bilayer  graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07275" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07275</a>
<br>
<i>Seth M. Davis, Fengcheng Wu, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<br>
<br>
We calculate the contribution to the doping ($n$) and temperature ($T$)
dependence of the electrical resistivity of twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) due
to scattering by acoustic phonons. Our calculation retains the full
Bistritzer-MacDonald (BM) band structure, with a focus on understanding the
role of the complicated geometric features present in the BM band structure on
electronic transport theory. We find that the band geometry plays an important
role in determining the resistivity, giving an intricate dependence on both $n$
and $T$ that mirrors features in the band structure and complicates the
Bloch-Gr\"{u}neisen (BG) crossover. Our calculations predict pronounced
departures from the standard simplistic expectation of a linear $T$-dependence
above the BG crossover. In particular, we are able to explain the presence of
the resistance peaks that have been observed in experiment, as well as
quantitatively predict the temperatures at which they occur. Our calculated
theoretical results are germane to an ongoing debate over the existence of a
strange metal state in TBLG by providing a quantitatively accurate theory for
the TBLG resistivity at finite temperatures.

<br>
<br>
We present an optical pump-THz emission study on non-collinear
antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn. We show that Mn$_3$Sn acts as a source of THz
radiation when irradiated by femtosecond laser pulses. The polarity and
amplitude of the emitted THz fields can be fully controlled by the polarisation
of optical excitation. We explain the THz emission with the photocurrents
generated via the photon drag effect by combining various experimental
measurements as a function of pump polarisation, magnetic field, and sample
orientation with thorough symmetry analysis of response tensors.

<h3>Omnipresent bound state of two holes in antiferromagnetic Bethe lattices</h3>

For decades, it has remained an open question, whether two dopants in the
$t$-$J$ model binds in the strongly correlated regime of small spin couplings
versus hopping, $J \ll t$. Here, we solve this problem in a Bethe lattice with
Ising coupling $J_z$. We find that the rotationally symmetric $s$ waves unbind
below $J_z \simeq 0.3t$ due to Pauli blocking of symmetrical hole
configurations. Higher rotational $p$ and $d$ waves partially overcome the
blocking, are nearly degenerate, and bind for all $J_z / t$. Around $J_z \simeq
2.4t$, the ground state transitions from $d$ to $p$ wave for decreasing $J_z /
t$, and for $J_z \ll t$ both $p$ and $d$ waves bind sublinearly in $J_z / t$.

<h3>A theoretical perspective on the modification of the magnetocrystalline  anisotropy at molecule-cobalt interfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07330" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07330</a>
<br>
<i>Anita Halder, Sumanta Bhandary, David D. O'Regan, Stefano Sanvito, Andrea Droghetti</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the modification of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) of Co
slabs induced by several different conjugated molecular overlayers, i.e.,
benzene, cyclooctatetraene, naphthalene, pyrene and coronene. We perform
first-principles calculations based on Density Functional Theory and the
magnetic force theorem. Our results indicate that molecular adsorption tends to
favour a perpendicular MCA at surfaces. A detailed analysis of various
atom-resolved quantities, accompanied by an elementary model, demonstrates that
the underlying physical mechanism is related to the metal-molecule interfacial
hybridization and, in particular, to the chemical bonding between the molecular
C $p_z$ and the out-of-plane Co $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. This effect can be
estimated from the orbital magnetic moment of the surface Co atoms, a
microscopic observable accessible to both theory and experiments. As such, we
suggest a way to directly assess the MCA modifications at molecule-decorated
surfaces, overcoming the limitations of experimental studies that rely on fits
of magnetization hysteresis loops. Finally, we also study the interface between
Co and both C$_{60}$ and Alq$_3$, two molecules that find widespread use in
organic spintronics. We show that the modification of the surface Co MCA is
similar upon adsorption of these two molecules, thereby confirming the results
of recent experiments.

<br>
Superfluid helium nanodroplets are an ideal environment for the formation of
metastable, self-organized dopant nanostructures. However, the presence of
vortices often hinders their formation. Here, we demonstrate the generation of
vortex-free helium nanodroplets and explore the size range in which they can be
produced. From x-ray diffraction images of xenon-doped droplets, we identify
that single compact structures, assigned to vortex-free aggregation, prevail up
to $10^8$ atoms per droplet. This finding builds the basis for exploring the
assembly of far-from-equilibrium nanostructures at low temperatures.

<h3>The Stokes-Einstein-Sutherland equation at the nanoscale revisited</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07359" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07359</a>
<br>
<i>Andreas Baer, Simon E. Wawra, Kristina Bielmeier, Maximilian J. Uttinger, David M. Smith, Wolfgang Peukert, Johannes Walter, Ana-Sunƒçana Smith</i>
<br>
<br>
The Stokes-Einstein-Sutherland (SES) equation is at the foundation of
statistical physics, relating a particle's diffusion coefficient and size with
the fluid viscosity, temperature and the boundary condition for the
particle-solvent interface. It is assumed that it relies on the separation of
scales between the particle and the solvent, hence it is expected to break down
for diffusive transport on the molecular scale. However, a number of
experimental studies showed a remarkable small, if any, violation of this
equation down to the size of a nm, where there is no scale separation. To
resolve this puzzle we combine analytical ultracentrifugation experiments and
molecular dynamics simulations to study the transport of buckminsterfullerene
C$_{60}$ suspended in toluene at infinite dilution. We show that this system
clearly violates the conditions of slow momentum relaxation. Yet, through a
linear response to a constant force, we show both in experiments and in
simulations that the SES equation can be recovered in the long time limit with
no more than 4% uncertainty. This nonetheless requires partial slip on the
particle interface, extracted consistently from all the data. Our results,
thus, resolve a long-standing discussion on the validity and limits of the SES
equation at the molecular scale.

<h3>Anisotropy effects on the quantum transport of atomic matter waves</h3>

<br>
<i>Afifa Yedjour, Abdelaali Boudjemaa</i>
<br>
<br>
We discuss effects of anisotropic scattering in transport properties of
ultracold atoms in three-dimensional optical potentials. Within the realm of
the first Born approximation, we calculate the self energy, the scattering mean
free time, the scattering mean free path, and the anisotropy factor. The
behavior of the diffusion constant as a function of the wavenumber is also
examined in diffusive and weak localization regimes. We show that these
quantities are affected by quantum corrections due to the interference caused
by disorder. The dimensionless conductance is also evaluated using the scaling
theory of localization. Our results are compared with previous theoretical and
the experimental results.

Tetralayer graphene has recently become a new addition to the family of
few-layer graphene with versatile electronic properties. This material can be
realised in three distinctive stacking configurations, for which we determine
spectroscopic signatures in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES),
dynamical optical conductivity, and Raman spectra of inter-band excitations.
The reported library of spectral features of tetralayer graphenes can be used
for the non-invasive identification of the stacking order realised in a
particular film.

<h3>Dynamics of polar vortex crystallization</h3>

<br>
<i>Suyash Rijal, Yousra Nahas, Sergei Prokhorenko, Laurent Bellaiche</i>
<br>
<br>
Vortex crystals are commonly observed in ultra-thin ferroelectrics. However,
a clear physical picture of origin of this topological state is currently
lacking. Here, we show that vortex crystallization in ultra-thin
Pb(Zr0.4,Ti0.6)O3 films stems from the softening of a phonon mode and can be
thus described as a SU(2) symmetry-breaking transition. This result sheds light
on the topology of the polar vortex patterns and bridges polar vortices with
smectic phases, spin spirals, and other modulated states. Finally, we predict
an ac-field driven resonant switching of the vortex tube orientation which
could enable new low-power electronic technologies.

<h3>The Second Landau Level Projection of Antiholomorphic Pfaffian  Wavefunctions</h3>

<br>
<br>
We propose a new state described by the second Landau level (SLL) projection
of a generalized Moore-Read Pfaffian wavefunction with an antiholomorphic
pairing component. Unlike the PH-Pfaffian state which is described by the
lowest Landau level (LLL) projection of the same antiholomorphic Pfaffian
wavefunction, we find the proposed state, which we call the SLL PH-Pfaffian,
represents a gapped, incompressible phase, and provides an excellent
description for the exact ground state of finite-size SLL Coulomb-interacting
electrons over a range of the short distance interaction strength. We also find
the SLL PH-Pfaffian, when mapped to the LLL, has a very large overlap and the
same low-energy orbital entanglement spectrum structures with the anti-Pfaffian
state. We discuss possible interpretations of our results on the nature of the
topological order of both states.

Strain is powerful for discovery and manipulation of new phases of matter;
however, the elastic strains accessible to epitaxial films and bulk crystals
are typically limited to small ($<2\%$), uniform, and often discrete values.
This Perspective highlights new directions for strain and strain gradient
engineering in free-standing single crystalline membranes of quantum materials.
Membranes enable large ($\sim 10\%$), continuously tunable strains and strain
gradients via bending and rippling. Moreover, strain gradients break inversion
symmetry to activate polar distortions, ferroelectricity, chiral spin textures,
novel superconductivity, and topological states. Recent advances in membrane
synthesis by remote epitaxy and sacrificial etch layers enable extreme strains
in new materials, including transition metal oxides and Heusler compounds,
compared to natively van der Waals (vdW) materials like graphene. We highlight
new opportunities and challenges for strain and strain gradient engineering in
membranes of non-vdW materials.

<h3>Direct evidence of terahertz emission arising from anomalous Hall effect</h3>

<br>
<br>
A detailed understanding of the different mechanisms being responsible for
terahertz (THz) emission in ferromagnetic (FM) materials will aid in designing
efficient THz emitters. In this report, we present direct evidence of THz
emission from single layer Co$_{0.4}$Fe$_{0.4}$B$_{0.2}$ (CoFeB) FM thin films.
The dominant mechanism being responsible for the THz emission is the anomalous
Hall effect (AHE), which is an effect of a net backflow current in the FM layer
created by the spin-polarized current reflected at the interfaces of the FM
layer. The THz emission from the AHE-based CoFeB emitter is optimized by
varying its thickness, orientation, and pump fluence of the laser beam. Results
from electrical transport measurements show that skew scattering of charge
carriers is responsible for the THz emission in the CoFeB AHE-based THz
emitter.

We report the synthesis and characterization of metal deficient
(Ti$_{0.2}$Zr$_{0.2}$Hf$_{0.2}$Nb$_{0.2}$Ta$_{0.2}$)$_{1-\delta}$B$_{2}$
high-entropy diborides (HEBs). A single homogeneous AlB$_{2}$-type phase is
successfully obtained over the $\delta$ range of 0.03 $\leq$ $\delta$ $\leq$
0.18. With increasing $\delta$, the unit-cell volume exhibits a nonmonotonic
variation with a maximum at $\delta$ = 0.07. These metal-deficient HEBs possess
high Vickers hardness of 16.6-18.9 GPa at a load of 9.8 N and their phase
stability is attributed to the increased mixing entropy. Our results not only
present the first series of metal-deficient AlB$_{2}$-type HEBs, but also
suggest the existence of similar multicomponent diborides.

Despite the spectacular successes, deep neural networks (DNN) with a huge
number of adjustable parameters remain largely black boxes. To shed light on
the hidden layers of DNN, we study supervised learning by a DNN of width $N$
and depth $L$ consisting of perceptrons with $c$ inputs by a statistical
mechanics approach called the teacher-student setting. We consider an ensemble
of student machines that exactly reproduce $M$ sets of $N$ dimensional
input/output relations provided by a teacher machine. We analyze the ensemble
theoretically using a replica method (H. Yoshino (2020)) and numerically
performing greedy Monte Carlo simulations. The replica theory which works on
high dimensional data $N \gg 1$ becomes exact in 'dense limit' $N \gg c \gg 1$
and $M \gg 1$ with fixed $\alpha=M/c$. Both the theory and the simulation
suggest learning by the DNN is quite heterogeneous in the network space:
configurations of the machines are more correlated within the layers closer to
the input/output boundaries while the central region remains much less
correlated due to over-parametrization. Deep enough systems relax faster thanks
to the less correlated central region. Remarkably both the theory and
simulation suggest generalization-ability of the student machines does not
vanish even in the deep limit $L \gg 1$ where the system becomes strongly
over-parametrized. We also consider the impact of effective dimension $D(\leq
N)$ of data by incorporating the hidden manifold model (S. Goldt et al (2020))
into our model. The replica theory implies that the loop corrections to the
dense limit, which reflect correlations between different nodes in the network,
become enhanced by either decreasing the width $\ N$ or decreasing the
effective dimension $D$ of the data. Simulation suggests both leads to
significant improvements in generalization-ability.

TC++ is a free/libre open-source software of the transcorrelated (TC) method
for first-principles calculation of solids. Here, the TC method is one of the
promising wave-function theories that can be applied to periodic systems with
reasonable computational cost and satisfactory accuracy. We present our
implementation of TC++ including a detailed description of the divergence
correction technique applied to the TC effective interactions. We also present
the way to use TC++ and some results of application to simple periodic systems:

Effective field theory models capable of realizing various gapless
topological states are presented in this work. After reviewing the effective
field models of the Weyl and nodal line semimetal states, we study the
competition of these two semimetal states in effective field theories. When the
one form field giving rise to the Weyl nodes lie perpendicular to the plane
where the nodal ring lives, the nodal ring and Weyl nodes could coexist as the
mirror symmetry responsible for the nodal ring is not broken. New phases
including a three-node state and a triple degenerate state exist. The nodal
ring is immediately destroyed when the one form field lies in the plane of the
ring. However, we show that in an eight-component spinor model, Weyl nodes and
nodal rings could still coexist even when the one form field is parallel to the
plane, due to the expanded symmetry. Finally we calculate the topological
invariants in these models and in particular confirm the interesting nontrivial
topology of the three-node state and the triple-degenerate node.

Recently, cold source transistor (CSFET) with steep-slope subthreshold swing
(SS) < 60 mV/decade has been proposed to overcome Boltzmann tyranny in its
ballistic regime. However the scattering, especially by inelastic scattering
may lead serious SS degradation through cold carrier thermalization. In this
study, the electronic excitation/relaxation dynamic process is investigated
theoretically by virtue of the state-of-the-art nonadiabatic molecular dynamics
(NAMD) method, i.e., the mixed quantum-classical NAMD. The mixed
quantum-classical NAMD considers both carrier decoherence and detailed balance
to calculate the cold carrier thermalization and transfer processes in
semiconductor Si, and metallic silicide (NiSi2 and CoSi2). The dependence of
the thermalization factor, relaxation time, scattering time and scattering rate
on energy level are obtained. The thermalization of carrier gradually increases
from low energy to high energy. Partially thermalization from the ground state
to reach the thermionic current window is realized with sub-100 $fs$ time
scale. Fully thermalization to entail energy region depends on the barrier
height sensitively, i.e., the scattering rate decreases exponentially as the
energy of the out-scattering state increase. The scattering rate of NiSi2 and
CoSi2 is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of Si, arising from their
higher density of states than that in Silicon This study can shed light on the
material design for low power tunneling FET as well as the emerging CSFET.

<h3>Non-adiabatic Berry phase for semiconductor heavy holes under the  coexistence of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07436" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07436</a>

<br>
<br>
We formulate the non-Abelian Berry connection (tensor $\mathbb R$) and phase
(matrix $\boldsymbol \Gamma$) for a multiband system and apply them to
semiconductor holes under the coexistence of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit
interactions. For this purpose, we focus on the heavy-mass holes confined in a
SiGe two-dimensional quantum well, whose electronic structure and spin texture
are explored by the extended $\boldsymbol{k}\cdot\boldsymbol{p}$ approach. The
strong intersubband interaction in the valence band causes quasi-degenerate
points except for point $\Gamma$ of the Brillouin zone center. These points
work as the singularity and change the Abelian Berry phase by the quantization
of $\pi$ under the adiabatic process. To explore the influence by the
non-adiabatic process, we perform the contour integral of $\mathbb R$
faithfully along the equi-energy surface by combining the time-dependent
Schr\"{o}dinger equation with the semi-classical equation-of-motion for
cyclotron motion and then calculate the energy dependence of $\boldsymbol
\Gamma$ computationally. In addition to the function as a Dirac-like
singularity, the quasi-degenerate point functions in enhancing the intersubband
transition via the non-adiabatic process. Consequently, the off-diagonal
components generate both in $\mathbb R$ and $\boldsymbol \Gamma$, and the
simple $\pi$-quantization found in the Abelian Berry phase is violated. More
interestingly, these off-diagonal terms cause "resonant repulsion" at the
quasi-degenerate energy and result in the discontinuity in the energy profile
of $\boldsymbol \Gamma$.

Topology plays a crucial role in many physical systems, leading to
interesting states at the surface. The paradigmatic example is the Chern number
defined in the Brillouin zone that leads to the robust gapless edge states.
Here we introduce the reduced Chern number, defined in subregions of the
Brillouin zone (BZ), and construct a family of Chern dartboard insulators
(CDIs) with quantized reduced Chern numbers in the sub-BZ (sBZ) but with
trivial bulk topology. CDIs are protected by mirror symmetries and exhibit
distinct pseudospin textures, including (anti)skyrmions, inside the sBZ. These
CDIs host exotic gapless edge states, such as M\"{o}bius fermions and midgap
corner states, and can be realized in photonic crystals. Our work opens up new
possibilities for exploring sBZ topology and nontrivial surface responses in
topological systems.

<br>
Vortex lines in superconducting Dirac semimetals realize
crystal-symmetry-protected gapless vortex-line phases in which gapless
excitations propagate inside a vortex line, in the presence of appropriate
crystal symmetry, spin-orbit coupling, and multi-band structures. Here we
present a general scheme to classify possible gapless vortex-line phases in
superconducting Dirac semimetals with rotation (or screw) symmetry and
inversion symmetry, assuming that the rotation (screw) axis is parallel to the
vortex line. The rotation (screw)-symmetry-protected gapless modes are stable
as long as they have different rotation (screw) eigenvalues. The underlying
mechanism for the formation of gapless vortex bound states depends on
irreducible representations of rotation (screw) symmetry subject to a vortex
field and is classified into three types: (i) accidental band crossing of two
vortex bound-state modes under rotation symmetry; (ii) accidental and (iii)
enforced band crossing of four vortex bound-state modes under screw symmetry.
We present a tight-binding model of screw-symmetry-protected Dirac semimetal
with an $s$-wave pair potential, demonstrating a gapless vortex-line phase of
type (ii). We obtain four gapless modes of vortex bound states whose gapless
points (Majorana zero modes) pinned at a time-reversal invariant momentum
(TRIM) when the Fermi energy is close to the Dirac points. As the Fermi energy
is moved away from the Dirac points, the four gapless modes are split into a
pair of two gapless modes with vanishing excitation energy at non-TRIMs. In
closing, we discuss Nb$_3$Pt as a candidate material with the four-fold
screw-symmetry-protected Dirac cones that can host a gapless vortex-line phase.

<h3>Computation of forces and stresses in solids: towards accurate  structural optimizations with auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07460" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07460</a>
<br>
<i>Siyuan Chen, Shiwei Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
The accurate computation of forces and other energy derivatives has been a
long-standing challenge for quantum Monte Carlo methods. A number of technical
obstacles contribute to this challenge. We discuss how these obstacles can be
removed with the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) approach. AFQMC is
a general, high-accuracy, many-body total-energy method for molecules and
solids. The implementation of back-propagation for pure estimators allows
direct calculation of gradients of the energy via the Hellmann-Feynman theorem.
A planewave basis with norm-conserving pseudopotentials is used for the study
of periodic bulk materials. Completeness of the planewave basis minimizes the
effect of so-called Pulay terms. The ionic pseudopotentials, which can be
incorporated in AFQMC in exactly the same manner as in standard
independent-electron methods, regulate the force and stress estimators and
eliminate any potential divergence of the Monte Carlo variances. The resulting
approach allows applications of full geometry optimizations in bulk materials.
It also paves the way for many-body computations of the phonon spectrum in
solids.

<h3>Colossal room-temperature electrocaloric strength aided by hydrostatic  pressure in lead-free multiferroic solid solutions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07479" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07479</a>
<br>
<i>C√©sar Men√©ndez, Claudio Cazorla</i>
<br>
<br>
Solid-state cooling applications based on the electrocaloric (EC) effect are
particularly promising from a technological point of view due to their downsize
scalability and natural implementation in circuitry. However, EC effects
typically occur far from room temperature, involve materials that contain toxic
substances and require relatively large electric fields ($\sim 100$-$1000$ kV
cm$^{-1}$) that cause fateful leakage current and dielectric loss problems.
Here, we propose a possible solution to these practical issues that consists in
concertedly applying hydrostatic pressure and electric fields on lead-free
multiferroic materials. We theoretically demonstrate this strategy by
performing first-principles simulations on supertetragonal
BiFe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$O$_{3}$ solid solutions (BFCO). It is shown that
hydrostatic pressure, besides adjusting the occurrence of EC effects to near
room temperature, can reduce enormously the intensity of the driving electric
fields. For pressurized BFCO, we estimate a colossal room-temperature EC
strength, defined like the ratio of the adiabatic EC temperature change by the
applied electric field, of $\sim 1$ K cm kV$^{-1}$, a value that is several
orders of magnitude larger than those routinely measured in uncompressed
ferroelectrics.

BaTiO3 is typically a strong n-type material with tuneable optoelectronic
properties via doping and controlling the synthesis conditions. It has a wide
band gap that can only harness the ultraviolet region of the solar spectrum.
Despite significant progress, achieving visible-light absorbing BTO with
tuneable carrier concentration has been challenging, a crucial requirement for
many applications. In this work, a p-type BTO with visible-light absorption is
realized via iridium doping. Detailed analysis using advanced spectroscopy
tools and computational electronic structure analysis is used to rationalize
the n- to p-type transition after Ir doping. Results offered mechanistic
insight into the interplay between the dopant site occupancy, the dopant
position within the band gap, and the defect chemistry affecting the carrier
concentration. A decrease in the Ti3+ donor levels concentration and the
mutually correlated oxygen vacancies upon Ir doping is attributed to the p-type
behavior. Due to the formation of Ir3+ or Ir4+ in-gap energy levels within the
forbidden region, the optical transition can be elicited from or to such levels
resulting in visible-light absorption. This newly developed Ir-doped BTO can be
a promising p-type perovskite-oxide with imminent applications in solar fuel
generation, spintronics and optoelectronics.

<h3>Dynamics of Rapidly Rotating Bose-Einstein Quantum Droplets</h3>

<br>
The work theoretically investigates the dynamics of trapped rapidly rotating
Bose-Einstein droplets governed by the modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation with
the inclusion of Lee-Huang-Yang nonlinear interaction. Mimicking the quantum
Hall systems, the stationary properties of droplets are obtained by minimizing
the energy functional established based on the Laughlin-like wavefunction
including Landau-Level mixing. By tuning the particle-particle interaction and
rotation speed, the preference of the formation of the center-of-mass state,
vortex state, and off-centered vortex state can be distinguished on the phase
diagram. Under fast rotations, the highly-spiral phase portraits reveal that
the emergence of huge vortices with high angular momentum would stabilize the
droplets against centrifugal depletion. By solving Euler-Lagrange equations,
the periodicity and stability of each phase's breathing and trajectory during
long-time evolution are analyzed. As a signature of superfluids, the generation
of nonuniform persistent currents of multiple topological charges is also a
direct reflection of dynamic breathing induced by the Landau-Level mixing
effect.

Nanothreads are 1D carbon-based nanomaterials produced by pressure-induced
polymerization of multiply unsaturated (and typically aromatic) precursors with
multiple bonds between adjacent precursors. We computationally design
non-covalent interactions between functional groups on thread-forming monomers
to control the relative stabilities of different nanothread backbones. In
particular, functionalized furan or thiophene precursors are identified that
favor nanothreads with oxygen or sulfur atoms arrayed along the same side of
the thread backbone, rather than on alternating sides as currently seen
experimentally for threads formed from unfunctionalized furan or thiophene.
This heteroatom chain provides opportunities for unusual properties arising
from a sterically compressed one-dimensional chain of p orbitals.

We investigate the photon statistics of the light emitted by single
self-assembled hybrid gold-CdSe/CdS/CdZnS colloidal nanocrystal supraparticles
through the detailed analysis of the intensity autocorrelation function
$g^{(2)}(\tau)$. We first reveal that, despite the large number of nanocrystals
involved in the supraparticle emission, antibunching can be observed. We then
present a model based on non-coherent F\"orster energy transfer and Auger
recombination that well captures photon antibunching. Finally, we demonstrate
that some supraparticles exhibit a bunching effect at short time scales
corresponding to coherent collective emission.

<h3>Electrical Breakdown of Excitonic Insulator</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The intrinsic electrical breakdown of normal insulators is usually attributed
to inter-band Zener tunneling. This occurs when the gate voltage reaches the
same level as the bandgap. As a result, the Zener critical field is inversely
proportional to the size of the system. However, when the electrical field is
strong enough to disrupt excitons, an excitonic insulator will also break down,
as its insulation is due to the pairing of free electrons and holes. Unlike the
Zener mechanism, the pair-breaking critical field has little dependence on
system size and has a finite value in the thermodynamic limit. To understand
the relationship between these two mechanisms, a Hartree Fock calculation that
takes into account polarization was performed on a 2D bilayer model. Phase
diagrams were generated as a function of electrical field, system size, and
exciton density. The results showed that, at the large scale (low exciton
density) limit, the breakdown is dominated by Zener tunneling and transitions
smoothly to the pair-breaking case as the system size decreases (exciton
density increases). This provides a straightforward way to distinguish
excitonic insulators from normal insulators.

Heusler compounds have been intensively studied owing to the important
technological advancements that they provide in the field of shape memory,
thermomagnetic energy conversion and spintronics. Many of their intriguing
properties are ultimately governed by their magnetic states and understanding
and possibly tuning them is evidently of utmost importance. In this work we
examine the \alloys alloys with Density Functional Theory simulations and
$^{55}$Mn Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and combine these two methods to carefully
describe their ground state magnetic order. In addition, we compare the results
obtained with the conventional generalized gradient approximation with the ones
of strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) semilocal functionals
for exchange and correlation. Experimental results eventually allow to
discriminate between two different scenarios identified by ab initio
simulations.

We present a temperature-dependent infrared spectroscopy study on the layered
topological semimetal Nb$_3$SiTe$_6$ combined with density-functional theory
(DFT) calculations of the electronic band structure and optical conductivity.
Our results reveal an anisotropic behavior of the in-plane ($ac$-plane) optical
conductivity, with three pronounced excitations located at around 0.15, 0.28,
and 0.41~eV for the polarization of the incident radiation along the $c$ axis.
These excitations are well reproduced in the theoretical spectra. Based on the
\textit{ab initio} results, the excitations around 0.15 eV and 0.28 eV are
interpreted as fingerprints of van Hove singularities in the electronic band
structure and compared to the findings for other topological semimetals.

Li-O$_2$ batteries (LOB) performance degradation ultimately occurs through
the accumulation of discharge products and irreversible clogging of the porous
electrode during the cycling. Electrode binder degradation in the presence of
reduced oxygen species can result in additional coating of the conductive
surface, exacerbating capacity fading. Herein, we establish a facile method to
fabricate free-standing, binder-free electrodes for LOBs in which multi-wall
carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) form cross-linked networks exhibiting high porosity,
conductivity, and flexibility. These electrodes demonstrate high
reproducibility upon cycling in LOBs. After cell death, efficient and
inexpensive methods to wash away the accumulated discharge products are
demonstrated, as reconditioning method. The second life usage of these
electrodes is validated, without noticeable loss of performance. These findings
aim to assist in the development of greener high energy density batteries while
reducing manufacturing and recycling costs.

The coupling of the electron system to lattice vibrations and their
time-dependent control and detection provides unique insight into the
non-equilibrium physics of semiconductors. Here, we investigate the ultrafast
transient response of semiconducting monolayer 2$H$-MoTe$_2$ encapsulated with
$h$BN using broadband optical pump-probe microscopy. The sub-40-fs pump pulse
triggers extremely intense and long-lived coherent oscillations in the spectral
region of the A' and B' exciton resonances, up to $\sim$20% of the maximum
transient signal, due to the displacive excitation of the out-of-plane $A_{1g}$
phonon. Ab-initio calculations reveal a dramatic rearrangement of the optical
absorption of monolayer MoTe$_2$ induced by an out-of-plane stretching and
compression of the crystal lattice, consistent with an $A_{1g}$-type
oscillation. Our results highlight the extreme sensitivity of the optical
properties of monolayer TMDs to small structural modifications and their
manipulation with light.

Living groups move in complex environments and are constantly subject to
external stimuli, predatory attacks and disturbances. An efficient response to
such perturbations is vital to maintain the group's coherence and cohesion.
Perturbations are often local, i.e. they are initially perceived only by few
individuals in the group, but can elicit a global response. This is the case of
starling flocks, that can turn very quickly to evade predators. In this paper,
we investigate the conditions under which a global change of direction can
occur upon local perturbations. Using minimal models of self-propelled
particles, we show that a collective directional response occurs on timescales
that grow with the system size and it is, therefore, a finite-size effect. The
larger the group is, the longer it will take to turn. We also show that global
coherent turns can only take place if i) the mechanism for information
propagation is efficient enough to transmit the local reaction undamped through
the whole group; and if ii) motility is not too strong, to avoid that the
perturbed individual leaves the group before the turn is complete. No
compliance with such conditions results in the group's fragmentation or in a
non-efficient response.

findings may be useful for designing sensitive magnetometers and for other
applications of spin-torque oscillators.

The peculiar defect-related photon emission processes in 2D hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN) have become a topic of intense research due to their potential
applications in quantum information and sensing technologies. Recent efforts
have focused on activating and modulating the defect energy levels in hBN by
methods that can be integrated on a chip, and understanding the underlying
physical mechanism. Here, we report on exotic single photon and enhanced
deep-level emissions in 2D hBN strain superlattice, which is fabricated by
transferring multilayer hBN onto hexagonal close-packed silica spheres on
silica substrate. We realize effective activation of the single photon
emissions (SPEs) in the multilayer hBN at the positions that are in contact
with the apex of the SiO2 spheres. At these points, the local tensile strain
induced blue-shift of the SPE is found to be up to 12 nm. Furthermore, high
spatial resolution cathodoluminescence measurments show remarkable
strain-enhanced deep-level (DL) emissions in the multilayer hBN with the
emission intensity distribution following the periodic hexagonal pattern of the
strain superlattice. The maximum DL emission enhancement is up to 350% with a
energy redshift of 6 nm. Our results provide a simple on-chip compatible method
for activating and tuning the defect-related photon emissions in multilayer
hBN, demonstrating the potential of hBN strain superlattice as a building block
for future on-chip quantum nanophotonic devices.

The strong coupling between photons and matter excitations such as excitons,
phonons, and magnons is of central importance in the study of light-matter
interactions. Bridging the flying and stationary quantum states, the strong
light-matter coupling enables the coherent transmission, storage, and
processing of quantum information, which is essential for building photonic
quantum networks. Over the past few decades, exciton-polaritons have attracted
substantial research interest due to their half-light-half-matter bosonic
nature. Coupling exciton-polaritons with magnetic orders grants access to rich
many-body phenomena, but has been limited by the availability of material
systems that exhibit simultaneous exciton resonances and magnetic ordering.
Here we report magnetically-dressed microcavity exciton-polaritons in the van
der Waals antiferromagnetic (AFM) semiconductor CrSBr coupled to a Tamm plasmon
microcavity. Angle-resolved spectroscopy reveals an exceptionally high
exciton-polariton coupling strength attaining 169 meV, demonstrating
ultrastrong coupling that persists up to room temperature.
Temperature-dependent exciton-polariton spectroscopy senses the magnetic order
change from AFM to paramagnetism in CrSBr, confirming its magnetic nature. By
applying an out-of-plane magnetic field, an effective tuning of the polariton
energy is further achieved while maintaining the ultrastrong exciton-photon
coupling strength, which is attributed to the spin canting process that
modulates the interlayer exciton interaction. Our work proposes a hybrid
quantum platform enabled by robust opto-electronic-magnetic coupling, promising
for quantum interconnects and transducers.

Very important research, with both theoretical and experimental results in
the advancement of physical models that explain the MR effect, try to keep the
MRF formulation as simple as possible, usually with only two components: a
magnetic dispersed phase and a carrier liquid. Many patents of MRF include
three or four components, such as some surfactant and thixotropic additives. In
order to formulate a good and reliable MRF for different applications such as
MR shock absorbers, clutches, brakes, the MRF redispersibility is a challenge,
but mandatory, key property for out of lab real world applications. This
chapter, we shows how to measure and evaluate the MRF redispersibility.

Electric-field control of magnetism via inverse magnetostrictive effect is an
efficient path towards improving energy-efficient storage and sensing devices
based on giant magnetoresistance effect. In this letter, we report on lateral
electric-field driven strain-mediated modulation of magnetic properties in
Co$/$Cu$/$Py pseudo spin valve grown on ferroelectric PMN-PT substrate. We show
a decrease of the giant magnetoresistance ratio of the pseudo spin valve with
increasing electric field, which is attributed to the deviation of the Co layer
magnetization from the initial direction due to strain-induced magnetoelastic
anisotropy contribution. Additionally, we demonstrate that strain-induced
magnetic anisotropy effectively shifts the switching field of the
magnetostrictive Co layer, while keeping the switching field of the nearly
zero-magnetostrictive Py layer unaffected due to its negligible
magnetostriction constant. We argue that magnetostrictively optimized magnetic
films in properly engineered multilayered structures can offer a path to
enhancing the selective magnetic switching in spintronic devices.

<h3>Incorporating Ion-Specific van der Waals and Soft Repulsive Interactions  in the Poisson-Boltzmann Theory of Electrical Double Layers</h3>

Electrical double layers (EDLs) arise when an electrolyte is in contact with
a charged surface, and are encountered in several application areas including
batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalytic reactors, and colloids. In the
modeling of EDLs, a prominent knowledge gap has been the exclusion of van der
Waals (vdW) and soft repulsive interactions in modified Poisson-Boltzmann (PB)
theories. Although more short-ranged as compared to electrostatic interactions,
we show here that vdW interactions can play an important role in determining
the structure of the EDL via the formation of a Stern layer and in modulating
the differential capacitance of an electrode in solution. To this end, we
incorporate ion-ion and wall-ion vdW attraction and soft repulsion via a 12-6
Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, resulting in a modified PB-LJ approach. The
wall-ion LJ interactions were found to have a significant effect on the
electrical potential and concentration profiles, especially close to the wall.
However, ion-ion LJ interactions do not affect the EDL structure at low bulk
ion concentrations (< 1 M). We also derive dimensionless numbers to quantify
the impact of ion-ion and wall-ion LJ interactions on the EDL. Furthermore, in
the pursuit of capturing ion-specific effects, we apply our model by
considering various combinations of ions. We observe how varying parameters
such as the electrolyte concentration and electrode potential affect the
structure of the EDL due to the competition between ion-specific LJ and
electrostatic interactions. Lastly, we show that the inclusion of vdW and soft
repulsion interactions as well as hydration effects lead to a better
qualitative agreement of the PB models with experimental double-layer
differential capacitance data. Overall, the modified PB-LJ approach presented
herein will lead to more accurate theoretical descriptions of EDLs in various
application areas.

We study symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase transitions induced by
stacking two gapped one-dimensional subsystems in BDI symmetry class. The
topological invariant of the entire system is a sum of three topological
invariants: two from each subsystem and an emerging topological invariant from
the stacking. We find that any symmetry-preserving stacking of topologically
trivial subsystems can drive the entire system into a topologically nontrivial
phase. We explain this intriguing SPT phase transitions by conditions set by
orbital degrees of freedom and time-reversal symmetry. To exemplify the SPT
transition, we provide a concrete model which consists of an atomic chain and a
spinful nanowire with spin-orbit interaction and $s$-wave superconducting
order. The stacking-induced SPT transition drives this heterostructure into a
zero-field topological superconducting phase.

The electronic properties of the surface of $\beta$-FeSi$_2$ have been
debated for a long while. We studied the surface states of $\beta$-FeSi$_2$
films grown on Si(001) substrates using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM)
and spectroscopy (STS), with the aid of density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. STM simulations using the surface model proposed by Romanyuk et
al. [Phys. Rev. B 90, 155305 (2014)] reproduce the detailed features of
experimental STM images. The result of STS showed metallic surface states in
accordance with theoretical predictions. The Fermi level was pinned by a
surface state that appeared in the bulk band gap of the $\beta$-FeSi$_2$ film,
irrespective of the polarity of the substrate. We also observed negative
differential conductance at $\sim$0.45 eV above the Fermi level in STS
measurements performed at 4.5 K, reflecting the presence of an energy gap in
the unoccupied surface states of $\beta$-FeSi$_2$.

<h3>Intersubband Transitions in Lead Halide Perovskite-Based Quantum Wells  for Mid-Infrared Detectors</h3>

<br>
<br>
Due to their excellent optical and electrical properties as well as versatile
growth and fabrication processes, lead halide perovskites have been widely
considered as promising candidates for green energy and opto-electronic related
applications. Here, we investigate their potential applications at infrared
wavelengths by modeling the intersubband transitions in lead halide
perovskite-based quantum well systems. Both single-well and double-well
structures are studied and their energy levels as well as the corresponding
wavefunctions and intersubband transition energies are calculated by solving
the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equations. By adjusting the quantum well and
barrier thicknesses, we are able to tune the intersubband transition energies
to cover a broad range of infrared wavelengths. We also find that the
lead-halide perovskite-based quantum wells possess high absorption
coefficients, which are beneficial for their potential applications in infrared
photodetectors. The widely tunable transition energies and high absorption
coefficients of the perovskite-based quantum well systems, combined with their
unique material and electrical properties, may enable an alternative material
system for the development of infrared photodetectors.

<h3>Spin-strain coupling in nanodiamonds</h3>

Fluorescent nanodiamonds have been used to a large extent in various
biological systems due to their robust nature, inert properties and the
relative ease of modifying their surface for attachment to different functional
groups. Within a given batch, however, each nanodiamond is indistinguishable
from its neighbors and so far one could only rely on fluorescence statistics
for some global information about the ensemble. Here, we propose and measure
the possibility of adding another layer of unique information, relying on the
coupling between the strain in the nanodiamond and the spin degree-of-freedom
in the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. We show that the large variance in
axial and transverse strain can be encoded to an individual radio-frequency
identity for a cluster of nanodiamonds. When using single nanodiamonds, this
unique fingerprint can then be potentially tracked in real-time in, e.g.,
cells, as their size is compatible with metabolism intake. From a completely
different aspect, in clusters of nanodiamonds, this can already now serve as a
platform for anti-counterfeiting measures.

<h3>Quasi-one-dimensional harmonically trapped quantum droplets</h3>

We theoretically consider effectively one-dimensional quantum droplets in a
symmetric Bose-Bose mixture confined in a parabolic trap. We systematically
investigate ground and excited families of localized trapped modes which
bifurcate from eigenstates of quantum harmonic oscillator. Families of
nonlinear modes have nonmonotonous behavior of chemical potential on number of
particles and feature bistability regions. Excited states are unstable close to
the linear limit, but become stable as the number of particles increases. In
the limit of large density, we derive a modified Thomas-Fermi distribution.
Decrease of the trapping strength dynamically transforms the ground state
solution to the solitonlike quantum droplet.

<h3>Metal-bonded Atomic Layers of Transition Metal Carbides (MXenes)</h3>

<br>
<br>
Although two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) have
fantastic physical and chemical properties as well as wide applications, it
remains challenging to produce stable MXenes due to their rapid structural
degradation. Here, unique metal-bonded atomic layers of transition metal
carbides with high stabilities are produced via a simple topological reaction
between chlorine-terminated MXenes and selected metals, where the metals enable
to not only remove Cl terminations, but also efficiently bond with adjacent
atomic MXene slabs, driven by the symmetry of MAX phases. The films constructed
from Al-bonded Ti$_3$C$_2$Cl$_x$ atomic layers show high oxidation resistance
up to 400 degrees centigrade and low sheet resistance of 9.3 ohm per square.
Coupled to the multi-layer structure, the Al-bonded Ti$_3$C$_2$Cl$_x$ film
displays a significantly improved EMI shielding capability with a total
shielding effectiveness value of 39 dB at a low thickness of 3.1 micron,
outperforming pure Ti$_3$C$_2$Cl$_x$ film.

<h3>Approximate SU(4) spin models on triangular and honeycomb lattices in  twisted AB-Stacked WSe$_2$ homo-bilayer</h3>

<br>
<i>Shuchen Zhang, Boran Zhou, Ya-Hui Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, we derive lattice models for the narrow moir\'e bands of the
AB-stacked twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayer through continuum model and Wannier
orbital construction. Previous work has shown that an approximate SU(4) Hubbard
model may be realized by combining spin and layer because inter-layer tunneling
is suppressed due to spin $S_z$ conservation. However, Rashba spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) was ignored in the previous analysis. Here, we show that a
Rashba SOC of reasonable magnitude can induce a finite but very small
inter-layer hopping in the final lattice Hubbard model. At total filling $n=1$,
we derive a spin-layer model on a triangular lattice in the large-U limit where
the inter-layer tunneling contributes as a sublattice-dependent transverse
Ising field for the layer pseudospin. We then show that the $n=2$ Mott
insulator is also captured by an approximate SU(4) spin model, but now on
honeycomb lattice. We comment on the possibility of a Dirac spin liquid (DSL)
and competing phases due to SU(4) anisotropy terms.

<h3>Effects of the Vertices on the Topological Bound States in a  Quasicrystalline Topological Insulator</h3>

<br>

The experimental realization of twisted bilayer graphene strongly pushed the
inspection of bilayer systems. In this context, it was recently shown that a
two layer Haldane model with a thirty degree rotation angle between the layers
represents a higher order topological insulator, with zero-dimensional states
isolated in energy and localized at the physical vertices of the nanostructure.
We show, within a numerical tight binding approach, that the energy of the zero
dimensional states strongly depends on the geometrical structure of the
vertices. In the most extreme cases, once a specific band gap is considered,
these bound states can even disappear just by changing the vertex structure.

<h3>koopmans: an open-source package for accurately and efficiently  predicting spectral properties with Koopmans functionals</h3>

<br>
<br>
Over the past decade we have developed Koopmans functionals, a
computationally efficient approach for predicting spectral properties with an
orbital-density-dependent functional formulation. These functionals address two
fundamental issues with density functional theory (DFT). First, while Kohn-Sham
eigenvalues can loosely mirror experimental quasiparticle energies, they are
not meant to reproduce excitation energies and there is formally no connection
between the two (except for the HOMO for the exact functional). Second,
(semi-)local DFT deviates from the expected piecewise linear behavior of the
energy as a function of the total number of electrons. This can make
eigenvalues an even poorer proxy for quasiparticle energies and, together with
the absence of the exchange-correlation derivative discontinuity, contributes
to DFT's underestimation of band gaps. By enforcing a generalized piecewise
linearity condition to the entire electronic manifold, Koopmans functionals
yield molecular orbital energies and solid-state band structures with
comparable accuracy to many-body perturbation theory but at greatly reduced
computational cost and preserving a functional formulation. This paper
introduces "koopmans", an open-source package that contains all of the code and
workflows needed to perform Koopmans functional calculations without requiring
expert knowledge. The theory and algorithms behind Koopmans functionals are
summarized, and it is shown how one can easily use the koopmans package to
obtain reliable spectral properties of molecules and materials.

<h3>Probing momentum-dependent scattering in uniaxially stressed  Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ through the Hall effect</h3>

<br>
<br>
Under in-plane uniaxial stress, the largest Fermi surface sheet of the
correlated metal Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ undergoes a Lifshitz transition from an
electron-like to an open geometry. We investigate the effects of this
transition on transport through measurement of the longitudinal resistivity
$\rho_{xx}$ and the Hall coefficient $R_\text{H}$. At temperatures where
scattering is dominated by electron-electron scattering, $R_\text{H}$ becomes
more negative across the Lifshitz transition, opposite to expectations from the
change in Fermi surface topology. We show that this change in $R_\text{H}$ is
explainable only if scattering changes throughout the Brillouin zone, not just
at the point in $k$-space where the Lifshitz transition occurs. In a model of
orbital-dependent scattering, the electron-electron scattering rate on sections
of Fermi surface with $xy$ orbital weight decreases dramatically. On the other
hand, at temperatures where defect scattering dominates $\rho_{xx}$ and
$R_\text{H}$ are essentially constant across the Lifshitz transition.

Persistent circulation is a canonical effect of superfluidity. In previous
experiments, quantized circulation has been observed in polariton condensates,
usually far from equilibrium, but persistent circulation without stirring has
not. We report here the direct observation of quantized circulation of a
polariton condensate in a well-controlled steady state. We can cause the
condensate to circulate in either direction on demand using a short laser
pulse; after this short pulse, the condensate continues to circulate for dozens
to hundreds of rotations around the ring without any further stimulation. Our
theoretical model successfully shows how the pulse causes the circulation.

Electrostatic potentials strongly affect molecular energy levels and charge
states, providing the fascinating opportunity of molecular gating. Their
influence on molecular vibrations remains less explored. Here, we investigate
Ethyl-Diaminodicyanoquinone molecules on a monolayer of MoS$_2$ on Au(111)
using scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopy and spectroscopy. These
molecules exhibit a large dipole moment in gas phase, which we find to
(partially) persist on the MoS$_2$ monolayer. The self-assembled structures
consist of chains, where the dipoles of neighboring molecules are aligned
anti-parallel. Thanks to the decoupling efficiency of the molecular states from
the metal by the MoS$_2$ interlayer, we resolve vibronic states of the
molecules, which vary in intensity depending on the molecular surrounding. We
suggest that the vibrations are strongly damped by electrostatic interactions
with the environment.

The High-Luminosity LHC Accelerator Upgrade Project (AUP) in the U.S. will
construct quadrupole magnets to be delivered to CERN. An initial 3 tons, over
600 km total length of conductor was procured under the LHC Accelerator R&D
Program (LARP) for this project. Programs for quality control(QC) at the

Measurements of the critical current (Ic) and residual resistance ratio (RRR),

Large high field superconducting magnets often requires high current
superconducting cables. In order to develop these cables, a facility capable of
providing high magnetic field with large sampling area as well as electrical
current of tens of kA is essential. A superconducting transformer is an
energy-efficient and low-cost way to provide large current to superconducting
cables. Previously, we co-developed a superconducting transformer and
successfully tested it to a maximum output current of 45 kA in zero magnetic
field. In this work, this superconducting transformer is installed to the 12 T
split solenoid magnet at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL).
We calibrated it by using this facility to measure critical current of a NbTi
Rutherford cable as a function of magnetic field up to 10 T, and compare the
results with those available in the literature. In addition, a strand extracted
from the NbTi cable is tested for critical current. The critical current of the
extracted strand is scaled and compared with critical current of the cable. The
accuracy of the critical current measurement using this superconducting
transformer is discussed in detail. This work concludes the commissioning of
this superconducting transformer which combined with the 12 T split magnet will
provide unique cable testing capability for future cable development for the
NHMFL and its users.

How does growth encode form in developing organisms? Many different
spatiotemporal growth profiles may sculpt tissues into the same target 3D
shapes, but only specific growth patterns are observed in animal and plant
development. In particular, growth profiles may differ in their degree of
spatial variation and growth anisotropy, however, the criteria that distinguish
observed patterns of growth from other possible alternatives are not
understood. Here we exploit the mathematical formalism of quasiconformal
transformations to formulate the problem of "growth pattern selection"
quantitatively in the context of 3D shape formation by growing 2D epithelial
sheets. We propose that nature settles on growth patterns that are the
'simplest' in a certain way. Specifically, we demonstrate that growth pattern
selection can be formulated as an optimization problem and solved for the
trajectories that minimize spatiotemporal variation in areal growth rates and
deformation anisotropy. The result is a complete prediction for the growth of
the surface, including not only a set of intermediate shapes, but also a
prediction for cell displacement along those surfaces in the process of growth.
Optimization of growth trajectories for both idealized surfaces and those
observed in nature show that relative growth rates can be uniformized at the
cost of introducing anisotropy. Minimizing the variation of programmed growth
rates can therefore be viewed as a generic mechanism for growth pattern
selection and may help to understand the prevalence of anisotropy in
developmental programs.
