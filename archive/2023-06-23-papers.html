<h3>Thermodynamics of Information</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12447" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12447</a>
<br>
<i>Juan M. R. Parrondo</i>
<br>
<br>
As early as 1867, two years after the introduction of the concept of entropy
by Clausius, Maxwell showed that the limitations imposed by the second law of
thermodynamics depend on the information that one possesses about the state of
a physical system. A "very observant and neat-fingered being", later on named
Maxwell demon by Kelvin, could arrange the molecules of a gas and induce a
temperature or pressure gradient without performing work, in apparent
contradiction to the second law. One century later, Landauer claimed that
"information is physical", and showed that certain processes involving
information, like overwriting a memory, need work to be completed and are
unavoidably accompanied by heat dissipation. Thermodynamics of information
analyzes this bidirectional influence between thermodynamics and information
processing. The seminal ideas that Landauer and Bennett devised in the 1970s
have been recently reformulated in a more precise and general way by realizing
that informational states are out of equilibrium and applying new tools from
non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.

<h3>Localised Dynamics in the Floquet Quantum East Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12467" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12467</a>
<br>
<i>Bruno Bertini, Pavel Kos, Tomaz Prosen</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce and study the discrete-time version of the Quantum East model,
an interacting quantum spin chain inspired by simple kinetically constrained
models of classical glasses. Previous work has established that its
continuous-time counterpart displays a disorder-free localisation transition
signalled by the appearance of an exponentially large (in the volume) family of
non-thermal, localised eigenstates. Here we combine analytical and numerical
approaches to show that: i) The transition persists for discrete times, in
fact, it is present for any finite value of the time step apart from a zero
measure set; ii) It is directly detected by following the non-equilibrium
dynamics of the fully polarised state. Our findings imply that the transition
is currently observable in state-of-the-art platforms for digital quantum
simulation.

<h3>Hunting for Majoranas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12473" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12473</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Over the last decade, there have been considerable efforts to observe
non-abelian quasi-particles in novel quantum materials and devices. These
efforts are motivated by the goals of demonstrating quantum statistics of
quasi-particles beyond those of fermions and bosons and of establishing the
underlying science for the creation of topologically protected quantum bits. In
this review, we focus on efforts to create topological superconducting phases
hosting Majorana zero modes. We consider the lessons learned from existing
experimental efforts, which are motivating both improvemensts to current
platforms and exploration of new approaches. Although the experimental
detection of non-abelian quasi-particles remains challenging, the knowledge
gained thus far and the opportunities ahead offer high potential for discovery
and advances in this exciting area of quantum physics.

<h3>Quasiperiodicity hinders ergodic Floquet eigenstates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12479" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12479</a>
<br>
<i>Miguel Gonçalves, Pedro Ribeiro, Ivan M. Khaymovich</i>
<br>
<br>
Quasiperiodic systems in one dimension can host non-ergodic states, e.g.
localized in position or momentum. Periodic quenches within localized phases
yield Floquet eigenstates of the same nature, i.e. spatially localized or
ballistic. However, periodic quenches across these two non-ergodic phases were
thought to produce ergodic diffusive-like states even for non-interacting
particles. We show that this expectation is not met at the thermodynamic limit
where the system always attains a non-ergodic state. We find that ergodicity
may be recovered by scaling the Floquet quenching period with system size and
determine the corresponding scaling function. Our results suggest that while
the fraction of spatially localized or ballistic states depends on the model's
details, all Floquet eigenstates belong to one of these non-ergodic categories.
Our findings demonstrate that quasiperiodicity hinders ergodicity and
thermalization, even in driven systems where these phenomena are commonly
expected.

<h3>SU(4) Symmetry Breaking and Induced Superconductivity in Graphene  Quantum Hall Edges</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12483" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12483</a>
<br>
<i>Joseph J. Cuozzo, Enrico Rossi</i>
<br>
<br>
In graphene, the approximate SU(4) symmetry associated with the spin and
valley degrees of freedom in the quantum Hall (QH) regime is reflected in the
4-fold degeneracy of graphene's Landau levels (LL's). Interactions and the
Zeeman effect break such approximate symmetry and lift the corresponding
degeneracy of the LLs. We study how the breaking of the approximate SU(4)
symmetry affects the properties of graphene's QH edge modes located in
proximity to a superconductor. We show how the lifting of the 4-fold degeneracy
qualitatively modifies the transport properties of the QH-superconductor
heterojunction. For the zero LL, by placing the edge modes in proximity to a
superconductor, it is in principle possible to realize a 1D topological
superconductor supporting Majoranas in the presence of sufficiently strong
Zeeman field. We estimate the topological gap of such a topological
superconductor and relate it to the properties of the QH-superconductor
interface.

<h3>Correlated Phases in Spin-Orbit-Coupled Rhombohedral Trilayer Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12486" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12486</a>
<br>
<i>Jin Ming Koh, Jason Alicea, Étienne Lantagne-Hurtubise</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent experiments indicate that crystalline graphene multilayers exhibit
much of the richness of their twisted counterparts, including cascades of
symmetry-broken states and unconventional superconductivity. Interfacing Bernal
bilayer graphene with a WSe$_2$ monolayer was shown to dramatically enhance
superconductivity -- suggesting that proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling
plays a key role in promoting Cooper pairing. Motivated by this observation, we
study the phase diagram of spin-orbit-coupled rhombohedral trilayer graphene
via self-consistent Hartree-Fock simulations, elucidating the interplay between
displacement field effects, long-range Coulomb repulsion, short-range (Hund's)
interactions, and substrate-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. In addition to
generalized Stoner ferromagnets, we find various flavors of intervalley
coherent ground states distinguished by their transformation properties under
electronic time reversal, ${\rm C}_3$ rotations, and an effective anti-unitary
symmetry. We pay particular attention to broken-symmetry phases that yield
Fermi surfaces compatible with zero-momentum Cooper pairing, identifying
promising candidate orders that may support spin-orbit-enhanced
superconductivity.

<h3>Strain-Switchable Field-Induced Superconductivity</h3>

Field-induced superconductivity is a rare phenomenon where an applied
magnetic field enhances or induces superconductivity. This fascinating effect
arises from a complex interplay between magnetism and superconductivity, and it
offers the tantalizing technological possibility of an infinite
magnetoresistance superconducting spin valve. Here, we demonstrate
field-induced superconductivity at a record-high temperature of T=9K in two
samples of the ferromagnetic superconductor
Eu(Fe$_{0.88}$Co$_{0.12}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$. We combine tunable uniaxial stress
and applied magnetic field to shift the temperature range of the
zero-resistance state between 4K and 10K. We use x-ray diffraction and
spectroscopy measurements under stress and field to demonstrate that stress
tuning of the nematic order and field tuning of the ferromagnetism act as
independent tuning knobs of the superconductivity. Finally, DFT calculations
and analysis of the Eu dipole field reveal the electromagnetic mechanism of the
field-induced superconductivity.

<h3>Self-doped flat band and spin-triplet superconductivity in monolayer  1T-TaSe$_{2-x}$Te$_{x}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12493" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12493</a>
<br>
<i>Jan Phillips, Jose L. Lado, Victor Pardo, Adolfo O. Fumega</i>
<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional van der Waals materials have become an established platform
to engineer flat bands which can lead to strongly-correlated emergent
phenomena. In particular, the family of Ta dichalcogenides in the 1\textit{T}
phase presents a star-of-David charge density wave that creates a flat band at
the Fermi level. For TaS$_2$ and TaSe$_2$ this flat band is at half filling
leading to a magnetic insulating phase. In this work, we theoretically
demonstrate that ligand substitution in the TaSe$_{2-x}$Te$_x$ system produces
a transition from the magnetic insulator to a non-magnetic metal in which the
flat band gets doped away from half-filling. For $x\in[{0.846},{1.231}]$ the
spin-polarized flat band is self-doped and the system becomes a magnetic metal.
In this regime, we show that attractive interactions promote three different
spin-triplet superconducting phases as a function of $x$, corresponding to a
nodal f-wave and two topologically-different chiral p-wave superconducting
phases. Our results establish monolayer TaSe$_{2-x}$Te$_{x}$ as a promising
platform for correlated flat band physics leading to unconventional
superconducting states.

<h3>Strange metal behavior from incoherent carriers scattered by local  moments</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12496" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12496</a>
<br>
<i>Sergio Ciuchi, Simone Fratini</i>
<br>
<br>
We study metallic transport in an effective model that describes the coupling
of electrons to fluctuating magnetic moments with full SU(2) symmetry,
exhibiting characteristic behavior of metals at the approach of the Mott
transition. We show that scattering by fluctuating local moments causes a fully
incoherent regime of electron transport with linear T-dependent resistivities.
This strange metal regime is characterized by almost universal, "Planckian"
slope and a finite intercept at $T=0$, that we can associate respectively to
the fluctuations in orientation and amplitude of the local moments. Our results
indicate a route for understanding the microscopic origin of strange metal
behavior that is unrelated to quantum criticality and does not rely on the
existence of quasiparticles.

<h3>Fractal dimensions of jammed packings with power-law particle size  distributions in two and three dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12499" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12499</a>
<br>
<i>Joseph M. Monti, Ishan Srivastava, Leonardo E. Silbert, Jeremy B. Lechman, Gary S. Grest</i>
<br>
<br>
Static structure factors are computed for large-scale, mechanically stable,
jammed packings of frictionless spheres (three dimensions) and disks (two
dimensions) with broad, power-law size dispersity characterized by the exponent
$-\beta$. The static structure factor exhibits diverging power-law behavior for
small wavenumbers, allowing us to identify a structural fractal dimension,
$d_f$. In three dimensions, $d_f \approx 2.0$ for $2.5 \le \beta \le 3.8 $,
such that each of the structure factors can be collapsed onto a universal
curve. In two dimensions, we instead find $1.0 \lesssim d_f \lesssim 1.34 $ for
$2.1 \le \beta \le 2.9 $. Furthermore, we show that the fractal behavior
persists when rattler particles are removed, indicating that the long
wavelength structural properties of the packings are controlled by the large
particle backbone conferring mechanical rigidity to the system. A numerical
scheme for computing structure factors for triclinic unit cells is presented
and employed to analyze the jammed packings.

<h3>Wurtzite/Zincblende Crystal Phase GaAs Heterostructures in the Tight  Binding Approximation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12537" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12537</a>
<br>
<i>Joseph Sink, Craig Pryor</i>
<br>
<br>
Crystal phase semiconductor heterostructures allow for electron confinement
without uncertainties caused by chemical intermixing found in material
heterostructures and are candidates for next generation optoelectronics devices
ranging from single-photon emitters to high efficiency LEDs. While there has
been a great deal of experimental work developing fabrication processes for
these structures, theoretical calculations have been limited due to a lack of
atomistic models that are able to incorporate the zincblende and wurtzite
within the same structure. Here, we present calculations of the electronic
energies in GaAs nanowires containing various thicknesses of zincblende and
wurtzite layers using a recently developed tight-binding model for wurtzite
III-V semiconductors that is compatible with a zincblende model. By comparing
results in the flat-band and the unscreened limits, we explain the sensitivity
of experimentally observed band gaps on zincblende and wurtzite well widths.
Our calculations suggest that experiments on devices are likely near the
flat-band limit under typical operating conditions.

<h3>Electronic excitations in $5d^4$ J=0 Os$^{4+}$ halides studied by RIXS  and optical spectroscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12538" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12538</a>
<br>
<i>P. Warzanowski, M. Magnaterra, P. Stein, G. Schlicht, Q. Faure, Ch. J. Sahle, T. Lorenz, P. Becker, L. Bohaty, M. Moretti Sala, G. Monaco, P. H. M. van Loosdrecht, M. Grüninger</i>
<br>
<br>
We demonstrate that the cubic antifluorite-type halides K$_2$OsCl$_6$,
K$_2$OsBr$_6$, and Rb$_2$OsBr$_6$ are excellent realizations of non-magnetic
J=0 compounds. The magnetic susceptibility shows the corresponding Van-Vleck
type behavior and no sign of defects. We investigate the electronic excitations
with two complementary techniques, resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS)
and optical spectroscopy. This powerful combination allows us to thoroughly
study, e.g., on-site intra-$t_{2g}$ excitations and $t_{2g}$-to-$e_g$
excitations as well as inter-site excitations across the Mott gap and an
exciton below the gap. In this way, we determine the electronic parameters with
high accuracy, altogether yielding a comprehensive picture. In K$_2$OsCl$_6$,
we find the spin-orbit coupling constant $\zeta$=0.34 eV, Hund's coupling
$J_H$=0.43 eV, the onset of excitations across the Mott gap at $\Delta$=2.2 eV,
the cubic crystal-field splitting 10Dq=3.3 eV, and the charge-transfer energy
$\Delta_{CT}$=4.6 eV. With $J_H/\zeta$=1.3, K$_2$OsCl$_6$ is in the
intermediate-coupling regime. In a $t_{2g}$-only Kanamori picture, the above
values correspond to $\zeta^{eff}$=0.41 eV and $J_H^{eff}$=0.28 eV, which is
very close to results reported for related $5d^4$ iridates. In the tetragonal
phase at 5 K, the non-cubic crystal field causes a peak splitting of the J=1
state as small as 4 meV. Compared to K$_2$OsCl$_6$, the bromides K$_2$OsBr$_6$
and Rb$_2$OsBr$_6$ show about 12-14 % smaller values of 10Dq and $\Delta_{CT}$,
while the spin-orbit-entangled intra-$t_{2g}$ excitations below 2 eV and hence
$\zeta$ and $J_H$ are reduced by less than 4 %. Furthermore, the Mott gap in
K$_2$OsBr$_6$ is reduced to about 1.8 eV.

<h3>Finite-time Lyapunov exponents of deep neural networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12548" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12548</a>
<br>
<i>L. Storm, H. Linander, J. Bec, K. Gustavsson, B. Mehlig</i>
<br>
<br>
We compute how small input perturbations affect the output of deep neural
networks, exploring an analogy between deep networks and dynamical systems,
where the growth or decay of local perturbations is characterised by
finite-time Lyapunov exponents. We show that the maximal exponent forms
geometrical structures in input space, akin to coherent structures in dynamical
systems. Ridges of large positive exponents divide input space into different
regions that the network associates with different classes. These ridges
visualise the geometry that deep networks construct in input space, shedding
light on the fundamental mechanisms underlying their learning capabilities.

<h3>Spin-orbit torques due to warped topological insulator surface states  with an in-plane magnetization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12557" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12557</a>
<br>
<i>Mohsen Farokhnezhad, Reza Asgari, Dimitrie Culcer</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the extrinsic spin-orbit torque (SOT) on the surface of
topological insulators (TIs), which are characterized by two-dimensional warped
Dirac surface states, in the presence of an in-plane magnetization. The
interplay between extrinsic spin-orbit scattering and the in-plane
magnetization results in a net spin density leading to a SOT. Previous theory
suggested that the SOT could only be generated by an out-of-plane magnetic
field component, and any in-plane magnetic contribution could be gauged away.
However, we demonstrate theoretically that with an in-plane magnetization, the
SOT can be finite in TIs due to extrinsic spin-orbit scattering. In the case of
a TI model with a linear dispersion relation, the skew scattering term is zero,
and the extrinsic spin-orbit scattering influences the side-jump scattering,
leading to a finite SOT in TIs. However, when considering the warping term,
finite intrinsic and skew scattering terms will arise, in addition to
modifications to other scattering terms. We further show that the SOT depends
on the azimuthal angles of the magnetization and an external electric field. By
adjusting the extrinsic spin-orbit strength, Fermi energy, magnetization
strength and warping strength, the resulting SOTs can be maximized. These
findings shed light on the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and
magnetization in TIs, offering insights into the control and manipulation of
spin currents in these systems.

<h3>Loops are Geometric Catalysts for DNA Integration</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12558" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12558</a>
<br>
<i>Cleis Battaglia, Davide Michieletto</i>
<br>
<br>
The insertion of HIV and other DNA elements within genomes underpins both
genetic diversity and disease when unregulated. Most of these insertions are
not random and occupy specific positions within the genome but the physical
mechanisms underlying the integration site selection are poorly understood.
Here we perform Molecular Dynamics simulations to study the insertion of DNA
elements, such as HIV viral DNA or transposons, into naked DNA or chromatin
substrate. More specifically, we explore the role of loops in the DNA substrate
and discover that they act as "geometric catalysts" for DNA integration.
Additionally, we discover that the 1D and 3D clustering of loops affects the
distribution of integration sites. Finally, we show that loops may compete with
nucleosomes at attracting DNA integrations. These results may be tested in
vitro and they may help to understand patterns of DNA insertions with
implications in genome evolution and gene therapy.

<h3>Shear-strain-induced two-dimensional slip avalanches in rhombohedral  MoS2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12595" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12595</a>
<br>
<i>Jing Liang, Dongyang Yang, Yunhuan Xiao, Sean Chen, Jerry I. Dadap, Joerg Rottler, Ziliang Ye</i>
<br>
<br>
Slip avalanches are ubiquitous phenomena occurring in 3D materials under
shear strain and their study contributes immensely to our understanding of
plastic deformation, fragmentation, and earthquakes. So far, little is known
about the role of shear strain in 2D materials. Here we show some evidence of
two-dimensional slip avalanches in exfoliated rhombohedral MoS2, triggered by
shear strain near the threshold level. Utilizing interfacial polarization in
3R-MoS2, we directly probe the stacking order in multilayer flakes and discover
a wide variety of polarization domains with sizes following a power-law
distribution. These findings suggest slip avalanches can occur during the
exfoliation of 2D materials, and the stacking orders can be changed via shear
strain. Our observation has far-reaching implications for developing new
materials and technologies, where precise control over the atomic structure of
these materials is essential for optimizing their properties as well as for our
understanding of fundamental physical phenomena.

<h3>Planar Hall effect and magnetoresistance induced by ferroaxial ordering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12614" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12614</a>
<br>
<i>Satoru Hayami, Rikuto Oiwa, Hiroaki Kusunose</i>
<br>
<br>
Transport property under ferroaxial ordering in an external magnetic field is
theoretically investigated. After presenting the relation between the
magnetoconductivity tensor and ferroaxial moment from the symmetry viewpoint,
we analyze the behavior of the planar Hall effect and magnetoconductivity for a
general five $d$-orbital tight-binding model under the point group $C_{\rm
4h}$, where the ferroaxial moment is activated. We show that the crystalline
electric field that arises from the symmetry reduction from $D_{\rm 4h}$ to
$C_{\rm 4h}$ is essential for the ferroaxial-related magnetotransport, while
the relativistic spin-orbit coupling is not required. We also compare the
planar Hall effect driven by the ferroaxial moment with the conventional Hall
effect, the latter of which does not require the ferroaxial moment. The present
results provide characteristic transport properties in the ferroaxial systems,
which can be observed in various candidate materials like Ca$_5$Ir$_3$O$_{12}$.

<h3>Deconfined quantum critical points: a review</h3>

<br>
Continuous phase transitions in equilibrium statistical mechanics were
successfully described 50 years ago with the development of the renormalization
group framework. This framework was initially developed in the context of phase
transitions whose universal properties are captured by the long wavelength (and
long time) fluctuations of a Landau order parameter field. Subsequent
developments include a straightforward generalization to a class of $T = 0$
phase transitions driven by quantum fluctuations. In the last 2 decades it has
become clear that there is a vast landscape of quantum phase transitions where
the physics is not always usefully (or sometimes cannot be) formulated in terms
of fluctuations of a Landau order parameter field. A wide class of such phase
transitions - dubbed deconfined quantum critical points - involve the emergence
of fractionalized degrees of freedom coupled to emergent gauge fields. Here I
review some salient aspects of these deconfined critical points.

<h3>Unconventional superfluidity of superconductivity on Penrose lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12641" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12641</a>
<br>
<i>Yu-Bo Liu, Zi-Yan Shao, Ye Cao, Fan Yang</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically investigate the gap function, superfluid density and the
transition temperature of the superconductivity (SC) on semi-periodic Penrose
lattice, where an attractive Hubbard model is adopted as an example. Firstly,
we clarify that the gap function, density of states and superfluid density are
all positively correlate to the extended degree of single particle states
around the Fermi energy. Secondly, we identify that the paramagnetic component
of the superfluid density does not decay to zero in the thermodynamic limit,
which is completely different from the periodic system. The difference between
the diamagnetic and paramagnetic currents keeps stable with whatever scaling,
which is consistent with recent experimental results that although the
superfluid density is lower than that of the periodic system, the system has
bulk SC. Thirdly, we find that both the superfluid density and SC transition
temperature can be boosted with the increase of disorder strength, which should
be general to quasicrystal but unusual to periodic systems, reflecting the
interplay between the underlying geometry and disorder.

<h3>Discovery of antiferromagnetic chiral helical ordered state in trigonal  GdNi$_3$Ga$_9$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12648" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12648</a>

<i>Shota Nakamura, Takeshi Matsumura, Kazuma Ohashi, Hiroto Suzuki, Mitsuru Tsukagoshi, Kenshin Kurauchi, Hironori Nakao, Shigeo Ohara</i>
<br>
<br>
We have performed magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, and specific heat
measurements on a chiral magnet GdNi$_3$Ga$_9$, belonging to the trigonal space
group $R32$ (\#155). A magnetic phase transition takes place at $T_{\rm N}$ =
19.5 K. By applying a magnetic field along the $a$ axis at 2 K, the
magnetization curve exhibits two jumps at $\sim$ 3 kOe and = 45 kOe. To
determine the magnetic structure, we performed a resonant X-ray diffraction
experiment by utilizing a circularly polarized beam. It is shown that a
long-period antiferromagnetic (AFM) helical order is realized at zero field.
The Gd spins in the honeycomb layer are coupled in an antiferromagnetic manner
in the $c$ plane and rotate with a propagation vector $q$ = (0, 0, 1.485). The
period of the helix is 66.7 unit cells ($\sim 180$~nm). In magnetic fields
above 3~kOe applied perpendicular to the helical $c$ axis, the AFM helical
order changes to an AFM order with $q$ = (0, 0, 1.5).

<br>
<br>
The magnetic helicities of the cycloidal ordering in EuIrGe$_3$, with a
noncentrosymmetric tetragonal structure, have been studied by circularly
polarized resonant X-ray diffraction. It is shown that the helicity of each
cycloidal domain is uniquely determined and satisfies the symmetry relations of
the $C_{4v}$ point group of the crystal structure. The result shows that the
cycloidal helicity is determined by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type
antisymmetric exchange interaction. The domain selection and the phase
transition by the external magnetic field along [100] and [110] have also been
studied. It is shown that the cycloidal plane prefers to be perpendicular to
the field and the transverse conical state is realized.

<h3>Memristive Reservoirs Learn to Learn</h3>

<br>
<i>Ruomin Zhu, Jason K. Eshraghian, Zdenka Kuncic</i>
<br>
<br>
Memristive reservoirs draw inspiration from a novel class of neuromorphic
hardware known as nanowire networks. These systems display emergent brain-like
dynamics, with optimal performance demonstrated at dynamical phase transitions.
In these networks, a limited number of electrodes are available to modulate
system dynamics, in contrast to the global controllability offered by
neuromorphic hardware through random access memories. We demonstrate that the
learn-to-learn framework can effectively address this challenge in the context
of optimization. Using the framework, we successfully identify the optimal
hyperparameters for the reservoir. This finding aligns with previous research,
which suggests that the optimal performance of a memristive reservoir occurs at
the `edge of formation' of a conductive pathway. Furthermore, our results show
that these systems can mimic membrane potential behavior observed in spiking
neurons, and may serve as an interface between spike-based and continuous
processes.

High quality Nb-based superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) junctions
with Al oxide (AlO$_x$) tunnel barriers grown from Al overlayers are widely
reported in the literature. However, the thin barriers required for high
critical current density (J$_c$) junctions exhibit defects that result in
significant subgap leakage current that is detrimental for many applications.
High quality, high-J$_c$ junctions can be realized with AlN$_x$ barriers, but
control of J$_c$ is more difficult than with AlO$_x$. It is therefore of
interest to study the growth of thin AlO$_x$ barriers with the ultimate goal of
achieving high quality, high-J$_c$ AlO$_x$ junctions. In this work, 100\%\
O$_2$ and 2\%\ O$_2$ in Ar gas mixtures are used both statically and
dynamically to grow AlO$_x$ tunnel barriers over a large range of oxygen
exposures. In situ ellipsometry is used for the first time to extensively
measure AlO$_x$ tunnel barrier growth in real time, revealing a number of
unexpected patterns. Finally, a set of test junction wafers was fabricated that
exhibited the well-known dependence of J$_c$ on oxygen exposure (E) in order to
further validate the experimental setup.

<br>
<br>
In this work, the effect on crystallite orientation, surface morphology,
fractal geometry, structural coordination and electronic environment of DC
magnetron sputtered AlN films were investigated. X-ray diffraction results
disclosed that the c-axis orientation of AlN films increased with the preferred
wurtzite hexagonal structure above 17% N2 flow. X-ray reflectivity data
confirmed AlN film density increased with increasing N2 flow and was found to
be 3.18g/cm3 for 40% N2. The transition of electrons from N 1s to 2p states
hybridized with Al 3p states because of {\pi}* resonance was obtained from
X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the N K-edge. The semi-empirical coordination
geometry of nitrogen atoms has been studied by deconvolution of N K-edge. The
surface composition of AlN films at 40% N2 consists of 32.08, 51.94 and
15.97at.% Al, N and O respectively. Blue-shifting of A1(LO) and E1(LO) modes in
the Raman spectra at phonon energies 800 and 1051cm-1 respectively was most
likely due to the presence of oxygen bonds in the AlN films.

<h3>High Impedance Josephson Junction Resonators in the Transmission Line  Geometry</h3>

In this article we present an experimental study of microwave resonators made
out of Josephson junctions. The junctions are embedded in a transmission line
geometry so that they increase the inductance per length for the line. By
comparing two devices with different input/output coupling strengths, we show
that the coupling capacitors, however, add a significant amount to the total
capacitance of the resonator. This makes the resonators with high coupling
capacitance to act rather as lumped element resonators with inductance from the
junctions and capacitance from the end sections. Based on a circuit analysis,
we also show that the input and output couplings of the resonator are limited
to a maximum value of $\omega_r Z_0 /4 Z_r$ where $\omega_r$ is the resonance
frequency and $Z_0$ and $Z_r$ are the characteristic impedances of the
input/output lines and the resonator respectively.

We solve the time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation for a two-dimensional
active Brownian particle exploring a circular region with an absorbing
boundary. Using the passive Brownian particle as basis states and dealing with
the activity as a perturbation, we provide a matrix representation of the
Fokker-Planck operator and we express the propagator in terms of the perturbed
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Alternatively, we show that the propagator can
be expressed as a combination of the equilibrium eigenstates with weights
depending only on time and on the initial conditions, and obeying exact
iterative relations. Our solution allows also obtaining the survival
probability and the first-passage time distribution. These latter quantities
exhibit peculiarities induced by the non-equilibrium character of the dynamics,
in particular, they display a strong dependence on the activity of the particle
and, to a less extent, also on its rotational diffusivity.

The ability to locally apply and tune large magnetic fields is a crucial
requirement for several devices, most notably for detection and generation of
majorana fermions. Such a functionality can be achieved in Superconductor (S)
/Ferromagnet (F) bilayers, where superconductivity is strengthened on top of
domain walls due to local lowering of the proximity induced effective exchange
fields. This is predicted to result in significant superconducting Tc
enhancements and possible complete magnetic controlled switching on and off of
the superconducting state. By using thin films of superconducting Nb and
ferromagnetic insulating (GdN) bilayers, and through detailed magneto-transport
measurements, we demonstrate the previously unobserved phenomena of complete
switching in and out of the S state in S/F bilayers. In the thinnest of Nb
layers, we estimate that the domain wall state induced tunability of proximity
induced exchange fields can be as high as 1.3T with application of in plane
external fields of only a few mT.

<h3>Fermi surface reconstruction due to the orthorhombic distortion in Dirac  semimetal YbMnSb$_2$</h3>

Dirac semi-metal with magnetic atoms as constituents delivers an interesting
platform to investigate the interplay of Fermi surface (FS) topology, electron
correlation, and magnetism. One such family of semi-metal is YbMn$Pn_2$ ($Pn$ =
Sb, Bi), which is being actively studied due to the intertwined spin and charge
degrees of freedom. In this Letter, we investigate the relationship between the
magnetic/crystal structures and FS topology of YbMnSb$_2$ using single crystal
x-ray diffraction, neutron scattering, magnetic susceptibility,
magnetotransport measurement and complimentary DFT calculation. Contrary to
previous reports, the x-ray and neutron diffraction reveal that YbMnSb$_2$
crystallizes in an orthorhombic $Pnma$ structure with notable anti-phase
displacement of the magnetic Mn ions that increases in magnitude upon cooling.
First principles DFT calculation reveals a reduced Brillouin zone and more
anisotropic FS of YbMnSb$_2$ compared to YbMnBi$_2$ as a result of the
orthorhombicity. Moreover, the hole type carrier density drops by two orders of
magnitude as YbMnSb$_2$ orders antiferromagnetically indicating band folding in
magnetic ordered state. In addition, the Landau level fan diagram yields a
non-trivial nature of the SdH quantum oscillation frequency arising from the
Dirac-like Fermi pocket. These results imply that YbMnSb$_2$ is an ideal
platform to explore the interplay of subtle lattice distortion, magnetic order,
and topological transport arising from relativistic quasiparticles.

<h3>Logarithmic or algebraic: roughening of a generalised  Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation</h3>

<br>
We show that a nearly phase-ordered two-dimensional (2D) active XY model on a
substrate, or a nearly flat active interface that follows a generalised
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation can be stable in some parameters regimes. In
these regimes, the phase fluctuations of the XY model or the interface
conformation fluctuations can exhibit a sub-logarithmic or a super-logarithmic
roughness. Specifically, an interface of lateral size L, or 2D active XY model
on a substrate of linear size L, respectively, will undulate over a typical
size or display typical angular fluctuations of size $[\ln(L/a)]^{\mu}$, where
$\mu<(>)1$ for sub-(super-)logarithmic roughness and a is a microscopic cutoff.
This generalise the well-known quasi-long range order of the 2D equilibrium XY
model at low temperatures, implying less or more rough than 2D Edward-Wilkinson
surfaces. In other parameter regimes, there is only short range phase-order, or
an algebraically rough interface.

The kinetics of phase transition processes often governs the resulting
material microstruc-ture. Using optical microscopy, we here investigate the
formation and stabilization of a po-rous crystalline microstructure forming in
low-salt suspensions of charged colloidal spheres containing aggregates
comprising some 5-10 of these colloids. We observe the transformation of an
initially crystalline colloidal solid with homogeneously incorporated
aggregates to indi-vidual, compositionally refined crystallites of perforated
morphology coexisting with an ag-gregate-enriched fluid phase filling the holes
and separating individual crystallites. A prelimi-nary kinetic characterization
suggests that the involved processes follow power laws. We show that this route
to porous materials is neither restricted to nominally single component systems
nor to a particular microstructure to start from. However, it necessitates an
early rapid solidification stage during which the aggregates become trapped in
the bulk of the host-crystals. The thermodynamic stability of the reconstructed
crystalline scaffold against melt-ing under increased salinity was found
comparable to that of pure phase crystallites grown very slowly from a melt.
Future implications of this novel route to porous colloidal crystals are
discussed.

<h3>When is the average number of saddle points typical?</h3>

A common measure of a function's complexity is the count of its stationary
points. For complicated functions, this count grows exponentially with the
volume and dimension of their domain. In practice, the count is averaged over a
class of functions (the annealed average), but the large numbers involved can
produce averages biased by extremely rare samples. Typical counts are reliably
found by taking the average of the logarithm (the quenched average), which is
more difficult and not often done in practice. When most stationary points are
uncorrelated with each other, quenched and anneals averages are equal.
Equilibrium heuristics can guarantee when most of the lowest minima will be
uncorrelated. We show that these equilibrium heuristics cannot be used to draw
conclusions about other minima and saddles by producing examples among
Gaussian-correlated functions on the hypersphere where the count of certain
saddles and minima has different quenched and annealed averages, despite being
guaranteed `safe' in the equilibrium setting. We determine conditions for the
emergence of nontrivial correlations between saddles, and discuss the
implications for the geometry of those functions and what out-of-equilibrium
settings might be affected.

It was recently experimentally proved that the superconducting counterpart of
a diode, i.e., a device that realizes nonreciprocal Cooper pairs transport, can
be realized by breaking the spatial and time-reversal symmetry of a system
simultaneously. Here we report the theory, fabrication, and operation of a
monolithic dc superconducting quantum interference device (dc-SQUID) that
embedding three-dimensional (3D) Dayem nanobridges as weak links realizes an
efficient and magnetic flux-tunable supercurrent diode. The device is entirely
realized in Al and achieves a maximum rectification efficiency of $\sim 20\%$,
which stems from the high harmonic content of its current-to-phase relation
only without the need of any sizable screening current caused by a finite loop
inductance. Our interferometer can be easily integrated with state-of-the-art
superconducting electronics, and since it does not require a finite loop
inductance to provide large rectification its downsizing is not limited by the
geometrical constraints of the superconducting ring.

<h3>Spatio-Temporal Electron Propagation Dynamics in Au/Fe/MgO(001) in  nonequilibrium: Revealing Single Scattering Events and the Ballistic Limit</h3>

Understanding the microscopic spatio-temporal dynamics of nonequilibrium
charge carriers in heterosystems promises optimization of process and device
design towards desired energy transfer. Hot electron transport is governed by
scattering with other electrons, defects, and bosonic excitations. Analysis of
the energy dependence of scattering pathways and identification of diffusive,
super-diffusive, and ballistic transport regimes are current challenges. We
determine in femtosecond time-resolved two-photon photoelectron emission
spectroscopy the energy-dependent change of the electron propagation time
through epitaxial Au/Fe(001) heteostructures as a function of Au layer
thickness for energies of 0.5 to \unit[2.0]{eV} above the Fermi energy. We
describe the laser-induced nonequilibrium electron excitation and injection
across the Fe/Au interface using real-time time-dependent density functional
theory and analyze the electron propagation through the Au layer by microscopic
electron transport simulations. We identify ballistic transport of minority
electrons at energies with a nascent, optically excited electron population
which is determined by the combination of photon energy and the specific
electronic structure of the material. At lower energy, super-diffusive
transport with 1 to 4 scattering events dominates. The effective electron
velocity accelerates from 0.3 to \unit[1]{nm/fs} with an increase in the Au
layer thickness from 10 to 100~nm. This phenomenon is explained by electron
transport that becomes preferentially aligned with the interface normal for
thicker Au layers, which facilitates electron momentum / energy selection by
choice of the propagation layer thickness.

<h3>Arrangement of nearby minima and saddles in the mixed spherical energy  landscapes</h3>

The mixed spherical models were recently found to violate long-held
assumptions about mean-field glassy dynamics. In particular, the threshold
energy, where most stationary points are marginal and which in the simpler pure
models attracts long-time dynamics, seems to lose significance. Here, we
compute the typical distribution of stationary points relative to each other in
mixed models with a replica symmetric complexity. We examine the stability of
nearby points, accounting for the presence of an isolated eigenvalue in their
spectrum due to their proximity. Despite finding rich structure not present in
the pure models, we find nothing that distinguishes the points that do attract
the dynamics. Instead, we find new geometric significance of the old threshold
energy, and invalidate pictures of the arrangement most of marginal inherent
states into a continuous manifold.

In my short essay in honor of Karl-Alex Mueller, I would like to deal with
some aspects that have been on my mind since the beginning of my own research.
Some of the facts and questions mentioned here have been known or clarified for
a long time, others not. For example, I think that the fact that
superconductivity occurs almost spontaneously in many cuprates close to the
optimum doping level has been insufficiently investigated (or not at all). Much
research has been done in the regions outside the optimal doping, be it
underdoped or overdoped. I would like to deviate from the "mainstream" for a
moment and ask whether these regions are really so relevant for the occurrence
of superconductivity, or whether they simply serve to interfere with it - a
thought which I am sure has been expressed by others and which would certainly
lead (or had already led) to lively discussions with Karl-Alex Mueller.

Using molecular beam epitaxy, we demonstrate the growth of (In,Ga)N shells
emitting in the green spectral range around very thin (35 nm diameter) GaN core
nanowires. These GaN nanowires are obtained by self-assembled growth on TiN. We
present a qualitative shell growth model accounting for both the
three-dimensional nature of the nanostructures as well as the directionality of
the atomic fluxes. This model allows us, on the one hand, to optimise the
conditions for high and homogeneous In incorporation and, on the other hand, to
explain the influence of changes in the growth conditions on the sample
morphology and In content. Specifically, the impact of the V/III and In/Ga flux
ratios, the rotation speed and the rotation direction are investigated.
Notably, with In acting as surfactant, the ternary (In,Ga)N shells are much
more homogeneous in thickness along the NW length than their binary GaN
counterparts.

<br>
The low crystal symmetry of rhenium disulphide (ReS2) leads to the emergence
of dichroic optical and optoelectronic response, absent in other layered
transition metal dichalcogenides, which could be exploited for device
applications requiring polarization resolution. To date, spectroscopy studies
on the optical response of ReS2 have relied almost exclusively in
characterization techniques involving optical detection, such as
photoluminescence, absorbance, or reflectance spectroscopy. However, to realize
the full potential of this material, it is necessary to develop knowledge on
its optoelectronic response with spectral resolution. In this work, we study
the polarization-dependent photocurrent spectra of few-layer ReS2
photodetectors, both in room conditions and at cryogenic temperature. Our
spectral measurements reveal two main exciton lines at energies matching those
reported for optical spectroscopy measurements, as well as their excited
states. Moreover, we also observe an additional exciton-like spectral feature
with a photoresponse intensity comparable to the two main exciton lines. We
attribute this feature, not observed in earlier photoluminescence measurements,
to a non-radiative exciton transition. The intensities of the three main
exciton features, as well as their excited states, modulate with linear
polarization of light, each one acquiring maximal strength at a different
polarization angle. We have performed first-principles exciton calculations
employing the Bethe-Salpeter formalism, which corroborate our experimental
findings. Our results bring new perspectives for the development of ReS2-based
nanodevices.

The orbital angular momenta (OAM) of electrons play an increasingly important
role in ultrafast electron and magnetization dynamics. In this theoretical
study, we investigate the electron dynamics induced by femtosecond laser pulses
in a normal metal, a ferromagnet, and a ferromagnet/normal metal
heterostructure. We analyze the spatio-temporal distributions of the
laser-induced OAM and their respective currents. Our findings demonstrate that
a circularly polarized laser pulse can induce a sizable and long-lasting OAM
component in a normal metal. Furthermore, an interface between a ferromagnet
and a normal metal facilitates the demagnetization of the magnet by the OAM
contribution to the total magnetization. Finally, to transfer OAM from a
ferromagnet into a normal metal, it is advantageous to use a laser setup that
induces the desired OAM component in the ferromagnet, but not in the normal
metal.

Accurately predicting the elastic properties of crystalline solids is vital
for computational materials science. However, traditional atomistic scale ab
initio approaches are computationally intensive, especially for studying
complex materials with a large number of atoms in a unit cell. We introduce a
novel data-driven approach to efficiently predict the elastic properties of
crystal structures using SE(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs). This
approach yields important scalar elastic moduli with the accuracy comparable to
recent data-driven studies. Importantly, our symmetry-aware GNNs model also
enables the prediction of the strain energy density (SED) and the associated
elastic constants, the fundamental tensorial quantities that are significantly
influenced by a material's crystallographic group. The model consistently
distinguishes independent elements of SED tensors, in accordance with the
symmetry of the crystal structures. Finally, our deep learning model possesses
meaningful latent features, offering an interpretable prediction of the elastic
properties.

Momentum-matched type II van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) have been
designed by assembling layered two-dimensional semiconductors (2DSs) with
special band-structure combinations - that is, the valence band edge at the
Gamma point (the Brillouin-zone center) for one 2DS and the conduction band
edge at the Gamma point for the other [Ubrig et al., Nat. Mater. 19, 299
(2020)]. However, the band offset sizes, band-alignment types, and whether
momentum matched or not, all are affected by the interfacial effects between
the component 2DSs, such as the quasichemical-bonding (QB) interaction between
layers and the electrical dipole moment formed around the vdW interface. Here,
based on density-functional theory calculations, first we probe the interfacial
effects (including different QBs for valence and conduction bands, interface
dipole, and, the synergistic effects of these two aspects) on band-edge
evolution in energy and valley (location in the Brillouin zone) and the
resulting changes in band alignment and momentum matching for a typical vdWH of
monolayer InSe and bilayer WS2, in which the band edges of subsystems satisfy
the special band-structure combination for a momentum-matched type II vdWH.
Then, based on the conclusions of the studied interfacial effects, we propose a
practical screening method for robust momentum-matched type II vdWHs. This
practical screening method can also be applied to other band alignment types.
Our current study opens a way for practical screening and designing of vdWHs
with robust momentum-matching and band alignment type.

In X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the injected hole interacts with
the electronic polarization cloud induced by the hole itself, ultimately
resulting in a lower binding energy. Such polarization effect can shift the
core-level energy by more than 1 eV, as shown here by embedded many-body
perturbation theory for the paradigmatic case of noble gas clusters made of Ar,
Kr, or Xe. The polarization energy is almost identical for the different
core-orbitals of a given atom, but it strongly depends on the position of the
ionized atom in the cluster. An analytical formula is derived from classical
continuum electrostatics, providing an effective and accurate description of
polarization effects, which permits to achieve an excellent agreement with
available experiments on noble gas clusters at a modest computational cost.
Electronic polarization provides a crucial contribution to core levels absolute
energies and chemical shifts.

Natural habitats of most living microorganisms are distinguished by a complex

transport properties of motile microorganisms are strongly affected by crowded
and locally anisotropic environments. Using \chlamy as a model system, we
explore the permeation of active colloids through a structured wall of
obstacles by tracking microswimmers' trajectories and analysing their
statistical properties. Employing micro-labyrinths formed by cylindrical or
elongated pillars, we demonstrate that the anisotropy of the pillar's form and
orientation strongly affects the microswimmers' dynamics on different time
scales. Furthermore, we discuss the kinetics of the microswimmer exchange
between two compartments separated by an array of pillars.

We propose a concept of quantum dot based light emitting diode that produces

magnetic field and electron nuclear hyperfine interaction. The device operates
under injection of electrons and holes from nonmagnetic contacts in a small
field of the order of milliteslas. Its size can be parametrically smaller than

can reach 100%. The proposed concept is compatible with the micropillar

A general method to obtain a representation of the structural landscape of
nanoparticles in terms of a limited number of variables is proposed. The method
is applied to a large dataset of parallel tempering molecular dynamics
simulations of gold clusters of 90 and 147 atoms, silver clusters of 147 atoms,
and copper clusters of 147 atoms, covering a plethora of structures and
temperatures. The method leverages convolutional neural networks to learn the
radial distribution functions of the nanoclusters and to distill a
low-dimensional chart of the structural landscape. This strategy is found to
give rise to a physically meaningful and differentiable mapping of the atom
positions to a low-dimensional manifold, in which the main structural motifs
are clearly discriminated and meaningfully ordered. Furthermore, unsupervised
clustering on the low-dimensional data proved effective at further splitting
the motifs into structural subfamilies characterized by very fine and
physically relevant differences, such as the presence of specific punctual or
planar defects or of atoms with particular coordination features. Owing to
these peculiarities, the chart also enabled tracking of the complex structural
evolution in a reactive trajectory. In addition to visualization and analysis
of complex structural landscapes, the presented approach offers a general,
low-dimensional set of differentiable variables which has the potential to be
used for exploration and enhanced sampling purposes.

We study the current driven by an applied voltage as a function of time
through the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model when coupled to two normal or
superconducting reservoirs. For normal leads, in the strong coupling limit and
for small bias, the current through the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, described by a
quartic interaction term, reaches monotonically the stationarity, in contrast
to the case of a disordered quadratic interaction where the current has a peak
before reaching the stationary phase. For superconducting leads the current
have oscillations whose frequencies are determined by the gap and the voltage,
and are suppressed in the strong coupling limit. Moreover, due to different
short time scales between the normal and the oscillating part of the
superconducting current, a peak appears before reaching the stationarity.

<h3>Nonlinear Mechanics of Remodeling</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this paper we present a large-deformation formulation of the mechanics of
remodeling. Remodeling is anelasticity with an internal constraint -- material
evolutions that are mass and volume preserving. In this special class of
material evolutions the explicit time dependence of the energy function is via
a remodeling tensor (or a set of remodeling tensors) that is (are) the internal
variable(s) of the theory. The governing equations of remodeling solids are
derived using a two-potential approach and the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle.
We consider both isotropic and anisotropic solids and derive their
corresponding remodeling equations. We study a particular remodeling of
fiber-reinforced solids in which the fiber orientation is time dependent in the
reference configuration -- SO(3)-remodeling. We consider an additional
remodeling energy, which is motivated by the energy spent in living systems to
remodel to enhance stiffness in the direction of loading. We consider the
examples of a solid reinforced with either one or two families of reorienting
fibers and derive their remodeling equations. This is a generalization of some
of the proposed remodeling equations in the literature. We study three examples
of material remodeling, namely finite extensions and torsion of solid circular
cylinders, which are universal deformation for incompressible isotropic solids
and certain anisotropic solids. We consider both displacement and force-control
loadings. Detailed parametric studies are provided for the effects of various
material and loading parameters on the fiber remodeling.

<br>
<br>
Self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) have properties highly valuable
for developing various optoelectronic devices such as QD lasers and single
photon sources. The applications strongly rely on the density and quality of
these dots, which has motivated studies of the growth process control to
realize high-quality epi-wafers and devices. Establishing the process
parameters in molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) for a specific density of QDs is a
multidimensional optimization challenge, usually addressed through
time-consuming and iterative trial-and-error. Meanwhile, reflective high-energy
electron diffraction (RHEED) has been widely used to capture a wealth of growth
information in situ. However, it still faces the challenges of extracting
information from noisy and overlapping images. Here, based on 3D ResNet, we
developed a machine learning (ML) model specially designed for training RHEED
videos instead of static images and providing real-time feedback on surface
morphologies for process control. We demonstrated that ML from previous growth
could predict the post-growth density of QDs, by successfully tuning the QD
densities in near-real time from 1.5E10 cm-2 down to 3.8E8 cm-2 or up to 1.4
E11 cm-2. Compared to traditional methods, our approach, with in-situ tuning
capabilities and excellent reliability, can dramatically expedite the material
optimization process and improve the reproducibility of MBE growth,
constituting significant progress for thin film growth techniques. The concepts
and methodologies proved feasible in this work are promising to be applied to a
variety of material growth processes, which will revolutionize semiconductor
manufacturing for microelectronic and optoelectronic industries.

<br>
Charge-transfer excitations are of paramount importance for understanding the
electronic structure of copper-oxide based high-temperature superconductors. In
this study, we investigate the response of a
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{\mathrm{8}+ \delta}$ crystal to the charge
redistribution induced by an infrared ultrashort pulse. Element-selective
time-resolved core-level photoelectron spectroscopy with a high energy
resolution allows disentangling the dynamics of oxygen ions with different
coordination and bonds thanks to their different chemical shifts. Our
experiment shows that the O\,$1s$ component arising from the Cu-O planes is
significantly perturbed by the infrared light pulse. Conversely, the apical
oxygen, also coordinated with Sr ions in the Sr-O planes, remains unaffected.
This result highlights the peculiar behavior of the electronic structure of the
Cu-O planes. It also unlocks the way to study the out-of-equilibrium electronic
structure of copper-oxide-based high-temperature superconductors by identifying
the O\,$1s$ core-level emission originating from the oxygen ions in the Cu-O
planes. This ability could be critical to gain information about the
strongly-correlated electron ultrafast dynamical mechanisms in the Cu-O plane
in the normal and superconducting phases.

<br>
<br>
We study the ground state properties of the hole-doped three-band Hubbard
(Emery) model, describing the copper-oxygen planes of the cuprates, using
large-scale 2D tensor network calculations. Our simulations reveal a period 4
stripe state with spin and weak charge order over an extended doping range
beyond $\delta\sim0.12$ and stripes with larger periods at smaller doping. The
period 4 stripe exhibits coexisting $d$-wave superconductivity in the doping
range $0.15 \lesssim \delta < 0.25$, while at smaller doping around $\delta
\sim 1/8$ we find a strong competition between superconducting and
non-superconducting stripes, including also pair density-wave states with
alternating sign structure on neighboring stripes, suggesting that the fate of
superconductivity around 1/8 doping may be sensitive on the model parameters.

<h3>The Physical Effects of Learning</h3>

Interacting many-body physical systems ranging from neural networks in the
brain to folding proteins to self-modifying electrical circuits can learn to
perform specific tasks. This learning, both in nature and in engineered
systems, can occur through evolutionary selection or through dynamical rules
that drive active learning from experience. Here, we show that learning leaves
architectural imprints on the Hessian of a physical system. Compared to a
generic organization of the system components, (a) the effective physical
dimension of the response to inputs (the participation ratio of low-eigenvalue
modes) decreases, (b) the response of physical degrees of freedom to random
perturbations (or system ``susceptibility'') increases, and (c) the
low-eigenvalue eigenvectors of the Hessian align with the task. Overall, these
effects suggest a method for discovering the task that a physical network may
have been trained for.

<h3>Single-file transport of binary hard-sphere mixtures through periodic  potentials</h3>

<br>
<i>David Voráč, Philipp Maass, Artem Ryabov</i>
<br>
<br>
Single-file transport occurs in various scientific fields, including
diffusion through nanopores, nanofluidic devices, and cellular processes. We
here investigate the impact of polydispersity on particle currents for
single-file Brownian motion of hard spheres, when they are driven through
periodic potentials by a constant drag force. Through theoretical analysis and
extensive Brownian dynamics simulations, we unveil the behavior of particle
currents for random binary mixtures. The particle currents show a recurring
pattern in dependence of the hard-sphere diameters and mixing ratio. We explain
this recurrent behavior by showing that a basic unit cell exists in the space
of the two hard-sphere diameters. Once the behavior of an observable inside the
unit cell is determined, it can be inferred for any diameter. The overall
variation of particle currents with the mixing ratio and hard-sphere diameters
is reflected by their variation in the limit where the system is fully covered
by hard spheres. In this limit, the currents can be predicted analytically. Our
analysis explains the occurrence of pronounced maxima and minima of the
currents by changes of an effective potential barrier for the center-of-mass
motion.

Characterizing the anchoring properties of smectic liquid crystals (LCs) in
contact with bacterial solutions is crucial for developing biosensing
platforms. In this study, we investigate the anchoring properties of a smectic
LC when exposed to Bacillus Subtilis and Escherichia coli bacterial solutions
using interfaces with known anchoring properties. By monitoring the optical
response of the smectic film, we successfully distinguish different types of
bacteria, leveraging the distinct changes in the LC's response. Through a
comprehensive analysis of the interactions between bacterial proteins and the
smectic interface, we elucidate the potential underlying mechanisms responsible
for these optical changes. Additionally, we introduce the utilization of
topological defects; the focal conic domains (FCDs), at the smectic interface
as an indicative measure of the bacterial concentration. Our findings
demonstrate the significant potential of smectic LCs and their defects for
biosensing applications and contribute to our understanding of bacteria- LC
interactions, paving the way for advancements in pathogen detection and
protein-based sensing.

<br>
<br>
Because of their small size, low loss, and compatibility with magnetic fields
and elevated temperatures, surface acoustic wave resonators hold significant
potential as future quantum interconnects. Here, we design, fabricate, and
characterize GHz-frequency surface acoustic wave resonators with the potential
for strong capacitive coupling to nanoscale solid-state quantum systems,
including semiconductor quantum dots. Strong capacitive coupling to such
systems requires a large characteristic impedance, and the resonators we
fabricate have impedance values above 100 $\Omega$. We achieve such high
impedance values by tightly confining a Gaussian acoustic mode. At the same
time, the resonators also have low loss, with quality factors of several
thousand at millikelvin temperatures. These high-impedance resonators are
expected to exhibit large vacuum electric-field fluctuations and have the
potential for strong coupling to a variety of solid-state quantum systems.

<h3>Voltage deficit in solar cells with suppressed recombination</h3>

<br>
<br>
The observed open circuit voltages in best performing solar cells are
explained outside of the recombination paradigm, based on such factors as
electrostatic screening, Meyer-Neldel effect, and lateral nonuniformities. The
underlying concept of suppressed recombination presents a long neglected
alternative pathway to efficient PV. The criterion of suppressed recombination
is consistent with the data for best performing solar cells. Also, consistent
with the observations, is the open circuit voltage deficit that exhibits a
lower bound of about $0.2-0.3$ V, does not correlate well with the optical gap,
and shows a significant dispersion for materials possessing the same gap
values.

<h3>Gilbert damping in metallic ferromagnets from Schwinger-Keldysh field  theory: Nonlocality, nonuniformity, and anisotropy in the presence of  spin-orbit coupling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13013" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13013</a>
<br>
<i>Felipe Reyes-Osorio, Branislav K. Nikolic</i>
<br>
<br>
Understanding the origin of damping mechanisms in magnetization dynamics of
metallic ferromagnets is a fundamental problem for nonequilibrium many-body
physics of systems where quantum conduction electrons interact with localized
spins assumed to be governed by the classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG)
equation. It is also of critical importance for applications as damping affects
energy consumption and speed of spintronic and magnonic devices. Since the
1970s, a variety of linear-response and scattering theory approaches have been
developed to produce widely used formulas for computation of
spatially-independent Gilbert scalar parameter as the magnitude of the Gilbert
damping term in the LLG equation. The largely-unexploited-for-this-purpose
Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) offers additional possibilities, such as
rigorously deriving an extended LLG equation by integrating quantum electrons
out. Here we derive such equation whose Gilbert damping for metallic
ferromagnets in $d=1$-$3$ dimensions is nonlocal-i.e., dependent on position of
all localized spins at a given time-and nonuniform, even if all localized spins
are collinear and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is absent. This is in sharp
contrast to standard lore, where nonlocal damping is possible only if localized
spins are noncollinear, while SOC is required to obtain a standard Gilbert
damping scalar parameter for collinear localized spins. The same mechanism,
which is physically due to retarded response of conduction electronic spins to
the motion of localized spins, generates wavevector-dependent damping on spin
waves, whereas nonzero SOC makes nonlocal damping anisotropic. Our analytical
formulas, with their nonlocality being more prominent in low spatial dimensions
$d \le 2$, are fully corroborated by numerically exact $d=1$ quantum-classical
simulations.

<h3>Axion Insulator State in Hundred-Nanometer-Thick Magnetic Topological  Insulator Sandwich Heterostructures</h3>

<br>
<br>
An axion insulator is a three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator (TI), in
which the bulk maintains the time-reversal symmetry or inversion symmetry but
the surface states are gapped by surface magnetization. The axion insulator
state has been observed in molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)-grown magnetically
doped TI sandwiches and exfoliated intrinsic magnetic TI MnBi2Te4 flakes with
an even number layer. All these samples have a thickness of ~10 nm, near the
2D-to-3D boundary. The coupling between the top and bottom surface states in
thin samples may hinder the observation of quantized topological
magnetoelectric response. Here, we employ MBE to synthesize magnetic TI
sandwich heterostructures and find that the axion insulator state persists in a
3D sample with a thickness of ~106 nm. Our transport results show that the
axion insulator state starts to emerge when the thickness of the middle undoped
TI layer is greater than ~3 nm. The 3D hundred-nanometer-thick axion insulator
provides a promising platform for the exploration of the topological
magnetoelectric effect and other emergent magnetic topological states, such as
the high-order TI phase.

<br>
<br>
For quantum electronics, the possibility to finely tune the properties of
magnetic topological insulators (TIs) is a key issue. We studied solid
solutions between two isostructural Z$_2$ TIs, magnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and
nonmagnetic GeBi$_2$Te$_4$, with Z$_2$ invariants of 1;000 and 1;001,
respectively. For high-quality, large mixed crystals of
Ge$_x$Mn$_{1-x}$Bi$_2$Te$_4$, we observed linear x-dependent magnetic
properties, composition-independent pairwise exchange interactions along with
an easy magnetization axis. The bulk band gap gradually decreases to zero for
$x$ from 0 to 0.4, before reopening for $x>0.6$, evidencing topological phase
transitions (TPTs) between topologically nontrivial phases and the semimetal
state. The TPTs are driven purely by the variation of orbital contributions. By
tracing the x-dependent $6p$ contribution to the states near the fundamental
gap, the effective spin-orbit coupling variation is extracted. As $x$ varies,
the maximum of this contribution switches from the valence to the conduction
band, thereby driving two TPTs. The gapless state observed at $x=0.42$ closely
resembles a Dirac semimetal above the Neel temperature and shows a magnetic gap
below, which is clearly visible in raw photoemission data. The observed
behavior of the Ge$_x$Mn$_{1-x}$Bi$_2$Te$_4$ system thereby demonstrates an
ability to precisely control topological and magnetic properties of TIs.

Quantum networks and sensing require solid-state spin-photon interfaces that
combine single-photon generation and long-lived spin coherence with scalable
device integration, ideally at ambient conditions. Despite rapid progress
reported across several candidate systems, those possessing quantum coherent
single spins at room temperature remain extremely rare. Here, we report quantum
coherent control under ambient conditions of a single-photon emitting defect
spin in a a two-dimensional material, hexagonal boron nitride. We identify that
the carbon-related defect has a spin-triplet electronic ground-state manifold.
We demonstrate that the spin coherence is governed predominantly by coupling to
only a few proximal nuclei and is prolonged by decoupling protocols. Our
results allow for a room-temperature spin qubit coupled to a multi-qubit
quantum register or quantum sensor with nanoscale sample proximity.

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are crucial for the green economy, powering
portable electronics, electric vehicles, and renewable energy systems. The
solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is vital for LIB operation, performance, and
safety. SEI forms due to thermal instability at the anode-electrolyte
interface, with electrolyte reduction products stabilizing it as an
electrochemical buffer. This article aims to enhance the parametrization of the
ReaxFF force field for accurate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of SEI in
LIBs.
Focus is on Lithium Fluoride (LiF), an inorganic salt with favorable
properties in the passivation layer. The protocol heavily relies on Python
libraries for atomistic simulations, enabling robust automation of
reparameterization steps. The proposed configurations and dataset enable the
new ReaxFF to accurately represent the solid nature of LiF and improve mass
transport property prediction in MD simulations. Optimized ReaxFF surpasses
previous force fields by adjusting lithium diffusivity, resulting in a
significant improvement in room temperature prediction by two orders of
magnitude.
However, our comprehensive investigation reveals ReaxFF's strong sensitivity
to the training set, challenging its ability to interpolate the potential
energy surface. Consequently, the current ReaxFF formulation is suitable for
modeling specific phenomena by utilizing the proposed interactive
reparameterization protocol and constructing a dataset. This work is an
important step towards refining ReaxFF for precise reactive MD simulations,
shedding light on challenges and limitations in force field parametrization.
The demonstrated limitations underscore the potential for developing more
advanced force fields through our interactive reparameterization protocol,
enabling accurate and comprehensive MD simulations in the future.

By performing first-principles calculations in conjunction with Monte Carlo
simulations, we systematically investigated the frustrated magnetic states
induced by in-plane compressive strain in LiCrTe$_{2}$. Our calculations
support that the magnetic ground state of LiCrTe$_{2}$ crystal is A-type
antiferromagnetic (AFM), with an in-plane ferromagnetic (FM) state and
interlayer AFM coupling. Furthermore, it is found that compressive strain can
significantly alter the magnetic interactions, giving rise to a transition from
an in-plane FM to an AFM state, undergoing a helimagnetic phase. Remarkably, a
highly frustrated helimagnetic state with disordered spin spirals under
moderate strain arises from the competition between spiral propagation modes
along distinct directions. In addition, various topological spin defects emerge
in this frustrated helimagnetic phase, which are assembled from various domain
wall units. These topological defects can be further tuned with external
magnetic fields. Our calculations not only uncover the origin of exotic
frustrated magnetism in triangular lattice magnetic systems, but also offer a
promising route to engineer the frustrated and topological magnetic state,
which is of significance in both fundamental research and technological
applications.

Kondo lattices are one of the classic models of strongly correlated systems
where despite a long history, a full understanding of the excitation spectra is
still not available. Here we propose that recent progress in engineering
heterostructures can be leveraged to gain insight into and even tune this
spectra. We use a strong Kondo coupling expansion to study spin-1 excitations
of a Kondo lattice in both one and two-dimension to see whether or not
paramagnons in a Kondo insulator fractionalize into spin-1/2 excitations. We
show that while paramagnons are stable in the strong Kondo coupling limit,
presence of sufficient proximity-induced superconducting pairing can favor
fractionalization. Our results can be checked using a neutron scattering study
of Kondo lattice heterostructures and paves the way toward engineering strongly
correlated electronic systems.

<br>
<br>
Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), the field of stochastic algorithms built on
the concept of sampling, has countless applications in science and technology.
The overwhelming majority of MCMC algorithms are time-reversible and satisfy
the detailed-balance condition, just like physical systems in thermal
equilibrium. The underlying Markov chains typically display diffusive dynamics,
which leads to a slow exploration of sample space. Significant speed-ups can be
achieved by non-reversible MCMC algorithms exhibiting non-equilibrium dynamics,
whose steady states exactly reproduce the target equilibrium states of
reversible Markov chains. Such algorithms have had successes in applications
but are generally difficult to analyze, resulting in a scarcity of exact
results. Here, we introduce the "lifted" TASEP (totally asymmetric simple
exclusion process) as a paradigm for lifted non-reversible Markov chains. Our
model can be viewed as a second-generation lifting of the reversible Metropolis
algorithm on a one-dimensional lattice and is exactly solvable by an unusual
kind of coordinate Bethe ansatz. We establish the integrability of the model
and present strong evidence that the lifting leads to faster relaxation than in
the KPZ universality class.

<h3>Characteristic length for pinning force density in $Nb{_3}Sn$</h3>

<br>
<br>
The pinning force density $F{_p}(J{_c},B)=J{_c} \times B$ (where $J_c$ is the
critical current density, $B$ is applied magnetic field) is one of main
quantities which characterizes the resilience of a superconductor to carry
dissipative-free transport current in applied magnetic field. Kramer (1973 J.
Appl. Phys. 44 1360) and Dew-Hughes (1974 Phil. Mag. 30 293) proposed a widely
used scaling law for the pinning force density amplitude:
$F{_p}(B)=F{_{p,max}}((p+q){^{(p+q)}}/({p^p}{q^q}))(B/B_{c2}){^p}(1-B/B{_{c2}})^q$,
where $F{_{p,max}}$, $B{_{c2}}$, $p$, and $q$ are free-fitting parameters.
Since late 1970-s till now, several research groups reported experimental data
for the dependence of $F_{p,max}$ on the average grain size, $d$, in
$Nb{_3}Sn$-based conductors. Godeke (2006 Supercond. Sci. Techn. 19 R68)
proposed that the dependence obeys the law $|F{_{p,max}}(d)|=A \times
log(1/d)+B $. However, this scaling law has several problems, for instance, the
logarithm is taken from a non-dimensionless variable, and $|F{_{p,max}}(d)|< 0
$ for large grain sizes and $|F{_{p,max}}(d)|\rightarrow \infty $ for $d
\rightarrow 0$. Here we reanalysed full inventory of publicly available
$|F{_{p,max}}(d)|$ data for $Nb{_3}Sn$ conductors and found that the dependence
can be described by $F_{p,max}(d)= F_{p,max}(0)exp(-d/{\delta})$ law, where the
characteristic length, ${\delta}$, is varying within a remarkably narrow range,
i.e. ${\delta}=(175 \pm 13) nm$, for samples fabricated by different
technologies. The interpretation of the result is based on an idea that the
in-field supercurrent is flowing within a thin surface layer (the thickness of
${\delta}$) near the grain boundary surfaces. Alternative interpretation is
that ${\delta}$ represents characteristic length for the exponentially decay
flux pinning potential from dominant defects in $Nb{_3}Sn$ superconductors,
which are grain boundaries.

We study the effect of disorder in systems having a non-trivial Euler class.
As these recently proposed multi-gap topological phases come about by braiding
non-Abelian charged band nodes residing between different bands to induce
stable pairs within isolated band subspaces, novel properties that include a
finite critical phase under the debraiding to a metal rather than a transition
point and a modified stability may be expected when the disorder preserves the
underlying $C_2\cal{T}$ or $\cal{P}\cal{T}$ symmetry on average. Employing
elaborate numerical computations, we verify the robustness of associated
topology by evaluating the changes in the average densities of states and
conductivities for different types of disorders. Upon performing a scaling
analysis around the corresponding quantum critical points we retrieve a
universality for the localization length exponent of $\nu = 1.4 \pm 0.1$ for
Euler-protected phases, relating to 2D percolation models. We generically find
that quenched disorder drives Euler semimetals into critical metallic phases.
Finally, we show that magnetic disorder can also induce topological transitions
to quantum anomalous Hall plaquettes with local Chern numbers determined by the
initial value of the Euler invariant.

This paper presents a matrix of 206 snow crystal growth observations as a
function of temperature and water vapor supersaturation in air, each
illustrating the morphology and size of a crystal forming on the tip of an
isolated c-axis ice needle after a known growth time. Because each complex
structure emerged from a simple, well-defined seed crystal under known
environmental conditions, this data set is well suited for making comparisons
with three-dimensional computational models. These observations thus provide a
needed extension of the well-known Nakaya diagram, as they allow a quantitative
evaluation of model predictions over a broad range of growth conditions. I also
briefly discuss computational methods along with an initial model of the most
relevant microphysical processes governing snow crystal growth. My overarching
goal with this new data set is to facilitate the development of quantitative
computational growth models that can eventually reproduce the remarkable
diversity of morphological structures seen in snow crystal formation.
