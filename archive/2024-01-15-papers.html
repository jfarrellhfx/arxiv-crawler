<h3>A Half-Century Research Footpath in Statistical Physics</h3>

<i>Alberto Robledo, Carlos Velarde</i>
<p>We give an abridged account of a continued string of studies in condensed
matter physics and in complex systems that span five decades. We provide links
to access abstracts and full texts of a selected list of publications. The
studies were carried out within a framework of methods and models, some
developed in situ, of stochastic processes, statistical mechanics and nonlinear
dynamics. The topics, techniques and outcomes reflect evolving interests of the
community but also show a particular character that privileges the use of
analogies or unusual viewpoints that unite the studies in distinctive ways. The
studies have been grouped into thirty sets and these, in turn, placed into
three collections according to the main underlying approach: stochastic
processes, density functional theory, and nonlinear dynamics. We discuss the
body of knowledge created by these research lines in relation to theoretical
foundations and spread of subjects. We indicate unsuspected connections
underlying different aspects of these investigations and also point out both
natural and unanticipated perspectives for future developments. Finally, we
refer to our most important and recent contribution: An answer with a firm
basis to the long standing question about the limit of validity of ordinary
statistical mechanics and the pertinence of Tsallis statistics.

<h3>Local electronic excitations by slow light ions in tungsten</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06198" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06198</a>
<br>
<i>Evgeniia Ponomareva, Eduardo Pitthan, Radek Holeňák, Jila Shams-Latifi, Glen Pádraig Kiely, Daniel Primetzhofer, Andrea Sand</i>
<p>Accurately predicting the electronic energy deposition of ions in materials
is an important challenge in both fundamental and applied research. While
employing ab initio simulations to investigate electronic stopping of ions in
matter holds promise, its combined use with experimental measurements paves the
way for obtaining reliable data. In this paper, we present a collaborative
study using real-time time-dependent density functional theory and experimental
methods to determine the electronic stopping power of hydrogen and helium ions
in tungsten, a primary candidate material for future nuclear fusion devices.
While calculated stopping powers in hyperchanneling trajectories are
significantly lower than the experimental data, off-center and random
geometries demonstrate a better agreement. We show that the deviation from
velocity proportionality for both projectiles traversing the hyperchanneling
directions can be explained through the existence of a threshold velocity
leading to the activation of semicore states. Additionally, we analyse the
pseudopotential and the trajectory dependence of computed electronic energy
losses. It is demonstrated that the role of including inner-shell electrons
varies depending on the velocity range. While these states play a crucial role
at high projectile velocities by introducing additional dissipation channels,
their impact diminishes in the low-velocity range. Finally, we introduce a
simple expression that links electronic energy losses in different trajectories
to local electron density, and we show that utilizing this formula allows for
quite accurate predictions of stopping powers around the Bragg peak.

<h3>Stochastic Sampling of Operator Growth</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06215" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06215</a>
<br>
<i>Ayush De, Umberto Borla, Xiangyu Cao, Snir Gazit</i>
<p>We put forward a Monte Carlo algorithm which samples the Euclidean time
operator growth dynamics at infinite temperature. Crucially, our approach is
free of the numerical sign problem for a range of quantum many-body spin
systems, allowing for numerically exact and unbiased calculations. We apply
this methodological headway to study the high-frequency dynamics of the
mixed-field quantum Ising model (QIM) at one and two dimensions. Our results
corroborate the recently proposed operator growth hypothesis, predicting an
exponential fall-off of generic response functions at large frequencies.
Remarkably, our calculations are sufficiently sensitive to detect subtle
logarithmic corrections of the hypothesis in one dimension. In addition, in two
dimensions, we uncover a non-trivial crossover between two large frequency
decay rates. Lastly, we find that the growth rate of the operator support size
is dominated by boundary effects, with a logarithmic correction in one
dimension.

<h3>Inducing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Topology in Twisted Nodal Superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06219" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06219</a>
<br>
<i>Kevin P. Lucht, Pavel A. Volkov, J. H. Pixley</i>
<p>Twisted nodal superconductors have been shown to exhibit chiral topological
superconductivity under broken time-reversal symmetry. Here we show how a
time-reversal preserving topological superconductivity can be induced in nodal
triplet superconductor multilayers. For a bilayer system, the application of a
Josephson spin current in triplet superconductors induces a non-zero spin Chern
number per node in momentum space. However, we show that stabilizing a
nontrivial global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant requires an odd number of layers. As
a specific example we consider trilayers with three forms of twist: chiral,
alternating and single-layer. For chiral and single-layer case, we find that a
gap opening in the dispersion leads to a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological
invariant. For single layer twists, we show how this invariant is non-trivial
when extended to an arbitrary odd number of layers.

<h3>Localized Gradual Photomediated Brightness and Lifetime Increase of  Superacid Treated Monolayer MoS$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06231" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06231</a>
<br>
<i>Kurt H. Tyson, James R. Godfrey, James M. Fraser, Robert G. Knobel</i>
<p>Monolayer semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (S-TMDs) have been
extensively studied as materials for next-generation optoelectronic devices due
to their direct band gap and high exciton binding energy at room temperature.
Under a superacid treatment of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (TFSI),
sulfur-based TMDs such as MoS$_2$ can emit strong photoluminescence (PL) with
photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) approaching unity. However, the
magnitude of PL enhancement varies by more than two orders of magnitude in
published reports. A major culprit behind the discrepancy is sulfur-based TMD's
sensitivity to above band-gap photostimulation. Here, we present a detailed
study of how TFSI-treated MoS$_2$ reacts to photostimulation with increasing PL
occurring hours after constant or pulsed laser exposure. The PL of TFSI-treated
MoS$_2$ is enhanced up to 74 times its initial intensity after 5 hours of
continuous exposure to 532nm laser light. Photostimulation also enhances the PL
of untreated MoS$_2$ but with a much smaller enhancement. Caution should be
taken when probing MoS$_2$ PL spectra as above-bandgap light can alter the
resulting intensity and peak wavelength of the emission over time. The presence
of air is verified to play a key role in the photostimulated enhancement
effect. Additionally, the rise of PL intensity is mirrored by an increase in
measured carrier lifetime of up to ~400ps consistent with the suppression of
non-radiative pathways. This work demonstrates why variations in PL intensity
are observed across samples and provides an understanding of the changes in
carrier lifetimes to better engineer next-generation optoelectronic devices.

<h3>Crowding-Regulated Binding of Divalent Biomolecules</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06232" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06232</a>
<br>
<i>Tomasz Skóra, Mathijs Janssen, Andreas Carlson, Svyatoslav Kondrat</i>
<p>Macromolecular crowding affects biophysical processes as diverse as
diffusion, gene expression, cell growth, and senescence. Yet, there is no
comprehensive understanding of how crowding affects reactions, particularly
multivalent binding. Herein, we use scaled particle theory and develop a
molecular simulation method to investigate the binding of monovalent to
divalent biomolecules. We find that crowding can increase or reduce
cooperativity--the extent to which the binding of a second molecule is enhanced
after binding a first molecule--by orders of magnitude, depending on the sizes
of the involved molecular complexes. Cooperativity generally increases when a
divalent molecule swells and then shrinks upon binding two ligands. Our
calculations also reveal that, in some cases, crowding enables binding that
does not occur otherwise. As an immunological example, we consider
Immunoglobulin G-antigen binding and show that crowding enhances its
cooperativity in bulk but reduces it when an Immunoglobulin G binds antigens on
a surface.

<h3>Density-Matrix Mean-Field Theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06236" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06236</a>
<br>
<i>Junyi Zhang, Zhengqian Cheng</i>
<p>Mean-field theories (MFTs) have proven to be efficient tools for exploring
various phases of matter, complementing alternative methods that are more
precise but also more computationally demanding. Conventional mean-field
theories (MFTs) often fall short in capturing quantum fluctuations, which
restricts their applicability to systems characterized by strong quantum
fluctuations. In this article, we propose a novel mean-field theory,
density-matrix mean-field theory (DMMFT).DMMFT constructs effective
Hamiltonians, incorporating quantum environments shaped by entanglements
quantified by the reduced density matrices. Therefore, it offers a systematic
and unbiased approach to account for effects of fluctuations and entanglements
in quantum ordered phases. As demonstrative examples, we show that DMMFT can
not only quantitatively evaluate the renormalization of order parameters
induced by quantum fluctuations but can even detect the topological order of
quantum phases. Additionally, we discuss the extensions of DMMFT for systems at
finite temperatures and those with disorders. Our work provides a novel and
efficient approach to explore phases exhibiting unconventional quantum orders,
which can be particularly beneficial for investigating frustrated spin systems
in high spatial dimensions.

<h3>Solid-state continuous time crystal with a built-in clock</h3>

<p>Time crystals (TCs) are many-body systems displaying spontaneous breaking of
time translation symmetry. Here, we demonstrate a TC using driven-dissipative
condensates of microcavity exciton-polaritons, spontaneously formed from an
incoherent particle bath. In contrast to other realizations, the TC phases can
be controlled by the power of continuous-wave non-resonant optical drive
exciting the condensate and optomechanical interactions with phonons. Those
phases are for increasing power: (i) Larmor precession of pseudo-spins - a
signature of continuous TC, (ii) locking of the frequency of precession to
self-sustained coherent phonons - stabilized TC, (iii) doubling of TC frequency
by phonons - a discrete TC with continuous excitation. These results establish
microcavity polaritons as a platform for the investigation of time-broken
symmetry in non-hermitian systems.

<h3>Nanoalignment by Critical Casimir Torques</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06260" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06260</a>
<br>
<i>Gan Wang, Piotr Nowakowski, Nima Farahmand Bafi, Benjamin Midtvedt, Falko Schmidt, Ruggero Verre, Mikael Käll, S. Dietrich, Svyatoslav Kondrat, Giovanni Volpe</i>
<p>The manipulation of microscopic objects requires precise and controllable
forces and torques. Recent advances have led to the use of critical Casimir
forces as a powerful tool, which can be finely tuned through the temperature of
the environment and the chemical properties of the involved objects. For
example, these forces have been used to self-organize ensembles of particles
and to counteract stiction caused by Casimir-Liftshitz forces. However, until
now, the potential of critical Casimir torques has been largely unexplored.
Here, we demonstrate that critical Casimir torques can efficiently control the
alignment of microscopic objects on nanopatterned substrates. We show
experimentally and corroborate with theoretical calculations and Monte Carlo
simulations that circular patterns on a substrate can stabilize the position
and orientation of microscopic disks. By making the patterns elliptical, such
microdisks can be subject to a torque which flips them upright while
simultaneously allowing for more accurate control of the microdisk position.
More complex patterns can selectively trap 2D-chiral particles and generate
particle motion similar to non-equilibrium Brownian ratchets. These findings
provide new opportunities for nanotechnological applications requiring precise
positioning and orientation of microscopic objects.

<h3>Magnetic control of Weyl nodes and wave packets in three-dimensional  warped semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06282" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06282</a>
<br>
<i>Bruno Focassio, Gabriel R. Schleder, Adalberto Fazzio, Rodrigo B. Capaz, Pedro V. Lopes, Jaime Ferreira, Carsten Enderlein, Marcello B. Silva Neto</i>
<p>We investigate the topological phase transitions driven by band warping and a
transverse magnetic field, for three-dimensional Weyl semimetals. First, we use
the Chern number as a mathematical tool to derive the topological phase
diagram. Next, we associate each of the topological sectors to a given angular
momentum state of a rotating wave packet. Then we show how the position of the
Weyl nodes can be manipulated by a transverse external magnetic field that
ultimately quenches the wave packet rotation, first partially and then
completely, thus resulting in a sequence of field-induced topological phase
transitions. Finally, we calculate the current-induced magnetization and the
anomalous Hall conductivity of a prototypical warped Weyl material. Both
observables reflect the topological transitions associated with the wave packet
rotation and can help to identify the elusive 3D quantum anomalous Hall effect
in three-dimensional, warped Weyl materials.

<h3>Bain distortion of silver thin film that exhibits fcc, bct, and  reoriented fcc structures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06319" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06319</a>
<br>
<i>Shota Ono, Koharu Tamura</i>
<p>A recent experiment reported that body-centered cubic (bcc)-structured Ag was
realized by bending face-centered cubic (fcc)-structured Ag nanowires [S. Sun
et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 015701 (2022)]. However, bcc phase was observed
only near the Ag surface. Here, we explore how the bcc phase is stabilized near
the surface by compressions. Our first-principles calculations indicate that
body-centered tetragonal (bct) rather than bcc structure is preferred due to
the surface effect. The bct-fcc boundary treated as a fixed boundary condition
is necessary to thermodynamically stabilize the bct phase. The correlation
between crystal structure and electron density-of-states is also discussed.

<h3>Direction dependent switching of carrier-type enabled by Fermi surface  geometry</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06333" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06333</a>
<br>
<i>Shuaishuai Luo, Feng Du, Dajun Su, Yongjun Zhang, Jiawen Zhang, Jiacheng Xu, Yuxin Chen, Chao Cao, Michael Smidman, Frank Steglich, Huiqiu Yuan</i>
<p>While charge carriers can typically be designated as either electron- or
hole- type, depending on the sign of the Hall coefficient, some materials defy
this straightforward classification. Here we find that LaRh$_6$Ge$_4$ goes
beyond this dichotomy, where the Hall resistivity is electron-like for magnetic
fields along the $c$-axis but hole-like in the basal plane. Together with
first-principles calculations, we show that this direction-dependent switching
of the carrier type arises within a single band, where the special geometry
leads to charge carriers on the same Fermi surface orbiting as electrons along
some directions, but holes along others. The relationship between the Fermi
surface geometry and occurrence of a Hall sign reversal is further generalized
by considering tight-binding model calculations, which show that this type of
Fermi surface corresponds to a more robust means of realizing this phenomenon,
suggesting an important route for tailoring direction dependent properties for
advanced electronic device applications.

<h3>Symmetry Lowering Through Surface Engineering and Improved  Thermoelectric Properties in MXenes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06335" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06335</a>
<br>
<i>Himangshu Murari, Subhradip Ghosh</i>
<p>Despite ample evidence of their influences on the transport properties of
two-dimensional solids, the interrelations of reduced symmetry, electronic and
thermal transport, have rarely being discussed in the context of thermoelectric
materials. With the motivation to design new thermoelectric materials with
improved properties, we have addressed these by performing first-principles
Density Functional Theory based calculations in conjunction with semi-classical
Boltzmann transport theory on a number of compounds in the MXene family. The
symmetry lowering in parent M$_{2}$CO$_{2}$ MXenes are done by replacing
transition metal $M$ on one surface, resulting in Janus compounds
MM$^{\prime}$CO$_{2}$. Our calculations show that the thermoelectric
figure-of-merit can be improved significantly by such surface engineering. We
discuss in detail, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the origin behind
high thermoelectric parameters for these compounds. Our in-depth analysis shows
that the modifications in the electronic band structures and degree of
anharmonicity driven by the dispersions in the bond strengths due to lowering
of symmetry, an artefact of surface engineering, are the factors behind the
trends in the thermoelectric parameters of the MXenes considered. The results
also substantiate that the compositional flexibility offered by the MXene
family of compounds can generate complex interplay of symmetry, electronic
structure, bond strengths and anharmonicity which can be exploited to engineer
thermoelectric materials with improved properties.

<h3>Self-consistent study of topological superconductivity in  two-dimensional quasicrystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06355" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06355</a>
<br>
<i>Masahiro Hori, Takanori Sugimoto, Takami Tohyama, K. Tanaka</i>
<p>We study two-dimensional $s$-wave topological superconductivity with Rashba
spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman field in Penrose and Ammann-Beenker
quasicrystals. By solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations self-consistently
for not only the superconducting order parameter, but also the spin-dependent
Hartree potential, we show the stable occurrence of TSC with broken
time-reversal symmetry in both Penrose and Ammann-Beenker quasicrystals. The
topological nature of the quasicrystalline system is signified by the Bott
index $B$. Topological phase transitions are found to occur, where $B$ changes
between 0 and $\pm 1$, as the chemical potential or Zeeman field is varied. In
terms of self-consistent solutions, we demonstrate the existence of a Majorana
zero mode per edge or vortex when $B=\pm 1$, consistently with the
bulk-edge/defect correspondence for periodic systems.

<h3>FeS2 monolayer: a high valence and high-$T_{\rm C}$ Ising ferromagnet</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06357" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06357</a>
<br>
<i>Ke Yang, Yaozhenghang Ma, Lu Liu, Yueyue Ning, Di Lu, Yuxuan Zhou, Zhongyao Li, Hua Wu</i>
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials are of current great interest for
their promising applications in spintronics. Strong magnetic coupling and
anisotropy are both highly desirable for the achievement of a high temperature
magnetic order. Here we propose the unusual high valent FeS$_2$ hexagonal
monolayer as such a candidate for a strong Ising 2D ferromagnet (FM), by
spin-orbital state analyses, first-principles calculations, and the
renormalized spin-wave theory (RSWT). We find that very importantly, the high
valent Fe$^{4+}$ ion is in the low-spin state ($t_{2g}^{4}$, $S$=1) with
degenerate $t_{2g}$ orbitals rather than the high-spin state
($t_{2g}^{3}e_g^{1}$, $S$=2). It is the low-spin state that allows to carry a
large perpendicular orbital moment and then produces a huge single ion
anisotropy (SIA) of 25 meV/Fe. Moreover, the negative charge transfer character
associated with the unusual high valence, strong Fe $3d$-S $3p$ hybridization,
wide bands, and a small band gap all help to establish a strong superexchange.
Indeed, our first-principles calculations confirm the strong FM superexchange
and the huge perpendicular SIA, both of which are further enhanced by a
compressive strain. Then, our RSWT calculations predict that the FM $T_{\rm C}$
is 261 K for the pristine FeS$_2$ monolayer and could be increased to 409 K
under the compressive --5\% strain. The high $T_{\rm C}$ is also reproduced by
our Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Therefore, it is worth exploring the
high-$T_{\rm C}$ Ising FMs in the high valent 2D magnetic materials with
degenerate orbitals.

<h3>Boundary phase transitions of two-dimensional quantum critical XXZ model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06365" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06365</a>
<br>
<i>Hong-Hao Song, Long Zhang</i>
<p>The boundary critical behavior of the two-dimensional (2D) quantum
antiferromagnetic(AF) XXZ model coupled with either a dangling spin-1/2 XXZ
chain or a dangling two-leg ladder on the boundary is studied with the
bosonization and renormalization group analysis. A rich boundary phase diagram
is obtained in each case. In the dangling chain case, the boundary either
develops a long-range AF order in the easy-plane or the easy-axis direction
with extraordinary critical behavior, or has a valence bond solid order with
ordinary boundary critical behavior. In the case of a dangling two-leg ladder,
besides the possible easy-plane or easy-axis AF ordered phases on the boundary
with extraordinary critical behavior, the boundary can form a singlet phase
with ordinary critical behavior without breaking any symmetry.

<h3>Universality in coupled stochastic Burgers systems with degenerate flux  Jacobian</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06399" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06399</a>
<br>
<i>Dipankar Roy, Abhishek Dhar, Konstantin Khanin, Manas Kulkarni, Herbert Spohn</i>
<p>In our contribution we study stochastic models in one space dimension with
two conservation laws. One model is the coupled continuum stochastic Burgers
equation, for which each current is a sum of quadratic non-linearities, linear
diffusion, and spacetime white noise. The second model is a two-lane stochastic
lattice gas. As distinct from previous studies, the two conserved densities are
tuned such that the flux Jacobian, a $2 \times 2$ matrix, has coinciding
eigenvalues. In the steady state, investigated are spacetime correlations of
the conserved fields and the time-integrated currents at the origin. For a
particular choice of couplings the dynamical exponent 3/2 is confirmed.
Furthermore, at these couplings, continuum stochastic Burgers equation and
lattice gas are demonstrated to be in the same universality class.

<h3>Incorporating non-local anyonic statistics into a graph decomposition</h3>

<p>In this work we describe how to systematically implement a full graph
decomposition to set up a linked-cluster expansion for the topological phase of
Kitaev's toric code in a field. This demands to include the non-local effects
mediated by the mutual anyonic statistics of elementary charge and flux
excitations. Technically, we describe how to consistently integrate such
non-local effects into a hypergraph decomposition for single excitations. The
approach is demonstrated for the ground-state energy and the elementary
excitation energies of charges and fluxes in the perturbed topological phase.

<h3>Surface charge induced $sp^3$-$sp^2$ transformation: new energy  optimization universal mechanism of (4x4) reconstruction of stoichiometric  GaN(0001) surface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06531" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06531</a>
<br>
<i>Paweł Strak, Wolfram Miller, Stanisław Krukowski</i>
<p>Ab initio calculations were applied to large size slabs simulations for
determination of the properties of the principal structures of the
stoichiometric GaN(0001) surface. The results are different from published
previously: stoichiometric GaN(0001) surface structure is characterized by
mixed structure in which 3/8 top layer Ga atoms remain in standard position
with $sp^3$ hybridized bonding while the remaining 5/8 top layer Ga atoms is
located in plane of N atoms with $sp^2$ hybridized bonding. This involves
charge transfer to the previous one, entailing energy optimization, therefore
Ga-s and Ga-p energy difference is driving force for the transition. In large
size surfaces Ga atoms create (4 x 4) reconstruction which is additionally
stabilized by strain optimization. Heavy doping in the bulk changes $sp^3$ to
$sp^2$ ratio thus confirming the charge transfer mechanism of the
reconstruction. The charge transfer energy optimization is universal for all
surfaces terminated by $sp^3$ bonded atoms.

<h3>Scanning spin probe based on magnonic vortex quantum cavities</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06549" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06549</a>
<br>
<i>Carlos A. González-Gutiérrez, David García-Pons, David Zueco, María José Martínez-Pérez</i>
<p>Performing nanoscale scanning electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) requires
three essential ingredients. First, a static magnetic field together to field
gradients to Zeeman split the electronic energy levels with spatial resolution.
Second, a radiofrequency (rf) magnetic field capable of inducing spin
transitions. Finally, a sensitive detection method to quantify the energy
absorbed by spins. This is usually achieved by combining externally applied
magnetic fields with inductive coils or cavities, fluorescent defects or
scanning probes. Here, we {\color{black} theoretically propose the realization
of a EPR scanning sensor merging all three characteristics into a single
device}: the vortex core stabilized in ferromagnetic thin-film discs. On one
hand, the vortex ground state generates a significant static magnetic field and
field gradients. On the other hand, the precessional motion of the vortex core
around its equilibrium position produces a circularly polarized oscillating
magnetic field, which is enough to produce spin transitions. Finally, the
spin-magnon coupling broadens the vortex gyrotropic frequency, {\color{black}
suggesting} a direct measure of the presence of unpaired electrons. Moreover,
the vortex core can be displaced by simply using external magnetic fields of a
few mT, enabling EPR scanning microscopy with large spatial resolution. Our
{\color{black} numerical} simulations show that, by using low damping magnets,
it is {\color{black} theoretically} possible to detect single spins located on
the disc's surface. Vortex nanocavities could also attain strong coupling to
individual spin molecular qubits, with potential applications to mediate
qubit-qubit interactions or to implement qubit readout protocols.

<h3>Exact matrix product states at the quantum Lifshitz tricritical point in  a spin-1/2 zigzag-chain antiferromagnet with anisotropic $Γ$-term</h3>

<i>Hidehiro Saito, Chisa Hotta</i>
<p>Quantum anisotropic exchange interactions in magnets can induce competitions
between phases in a different manner from those typically driven by
geometrically frustrated interactions. We study a one-dimensional spin-1/2
zigzag chain with such an interaction, $\Gamma$-term, in conjunction with the
Heisenberg interactions. We find a ground state phase diagram featuring a
multicritical point where five phases converge: a uniform ferromagnet, two
antiferromagnets, Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid and a dimer-singlet coexisting with
nematic order. This multicritical point is simultaneously quantum tricritical
and Lifshitz, and most remarkably, it hosts multi-degenerate ground state wave
functions, whose exact form is obtained in the matrix product form and its
degeneracy increases in squares of system size.

<p>Grain boundaries play a major role for electron transport in graphene sheets
grown by chemical vapor deposition. Here we investigate the electronic
structure and transport properties of idealized graphene grain boundaries (GBs)
in bi-crystals using first principles density functional theory (DFT) and
non-equilibrium Greens functions (NEGF). We generated 150 different grain
boundaries using an automated workflow where their geometry is relaxed with
DFT. We find that the GBs generally show a quasi-1D bandstructure along the GB.
We group the GBs in four classes based on their conductive properties:
transparent, opaque, insulating, and spin-polarizing and show how this is
related to angular mismatch, quantum mechanical interference, and out-of-plane
buckling. Especially, we find that spin-polarization in the GB correlates with
out-of-plane buckling. We further investigate the characteristics of these
classes in simulated scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and diffusive transport
along the GB which demonstrate how current can be guided along the GB.

<h3>Effect of the Nature of the Solid Substrate on Spatially Heterogeneous  Activated Dynamics in Glass Forming Supported Films</h3>

<p>We extend the force-level ECNLE theory to treat the spatial gradients of the
alpha relaxation time and glass transition temperature, and the corresponding
film-averaged quantities, to the geometrically asymmetric case of finite
thickness supported films with variable fluid - substrate coupling. The latter
typically nonuniversally slows down motion near the solid-liquid interface as
modeled via modification of the surface dynamic free energy caging constraints
which are spatially transferred into the film, and which compete with the
accelerated relaxation gradient induced by the vapor interface. Quantitative
applications to the foundational hard sphere fluid and a polymer melt are
presented. The strength of the effective fluid-substrate coupling has very
large consequences on the dynamical gradients and film-averaged quantities in a
film thickness and thermodynamic state dependent manner. The interference of
the dynamical gradients of opposite nature emanating from the vapor and solid
interfaces is determined, including the conditions for the disappearance of a
bulk-like region in the film center. The relative importance of surface-induced
modification of local caging versus the generic truncation of the long range
collective elastic component of the activation barrier is studied. The
conditions for the accuracy and failure of a simple superposition approximation
for dynamical gradients in thin films is also determined. The emergence of near
substrate dead layers, large gradient effects on film-averaged response
functions, and a weak non-monotonic evolution of dynamic gradients in thick and
cold films, are briefly discussed. The connection of our theoretical results to
simulations and experiments is briefly discussed, as is extension to treat more
complex glass-forming systems under nanoconfinement.

<p>Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) has been intensively utilized in 4D printing
techniques to fabricate smart structures with reversible actuation on the basis
of appropriate alignment of liquid crystal (LC) molecules. As a non-contact
alignment strategy with a controllability of orientation, magnetic-field
alignment has been rarely adapted in 4D printing of LCE because of its poor
printing efficiency and demand on large field strength. Here, we report a
digital light projection (DLP) system integrated with reorientable magnetic
field to facilely print smart LCE structures. We propose a new LCE precursor
solution that maintains a liquid crystalline nematic phase and an adequate
flowability at room temperature. The resin prior to photopolymerization can be
sufficiently aligned by a magnetic field with a strength of 500 mT in seconds
without temperature elevating or cycling. Consequential printed structures are
capable of presenting an impressive reversible thermal actuation of more than
30 %. The local and arbitrary magnetic-field alignment in layers during DLP
printing is characterized, which renders us the ability to construct smart
structures with more delicate LC alignments. Furthermore, we introduce the
selective deformation of LCE structures with programmed molecular orientation
using the photo-thermal effect. Our reported approach reveals the significant
potential for fabricating morphing structures in various fields, including soft
robotics, biomedical structures, and microelectronics. ({\dag}These authors

<h3>Pulse driven quantized current steps in ultrasmall Josephson junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06599" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06599</a>
<br>
<i>Fabian Kaap, Christoph Kissling, Victor Gaydamachenko, Lukas Grünhaupt, Sergey Lotkhov</i>
<p>Recent experimental results have validated a prediction made almost four
decades ago, affirming the existence of quantized current steps in ultrasmall
Josephson junctions and superconducting nanowires. These so-called dual Shapiro
steps hold promise for a new current standard and thus could close the quantum
metrological triangle. This is because the steps mark quantized current levels
$I=\pm n \times 2ef$, where the elementary charge $e$ is a fixed constant in
the new SI and the frequency $f$ is the physical quantity measured with the
highest precision. To realize dual Shapiro steps, we embed an
Al/AlO$_\mathrm{x}$/Al dc-SQUID in a high impedance environment made from
granular aluminium and oxidized titanium. We successfully demonstrate quantized
current steps in the IV-curves by applying sinusoidal driving signals of
frequencies up to $6\:\mathrm{GHz}$ resulting in quantized current levels up to
$I \approx \pm 2\:\mathrm{nA}$. Remarkably, if changing to a pulsed drive, the
first dual Shapiro step has a larger voltage amplitude, while the opposite step
vanishes, depending on the sign of the pulse. By using the peak values of the
differential resistance as a measure of flatness, we demonstrate improvement
due to the pulsed driving signals by a factor of $\sim 2$ compared to
sinusoidal driving.

<h3>Rapid screening of molecular beam epitaxy conditions for monoclinic  (InxGa1-x)2O3 alloys</h3>

<p>Molecular beam epitaxy is one of the highest quality growth methods, capable
of achieving theoretical material property limits and unprecedented device
performance. However, such ultimate quality usually comes at the cost of
painstaking optimization of synthesis conditions and slow experimental
iteration rates. Here we report on high-throughput molecular beam epitaxy with
rapid screening of synthesis conditions using a novel cyclical growth and
in-situ etch method. This novel approach leverages sub-oxide desorption present
during molecular beam epitaxy and as such should be broadly applicable to other
material systems. As a proof of concept, this method is applied to rapidly
investigate the growth space for the ternary alloy (InxGa1-x)2O3 on (010)
oriented beta-Ga2O3 substrates using in-situ reflection high energy electron
diffraction measurements. Two distinct growth regimes are identified and
analyzed using machine learning image recognition algorithms, the first
stabilizing a streaky 2x surface reconstruction typical of In-catalyzed
beta-Ga2O3 growth, and the second exhibiting a spotty/faceted pattern typical
of phase separation. Targeted growth of (InxGa1-x)2O3 is performed under
conditions near the boundary of the two regimes resulting in a 980 nm thick
epitaxial layer with In mole fraction up to 5.6%. The cyclical growth/etch
method retains the ~1 nm surface roughness of the single crystal substrate,
increases experimental throughput approximately 6x, and improves single crystal
substrate utilization by >40x. The high-throughput MBE method enables rapid
discovery of growth regimes for ultra-wide bandgap oxide alloys for power
conversion devices operating with high efficiency at high voltages and
temperatures, as well as optical devices such as ultraviolet photodetectors.

<i>Subhomoy Haldar, David Barker, Harald Havir, Antti Ranni, Sebastian Lehmann, Kimberly A. Dick, Ville F. Maisi</i>
<p>The growing interest in quantum information has enabled the manipulation and
readout of microwave photon states with high fidelities. The presently
available microwave photon counters, based on superconducting circuits, are
limited to non-continuous pulsed mode operation, requiring additional steps for
qubit state preparation before an actual measurement. Here, we present a
continuous microwave photon counter based on superconducting cavity-coupled
semiconductor quantum dots. The device utilizes photon-assisted tunneling in a
double quantum dot with tunneling events being probed by a third dot. Our
device detects both single and multiple-photon absorption events independently,
thanks to the energy tunability of a two-level double-dot absorber. We show
that the photon-assisted tunnel rates serve as the measure of the cavity photon
state in line with the P(E) theory - a theoretical framework delineating the
mediation of the cavity photon field via a two-level environment. We further
describe the single photon detection using the Jaynes-Cummings input-output
theory and show that it agrees with the P(E) theory predictions.

<h3>Capturing short-range order in high-entropy alloys with machine learning  potentials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06622" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06622</a>
<br>
<i>Yifan Cao, Killian Sheriff, Rodrigo Freitas</i>
<p>Chemical short-range order (SRO) affects the distribution of elements
throughout the solid-solution phase of metallic alloys, thereby modifying the
background against which microstructural evolution occurs. Investigating such
chemistry-microstructure relationships requires atomistic models that act at
the appropriate length scales while capturing the intricacies of chemical bonds
leading to SRO. Here we consider various approaches for the construction of
training data sets for machine learning potentials (MLPs) for CrCoNi and
evaluate their performance in capturing SRO and its effects on materials
quantities of relevance for mechanical properties, such as stacking-fault
energy and phase stability. It is demonstrated that energy accuracy on test
sets often does not correlate with accuracy in capturing material properties,
which is fundamental in enabling large-scale atomistic simulations of metallic
alloys with high physical fidelity. Based on this analysis we systematically
derive design principles for the rational construction of MLPs that capture SRO
in the crystal and liquid phases of alloys.

<h3>A Ginzburg-Landau approach to the vortex-domain wall interaction in  superconductors with nematic order</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06639" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06639</a>
<br>
<i>Ramiro Severino, Pablo Mininni, Eduardo Fradkin, Victoria Bekeris, Gabriela Pasquini, Gustavo Lozano</i>
<p>In this work we study the interaction between vortices and nematic domain
walls within the framework of a Ginzburg Landau approach. The free energy of
the system is written in terms of a complex order parameter characteristic of
$s$-wave superconductivity and a real (Ising type) order parameter associated
to nematicity. The interaction between both order parameters is described by a
biquadratic and a trilinear derivative term. To study the effects of these
interactions we solve the time-dependent dissipative Ginzburg Landau equations
using a highly performant pseudospectral method by which we calculate the
trajectories of a vortex that, for different coupling parameters, is either
attracted or repelled by a wall, as well as of the wall dynamics. We show that
despite its simplicity, this theory displays many phenomena observed
experimentally in Fe-based superconductors. In particular we find that the sign
of the biquadratic term determines the attractive (pining) or repulsive
(antipining) character of the interaction, as observed in FeSe and BaFeCoAs
compounds respectively. The trilinear term is responsible for the elliptical
shape of vortex cores as well as for the orientation of the axes of the
ellipses and vortex trajectories with respect to the axes of the structural
lattice. For the case of pining, we show that the vortex core is well described
by a heart-shaped structure in agreement with STM experiments performed in
FeSe.

<h3>Superorders and acoustic modes folding in BiFeO$_3$/LaFeO$_3$  superlattices</h3>

<p>Superlattices are materials created by the alternating growth of two
chemically different materials. The direct consequence of creating a
superlattice is the folding of the Brillouin zone which gives rise to
additional electronic bands and phonon modes. This has been successfully
exploited to achieve new transport and optical properties in semiconductor
superlattices, for example. Here, we show that multiferroic BiFeO$_3$/LaFeO$_3$
superlattices are more than just periodic chemical stacking. Using transmission
electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and first-principles calculations, we
demonstrate the existence of a new order of FeO$_6$ octahedra, with a period
along the growth direction about twice that of the chemical supercell, i.e. a
superorder. The effect of this new structural order on the lattice dynamics is
studied with ultrafast optical pump-probe experiments. While a mode at 1.2 THz
is attributed solely to the chemical modulation of the superlattice, the
existence of another 0.7 THz mode seems to be explained only by a double
Brillouin zone folding in agreement with the structural description. Our work
shows that multiferroic BiFeO$_3$/LaFeO$_3$ superlattices can be used to tune
the spectrum of coherent THz phonons, and potentially that of magnons or
electromagnons.

<h3>Confinement determines transport of a reaction-diffusion active matter  front</h3>

<p>Couplings between biochemical and mechanical processes have a profound impact
on embryonic development. However, in-vitro studies capable of quantifying
these interactions have remained elusive. Here, we investigate a synthetic
system where a DNA reaction-diffusion (RD) front is advected by a turbulent
flow generated by active matter (AM) flows in a quasi-one-dimensional geometry.
Whereas the dynamics of simple RD fronts solely depend on the reaction and
diffusion rates, we show that RD-AM front propagation is also influenced by the
confinement geometry. We first experimentally dissected the different
components of the reaction-diffusion-advection process by knocking out reaction
or advection and observed how RD-AM allows for faster transport over large
distances, avoiding dilution. We then show how confinement impacts active
matter flow: while changes in instantaneous flow velocities are small;
correlation times are dramatically increased with decreasing confinement. As a
result, RD-AM front speed increased 3 to 9-fold compared to a RD one. This
RD-AM experimental model provides a framework for the rational engineering of
complex spatiotemporal processes observed in living systems. It will reinforce
our understanding of how macro-scale patterns and structures emerge from
microscopic components in non-equilibrium systems.

<h3>Magnetic properties of van der Waals layered single crystals DyOBr and  SmOCl</h3>

<i>Feihao Pan, Jiale Huang, Chenglin Shang, Bingxian Shi, Jianfei Qin, Hongliang Wang, Lijie Hao, Jinchen Wang, Juanjuan Liu, Daye Xu, Hongxia Zhang, Peng Cheng</i>
<p>Two-dimensional van der Waals single crystals DyOBr and SmOCl have been grown
by flux method and their anisotropic magnetic properties are reported. DyOBr
orders antiferromagnetically at T$_{N}$=9.5~K with magnetic moments lying along
$a$-axis, similar as DyOCl. Its magnetic susceptibility shows anisotropic
anomalies at T$^{*}$=30~K possibly due to the crystal field effect. Furthermore
a fractional magnetization plateau is clearly observed under H$\parallel$a and
H$\parallel$[110], which suggests the existence of a possible field-induced
quantum magnetic state. On the other hand, isostructural SmOCl undergoes
antiferromagnetic transition at T$_{N}$=7.3~K and exhibits an Ising-like
perpendicular $c$-axis magnetic anisotropy, which could be well explained by
our crystal field calculations. Both DyOBr and SmOCl are insulators with band
gap of $\sim$5~eV, our results suggest they are promising in building van der
Waals heterostructures and applications in multifunctional devices.
