<h3>Hydrodynamics of a relativistic charged fluid in the presence of a  periodically modulated chemical potential</h3>

We study charged hydrodynamics in a periodic lattice background. Fluctuations
are Bloch waves rather than single momentum Fourier modes. At boundaries of the
unit cell where hydrodynamic fluctuations are formally degenerate with their
Umklapped copy, level repulsion occurs. Novel mode mixings between charge,
sound, and their Umklapped copies appear at finite chemical potential -- both
at zero and finite momentum. We provide explicit examples for an ionic lattice,
i.e. a periodic external chemical potential, and verify our results with
numerical computations in fluid-gravity duality.

Thermodynamics of glassy states in a quasi-two-dimensional frustrated magnet
Ba$_2$Sn$_2$ZnCr$_{7p}$Ga$_{10-7p}$O$_{22}$ where $p$ is the spin density are
investigated experimentally. The system features a triangular network of
bipyramids of spins with the quantum spin number $s = 3/2$. The DC magnetic
susceptibility measurements on a series of samples with $0.44 \le p \le 0.98$
show a freezing transition with the transition temperature $T_\mathrm{f} \le
1.2$ K. $T_\mathrm{f}$ is found to decrease with decreasing $p$. The low-lying
excitations in the glassy state of the system are examined via the temperature
dependence of the magnetic heat capacity and are shown to consist of two
components: the hydrodynamic Halperin-Saslow modes characteristic of a spin jam
and the two-level systems of a spin glass. A continuous crossover between the
two glassy states is observed via the varying weights of the two components as
the spin density is varied. The $p$ dependence of the spin jam's zero-point
entropy determined from the exotic perimeter-scaling behavior combined with the
observed zero-point entropy of the samples provides the $p$ dependence of the
spin glass's zero-point entropy. The obtained result shows that the
correlations between orphan spins begin below $p \sim 0.8$, the limit that was
also found using a neutron scattering technique in a previous report on the
isostructural compound SrCr$_{9p}$Ga$_{12-9p}$O$_{19}$. The domain size of the
spin-jam state estimated from the value of the zero-point entropy for the
cleanest sample is approximately $4 \times 4$ bipyramids, about 2.5 times the
measured spin correlation length.

<h3>Island Hopping of active colloids</h3>

Individual self-propelled colloidal particles, like active Brownian particles
(ABP) or run-and-tumble swimmers (RT), exhibit characteristic and well-known
motion patterns. However, their interaction with obstacles remains an open and
important problem. We here investigate the two-dimensional motion of
silica-gold Janus particles (JP) actuated by AC electric fields and suspended
and cruising through silica particles organized in rafts by mutual phoretic
attraction. A typical island contains dozens of particles. The JP travels
straight in obstacle-free regions and reorients systematically upon approaching
an island. As an underlying mechanism, we tentatively propose a hydrodynamic
torque exerted by the solvent flow towards the islands on the JP local flow
field, leading to an alignment of respective solvent flow directions. This
systematic behavior is in contrast with the reorientation observed for free
active Brownian particles and run-and-tumble microswimmers.

<h3>$d$-wave Charge-$4e$ Superconductivity From Fluctuating Pair Density  Waves</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17631" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17631</a>
<br>
<i>Yi-Ming Wu, Yuxuan Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work we show that in several microscopic models for the
pair-density-wave (PDW) state, when the PDW wave vectors connect special parts
of the Fermi surface, the predominant instability driven by PDW fluctuations is
toward a pairing state of the PDW boson themselves{, realizing a
long-saught-after charge-$4e$ superconductor. Dual to the scenario for electron
pairing, the effective attraction between the bosons is mediated by exchanging
low-energy fermions.} In particular we show that the pairing interaction for
the charge-$4e$ order is repulsive in the $s$-wave channel but attractive in
the $d$-wave one. By analyzing the Ginzburg-Landau free energy including the
fluctuation effects of PDW, within a large-$M$ extension of the theory, we find
that the charge-$4e$ superconductivity emerges as a vestigial order of PDW, and
sets in via a first-order transition.

<h3>Interplay of many-body interactions and quasiperiodic disorder in the  all-band-flat diamond chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17633" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17633</a>
<br>
<i>Aamna Ahmed, Nilanjan Roy, Auditya Sharma</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the effects of quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr\'e (AA) disorder and
interactions on a one-dimensional all-band-flat (ABF) diamond chain. We
consider the application of disorder in two ways: a symmetric one, where the
same disorder is applied to the top and bottom sites of a unit cell, and an
antisymmetric one, where the disorder applied to the top and bottom sites are
of equal magnitude but with opposite signs. The single-particle wave-packet
dynamics for the clean system and when the disorder is applied symmetrically
show quantum caging; in the antisymmetric case, the wave-packet spreads over
the entire lattice. These results agree with our previous work, where compact
localization was observed in the case of the clean system and for symmetrically
disordered diamond lattices. In the presence of nearest-neighbour interactions,
nonergodic phases are observed in the case of a clean system and symmetrical
disorder; at higher disorder strengths, we find an MBL-like phase in the
symmetric case. However, many-body non-equilibrium dynamics of the system from
carefully engineered initial states exhibit quantum caging. In the
antisymmetric case, a nonergodic mixed phase, a thermal phase and an MBL-like
phases, respectively, are observed at low, intermediate and high disorder
strengths. We observe an absence of caging and initial state dependence (except
at the intermediate disorder strength) in the study of non-equilibrium
dynamics.

<h3>Incommensurability-Induced Enhancement of Superconductivity in One  Dimensional Critical Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17656" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17656</a>
<br>
<i>Ricardo Oliveira, Miguel Gon√ßalves, Pedro Ribeiro, Eduardo V. Castro, Bruno Amorim</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that incommensurability can enhance superconductivity in one
dimensional quasiperiodic systems with s-wave pairing. As a parent model, we
use a generalized Aubry-Andr\'e model that includes quasiperiodic modulations
both in the potential and in the hoppings. In the absence of interactions, the
model contains extended, critical and localized phases for incommensurate
modulations. Our results reveal that in a substantial region inside the parent
critical phase, there is a significant increase of the superconducting critical
temperature compared to the extended phase and the uniform limit without
quasiperiodic modulations. We also analyse the results for commensurate
modulations with period close to the selected incommensurate one. We find that
while in the commensurate case, the scaling of the critical temperature with
interaction strength follows the exponentially small weak-coupling BCS
prediction for a large enough system size, it scales algebraically in the
incommensurate case within the critical and localized parent phases. These
qualitatively distinct behaviors lead to a significant
incommensurability-induced enhancement of the critical temperature in the weak
and intermediate coupling regimes, accompanied by an increase in the
superconducting order parameter at zero temperature.

<h3>Ising Model for the Freezing Transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17662" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17662</a>
<br>
<i>Jacobo Troncoso, Claudio A. Cerdeiri√±a</i>
<br>
<br>
A spin-1 Ising model incorporating positional order to a standard lattice gas
with no attractive interactions is introduced and found to be consistent with
all known attributes of the freezing transition of the hard-sphere system.
Implementation of attractive interactions in a fairly natural way then allows
every aspect of the phase diagram of a simple substance to be reproduced. The
\emph{whole} phase behavior of such sort of substances is thus found to sharply
manifest the van der Waals picture highlighting the relevance of harsh
repulsive forces.

<h3>Triply degenerate nodal line and tunable contracted-drumhead surface  state in a tight-binding model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17669" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17669</a>
<br>
<i>Yi-Ru Wang, Gui-Bin Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
The study of topological semimetals has been extended to more general
topological nodal systems such as metamaterials and artificial periodic
structures. Among various nodal structures, triply degenerate nodal line (TNL)
is rare and hence lack of attention. In this work, we have proposed a simple
tight-binding model which hosts a topological non-trivial TNL. This TNL not
only has the drumhead surface states as usual nodal line systems, but also has
surface states which form a contracted-drumhead shape. And the shape and area
of this contracted-drumhead can be tuned by the hopping parameters of the
model. This provides an effective way to modulate surface states as well as
their density of states, which can be important in future applications of
topological nodal systems.

<h3>On the equivocal nature of the mass absorption curves</h3>

<i>Pawel Rochowski</i>
<br>
<br>
The idea behind the research presented is based upon apparently contradictory
experimental results obtained here by means of photoacoustics modalities for
the same drug donor/acceptor membrane system, serving as a surrogate for a
transdermal delivery system. The first modality allowed for the monitoring of
the total amount of mass uptake (m(t)-type data), while the second technique
allowed for the quantification of time-dependent concentration distribution
within the acceptor membrane (c(x,t)-type data). Despite of a very good
agreement between the m(t) data and the 1st-order uptake fitting model
(standard Fickian diffusion with constant source boundary condition), the
standard approach failed during the c(x,t) data analysis. The results led to
the analysis of the interfacial transfer contribution to the overall mass
transfer efficiency, which eventually allowed to question reliability of the
m(t) data analysis for the determination and quantification of the mass
transport parameters. A more detailed analysis of the c(x,t) by means of the
newly introduced transport rate number parameter revealed, that the mass uptake
by the acceptor is almost equally influenced by interfacial and bulk transport
processes. The analyses performed were translated into a model-free
characteristic times, i.e. parameters common for any of the model scheme used.

<h3>Unified Theory of Hastatic order and Antiferromagnetism in URu$_2$Si$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17686" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17686</a>
<br>
<i>Milan Kornjaƒça, Rebecca Flint</i>
<br>
<br>
The hidden order phase of URu$_2$Si$_2$ has eluded identification for over
thirty-five years. A compelling proposal that explains the Ising heavy-fermion
nature of the material is \emph{hastatic order}: a symmetry breaking
heavy-Fermi liquid arising from a spinorial microscopic hybridization. The
original hastatic proposal cannot microscopically model the pressure induced
antiferromagnetic phase; and while it predicts a spinorial order parameter, it
does not provide any detectable signatures of the spinorial nature. Here, we
present a more realistic microscopic model of hastatic order in URu$_2$Si$_2$
based on two conducting electron bands and explore its phase diagram in detail.
Our model non-trivially preserves the Ising heavy-fermion physics of the
original, while allowing us to tune between the antiferromagnet and hidden
order using pressure analogues and magnetic field. Our model is also consistent
with recent phenomenological predictions of not one, but two vector order
parameters associated with the spinorial order that provide the first
microscopic predictions for detecting the spinorial nature.

<h3>Observation of Wigner cusps in a metallic carbon nanotube</h3>

<br>
<br>
Previous gate-dependent conductance measurements of metallic carbon nanotubes
have revealed unexplainable conductance suppressions, occurring at two
different gate voltages. These were previously attributed to the
gate-dependency of contact resistance. Our gate-dependent conductivity
measurements on a metallic nanotube with known chirality show that these
bimodal conductance suppressions are the manifestations of Wigner cusps, often
seen in atomic and nuclear physics experiments.

<h3>A Virtual Diffractometer For Creating Synthetic HEDM Images of  Tessellated and Meshed Finite Element Polycrystals</h3>

To assist in the planning of in situ loading, HEDM experiments by generating
synthetic diffraction images of virtual samples in loaded and unloaded states.
The user designates a target grain in the virtual sample and specifies the set
of reflections for which images are to be generated. The code generates several
intermediate images, including: (1) the points of intersection between the
diffracted beam direction vector the detector plane; (2) reflection-dependent
frequency distributions of the diffraction angle, $\omega$; and (3) plots of
the diffraction volume-weighted intensity distributions for the specified set
of reflections. The final sets of plots are facsimiles of pixelated detector
images which take into account characteristics of specific detectors, including
its pixel size and point spread behavior.

<h3>Bayes-optimal inference for spreading processes on random networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17704" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17704</a>
<br>
<i>D. Ghio, A. L. M. Aragon, I. Biazzo, L. Zdeborova</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider a class of spreading processes on networks, which generalize
commonly used epidemic models such as the SIR model or the SIS model with a
bounded number of re-infections. We analyse the related problem of inference of
the dynamics based on its partial observations. We analyse these inference
problems on random networks via a message-passing inference algorithm derived
from the Belief Propagation (BP) equations. We investigate whether said
algorithm solves the problems in a Bayes-optimal way, i.e. no other algorithm
can reach a better performance. For this, we leverage the so-called Nishimori
conditions that must be satisfied by a Bayes-optimal algorithm. We also probe
for phase transitions by considering the convergence time and by initializing
the algorithm in both a random and an informed way and comparing the resulting
fixed points. We present the corresponding phase diagrams. We find large
regions of parameters where even for moderate system sizes the BP algorithm
converges and satisfies closely the Nishimori conditions, and the problem is
thus conjectured to be solved optimally in those regions. In other limited
areas of the space of parameters, the Nishimori conditions are no longer
satisfied and the BP algorithm struggles to converge. No sign of a phase
transition is detected, however, and we attribute this failure of optimality to
finite-size effects. The article is accompanied by a Python implementation of
the algorithm that is easy to use or adapt.

<h3>Measuring response functions of active materials from data</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
From flocks of birds to biomolecular assemblies, systems in which many
individual components independently consume energy to perform mechanical work
exhibit a wide array of striking behaviors. Methods to quantify the dynamics of
these so called active systems generally aim to extract important length or
time scales from experimental fields. Because such methods focus on extracting
scalar values, they do not wring maximal information from experimental data. We
introduce a method to overcome these limitations. We extend the framework of
correlation functions by taking into account the internal headings of
displacement fields. The functions we construct represent the material response
to specific types of active perturbation within the system. Utilizing these
response functions we query the material response of disparate active systems
composed of actin filaments and myosin motors, from model fluids to living
cells. We show we can extract critical length scales from the turbulent flows
of an active nematic, anticipate contractility in an active gel, distinguish
viscous from viscoelastic dissipation, and even differentiate modes of
contractility in living cells. These examples underscore the vast utility of
this method which measures response functions from experimental observations of
complex active systems.

<h3>Spin-polarized saddle points in the topological surface states of the  elemental Bismuth revealed by a pump-probe spin-resolved ARPES</h3>

<br>
<br>
We use a pump-probe, spin-, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) with a 10.7 eV laser accessible up to the Brillouin zone edge, and
reveal for the first time the entire band structure, including the unoccupied
side, for the elemental bismuth (Bi) with the spin-polarized surface states.
Our data identify Bi as in a strong topological insulator phase ($Z_2$=1)
against the prediction of most band calculations. We unveil that the unoccupied
topological surface states possess spin-polarized saddle points yielding the
van Hove singularity, providing an excellent platform for the future
development of opto-spintronics.

<h3>Impact of extended long-range electrostatics on the correlation of  liquid-liquid equilibria in aqueous ionic liquid systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17831" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17831</a>
<br>
<i>Hugo Marques, Andr√©s Gonz√°lez de Castilla, Simon M√ºller, Irina Smirnova</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently an improved long-range model for electrolyte solutions was developed
that is applicable from infinite dilution to pure salt. This paper tests this
claim for the first time applying it to the calculation of liquid-liquid
equilibria for mixtures of different ionic liquids (ILs) and water. The
conventional Pitzer-Debye-H\"uckel (PDH) equation is compared to two of its
new, thermodynamically consistent extensions. Both development stages, the
extended PDH term and the modified-extended PDH, account for concentration
dependent mixture properties instead of using solvent properties. The latter
one additionally introduces a modified parameter of closest approach which
improves the overall performance of the model for high electrolyte
concentrations in systems with variable or low permittivities. To account for
the short-range interactions, these long-range models are coupled with the
UNIversal QUAsi-Chemical (UNIQUAC) model. Three modeling strategies were tested
for the short-range contribution. First, the UNIQUAC parameters were adjusted
to each system individually, then the binary interaction parameters were the
same for each binary interaction type for all the systems and lastly a linear
function of the carbon number was used where possible. For all systems and all
modeling strategies tested, the predictive performance increased from PDH to
E-PDH and then to ME-PDH. Overall, an introduction of concentration dependent
properties and the modification added to ME-PDH enhanced modeling performance
when describing these systems, showing the general applicability of this novel
longrange term.

<h3>Singular flat bands in the modified Haldane-Dice model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17850" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17850</a>
<br>
<i>Alexander Filusch, Holger Fehske</i>
<br>
<br>
Flat bands can be divided into singular and non-singular ones according to
the behavior of their Bloch wave function around band-crossing points in
momentum space. We analyze the flat band in the Dice model, which can be tuned
by a uniaxial strain in the zigzag direction and a Haldane-type next-nearest
neighbor interaction, and derive the topological phase diagram of the modified
Haldane-Dice model to obtain all band-gap closings with the central band. When
the central band is flat, we determine its compact localized state and classify
its behavior at all band-touching points by means of the Hilbert-Schmidt
quantum distance. We find that the flat band remains singular for all
band-touching points (topological phase transitions) with a maximal quantum
distance and give expressions for the resulting non-contractible loop states on
the real-space torus.

<h3>Control of the Bright-Dark Exciton Splitting using Lamb Shift in a 2D  Semiconductor</h3>

<br>
<br>
We have investigated the exciton fine structure in atomically thin WSe2
-based van der Waals heterostructures where the density of optical modes at the
location of the semiconductor monolayer can be tuned. The energy splitting
$\Delta$ between the bright and dark exciton has been measured by
photoluminescence spectroscopy. We demonstrate that $\Delta$ can be tuned by a
few meV, as a result of a significant Lamb shift of the optically active
exciton which arises from emission and absorption of virtual photons triggered
by the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. We also measured
strong variations of the bright exciton radiative linewidth, as a result of the
Purcell effect. All these experimental results illustrate the strong
sensitivity of the excitons to local vacuum field. We found a very good
agreement with a model that demonstrates the equivalence, for our system, of a
classical electrodynamical transfer matrix formalism and
quantum-electrodynamical approach. The bright-dark splitting control
demonstrated here should apply to any semiconductor structures.

<br>
<br>
Excitons are two-particle correlated bound states that are formed due to
Coulomb interaction between single-particle holes and electrons. In the
solid-state, cooperative interactions with surrounding quasiparticles can
strongly tailor the exciton properties and potentially even create new
correlated states of matter. It is thus highly desirable to access such
cooperative and correlated exciton behavior on a fundamental level. Here, we
find that the ultrafast transfer of an exciton's hole across a type-II
band-aligned moir\'e heterostructure leads to a surprising sub-200-fs upshift
of the single-particle energy of the electron being photoemitted from the
two-particle exciton state. While energy relaxation usually leads to an
energetic downshift of the spectroscopic signature, we show that this unusual
upshift is a clear fingerprint of the correlated interactions of the electron
and hole parts of the exciton quasiparticle. In this way, time-resolved
photoelectron spectroscopy is straightforwardly established as a powerful
method to access exciton correlations and cooperative behavior in
two-dimensional quantum materials. Our work highlights this new capability and
motivates the future study of optically inaccessible correlated excitonic and
electronic states in moir\'e heterostructures.

<h3>Analytic modelling of Quantum Capacitance and Carrier Concentration for  $Œ≤_{12}$-Borophene FET based Gas Sensor</h3>

<i>Nimisha Dutta, Reeta Devi, Arindam Boruah, Saumen Acharjee</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we investigate the physical and electronic properties of
$\beta_{12}$-borophene FET-based gas sensor using a theoretical quantum
capacitance model based on tight-binding approach. We study the impact of
adsorbed NH$_3$, NO, NO$_2$ and CO gas molecule on its density of states,
carrier concentration, quantum capacitance and I-V characteristics. We found a
remarkable variation in the energy band structure and the density of states
(DOS) of the $\beta_{12}$-borophene in the presence of the adsorbed gas
molecule. The appearance of non-identical Van-Hove singularities in the DOS in
the presence of adsorbed gas molecules strongly indicates the high sensitivity
of $\beta_{12}$-borophene. We found a significant increase in the carrier
concentration for NH$_3$ gas while it decreases for all other gases. Moreover,
a drastic change in quantum capacitance and current-voltage relation is also
observed in adsorbed gases. The different properties of the given gas molecules
are compared with the pristine borophene and found to exhibit distinct wrinkles
in each case, thereby indicating the strong selectivity of our proposed gas
sensor. Though $\beta_{12}$ - borophene is found to be highly sensitive for all
studied gases, the NO gas is found to be most sensitive compared to the others.

Inspired by the swarming or flocking of animal systems we study groups of
agents moving in unbounded 2D space. Individual trajectories derive from a
``bottom-up'' principle: individuals reorient to maximise their future path
entropy over environmental states. This can be seen as a proxy for keeping
options open, a principle that may confer evolutionary fitness in an uncertain
world. We find an ordered (co-aligned) state naturally emerges, as well as
disordered states or rotating clusters; similar phenotypes are observed in
birds, insects and fish, respectively. The ordered state exhibits an
order-disorder transition under two forms of noise: (i) standard additive
orientational noise, applied to the post-decision orientations (ii)
``cognitive'' noise, overlaid onto each individual's model of the future paths
of other agents. Unusually, the order increases at low noise, before later
decreasing through the order-disorder transition as the noise increases
further.

<br>
<br>
Here, we investigate the role of the interlayer magnetic ordering of CrSBr in
the framework of $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations and by using optical
spectroscopy techniques. These combined studies allow us to unambiguously
determine the nature of the optical transitions. In particular,
photoreflectance measurements, sensitive to the direct transitions, have been
carried out for the first time. We have demonstrated that optically induced
band-to-band transitions visible in optical measurement are remarkably well
assigned to the band structure by the momentum matrix elements and energy
differences for the magnetic ground state (A-AFM). In addition, our study
reveals significant differences in electronic properties for two different
interlayer magnetic phases. When the magnetic ordering of A-AFM to FM is
changed, the crucial modification of the band structure reflected in the
direct-to-indirect band gap transition and the significant splitting of the
conduction bands along the $\Gamma-Z$ direction are obtained. In addition,
Raman measurements demonstrate a splitting between the in-plane modes
$B^2_{2g}$/$B^2_{3g}$, which is temperature dependent and can be assigned to
different interlayer magnetic states, corroborated by the DFT+U study.
Moreover, the $B^2_{2g}$ mode has not been experimentally observed before.
Finally, our results point out the origin of interlayer magnetism, which can be
attributed to electronic rather than structural properties. Our results reveal
a new approach for tuning the optical and electronic properties of van der
Waals magnets by controlling the interlayer magnetic ordering in adjacent
layers.

<br>
<br>
We study the static properties of a mobile impurity interacting with a bath
with a few distinguishable particles trapped in a one-dimensional harmonic
trap. We focus on the limiting case where the bath is non-interacting. We
provide numerical results for the energy spectra and density profiles by means
of the exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and find that these systems
show non-trivial solutions, even in the limit of infinite repulsion. A detailed
physical interpretation is provided for the lowest energy states. In
particular, we find a seemingly universal transition from the impurity being
localized in the center of the trap to being expelled outside the majority
cloud. A mean-field approach is developed which captures the transition.

<h3>Neutral band gap of Carbon by Quantum Monte Carlo methods</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present a method to calculate the energy gap of a charge-neutral
excitation using only ground-state calculations. We report Quantum Monte Carlo
calculations of $\Gamma\rightarrow\Gamma$ and $\Gamma\rightarrow X$
particle-hole excitation energies in diamond carbon. We analyze the finite-size
effect and find the same $1/L$ decay rate as that in a charged excitation,
where L is the linear extension of the supercell. This slow decay is attributed
to the delocalized nature of the excitation in supercells too small to
accommodate excitonic binding effects. At larger system sizes the apparent
$1/L$ decay crosses over to a $1/L^3$ behavior. Estimating the scale of exciton
binding can be used to correct finite-size effects of neutral gaps.

<br>
<br>
In polarizable materials, electronic charge carriers interact with the
surrounding ions, leading to quasiparticle behaviour. The resulting polarons
play a central role in many materials properties including electrical
transport, optical properties, surface reactivity and magnetoresistance, and
polaron properties are typically investigated indirectly through such
macroscopic characteristics. Here, noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM)
is used to directly image polarons in Fe2O3 at the single quasiparticle limit.
A combination of Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and kinetic Monte Carlo
(KMC) simulations shows that Ti doping dramatically enhances the mobility of
electron polarons, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate
that a metallic transition state is responsible for the enhancement. In
contrast, hole polarons are significantly less mobile and their hopping is
hampered further by the introduction of trapping centres.

We theoretically propose that hexagonal silicon-based crystals, $P6/m$-Si$_6$
and $P6/m$-NaSi$_6$, are topological Dirac semimetals with superconducting
critical temperatures of 12 K and 13 K, respectively, at ambient pressure. Band
inversion occurs with the Fu-Kane topological invariant $\mathbb{Z}_2=1$, even
in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. The Dirac nodes protected by $C_6$
crystal rotational symmetry remain gapless with spin-orbit coupling. Using
first-principles calculations, we find pressure-induced topological phase
transitions for $P6/m$-Si$_6$ and $P6/m$-NaSi$_6$ with critical external
pressures of 11.5 GPa and 14.9 GPa, respectively. Above the critical pressures,
the Dirac bands are gapped with $\mathbb{Z}_2=0$, while the superconducting
states and the crystal symmetries are retained.Our results may shed light into
a search for silicon-based topological materials with superconductivity.

<h3>Topological paramagnetic excitons of localized f electrons on the  honeycomb lattice</h3>

<br>
<i>Alireza Akbari, Burkhard Schmidt, Peter Thalmeier</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the dispersive paramagnetic excitons on the honeycomb lattice
that originate from the crystalline-electric field (CEF) split localized
f-electron states in the paramagnetic state due to intersite exchange. We start
with a symmetry analysis of possible Ising-type singlet-singlet and xy-type
singlet-doublet models. The former supports only symmetric intersite-exchange
while the latter additionally allows for antisymmetric Dzyaloshinski-Moriya
(DM) exchange interactions. We calculate the closed expressions for magnetic
exciton dispersion using both response function formalism and the bosonic
Bogoliubov approach. We do this for the most general model that shows inversion
symmetry breaking on the honeycomb lattice but also discuss interesting special
cases. By calculating Berry curvatures and Chern numbers of paramagnetic
excitons we show that the xy model supports nontrivial topological states in a
wide range of parameters. This leads to the existence of excitonic topological
edge states with Dirac dispersion lying in the zone boundary gap without the
presence of magnetic order.

<h3>PYATB: An Efficient Python Package for Electronic Structure Calculations  Using Ab Initio Tight-Binding Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18004" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18004</a>

<i>Gan Jin, ongsheng Pang, Yuyang Ji, Zujian Dai, Lixin He</i>
<br>
<br>
We present PYATB, a Python package designed for computing band structures and
related properties of materials using the ab initio tight-binding Hamiltonian.
The Hamiltonian is directly obtained after conducting self-consistent
calculations with first-principles packages using numerical atomic orbital
(NAO) bases, such as ABACUS. The package comprises three modules: Bands,
Geometric, and Optical. In the Bands module, one can calculate essential
properties of band structures, including the partial density of states (PDOS),
fat bands, Fermi surfaces, and Weyl/Dirac points. The band unfolding method is
utilized to obtain the energy band spectra of a supercell by projecting the
electronic structure of the supercell onto the Brillouin zone of the primitive
cell. With the Geometric module, one can compute the Berry phase and Berry
curvature-related quantities, such as electric polarization, Wilson loops,
Chern numbers, and anomalous Hall conductivities. The Optical module offers a
range of optical property calculations, including optical conductivity and
nonlinear optical responses, such as shift current and Berry curvature dipole.

<h3>Critical number of walkers for diffusive search processes with resetting</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18012" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18012</a>
<br>
<i>Marco Biroli, Satya N. Majumdar, Gregory Schehr</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider $N$ Brownian motions diffusing independently on a line, starting
at $x_0>0$, in the presence of an absorbing target at the origin. The walkers
undergo stochastic resetting under two protocols: (A) each walker resets
independently to $x_0$ with rate $r$ and (B) all walkers reset simultaneously
to $x_0$ with rate $r$. We compute analytically the mean first-passage time to
the origin and show that, as a function of $r$ and for fixed $x_0$, it has a
minimum at an optimal value $r^*>0$ as long as $N<N_c$. Thus resetting is
beneficial for the search for $N<N_c$. When $N>N_c$, the optimal value occurs
at $r^*=0$ indicating that resetting hinders search processes. Continuing our
results analytically to real $N$, we show that $N_c=7.3264773\ldots$ for
protocol A and $N_c=6.3555864\ldots$ for protocol B, independently of $x_0$.
Our theoretical predictions are verified in numerical Langevin simulations.

<h3>Phase Field Model for Non-equilibrium Interface Conditions</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
This article presents a new phase-field formulation for non-equilibrium
interface conditions in rapid phase transformations. With a particular way of
defining concentration fields, the classical sharp and diffuse (thick)
interface theories are unified into the present phase-field model. Each point
inside the diffuse interface is comparable to the classical sharp interface
model, governed by phase boundary migration and short-range atomic exchanges
and connected by long-range diffusion. Their thermodynamic forces and fluxes
are following the Onsager reciprocal relation and consistent with the classical
irreversible thermodynamics. Furthermore, we establish the balance of driving
forces and energy dissipations for both the diffuse interface and the single
point inside it. The model is then validated by rapid solidification of Al-Cu
alloys. With an effective mobility of considering non-equilibrium long-range
diffusion, the model represents the main characteristics of non-equilibrium
interface kinetics, i.e., solute trapping and solute drag. Especially, we
reproduce the complete trapping at the high-velocity regime and provide a
thermodynamic consistent description of the partial drag phenomena at the
low-velocity region. Moreover, the dissipation analysis indicates that even the
far-from-equilibrium diffuse interface is composed of numerous representative
volume elements near the equilibrium, providing a new understanding of
non-equilibrium interfaces.

<br>
<br>
We discuss the effect of long-range interactions within the self-consistent
Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation in comparison to short-range atomic Hubbard
interactions on the band structure of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at charge
neutrality for various twist angles. Starting from atomistic calculations, we
determine the quasi-particle band structure of TBG with Hubbard interactions
for various magnetic orderings: modulated anti-ferromagnetic (MAFM), nodal
anti-ferromagnetic (NAFM) and hexagonal anti-ferromagnetic (HAFM). Then, we
develop an approach to incorporate these magnetic orderings along with the HF
potential in the continuum approximation. Away from the magic angle, we observe
a drastic effect of the magnetic order on the band structure of TBG compared to
the influence of the HF potential. Near the magic angle, however, the HF
potential seems to play a major role on the band structure compared to the
magnetic order. These findings suggest that the spin-valley degenerate broken
symmetry state often found in HF calculations of charge neutral TBG near the
magic angle should favour magnetic order, since the atomistic Hubbard
interaction will break this symmetry in favour of spin polarization.

<h3>Theory of rheology and aging of protein condensates</h3>

Biological condensates are assemblies of proteins and nucleic acids that form
membraneless compartments in cells and play essential roles in cellular
functions. In many cases they exhibit the physical properties of liquid
droplets that coexist in a surrounding fluid. Recently, quantitative studies on
the material properties of biological condensates have become available,
revealing complex material properties. In vitro experiments have shown that
protein condensates exhibit time dependent material properties, similar to
aging in glasses. To understand this phenomenon from a theoretical perspective,
we develop a rheological model based on the physical picture of protein
diffusion and stochastic binding inside condensates. The complex nature of
protein interactions is captured by a distribution of binding energies,
incorporated in a trap model originally developed to study glass transitions.
Our model can describe diffusion of constituent particles, as well as the
material response to time-dependent forces, and it recapitulates the age
dependent relaxation time of Maxwell glass observed experimentally both in
active and passive rheology. We derive a generalized fluctuation-response
relations of our model in which the relaxation function does not obey time
translation invariance. Our study sheds light on the complex material
properties of biological condensates and provides a theoretical framework for
understanding their aging behavior.

Interface engineering in complex oxide heterostructures has developed into a
flourishing field as various intriguing physical phenomena can be demonstrated
which are otherwise absent in their constituent bulk compounds. Here we present
La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) / Sm$_{0.5}$Ca$_{0.5}$MnO$_3$ (SCMO) based
heterostructures showcasing the dominance of antiferromagnetic interaction with
increasing interfaces. In particular, we demonstrate that exchange bias can be
tuned by increasing the number of interfaces; while, on the other hand,
electronic phase separation can be mimicked by creating epitaxial multilayers
of such robust charge ordered antiferromagnetic (CO-AF) and ferromagnetic (FM)
manganites with increased AF nature, which otherwise would require
intrinsically disordered mixed phase materials. The origin of these phenomena
is discussed in terms of magnetic interactions between the interfacial layers
of the LSMO/SCMO. A theoretical model has been utilized to account for the
experimentally observed magnetization curves in order to draw out the complex
interplay between FM and AF spins at interfaces with the onset of charge
ordering.

We investigate critical equilibrium and out of equilibrium properties of a
ferromagnetic Ising model in one and two dimension in the presence of long
range interactions, $J_{ij}\propto r^{-(d+\sigma)}$. We implement a novel local
dynamics on a dynamical L\'evy lattice, that correctly reproduces the static
critical exponents known in the literature, as a function of the interaction
parameter $\sigma$. Due to its locality the algorithm can be applied to
investigate dynamical properties, of both discrete and continuous long range
models. We consider the relaxation time at the critical temperature and we
measure the dynamical exponent $z$ as a function of the decay parameter
$\sigma$, highlighting that the onset of short range regime for the dynamical
critical properties appears to occur at a value of $\sigma$ which differs from
the equilibrium one.

<h3>Nonstationary but quasisteady states in Self-organized Criticality</h3>

<i>S. S. Manna</i>
<br>
<br>
The notion of Self-organized criticality (SOC) had been conceived to
interpret the spontaneous emergence of long range correlations in nature. Since
then many different models had been introduced to study SOC. All of them have
few common features: externally driven dynamical systems self-organize
themselves to non-equilibrium stationary states exhibiting fluctuations of all
length scales as the signatures of criticality. In contrast, we have studied
here in the framework of the sandpile model a system that has mass inflow but
no outflow. There is no boundary, and particles cannot escape from the system
by any means. Therefore, there is no current balance, and consequently it is
not expected that the system would arrive at a stationary state. In spite of
that, it is observed that the bulk of the system self-organizes to a
quasi-steady state where the grain density is maintained at a nearly constant
value. Power law distributed fluctuations of all length and time scales have
been observed which are the signatures of criticality. Our detailed computer
simulation study gives the set of critical exponents whose values are very
close to their counter parts in the original sandpile model. This study
indicates that (i) a physical boundary and (ii) the stationary state though
sufficient but may not be the necessary criteria for achieving SOC.

Observation of planar Hall effect (PHE) in topological materials has been a
subject of great interest in the recent years, owing to its intriguing origin
because of the observation of chiral anomaly and anisotropic orbital
magnetoresistance (MR). Here, we report the planar Hall effect,
magnetoresistance and thermal transport properties (Seebeck and Nernst
coefficients) on the Ag intercalated PdTe$_2$. We observed positive
longitudinal magnetoresistance, linear field dependence of the amplitude of PHE
($\Delta\rho$), and the absence of electric and chiral charge coupling. Our
observations alongwith prolate pattern in the parametric plot ($\rho_{xy}$ vs.
$\rho_{xx}$) suggest the absence of chiral anomaly. These results in congruence
with the results on PdTe$_2$ and Cu$_{0.05}$PdTe$_2$ point towards the
importance of Fermi surface anisotropies in understanding the origin of PHE.
Further, we have shown the Seebeck ($\it{S}$) and Nernst ($\nu$) coefficients
for PdTe$_2$ and Cu and Ag intercalated compounds. We observed two phonon drag
peaks (at $\sim{9}$ K, and $\sim{50}$ K) for these compounds. The estimated
value of Fermi energy for Ag$_{0.05}$PdTe$_2$ is $\sim$ 3 times that of
PdTe$_2$.

<br>
<br>
The reduction of phase noise in electronic systems is of utmost importance in
modern communication and signal processing applications and requires an
understanding of the underlying physical processes. Here, we systematically
study the phase noise in mutually synchronized chains of nano-constriction spin
Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs). We find that longer chains have improved phase
noise figures at low offset frequencies (1/f noise), where chains of two and
ten mutually synchronized SHNOs have 2.8 and 6.2 dB lower phase noise than
single SHNOs. This is close to the theoretical values of 3 and 10 dB, and the
deviation is ascribed to process variations between nano-constrictions.
However, at higher offset frequencies (thermal noise), the phase noise
unexpectedly increases with chain length, which we ascribe to process
variations, a higher operating temperature in the long chains at the same drive
current and phase delays in the coupling between nano-constrictions.

We predict a large in-plane polarization response to bending in a broad class
of trigonal two-dimensional crystals. We define and compute the relevant
flexoelectric coefficients from first principles as linear-response properties
of the undistorted layer, by using the primitive crystal cell. The ensuing
response (evaluated for SnS$_{2}$, silicene, phosphorene and RhI$_{3}$
monolayers and for an h-BN bilayer) is up to one order of magnitude larger than
the out-of-plane components in the same material. We illustrate the
implications of our findings by calculating the spontaneous axial polarization
in nanotubes of arbitrary geometry, and the longitudinal electric fields
induced by a flexural phonon.

We report on the pressure evolution of the electronic and crystal structures
of the noncentrosymmetric antiferromagnet EuCoGe3. Using a diamond anvil cell,
we performed high pressure fluorescence detected near-edge x-ray absorption
spectroscopy at the Eu L3, Co K, and Ge K edges and synchrotron powder x-ray
diffraction. In the Eu L3 spectrum, both divalent and trivalent Eu peaks are
observed from the lowest pressure measurement (~2 GPa). By increasing pressure,
the relative intensity of the trivalent Eu peak increases, and an average Eu
valence continuously increases from 2.2 at 2 GPa to 2.31 at~50 GPa. On the
other hand, no discernible changes are observed in the Co K and Ge K spectra as
a function of pressure. With the increase in pressure, lattice parameters
continuously decrease without changing I4mm symmetry. Our study revealed a
robust divalent Eu state and an unchanged crystal symmetry of EuCoGe3 against
pressure.

<br>
<br>
Spinful triplet Cooper pairs can be generated from their singlet counterparts
available in a conventional superconductor (S) using two or more noncollinear
magnetic moments, typically contributed by different magnets in a multilayered
heterostructure. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that an S interfaced with a
canted antiferromagnet (AF) harbors spinful triplet Cooper pairs capitalizing
on the intrinsic noncollinearity between the two AF sublattice magnetizations.
As the AF canting can be controlled by an applied field, our work proposes a
simple bilayer structure that admits controllable generation of spin-triplet
Cooper pairs. Employing the Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework, we delineate the
spatial dependence of the spin-triplet correlations. We further evaluate the
superconducting critical temperature as a function of the AF canting, which
provides one experimental observable associated with the emergence of these
triplet correlations.

<h3>Optical responses in two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac bands</h3>

<br>
<br>
Within linear response theory, the absorptive part of optical conductivities
are analytically calculated for distinct tilts in two-dimensional (2D) tilted
semi-Dirac bands (TSDBs). The transverse optical conductivities always vanish
$\mathrm{Re}\sigma_{xy}(\omega)=\mathrm{Re}\sigma_{yx}(\omega)=0$. The
interband longitudinal optical conductivities (LOCs) in 2D TSDBs differ
qualitatively in the power-law scaling of $\omega$ as
$\mathrm{Re}\sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{IB}}(\omega)\propto\sigma_0\sqrt{\omega}$ and
$\mathrm{Re}\sigma_{yy}^{\mathrm{IB}}(\omega)\propto\sigma_0/\sqrt{\omega}$. By
contrast, the intraband LOCs in 2D TSDBs depend on $\mu$ in the power-law
scaling $\mathrm{Re}\sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{D}}(\omega)\propto\sigma_0\mu
\sqrt{\mu}$ and
$\mathrm{Re}\sigma_{yy}^{\mathrm{D}}(\omega)\propto\sigma_0\mu/\sqrt{\mu}$. The
power-law scaling is similar to that in 2D untilted SDBs but distincts from a
uniform behavior independent of $\omega$ (or $\mu$) as
$\mathrm{Re}\sigma_{xx/yy}^{\mathrm{IB}}(\omega)\propto\sigma_0$ (or
$\mathrm{Re}\sigma_{xx/yy}^{\mathrm{D}}(\omega)\propto\sigma_0\mu$) in 2D
tilted Dirac bands (TDBs). The universal power-law scaling further dictates
significant differences in the angular dependence of LOCs, which can be used to
characterize 2D TSDBs from 2D TDBs in the optical measurements. The
tilt-dependent behaviors of LOCs can qualitatively tell 2D TSDBs from 2D
untilted SDBs, but show similarities in the impact of band tilting between 2D
TSDBs and 2D TDBs.

Although higher-order interactions are known to affect the typical state of
dynamical processes giving rise to new collective behavior, how they drive the
emergence of rare events and fluctuations is still an open problem. We
investigate how fluctuations of a dynamical quantity of a random walk exploring
a higher-order network arise over time. By focusing on a minimal model, we show
that higher-order interactions always hamper the appearance of rare events,
although the same structure facilitates visits of certain nodes, an event
considered atypical on the corresponding system with only pairwise
interactions. If the structure of interactions is not fixed but is optimally
selected to favor a particular fluctuation, a phase transition emerges where a
random walk is typically both homogeneously spread over the network and
localised on a portion of it. Our study lays the groundwork for a wider and
general theory of fluctuations and rare events in higher-order networks.

Here we show the description of the full incorporation thermodynamics in
nanocrystalline LixFePO4 where the full range from x=0 to 1 is experimentally
accessible. The following points are most important: the treatment in terms of
the neutral lattice-gas model is incorrect rather ions and electrons need to be
considered separately. One needs to invoke point defect chemistry which gives a
satisfactory agreement over the full storage range if we treat the problem from
the two-sides: from the FePO4 side where Li+ is incorporated interstitially and
from the LiFePO4 side where Li+ is filling the vacancies. Furthermore, we
clarify how non-idealities such as ion-electron and electron-electron
interactions can be introduced to obtain a mechanistic understanding.

Anti-Stokes photoluminescence (PL) is light emission at a higher photon
energy than the excitation, with applications in optical cooling, bioimaging,
lasing, and quantum optics. Here, we show how plasmonic nano-cavities activate
anti-Stokes PL in WSe$_2$ monolayers through resonant excitation of a dark
exciton. The tightly confined plasmonic fields excite the out-of-plane
transition dipole of the dark exciton, leading to light emission from the
bright exciton at higher energy. Through statistical measurements on hundreds
of plasmonic cavities, we show that coupling to the dark exciton is key to
achieving a near hundred-fold enhancement of the upconverted PL intensity. This
is further corroborated by experiments in which the laser excitation wavelength
is tuned across the dark exciton. Finally, we show that an asymmetric
nanoparticle shape and precise geometry are key for consistent activation of
the dark exciton and efficient PL upconversion. Our work introduces a new
excitation channel for anti-Stokes PL in WSe$_2$ and paves the way for
large-area substrates providing optical cooling, anti-Stokes lasing, and
radiative engineering of excitons.

In semi-classical transport, it has become common practice over the past few
decades to use ensemble Monte Carlo (EMC) methods for the simulation of
transport in semiconductor devices. This method utilizes particles while still
addressing the full physics within the device, leaving the computational
difficulties to the computer. More recently, the study of quantum mechanical
effects within the devices, have become important, and have been addressed in
semiconductor devices using non-equilibrium Green's functions (NEGF). In using
NEGF, one faces considerable computational difficulties. Recently, a particle
approach to NEGF has been proposed [ 1], and preliminary results presented for
non-polar optical phonons, which are very localized scattering centers. Here,
the problems with long-range polar-optical phonons are discussed and results of
the particle-based simulation presented.

Recent studies have shown the potential for bipolar thermoelectricity in
superconducting tunnel junctions with asymmetric energy gaps. The
thermoelectric performance of these systems is significantly impacted by the
inverse proximity effects present in the normal-superconducting bilayer, which
is utilized to adjust the gap asymmetry in the junction. Here, we identify the
most effective bilayer configurations, and we find that directly
tunnel-coupling the normal metal side of the bilayer with the other
superconductor is more advantageous compared to the scheme used before. By
utilizing quasiclassical equations, we examined the nonlinear thermoelectric
junction performance as a function of the normal metal film thickness and the
quality of the normal-superconducting interface within the bilayer, thereby
determining the optimal design to observe and maximize this nonequilibrium
effect. Our results offer a roadmap to achieve improved thermoelectric
performance in superconducting tunnel junctions, with promising implications
for a number of applications.

The well-known Pavarini et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 047003 (2001)]
correlation between the critical temperature $T_c$, max and the shape of the
Fermi contour of the optimally hole-doped cuprates are explained within the
framework of the BCS theory with Kondo exchange interaction incorporated as a
pairing mechanism. The strong influence of the relative position of the Cu4$s$
level with respect to the Cu3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ level on the critical temperature
$T_c$ reveals why the $s$-$d$ hybridization of the conduction band is so
important. This hybridization is proportional to the $s$-$d$ exchange
scattering amplitude between the conduction electrons -- the mechanism of
d-wave pairing in the CuO$_2$ plane. In other words the Kondo interaction
considered as a pairing mechanism in the CuO$_2$ plane gives a natural
explanation of the correlation between the critical temperature and the shape
of the Fermi contour. The lack of an alternative explanation for the
description of the critical temperature of optimally doped cuprates for several
decades gives a hint that the long sought pairing mechanism has already been
found.
