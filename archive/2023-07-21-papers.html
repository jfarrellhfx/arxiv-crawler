<h3>Magnetization amplification in the interlayer pairing superconductor  4Hb-TaS$_2$</h3>

A recent experiment on the bulk compound 4Hb-TaS$_2$ reveals an unusual
time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconducting state that possesses a magnetic
memory not manifest in the normal state. Here we provide one mechanism for this
observation by studying the magnetic and electronic properties of 4Hb-TaS$_2$.
We discuss the criterion for a small magnetization in the normal state in terms
of spin and orbital magnetization. Based on an analysis of lattice symmetry and
Fermi surface structure, we propose that 4Hb-TaS$_2$ realizes superconductivity
in the interlayer, equal-spin channel with a gap function whose phase winds
along the Fermi surface by an integer multiple of $6\pi$. The enhancement of
the magnetization in the superconducting state compared to the normal state can
be explained if the state with a gap winding of $6\pi$ is realized, accounting
for the observed magnetic memory. We discuss how this superconducting state can
be probed experimentally by spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy.

The liquidus temperature is an important parameter in understanding the
crystalline behavior of materials and in the operation of blast furnaces. Its
modeling can be carried out by linear and nonlinear methods through data,
considering the artificial neural network a modeling method with high
efficiency because it presents the theorem of universal approximation and with
that better performances and possibility of greater oscillations. The best
linear model and the best nonlinear model were modeled by structural parameters
and presented a good numerical approximation, thus demonstrating that
mathematical modeling can be performed using structural arguments and also
showing a dimensionality reduction method for modeling a thermophysical
property of the materials.

<h3>A modified Ehlers model for the description of inelastic behavior of  porous structures</h3>

This paper describes a modification of Ehlers' model for the inelastic
behavior of granular media. The modified model can be applied for describing
the inelastic behavior of porous media. The key feature is a subtle change of
the yield potential, which allows the correct orientation of the
triangular-shaped yield surface cross sections depending on the hydrostatic
stress state. The model is incorporated into a general framework for isotropic
plasticity. An elastic predictor/corrector algorithm is employed to solve the
constitutive equations. The necessary derivatives for a Newton update are also
given in detail. The model is calibrated using stress, and strain data obtained
from finite element simulations of a generic highly porous open-cell
Wheire-Phelan foam.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking of 2D isotropic Heisenberg magnet is restricted
by Mermin-Wagner theorem at any finite temperature in presence of short-range
exchange interaction.Kosterlitz and Thouless using XY spin model showed that
how an order state could developed in 2D spin system in presence of short range
isotropic interaction.Very recent discovery of several van der waals magnet
revised and redefined our understanding on 2D Heisenberg magnet and its ground
state properties.After a rigorous and careful study of several 2D magnetic
material we have realized from both experimentally and numerically that the
finite size of a 2D system has great impact on the ground state symmetry
breaking.Because of that finite size effect more often an anisotropic residual
magnetic moment is generated and trigger the spontaneous symmetry breaking at
finite temperature(T) and even only presence of short-range interaction we
observed the phase transition of that Heisenberg spin system.In this present
work we have shown the basic role of finite size,anisotropy during the symmetry
breaking of 2D Heisenberg XY magnet.Here we have simulated Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition using classical Monte-carlo simulation and study the effect of
anisotropy during the phase transition.We presented the behaviour of different
thermodynamic properties of 2D XY spin model system during the
Kosterlitz-Thouless(KT) transition.The generic characteristic of KT transition
which make it distinct from other critical phenomena is that the peak of heat
capacity is not diverging with increase of system size rather peak is
decreasing with the increasing of system size near at transition
temperature.Here we are observing that behaviour in our present simulation and
that specific behaviour help us for classifying the present transition as
Kosterlitz-Thouless(KT) transition.

<h3>R2D2 -- An equivalent-circuit model that quantitatively describes domain  wall conductivity in ferroelectric LiNbO$_3$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Ferroelectric domain wall (DW) conductivity (DWC) can be attributed to two
separate mechanisms: (a) the injection/ejection of charge carriers across the
Schottky barrier formed at the (metal-) electrode-DW junction and (b) the
transport of those charge carriers along the DW. Current-voltage (IU)
characteristics, recorded at variable temperatures from LiNbO$_3$ (LNO) DWs,
are clearly able to differentiate between these two contributions. Practically,
they allow us here to directly quantify the physical parameters relevant for
the two mechanisms (a) and (b) mentioned above. These are, e.g., the resistance
of the DW, the saturation current, the ideality factor, and the Schottky
barrier height of the electrode/DW junction. Furthermore, the activation
energies needed to initiate the thermally-activated electronic transport along
the DWs, can be extracted. In addition, we show that electronic transport along
LiNbO$_3$ DWs can be elegantly viewed and interpreted in an adapted
semiconductor picture based on a double-diode/double-resistor equivalent
circuit model, the R2D2 model. Finally, our R2D2 model was checked for its
universality by fitting the DWC data not only to z-cut LNO bulk DWs, but
equally to z-cut thin-film LNO DWs, and DWC from x-cut DWs as reported in
literature.

For decades, frustrated quantum magnets have been a seed for scientific
progress and innovation in condensed matter. As much as the numerical tools for
low-dimensional quantum magnetism have thrived and improved in recent years due
to breakthroughs inspired by quantum information and quantum computation,
higher-dimensional quantum magnetism can be considered as the final frontier,
where strong quantum entanglement, multiple ordering channels, and manifold
ways of paramagnetism culminate. At the same time, efforts in crystal synthesis
have induced a significant increase in the number of tangible frustrated
magnets which are generically three-dimensional in nature, creating an urgent
need for quantitative theoretical modeling. We review the pseudo-fermion (PF)
and pseudo-Majorana (PM) functional renormalization group (FRG) and their
specific ability to address higher-dimensional frustrated quantum magnetism.
First developed more than a decade ago, the PFFRG interprets a Heisenberg model
Hamiltonian in terms of Abrikosov pseudofermions, which is then treated in a
diagrammatic resummation scheme formulated as a renormalization group flow of
$m$-particle pseudofermion vertices. The article reviews the state of the art
of PFFRG and PMFRG and discusses their application to exemplary domains of
frustrated magnetism, but most importantly, it makes the algorithmic and
implementation details of these methods accessible to everyone. By thus
lowering the entry barrier to their application, we hope that this review will
contribute towards establishing PFFRG and PMFRG as the numerical methods for
addressing frustrated quantum magnetism in higher spatial dimensions.

<h3>Spin Space Groups: Full Classification and Applications</h3>

In this work, we exhaust all the spin-space symmetries, which fully
characterize collinear, non-collinear, commensurate, and incommensurate spiral
magnetism, and investigate enriched features of electronic bands that respect
these symmetries. We achieve this by systematically classifying the so-called
spin space groups (SSGs) - joint symmetry groups of spatial and spin operations
that leave the magnetic structure unchanged. Generally speaking, they are
accurate (approximate) symmetries in systems where spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is
negligible (finite but weaker than the interested energy scale); but we also
show that specific SSGs could remain valid even in the presence of a strong
SOC. By representing the SSGs as O($N$) representations, we - for the first
time - obtain the complete classifications of 1421, 9542, and 56512 distinct
SSGs for collinear ($N=1$), coplanar ($N=2$), and non-coplanar ($N=3$)
magnetism, respectively. SSG not only fully characterizes the symmetry of spin
d.o.f., but also gives rise to exotic electronic states, which, in general,
form projective representations of magnetic space groups (MSGs). Surprisingly,
electronic bands in SSGs exhibit features never seen in MSGs, such as
nonsymmorphic SSG Brillouin zone (BZ), where SSG operations behave as glide or
screw when act on momentum and unconventional spin-momentum locking, which is
completely determined by SSG, independent of Hamiltonian details. To apply our
theory, we identify the SSG for each of the 1604 published magnetic structures
in the MAGNDATA database on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server. Material
examples exhibiting aforementioned novel features are discussed with emphasis.
We also investigate new types of SSG-protected topological electronic states
that are unprecedented in MSGs.

<h3>Enumeration and representation of spin space groups</h3>

Those fundamental properties, such as phase transitions, Weyl fermions and
spin excitation, in all magnetic ordered materials was ultimately believed to
rely on the symmetry theory of magnetic space groups. Recently, it has come to
light that a more comprehensive group, known as the spin space group (SSG),
which combines separate spin and spatial operations, is necessary to fully
characterize the geometry and physical properties of magnetic ordered materials
such as altermagnets. However, the basic theory of SSG has been seldomly
developed. In this work, we present a systematic study of the enumeration and
the representation theory of SSG. Starting from the 230 crystallographic space
groups and finite translational groups with a maximum order of 8, we establish
an extensive collection of over 80,000 SSGs under a four-segment nomenclature.
We then identify inequivalent SSGs specifically applicable to collinear,
coplanar, and noncoplanar magnetic configurations. Moreover, we derive the
irreducible co-representations of the little group in momentum space within the
SSG framework. Finally, we illustrate the SSGs and band degeneracies resulting
from SSG symmetries through several representative material examples, including
a well-known altermagnet RuO2, and a spiral magnet CeAuAl3. Our work advances
the field of group theory in describing magnetic ordered materials, opening up
avenues for deeper comprehension and further exploration of emergent phenomena
in magnetic materials.

<h3>Enumeration of spin-space groups: Towards a complete description of  symmetries of magnetic orders</h3>

Symmetries of three-dimensional periodic scalar fields are described by 230
space groups (SGs). Symmetries of three-dimensional periodic (pseudo-) vector
fields, however, are described by the spin-space groups (SSGs), which were
initially used to describe the symmetries of magnetic orders. In SSGs, the
real-space and spin degrees of freedom are unlocked in the sense that an
operation could have different spacial and spin rotations. SSGs gives a
complete symmetry description of magnetic structures, and have natural
applications in the band theory of itinerary electrons in magnetically ordered
systems with weak spin-orbit coupling.\textit{Altermagnetism}, a concept raised
recently that belongs to the symmetry-compensated collinear magnetic orders but
has non-relativistic spin splitting, is well described by SSGs. Due to the vast
number and complicated group structures, SSGs have not yet been systematically
enumerated. In this work, we exhaust SSGs based on the invariant subgroups of
SGs, with spin operations constructed from three-dimensional (3D) real
representations of the quotient groups for the invariant subgroups. For
collinear and coplanar magnetic orders, the spin operations can be reduced into
lower dimensional real representations. As the number of SSGs is infinite, we
only consider SSGs that describe magnetic unit cells up to 12 times crystal
unit cells. We obtain 157,289 non-coplanar, 24,788 coplanar-non-collinear, and
1,421 collinear SSGs. The enumerated SSGs are stored in an online database at
\url{https://cmpdc.iphy.ac.cn/ssg} with a user-friendly interface. We also
develop an algorithm to identify SSG for realistic materials and find SSGs for
1,626 magnetic materials. Our results serve as a solid starting point for
further studies of symmetry and topology in magnetically ordered materials.

<h3>Effects of nucleation at a first-order transition between two  superconducting phases: Application to CeRh$_2$As$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10374" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10374</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Recent experiments observed a phase transition within the superconducting
regime of the heavy-fermion system CeRh$_2$As$_2$ when subjected to a $c$-axis
magnetic field. This phase transition has been interpreted as a parity
switching from even to odd parity as the field is increased, and is believed to
be of first order. If correct, this scenario provides a unique opportunity to
study the phenomenon of local nucleation around inhomogeneities in a
superconducting context. Here, we study such nucleation in the form of sharp
domain walls emerging on a background of spatially varying material properties
and hence, critical magnetic field. To this end, we construct a spatially
inhomogeneous Ginzburg-Landau functional and apply numerical minimization to
demonstrate the existence of localized domain wall solutions and study their
physical properties. Furthermore, we propose ultrasound attenuation as an
experimental bulk probe of domain wall physics in the system. In particular, we
predict the appearance of an absorption peak due to domain wall percolation
upon tuning the magnetic field across the first-order transition line. We argue
that the temperature dependence of this peak could help identify the nature of
the phase transition.

<h3>Vacancy spectroscopy of non-Abelian Kitaev spin liquids</h3>

<br>
<br>
Spin vacancies in the non-Abelian Kitaev spin liquid are known to harbor
Majorana zero modes, potentially enabling topological quantum computing at
elevated temperatures. Here, we study the spectroscopic signatures of such
Majorana zero modes in a scanning tunneling setup where a non-Abelian Kitaev
spin liquid with a finite density of spin vacancies forms a tunneling barrier
between a tip and a substrate. Our key result is a well-defined peak close to
zero bias voltage in the derivative of the tunneling conductance whose voltage
and intensity both increase with the density of vacancies. This
''quasi-zero-voltage peak'' is identified as the closest analog of the
zero-voltage peak observed in topological superconductors that additionally
reflects the fractionalized nature of spin-liquid-based Majorana zero modes. We
further highlight a single-fermion Van Hove singularity at a higher voltage
that reveals the energy scale of the emergent Majorana fermions in the Kitaev
spin liquid. Our proposed signatures are within reach of current experiments on
the candidate material $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.

<h3>Spontaneous orbital polarization in the nematic phase of FeSe</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10377" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10377</a>
<br>
<i>Connor A. Occhialini, Joshua J. Sanchez, Qian Song, Gilberto Fabbris, Yongseong Choi, Jong-Woo Kim, Philip J. Ryan, Riccardo Comin</i>
<br>
<br>
The origin of nematicity in FeSe remains a critical outstanding question
towards understanding unconventional superconductivity in proximity to nematic
order. To understand what drives the nematicity, it is essential to determine
which electronic degree of freedom admits a spontaneous order parameter
independent from the structural distortion. Here, we use X-ray linear dichroism
at the Fe K pre-edge to measure the anisotropy of the 3d orbital occupation as
a function of in situ applied stress and temperature across the nematic
transition. Along with X-ray diffraction to precisely quantify the strain
state, we reveal a lattice-independent, spontaneously-ordered orbital
polarization within the nematic phase, as well as an orbital polarizability
that diverges as the transition is approached from above. These results provide
strong evidence that spontaneous orbital polarization serves as the primary
order parameter of the nematic phase.

<h3>A spin-rotation mechanism of Einstein-de Haas effect based on a  ferromagnetic disk</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10390" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10390</a>
<br>
<i>Xin Nie, Jun Li, Trinanjan Datta, Dao-Xin Yao</i>
<br>
<br>
Spin-rotation coupling (SRC) is a fundamental phenomenon that connects
electronic spins with the rotational motion of a medium. We elucidate the
Einstein-de Haas (EdH) effect and its inverse with SRC as the microscopic
mechanism using the dynamic spin-lattice equations derived by elasticity theory
and Lagrangian formalism. By applying the coupling equations to an iron disk in
a magnetic field, we exhibit the transfer of angular momentum and energy
between spins and lattice, with or without damping. The timescale of the
angular momentum transfer from spins to the entire lattice is estimated by our
theory to be on the order of 0.01 ns, for the disk with a radius of 100 nm.
Moreover, we discover a linear relationship between the magnetic field strength
and the rotation frequency, which is also enhanced by a higher ratio of Young's
modulus to Poisson's coefficient. In the presence of damping, we notice that
the spin-lattice relaxation time is nearly inversely proportional to the
magnetic field. Our explorations will contribute to a better understanding of
the EdH effect and provide valuable insights for magneto-mechanical
manufacturing.

<h3>Nonequilibrium Seebeck and spin Seebeck effects in nanoscale junctions</h3>

The spin-resolved thermoelectric transport properties of correlated nanoscale
junctions, consisting of a quantum dot/molecule asymmetrically coupled to
external ferromagnetic contacts, are studied theoretically in the
far-from-equilibrium regime. One of the leads is assumed to be strongly coupled
to the quantum dot resulting in the development of the Kondo effect. The
spin-dependent current flowing through the system, as well as the
thermoelectric properties, are calculated by performing a perturbation
expansion with respect to the weakly coupled electrode, while the Kondo
correlations are captured accurately by using the numerical renormalization
group method. In particular, we determine the differential and nonequilibrium
Seebeck effects of the considered system in different magnetic configurations
and uncover the crucial role of spin-dependent tunneling on the device
performance. Moreover, by allowing for spin accumulation in the leads, which
gives rise to finite spin bias, we shed light on the behavior of the
nonequilibrium spin Seebeck effect.

<h3>Leveraging Plasmonic Hot Electrons to Quench Defect Emission in Metal --  Semiconductor Nanostructured Hybrids: Experiment and Modeling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10400" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10400</a>

<br>
<br>
Modeling light-matter interaction in hybrid plasmonic materials is vital to
their widening relevance from optoelectronics to photocatalysis. Here, we
explore photoluminescence from ZnO nanorods (ZNR) embedded with gold
nanoparticles (Au NPs). A progressive increase in Au NP concentration
introduces significant structural disorder and defects in the ZNRs, which
paradoxically quenches defect related visible photoluminescence (PL) while
intensifying the near band edge (NBE) emission. Under UV excitation, the
simulated semi-classical model realizes PL from ZnO with sub-band gap defect
states, eliciting visible emissions that are absorbed by Au NPs to generate a
non-equilibrium hot carrier distribution. The photo-stimulated hot carriers,
transferred to ZnO, substantially modify its steady-state luminescence,
reducing NBE emission lifetime and altering the abundance of ionized defect
states, finally reducing visible emission. The simulations show that the change
in the interfacial band bending at the Au-ZnO interface under optical
illumination facilitates charge transfer between the components. This work
provides a general foundation to observe and model the hot carrier dynamics in
hybrid plasmonic systems.

Van der Waals structures present a unique opportunity for tailoring material
interfaces and integrating photonic functionalities. By precisely manipulating
the twist angle and stacking sequences, it is possible to elegantly tune and
functionalize the electronic and optical properties of layered van der Waals
structures. Among these materials, two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride
(hBN) stands out for its remarkable optical properties and wide band gap,
making it a promising host for solid state single photon emitters at room
temperature. Previous investigations have demonstrated the observation of
bright single photon emission in hBN across a wide range of wavelengths. In
this study, we unveil an application of van der Waals technology in modulating
their spectral shapes and brightness by carefully controlling the stacking
sequences and polytypes. Our theoretical analysis reveals remarkably large
variations in the Huang-Rhys factors-an indicator of the interaction between a
defect and its surrounding lattice-reaching up to a factor of 3.3 for the same
defect in different stackings. We provide insights into the underlying
mechanism behind these variations, shedding light on the design principles
necessary to achieve rational and precise control of defect emission. This work
paves the way for enhancing defect identification and facilitating the
engineering of highly efficient single photon sources and qubits using van der
Waals materials.

<h3>Checkerboard bubble lattice formed by octuple-period quadruple-$Q$ spin  density waves</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate multiple-$Q$ instability on a square lattice at particular
ordering wave vectors. We find that a superposition of quadruple-$Q$ spin
density waves, which are connected by fourfold rotational and mirror
symmetries, gives rise to a checkerboard bubble lattice with a collinear spin
texture as a result of the geometry among the constituent ordering wave vectors
in the Brillouin zone. By performing the simulated annealing for a fundamental
spin model, we show that such a checkerboard bubble lattice is stabilized under
an infinitesimally small easy-axis two-spin anisotropic interaction and
biquadratic interaction at zero field, while it is degenerate with an
anisotropic double-$Q$ state in the absence of the biquadratic interaction. The
obtained multiple-$Q$ structures have no intensities at high-harmonic wave
vectors in contrast to other multiple-$Q$ states, such as a magnetic skyrmion
lattice. We also show that the checkerboard bubble lattice accompanies the
charge density wave and exhibits a nearly flat band dispersion in the
electronic structure. Our results provide another route to realize exotic
multiple-$Q$ spin textures by focusing on the geometry and symmetry in terms of
the wave vectors in momentum space.

Defects determine many important properties and applications of materials,
ranging from doping in semiconductors, to conductivity in mixed
ionic-electronic conductors used in batteries, to active sites in catalysts.
The theoretical description of defect formation in crystals has evolved
substantially over the past century. Advances in supercomputing hardware, and
the integration of new computational techniques such as machine learning,
provide an opportunity to model longer length and time-scales than previously
possible. In this Tutorial Review, we cover the description of free energies
for defect formation at finite temperatures, including configurational
(structural, electronic, spin) and vibrational terms. We discuss challenges in
accounting for metastable defect configurations, progress such as machine
learning force fields and thermodynamic integration to directly access entropic
contributions, and bottlenecks in going beyond the dilute limit of defect
formation. Such developments are necessary to support a new era of accurate
defect predictions in computational materials chemistry.

Recently, machine learning algorithms have been used remarkably to study the
equilibrium phase transitions, however there are only a few works have been
done using this technique in the nonequilibrium phase transitions. In this
work, we use the supervised learning with the convolutional neural network
(CNN) algorithm and unsupervised learning with the density-based spatial
clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to study the
nonequilibrium phase transition in two models. We use CNN and DBSCAN in order
to determine the critical points for directed bond percolation (bond DP) model
and Domany-Kinzel cellular automaton (DK) model. Both models have been proven
to have a nonequilibrium phase transition belongs to the directed percolation
(DP) universality class. In the case of supervised learning we train CNN using
the images which are generated from Monte Carlo simulations of directed bond
percolation. We use that trained CNN in studding the phase transition for the
two models. In the case of unsupervised learning, we train DBSCAN using the raw
data of Monte Carlo simulations. In this case, we retrain DBSCAN at each time
we change the model or lattice size. Our results from both algorithms show
that, even for a very small values of lattice size, machine can predict the
critical points accurately for both models. Finally, we mention to that, the
value of the critical point we find here for bond DP model using CNN or DBSCAN
is exactly the same value that has been found using transfer learning with a
domain adversarial neural network (DANN) algorithm.

In this paper, we demonstrate low-thermal-budget ferroelectric field-effect
transistors (FeFETs) based on two-dimensional ferroelectric CuInP2S6 (CIPS) and
oxide semiconductor InZnO (IZO). The CIPS/IZO FeFETs exhibit non-volatile
memory windows of ~1 V, low off-state drain currents, and high carrier
mobilities. The ferroelectric CIPS layer serves a dual purpose by providing
electrostatic doping in IZO and acting as a passivation layer for the IZO
channel. We also investigate the CIPS/IZO FeFETs as artificial synaptic devices

Using muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements on formamidinium lead
iodide [FAPbI$_3$, where FA denotes HC(NH$_2)_2$] we show that, among the five
structurally distinct phases of FAPbI$_3$ exhibited through two different
temperature hysteresis, the reorientation motion of FA molecules is
quasi-static below $\approx50$ K over the time scale of 10$^{-6}$ s in the
low-temperature (LT) hexagonal (Hex-LT, $<160$ K) phase which has relatively
longer photo-excited charge carrier lifetime ($\tau_{\rm c}\sim$10$^{-6}$ s).
In contrast, a sharp increase in the FA molecular motion was found above
$\approx50$ K in the Hex-LT phase, LT-tetragonal phase (Tet-LT, $<140$ K), the
high-temperature (HT) hexagonal phase (Hex-HT, 160-380 K), and the
HT-tetragonal phase (Tet-HT, 140-280 K) where $\tau_{\rm c}$ decreases with
increasing temperature. More interestingly, the reorientation motion is further
promoted in the cubic phase at higher temperatures ($>380/280$ K), while
$\tau_{\rm c}$ is recovered to comparable or larger than that of the LT phases.
These results indicate that there are two factors that determine $\tau_{\rm
c}$, one related to the local reorientation of cationic molecules that is not
unencumbered by phonons, and the other to the high symmetry of the bulk crystal
structure.

Magnetic van der Waals materials are often proposed for use in future
spintronic devices, aiming to leverage the combination of long-range magnetic
order and near-atomic thinness to produce energy-efficient components. One
class of material that has been discussed in this context are the iron halides
FeCl$_2$ and FeBr$_2$, which are A-type antiferromagnets with strong uniaxial
magnetocrystalline anisotropy. However, despite characterization of the bulk
materials, the possibility for sustaining the magnetic behaviors that would
underpin such applications in thin flakes has not been investigated. In this
work, we use nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center microscopy to quantitatively image
magnetism in individual exfoliated flakes of these iron halides, revealing the
absence of magnetic remanence, a weak induced magnetization under bias field
and variable behavior versus temperature. We show that our results are
consistent with the antiferromagnetic behavior of the bulk material with a soft
ferromagnetic uncompensated layer, indicating that extended ($>1~\mu$m)
ferromagnetic domains are not sustained even at low temperatures (down to 4 K).
Finally, we find that the magnetic order is strongly affected by the sample
preparation, with a surprising diamagnetic order observed in a thin, hydrated
sample.

Kagome materials provides a promising platform for exploring intriguing
correlated phenomena. Recently, a charge density wave (CDW) order was observed
in kagome antiferromagnetic metal FeGe, sparking enormous research interests in
intertwining physics. Two of the core questions are (i) what drive the CDW
formation in FeGe and (ii) whether it is associated with magnetism. However,
previous analysis on Fe-derived van Hove singularities and Fermi nesting can't
account for the CDW phase transition process and the energy minimum pristine
phase well, the microscopic origin of the CDW phase in FeGe remains elusive.
Here, supported by density functional theory calculations, we reveal a
triple-well CDW landscape in FeGe and demonstrate it as a consequence of the
reconstruction of partially occupied Ge electronic band structure, without the
need for Fe-derived van Hove singularities like in non-magnetic kagome material
CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Moreover, we emphasize that the antiferromagnetic order,
intertwined with structural distortion, is crucial for stabilizing the CDW
phase. Our work thus not only deepens the understanding of the CDW mechanism in
FeGe, but also indicate an intertwined connection between the emergent
magnetism and CDW in kagome materials.

We propose a machine learning method for predicting polarizabilities with the
goal of providing Raman spectra from molecular dynamics trajectories at reduced
computational cost. A linear-response model is used as a first step and
symmetry-adapted machine learning is employed for the higher-order
contributions as a second step. We investigate the performance of the approach
for several systems including molecules and extended solids. The method can
reduce training set sizes required for accurate dielectric properties and Raman
spectra in comparison to a single-step machine learning approach.

<br>
<br>
We present a neutron diffraction study of NaYbO$_2$, a candidate quantum spin
liquid compound hosting a geometrically frustrated triangular lattice of
magnetic Yb$^{3+}$ ions. We observe diffuse magnetic scattering that persists
to at least 20 K, demonstrating the presence of short-range magnetic
correlations in this system up to a relatively high energy scale. Using reverse
Monte Carlo and magnetic pair distribution function analysis, we confirm the
predominant antiferromagnetic nature of these correlations and show that the
diffuse scattering data can be well described by noninteracting layers of XY
spins on the triangular lattice. We rule out Ising spins and
short-range-ordered stripe or 120$^{\circ}$ phases as candidate ground states
of NaYbO$_2$. These results are consistent with a possible QSL ground state in
NaYbO$_2$ and showcase the benefit of combined reciprocal- and real-space
analysis of materials with short-range magnetic correlations.

Researchers in the field of physical science are continuously searching for
universal features in strongly interacting many-body systems. However, these
features can often be concealed within highly complex observables, such as
entanglement entropy (EE). The non-local nature of these observables makes them
challenging to measure experimentally or evaluate numerically. Therefore, it is
of utmost importance to develop a reliable and convenient algorithm that can
accurately obtain these complex observables. In this paper, with help of
quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), we reveal that the statistical variance of EE
exponentially explodes with respect to the system size, making the evaluation
of EE inaccurate. We further introduce an incremental algorithm based on the
framework of QMC to solve this conundrum. The total number of our incremental
processes can be quantitatively determined and reasonably adjusted, making it
easy to control the precision in practice. We demonstrate the effectiveness and
convenience of our incremental algorithm by using it to obtain the highly
accurate EE of a 2D Hubbard model as an example. Additionally, our algorithm
can be potentially generalized to calculate other numerically statistically
unstable observables with exponential variance growth, such as the entanglement
spectrum and topological entanglement negativity of correlated boson/spin and
fermion systems, as well as other general functions of determinants of Green's
functions in interacting fermions. Accurately measuring these complex
observables has the potential to inspire the development of physical theories
and guide the direction of experiments.

Lattice strains of appropriate symmetry have served as an excellent tool to
explore the interaction of superconductivity in the iron-based superconductors
with nematic and stripe spin-density wave (SSDW) order, which are both closely
tied to an orthorhombic distortion. In this work, we contribute to a broader
understanding of the coupling of strain to superconductivity and competing
normal-state orders by studying CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ under large, in-plane strains
of $B_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ symmetry. In contrast to the majority of iron-based
superconductors, pure CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ exhibits superconductivity with
relatively high transition temperature of $T_c\,\sim\,$35 K in proximity of a
non-collinear, tetragonal, hedgehog spin-vortex crystal (SVC) order. Through
experiments, we demonstrate an anisotropic in-plane strain response of $T_c$,
which is reminiscent of the behavior of other pnictides with nematicity.
However, our calculations suggest that in CaKFe$_4$As$_4$, this anisotropic
response correlates with the one of the SVC fluctuations, highlighting the
close interrelation of magnetism and high-$T_c$ superconductivity. By
suggesting moderate $B_{2g}$ strains as an effective parameter to change the
stability of SVC and SSDW, we outline a pathway to a unified phase diagram of
iron-based superconductivity.

<h3>Double exchange, itinerant ferromagnetism and topological Hall effect in  moiré heterobilayer</h3>

Motivated by the recent experiments and the wide tunability on the
MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ moir\'{e} heterobilayer, we consider a physical model to
explore the underlying physics for the interplay between the itinerant carriers
and the local magnetic moments. In the regime where the MoTe$_2$ is tuned to a
triangular lattice Mott insulator and the WSe$_2$ layer is doped with the
itinerant holes, we invoke the itinerant ferromagnetism from the double
exchange mechanism for the itinerant holes on the WSe$_2$ layer and the local
moments on the MoTe$_2$ layer. Together with the antiferromagnetic exchange on
the MoTe$_2$ layer, the itinerant ferromagnetism generates the scalar spin
chirality distribution in the system. We further point out the presence of
spin-assisted hopping in addition to the Kondo coupling between the local spin
and the itinerant holes, and demonstrate the topological Hall effect for the
itinerant electrons in the presence of the non-collinear spin configurations.
This work may improve our understanding of the correlated moir\'{e} systems and
inspire further experimental efforts.

Deciphering the underpinnings of the dynamical processes leading to
information transmission, processing, and storing in the brain is a crucial
challenge in neuroscience. An inspiring but speculative theoretical idea is
that such dynamics should operate at the brink of a phase transition, i.e., at
the edge between different collective phases, to entail a rich dynamical
repertoire and optimize functional capabilities. In recent years, research
guided by the advent of high-throughput data and new theoretical developments
has contributed to making a quantitative validation of such a hypothesis. Here
we review recent advances in this field, stressing our contributions. In
particular, we use data from thousands of individually recorded neurons in the
mouse brain and tools such as a phenomenological renormalization group
analysis, theory of disordered systems, and random matrix theory. These
combined approaches provide novel evidence of quasi-universal scaling and
near-critical behavior emerging in different brain regions. Moreover, we design
artificial neural networks under the reservoir-computing paradigm and show that
their internal dynamical states become near critical when we tune the networks
for optimal performance. These results not only open new perspectives for
understanding the ultimate principles guiding brain function but also towards
the development of brain-inspired, neuromorphic computation.

van der Waals (vdW) layered transition-metal chalcogenides are attracting
significant attention owing to their fascinating physical properties. This
group of materials consists of abundant members with various elements, having a
variety of different structures. However, all vdW layered materials studied to
date have been limited to crystalline materials, and the physical properties of
vdW layered quasicrystals have not yet been reported. Here, we report on the
discovery of superconductivity in a vdW layered quasicrystal of Ta1.6Te. The
electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat of the
Ta1.6Te quasicrystal fabricated by reaction sintering, unambiguously validated
the occurrence of bulk superconductivity at a transition temperature of ~1 K.
This discovery can pioneer new research on assessing the physical properties of
vdW layered quasicrystals as well as two-dimensional quasicrystals; moreover,
it paves the way toward new frontiers of superconductivity in thermodynamically
stable quasicrystals, which has been the predominant challenge facing condensed

<br>
<br>
Nanometer-thick supported lms of polymer melts spontaneously form and spread
around sessile droplets that are deposited on oxidized silicon wafers. At
steady state, the lms become dense and adopt a uniform thickness which is equal
to twice the gyration radius of the free polymer. Remarkably, this law applies
to a wide variety of melts and does not depend on the polymer chemistry nor on
the surface state (oxide layer thickness, temperature, presence of water
adsorbed, etc.). We show that existing theoretical descriptions cannot
reproduce this experimental result. Conversely, the evolution toward this
equilibrium state witnesses the specicity of the interactions at stake in these
conned polymer lms. The chains spreading dynamics can be modeled by taking into
account both the polymer/surface friction and the polymer/polymer friction.

The discovery of atomically thin van der Waals ferroelectric and magnetic
materials encourages the exploration of 2D multiferroics, which holds the
promise to understand fascinating magnetoelectric interactions and fabricate
advanced spintronic devices. In addition to building a heterostructure
consisting of ferroelectric and magnetic ingredients, thinning down layered
multiferroics of spin origin such as NiI2 becomes a natural route to realize 2D
multiferroicity. However, the layer-dependent behavior, widely known in the
community of 2D materials, necessitates a rigorous scrutiny of the multiferroic
order in the few-layer limit. Here, we interrogate the layer thickness
crossover of helimagnetism in NiI2 that drives the ferroelectricity and thereby
type-II multiferroicity. By using wavelength-dependent polarization-resolved
optical second harmonic generation (SHG) to probe the ferroic symmetry, we find
that the SHG arises from the inversion-symmetry-breaking magnetic order, not
previously assumed ferroelectricity. This magnetism-induced SHG is only
observed in bilayer or thicker layers, and vanishes in monolayer, suggesting
the critical role of interlayer exchange interaction in breaking the degeneracy
of geometrically frustrated spin structures in triangular lattice and
stabilizing the type-II multiferroic magnetism in few-layers. While the
helimagnetic transition temperature is layer dependent, the few-layer NiI2
exhibits another thickness evolution and reaches the bulk-like behavior in
trilayer, indicated by the intermediate centrosymmetric antiferromagnetic state
as revealed in Raman spectroscopy. Our work therefore highlights the magnetic
contribution to SHG and Raman spectroscopy in reduced dimension and guides the
optical study of 2D multiferroics.

The recent report of near-ambient superconductivity in nitrogen-doped
lutetium hydrides (Lu-N-H) has generated a great interest. However, conflicting
results have raised doubts regarding superconductivity. Here, we combine
high-throughput crystal structure predictions with a fast predictor of the
superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$) to shed light on the properties of
Lu-N-H at 1 GPa. None of the predicted structures shows the potential to
support high-temperature superconductivity and the inclusion of nitrogen favors
the appearance of insulating phases. Despite the lack of near-ambient
superconductivity, we consider alternative metastable templates and study their
$T_c$ and dynamical stability including quantum anharmonic effects. The cubic
Lu$_4$H$_{11}$N exhibits a high $T_c$ of 100 K at 20 GPa, a large increase
compared to 30 K obtained in its parent LuH$_3$. Interestingly, it has a
similar X-ray pattern to the experimentally observed one. The LaH$_{10}$-like
LuH$_{10}$ and CaH$_6$-like LuH$_6$ become high-temperature superconductors at
175 GPa and 100 GPa, with $T_c$ of 286 K and 246 K, respectively. Our findings
suggest that high-temperature superconductivity is not possible in stable
phases at near-ambient pressure, but metastable high-$T_c$ templates exist at
moderate and high pressures.

Conventional superconductors naturally disfavor ferromagnetism because the
supercurrent-carrying electrons are paired into anti-parallel spin singlets. In
superconductors with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling, impurity magnetic
moments induce supercurrents through the spin-galvanic effect. As a result,
long-range ferromagnetic interaction among the impurity moments may be mediated
through such anomalous supercurrents in a similar fashion as in itinerant
ferromagnets. Fe(Se,Te) is such a superconductor with topological surface
bands, previously shown to exhibit quantum anomalous vortices around impurity
spins. Here, we take advantage of the flux sensitivity of scanning
superconducting quantum interference devices to investigate superconducting
Fe(Se,Te) in the regime where supercurrents around impurities overlap. We find
homogeneous remanent flux patterns after applying a supercurrent through the
sample. The patterns are consistent with anomalous edge and bulk supercurrents
generated by in-plane magnetization, which occur above a current threshold and
follow hysteresis loops reminiscent of those of a ferromagnet. Similar
long-range magnetic orders can be generated by Meissner current under a small
out-of-plane magnetic field. The magnetization weakens with increasing
temperature and disappears after thermal cycling to above superconducting
critical temperature; further suggesting superconductivity is central to
establishing and maintaining the magnetic order. These observations demonstrate
surface anomalous supercurrents as a mediator for ferromagnetism in a
spin-orbit coupled superconductor, which may potentially be utilized for
low-power cryogenic memory.

We investigate the behavior of magnetic impurities placed on the surface of
superconductor thin films with spin-orbit coupling. Our study reveals
long-range interactions between the impurities, which decay according to a
power law, mediated by the supercurrents. Importantly, these interactions
possess a ferromagnetic component when considering the influence of the
electromagnetic field, leading to the parallel alignment of the magnetic
moments in the case of two impurities. In a Bravais lattice of magnetic
impurities, superconductivity facilitates the establishment of ferromagnetic
order within specific parameter ranges. These findings challenge the
conventional understanding that ferromagnetism and superconductivity are
mutually exclusive phenomena. Our theoretical framework provides a plausible
explanation for the recently observed remanent flux in iron-based
superconductors, particularly Fe(Se,Te).

Our measurements of $^{125}$Te NMR relaxations reveal an enhancement of

divergence in the vicinity of the metamagnetic transition at

when a magnetic field ($H$) is applied along the crystallographic $b$ axis. The
NMR data evidence that these fluctuations are dominantly longitudinal,
providing a key to understanding the peculiar superconducting phase diagram in
$H\|b$, where such fluctuations enhance the pairing interactions.

We perform a large scale study of conventional superconducting materials
using a machine-learning accelerated high-throughput workflow. We start by
creating a comprehensive dataset of around 7000 electron-phonon calculations
performed with reasonable convergence parameters. This dataset is then used to
train a robust machine learning model capable of predicting the electron-phonon
and superconducting properties based on structural, compositional, and
electronic ground-state properties. Using this machine, we evaluate the
transition temperature (Tc ) of approximately 200000 metallic compounds, all of
which on the convex hull of thermodynamic stability (or close to it) to
maximize the probability of synthesizability. Compounds predicted to have Tc
values exceeding 5 K are further validated using density-functional
perturbation theory. As a result, we identify 545 compounds with Tc values
surpassing 10 K, encompassing a variety of crystal structures and chemical
compositions. This work is complemented with a detailed examination of several
interesting materials, including nitrides, hydrides, and intermetallic
compounds. Particularly noteworthy is LiMoN2 , which we predict to be
superconducting in the stoichiometric trigonal phase, with a Tc exceeding 38 K.
LiMoN2 has been previously synthesized in this phase, further heightening its

In metal-organic-framework (MOF) perovskites, both magnetic and ferroelectric
orderings can be readily realized by compounding spin and charge degrees of
freedom. The hydrogen bonds that bridge the magnetic framework and organic
molecules have long been thought of as a key in generating multiferroic
properties. However, the underlying physical mechanisms remain unclear. Here,
we combine neutron diffraction, quasielastic and inelastic neutron scattering,
and THz spectroscopy techniques to thoroughly investigate the dynamical
properties of the multiferroic MOF candidate [CH$_3$NH$_3$][Co(HCOO)$_3$]
through its multiple phase transitions. The wide range of energy resolutions
reachable by these techniques enables us to scrutinize the coupling between the
molecules and the framework throughout the phase transitions and interrogate a
possible magnetoelectric coupling. Our results also reveal a structural change
around 220 K which may be associated with the activation of a nodding donkey
mode of the methylammonium molecule due to the ordering of the CH$_3$ groups.
Upon the occurrence of the modulated phase transition around 130 K, the
methylammonium molecules undergo a freezing of its reorientational motions
which is concomitant with a change of the lattice parameters and anomalies of
collective lattice vibrations. No significant change has been however observed
in the lattice dynamics around the magnetic ordering, which therefore indicates
the absence of a substantial magneto-electric coupling in zero-field.

Defect engineering to activate the basal planes of transition metal

the synthesis and evaluation of few-layer (7x7)-PtTe2-x with an ordered,
well-defined and high-density Te vacancy superlattice. Compared with pristine
PtTe2, (2x2)-PtTe2-x and Pt(111), (7x7)-PtTe2-x exhibits superior HER
activities in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes due to its rich structures
of undercoordinated Pt sites. Furthermore, the (7x7)-PtTe2-x sample features
outstanding catalytic stability even compared to the state-of-the-art Pt/C

undercoordinated Pt sites due to proximity effect can provide superior

Fluctuation-dominated phase ordering refers to a steady state in which the
magnitude of long-range order varies strongly owing to fluctuations, and to the
associated coarsening phenomena during the approach to steady state. Strong
fluctuations can lead to a number of interesting phenomena, including a cusp
singularity in the scaled correlation function, implying the breakdown of the
Porod Law. First identified in a nonequilibrium system of passively sliding
particles on a fluctuating surface, fluctuation-dominated order also occurs in
several other systems, including an equilibrium Ising model with long-range
interactions. This article discusses these systems, and others where clustering
effects are stronger.

The temperature dependence of the two superconducting gaps in pressurised H3S
at 155 GPa with a critical temperature of 203 K has been determined by data
analysis of the experimental curve of the upper critical magnetic field as a
function of temperature in the framework of the two bands s wave Eliashberg
theory, with two different phonon mediated intra-band Cooper pairing channels
in a regime of moderate strong couplings with the key role of the pair exchange
interaction between the two gaps giving the two non-diagonal terms of the
coupling tensor which are missing in the single band s wave Eliashberg theory.
The results provide the prediction of the different temperature dependence of
the small and large gaps as a function of temperature which provide evidence of
multi-gap superconductivity in H3S

A major challenge in the field of correlated electrons is the computation of
dynamical correlation functions. For comparisons with experiment, one is
interested in their real-frequency dependence. This is difficult to compute, as
imaginary-frequency data from the Matsubara formalism require analytic
continuation, a numerically ill-posed problem. Here, we apply quantum field
theory to the single-impurity Anderson model (AM), using the Keldysh instead of
the Matsubara formalism with direct access to the self-energy and dynamical
susceptibilities on the real-frequency axis. We present results from the
functional renormalization group (fRG) at one-loop level and from solving the
self-consistent parquet equations in the parquet approximation. In contrast to
previous Keldysh fRG works, we employ a parametrization of the four-point
vertex which captures its full dependence on three real-frequency arguments. We
compare our results to benchmark data obtained with the numerical
renormalization group and to second-order perturbation theory. We find that
capturing the full frequency dependence of the four-point vertex significantly
improves the fRG results compared to previous implementations, and that solving
the parquet equations yields the best agreement with the NRG benchmark data,
but is only feasible up to moderate interaction strengths. Our methodical
advances pave the way for treating more complicated models in the future.

Quantum diffusion is a major topic in condensed-matter physics, and the
Caldeira-Leggett model has been one of the most successful approaches to study
this phenomenon. Here, we generalize this model by coupling the bath to the
system through a Weyl fractional derivative. The Weyl fractional Langevin
equation is then derived without imposing a non-Ohmic macroscopic spectral
function for the bath. By investigating the short- and long-time behavior of
the mean squared displacement (MSD), we show that this model is able to
describe a large variety of anomalous diffusion. Indeed, we find ballistic,
sub-ballistic, and super-ballistic behavior for short times, whereas for long
times we find saturation, and sub- and super-diffusion.

Theoretical studies suggest that Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like electron-phonon
($e$-ph) interactions can mediate high-temperature bipolaronic
superconductivity that is robust against repulsive electron-electron
interactions. Here we present a comparative analysis of the pairing and
competing charge/bond correlations in the two-dimensional Holstein and optical
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models using numerically exact determinant quantum
Monte Carlo. We find that the SSH interactions support light bipolarons and
strong superconducting correlations out to relatively large values of the
$e$-ph coupling $\lambda$ and densities near half-filling, while the Holstein
interaction does not due to the formation of heavy bipolarons and competing
charge-density-wave order. We further find that the Holstein and SSH models
have comparable pairing correlations in the weak coupling limit for carrier
concentrations $\langle n \rangle \ll 1$, where competing orders and polaronic
effects are absent. These results support the proposal that SSH (bi)polarons
can support superconductivity to larger values of $\lambda$ in comparison to
the Holstein polaron, but that the resulting $T_\mathrm{c}$ gains are small in
the weak coupling limit. We also find that the SSH model's pairing correlations
are suppressed after including a weak on-site Hubbard repulsion. These results
have important implications for identifying and engineering bipolaronic
superconductivity.

We propose a spin photogalvanic effect of magnons with broken inversion
symmetry. The dc spin photocurrent is generated via the Aharonov-Casher effect,
which includes the Drude, Berry curvature dipole, shift, injection, and
rectification components with distinct quantum geometric origin. Based on a
symmetry classification, we uncover that there exist linearly polarized (LP)
magnon spin photocurrent responses in the breathing kagome-lattice ferromagnet
with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and the circularly polarized (CP)
responses due to the symmetry breaking by applying a uniaxial strain. We
address that the topological phase transitions can be characterized by the spin
photocurrents. This study presents a deeper insight into the nonlinear
responses of light-magnon interactions, and suggests a possible way to generate
and control the magnon spin current in real materials.

<br>
<br>
In this paper we investigate the effects of varying cation valency and
concentration on the rheology of entangled lambda DNA solutions. We show that
monovalent cations moderately increase the viscoelasticty of the solutions
mainly by stabilising linear condensation of lambda DNA ``monomers'' via
hybridisation of their sticky ends. On the contrary, divalent cations have a
far more complex and dramatic effect on the rheology of the solution and we
observe evidence of inter-molecular DNA-DNA bridging by Mg2+. We argue that
these results may be interesting in the context of dense solutions of single
and double stranded DNA, e.g. in vivo or in biotechnology applications such as
DNA origami and DNA hydrogels.

A light beam can be spatially structured in the complex amplitude to possess
orbital angular momentum (OAM), which introduces a new degree of freedom
alongside the intrinsic spin angular momentum (SAM) associated with circular
polarization. Moreover, super-imposing two twisted lights with distinct SAM and
OAM produces a vector vortex beam (VVB) in non-separable states where not only
complex amplitude but also polarization are spatially structured and entangled
with each other. In addition to the non-separability, the SAM and OAM in a VVB
are intrinsically coupled by the optical spin-orbit interaction and constitute
the profound spin-orbit physics in photonics. In this work, we present a
comprehensive theoretical investigation, implemented on the first-principles
base, of the intriguing light-matter interaction between VVBs and WSe$_{2}$
monolayers (WSe$_{2}$-MLs), one of the best-known and promising two-dimensional
(2D) materials in optoelectronics dictated by excitons, encompassing bright
exciton (BX) as well as various dark excitons (DXs). One of the key findings of
our study is the substantial enhancement of the photo-excitation of gray
excitons (GXs), a type of spin-forbidden dark exciton, in a WSe$_2$-ML through
the utilization of a twisted light that possesses a longitudinal field
associated with the optical spin-orbit interaction. Our research demonstrates
that a spin-orbit-coupled VVB surprisingly allows for the imprinting of the
carried optical information onto gray excitons in 2D materials, which is robust
against the decoherence mechanisms in materials. This observation suggests a
promising method for deciphering the transferred angular momentum from
structured lights to excitons.

When electrolyte solutions are confined in micro- and nanochannels their
conductivity is significantly different from those in a bulk phase. Here we
revisit the theory of this phenomenon by focusing attention on the reduction in
the ion mobility with the concentration of salt and a consequent impact to the
conductivity of a solution, from bulk to confined in a narrow slit. Equations
for the zeta potentials and mobilities of ions are derived and used to obtain
the expression for a bulk conductivity valid in a much larger concentration
range than it was in earlier theories. By extending the formalism to the
electrolyte solution in the charged channel the equations describing the
conductivity in different modes are presented. They can be regarded as a
generalization of prior work on the channel conductivity to a more realistic
case of a nonzero reduction of the zeta potential and electrophoretic mobility
of ions with salt concentration. Our analysis provides a framework for
interpreting measurements on the conductivity of electrolyte solutions in the
bulk and in narrow channels

A design concept is introduced for the building block, a dot, of programmable
braille readers utilizing bistable shell buckling, magnetic actuation, and
pneumatic loading. The design process is guided by Finite Element simulations,
which are initially validated through precision experiments conducted on a
scaled-up, single-shell model system. Then, the simulations are leveraged to
systematically explore the design space, adhering to the standardized geometric
and physical specifications of braille systems. The findings demonstrate the
feasibility of selecting design parameters that satisfy both geometric
requirements and blocking forces under moderate magnetic fields, facilitated by
pneumatic loading to switch between the two stable states. The advantages of
the proposed design include the reversible bistability of the actuators and
fast state-switching via a transient magnetic field. While the study is focused
on experimentally validated numerical simulations, several manufacturing
challenges that need to be resolved for future physical implementations are
identified.

Zeolites are inorganic materials known for their diversity of applications,
synthesis conditions, and resulting polymorphs. Although their synthesis is
controlled both by inorganic and organic synthesis conditions, computational
studies of zeolite synthesis have focused mostly on organic template design. In
this work, we use a strong distance metric between crystal structures and
machine learning (ML) to create inorganic synthesis maps in zeolites. Starting
with 253 known zeolites, we show how the continuous distances between
frameworks reproduce inorganic synthesis conditions from the literature without
using labels such as building units. An unsupervised learning analysis shows
that neighboring zeolites according to our metric often share similar inorganic
synthesis conditions, even in template-based routes. In combination with ML
classifiers, we find synthesis-structure relationships for 14 common inorganic
conditions in zeolites, namely Al, B, Be, Ca, Co, F, Ga, Ge, K, Mg, Na, P, Si,
and Zn. By explaining the model predictions, we demonstrate how
(dis)similarities towards known structures can be used as features for the
synthesis space. Finally, we show how these methods can be used to predict
inorganic synthesis conditions for unrealized frameworks in hypothetical
databases and interpret the outcomes by extracting local structural patterns
from zeolites. In combination with template design, this work can accelerate
the exploration of the space of synthesis conditions for zeolites.

<br>
<br>
The microscopic mechanism of Cooper pairing in a superconductor leaves its
fingerprint on the symmetry of the order parameter. UTe$_2$ has been inferred
to have a multi-component order parameter that entails exotic effects like time
reversal symmetry breaking. However, recent experimental observations in
newer-generation samples have raised questions about this interpretation,
pointing to the need for a direct experimental probe of the order parameter
symmetry. Here, we use pulse echo ultrasound to measure the elastic moduli of
samples of UTe$_2$ that exhibit both one and two superconducting transitions.
We demonstrate the absence of thermodynamic discontinuities in the shear
elastic moduli of both single- and double-transition samples, providing direct
evidence that UTe$_2$ has a single-component superconducting order parameter.
We further show that the superconductivity is highly sensitive to compression
strain along the $a$ and $c$ axes, but insensitive to strain along the $b$
axis. This leads us to suggest a single-component, odd-parity order
parameter$-$specifically the B$_{2u}$ order parameter$-$as the most likely
order parameter in UTe$_2$.

We investigated the dynamics of a binary mixture (water and epoxy resin)
confined within van der Waals (vdW) walls using molecular dynamics simulations.
We discovered a novel phenomenon named perpendicular separations of two phases
(PSTP). In the initial stage, central water molecules diffused, subsequently
condensing symmetrically within the confinement's mid-plane. In the later
stage, as water droplets nucleate and grow, the resin separates perpendicularly
into two films due to the action of bubblers and vdW walls, resulting in a
hollow nanochannel. The mechanisms and conditions underlying PSTS are
discussed. The results indicate that the concentration (C) of resin in the
middle region is linearly decreased with temporal power and linearly decreased
with time in the very last stage. Our findings could shed light on the
manufacture of nanofilms and organic nanochannels, which could help advance
bio-detection and energy fields.

<h3>Breakdown of phonon band theory in MgO</h3>

<br>
<i>Gabriele Coiana, Johannes Lischner, Paul Tangney</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a series of detailed images of the distribution of kinetic energy
among frequencies and wavevectors in the bulk of an MgO crystal as it is heated
slowly until it melts. These spectra, which are Fourier transforms of
velocity-velocity correlation functions calculated from accurate molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations, provide a valuable perspective on the growth of
thermal disorder in ionic crystals. We use them to explain why the most
striking and rapidly-progressing departures from a band structure occur among
longitudinal optical (LO) modes, which would be the least active modes at low
temperature ($T$) if phonons did not interact. The degradation of the LO band
begins, at low $T$, as an anomalously-large broadening of modes near the center
of the Brillouin zone (BZ), which gradually spreads towards the BZ boundary.
The LO band all but vanishes before the crystal melts, and transverse optical
(TO) modes' spectral peaks become so broad that the TO branches no longer
appear band-like. Acoustic bands remain relatively well defined until melting
of the crystal manifests in the spectra as their sudden disappearance. We argue
that, even at high $T$, the long wavelength acoustic (LWA) phonons of an ionic
crystal can remain partially immune to disorder generated by its LO phonons;
whereas, even at low $T$, its LO phonons can be strongly affected by LWA
phonons. This is because LO displacements average out in much less than the
period of an LWA phonon; whereas during each period of an LO phonon an LWA
phonon appears as a quasistatic perturbation of the crystal, which warps the LO
mode's intrinsic electric field. LO phonons are highly sensitive to acoustic
warping of their intrinsic fields because their frequencies depend strongly on
them: They cause the large frequency difference between LO and TO bands known
as {\em LO-TO splitting}.

<br>

Surface-enhanced spectroscopy techniques are the method-of-choice to
characterize adsorbed intermediates occurring during electrochemical reactions,
which are crucial in realizing a green sustainable future. Characterizing
species with low coverages or short lifetimes have so far been limited by low
signal enhancement. Recently, metasurface-driven surface-enhanced infrared
absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) has been pioneered as a promising narrowband
technology to study single vibrational modes of electrochemical interfaces
during CO oxidation. However, many reactions involve several species or
configurations of adsorption that need to be monitored simultaneously requiring
reproducible and broadband sensing platforms to provide a clear understanding
of the underlying electrochemical processes. Here, we experimentally realize
multi-band metasurface-driven SEIRAS for the in-situ study of electrochemical
CO2 reduction on a Pt surface. We develop an easily reproducible and
spectrally-tunable platinum nano-slot metasurface. Two CO adsorption
configurations at 2030 cm-1 and 1840 cm-1 are locally enhanced as a proof of
concept that can be extended to more vibrational bands. Our platform provides a
41-fold enhancement in the detection of characteristic absorption signals
compared to conventional broadband electrochemically roughened platinum films.
A straightforward methodology is outlined starting by baselining our system in
CO saturated environment and clearly detecting both configurations of
adsorption, in particular the hitherto hardly detectable CO bridge
configuration. Then, thanks to the signal enhancement provided by our platform,
we find that the CO bridge configuration on platinum does not play a
significant role during CO2 reduction in an alkaline environment. We anticipate
that our technology will guide researchers in developing similar sensing
platforms.

Elastomeric mechanical metamaterials exhibit unconventional mechanical
behaviour owing to their complex microstructures. A clear transition in the
effective properties emerges under compressive loading, which is triggered by
local instabilities and pattern transformations of the underlying cellular
microstructure. Such transformations trigger a non-local mechanical response
resulting in strong size effects. For predictive modelling of engineering
applications, the effective homogenized material properties are generally of
interest. For mechanical metamaterials, these can be obtained in an expensive
manner by ensemble averaging of the direct numerical simulations for a series
of translated microstructures, applicable especially in the regime of small
separation of scales. To circumvent this expensive step, computational
homogenization methods are of benefit, employing volume averaging instead.
Classical first-order computational homogenization, which relies on the
standard separation of scales principle, is unable to capture any size and
boundary effects. Second-order computational homogenization has the ability to
capture strain gradient effects at the macro-scale, thus accounting for the
presence of non-localities. Another alternative is micromorphic computational
homogenization scheme, which is tailored to pattern-transforming metamaterials
by incorporating prior kinematic knowledge. In this contribution, a systematic
study is performed, assessing the predictive ability of computational
homogenization schemes in the realm of elastomeric metamaterials. Three
representative examples with distinct mechanical loading are employed for this
purpose: uniform compression and bending of an infinite specimen, and
compression of a finite specimen. Qualitative and quantitative analyses are
performed for each of the load cases where the ensemble average solution is set
as a reference.

Persistent currents in quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates become
chiral in the presence of current-density interactions. This phenomenon is
explored in ultracold atoms loaded in a rotating ring geometry, where diverse
current-carrying stationary states are analytically found to generalize
previously known solutions to the mean-field equations of motion. Their
dynamical stability is tested by numerical simulations that show stable
currents for states with both constant and modulated density profiles, while
decaying currents appear only beyond a unidirectional velocity threshold.
Recent experiments in the field make these states within experimental reach.

The topotactic intercalation of transition-metal dichalcogenides with atomic
or molecular ions acts as an efficient knob to tune the electronic ground state
of the host compound. A representative material in this sense is
1$T$-TiSe$_{2}$, where the electric-field-controlled intercalations of lithium
or hydrogen trigger superconductivity coexisting with the charge-density wave
phase. Here, we use the nuclear magnetic moments of the intercalants in
hydrogen-intercalated 1$T$-TiSe$_{2}$ as local probes for nuclear magnetic
resonance experiments. We argue that fluctuating mesoscopic-sized domains
nucleate already at temperatures higher than the bulk critical temperature to
the charge-density wave phase and display cluster-glass-like dynamics in the
MHz range tracked by the $^{1}$H nuclear moments. Additionally, we observe a
well-defined independent dynamical process at lower temperatures that we
associate with the intrinsic properties of the charge-density wave state. In
particular, we ascribe the low-temperature phenomenology to the collective
phason-like motion of the charge-density wave being hindered by structural
defects and chemical impurities and resulting in a localized oscillating
motion.

We investigate resonance phenomena in a system consisting of a nanomagnet
coupled to a Josephson junction under external periodic drive. The coupling in
the system leads to appearance of additional resonance peaks whose properties
depend on the periodic signal and Josephson junction dynamics. In the linear
regime, we derive an analytical description of the resonance phenomena which is
then confirmed by numerical simulations. This analytical method is universal
and can be also applied to Josephson junctions with anomalous phase shift in
current phase relation. This work provides a new method of controlling the
resonances of hybrid structures, which may be interesting for applications.

Critical behaviour study in magnetism is important owing to its application
for understanding the nature of underlying spin-spin interactions by
determining the critical parameters in the vicinity of a phase transition. In
this article, we report the novel manifestation of crossover behaviour between
two universality classes governing spin interaction across the ferromagnetic
Curie temperature $T_C$ in critical scaling of anomalous hall conductivity
isotherms for a skyrmion-hosting itinerant ferromagnet
Co$_{6.5}$Ru$_{1.5}$Zn$_{8}$Mn$_4$. Along with the magnetotransport scaling,
the traditional critical behaviour of magnetic isotherms yields $\beta$ = 0.423
$\pm$ 0.004, $\gamma$ = 1.08 $\pm$ 0.016, and $\delta$ = 3.553 $\pm$ 0.009
suggesting the 3D Heisenberg and Mean field type of spin interactions below and
above $T_C$, respectively. The isotropic magnetic exchange strength decays as
$J(r) \approx r^{ -4.617}$, implying the prevalence of crossover from
long-range ordering to short-range type interaction. In addition, the existence
of a fluctuation-disordered magnetic phase immediately below $T_C$ has been
observed in the magnetocaloric effect. The novel approach of generating a
low-field phase diagram employing the quantitative criterion of phase
transition from the scaling of isothermal magneto-entropic change shows an
excellent convergence with the phase boundaries obtained from conventional
magnetic and anomalous Hall conductivity scaling. This simultaneous scaling of
magnetization and AHC isotherms for systems with crossover behaviour
establishes the universality of the magnetotransport-based critical scaling
approach which still remains in its infancy.

<br>
<br>
The interactions of solid objects with granular media is countered by a
resistance force that stems from frictional forces between the grains and the
media's resistance to inertia imposed by the intruder. Earlier theories of
granular intrusion have suggested an additive contribution of these two
families of forces and had tremendous success in predicting resistive forces on
arbitrary shaped objects. However, it remains unclear how these forces are
influenced by gravitational conditions. We examine the role of gravity on
surface impact behavior into cohesionless granular media using hundreds of
soft-sphere discrete element simulations, we demonstrate that the outcome of
impacts remain qualitatively similar under varying gravitational conditions if
initial velocities are scaled with the Froude number, suggesting an underlying
law. Using theoretical arguments, we provide reasoning for the observed
universality and show that there is a hidden dependency in resistive forces
into granular media on Froude number. Following the theoretical framework, we
show that Froude number scaling precisely collapses impact trajectories across
gravitational conditions, setting the foundation for explorations in granular
behavior beyond Earth.

The electronic, the thermal, and the optical properties of hexagonal MgX
monolayers (where X=C, N, and O) are investigated via first principles studies.
Ab-initio molecular dynamic, AIMD, simulations using NVT ensembles are
performed to check the thermodynamic stability of the monolayers. We find that
an MgO monolayer has semiconductor properties with a good thermodynamic
stability, while the MgC and the MgN monolayers have metallic characters. The
calculated phonon band structures of all the three considered monolayers shows
no imaginary nonphysical frequencies, thus indicating that they all have
excellent dynamic stability. The MgO monolayer has a larger heat capacity then
the MgC and the MgN monolayers. The metallic monolayers demonstrate optical
response in the IR as a consequence of the metal properties, whereas the
semiconducting MgO monolayer demonstrates an active optical response in the
near-UV region. The optical response in the near-UV is beneficial for
nanoelectronics and photoelectric applications. A semiconducting monolayer is a
great choice for thermal management applications since its thermal properties
are more attractive than those of the metallic monolayer in terms of heat
capacity, which is related to the change in the internal energy of the system.

The discovery of the Hat, an aperiodic monotile, has revealed novel
mathematical aspects of aperiodic tilings. However, the physics of particles
propagating in such a setting remains unexplored. In this work we study
spectral and transport properties of a tight-binding model defined on the Hat.
We find that (i) the spectral function displays striking similarities to that
of graphene, including six-fold symmetry and Dirac-like features; (ii) unlike
graphene, the monotile spectral function is chiral, differing for its two
enantiomers; (iii) the spectrum has a macroscopic number of degenerate states
at zero energy; (iv) when the magnetic flux per plaquette ($\phi$) is half of
the flux quantum, zero-modes are found localized around the reflected
`anti-hats'; and (v) its Hofstadter spectrum is periodic in $\phi$, unlike
other quasicrystals. Our work serves as a basis to study wave and electron
propagation in possible experimental realizations of the Hat, which we suggest.

We develop a practical machine learning approach to determine the disorder
landscape of Majorana nanowires by using training of the conductance matrix and
inverting the conductance data in order to obtain the disorder details in the
system. The inversion carried out through machine learning using different
disorder parametrizations turns out to be unique in the sense that any input
tunnel conductance as a function of chemical potential and Zeeman energy can
indeed be inverted to provide the correct disorder landscape. Our work opens up
a qualitatively new direction of directly determining the topological invariant
and the Majorana wave-function structure corresponding to a transport profile
of a device using simulations that quantitatively match the specific
conductance profile. In addition, this also opens up the possibility for
optimizing Majorana systems by figuring out the (generally unknown) underlying
disorder only through the conductance data. An accurate estimate of the
applicable spin-orbit coupling in the system can also be obtained within the
same scheme.
