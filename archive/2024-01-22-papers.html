<h3>Motility and pair-wise interactions of chemically active droplets in 1-D  confinement</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11154" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11154</a>

<i>Pawan Kumar, Prateek Dwivedi, Sobiya Ashraf, Dipin Pillai, Rahul Mangal</i>
<p>Self-propelled droplets serve as ideal model systems to delve deeper into
understanding of the motion of biological micro-swimmers by simulating their
motility. Biological microorganisms are renowned for showcasing a diverse array
of dynamic swimming behaviors when confronted with physical constraints. This
study aims to elucidate the impact of physical constraints on swimming
characteristics of biological microorganisms. To achieve this, we present
observations on the individual and pair-wise behavior of micellar solubilized
self-propelled 4-Cyano-4'-pentyl-biphenyl (5CB) oil droplets in a square
capillary channel filled with a surfactant trimethyl ammonium bromide (TTAB)
aqueous solution. To explore the effect of the underlying P\'eclet ($Pe$)
number of the swimming droplets, the study is also performed in the presence of
additives such as high molecular weight polymer Polyethylene oxide (PEO) and
molecular solute glycerol. The capillary confinement restricts droplet to
predominantly one-dimensional (1D) motion, albeit with noticeable differences
in their motion across the three scenarios. Through a characterization of the
chemical and hydrodynamic flow fields surrounding the droplets, we illustrate
that the modification of the droplets' chemical field due to confinement varies
significantly based on the underlying differences in the P\'eclet number ($Pe$)
in these cases. This alteration in the chemical field distribution notably
affects the individual droplets' motion. Moreover, these distinct chemical
field interactions between the droplets also lead to variations in their
pair-wise motion, ranging from behaviors like chasing to scattering.

<h3>Topological pumping induced by spatiotemporal modulation of interaction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10906" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10906</a>
<br>
<i>Boning Huang, Yongguan Ke, Wenjie Liu, Chaohong Lee</i>
<p>Particle-particle interaction provides a new degree of freedom to induce
novel topological phenomena. Here, we propose to use spatiotemporal modulation
of interaction to realize topological pumping without single-particle
counterpart. Because the modulation breaks time-reversal symmetry, the
multiparticle energy bands of bound states have none-zero Chern number, and
support topological bound edge states. In a Thouless pump, a bound state that
uniformly occupies a topological energy band can be shifted by integer unit
cells per cycle, consistent with the corresponding Chern number. We can also
realize topological pumping of bound edge state from one end to another. The
entanglement entropy between particles rapidly increases at transition points,
which is related to the spatial spread of a bounded pair. In addition, we
propose to realize hybridized pumping with fractional displacement per cycle by
adding an extra tilt potential to separate topological pumping of the bound
state and Bloch oscillations of single particle. Our work could trigger further
studies of correlated topological phenomena that do not have a single-particle
counterpart.

<h3>Machine Learning of Knot Topology in Non-Hermitian Band Braids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10908" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10908</a>
<br>
<i>Jiangzhi Chen, Zi Wang, Yu-Tao Tan, Ce Wang, Jie Ren</i>
<p>The deep connection among braids, knots and topological physics has provided
valuable insights into studying topological states in various physical systems.
However, identifying distinct braid groups and knot topology embedded in
non-Hermitian systems is challenging and requires significant efforts. Here, we
demonstrate that an unsupervised learning with the representation basis of
$su(n)$ Lie algebra on $n$-fold extended non-Hermitian bands can fully classify
braid group and knot topology therein, without requiring any prior mathematical
knowledge or any pre-defined topological invariants. We demonstrate that the
approach successfully identifies different topological elements, such as
unlink, unknot, Hopf link, Solomon ring, trefoil, and so on, by employing
generalized Gell-Mann matrices in non-Hermitian models with $n$=2 and $n$=3
energy bands. Moreover, since eigenstate information of non-Hermitian bands is
incorporated in addition to eigenvalues, the approach distinguishes the
different parity-time symmetry and breaking phases, recognizes the opposite
chirality of braids and knots, and identifies out distinct topological phases
that were overlooked before. Our study shows significant potential of machine
learning in classification of knots, braid groups, and non-Hermitian
topological phases.

<h3>Symmetry-induced higher-order exceptional points in two dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10913" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10913</a>
<br>
<i>Anton Montag, Flore K. Kunst</i>
<p>Exceptional points of order $n$ (EP$n$s) appear in non-Hermitian systems as
points where the eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. Whereas EP2s
generically appear in two dimensions (2D), higher-order EPs require a
higher-dimensional parameter space to emerge. In this work, we provide a
complete characterization the appearance of symmetry-induced higher-order EPs
in 2D parameter space. We find that besides EP2s only EP3s, EP4s, and EP5s can
be stabilized in 2D. Moreover, these higher-order EPs must always appear in
pairs with their dispersion determined by the symmetries. Upon studying the
complex spectral structure around these EPs, we find that depending on the
symmetry, EP3s are accompanied by EP2 arcs, and 2- and 3-level open Fermi
structures. Similarly, EP4s and closely related EP5s, which arise due to
multiple symmetries, are accompanied by exotic EP arcs and open Fermi
structures. For each case, we provide an explicit example. We also comment on
the topological charge of these EPs, and discuss similarities and differences
between symmetry-protected higher-order EPs and EP2s.

<p>Ion Exchange chemical process in silicate glasses is discussed in terms of
equilibrium thermodynamics. Ion exchange equilibrium conditions are established
within the framework of classical thermodynamics. The result is defined in
terms of chemical potentials of exchanging ionic species. The proposed original
derivation is performed making use of the thermodynamics of subsystems. This
result is fundamental to allow the development of the equilibrium theory for
the evaluation of concentrations in the subsystems in terms of mixture theory.
Interaction energies of the exchanging components within the subsystems

<i>R. R. S. Oliveira</i>
<p>In this comment, we showed that the Dirac equation in the screw dislocation
space-time also carries a term that represents the torsion of such topological
defect, given by $K_\mu$. Therefore, the Dirac equation worked by Wang et al.
is incomplete since such a term was ignored in your equation (what cannot
happen). In other words, it is only possible to work with the Dirac equation in
the form presented by Wang et al. if the space-time is torsion-free, which is
obviously not the case.

<h3>Moments and First-Passage Time of a Random Process for General Upper  Bounds on Fluctuations of Trajectory Observables</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10920" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10920</a>

<i>V. V. Ryazanov</i>
<p>General upper bounds on fluctuations of trajectory observables were recently
obtained. It turned out that the size of fluctuations of dynamical observable
is limited from below and from above. For the moment generating function of
general upper bounds on the size of fluctuations, the moments (average value
and variance) of the size of fluctuations are obtained. A more complex and
interesting task is to obtain the first-passage time for process of upper
bounds of reaching fluctuations of observables. Characteristic functions,
average values and variances of the first-passage time of reaching fluctuations
of observables of the trajectory of the Markov chain of positive and negative
levels are also obtained.

<h3>High Frequency Response of Volatile Memristors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10924" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10924</a>
<br>
<i>Ioannis Messaris, Alon Ascoli, Ahmet S. Demirkol, Vasileios Ntinas, Dimitrios Prousalis, Ronald Tetzlaff</i>
<p>In this theoretical study, we focus on the high-frequency response of the
electrothermal NbO2-Mott threshold switch, a real-world electronic device,
which has been proved to be relevant in several applications and is classified
as a volatile memristor. Memristors of this kind, have been shown to exhibit
distinctive non-linear behaviors crucial for cutting-edge neuromorphic
circuits. In accordance with well-established models for these devices, their
resistances depend on their body temperatures, which evolve over time following
Newton's Law of Cooling. Here, we demonstrate that HP's NbO2-Mott memristor can
manifest up to three distinct steady-state oscillatory behaviors under a
suitable high-frequency periodic voltage input, showcasing increased
versatility despite its volatile nature. Additionally, when subjected to a
high-frequency periodic voltage signal, the device body temperature oscillates
with a negligible peak-to-peak amplitude. Since, the temperature remains almost
constant over an input cycle, the devices under study behave as linear
resistors during each input cycle. Based on these insights, this paper presents
analytical equations characterizing the response of the NbO2-Mott memristor to
high-frequency voltage inputs, demarcating regions in the state space where
distinct initial conditions lead to various asymptotic oscillatory behaviors.
Importantly, the mathematical methods introduced in this manuscript are
applicable to any volatile electrothermal resistive switch. Additionally, this
paper presents analytical equations that accurately reproduce the temperature
time-waveform of the studied device during both its transient and steady-state
phases when subjected to a zero-mean sinusoidal voltage input oscillating in
the high-frequency limit.

<h3>A scale-invariant large-area single-mode topological photonic cavity</h3>

<br>
<i>Zhongfu Li, Shiqi Li, Bei Yan, Hsun-Chi Chan, Jing Li, Jun Guan, Wengang Bi, Yuanjiang Xiang, Zhen Gao, Shuang Zhang, Peng Zhan, Zhenlin Wang, Biye Xie</i>
<p>Emergent collective modes in lattices give birth to many intriguing physical
phenomena in condensed matter physics. Among these collective modes, large-area
modes typically feature small level spacings, whilst a single mode tends to be
spatially tightly confined. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally
demonstrate a unique scale-invariant, large-area, and single-mode topological
cavity mode in a two-dimensional photonic crystal. This mode emerges from the
hybridization of the large-area fundamental Dirac mode and in-gap topological
corner modes. Remarkably, we find that the scale-invariant, large-area, and
single-mode topological cavity mode possesses unique chiralities and with a
tunable mode area under the change of the mass term of the inner topological
nontrivial lattice. We experimentally observe such topological cavity modes in
a 2D photonic system and demonstrate the robustness by introducing disorders in
the cavity structure. Our findings have propelled the forefront of higher-order
topology research, transitioning it from single-lattice systems to
multi-lattice systems and may support promising potential applications,
particularly in vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers.

<h3>Non-local origin and correlations in the Johnson noise at nonuniform  temperatures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10960" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10960</a>
<br>
<i>Jorge Berger</i>
<p>We review the description of the Johnson noise as a particular case of
Brownian motion and compare it with Nyquist's description. Motivated by the
analysis of a simple circuit with two resistors, we hypothesize that the
electric field that generates the Johnson noise originates from all the
conducting material that makes up the circuit. We build a workable one
dimensional model for a gas of particles that undergo stochastic collisions
with the lattice and distance-dependent inter-particle interaction. Simulations
with this model predict that in the case of a circuit with nonuniform
temperature, the strength of the Johnson noise at a segment of the circuit is
influenced by the temperature at other parts of the circuit in an essentially
non-local way.

<h3>Energy-based stochastic resetting can avoid noise-enhanced stability</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10964" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10964</a>
<br>
<i>Julia Cantisán, Alexandre R. Nieto, Jesús M. Seoane, Miguel A.F. Sanjuán</i>
<p>The theory of stochastic resetting asserts that restarting a stochastic
process can expedite its completion. In this paper, we study the escape process
of a Brownian particle in an open Hamiltonian system that suffers
noise-enhanced stability. This phenomenon implies that under specific noise
amplitudes the escape process is delayed. Here, we propose a new protocol for
stochastic resetting that can avoid the noise-enhanced stability effect. In our
approach, instead of resetting the trajectories at certain time intervals, a
trajectory is reset when a predefined energy threshold is reached. The
trajectories that delay the escape process are the ones that lower their energy
due to the stochastic fluctuations. Our resetting approach leverages this fact
and avoids long transients by resetting trajectories before they reach low
energy levels. Finally, we show that the chaotic dynamics (i.e., the sensitive
dependence on initial conditions) catalyzes the effectiveness of the resetting
strategy.

<h3>Mixed state topological order parameters for symmetry protected fermion  matter</h3>

<br>
<i>Ze-Min Huang, Sebastian Diehl</i>
<p>We construct an observable mixed state topological order parameter for
symmetry-protected free fermion matter. It resolves the entire table of
topological insulators and superconductors, relying exclusively on the symmetry
class, but not on unitary symmetries. It provides a robust, quantized signal
not only for pure ground states, but also for mixed states in- or out of
thermal equilibrium. Key ingredient is a unitary probe operator, whose phase
can be related to spectral asymmetry, in turn revealing the topological
properties of the underlying state. This is demonstrated analytically in the
continuum limit, and validated numerically on the lattice. The order parameter
is experimentally accessible via either interferometry or full counting
statistics, for example, in cold atom experiments.

<h3>Lattice dynamics of quasi-2D perovskites from first-principles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10994" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10994</a>
<br>
<i>Emily Y. Chen, Bartomeu Monserrat</i>
<p>We present the vibrational properties and phonon dispersion for quasi-2D
hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (BA)$_2$CsPb$_2$I$_7$,
(HA)$_2$CsPb$_2$I$_7$, (BA)$_2$(MA)Pb$_2$I$_7$, and (HA)$_2$(MA)Pb$_2$I$_7$
calculated from first principles. Given the highly complex nature of these
compounds, we first perform careful benchmarking and convergence testing to
identify suitable parameters to describe their structural features and
vibrational properties. We find that the inclusion of van der Waals corrections
on top of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange-correlation
functionals provides the best agreement for the equilibrium structure relative
to experimental data. We then compute vibrational properties under the harmonic
approximation. We find that stringent energy cut-offs are required to obtain
well-converged phonon properties, and once converged, the harmonic
approximation can capture key physics for such a large, hybrid
inorganic-organic system with vastly different atom types, masses, and
interatomic interactions. We discuss the obtained phonon modes and dispersion
behavior in the context of known properties for bulk 3D perovskites and ligand
molecular crystals. While many vibrational properties are inherited from the
parent systems, we also observe unique coupled vibrations that cannot be
associated with vibrations of the pure constituent perovskite and ligand
subphases. Dispersive low energy phonon branches primarily occur in the
in-plane direction and within the perovskite subphase, and arise from bending
and breathing modes of the equatorial Pb-I network within the perovskite
octahedral plane.

<h3>Leveraging Domain Adaptation for Accurate Machine Learning Predictions  of New Halide Perovskites</h3>

<br>
<i>Dipannoy Das Gupta, Zachary J. L. Bare, Suxuen Yew, Santosh Adhikari, Brian DeCost, Qi Zhang, Charles Musgrave, Christopher Sutton</i>
<p>We combine graph neural networks (GNN) with an inexpensive and reliable
structure generation approach based on the bond-valence method (BVM) to train
accurate machine learning models for screening 222,960 halide perovskites using
statistical estimates of the DFT/PBE formation energy (Ef), and the PBE and HSE
band gaps (Eg). The GNNs were fined tuned using domain adaptation (DA) from a
source model, which yields a factor of 1.8 times improvement in Ef and 1.2 -
1.35 times improvement in HSE Eg compared to direct training (i.e., without
DA). Using these two ML models, 48 compounds were identified out of 222,960
candidates as both stable and that have an HSE Eg that is relevant for
photovoltaic applications. For this subset, only 8 have been reported to date,
indicating that 40 compounds remain unexplored to the best of our knowledge and
therefore offer opportunities for potential experimental examination.

<h3>Predictive power of a Bayesian effective action for fully-connected one  hidden layer neural networks in the proportional limit</h3>

<br>
<i>P. Baglioni, R. Pacelli, R. Aiudi, F. Di Renzo, A. Vezzani, R. Burioni, P. Rotondo</i>
<p>We perform accurate numerical experiments with fully-connected (FC)
one-hidden layer neural networks trained with a discretized Langevin dynamics
on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Our goal is to empirically determine the
regimes of validity of a recently-derived Bayesian effective action for shallow
architectures in the proportional limit. We explore the predictive power of the
theory as a function of the parameters (the temperature $T$, the magnitude of
the Gaussian priors $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_0$, the size of the hidden layer
$N_1$ and the size of the training set $P$) by comparing the experimental and
predicted generalization error. The very good agreement between the effective
theory and the experiments represents an indication that global rescaling of
the infinite-width kernel is a main physical mechanism for kernel
renormalization in FC Bayesian standard-scaled shallow networks.

<br>
<i>D.-Q. To, A. Rai, J. M. O. Zide, S. Law, J. Q. Xiao, M. B. Jungfleisch, M. F. Doty</i>
<p>The capability of magnons to hybridize and strongly couple with diverse
excitations offers a promising avenue for realizing and controlling emergent
properties that hold significant potential for applications in devices,
circuits, and information processing. In this letter, we present recent
theoretical and experimental developments in magnon-based hybrid systems,
focusing on the combination of magnon excitation in an antiferromagnet with
other excitations, namely plasmons in a topological insulator, phonons in a 2D
AFM, and photons. The existence of THz frequency magnons, plasmons, and phonons
makes magnon-based hybrid systems particularly appealing for
high-operating-speed devices. In this context, we explore several directions to
advance magnon hybrid systems, including strong coupling between a surface
plasmon and magnon polariton in a TI/AFM bilayer, a giant spin Nernst effect
induced by magnon phonon coupling in 2D AFMs, and control of magnon-photon
coupling using spin torque.

<h3>Anti-Jahn-Teller disproportionation and prospects for spin-triplet  superconductivity in d-element compounds</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11028" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11028</a>
<br>
<i>A. S. Moskvin, Yu. D. Panov</i>
<p>We argue that the unusual properties of a wide class of materials based on
Jahn-Teller 3d and 4d ions with different crystal and electronic structures,
from quasi-two-dimensional unconventional superconductors (cuprates,
nickelates, ferropnictides/chalcogenides, ruthenate SrRuO4), manganites with
local superconductivity to 3D ferrates (CaSr)FeO3, nickelates RNiO3 and silver
oxide AgO with unusual charge and magnetic order can be explained within a
single scenario. The properties of these materials are related to the
instability of their highly symmetric Jahn-Teller "progenitors" with the ground
orbital E-state to charge transfer with anti-Jahn-Teller disproportionation and
the formation of a system of effective local composite spin-singlet or
spin-triplet, electronic or hole bosons moving in a non-magnetic or magnetic
lattice. These unusual systems are characterized by an extremely rich variety
of phase states from non-magnetic and magnetic insulators to unusual metallic
and superconducting states.

<h3>Extremely strong spin-orbit coupling effect in light element  altermagnetic materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11065" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11065</a>
<br>
<i>Shuai Qu, Ze-Feng Gao, Hao Sun, Kai Liu, Peng-Jie Guo, Zhong-Yi Lu</i>
<p>Spin-orbit coupling is a key to realize many novel physical effects in
condensed matter physics, but the mechanism to achieve strong spin-orbit
coupling effect in light element antiferromagnetic compounds has not been
explored. In this work, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles
electronic structure calculations, we demonstrate that strong spin-orbit
coupling effect can be realized in light element altermagnetic materials, and
propose a mechanism for realizing the corresponding effective spin-orbit
coupling. This mechanism reveals the cooperative effect of crystal symmetry,
electron occupation, electronegativity, electron correlation, and intrinsic
spin-orbit coupling. Our work not only promotes the understanding of light
element compounds with strong spin-orbit coupling effect, but also provides an
alternative for realizing light element compounds with an effective strong
spin-orbit coupling.

<h3>Emergent bright excitons with Rashba spin-orbit coupling in atomic  monolayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11079" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11079</a>
<br>
<i>Jiayu David Cao, Gaofeng Xu, Benedikt Scharf, Konstantin Denisov, Igor Zutic</i>
<p>Optical properties in van der Waals heterostructures based on monolayer
transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), are often dominated by excitonic
transitions. While intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and an isotropic band
structure are typically studied in TMDs, in their heterostructures Rashba SOC
and trigonal warping (TW), resulting in bands with threefold anisotropy, are
also present. By considering a low-energy effective Hamiltonian and
Bethe-Salpeter equation, we study the effect of Rashba SOC and TW on the band
structure and absorption spectra. Rashba SOC is predicted to lead to emergent
excitons, which are identified as an admixture between 1s and 2p symmetries. In
contrast, for experimentally relevant values, TW has only a negligible effect
on the absorption spectrum. These findings could guide experimental
demonstrations of emergent bright excitons and further studies of the proximity
effects in van der Waals heterostructure.

<h3>Network evolution controlling strain-induced damage and self-healing of  elastomers with dynamic bonds</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11087" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11087</a>
<br>
<i>Yikai Yin, Shaswat Mohanty, Christopher B. Cooper, Zhenan Bao, Wei Cai</i>
<p>Highly stretchable and self-healable supramolecular elastomers are promising
materials for future soft electronics, biomimetic systems, and smart textiles,
due to their dynamic cross-linking bonds. The dynamic or reversible nature of
the cross-links gives rise to interesting macroscopic responses in these
materials such as self-healing and rapid stress-relaxation. However, the
relationship between bond activity and macroscopic mechanical response, and the
self-healing properties of these dynamic polymer networks (DPNs) remains poorly
understood. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations, we
reveal a fundamental connection between the macroscopic behaviors of DPNs and
the shortest paths between distant nodes in the polymer network. Notably, the
trajectories of the material on the shortest path-strain map provide key
insights into understanding the stress-strain hysteresis, anisotropy, stress
relaxation, and self-healing of DPNs. Based on CGMD simulations under various
loading histories, we formulate a set of empirical rules that dictate how the
shortest path interacts with stress and strain. This lays the foundation for
the development of a physics-based theory centered around the non-local
microstructural feature of shortest paths to predict the mechanical behavior of
DPNs.

<p>One-dimensional spin chain systems have received special attention to
discover the novel magnetic ground states and emergent phenomena, while the
magnetic studies on rare-earth (RE)-based 1D spin chain materials are still
rare. Here, we report the synthesis, structure and magnetic behaviors on a
family of tetragonal tungsten-bronze structure K2RENb5O15 (RE = Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm,
Gd-Ho) compounds, which consist of 1D linear spin-chain structure built by RE3+
ions along the c-axis and well spatially separated by the nonmagnetic K/Nb-O
polyhedrons with large interchain distances of ~ 8.80-8.88 {\AA} in the
ab-plane. The low temperature magnetic measurements reveal the absence of
long-range magnetic order down to 1.8 K for all serial K2RENb5O15 compounds and
the dominant ferromagnetic interactions for RE=Ce,Dy and antiferromagnetic
interactions for other members. Among them, K2GdNb5O15 with spin only magnetic
moment S=7/2, exhibits a long-range magnetic order with TN~0.31 K and strong
spin fluctuations at low temperatures due to its low-dimension characteristics.
Moreover, a large magnetocaloric effect under low field change of 0-2 T is
realized at temperatures below 1 K for K2GdNb5O15, letting it as an ideal
candidate for adiabatic magnetic refrigeration applications at sub-kelvin
temperatures. The K2RENb5O15 become a rare family of insulting RE-based magnets
to explore the novel 1D spin chain physics beyond the 3d TM-based counterparts,
in terms of its combination of low dimension, strong spin-orbital coupling and
the rich diversity of RE ions.

<br>
<i>Md. Ashraful Alam, F. Parvin, S. H. Naqib</i>
<p>We have investigated the structural, elastic, electronic, thermophysical,
superconducting, and optical properties of ScYH6 under uniform hydrostatic
pressures up to 25 GPa, using the density functional theory (DFT) formalism.
Most of results reported here are novel. The compound ScYH6 has been found to
be elastically and thermodynamically stable within the pressure range
considered. The compound is brittle; the brittleness decreases with increasing
pressure. The elastic anisotropy is low and the machinability index is moderate
which increases gradually with rising pressure. The compound is a hard
material. The electronic band structure shows weakly metallic character with
low density of states at the Fermi level. The Debye temperature of the compound
is high and increases with increasing pressure. The Gr\"uneisen parameter of
ScYH6 is low and the phonon thermal conductivity is high at room temperature.
The compound is a very efficient reflector of infrared radiation. The compound
is also an efficient absorber of visible and ultraviolet light. The overall
effect of pressure on optical parameters is small. We have also investigated
the pressure induced changes in the predicted superconducting state properties
by considering the changes in the electronic density of states at the Fermi
level, Debye temperature, and the repulsive Coulomb pseudopotential. The
superconducting transition temperature is found to increase gradually with
increasing pressure.

<h3>Valley filtering and valley valves in irradiated pristine graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11136" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11136</a>
<br>
<i>Rekha Kumari, Gopal Dixit, Arijit Kundu</i>
<p>We theoretically study valley-filtering in pristine graphene irradiated by
bicircular counter-rotating laser drive. The dynamical symmetry of the graphene
and laser drive disrupts graphene's inversion symmetry, which results distinct
quasi-energy states and Floquet band occupations in the two valleys.
Controlling the relative phase between the bicircular laser drive ultimately
allows to blocks the contribution from one valley while allowing the opposite
valley currents in the system. For practical realization of valley-based
device, we propose configurational setup for valley filters and valley valve
consisting of two graphene nanoribbons irradiated by two bicircular
counter-rotating laser drives with a relative phase shift. It is observed that
the relative phase between the two bicircular laser drives offer a control knob
to generate valley-selective currents and transport responses with very high
efficiency by an all-optical way. In addition, our findings about valley filter
and valley valve are robust against moderate disorder and modest changes in
driving laser parameters. Present work opens an avenue to realise light-based
valleytronics devices in reality.

<h3>Quasiparticle scattering in three-dimensional topological insulators  near the thickness limit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11157" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11157</a>
<br>
<i>Haiming Huang, Mu Chen, Dezhi Song, Jun Zhang, Ye-ping Jiang</i>
<p>In the ultra-thin regime, Bi2Te3 films feature two surfaces (with each
surface being a two-dimensional Dirac-fermion system) with complicated spin
textures and a tunneling term between them. We find in this regime that the
quasiparticle scattering is completely different compared with the thick-film
case and even behaves differently at each thickness. The thickness-dependent
warping effect and tunneling term are found to be the two main factors that
govern the scattering behaviors. The inter-band back-scattering that signals
the existence of a tunneling term is found to disappear at 4 quintuple layers
by the step-edge reflection approach. A four-band model is presented that
captures the main features of the thickness-dependent scattering behaviors. Our
work clarifies that the prohibition of back-scattering guaranteed by symmetry
in topological insulators breaks down in the ultra-thin regime.

<h3>Unveiling the stacking-dependent electronic properties of 2D ultrathin  rare-earth metalloxenes family LnX$_2$ (Ln = Eu, Gd, Dy; X = Ge, Si)</h3>

<br>
<i>Polina M. Sheverdyaeva, Alexey N. Mihalyuk, Jyh-Pin Chou, Andrey V. Matetskiy, Sergey V. Eremeev, Andrey V. Zotov, Alexander A. Saranin</i>
<p>The studies of electronic effects in reduced dimensionality have become a
frontier in nanoscience due to exotic and highly tunable character of quantum
phenomena. Recently, a new class of 2D ultrathin Ln$X_2$ metalloxenes composed
of a triangular lattice of lanthanide ions (Ln) coupled with 2D-Xenes of
silicene or germanene ($X_2$) was introduced and studied with a particular
focus on magnetic and transport properties. However, the electronic properties
of metalloxenes and their effective functionalization remain mainly unexplored.
Here, using a number of experimental and theoretical techniques, we trace the
evolution of electronic properties and magnetic ground state of metalloxenes
triggered by external perturbations. We demonstrate that the band structure of
Ln$X_2$ films can be uniquely modified by controlling the Xenes stacking,
thickness, varying the rare-earth and host elements, and applying an external
electric field. Our findings suggest new pathways to manipulate the electronic
properties of 2D rare-earth magnets that can be adjusted for spintronics
applications.

<h3>Phonon-mediated spin transport in quantum paraelectric metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11164" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11164</a>
<br>
<i>Kyoung-Min Kim, Suk Bum Chung</i>
<p>The concept of ferroelectricity is now often extended to include continuous
inversion symmetry-breaking transitions in various metals and doped
semiconductors. Paraelectric metals near ferroelectric quantum criticality,
which we term `quantum paraelectric metals,' typically possess soft transverse
optical phonons that have Rashba-type coupling to itinerant electrons in the
presence of spin-orbit coupling. We find through the Kubo formula calculation
that such Rashba electron-phonon coupling has a profound impact on electron
spin transport. While the spin Hall effect arising from non-trivial electronic
band structures has been studied extensively, we find here the presence of the
Rashba electron-phonon coupling can give rise to spin current, including spin
Hall current, in response to an inhomogeneous electric field even with a
completely trivial band structure. Furthermore, this spin conductivity displays
unconventional characteristics, such as quadrupolar symmetry associated with
the wave vector of the electric field and a thermal activation behavior
characterized by scaling laws dependent on the phonon frequency to temperature
ratio. These findings shed light on exotic electronic transport phenomena
originating from ferroelectric quantum criticality, highlighting the intricate
interplay of charge and spin degrees of freedom.

<h3>Effect of Persistent Noise on the XY Model and Two-Dimensional Crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11175" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11175</a>
<br>
<i>Xia-qing Shi, Hugues Chaté</i>
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) crystals made of active particles were shown recently to
be able to experience extremely large spontaneous deformations without melting.
The root of this phenomenon was argued to lie in the time-persistence of the
orientation of the intrinsic axes of particles. Here, we pursue this idea and
consider passive systems subjected to time-persistent external perturbations.
We first study a 2D XY model subjected to time-correlated noise and find that
it can remain quasi-ordered in spite of correlations decaying much faster than
allowed in equilibrium. We then study a simple model of a passive 2D crystal
immersed in a bath of active particles, and show that it can sustain large
deformations without melting.

<h3>Salt Effects on Ionic Conductivity Mechanisms in Ethylene Carbonate  Electrolytes: Interplay of Viscosity and Ion-ion Relaxations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11182" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11182</a>
<br>
<i>Hema Teherpuria, Sapta Sindhu Paul Chowdhury, Sridhar Kumar Kannam, Prabhat K. Jaiswal, Santosh Mogurampelly</i>
<p>The intricate role of shear viscosity and ion-pair relaxations on ionic
conductivity mechanisms and the underlying changes induced by salt
concentration ($c$) in organic liquid electrolytes remain poorly understood
despite their widespread technological importance. Using molecular dynamics
simulations employing nonpolarizable force fields for $c$ ranging between
10$^{-3}$ to 101 M, we show that the low and high $c$ regimes of the EC-LiTFSI
electrolytes are distinctly characterized by $\eta\sim\tau_c^{1/2}$ and
$\eta\sim\tau_c^{1}$, where $\eta$ and $\tau_c$ are shear viscosity and
cation-anion relaxation timescales, respectively. Our extensive simulations and
analyses suggest a universal relationship between the ionic conductivity and c
as $\sigma(c)\sim c^{\alpha}e^{-c/c_{0}} (\alpha>0)$. The proposed relationship
convincingly explains the ionic conductivity over a wide range of $c$, where
the term $c^\alpha$ accounts for the uncorrelated motion of ions and
$e^{-c/c_0}$ captures the salt-induced changes in shear viscosity. Our
simulations suggest vehicular mechanism to be dominant at low $c$ regime which
transition into a Grotthuss mechanism at high $c$ regime, where structural
relaxation is the dominant form of ion transport mechanism. Our findings shed
light on some of the fundamental aspects of the ion conductivity mechanisms in
liquid electrolytes, offering insights into optimizing the ion transport in
EC-LiTFSI electrolytes.

<br>
<i>Kaijun Shen, Kewei Sun, Maxim F. Gelin, Yang Zhao</i>
<p>Employing the numerically accurate multiple Davydov Ansatz in combination
with the thermo-field dynamics approach, we delve into interplay of the
finite-temperature dynamics of holes and magnons in an antiferromagnet, which
allows for scrutinizing previous predictions from self-consistent Born
approximation while offering, for the first time, accurate finite-temperature
computation of detailed magnon dynamics as a response and a facilitator to the
hole motion. The study also uncovers pronounced temperature dependence of the
magnon and hole populations, pointing to the feasibility of potential thermal
manipulation and control of hole dynamics. Our methodology can be applied not
only to the calculation of steady-state angular-resolved photoemission spectra,
but also to the simulation of femtosecond terahertz pump-probe and other
nonlinear signals for the characterization of antiferromagnetic materials.

<h3>Frustrations in the ground state of a dilute Ising chain in a magnetic  field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11216" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11216</a>
<br>
<i>Yury Panov</i>
<p>The properties of the ground state of one of the simplest models of
frustrated magnetic systems, a dilute Ising chain in a magnetic field, are
considered for all values of the concentration of charged non-magnetic
impurities. An analytical method is proposed for calculating the residual
entropy of frustrated states, including states at the boundaries between the
phases of the ground state, which is based on the Markov property of the system
under consideration and allows direct generalization to other one-dimensional
spin models with Ising-type interactions. The properties of local distributions
and concentration dependences of the composition, correlation functions,
magnetization and entropy of the phases of the ground state of the model are
investigated. It is shown that the field-induced transition from the
antiferromagnetic ground state to the frustrated one is accompanied by charge
ordering and the absence of pseudo-transitions in the dilute Ising chain is
proved.

<h3>Electric-field-enhanced second-harmonic domain contrast and  nonreciprocity in a van der Waals antiferromagnet</h3>

<br>
<i>Ziqian Wang, Meng Wang, Jannis Lehmann, Yuki Shiomi, Taka-hisa Arima, Naoto Nagaosa, Yoshinori Tokura, Naoki Ogawa</i>
<p>Imaging antiferromagnetic 180{\deg} domains with actively controlled
visibility is vital for both fundamental science and sophisticated
applications. While optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) is a well-known
technique for distinguishing such domains in non-centrosymmetric
antiferromagnets, a general material-based strategy to control domain contrast
remains elusive. Using van der Waals antiferromagnet MnPS$_3$ as a proof of
concept, we demonstrate the tuning of nonreciprocity-induced domain contrast in
SHG through applying an in-plane electric field that transforms the magnetic
point group to its unitary subgroup. The interference among intrinsic
electric-dipole, magnetic-dipole, and field-induced electric-dipole
transitions, each carrying distinct characters under space-inversion
($\mathcal{P}$) and time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) operations, enables large
tuning of domain contrast and nonreciprocity in a broad spectral range. This
strategy, generically applicable to systems characterized by
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric magnetic groups with a polar unitary subgroup, offers
a path to fast electrical modulation of nonlinear nonreciprocal photonic
behaviors using antiferromagnets.

<h3>Multi-objective optimization for targeted self-assembly among competing  polymorphs</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11234" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11234</a>
<br>
<i>Sambarta Chatterjee, William M. Jacobs</i>
<p>While inverse approaches for designing crystalline materials typically focus
on the thermodynamic stability of a target polymorph, the outcome of a
self-assembly process is often controlled by kinetic pathways. A prototypical
example is the design of an isotropic pair potential to guide the self-assembly
of a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, which is a challenging problem due to
the existence of competing crystal polymorphs. Here we present a
machine-learning-guided approach to explore potentials that maximize both the
thermodynamic stability and kinetic accessibility of the honeycomb polymorph.
Optimal pair potentials exist along a Pareto front, indicating a trade-off
between these objectives. We show that this trade-off is density-dependent and
arises from a competition between crystal polymorphs: Kinetically optimal
potentials that favor the honeycomb polymorph on short timescales tend to
stabilize a triangular polymorph at long times. Finally, we explore the
fundamental limits of optimization algorithms based on ensembles of short
trajectories, which can find potentials close to the kinetically optimal region
of the Pareto Front. Our work reveals fundamental trade-offs between
crystallization speed and accuracy in the presence of competing polymorphs and
suggests guiding principles for the development of materials design algorithms
that optimize for kinetic accessibility.

<h3>Accurate Description of Ion Migration in Solid-State Ion Conductors from  Machine-Learning Molecular Dynamics</h3>

<br>
<i>Takeru Miyagawa, Namita Krishnan, Manuel Grumet, Christian Reverón Baecker, Waldemar Kaiser, David A. Egger</i>
<p>Solid-state ion conductors (SSICs) have emerged as a promising material class
for electrochemical storage devices and novel compounds of this kind are
continuously being discovered. High-throughout approaches that enable a rapid
screening among the plethora of candidate SSIC compounds have been essential in
this quest. While first-principles methods are routinely exploited in this
context to provide atomic-level details on ion migration mechanisms, dynamic
calculations of this type are computationally expensive and limit us in the
time- and length-scales accessible during the simulations. Here, we explore the
potential of recently developed machine-learning force fields for predicting
different ion migration mechanisms in SSICs. Specifically, we systematically
investigate three classes of SSICs that all exhibit complex ion dynamics
including vibrational anharmonicities: AgI, a strongly disordered Ag$^+$
conductor; Na$_3$SbS$_4$, a Na$^+$ vacancy conductor; and
Li$_{10}$GeP$_2$S$_{12}$, which features concerted Li$^+$ migration. Through
systematic comparison with \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics data, we
demonstrate that machine-learning molecular dynamics provides very accurate
predictions of the structural and vibrational properties including the complex
anharmonic dynamics in these SSICs. The \textit{ab initio} accuracy of
machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations at relatively low computational
cost open a promising path toward the rapid design of novel SSICs.

<h3>Charge transfer transitions and circular magnetooptics in ferrites</h3>

<br>
<i>Alexander Moskvin</i>
<p>The concept of charge-transfer (CT) transitions in ferrites is based on the
cluster approach and takes into account the relevant interactions as the
low-symmetry crystal field, spin-orbital, Zeeman, exchange and
exchange-relativistic interactions. For all its simplicity, this concept yield
a reliable qualitative and quantitative microscopic explanation of spectral,
concentration, temperature, and field dependences of optic and magneto-optic
properties ranging from the isotropic absorption as well as the optic
anisotropy to the circular magneto-optics. In this review paper, starting with
a critical analysis of the fundamental shortcomings of the "first-principles"
DFT-based band theory we present the main ideas and techniques of the cluster
theory of the CT transitions to be main contributors to circular magneto-optics
of ferrites.

<p>The interaction of excitonic transitions with confined photonic modes enables
tests of quantum physics and design of efficient optoelectronic devices. Here
we study how key metrics such as Purcell factor, beta-factor and collection
efficiency are determined by the non-cavity modes which exist in real devices,
taking the well-studied micropillar cavity as an example. Samples with dots at
different positions in the cavity field allow us to quantify the effect of the
non-cavity modes and show that the zero-phonon line and the phonon-assisted
emission into the cavity mode HE11 is suppressed by positioning dots at the
field node.

<i>M. Ibarra-Meneses, A. Martín-Ruiz</i>
<p>The topological magnetoelectric effect (TME) is a unique macroscopic
manifestation of quantum states of matter possessing topological order and it
is described by axion electrodynamics. In three-dimensional topological
insulators, for instance, the axion coupling is of the order of the fine
structure constant, and hence a perturbative analysis of the field equations is
plenty justified. In this paper we use Green's function techniques to obtain
time-dependent solutions to the axion field equations in the presence of a
planar domain-wall separating two media with different topological order. We
apply our results to investigate the radiation of a short linear antenna near
the domain-wall.

<h3>Higher-order Laplacian Renormalization</h3>

<br>
<i>Marco Nurisso, Marta Morandini, Maxime Lucas, Francesco Vaccarino, Tommaso Gili, Giovanni Petri</i>
<p>We propose a cross-order Laplacian renormalization group (X-LRG) scheme for
arbitrary higher-order networks. The renormalization group is a pillar of the
theory of scaling, scale-invariance, and universality in physics. An RG scheme
based on diffusion dynamics was recently introduced for complex networks with
dyadic interactions. Despite mounting evidence of the importance of polyadic
interactions, we still lack a general RG scheme for higher-order networks. Our
approach uses a diffusion process to group nodes or simplices, where
information can flow between nodes and between simplices (higher-order
interactions). This approach allows us (i) to probe higher-order structures,
defining scale-invariance at various orders, and (ii) to propose a
coarse-graining scheme. We demonstrate our approach on controlled synthetic
higher-order systems and then use it to detect the presence of order-specific
scale-invariant profiles of real-world complex systems from multiple domains.

<h3>Nonequilibrium dynamics of the Hubbard dimer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11301" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11301</a>
<br>
<i>Yaroslav Pavlyukh</i>
<p>Electron dynamics in a two-sites Hubbard model is studied using the
nonequilibrium Green's function approach. The study is motivated by the
empirical observation that a full solution of the integro-differential
Kadanoff-Baym equation (KBE) is more stable and often accompanied by artificial
damping [Marc Puig von Friesen, C. Verdozzi, and C.-O. Almbladh (2009)] than
its time-linear reformulations relying on the generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz
(GKBA). Additionally, for conserving theories, numerical simulations suggest
that KBE produces natural occupations bounded by one and zero in agreement with
the Pauli exclusion principle, whereas, in some regimes, GKBA-based theories
violate this principle. As the first step for understanding these issues, the
electron dynamics arising in the adiabatic switching scenario is studied.
Many-body approximations are classified according to the channel of the
Bethe-Salpeter equation in which electronic correlations are explicitly
treated. They give rise to the so-called second Born, $T$-matrix and $GW$
approximations. In each of these cases, the model is reduced to a system of
ordinary differential equations, which resemble equations of motion for a
driven harmonic oscillator with time-dependent frequencies. A more complete
treatment of electronic correlations is achieved by combining different
correlation channels, with parquet theory serving as a starting point.

<h3>First-Principles Electron-Phonon Interactions and Polarons in the Parent  Cuprate La$_2$CuO$_4$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11322" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11322</a>
<br>
<i>Benjamin K. Chang, Iurii Timrov, Jinsoo Park, Jin-Jian Zhou, Nicola Marzari, Marco Bernardi</i>
<p>Understanding electronic interactions in high-temperature superconductors is
an outstanding challenge. In the widely studied cuprate materials, experimental
evidence points to strong electron-phonon ($e$-ph) coupling and broad
photoemission spectra. Yet, the microscopic origin of this behavior is not
fully understood. Here we study $e$-ph interactions and polarons in a
prototypical parent (undoped) cuprate, La$_2$CuO$_4$ (LCO), by means of
first-principles calculations. Leveraging parameter-free Hubbard-corrected
density functional theory, we obtain a ground state with band gap and Cu
magnetic moment in nearly exact agreement with experiments. This enables a
quantitative characterization of $e$-ph interactions. Our calculations reveal
two classes of longitudinal optical (LO) phonons with strong $e$-ph coupling to
hole states. These modes consist of Cu-O plane bond-stretching and bond-bending
as well as vibrations of apical O atoms. The hole spectral functions, obtained
with a cumulant method that can capture strong $e$-ph coupling, exhibit broad
quasiparticle peaks with a small spectral weight ($Z\approx0.25$) and
pronounced LO-phonon sidebands characteristic of polaron effects. Our
calculations predict features observed in photoemission spectra, including a
40-meV peak in the $e$-ph coupling distribution function not explained by
existing models. These results show that the universal strong $e$-ph coupling
found experimentally in lanthanum cuprates is an intrinsic feature of the
parent compound, and elucidates its microscopic origin.

<i>Rebecca Efrat Hadad, Argha Roy, Eran Rabani, Ronald Redmer, Roi Baer</i>
<p>This study overviews and extends a recently developed stochastic
finite-temperature Kohn-Sham density functional theory to study warm dense
matter using Langevin dynamics, specifically under periodic boundary
conditions. The method's algorithmic complexity exhibits nearly linear scaling
with system size and is inversely proportional to the temperature.
Additionally, a novel linear-scaling stochastic approach is introduced to
assess the Kubo-Greenwood conductivity, demonstrating exceptional stability for
DC conductivity. Utilizing the developed tools, we investigate the equation of
state, radial distribution, and electronic conductivity of Hydrogen at a
temperature of 30,000K. As for the radial distribution functions, we reveal a
transition of Hydrogen from gas-like to liquid-like behavior as its density
exceeds $4 g/cm^3$. As for the electronic conductivity as a function of the
density, we identified a remarkable isosbestic point at frequencies around 7eV,
which may be an additional signature of a gas-liquid transition in Hydrogen at
30,000K.

<h3>Inner Structure of Many-Body Localization Transition and Fulfillment of  Harris Criterion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11339" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11339</a>
<br>
<i>Jie Chen, Chun Chen, Xiaoqun Wang</i>
<p>We treat disordered Heisenberg model in 1D as the "standard model" of
many-body localization (MBL). Two independent order parameters stemming purely
from the half-chain von Neumann entanglement entropy $S_{\textrm{vN}}$ are
introduced to probe its eigenstate transition. From symmetry-endowed entropy
decomposition, they are probability distribution deviation $|d(p_n)|$ and von
Neumann entropy $S_{\textrm{vN}}^{n}(D_n\!=\!\mbox{max})$ of the
maximum-dimensional symmetry subdivision. Finite-size analyses reveal that
$\{p_n\}$ drives the localization transition, preceded by a thermalization
breakdown transition governed by $\{S_{\textrm{vN}}^{n}\}$. For noninteracting
case, these transitions coincide, but in interacting situation they separate.
Such separability creates an intermediate phase region and may help
discriminate between the Anderson and MBL transitions. An obstacle whose
solution eludes community to date is the violation of Harris criterion in
nearly all numeric investigations of MBL so far. Upon elucidating the mutually
independent components in $S_{\textrm{vN}}$, it is clear that previous studies
of eigenspectra, $S_{\textrm{vN}}$, and the like lack resolution to pinpoint
(thus completely overlook) the crucial internal structures of the transition.
We show, for the first time, that after this necessary decoupling, the
universal critical exponents for both transitions of $|d(p_n)|$ and
$S_{\textrm{vN}}^{n}(D_n\!=\!\mbox{max})$ fulfill the Harris criterion:
$\nu\approx2.0\ (\nu\approx1.5)$ for quench (quasirandom) disorder. Our work
puts forth "symmetry combined with entanglement" as the missing organization
principle for the generic eigenstate matter and transition.

<p>This is the text of my report presented at the 29th Solvay Conference on

the high-dimensional regime $N\gg 1$. Using as a reference point a 1986 paper
by Fu and Anderson, I take stock of the progress on this question over the last
40 years. In particular, I focus on the influence and ramifications of ideas
originating from statistical physics. My own conclusion is that several of the
most fundamental questions in this area (which in 1986 were barely formulated)
have now received mathematically rigorous answers, at least in simple -- yet
highly nontrivial -- settings. Instrumental to this spectacular progress was
the dialogue between different research communities: physics, computer science,

<p>In this study, ultrafast optical spectroscopy was employed to elucidate the
intricate topological features of EuIn$_2$As$_2$, a promising candidate for a
magnetic topological-crystalline axion insulator. Our investigation, focusing
on the real-time evolution of topological states, unveiled a narrow surface
magnetic gap (2$\Delta_0$ $\simeq$ 8.2 meV)) emerging at the antiferromagnetic
transition temperature ($T_N$ $\approx$ 16 K). Below $T_N$, two extremely
low-energy collective modes, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, with frequencies of
$\sim$9.9 and 21.6 GHz at $T$ = 4 K, respectively, were observed, exhibiting
strong temperature dependence. $\omega_1$ correlates with an acoustic phonon,
while $\omega_2$ is associated with a magnon. The results suggest that
EuIn$_2$As$_2$ has the potential to manifest a magnetic topological-crystalline
axion insulator, presenting a small magnetic energy gap on the (001) surface.
The findings further our understanding of the interplay between magnetism and
topology in this material, showcasing its potential for applications in quantum

<p>First-principles calculations of electron interactions in materials have seen
rapid progress in recent years, with electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions being
a prime example. However, these techniques use large matrices encoding the
interactions on dense momentum grids, which reduces computational efficiency
and obscures interpretability. For e-ph interactions, existing interpolation
techniques leverage locality in real space, but the high dimensionality of the
data remains a bottleneck to balance cost and accuracy. Here we show an
efficient way to compress e-ph interactions based on singular value
decomposition (SVD), a widely used matrix / image compression technique.
Leveraging (un)constrained SVD methods, we accurately predict material
properties related to e-ph interactions - including charge mobility, spin
relaxation times, band renormalization, and superconducting critical
temperature - while using only a small fraction (1-2%) of the interaction data.
These findings unveil the hidden low-dimensional nature of e-ph interactions.
Furthermore, they accelerate state-of-the-art first-principles e-ph
calculations by about two orders of magnitudes without sacrificing accuracy.
Our Pareto-optimal parametrization of e-ph interactions can be readily
generalized to electron-electron and electron-defect interactions, as well as
to other couplings, advancing quantitative studies of condensed matter.

<p>Despite several decades of active experimental and theoretical studies of
rare-earth orthoferrites, the mechanism of the formation of specific magnetic,
magnetoelastic, optical, and magneto-optical properties remains a subject of
discussion. This paper provides an overview of simple theoretical model
approaches to quantitatively describing the structure-property relationships,
in particular, interplay between FeO$_6$ octahedral deformations/rotations and
main magnetic and optic characteristics such as N\'{e}el temperature, overt and
hidden canting of magnetic sublattices, magnetic and magnetoelastic anisotropy,

<h3>Correcting force error-induced underestimation of lattice thermal  conductivity in machine learning molecular dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11427" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11427</a>

<p>Machine learned potentials (MLPs) have been widely employed in molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations to study thermal transport. However, literature
results indicate that MLPs generally underestimate the lattice thermal
conductivity (LTC) of typical solids. Here, we quantitatively analyze this
underestimation in the context of the neuroevolution potential (NEP), which is
a representative MLP that balances efficiency and accuracy. Taking crystalline
silicon, GaAs, graphene, and PbTe as examples, we reveal that the fitting
errors in the machine-learned forces against the reference ones are responsible
for the underestimated LTC as they constitute external perturbations to the
interatomic forces. Since the force errors of a NEP model and the random forces
in the Langevin thermostat both follow a Gaussian distribution, we propose an
approach to correcting the LTC by intentionally introducing different levels of
force noises via the Langevin thermostat and then extrapolating to the limit of
zero force error. Excellent agreement with experiments is obtained by using
this correction for all the prototypical materials over a wide range of
temperatures. Based on spectral analyses, we find that the LTC underestimation
mainly arises from increased phonon scatterings in the low-frequency region
caused by the random force errors.

<h3>Nonlocal Andreev transport through a quantum dot in a magnetic field:  Interplay between Kondo, Zeeman, and Cooper-pair correlations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11434" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11434</a>
<br>
<i>Masashi Hashimoto, Yasuhiro Yamada, Yoichi Tanaka, Yoshimichi Teratani, Takuro Kemi, Norio Kawakami, Akira Oguri</i>
<p>We study the nonlocal magnetotransport through a strongly correlated quantum
dot, connected to multiple terminals consisting of two normal and one
superconducting (SC) leads. Specifically, we present a comprehensive view on
the interplay between the crossed Andreev reflection (CAR), the Kondo effect,
and the Zeeman splitting at zero temperature in the large SC gap limit. The
ground state of this network shows an interesting variety, which varies
continuously with the system parameters, such as the coupling strength
$\Gamma_S^{}$ between the SC lead and the quantum dot, the Coulomb repulsion
$U$, the impurity level $\varepsilon_d^{}$, and the magnetic field $b$. We
show, using the many-body optical theorem which is derived from the
Fermi-liquid theory, that the nonlocal conductance is determined by the
transmission rate of the Cooper pairs $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{CP}}^{} =
\frac{1}{4} \sin^2 \Theta\, \sin^2 \bigl(\delta_{\uparrow}+
\delta_{\downarrow})$ and that of the Bogoliubov particles
$\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{BG}}^{}= \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\sigma} \sin^2
\delta_{\sigma}^{}$. Here, $\delta_\sigma^{}$ is the phase shift of the
renormalized Bogoliubov particles, and $\Theta \equiv \cot^{-1} (\xi_d^{}/
\Gamma_S^{})$ is the Bogoliubov-rotation angle in the Nambu pseudo spin space,
with $\xi_d^{} =\varepsilon_d^{}+U/2$. It is also demonstrated, using Wilson's
numerical renormalization group approach, that the CAR is enhanced in the
crossover region between the Kondo regime and the SC-proximity-dominated regime
at zero magnetic field. The magnetic fields induce another crossover between
the Zeeman-dominated regime and the SC-dominated regime. We find that the CAR
is enhanced and becomes less sensitive to magnetic fields in the SC-dominated
regime close to the crossover region spreading over the angular range of $\pi/4
\lesssim \Theta \lesssim 3\pi/4$.

<h3>Kondo Screening of Local Moments in a Triangular Triple Quantum Dot  Connected to Normal and Superconducting Leads</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11444" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11444</a>
<br>
<i>Masashi Hashimoto, Yoshimichi Teratani, Masaya Shirotani, Yukihiro Nakata, Masashi Shimamoto, Yoichi Tanaka, Yasuhiro Yamada, Akira Oguri</i>
<p>We study the interplay between the Kondo and superconducting (SC) proximity
effects, taking place in a triangular triple quantum dot (TTQD) connected to
one normal and two SC leads. This system shows various quantum phases. Without
the SC leads, the lowest two states that belong to the different spin sectors,
$S=0$ and $S=1/2$, become energetically very close to each other near half
filling. The singlet one is a Kondo-screened state by conduction electrons from
the normal lead, and the doublet one is a resonating valence bond state with
unpaired free spin which remains unscreened. Furthermore, when one additional
electron enters the TTQD, the ground state becomes a doublet in which the $S=1$
local moment due to the Nagaoka ferromagnetism is partially screened by
conduction electrons.The Cooper pairs penetrating into the TTQD from the SC
leads reconstruct the wavefunctions and vary the phase boundaries between these
quantum states in the parameter space. We calculate ground-state phase diagrams
using the numerical renormalization group, and show that the SC proximity
effect induces a reentrant transition in-between the three- and four-electron
fillings.

<h3>Hydrostatic pressure effect on structural and transport properties of  co-existing layered and disordered rock-salt phase of LixCoO2</h3>

<i>Thiagarajan Maran, A. Jain, Muthukumaran Sundaramoorthy, A. P. Roy, Boby Joseph, Govindaraj Lingannan, Ashwin Mohan, D. Bansal, S. M. Yusuf, Arumugam Sonachalam</i>
<p>It is widely believed that the origin of a significant cause for the voltage
and capacity fading observed in lithium (Li)-ion batteries is related to
structural modifications occurring in the cathode material during the Li-ion
insertion/de-insertion process. The Li-ion insertion/de-insertion mechanism and
the resulting structural changes are known to exert a severe strain on the
lattice, and consequently leading to performance degradation. Here, with a view
to shed more light on the effect of such strain on the structural properties of
the cathode material, we have systematically investigated the pressure
dependence of structural and transport properties of an LixCoO2 single crystal,
grown using 5% excess Li in the precursors. Ambient pressure synchrotron
diffraction on these crystals reveals that, the excess Li during the growth,
has facilitated the stabilization of a layered rhombohedral phase (space group
R3m) as well as a disordered rock-salt phase (space group Fm3m). The volume
fraction of the rhombohedral and cubic phase is 60:40, respectively, which
remains unchanged up to 10.6 GPa. No structural phase transition has been
observed up to 10.6 GPa. An increase in resistance with a decrease in
temperature has revealed the semi-metallic nature of the sample. Further, the
application of hydrostatic pressure up to 2.8 GPa shows the enhancement of
semi-metallic nature. The obtained experimental results can be qualitatively
explained via density functional theory (DFT) and thermodynamics modelling. The
calculated density of states was reduced, and the activation energy was
increased by applied pressure. Our investigations indicate a significant phase
stability of the mixed phase crystals under externally applied high pressure
and thus suggest the possible use of such mixed phase materials as a cathode in
lithium-ion batteries.

<p>The manuscript theoretically discusses various important aspects for donor
atom based single qubit operations in silicon (Si) quantum computer
architecture at room temperature using a single nitrogen (N) deep-donor close
to the Si/SiO2 interface. Quantitative investigation of room temperature single
electron shuttling between a single N-donor atom and the interface is the focus
of attention under the influence of externally applied electric and magnetic
field. To apprehend the realistic experimental configurations, central cell
correction along with effective mass approach is adopted throughout the study.
Furthermore, a detailed discussion currently explores the significant time
scales implicated in the process and their suitability for experimental
purposes. Theoretical estimates are also provided for all the external fields
required to successfully achieve coherent single electron shuttling and their
stable maintenance at the interface as required. The results presented in this

<h3>Fractal Surface States in Three-Dimensional Topological Quasicrystals</h3>

<br>
<i>Zhu-Guang Chen, Cunzhong Lou, Kaige Hu, Lih-King Lim</i>
<p>We study topological states of matter in quasicrystals, which do not rely on
crystalline orders. In the absence of a bandstructure description and
spin-orbit coupling, we show that a three-dimensional quasicrystal can
nevertheless form a topological insulator. It relies on a combination of
noncrystallographic rotational symmetry of quasicrystals and electronic orbital
space symmetry, which is the quasicrystalline counterpart of topological
crystalline insulator. The resulting topological state obeys a non-trivial
twisted bulk-boundary correspondence and lacks a good metallic surface. The
topological surface states, localized on the top and bottom planes respecting
the quasicrystalline symmetry, exhibit a new kind of multifractality with
probability density concentrates mostly on high symmetry patches. They form a
near-degenerate manifold of 'immobile' states whose number scales
proportionally with the macroscopic sample size. This can open the door to a
novel platform for topological surface physics distinct from the crystalline
counterpart.

<h3>Tunable thermal conductivity of sustainable geopolymers by Si/Al ratio  and moisture content: insights from atomistic simulations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11522" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11522</a>
<br>
<i>Wenkai Liu, Shenghong Ju</i>
<p>In this work, the effects of Si/Al ratio and moisture content on thermal
transport in sustainable geopolymers has been comprehensively investigated by
using the molecular dynamics simulation. The thermal conductivity of geopolymer
systems increases with the increase of Si/Al ratio, and the phonon vibration
frequency region which plays a major role in the main increase of its thermal
conductivity is 8-25 THz, while the rest of the frequency interval contribute
less. With the increase of moisture content, the thermal conductivity of
geopolymer systems decreases at first, then increases and finally tends to be
stable, which is contrary to the changing trend of porosity of the system. This
is mainly because the existence of pores will lead to phonon scattering during
thermal transport, which in turn affects the thermal conductivity of the
system. When the moisture content is 5%, the thermal conductivity reaches a
minimum value of about 1.103 W/(mK), which is 40.2% lower than the thermal
conductivity of the system without water molecule. This work will help to
enhance the physical level understanding of the relationship between the
geopolymer structures and thermal transport properties.

<h3>Solvable Two-dimensional Dirac Equation with Matrix Potential: Graphene  in External Electromagnetic Field</h3>

<br>
<i>Mikhail V. Ioffe, David N. Nishnianidze</i>
<p>It is known that the excitations in graphene-like materials in external
electromagnetic field are described by solutions of massless two-dimensional
Dirac equation which includes both Hermitian off-diagonal matrix and scalar
potentials. Up to now, such two-component wave functions were calculated for
different forms of external potentials but, as a rule, depending on one spatial
variable only. Here, we shall find analytically the solutions for a wide class
of combinations of matrix and scalar external potentials which physically
correspond to applied mutually orthogonal magnetic and longitudinal
electrostatic fields, both depending really on two spatial variables. The main
tool for this progress was provided by supersymmetrical (SUSY) intertwining
relations, namely, by their most general - asymmetrical - form proposed
recently by the authors. Such SUSY-like method is applied in two steps
similarly to the second order factorizable (reducible) SUSY transformations in
ordinary Quantum Mechanics.

<br>
<i>Jean-Yves P. Fortin</i>
<p>We consider the dynamics of classical particles or defects moving in a
fluctuating two-dimensional magnetic medium made of Ising spins. These defects
occupy empty sites, and each of them can move according to simple rules, by
exchanging its location with one of the neighboring or distant spin if the
energy is favorable, conserving the magnetization. We use a fermionic
representation of the theory in order to map the partition function into an
integral over Grassmannian variables. This model of annealed disorder can be
described by a Grassmannian action containing quartic interaction terms. We
study the critical behavior of this system as well as the entropy, specific
heat, and residual correlation functions which are evaluated within this
Grassmannian formalism. We found in particular that the correlations are
strongly attractive at short distances in the low temperature regime and for a
broader range of distances near the spin critical regime, and slightly
repulsive at large distances. These results are compared with Monte-Carlo
simulations.

<h3>Ti substitution on Fe sites significantly changes the electronic  properties of orthorhombic LaFeO3 perovskites (A first-principles study)</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11530" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11530</a>
<br>
<i>Jesaya Situmeang, Djoko Triyono, Muhammad Aziz Majidi</i>
<p>A large number of published experimental works suggest that when the Fe ions
in orthorhombic LaFeO3 are substituted, band gap reduction is expected.
However, recent experimental works observe band gap enhancement with increasing
Ti ions replacing Fe ions. While satisfactory explanation on such observations
seem absent, a first principles investigation may answer what should really
happen. We investigate from first-principles the influence of Ti substitution
on LaFeO3 at Fe-site as a function of substitution concentration. Amongst the
five investigated models, we found that as the Ti substitution concentration
increases, the electronic band gap at Fermi level decreases. However, in the
model where two Ti ions replace Fe sites in an anti-symmetric arrangement, the
Fermi level is crossed. We found that band gap reductions could be caused by
the decreased in field splitting between the Fe 3d orbitals and charge
competition between Fe-O and Ti-O bonds as inferred from density of states
analysis. While band gap reduction with increasing substitution implies better
conductivity, cohesive energy becomes less negative although the perovskite
distortion parameter does not differ significantly between each models.

<h3>Random matrix model of Kolmogorov-Zakharov turbulence</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11545" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11545</a>
<br>
<i>Klaus M.Frahm, Dima L. Shepelyansky</i>
<p>We introduce and study a random matrix model of Kolmogorov-Zakharov
turbulence in a nonlinear purely dynamical finite size system with many degrees
of freedom. For the case of a direct cascade the energy and norm pumping takes
place at low energy scales with absorption at high energies. For a pumping
strength above a certain chaos border a global chaotic attractor appears with a
stationary energy flow through a Hamiltonian inertial energy interval. In this
regime, the steady-state norm distribution is described by an algebraic decay
with an exponent in agreement with the Kolmogorov-Zakharov theory. Below the
chaos border the system is located in the quasi-integrable regime similar to
the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theory and the turbulence is suppressed. For the
inverse cascade the system rapidly enters a strongly nonlinear regime where the
weak turbulence description is invalid. We argue that such a dynamical
turbulence is generic showing that it is present in other lattice models with
disorder and Anderson localization. We point out that such dynamical models can
be realized in multimode optical fibers.

<p>Inspired by the narrow Feshbach resonance in systems with the two-body

the three-body interaction that takes into account the finite-range effects in
low dimensions. Within this model, the $p$-wave Efimov-like effect in the
four-body sector is predicted in fractional dimensions above 1D. The impact of
the finite-range interaction on the formation of the four-body bound states in
$d=1$ is also discussed in detail.

<h3>On non-stability of one-dimensional non-periodic ground states</h3>

<br>
<i>Damian Głodkowski, Jacek Miȩkisz</i>
<p>We address the problem of stability of one-dimensional non-periodic
ground-state configurations with respect to finite-range perturbations of
interactions in classical lattice-gas models. We show that a relevant property
of non-periodic ground-state configurations in this context is their
homogeneity. The so-called strict boundary condition says that the number of
finite patterns of a configuration have bounded fluctuations on any finite
subsets of the lattice. We show that if the strict boundary condition is not
satisfied, then in order for non-periodic ground-state configurations to be
stable, interactions between particles should not decay faster than
$1/r^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha>2$. In the Thue-Morse ground state, number of
finite patterns may fluctuate as much as the logarithm of the lenght of a
lattice subset. We show that the Thue-Morse ground state is unstable for any
$\alpha >1$ with respect to arbitrarily small two-body interactions favoring
the presence of molecules consisting of two spins up or down. We also
investigate Sturmian systems defined by irrational rotations on the circle.
They satisfy the strict boundary condition but nevertheless they are unstable
for $\alpha>3$.

<p>Binary kagome compounds TmXn (T = Mn, Fe, Co; X = Sn, Ge; m:n = 3:1, 3:2,
1:1) have garnered recent interest owing to the presence of both topological
band crossings and flat bands arising from the geometry of the metal-site
kagome lattice. To exploit these electronic features for potential applications
in spintronics, the growth of high quality heterostructures is required. Here
we report the synthesis of Fe/FeSn and Co/FeSn bilayers on Al2O3 substrates
using molecular beam epitaxy to realize heterointerfaces between elemental
ferromagnetic metals and antiferromagnetic kagome metals. Structural
characterization using high-resolution X-ray diffraction, reflection
high-energy electron diffraction, and electron microscopy reveals the FeSn
films are flat and epitaxial. Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy was used
to confirm the stoichiometric window where the FeSn phase is stabilized, while
transport and magnetometry measurements were conducted to verify metallicity
and magnetic ordering in the films. Exchange bias was observed, confirming the
presence of antiferromagnetic order in the FeSn layers, paving the way for
future studies of magnetism in kagome heterostructures and potential
integration of these materials into devices.

<p>We investigate the single-particle spectra of recently discovered kagome
superconductors. We examine nine distinct superconducting pairing symmetries,
including the uniform $s$-wave pairing function, nearest-neighbor and
next-nearest-neighbor $s$-wave pairing, $p+ip$ pairing, $d+id$ pairing, and
$f$-wave pairing states. These pairing states can be classified into
irreducible representations of the $C_{6v}$ point group. Our findings suggest
that these pairing states can be differentiated by analyzing the energy bands,
spectral function, and local density of states. Additionally, we explore the
single impurity effect, which could potentially assist in further
distinguishing these pairing symmetries.

<h3>Quantitative measurement of figure of merit for transverse  thermoelectric conversion in Fe/Pt metallic multilayers</h3>

<i>Takumi Yamazaki, Takamasa Hirai, Takashi Yagi, Yuichiro Yamashita, Ken-ichi Uchida, Takeshi Seki, Koki Takanashi</i>
<p>This study presents a measurement method for determining the figure of merit
for transverse thermoelectric conversion ($ z_\mathrm{T}T $) in thin film
forms. Leveraging the proposed methodology, we comprehensively investigate the
transverse thermoelectric coefficient ($ S_\mathrm{T} $), in-plane electrical
conductivity ($ \sigma_{yy} $), and out-of-plane thermal conductivity ($
\kappa_{xx} $) in epitaxial and polycrystalline Fe/Pt metallic multilayers. The
$ \kappa_{xx} $ values of multilayers with a number of stacking repetitions ($
N $) of 200 are lower than those of FePt alloy films, indicating that the
multilayer structure effectively contributes to the suppression of $
\kappa_{xx} $. $ z_\mathrm{T}T $ is found to increase with increasing $ N $,
which remarkably reflects the $ N $-dependent enhancement of the $ S_\mathrm{T}
$ values. Notably, $ S_\mathrm{T} $ and $ \sigma_{yy} $ are significantly
larger in the epitaxial multilayers than those in the polycrystalline
counterparts, whereas negligible differences in $ \kappa_{xx} $ are observed
between the epitaxial and polycrystalline multilayers. This discrepancy in $
\sigma_{yy} $ and $ \kappa_{xx} $ with respect to crystal growth is due to the
different degree of anisotropy in electron transport between epitaxial and
polycrystalline multilayers, and epitaxial growth can lead to an enhancement of
$ z_\mathrm{T}T $ in the multilayers. This study is the first demonstration in
the evaluation of $ z_\mathrm{T}T $ in thin film forms, and our proposed
measurement technique reveals the transverse thermoelectric properties inherent
to multilayers.

<h3>Emergent SU(3) topological system in a trimer SSH model</h3>

<br>
<i>Sonu Verma, Tarun Kanti Ghosh</i>
<p>We consider a trimer Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) tight-binding Hamiltonian
keeping up to next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping terms and on-site potential
energy. The Bloch Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of all the eight
generators (i.e. Gell-Mann matrices) of the SU(3) group. We provide exact
analytical expressions of three dispersive energy bands and the corresponding
eigenstates for any choices of the system parameters. The system lacks full
chiral symmetry since the energy spectrum is not symmetric around zero, except
at isolated Bloch wavevectors. We explore parity, time reversal, and certain
special chiral symmetries for various system parameters. We discuss the
bulk-boundary correspondence by numerically computing the Zak phase for all the
bands and the boundary modes in the open boundary condition. There are three
different kinds of topological phase transitions which are classified based on
the gap closing points in the Brillouin zone (BZ) while tuning the
nearest-neighbor (NN) and NNN hopping terms. We find that quantized changes (in
units of $\pi$) in two out of three Zak phases characterize these topological
phase transitions. We propose another bulk topological invariant, namely the
$\textit{sub-lattice winding number}$, which also characterizes the topological
phase transitions changing from $ \nu^{\alpha} = 0 \leftrightarrow 2 $ and $
\nu^{\alpha} = 0 \leftrightarrow 1 \leftrightarrow 2 $ ($\alpha $: sub-lattice
index). The sub-lattice winding number provides a relatively simple analytical
understanding of topological phases and may help in characterizing topological
phases of systems without chiral symmetry.

<br>
<i>Sheng Bi, Christian Carbogno, Igor Ying Zhang, Matthias Scheffler</i>
<p>Semilocal density-functional approximations (DFAs), including the
state-of-the-art SCAN functional, are plagued by the self-interaction error
(SIE). While this error is explicitly defined only for one-electron systems, it
has inspired the self-interaction correction method proposed by Perdew and
Zunger (PZ-SIC), which has shown promise in mitigating the many-electron SIE.
However, the PZ-SIC method is known for its significant numerical instability.
In this study, we introduce a novel constraint that facilitates self-consistent
localization of the SIC orbitals in the spirit of Edmiston-Ruedenberg orbitals
[Rev. Mod. Phys. 35, 457 (1963)]. Our practical implementation within the
all-electron numeric atom-centered orbitals code FHI-aims guarantees efficient
and stable convergence of the self-consistent PZ-SIC equations for both
molecules and solids. We further demonstrate that our PZ-SIC approach
effectively mitigates the SIE in the meta-GGA SCAN functional, significantly
improving the accuracy for ionization potentials, charge-transfer energies, and
band gaps for a diverse selection of molecules and solids. However, our PZ-SIC
method does have its limitations. It can not improve the already accurate SCAN
results for properties such as cohesive energies, lattice constants, and bulk
modulus in our test sets. This highlights the need for new-generation DFAs with
more comprehensive applicability.

<i>Lei Su, Meng Zeng</i>
<p>Gauging a finite subgroup of a global symmetry can map conventional phases
and phase transitions to unconventional ones. In this work, we study, as a
concrete example, an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauged system with global symmetry
$U(1)$, namely, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauged Bose-Hubbard model both in 1-D and in
2-D. In certain limits, there is an emergent mixed 't Hooft anomaly between the
quotient $\tilde{U}(1)$ symmetry and the dual $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}_2$ symmetry. In
1-D, the superfluid phase is mapped to an intrinsically gapless
symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase, as supported by density-matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) calculations. In 2-D, the original
superfluid-insulator transition becomes a generalized deconfined quantum
critical point (DQCP) between a gapless SPT phase, where a SPT order coexists
with Goldstone modes, and a $\tilde{U}(1)$-symmetry-enriched topological (SET)
phase. We also discuss the stability of these phases and the critical points to
small perturbations and their potential experimental realizations. Our work
demonstrates that partial gauging is a simple and yet powerful approach in
constructing novel phases and quantum criticalities.

<p>Spatial ordering of matter elicits exotic properties sometimes absent from a
material's constituents. A few highly mineralised natural materials achieve
high toughness through delocalised damage, whereas synthetic particulate
composites must trade toughness for mineral content. We test whether ordering
the mineral phase in particulate composites through the formation of
macroscopic colloidal crystals can trigger the same damage resistance found in
natural materials. Our macroscopic silica rod based anisotropic colloidal
crystal composites are processed fully at room temperature and pressure, reach
volume fraction of mineral higher than 80%, and aided by a ductile interface,
unveil plastic strain reaching 10% through the collective movement of rods and
damage delocalisation over millimetres. These composites demonstrate key design
rules to break free from conventionally accepted structural materials
properties trade-off.

<p>Cobalt is used in Li-ion batteries, but it is expensive and could be replaced
by nickel to deliver better performance at a lower cost. With this motivation,
we discuss how the character of redox orbitals of LiNiO$_2$ can be ascertained
through x-ray Compton scattering measurements combined with parallel
first-principles simulations. Our analysis reveals the nature of hole states in
Li-doped NiO resulting from the hybridization of O 2$p$ and Ni 3$d$ orbitals.
Our study also gives insight into the ferromagnetic ground state and provides a
pathway toward the rational design of next-generation battery materials.

<i>Anusuya Pal, Amalesh Gope</i>
<p>Sessile drying droplets manifest distinct morphological patterns,
encompassing diverse systems viz., DNA, proteins, blood, and protein-liquid
crystal (LC) complexes. This study employs an integrated methodology that
combines drying droplet, image texture analysis (features from First Order
Statistics, Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix, Gray Level Run Length Matrix, Gray
Level Size Zone Matrix, and Gray Level Dependence Matrix), and statistical data
analysis (Generalized Additive Modeling and K-means clustering). It provides a
comprehensive qualitative and quantitative exploration by examining LC-protein
droplets at varying initial phosphate buffered concentrations (0x, 0.25x, 0.5x,
0.75x, and 1x) during the drying process under optical microscopy with crossed
polarizing configuration. Notably, it unveils distinct LC-protein textures
across three drying stages: initial, middle, and final. The Generalized
Additive Modeling (GAM) reveals that all the features significantly contribute
to differentiating LC-protein droplets. Integrating the K-means clustering
method with GAM analysis elucidates how textures evolve through the three
drying stages compared to the entire drying process. Notably, the final drying
stage stands out with well-defined, non-overlapping clusters, supporting the
visual observations of unique LC textures. Furthermore, this paper contributes
valuable insights, showcasing the efficacy of drying droplets as a rapid and
straightforward tool for characterizing and classifying dynamic LC textures.

<p>The antiferromagnetic kagome lattice compound FeGe has been revealed to host
an emergent charge-density-wave (CDW) state which manifests complex interplay
between the spin, charge and lattice degrees of freedom. Here, we present a
comprehensive study of the de Haas-van Alphen effect by measuring torque
magnetometry under magnetic fields up to 45.2 T to map Fermi surfaces in this
unusual CDW state. For field along the $c$ direction, we resolve four cyclotron
orbits; the largest one roughly corresponding to the area of the 2$\times$2
folded Brillouin zone. Three smaller orbits are characterized by light
effective cyclotron masses range from (0.18-0.30) $m_e$. Angle-resolved
measurements identify one Fermi surface segment with weak anisotropy. Combined
with band structure calculations, our results suggest that features of unfolded
Fermi surfaces are robust against CDW reconstruction, corroborating the novel
effect of a short-ranged CDW on the electronic structure.

<h3>Yielding is an absorbing phase transition with vanishing critical  fluctuations</h3>

<br>
<i>Tristan Jocteur, Shana Figueiredo, Kirsten Martens, Eric Bertin, Romain Mari</i>
<p>The yielding transition in athermal complex fluids can be interpreted as an
absorbing phase transition between an elastic, absorbing state with high
mesoscopic degeneracy and a flowing, active state. We characterize
quantitatively this phase transition in an elastoplastic model under fixed
applied shear stress, using a finite-size scaling analysis. We find vanishing
critical fluctuations of the order parameter (i.e., the shear rate), and relate
this property to the convex character of the phase transition ($\beta >1$). We
show explicitly that the CDP class is recovered when both properties are
relaxed. We locate yielding within a family of models akin to fixed-energy
sandpile (FES) models, only with long-range redistribution kernels with
zero-modes that result from mechanical equilibrium. For redistribution kernels
with sufficiently fast decay, this family of models belong to a short-range
universality class distinct from the Conserved Directed Percolation class of
usual FES, which is induced by zero modes.

<p>The Bose polaron is a quasiparticle that arises from the interaction between
impurities and Bogoliubov excitation in Bose-Einstein condensates, analogous to
the polaron formed by electrons and phonons in solid-state physics. In this
paper, we investigate the effect of phase separation on weakly coupled and
strongly coupled Bose polarons. Our findings reveal that phase separation
induces a remarkable alteration in the properties of weakly coupled Bose
polarons. However, in the case of strong coupling, phase separation cannot
destroy the polaron as a highly self-trapping state comes into existence.

<h3>The Collective Snapping of a Pair of Bumping Buckled Beams</h3>

<br>
<i>Lennard J. Kwakernaak, Arman Guerra, Douglas P. Holmes, Martin van Hecke</i>
<p>When a pair of parallel buckling beams of unequal width make lateral contact
under increasing compression, eventually either the thin or the thick beam will
snap, leading to collective motion of the beam pair. Using experiments and FEM
simulations, we find that the distance $D$ between the beams selects which beam
snaps first, and that the critical distance $D^*$ scales linear with the
combined width of the two beams. To understand this behavior, we show that the
collective motion of the beams is governed by a pitchfork bifurcation that
occurs at strains just below snapping. Specifically, we use a model of two
coupled Bellini trusses to find a closed form expression for the location of
this pitchfork bifurcation that captures the linear scaling of $D^*$ with beam
width. Our work uncovers a novel elastic instability that combines buckling,
snapping and contact nonlinearities. This instability underlies the packing of
parallel confined beams, and can be leveraged in advanced metamaterials.

<p>While graphene oxide (GO) is representative of a disordered phase of
oxocarbons with lackluster electronic properties, the coexistence of ordered,
stoichiometric solid-state carbon oxides with graphene brings renewed momentum
to the exploration of two-dimensional crystalline oxocarbons. This enduring
subject, spanning decades, has recently witnessed significant advancements. In
this context, our study delves into a novel material class, COF-66, notable for
its meticulously ordered two-dimensional crystalline structure and intrinsic
porosity. Employing a global optimization algorithm alongside
density-functional calculations, our investigation highlights a standout member
within the COF-66 family exceptional quasi-flat oxocarbon (C6O6)exhibiting an
unconventional oxygen-decorated pore configuration. This pioneering study
introduces C6O6 as an innovative entrant into the crystalline carbon oxide
arena, augmenting the established understanding alongside the well-recognized
graphene oxide and two graphene monoxide, i.e. {\alpha}-GMO and \b{eta}-GMO.
Expanding the exploration, the COF-66 series encompasses 2D-porous carbon
nitride (C6N6) and the recently synthesized 2D-porous boroxine (B6O6), adhering
to a generalized stoichiometry of X6Y6, where X = B, C, and Y = B, N, O, with X
6= Y. Remarkably, the entire COF-66 ensemble adopts a 2D-crystalline framework,
with the exception of C6B6, which assumes a distinct 3D-crystalline
arrangement. Employing the PBE (HSE06) level of theory, our electronic
structure calculations yield band gap values of 0.01 (0.05) eV, 3.68 (5.29) eV,
0.00 (0.23) eV, and 1.53 (3.09) eV for B6N6, B6O6, C6B6, and C6N6,
respectively, reinforcing and aligning with prior investigations.

<h3>Local detailed balance for active particle models</h3>

<br>
<i>Faezeh Khodabandehlou, Christian Maes</i>
<p>Starting from a Huxley-type model for an agitated vibrational mode, we
propose an embedding of standard active particle models in terms of
two-temperature processes. One temperature refers to an ambient thermal bath,
and the other temperature effectively describes ``hot spots,'' i.e., systems
with few degrees of freedom showing important population homogenization or even
inversion of energy levels as a result of activation. That setup admits to
quantitatively specifying the resulting nonequilibrium driving, rendering local
detailed balance to active particle models, and making easy contact with
thermodynamic features. In addition, we observe that the shape transition in
the steady low-temperature behaviour of run-and-tumble particles (with the
interesting emergence of edge states at high persistence) is stable and occurs
for all temperature differences, including close to equilibrium.

<h3>Quantum Hall criticality in an amorphous Chern insulator</h3>

<br>
<i>Soumya Bera, Johannes Dieplinger, Naba P Nayak</i>
<p>We explore the critical properties of a topological transition in a
two-dimensional, amorphous lattice with randomly distributed points. The model
intrinsically breaks the time-reversal symmetry without an external magnetic
field, akin to a Chern insulator. Here, the topological transition is induced
by varying the density of lattice points or adjusting the mass parameter. Using
the two-terminal conductance and multifractality of the wavefunction, we found
that the topological transition belongs to the same universality class as the
integer quantum Hall transition. Regardless of the approach to the critical
point across the phase boundary, the localization length exponent remains
within $\nu \approx 2.55 - 2.61$. The irrelevant scaling exponent for both the
observables is $y \approx 0.3(1)$, comparable to the values obtained using
transfer matrix analysis in the Chalker-Coddigton network. Additionally, the
investigation of the entire distribution function of the inverse participation
ratio at the critical point shows possible deviations from the parabolic
multifractal spectrum at the anomalous quantum Hall transition.

<h3>Vacancy-induced localized modes and impurity band formation in the  Haldane model: a quantum dot analogy</h3>

<br>
<i>Hussein Alshuwaili, Zahra Noorinejad, Mohsen Amini, Morteza Soltani, Ebrahim Ghanbari-Adivi</i>
<p>In this study, the Haldane model's edge states are utilized to illustrate
that a zero-energy localized state forms around a single vacancy in the model.
In order to complete this task, the conventional unit cell associated to the
Haldane hexagonal structure is transferred onto a two-leg ladder in momentum
space, effectively forming an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger~(SSH) lattice
through a one-dimensional Fourier transform. Through the application of a
suitable unitary transformation, the two-leg SSH ladder in momentum space is
converted into an equivalent lattice with two distinct on-site states with
different momentum that are suitable for the calculations. Ultimately, the
desired zero-energy localized mode formed around the vacant-site is represented
by a combination of the armchair edge states. Furthermore, the scenario
involving two vacant sites is investigated and it is revealed that an effective
hopping interaction exists between the localized states formed around the
on-site vacancies created along a zigzag chain in the lattice. This structure
can be likened to the structure of a quantum dot with two none-degenerate
energy levels. Such a hopping interaction is absent for the same vacancies
created on the armchair chains. Finally, it is shown that introducing vacancies
periodically on the sites of a zigzag row along a finite-width ribbon with the
Haldane structure leads to the emergence of an impurity band within the energy
gap.

<p>There is growing interest in strongly correlated insulator thin films because
the intricate interplay of their intrinsic and extrinsic state variables causes
memristive behavior that might be used for bio-mimetic devices in the emerging
field of neuromorphic computing. In this study we find that laser irradiation
tends to drive V$_2$O$_3$ from supercooled/superheated metastable states
towards thermodynamic equilibrium, most likely in a non-thermal way. We study
thin films of the prototypical Mott-insulator V$_2$O$_3$, which show
spontaneous phase separation into metal-insulator herringbone domains during
the Mott transition. Here, we use low-temperature microscopy to investigate how
these metal-insulator domains can be modified by scanning a focused laser beam
across the thin film surface. We find that the response depends on the thermal
history: When the thin film is heated from below the Mott transition
temperature, the laser beam predominantly induces metallic domains. On the
contrary, when the thin film is cooled from a temperature above the transition,
the laser beam predominantly induces insulating domains. Very likely, the
V$_2$O$_3$ thin film is in a superheated or supercooled state, respectively,
during the first-order phase transition, and the perturbation by a laser beam
drives these metastable states into stable ones. This way, the thermal history
is locally erased. Our findings are supported by a phenomenological model with
a laser-induced lowering of the energy barrier between the metastable and
equilibrium states.

<p>Spherosilicate, consisting of a double 4-ring cyclosilicate core (D4R;
Si8O20) with every corner functionalized with a dimethylsilyl chloride group
(-SiMe2Cl), was used as node to construct an iso-reticular series of porous
expanded network materials. Interconnecting the nodes with linear, aliphatic
{\alpha},{\omega}-alkanediol linker molecules yields PolySilicate Porous
Organic Polymers (PSiPOPs), a new type of ordered reticular material related to
the well-known metal-organic and covalent organic frameworks (MOFs & COFs). In
the synthesis, sacrificial hydrogen-bonded Si8O20 cyclosilicate crystals are
first converted into silyl chloride terminated spherosilicate. In a second
step, these nodes are linked up by alkanediol units via the intermediate
formation of a Si-N bond with catalytic amines such as pyridine and
dimethylformamide. Overall, the presented synthesis converts D4R cyclosilicate
into an ordered reticular framework with [Si8O20]-[Si(CH3)2-]8 nodes and
O-(CH2)n-O linkers. Example materials with ethylene glycol, 1,5-pentanediol,
and 1,7-heptanediol as linker (n = 2, 5, and 7) were produced and
characterized. On a macroscopic level, the synthesis yields porous frameworks
exhibiting a thermal stability up to 400{\deg}C and a chemical stability
between pH 1 and 12. N2 physisorption revealed a secondary mesopore structure,
indicating future options to produce hierarchical materials using soft
templates. The molecular level structure of these reticular PSiPOP materials
was elucidated using an NMR crystallography approach implementing a combination
of 1D and 2D 1H and 29Si solid-state MAS NMR spectroscopy experiments.
Previously reported reticular COF/POP materials implementing D4R-based nodes,
used Si8 octakis (phenyl) D4R POSS as a node, connecting it to the linker via a
Si-C bond instead of a Si-O-C linkage.

<h3>Thermodynamic work of partial resetting</h3>

<br>
<i>Kristian Stølevik Olsen, Deepak Gupta</i>
<p>Partial resetting, whereby a state variable $x(t)$ is reset to a value $a x
(t)$, $0\leq a \leq 1$, generalizes conventional resetting by introducing the
resetting strength $a$ as a parameter. Here such resetting processes are
studied from a thermodynamic perspective. The resetting phase of the dynamics
is implemented by a resetting potential $\Phi(x)$ that mediates the resets in
finite time. By working in a ensemble of trajectories with a fixed number of
resets, we study both the steady-state properties of the propagator and its
moments. The thermodynamic work needed to sustain this non-equilibrium steady
state is investigated. We find that different resetting traps can give rise to
mean rate of work that has widely different dependence on the resetting
strength $a$. Surprisingly, in the case of resets mediated by a harmonic trap
with otherwise free diffusive motion, the asymptotic rate of work is
insensitive to the value of $a$. For general anharmonic traps, the asymptotic
rate of work can be both increasing or decreasing as a function of the
strength, depending on the degree of anharmonicity. Counter to intuition, the
rate of work can therefore in some cases increase as the resetting becomes
weaker $(a\to 1)$ although the work vanishes at $a=1$. Work in the presence of
a background potential is also considered. Numerical simulations confirm our
findings.

<p>We discover an instability mechanism in suspensions of self-propelled
particles that does not involve active stress. Instead, it is driven by a
subtle interplay of inertia, swimmer motility, and concentration fluctuations,
through a crucial time lag between the velocity and the concentration field.
The resulting time-persistent state seen in our high-resolution numerical
simulations consists of self-sustained waves of concentration and orientation,
transiting from regular oscillations to wave turbulence. We analyze the
statistical features of this active turbulence, including an intriguing
connection to the Batchelor spectrum of passive scalars.

<i>Paulo J. Paulino, Igor Lesanovsky, Federico Carollo</i>
<p>The state of an open quantum system undergoing an adiabatic process evolves
by following the instantaneous stationary state of its time-dependent
generator. This observation allows one to characterize, for a generic adiabatic
evolution, the average dynamics of the open system. However, information about
fluctuations of dynamical observables, such as the number of photons emitted or
the time-integrated stochastic entropy production in single experimental runs,
requires controlling the whole spectrum of the generator and not only the
stationary state. Here, we show how such information can be obtained in
adiabatic open quantum dynamics by exploiting tools from large deviation
theory. We prove an adiabatic theorem for deformed generators, which allows us
to encode, in a biased quantum state, the full counting statistics of generic
time-integrated dynamical observables. We further compute the probability
associated with an arbitrary "rare" time-history of the observable and derive a
dynamics which realizes it in its typical behavior. Our results provide a way
to characterize and engineer adiabatic open quantum dynamics and to control
their fluctuations.

<p>We report on the coexistence of both normal and topological insulating phases
in InAs/GaSb bilayer quantum well induced by the built-in electric field tuned
optically and electrically. The emergence of topological and normal insulating
phases is assessed based on the evolution of the charge carrier densities, the
resistivity dependence of the gap via in-plane magnetic fields and the thermal
activation of carriers. For the Hall bar device tuned optically, we observe the
fingerprints associated with the presence of only the topological insulating
phase. For another Hall bar processed identically but with an additional top
gate, the coexistence of normal and topological insulating phases is found by
electrical tuning. Our finding paves the way for utilizing a new
electro-optical tuning scheme to manipulate InAs/GaSb bilayer quantum wells to
obtain trivial-topological insulating interfaces in the bulk rather than at the
physical edge of the device.

<p>Microstructure is key to controlling and understanding the properties of
metallic materials, but traditional approaches to describing microstructure
capture only a small number of features. To enable data-centric approaches to
materials discovery, allow efficient storage of microstructural data and assist
in quality control in metals processing, we require more complete descriptors
of microstructure. The concept of microstructural fingerprinting, using machine
learning (ML) to develop quantitative, low-dimensional descriptors of
microstructures, has recently attracted significant attention. However, it is
difficult to interpret conclusions drawn by ML algorithms, which are commonly
referred to as "black boxes".
Here we explore variational autoencoders (VAEs), which can be trained to
produce microstructural fingerprints in a continuous latent space. VAEs enable
the reconstruction of images from fingerprints, allowing us to explore how key
features of microstructure are encoded. We develop a VAE architecture based on
ResNet18 and train it on Ti-6Al-4V optical micrographs as an example of an
industrially important alloy where microstructural control is critical to
performance. The latent space is explored in several ways, including by
supplying interpolated and randomly perturbed fingerprints to the trained
decoder and via dimensionality reduction to explore the distribution of
microstructural features within the latent space of fingerprints. We show that
the VAE fingerprints exhibit smooth, interpolable behaviour with stability to
local perturbations, supporting their suitability as general purpose
descriptors for microstructure. We also show that key properties of the
microstructures are strongly correlated with position in the latent space,
supporting the use of VAE fingerprints for quantitative exploration of
process-structure-property relationships.

<p>The role of defects in two-dimensional semiconductors and how they affect the
intrinsic properties of these materials have been a wide researched topic over
the past decades. Optical characterization such as photoluminescence and Raman
spectroscopies are important tools to probe their physical properties and the
impact of defects. However, conventional optical techniques present a spatial
resolution limitation lying in a $\mu$m-scale, which can be overcomed by the
use of near-field optical measurements. Here, we use tip-enhanced
photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopies to unveil nanoscale optical
heterogeneities at grain boundaries, local strain fields and edges in grown
MoS$_{2}$ monolayers. A noticeable enhancement of the exciton peak intensity
corresponding to a trion emission quenching is observed at narrow regions down
to 47 nm of width at grain boundaries related to doping effects. Besides,
localized strain fields inside the sample lead to non-uniformities in the
intensity and energy position of photoluminescence peaks. Finally, distinct
samples present different nano-optical responses at their edges due to strain
and passivation defects. The passivated defective edges show a
photoluminescence intensity enhancement and energy blueshift as well as a
frequency blueshift of the 2LA Raman mode. On the other hand, the strained
edges display a photoluminescence energy redshift and frequency redshifts for
E$_{2g}$ and 2LA Raman modes. Our work shows that different defect features can
be only probed by using optical spectroscopies with a nanometric resolution,
thus revealing hindered local impact of different nanoscale defects in
two-dimensional materials.

<p>This paper studies the evolution of internal damage in fresh cement mortar
over the 25 hours of hardening. In situ timelapse X-ray computed
micro-tomography ({\mu}XCT) imaging method was used to detect internal damage
and capture its evolution in cement hydration. During {\mu}XCT scans, the
hydration heat was measured, which provided insight for the internal damage
evolution with a link to hydration heat development. The measured hydration
heat was compared with an analytical prediction, which showed a relatively good
agreement with the experimental data. Using 20 CT scans acquired throughout the
observed cement hydration, it was possible to obtain a quantified
characterisation of the porous space. Additionally, the use of timelapse
{\mu}XCT imaging over 25 hours allowed to study the crack growth inside of the
meso-structure including its volume and surface. Observed results provide

<p>Fundamental issues of 1/f noise in quantum nanoscience are reviewed starting
from basic statistical noise processes. Fundamental noise models based on

<p>The extended Third Law for nonequilibrium jump processes is studied in [1,
2], where the nonequilibrium heat capacity and the excess heat with
corresponding quasipotential are introduced. The extended Third Law states that
under two conditions, the nonequlibrium heat capacity vanishes as the
temperature approaches zero. In this paper, we present a concise overview of
key papers addressing the nonequilibrium Nernst postulate (the nonequilibrium
Third Law of thermodynamics) and nonequilibrium calorimetry. The new result
presented in this work include an interpretation of quasipotential in terms of
the mean time taken by the Markov jump process, starting from a given state, to
reach other states for the first time.

<p>There have been some interesting recent advances in understanding the notion
of mechanical disorder in structural glasses and the statistical mechanics of
these systems' low-energy excitations. Here we contribute to these advances by
studying a minimal model for structural glasses' elasticity in which the degree
of mechanical disorder -- as characterized by recently introduced dimensionless
quantifiers -- is readily tunable over a very large range. We comprehensively
investigate a number of scaling laws observed for various macro-, meso- and
microscopic elastic properties, and rationalize them using scaling arguments.
Interestingly, we demonstrate that the model features the universal quartic
glassy vibrational density of states as seen in many atomistic and molecular
models of structural glasses formed by cooling a melt. The emergence of this
universal glassy spectrum highlights the role of self-organization (towards
mechanical equilibrium) in its formation, and elucidates why models featuring
structural frustration alone do not feature the same universal glassy spectrum.
Finally, we discuss relations to existing work in the context of
strain-stiffening of elastic networks and of low-energy excitations in
structural glasses, in addition to future research directions.

<p>Double layer quantum systems are promising platforms for realizing novel
quantum phases. Here, we report a study of quantum oscillations (QOs) in a
weakly coupled double layer system, composed of a large angle twisted double
bilayer graphene (TDBG). We observe two different QOs at low temperature, one
with a periodicity in carrier density (n), i.e. Shubnikov de Haas oscillation
(SdHO) due to Landau quantization, and the other one in displacement field (D),
resulting a grid pattern. We quantify the interlayer coupling strength by
measuring the interlayer capacitance from the grid pattern with a capacitance
model, revealing an electron hole asymmetry. At high temperature when SdHO are
thermal smeared, we observe resistance peaks when LLs from two minivalleys in
the moir\'e Brillion zone are aligned, regardless of carrier density;
eventually, it results in a two fold increase of oscillating frequency in D,
serving as a smoking gun evidence of the magneto intersubband oscillations
(MISO) in a double layer system. The temperature dependence of MISO suggests
electron-electron interaction between two minivalleys play a crucial rule in
the scattering, and the scattering times obtained from MISO thermal damping are
found to be correlated with the interlayer coupling strength. Our study reveals
an intriguing interplay among Landau quantization, moir\'e band structure, and
scatterings.

<i>Xiyin Ye, Ke Xia, Gerrit E. W. Bauer, Tao Yu</i>
<p>The inevitable Gilbert damping in magnetization dynamics is usually regarded
as detrimental to spin transport. Here we demonstrate in a
ferromagnetic-insulator--normal-metal heterostructure that the strong momentum
dependence and chirality of the eddy-current-induced damping causes also
beneficial scattering properties. Here we show that a potential barrier that
reflects magnon wave packets becomes transparent in the presence of a metallic
cap layer, but only in one direction. We formulate the unidirectional
transmission in terms of a generalized group velocity with an imaginary
component and the magnon skin effect. This trick to turn presumably harmful
dissipation into useful functionalities should be useful for future quantum
magnonic devices.

<p>A supposedly nonmagnetic 5d$^1$ double perosvkite oxide is investigated by a
combination of spectroscopic and theoretical methods, namely resonant inelastic
X-ray scattering, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, magnetic circular dichroism,
and multiplet ligand field calculations. We found that the large spin-orbit
coupling admixes the 5d $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals, covalency raises the 5d
population well above the nominal value, and the local symmetry is lower than
$O_h$. The obtained electronic interactions account for the finite magnetic
moment of Os in this compound and, in general, of 5d$^1$ ions. Our results
provide direct evidence of elusive Jahn-Teller distortions, hinting at a strong
electron-lattice coupling.

<p>We demonstrated the lattice structures and the superconducting phases of
metallic double-chain based cuprate Pr2Ba4Cu7O15-delta exhibiting higher Tc.
After the oxygen heat treatment on citrate pyrolysis precursors, their
reduction treatment followed by a quench procedure caused higher Tc samples
with 26.5-30 K. The crystal structural parameters for the superconducting
sample (delta = 0.81) were analyzed from the powder synchrotron X-ray
diffraction data using RIETAN-FP program. The effect of magnetic field on the
superconducting phase of these samples with different oxygen defects (delta
=0.73, 0.81 and 0.87) was examined, for our understanding of the
superconducting magnetic field-temperature phase diagram. For delta = 0.87
sample with Tc = 30 K, the resistive critical field Hc* was estimated to be 13
T at 4.2 K. The resistive transition broadening under the applied magnetic
field was not due to the motion of magnetic flux driven by Lorenz force. The
oxygen deficiency dependence on Tc,on for our samples was compared with the
data of several other groups.

<p>The multifaceted physics of oxides is shaped by their composition and the
presence of defects, which are often accompanied by the formation of polarons.
The simultaneous presence of polarons and defects, and their complex
interactions, pose challenges for first-principles simulations and experimental
techniques. In this study, we leverage machine learning and a first-principles
database to analyze the distribution of surface oxygen vacancies (V$_{\rm O}$)
and induced small polarons on rutile TiO$_2$(110), effectively disentangling
the interactions between polarons and defects. By combining neural-network
supervised learning and simulated annealing, we elucidate the inhomogeneous
V$_{\rm O}$ distribution observed in scanning probe microscopy (SPM). Our
innovative approach allows us to understand and predict defective surface
patterns at previously inaccessible length scales, identifying the specific
role of individual types of defects. Specifically, surface-polaron-stabilizing
V$_{\rm O}$-configurations are identified, which could have consequences for
surface reactivity.

<p>Crystal structures of ANb$_3$Br$_7$S compounds with A = Rb and Cs are
represented by chains of the triangular Nb$_3$ cluster core, as refined by
single crystal X-ray diffraction, to form highly anisotropic materials. The
Nb$_3$ cluster core contains seven valence electrons, six of them being
assigned to Nb--Nb bonding within the Nb$_3$ triangle and one unpaired d
electron. The presence of this surplus electron gives rise to the formation of
long-range ordered states. The connectivity in the structures is represented by
one-dimensional [Nb$_3$Br$_7$S]$^-$ chains, containing a sulphur atom capping
one face ($\mu_3$) of the triangular niobium cluster as Nb$_3$S, which is
believed to induce an important electronic feature. Several types of studies
are undertaken to obtain deeper insight into the understanding of this unusual
type of material: the crystal structure, morphology and elastic properties are
analysed, as well the (photo-) electrical properties and NMR relaxation.
Electronic structure (DFT) calculations are performed in order to understand
the electronic structure and transport in these compounds, and, based on the
experimental and theoretical results, we propose that the electronic
interactions along the Nb chains are sufficiently one-dimensional to give rise
to Luttinger liquid (rather than Fermi liquid) behaviour of the metallic
electrons.

<p>The Arrhenius law predicts the transition time between equilibrium states in
physical systems due to thermal activation, with broad applications in material
science, magnetic hyperthermia and paleomagnetism where it is used to estimate
the transition time and thermal stability of assemblies of magnetic
nanoparticles. Magnetite is a material of great importance in paleomagnetic
studies and magnetic hyperthermia but existing estimates of the attempt
frequency $f_0$ vary by several orders of magnitude in the range $10^7-10^{13}$
Hz, leading to significant uncertainty in their relaxation rate. Here we
present a dynamical method enabling full parameterization of the
Arrhenius-N\'eel law using atomistic spin dynamics. We determine the
temperature and volume dependence of the attempt frequency of magnetite
nanoparticles with cubic anisotropy and find a value of $f_0 = 0.562 \pm 0.059$
GHz at room temperature. For particles with enhanced anisotropy we find a
significant increase in the attempt frequency and a strong temperature
dependence suggesting an important role of anisotropy. The method is applicable
to a wide range of dynamical systems where different states can be clearly
identified and enables robust estimates of domain state stabilities, with
particular importance in the rapidly developing field of micromagnetic analysis
of paleomagnetic recordings where samples can be numerically reconstructed to
provide a better understanding of geomagnetic recording fidelity over
geological time scales.

<p>We have investigated the magnetic ground state properties of the quantum spin
trimer compound strontium hydroxy copper chloride SrCu(OH)$_3$Cl using bulk
magnetization, specific heat measurements, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),
and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. SrCu(OH)$_3$Cl consists of
layers with isolated Cu$^{2+}$ triangles and hence provides an opportunity to
understand the magnetic ground state of an isolated system of \textit{S} = 1/2
arranged on an equilateral triangle. Although magnetization measurements do not
exhibit a phase transition to a long-range ordered state down to \textit{T} = 2
K, they reveal the characteristic behavior of isolated trimers with an exchange
of $J = 154$~K. The Curie-Weiss behavior changes
around 50--80~K, as is also seen in the NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate. In
zero magnetic field, our specific heat data establish a second-order phase
transition to an antiferromagnetic ground state below \textit{T}= 1.2 K. We
have drawn a magnetic field-temperature ($H$-$T$) phase diagram based on the
specific heat measurements. The ESR data show divergence of the linewidth at
lower temperatures, which precedes the phase transition to an antiferromagnetic
long-range ordered state with unconventional critical exponents. The
temperature variation of the $g$-factor further confirms the antiferromagnetic
phase transition and reflects the underlying magneto-crystalline anisotropy of
the compound.

<p>Wormlike micellar solutions formed by long-chained zwitterionic surfactants
show gel-like rheology at room temperature and have recently been found to
exhibit other complex and interesting rheological features. We study the
dynamics of these wormlike micellar gels in a pipe-flow scenario using optical
coherence tomography-based velocimetry and report the existence of plug flows
with strong wall slip and non-parabolic velocity profiles for different
surfactant concentrations and imposed flow rates. We rationalize these results
as features of a developing transient flow of a viscoelastic solution in space
and time and show that these shear layers indicate a flow induced
heterogeneity. Our experiments shed light on the transient fluid dynamics of
wormlike micelles in simple geometries and highlight the complexity of flows
involving wormlike micellar gels and similar soft matter systems in canonical
flows.

<p>Microscopic active droplets are of interest since they can be used to
transport matter from one point to another. The challenge is to control the
trajectory. In this work, we demonstrate an approach to control the direction
of active droplet propulsion by a photoresponsive cholesteric liquid crystal
environment. The active droplet represents a water dispersion of bacterial B.
subtilis microswimmers. When placed in a cholesteric, a surfactant-stabilized
active droplet distorts the local director field, producing a point
defect-hedgehog, which breaks the fore-aft symmetry. The chaotic motion of the
bacteria inside the droplet is rectified into directional motion by the
asymmetric director field outside the droplet. When the pitch of the
cholesteric is altered by visible light irradiation, the asymmetry axis and
thus the droplet trajectory realign along a new direction. Droplets realign
counterclockwise on exposure to light of 535 nm, and clockwise on exposure to
light of 450 nm, as dictated by the photoinduced change in the handedness of
the cholesteric. The strategy allows for a non-contact dynamic control of
active droplets trajectories and demonstrates the advantage of orientationally
ordered media in control of active matter over their isotropic counterparts.

<p>Defects dictate the properties of many functional materials. To understand
the behaviour of defects and their impact on physical properties, it is
necessary to identify the most stable defect geometries. However, global
structure searching is computationally challenging for high-throughput defect
studies or materials with complex defect landscapes, like alloys or disordered
solids. Here, we tackle this limitation by harnessing a machine-learning
surrogate model to qualitatively explore the defect structural landscape. By
learning defect motifs in a family of related metal chalcogenide and mixed
anion crystals, the model successfully predicts favourable reconstructions for
unseen defects in unseen compositions for 90% of cases, thereby reducing the
number of first-principles calculations by 73%. Using CdSe$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ alloys
as an exemplar, we train a model on the end member compositions and apply it to
find the stable geometries of all inequivalent vacancies for a range of mixing
concentrations, thus enabling more accurate and faster defect studies for
configurational complex systems.

<p>Spin-orbit torques (SOTs) act as efficient drivers for nanoscale magnetic
systems, such as in magnetic tunnel junctions, nano-oscillators and racetrack
geometries. In particular, in combination with materials exhibiting high
Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction, SOTs are considered to result in
well-controlled deterministic magnetisation dynamics and are, therefore, used
as robust drives to move and create magnetic skyrmions. In contrast to these
expectations, we here find unpredictable, transiently chaotic dynamics induced
by SOT at an artificial anisotropy-engineered defect in a magnetic racetrack.
Based on these controlled conditions, we directly observe the nanoscale
dynamics with holography-based, time-resolved x-ray imaging. In concert with
micromagnetic simulations, we disclose a regime of violent picosecond
fluctuations, including topological instabilities that, remarkably, result in
deterministic final configurations. In addition, our images expose previously
unseen skyrmion shedding and highlight the potential of transiently chaotic
pathways for topological switching. Our approach offers new perspectives for
the investigation and application of highly non-linear SOT dynamics in
spintronics materials.

<h3>Superfluidity of indirect momentum space dark dipolar excitons in a  double layer with massive anisotropic tilted semi-Dirac bands</h3>

<i>A. Nafis Arafat, Oleg L. Berman, Godfrey Gumbs</i>
<p>We have theoretically investigated the spin- and valley-dependent
superfluidity properties of indirect momentum space dark dipolar excitons in
double layers with massive anisotropic tilted semi-Dirac bands in the presence
of circularly polarized irradiation. An external vertical electric field is
also applied to the structure and is responsible for tilting and gap opening
for the band structure. For our calculations we used the parameters of a double
layer of 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$. Closed form analytical expressions are presented
for the energy spectrum for excitons, their associated wave functions and
binding energies. Additionally, we examine the effects which the intensity and
frequency of circularly polarized irradiation has for 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$ on
the effective mass of the excitons since it has been demonstrated that the
application of an external high-frequency dressing field tailors the crucial
electronic including the exciton binding energy, as well as the critical
temperature for superfluidity. We also calculate the sound velocity in the
anisotropic weakly-interacting Bose gas of two-component indirect momentum
space dark excitons for a double layer of 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$. We show that the
critical velocity of superfluidity, the spectrum of collective excitations,
concentrations of the superfluid and normal component, and mean field critical
temperature for superfluidity are anisotropic and formed by a two-component
system. The critical temperature for superfluidity is increased when the
exciton concentration and interlayer separation are increased. We propose the
use of phonon-assisted photoluminescence to experimentally confirm directional
superfluidity of indirect momentum space dark excitons in a double layer with
massive anisotropic tilted semi-Dirac bands.

<p>How electronic topology develops in strongly correlated systems represents a
fundamental challenge in the field of quantum materials. Recent studies have
advanced the characterization and diagnosis of topology in Mott insulators
whose underlying electronic structure is topologically nontrivial, through
``Green's function zeros". However, their counterparts in metallic systems have
yet to be explored. Here, we address this problem in an orbital-selective Mott
phase (OSMP), which is of extensive interest to a variety of strongly
correlated systems with a short-range Coulomb repulsion. We demonstrate
symmetry protected crossing of the zeros in an OSMP. Utilizing the concept of
Green's function Berry curvature, we show that the zero crossing has a
quantized Berry flux. The resulting notion of Dirac zeros provides a window
into the largely hidden landscape of topological zeros in strongly correlated
metallic systems and, moreover, opens up a means to diagnose strongly
correlated topology in new materials classes.

<h3>Toward new scaling laws for wrinkling in biologically relevant  fiber-reinforced bilayers</h3>

<i>A. Mirandola, A. Cutolo, A. R. Carotenuto, N. Nguyen, L. Pocivavsek, M. Fraldi, L. Deseri</i>
<p>Wrinkling, creasing and folding are frequent phenomena encountered in
biological and man-made bilayers made by thin films bonded to thicker and
softer substrates often containing fibers. Paradigmatic examples of the latter
are the skin, the brain, and arterial walls, for which wiggly cross-sections
are detected. Although experimental investigations on corrugation of these and
analog bilayers would greatly benefit from scaling laws for prompt comparison
of the wrinkling features, neither are they available nor have systematic
approaches yielding to such laws ever been provided before. This gap is filled
in this paper, where a uniaxially compressed bilayer formed by a thin elastic
film bonded on a hyperelastic fiber-reinforced substrate is considered. The
force balance at the film-substrate interface is here analytically and
numerically investigated for highly mismatched film-substrates. The onset of
wrinkling is then characterized in terms of both the critical strain and its
corresponding wavenumber. Inspired by the asymptotic laws available for
neo-Hookean bilayers, the paper then provides a systematic way to achieve novel
scaling laws for the wrinkling features for fiber-reinforced highly mismatched
hyperelastic bilayers. Such novel scaling laws shed light on the key
contributions defining the response of the bilayer, as it is characterized by a
fiber-induced complex anisotropy. Results are compared with Finite Element
Analyses and also with outcomes of both existing linear models and available
adhoc scalings. Furthermore, the amplitude, the global maximum and minimum of
ruga occurring under increasing compression spanning the wrinkling, period
doubling and folding regimes are also obtained.

<p>The transparent conducting oxide SnO2 is a wide bandgap semiconductor that is
easily n-type doped and widely used in various electronic and optoelectronic
applications. Experimental reports of the electron mobility of this material
vary widely depending on the growth conditions and doping concentrations. In
this work, we calculate the electron mobility of SnO2 from first principles to
examine the temperature- and doping-concentration dependence, and to elucidate
the scattering mechanisms that limit transport. We include both electron-phonon
scattering and electron-ionized impurity scattering to accurately model
scattering in a doped semiconductor. We find a strongly anisotropic mobility
that favors transport in the direction parallel to the c-axis. At room
temperature and intrinsic carrier concentrations, the low-energy polar-optical
phonon modes dominate scattering, while ionized-impurity scattering dominates
above 10^18 cm^-3.

<p>Deep eutectic solvents with admixed lithium salts are considered as
electrolytes in electrochemical devices like batteries or supercapacitors. Here
we apply dielectric spectroscopy to the widely studied deep eutectic solvent
glyceline, to which 1 and 5 mol% LiCl were added. We investigate the glassy
freezing and rotation-translation coupling of these mixtures in a wide
temperature range, including the deeply supercooled state. The temperature
dependences of the detected dipolar reorientation dynamics and of the ionic dc
conductivity reveal the signatures of glassy freezing. In comparison to pure
glyceline, lithium admixture leads to a reduction of ionic conductivity, which
is accompanied by a slowing down of the rotational dipolar motions. In contrast
to pure glyceline, the ionic and dipolar dynamics become increasingly decoupled
at low temperatures and obey a fractional Debye-Stokes-Einstein relation as
previously found in other glass-forming liquids. The obtained results
demonstrate the relevance of decoupling effects and of the glass transition for
the technically relevant ionic conductivity of these solvents.

<i>Tom Roberts, Thomas Prellberg</i>
<p>Sampling with the Generalised Atmospheric Rosenbluth Method (GARM) is a
technique for estimating the distributions of lattice polymer models that has
had some success in the study of linear polymers and lattice polygons. In this
paper we will explain how and why such sampling appears not to be effective for
many models of branched polymers.
Analysing the algorithm on a simple binary tree, we argue that the
fundamental issue is an inherent bias towards extreme configurations that is
costly to correct with reweighting techniques.
We provide a solution to this by applying uniform sampling methods to the
atmospheres that are central to GARM. We caution that the ensuing computational
complexity often outweighs the improvements gained.

<i>R.L. Stamps</i>
<p>A variational Bayesian method is implemented in a numerical model of
interacting nanomagnetic elements to demonstrate active inference in an
Artificial Spin Ice geometry. It is shown that thermal fluctuations can drive
this magnetic spin system to evolve along a trajectory of spin configuration
states in response to an external environment according to a neurological free
energy principle with active inference. The proposed bilayer is an extension of
a two-dimensional system studied in an Artificial Spin Ice that has been
extensively investigated experimentally and theoretically. The two layers
function effectively as a sensory layer providing input to a hidden layer. The
spin dynamics displayed by the bilayer are shown to be well described using a
continuous form of the free energy principle that has been proposed as a high
level description of certain biological neural processes. Numerical simulations
demonstrate that this proposed bilayer geometry is able to reproduce
theoretical results derived previously for examples of neurological action and
perception.

Fe$_2$VAl$_{1.35}$. Data analysis in relation to {\it ab initio} calculations
indicates an appearance of antisite disorder mainly due to Fe--V and Fe--Al
stoichiometric variations. The data for weakly magnetic Fe$_2$VAl$_{1.35}$ are
discussed in respect to Ni$_2$VAl. Fe$_2$VAl$_{1.35}$ can be classified as a
nearly ferromagnetic metal with a pronounced spin glassy contribution, which,
however, does not give a predominant effect on its thermoelectric properties.
The figure of merit $ZT$ is at 300 K about 0.05 for the Fe sample and 0.02 for
Ni one, respectively. However, it is documented that the narrow $d$ band
resulting from Fe/V site exchange can be responsible for the unusual
temperature dependencies of the physical properties of the Fe2TiAl$_{1.35}$
alloy, characteristic of strongly correlated electron systems. As an example,
the magnetic susceptibility of Fe$_2$VAl$_{1.35}$ exhibits singularity
characteristic of a Griffiths phase, appearing as an inhomogeneous electronic
state below $T_G\sim 200$ K. We also performed numerical analysis which
supports the Griffiths phase scenario.
