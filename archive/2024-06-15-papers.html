<h3>Terahertz Dynamics in the Glycerol-Water System</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08032" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08032</a>
<br>
<i>Johanna Kölbel, Walter Schirmacher, Evgenyi Shalaev, J. Axel Zeitler</i>
<br>
<br>
The model glass-former glycerol and its aqueous mixtures were investigated
with terahertz-time domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) in the frequency range of
0.3--3.0\,THz at temperatures from 80--305\,K. It was shown that the infrared
absorption coefficient measured with THz-TDS can be theoretically related to
the reduced Raman intensity ($\propto \alpha/\omega^2$) and the reduced density
of states ($\propto \alpha/\omega^3$) and the agreement with experimental
results confirms this. The data were further used to investigate the behaviour
of model glasses in the harmonic (below the glass transition temperature
$T_{\text{g}}$), anharmonic (above $T_{\text{g}}$), and liquid regime. The
onset temperature of the molecular mobility as measured by the infrared active
dipoles, $T_{\text{g}}$, was found to correlate with the onset of anharmonic
effects, leading to an apparent shift of the boson peak and obscuring it at
elevated temperatures. The influence of clustered and unclustered water on the
dynamics, the boson peak, and the vibrational dynamics was also investigated. A
change in structural dynamics was observed at a water concentration of
approximately 5\,wt.\%, corresponding to a transition from isolated water
molecules distributed homogeneously throughout the sample to the presence of
small water clusters and an increased number of water-water hydrogen bonds
which lower the barriers on the potential energy surface.

<h3>Stress percolation criticality of glass to fluid transition in active  cell layers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08112" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08112</a>

<br>
<br>
Using three-dimensional representation of confluent cell layers, we map the
amorphous solid to fluid phase transition in active cell layers onto the
two-dimensional (2D) site percolation universality class. Importantly, we unify
two distinct, predominant, pathways associated with this transition; namely (i)
cell-cell adhesion and (ii) active traction forces. For each pathway, we
independently vary the corresponding control parameter and focus on the
emergent mechanical stress patterns as the monolayer transitions from a glassy-
to a fluid-like state. Through finite-size scaling analyses, our results lead
us to establish the glassy- to fluid-like transition as a critical phenomena in
terms of stress development in the cell layer and show that the associated
criticality belongs to the 2D site percolation universality class. Our findings
offer a fresh perspective on solid (glass-like) to fluid phase transition in
active cell layers and can bridge our understanding of glassy behaviors in
active matter with potential implications in biological processes such as wound
healing, development, and cancer progression.

<h3>Non-local magnon transconductance in extended magnetic insulating  films.\\ Part I: spin diode effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08304" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08304</a>

<br>
<br>
This review provides a comprehensive study of the nonlinear transport
properties of magnons, which are electrically emitted or absorbed inside
extended YIG films by spin transfer effects via a YIG$\vert$Pt interface. Our
purpose is to experimentally elucidate the pertinent picture behind the
asymmetric electrical variation of the magnon transconductance analogous to an
electric diode. The feature is rooted in the variation of the density of
low-lying spin excitations via an electrical shift of the magnon chemical
potential. As the intensity of the spin transfer increases in the forward
direction (regime of magnon emission), the transport properties of low-energy
magnon go through 3 distinct regimes: \textit{i)} at low currents, where the
spin current is a linear function of the electrical current, the spin transport
is ballistic and set by the film thickness; \textit{ii)} for amplitudes of the
order of the damping compensation threshold, it switches to a highly correlated
regime limited by magnon-magnon relaxation process and marked by a saturation
of the magnon transconductance. Here the main bias, that controls the magnon
density, are thermal fluctuations beneath the emitter. \textit{iii)} As the
temperature under the emitter approaches the Curie temperature, scattering with
high-energy magnons dominates, leading to diffusive transport. We note that
such sequence of transport regimes bears analogy with electron hydrodynamic
transport in ultra-pure media predicted by Radii Gurzhi. This study restricted
to low energy part of the magnon manifold complements part II of this
review\cite{kohno_2F}, which concentrates instead on the whole spectrum of
propagating magnons.

<h3>The Kraichnan Model and Non-Equilibrium Statistical Physics of Diffusive  Mixing</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08671" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08671</a>

<i>Gregory Eyink, Amir Jafari</i>
<br>
<br>
We discuss application of methods from the Kraichnan model of turbulent
advection to the study of non-equilibrium concentration fluctuations arising
during diffusion in liquid mixtures at high Schmidt numbers. This approach
treats nonlinear advection of concentration fluctuations exactly, without
linearization. Remarkably, we find that static and dynamic structure functions
obtained by this method reproduce precisely the predictions of linearized
fluctuating hydrodynamics. It is argued that this agreement is an analogue of
anomaly non-renormalization which does not, however, protect higher-order
multi-point correlations. The latter should thus yield non-vanishing cumulants,
unlike those for the Gaussian concentration fluctuations predicted by
linearized theory.

<h3>Stationary states of activity driven harmonic chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09035" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09035</a>
<br>
<i>Ritwick Sarkar, Ion Santra, Urna Basu</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the stationary state of a chain of harmonic oscillators driven by
two active reservoirs at the two ends. These reservoirs exert correlated
stochastic forces on the boundary oscillators which eventually leads to a
nonequilibrium stationary state of the system. We consider three most
well-known dynamics for the active force, namely, active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process, run-and-tumble process and active Brownian process, all of which have
exponentially decaying two-point temporal correlations but very different
higher order fluctuations. We show that irrespective of the specific dynamics
of the drive, the stationary velocity fluctuations are Gaussian in nature with
a kinetic temperature which remains uniform in the bulk. Moreover, we find the
emergence of an `equipartition of energy' in the bulk of the system -- the bulk
kinetic temperature equals the bulk potential temperature in the thermodynamic
limit. We also calculate the stationary distribution of the instantaneous
energy current in the bulk which always shows a logarithmic divergence near the
origin and asymmetric exponential tails. The signatures of specific active
driving become visible in the behavior of the oscillators near the boundary.
This is most prominent for the RTP and ABP driven chains where the boundary
velocity distributions become non-Gaussian and current distribution has a
finite cutoff.

<h3>Burstiness and information spreading in the active particles systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09139" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09139</a>
<br>
<i>Wei Zhong, Youjin Deng, Daxing Xiong</i>
<br>
<br>
We construct the temporal network using the two-dimensional active particle
systems which are described by the Vicsek model. The bursts of the interevent
times for a specific pair of particles are investigated numerically. We find
that for different noise strength, the distribution of the interevent times of
a target edge follows by a heavy-tail, revealing a strong burstiness of the
signals. To further characterize the nature of the burstiness, the burstiness
parameter and the memory coefficient are calculated. The results show that near
the critical points of the Vicsek model, the burstiness parameters reach the
minimum values for each density, indicating a relation between the phase
transition of the Vicsek model and the bursty nature of the signals. Besides,
the memory plays a negligible role in the burstiness. Further, we investigate
the spreading dynamics on our temporal network with the susceptible-infected
model, and observe a positive correlation between the burstiness and the
information spreading dynamics.

<h3>A comprehensive review on the ferroelectric orthochromates: Synthesis,  property, and application</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09170" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09170</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Multiferroics represent a class of advanced materials for promising
applications and stand at the forefront of modern science for the special
feature possessing both charge polar and magnetic order. Previous studies
indicate that the family of RECrO3 (RE = rare earth) compounds is likely
another rare candidate system holding both ferroelectricity and magnetism.
However, many issues remain unsolved, casting hot disputes about whether RECrO3
is multiferroic or not. For example, an incompatibility exists between reported
structural models and observed ferroelectric behaviors, and it is not easy to
determine the spin canting degree. To address these questions, one key step is
to grow single crystals because they can provide more reliable information than
other forms of matter do. In this review, the parent and doped ferroelectric
YCrO3 compounds are comprehensively reviewed based on scientific and patent
literatures from 1954 to 2022. The materials syntheses with different methods,
including poly-, nano-, and single-crystalline samples and thin films, are
summarized. The structural, magnetic, ferroelectric and dielectric, optical,
and chemical-pressure (on Y and Cr sites by doping) dependent chemical and
physical properties and the corresponding phase diagrams, are discussed.
Diverse (potential) applications, including anti-corrosion, magnetohydrodynamic
electrode, catalyst, negative-temperature-coefficient thermistor, magnetic
refrigeration, protective coating, and solid oxide fuel cell, are present. To
conclude, we summarize general results, reached consensuses, and existing
controversies of the past nearly 69 years of intensive studies and highlight
future research opportunities and emerging challenges to address existing
issues.

<h3>Ordering kinetics in active polar fluid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09199" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09199</a>
<br>
<i>Shambhavi Dikshit, Shradha Mishra</i>
<br>
<br>
We modeled the active polar fluid using the nonconserved orientation field
coupled to a momentum conserving solvent. The growth kinetics of local
orientation field is studied. The effect of active fluid is contractile or
extensile depending upon the sign of the active stress due to local
orientation. We explored the growth kinetics for different activity and find
that the activity introduces a correction to the domain growth dynamics. For
extensile fluid the growth is enhanced whereas for the contractile case we find
the suppression. The asymptotic growth law becomes pure algebraic in the
presence of activity. We also found that domain morphology remains unchanged
due to activity and system shows the good dynamic scaling for all activities.
Our study provides the understanding of ordering kinetics in active polar
fluid.

<h3>Traces of Electron-Phonon Coupling in One-Dimensional Cuprates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09288" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09288</a>
<br>
<i>Ta Tang, Brian Moritz, Cheng Peng, Z. X. Shen, Thomas P. Devereaux</i>
<br>
<br>
The appearance of certain spectral features in one-dimensional (1D) cuprate
materials has been attributed to a strong, extended attractive coupling between
electrons. Here, using time-dependent density matrix renormalization group
methods on a Hubbard-extended Holstein model, we show that extended
electron-phonon ({\it e-ph}) coupling presents an obvious choice to produce
such an attractive interaction that reproduces the observed spectral features
and doping dependence seen in angle-resolved photoemission experiments:
diminished $3k_F$ spectral weight, prominent spectral intensity of a
holon-folding branch, and the correct holon band width. While extended {\it
e-ph} coupling does not qualitatively alter the ground state of the 1D system
compared to the Hubbard model, it quantitatively enhances the long-range
superconducting correlations and suppresses spin correlations. Such an extended
{\it e-ph} interaction may be an important missing ingredient in describing the
physics of the structurally similar two-dimensional high-temperature
superconducting layered cuprates, which may tip the balance between intertwined
orders in favor of uniform $d$-wave superconductivity.

<h3>Integer characteristic polynomial factorization and Hilbert space  fragmentation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08019" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08019</a>
<br>
<i>Nicolas Regnault, B. Andrei Bernevig</i>
<br>

Models with Hilbert space fragmentation are characterized by (exponentially)
many dynamically disconnected subspaces, not associated with conventional
symmetries but captured by nontrivial Krylov subspaces. These subspaces usually
exhibit a whole range of thermalization properties, from chaotic to integrable,
to quantum many-body scars. However, so far, they have not been properly
defined, nor can they be easily found, given a Hamiltonian. In this work, we
consider Hamiltonians that have integer representations, a common feature of
many (most) celebrated models in condensed matter. We show the equivalence of
the integer characteristic polynomial factorization and the existence of Krylov
subspaces generated from integer vectors. Considering the pair-hopping model,
we illustrate how the factorization property can be used as a method to unveil
Hilbert space fragmentation. We discuss the generalization over other rings of
integers, for example those based on the cyclotomic field which are relevant
when working in a given ($\ne 0, \pi$) momentum sector.

<h3>Strong correlations in ABC-stacked trilayer graphene: Moiré is  important</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08025" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08025</a>
<br>
<i>Adarsh S. Patri, T. Senthil</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent experiments on multilayer graphene materials have discovered a
plethora of correlated phases, including ferromagnetism and superconductivity,
in the absence of a moir\'{e} potential. These findings pose an intriguing
question of whether an underlying moir\'{e} potential plays a key role in
determining the phases realizable in tunable two-dimensional quantum materials,
or whether it merely acts as a weak periodic potential that perturbs an
underlying correlated many body state. In this work, employing a Hartree-Fock
mean field analysis, we examine this question theoretically by quantitatively
studying the effects of an hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN) substrate on
ABC-stacked trilayer graphene (ABC-TLG). For the topologically trivial regime,
we find that the moir\'{e} potential leads to a strong suppression of the
ferromagnetism of the underlying metal. Further, band insulators appear solely
at full filling of the moir\'{e} unit cell, with a moir\'{e} potential stronger
than is conventionally assumed. Thus the observed correlated insulating phases
in ABC-TLG aligned with h-BN cannot be understood through band folding of the
ferromagnetic metal found without the moir\'{e} potential. For the
topologically non-trivial regime, we discover the appearance of prominent
incompressible states when fractional hole fillings (of the moir\'{e} unit
cell) coincide with the occurrence of fractional-metallic states in the
moir\'{e}-less setting, as well as a slight weakening of the ferromagnetic
nature of the phases; however this once again requires a moir\'{e} potential
stronger than is conventionally assumed. Our findings highlight the importance
of interactions in renormalizing the electronic bandstructure, and emphasizes
the key role played by the moir\'{e} potential in determining the strong
correlation physics.

<h3>Magnetic-field-induced cavity protection for intersubband polaritons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08026" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08026</a>
<br>
<i>Daniele De Bernardis, Mathieu Jeannin, Jean-Michel Manceau, Raffaele Colombelli, Alessandro Tredicucci, Iacopo Carusotto</i>
<br>
<br>
We analyse the effect of a strong perpendicular magnetic field on an
intersubband transition in a disordered doped quantum well strongly coupled to
an optical cavity. The magnetic field changes the lineshape of the intersubband
optical transition due to the interface roughness of the quantum well from a
Lorentzian to a Gaussian one. In this regime, a novel form of
magnetic-field-induced cavity protection sets in, which strongly reduces the
polariton linewidth to the cavity contribution only. Implications of our
results for fundamental studies of nonlinear polariton dynamics and for
technological applications to polariton lasers are finally highlighted.

<h3>Rapid Method for Computing the Mechanical Resonances of Irregular  Objects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08033" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08033</a>

A solid object's geometry, density, and elastic moduli completely determine
its spectrum of normal modes. Solving the inverse problem - determining a
material's elastic moduli given a set of resonance frequencies and sample
geometry - relies on the ability to compute resonance spectra accurately and
efficiently. Established methods for calculating these spectra are either fast
but limited to simple geometries, or are applicable to arbitrarily shaped
samples at the cost of being prohibitively slow. Here, we describe a method to
rapidly compute the normal modes of irregularly shaped objects using entirely

<br>
<br>
We investigate axial segregation of binary mixtures in a laterally shaken
horizontal channel formed by ratchet-like sidewalls that appear as concatenated
trapeziums when not offset axially. Grain mixtures shaken in such a channel are
observed to segregate in two stages: they first separate rapidly into two
vertically arranged layers and, then, these layers move axially in opposite
directions, segregating the two species. Here, we conduct experiments to study
the influence on the segregation process of various parameters: the size ratio
of grains, the shaking frequency and the channel's geometry. We find that (a)
segregation quality depends upon shaking frequency and it is possible to find a
unique optimal frequency for segregation, (b) the optimal frequency lowers with
increase in size ratio, (c) segregation is generally poorer when the sidewalls
are more inclined to each other, and (d) segregation is improved when the
sidewalls are axially offset from each other. We then carry out discrete
element simulations of the segregation process in order to relate the
experimental observations to the interfacial pressure gradient mechanism of
Bhateja et al. [Bhateja, A., I. Sharma and J. K. Singh 2017. Segregation
physics of a macroscale granular ratchet, Phys. Rev. Fluids 2, 052301]. We
demonstrate that the segregation quality correlates well with the scaled
interfacial pressure gradient, which is the ratio of the interfacial pressure
gradient between the layers, formed in the first stage of the segregation
process, to the axial body force provided by the tapered sidewalls.

<h3>Probing Fermi sea topology by Andreev state transport</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08048" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08048</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We show that the topology of the Fermi sea of a two-dimensional electron gas
(2DEG) is reflected in the ballistic Landauer transport along a long and narrow
Josephson $\pi$-junction that proximitizes the 2DEG. The low-energy Andreev
states bound to the junction are shown to exhibit a dispersion that is
sensitive to the Euler characteristic of the Fermi sea ($\chi_F$). We highlight
two important relations: one connects the electron/hole nature of Andreev
states to the convex/concave nature of Fermi surface critical points, and one
relates these critical points to $\chi_F$. We then argue that the transport of
Andreev states leads to a quantized conductance that probes $\chi_F$. An
experiment is proposed to measure this effect, from which we predict an $I$-$V$
characteristic that not only captures the topology of Fermi sea in metals, but
also resembles the rectification effect in diodes. Finally, we evaluate the
feasibility of measuring this quantized response in graphene, InAs and HgTe
2DEGs.

<h3>Bose-Einstein condensates and the thin-shell limit in anisotropic bubble  traps</h3>

<br>
<br>
Within the many different models that appeared with the use of cold atoms to
design BECs the bubble trap shaped potential has been of great interest. For
the anisotropic bubble trap physics in the thin-shell limit the relationship
between the physical parameters and the resulting manifold geometry is yet to
be fully understood. In this paper, we work towards this goal showing how the
parameters of the system must be manipulated in order to allow for a
non-collapsing thin-shell limit. In such a limit, a dimensional
compactification takes place thus leading to an effective 2D Hamiltonian which
relates to up-to-date bubble trap experiments. At last, our Hamiltonian is
pertubatively solved for some particular cases as applications of our theory.

<h3>The effect of different 3-D QED vertex ansaetze on critical coupling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08108" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08108</a>
<br>
<i>M.E. Carrington, A.R. Frey, B.A. Meggison</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the semi-metal/insulator phase transition in graphene using a
Schwinger-Dyson approach. We consider various forms of vertex ansaetze to
truncate the hierarchy of Schwinger-Dyson equations. We define a Ball-Chiu type
vertex that truncates the equations without violating gauge invariance. We show
that there is a family of these vertices, parametrized by a continuous
parameter that we call a, all of which satisfy the Ward identity. We have
calculated the critical coupling of the phase transition using different values
of a. We have also tested a common approximation in which only the first term
in the Ball-Chiu ansatz is included. This vertex is independent of a, and,
although it is not gauge invariant, it has been used many times in the
literature because of the numerical simplifications it provides. We have found
that, with a one-loop photon polarization tensor, the results obtained for the
critical coupling from the truncated vertex and the full vertex with a = 1
agree very well, but other values of a give significantly different results. We
have also done a fully self-consistent calculation, in which the photons are
backcoupled to the fermion degrees of freedom, for one choice a = 1. Our
results show that when photon dynamics are correctly taken into account, it is
no longer true that the truncated vertex and the full Ball-Chiu vertex with a =
1 agree well. The conclusion is that traditional vertex truncations do not
really make sense in a system that does not respect Lorentz invariance, like
graphene, and the need to include vertex contributions self-consistently is
likely inescapable.

<h3>Tetragonal-phase SnOFeSe: A possible parent compound of FeSe-based  superconductor</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08146" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08146</a>
<br>
<i>Xiao-Xiao Man, Pei-Han Sun, Jian-Feng Zhang, Zhong-Yi Lu, Kai Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent experiments have reported that inserting metal atoms or small
molecules in between the FeSe layers of $\beta$-FeSe can significantly enhance
the superconducting transition temperature. Here, based on first-principles
electronic structure calculations, we propose a stable compound SnOFeSe by
alternatively stacking the SnO and $\beta$-FeSe layers. The predicted SnOFeSe
has the same tetragonal structure as the well-known FeAs-based compound
LaOFeAs, meanwhile their electronic structures in the nonmagnetic state are
quite similar. The magnetic ground state of SnOFeSe is predicted to be the
dimer antiferromagnetic (AFM) state, which is energetically only 2.77 (2.15)
meV/Fe lower than the trimer (dimer-trimer-dimer-trimer) AFM state, indicating
that strong magnetic fluctuations might be induced via slight modulation.
Interestingly, SnOFeSe is at the verge of metal-insulator transition in these
low-energy magnetic states, hence bridging the metallic parent compounds of
iron-based superconductors and the insulating ones of cuprate superconductors.
With the reduced dimensionality, monolayer SnOFeSe also shows great
similarities in the electronic and magnetic properties to its bulk phase. Given
that SnOFeSe is adjacent to magnetic frustration and resembles LaOFeAs in both
crystal and electronic structures, we suggest that SnOFeSe is a possible
superconductor parent compound, which may provide a promising platform to study
the interplay between magnetism and unconventional superconductivity in
FeSe-derived materials.

<h3>Absence of edge reconstruction for quantum Hall edge channels in  graphene devices</h3>

<br>
<br>
Electronic edge states in topological insulators have become a major paradigm
in physics. The oldest and primary example is that of quantum Hall (QH) edge
channels that propagate along the periphery of two-dimensional electron gases
(2DEGs) under perpendicular magnetic field. Yet, despite 40 years of intensive
studies using a variety of transport and scanning probe techniques, imaging the
real-space structure of QH edge channels has proven difficult, mainly due to
the buried nature of most 2DEGs in semiconductors. Here, we show that QH edge
states in graphene are confined to a few magnetic lengths at the crystal edges
by performing scanning tunneling spectroscopy up to the edge of a graphene
flake on hexagonal boron nitride. These findings indicate that QH edge states
are defined by boundary conditions of vanishing electronic wavefunctions at the
crystal edges, resulting in ideal one-dimensional chiral channels, free of
electrostatic reconstruction. We further evidence a uniform charge carrier
density at the edges, contrasting with conjectures on the existence of
non-topological upstream modes. The absence of electrostatic reconstruction of
quantum Hall edge states has profound implications for the universality of
electron and heat transport experiments in graphene-based systems and other 2D
crystalline materials.

<h3>Parallel spin-momentum locking in a chiral topological semimetal</h3>

<br>
<br>
Spin-momentum locking in solids describes a directional relationship between
the electron's spin angular momentum and its linear momentum over the entire
Fermi surface. While orthogonal spin-momentum locking, such as Rashba
spin-orbit coupling, has been studied for decades and inspired a vast number of
applications, its natural counterpart, the purely parallel spin-momentum
locking, has remained elusive in experiments. Recently, chiral topological
semimetals that host single- and multifold band crossings have been predicted
to realize such parallel locking. Here, we use spin- and angle-resolved
photoelectron spectroscopy to probe spin-momentum locking of a multifold
fermion in the chiral topological semimetal PtGa via the spin-texture of its
topological Fermi-arc surface states. We find that the electron spin of the
Fermi-arcs points orthogonal to their Fermi surface contour for momenta close
to the projection of the bulk multifold fermion, which is consistent with
parallel spin-momentum locking of the latter. We anticipate that our discovery
of parallel spin-momentum locking of multifold fermions will lead to the
integration of chiral topological semimetals in novel spintronic devices, and
the search for spin-dependent superconducting and magnetic instabilities in
these materials.

<h3>Cross derivative of the Gibbs free energy: for phase transitions in the  spin-1 XXZ chain with anisotropies</h3>

<br>
<i>H. Y. Wu, Yu-Chin Tzeng, Z. Y. Xie, K. Ji, J. F. Yu</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we extend the scope of the cross derivative of the Gibbs free
energy, proposed initially for phase transitions in classical spin models, to
the study of the 3rd- and 5th-order Gaussian-type quantum phase transitions in
spin-1 XXZ chain with uniaxial and rhombic single-ion anisotropies. These
higher-order quantum phase transitions are very difficult to determine by
conventional methods. From the cross derivative with respect to the two
anisotropic strengths, a single valley structure is observed clearly in each
system size. The finite-size extrapolation of the valley depth shows a perfect
logarithmic divergency, signaling the onset of a phase transition therein.
Meanwhile, the critical point and the critical exponent for the correlation
length are obtained by a power-law fitting of the valley location in each size.
The results are in good consistency with best estimations in the literature.
The application to other quantum systems with continuous phase transitions is
also discussed briefly.

<h3>Transport of mixed ultracold atoms at the S and D band in a moving  optical lattice</h3>

<br>
<br>
The ultracold atoms in a moving optical lattice with its high controllability
is a feasible platform to research the transport phenomenon. Here, we study the
transport process of ultracold atoms at the D band in a one-dimensional optical
lattice, and perform the manipulation of atomic transport by modulating the
population proportion of S band and D band. In the experiment, we first load
ultracold atoms into the optical lattice using shortcut method, and then
accelerate the optical lattice by scanning the phase of lattice beams. The
atomic transport in D band and S band is demonstrated respectively. We find the
group velocity of atoms in D band is opposite to that in S band. By doping
atoms of D band into that of S band, group velocity of the atomic superposition
state is modulated, and the manipulation of atomic group velocity from positive
to negative is realized. Furthermore, the influence of lattice depth and
acceleration on the transport distance are studied. The calculations with
multi-orbital simulation are coincident with the experimental results. Our work
provides a useful method to manipulate the atomic transport in higher or mixed
orbits.

<h3>Two-dimensional Penta-NiPS Sheets: Two Stable Polymorphs</h3>

<br>
<br>
The discovery of new and stable two-dimensional (2D) materials with exotic
properties is essential for technological advancement. Inspired by the recently
reported penta-PdPSe, we proposed penta-NiPS as a new member of the penta-2D
materials based on first-principles calculations. The penta-NiPS monolayer is
stable in two polymorphs including the alpha phase with identical structure as
penta-PdPSe, and the newly proposed beta phase with rotated sublayers.
Comprehensive analysis indicated that both phases are thermodynamically,
dynamically, mechanically, and thermally stable. The penta-NiPS is a soft
material with 2D Young's modulus of Ea=208 Nm^-1 and Eb=187 Nm^-1 for the alpha
phase and Ea=184 Nm^-1 and Eb=140 Nm^-1 for the beta phase. Interestingly, the
alpha-penta-NiPS showed nearly zero Poisson's ratios along the in-plane
direction, where its dimensions would be maintained when being extended. For
electronic applications, we demonstrated that penta-NiPS is the wide band gap
semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 2.35 eV for alpha phase, and 2.20 eV
for beta phase.

<h3>Molecular electronic junctions with stochastic structural transitions</h3>

<br>
<i>Daniel S. Kosov</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a theoretical approach to include dynamical aspects of molecular
structural fluctuations, such as, for example, forming and breaking hydrogen
bonds, isomerizations, and dynamical supramolecular structures, in
nonequilibrium Green's functions electron transport calculations. Structural
transitions are treated as a stochastic telegraph process, and the primary
quantity of interest is a retarded Green's function averaged over realizations
of a stochastic process. Using the Novikov-Furutsu functional stochastic
calculus method, we derive equations of motion for stochastically averaged
retarded Green's function in closed form. Consequently, we obtain the
expression for electric current averaged over transitions, which depends not
only on probabilities of observing particular molecular structures but also on
the dynamics. However, the proposed method has a significant limitation - we
have to assume that the imaginary parts of retarded self-energies produced by
left and right electrodes are proportional to each other; this significantly
restricts possible applications of the theory. Several examples illustrate the
proposed approach.

<h3>Non-local magnon transconductance in extended magnetic insulating  films.\\Part II: two-fluid behavior</h3>

<br>
<br>
This review provides a comprehensive study of the spatial dispersion of
propagating magnons, which are electrically emitted or absorbed inside extended
YIG films by the spin transfer effects via a YIG$\vert$Pt interface. Our
purpose is to provide a generic framework to describe magnon transconductance
inside extended magnetic insulating films. We experimentally elucidate the
relevant spectral contributions by studying the lateral decay of the magnon
signal. While most of the injected magnons do not reach the collector, the
propagating magnons may be split into two fluids: \textit{i)} a large portion
of high-energy magnons carrying energy of about $k_B T_0$, where $T_0$ is the
temperature of the lattice, with a characteristic decay length in the
sub-micrometer range and \textit{ii)} a small portion of low-energy magnons,
which are particles carrying energy of about $\hbar \omega_K$, where
$\omega_K/(2 \pi)$ is the Kittel frequency, with a characteristic decay length
in the micrometer range. Exploiting their different physical characteristics,
the low-energy magnons may become the dominant fluid \textit{i)} at large spin
transfer rate for the bias causing emission of magnons, \textit{ii)} at large
distance from the emitter, \textit{iii)} at small film thickness or
\textit{iv)} for reduced band mismatch between the YIG beneath the emitter and
the bulk due to temperature change of the magnon bath. This broader picture
amends part I \cite{kohno_SD}, which concentrates solely on the nonlinear
transport properties of low-energy magnons.

<br>
<br>
Interlayer excitons, or bound electron-hole pairs whose constituent
quasiparticles are located in distinct stacked semiconducting layers, are being
intensively studied in heterobilayers of two dimensional semiconductors. They
owe their existence to an intrinsic type-II band alignment between both layers
that convert these into p-n junctions. Here, we unveil a pronounced interlayer
exciton (IX) in heterobilayers of metal monochalcogenides, namely gamma-InSe on
epsilon-GaSe, whose pronounced emission is adjustable just by varying their
thicknesses given their number of layers dependent direct bandgaps.
Time-dependent photoluminescense spectroscopy unveils considerably longer
interlayer exciton lifetimes with respect to intralayer ones, thus confirming
their nature. The linear Stark effect yields a bound electron-hole pair whose
separation d is just (3.6 \pm 0.1) {\AA} with d being very close to dSe = 3.4
{\AA} which is the calculated interfacial Se separation. The envelope of IX is
twist angle dependent and describable by superimposed emissions that are nearly
equally spaced in energy, as if quantized due to localization induced by the
small moir\'e periodicity. These heterostacks are characterized by extremely
flat interfacial valence bands making them prime candidates for the observation
of magnetism or other correlated electronic phases upon carrier doping.

<h3>Disordered Systems Insights on Computational Hardness</h3>

<br>
<i>David Gamarnik, Cristopher Moore, Lenka Zdeborová</i>
<br>
<br>
In this review article, we discuss connections between the physics of
disordered systems, phase transitions in inference problems, and computational
hardness. We introduce two models representing the behavior of glassy systems,
the spiked tensor model and the generalized linear model. We discuss the random
(non-planted) versions of these problems as prototypical optimization problems,
as well as the planted versions (with a hidden solution) as prototypical
problems in statistical inference and learning. Based on ideas from physics,
many of these problems have transitions where they are believed to jump from
easy (solvable in polynomial time) to hard (requiring exponential time). We
discuss several emerging ideas in theoretical computer science and statistics
that provide rigorous evidence for hardness by proving that large classes of
algorithms fail in the conjectured hard regime. This includes the overlap gap
property, a particular mathematization of clustering or dynamical
symmetry-breaking, which can be used to show that many algorithms that are
local or robust to changes in their input fail. We also discuss the
sum-of-squares hierarchy, which places bounds on proofs or algorithms that use
low-degree polynomials such as standard spectral methods and semidefinite
relaxations, including the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. Throughout the
manuscript, we present connections to the physics of disordered systems and
associated replica symmetry breaking properties.

<br>
<br>
A primary method of reading out a quantum dot hybrid qubit involves
projection of the logical basis onto distinct charge states that are readily
detected by an integrated charge sensing dot. However, in the simplest
configuration, the excited charge state decays rapidly, making single-shot
readout challenging. Here, we demonstrate a readout procedure where the qubit
excited state is latched to a metastable charge configuration whose lifetime is
tunnel rate limited, persisting here as long as 2.5 ms. Additionally, we show
that working in the (4,1)-(3,2) charge configuration enables a latched readout
window that is larger and more tunable than typical charge configurations,
because the size of the readout window is determined by an orbital splitting
rather than a valley splitting.

The main research efforts are aimed at finding inexpensive materials that can

countries, where more than 95% of Rice husks are produced worldwide. Although
numerous studies have been conducted on the production of activated carbon and
graphene structures from Rice husk, the existing scientific information is
still widely scattered in the literature. Therefore, this review article
provides extensive information on made by various researchers, including the
Institute of combustion problems (Almaty, Kazakhstan), regarding the production
of nanostructured carbon-containing materials from rice husk and its adsorption
characteristics. The properties and pre-treatment of rice husk in relation to
the production of activated carbon and multilayer graphene are discussed. The
activation of rice husk by physical and chemical methods under different

The structures, strain fields, and defect distributions in solid materials
underlie the mechanical and physical properties across numerous applications.
Many modern microstructural microscopy tools characterize crystal grains,
domains and defects required to map lattice distortions or deformation, but are
limited to studies of the (near) surface. Generally speaking, such tools cannot
probe the structural dynamics in a way that is representative of bulk behavior.
Synchrotron X-ray diffraction based imaging has long mapped the deeply embedded
structural elements, and with enhanced resolution, Dark Field X-ray Microscopy
(DFXM) can now map those features with the requisite nm-resolution. However,
these techniques still suffer from the required integration times due to
limitations from the source and optics. This work extends DFXM to X-ray free
electron lasers, showing how the $10^{12}$ photons per pulse available at these
sources offer structural characterization down to 100 fs resolution (orders of
magnitude faster than current synchrotron images). We introduce the XFEL DFXM
setup with simultaneous bright field microscopy to probe density changes within
the same volume. This work presents a comprehensive guide to the multi-modal
ultrafast high-resolution X-ray microscope that we constructed and tested at
two XFELs, and shows initial data demonstrating two timing strategies to study
associated reversible or irreversible lattice dynamics.

Artificially twisted heterostructures of semiconducting transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer unprecedented control over their electronic and
optical properties via the spatial modulation of interlayer interactions and
structural reconstruction. Here we study twisted MoS2 bilayers in a wide range
of twist angles near 0{\deg} using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy/Spectroscopy.
We investigate the twist angle-dependence of the moir\'e pattern which is
dominated by lattice reconstruction for small angles (<2{\deg}) leading to
large triangular domains with rhombohedral stacking. Local spectroscopy
measurements reveal a large moir\'e-potential strength of 100-200 meV for
angles <3{\deg}. In reconstructed regions we see a bias-dependent asymmetry
between neighboring triangular domains which we relate to the vertical
polarization which is intrinsic to rhombohedral stacked TMDs. This viewpoint is
urther supported by spectroscopy maps and ambient Piezoresponse measurements.
Our results provide a microscopic perspective on this new class of interfacial
ferroelectrics and can offer clues for designing novel heterostructures which
harness this effect.

We study solutions to the Lippmann-Schwinger equation in systems which
contain several subsystems whose dynamics evolve at different timescales (or
equivalently whose energyscales are different). We prove two theorems that show
1. that surprisingly scattering from the slow to the fast subsystem is
suppressed and 2. how to compute the scattering wavefunction in the limit where
the ratio between both scales diverges. The theorems rely on fairly general
assumptions and thus apply to a huge variety of systems. A result of this type
is especially useful for studying scattering resonantly Floquet-driven
impurities. As an example we apply the theorem to examine pair breaking in a
Fermi-Hubbard chain at a resonantly Floquet-driven impurity.

The physics of dirty bosons highlights the intriguing interplay of disorder
and interactions in quantum systems, playing a central role in describing, for
instance, ultracold gases in a random potential, doped quantum magnets, and
amorphous superconductors. Here, we demonstrate how quantum computers can be
used to elucidate the physics of dirty bosons in one and two dimensions.
Specifically, we explore the disorder-induced delocalized-to-localized
transition using adiabatic state preparation. In one dimension, the quantum
circuits can be compressed to small enough depths for execution on currently
available quantum computers. In two dimensions, the compression scheme is no
longer applicable, thereby requiring the use of large-scale classical state
vector simulations to emulate quantum computer performance. In addition,
simulating interacting bosons via emulation of a noisy quantum computer allowed
us to study the effect of quantum hardware noise on the physical properties of
the simulated system. Our results suggest that scaling laws control how noise
modifies observables versus its strength, the circuit depth, and the number of
qubits. Moreover, we observe that noise impacts the delocalized and localized
phases differently. A better understanding of how noise alters the genuine
properties of the simulated system is essential for leveraging noisy
intermediate-scale quantum devices for simulation of dirty bosons, and indeed
for condensed matter systems in general.

Geometric frustration offers a pathway to soft matter self-assembly with
controllable finite sizes. While the understanding of frustration in soft
matter assembly derives almost exclusively from continuum elastic descriptions,
a current challenge is to understand the connection between microscopic
physical properties of misfitting ``building blocks" and emergent assembly
behavior at mesoscale. We present and analyze a particle-based description of
what is arguably the best studied example for frustrated soft matter assembly,
negative-curvature ribbon assembly, observed in both assemblies of chiral
surfactants and shape-frustrated nanoparticles. Based on our particle model,
known as {\it saddle wedge monomers}, we numerically test the connection
between microscopic shape and interactions of the misfitting subunits and the
emergent behavior at the supra-particle scale, specifically focusing on the
propagation and relaxation of inter-particle strains, the emergent role of
extrinsic shape on frustrated ribbons and the equilibrium regime of finite
width selection. Beyond the intuitive role of shape misfit, we show that
self-limitation is critically dependent on the finite range of cohesive
interactions, with larger size finite assemblies requiring increasing
short-range interparticle forces. Additionally, we demonstrate that
non-linearities arising from discrete particle interactions alter self-limiting
behavior due to both strain-softening in shape-flattened assembly and partial
yielding of highly strained bonds, which in turn may give rise to states of
hierarchical, multidomain assembly. Tracing the regimes of frustration-limited
assembly to the specific microscopic features of misfitting particle shapes and
interactions provides necessary guidance for translating the theory of
size-programmable assembly into design of intentionally-frustrated colloidal
particles.

We calculate the magnetic SANS cross section of dilute ensembles of uniformly
magnetized and randomly-oriented Stoner-Wohlfarth particles using the
Landau-Lifshitz equation. The focus of our study is on the angular anisotropy
of the magnetic SANS signal as it can be seen on a two-dimensional
position-sensitive detector. Depending on the symmetry of the magnetic
anisotropy of the particles (e.g. uniaxial, cubic), an anisotropic magnetic
SANS pattern may result, even in the demagnetized state or at the coercive
field. The case of inhomogeneously magnetized particles and the effects of a
particle-size distribution and interparticle correlations are discussed.

<h3>Magnetic damping anisotropy in the two-dimensional van der Waals  material Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ from first principles</h3>

<br>
<br>
Magnetization relaxation in the two-dimensional itinerant ferromagnetic van
der Waals material Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, below the Curie temperature, is
fundamentally important for applications to low-dimensional spintronics
devices. We use first-principles scattering theory to calculate the
temperature-dependent Gilbert damping for bulk and single-layer Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$.
The calculated damping frequency of bulk Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ increases monotonically
with temperature because of the dominance of resistivitylike behavior. By
contrast, a very weak temperature dependence is found for the damping frequency
of a single layer, which is attributed to strong surface scattering in this
highly confined geometry. A systematic study of the damping anisotropy reveals
that orientational anisotropy is present in both bulk and single-layer
Fe3GeTe2. Rotational anisotropy is significant at low temperatures for both the
bulk and a single layer and is gradually diminished by temperature-induced
disorder. The rotational anisotropy can be significantly enhanced by up to 430%
in gated single-layer Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$.

<i>Zhongyi Zhang, Shengshan Qin, Chen Fang, Jiangping Hu, Fu-chun Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that there are diversified Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)
interactions between magnetic impurities, mediated by itinerant electrons, in a
centrosymmetric crystal respecting a nonsymmorphic space group. We take the
$P4/nmm$ space group as an example. We demonstrate that the different type of
interactions, including the Heisenberg-type, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
(DM)-type, the Ising-type and the anisotropic interactions, can appear in
accordance with the positions of the impurities in the real space. Their
strengths strongly depend on the location of the itinerant electrons in the
reciprocal space. The diversity stems from the position-dependent site groups
and the momentum-dependent electronic structures guaranteed by the
nonsymmorphic symmetries. Our study unveils the role of the nonsymmorphic
symmetries in affecting magnetism, and suggests that the nonsymmorphic crystals
can be promising platforms to design magnetic interactions.

<h3>Quantum transport in driven systems with vibrations: Floquet  nonequilibrium Green's functions and the GD approximation</h3>

<i>Thomas D. Honeychurch, Daniel S. Kosov</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the effects of alternating voltage on nonequilibrium quantum
systems with localised phonon modes. Nonequilibrium Green's functions are
utilised, with electron-phonon coupling being considered with the $GD$
approximation (self-consistent Born approximation). Using a Floquet approach,
we assume periodicity of the dynamics. This approach allows us to investigate
the influence of the driven electronic component on the nonequilibrium
occupation of the vibrations. It was found that signatures of inelastic
transport gained photon-assisted peaks. A simplistic model was proposed and
found to be in good agreement with the full model in certain parameter ranges.
Moreover, it was found that driving the alternating current at resonance with
vibrational frequencies caused an increase in phonon occupation.

<br>
<br>
Recently, Floquet systems have attracted a great deal of interest as they
offer unprecedented ability to engineer topological states through the tuning
of an external time-periodic drive. Consequentially, seeking new driving
protocols that allow for more exotic topological phases and transitions becomes
imperative for the Floquet engineer. In this paper, we study the
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model driven by two time-dependent periodic sources with
commensurate frequencies and an amplitude modulation. Imposing more than one
driving frequency allows us to realize even more exotic topological phases
resulting from new couplings appearing in the Fourier space representation.
Moreover, we find an experimentally practical method for sweeping the system
through a topological phase transition by varying the amplitude mixture of the
commensurate sources. We employ the local Chern marker, a real space
representation of the Chern number, to simulate topological phase diagrams of
the two-drive Floquet Hamiltonian in a variety of driving cases.

<br>
<br>
Coherent optical excitation of certain phonon modes in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$
has been shown to induce superconducting-like interlayer coherence at
temperatures higher than $T_c$. Recent work has associated these phenomena to a
parametric excitation and amplification of Josephson plasma polaritons, which
are overdamped above $T_c$ but are made coherent by the phonon drive. However,
the dissipative response of uncondensed quasiparticles, which do not couple in
the same way to the phonon drive, has not been addressed. Here, we investigate
both the enhancement of the superfluid density, $\omega\sigma_2(\omega)$, and
the dissipative response of quasiparticles, $\sigma_1(\omega)$, by
systematically tuning the duration and energy of the mid-infrared pulse while
keeping the peak field fixed. We find that the photo-induced superfluid density
saturates to the zero-temperature equilibrium value for pulses made longer than
the phonon dephasing time, whilst the dissipative component continues to grow
with increasing pulse duration. We show that superfluid and dissipation remain
uncoupled as long as the drive is on, and identify an optimal regime of pump
pulse durations for which the superconducting response is maximum and
dissipation is minimized.

Under strong laser fields, electrons in solids radiate high-harmonic fields
by travelling through quantum pathways in Bloch bands in the sub-laser-cycle
timescales. Understanding these pathways in the momentum space through the
high-harmonic radiation can enable an all-optical ultrafast probe to observe
coherent lightwave-driven processes and measure electronic structures as
recently demonstrated for semiconductors. However, such demonstration has been
largely limited for semimetals because the absence of the bandgap hinders an
experimental characterization of the exact pathways. In this study, by
combining electrostatic control of chemical potentials with HHG measurement, we
resolve quantum pathways of massless Dirac fermions in graphene under strong
laser fields. Electrical modulation of HHG reveals quantum interference between
the multi-photon interband excitation channels. As the light-matter interaction
deviates beyond the perturbative regime, elliptically polarized laser fields
efficiently drive massless Dirac fermions via an intricate coupling between the
interband and intraband transitions, which is corroborated by our theoretical
calculations. Our findings pave the way for strong-laser-field tomography of
Dirac electrons in various quantum semimetals and their ultrafast electronics
with a gate control.

Nonequilibrium dynamics of many-body systems is challenging for classical
computing, providing opportunities for demonstrating practical quantum
computational advantage with analogue quantum simulators. It is proposed to be
classically intractable to sample driven thermalized many-body states of
Bose-Hubbard systems, and further extract multi-point correlations for
characterizing quantum phases. Here, leveraging dedicated precise manipulations
and number-resolved detection through a quantum gas microscope, we implement
and sample a 32-site driven Hubbard chain in the thermalized phase. Multi-point
correlations of up to 14th-order extracted from experimental samples offer
clear distinctions between the thermalized and many-body-localized phases. In
terms of estimated computational powers, the quantum simulator is comparable to
the fastest supercomputer with currently known best algorithms. Our work paves
the way towards practical quantum advantage in simulating Floquet dynamics of
many-body systems.

<br>
<br>
Zirconia (ZrO2) has emerged as a promising technical ceramic, both as high
temperature structural material and thermal barrier coating material, etc. The
traditional synthesis of ZrO2 with spark plasma sintering (SPS) usually
requires a sintering temperature as high as 1200C. General interest in lowering
the sintering temperature to reduce energy consumption and thermal stresses has
led to research on two promising routes, cold sintering via
temperature-dependent chemical reactivity and sintering aids, which facilitates
mass transport and improves densification. Here we combine both by developing a
single-step sintering process benefitting from both water vapor through the
in-situ conversion of Zr(OH)4 to ZrO2 and liquid phase Bi2O3 as a sintering
aid. The resultant ZrO2 has a relative density above 80 percent with a
sintering temperature as low as 900C.

<i>Margaret E. Carrington, Wade N. Cowie, Brett A. Meggison</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the semi-metal/insulator quantum phase transition in
three-dimensional Dirac semi-metals by solving a set of Schwinger-Dyson
equations. We study the effect of an anisotropic fermi velocity on the critical
coupling of the transition. We consider the influence of several different
approximations that are commonly used in the literature, and show that results
for the critical coupling change considerably when some of these approximations
are relaxed. However, in spite of the fact that the different approximations we
have investigated shift the value of the critical coupling, in almost all cases
they give that increasing anisotropy decreases the critical coupling. The
exception is the situation where the anisotropy is very large, where increasing
anisotropy can increase the critical coupling. However, further calculations
that include full photon dynamics and vertex corrections are necessary to
confirm this.

Two simple kinetic models of Quantum Size Effect-directed nanocluster
self-assembly in circular atomic corrals are discussed. The models correspond
to an adsorption (either a physisorption or a chemisorption) and an

respectively. Small magnitudes of a variation of the electronic local density
of states is shown to be the prime factor that impedes self-assembly in the
latter regime.

<br>
<i>Flynn Walsh, Robert O. Ritchie, Mark Asta</i>
<br>
<br>
Contrary to prior calculations, the Ni-rich ordered structures of the Cr-Ni
alloy system are found to be antiferromagnetic under semi-local
density-functional theory. The optimization of local magnetic moments
significantly increases the driving force for the formation of CrNi$_2$, the
only experimentally observed intermetallic phase. This structure's ab initio
magnetism appears well described by a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with longitudinal
spin fluctuations; itinerant Cr moments are induced only by the strength of
exchange interactions. The role of magnetism at temperature is less clear and
several scenarios are considered based on a review of experimental literature,
specifically a failure of the theory, the existence of an overlooked magnetic
phase transition, and the coupling of antiferromagnetism to chemical ordering.
Implications for related commercial and high-entropy alloys are discussed for
each case.

was introduced to estimate the temperature dependence of the electron
relaxation time. The model is applied to Ca3Ru2O7 with a focus on understanding
its electrical resistivity across the electronic phase transition at 48 K. A
quasiharmonic phonon approach to the lattice vibrations was employed to account
for thermal expansion while the Boltzmann transport theory including spin-orbit
coupling was used to calculate the electron-transport properties, including the
temperature dependence of electrical conductivity.

On the basis of the Luttinger-Ward functional for interacting many-body
systems given in terms of full Green's function $G$ and the bare interaction
vertex $\Gamma^{(0)}$, we develop a novel Legendre transformation to express
the grand thermodynamic potential $\Omega$ as a functional of $G$ and the
renormalized interaction vertex $\Gamma$ so that (i) $G$ and $\Gamma$ obey the
stationarity conditions $\delta\Omega/\delta G=0$ and $\delta\Omega
/\delta\Gamma=0$ and (ii) $\Gamma$ reduces to $\Gamma^{(0)}$ in the
weak-coupling limit. The formalism enables us to perform microscopic studies of
thermodynamic, single-particle, and two-particle properties in a unified
self-consistent conserving framework.

<br>
<br>
Solitons in liquid crystals have generated considerable interest. Several
hypotheses of varying complexity have been advanced to explain how they emerge,
and a consensus has not emerged yet about the underlying forces responsible for
their formation or their structure. In this work, we present a minimal model
for soliton structures in achiral nematic liquid crystals, which reveals the
key requirements needed to generate traveling solitons in the absence of added
charges. These include a surface imperfection or inhomogeneity capable of
producing a twist, flexoelectricity, dielectric contrast, and an applied AC
electric field that can couple to the director's orientation. Our proposed
model is based on a tensorial representation of a confined liquid crystal, and
it predicts the formation of "butterfly" structures, quadrupolar in character,
in regions of a slit channel where the director is twisted by the surface
imperfection. As the applied electric field is increased, solitons (or
"bullets") become detached from the wings of the butterfly, which then rapidly
propagate throughout the system. The main observations that emerge from the
model, including the formation and structure of butterflies, bullets, and
stripes, as well as the role of surface imperfections and the strength of the
applied field, are consistent with our own experimental findings presented here
for nematic LCs confined between two chemically treated parallel plates.

<br>
<i>Qiye Guan, Hejin Yan, Yongqing Cai</i>
<br>
<br>
As emerging atomically ultrathin metal compounds, MXenes show great promise
for catalysts and nanoelectronics applications due to the abundant surface
terminations and high metallic conductivity. However, the tendency of the
interlayer adhesion and suffering from environmental disturbances significantly
limit their endurance and efficiency. Herein via conducting first-principles
calculations, we explore surface passivation and exfoliation of MXene via
polymers which have been experimentally proven to promote the performance. Nine
kinds of monomers together with the typical MXene Ti3C2T2 (T= None, O, F, OH,
F0.5O0.5) as prototype composites are explored with respect to the adsorption
and charge transfer associated with energetics and chemical redox,
respectively. Our work shows that naked Ti3C2 MXene has a strong ability to
cleave and decompose the monomers. Surface functionalized Ti3C2F2, Ti3C2FO, and
Ti3C2O2 have a weak binding with monomers through only van der Waals force,
whereas Ti3C2(OH)2 also exhibits strengthened binding for some monomers.
Specific functional groups in the monomer, such as the halogen, sulfur, and
hydroxyl groups or a relatively planar aromatic structure, largely contribute
to the adsorption. We reveal that the functionalization through polymer would
alter the carriers' density via interfacial charge transfer in MXenes. While
the naked Ti3C2 and Ti3C2(OH)2 donate electrons to the polymers, the Ti3C2F2,
Ti3C2FO, and Ti3C2O2 receive small amounts of electrons transferred from the
polymer, highly depending on the types of the monomers. The varying ability of
charge transfer and exfoliation energy of different monomers implies great
flexibility for designing polymers to exfoliate the MXene and modulate the
carrier densities which is highly desired for altering conductivity, dielectric
properties, and promoted endurance.

Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials have extraordinary thermal

three- and four-phonon interactions is derived. The phonon anharmonicity of 2D
vdW materials, involving the Gr\"uneisen parameter, phonon lifetime, and
thermal conductivity, is summarized and derived in detail. The size-dependent
thermal conductivity of representative 2D vdW materials is discussed

Layered hexagonal Gamma--GeSe, a new polymorph of GeSe synthesized recently,
shows strikingly high electronic conductivity in its bulk form (even higher
than graphite) while semiconducting in the case of monolayer (1L). In this
work, by using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that, different
from its orthorhombic phases of GeSe, the Gamma--GeSe shows a small spatial
anisotropic dependence and a strikingly thickness-dependent behavior with
transition from semimetal (bulk, 0.04 eV) to semiconductor (1L, 0.99 eV), and
this dual conducting characteristic realized simply with thickness control in
Gamma-GeSe has not been found in other 2D materials before. The lacking of
d-orbital allows charge carrier with small effective mass (0.16 m0 for electron
and 0.23 m0 for hole) which is comparable to phosphorene. Meanwhile, 1L
Gamma--GeSe shows a superior flexibility with Young's modulus of 86.59 N/m,
only one-quarter of that of graphene and three-quarters of that of MoS2, and
Poisson's ratio of 0.26, suggesting a highly flexible lattice. Interestingly,
1L Gamma-GeSe shows an in-plane isotropic elastic modulus inherent with
hexagonal symmetry while an anisotropic in-plane effective mass owing to
shifted valleys around the band edges. We demonstrate the feasibility of strain
engineering in inducing indirect-direct and semiconductor-metal transitions
resulting from competing bands at the band edges. Our work shows that the free
1L Gamma-GeSe shows a strong light absorption (~106 cm-1) and an indirect
bandgap with rich valleys at band edges, enabling high carrier concentration
and a low rate of direct electron-hole recombination which would be promising
for nanoelectronics and solar cell applications.

<br>
<br>
Bandgap tunability of lead mixed-halide perovskites makes them promising
candidates for various applications in optoelectronics since they exhibit sharp
optical absorption onsets despite the presence of disorder from halide
alloying. Here we use localization landscape theory to reveal that the static
disorder due to compositional alloying for iodide:bromide perovskite
contributes at most 3 meV to the Urbach energy. Our modelling reveals that the
reason for this small contribution is due to the small effective masses in
perovskites, resulting in a natural length scale of around 20nm for the
"effective confining potential" for electrons and holes, with short range
potential fluctuations smoothed out. The increase in Urbach energy across the
compositional range agrees well with our optical absorption measurements. We
model systems of sizes up to 80 nm in three dimensions, allowing us to explore
halide segregation, accurately reproducing the experimentally observed
absorption spectra and demonstrating the scope of our method to model
electronic structures on large length scales. Our results suggest that we
should look beyond static contribution and focus on the dynamic temperature
dependent contribution to the Urbach energy.

Phase-sensitive measurements on a composite ring made of a superconductor of
interest connected by a known singlet $s$-wave superconductor can unambiguously
determine its pairing symmetry. In composite rings with epitaxial
$\beta-$Bi$_2$Pd and $s$-wave Nb, we have observed half-integer quantum flux
when Nb is connected to the opposite crystalline ends of $\beta-$Bi$_2$Pd and
integer-quantum flux when Nb is connected to the same crystalline ends of
$\beta-$Bi$_2$Pd. These findings provide unequivocal evidence of odd-parity
pairing state of the triplet superconductor $\beta-$Bi$_2$Pd.

<br>
<br>
The theory of bulk orbital magnetization has been formulated both in
reciprocal space based on Berry curvature and related quantities, and in real
space in terms of the spatial average of a local marker. Here we consider a
three-dimensional antiferromagnetic material having a vanishing bulk but a
nonzero surface orbital magnetization. We ask whether the surface-normal
component of the surface magnetization is well defined, and if so, how to
compute it. As the physical observable corresponding to this quantity, we
identify the macroscopic current running along a hinge shared by two facets.
However, the hinge current only constrains the difference of the surface
magnetizations on the adjoined facets, leaving a potential ambiguity. By
performing a symmetry analysis, we find that only crystals exhibiting a
pseudoscalar symmetry admit well-defined magnetizations at their surfaces. We
then explore the possibility of computing surface magnetization via a
coarse-graining procedure applied to a local marker. We show that multiple
expressions for the local marker exist, and apply constraints to filter out
potentially meaningful candidates. Using several tight-binding models as our
theoretical test bed and several potential markers, we compute surface
magnetizations for slab geometries and compare their predictions with explicit
calculations of the macroscopic hinge currents of rod geometries. We find that
only a particular form of the marker consistently predicts the correct hinge
currents.

Metal chalcogenide is a promising material for studying novel underlying
physical phenomena and nanoelectronics applications. Here, we systematically
investigate the crystal structure and electronic properties of the AlSe surface
alloy on Al (111) using scanning tunneling microscopy, angle-resolved
photoelectron spectrometer, and first-principle calculations. We reveal that
the AlSe surface alloy possesses a hexagonal closed-packed structure. The AlSe
surface alloy comprises two atomic sublayers (Se sublayer and Al sublayer) with
1.16 A along the z direction. The dispersion shows two hole-like bands for AlSe
surface alloy located at about -2.2 eV, far below the Fermi level, which is
sharply different from other metal chalcogenide and binary alloys. These two
bands mainly derive from the in-plane orbital of AlSe (px and py). These
results provide implications for related Al-chalcogen interface. Meanwhile,
AlSe alloy have an advantage of large-scale atomic flatness and a wide band gap
near the Fermi level in serving as an interface for two-dimensional materials.

Granular-fluid mixtures widely exist in nature, and with the increase of
solid fractions, their rheology behaviors are still elusive in different
conditions. The challenge in the prediction of their dynamics is due to the
unclear combined effect of fluid-solid and solid-solid interactions on the
macroscopic behaviors. In this contribution, we generalize and unify the
frictional rheologies of both dense suspensions and dry granular media using a
dimensionless number based on the ratio between physically interpretable length
scales, which covers a wide range of flow regimes and unifies the existing
theories for dry and immersed granular flows. These results support the
power-law scaling behaviors near jamming reported in recent investigations. The
findings establish a general constitutive framework for visco-inertial granular
flows and are important for a better understanding of granular-fluid mixtures
in both natural and engineering situations, and also provide a reliable method
to understand the multi-phase, multi-scale flows under complex force fields.

We investigate spin and thermal transport near the N\'{e}el transition
temperature $T_N$ in three dimensions, by numerically analyzing the classical
antiferromagnetic $XXZ$ model on the cubic lattice, where in the model, the
anisotropy of the exchange interaction $\Delta=J_z/J_x$ plays a role to control
the universality class of the transition. It is found by means of the hybrid
Monte-Carlo and spin-dynamics simulations that in the $XY$ and Heisenberg cases
of $\Delta \leq 1$, the longitudinal spin conductivity $\sigma^s_{\mu\mu}$
exhibits a divergent enhancement on cooling toward $T_N$, while not in the
Ising case of $\Delta>1$. In all the three cases, the temperature dependence of
the thermal conductivity $\kappa_{\mu\mu}$ is featureless at $T_N$, being
consistent with experimental results. The divergent enhancement of
$\sigma^s_{\mu\mu}$ toward $T_N$ is attributed to the spin-current relaxation
time which gets longer toward $T_N$, showing a power-law divergence
characteristic of critical phenomena. It is also found that in contrast to the
$XY$ case where the divergence in $\sigma^s_{\mu\mu}$ is rapidly suppressed
below $T_N$, $\sigma^s_{\mu\mu}$ likely remains divergent even below $T_N$ in
the Heisenberg case, which might experimentally be observed in the ideally
isotropic antiferromagnet RbMnF$_3$.

<h3>Repulsion of a Néel-type skyrmion from a Pearl vortex in thin  ferromagnet-superconductor heterostructures</h3>

In this paper we study repulsion of a N\'eel-type skyrmion in a chiral
ferromagnetic film from a superconducting Pearl vortex due to the stray fields.
Taking into account an effect of the vortex magnetic field on the skyrmion
non-perturbatively, we find that the repulsion between them is suppressed with
increase of the dimensionless strength of the vortex magnetic field. This
manifests itself in complicated evolution of the free energy with increase of
the vortex magnetic field and reduction of the equilibrium distance between the
centers of N\'eel-type skyrmion and Pearl vortex.

We investigate experimentally the capacitive coupling between a two-electron

that the spin qubit is an ultrasensitive and fast charge detector with the
perspective of a future single shot-detection of a single flying electron. This
work opens the route toward quantum electron optics experiments at the single

A thermoelectric device is a heat engine that directly converts heat into
electricity. Many materials with a high figure of merit ZT have been discovered
in anticipation of a high thermoelectric efficiency. However, there has been a
lack of investigations on efficiency-based material evaluation, and little is
known about the achievable limit of thermoelectric efficiency. Here, we report
the highest thermoelectric efficiency using 13,353 published materials. The
thermoelectric device efficiencies of 808,610 configurations are calculated
under various heat-source temperatures (T_h) when the cold-side temperature is
300 K, solving one-dimensional thermoelectric integral equations with
temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties. For infinite-cascade devices,
a thermoelectric efficiency larger than 33% (~1/3) is achievable when T_h
exceeds 1400 K. For single-stage devices, the best efficiency of 17.1% (~1/6)
is possible when T_h is 860 K. Leg segmentation can overcome this limit,
delivering a very high efficiency of 24% (~1/4) when T_h is 1100 K.

<h3>Microscopic study of orbital textures</h3>

Many interesting spin and orbital transport phenomena originate from orbital
textures, referring to $\vec{k}$-dependent orbital states. Most of previous
works are based on symmetry analysis to model the orbital texture and analyze
its consequences. However the microscopic origins of orbital texture and its
strength are largely unexplored. In this work, we derive the orbital texture
Hamiltonians from microscopic tight-binding models for various situations. To
form an orbital texture, $\vec{k}$-dependent hybridization of orbital states
are necessary. We reveal two microscopic mechanisms for the hybridization: (i)
lattice structure effect and (ii) mediation by other orbital states. By
considering the orbital hybridization, we not only reproduce the orbital
Hamiltonian obtained by the symmetry analysis but also reveal previously
unreported orbital textures like orbital Dresselhaus texture and anisotropic
orbital texture. The orbital Hamiltonians obtained here would be useful for
analyzing the orbital physics and designing the materials suitable for
spin-orbitronic applications. We show that our theory also provides useful
microscopic insight into physical phenomena such as the orbital Rashba effect
and the orbital Hall effect. Our formalism is so generalizable that one can
apply it to obtain effective orbital Hamiltonians for arbitrary orbitals in the
presence of periodic lattice structures.

We use a generative neural network model to create thousands of new,

one-dimensional materials from the Computational 1D Materials Database (C1DB)
database. More than 500 of the new materials are shown with density functional
theory calculations to be dynamically stable and with heats of formation within
0.2 eV of the convex hull of known materials. Some of the new materials could
also have been obtained by chemical element substitution in the training
materials, but completely new classes of materials are also produced. The band
structures, electronic densities of states, work functions, effective masses,
and phonon spectra of the new materials are calculated, and the data are added
to C1DB.

<h3>Long-range order, bosonic fluctuations, and pseudogap in strongly  correlated electron systems</h3>

This thesis deals with the Hubbard model as prototypical model to describe
the physics of electrons in the two-dimensional copper-oxide planes of
high-$T_c$ cuprates. To get approximate solutions, we employ functional
renormalization group (fRG) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) methods.
We deal with the problem of identifying bosonic fluctuations in the vertex
function, exhibiting an intricate dependence on momenta and frequencies already
at moderate coupling. In the normal, paramagnetic phase, the goal is achieved
by employing the recently introduced single-boson exchange decomposition. In
the symmetry-broken phases, we reformulate the previously introduced
combination of fRG with mean-field theory by explicitly introducing a bosonic
field.
A widely discussed and challenging problem is the emergence of a pseudogap in
the Hubbard model. In this thesis we assume this phase to be characterized by
strong magnetic fluctuations. Following previous works, we fractionalize the
electron in a chargon, carrying the electron's charge, and a charge neutral
spinon, which represents local fluctuations of the spin orientation. The
chargons undergo N\'eel or spiral magnetic order below a density-dependent
transition temperature $T^*$. We compute DC charge transport coefficients for
the chargons, and obtain a pronounced drop in the charge carrier density across
the magnetic-to-paramagnetic transition. Directional fluctuations of the spin
orientation are described by a non-linear sigma model and prevent long-range
ordering of the electrons at any finite temperature. The phase where the
chargon degrees of freedom are magnetically ordered shares many features with
the pseudogap regime observed in high-$T_c$ cuprates: a strong reduction of the
charge carrier density, a spin gap, Fermi arcs, and electronic nematicity.

The remarkable and fascinating properties of two-dimensional materials have
raised them to the rank of most promising candidates for technological
applications. In particular, the possibility of long-range ferromagnetic order
in 2D materials is generating a growing excitement. Here, we demonstrate that
flat bands (FBs) may pave the way to room temperature ferromagnetism in 2D
compounds. Indeed, the magnetic exchanges between localized spins are largely
dominated by the FB-FB contribution. This contribution is ferromagnetic and
scales linearly with the local coupling, thus leading to cross-over
temperatures (ferromagnetic phase/ paramagnetic phase) higher by an order of
magnitude than those currently reported in experiments. Cross-over temperatures
as high as $600~ K$ could be reached in micrometer-sized FB systems.

We compute the electronic properties of the normal state of uncollapsed
LaFe$_2$As$_2$, taking into account local dynamical correlations by means of
slave-spin mean-field+density-functional theory. Assuming the same local
interaction strength used to model the whole electron- and hole-doped
BaFe$_2$As$_2$ family, our calculations reproduce the experimental Sommerfeld
specific heat coefficient, which is twice the value predicted by uncorrelated
band theory. We find that LaFe$_2$As$_2$ has a reduced bare bandwidth and this
solves the apparent paradox of its sizeable correlations despite its nominal
valence d$^{6.5}$, which would imply extreme overdoping and uncorrelated
behaviour in BaFe$_2$As$_2$. Our results yield a consistent picture of the
whole 122 family and point at the importance of the correlation strength,
rather than sheer doping, in the interpretation of the phase diagram of
iron-based superconductors

Proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling in graphene has led to the observation
of intriguing phenomena like time-reversal invariant $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological
phase and spin-orbital filtering effects. An understanding of the effect of
spin-orbit coupling on the band structure of graphene is essential if these
exciting observations are to be transformed into real-world applications. In
this research article, we report the experimental determination of the band
structure of single-layer graphene (SLG) in the presence of strong
proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling. We achieve this in high-mobility
hBN-encapsulated SLG/WSe2 heterostructures through measurements of quantum
oscillations. We observe clear spin-splitting of the graphene bands along with
a substantial increase in the Fermi velocity. Using a theoretical model with
realistic parameters to fit our experimental data, we uncover evidence of a
band gap opening and band inversion in the SLG. Further, we establish that the
deviation of the low-energy band structure from pristine SLG is determined
primarily by the valley-Zeeman SOC and Rashba SOC, with the Kane-Mele SOC being
inconsequential. Despite robust theoretical predictions and observations of
band-splitting, a quantitative measure of the spin-splitting of the valence and
the conduction bands and the consequent low-energy dispersion relation in SLG
was missing -- our combined experimental and theoretical study fills this
lacuna.

Self-bound quantum droplets form when the mean-field tendency of the gas to
collapse is stabilized by the effectively repulsive beyond mean-field
fluctuations. The beyond mean-field effects depend on Rabi-frequency $\omega_R$
and quadratic Zeeman effect $q$ for the Rabi-coupled Bose mixtures and the
spinor gases, respectively. The effects of varying $\omega_R$ and $q$ on the
quantum droplet have recently been examined for unpolarized Rabi-coupled Bose
mixture with zero detuning $\delta = 0$ and unpolarized spinor gas with
$\langle F_z \rangle=0$. In this paper, we theoretically explore the stability
of the droplet phase for polarized $\delta \neq 0$ Rabi-coupled Bose mixture
and $\langle F_z \rangle \neq 0$ spinor gas. We calculate the Lee-Huang-Yang
corrections for both gases with polarized order parameters and obtain the phase
diagram of the droplets on the parameter space of $\omega_R$-$\delta$ and
$q$-$p$ for Rabi-coupled mixture and spinor gas, respectively. Finally, we
highlight the similarities and differences between the two systems and discuss
their experimental feasibility.

We demonstrate spontaneous generation of spatially-periodic supersolid-like
super-lattice and stripe solitons in Rashba spin-orbit (SO) coupled spin-1 and
spin-2 quasi-two-dimensional nonmagnetic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). The
solitons in a weakly SO-coupled spin-1 BEC are circularly-symmetric of $(-1, 0,
+1)$ and $(0, +1, +2)$ types and have inherent vorticity; the numbers in the
parentheses are the winding numbers in hyper-spin components $+1, 0, -1$,
respectively. The circularly-symmetric solitons in an SO-coupled spin-2 BEC are
of types $(-2, -1, 0, +1, +2)$ and $(-1, 0, +1, +2, +3)$ with the former being
the ground state, where the winding numbers correspond to spin components $+2,
+1, 0, -1, -2$, respectively. For stronger SO-coupling strengths, these
solitons acquire a multiring structure while preserving the winding numbers.
Quasi-degenerate stripe and super-lattice solitons, besides a
circularly-asymmetric soliton, also emerge as excited stationary states for
stronger SO-coupling strengths in spin-1 and spin-2 BECs. pla-cl.tex

<br>
<br>
When a soft glassy colloidal suspension is displaced by a Newtonian fluid in
a radial Hele-Shaw geometry, the pattern morphology that develops at the
interface is determined by the complex rheology of the former. We had reported
in an earlier work [Palak, V. R. S. Parmar, D. Saha and R. Bandyopadhyay, JCIS
Open, 6 (2022) 100047] that a range of interfacial patterns can be formed by
controlling the elasticity of the displaced suspension, the flow rate of the
displacing fluid and the interfacial tension of the fluid pair. Interestingly,
all the different morphological features can be distinguished in terms of their
areal ratios, defined as the ratio of the areas occupied by the fully-developed
pattern and the smallest circle enclosing it. In a significant advance to this
earlier work, we show here that a systematic study of spatio-temporal pattern
growth can reveal important information about pattern selection mechanisms. We
analyse the time-evolution of the patterns to reveal interesting correlations
between their growth mechanisms and fully-developed morphologies. We believe
that such systematic identification of the unique temporal features
characterising pattern growth at the interface between an aging viscoelastic
clay suspension and a Newtonian fluid can be useful in predicting and
suppressing the onset and evolution of interfacial instabilities in the
displacement of mud and cement slurries.

universal characteristics which is independent of the details of the membrane
elasticity; (i) there is a critical pressure $\Delta P_{\rm c}$ below which no
translocation occurs, (ii) $\Delta P_{\rm c}$ decreases to zero as the vesicle
radius $R_0$ approaches the hole radius $a$, satisfying the scaling relation
$\Delta P_{\rm c} \sim (R_0 - a)^{3/2}$, and (iii) the translocation time
$\tau$ diverges as $\Delta P$ decreases to $\Delta P_{\rm c}$, satisfying the
scaling relation $\tau \sim (\Delta P -\Delta P_{\rm c})^{-1/2}$.

We present the investigations on atomic dynamics and Li+ diffusion in
crystalline and amorphous Li2Si2O5 using quasielastic (QENS) and inelastic
neutron scattering (INS) studies supplemented by ab-initio molecular dynamics
simulations (AIMD). The QENS measurements in the amorphous phase of Li2Si2O5
show a narrow temperature window (700 < T < 775 K), exhibiting significant
quasielastic broadening corresponding to the fast Li+ diffusion and relaxation
of SiO4 units to the crystalline phase. Our INS measurements clearly show the
presence of large phonon density of states (PDOS) at low energy (low-E) in the
superionic amorphous phase, which disappear in the non-superionic crystalline
phase, corroborating the role of low-E modes in Li+ diffusion. The frustrated
energy landscape and host flexibility (due to random orientation and
vibrational motion of SiO4 polyhedral units) play an essential role in
diffusing the Li+. We used AIMD simulations to identify that these low-E modes
involve a large amplitude of Li vibrations coupled with SiO4 vibrations in the
amorphous phase. At elevated temperatures, these vibrational dynamics
accelerate the Li+ diffusion via a paddle-wheel like coupling mechanism. Above
775 K, these SiO4 vibrational dynamics drive the system into the crystalline
phase by locking SiO4 and Li+ into deeper minima of the free energy landscape
and disappear in the crystalline phase. Both experiments and simulations
provide valuable information about the atomic level stochastic and vibrational
dynamics in Li2Si2O5 and their role in Li+ diffusion and vitrification.

Magnetic diffuse scattering -- the broad magnetic scattering features
observed in neutron-diffraction data above a material's magnetic ordering
temperature -- provides a rich source of information about the material's
magnetic Hamiltonian. However, this information has often remained
under-utilised due to a lack of available computer software that can fit values
of magnetic interaction parameters to such data. Here, an open-source computer
program, Spinteract, is presented, which enables straightforward refinement of
magnetic interaction parameters to powder and single-crystal magnetic diffuse
scattering data. The theory and implementation of this approach are summarised.
Examples are presented of refinements to published experimental
diffuse-scattering data sets for the canonical antiferromagnet MnO and the
highly-frustrated classical spin liquid Gd3Ga5O12. Guidelines for data
collection and refinement are outlined, and possible developments of the
approach are discussed.

Ferroelectric materials hold great potential for alternative memories and
computing, but several challenges need to be overcome before bringing the ideas
to applications. In this context, the recently discovered link between electric
polarization and spin textures in some classes of ferroelectrics expands the
perspectives of the design of devices that could simultaneously benefit from
ferroelectric and spintronic properties. Here, we explore the concept of
non-volatile ferroelectric control of charge-to-spin conversion in semimetallic
WTe$_2$, which may provide a way for non-destructive read-out of the polar
state. Based on the first-principles simulations, we show that the
Rashba-Edelstein effect (REE) that converts electric currents into spin
accumulation switches its sign upon the reversal of the electric polarization.
The numerical values of REE, calculated for the first time for both bulk and
bilayer WTe$_2$, demonstrate that the conversion is sizable, and may remain
large even at room temperature. The ferroelectric control of spin transport in
non-magnetic materials provides functionalities similar to multiferroics and
allows the design of memories or logic-in-memory devices that combine
ferroelectric writing of information at low power with the spin-orbit read-out
of state.

We solve two problems related to the fluctuations of time-integrated
functionals of Markov diffusions, used in physics to model nonequilibrium
systems. In the first we derive and illustrate the appropriate boundary
conditions on the spectral problem used to obtain the large deviations of
current-type observables for reflected diffusions. For the second problem we
study linear diffusions and obtain exact results for the generating function
associated with linear additive, quadratic additive and linear current-type
observables by using the Feynman-Kac formula. We investigate the long-time
behavior of the generating function for each of these observables to determine
both the so-called rate function and the form of the effective process
responsible for manifesting the fluctuations of the associated observable. It
is found that for each of these observables, the effective process is again a
linear diffusion. We apply our general results for a variety of linear
diffusions in $\mathbb{R}^2$, with particular emphasis on investigating the
manner in which the density and current of the original process are modified in
order to create fluctuations.

<h3>A Master Equation for Power Laws</h3>

<br>
<i>Sabin Roman, Francesco Bertolotti</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a new mechanism for generating power laws. Starting from a random
walk, we first outline a simple derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation. By
analogy, starting from a certain Markov chain, we derive a master equation for
power laws that describes how the number of cascades changes over time
(cascades are consecutive transitions that end when the initial state is
reached). The partial differential equation has a closed form solution which
gives an explicit dependence of the number of cascades on their size and on
time. Furthermore, the power law solution has a natural cut-off, a feature
often seen in empirical data. This is due to the finite size a cascade can have
in a finite time horizon. The derivation of the equation provides a
justification for an exponent equal to 2, which agrees well with several
empirical distributions, including Richardson's law on the size and frequency
of deadly conflicts. Nevertheless, the equation can be solved for any exponent
value. In addition, we propose an urn model where the number of consecutive
ball extractions follows a power law. In all cases, the power law is manifest
over the entire range of cascade sizes, as shown through log-log plots in the
frequency and rank distributions.

Among the many far-reaching consequences of the potential existence of a
magnetic monopole, it induces topological zero modes in the Dirac equation,
which were derived by Jackiw and Rebbi 46 years ago and have been elusive ever
since. Here, we show that the monopole and multi-monopole solutions can be
constructed in the band theory by coupling the three-dimensional Dirac points
in hedgehog spatial configurations through Dirac-mass engineering. We then
experimentally demonstrate such a monopole bound state in a
structurally-modulated acoustic crystal as a cavity device. These monopole
resonators not only support an arbitrary number of degenerate mid-gap modes,

is inversely proportional to the cubic root of the modal volume. Our work
completes the kink-vortex-monopole trilogy of zero modes and provides the
largest free spectral range for sizable resonators.

<h3>The "pure-shear" fracture test for viscoelastic elastomers and its  revelation on Griffith fracture</h3>

Strikingly, "pure-shear" fracture tests have repeatedly shown that fracture
nucleation in (common hydrocarbon and other types of) viscoelastic elastomers
occurs at a critical stretch that is independent of the stretch rate at which
the test is carried out. In this Letter, we demonstrate that this remarkable --
yet overlooked -- experimental finding implies that the Griffith criticality
condition that governs nucleation of fracture from large pre-existing cracks in
viscoelastic elastomers can be written in fact as an expression not in terms of
an elusive loading-history-dependent critical tearing energy Tc, as ordinarily
done, but as one exclusively in terms of the intrinsic fracture energy Gc of
the elastomer.

We study spin-fluctuation mediated divergent superconducting fluctuations in
a Luttinger liquid proximity-coupled to a spin chain. Our study provides
insight into how spin-fluctuations can induce superconductivity in a strongly
correlated non-Fermi liquid with repulsive electronic interactions only. The
electrons in the system are governed by the Extended Hubbard Hamiltonian and
are coupled to a chain of localized spins modeled by the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
$XX$ Hamiltonian. Using a multi-channel Luttinger liquid approach, we determine
the phase diagram of the metal chain. We find that spin-polarized triplet
superconducting correlations persist for repulsive electronic interactions for
sufficiently large interchain couplings.

U-10Zr-based metallic nuclear fuel is a promising fuel candidate for
next-generation sodium-cooled fast reactors.The research experience of the
Idaho National Laboratory for this type of fuel dates back to the 1960s. Idaho
National Laboratory researchers have accumulated a considerable amount of
experience and knowledge regarding fuel performance at the engineering scale.
The limitation of advanced characterization and lack of proper data analysis
tools prevented a mechanistic understanding of fuel microstructure evolution
and properties degradation during irradiation. This paper proposed a new
workflow, coupled with domain knowledge obtained by advanced post-irradiation
examination methods, to provide unprecedented and quantified insights into the
fission gas bubbles and pores, and lanthanide distribution in an annular fuel
irradiated in the Advanced Test Reactor. In the study, researchers identify and
confirm that the Zr-bearing secondary phases exist and generate the
quantitative ratios of seven microstructures along the thermal gradient.
Moreover, the distributions of fission gas bubbles on two samples of U-10Zr
advanced fuels were quantitatively compared. Conclusive findings were obtained
and allowed for evaluation of the lanthanide transportation through connected
bubbles based on approximately 67,000 fission gas bubbles of the two advanced
samples.

<h3>Atomic cluster expansion for quantum-accurate large-scale simulations of  carbon</h3>

We present an atomic cluster expansion (ACE) for carbon that improves over
available classical and machine learning potentials. The ACE is parameterized
from an exhaustive set of important carbon structures at extended volume and
energy range, computed using density functional theory (DFT). %Dispersion
corrections are explicitly added to properly account for long-ranged van der
Waals interactions. Rigorous validation reveals that ACE predicts accurately a
broad range of properties of both crystalline and amorphous carbon phases while
being several orders of magnitude more computationally efficient than available
machine learning models. We demonstrate the predictive power of ACE on three
distinct applications, brittle crack propagation in diamond, evolution of
amorphous carbon structures at different densities and quench rates and
nucleation and growth of fullerene clusters under high pressure and temperature
conditions.

<h3>Non-equilibrium Ising Model on a 2D Additive Small-World Network</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09174" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09174</a>
<br>
<i>R. A. Dumer, M. Godoy</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we have studied the Ising model with one- and two-spin flip
competing dynamics on a two-dimensional additive small-world network (A-SWN).
The system model consists of a $L\times L$ square lattice where each site of
the lattice is occupied by a spin variable that interacts with the nearest
neighbor spins and it has a certain probability $p$ of being additionally
connected at random to one of its farther neighbors. The dynamics present in
the system can be defined by the probability $q$ of being in contact with a
heat bath at a given temperature $T$ and, at the same time, with a probability
of $1-q$ the system is subjected to an external flux of energy into the system.
The contact with the heat bath is simulated by one-spin flip according to the
Metropolis prescription, while the input of energy is mimicked by the two-spin
flip process, involving a simultaneous flipping of a pair of neighboring spins.
We have employed Monte Carlo simulations to obtain the thermodynamic quantities
of the system, such as, the total $\textrm{m}_{\textrm{L}}^{\textrm{F}}$ and
staggered $\textrm{m}_{\textrm{L}}^{\textrm{AF}}$ magnetizations per spin, the
susceptibility $\chi_{\textrm{L}}$, and the reduced fourth-order Binder
cumulant $\textrm{U}_{\textrm{L}}$. We have built the phase diagram for the
stationary states of the model in the plane $T$ versus $q$, showing the
existence of two continuous transition lines for each value of $p$: one line
between the ferromagnetic $F$ and paramagnetic $P$ phases, and the other line
between the $P$ and antiferromagnetic $AF$ phases. Therefore, we have shown
that the phase diagram topology changes when $p$ increases. Using the
finite-size scaling analysis, we also obtained the critical exponents for the
system, where varying the parameter $p$, we have observed a different
universality class from the Ising model in the regular square lattice to the
A-SWN.

<h3>Chebyshev pseudosite matrix product state approach for the spectral  functions of electron-phonon coupling systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09208" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09208</a>
<br>
<i>Pei-Yuan Zhao, Ke Ding, Shuo Yang</i>
<br>
<br>
The electron-phonon ($e$-ph) coupling systems usually have large phonon
degrees of freedom, whose spectral functions are numerically difficult to
compute using matrix product state (MPS) formalisms. For the first time, we
propose a simple and practical method that combines the Chebyshev MPS and the
pseudosite density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm. The Chebyshev
vector is represented by a pseudosite MPS with global $U(1)$ fermion symmetry,
mapping $2^{N_p}$ bosonic degrees of freedom to $N_p$ pseudosites, each with
two states. This approach can handle arbitrary $e$-ph coupling Hamiltonians
where pseudosite DMRG performs efficiently. We employ this method to
investigate the spectral functions of the doped extended Hubbard-Holstein
model, concentrating on a rarely studied strong Coulomb repulsion regime. We
show that even weak extended electron-phonon couplings have non-negligible
effects on spectral functions. With this method, key features of the excitation
spectra for the extended Hubbard-Holstein model are captured at a modest
computational cost.

<h3>Ultrafast laser-driven topological spin textures on a 2D magnet</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09210" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09210</a>

Ultrafast laser excitations provide an efficient and low-power consumption
alternative since different magnetic properties and topological spin states can
be triggered and manipulated at the femtosecond (fs) regime. However, it is
largely unknown whether laser excitations already used in data information
platforms can manipulate the magnetic properties of recently discovered
two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials. Here we show that
ultrashort laser pulses (30$-$85 fs) can not only manipulate magnetic domains
of 2D-XY CrCl$_3$ ferromagnets, but also induce the formation and control of
topological nontrivial meron and antimeron spin textures. We observed that
these spin quasiparticles are created within $\sim$100 ps after the excitation
displaying rich dynamics through motion, collision and annihilation with
emission of spin waves throughout the surface. Our findings highlight
substantial opportunities of using photonic driving forces for the exploration
of spin textures on 2D magnetic materials towards magneto-optical topological
applications.

<i>Yury S. Krivosenko, Ivan V. Iorsh, Ivan A. Shelykh</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a quantitative microscopic analysis of the formation of
exciton-polaritons, the composite particles possessing light and material
components, polariton-polariton interactions, and resonant pumping dynamics in
cylindrical semiconductor micropillars. We discuss how the redistribution
effect can be used in devices generating photons with non zero orbital angular
momenta.
