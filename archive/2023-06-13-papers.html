<h3>Strongly-Correlated Electron-Photon Systems</h3>

An important goal of modern condensed matter physics involves the search for
states of matter with new emergent properties and desirable functionalities.
Although the tools for material design remain relatively limited, notable
advances have been recently achieved by controlling interactions at
hetero-interfaces, precise alignment of low-dimensional materials and the use
of extreme pressures . Here, we highlight a new paradigm, based on controlling
light-matter interactions, which provides a new way to manipulate and
synthesize strongly correlated quantum matter. We consider the case in which
both electron-electron and electron-photon interactions are strong and give
rise to a variety of novel phenomena. Photon-mediated superconductivity,
cavity-fractional quantum Hall physics and optically driven topological
phenomena in low dimensions are amongst the frontiers discussed in this
perspective, which puts a spotlight on a new field that we term here
"strongly-correlated electron-photon science."

<h3>Locally controlled arrested thermalization</h3>

The long-time dynamics of quantum systems, typically, but not always, results
in a thermal steady state. The microscopic processes that lead to or circumvent
this fate are of interest, since everyday experience tells us that not all
spatial regions of a system heat up or cool down uniformly. This motivates the
question: under what conditions can one slow down or completely arrest
thermalization locally? Is it possible to construct realistic Hamiltonians and
initial states such that a local region is effectively insulated from the rest,
or acts like a barrier between two or more regions? We answer this in the
affirmative by outlining the conditions that govern the flow of energy and
entropy between subsystems. Using these ideas we provide a representative
example for how simple few-body states can be used to engineer a ``thermal
switch" between interacting regions.

<h3>Exact Solution for the Transverse Field Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Spin  Glass Model with Continuous-Time Quantum Monte Carlo Method</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07337" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07337</a>

<br>
We construct the first complete exact numerical solution of a mean field
quantum spin glass model, the transverse field Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model,
by implementing a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method in the presence of
full replica symmetry breaking. We extract the full numerically exact phase
diagram, displaying a glassy phase with continuous replica symmetry breaking at
small transverse fields and low temperatures. A paramagnetic phase emerges once
thermal and quantum fluctuations melt the spin glass. We characterize both
phases by extracting the order parameter, as well as the static and dynamical
local spin susceptibilities. The static susceptibility shows a plateau in the
glassy phase, but remains smooth across the phase boundary, while the shape of
dynamical susceptibility varies upon crossing the glass transition by reducing
quantum fluctuations. We qualitatively compare these results to a.c.
susceptibility measurements on dipole-coupled Ising magnets in a transverse
magnetic field. Our work provides a general framework for the exact numerical
solution of mean field quantum glass models, constituting an important step
towards understanding glassiness in realistic systems.

<h3>Conformal invariance and multifractality at Anderson transitions in  arbitrary dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07340" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07340</a>

Electronic wave functions at Anderson transitions exhibit multifractal
scaling characterized by a continuum of generalized multifractal exponents
$\Delta_\gamma$ with vector indices $\gamma = (q_1,\ldots,q_n)$. In a field
theory description of the transitions, there are corresponding multifractal
operators $\mathcal{O}_\gamma$ with scaling dimensions $\Delta_\gamma$.
Assuming conformal invariance and using the conformal bootstrap framework, we
derive a constraint that implies that the generalized multifractal spectrum
$\Delta_\gamma$ must be quadratic in all $q_i$ in any dimension $d > 2$. As
several numerical studies have shown deviations from parabolicity, we argue
that conformal invariance is likely absent at Anderson transitions in
dimensions $d > 2$.

<h3>Quantum geometry of singlet superconductors</h3>

We elaborate that $s$-wave and $d$-wave superconductors described by mean
field theories possess a nontrivial quantum geometry. From the overlap of two
quasihole states at slightly different momenta, one can define a quantum metric
that measures the distance in the curved momentum space. The
momentum-integration of the quantum metric represents an average distance that
we call the fidelity number, which may be further expressed as a fidelity
marker defined locally on every lattice site. For $s$-wave superconductors, we
unveil that the quantum metric generally influences the electromagnetic
responses at finite wave length, such as the infrared absorption and
paramagnetic current. In addition, the dielectric response is directly
proportional to the fidelity number, which is found to be determined by the
coherence length and suppressed by disorder. For $d$-wave superconductors, we
demonstrate the singular behavior of the quantum metric near the nodal points,
and a metric-curvature correspondence between the azimuthal quantum metric and
the non-Abelian Berry connection that integrates to a topological charge of the
nodal points.

Artificial spin ice (ASI) are nanomagnetic metamaterials with a wide range of
emergent properties. ASI systems have recently shown promise as substrates for
novel computing devices. A precondition for computation is the ability to
control how the artificial spins change their state over time. Detailed control
of the state evolution in ASI systems has proven difficult. Here, we introduce
astroid clocking, a global field protocol that carefully exploits the intrinsic
switching astroids of the nanomagnets to selectively address spins within the
ASI. The resulting clocked dynamics is characterized by discrete, gradual
evolution of spin states. We demonstrate, both experimentally and in
simulations, how astroid clocking of pinwheel ASI allows ferromagnetic domains
to be gradually grown or reversed at will. More complex dynamics arise when the
clock protocol allows both growth and reversal to occur within the same clock
cycle. Astroid clocking offers unprecedented control of ASI dynamics in both
time and space, and enables new directions in ASI research and beyond.

<h3>Field-induced bound-state condensation and spin-nematic phase in  SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ revealed by neutron scattering up to 25.9 T</h3>

Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) underpins exotic forms of order ranging from
superconductivity to superfluid 4 He. In quantum magnetic materials, ordered
phases induced by an applied magnetic field can be described as the BEC of
magnon excitations. With sufficiently strong magnetic frustration, exemplified
by the system SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ , no clear magnon BEC is observed and the
complex spectrum of multi-magnon bound states may allow a different type of
condensation, but the high fields required to probe this physics have remained
a barrier to detailed investigation. Here we exploit the first purpose-built
high-field neutron scattering facility to measure the spin excitations of
SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ up to 25.9 T and use cylinder matrix-product-states (MPS)
calculations to reproduce the experimental spectra with high accuracy. Multiple
unconventional features point to a condensation of $S = 2$ bound states into a
spin-nematic phase, including the gradients of the one-magnon branches, the
presence of many novel composite two- and three-triplon excitations and the
persistence of a one-magnon spin gap. This gap reflects a direct analogy with
superconductivity, suggesting that the spin-nematic phase in
SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ is best understood as a condensate of bosonic Cooper
pairs. Our results underline the wealth of unconventional states yet to be
found in frustrated quantum magnetic materials under extreme conditions.

<h3>Binary nanocrystalline alloys with strong glass forming interfacial  regions: Complexion stability, segregation competition, and diffusion  pathways</h3>

Stabilization of grain structure is important for nanocrystalline alloys, and
grain boundary segregation is a common approach to restrict coarsening. Doping
can alter grain boundary structure, with high temperature states such as
amorphous complexions being particularly promising for stabilization. Dopant
enrichment at grain boundaries may also result in precipitate formation, giving
rise to dopant partitioning between these two types of features. The present
study elucidates the effect of dopant choice on the retention of amorphous
complexions and the stabilization of grain size due to various forms of
interfacial segregation in three binary nanocrystalline Al-rich systems, Al-Mg,
Al-Ni, and Al-Y as investigated in detail using transmission electron
microscopy. Amorphous complexions were retained in Al-Y even for very slow
cooling conditions, suggesting that Y is the most efficient complexion
stabilizer. Moreover, this system exhibited the highest number density of
nanorod precipitates, reinforcing a recently observed correlation between
amorphous complexions and grain boundary precipitation events. The dopant
concentration at the grain boundaries in Al-Y is lower than in the other two
systems, although enrichment compared to the matrix is similar, while secondary
segregation to nanorod precipitate edges is much stronger in Al-Y than in Al-Mg
and Al-Ni. Y is generally observed to be an efficient doping additive, as it
stabilizes amorphous features and nanorod precipitates, and leaves very few
atoms trapped in the matrix. As a result, all grains in Al-Y remained nanosized
whereas abnormal grain growth occurred in the Al-Mg and Al-Ni alloys. The
present study demonstrates nanocrystalline stability via simple alloy
formulations and fewer dopant elements, which further encourage the usage of
bulk nanostructured materials.

<h3>Frustrated multipoles in an icosahedral quasicrystal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07434" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07434</a>

Multipolar degrees of freedom and their hidden orders have been widely
discussed in the context of heavy fermions, frustrated magnets and exotic Kondo
effects. Although there has been extensive search for multipolar degrees of
freedom in magnetic systems, there are few examples that allow pure multipolar
degrees of freedom, such as electric quadrupoles or magnetic octupoles, in the
absence of magnetic dipoles. In this work, for the first time, we theoretically
show that the magnetic behavior in an icosahedral quasicrystal is generally
described by the pure magnetic octupoles in the absence of magnetic dipoles,
resulting from the interplay of spin orbit coupling and crystal field
splitting. Importantly, we point out that the non-crystallographic symmetries
lead to pure multipolar degrees of freedom, which are only allowed in
quasicrystals but forbidden in periodic crystals, and are thus a unique feature
of magnetic quasicrystals. We show that Yb$^{3+}$ with $J=7/2$ admits the
doublet, which only has magnetic octupolar degrees of freedom without magnetic
dipoles and quadrupoles. We first discuss the characteristics of magnetic
ocutupoles and derive the effective spin Hamiltonian on symmetry grounds. Then,
based on the self-similar triangular structure of the icosahedron, we argue the
long-range frustration in terms of the Ising spin model. We further classify
the possible quantum phases including quantum fluctuations, in terms of the
entanglement of the ground state. It turns out that an arbitrary small quantum
fluctuation produces entanglement, by lifting the extensive degeneracy
originated from the geometrical frustration. Our study offers the magnetic
icosahedral quasicrystal as a new platform to search for the novel multipolar
degrees of freedom and their exotic phenomena.

<h3>High-temperature Majorana corner modes in a $d+id'$ superconductor  heterostructure: Application to twisted bilayer cuprate superconductors</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The realization of Majorana corner modes generally requires unconventional
superconducting pairing or $s$-wave pairing. However, the bulk nodes in
unconventional superconductors and the low $T_c$ of $s$-wave superconductors
are not conducive to the experimental observation of Majorana corner modes.
Here we show the emergence of a Majorana corner mode at each corner of a
two-dimensional topological insulator in proximity to a $d+id'$ pairing
superconductor, such as heavily doped graphene or especially a twisted bilayer
of a cuprate superconductor, e.g., Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$, which
has recently been proposed as a fully gapped chiral $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$
superconductor with $T_c$ close to its native 90 K, and an in-plane magnetic
field. By numerical calculation and intuitive edge theory, we find that the
interplay of the proximity-induced pairing and Zeeman field can introduce
opposite Dirac masses on adjacent edges of the topological insulator, which
creates one zero-energy Majorana mode at each corner. Our scheme offers a
feasible route to achieve and explore Majorana corner modes in a
high-temperature platform without bulk superconductor nodes.

<h3>First-Principle Validation of Fourier's Law: One-Dimensional Classical  Inertial Heisenberg Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07481" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07481</a>

The thermal conductance of a one-dimensional classical inertial Heisenberg
model of linear size $L$ is computed, considering the first and last particles
in thermal contact with heat baths at higher and lower temperatures, $T_{h}$
and $T_{l}$ ($T_{h}>T_{l}$), respectively. These particles at extremities of
the chain are subjected to standard Langevin dynamics, whereas all remaining
rotators ($i=2, \cdots , L-1$) interact by means of nearest-neighbor
ferromagnetic couplings and evolve in time following their own equations of
motion, being investigated numerically through molecular-dynamics numerical
simulations. Fourier's law for the heat flux is verified numerically with the
thermal conductivity becoming independent of the lattice size in the limit $L
\to \infty$, scaling with the temperature as $\kappa(T) \sim T^{-2.25}$, where
$T=(T_{h}+T_{l})/2$. Moreover, the thermal conductance,
$\sigma(L,T)=\kappa(T)/L$, is well-fitted by a function, typical of
nonextensive statistical mechanics, according to $\sigma(L,T)=A \exp_{q}(-B
x^{\eta})$, where $A$ and $B$ are constants, $x=L^{0.475}T$, $q=2.28 \pm 0.04$,
and $\eta=2.88 \pm 0.04$.

<h3>Backscattering-free edge states below all bands in two-dimensional  auxetic media</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07493" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07493</a>
<br>
<i>Wenting Cheng, Kai Qian, Nan Cheng, Nicholas Boechler, Xiaoming Mao, Kai Sun</i>
<br>
<br>
Unidirectional and backscattering-free propagation of sound waves is of
fundamental interest in physics, and highly sought-after in engineering.
Current strategies utilize topologically protected chiral edge modes in
bandgaps, or complex mechanisms involving active constituents or nonlinearity.
Here we propose a new class of passive, linear, one-way edge states based on
spin-momentum locking of Rayleigh waves in two-dimensional media in the limit
of vanishing bulk modulus, which provides $100\%$ unidirectional and
backscattering-free edge propagation at a broad range of frequencies instead of
residing in gaps between bulk bands. We further show that such modes are
characterized by a new topological winding number that is analogous to discrete
angular momentum eigenvalues in quantum mechanics. These passive and
backscattering-free edge waves have the potential to enable a new class of
phononic devices in the form of lattices or continua that work in previously
inaccessible frequency ranges.

<h3>Impact of coil-globule DNA transition in motile droplets of aqueous  two-phase systems</h3>

<br>
<br>
Aqueous droplets generated by liquid-liquid phase separation of polymer
mixtures have attracted much attention as the simplest cellular model. However,
there are no reports that the conformation of biopolymers changes their
distribution within the droplets and, moreover, the droplet motility as in
cells. In this study, we use mixtures of polyethylene glycol (PEG), dextran,
and DNA, and present motile dextran droplets that exhibit variable patterns and
motile speeds depending on the conformation of coexisting DNA. The driving
force of the motile droplet is the Marangoni convection caused by the
concentration gradient of PEG across the droplet. Within this mechanism,
globule DNA is transported towards the droplet's rear via Marangoni convection
along the droplet surface, while coil DNA is displaced from the droplet's
central axis in the direction of motion through shear banding. This asymmetric
DNA distribution relative to the motile direction potentially facilitates the
transition of the droplet's motion from neutral to puller swimmers. DNA motile
droplets are observed to align in the same direction, which is also reproduced
by numerical simulation assuming they are puller swimmers. Furthermore,
droplets containing coil DNA have the lowest moving velocity compared to other
droplets, which can be quantitatively explained by the dynamic viscosity of
droplets under convection. These findings should contribute to the
understanding of motile polymer droplets, whose motions are coupled to changes
in the conformation and spatial distribution of the polymer, and their various
applications, such as biomedical capsules and soft micro-robotics.

<h3>Graphene-Enhanced Single Ion Detectors for Deterministic Near-Surface  Dopant Implantation in Diamond</h3>

Colour centre ensembles in diamond have been the subject of intensive
investigation for many applications including single photon sources for quantum
communication, quantum computation with optical inputs and outputs, and
magnetic field sensing down to the nanoscale. Some of these applications are
realised with a single centre or randomly distributed ensembles in chips, but
the most demanding application for a large-scale quantum computer will require
ordered arrays. By configuring an electronic-grade diamond substrate with a
biased surface graphene electrode connected to charge-sensitive electronics, it
is possible to demonstrate deterministic single ion implantation for ions
stopping between 30 and 130~nm deep from a typical stochastic ion source. An
implantation event is signalled by a charge pulse induced by the drift of
electron-hole pairs from the ion implantation. The ion implantation site is
localised with an AFM nanostencil or a focused ion beam. This allows the
construction of ordered arrays of single atoms with associated colour centres
that paves the way for the fabrication of deterministic colour center networks
in a monolithic device.

<h3>Quantum Stochastic Molecular Dynamics Simulations of the Viscosity of  Superfluid Helium</h3>

<i>Phil Attard</i>
<br>
<br>
Decoherent quantum equations of motion are derived that yield the trajectory
of an open quantum system. The viscosity of superfluid Lennard-Jones helium-4
is obtained with a quantum stochastic molecular dynamics algorithm. The
momentum state occupancy entropy is counted with a continuous representation of
boson number and averages are obtained with umbrella sampling. Instantaneous
snapshots of the Bose-Einstein condensed system show multiple highly occupied
momentum states. The viscosity is obtained from the Onsager-Green-Kubo relation
with the time correlation function modified in the quantum case. On the
saturation curve, at higher temperatures the viscosities of the classical and
quantum liquids are equal. With decreasing temperature the viscosity of the
classical liquid increases whereas that of the quantum liquid decreases. Below
the $\lambda$-transition the viscosity lies significantly below the classical
value, being small but positive due to the mixture of condensed and uncondensed
bosons. The computed trajectories give a physical explanation of the molecular
mechanism for superfluidity.

<br>
<br>
Substituting heteroatoms and non-benzenoid carbons into nanographene
structure offers an unique opportunity for atomic engineering of electronic
properties. Here we show the bottom-up synthesis of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs)
with embedded fused BN-doped rubicene components on a Au(111) surface using
on-surface chemistry. Structural and electronic properties of the BN-GNRs are
characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force
microscopy (AFM) with CO-terminated tips supported by numerical calculations.
The periodic incorporation of BN heteroatoms in the GNR leads to an increase of
the electronic band gap as compared to its undoped counterpart. This opens
avenues for the rational design of semiconducting GNRs with optoelectronic
properties.

<br>
<br>
While most neuromorphic systems are based on nanoscale electronic devices,
nature relies on ions for energy-efficient information processing. Therefore,
finding memristive nanofluidic devices is a milestone toward realizing
electrolytic computers mimicking the brain down to its basic principles of
operations. Here, we present a nanofluidic device designed for circuit scale
in-memory processing that combines single-digit nanometric confinement and
large entrance asymmetry. Our fabrication process is scalable while the device
operates at the second timescale with a twenty-fold conductance ratio. It
displays a switching threshold due to the dynamics of an extended space charge.
The combination of these features permits assembling logic circuits composed of
two interactive nanofluidic devices and an ohmic resistor. These results open
the way to design multi-component ionic machinery, such as nanofluidic neural
networks, and implementing brain-inspired ionic computations.

<h3>Revisiting the statistical estimation of activation parameters in  incipient plasticity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07630" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07630</a>
<br>
<i>Sweta Kumari, Amlan Dutta</i>
<br>
<br>
Incipient plasticity is typically associated with thermally activated events
like the nucleation of dislocations in crystalline solids and the activation of
shear transformation zones in metallic glasses. A method of estimating the
activation parameters of such mechanisms is to analyze the statistical
distribution of critical loads obtained through a series of repeated
measurements. However, this approach has been observed to produce activation
volumes of the order of atomic volumes in a variety of materials and
experimental setups. Such exceptionally small activation volumes have been
explained by conjecturing a non-trivial mechanism of nucleation. Here, we
critically analyze the inherent assumptions of the statistical method and show
that unexpected activation volumes can emerge simply from the statistical
fluctuations in the activation parameters themselves. To this end, we perform
repeated deformation simulations of iron nanopillars under both tensile and
compressive loading and measure the resulting yield stresses. Although the
conventional statistical analysis exhibits extremely small atomic volumes, the
atomistic simulations indicate a transition pathway that is physically
incommensurate with the statistical result. Using a simple Monte Carlo scheme
and analytical consideration, we show that even a relatively small dispersion
in activation parameters can misleadingly suppress the measured activation
volume to a significant extent. This shows that the ultra-small atomic volumes
reported in the earlier studies do not need exotic mechanisms but can be
explained simply as the misleading result obtained by ignoring the physically
plausible reality of statistical dispersion of activation parameters.

<h3>Unitary transformations within density matrix embedding approaches: A  novel perspective on the self-consistent scheme for electronic structure  calculation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07641" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07641</a>
<br>
<i>Quentin Marécat, Benjamin Lasorne, Emmanuel Fromager, Matthieu Saubanère</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we introduce an original self-consistent scheme based on the
one-body reduced density matrix ($\gamma$) formalism. A significant feature of
this methodology is the utilization of an optimal unitary transformation of the
Hamiltonian, determined through a self-consistently determined, unitary
reflection $\mathbf{R}[\gamma]$. This enables the extraction of all reduced
properties of the system from a smaller, accurately solved embedding cluster,
and to systematically reconstruct the reduced density matrix of the system.
This process ensures that both extended and embedded systems satisfy the local
virial-like relation, providing quantitative insight into the correspondence
between the fragment in the extended system and its embedded analogue. The
performance and convergence of the method, as well as the N-representability of
the resulting correlated density matrix, are evaluated and discussed within the
context of the one-dimensional Hubbard model, which provides exact results for
a comprehensive comparison.

antiferromagnet. Photoluminescence measurements in the near-infrared spectral
range show that the intriguing 1.475 eV-excitation unique to the NiPS3
antiferromagnetic phase splits upon the application of the in-plane magnetic
field. The observed splitting patterns are correlated with properties of magnon
excitations and reproduced with the simple model proposed. Possible routes
toward a firm identification of the spin-entangled 1.475 eV-optical excitation
in NiPS3, which can hardly be recognized as a coherent Zhang-Rice exciton, are

<h3>Statistical field theory of mechanical stresses in Coulomb fluids:  beyond mean-field theory</h3>

<br>
In this paper, we introduce a statistical field theory that describes the
macroscopic forces in inhomogeneous Coulomb fluids. Our approach employs a
general covariant methodology, in conjunction with a functional Legendre
transformation method, to calculate the stress tensor for Coulomb fluids. This
tensor encompasses the mean-field stress tensor and the fluctuation corrections
derived through the one-loop approximation. The correction for fluctuations
includes a term that accounts for the thermal fluctuations of the local
electrostatic potential and field in the vicinity of the mean-field
configuration. This correlation stress tensor determines how electrostatic
correlation affects the local stresses in a non-uniform Coulomb fluid. We would
like to emphasize that our general approach is applicable not only to Coulomb
fluids, but also to nonionic simple or complex fluids, for which the
field-theoretic Hamiltonian is known as a functional of the relevant scalar
order parameters.

The formation of a topological superconducting phase in a quantum-dot-based
Kitaev chain requires nearest neighbor crossed Andreev reflection and elastic
co-tunneling. Here we report on a hybrid InSb nanowire in a three-site Kitaev
chain geometry - the smallest system with well-defined bulk and edge - where
two superconductor-semiconductor hybrids separate three quantum dots. We
demonstrate pairwise crossed Andreev reflection and elastic co-tunneling
between both pairs of neighboring dots and show sequential tunneling processes
involving all three quantum dots. These results are the next step towards the
realization of topological superconductivity in long Kitaev chain devices with
many coupled quantum dots.

Understanding the transport of particles immersed in a carrier fluid (bedload
transport) is still an exciting challenge. Among the different types of
gas-solid flows, when the dynamics of solid particles is essentially dominated
by collisions between them, kinetic theory can be considered as a reliable tool
to derive continuum approaches from a fundamental point of view. In a recent
paper, Chassagne et al. [J. Fluid Mech. 964, A27, (2023)] have proposed a
two-fluid model based on modifications to a classical kinetic theory model.
First, in contrast to the classical model, the model proposed by Chassagne et
al. (2023) takes into account the interparticle friction not only in the radial
distribution function but also through an effective restitution coefficient in
the rate of dissipation term of granular temperature. As a second modification,
at the top of the bed where the volume fraction is quite small, the model
accounts for the saltation regime in the continuum framework. The theoretical
results derived from the model agree with discrete simulations for moderate and
high densities and they are also consistent with experiments. Thus, the model
proposed by Chassagne et al. (2023) helps to a better understanding on the
combined impact of friction and inelasticity on the macroscopic properties of
granular flows.

This paper presents the results of an extensive structural search of ternary
solids containing lutetium, nitrogen and hydrogen. Based on thousands of
thermodynamically stable structures, available online, the convex hull of the
formation enthalpies is constructed. To obtain the correct energetic ordering,
the highly accurate RSCAN DFT functional is used in high quality all-electron
calculations. In this way possible pseudopotential errors are eliminated. A
novel lutetium hydride structure (HLu$_2$) that is on the convex hull is found
in our search. An electron phonon analysis however shows that it is not a
candidate structure for near ambient superconductivity. Besides this structure,
which appears to have been missed in previous searches, possibly due to
different DFT methodologies, our results agree closely with the results of
previously published structure search efforts. This shows, that the field of
crystal structure prediction has matured to a state where independent
methodologies produce consistent and reproducible results, underlining the
trustworthiness of modern crystal structure predictions. Hence it is quite
unlikely that a structure, that would give rise within standard BCS theory to
the superconducting properties, claimed to have been observed by
Dasenbrock-Gammon et al. 10.1038/s41586-023-05742-0 , exists. This solidifies
the evidence that no structure with conventional superconducting properties
exists that could explain the experimental observation made by
Dasenbrock-Gammon et al. 10.1038/s41586-023-05742-0

Zintl phases are excellent thermoelectric prospects to put the waste heat to
good use. In the quest of the same, using first-principles methods combined
with Boltzmann transport theory, we explored two recent phases NaSrSb and
NaBaSb. We found low lattice thermal conductivity of 1.9 and 1.3 W m$^{-1}$
K$^{-1}$ at 300~K for NaSrSb and NaBaSb, respectively, which are of the same
order as other potential Zintl phases such as Sr$_3$AlSb$_3$ and BaCuSb. We
account for such low values to short phonon lifetimes, small phonon group
velocities, and lattice anharmonicity in the crystal structure. The calculated
electrical transport parameters based on acoustic deformation potential,
ionized impurity, and polar optical phonon scattering mechanisms reveal large
Seebeck coefficients for both materials. Further, we obtain a high figure of
merit of ZT$\sim$2.0 at 900~K for \textit{n}-type NaSrSb. On the other hand,
the figure of merit of \textit{n}-type NaBaSb surpasses the unity. We are
optimistic about our findings and believe our work would set a basis for future
experimental investigations.

We explicitly show that the differences, with respect to the appearance of
topological phases, between the traditional Haldane model, which utilises a
honeycomb lattice structure, to that of the Haldane model imbued onto a
brick-wall lattice geometry, are inconsequential. A proposal is then put
forward to realise the Haldane model by exploiting the internal degrees of
freedom of atoms as a synthetic dimension. This leads to a convenient platform
for the investigation of chiral edge states due to the hard boundaries provided
by the hyperfine manifold. We make some cursory comments on the effects of
interactions in the system.

<br>
The emergence of the solid state in glass-forming materials upon cooling is
accompanied by changes in both thermodynamic and viscoelastic properties and by
a precipitous drop in fluidity. Here, we investigate changes in basic elastic
properties upon cooling in a family of simulated polymer fluids, as
characterized by a number of stiffness measures. We show that $\tau_{\alpha}$
can be expressed quantitatively both in terms of measures of the material
``stiffness'', $G_p$ and $\langle u^2 \rangle$, and the extent $L$ of
cooperative particle exchange motion in the form of strings, establishing a
direct relation between the growth of emergent elasticity and collective
motion. Moreover, the macroscopic stiffness parameters, $G_p$, $B$, and $f_{s,
q^*}$, can all be expressed quantitatively in terms of the molecular scale
stiffness parameter, $k_{\mathrm{B}}T / \langle u^2 \rangle$ with
$k_{\mathrm{B}}$ being Boltzmann's constant, and we discuss the thermodynamic
scaling of these properties. We also find that $G_p$ is related to the cohesive
energy density $\Pi_{\mathrm{CED}}$, pointing to the critical importance of
attractive interactions in the elasticity and dynamics of glass-forming
liquids. Finally, we discuss fluctuations in the local stiffness parameter as a
quantitative measure of elastic heterogeneity and their significance for
understanding both the linear and nonlinear elastic properties of glassy
materials.

<h3>The effect of screening on the relaxation dynamics in the Coulomb glass</h3>

This paper examines the relaxation dynamics of a two-dimensional Coulomb
glass lattice model with high disorders. The study aims to investigate the
effects of disorder and Coulomb interactions on glassy dynamics by computing
the eigenvalue distribution of the linear dynamical matrix using mean-field
approximations. The findings highlight the significance of the single-particle
density of states (DOS) as the main controlling parameter affecting the
relaxation at intermediate and long times. For the model with unscreened
Coulomb interactions, our results indicate that the depletion of the DOS near
the Fermi level leads to logarithmic decay at intermediate times. As the
relaxation progresses to longer times, a power-law decay emerges, with the
exponent approaching zero as the disorder strength increases, suggesting the
manifestation of logarithmic decay at high disorders. The effects of screening
of interactions on the dynamics are also studied at various screening and
disorder strengths. The findings reveal that screening leads to the filling of
the gap in the density of states, causing deviation from logarithmic decay at
intermediate disorders. Moreover, in the strong disorder regime, the relaxation
dynamics are dominated by disorder, and even with screened Coulomb
interactions, the electronic relaxation remains similar to the unscreened case.
The time at which crossover to exponential decay occurs increases with
increasing disorder and interaction strength.

Heterostacks formed by combining two-dimensional materials show novel
properties which are of great interest for new applications in electronics,
photonics and even twistronics, the new emerging field born after the
outstanding discoveries on twisted graphene. Here, we report the direct growth
of tin nanosheets at the two-dimensional limit via molecular beam epitaxy on
chemical vapor deposited graphene on Al2O3(0001). The mutual interaction
between the tin nanosheets and graphene is evidenced by structural and chemical
investigations. On the one hand, Raman spectroscopy indicates that graphene
undergoes compressive strain after the tin growth, while no charge transfer is
observed. On the other hand, chemical analysis shows that tin nanosheets
interaction with sapphire is mediated by graphene avoiding the tin oxidation
occurring in the direct growth on this substrate. Remarkably, optical
measurements show that the absorption of tin nanosheets show a graphene-like
behavior with a strong absorption in the ultraviolet photon energy range,
therein resulting in a different optical response compared to tin nanosheets on
bare sapphire. The optical properties of tin nanosheets therefore represent an
open and flexible playground for the absorption of light in a broad range of
the electromagnetic spectrum and technologically relevant applications for
photon harvesting and sensors.

The transport of energy and information in semiconductors is limited by
scattering between electronic carriers and lattice phonons, resulting in
diffusive and lossy transport that curtails all semiconductor technologies.
Using Re6Se8Cl2, a van der Waals (vdW) superatomic semiconductor, we
demonstrate the formation of acoustic exciton-polarons, an electronic
quasiparticle shielded from phonon scattering. We directly image polaron
transport in Re6Se8Cl2 at room temperature and reveal quasi-ballistic, wavelike
propagation sustained for nanoseconds and several microns. Shielded polaron
transport leads to electronic energy propagation orders of magnitude greater
than in other vdW semiconductors, exceeding even silicon over nanoseconds. We
propose that, counterintuitively, quasi-flat electronic bands and strong
exciton-acoustic phonon coupling are together responsible for the remarkable
transport properties of Re6Se8Cl2, establishing a new path to ballistic
room-temperature semiconductors.

The magnetism of the kagome-based Weyl semi-metal \ce{Mn3Sn} is explored
using neutron and X-ray scattering. A co-planar anti-chiral ${\textbf
k}={\textbf 0}$ magnetic order develops below $T_{\mathrm{N}}$~=~445~K, with an
ordered moment of 2.1(1)$\mu_{B}$/Mn and a correlation length exceeding 350~nm
at $T=300$~K. For $T<T_{\rm inc}=285$~K, this structure is replaced by an
incommensurate non-coplanar structure composed of a transverse polarized
helimagnet with wave vector $\textbf{k}_{\chi}=k_\chi{\bf \hat{c}}$ and a
longitudinally polarized spin density wave with $\textbf{k}_{\beta}=k_\beta
{\bf \hat{c}}$. Very interestingly, charge density waves with wave vectors
$2\textbf{k}_\beta, 2\textbf{k}_\chi$, and $\textbf{k}_\beta+\textbf{k}_\chi$
accompany the magnetic order. While $k_\beta(T)$ and $k_\chi(T)$ vary
differently with temperature, their trajectories intersect and lock for 200
K$<T<240$~K. For $T<100$~K, $k_\beta=0.08446(1)c^*\approx \frac{1}{12}c^{*}$
while $k_\chi=0.1039(4)c^*\approx\frac{5}{48}c^{*}$ for $T<25$~K. The $\bf
Q$-dependence of inelastic neutron scattering for $\hbar\omega <10$~meV
reflects $k_\beta \approx k_\chi$ for all $T<300$~K. While a single
$\Gamma-$point mode at $\Delta=4.5$~meV is observed in the commensurate phase,
there are modes at
$\Delta_{1}=5.0(5)~\mathrm{meV},\Delta_{2}=7.0(5)~\mathrm{meV}$, and
$\Delta_{3}=8.5(5)~\mathrm{meV}$ in the lower symmetry modulated phase.

Protein dynamics is a fundamental element to comprehend their biological
functions. However, a theoretical picture providing microscopic-detail
explanation of its relevant features is still missing. One of the outmost
relevant properties exhibited by this dynamic is its subdiffusivity, whose
origins are still unknown. Here, by directly comparing all-atom molecular
dynamics simulations and theory we show that this behavior mainly arises from
the fractal nature of the network of metastable state of conformational state
over which protein dynamics, thought as diffusion process, takes place. This
process is assumed to be Markovian by the employed theoretical picture.
Therefore, to further support its validity, we built a simple Markov state
model starting from the simulations outcome and show that it exhibits a
subdiffusive behavior, in quantitative agreement with the one associated to the
molecular dynamics. Moreover, Molecular dynamics gives direct access to
relevant quantities which allowed us to rule out the possibility the Continuous
Time Random Walk can explain the protein subdiffusivity.

We consider a continuous-time random walk model with finite-mean
waiting-times and we study the mean first-passage time (MFPT) as estimated by
an observer in a reference frame $\mathcal{S}$, that is co-moving with a
target, and by an observer in a reference frame $\mathcal{S}'$, that is in
uniform motion with respect to the target through a Galilean transformation. We
found that the simple picture emerging in $\mathcal{S}$, where the mean
first-passage time depends on the whole jump distribution but only on the mean
value of the waiting-times, does indeed not hold in $\mathcal{S}'$ where the
estimation depends on the whole jump distribution and also on the whole
distribution of the waiting-times. We derive the class of jump-size
distributions such that the dependence of the MFPT on the mean waiting-time
only is conserved also in $\mathcal{S}'$. However, if the MFPT is finite, the
dependence on the specific waiting-time distribution disappears in
$\mathcal{S}'$ when the initial position is sufficiently far-away from the
target. While the MFPT emerges to be Galilean invariant with both two-sided and
one-sided jump distributions with finite moments, the MFPT is not a Galilean
invariant for one-sided jump distribution with power-law tails (one-sided
L\'evy distributions).

Combinatorial mechanical metamaterials feature spatially textured soft modes
that yield exotic and useful mechanical properties. While a single soft mode
often can be rationally designed by following a set of tiling rules for the
building blocks of the metamaterial, it is an open question what design rules
are required to realize multiple soft modes. Multimodal metamaterials would
allow for advanced mechanical functionalities that can be selected on-the-fly.
Here we introduce a transfer matrix-like framework to design multiple soft
modes in combinatorial metamaterials composed of aperiodic tilings of building
blocks. We use this framework to derive rules for multimodal designs for a
specific family of building blocks. We show that such designs require a large
number of degeneracies between constraints, and find precise rules on the real
space configuration that allow such degeneracies. These rules are significantly
more complex than the simple tiling rules that emerge for single-mode
metamaterials. For the specific example studied here, they can be expressed as
local rules for tiles composed of pairs of building blocks in combination with
a non-local rule in the form of a global constraint on the type of tiles that
are allowed to appear together anywhere in the configuration. This non-local
rule is exclusive to multimodal metamaterials and exemplifies the complexity of
rational design of multimode metamaterials. Our framework is a first step
towards a systematic design strategy of multimodal metamaterials with spatially
textured soft modes.

<h3>Effective bi-layer model Hamiltonian and density-matrix renormalization  group study for the high-Tc superconductivity in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$  under high pressure</h3>

<br>
<br>
High-Tc superconductivity has been reported in the single crystal of
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure. Based on the electronic structure given
from the density functional theory calculations, we propose an effective
bi-layer model Hamiltonian including both $3d_{z^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital
electrons of the nickel cations. The main feature of the model is that the
$3d_{z^2}$ electrons form inter-layer $\sigma$-bonding and anti-bonding bands
via the apical oxygen anions between the two layers, while the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$
electrons hybridize with the $3d_{z^2}$ electrons within each NiO$_2$ plane.
The chemical potential difference of these two orbital electrons ensures that
the $3d_{z^2}$ orbitals are close to half-filling and the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$
orbitals is near quarter-filling. The strong on-site Hubbard repulsion of the
$3d_{z^2}$ orbital electrons gives rise to an effective inter-layer
antiferromagnetic spin super-exchange $J$. Applying pressure can increase the
local coupling strength $J$ and self-dope holes on the $3d_{z^2}$ orbitals as
the same amount of electrons doped on the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals
correspondingly. By performing numerical density-matrix renormalization group
calculations on a plaqutte ladder, we find that the charge densities of both
orbitals always have uniform distributions. But a spin-density-wave and a
spin-orbital density-wave are developed in the small $J$ limit. In the large
$J$ limit, both the spin and spin-orbital density waves get suppressed, and the
electron pairing instability emerges due to the formation of inter-layer
singlets of the $3d_{z^2}$ electrons. The strongest pairing correlation is
given by the superconducting pair-density wave on the intra-layer vertical
$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ bonds. Our numerical results have provided useful insights in
the high-Tc superconductivity in single crystal La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high
pressure.

Moir\'e superlattices formed by vertically stacking van der Waals layers host
a rich variety of correlated electronic phases and function as novel photonic
materials. The moir\'e potential of the superlattice, however, is fixed by the
interlayer coupling of the stacked functional layers (e.g. graphene) and
dependent on carrier types (e.g. electrons or holes) and valleys (e.g. {\Gamma}
vs. K). In contrast, twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers are predicted
to impose a periodic electrostatic potential that may be used to engineer the
properties of an adjacent functional thin layer. Here, we show that this
potential is described by a simple theory of electric polarization originating
from the interfacial charge redistribution, validated by its dependence on
supercell sizes and distance from the twisted interfaces. We demonstrate that
the potential depth and profile can be further controlled by assembling a
double moir\'e structure. When the twist angles are similar at the two
interfaces, the potential is deepened by adding the potential from the two
twisted interfaces, reaching ~ 400 meV. When the twist angles are dissimilar at
the two interfaces, multi-level polarization states are observed. As an example
of controlling a functional layer, we demonstrate how the electrostatic
potential from a twisted hBN substrate impedes exciton diffusion in a
semiconductor monolayer. These findings suggest exciting opportunities for
engineering properties of an adjacent functional layer using the surface
potential of a twisted hBN substrate.

It is well established that when multivalent counterions or salts are added
to a solution of highly-charged polyelectrolytes (PEs), correlation effects can
cause charge inversion of the PE, leading to electrophoretic mobility (EM)
reversal. In this work, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to
unravel the less understood effect of coion valency on EM reversal for rigid
DNA-like PEs. We find that EM reversal induced by multivalent counterions is
suppressed with increasing coion valency in the salt added and eventually
vanishes. Further, we find that EM is enhanced at fixed low salt concentrations
for salts with monovalent counterions when multivalent coions with increasing
valency are introduced. However, increasing the salt concentration causes a
crossover that leads to EM reversal which is enhanced by increasing coion
valency at high salt concentration. Remarkably, this multivalent coion-induced
EM reversal persists even for low values of PE linear charge densities where
multivalent counterions alone cannot induce EM reversal. These results
facilitate tuning PE-PE interactions and self-assembly with both coion and
counterion valencies.

Anomalous transport in low dimensional spin chains is an intriguing topic
that can offer key insights into the interplay of integrability and symmetry in
many-body dynamics. Recent studies have shown that spin-spin correlations in
spin chains, where integrability is either perfectly preserved or broken by
symmetry-preserving interactions, fall in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)
universality class. Similarly, energy transport can show ballistic or
diffusive-like behaviour. Although such behaviour has been studied under
equilibrium conditions, no results on nonequilibrium spin transport in
classical spin chains has been reported so far. In this work, we investigate
both spin and energy transport in classical spin chains (integrable and
non-integrable) when coupled to two reservoirs at two different
temperatures/magnetization. In both the integrable case and
broken-integrability (but spin-symmetry preserving), we report anomalous
scaling of spin current with system size ($\mathbb{J}^s \propto L^{-\mu}$) with
an exponent, $\mu \approx 2/3$, falling under the KPZ universality class. On
the other hand, it is noteworthy that energy current remains ballistic
($\mathbb{J}^e \propto L^{-\eta}$ with $\eta \approx 0$) in the purely
integrable case and there is departure from ballistic behaviour ($\eta > 0$)
when integrability is broken regardless of spin-symmetry. Under nonequilibrium
conditions, we have thoroughly investigated spatial profiles of local
magnetization and energy. We find interesting nonlinear spatial profiles which
are hallmarks of anomalous transport. We also unravel subtle striking
differences between the equilibrium and nonequilibrium steady state through the
lens of spatial spin-spin correlations.

$R$V$_6$Sn$_6$ compounds. Magnetization measurements on our single crystals of
(Sc,Lu)V$_6$Sn$_6$ and (Sc,Y)V$_6$Sn$_6$ establish that the CDW is suppressed
by substitution of Sc by larger Lu or Y. Single crystal x-ray diffraction
reveals that compressible Sn-Sn bonds accommodate the larger rare earth atoms
within loosely packed $R$-Sn-Sn chains without significantly expanding the
lattice. We propose that Sc provides the extra room in these chains crucial to
CDW formation in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$. Our rattling chain model explains why both
physical pressure and substitution by larger rare earths hinder CDW formation
despite opposite impacts on lattice size. We emphasize the cooperative effect
of pressure and rare earth size by demonstrating that pressure further
suppresses the CDW in a Lu-doped ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ crystal. Our model not only
addresses why a CDW only forms in the $R$V$_6$Sn$_6$ materials with tiny Sc, it
also advances to our understanding of why unusual CDWs form in the kagome
metals.

The ultrafast manipulation of quantum material has led to many novel and
significant discoveries. Among them, the light-induced transient
superconductivity in cuprates achieved by melting competing stripe orders
represents a highly appealing accomplishment. However, recent investigations
have shown that the notion of photoinduced superconductivity remains a topic of
controversy, and its elucidation solely through c-axis time-resolved terahertz
spectroscopy remains an arduous task. Here, we measure the in-plane and
out-of-plane transient terahertz responses simultaneously in a stripe-ordered
non-superconducting La$_{1.875}$Ba$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$ after near-infrared
excitations. We find that although a pump-induced reflectivity edge appears in
the c-axis reflectance spectrum, the in-plane scattering rate of quasiparticles
is transiently enhanced without any signature of the formation of
superconducting condensate within the CuO$_2$ planes. Therefore, we conclude
the out-of-plane transient responses cannot be explained by an equivalent of
Josephson tunneling. Our results provide a critical evidence that transient
superconductivity cannot be induced by melting the competing stripe orders with
pump pulses whose photon energy is much higher than the superconducting gap of
cuprates.

The interplay of quantum spin liquids with itinerant conduction electrons is
of crucial interest for understanding layered structures composed of frustrated
magnet and metal monolayers. Using parton-mean-field theory, we here
demonstrate that a type-II heavy Fermi liquid, which is characterized by a
vortex lattice in the slave boson condensate, can occur in the vicinity of the
quantum phase transition separating fractionalized and heavy Fermi liquid
phases. The magnetic flux threading each such vortex is about $ v_f/ 137 c$
times smaller than the magnetic flux threading vortices in type-II
superconductors, where $v_f$ is the speed of magnetic excitations and $c$ the
speed of light. This makes a magnetic observation of this effect challenging.
We propose scanning tunneling spectroscopy instead and investigate its
signatures. If a type-II heavy Fermi liquid is cooled into a type-II
superconductor, vortices in the slave boson condensate and in the
superconducting condensate mutually attract. We argue that the type-II heavy
Fermi liquid thereby provides a compelling explanation for the magnetic memory
observed recently [Persky \textit{et al.}, Nature \textbf{609}, 692 (2022)] in
thermal cycles of 4Hb-TaS$_2$.

The ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals (WSM), such as Co3Sn2S2, are
three-dimensional topological states of matter possessing pairs of Weyl points
characterized by the opposite chiralities.We model ferromagnetic WSM by a time
reversal symmetry(TRS) broken and inversion symmetry protected Bloch
Hamiltonian involving index specifying the chirality of the Weyl points, energy
parameter determining the shift of the Weyl nodes, terms capturing the
tunnelling effect, exchange field in order to take care of the
ferromagnetic(FM) order, and the angle formed by the spin moments and the axis
perpendicular to the plane of the system. For the FM order along this axis, the
bands of opposite chirality almost linearly cross each other (with band
inversion) at Weyl points above and below the Fermi level. The in-plane spin
order, however, lacks the presence of the Weyl nodes at some points in the
Brillouin zone. We also show that, under certain conditions, the incidence of
the circularly polarized optical field (CPOF) leads to the emergence of Weyl
semimetals from Dirac semimetals due to broken time-reversal symmetry.

We study a minimal model involving two species of particles interacting via
quorum-sensing rules. Combining simulations of the microscopic model and linear
stability analysis of the associated coarse-grained field theory, we identify a
mechanism for dynamical pattern formation that does not rely on the standard
route of intra-species effective attractive interactions. Instead, our results
reveal a highly dynamical phase of chasing bands induced only by the combined
effects of self-propulsion and nonreciprocity in the inter-species couplings.
Turning on self-attraction, we find that the system may phase separate into a
macroscopic domain of such chaotic chasing bands coexisting with a dilute gas.
We show that the chaotic dynamics of bands at the interfaces of this
phase-separated phase results in anomalously slow coarsening.

We use graph theory simulations and single molecule experiments to
investigate percolation properties of kinetoplasts, the topologically linked
mitochondrial DNA from trypanosome parasites. The edges of some kinetoplast
networks contain a fiber of redundantly catenated DNA loops, but previous
investigations of kinetoplast topology did not take this into account. Our
graph simulations track the size of connected components in lattices as nodes
are removed, analogous to the removal of minicircles from kinetoplasts. We find
that when the edge loop is taken into account, the largest component after the
network de-percolates is a remnant of the edge loop, before it undergoes a
second percolation transition and breaks apart. This implies that
stochastically removing minicircles from kinetoplast DNA would isolate large
polycatenanes, which is observed in experiments that use photonicking to
stochastically destroy kinetoplasts from Crithidia fasciculata. Our results
imply kinetoplasts may be used as a source of linear polycatenanes for future
experiments.

<h3>Long-range super-Planckian heat transfer between nanoemitters in a  resonant cavity</h3>

We study radiative heat transfer between two nanoemitters placed inside
different types of closed cavities by means of a fluctuational-electrodynamics
approach. We highlight a very sharp dependence of this transfer on cavity
width, and connect this to the matching between the material-induced resonance
and the resonant modes of the cavity. In resonant configurations, this allows
for an energy-flux amplification of several orders of magnitude with respect to
the one exchanged between two emitters in vacuum as well as between two
black-bodies, even at separation distances much larger than the thermal
wavelength. On the other hand, variations of the cavity width by a few percent
allow a reduction of the flux by several orders of magnitude and even a
transition to inhibition compared to the vacuum scenario. Our results pave the
way to the design of thermal waveguides for the long-distance transport of
super-Planckian heat flux and selective heat-transfer in many-body system.

Recently, superconductivity with a $T_c$ of 78 K has been reported in bulk
samples of the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at pressures above 14 GPa.
Important theoretical tasks are the formulation of relevant low-energy models
and the clarification of the normal state properties. Here, we study the
correlated electronic structure of the high-pressure phase in a four-orbital
low-energy subspace using different many-body approaches: $GW$, dynamical mean
field theory (DMFT), extended DMFT (EDMFT) and $GW$+EDMFT, with realistic
frequency-dependent interaction parameters. The nonlocal correlation and
screening effects captured by $GW$+EDMFT result in charge ordering and a single
active $3d_{z^2}$ orbital per unit cell. We also comment on the potential
relevance of the rare-earth self-doping pocket.

Spin-based devices have attracted attention as an alternative to CMOS-based
technology. However, one of the challenges in spintronics devices is reducing
the spin-switching energy in ferromagnetic (FM) materials. To address this, we
considered ferroelectric (FE) materials, which may affect the magnetic
properties of FM materials. We explored various oxide perovskites ABO$_3$ as FE
materials, onto which a Fe monolayer was placed as the FM material. We
evaluated the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of the Fe monolayer while
varying the polarization of ABO$_3$. Our analysis showed that the MAE depends
on the magnetic dipole moment induced in the FE material at the interface
between the FE and FM materials due to structural modifications. Machine
learning techniques were also employed to identify universal behaviors of the
MAE in the presence of FE layers, confirming the importance of magnetic moments
near the interface in explaining the dependence of the MAE on FE materials.

<h3>Building Entanglement Entropy out of Correlation Functions for  Interacting Fermions</h3>

We provide a prescription to construct R\'{e}nyi and von Neumann entropy of a
system of interacting fermions from a knowledge of its correlation functions.
We show that R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy of interacting fermions in
arbitrary dimensions can be represented by a Schwinger Keldysh free energy on
replicated manifolds with a current between the replicas. The current is local
in real space and is present only in the subsystem which is not integrated out.
This allows us to construct a diagrammatic representation of entanglement
entropy in terms of connected correlators in the standard field theory with no
replicas. This construction is agnostic to how the correlators are calculated,
and one can use calculated, simulated or measured values of the correlators in
this formula. Using this diagrammatic representation, one can decompose
entanglement into contributions which depend on the one-particle correlator,
two particle correlator and so on. We provide analytic formula for the
one-particle contribution and a diagrammatic construction for higher order
contributions. We show how this construction can be extended for von-Neumann
entropy through analytic continuation. For a practical implementation of a
quantum state, where one usually has information only about few-particle
correlators, this provides an approximate way of calculating entanglement
commensurate with the limited knowledge about the underlying quantum state.
