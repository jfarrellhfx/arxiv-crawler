<h3>Homotopic classification of band structures: Stable, fragile, delicate,  and stable representation-protected topology</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13713" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13713</a>

<i>Piet W. Brouwer, Vatsal Dwivedi</i>

<br>
The topological classification of gapped band structures depends on the
particular definition of topological equivalence. For translation-invariant
systems, stable equivalence is defined by a lack of restrictions on the numbers
of occupied and unoccupied bands, while imposing restrictions on one or both
leads to ``fragile'' and ``delicate'' topology, respectively. In this article,
we describe a homotopic classification of band structures -- which captures the
topology beyond the stable equivalence -- in the presence of additional lattice
symmetries. As examples, we present complete homotopic classifications for
spinless band structures with twofold rotation, fourfold rotation and fourfold
dihedral symmetries, both in presence and absence of time-reversal symmetry.
Whereas the rules of delicate and fragile topology do not admit a bulk-boundary
correspondence, we identify a version of stable topology, which restricts the
representations of bands, but not their numbers, which does allow for anomalous
states at symmetry-preserving boundaries, which are associated with nontrivial
bulk topology.

<h3>Constraints on a split superconducting transition under uniaxial strain  in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ from scanning SQUID microscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13737" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13737</a>

<br>
<br>
More than two decades after the discovery of superconductivity in
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, it is still unclear whether the order parameter has a single
component or two degenerate components. For any two-component scenario,
application of uniaxial strain is expected to lift the degeneracy, generating
two distinct phase transitions. The presence of a second (lower-temperature)
transition may be observable by probes that are sensitive to changes in the
London penetration depth, $\lambda$, as a function of temperature, $T$. Here,
we use scanning SQUID microscopy combined with a uniaxial strain device to test
for a second transition under strain. We only observe a single transition.
Within the temperature range where a second transition has been suggested by
$\mu$SR measurements, we further place a tight upper bound of less than 1% on
the change in the zero temperature superfluid density
$n_s\propto\lambda^{-2}(0)$ due to a second transition, suggesting that such a
transition does not occur. These results constrain theories of the order
parameter in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$.

<h3>Coherent X-ray Spectroscopy Elucidates Nanoscale Dynamics of  Plasma-Enhanced Thin-Film Growth</h3>

Sophisticated thin film growth techniques increasingly rely on the addition
of a plasma component to open or widen a processing window, particularly at low
temperatures. However, the addition of the plasma into the growth environment
also complicates the surface dynamical evolution. Taking advantage of continued
increases in accelerator-based X-ray source brilliance, this real-time study
uses X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) to elucidate the nanoscale
surface dynamics during Plasma-Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition (PE-ALD) of an
epitaxial indium nitride film. XPCS examines the evolution of the coherent
X-ray scattering speckle pattern, which is a fingerprint of the unique sample
microstructure at each moment in time. In PE-ALD, ultrathin films are
synthesized from repeated cycles of alternating self-limited surface reactions
induced by temporally-separated pulses of material precursor and plasma
reactant, allowing the influence of each on the evolving morphology to be
examined. During the heteroepitaxial 3D growth examined here, sudden changes in
surface structure during initial film growth, consistent with numerous
overlapping stress-relief events, are observed. When the film becomes
continuous, the nanoscale surface morphology abruptly becomes long-lived with
correlation time spanning the period of the experiment. Throughout the growth
experiment, there is a consistent repeating pattern of correlations associated
with the cyclic growth process, which is modeled as transitions between
different surface states. The plasma exposure does not simply freeze in a
structure that is then built upon in subsequent cycles, but rather there is
considerable surface evolution during all phases of the growth cycle.

<h3>The solid phase of He-4: A Monte Carlo simulation study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13848" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13848</a>
<br>
<i>Massimo Boninsegni</i>
<br>
<br>
The thermodynamics of solid (hcp) He-4 is studied theoretically by means of
unbiased Monte Carlo simulations at finite temperature, in a wide range of
density. This study complements and extends previous theoretical work, mainly
by obtaining results at significantly lower temperatures (down to 60 mK) and
for systems of greater size, by including in full the effect of quantum
statistics, and by comparing estimates yielded by different pair potentials.
All the main thermodynamic properties of the crystal, e.g., the kinetic energy
per atom, are predicted to be essentially independent of temperature below 1 K.
Quantum-mechanical exchanges are virtually non-existent in this system, even at
the lowest temperature considered. However, effects of quantum statistics are
detectable in the momentum distribution. Comparison with available measurements
shows general agreement within the experimental uncertainties.

<h3>Multiple magnetoplasmon polaritons of magneto-optical graphene in  near-field radiative heat transfer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13860" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13860</a>

<br>
<br>
Graphene, as a two-dimensional magneto-optical material, supports
magnetoplasmon polaritons (MPP) when exposed to an applied magnetic field.
Recently, MPP of a single-layer graphene has shown an excellent capability in
the modulation of near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT). In this study, we
present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of NFRHT between two multilayered
graphene structures, with a particular focus on the multiple MPP effect. We
reveal the physical mechanism and evolution law of the multiple MPP, and we
demonstrate that the multiple MPP allow one to mediate, enhance, and tune the
NFRHT by appropriately engineering the properties of graphene, the number of
graphene sheets, the intensity of magnetic fields, as well as the geometric
structure of systems. We show that the multiple MPP have a quite significant
distinction relative to the single MPP or multiple surface plasmon polaritons
(SPPs) in terms of modulating and manipulating NFRHT.

<h3>Breakdown of $J_{eff}$ = 0 and $J_{eff}$ = 3/2 states and existence of  large magnetic anisotropy energy in vacancy ordered 5$d$ antifluorites:  K$_2$ReCl$_6$, K$_2$OsCl$_6$, and K$_2$IrCl$_6$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13876" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13876</a>
<br>
<i>Amit Chauhan, B. R. K. Nanda</i>
<br>
<br>
Vacancy-ordered antifluorite materials (A$_2$BX$_6$) are garnering renewed
attention as novel magnetic states driven by spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can be
realized in them. In this work, by pursuing density functional theory
calculations and model studies, we analyze the ground state electronic and
magnetic structure of face-centered cubic (fcc) antifluorites K$_2$ReCl$_6$
(KReC, 5$d^3$), K$_2$OsCl$_6$ (KOsC, 5$d^4$), and K$_2$IrCl$_6$ (KIrC, 5$d^5$).
We find that KReC stabilizes in the high-spin $S$ = 3/2 state instead of the
expected pseudo-spin $J_{eff}$ = 3/2 state. The former occurs due to large
exchange-splitting as compared to the SOC strength. On the contrary, the KOsC
stabilizes in broken $J_{eff}$ = 0 ($S$ = 1) simple Mott insulating state while
KIrC stabilizes in $J_{eff}$ = 1/2 spin-orbit-assisted Mott insulating state.
The presence of an isolated metal-chloride octahedron makes these antifluorites
weakly coupled magnetic systems with the nearest and next-nearest-neighbor
spin-exchange parameters ($J_1$ and $J_2$) are of the order of 1 meV. For KReC
and KOsC, the $J_1$ and $J_2$ are estimated to be antiferromagnetic and
ferromagnetic, which leads to a Type-I antiferromagnetic ground state, whereas
for KIrC, both $J_1$ and $J_2$ are antiferromagnetic, hence, it stabilizes with
a Type-III antiferromagnetic state. Interestingly, in their equilibrium
structure, these antifluorites possess large magnetic anisotropy energy (0.6-4
meV/transition metal), which is at least one-to-two orders higher than
traditional MAE materials like transition metals and multilayers formed out of
them. Moreover, with epitaxial tensile/compressive strain, the MAE enhances by
one order, becoming giant for KOsC (20-40 meV/Os).

<h3>Exploration of strongly correlated states in SmB6 through a comparison  of its two-coil pick-up response to that of Bi2Se3</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13901" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13901</a>
<br>
<i>Sayantan Ghosh, Sugata Paul, Amit Jash, Zachary Fisk, S. S. Banerjee</i>
<br>
<br>
Earlier studies on the Kondo insulator SmB6 reveal the presence of a bulk
Kondo insulating gap between 30 - 50 K, and the emergence of a conducting
surface state only below 4 K. Here, we compare the two-coil mutual inductance
pick-up response of SmB6 single crystal with that of a conventional topological
insulator (TI), Bi2Se3 single crystal. From these studies we identify three
distinct temperature regimes for SmB6, viz., (i) T >= T*(~ 66 K), (ii) (40 K~)
T_g <= T < T*, and (iii) T < T_g. At T* in SmB6, we observe a peak in the
temperature-dependent AC pickup signal which corresponds to the peak in the
broad hump feature in the bulk DC susceptibility measurements and features in
the resistivity measurements. A dip in the pickup signal at T_g in SmB6
correlates with the evidence for the opening of a bulk Kondo gap in transport
measurements. Our study of the pickup signal in SmB6 suggests the presence of a
thin (submicron order thickness) high conducting surface layer from a
temperature just below T_g. In this T regime in SmB6, the pickup signal shows a
distinct square root frequency (f) dependence compared to the linear f
dependence found in Bi2Se3. Across all the different T regimes, distinct AC
frequency dependence and scaling properties are observed. Our results suggest
that above T*, weak exchange interactions cause electrons to scatter from
random ion sites. Electronic correlations gradually strengthen with the onset
of Kondo like hybridization, setting in from below T*, and at T_g, a strongly
correlated Kondo gap opens up in the bulk of the material. The appearance of
the thin high conducting surface layer is nearly coincident with the onset of
bulk Kondo insulating state below T_g in SmB6.

<h3>Noninvasive Photodelamination of van der Waals Semiconductors for  High-Performance Electronics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13915" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13915</a>

<br>
<br>
Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals semiconductors are
promising candidate materials for post-silicon electronics. However, it remains
challenging to attain completely uniform monolayer semiconductor wafers free of
over-grown islands. Here, we report the observation of the energy funneling
effect and ambient photodelamination phenomenon in inhomogeneous few-layer
WS$_2$ flakes under low illumination fluencies down to several nW/$\mu$m$^{2}$
and its potential as a non-invasive post-etching strategy for selectively
stripping the local excessive overlying islands. Photoluminescent tracking on
the photoetching traces reveals relatively fast etching rates around
$0.3-0.8\,\mu$m/min at varied temperatures and an activation energy of
$1.7\,$eV. By using crystallographic and electronic characterization, we also
confirm the non-invasive nature of the low-power photodelamination and the
highly preserved lattice quality in the as-etched monolayer products, featuring
a comparable average density of atomic defects (ca.$4.2\times
10^{13}\,$cm$^{-2}$) to pristine flakes and a high electron mobility up to
$80\,$cm$^{2}\cdot$V$^{-1}\cdot$s$^{-1}$) at room temperature. This approach
opens a non-invasive photoetching route for thickness uniformity management in
2D van der Waals semiconductor wafers for electronic applications.

This scientific paper aims to study the correlation between the mobile and
immobile dislocation within loaded slip bands observed in situ, shedding light
on the underlying plastic deformation mechanisms. The full Nye lattice
curvature tensor was measured using high-resolution electron-backscatter
diffraction (HR-EBSD) to estimate the dislocations density. We observed that
dislocation activities at the slip band were mainly from immobile edge
dislocations to maintain the geometrical distortion of the slip band. A burst
of dislocations was induced at the slip band associated with hot spots related
to the intense strain gradient.

<h3>Enhancement of Carrier Mobility in Semiconductor Nanostructures by  Carrier Distribution Engineering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13921" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13921</a>
<br>
<i>Binxi Liang, Luhao Liu, Jiachen Tang, Jian Chen, Yi Shi, Songlin Li</i>
<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals semiconductors are appealing for low-power
transistors. Here, we show the feasibility in enhancing carrier mobility in 2D
semiconductors through engineering the vertical distribution of carriers
confined inside the ultrathin channels via symmetrizing gate configuration or
increasing channel thickness. Through self-consistently solving the
Schr\"odinger-Poisson equations, the shapes of electron envelope functions are
extensively investigated by clarifying their relationship with gate
configuration, channel thickness, dielectric permittivity, and electron
density. The impacts of electron distribution variation on various carrier
scattering matrix elements and overall carrier mobility are insightfully
clarified. It is found that the carrier mobility can be generally enhanced in
the dual-gated configuration due to the centralization of carrier
redistribution in the nanometer-thick semiconductor channels and the rate of
increase reaches up to 23% in HfO$_2$ dual-gated 10-layer MoS$_2$ channels.
This finding represents a viable strategy for performance optimization in
transistors consisting of 2D semiconductors.

<h3>Observation of first-order quantum phase transitions and ferromagnetism  in twisted double bilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13927" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13927</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Twisted graphene multilayers are highly tunable flatband systems for
developing new phases of matter. Thus far, while orbital ferromagnetism has
been observed in valley polarized phases, the long-range orders of other
correlated phases as well as the quantum phase transitions between different
orders mostly remain unknown. Here, we report an observation of Coulomb
interaction driven first-order quantum phase transitions and ferromagnetism in
twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG). At zero magnetic field, the transitions
are revealed in a series of step-like abrupt resistance jumps with prominent
hysteresis loop when either the displacement field (D) or the carrier density
(n) is tuned across symmetry-breaking boundary near half filling, indicating a
formation of ordered domains. It is worth noting that the good turnability and
switching of these states gives a rise to a memory performance with a large
on/off ratio. Moreover, when both spin and valley play the roles at finite
magnetic field, we observe abundant first-order quantum phase transitions among
normal metallic states from charge neutral point, orbital ferromagnetic states
from quarter filling, and spin-polarized states from half filling. We interpret
these first-order phase transitions in the picture of phase separations and
spin domain percolations driven by multi-field tunable Coulomb interactions, in
agreement with Lifshitz transition from Hartree-Fock calculations. The observed
multi-filed tunable domain structure and its hysteresis resembles the
characteristics of multiferroics, revealing intriguing magnetoelectric
properties. Our result enriches the correlated phase diagram in TDBG for
discovering novel exotic phases and quantum phase transitions, and it would
benefit other twisted moir\'e systems as well.

<h3>Multiple Zeeman-type Hidden Spin Splitting in  $\mathcal{\hat{P}\hat{T}}$-Symmetric Layered Antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13955" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13955</a>
<br>
<i>Sajjan Sheoran, Saswata Bhattacharya</i>
<br>
<br>
Centrosymmetric antiferromagnetic semiconductors, although abundant in
nature, appear less favorable in spintronics owing to the lack of inherent spin
polarization and magnetization. We unveil hidden Zeeman-type spin splitting
(HZSS) in layered centrosymmetric antiferromagnets with asymmetric sublayer
structures by employing first-principles simulations and symmetry analysis.
Taking the bilayer counterpart of recently synthesized monolayer MnSe, we
demonstrate that the degenerate states formed around specific high symmetry
points exhibit uniform in-plane spin configurations with opposite orientations.
Furthermore, degenerate states spatially segregate on different sublayers
forming $\mathcal{\hat{P}\hat{T}}$-symmetric pair. Focusing locally on the
single layer, bands are Zeeman-split of order $\sim$40 meV. Strikingly, a tiny
electric field of a few mV$\r{A}^{-1}$ along the $z$-direction breaks the
two-fold spin-degeneracy forming additional Zeeman pair. Moreover, our
simulations on trilayer and tetralayer MnSe show that achieved HZSS is
independent of layer number. These findings establish the design principle to
obtain Zeeman-type splitting in centrosymmetric antiferromagnets and
significantly expand the range of materials to look for spintronics.

<h3>Laughlin's quasielectron is a non-local composite fermion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13972" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13972</a>
<br>
<i>Alberto Nardin, Leonardo Mazza</i>
<br>
<br>
We discuss the link between the quasielectron wavefunctions proposed by
Laughlin and by Jain and we show analytically and numerically that Laughlin's
quasielectron is a non-local composite fermion state. Composite-fermion states
are typically discussed in terms of the composite-fermion Landau levels (also
known as Lambda levels); whereas in standard composite-fermion wavefunctions
the excited Lambda levels have sub-extensive occupation numbers, Laughlin's
quasielectron entails a macroscopic occupation of the first Lambda level. Even
though the lowest Landau level projection produces a localised quasielectron
with well defined fractional charge, in reality the compressible boundary is
also influenced by the projection. This leads to a non-local object consisting
of a localized fractional charge in the bulk accompanied by a boundary
excitation. As a consequence, we show that the Laughlin quasielectron
fractionalizes an incorrect spin. We argue that this non-locality is
responsible for the problems reported in many articles concerning the
statistical properties of Laughlin's quasielectron. We conclude that Laughlin's
quasielectron is not a good candidate for a quasielectron wavefunction.

<h3>Superconductivity at ambient pressure in hole-doped LuH$_3$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13981" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13981</a>
<br>
<i>Zhenfeng Ouyang, Miao Gao, Zhong-Yi Lu</i>
<br>
<br>
Very recently, a report on possible room-temperature superconductivity in
N-doped lutetium hydrides near 1 GPa pressure has drawn lots of attentions. To
date, the superconductivity is not confirmed under relatively low pressure in
subsequent studies. Based on the density functional theory first-principles
calculations, we extensively investigate the influence of charge doping on the
stability and superconductivity of LuH$_3$ at ambient pressure. Although
electron doping can not stabilize LuH$_3$, we find that the room-pressure
stability of LuH$_3$ can be achieved by doping holes with concentrations in
between 0.15-0.30 holes/cell. Moreover, our calculations reveal a positive
dependence of superconducting transition temperature on the number of doped
holes, with the highest value close to 54 K. These findings suggest that
realizing superconductivity in hole-doped LuH$_3$ at ambient pressure is not
impossible, although the transition temperature is still far away from the room
temperature.

<h3>Learned Mappings for Targeted Free Energy Perturbation between Peptide  Conformations</h3>

Targeted free energy perturbation uses an invertible mapping to promote
configuration space overlap and the convergence of free energy estimates.
However, developing suitable mappings can be challenging. Wirnsberger et al.
(2020) demonstrated the use of machine learning to train deep neural networks
that map between Boltzmann distributions for different thermodynamic states.
Here, we adapt their approach to free energy differences of a flexible bonded
molecule, deca-alanine, with harmonic biases with different spring centers.
When the neural network is trained until ``early stopping'' - when the loss
value of the test set increases - we calculate accurate free energy differences
between thermodynamic states with spring centers separated by 1 \r{A} and
sometimes 2 \r{A}. For more distant thermodynamic states, the mapping does not
produce structures representative of the target state and the method does not
reproduce reference calculations.

<h3>Magnon confinement in an all-on-chip YIG cavity resonator using hybrid  YIG/Py magnon barriers</h3>

<br>
<i>Obed Alves Santos, Bart J. van Wees</i>
<br>
<br>
Confining magnons in cavities can introduce new functionalities to magnonic
devices, enabling future magnonic structures to emulate established photonic
and electronic components. As a proof-of-concept, we report magnon confinement
in a lithographically defined all-on-chip YIG cavity created between two
YIG/Permalloy bilayers. We take advantage of the modified magnetic properties
of covered/uncovered YIG film to define on-chip distinct regions with
boundaries capable of confining magnons. We confirm this by measuring multiple
spin pumping voltage peaks in a 400 nm wide platinum strip placed along the
center of the cavity. These peaks coincide with multiple spin-wave resonance
modes calculated for a YIG slab with the corresponding geometry. The
fabrication of micrometer-sized YIG cavities following this technique
represents a new approach to control coherent magnons, while the spin pumping
voltage in a nanometer-sized Pt strip demonstrates to be a non-invasive local
detector of the magnon resonance intensity.

<h3>Exciton properties: learning from a decade of measurements on halide  perovskites and transition metal dichalcogenides</h3>

<br>
<br>
The exciton binding energy ($E_b$) is a key parameter that governs the
physics of many optoelectronic devices. At their best, trustworthy and precise
measurements of $E_b$ challenge theoreticians to refine models, are a driving
force in advancing the understanding a material system, and lead to efficient
device design. At their worst, inaccurate $E_b$ measurements lead theoreticians
astray, sew confusion within the research community, and hinder device
improvements by leading to poor designs. This review article seeks to highlight
the pros and cons of different measurement techniques used to determine $E_b$,
namely, temperature-dependent photoluminescence, resolving Rydberg states,
electroabsorption, magnetoabsorption, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, and
fitting the optical absorption. Due to numerous conflicting $E_b$ values
reported for halide perovskites (HP) and transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDC) monolayers, an emphasis is placed on highlighting these measurements in
attempt to reconcile the variance between different measurement techniques. By
considering the published data en masse, we argue the experiments with the
clearest indicators are in agreement on the following values: ~350 - 450 meV
for TMDC monolayers between SiO$_2$ and vacuum, ~150 - 200 meV for
hBN-encapsulated TMDC monolayers, ~200 - 300 meV for common lead-iodide 2D HPs,
and ~10 meV for methylammonium lead iodide.

<h3>High Strength Refractory AlHfNbTiV B2 High Entropy Alloys with High  Fracture Strains</h3>

<br>

We demonstrate the development of a series of refractory high-entropy alloys
containing aluminum AlRHEAs in the ordered BCC-B2 phase by varying the aluminum
content within 10 to 25 atomic percent, with the goal of high strength and good
ductility synergy. The AlRHEAs obtained are found to show promising potential
for high-temperature applications. The incorporation of Al lowers the density
and promotes the long-range atomic ordering, which in turn stabilizes the B2
formation, and strengthens the material but usually deteriorates ductility.
Several B2 AlRHEAs that contain a combination of Ti, Hf, Nb, and V with
moderate to high Poisson ratios are investigated for high strength and
ductility. Furthermore, through statistical analysis, we identify a valley
around the valence electron concentration VEC of 6 where low ductility is
prominently observed. Machine-learning models are employed to screen the vast
compositional space of AlRHEA alloys to predict B2 formation and toughness
indicated by the yield strength and fracture strain. High prediction accuracies
are achieved. As the Al content decreases, the B2 atomic ordering decreases,
compression yield strengths decrease from 1500 MPa to 1200 MPa, and compression
fracture strains increase from 0.06 to over 0.5. Notably, Al10Hf20Nb22Ti33V15
retains a compression yield strength exceeding 800 MPa up to 700 C, tensile
yield strength of 1100 MPa, and fracture strain of 0.083. Our findings on
enhancing ductility in pure B2 alloys pave the way for further research on
Al-RHEA superalloys, striving to achieve high strength and ductility, reduced
density, and improved oxidation resistance.

<h3>Asymmetric rectified electric and concentration fields in multicomponent  electrolytes with surface reactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14068" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14068</a>

<i>Nathan Jarvey, Filipe Henrique, Ankur Gupta</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent studies have utilized AC fields and electrochemical reactions in
multicomponent electrolyte solutions to control colloidal assembly. However,
theoretical investigations have thus far been limited to binary electrolytes
and have overlooked the impact of electrochemical reactions. In this study, we
address these limitations by analyzing a system with multicomponent
electrolytes, while also relaxing the assumption of ideally blocking electrodes
to capture the effect of surface electrochemical reactions. Through a regular
perturbation analysis in the low-applied-potential regime, we solve the
Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations and obtain effective equations for electrical
potential and ion concentrations. By employing a combination of numerical and
analytical calculations, our analysis reveals a significant finding:
electrochemical reactions alone can generate asymmetric rectified electric
fields (AREFs), i.e., time-averaged, long-range electric fields, even when the
diffusivities of the ionic species are equal. This finding expands our
understanding beyond the conventional notion that AREFs arise solely from
diffusivity contrast. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AREFs induced by
electrochemical reactions can be stronger than those resulting from asymmetric
diffusivities. Additionally, we report the emergence of asymmetric rectified
concentration fields (ARCFs), i.e., time-averaged long-range concentration
fields, which supports the electrodiffusiophoresis mechanism of colloidal
assembly observed in experiments. We also derive analytical expressions for
AREFs and ARCFs, emphasizing the role of imbalances in ionic strength and
charge densities, respectively, as the driving forces behind their formation.

We report NMR study on the spin correlations in the spin-cluster based
mineral Na$_2$Cu$_3$O(SO$_4$)$_3$ with magnetic fields ranged from 1 T to 33 T.
The long-range magnetic order is observed from both the sudden spectral
broadening at $T_N$ and critical slowing down behavior in the temperature
dependence of spin-lattice relaxation rates ($1/T_1(T)$). The hump behavior of
$1/T_1(T)$ persists to $\mu_0H=7.25$ T, above which a spin excitation gap is
observed from the thermally activated temperature dependence of $1/T_1$. The
gap size shows a linear field dependence, whose slope and intercept
respectively yield an effective magnetic moment of 2.54 $\mu_B$ and a 0.94 meV
spin excitation gap under zero magnetic field. These results indicate the
existence of short-range order and prominent easy-plane spin anisotropy, which
are important for understanding the spin excitation spectrum in
A$_2$Cu$_3$O(SO$_4$)$_3$.

In a model of correlated insulators with for example $f$ and $d$ orbitals,
conditions for a local pairing of the two orbitals exist without a global
condensation. On minimizing the free-energy constrained by the condition for
stability of mixed-valence, the magnitude of the local pairing is found to be
identical to the magnitude of the renormalized hybridization of the $f$ and $d$
orbitals. This leads to four bands of fractionalized fermions each with half
the weight of the normal fermions; two sets disperse across the chemical
potential and the other two have gaps. The fermions without a gap are dark to
any linear electro-magnetic probes of their charge and spin and observable only
through probes of their free-energy such as a Fermi-liquid specific heat and
magneto-oscillations characteristic of a Fermi-surface but without a Zeeman
splitting. The excitations in the bands with the gaps behave as in insulators.
A magnetic field $H$ turns the insulator to a metal with a singularity in
magnetization proportional to $\sqrt{H - H_c}$, with $H_c$ related to the gap.
Beyond $H_c$, the usual Zeeman splitting appears in the magneto-oscillations.
The properties and predictions are compared to the momentous recent discoveries
in fluctuating mixed-valence insulators.

Dirac points in two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions are topologically
protected. Although single Dirac point cannot disappear solely, a pair of two
Dirac points annihilates after merging at a time-reversal invariant momentum
(TRIM). This process triggers a topological phase transition. In this paper, we
numerically calculate the electronic specific heat ($C$) of the systems with a
honeycomb lattice and $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ in the case that two Dirac
points are moving and merging by changing the ratio of the magnitude between
the transfer integrals, which can be controlled by uniaxial pressure for
example. When two Dirac points are close to but not at TRIM, the temperature
dependence exhibits a crossover from $C\propto T^{2.0}$ (expected for separated
Dirac points) at low temperatures ($T\leq T_{\rm co}$) to $C\propto T^{1.5}$
(expected in the case of the merged Dirac points) at high temperatures ($T\geq
T_{\rm co}$). Here, $T_{\rm co}$ denotes the crossover temperature, which is
determined by the potential barrier magnitude between two Dirac points. Our
findings demonstrate that the precursor of the topological phase transition is
observed through the temperature-dependence of the electronic specific heat.

Topological materials with unconventional electronic properties have been
investigated intensively for both fundamental and practical interests.
Thousands of topological materials have been identified by symmetry-based
analysis and ab initio calculations. Here we employ this database and
supervisedly train neural networks to develop a heuristic chemical rule for
electronic topology diagnosis. The learned rule diagnoses with a high accuracy
whether a material is topological using only its chemical formula and Hubbard
$U$ paramenter. We next evaluate the model performance in several different
regimes of materials. Finally, we integrate machine-learned rule with ab initio
calculations to high-throughput screen for magnetic topological insulators in
2D material database. We discover two new classes of Chern insulators with full
band gaps, which may motivate for future experimental observation.

Copper(II) silver(II) sulfate crystallizes in a monoclinic CuSO4-related
structure with P21/n symmetry. This quasi-ternary compound features
[Ag(SO4)2]2- layers, while the remaining cationic sites may be occupied either
completely or partially by Cu2+ cations, corresponding to the formula of
(CuxAg1-x)[Ag(SO4)2], x = 0.6-1.0. CuAg(SO4)2 is antiferromagnetic with large
negative Curie-Weiss temperature of -84.1 K and shows two characteristic
ordering phenomena at 19 K and 40 K. Density functional theory calculations
reveal that the strongest superexchange interaction is a two-dimensional
antiferromagnetic coupling within [Ag(SO4)2]2- layers, with the superexchange
constant J2D of -11.1 meV. This renders CuAg(SO4)2 the rare representative of
layered Ag2+-based antiferromagnets. Magnetic coupling is facilitated by the
strong mixing of Ag d(x2-y2) and O 2p states. Calculations show that M2+ sites
in MAg(SO4)2 can be occupied with other similar cations such as Zn2+, Cd2+,
Ni2+, Co2+, and Mg2+.

<h3>Multi-exposure diffraction pattern fusion applied to enable wider-angle  transmission Kikuchi diffraction with direct electron detectors</h3>

Diffraction pattern analysis can be used to reveal the crystalline structure
of materials, and this information is used to nano- and micro-structure of
advanced engineering materials that enable modern life. For nano-structured
materials typically diffraction pattern analysis is performed in the
transmission electron microscope (TEM) and TEM diffraction patterns typically
have a limited angular range (less than a few degrees) due to the long camera
length, and this requires analysis of multiple patterns to probe a unit cell.
As a different approach, wide angle Kikuchi patterns can be captured using an
on-axis detector in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) with a shorter
camera length. These 'transmission Kikuchi diffraction' (TKD) patterns present
a direct projection of the unit cell and can be routinely analyzed using
EBSD-based methods and dynamical diffraction theory. In the present work, we
enhance this analysis significantly and present a multi-exposure diffraction
pattern fusion method that increases the dynamic range of the detected patterns
captured with a Timepix3-based direct electron detector (DED). This method uses
an easy-to-apply exposure fusion routine to collect data and extend the dynamic
range, as well as normalize the intensity distribution within these very wide
(>95{\deg}) angle patterns. The potential of this method is demonstrated with
full diffraction sphere reprojection and highlight potential of the approach to
rapidly probe the structure of nano-structured materials in the scanning
electron microscope.

Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have attracted considerable interest for
their unique physical properties. Here, we report the intrinsic cryogenic
electronic transport properties in few-layer MoSe$_2$ field-effect transistors
(FETs) that are simultaneously van der Waals contacted with gold electrodes and
are fully encapsulated in ultraclean hexagonal boron nitride dielectrics. The
FETs exhibit electronically favorable channel/dielectric interfaces with low
densities of interfacial traps ($10^{10}\,$cm$^{-2}$), which lead to
outstanding device characteristics at room temperature, including a
near-Boltzmann-limit subthreshold swings ($\lt65\,$mV/dec), a high carrier
mobility ($68\,$cm$^{2}\cdot$V$^{-1}\cdot$s$^{-1}$), and a negligible scanning
hysteresis ($\lt15\,$mV). The dependence of various contact-related quantities
on temperature and carrier density are also systematically characterized to
understand the van der Waals contacts between gold and MoSe$_2$. The results
provide insightful information on the device physics in van der Waals contacted
and encapsulated 2D FETs.

Solar to power conversion certified efficiencies of formamidinium lead iodide
based single-junction perovskite solar cell is now 26%, all
perovskite-perovskite tandem $\sim$28%, and the perovskite-silicon tandem solar
cell is $\sim$34% going beyond gallium arsenide solar cells. Therefore, it is
now one of the most promising materials for generating cheaper sunlight-based
electricity. This material has two commonly known polymorphs; one is a
thermodynamically stable yellow hexagonal phase. The other one is a metastable
black perovskite phase: a powerful photo-active material. Thousands of
experiments have been performed to produce the highly crystalline photoactive
phase of formamidinium lead iodide. Despite that, PSCs often suffer from poor
reproducibility and stability. One of the root cause is the lack of control
over their synthesis, i.e. crystallization process, where one of the main
quests is to synthesize and stabilize corner-sharing defects-free photoactive
perovskite form of pure or doped black perovskite form of formamidinium lead
iodide and prevent the formation of hexagonal phases. Thus, for the rapid
industrialization of perovskite based solar farms to combat global rising
temperatures: it is all-important to understand the polymorph selective
nucleation of formamidinium lead iodide from its precursors. Towards this
ultimate goal, here we perform molecular simulations of the nucleation of
formamidinium lead iodide from solution. This study aims to take the primary
steps for the all-atoms simulations of the polymorph selective crystallization
of halide perovskites.

Advances in nanotechnology have facilitated the exploration of submicron
thermal transport. At this scale, Fourier's law is no longer applicable, and
the governing equation for thermal transport is the phonon Boltzmann transport
equation (BTE). However, the availability of open-source solvers for the phonon
BTE is limited, impeding progress in this field. This study introduces an
open-source package, GiftBTE, for numerically solving the non-gray phonon BTE.
GiftBTE employs deterministic solutions and provides both steady-state and
transient solvers. For the steady-state solver, GiftBTE employs the implicit
discrete ordinates method (DOM) with second-order spatial accuracy and the
synthetic iterative scheme. For the transient solver, GiftBTE employs the
explicit DOM with second-order spatial accuracy. This package demonstrates
excellent computational efficiency, enabling realistic three-dimensional
simulations of devices and materials. By interfacing with first-principles
calculations, this solver enables parameter-free computation of submicron
thermal transport. The application of GiftBTE includes, but is not limited to,
computing the thermal conductivity of nanostructures, predicting temperature
rises in transistors, and simulating laser heating processes.

We propose an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) design to solve the inverse
problem for a 1D Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). More precise, the ANN takes
the squared modulus of the stationary GPE solution as an input and returns the
parameters of the potential function and the factor in front of the GPE
non-linear term. From the physical point of view the ANN predicts the
parameters of a trap potential and the interaction constant of 1D Bose-Einstein
Condensate (BEC) by its density distribution. Using the results of numerical
solution of GPE for more than $30 000$ sets of GPE parameters as train and
validation datasets we build the ANN as a fast and accurate inverse GPE solver.

Moir\'{e} interference effects have profound impact on the optoelectronic
properties of vertical van der Waals structures. Here we establish secondary
electron imaging in a scanning electron microscope as a powerful technique for
visualizing registry-specific domains in vertical bilayers of transition metal
dichalcogenides with common moir\'e phenomena. With optimal parameters for
contrast-maximizing imaging of high-symmetry registries, we identify distinct
crystal realizations of WSe$_2$ homobilayers and MoSe$_2$-WSe$_2$
heterobilayers synthesized by chemical vapor deposition, and demonstrate
ubiquitous lattice reconstruction in stacking-assembled bilayers with near
parallel and antiparallel alignment. Our results have immediate implications
for the optical properties of registry-specific excitons in layered stacks of
transition metal dichalcogenides, and demonstrate the general potential of
secondary electron imaging for van der Waals twistronics.

Topological phases realized in time-reversal invariant (TRI) systems are
foundational to experimental study of the broader canon of topological
condensed matter as they do not require exotic magnetic orders for realization.
We therefore introduce topological skyrmion phases of matter realized in TRI
systems as a foundational step towards experimental realization of topological
skyrmion phases. A novel bulk-boundary correspondence hidden from the ten-fold
way classification scheme is revealed by the presence of a non-trivial value of
a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin skyrmion invariant. This quantized topological invariant
gives a finer description of the topology in 2D TRI systems as it indicates the
presence or absence of robust helical edge states for open boundary conditions,
in cases where the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant computed with projectors onto
occupied states takes a trivial value. Physically, we show this hidden
bulk-boundary correspondence derives from additional spin-momentum-locking of
the helical edge states associated with the topological skyrmion phase. ARPES
techniques and transport measurements can detect these signatures of
topological spin-momentum-locking and helical gapless modes. Our work therefore
lays the foundation for experimental study of these phases of matter.

When single-particle dynamics are suppressed in certain strongly correlated
systems, dipoles arise as elementary carriers of quantum kinetics. These
dipoles can further condense, providing physicists with a rich realm to study
fracton phases of matter. Whereas recent theoretical discoveries have shown
that an unconventional lattice model may host a dipole condensate as the ground
state, fundamental questions arise as to whether dipole condensation is a
generic phenomenon rather than a specific one unique to a particular model and
what new quantum macroscopic phenomena a dipole condensate may bring us with.
Here, we show that dipole condensates prevail in bosonic systems. Because of a
self-proximity effect, where single-particle kinetics inevitably induces a
finite order parameter of dipoles, dipole condensation readily occurs in
conventional normal phases of bosons. Our findings allow experimentalists to
manipulate the phase of a dipole condensate and deliver dipolar Josephson
effects, where supercurrents of dipoles arise in the absence of particle flows.
The self-proximity effects can also be utilized to produce a generic multipolar
condensate. The kinetics of the $n$-th order multipoles unavoidably creates a
condensate of the $(n+1)$-th order multipoles, forming a hierarchy of
multipolar condensates that will offer physicists a whole new class of
macroscopic quantum phenomena.

We study numerically the two-dimensional coherent spectrum (2DCS) of the
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid hosted by the $S=1/2$ XY spin chain. The 2DCS
characterizes the system's third order nonlinear magnetic response triggered by
three pulses, separated successively by the delay time and the waiting time. It
exhibits a photon echo signal resulting from a lensing process of the
fractional excitations: A pair of photon-excited fractional excitations,
initially moving apart, reverse their direction of motion, and annihilate each
other. In the XY chain, the nonlinearity in the dispersion relation of the
Jordan-Wigner fermions leads to the dispersion of the fractional excitation
wave packets and thereby suppresses lensing. The magnitude of the echo signal
decreases exponentially with increasing delay time. The decay rate scales with
the temperature $T$ as $T^n$ at low temperature, where $n$ is the leading order
of the Jordan-Wigner fermion dispersion, and as $T$ at high temperature. By
contrast, as the waiting time increases, the magnitude of the echo signal
saturates, reflecting the integrability of the system. Our results illustrate
the effectiveness of the 2DCS in detecting subtle dynamical properties of
optical excitations in spin chains.

We propose a physical principle for implementation of controllable
interactions of identical electromagnetic bosons (excitons or polaritons) in
two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors. The key ingredients are stable biexcitons
and in-plane anisotropy of the host structure due to, e.g., a uniaxial strain.
We show that anisotropy-induced splitting of the radiative exciton doublet
couples the biexciton state to continua of boson scattering states. As a
result, two-body elastic scattering of bosons may be resonantly amplified when
energetically tuned close to the biexciton by applying a transverse magnetic
field or tuning the coupling with the microcavity photon mode. For excitons, we
predict giant molecules (Feshbach dimers) which can be obtained from a
biexciton via rapid adiabatic sweeping of the magnetic field across the
resonance. The molecules possess non-trivial entanglement properties. Our
proposal holds promise for the strongly-correlated photonics and the quantum
chemistry of light.

The electric-power dissipation of the anomalous-Hall current injected into a
lateral load circuit is studied. The anomalous-Hall current is generated by a
$\mathrm{Co_{75}Gd_{25}}$ ferrimagnetic Hall bar and injected into lateral
contacts lithographied at the two edges. The current, the voltage and the power
injected in the lateral circuit are studied as a function of the magnetization
state, the load resistance $R_l$, and the temperature. The power efficiency
shows a sharp maximum as a function $R_l$, which corresponds to the condition
of the resistance matching of the two sub-circuits. The maximum power
efficiency is of the order of the square of anomalous-Hall angle. The
observations are in agreement with recent predictions based on a
non-equilibrium variational approach.

High lattice thermal conductivity in half-Heusler alloys has been the major
bottleneck in thermoelectric applications. Disordered half-Heusler alloys could
be a plausible alternative to this predicament. In this paper, utilizing
first-principles simulations, we have demonstrated the low lattice thermal
conductivity in two such phases, NbFe$_{0.5}$Ni$_{0.5}$Sn and
TaFe$_{0.5}$Ni$_{0.5}$Sn, in comparison to well-known half-Heusler alloy
TiCoSb. We trace the low thermal conductivity to their short phonon lifetime,
originating from the interaction among acoustic and low-lying optical phonons.
We recommend nanostructuring as an effective route in further diminishing the
lattice thermal conductivity. We further predict that these alloys can be best
used in the temperature range 400-600~K and carrier concentration of less than
10$^{21}$ carriers cm$^{-3}$. We found $\sim$35\% and $\sim$17\% enhancement in
$ZT$ for NbFe$_{0.5}$Ni$_{0.5}$Sn and TaFe$_{0.5}$Ni$_{0.5}$Sn, respectively,
as compared to TiCoSb. We are optimistic of the findings and believe these

Applications of machine learning techniques in materials science are often
based on two key ingredients, a set of empirical descriptors and a database of
a particular material property of interest. The advent of graph neural
networks, such as the Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (CGCNN),
demonstrates the possibility of directly mapping the relationship between
material structures and properties without employing empirical descriptors.
Another exciting recent advancement is in large language models such as
OpenAI's GPT-4, which demonstrates competency at reading comprehension tasks
and holds great promise for accelerating the acquisition of databases on
material properties. Here, we utilize the combination of GPT-4 and CGCNN to
develop rare-earth doped phosphors for solid-state lighting. GPT-4 is applied
to data-mine chemical formulas and emission wavelengths of 264 Eu(II)-doped
phosphors from 274 papers. A CGCNN model is trained on the acquired dataset,
achieving a test $R^2$ of 0.77. The model is then used to screen over 40,000
inorganic materials to make predictions on the emission wavelengths. We also
demonstrate the possibility of leveraging transfer learning to fine-tune a
bandgap-predicting CGCNN model towards the prediction of phosphor emission
wavelengths. The workflow requires minimal human supervision, little domain
knowledge about phosphors, and is generalizable to other material properties.

Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is widely used to obtain polymer-based
composites with improved mechanical and thermal conduction properties. The
effective properties of the composites are sensitive to its structure including
the shape, distribution, and orientation of inclusions in the matrix and
FFF-specific defects. The present work aims to study the formation of composite
structure and relate it to the measured effective thermal conduction
properties. Polymer flow in the hot end and the structure of printed samples
are studied by metallography. The effective thermal diffusivity is measured by
the laser flash method and analyzed by the Maxwell Garnett theory. Fibers in a
polymer-matrix composite visualize polymer flow in the hot end of the FFF
printer. In the nozzle, fibers are generally oriented parallel to the flow
direction while gas bubbles may locally disturb flow and disorient fibers.
Printed composite Carbon fiber/TPU inherits preferential orientation of fibers
observed in the filament. Disorientation of fibers relative to the alignment
direction increases after printing. In the printed Al2O3/PA composite, there is
a lattice of triangle-based cylindrical pores parallel to the extrusion
direction. Al2O3 particles are of irregular shape and approximately equiaxed.
No segregation or agglomeration are observed. Significant anisotropy of thermal
diffusivity is observed in the printed samples of 5%vol. Carbon fiber/TPU
composite. The measured effective thermal diffusivity of printed Al2O3/PA
composites is essentially isotropic and significantly increases with the volume
fraction of inclusions. In the studied FFF-printed composites, the effective
thermal diffusivity is proportional to the thermal diffusivity of polymer
matrix, which is sensitive to its structure formed in non-equilibrium
conditions of rapid quenching from liquid phase.

<h3>Fluctuation, insulation and superconductivity: the pressure-dependent  phase-diagram of Rb$_2$Mo$_6$Se$_6$</h3>

The quasi-one-dimensional (q1D) material Rb$_2$Mo$_6$Se$_6$ has been proposed
to display a nontrivial combination of low-dimensional fluctuations and a
dynamical charge density wave (CDW) at ambient pressure. This may lead to a
progressive metal to insulator cross over at low temperature. To explore the
link between the crystal dimensionality and this insulating instability, we
have performed hydrostatic pressure-dependent electrical transport measurements
on single crystals of Rb$_2$Mo$_6$Se$_6$. At low pressure, we observe
thermally-activated behaviour consistent with a temperature-dependent gap
$E_g(T)$ opening below a characteristic temperature $T_{Rmin}$. Upon increasing
the pressure $T_{Rmin}$ initially rises, indicating a reinforcement of the low
temperature insulating state despite a continuous reduction in $E_g(P)$. We
interpret this as a signature of suppressed fluctuations as the dimensionality
of the electronic structure rises. However, $T_{Rmin}$ drops above 8.8 GPa and
superconductivity emerges at 12 GPa. Between 12-24.2 GPa the superconducting
and insulating instabilities coexist, with superconductivity surviving up to
the maximum attained pressure (52.8 GPa). Analysis of the magneto-transport
reveals two distinct regions: at high pressures the anisotropy gradually falls
and the superconducting state appears unremarkable. In contrast, coexistence
with the gapped insulating phase creates a superconducting dome. The emergence

Data-driven methodology has become a key tool in computationally predicting
material properties. Currently, these techniques are priced high due to
computational requirements for generating sufficient training data for
high-precision machine learning models. In this study, we present a Support
Vector Regression (SVR)-based machine learning model to predict the stability
of silicon (Si) - alkaline metal alloys, with a strong emphasis on the
transferability of the model to new silicon alloys with different electronic
configurations and structures. We elaborate on the role of the structural
descriptor in imparting transferability to the model that is trained on limited
data (~750 Si alloys) derived from the Material Project database. Three popular
descriptors, namely X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Sine Coulomb Matrix (SCM), and
Orbital Field Matrix (OFM), are evaluated for representing Si alloys. The
material structures are represented by descriptors in the SVR model, coupled
with hyperparameter tuning techniques like Grid Search CV and Bayesian
Optimization (BO), to find the best performing model for predicting total
energy, formation energy and packing fraction of the Si alloy systems. The
models are trained on Si alloys with lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K),
magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), and aluminum (Al) metals, where Si-Na and Si-Al
systems are used as test structures. Our results show that XRD, an
experimentally derived characterization of structures, performs most reliably
as a descriptor for total energy prediction of new Si alloys. The study
demonstrates that by qualitatively selection of training data, using
hyperparameter tuning methods, and employing appropriate structural
descriptors, the data requirements for robust and accurate ML models can be
reduced.

Dynamic space packing (DSP) is a process of continuing random addition and
removal of identical objects into space. In the lattice version, objects are
particles occupying single lattice sites, and adding a particle to a site leads
to the removal of particles on neighboring sites. We determine the steady-state
occupancy, correlation functions, desorption probabilities, and other
statistical features for the DSP of hyper-cubic lattices. We also analyze a
continuous DSP of balls into $\mathbb{R}^d$.

The intermetallic compound TlBi$_2$ crystallizes in the MgB$_2$ structure and
becomes superconducting below 6.2 K. Considering that both Tl and Bi have heavy
atomic masses, it is puzzling why TlBi$_2$ is a conventional phonon-mediated
superconductor. We have performed comprehensive first-principles calculations
of the electronic structures, the phonon dispersions and the electron-phonon
couplings for TlBi$_2$. The $6p$ orbitals of bismuth dominate over the states
near the Fermi level, forming strong intra-layer $p_{x/y}$ and inter-layer
$p_z$ $\sigma$ bonds which is known to have strong electron-phonon coupling. In
addition, the large spin-orbit coupling interaction in TlBi$_2$ increases its
electron-phonon coupling constant significantly. As a result, TlBi$_2$, with a
logarithmic phonon frequency average one tenth that of MgB$_2$, is a
phonon-mediated superconductor.

<h3>Thermalization Slowing-Down in Multidimensional Josephson Junction  Networks</h3>

<br>
<br>
We characterize thermalization slowing-down of Josephson junction networks in
1, 2 and 3 spatial dimensions for systems with hundreds of sites by computing
their entire Lyapunov spectra. The ratio of Josephson coupling $E_J$ to energy
density $h$ controls two different universality classes of thermalization
slowing-down, namely the weak coupling regime, $E_J/h \rightarrow 0$, and the
strong coupling regime, $E_J/h \rightarrow \infty$. We analyze the Lyapunov
spectrum by measuring the largest Lyapunov exponent and by fitting the rescaled
spectrum with a general ansatz. We then extract two scales: the Lyapunov time
(inverse of the largest exponent) and the exponent for the decay of the
rescaled spectrum. The two universality classes, which exist irrespective of
network dimension, are characterized by different ways the extracted scales
diverge. The universality class corresponding to the weak-coupling regime
allows for the coexistence of strong chaos with near-conserved quantities and
is shown to be characterized by universal critical exponents, in contrast with
the strong-coupling regime. We expect our findings, which we explain using
perturbation theory arguments, to be a general feature of diverse Hamiltonian
systems.

<h3>General Theory of Momentum-Space Nonsymmorphic Symmetry</h3>

As a fundamental concept of all crystals, space groups are partitioned into
symmorphic groups and nonsymmorphic groups. Each nonsymmorphic group contains
glide reflections or screw rotations with fractional lattice translations,
which are absent in symmorphic groups. Although nonsymmorphic groups
ubiquitously exist on real-space lattices, on the reciprocal lattices in
momentum space, the ordinary theory only allows symmorphic groups. In this
work, we develop a novel theory for momentum-space nonsymmorphic space groups
(k-NSGs), utilizing the projective representations of space groups. The theory
is quite general: Given any k-NSGs in any dimensions, it can identify the
real-space symmorphic space groups (r-SSGs) and construct the corresponding
projective representation of the r-SSG that leads to the k-NSG. To demonstrate
the broad applicability of our theory, we show these projective representations
and therefore all k-NSGs can be realized by gauge fluxes over real-space
lattices. Our work fundamentally extends the framework of crystal symmetry, and
therefore can accordingly extend any theory based on crystal symmetry, for
instance the classification crystalline topological phases.

We report on the magnetic and electrical properties of a (Mn$_3$Sn)$_2$
triangular network kagome structured high quality Ho substituted ErMn$_6$Sn$_6$
single-crystal sample by magneto-transport measurements.
Er$_{0.5}$Ho$_{0.5}$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$ orders antiferromagnetically at N\'{e}el
temperature $T_\mathrm{N} \sim$ 350 K followed by a ferrimagnetic (FiM)
transition at $T_\mathrm{C} \sim$ 114 K and spin-orientation transition at
$T_\mathrm{t} \sim$ 20 K. The field-manifestations of these magnetic phases in
the \textit{ab}-basal plane and along the \textit{c}-axis are illustrated
through temperature-field \textit{T-H} phase diagrams. In
\textit{H}$\parallel$\textit{c}, narrow hysteresis between spin reorientation
and field-induced FiM phases below $T_\mathrm{t}$, enhanced/strengthened FiM
phase below $T_\mathrm{C}$ and stemming of FiM phase out of strongly coexisting
AFM and FiM phases below $T_\mathrm{N}$ through a non-meta-magnetic transition
are confirmed to arise from strong R-Mn sublattices interaction. In contrast,
\textit{H}$\parallel$\textit{ab}-plane, between $T_\mathrm{N}$ and
$T_\mathrm{C}$, individually contributing R-Mn sublattices with weak
antiferromagnetic interactions undergo a field-induced spin-flop
quasi-metamagnetic transition to FiM state. The temperature dependent
electrical resistivity suggests metallic nature with Fermi liquid behavior at
low temperatures. Essentially, the current study stimulates interest to
investigate the magnetic and electrical properties of mixed rare-earth layered
kagome magnetic metals for possible novel and exotic behavior.

The use of moir\'e patterns to manipulate two-dimensional materials has
facilitated new possibilities for controlling material properties. The moir\'e
patterns in the two-dimensional magnets can cause peculiar spin texture, as
shown by previous studies focused on twisted bilayer systems. In our study, we
develop a theoretical model to investigate the magnetic structure of twisted
trilayer magnets. Unlike the twisted bilayer, the twisted trilayer magnet has
four different local stacking structures distinguished by the interlayer
couplings between the three layers. Our results show that the complex
interlayer coupling effects in the moir\'e superlattice can lead to the
stabilization of rich magnetic domain structures; these structures can be
significantly manipulated by adjusting the twist angle. Additionally, external
magnetic fields can easily manipulate these domain structures, indicating
potential applications in spintronics devices.

We discuss the absorption spectrum of dirty s-wave superconductors in the
nonequilibrium steady state under a homogeneous and monochromatic microwave. In
this state, there exists a finite density of states at lower energies than the
superconducting gap, and the distribution function is also defined in this
energy region. Because of the reduction of the distribution function below the
superconducting gap, the absorption by thermally excited quasiparticles is
suppressed in the nonequilibrium state compared with that in the equilibrium
case. This is in contrast to the cases of the gap function and the absorption
by direct excitation, to which the variation of the distribution function above
the superconducting gap mainly contributes. It is also shown that amplitude
modes are generated by frequency mixing of the pump wave and the probe wave,
and two peaks appear in the absorption spectrum.

In the manuscript arXiv:2306.07869v1, N. L. Wang and co-authors report the
results of a near-infrared pump / terahertz probe study in the stripe-ordered
cuprate La$_{1.875}$Ba$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$. They measured a change in optical
conductivity, but did not find signatures of transient superconductivity. From
this observation they extrapolate that in all cuprates in which striped states
have been excited with light, there must be no light-induced superconductivity.
They conclude that "transient superconductivity cannot be induced by melting of
the competing stripe orders with pump pulses whose photon energy is much higher
than the superconducting gap of cuprates." Here we show that this extrapolation
is unwarranted. First, the absence of light-induced superconductivity in this
particular compound was already reported in a previous paper, which instead
showed positive evidence for La$_{1.885}$Ba$_{0.115}$CuO$_4$. In addition, the
experiment discussed here used photo-excitation with too low fluence and at a
suboptimal wavelength. More broadly, a negative result in one compound is
rarely compelling indication of the absence of an effect in an entire class of
materials.

Twisted heterostructures of two-dimensional crystals can create a moir\'{e}
landscape, which can change the properties of it's parent crystals. However,
the reproducibility of manual stacking is far from perfect. Here, the

metal dichalcogenides in misfit layer compound crystals is used as a moir\'{e}
generator. Using X-ray diffraction, the presence of twins with a well-defined
small twist angle between them is shown. Due to the twist, the surface
electrical potential from the induced ferroelectricity is observed using

I discuss uniform, isotropic, plane, singly connected, electrically linear,
regular symmetric Hall-plates with an arbitrary number of N peripheral contacts
exposed to a uniform perpendicular magnetic field of arbitrary strength. In
practice, the regular symmetry is the most common one. If the Hall-plates are
mapped conformally to the unit disk, regular symmetry means that all contacts
are equally large and all contacts spacings are equally large, yet the contacts
spacings may have a different size than the contacts. Such Hall-plates do not
change when they are rotated by 360{\deg}/N. Their indefinite conductance
matrices are circulant matrices, whose complex eigenvalues are computable in
closed form. These eigenvalues are used to discuss the Hall-output voltage, the
maximum noise-efficiency, and Van-der-Pauw's method for measuring sheet
resistances. For practical use, I report simple approximations for Hall-plates
with four contacts and 90{\deg} symmetry with popular shapes like disks,
rectangles, octagons, squares, and Greek crosses with and without rounded
corners.

<h3>Phenomenon of multiple reentrant localization in a double-stranded helix  with transverse electric field</h3>

The present work explores the potential for observing multiple reentrant
localization behavior in a double-stranded helical (DSH) system, extending
beyond the conventional nearest-neighbor hopping interaction. The DSH system is
considered to have hopping dimerization in each strand, while also being
subjected to a transverse electric field. The inclusion of an electric field
serves the dual purpose of inducing quasiperiodic disorder and strand-wise
staggered site energies. Two reentrant localization regions are identified: one
exhibiting true extended behavior in the thermodynamic limit, while the second
region shows quasi-extended characteristics with partial spreading within the
helix. The DSH system exhibits three distinct single-particle mobility edges
linked to localization transitions present in the system. The analysis in this
study involves examining various parameters such as the single-particle energy
spectrum, inverse participation ratio, local probability amplitude, and more.
Our proposal, combining achievable hopping dimerization and induced correlated
disorder, presents a unique opportunity to study phenomenon of reentrant
localization, generating significant research interest.

Electron teleportation via two separate Majorana bound states(MBSs) is a
manifestation of the non-locality of MBSs. A superconductor may host multiple
separate or partial overlapping MBSs, and it is difficult to distinguish them.
Here, we have studied the electron teleportation between two quantum dots via
multiple MBSs in a superconductor island, two of which couple with the quantum
dots. We find that in the absence of Majorana coupling, both elastic and
inelastic electron transfers are allowed for specific system settings, and the
extent to which the island state is changed after the teleportation relies on
the initial state of the MBSs. In the presence of Majorana couplings, the
elastic and inelastic teleportations are selective according to which pair of
MBSs are coupled. Meanwhile, the cotuneling processes are distinct for
different MBSs coupling types. In addition, we have investigated the effect of
the asymmetry of the tunnelings to quantum dots on the transport. Our findings
are meaningful for resolving transport signatures induced by topological MBSs
and that stems from nontopological quasiparticle.

<br>
<br>
One of the central challenges in condensed matter physics is to comprehend
systems that have strong disorder and strong interactions. In the strongly
localized regime, their subtle competition engenders glassy electrons, which
ceases to exist well before the insulator-to-metal transition is approached as
a function of doping. Here, we report on the discovery of glassy electron
dynamics deep inside the good metal regime of an electron-doped quantum
paraelectric system: KTaO$_{3}$. We reveal that upon excitation of electrons
from defect states to the conduction band, the excess injected carriers in the
conduction band relax in a stretched exponential manner with a large relaxation
time, and the system evinces simple aging phenomena - a telltale sign of glass.
Most significantly, we observe a critical slowing down of carrier dynamics
below 35 K, concomitant with the onset of quantum paraelectricity in the
undoped KTaO$_3$. Our combined investigation using second harmonic generation
technique, density functional theory and phenomenalogical modeling demonstrates
quantum fluctuation-stabilized soft polar modes as the impetus for the glassy
behavior. This study addresses one of the most fundamental questions regarding
the potential promotion of glassiness by quantum fluctuations and opens a route
for exploring glassy dynamics of electrons in a well-delocalized regime.

Bi2Sr2Ca1Cu2O8+d (Bi-2212) thin films with thicknesses less than 50 nm (<20
unit cells) are grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) onto (001) LaAlO3 (LAO)
single crystal substrates. Phase-pure and smooth c-axis oriented Bi-2212 films
with optimal oxygen doping, critical temperature Tc0 up to 86 K, and critical
current density Jc(60 K) above 1 MA/cm2 are obtained for samples that are
annealed in situ at temperatures below 700 {\deg}C. At higher temperature
Bi-2212 films on LAO substrates partially decompose to non-superconducting
impurity phases, while films on MgO and SrTiO3 substrates are stable. The
broadening of Tc of the metal-to-superconductor resistive phase transition in
magnetic fields is much larger for thin films of Bi-2212 as compared to
YBa2Cu3O7. The magnetic field-induced suppression of Tc0 is stronger for
Bi-2212 films containing impurity phases as compared to the phase-pure Bi-2212
films. The degradation of LAO substrate crystals after several steps of
deposition and chemical removal of the Bi-2212 layer is investigated. New,
commercially prepared substrates provide Bi-2212 films with smallest surface
roughness (3 nm) and strong out-of-plane texture. However, thin films of almost
the same quality are obtained on re-used LAO substrates that are mechanically
polished after the chemical etching.

We theoretically analyze Josephson dynamics of superconducting weak links
with transmissions ${\mathcal T}$ not much smaller than unity at subgap bias
voltages $V$. Employing the effective action approach combined with the Keldysh
technique we develop a regular perturbation theory in ${\mathcal R}=1-{\mathcal
T}$ and derive the first order correction to the current across the weak link
which consists of two different contributions. One of them is negative
effectively corresponding to a decrease of the excess current at small $V$ due
to breaking of the multiple Andreev reflection cycle by normal reflection for
some subgap quasiparticles. These quasiparticles, in turn, generate the second
-- Josephson-like -- contribution to the current which increases with
decreasing $V$ down to very small voltages where the perturbation theory in
${\mathcal R}$ ceases to be valid. Some of the above features are not
reproduced within the physical picture involving Landau-Zener tunneling between
subgap Andreev states.

A realistic description of the Josephson effect at finite temperature with
ultra-cold Fermi gases embedded in nontrivial geometrical constraints
(typically, trap plus barrier) requires an appropriate treatment of pairing
fluctuations developing in a inhomogeneous environment. Here, we apply the
theoretical approach developed in the companion article [1], where the
inclusion of pairing fluctuations beyond mean field across the BCS-BEC
crossover at finite temperature is combined with a corresponding detailed
description of the gap parameter in a nontrivial geometry, to account for the
experimental results on the Josephson critical current reported both at low
temperature for various couplings across the crossover [2] and as a function of
temperature at unitarity [3]. Besides validating the theoretical approach of
the companion article, our ab initio numerical results reveal generic features
of the Josephson effect which may not readily emerge from the analysis of
corresponding experiments with condensed-matter samples owing to the unique
intrinsic flexibility of experiments with ultra-cold gases. [1] L. Pisani, V.

<h3>The fate of reentrant localization phenomenon in the one-dimensional  dimerized quasiperiodic chain with long-range hopping</h3>

<br>

Recently, the exciting reentrant localization transition phenomenon was found
in a one-dimensional dimerized lattice with staggered quasiperiodic potentials.
Usually, long-range hopping is typically important in actual physical systems.
In this work, we study the effect of next-nearest neighbor hopping (NNNH) on
the reentrant localization phenomenon. Due to the presence of NNNH, the broken
chiral symmetry is further enhanced and the localization properties of electron
states in the upper and lower bands become quite different. It is found that
the reentrant localization can still persist within a range of NNNH both in
Hermitian and non-Hermitian cases. Eventually, the reentrant localization
disappears as the strength of NNNH increases to some extent, since the
increasing NNNH weakens the dimerization of the system and destroys its
competition with the quasiperiodic disorder. Our work thus reveals the effect
of long-range hopping in the reentrant localization phenomenon and deepens its
physical understanding.

Most theoretical treatments of inhomogeneous superconductivity have so far
been based on the Bogoliubov-deGennes equations, which implement the standard
BCS mean-field decoupling in the presence of spatial inhomogeneities. This
approach is reliable even at finite temperature for weak inter-particle
attraction, when the Cooper pair size is much larger than the average
inter-particle distance, but looses accuracy for increasing attraction when the
Cooper pair size becomes comparable or even smaller than the average
inter-particle distance, in particular when finite-temperature effects are
considered. In these cases, inclusion of pairing fluctuations beyond mean field
is unavoidably required, a task which, however, turns out to be especially
difficult in the presence of inhomogeneities. Here, we implement the inclusion
of pairing fluctuations directly on a coarse-graining version of the
Bogoliubov-deGennes equations, which makes it simpler and faster to obtain a
solution over the whole sector of the temperature-coupling phase diagram
corresponding to the BCS-BEC crossover in the broken-symmetry phase. We
specifically apply this method in the presence of a super-current flow, such
that problems related to the Josephson effect throughout the BCS-BEC crossover
can be addressed under a variety of circumstances. This is relevant especially
in the view of recent experimental data with ultra-cold Fermi atoms, to which
the results of the present approach are shown to favorably compare in the
companion Letter [1]. [1] V. Piselli, L. Pisani, and G. Calvanese Strinati,

Graphene, with its unique band structure, mechanical stability, and high
charge mobility, holds great promise for next-generation electronics.
Nevertheless, its zero band gap challenges the control of current flow through
electrical gating, consequently limiting its practical applications. Recent
research indicates that atomic oxygen can oxidize epitaxial graphene in a
vacuum without causing unwanted damage. In this study, we have investigated the
effects of chemisorbed atomic oxygen on the electronic properties of epitaxial
graphene, using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Our findings reveal that
oxygen atoms effectively modify the electronic states of graphene, resulting in
a band gap at its Dirac point. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible
to selectively induce desorption or hopping of oxygen atoms with atomic
precision by applying appropriate bias sweeps with an STM tip. These results
suggest the potential for atomic-scale tailoring of graphene oxide, enabling
the development of graphene-based atomic-scale electronic devices.

chain length (Mw: 11k, 22k, 43k, and 66k g/mol) on the growth of colloidal
crystals (e.g. mesocrystals) and their resulting crystal structure is
investigated. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and scanning transmission
electron microscopy (STEM) methods provide a detailed structural examination of
the self-assembled faceted mesocrystals based on octahedral gold nanoparticles
of different size and surface functionalization. Three-dimensional angular
X-ray cross-correlation analysis (AXCCA) enables high-precision determination
of the superlattice structure and relative orientation of nanoparticles in
mesocrystals. This approach allows us to perform non-destructive
characterization of mesocrystalline materials and reveals their structure with

Hydrogen fuel cells offer a clean and sustainable energy conversion solution.
The bipolar separator plate, a critical component in fuel cells, plays a vital
role in preventing reactant gas cross-contamination and facilitating efficient
ion transport in a fuel cell. High chromium ferritic stainless steel with an
artificially formed thin chromium oxide passive film has recently gained
attention due to its superior electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance,
making it a suitable material for separators. In this study, we investigate the
microscopic electrical conductivity of the intrinsic passive oxide film on such
ferritic stainless steel. Through advanced surface characterization techniques
such as current sensing atomic force microscopy and scanning tunneling
microscopy/spectroscopy, we discover highly conductive regions within the film
that vary depending on location. These findings provide valuable insights into
the behavior of the passive oxide film in fuel cells. By understanding the
microscopic electrical properties, we can enhance the design and performance of
separator materials in hydrogen fuel cells. Ultimately, this research
contributes to a broader understanding of separator materials and supports the
wider application of hydrogen fuel cells.

The sustainable development of next-generation device technology is paramount
in the face of climate change and the looming energy crisis. Tremendous efforts
have been made in the discovery and design of nanomaterials that achieve
device-level sustainability, where high performance and low operational energy
cost are prioritized. However, many of such materials are composed of elements
that are under threat of depletion and pose elevated risks to the environment.
The role of material-level sustainability in computational screening efforts
remains an open question thus far. Here we develop a general van der Waals
materials screening framework imbued with sustainability-motivated search
criteria. Using ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) materials as a backdrop -- an emerging
materials class with great prospects in dielectric, power electronics, and
ultraviolet device applications, we demonstrate how this screening framework
results in 25 sustainable UWBG layered materials comprising only of low-risks
elements. Our findings constitute a critical first-step towards reinventing a
more sustainable electronics landscape beyond silicon, with the framework
established in this work serving as a harbinger of sustainable 2D materials
discovery.

<h3>Multiscale insight into the Cd1-xZnxTe vibrational-mechanical properties  -- High-pressure experiments and ab initio calculations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14539" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14539</a>

<br>
<br>
The Cd1-xZnxTe semiconductor alloy is a regular system regarding its
macroscopic mechanic properties in that its experimental bulk modulus exhibits
a linear x-dependence, in line with ab initio predictions. Complexity arises at
the bond scale, referring to the intricate Cd1-xZnxTe percolation-type Raman
pattern [T. Alhaddad et al., Journal of Applied Physics 133, 065701 (2023)].
This offers an appealing benchmark to test various phonon coupling processes at
diverse length scales in a compact multi-oscillator assembly, presently tuned
by pressure. At x around 0, an inter-bond long-range/macro electric coupling
between the matrix and impurity polar phonons is detuned under pressure.
Inversely, at x around 1, an intra-bond short-range/nano mechanic coupling is
enforced between the two Zn Te apolar sub-phonons stemming from same and alien
percolation-type environments. The pressure-induced macro/nano polar/apolar
coupling/decoupling processes are compared within a model of two coupled
electric/mechanic harmonic oscillators in terms of a compromise between
proximity to resonance and strength of coupling, impacting the degree of mode
mixing, with ab initio (apolar case) and analytical (polar case) Raman
calculations in support. Notably, the free mechanic coupling at x around 1
opposes the achievement of a phonon exceptional point, manifesting the
inhibition of mechanic coupling, earlier evidenced with similar bonds for x
smaller than 0.5. Hence, the pressure dependence of a given bond vibration in a
disordered alloy basically differs depending on whether the bond is
matrix-like, i.e., self-connected in bulk (free coupling), or dispersed, i.e.,
self-connected in a chain (inhibited coupling). This features pressure-tunable
percolation-based on-off phonon switches in complex media.

<h3>Instability and rupture of sheared viscous liquid nanofilms</h3>

<br>
<br>
Liquid nanofilms are ubiquitous in nature and technology, and their
equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium dynamics are key to a multitude of phenomena
and processes. We numerically study the evolution and rupture of viscous
nanometric films, incorporating the effects of surface tension, van der waals
forces, thermal fluctuations and viscous shear. We show that thermal
fluctuations create perturbations that can trigger film rupture, but they do
not significantly affect the growth rate of the perturbations. The film rupture
time can be predicted from a linear stability analysis of the governing thin
film equation, by considering the most unstable wavelength and the thermal
roughness. Furthermore, applying a sufficiently large unidirectional shear can
stabilise large perturbations, creating a finite-amplitude travelling wave
instead of film rupture. In contrast, in three dimensions, unidirectional shear
does not inhibit rupture, as perturbations are not suppressed in the direction
perpendicular to the applied shear. However, if the direction of shear varies
in time, the growth of large perturbations is prevented in all directions, and
rupture can hence be impeded.

<h3>Statistical Features of Systems driven by non Gaussian Processes: Theory  & Practice</h3>

<br>
<br>
Nowadays many tools, e.g. fluctuation relations, are available to
characterize the statistical properties of non-equilibrium systems. However,
most of these tools rely on the assumption that the driving noise is normally
distributed. Here we consider a class of Markov processes described by Langevin
equations driven by a mixture of Gaussian and Poissonian noises, focusing on
their non-equilibrium properties. In particular, we prove that detailed balance
does not hold even when correlation functions are symmetric under time
reversal. In such cases, a breakdown of the time reversal symmetry can be
highlighted by considering higher order correlation functions. Furthermore, the
entropy production may be different from zero even for vanishing currents. We
provide analytical expressions for the average entropy production rate in
several cases. We also introduce a scale dependent estimate for entropy
production, suitable for inference from experimental signals. The empirical
entropy production allows us to discuss the role of spatial and temporal
resolutions in characterizing non-equilibrium features. Finally, we revisit the
Brownian gyrator introducing an additional Poissonian noise showing that it
behaves as a two dimensional linear ratchet. It has also the property that when
Onsager relations are satisfied its entropy production is positive although it
is minimal. We conclude discussing estimates of entropy production for
partially accessible systems, comparing our results with the lower bound
provided by the thermodynamics uncertainty relations.

<h3>Elucidating Interfacial Dynamics of Ti-Al Systems Using Molecular  Dynamics Simulation and Markov State Modeling</h3>

<br>
<br>
Due to their remarkable mechanical and chemical properties, Ti-Al based
materials are attracting considerable interest in numerous fields of
engineering, such as automotive, aerospace, and defense. With their low
density, high strength, and resistance to corrosion and oxidation, these
intermetallic alloys and compound metal-metallic composites have found diverse
applications. The present study delves into the interfacial dynamics of these
Ti-Al systems, particularly focusing on the behavior of Ti and Al atoms in the
presence of TiAl$_3$ grain boundaries under experimental heat treatment
conditions. Using a combination of Molecular Dynamics and Markov State Model
analyses, we scrutinize the kinetic processes involved in the formation of
TiAl$_3$. The Molecular Dynamics simulation indicates that at the early stage
of heat treatment, the predominating process is the diffusion of Al atoms
towards the Ti surface through the TiAl$_3$ grain boundaries. The Markov State
Modeling identifies three distinct dynamic states of Al atoms within the Ti/Al
mixture that forms during the process, each exhibiting a unique spatial
distribution. Using transition timescales as a qualitative measure of the
rapidness of the dynamics, it is observed that the Al dynamics is significantly
less rapid near the Ti surface compared to the Al surface. Put together, the
results offer a comprehensive understanding of the interfacial dynamics and
reveals a three-stage diffusion mechanism. The process initiates with the
premelting of Al, proceeds with the prevalent diffusion of Al atoms towards the
Ti surface, and eventually ceases as the Ti concentration within the mixture
progressively increases. The insights gained from this study could contribute
significantly to the control and optimization of manufacturing processes for
these high-performing Ti-Al based materials.

We report the properties of two new series of compounds that show the
ferroelectric nematic phase in which the length of a terminal chain is varied.
The longer the terminal chain, the weaker the dipole-dipole interactions of the
molecules are along the director, and thus the lower the temperature at which
the axially ferroelectric nematic phase is formed. For homologues of
intermediate chain length, between the non-polar and ferroelectric nematic
phases, there is a wide temperature range nematic phase with antiferroelectric
character. The size of the antiparallel ferroelectric domains critically
increases upon transition to the ferroelectric phase. In dielectric studies,
both collective ("ferroelectric" and non-collective fluctuations are present,
the "ferroelectric" mode softens weakly at the N-NX phase transition because
the polar order in this phase is weak. The transition to the NF phase is
characterized by a much stronger lowering of the mode relaxation frequency and
an increase in its strength, typical critical behavior is observed.

The structure-properties relationship of rhamnolipids, RLs, well known
microbial bioamphiphiles (biosurfactants), is exlored in detail by coupling
cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and both ex situ and in

reasoned variation of their molecular structure (RhaC10, RhaC10C10 and

broad pH range and RhaC10C10 undergoes a micelle-to-vesicle transition from
basic to acid pH occurring at pH 6.5. Modelling coupled to fitting SAXS data

<br>
The random-field spin-1/2 XXZ chains, and the corresponding Anderson
insulators of spinless fermions with density-density interaction, have been
intensively studied in the context of many-body localization. However, we
recently argued [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 260601(2022)] that the two-body
density-density interaction in these models is not generic since only a small
fraction of this interaction represents a true local perturbation to the
Anderson insulator. Here we study ergodicity of strongly disordered Anderson
insulator chains choosing other forms of the two-body interaction for which the
strength of the true perturbation is of the same order of magnitude as the bare
two-body interaction. Focusing on the strong interaction regime, numerical
results for the level statistics and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis
are consistent with emergence of ergodicity at arbitrary strong disorder.

<h3>Photon Correlations in Colloidal Quantum Dot Molecules Controlled by the  Neck Barrier</h3>

We investigate the charge re-distribution upon optical excitation of various
necked homodimer CQDMs using single particle emission spectroscopy. By tuning
the hybridization of the electron wavefunction at a fixed center-to-center
distance through controlling the neck girth, we reveal two coupling limits. On
one hand a connected-but-confined situation where neighbouring CQDs are weakly
fused to each other manifesting a weak coupling regime, and on the other hand,
a connected-and-delocalized situation, where the neck is filled beyond the
facet size leading to a rod-like architecture manifesting strong-coupling.
Either coupling regimes entrust distinct optical signatures clearly resolved at
room temperature in terms of photoluminescence quantum yield, intensity time
traces, lifetimes, and spectra of the neutral-exciton, charged-exciton, and
biexciton states. The interplay between the radiative and non-radiative Auger
decays of these states, turns emitted photons from the CQDMs in the
weak-coupling regime highly bunched unlike CQD monomers, while the antibunching
is regained at the strong-coupling regime. This behavior correlates with the
hybridization energy being smaller than the thermal energy (kT approx. 25meV)
at the weak-coupling limit (delta E approax.5-10meV), leading to exciton
localization suppressing Auger decay. In the neck-filled architectures, the
larger hybridization energy (delta E approx.20-30meV) leads to exciton
delocalization while activating the fast charged and multi-exciton Auger decay
processes. This work sets an analogy for the artificial molecule CQDMs with
regular molecules, where the two distinct regimes of weak- and strong-coupling
correspond to ionic- or covalent- type bonding, respectively.

<h3>Dispersion of Multiferroic Nanoparticles in a Bent-Core Nematic Liquid  Crystal: Experimental and Theoretical Study</h3>

A novel nanocomposite system has been prepared by dispersing multiferroic
bismuth ferrite nanoparticles (BiFeO$_3$) in a bent-core nematic liquid crystal
(8-F-OH) that exhibits cybotactic clusters. Transition temperature, optical
textures, order parameter (\emph{S$_{m}$}), and dielectric spectroscopy
experiments are performed in the doped system, and the results are compared
with the pure one. The main experimental outcome is that the doped system has
increased orientational order parameters, even though the cybotactic cluster
size is reduced due to the incorporation of multiferroic BiFeO$_3$
nanoparticles. The transition temperature, as observed under polarising optical
microscopy, clearly indicates a reduction of $1 - 2~ ^\circ{\rm C}$ in the
doped system compared to the pure one, and we conjecture this is due to the
disordering of the cybotactic cluster in the doped system. Based on the
experimental findings, a Landau-de Gennes-type free energy model is developed.
The model qualitatively explains the increased mean order parameter and the
disordering of cybotactic clusters with increasing polarization value of
nanoparticles. This is corroborated by experimental findings.

Doped heavy metal-free III-V semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots are of
great interest both from the fundamental aspects of doping in highly confined
structures, and from the applicative side of utilizing such building blocks in
the fabrication of p-n homojunction devices. InAs nanocrystals, that are of
particular relevance for short wave IR detection and emission applications,
manifest heavy n-type character poising a challenge for their transition to
p-type behavior. We present p-type doping of InAs nanocrystals with Zn-enabling
control over the charge carrier type in InAs QDs field effect transistors. The
post-synthesis doping reaction mechanism is studied for Zn precursors with
varying reactivity. Successful p-type doping was achieved by the more reactive
precursor, diethylzinc. Substitutional doping by Zn2+ replacing In3+ is
established by X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis. Furthermore, enhanced
near IR photoluminescence is observed due to surface passivation by Zn as
indicated from elemental mapping utilizing high resolution electron microscopy
corroborated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study. The demonstrated
ability to control the carrier type, along with the improved emission
characteristics, paves the way towards fabrication of optoelectronic devices
active in the short wave IR region utilizing heavy-metal free nanocrystal
building blocks.

The Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 (CZTSSe) emerging inorganic solar cell is highly
promising for accelerating the large-scale and low-cost applications of
thin-film photovoltaics. It possesses distinct advantages such as abundant and
non-toxic constituent elements, high material stability, and excellent
compatibility with industrial processes. However, CZTSSe solar cells still face
challenges related to complex defects and charge losses. To overcome these
limitations and improve the efficiency of CZTSSe solar cells, it is crucial to
experimentally identify and mitigate deep defects. In this study, we reveal
that the dominant deep defect in CZTSSe materials exhibits donor
characteristics. We propose that incomplete cation exchange during the
multi-step crystallization reactions of CZTSSe is the kinetics mechanism
responsible for the defect formation. To address this issue, we introduce an
elemental synergistic alloying approach aimed at weakening the metal-chalcogen
bond strength and the stability of intermediate phases. This alloying strategy
has facilitated the kinetics of cation exchange, leading to a significant
reduction in charge losses within the CZTSSe absorber. As a result, we have
achieved a cell efficiency of over 14.5%. These results represent a significant
advancement for emerging inorganic solar cells and additionally bring more
opportunities for the precise identification and regulation of defects in a
wider range of multinary inorganic compounds.

Ultrafast and coherent generation of magnons is of great significance for
high-speed antiferromagnetic spintronics. One possible route is by
exciton-magnon pairwise optical excitation. To date, such exciton-magnon
transitions have been studied mostly by linear optical means in a limited
number of conventional three-dimensional antiferromagnets. Here we investigate
this correlated transition in van der Waals antiferromagnet MnPS$_3$ by using
resonant second-harmonic generation spectroscopy, a nonlinear optical probe
sensitive to the symmetry of electronic and magnetic excitations. Two
exciton-magnon peaks are observed, in line with the exciton-induced splitting
of magnon density of states predicted by a Koster-Slater type theory,
indicating significant exciton-magnon interactions. In addition, a large linear
magnetoelectric effect of excitons is observed. These findings provide renewed
understandings on the correlation effects in two-dimensional magnets with
enhanced quasiparticle scattering cross-sections, and point to potential
coherent control among charge, spin and orbital degrees of freedom in
two-dimensional magnets by optical means.

We propose and study a one-dimensional (1D) model consisting of two lanes
with open boundaries. One of the lanes executes diffusive and the other lane
driven unidirectional or asymmetric exclusion dynamics, which are mutually
coupled through particle exchanges in the bulk. We elucidate the generic
nonuniform steady states in this model. We show that the nonequilibrium steady
states of this model can be controlled by the ratio of the diffusive and
directed motion time-scales, which can be tuned to achieve phase coexistence in
the asymmetric exclusion dynamics and spatially smoothly varying density in the
diffusive dynamics in the steady state. We obtain phase diagrams of the model
by using mean field theories, and corroborate and complement the results by
stochastic Monte Carlo simulations. This model reduces to an isolated open
totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) and an open TASEP with bulk
particle nonconserving Langmuir kinetics (LK), respectively, in the limits of
vanishing and diverging particle diffusivity in the lane executing diffusive
dynamics. Thus this model works as an overarching general model, connecting
both pure TASEPs and TASEPs with LK in different asymptotic limits.

The process of fluctuations of trajectory observables of stochastic systems
is associated with processes with independent increments from the risk theory.
Boundary problems are considered: first-passage times (times when a certain
value of the variable is first reached), overjumps at the moments of the
first-passage times to reach positive and negative levels. A correspondence
between the expressions of the theory of random processes and thermodynamics of
trajectories is established, as well as deviations from such a correspondence
for the process of fluctuations of trajectory observables. Relations between
the general regularities of the first-passage times in the theory of random
processes and thermodynamics of trajectories are discussed. A more complete use
of the theory of random processes in physical problems is proposed, the
possibilities of combining the approaches of the theory of random processes and
statistical physics are indicated.

Motivated by the recent experiments [Chen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett 121, 113204

low-lying excitation spectrum of the ground-state phases of
spin-orbital-angular-momentum-coupled (SOAM-coupled) spin-1 condensates. At
vanishing detuning, a ferromagnetic SOAM-coupled spin-1 BEC can have two
ground-state phases, namely coreless and polar-core vortex states, whereas an
antiferromagnetic BEC supports only polar-core vortex solution. The angular
momentum per particle, longitudinal magnetization, and excitation frequencies
display discontinuities across the phase boundary between the two phases. The
low-lying excitation spectrum evaluated by solving the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes
equations is marked by avoided crossings and hence the hybridization of the
spin and density channels. The spectrum is further confirmed by the dynamical
evolution of the ground state subjected to a perturbation suitable to excite a
density or a spin mode and a variational analysis for the density-breathing
mode

Hard X-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals the
momentum-resolved band structure in an epitaxial Mn2Au(001) film capped by a 2
nm thick ferromagnetic Permalloy layer. By magnetizing the Permalloy capping
layer, the exceptionally strong exchange bias aligns the Neel vector in the
Mn2Au(001) film accordingly. Uncompensated interface Mn magnetic moments in
Mn2Au were identified as the origin of the exchange bias using X-ray magnetic
circular dichroism in combination with photoelectron emission microscopy. Using
time-of-flight momentum microscopy, we measure the asymmetry of the band
structure in Mn2Au resulting from the homogeneous orientation of the Neel
vector. Comparison with theory shows that the Neel vector, determined by the
magnetic moment of the top Mn layer, is antiparallel to the Permalloy
magnetization. The experimental results demonstrate that hard X-ray
photoemission spectroscopy can measure the band structure of epitaxial layers
beneath a metallic capping layer and corroborate the asymmetric band structure
in Mn2Au that was previously inferred only indirectly.

We theoretically calculate the fundamental noise that is present in gaseous

where the Fermi-Dirac and Bose- Einstein distribution must be considered.
Results for both regimes are analogous to their electrical counterparts. The
quantum noise is calculated for a two terminal system and is a complicated
function of the thermal and shot noise with the thermal noise dominating when
$2k_BT >> m\Delta P$ and vice versa. The cumulant generating function for mass
flow, which generates all the higher order statistics related to our mass flow
distribution, is also derived and is used to find an expression for the third

crystal and magnetic structures of CsO2, and observe a complex series of
structures on cooling from room temperature to 1.6 K. These include an
incommensurate modulation along the a-axis of the structure at intermediate
temperatures, which then locks into a commensurate modulation that doubles the
unit cell compared to the previously supposed orthorhombic unit cell. In both
incommensurate and commensurate phases our structural solution involves a
staggering of the cesium ion positions along the b-axis, in contrast to studies
of other alkali superoxides in which staggered tilts of the O2- dimers relative
to the c-axis are seen. Below T ~ 10 K we observe magnetic Bragg reflections
arising from an antiferromagnetically ordered structure with a wavevector of k
= (0,0,0) (relative to the doubled crystallographic unit cell), with moments
that point predominantly along the b-axis with a small component along the
a-axis that hints at possible anisotropic exchange coupling (consistent with
the crystal structure). Measurements of the magnetic Bragg reflections in an
applied magnetic field suggest a spin-flop transition takes place between 2 T
and 4 T in which moments likely flop to point along the crystallographic
a-axis. Our measurements indicate that CsO2 is an interesting example of
magnetic properties being inherently linked to the crystal structure, in that
the staggered displacement of the cesium ions activates antisymmetric exchange
which then permits the observed spin canting.

In this study, we systematically investigated the mechanical response of
monolayer molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) using molecular dynamics simulations.
The tensile behavior of the trigonal prismatic phase (2H phase) MoTe2 under
uniaxial strain was simulated in both the armchair and zigzag directions. We
also investigated the crack formation and propagation in both armchair and
zigzag directions at 10K and 300K to understand the fracture behavior of
monolayer MoTe2. The crack simulations show clean cleavage for the armchair
direction and the cracks were numerous and scattered in the case of the zigzag
direction. Finally, we investigated the effect of temperature on Young's
modulus and fracture stress of monolayer MoTe2. The results show that at a
strain rate of 10^-4 ps^-1, the fracture strength of 2H-MoTe2 in the armchair
and zigzag direction at 10K is 16.33 GPa (11.43 N/m) and 13.71429 GPa (9.46
N/m) under a 24% and 18% fracture strain, respectively. The fracture strength
of 2H-MoTe2 in the armchair and zigzag direction at 600K is 10.81 GPa (7.56
N/m) and 10.13 GPa (7.09 N/m) under a 12.5% and 12.47% fracture strain,
respectively. Although experimental results on MoTe2 are limited for a wide
range of temperatures, we have found that Young's modulus agrees with existing
literature for pristine MoTe2. For 2H-MoTe2 in both armchair and zigzag
directions, the fracture stresses, fracture strengths, and Young's modulus
decrease as the temperature rises, resulting from the increased atomic thermal
vibrations.

Spin-1/2 kagome materials have recently attracted a resurgence of interest as
they are considered an ideal host of the quantum spin liquid (QSL) state, which
can underpin functionality such as superconductivity. Here we report the first
synthesis and characterization of a new oxide-based distorted $S=1/2$ kagome
antiferromagnet (KAFM) in the Zn$_x$Cu$_{5-x}$(VO$_4$)$_{2}$O$_2$CsCl (termed
Zn$\mathbf {_x}$) series, namely Zn$_2$-averievite, Zn$\mathbf {_2}$ ($x=2$).
Using magnetometry, synchrotron diffraction and neutron scattering we
demonstrate an evolution of ground states with $x$ in Zn$\mathbf {_x}$; from
long-range magnetic order in averievite ($x=0$), via a spin-glass-like ground
state in Zn$\mathbf {_1}$, to a quantum spin liquid (QSL) in Zn$\mathbf {_2}$
for which inelastic neutron scattering reveals a gapless continuum of
excitations. Similar to archetypal $S = 1/2$ KAFMs herbertsmithite and
SrCr$_{8.19}$Ga$_{3.81}$O$_{19}$ (SCGO), the dynamic magnetic susceptibility of
Zn$\mathbf {_2}$ shows scaling behavior consistent with proximity to a quantum
critical point. The results demonstrate that the new Zn$\mathbf {_2}$ material
is an excellent test bed for achieving the elusive goal of charge carrier
doping in QSL states of $S = 1/2$ KAFMs, in-line with previous theoretical
studies.

<h3>Control of the vortex lattice formation in coupled atom-molecular  Bose-Einstein condensate in a double well potential: Role of atom-molecule  coupling, trap rotation frequency and detuning</h3>

We study the vortex formation in coupled atomic and molecular condensates in
a rotating double well trap by numerically solving the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii
like equations. Starting with the atomic condensate in the double well
potential we considered two-photon Raman photoassociation for coherent
conversion of atoms to molecules. It is shown that the competition between
atom-molecule coupling strength and repulsive atom-molecule interaction
controls the spacings between atomic and molecular vortices and the rotation
frequency of the trap is the key player for controlling the number of visible
atomic and molecular vortices. Whereas the Raman detuning controls the spacing
between atomic and molecular vortices as well as the number of atomic and
molecular vortices in the trap. We have shown by considering the molecular
lattices the distance between two molecular vortices can be controlled by
varying the Raman detuning. In addition we have found that the Feynman rule
relating the total number of vortices and average angular momentum both for
atoms and molecules can be satisfied by considering the atomic and molecular
vortices those are hidden in density distribution and seen as singularities in
phase distribution of the coupled system except for the lattice structure where
molecular vortices are overlapped with each other. It is found that although
the number of visible/core vortices in atomic and molecular vortex lattices
depends significantly on the system parameters the number of atomic and
molecular hidden vortices remains constant in most of the cases.

<br>
<br>
We study the excitation spectrum of the one-dimensional spin-1/2 XXZ chain
with antiferromagnetic Ising anisotropy across a magnetic quantum phase
transition induced by the application of a site-dependent transverse magnetic
field. Motivated by the chain antiferromagnet BaCo$_2$V$_2$O$_8$, we consider a
situation where the transverse magnetic field has a strong uniform component
and a weaker staggered part. To determine the nature of the excitations giving
rise to the spin dynamical structure factor, we use a combination of analytical
approaches and the numerically exact time-dependent matrix product state
method. We identify below the quantum phase transition high-energy many-body
two-magnon and three-magnon repulsively bound states which are clearly visible
due to the staggered component of the magnetic field. At high magnetic fields
and low temperature, single magnons dominate the dynamics. Our theory results
are in very good agreement with terahertz spectroscopy experimental results
presented in [Wang et al., in preparation].

Symmetry plays a key role in determining the physical properties of
materials. By Neumann's principle, the properties of a material are invariant
under the symmetry operations of the space group to which the material belongs.
Continuous phase transitions are associated with a spontaneous reduction in
symmetry. (For example, the onset of ferromagnetism spontaneously breaks time
reversal symmetry.) Much less common are examples where proximity to a
continuous phase transition leads to an increase in symmetry. Here, we find an
emergent tetragonal symmetry close to an apparent charge density wave (CDW)
bicritical point in a fundamentally orthorhombic material, ErTe$_3$, for which
the CDW phase transitions are tuned via anisotropic strain. The underlying
structure of the material remains orthorhombic for all applied strains,
including at the bicritical point, due to a glide plane symmetry in the crystal
structure. Nevertheless, the observation of a divergence in the anisotropy of
the in-plane elastoresistivity reveals an emergent electronic tetragonality
near the bicritical point.

Finding a theoretical formula for the persistence length of polyelectrolytes
for the whole experimental range of salt concentration is a long standing
challenge. Using the Tethered Particle Motion technique, the double-stranded
DNA persistence length is measured for four monovalent and divalent salts on a
three-decade concentration range. The formula proposed by Trizac and Shen [EPL,
116 18007 (2016)] and extended to divalent ions fits the data. This formula
mixes the high salt limit solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation together
with the DNA charge renormalisation. Magnesium ions induce a fitted DNA radius
smaller than the geometrical one, consistent with a site-specific binding.

<h3>Impact of strain and surface reconstruction on long-range diffusion of  Ge atoms on Ge(111) surface</h3>

<br>
<i>R. A. Zhachuk, A. V. Latyshev, J. Coutinho</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the effect of surface reconstruction and strain on diffusion
of adsorbed Ge atoms on Ge$(111)\textrm{-}5\times5$ and
Ge$(111)\textrm{-}7\times7$ surfaces by means of first principles calculations.
Stable adsorption sites, their energies, diffusion paths, and corresponding
activation barriers are reported. We demonstrate that the decisive migration
path is located near the corner holes of surface structures, and they are
associated with formation of weak bonds between the adsorbed Ge atom and
surface dimers (within the $5\times5$ or $7\times7$ structures). The results
show that Ge diffusion rates on $5\times5$ and $7\times7$ reconstructed
Ge$(111)$ surfaces should be similar. Conversely, the diffusion barrier on a
compressively strained Ge$(111)$ surface is considerably higher than that on a
strain-free surface, thus explaining previous experimental results. Comparable
diffusion rates on $5\times5$ and $7\times7$ reconstructed surfaces are
explained by the identical local atomic arrangements of these structures. The
increase of the migration barrier on a strained surface is explained by dimer
bond strengthening upon surface compression, along with a weakening of bonds
between the adsorbed Ge and dimer atoms.

<h3>Non-Hermitian chiral anomalies in interacting systems</h3>

The emergence of chiral anomaly entails various fascinating phenomena such as
anomalous quantum Hall effect and chiral magnetic effect in different branches
of (non-)Hermitian physics. While in the single-particle picture, anomalous
currents merely appear due to the coupling of massless particles with
background fields, many-body interactions can also be responsible for anomalous
transport in interacting systems. In this Letter, we study anomalous chiral
currents in systems where interacting massless fermions with complex Fermi
velocities are coupled to complex gauge fields. Our results reveal that
incorporating non-Hermiticity and many-body interactions gives rise to
additional terms in anomalous relations beyond their Hermitian counterparts. We
further present that many-body corrections in the subsequent non-Hermitian
chiral magnetic field or anomalous Hall effect are nonvanishing in
nonequilibrium or inhomogeneous systems. Our results advance efforts in
understanding the anomalous transport in interacting non-Hermitian systems.

Magnetic skyrmions are particle-like spin-swirling objects ubiquitously
realized in magnets. They are topologically stable chiral kinks composed of
multiple modulation waves of spiral spin structures, where the helicity of each
spiral is usually selected by antisymmetric exchange interactions in
noncentrosymmetric crystals. We report an experimental observation of a
distorted triangular lattice of skyrmions in the polar tetragonal magnet
EuNiGe$_3$, reflecting a strong coupling with the lattice. Moreover, through
resonant x-ray diffraction, we find that the magnetic helicity of the original
spiral at zero field is reversed when the skyrmion lattice is formed in a
magnetic field. This means that the energy gain provided by the skyrmion
lattice formation is larger than the antisymmetric exchange interaction. Our
findings will lead us to a further understanding of emergent magnetic states.

This feature article presents insights concerning the correlation of PECVD
and PEALD thin film structures with their barrier or membrane properties. While
in principle similar precursor gases and processes can be applied, the
adjustment of deposition parameters for different polymer substrates can lead
to either an effective diffusion barrier or selective permeabilities. In both
cases the understanding of the film growth and the analysis of the pore size
distribution and the pore surface chemistry is of utmost importance for the
understanding of the related transport properties of small molecules. In this
regard the article presents both concepts of thin film engineering and
analytical as well as theoretical approaches leading to a comprehensive
description of the state of the art in this field. Moreover, based on the
presented correlation of film structure and molecular transport properties
perspectives of future relevant research in this area is presented.

<h3>Mesoscale mode coupling theory for the weakly asymmetric simple  exclusion process</h3>

The asymmetric simple exclusion process and its analysis by mode coupling
theory (MCT) is reviewed. To treat the weakly asymmetric case at large space
scale $x\varepsilon^{-1}$, %(corresponding to small Fourier momentum at scale
$p\varepsilon$), large time scale $t \varepsilon^{-\chi}$ and weak hopping bias
$b \varepsilon^{\kappa}$ in the limit $\varepsilon \to 0$ we develop a
mesoscale MCT that allows for studying the crossover at $\kappa=1/2$ and
$\chi=2$ from Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) to Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) universality.
The dynamical structure function is shown to satisfy for all $\kappa$ an
integral equation that is independent of the microscopic model parameters and
has a solution that yields a scale-invariant function with the KPZ dynamical
exponent $z=3/2$ at scale $\chi=3/2+\kappa$ for $0\leq\kappa<1/2$ and for
$\chi=2$ the exact Gaussian EW solution with $z=2$ for $\kappa>1/2$. At the
crossover point it is a function of both scaling variables which converges at
macroscopic scale to the conventional MCT approximation of KPZ universality for
$\kappa<1/2$. This fluctuation pattern confirms long-standing conjectures for
$\kappa \leq 1/2$ and is in agreement with mathematically rigorous results for
$\kappa>1/2$ despite the numerous uncontrolled approximations on which MCT is
based.

We report the successful synthesis of a new 4$d$ based polycrystalline
inverse Heusler alloy Fe$_2$RuGe by an arc melting process and have studied in
detail its structural, magnetic and transport properties complemented with
first principle calculations. X-ray and neutron diffraction, Extended X-ray
Absorption Fine Structure and $^{57}$Fe M\"{o}ssbauer spectroscopic studies
confirm the single phase nature of the system where the Fe and Ru atoms are
randomly distributed in the 4$c$ and 4$d$ Wyckoff positions in a ratio close to
50:50. The formation of the disordered structure is also confirmed by the
theoretical energy minimization calculation. Despite the random cross-site
disorder of Fe and Ru atoms, magnetic measurements suggest not only a high
Curie temperature of $\sim$860\,K, but also a large saturation magnetic moment
$\sim$4.9\,$\mu_B$ per formula unit at 5\,K, considerably exceeding the
theoretical limit (4\,$\mu_B$ per formula unit) predicted by the Slater-Pauling
rule. Only a few Fe-based inverse Heusler alloys are known to exhibit such high
Curie temperatures. Neutron diffraction analysis coupled with the isothermal
magnetization value indicates that the magnetic moments in Fe$_2$RuGe are
associated with Fe-atoms only, which is also confirmed by M\"ossbauer
spectrometry. Interestingly, in comparison to the cubic or hexagonal phase of
the parent compound, Fe$_3$Ge, the Curie temperature of Fe$_2$RuGe has
increased significantly despite the substitution of the nonmagnetic, yet
isoelectronic element Ru in this structurally disordered compound. Our
theoretical calculation reveals that the large Fe moment ($\sim2.8\mu_B$/Fe) on
the 4$b$ site can be attributed to a charge transfer from this Fe site towards
its Ru neighbours. Such a substantial increase in magnetic moment due to
electron charge transfer has not previously been reported in a Heusler alloy
system.

The half-Heusler alloy RuMnGa having valence electron count (VEC) 18 has
recently been theoretically proposed to exhibit compensated ferrimagnetic
(CFiM) character instead of the expected nonmagnetic ground state. On the other
hand, a preliminary experimental study proposed ferromagnetic (FM) ordering. As
no half-Heusler system with VEC 18 is known to exhibit magnetic ordering, we
have investigated the details of crystal structure and magnetic properties of
RuMnGa using a combination of experimental tools, viz., x-ray and neutron
diffraction techniques, dc and ac susceptibility, isothermal magnetisation,
heat capacity, resistivity and neutron depolarisation measurements. Rietveld
refinements of x-ray and neutron diffraction data suggest single phase nature
of the compound with elemental composition RuMn$_{0.86}$Ga$_{1.14}$. We have
shown that the system exhibits FM-type ordering owing to the inherent presence
of this minor off-stoichiometry, showing very low magnetic moment. The system
also exhibits reentrant canonical spin-glass behaviour, which is rarely
observed in half-Heusler alloys. The temperature coefficient of resistivity
changes its sign from negative to positive and further to negative as the
temperature decreases.

We study Kitaev-Heisenberg-$\Gamma$ Hamiltonian on finite size clusters and
investigate various zero and finite temperature properties in detail and
explore the key differences due to relative sign and magnitude of Kitaev($K$),
Heisenberg $(J)$) and $\Gamma$ interaction in the presence of magnetic field.
Nearest-neighbor spin-spin correlation function shows step like character when
$J$ is positive only irrespective of sign of $K$. Similarly the low energy
spectrum under magnetic field depends on the sign of $K$. Dynamics of Majorana
fermions depend greatly on external magnetic field which can even stabilize the
gauge fields to Kitaev limit in the presence of $J$. Majorana dynamics also
shows that $K-J-\Gamma$ model to be a testbed to manipulate quantum speed
limit. For small magnetic field, magnetization shows a dome like structure for
an intermediate temperature range for positive $K$. However a positive $J$ can
cause this for negative $K$ also. The zero temperature magnetisation and
susceptibility shows large dependence on external magnetic field and relative
sign and magnitude of $K$ and $J$. Either a negative $K$ or $J$ is shown to
give qualitatively similar susceptibility for different magnetic field only.
For the specific heat a negative $K$ or $J$ favors mostly single peak structure
while a two peak structure is favored for positive $K$ or $J$, though the
magnitude of magnetic field can causes re-entrant behavior also. We briefly
discuss effect of $\Gamma$ and compare with recent experiments.

Using \emph{ab initio} band structure and DFT+dynamical mean-field theory
methods we examine the effects of electron-electron interactions on the normal
state electronic structure, Fermi surface, and magnetic correlations of the
recently discovered double-layer perovskite superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
under pressure. Our results suggest the formation of a negative charge transfer
mixed-valence state with the Ni valence close to 1.75+. We find a remarkable
orbital-selective renormalization of the Ni $3d$ bands, with $m^*/m \sim 3$ and
2.3 for the Ni $3z^2-r^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ orbitals, respectively, in agreement
with experimental estimates. Our results for the {\bf k}-dependent spectral
functions and Fermi surfaces show significant incoherence of the Ni $3z^2-r^2$
states, implying the proximity of the Ni $3d$ states to orbital-dependent
localization. Our analysis of the static magnetic susceptibility suggests the
possible formation of the spin and charge (or bond) density wave stripe states.

The most widely used method for obtaining high-quality two-dimensional
materials is through mechanical exfoliation of bulk crystals. Manual
identification of suitable flakes from the resulting random distribution of
crystal thicknesses and sizes on a substrate is a time-consuming, tedious task.
Here, we present a platform for fully automated scanning, detection, and
classification of two-dimensional materials, the source code of which we make
openly available. Our platform is designed to be accurate, reliable, fast, and
versatile in integrating new materials, making it suitable for everyday
laboratory work. The implementation allows a fully automized scanning and
analysis of wafers with an average inference time of 100 ms for images of 2.3
Mpixels. The developed detection algorithm is based on a combination of the
flakes' optical contrast toward the substrate and their geometric shape. We
demonstrate that it is able to detect the majority of exfoliated flakes of
various materials, with an average recall (AR50) between 66\% and 92\%. We also
show that the algorithm can be trained with as few as five flakes of a given
material, which we demonstrate for the examples of few-layer graphene, WSe$_2$,
CrI$_3$, 1T-TaS$_2$ and hBN. Our platform has been tested over a two-year
period, during which more than 10$^6$ images of multiple different materials
were acquired by over 30 individual researchers.

Twisted bilayer (t-BL) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) attracted
considerable attention in recent years due to their distinctive electronic
properties, which arise due to the moire superlattices that lead to the
emergence of flat bands and correlated electron phenomena. Also, these
materials can exhibit interesting thermal properties, including a reduction in
thermal conductivity. In this article, we report the thermal conductivity of
monolayer (1L) and t-BL MoSe2 at some specific twist angles around two
symmetric stacking AB (0 degree) and AB' (60 degree) and one intermediate angle
31 (degree) using the optothermal Raman technique. The observed thermal
conductivity values are found to be 13, 23, and 30 W m-1K-1 for twist angle =
58 (degree), 31 (degree) and, 3 (degree) respectively, which is well supported
by our first-principles calculation results. The reduction in thermal
conductivity in t-BL MoSe2 compared to monolayer (38 W m-1K-1) can be explained
by the occurrence of phonon scattering caused by the formation of a moire
super-lattice. Herein, the emergence of multiple folded phonon branches and
modification in the Brillouin zone caused by in-plane rotation are also
accountable for the decrease in thermal conductivity observed in t-BL MoSe2.
The theoretical phonon lifetime study and electron localization function (ELF)
analysis further reveals the origin of angle-dependent thermal conductivity in
t-BL MoSe2. This work paves the way towards tuning the angle-dependent thermal
conductivity for any bilayer TMDCs system.
