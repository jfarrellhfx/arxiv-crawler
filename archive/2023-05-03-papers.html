<h3>i-SPin 2: An integrator for general spin-s Gross-Pitaevskii systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01675" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01675</a>
<br>
<i>Mudit Jain, Mustafa A. Amin, Han Pu</i>
<br>
<br>
We provide an algorithm for evolving general spin-$s$ Gross-Pitaevskii /
non-linear Schr\"odinger systems carrying a variety of interactions, where the
$2s+1$ components of the `spinor' field represent the different
spin-multiplicity states. We consider many nonrelativistic interactions up to
quartic order in the Schr\"odinger field (both short and long-range, and
spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions), including explicit
spin-orbit couplings. The algorithm allows for spatially varying external
and/or self-generated vector potentials that couple to the spin density of the
field. Our work can be used for scenarios ranging from laboratory systems such
as spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), to cosmological/astrophysical
systems such as self-interacting bosonic dark matter. As examples, we provide
results for two different setups of spin-$1$ BECs that employ a varying
magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling, respectively, and also collisions of
spin-$1$ solitons in dark matter. Our symplectic algorithm is second-order
accurate in time, and is extensible to the known higher-order accurate methods.

<h3>Frustration induced Itinerant Ferromagnetism of Fermions in Optical  Lattice</h3>

When the Fermi Hubbard model was first introduced sixty years ago, one of the
original motivations was to understand correlation effects in itinerant
ferromagnetism. In the past two decades, ultracold Fermi gas in an optical
lattice has been used to study the Fermi Hubbard model. However, the metallic
ferromagnetic correlation was observed only in a recent experiment using
frustrated lattices, and its underlying mechanism is not clear yet. In this
letter, we point out that, under the particle--hole transformation, the
single-particle ground state can exhibit double degeneracy in such a frustrated
lattice. Therefore, the low-energy state exhibits valley degeneracy,
reminiscent of multi-orbit physics in ferromagnetic transition metals. The
local repulsive interaction leads to the valley Hund's rule, responsible for
the observed ferromagnetism. We generalize this mechanism to distorted
honeycomb lattices and square lattices with flux. This mechanism was first
discussed by M\"uller-Hartmann in a simpler one-dimension model. However, this
mechanism has not been widely discussed and has not been related to
experimental observations before. Hence, our study not only explains the
experimental findings but also enriches our understanding of itinerant
ferromagnetism.

<h3>Exciton and light induced ferromagnetism from doping a moiré Mott  insulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01702" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01702</a>

Significant efforts have been dedicated to achieving excitonic insulators. In
this paper, we explore a new problem of doping excitons into a Mott insulator
instead of a band insulator. Specifically, we start with a Mott insulator on a
triangular moir\'e superlattice in a transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD)
layer and inject excitons by either transferring particles to a different layer
or optically pumping electrons from the valence to the conduction band. In both
cases, the excitons move in the presence of local spin moments inherited from
the Mott insulator. When the Heisenberg spin coupling $J$ is small, the kinetic
energy of the excitons decides the magnetism, akin to Nagaoka ferromagnetism in
hole-doped Mott insulators. Through density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
calculations, we demonstrate that the spin moments originating from the Mott
insulator form $120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic order for the two
signs of the exciton hoppings over a broad range of exciton densities. Notably,
the optical pump case may result in an antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic
transition with increasing exciton density, indicating a potential mechanism
for light-induced ferromagnetism. A similar exciton-induced ferromagnetism
could be achieved in a moir\'e-monolayer system where the monolayer is
electron-doped while the moir\'e Mott insulator is hole-doped. Our works
demonstrates a new possibility to engineering magnetism through doping neutral
excitons.

<h3>Paradoxical nature of negative mobility in the weak dissipation regime</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01740" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01740</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We reinvestigate a paradigmatic model of nonequilibrium statistical physics
consisting of an inertial Brownian particle in a symmetric periodic potential
subjected to both a time--periodic force and a static bias. In doing so we
focus on the negative mobility phenomenon in which the average velocity of the
particle is opposite to the constant force acting on it. Surprisingly, we find
that in the weak dissipation regime thermal fluctuations induce negative
mobility much more frequently than it happens if the dissipation is stronger.
In particular, for the very first time we report a parameter set in which
thermal noise causes this effect in the nonlinear response regime. Moreover, we
show that the coexistence of deterministic negative mobility and chaos is
routinely encountered when approaching the overdamped limit in which chaos does
not emerge rather than near the Hamiltonian regime of which chaos is one of the
hallmarks. On the other hand, at non-zero temperature the negative mobility in
the weak dissipation regime is typically affected by the weak ergodicity
breaking. Our findings can be corroborated experimentally in a multitude of
physical realizations including e.g.~Josephson junctions and cold atoms
dwelling in optical lattices.

<h3>Exciton-phonon Coupling Controls Exciton-polaron Formation and Hot  Carrier Relaxation in Rigid Dion-Jacobson Type Two-Dimensional Perovskites</h3>

<br>
<br>
The efficiency of two-dimensional Dion-Jacobson-type materials relies on the
complex interplay between electronic and lattice dynamics; however, questions
remain about the functional role of exciton-phonon interactions. This study
establishes the robust polaronic nature of the excitons in these materials at
room temperature by combining ultrafast spectroscopy and electronic structural
calculations. We show that polaronic distortion is associated with
low-frequency (30-60 cm-1) lead iodide octahedral lattice motions. More
importantly, we discover how targeted ligand modification of this
two-dimensional perovskite structure controls exciton-phonon coupling,
exciton-polaron population, and carrier cooling. At high excitation density,
stronger exciton-phonon coupling increases the hot carrier lifetime, forming a
hot-phonon bottleneck. Our study provides detailed insight into the
exciton-phonon coupling and its role in carrier cooling in two-dimensional
perovskites relevant for developing emerging hybrid semiconductor materials
with tailored properties.

<h3>A Novel Mechanism for the Formation of Dislocation Cell Patterns in BCC  Metal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01744" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01744</a>
<br>
<i>Jaehyun Cho, Luke L. Hsiung, Robert E. Rudd, Sylvie Aubry</i>
<br>
<br>
In this study, we present the first simulation results of the formation of
dislocation cell wall microstructures in tantalum subjected to shock loading.
Dislocation patterns and cell wall formation are important to understanding the
mechanical properties of the materials in which they spontaneously arise, and
yet the processing and self-assembly mechanisms leading to their formation are
poorly understood. By employing transmission electron microscopy and discrete
dislocation dynamics, we propose a new mechanism involving coplanar
dislocations and pseudo-dipole mixed dislocation arrays that is essential to
the pattern formation process. Our large-scale 3D DDD simulations demonstrate
the self-organization of dislocation networks into cell walls in deformed BCC
metal (tantalum) persisting at the strain 20%. The simulation analysis captures
several crucial aspects of how the dislocation cell pattern affects metal
plasticity, as observed in experiments. Although experimental evidence is
inconclusive regarding whether cell wall formation takes place at the shock
front, after the shock, during release, or when the sample has had enough time
to relax post-recovery, our simulations indicate cell wall formation occurs
after the shock and before release. The extended Taylor hardening composite
model effectively considers the non-uniform dislocation density when cell walls
form and accurately describes the corresponding flow stress.

<h3>Emergent U(1) symmetry in non-particle-conserving 1D models</h3>

The properties of stable Luttinger liquid phases in models with a
non-conserved number of particles are investigated. We study the Luttinger
liquid phases in one-dimensional models of hard-core boson and spinless fermion
chains where particles can be created and annihilated three by three on
adjacent sites. We provide an intuitive and systematic method based on flow
equations approach, which accounts for additional terms in the correlations
generated by the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-symmetric interactions. We find that despite
the emergence of U(1) symmetry under renormalization, the observables are still
affected by its breaking in the bare Hamiltonian. In particular, the standard
bosonization mapping becomes insufficient to capture the full behavior of
correlation functions.

<h3>Evidence for chiral supercurrent in quantum Hall Josephson junctions</h3>

<br>
<br>
Hybridizing superconductivity with the quantum Hall (QH) effects has major
potential for designing novel circuits capable of inducing and manipulating
non-Abelian states for topological quantum computation. However, despite recent
experimental progress towards this hybridization, concrete evidence for a
chiral QH Josephson junction -- the elemental building block for coherent
superconducting-QH circuits -- is still lacking. Its expected signature is an
unusual chiral supercurrent flowing in QH edge channels, which oscillates with
a specific $2\phi_0$ magnetic flux periodicity ($\phi_0=h/2e$ is the
superconducting flux quantum, $h$ the Planck constant and $e$ the electron
charge). Here, we show that ultra-narrow Josephson junctions defined in
encapsulated graphene nanoribbons exhibit such a chiral supercurrent, visible
up to 8 teslas, and carried by the spin-degenerate edge channel of the QH
plateau of resistance $h/2e^2\simeq 12.9$ k$\Omega$. We observe reproducible
$2\phi_0$-periodic oscillation of the supercurrent, which emerges at constant
filling factor when the area of the loop formed by the QH edge channel is
constant, within a magnetic-length correction that we resolve in the data.
Furthermore, by varying the junction geometry, we show that reducing the
superconductor/normal interface length is pivotal to obtain a measurable
supercurrent on QH plateaus, in agreement with theories predicting dephasing
along the superconducting interface. Our findings mark a critical milestone
along the path to explore correlated and fractional QH-based superconducting
devices that should host non-Abelian Majorana and parafermion zero modes.

<h3>Gate-tunable spin Hall effect in an all-light-element heterostructure:  graphene with copper oxide</h3>

<br>
<br>
Graphene is a light material for long-distance spin transport due to its low
spin-orbit coupling, which at the same time is the main drawback to exhibit a
sizeable spin Hall effect. Decoration by light atoms has been predicted to
enhance the spin Hall angle in graphene while retaining a long spin diffusion
length. Here, we combine a light metal oxide (oxidized Cu) with graphene to
induce the spin Hall effect. Its efficiency, given by the product of the spin
Hall angle and the spin diffusion length, can be tuned with the Fermi level
position, exhibiting a maximum (1.8 $\pm$ 0.6 nm at 100 K) around the charge
neutrality point. This all-light-element heterostructure shows a larger
efficiency than conventional spin Hall materials. The gate-tunable spin Hall
effect is observed up to room temperature. Our experimental demonstration
provides an efficient spin-to-charge conversion system free from heavy metals
and compatible with large-scale fabrication.

<h3>Cascaded Logic Gates Based on High-Performance Ambipolar Dual-Gate WSe2  Thin Film Transistors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01790" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01790</a>

<br>
<br>
Ambipolar dual-gate transistors based on two-dimensional (2D) materials, such
as graphene, carbon nanotubes, black phosphorus, and certain transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs), enable reconfigurable logic circuits with suppressed
off-state current. These circuits achieve the same logical output as CMOS with
fewer transistors and offer greater flexibility in design. The primary
challenge lies in the cascadability and power consumption of these logic gates
with static CMOS-like connections. In this article, high-performance ambipolar
dual-gate transistors based on tungsten diselenide (WSe2) are fabricated. A
high on-off ratio of 10^8 and 10^6, a low off-state current of 100 to 300 fA, a
negligible hysteresis, and an ideal subthreshold swing of 62 and 63 mV/dec are
measured in the p- and n-type transport, respectively. For the first time, we
demonstrate cascadable and cascaded logic gates using ambipolar TMD transistors
with minimal static power consumption, including inverters, XOR, NAND, NOR, and
buffers made by cascaded inverters. A thorough study of both the control gate
and polarity gate behavior is conducted, which has previously been lacking. The
noise margin of the logic gates is measured and analyzed. The large noise
margin enables the implementation of VT-drop circuits, a type of logic with
reduced transistor number and simplified circuit design. Finally, the speed
performance of the VT-drop and other circuits built by dual-gate devices are
qualitatively analyzed. This work lays the foundation for future developments
in the field of ambipolar dual-gate TMD transistors, showing their potential
for low-power, high-speed and more flexible logic circuits.

<br>
<br>
Layered material heterostructures (LMHs) can be used to fabricate
electroluminescent devices operating in the visible spectral region. A major
advantage of LMH-light emitting diodes (LEDs) is that electroluminescence (EL)
emission can be tuned across that of different exciton complexes (e.g.
biexcitons, trions, quintons) by controlling the charge density. However, these
devices have an EL quantum efficiency as low as$\sim$10$^{-4}$\%. Here, we show
that the superacid bis-(triuoromethane)sulfonimide (TFSI) treatment of
monolayer WS$_2$-LEDs boosts EL quantum efficiency by over one order of
magnitude at room temperature. Non-treated devices emit light mainly from
negatively charged excitons, while the emission in treated ones predominantly
involves radiative recombination of neutral excitons. This paves the way to
tunable and efficient LMH-LEDs

<h3>Magnetic inhomogeneities in the quadruple perovskite manganite  [Y$_{2-x}$Mn$_x$]MnMnMn$_4$O$_{12}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
A combination of competing exchange interactions and substitutional disorder
gives rise to magnetic inhomogeneities in the
[Y$_{2-x}$Mn$_x$]MnMnMn$_4$O$_{12}$ $x = 0.23$ and $x = 0.16$ quadruple
perovskite manganites. Our neutron powder scattering measurements show that
both the $x = 0.23$ and $x = 0.16$ samples separate into two distinct magnetic
phases; below T$_{1}$ = 120 $\pm$ 10 K the system undergoes a transition from a
paramagnetic phase to a phase characterised by short range antiferromagnetic
clusters contained in a paramagnetic matrix, and below T$_{2}$ $\sim$ 65 K, the
system is composed of well correlated long range collinear ferrimagnetic order,
punctuated by short range antiferromagnetic clusters. A sharp increase in the
antiferromagnetic phase fraction is observed below $\sim$ 33 K, concomitant
with a decrease in the ferrimagnetic phase fraction. Our results demonstrate
that the theoretically proposed AFM phase is stabilised in the
[Y$_{2-x}$Mn$_x$]MnMnMn$_4$O$_{12}$ manganites in the presence of dominant B-B
exchange interactions, as predicted.

<h3>Effects of Co substitution on the structural and magnetic properties of  Sr(Ni$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$P$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01805" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01805</a>
<br>
<i>Juan Schmidt, Guilherme Gorgen-Lesseux, Raquel A. Ribeiro, Sergey L. Bud'ko, Paul C. Canfield</i>
<br>
<br>
Although SrNi$_2$P$_2$ adopts the common ThCr$_2$Si$_2$ structure for $T\geq
325$ K, being in an uncollapsed tetragonal (ucT) state, on cooling below 325 K
it adopts a one-third collapsed orthorhombic (tcO) phase where one out of every
three P-rows bond across the Sr layers. On the other hand, SrCo$_2$P$_2$ only
exhibits the uncollapsed ThCr$_2$Si$_2$ structure from room temperature down to
1.8 K. Neither SrNi$_2$P$_2$ nor SrCo$_2$P$_2$ manifest magnetic transitions
down to 50 mK and 2 K, respectively. In this work we report the effects of Co
substitution in Sr(Ni$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$P$_2$, which allows for tuning the
transition between the one-third collapsed and the uncollapsed structure. We
find a rapid decrease of the one-third collapsed structural transition
temperature with increasing Co fraction, until reaching full suppression for $x
\geq 0.1$. Substitution levels in the range $0.11\leq x\leq 0.58$ show no signs
of any transition down to 1.8 K in the magnetization or resistance measurements
in the range $1.8\ \text{K}\leq T\leq 300\ \text{K}$. However, different
magnetically ordered states emerge for $x\geq 0.65$, and disappear for $x\geq
0.99$, recovering the known paramagnetic properties of the parent compound
SrCo$_2$P$_2$. These results are summarized in a phase diagram, built upon the
characterization done on single crystals with different Co fraction. Both the
magnetic and structural properties are compared to other systems with
ThCr$_2$Si$_2$ structure that exhibit magnetic ordering and collapsed
tetragonal transitions. The magnetic ordering and moment formation are well
described by Takahashi's spin fluctuation theory of itinerant electron
magnetism.

<h3>Data-Driven, Physics-Informed Descriptors of Cation Ordering in  Multicomponent Oxides</h3>

<br>
The structural tunability and compositional diversity of multicomponent
perovskite oxides have enabled their various applications, including catalysis
and electronics. The cation ordering in these oxides, ranging from disordered
(i.e., high-entropy) to ordered (e.g., rocksalt), profoundly influences their
properties. While computational design tools can typically predict properties
associated with a particular ordering, inferring which ordering -- if any --
will be observed in synthesized oxides remains challenging. Here, we leveraged
first-principles simulations and machine learning to develop data-driven,
physics-informed descriptors of experimental ordering in multicomponent
perovskites and compared them with traditional physicochemical descriptors,
e.g., ionic radii and oxidation states. The fitted low-dimensional
classification models correctly rank up to 93% of compositions in an
experimental dataset of 190 perovskites between cation-ordered and disordered,
offering a rigorous benchmark between theory and experiments. Furthermore,
these descriptors accelerate high-throughput virtual screening of
multicomponent oxides by predicting their dominant ordering to avoid costly,
exhaustive simulations of cation arrangements.

In this study, using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation, the flow
of water in deformed carbon nanotubes is studied for two water models
TIP4P/2005 and SPC/FH. The results demonstrated a non-uniform dependence of the
flow on the tube deformation and the flexibility imposed on the water
molecules, leading to an unexpected increase in the flow in some cases. The
effects of tube diameter and pressure gradient are investigated to explain the
abnormal flow behavior with different degrees of structural deformation.

Transition-metal dichalcogenide bilayers exhibit a rich exciton landscape
including layer-hybridized excitons, i.e. excitons which are of partly intra-
and interlayer nature. In this work, we study hybrid exciton-exciton
interactions in naturally stacked WSe$_2$ homobilayers. In these materials, the
exciton landscape is electrically tunable such that the low-energy states can
be rendered more or less interlayer-like depending on the strength of the
external electric field. Based on a microscopic and material-specific
many-particle theory, we reveal two intriguing interaction regimes: a
low-dipole regime at small electric fields and a high-dipole regime at larger
fields, involving interactions between hybrid excitons with a substantially
different intra- and interlayer composition in the two regimes. While the
low-dipole regime is characterized by weak inter-excitonic interactions between
intralayer-like excitons, the high-dipole regime involves mostly
interlayer-like excitons which display a strong dipole-dipole repulsion and
give rise to large spectral blue-shifts and a highly anomalous diffusion.
Overall, our microscopic study sheds light on the remarkable electrical
tunability of hybrid exciton-exciton interactions in atomically thin
semiconductors and can guide future experimental studies in this growing field
of research.

<h3>Suppression of Spin Pumping at Cu/Cr Interfaces</h3>

Motivated by recent reports of spin transport in antiferromagnetic alloys and
compounds, we examine spin pumping in ferromagnet/spacer/ferromagnet
heterostructures that incorporate Cr, an elemental antiferromagnet.
Specifically, we interface thin Cr and Cu films to constitute a Cu/Cr spacer,
which separates the ferromagnetic spin-source and spin-sink layers. The Cu/Cr
spacer largely suppresses spin pumping -- i.e., neither transmitting nor
absorbing a significant amount of spin current -- even though Cu or Cr alone
transmits a sizable spin current. Moreover, we find that the antiferromagnetism
of Cr is not essential for suppressing spin pumping. Rather, diverse
combinations of spin-transparent metals may form interfaces that suppress spin
pumping through a yet undetermined mechanism, such as a giant reduction of the
spin-mixing conductance. Our work may stimulate a new perspective on
understanding and engineering spin transport in metallic multilayers.

<h3>Tensor Network Message Passing</h3>

<br>
<br>
When studying interacting systems, computing their statistical properties is
a fundamental problem in various fields such as physics, applied mathematics,
and machine learning. However, this task can be quite challenging due to the
exponential growth of the state space as the system size increases. Many
standard methods have significant weaknesses. For instance, message-passing
algorithms can be inaccurate and even fail to converge due to short loops. At
the same time, tensor network methods can have exponential computational
complexity in large graphs due to long loops. This work proposes a new method
called ``tensor network message passing.'' This approach allows us to compute
local observables like marginal probabilities and correlations by combining the
strengths of tensor networks in contracting small sub-graphs with many short
loops and the strengths of message-passing methods in globally sparse graphs,
thus addressing the crucial weaknesses of both approaches. Our algorithm is
exact for systems that are globally tree-like and locally dense-connected when
the dense local graphs have limited treewidth. We have conducted numerical
experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs to compute magnetizations of
Ising models and spin glasses, to demonstrate the superiority of our approach
over standard belief propagation and the recently proposed loopy
message-passing algorithm. In addition, we discuss the potential applications
of our method in inference problems in networks, combinatorial optimization
problems, and decoding problems in quantum error correction.

Physics of high-$T_c$ superconducting cuprates is obscured by the effect of
strong electronic correlations. One way to overcome the problem is to seek for
an exact solution at least within the small cluster and expand it to the whole
crystal. Such an approach is in the heart of the cluster perturbation theory
(CPT). Here we develop CPT for the dynamic spin and charge susceptibilities
(spin-CPT and charge-CPT), within which the correlation effects are explicitly
taken into account by the exact diagonalization. We apply spin-CPT and
charge-CPT to the effective two-band Hubbard model for the cuprates obtained
from the three-band Emery model and calculate one- and two-particle correlation
functions, namely, spectral function and spin and charge susceptibilities.
Doping dependence of the spin susceptibility was studied within spin-CPT and
CPT-RPA that is the CPT generalization of the random phase approximation (RPA).
Both methods produce the low energy response at four incommensurate wave
vectors in qualitative agreement to the results of the inelastic neutron
scattering on overdoped cuprates.

<h3>Simplex path integral and renormalization group for high-order  interactions</h3>

<br>
<br>
Modern theories of phase transitions and scale-invariance are rooted in path
integral formulation and renormalization groups (RG). Despite the applicability
of these approaches on simple systems with only pairwise interactions, they are
less effective on complex systems with un-decomposable high-order interactions
(i.e., interactions among arbitrary sets of units). To precisely characterize
the universality of high-order interacting systems, we propose simplex path
integral and simplex renormalization group as the generalizations of classic
approaches to arbitrary high-order and heterogeneous interactions. We first
formalize the trajectories of units governed by high-order interactions to
define path integrals on corresponding simplexes based on a multi-order
propagator. Then we develop a method to integrate out short-range high-order
interactions in the momentum space, accompanied by a coarse graining procedure
functioning on the simplex structure generated by high-order interactions. In a
special case where all interactions are decomposable, our framework reduces to
the well-known Laplacian RG. In more general cases with intertwined high-order
interactions, our theory is validated on large-scale data sets of real complex
systems (e.g., distributed information processing in the brain) to demonstrate
its capacity for identifying intrinsic properties of high-order interacting
systems during system reduction.

We consider spin-1/2 chains with external driving that breaks the continuous
symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We introduce a family of models described by the
Lindblad equation with local jump operators. The models have hidden strong
symmetries in the form of quasi-local charges, leading to multiple
non-equilibrium steady states. We compute them exactly in the form of Matrix
Product Operators, and argue that they are the analogues of quantum many body
scars in the Lindbladian setting. We observe that the dynamics leads to the
emergence of a Gibbs ensemble constructed from the hidden charges.

<h3>Superconducting Stiffness and Coherence Length of FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$  Measured in Zero-Applied Field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01926" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01926</a>
<br>
<i>Amotz Peri, Itay Mangel, Amit Keren</i>
<br>
<br>
Superconducting stiffness $\rho_s$ and coherence length $\xi$ are usually
determined by measuring the penetration depth $\lambda$ of a magnetic field and
the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ of a superconductor (SC), respectively.
However, in magnetic SC, e.g. some of the iron-based, this could lead to
erroneous results since the internal field could be very different from the
applied one. To overcome this problem in Fe$_{1+y}$Se$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ with $x
\sim 0.5$ and $y \sim 0$ (FST), we measure both quantities with the
Stiffnessometer technique. In this technique, one applies a rotor-free vector
potential $\textbf{A}$ to a superconducting ring and measures the current
density $\textbf{j}$ via the ring's magnetic moment $\textbf{m}$. $\rho_s$ and
$\xi$ are determined from London's equation $\textbf{j}=-\rho_s\textbf{A}$ and
its range of validity. This method is particularly accurate at temperatures
close to the critical temperature $T_c$. We find weaker $\rho_s$ and longer
$\xi$ than existing literature reports, and critical exponents which agree
better with expectations based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory.

<br>
<i>Carolina van Baalen, Jacopo Vialetto, Lucio Isa</i>
<br>
<br>
Monolayers of colloidal particles at oil-water interfaces readily crystalize
owing to electrostatic repulsion, which is often mediated through the oil.
However, little attempts exist to control it using oil-soluble electrolytes. We
probe the interactions amongst charged hydrophobic micospheres confined at a
water/hexadecane interface and show that repulsion can be continuously tuned
over orders of magnitude upon introducing minor amounts of an organic salt into
the oil. Our results show that charged groups at the particle/oil interface are
subject to an associative discharging mechanism, analogous to the charge
regulation kinetics observed for charged colloids in non-polar solvents.

<br>
<i>Harold Berjamin, Michel Destrade</i>
<br>
<br>
We present and review several models of fractional viscous stresses from the
literature, which generalise classical viscosity theories to fractional orders
by replacing total strain derivatives in time with fractional time derivatives.
Here we study shearing motions, observing that some models are more convenient
to use than others for the analysis of shear creep and relaxation. Moreover, we
investigate the issues of material frame-indifference and thermodynamic
consistency for these models and find that on these bases, some are physically
unacceptable. Finally, we compute the incremental stresses due to
small-amplitude wave propagation in a deformed material, with a view to
establish acousto-elastic formulas for prospective experimental calibrations.

<h3>Photon emission statistics of a driven microwave cavity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01986" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01986</a>
<br>
<i>Pedro Portugal, Fredrik Brange, Kalle S. U. Kansanen, Peter Samuelsson, Christian Flindt</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent experimental advances have made it possible to detect individual
quantum jumps in open quantum systems, such as the tunneling of single
electrons in nanoscale conductors or the emission of photons from non-classical
light sources. Here, we investigate theoretically the statistics of photons
emitted from a microwave cavity that is driven resonantly by an external field.
We focus on the differences between a parametric and a coherent drive, which
either squeezes or displaces the cavity field. We employ a Lindblad master
equation dressed with counting fields to obtain the generating function of the
photon emission statistics using a theoretical framework based on Gaussian
states. We then compare the distribution of photon waiting times for the two
drives as well as the $g^{(2)}$-functions of the outgoing light, and we
identify important differences between these observables. In the long-time
limit, we analyze the factorial cumulants of the photon emission statistics and
the large-deviation statistics of the emission currents, which are markedly
different for the two drives. Our theoretical framework can readily be extended
to more complicated systems, for instance, with several coupled microwave
cavities, and our predictions may be tested in future experiments.

<h3>Evolution of polygonal crack patterns in mud when subjected to repeated  wetting-drying cycles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01991" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01991</a>

<i>Ruhul A I Haque, Atish J. Mitra, Sujata Tarafdar, Tapati Dutta</i>
<br>
<br>
The present paper demonstrates how a natural crack mosaic resembling a random
tessellation evolves with repeated 'wetting followed by drying' cycles. The
natural system here is a crack network in a drying colloidal material, for
example, a layer of mud. A spring network model is used to simulate consecutive
wetting and drying cycles in mud layers until the crack mosaic matures. The
simulated results compare favourably with reported experimental findings. The
evolution of these crack mosaics has been mapped as a trajectory of a 4-vector
tuple in a geometry-topology domain. A phenomenological relation between energy
and crack geometry as functions of time cycles is proposed based on principles
of crack mechanics. We follow the crack pattern evolution to find that the
pattern veers towards a Voronoi mosaic in order to minimize the system energy.
Some examples of static crack mosaics in nature have also been explored to
verify if nature prefers Voronoi patterns. In this context, the authors define
new geometric measures of Voronoi-ness of crack mosaics to quantify how close a
tessellation is to a Voronoi tessellation, or even, to a Centroidal Voronoi
tessellation.

The critical field behavior of a layered Ising superconductor with
intermediate number of layers is studied. Under in-plane magnetic fields, the
finite-momentum superconductivity dubbed as the orbital
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state is found in the regime of low field and
high temperature. Our theory agrees well with the experimental results in

<br>
<br>
Despite the rapid rise in the performance of a variety of perovskite
optoelectronic devices with vertical charge transport, the effects of ion
migration remain a common and longstanding Achilles heel limiting the long-term
operational stability of lead halide perovskite devices. However, there is
still limited understanding of the impact of tin (Sn) substitution on the ion
dynamics of lead (Pb) halide perovskites. Here, we employ scan-rate-dependent
current-voltage measurements on Pb and mixed Pb-Sn perovskite solar cells to
show that short circuit current losses at lower scan rates, which can be traced
to the presence of mobile ions, are present in both kinds of perovskites. To
understand the kinetics of ion migration, we carry out scan-rate-dependent
hysteresis analyses and temperature-dependent impedance spectroscopy
measurements, which demonstrate suppressed ion migration in Pb-Sn devices
compared to their Pb-only analogues. By linking these experimental observations
to first-principles calculations on mixed Pb-Sn perovskites, we reveal the key
role played by Sn vacancies in increasing the iodide ion migration barrier due
to local structural distortions. These results highlight the beneficial effect
of Sn substitution in mitigating undesirable ion migration in halide
perovskites, with potential implications for future device development.

<h3>Topological phase detection through high-harmonic spectroscopy in  extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains</h3>

<br>
<br>
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains are paradigmatic examples of 1D topological
insulators hosting zero-energy edge modes when the bulk of the system has a
non-zero topological winding invariant. Recently, high-harmonic spectroscopy
has been suggested as a tool for detecting the topological phase. Specifically,
it has been shown that when the SSH chain is coupled to an external laser field
of a frequency much smaller than the band gap, the emitted light at harmonic
frequencies strongly differs between the trivial and the topological phase.
However, it remains unclear whether various non-trivial topological phases --
differing in the number of edge states -- can also be distinguished by the high
harmonic generation (HHG). In this paper, we investigate this problem by
studying an extended version of the SSH chain with extended-range hoppings,
resulting in a topological model with different topological phases. We
explicitly show that HHG spectra are a sensitive and suitable tool for
distinguishing topological phases when there is more than one topological
phase. We also propose a quantitative scheme based on tuning the filling of the
system to precisely locate the number of edge modes in each topological phase
of this chain.

<br>
<br>
Specific antiferromagnetic (AF) spin configurations generate large anomalous
Hall effects (AHEs) even at zero magnetic field through nonvanishing Berry
curvature in momentum space. In addition to restrictions on AF structures,
suitable control of AF domains is essential to observe this effect without
cancellations among its domains; therefore, compatible materials remain
limited. Here we show that an orthorhombic noncollinear AF material, NbMnP,
acquired AF structure-based AHE and controllability of the AF domains.
Theoretical calculations indicated that a large Hall conductivity of $\sim230$
$\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ originated from the AF structure of NbMnP. Symmetry
considerations explained the production of a small net magnetization, whose
anisotropy enabled the generation and cancellation of the Hall responses using
magnetic fields in different directions. Finally, asymmetric hysteresis in
NbMnP shows potential for development of controllability of responses in AF
materials.

<h3>Transport features of a topological superconducting nanowire with a  quantum dot: conductance and noise</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study two-terminal configurations in junctions between a topological
superconducting wire with spin-orbit coupling and magnetic field, and an
ordinary conductor with an embedded quantum dot. One of the signatures of the
Majorana zero modes in the topological phase is a quantization of the zero-bias
conductance at $G(V=0)=2e^2/h$. However, the finite size of the wires and the
presence of the quantum dot in the junction generate more complicated features
which lead to deviations from this simple picture. Here, we analyze the
behavior of the conductance at zero and finite bias, $G(V)$, as a function of a
gate voltage applied at the quantum dot in the case of a finite-length wire. We
analyze the effect of the angle between the magnetic field and the orientation
associated to the spin-orbit coupling. We provide a detailed description of the
spectral features of the quantum wire weakly and also strongly coupled to the
quantum dot and describe the conditions to have zero-energy states in these two
regimes for both the topological and non-topological phases. We also analyze
the concomitant behavior of the noise. We identify qualitative features that
are useful to distinguish between the topological and non-topological phases.
We show that in a strongly coupled quantum dot the simultaneous hybridization
with the topological modes and the supragap states of the wire mask the
signatures of the Majorana bound states in both the conductance and the Fano
factor.

<h3>Dynamic heterogeneity in polydisperse systems: A comparative study of  the role of local structural order parameter and particle size</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02043" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02043</a>
<br>
<i>Palak Patel, Mohit Sharma, Sarika Maitra Bhattacharyya</i>
<br>
<br>
In polydisperse systems, describing the structure and any structural order
parameter (SOP) is not trivial as it varies with the number of species we use
to describe the system, M . Depending on the degree of polydispersity, there is
an optimum value of M = M0 where we show that the mutual information of the
system increases. However, surprisingly the correlation between a recently
proposed SOP and the dynamics is highest for M = 1. This effect increases with
polydispersity. We find that the SOP at M = 1 is coupled with the particle
size, {\sigma}, and this coupling increases with polydispersity and decreases
with an increase in M . Careful analysis shows that at lower polydispersity the
SOP is a good predictor of the dynamics. However, at higher polydispersity, the
dynamics is strongly dependent on {\sigma}. Since the coupling between the SOP
and {\sigma} is higher for M = 1 thus, it appears to be a better predictor of
the dynamics. We also study the Vibrality an order parameter independent of
structural information. Compared to SOP, at high polydispersity we find
Vibrality to be a marginally better predictor of the dynamics. However, this
high predictive power of Vibrality, which is not there at lower polydispersity,
appears to be due to its stronger coupling with {\sigma}. Thus our study
suggests that for systems with high polydispersity, the correlation of any
order parameter and {\sigma} will affect the correlation between the order
parameter and dynamics and need not project a generic predictive power of the
order parameter.

We report the effect of co-doping of In and Ga at low concentrations on the
structural, electronic, and thermoelectric properties of SnTe based
compositions $Sn_{1.03-2x}In_{x}Ga_{x}Te$ (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04) prepared by
the solid-state route and spark plasma sintering (SPS). All compositions formed
in the fcc structure (Fm-3m) with no other impurity phase. The optical band gap
increased with the co-doping, indicative of band convergence effects. First
principle electronic structure calculations showed band convergence and the
formation of resonant levels, due to Ga and In doping respectively. The carrier
concentration increased on hole-doping by In and Ga ions while carrier mobility
decreased due to impurity scattering. The resistivity increased with
temperature, indicative of the degenerate semiconducting character of the
compounds. The Seebeck coefficient of the doped samples increased linearly with
temperature, reaching 85 - 95 ${\mu}$V/K at 783 K. Thermal conductivity
decreased sharply with co-doping, and the lattice thermal conductivity dropped
to 0.42 W$m^{-1}$ $K^{-1}$ above 750 K. The enhanced power factor and low
lattice thermal conductivity on doping resulted in a maximum figure of merit ZT
= 0.34 at 773 K, twice that of the pristine SnTe.

Many biological active agents respond to gradients of environmental cues by
redirecting their motion. Besides the well-studied prominent examples such as
photo- and chemotaxis, there has been considerable recent interest in
topotaxis, i.e.\ the ability to sense and follow topographic environmental
cues. We numerically investigate the topotaxis of active agents moving in
regular arrays of circular pillars. While a trivial topotaxis is achievable
through a spatial gradient of obstacle density, here we show that imposing a
gradient in the characteristics of agent-obstacle interaction can lead to an
effective topotaxis in an environment with a spatially uniform density of
obstacles. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate how a gradient in the angle of
sliding around pillars -- as e.g.\ observed in bacterial dynamics near surfaces
-- breaks the spatial symmetry and biases the direction of motion. We provide
an explanation for this phenomenon based on effective reflection at the
imaginary interface between pillars with different sliding angles. Our results
are of technological importance for design of efficient taxis devices.

We extend the study of finite-entanglement scaling from one-dimensional
gapless models to two-dimensional systems with a Fermi surface. In particular,
we show that the entanglement entropy of a contractible spatial region with
linear size $L$ scales as $S\sim L\log(\xi f(L/\xi))$ in the optimal
tensor-network, and hence area-law entangled, state approximation to a metallic
state, where $f(x)$ is a scaling function which depends on the shape of the
Fermi surface and $\xi$ is a finite correlation length induced by the
restricted entanglement. Crucially, the scaling regime can be realized with
numerically tractable bond dimensions. We also discuss the implications of the
Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem at fractional filling for tensor network state
approximations of metallic states.

transition in two FeRh films with thicknesses below and above the optical

for the lightinduced nucleation of ferromagnetic domains in the
antiferromagnetic material that is substantially slower than the speed of
sound. For the inhomogeneously excited thicker film, we additionally identify
kinetics of out-of-plane domain growth mediated by near-equilibrium heat
transport, which we experimentally verify by comparing Kerr effect experiments
in front- and backside excitation geometry.

<br>
The energy landscape of optical excitations in mono- and few-layer transition
metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is dominated by optically bright and dark
excitons. These excitons can be fully localized within a single TMD layer, or
the electron- and the hole-component of the exciton can be charge-separated
over multiple TMD layers. Such intra- or interlayer excitons have been
characterized in detail using all-optical spectroscopies, and, more recently,
photoemission spectroscopy. In addition, there are so-called hybrid excitons
whose electron- and/or hole-component are delocalized over two or more TMD
layers, and therefore provide a promising pathway to mediate charge-transfer
processes across the TMD interface. Hence, an in-situ characterization of their
energy landscape and dynamics is of vital interest. In this work, using
femtosecond momentum microscopy combined with many-particle modeling, we
quantitatively compare the dynamics of momentum-indirect intralayer excitons in
monolayer WSe$_2$ with the dynamics of momentum-indirect hybrid excitons in
heterobilayer WSe$_2$/MoS$_2$, and draw three key conclusions: First, we find
that the energy of hybrid excitons is reduced when compared to excitons with
pure intralayer character. Second, we show that the momentum-indirect
intralayer and hybrid excitons are formed via exciton-phonon scattering from
optically excited bright excitons. And third, we demonstrate that the
efficiency for phonon absorption and emission processes in the mono- and the
heterobilayer is strongly dependent on the energy alignment of the intralayer
and hybrid excitons with respect to the optically excited bright exciton.
Overall, our work provides microscopic insights into exciton dynamics in TMD
mono- and bilayers.

<br>
The technique known as 4D-STEM has recently emerged as a powerful tool for
the local characterization of crystalline structures in materials, such as
cathode materials for Li-ion batteries or perovskite materials for
photovoltaics. However, the use of new detectors optimized for electron
diffraction patterns and other advanced techniques requires constant adaptation
of methodologies to address the challenges associated with crystalline
materials. In this study, we present a novel image processing method to improve
pattern matching in the determination of crystalline orientations and phases.
Our approach uses sub-pixelar adaptative image processing to register and
reconstruct electron diffraction signals in large 4D-STEM datasets. By using
adaptive prominence and linear filters such as mean and gaussian blur, we are
able to improve the quality of the diffraction pattern registration. The
resulting data compression rate of 103 is well-suited for the era of big data
and provides a significant enhancement in the performance of the entire ACOM
data processing method. Our approach is evaluated using dedicated metrics,
which demonstrate a high improvement in phase recognition. Our results
demonstrate that this data preparation method not only enhances the quality of
the resulting image but also boosts the confidence level in the analysis of the
outcomes related to determining crystal orientation and phase. Additionally, it
mitigates the impact of user bias that may occur during the application of the
method through the manipulation of parameters.

<br>
In a recent Letter by Romanenko et al. [APL-104-072601] the authors used low
energy muon spin rotation to measure the Meissner screening profile in cutouts
from Nb SRF cavities, systematically comparing how different surface treatments
affect the screening properties of the elemental type-II superconductor. They
reported a ``strong'' modification to the character of the screening profile
upon mild baking at 120 degree celsius for 48 hours, which was interpreted as a
depth-dependent carrier mean-free-path resulting from a ``gradient in vacancy
concentration'' near the surface. While this observation led to speculation
that this surface treatment yields an ``effective'' superconducting bilayer, we
suggest that its likeness to such is accidental and that the behavior is an
artifact from the analysis.

<h3>Ultra-delayed material failure via shear banding after straining an  amorphous material</h3>

We predict a phenomenon of catastrophic material failure arising suddenly
within an amorphous material, with an extremely long delay time since the
material was last deformed. By simulating a mesoscopic soft glassy rheology
model in one dimension (1D), a mesoscopic elastoplastic model in 1D and 2D, and
a continuum fluidity model in 1D, we demonstrate the basic physics to involve a
dramatic ultra-delayed shear banding instability, in which strain suddenly
strongly localises within the material and the stress drops precipitously. The
delay time after the long historical shear strain was applied before failure
occurs increases steeply with decreasing strain amplitude, decreasing working
temperature, and increasing sample annealing prior to shear. In demonstrating
the same physics -- which is directly testable experimentally and in particle
simulations -- to obtain within three different constitutive models, we suggest
it may be generic across amorphous materials. The counter-intuitive prediction
of catastrophic material failure long after any deformation was last applied
could have important consequences for material processing and performance.

Magnetic properties of materials ranging from conventional ferromagnetic
metals to strongly correlated materials such as cuprates originate from Coulomb
exchange interactions. The existence of alternate mechanisms for magnetism that
could naturally facilitate electrical control have been discussed theoretically
but an experimental demonstration in an extended system has been missing. Here,
we investigate MoSe$_2$/WS$_2$ van der Waals heterostructures in the vicinity
of Mott insulator states of electrons forming a frustrated triangular lattice
and observe direct evidence for magnetic correlations originating from a
kinetic mechanism. By directly measuring electronic magnetization through the
strength of the polarization-selective attractive polaron resonance, we find
that when the Mott state is electron doped the system exhibits ferromagnetic
correlations in agreement with the Nagaoka mechanism.

Since the early 1960's, the discovery of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
(DMI) helped to explain the physical mechanisms behind certain magnetic
phenomena, such as net moment in antiferromagnets, or enhanced anisotropy field
from heavy metals impurity in dilute Cu:Mn alloy. Since the researchers unveil
the key role that DMI plays in stabilizing chiral Neel type magnetic domain
wall and magnetic skyrmions, the studies on DMI have received growing interest.
Governed by spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and various types of inversion symmetry
breaking (ISB) in magnetic systems, DMI drives the forming of distinct
morphologies of magnetic skyrmions. Our aim is to briefly introduce the
research history of DMI and its significance in the field of modern
spintronics.

Charge separation at moving three-phase contact lines is observed in nature
as well as technological processes. Despite the growing number of experimental
investigations in recent years, the physical mechanism behind the charging
remains obscure. Here we identify the origin of charge separation as the
dewetting of the bound surface charge within the electric double layer by the
receding contact line. This charge depends strongly on the local electric
double layer structure close to the contact line, which is affected by the
gas-liquid interface and the internal flow of the liquid. We summarize the
charge separation mechanism in an analytical model that captures parametric
dependencies in agreement with our experiments and numerical simulations.
Charge separation increases with increasing contact angle and decreases with
increasing dewetting velocity. Our findings reveal the universal mechanism of
charge separation at receding contact lines, relevant to many dynamic wetting
scenarios, and provide a theoretical foundation for both fundamental questions,
like contact angle hysteresis, and practical applications.

Structure-property relationships in ordered materials have long been a core
principle in materials design. However, the intentional introduction of
disorder into materials provides structural flexibility and thus access to
material properties that are not attainable in conventional, ordered materials.
To understand disorder-property relationships, the disorder - i.e., the local
ordering principles - must be quantified. Correlated disorder can be probed
experimentally by diffuse scattering. The analysis is notoriously difficult,
especially if only powder samples are available. Here, we combine the
advantages of three-dimensional electron diffraction - a method that allows
single crystal diffraction measurements on sub-micron sized crystals - and
three-dimensional difference pair distribution function analysis
(3D-{\Delta}PDF) to address this problem. 3D-{\Delta}PDFs visualise and
quantify local deviations from the average structure and enable a
straightforward interpretation of the single crystal diffuse scattering data in
terms of a three-dimensional local order model. Comparison of the
3D-{\Delta}PDF from electron diffraction data with those obtained from neutron
and x-ray experiments of yttria-stabilized zirconia demonstrates the
reliability of the newly proposed approach.

<h3>Impacts of the half-skyrmion spin topology, spin-orbit torque, and  dynamic symmetry breaking on the growth of magnetic stripe domains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02181" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02181</a>

<br>

We have performed an experimental and modeling-based study of the spin-orbit
torque-induced growth of magnetic stripe domains in heavy metal/ferromagnet
thin-film heterostructures that possess chiral N\'eel-type domain walls due to
an interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. In agreement with previous
reports, the stripe domains stabilized in these systems exhibit a significant
transverse growth velocity relative to the applied current axis. This behavior
has previously been attributed to the Magnus force-like skyrmion Hall effect of
the stripe domain spin topology, which is analogous to that of a half-skyrmion.
However, through analytic modeling of the in-plane torques generated by
spin-orbit torque, we find that a dynamical reconfiguration of the domain wall
magnetization profile is expected to occur - promoting motion with similar
directionality and symmetry as the skyrmion Hall effect. These results further
highlight the sensitivity of spin-orbit torque to the local orientation of the
domain wall magnetization profile and its contribution to domain growth
directionality.

<br>
<br>
The combination of a superconductor with a magnetically inhomogeneous
material has been established as an efficient mechanism for the generation of
long-ranged spin-polarized (spin-triplet) Cooper pairs. Evidence for this
mechanism, however, has been established based on studies done on
three-dimensional systems, where the strong bonds existing at the interface
between the superconductor and the magnetic material should in principle
enhance proximity effects and strengthen any electronic correlations. Here, we
fabricate devices based on van der Waals stacks of flakes of the
two-dimensional superconductor NbS2 combined with flakes of Cr1/3NbS2, which
has a built-in magnetic inhomogeneity due to its helimagnetic spin texture at
low temperatures. We find that the critical temperature of these vdW bilayers
is strongly dependent on the magnetic state of Cr1/3NbS2, whose degree of
magnetic inhomogeneity can be controlled via an applied magnetic field. Our
results demonstrate evidence for the generation of long-ranged spin-triplet
pairs across the Cr1/3NbS2/NbS2 vdW interface.

The strongly correlated material FeSi exhibits several unusual thermal,
magnetic, and structural properties under varying pressure-temperature (P-T)
conditions. It is a potential thermoelectric alloy and a materials of several
geological implications as a possible constituent at the Earth's core mantle
boundary (CMB). The phase transition behavior and lattice dynamics of FeSi
under different P-T conditions remain elusive. A previous theoretical work
predicted a pressure induced B20-B2 transition at ambient temperature, yet the
transition is only observed at high P-T conditions in the experiments.
Furthermore, the closing of the electronic gap due to a dramatic
renormalization of the electronic structure and phonon anomalies has been
reported based on density function calculations. In this study we have
performed high pressure powder diffraction and Nuclear Resonant Inelastic X-ray
Scattering (NRIXS) measurements up to 120 GPa to understand the phase stability
and the lattice dynamics. Our study shows evidence for a nonhydrostatic stress
induced B20-B2 transition in FeSi around 36 GPa for the first time. The Fe
partial phonon density of states (PDOS) and thermal parameters were derived
from NRIXS up to 120 GPa with the density function theoretical (DFT)
calculations. These calculations further predict and are consistent with
pressure-induced metallization and band gap closing around 12 GPa.

The fabrication of bulk delta-phase Zirconium Hydride ($\delta$-ZrH) using
Zircaloy-4 as a precursor is herein reported. Characterization using
electron-microscopy methods indicate that the fabricated material is of a
single-phase. Sn-rich segregation zones have been observed to form as a direct
result of the hydriding process. These findings experimentally validate
previous \textit{ab initio} calculations on the influence H incorporation in
Zircaloy-4 constitutional elements such as Sn, Fe and Cr. The effect of
hydriding and Sn segregation on pre-existing Zr(Fe,Cr)$_{2}$ Laves phases is
also evaluated. Major implications on the development of moderators for use in
microreactors within the nuclear industry are discussed.

The demands of modern electronic components require advanced computing
platforms for efficient information processing to realize in-memory operations
with a high density of data storage capabilities towards developing
alternatives to von Neumann architectures. Herein, we demonstrate the
multifunctionality of monolayer MoS2 mem-transistors which can be used as a
high-geared intrinsic transistor at room temperature; however, at a high
temperature (>350 K), they exhibit synaptic multi-level memory operations. The
temperature-dependent memory mechanism is governed by interfacial physics,
which solely depends on the gate field modulated ion dynamics and charge
transfer at the MoS2/dielectric interface. We have proposed a non-volatile
memory application using a single FET device where thermal energy can be
ventured to aid the memory functions with multi-level (3-bit) storage
capabilities. Furthermore, our devices exhibit linear and symmetry in
conductance weight updates when subjected to electrical potentiation and
depression. This feature has enabled us to attain a high classification
accuracy while training and testing the Modified National Institute of
Standards and Technology datasets through artificial neural network simulation.
This work paves the way for new avenues in 2D semiconductors toward reliable
data processing and storage with high-packing density arrays for brain-inspired
artificial learning.

<h3>Static self energy and effective mass of the homogeneous electron gas  from Quantum Monte Carlo calculations</h3>

We discuss the methodology of quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the
effective mass based on the static self energy, $\Sigma(k,0)$. We then use
variational Monte Carlo calculations of $\Sigma(k,0)$ of the homogeneous
electron gas at various densities to obtain results very close to perturbative
$G_0 W_0$ calculations for values of the density parameter $1 \le r_s \le 10$.
The obtained values for the effective mass are close to diagrammatic Monte
Carlo results and disagree with previous quantum Monte Carlo calculations based
on a heuristic mapping of excitation energies to those of an ideal gas.

Antiferromagnets (AFMs) are promising materials for future high-frequency
field-free spintronic applications. Self-localized spin structures can enhance
their capabilities and introduce new functionalities to AFM-based devices. Here
we consider a domain wall (DW), a topological soliton that bridges a connection
between two ground states, similar to a Josephson junction (JJ) link between
two superconductors. We demonstrate the similarities between DWs in bi-axial
AFM with easy-axis primary anisotropy, driven by a spin current, and long
Josephson junctions (LJJs). We found that the Bloch line (BL) in DWs resembles
the fluxon state of JJs, creating a close analogy between the two systems. We
propose a scheme that allows us to create, move, read, and delete such BLs.
This transmission line operates at room temperature and can be dynamically
reconfigured in contrast to superconductors. Results of a developed model were
confirmed by micromagnetic simulations for Cr$_2$O$_3$ and DyFeO$_3$, i.e.,
correspondingly with weak and strong in-plane anisotropy. Overall, the proposed
scheme has significant potential for use in magnetic memory and logic devices.

<h3>Antiferromagnetic bosonic $t$-$J$ models and their quantum simulation in  tweezer arrays</h3>

<br>
<br>
The combination of optical tweezer arrays with strong interactions -- via
dipole-exchange of molecules and van-der-Waals interactions of Rydberg atoms --
has opened the door for the exploration of a wide variety of quantum spin
models. A next significant step will be the combination of such settings with
mobile dopants: This will enable to simulate the physics believed to underlie
many strongly correlated quantum materials. Here we propose an experimental
scheme to realize bosonic $t$-$J$ models via encoding the local Hilbert space
in a set of three internal atomic or molecular states. By engineering
antiferromagnetic (AFM) couplings between spins, competition between charge
motion and magnetic order similar to that in high-$T_c$ cuprates can be
realized. Since the bosonic AFM version of the 2D $t$-$J$ model we propose has
not been studied previously, we start by analyzing the case of two dopants --
the simplest instance in which their bosonic statistics plays a role, and
contrast our results to the fermionic case. We perform large-scale density
matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations on six-legged cylinders, and
find a strong tendency for bosonic holes to form stripes. This demonstrates
that bosonic, AFM $t$-$J$ models may contain similar physics as the collective
phases in strongly correlated electrons.
