<h3>Machine learning-based sampling of virtual experiments within the full  stress state to identify parameters of anisotropic yield models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00090" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00090</a>

This paper presents a new machine learning-based approach to investigate
anisotropic yield surfaces of sheet metals by virtual experiments. The new
sampling approach is based upon the machine learning technique active learning,
which has been adapted to efficiently sample virtual experiments with respect
to the full stress state in order to identify parameters of anisotropic yield
models. The approach was employed to sample virtual experiments based on the
crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) for a DX56D deep drawing steel
and compared with two state-of-the-art sampling methods taken from literature.
The resulting points on the initial yield surface for all three sampling
methods were then used to identify parameters of the anisotropic yield models
Hill48, Yld91, Yld2004-18p, and Yld2004-27p. The results show that the new
machine learning-based sampling approach has a higher sampling efficiency than
the two state-of-the-art sampling methods. It was also discovered that the
effect of the sampling method on the resulting yield surfaces for Hill48,
Yld91, Yld2004-18p, and Yld2004-27p is less significant than the choice of the
anisotropic yield model for a sufficiently large number of sampled yield
points. In this respect, Yld2004-27p was identified as being sufficiently
flexible to represent the anisotropic yield surface of DX56D within full stress
state with reasonable accuracy.

Electron-electron interactions in graphene are sufficiently strong to induce
a correlated and momentum-conserving flow such that charge carriers behave
similarly to the Hagen-Poiseuille flow of a classical fluid. In the current
work, we investigate the electronic signatures of such a viscous charge flow in
high-mobility graphene FETs. In two complementary measurement schemes, we
monitor differential resistance of graphene for different channel widths and
for different effective electron temperatures. By combining both approaches,
the presence of viscous effects is verified in a temperature range starting
from 178 K and extending up to room temperature. Our experimental findings are
supported by finite element calculations of the graphene channel, which also
provide design guidelines for device geometries that exhibit increased viscous
effects. The presence of viscous effects near room temperature opens up avenues
for functional hydrodynamic devices such as geometric rectifiers like a Tesla
valve and charge amplifiers based on electronic Venturi effect.

<h3>Quantum dynamics of impurities in a Bose-Einstein condensate</h3>

We study the quantum dynamics of the two impurities in a trapped
quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). We explore the effect of
impurity-BEC and impurity-impurity interaction strengths on the dynamics of
impurities inside the Bose-Einstein condensate. By studying the
auto-correlation function of impurities and the BEC, we analyze and quantify
the trapping of impurities inside the BEC. We find out that for the small value
of inter-species coupling strength the BEC starts to oscillate inside the trap.
For mild coupling strengths, attractive and repulsive impurities are captured
after a few cycles of oscillation inside the BEC. In the strong interaction
strength regime, the to-and-fro motion of impurities is suppressed quite fast.
Our conclusion indicates that quench dynamics can be a tool for studying
impurity BEC interactions or impurity-impurity interactions. Our analysis shows
that the generation of phonon, shock waves, soliton trains, and self-trapping
is strongly dependent on the impurity-BEC coupling coefficient.

The molecular structure of moving contact lines (MCLs) and the emergence of a
corresponding macroscopic dissipation have made the MCL a paradigm of fluid
dynamics. Through novel averaging techniques that remove capillary waves
smearing we achieve an unprecedented resolution in molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations and find that they match with the continuum description obtained by
finite element method (FEM) down to molecular scales. This allows us to
distinguish dissipation at the liquid-solid interface (Navier-slip) and at the
contact line, the latter being negligible for the rather smooth substrate
considered.

<h3>Magnon dynamics in a Skyrmion-textured domain wall of antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00030" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00030</a>
<br>
<i>Seungho Lee, Kouki Nakata, Oleg Tchernyshyov, Se Kwon Kim</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically investigate the interaction between magnons and a
Skyrmion-textured domain wall in a two-dimensional antiferromagnet and
elucidate the resultant properties of magnon transport. Using supersymmetric
quantum mechanics, we solve the scattering problem of magnons on top of the
domain wall and obtain the exact solutions of propagating and bound magnon
modes. Then, we find their properties of reflection and refraction in the
Skyrmion-textured domain wall, where magnons experience an emergent magnetic
field due to its non-trivial spin texture-induced effective gauge field. Based
on the obtained scattering properties of magnons and the domain wall, we show
that the thermal transport decreases as the domain wall's chirality increases.
Our results suggest that the thermal transport of an antiferromagnet is tunable
by modulating the Skyrmion charge density of the domain wall, which might be
useful for realizing electrically tunable spin caloritronic devices.

<h3>Exact solution of the topological symplectic Kondo problem</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00034" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00034</a>

The Kondo effect is an archetypical phenomenon in the physics of strongly
correlated electron systems. Recent attention has focused on the application of
Kondo physics to quantum information science by exploiting overscreened Kondo
impurities with residual anyon-like impurity entropy. While this physics was
proposed in the fine-tuned multi-channel Kondo setup or in the Majorana-based
topological Kondo effect, we here study the Kondo effect with symplectic
symmetry Sp(2k) and present details about the implementation which importantly
only involves conventional s-wave superconductivity coupled to an array of
resonant levels and neither requires perfect channel symmetry nor Majorana
fermions. We carefully discuss the role of perturbations and show that a global
Zeeman drives the system to a 2-channel SU(k) fixed point. Exact results for
the residual entropy, specific heat, and magnetization are derived using the
thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz for Sp(2k). This solution not only proves the
existence of a quantum critical ground state with anyon-like Hilbert space
dimension but also a particularly weak non-Fermi liquid behavior at
criticality. We interpret the weakness of non-analyticities as a manifestation
of suppressed density of states at the impurity causing only a very weak
connection of putative anyons and conduction electrons. Given this weak
connection, the simplicity of the design, and the stability of the effect, we
conjecture that the symplectic Kondo effect may be particularly suitable for
quantum information applications.

<h3>Floquet's Refrigerator: Conformal Cooling in Driven Quantum Critical  Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00040" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00040</a>
<br>
<i>Xueda Wen, Ruihua Fan, Ashvin Vishwanath</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a general method of cooling -- periodic driving generated by
spatially deformed Hamiltonians -- and study it in general one-dimensional
quantum critical systems described by a conformal field theory. Our protocol is
able to efficiently cool a finite-temperature Gibbs (mixed) state down to zero
temperature at prescribed sub-regions exponentially rapidly in Floquet time
cycles. At the same time, entropy and energy are transferred and localized to
the complementary regions that shrink with time. We derive these conclusions
through an exact analytic solution of the full time evolution of reduced
density matrices. We also use numerics in free-fermion lattice models as a
benchmark and find remarkable agreement. Such conformal Floquet refrigerators
open a promising new route to cooling synthetic quantum systems.

<h3>Fermionic Isometric Tensor Network States in Two Dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00043" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00043</a>
<br>
<i>Zhehao Dai, Yantao Wu, Taige Wang, Michael P. Zaletel</i>
<br>
<br>
We generalize isometric tensor network states to fermionic systems, paving
the way for efficient adaptations of 1D tensor network algorithms to 2D
fermionic systems. As the first application of this formalism, we developed and
benchmarked a time-evolution block-decimation (TEBD) algorithm for real-time
and imaginary-time evolution. The imaginary-time evolution produces
ground-state energies for gapped systems, systems with a Dirac point, and
systems with gapless edge mode to good accuracy. The real-time TEBD captures
the chiral edge dynamics on the boundary of a Chern insulator.

<h3>Dynamical fractal and anomalous noise in a clean magnetic crystal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00051" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00051</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Fractals -- objects with non-integer dimensions -- occur in manifold settings
and length scales in nature, ranging from snowflakes and lightning strikes to
natural coastlines. Much effort has been expended to generate fractals for use
in many-body physics. Here, we identify an emergent dynamical fractal in a
disorder-free, stoichiometric three-dimensional magnetic crystal in
thermodynamic equilibrium. The phenomenon is born from constraints on the
dynamics of the magnetic monopole excitations in spin ice, which restrict them
to move on the fractal. This observation explains the anomalous exponent found
in magnetic noise experiments in the spin ice compound Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, and
it resolves a long standing puzzle about its rapidly diverging relaxation time.
The capacity of spin ice to exhibit such striking phenomena holds promise of
further surprising discoveries in the cooperative dynamics of even simple
topological many-body systems.

<h3>Adaptive power method for estimating large deviations in Markov chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00060" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00060</a>
<br>
<i>Francesco Coghi, Hugo Touchette</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the performance of a stochastic algorithm based on the power method
that adaptively learns the large deviation functions characterizing the
fluctuations of additive functionals of Markov processes, used in physics to
model nonequilibrium systems. This algorithm was introduced in the context of
risk-sensitive control of Markov chains and was recently adapted to diffusions
evolving continuously in time. Here we provide an in-depth study of the
convergence of this algorithm close to dynamical phase transitions, exploring
the speed of convergence as a function of the learning rate and the effect of
including transfer learning. We use as a test example the mean degree of a
random walk on an Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graph, which shows a transition
between high-degree trajectories of the random walk evolving in the bulk of the
graph and low-degree trajectories evolving in dangling edges of the graph. The
results show that the adaptive power method is efficient close to dynamical
phase transitions, while having many advantages in terms of performance and
complexity compared to other algorithms used to compute large deviation
functions.

<h3>Finite temperature tensor network algorithm for frustrated  two-dimensional quantum materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00121" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00121</a>
<br>
<i>Philipp Schmoll, Christian Balz, Bella Lake, Jens Eisert, Augustine Kshetrimayum</i>
<br>
<br>
Aimed at a more realistic classical description of natural quantum systems,
we present a two-dimensional tensor network algorithm to study finite
temperature properties of frustrated model quantum systems and real quantum
materials. For this purpose, we introduce the infinite projected entangled
simplex operator ansatz to study thermodynamic properties. To obtain
state-of-the-art benchmarking results, we explore the highly challenging
spin-1/2 Heisenberg anti-ferromagnet on the Kagome lattice, a system for which
we investigate the melting of the magnetization plateaus at finite magnetic
field and temperature. Making close connection to actual experimental data of
real quantum materials, we go on to studying the finite temperature properties
of Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$. We compare the magnetization curve of this material
in the presence of an external magnetic field at finite temperature with
classically simulated data. As a first theoretical tool that incorporates both
thermal fluctuations as well as quantum correlations in the study of this
material, our work contributes to settling the existing controversy between the
experimental data and previous theoretical works on the magnetization process.

<h3>Superconducting properties and gap structure of the topological  superconductor candidate Ti_(3)Sb</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00124" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00124</a>
<br>
<i>R. Chapai, M. P. Smylie, H. Hebbeker, D. Y. Chung, W.-K. Kwok, J. F. Mitchell, U. Welp</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a study of the superconducting properties of the candidate
topological superconductor Ti_(3)Sb. Electrical transport measurements show
zero resistance with a T_(c,onset) of ~ 5.9 K with a transition width
{\Delta}T_c~ 0.6 K. The superconducting phase boundaries as derived from
magneto-transport and magnetic susceptibility measurements agree well. We
estimate an upper critical field Bc2(0)~4.5 T. A Ginzburg-Landau (GL) analysis
yields values of the coherence length and penetration depth of {\zeta} = 6.2 nm
and {\lambda} = 340 nm, respectively, and a GL parameter ~ 55, indicating
extreme type-II behavior. Furthermore, we observed a step height in the
specific heat ({\Delta}C_e)/({\gamma}T_c )~1.61, a value larger than the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) value of 1.43, suggesting modest coupling.
Measurements of the temperature dependence of the London penetration depth via
the tunnel-diode oscillator (TDO) technique down to ~ 450 mK show a full
superconducting gap, consistent with a conventional s-wave gap structure.

<h3>A three tile 6-fold golden-mean tiling</h3>

<br>
<i>Sam Coates, Toranosuke Matsubara, Akihisa Koga</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a multi-edge-length aperiodic tiling which exhibits 6--fold
rotational symmetry. The edge lengths of the tiling are proportional to
1:$\tau$, where $\tau$ is the golden mean $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$. We show how
the tiling can be generated using simple substitution rules for its three
constituent tiles, which we then use to demonstrate the bipartite nature of the
tiling vertices. As such, we show that there is a relatively large sublattice
imbalance of $1/[2\tau^2]$. Similarly, we define allowed vertex configurations
before analysing the tiling structure in 4-dimensional hyperspace.

<h3>Floquet engineering of strongly-driven excitons in monolayer tungsten  disulfide</h3>

<br>
<br>
Interactions of quantum materials with strong-laser fields can induce exotic
nonequilibrium electronic states. Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, a
new class of direct-gap semiconductors with prominent quantum confinement,
offer exceptional opportunities toward Floquet engineering of quasiparticle
electron-hole states, or excitons. Strong-field driving has a potential to
achieve enhanced control of electronic band structure, thus a possibility to
open a new realm of exciton light-matter interactions. However, experimental
implementation of strongly-driven excitons has so far remained out of reach.
Here, we use mid-infrared laser pulses below the optical bandgap to excite
monolayer tungsten disulfide up to a field strength of 0.3 V/nm, and
demonstrate strong-field light dressing of excitons in the excess of a hundred
millielectronvolt. Our high-sensitivity transient absorption spectroscopy
further reveals formation of a virtual absorption feature below the 1s-exciton
resonance, which is assigned to a light-dressed sideband from the dark
2p-exciton state. Quantum-mechanical simulations substantiate the experimental
results and enable us to retrieve real-space movies of the exciton dynamics.
This study advances our understanding of the exciton dynamics in the
strong-field regime, and showcases the possibility of harnessing ultrafast,
strong-field phenomena in device applications of two-dimensional materials.

<h3>Scalable van der Waals epitaxy of tunable moiré heterostructures</h3>

The unique physics found in moir\'e superlattices of twisted or
lattice-mismatched atomic layers hold great promise for future quantum
technologies. However, twisted configurations are typically thermodynamically
unfavorable, making the accurate twist angle control in direct growth
implausible. While rotationally aligned moir\'e superlattices based on
lattice-mismatched layers such as WSe2/WS2 can be synthesized, they lack the
critical tunability of the moir\'e period and the moir\'e formation mechanisms
are not well-understood. Here, we report the scalable, thermodynamically driven
van der Waals epitaxy of stable moir\'es with tunable period from 10 to 45
nanometers, based on lattice mismatch engineering in two WSSe layers with
adjustable chalcogens ratios. Contrarily to conventional epitaxy, where lattice
mismatch induced stress hinders high-quality growth, we reveal the key role of
bulk stress in moir\'e formation, as well as its unique interplay with edge
stress in shaping the moir\'e growth modes. Moreover, the synthesized
superlattices display tunable interlayer, and moir\'e intralayer excitons. Our
studies unveil the unique epitaxial science of moir\'e synthesis and lay the
foundations for moir\'e-based technologies.

<h3>Complex topological features of reservoirs shape learning performances  in bio-inspired recurrent neural networks</h3>

Recurrent networks are a special class of artificial neural systems that use
their internal states to perform computing tasks for machine learning. One of
its state-of-the-art developments, i.e. reservoir computing (RC), uses the
internal structure -- usually a static network with random structure -- to map
an input signal into a nonlinear dynamical system defined in a higher
dimensional space. Reservoirs are characterized by nonlinear interactions among
their units and their ability to store information through recurrent loops,
allowing to train artificial systems to learn task-specific dynamics. However,
it is fundamentally unknown how the random topology of the reservoir affects
the learning performance. Here, we fill this gap by considering a battery of
synthetic networks -- characterized by different topological features -- and 45
empirical connectomes -- sampled from brain regions of organisms belonging to 8
different species -- to build the reservoir and testing the learning
performance against a prediction task with a variety of complex input signals.
We find nontrivial correlations between RC performances and both the number of
nodes and rank of the covariance matrix of activation states, with performance
depending on the nature -- stochastic or deterministic -- of input signals.
Remarkably, the modularity and the link density of the reservoir are found to
affect RC performances: these results cannot be predicted by models only
accounting for simple topological features of the reservoir. Overall, our
findings highlight that the complex topological features characterizing
biophysical computing systems such as connectomes can be used to design
efficient bio-inspired artificial neural networks.

A contact potential describing an effective interaction between atomic $^4$He
reproducing the results obtained with the HFDHE2 potential by Aziz et al. is
employed to study the resulting equation of state by means of Quantum Monte
Carlo calculations. \cblack The energy per particle and the pair distribution
functions were investigated as a function of the ultraviolet cutoff $\Lambda$.
The results suggest that not only the mean field properties of the system, such
as the energy and the saturation density, are correctly reproduced, but also
very microscopic quantities such as the pair distribution function are seen to
converge towards the exact results when extrapolating for
$\Lambda\rightarrow\infty$.

Holes in silicon quantum dots are receiving significant attention due to
their potential as fast, tunable, and scalable qubits in semiconductor quantum
circuits. Despite this, challenges remain in this material system including
difficulties using charge sensing to determine the number of holes in a quantum
dot, and in controlling the coupling between adjacent quantum dots. In this
work, we address these problems by fabricating an ambipolar complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) device using multilayer palladium gates. The
device consists of an electron charge sensor adjacent to a hole double quantum
dot. We demonstrate control of the spin state via electric dipole spin
resonance (EDSR). We achieve smooth control of the inter-dot coupling rate over
two orders of magnitude and use the charge sensor to perform spin-to-charge
conversion to measure the hole singlet-triplet relaxation time of 11 {\mu}s for
a known hole occupation. These results provide a path towards improving the
quality and controllability of hole spin-qubits.

<h3>Nonlocal optical conductivity of Fermi surface nesting materials</h3>

We investigate the nonlocal optical conductivity of Fermi surface nesting
materials which support charge density waves or spin density waves. The
nonlocal optical conductivity contains information of correlations in electron
fluids which could not be accessed by standard optical probes. Half metal
emerges from doping a charge density wave and similarly spin-valley half metal
emerges from doping a spin density wave. Based on the parabolic band
approximation, we find the Drude peak is shifted to higher frequency and splits
into two peaks in the nonlocal optical conductivity. We attribute this to the
two Fermi velocities in the half-metal or spin-valley half metal states.

<h3>Observation of oscillating $g$-factor anisotropy arising from strong  crystal lattice anisotropy in GaAs spin-3/2 hole quantum point contacts</h3>

Many modern spin-based devices rely on the spin-orbit interaction, which is
highly sensitive to the host semiconductor heterostructure and varies
substantially depending on crystal direction, crystal asymmetry (Dresselhaus),
and quantum confinement asymmetry (Rashba). One-dimensional quantum point
contacts are a powerful tool to probe both energy and directional dependence of
spin-orbit interaction through the effect on the hole $g$-factor. In this work
we investigate the role of cubic crystal asymmetry in driving an oscillation in
the in-plane hole $g$-factor anisotropy when the quantum point contact is
rotated with respect to the crystal axes, and we are able to separate
contributions to the Zeeman Hamiltonian arising from Rashba and cubic crystal
asymmetry spin-orbit interactions. The in-plane $g$-factor is found to be
extremely sensitive to the orientation of the quantum point contact, changing
by a factor of $5$ when rotated by $45^{\circ}$. This exceptionally strong
crystal lattice anisotropy of the in-plane Zeeman splitting cannot be explained
within axially symmetric theoretical models. Theoretical modelling based on the
combined Luttinger, Rashba and Dresselhaus Hamiltonians that we use here
reveals new spin-orbit contributions to the in-plane hole $g$-factor and
provides an excellent agreement with our experimental data.

A WSe$_2$ monolayer shows many interesting properties due to its spin-orbit
coupling induced spin splitting in bands around the Fermi level and the
spin-valley configuration. The orientation of the spin polarization in the
relevant bands is crucial for the nature of exciton states and the optical
valley selectivity. In this work, we studied the WSe$_2$ nanoribbons under
different mechanical bending curvatures and electron/hole doping with density
functional theory and their optical absorption and excitonic states with
many-body perturbation GW and BSE (Bethe-Salpeter equation) methods. We found
that the WSe$_2$ nanoribbons can exhibit an enhanced SOC effect and a spatially
varying spin polarization in bands around the Fermi level under bending. The
spin-polarization can show an anisotropy (or asymmetry) in those nearly
degenerate bands, leading to a controllable magnetism via bending and
electron/hole doping to the nanoribbons, suggesting a potential application in
compact and controllable magnetic nanodevices and spintronics. The optical
absorption spectrum of the nanoribbon presents a large tunability with bending
within the near infrared region of about 0.4 to 1.5 eV, showing an enhanced
absorption at a large bending condition. The exciton states generally show
mixed or various spin configuration in the electron and hole pairs that are
controlled by bending, potentially useful for applications in spin-based
quantum information processes.

The Kondo lattice, describing a matrix of local magnetic moments coupled via
spin-exchange interactions to itinerant conduction electrons, is a prototype of
strongly correlated quantum matter. Traditionally, Kondo lattices are realized
in intermetallic compounds containing lanthanide or actinide. The complex
electronic structure and limited tunability of both the electron density and
exchange interactions in these bulk materials pose significant challenges to
study Kondo lattice physics. Here, we report the realization of a synthetic
Kondo lattice in AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 moir\'e bilayers, where the MoTe2 layer
is tuned to a Mott insulating state, supporting a triangular moir\'e lattice of
local moments, and the WSe2 layer is doped with itinerant conduction carriers.
We observe heavy fermions with a large Fermi surface below the Kondo
temperature. We also observe destruction of the heavy fermions by an external
magnetic field with an abrupt decrease of the Fermi surface size and
quasiparticle mass. We further demonstrate widely and continuously gate-tunable
Kondo temperatures through either the itinerant carrier density or Kondo
interaction. Our study opens the possibility of in-situ access to the rich
phase diagram of the Kondo lattice with exotic quantum criticalities in a
single device based on semiconductor moir\'e materials

The dynamical correlated properties of one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases
provide profound understanding of novel physics emergent from collective
excitations, for instance, the breakdown of off-diagonal long-range order, and
the establishment of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) theory. However, due to
the non-perturbative nature of 1D many-body systems, the exact evaluation of
correlation functions is notoriously difficult. Here by means of form factor
approach based on algebraic Bethe ansatz and numerics, we present a thorough
study on the one-body dynamical correlation function (1BDCF) of the
Lieb-Liniger model at finite temperature. The influence of thermal fluctuation
and dynamical interaction on the behavior of 1BDCF has been demonstrated and
analyzed from various perspectives, including the spectral distribution, the
line-shape of 1BDCF, and the static correlations etc. The static correlation
properties, i.e. the momentum distribution and one body density matrix are
shown in good agreement with the TLL prediction.

Topologically ordered phases in $2+1$ dimensions are generally characterized
by three mutually-related features: fractionalized (anyonic) excitations,
topological entanglement entropy, and robust ground state degeneracy that does
not require symmetry protection or spontaneous symmetry breaking. Such
degeneracy is known as topological degeneracy and usually can be seen under the
periodic boundary condition regardless of the choice of the system size $L_1$
and $L_2$ in each direction. In this work we introduce a family of extensions
of the Kitaev toric code to $N$ level spins ($N\geq2$). The model realizes
topologically ordered phases or symmetry-protected topological phases depending
on parameters in the model. The most remarkable feature of the topologically
ordered phases is that the ground state may be unique, depending on $L_1$ and
$L_2$, despite that the translation symmetry of the model remains unbroken.
Nonetheless, the topological entanglement entropy takes the nontrivial value.
We argue that this behavior originates from the nontrivial action of
translations permuting anyon species.

We generalize the iterative diagonalization procedure adopted in method of
numerical renormalization group to analyze the Kondo effect in strong magnetic
fields, where the density of states for itinerary electrons at the chemical
potential varies discontinuously as the magnetic field changes. We first
examine phases of many-body ground states in the presence of single impurity.
By investigating change of $z$-component of total spin, $\Delta S_z$, and
spin-spin correlation between the impurity and conduction electrons, we find
that there are three states competing for the ground state when Zeeman
splitting is present. One of the states is doublet in which the impurity spin
is unscreened. The other two states are Kondo screening states with $\Delta
S_z=1/2$ and $\Delta S_z=1$, in which the impurity spin is partially screened
and completely screened respectively. For Kondo systems with two-impurities in
strong magnetic fields, we find that the interplay between the Kondo screening
effect, RKKY interaction, and quantum oscillations due to Landau levels
determines the ground state of the system. Combination of these three factors
results in different screening scenarios for different phases in which spins of
two impurities can form spin-0 or spin-1 states, while impurity spins in these
phases can be either screened, partially screened, or unscreened by conduction
electrons. The emergence of the ground state from these competing states
oscillates with the change of magnetic field, chemical potential or
inter-impurity distance. This leads to quantum oscillations in magnetization
and conductivity. In particular, we find extra peak structures in longitudinal
conductivity that reflect changes of Kondo screening phases and are important
features to be observed in experiments. Our results provide a complete
characterization of phases for Kondo effect in strong magnetic fields.

We compare the confinement-induced nonlocal electromagnetic response model to
the standard local Drude model routinely used in plasmonics. Both of them are
applied to study the heat transfer for transdimensional plasmonic film systems.
The former provides greater Woltersdorff length in the far-field and larger
film thicknesses at which heat transfer is dominated by surface plasmons,
leading to enhanced near-field heat currents. Our results show that the
nonlocal response model is capable of making a significant impact on the
understanding of the radiative heat transfer in ultrathin films.

We study the silicon vacancy in 3C SiC as a color center of interest in the
field of Quantum Technologies, focusing on its magnetic interaction with the
SiC nuclear spin bath containing Si29 and C13 nuclei in their natural isotopic
concentration. We calculate the system energetic and magnetic properties with
ab initio methods based on the Density Functional Theory, identifying the
neutral charge state of the silicon vacancy as the most favorable for p doped
3C SiC systems. We thereon evaluate the Free Induction Decay and the Hahn echo
sequence on the electron spin interacting with the nuclear spin bath. Here, the
Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation phenomenon, due to single nuclear spin
flipping processes, and the overall decay are highlighted in the context of the
Cluster Correlation Expansion theory. We find a non exponential coherence
decay, which is a typical feature of solid state qubits subjected to low

Photonic crystals and metamaterials are two overarching paradigms for
manipulating light. Combining the two approaches leads to hypercrystals:
hyperbolic dispersion metamaterials that undergo periodic modulation and mix
photonic-crystal-like aspects with hyperbolic dispersion physics. So far, there
has been limited experimental realization of hypercrystals due to various
technical and design constraints. Here, we create nanoscale hypercrystals with
lattice constants ranging from 25 nm to 160 nm and measure their collective
Bloch modes and dispersion with scattering nearfield microscopy. We demonstrate
for the first time dispersion features such as negative group velocity,
indicative of bandfolding, and signatures of sharp density of states peaks,
expected for hypercrystals (and not for ordinary polaritonic crystals). These
density peaks connect our findings to the theoretical prediction of an
extremely rich hypercrystal bandstructure emerging even in geometrically simple
lattices. These features make hypercrystals both fundamentally interesting, as
well as of potential use to engineering nanoscale light-matter interactions.

Antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials possess a well-recognized potential for
ultrafast data processing thanks to their intrinsic ultrafast spin dynamics,
absence of stray fields, and large spin transport effects. The very same
properties, however, make their manipulation difficult, requiring frequencies
in THz range and magnetic fields of tens of Teslas. Switching of AFM order
implies going into the nonlinear regime, a largely unexplored territory. Here
we use THz light from a free electron laser to drive antiferromagnetic NiO into
a highly nonlinear regime and steer it out of nonlinearity with magnetic field
from a 33-Tesla Bitter magnet. This demonstration of large-amplitude dynamics
represents a crucial step towards ultrafast resonant switching of AFM order.

The calculation of pair correlations and density profiles of quasiholes are
routine steps in the study of proposed fractional quantum Hall states.
Nevertheless, the field has not adopted a standard way to present the results
of such calculations in an easily reproducible form. We develop a polynomial
expansion that allows for easy quantitative comparison between different
candidate wavefunctions, as well as reliable scaling of correlation and
quasihole profiles to the thermodynamic limit. We start from the well-known
expansion introduced by Girvin [PRB, 30 (1984)] (see also [Girvin, MacDonald
and Platzman, PRB, 33 (1986)]), which is physically appealing but, as we
demonstrate, numerically unstable.0 We orthogonalize their basis set to obtain
a new basis of modified Jacobi polynomials, whose coefficients can be stably
calculated. We then apply our expansion to extract pair correlation expansion
coefficients and quasihole profiles in the thermodynamic limit for a wide range
of fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions. These include the Laughlin series,
composite fermion states with both reverse and direct flux attachment, the
Moore-Read Pfaffian state, and BS hierarchy states. The expansion procedure
works for both abelian and non-abelian quasiholes, even when the density at the
core is not zero. We find that the expansion coefficients for all quantum Hall
states considered can be fit remarkably well using a cosine oscillation with
exponentially decaying amplitude. The frequency and the decay length are
related in an intuitive, but not elementary way to the filling fraction.
Different states at the same filling fraction can have distinct values for
these parameters. Finally, we also use our scaled correlation functions to
calculate estimates for the magneto-roton gaps of the various states.

Type-II multiferroics, where spin interactions induce a ferroelectric
polarization, are interesting for new device functionalities due to large
magnetoelectric coupling. We report on a new type of multiferroicity in the
quadruple-perovskite
$\text{BiMn}_{\text{3}}\text{Cr}_{\text{4}}\text{O}_{\text{12}}$, where an
antiferromagnetic phase is induced by the structural change at the
ferroelectric phase transition. The displacive nature of the ferroelectric
phase transition at 125 K, with a crossover to an order-disorder mechanism, is
evidenced by a polar soft phonon in the THz range and a central mode.
Dielectric and pyroelectric studies show that the ferroelectric critical
temperature corresponds to the previously reported N\'eel temperature of the
$\text{Cr}^{\text{3+}}$ spins. An increase in ferroelectric polarization is
observed below 48 K, coinciding with the N\'eel temperature of the
$\text{Mn}^{\text{3+}}$ spins. This increase in polarization is attributed to
an enhanced magnetoelectric coupling, as no change in the crystal symmetry
below 48 K is detected from infrared and Raman spectra.

The postulates of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) express that
thermalization occurs due to the individual eigenstate of the system's
Hamiltonian. But the ETH put no light on the dynamics that lead toward
thermalization. In this paper, we observe the thermalization of a Bose-Einstein
Condensate (BEC) confined in an optical lattice potential that is embedded in
the harmonic trap. Such optical lattice potential offers local friction to the
oscillating BEC. The spread in the temporal density plot of BEC shows the
thermalization of the BEC. Moreover, we observe that the presence of a
PT-symmetric potential greatly influences the BEC dynamics and the
thermalization of the system. The presence of a PT-symmetric potential offers a
way to manipulate the mean position of the BEC to the desired location and for
a desired length of time.

The recent experimental verification of the charge-transfer superexchange
mechanism as the microscopic pairing mechanism of high-$T_c$ cuprate
superconductivity by Seamus Davis and collaborators\cite{sea} is a tour de
force! The correct model for cuprates is the three band Emery model in which
oxygen p-orbitals are explicitly taken into account. The doped holes go into
these oxygen p-orbitals where they undergo charge-transfer superexchange with
unpaired electrons in copper d orbitals. This charge transfer superexchange is
the key which leads to bound pairs and superconductivity. In the experimental
verification\cite{sea}, the system chosen is $Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+x}$. What is
achieved is the direct functional dependence of the local electron pair density
($n_P(r)$) on local charge transfer energy ($\ep_{pd}(r)$) using state of the
art single-electron and electron-pair (Josephson) scanning tunneling
microscopy. The quantitative functional dependence of $n_P(r)$ on $\ep_{pd}(r)$
matches with that indicated and deduced by
theory\cite{t1,t2,t3,t4,t5,t6,t7,t8,t9,t10}. The verdict of the experiment
settles the debates on the microscopic mechanisms of the cuprate
superconductivity in the clear favor of charge-transfer superexchange
mechanism. We discuss this development in brief, and present a simple minded
approach to the essence of cuprate superconductivity. We discuss what is
settled now, and what is not settled yet. A "theoretical minimum" of the
high-$T_c$ problem is also discussed.

Here, we investigate the nonreciprocal propagation and amplification of
surface plasmons in drift-current biased graphene, using both Galilean and
relativistic-type Doppler shift transformations of the graphene's conductivity.
Consistent with previous studies, both conductivity models predict strongly
nonreciprocal propagation of surface plasmons due to the drag effect caused by
the drifting electrons. In particular, the Galilean Doppler shift model leads
to stronger spectral asymmetries in the plasmon dispersion with regimes of
unidirectional propagation. Remarkably, it is shown that both conductivity
models predict regimes of nonreciprocal plasmon amplification in a wide angular
sector of in-plane directions when the drift-current biased graphene sheet is
coupled to a plasmonic substrate (namely, SiC), with the plasmon amplification
rate being substantially higher for the relativistic Doppler shift model.

In a recent experiment, a dissipative Aharaonov-Bohm (AB) chain was
implemented in the momentum space of a Bose-Einstein condensate. Formed by a
series of dissipative AB rings threaded by synthetic magnetic flux, the chain
exhibits the non-Hermitian skin effect, necessitating the non-Bloch band theory
to account for its topology. In this work, we systematically characterize
topological features of the dissipative AB chain, particularly beyond the
experimentally realized parameter regime. Further, we show that an
atom-injection spectroscopy is not only capable of revealing topological edge
states, as has been demonstrated in the experiment, but also the general band
structure of the system. We then discuss alternative dynamic detection schemes
for the topological edge states. Given the generality of the model and the
detection schemes, our work is helpful to future study of topological models
with non-Hermitian skin effects across a variety of quantum simulators.

We show that a dissipative two-dimensional Raman lattice can be engineered in
a two-component ultracold atomic gas, where the interplay of the
two-dimensional spin-orbit coupling and lightinduced atom loss gives rise to a
density flow diagonal to the underlying square lattice. The flow is driven by
the non-Hermitian corner skin effect, under which eigenstates localize toward
one corner of the system. We illustrate that the topological edge states of the
system can only be accounted for by the non-Bloch band theory where the
deformation of the bulk eigenstates are explicitly considered. The directional
flow can be detected through the dynamic evolution of an initially localized
condensate in the lattice, or by introducing an immobile impurity species that
interact spin-selectively with a condensate in the ground state of the Raman
lattice.

Ultrastrong light-matter coupling opens exciting possibilities to generate
squeezed quantum states and entanglement.
Here we propose a way to achieve this regime in superconducting hybrid
nanostructures with ferromagnetic interlayers.
Strong confinement of electromagnetic field between superconducting plates is
found to result in the existence of
magnon-polariton modes with ultrastrong magnon-photon coupling, ultra-high
cooperativity and very large group velocities.
These modes provide a numerically accurate explanation of recent experiments
and have intriguing quantum properties.
The magnon-polariton quantum vacuum consists of the squeezed magnon and
photon states with the degree of
squeezing controlled in wide limits by the external magnetic field. The
ground state population of virtual photons
and magnons is shown to be very large which can be used for
generating correlated magnon and photon pairs. Excited states of
magnon-polaritons contain bipartite entanglement between magnons and photons.
This property can be used for transferring entanglement between different
types of quantum systems.

Various defects in ZnO, focused on substitutional N$_O$ and N$_2$ in various
sites, O-site, interstitial and Zn-site are studied using first-principles
calculations with the goal of understanding the electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) center reported for N$_2$ in ZnO and substitutional N on the O-site. The
$g$ tensors are calculated using the gauge including projector augmented wave
(GIPAW) method and compared with experiments. The $g$-tensor of the free
N$_2^+$ and N$_2^-$ radicals and their various contributions within the GIPAW
theory are analyzed first to provide a baseline reference for the accuracy of
the method and for understanding the N$_2$ behavior in ZnO. Previous
controversies on the site location of N$_2$ in ZnO for this EPR center and on
the shallow or deep nature and donor or acceptor nature of this center are
resolved. We find that the N$_2$ on the Zn site is mostly zinc-vacancy like in
its spin density and $g$-tensor, while for the O-site, a model with the N$_2$
axis lying in-the basal plane and the singly occupied $\pi_g$-orbital along the
{\bf c} axis provides good agreement with experiment. For the interstitial
location, if the N$_2$ is not strongly interacting with the surroundings, no
levels in the gap are found and hence also no possible EPR center. The
calculated $g$-tensors for N$_O$ and $V_ Zn$ are also found to be in good
agreement with experiment. The effects of different functionals affecting the
localization of the spin density are shown to affect the $g$-tensor values.

We introduce `PI-Entropy' $\Pi(\tilde{\rho})$ (the Permutation entropy of an
Indexed ensemble) to quantify mixing due to complex dynamics for an ensemble
$\rho$ of different initial states evolving under identical dynamics. We find
that $\Pi(\tilde{\rho})$ acts as an excellent proxy for the thermodynamic
entropy $S(\rho)$ but is much more computationally efficient. We study 1-D and
2-D iterative maps and find that $\Pi(\tilde{\rho})$ dynamics distinguish a
variety of system time scales and track global loss of information as the
ensemble relaxes to equilibrium. There is a universal S-shaped relaxation to
equilibrium for generally chaotic systems, and this relaxation is characterized
by a \emph{shuffling} timescale that correlates with the system's Lyapunov
exponent. For the Chirikov Standard Map, a system with a mixed phase space
where the chaos grows with nonlinear kick strength $K$, we find that for high
$K$, $\Pi(\tilde{\rho})$ behaves like the uniformly hyperbolic 2-D Cat Map. For
low $K$ we see periodic behavior with a relaxation envelope resembling those of
the chaotic regime, but with frequencies that depend on the size and location
of the initial ensemble in the mixed phase space as well as $K$. We discuss how
$\Pi(\tilde{\rho})$ adapts to experimental work and its general utility in
quantifying how complex systems change from a low entropy to a high entropy
state.

$M_{\text{2}}$P$_{\text{2}}$S$_{\text{6}}$ ($M_{\text{2}}$ = Mn$_{\text{2}}$,
MnNi, Ni$_{\text{2}}$), performed at an excitation frequency of 9.56 GHz, in a
broad range of temperatures above the magnetic order, and at different
orientations of the magnetic field with respect to the sample. Analyzing
temperature and angular dependences of the resonance field and of the linewidth
of the Mn$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ compound we have observed a significant change of the
spin dynamics from the dominance of the 3D-like fluctuations close to the
magnetic order to a relative increase of the 2D-like spin fluctuations at
higher temperatures. Such a behavior, which is opposite to the development of
the low-D signatures in the previously studied
Cr$_{\text{2}}$Ge$_{\text{2}}$Te$_{\text{6}}$ compound, can be explained by the
difference in the type of magnetic order in Mn$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ and
Cr$_{\text{2}}$Ge$_{\text{2}}$Te$_{\text{6}}$. On the other hand,
MnNiP$_2$S$_6$ compound exhibits angular dependences of the linewidth typical
for the system with 3D-like spin correlations in the whole measurement
temperature range, however the 2D-like correlations can be seen in the
temperature dependences of the resonance field and the linewidth.
Ni$_2$P$_2$S$_6$, in turn, does not show any 2D signatures. This suggests that
varying the Ni content in (Mn$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ one can control the
exchange interaction, possibly also in the third dimension.

The magnetic coupling mechanisms underlying ferromagnetism and
magnetotransport phenomena in magnetically doped topological insulators have
been a central issue to gain controlled access to the magneto-topological
phenomena such as quantum anomalous Hall effect and topological axion
insulating state. Here, we focus on the role of bulk carriers in magnetism of
the family of magnetic topological insulators, in which the host material is
either Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ or BiSbTe$_{3}$, containing Mn self-organized in
MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ septuple layers. We tune the Fermi level using the electron
irradiation technique and study how magnetic properties vary only through the
change in carrier density. Ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy excludes bulk
magnetism based on a carrier-mediated process. Furthermore, the
magnetotransport measurements show that the anomalous Hall effect is dominated
by the intrinsic and dissipationless Berry-phase driven mechanism, with the
Hall resistivity enhanced near the bottom/top of the conduction/valence band,
due to the Berry curvature which is concentrated near the avoided band
crossings. These results demonstrate that the anomalous Hall effect can be
effectively managed, maximized, or turned off, by adjusting the Fermi level.

Two-dimensional (2D) niobium oxydihalide NbOI$_2$ has been recently
demonstrated as an excellent in-plane piezoelectric and nonlinear optical
materials. Here we show that Janus niobium oxydihalide, NbO$XY$ (X, Y = Cl, Br,
I and X$\neq$Y), is a multifunctional anisotropic semiconductor family with
exceptional piezoelectric, electronic, photocatalytic and optical properties.
NbO$XY$ are stable and mechancially flexible monolayers with band gap around
the visible light regime of $\sim 1.9$ eV. The anisotropic carrier mobility of
NbO$XY$ lies in the range of $10^3 \sim 10^4$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, which
represents some of the highest among 2D semiconductors of bandgap $\gtrsim 2$
eV. Inversion symmetry breaking in Janus NbO$XY$ generates sizable out-of-plane
$d_{31}$ piezoelectric response while still retaining a strong in-plane
piezoelectricity. Remarkably, NbO$XY$ exhibits an additional out-of-plane
piezoelectric response, $d_{32}$ as large as 0.55 pm/V. G$_0$W$_0$-BSE
calculation further reveals the strong linear optical dichroism of NbO$XY$ in
the visible-to-ultraviolet regime. The optical absorption peaks with $14\sim18$
\% in the deep UV regime ($5\sim6$ eV), outperforming the vast majority of
other 2D materials. The high carrier mobility, strong optical absorption,
sizable built-in electric field and band alignment compatible with overall
water splitting further suggest the strengths of NbO$XY$ in energy conversion
application. We further propose a directional stress sensing device to
demonstrate how the out-of-plane piezoelectricity can be harnessed for
functional device applications. Our findings unveil NbO$XY$ as an exceptional
multifunctional 2D semiconductor for flexible electronics, optoelectronics, UV
photonics, piezoelectric and sustainable energy applications.

Edge states forming at the boundaries of topologically non-trivial phases of
matter are promising candidates for future device applications because of their
stability against local perturbations. Magnetically ordered spin chains
proximitized by an s-wave superconductor are predicted to enter a topologically
non-trivial mini-gapped phase with zero-energy Majorana modes (MMs) localized
at their ends. However, the presence of non-topological end states mimicking MM
properties can spoil their unambiguous observation. Here, we report on a method
to experimentally decide on the MM nature of end states observed for the first
time in antiferromagnetic spin chains. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy,
we find end states at either finite or near-zero energy in Mn chains on Nb(110)
or Ta(110), respectively, within a large minigap. By introducing a locally
perturbing defect on one end of the chain, the end state on this side splits
off from zero-energy while the one on the other side doesn't - ruling out their
MM origin. A minimal model shows that, while wide trivial minigaps hosting such
conventional end states are easily achieved in antiferromagnetic spin chains,
unrealistically large spin-orbit couplings are required to drive the system
into the topologically nontrivial phase with MMs. The methodology of perturbing
chains by local defects is a powerful tool to probe the stability of future
candidate topological edge modes against local disorder.

We study a one-dimensional gas of $N$ Brownian particles that diffuse
independently, but are simultaneously reset to the origin at a constant rate
$r$. The system approaches a non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) with
long-range interactions induced by the simultaneous resetting. Despite the
presence of strong correlations, we show that several observables can be
computed exactly, which include the global average density, the distribution of
the position of the rightmost particle, the spacing distribution between two
successive particles and the full counting statistics, i.e., the distribution
of the number of particles in a given interval. Our analytical results are
confirmed by numerical simulations. We also discuss a possible experimental
realisation of this resetting gas using optical traps.

The rigorous diagnostics of experiments with warm dense matter (WDM) is
notoriously difficult. A key method is given by X-ray Thomson scattering
(XRTS), but the interpretation of XRTS measurements is usually based on
theoretical models that entail various approximations. Recently, Dornheim et
al. [arXiv:2206.12805] have introduced a new framework for temperature
diagnostics of XRTS experiments that is based on imaginary-time correlation
functions (ITCF). On the one hand, switching from the frequency- to the
imaginary-time domain gives one direct access to a number of physical
properties, which facilitates the extraction of the temperature of arbitrarily
complex materials without any models or approximations. On the other hand, the
bulk of theoretical works in dynamic quantum many-body theory is devoted to the
frequency-domain, and, to our knowledge, the manifestation of physics
properties within the ITCF remains poorly understood. In the present work, we
aim to change this unsatisfactory situation by introducing a simple,
semi-analytical model for the imaginary-time dependence of two-body
correlations within the framework of imaginary-time path integrals. As a
practical example, we compare our new model to extensive ab initio path
integral Monte Carlo results for the ITCF of a uniform electron gas, and find
excellent agreement over a broad range of wave numbers, densities, and
temperatures.

Data-driven approaches to inferring the local structures responsible for
plasticity in amorphous materials have made substantial contributions to our
understanding of the failure, flow, and rearrangement dynamics of supercooled
fluids. Some of these methods, such as the ``softness'' approach based on
linear support vector machines, have identified combinations of local
structural features of a supercooled particle's environment that predict energy
barriers associated with particle rearrangements. This approach also predicts
the onset temperature, often characterized as the temperature below which the
system's dynamics becomes non-Arrhenius and above which local structures are no
longer predictive of dynamical activity. We implement a transfer-learning
approach in which we first show that classifiers can be trained to predict
dynamical activity even far above the onset temperature. We then show that
applying these classifiers to data from the supercooled phase recovers
essentially the same physical information about the relationship between local
structures and energy barriers that softness does.
