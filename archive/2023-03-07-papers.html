<h3>Tunability of Andreev levels in a spin-active Ising Superconductor/Half  Metal Josephson junction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03784" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03784</a>

<i>Saumen Acharjee, Arindam Boruah, Nimisha Dutta, Reeta Devi</i>

We study the Andreev levels, supercurrent and tunnelling conductance in a
clean Ising superconductor (ISC)/half metal (HM)/Ising superconductor (ISC)
Josephson junction with spin-active interfaces using Bogoliubov-de Gennes
equations. We theoretically demonstrate the effect of spin mixing, spin
flipping processes and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of the ISC on Andreev Bound
States (ABS) spectra, current phase relation (CPR) and tunnelling conductance
in transparent and opaque barrier limit. We witness an additional splitting of
the Andreev levels due to SOC of the ISC and $0 - \pi$ transition for different
barrier magnetic moments. Also, different $\phi$ - junctions can be achieved by
tuning the strength of the barrier magnetic moment and spin mismatch angle.
Moreover, a possible $0 - \pi$ transition can also be achieved for SOC stronger
than the chemical potential of the ISC using suitable control parameters. The
interplay of spin mixing and spin flipping processes with SOC can also host
Majorana modes in the proposed system. The tunnelling conductance is found to
be dependent on the spin mismatch angle. Also, a finite sub-gap conductance is
observed, which indicates different probabilities of Andreev reflected
electrons and holes in the presence of SOC. Furthermore, anomalous Andreev
levels are observed for different HM length scales signifying its role in the
tunability of the $\phi$ - phase Josephson junction.

The ultrafast dynamics of charge carriers in organic donor-acceptor
interfaces are of primary importance to understanding the fundamental
properties of these systems as active components of optoelectronic devices and
solar cells. In this work, we focus on a charge-transfer complex formed by
quaterthiophene $p$-doped by tetrafluoro-tetracyanoquinodimethane and
investigate the influence of vibronic interactions and temperature effects on
the charge-transfer dynamics driven by resonant excitations in the visible
region. The adopted ab initio formalism based on real-time time-dependent
density-functional theory coupled to the Ehrenfest dynamics enables monitoring
the dynamical charge transfer across the interface and assessing the role
played by the nuclear motion. Our results show that in a 100-fs time window,
the coherence of this process is overestimated when the temperature is
neglected. The analysis of the system thermalized at 100, 200, and 300 K
confirms that thermal disorder drastically reduces coherence, and, thus,
effectively reduces charge transfer with respect to the ground state.

<h3>Universal approach to p-wave triplet superconductivity in the Hubbard  models</h3>

Spin-triplet superconductivity is actively pursued in condensed matter
physics due to the potential applications in topological quantum computations.
The related pairing mechanism involving the interaction remains an important
research topic. Here we propose a universal approach to obtain p-wave triplet
superconductivity in the Hubbard models by simply changing the sign of the
hopping amplitudes of the spin-down electrons, and apply it to three prototype
two-dimensional lattices (honeycomb, square, and triangular). The parent
Hamiltonian at half filling has long-range magnetic order, which is
ferromagnetic in all three directions for the frustrated triangular lattices,
and ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) in the xy plane (z direction) for the
bipartite honeycomb and square lattices. The magnetic transitions occur at some
critical interactions on honeycomb and triangular lattices, which are estimated
by finite-size scalings. When the systems are doped, we find the triplet p-wave
pairing is a dominating superconducting instability. We demonstrate its
emergence is closely related to the strong ferromagnetic spin fluctuations
induced by the doping. Our results provide an understanding of the
microscopical triplet-pairing mechanism, and will be helpful in the search for
spin-triplet superconducting materials.

<h3>Statistics of carrier-cargo complexes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04005" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04005</a>
<br>
<i>René Wittmann, Paul A. Monderkamp, Hartmut Löwen</i>
<br>
<br>
We explore the statistics of assembling soft-matter building blocks to
investigate the uptake and encapsulation of cargo particles by carriers
engulfing their load. While the such carrier-cargo complexes are important for
many applications out of equilibrium, such as drug delivery and synthetic cell
encapsulation, we uncover here the basic statistical physics in minimal
hard-core-like models for particle uptake. Introducing an exactly solvable
equilibrium model in one dimension, we demonstrate that the formation of
carrier-cargo complexes can be largely tuned by both the cargo concentration
and the carriers' interior size. These findings are intuitively explained by
interpreting the internal free space (partition function) of the cargo inside a
carrier as its engulfment strength, which can be mapped to an external control
parameter (chemical potential) of an additional effective particle species.
Such a mapping can be generally applied to account for attractive interactions,
multiple cargo uptake and various carrier or cargo species. Within this
effective equilibrium picture, we then suggest to employ effective
non-Boltzmann occupation laws to describe the statistics of non-equilibrium
particle uptake on the coarse-grained level. As a particular example, we put
forward a Bose-Einstein-like phase transition associated with polydisperse
carrier properties.

<h3>First-Principles and Reactive Molecular Dynamics Study of the Elastic  Properties of Pentahexoctite-based Nanotubes</h3>

<br>
<br>
Pentahexoctite (PH) is a pure sp$^2$ hybridized planar carbon allotrope whose
structure consists of a symmetric combination of pentagons, hexagons, and
octagons. The proposed PH structure was shown to be an intrinsically metallic
material exhibiting good mechanical and thermal stability. PH nanotubes (PHNTs)
have also been proposed, and their properties were obtained from first
principles calculations. Here, we carried out fully-atomistic simulations,
combining reactive (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional
theory (DFT) methods, to study the PHNTs elastic properties and fracture
patterns. We have investigated the mechanical properties behavior as a function
of the tube diameter and temperature regimes. Our results showed that the
PHNTs, when subjected to large tensile strains, undergo abrupt structural
transitions exhibiting brittle fracture patterns without a plastic regime.

<h3>TBG as Topological Heavy Fermion: II. Analytical approximations of the  model parameters</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03429" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03429</a>
<br>
<i>Dumitru Călugăru, Maksim Borovkov, Liam L.H. Lau, Piers Coleman, Zhi-Da Song, B. Andrei Bernevig</i>
<br>
<br>
The recently-introduced Topological Heavy Fermion (THF) model [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 129, 047601] of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) aims to reconcile the
quantum-dot-like electronic structure of the latter observed by scanning
tunneling microscopy, with its electron delocalization seen in transport
measurements. The THF model achieves this by coupling localized (heavy)
fermions with anomalous conduction electrons. Originally, the parameters of the
THF model were obtained numerically from the Bistritzer-Macdonald (BM) model of
TBG [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 047601]. In this work, we derive analytical
expressions for the THF model parameters as a function of the twist angle, the
ratio between the tunneling amplitudes at the $AA$ and $AB$ regions ($w_0 /
w_1$), and the screening length of the interaction potential. By numerically
computing the THF model parameters across an extensive experimentally-relevant
parameter space, we show that the resulting approximations are remarkably good,
i.e. within the 30% relative error for almost the entire parameter space. At
the single-particle level, the THF model accurately captures the energy
spectrum of the BM model over a large phase space of angles and tunneling
amplitude ratios. When interactions are included, we also show that the THF
description of TBG is good around the magic angle for realistic values of the
tunneling amplitude ratios ($0.6 \leq w_0/w_1 \leq 1.0$), for which the
hybridization between the localized and conduction fermions $\gamma$ is smaller
than the onsite repulsion of the heavy fermions $U_1$ (i.e. $|\gamma| < U_1$).

<h3>Is the Majorana bound state a gravitationally neutral system?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03430" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03430</a>
<br>
<i>Miguel A. Martin-Delgado</i>
<br>
<br>
An argument is provided that confronts the strong equivalence principle (SEP)
of general relativity with the superposition principle (SP) of quantum
mechanics. The result has implications on the possibility of synthesizing
Majorana bound states in 1D systems or the possible violation of the strong
equivalence principle by quantum effects. The argument is formulated by
inducing a very special fine tuning of coupling constants in the Kitaev
Hamiltonian representing 1D topological superconductors.

<h3>Magnetic domain depinning as possible evidence for two ferromagnetic  phases in LaCrGe$_3$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03447" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03447</a>
<br>
<i>R. R. Ullah, P. Klavins, X. D. Zhu, and V. Taufour</i>
<br>
<br>
Two ferromagnetic phases, FM1 and FM2, were first proposed to exist in
LaCrGe$_3$ based on a broad maximum in the temperature derivative of
resistivity resembling that of the superconducting ferromagnet UGe$_2$ where
FM1 and FM2 are well-established. While evidence for two FM phases can be found
in certain additional probes, corresponding anomalies in magnetization have not
been recognized until now. Our spatially-resolved images of the magnetic
domains show a substantial change in the domain structure between the higher
temperature FM1 phase and the lower temperature FM2 phase. Furthermore, our
measurements of the coercive field and virgin magnetization curves reveal an
unconventional magnetic domain pinning region in the FM1 phase, followed by a
depinning region at lower temperatures where the system is reported to
crossover into the FM2 phase. We incorporate this discovery into a simple
domain magnetization model that demystifies the magnetization curve seen in all
previous studies. Finally, we find that the unusual domain behavior can be
explained by a change in the ferromagnetic exchange interaction and magnetic
moment, both of which are consistent with the existence of two FM phases. This
revelation may help explain a range of anomalous behaviors observed in
LaCrGe$_3$ and rekindles the discussion about the prevalence of multiple FM
phases in fragile FM systems.

<h3>Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians Violate the Eigenstate Thermalization  Hypothesis</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03448" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03448</a>
<br>
<i>Giorgio Cipolloni, Jonah Kudler-Flam</i>
<br>
<br>
The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) represents a cornerstone in
the theoretical understanding of the emergence of thermal behavior in closed
quantum systems. The ETH asserts that expectation values of simple observables
in energy eigenstates are accurately described by smooth functions of the
thermodynamic parameters, with fluctuations and off-diagonal matrix elements
exponentially suppressed in the entropy. We investigate to what extent the ETH
holds in non-Hermitian many-body systems and come to the surprising conclusion
that the fluctuations between eigenstates is of equal order to the average,
indicating no thermalization. We support this conclusion with mathematically
rigorous results in the Ginibre ensemble and numerical results in other
ensembles, including the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, indicating
universality in chaotic non-Hermitian quantum systems.

<h3>Larmor precession in strongly correlated itinerant electron systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03468" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03468</a>
<br>
<i>Erik G. C. P. van Loon, Hugo U. R. Strand</i>
<br>
<br>
Many-electron systems undergo a collective Larmor precession in the presence
of a magnetic field. In a paramagnetic metal, the resulting spin wave provides
insight into the correlation effects generated by the electron-electron
interaction. Here, we use dynamical mean-field theory to investigate the
collective Larmor precession in the strongly correlated regime, where dynamical
correlation effects such as quasiparticle lifetimes and non-quasiparticle
states are essential. We study the spin excitation spectrum, which includes a
dispersive Larmor mode as well as particle-hole excitations that lead to Stoner
damping. We also extract the momentum-resolved Gilbert damping of slow spin
waves. The accurate theoretical description of these phenomena relies on the
Ward identity, which guaranteees a precise cancellation of self-energy and
vertex corrections at long wavelengths.

<h3>Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy for Irregularly-Shaped Samples and its  Application to Uranium Ditelluride</h3>

<br>
<br>
Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) is a powerful technique for measuring
the full elastic tensor of a given material in a single experiment. Previously,
this technique was limited to regularly-shaped samples such as rectangular
parallelepipeds, spheres, and cylinders. We demonstrate a new method for
determining the elastic moduli of irregularly-shaped samples, extending the
applicability of RUS to a much larger set of materials. We apply this new
approach to the recently-discovered unconventional superconductor UTe$_2$ and
provide its elastic tensor at both 300 and 4 kelvin.

<h3>Exact coefficients of finite-size corrections in the Ising model with  Brascamp-Kunz boundary conditions and their relationships for strip and  cylindrical geometries</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03484" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03484</a>
<br>
<i>Nikolay Sh.Izmailian, Ralph Kenna, Vladimir V. Papoyan</i>
<br>
<br>
We derive exact finite-size corrections for the free energy $F$ of the Ising
model on the ${\cal M} \times 2 {\cal N}$ square lattice with Brascamp-Kunz
boundary conditions. We calculate ratios $r_p(\rho)$ of $p$th coefficients of F
for the infinitely long cylinder (${\cal M} \to \infty$) and the infinitely
long Brascamp-Kunz strip (${\cal N} \to \infty$) at varying values of the
aspect ratio $\rho={(\cal M}+1) / 2{\cal N}$. Like previous studies have shown
for the two-dimensional dimer model, the limiting values $p \to \infty$ of
$r_p(\rho)$ exhibit abrupt anomalous behaviour at certain values of $\rho$.
These critical values of $\rho$ and the limiting values of the
finite-size-expansion-coefficient ratios differ, however, between the two
models.

<h3>Machine learning for phase ordering dynamics of charge density waves</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03493" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03493</a>
<br>
<i>Chen Cheng, Sheng Zhang, Gia-Wei Chern</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a machine learning (ML) framework for large-scale dynamical
simulations of charge density wave (CDW) states. The charge modulation in a CDW
state is often accompanied by a concomitant structural distortion, and the
adiabatic evolution of a CDW order is governed by the dynamics of the lattice
distortion. Calculation of the electronic contribution to the driving forces,
however, is computationally very expensive for large systems. Assuming the
principle of locality for electron systems, a neural-network model is developed
to accurately and efficiently predict local electronic forces with input from
neighborhood configurations. Importantly, the ML model makes possible a linear
complexity algorithm for dynamical simulations of CDWs. As a demonstration, we
apply our approach to investigate the phase ordering dynamics of the Holstein
model, a canonical system of CDW order. Our large-scale simulations uncover an
intriguing growth of the CDW domains that deviates significantly from the
expected Allen-Cahn law for phase ordering of Ising-type order parameter field.
This anomalous domain-growth could be attributed to the complex structure of
domain-walls in this system. Our work highlights the promising potential of
ML-based force-field models for dynamical simulations of functional electronic
materials.

<h3>Going Beyond the Cumulant Approximation II:Power Series Correction to  Single Particle Green's Function in 1D Holstein Chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03503" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03503</a>
<br>
<i>Bipul Pandey, Peter B. Littlewood</i>
<br>
<br>
Previously, we introduced a method for systematically correcting a
quasiparticle green's function via a power series expansion. Here we present an
ODE based formalisms of power series correction that goes beyond the cumulant
approximation and implement it to 1D Holstein chain for a wide range of
coupling strengths in a scalable and inexpensive fashion at both zero and
finite temperature. We show that this first differential formalism of the power
series is both qualitatively and quantitatively in excellent agreement with
exact diagonalization results on 1D Holstein chain with dispersive bosons for a
large range of electron-boson coupling strength. We investigate carrier mass
growth rate and carrier energy displacement across a wide range of coupling
strength. Finally, we present a heuristic argument which predicts most of the
rich satellite structure without explicit calculation.

<h3>Optical mapping of non-equilibrium charge carriers</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the energy relaxation segmentation in a resonant tunneling
heterostructures by assessing the optical and transport dynamics of
non-equilibrium charge carriers. The electrical and optical properties are
analyzed using electronic transport measurements combined with electro- and
photoluminescence spectroscopies in continuous-wave mode. The radiative
recombination is mainly governed by the creation of heavy holes \textit{via}
impact ionization processes. Our results suggest hot electrons and holes
populations form independent non-equilibrium systems that do not thermalize
among them and with the lattice. Consequently, the carriers effective
temperature changes independently at different regions of the heterostructure,
with a population distribution for holes colder than for electrons.

<h3>The Role of Nonequilibrium LO Phonons, Pauli Exclusion, and Intervalley  Pathways on the Relaxation of Hot Carriers in InGaAs Multi-Quantum-Well  Structures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03537" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03537</a>

<br>
<br>
Under continuous-wave laser excitation in an InGaAs multi-quantum-well (MQW)
structure, the carrier temperature extracted from photoluminescence rises
faster for 405 nm excitation compared with 980 nm excitation, as the injected
carrier density increases. Ensemble Monte Carlo simulation of the carrier
dynamics in the MQW system shows that this carrier temperature rise is
dominated by nonequilibrium LO phonon effects, with the Pauli exclusion having
a significant effect at high carrier densities. Further, we find a significant
fraction of carriers reside in the satellite L-valleys for 405 nm excitation
due to strong intervalley transfer, leading to a cooler steady-state electron
temperature in the central valley compared with the case when intervalley
transfer is excluded from the model. Good agreement between experiment and
simulation has been shown, and a detailed analysis has been presented. This
study expands our knowledge of the dynamics of the hot carrier population in
semiconductors, which can be applied to further limit energy loss in solar
cells.

<h3>High-temperature magnetization and entropy of the triangular lattice  Hubbard model in a Zeeman field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03550" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03550</a>
<br>
<i>Owen Bradley, Yutan Zhang, Jaan Oitmaa, Rajiv R. P. Singh</i>
<br>
<br>
We use strong coupling expansions to calculate the entropy function $S(T,h)$,
the magnetization $M(T,h)$, and the double occupancy factor $D(T,h)$ for the
half-filled triangular lattice Hubbard model as a function of temperature $T$
and Zeeman field $h$, for various values of the Hubbard parameter ratio $U/t$.
These calculations converge well for temperatures larger than the exchange
parameter $J=\frac{4t^2}{U}$ for moderate to large $U/t$ values. Setting
$\mu=U/2$ suffices to obtain the density of half filling within a fraction of
one percent at all temperatures studied for $U/t \geq 8$. We discuss the
systematic variation of properties with $U/t$. The temperature dependence of
entropy and the double occupancy parameter shows a mapping to an
antiferromagnetic Mott insulating behavior at temperatures well above $T=J$ for
$U/t\ge 10$. Convergence of the series is weaker at intermediate fields
implying non-monotonic variation of spin-correlations with the Zeeman field. We
discuss the relevance of the Hubbard model results to the triangular-lattice
antiferromagnetic materials Lu$_3$Cu$_2$Sb$_3$O$_{14} $ (LCSO) studied recently
by Yang et al [Yang et al arXiv:2102.09271 (2022)].

<h3>Sensing Translocating Polymers via Induced Magnetic Fields</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03563" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03563</a>
<br>
<i>Sahin Buyukdagli</i>

The requirement to boost the resolution of nanopore-based biosequencing
devices necessitates the integration of novel biosensing techniques with
reduced sensitivity to background noise. In this article, we probe the
signatures of translocating polymers in magnetic fields induced by ionic
currents through membrane nanopores. Within the framework of a previously
introduced charge transport theory, we evaluate the magnetic field signals
generated by voltage- and pressure-driven DNA translocation events in
monovalent salt solutions. Our formalism reveals that in voltage-driven
transport, the translocating polymer suppresses the induced magnetic field via
the steric blockage of the ion current through the mid-pore. In the case of
pressure-driven transport, the magnetic field reduction by translocation
originates from the negative electrokinetic contribution of the anionic DNA
surface charges to the streaming current predominantly composed of salt
cations. The magnitude of the corresponding field signals is located in the
nano-Tesla range covered by the resolution of the magnetoelectric sensors able
to detect magnetic fields down to the pico-Tesla range. This suggests that the
integration of magnetic field detection techniques into the current
biosequencing approaches can complement efficiently the conventional biosensing
strategies employing ionic current readouts with high susceptibility to
background noise.

<h3>Field-induced Berry connection and planar Hall effect in tilted Weyl  semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03579" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03579</a>
<br>
<i>YuanDong Wang, Zhen-Gang Zhu, Gang Su</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose the linear and nonlinear planar Hall effect (PHE) in tilted Weyl
semimetals in the presence of an in-plane magnetic and electric field, where
the field-induced Berry connection (FBC) plays a key role. We show that the PHE
is ascribed to the quantum metric, distinct from the well-known chiral
anomaly-induced PHE arising from the Berry curvature. Using a tilting vector to
describe the model, we demonstrate the constrains on the linear and nonlinear
PHE by the tilting directions. The linear PHE is intrinsic that is determined
by the topological properties of energy bands, whereas the nonlinear PHE is
extrinsic. The predicted linear and nonlinear PHE are inherently different from
others and may shed light on a deeper understanding on transport nature of the
tilted Weyl semimetals.

<h3>Structure and dynamics of Fe90Si3O7 liquids close to Earth's liquid core  conditions</h3>

<br>
<i>Ling Tang, Chao Zhang, Yang Sun, Kai-Ming Ho, Renata M. Wentzcovitch, Cai-Zhuang Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
Using an artificial neural-network machine learning interatomic potential, we
have performed molecular dynamics simulations to study the structure and
dynamics of Fe90Si3O7 liquid close to the Earth's liquid core conditions. The
simulation results reveal that the short-range structural order (SRO) in the
Fe90Si3O7 liquid is very strong. About 80% of the atoms are arranged in
crystalline-like SRO motifs. In particular, ~70% of Fe-centered clusters can be
classified as either hexagonal-close-pack (HCP/HCP-like) or icosahedral
(ICO/ICO-like) SRO motifs. The SRO clusters centered on Fe, Si, or O atoms are
strongly intermixed and homogenously distributed throughout the liquid. The
atomic structure of the liquid and the fractions of dominant SRO clusters are
not sensitive to pressure/temperature used in the simulations except that the
SRO of the O-centered clusters is enhanced close to inner core pressures. The O
diffusion coefficient is about 2-3 times larger than the Fe and Si ions and
increases more rapidly in the deeper core regions.

Low-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide, TMDC, materials are
heralding a new era in optoelectronics and valleytronics owing to their unique
properties. Photo-induced dynamics in these systems has mostly been studied
from the perspective of individual quasi-particles, including excitons,
bi-excitons or, even, trions. Their formation, evolution and decay. The role of
multi-body and exciton dynamics, the associated collective behaviour,
condensation and inter-excitonic interactions remain intriguing and seek
attention, especially in room-temperature scenarios which are relevant for
device applications. In this work we evidence the formation and decay of an
unexpected electron-hole quantum liquid phase at room-temperature on ultrafast
picosecond timescales in multi-layer MoS2 nanoparticles through femtosecond
broadband transient absorption spectroscopy. Our studies reveal the complete
dynamical picture: the initial electron-hole plasma, EHP, condenses into an
quantum electron-hole liquid, EHL, phase which typically lasts as long as 10
ps, revealing its robustness, whereafter the system decays through phonons.

<br>
<br>
We investigate the temperature dependence of the linear response of a generic
Fermi liquid to a pair-creating perturbation, referred to as precursory Cooper
flow. We show that the form of this dependence allows for an unbiased
prediction of the BCS transition temperature, $T_c$, from data collected at
temperatures dramatically higher than $T_c$. We employ this technique to
calculate the phase diagram of superconducting states with multiple orbital
channels in a moderately interacting two-dimensional uniform electron gas. Our
analysis of the leading correction to the pair susceptibility reveals the
possibility of predicting the temperature evolution of pairing correlations and
$T_c$ in low-temperature superconductors through the analysis of DC $I$-$V$
characteristics of tunnel junctions at high temperatures.

<br>
<br>
Here we investigate the mechanism of charge-disproportionation (CD) in BaBiO3
(BBO) using density functional theory under different crystal symmetries and by
employing strain as an external perturbation. The competition between Bi 6sp-O
2p (s-p) and O 2p-O 2p (p-p) charge-fluctuations decides the electronic ground
state, charge-disproportionation and bond-disproportionation (BD) in BBO. An
extended Hubbard Hamiltonian involving onsite (U) and long-range (V) coulomb
repulsions is also employed to ascertain the microscopic conditions for the
formation of the lone-pair on bismuth site. A strong tensile strain increases
p-p fluctuation and enhances negative-charge transfer (CT) character, while
strong compressive strain favors s-p fluctuation leading to more positive-CT
character. Bulk BBO is at the verge of positive and negative-CT regimes.

<br>
<br>
We performed a systematic investigation of the correlation between the layer
stacking, structure transition, magnetic and thermal transport properties of
different $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ crystals with T$_N$ varying from 6\,K to 7.6\,K by
measuring magnetic properties, specific heat, neutron single crystal
diffraction, and thermal transport. A small population of stacking disorder
suppresses T$_N$. $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ crystals with a single T$_N$ in the range
of 7.4\,K-7.6 K have minimal amount of stacking disorder and show a well
defined structure transition around 140\,K upon cooling. For those crystals
with T$_N$ below 7\,K, the structure transition occurs well below 140\,K upon
cooling and is incomplete, manifested by the coexistence of both high
temperature and low temperature phases down to the lowest measurement
temperature. Diffuse streaks were observed for these crystals but not for those
with T$_N$ above 7.4\,K. For both types of crystals, oscillatory field
dependent thermal conductivity and plateau-like feature in thermal Hall
resistivity were observed in the field-induced disordered state that may be a
quantum spin liquid. However, $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ crystals with with minimal
amount of stacking disorder have a higher thermal conductivity that pushes the
thermal Hall conductivity to be close to the half-integer quantized value. Our
results demonstrate a strong correlation between the layer stacking, structure
transition, magnetic and thermal transport properties, and highlight the
importance of interlayer coupling in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ despite the weak van der
Waals bonding.

<h3>Hybrid Rydberg-spin qubit of electrons on helium</h3>

<br>
<br>
We theoretically propose a new way to realize qubits: a hybrid qubit system
consisting of the quantized vertical motion (Rydberg states) and the spin
states of electrons on the surface of liquid helium. Introducing a local
magnetic field gradient hybridizes the Rydberg and spin degrees of freedom,
which allows us to benefit from both the long coherence time of the spin state
and the long-range Coulomb interaction between electrons that couples the
Rydberg state. We present concrete schemes to realize single- and two-qubit
gates and quantum-non-demolition read-out. In our framework, the hybridization
of the Rydberg state and the spin state is large enough to perform fast qubit
gates and small enough not to degrade the coherence time of the spin state
significantly, which leads to the realization of high-fidelity qubit gates.

<br>
<br>
The extraordinary mechanical properties of 2D TMDCs make them ideal
candidates for investigating strain-induced control of various physical
properties. Here we explore the role of non-uniform strain in modulating
optical, electronic and transport properties of semiconducting, chemical vapour
deposited monolayer MoS2, on periodically nanostructured substrates. A
combination of spatially resolved spectroscopic and electronic properties
explore and quantify the differential strain distribution and carrier density
on a monolayer, as it conformally drapes over the periodic nanostructures. The
observed accumulation in electron density at the strained regions is supported
by theoretical calculations which form the likely basis for the ensuing 60x
increase in field effect mobility in strained samples. Though spatially
non-uniform, the pattern induced strain is shown to be readily controlled by
changing the periodicity of the nanostructures thus providing a robust yet
useful macroscopic control on strain and mobility in these systems.

<br>
<br>
A methodology to test the interlayer bonding strength of two-dimensional (2D)
surfaces and associated one (1D)- and two (2D)- dimensional surface defects
using scanning tunneling microscope tip-induced deformation, is demonstrated.
Surface elastic deformation characteristics of soft 2D monatomic sheets of
graphene and graphite in contrast to NbSe2 indicates related association with
the underlying local bonding configurations. Surface deformation of 2D
graphitic moire patterns reveal the inter-layer van der Waals strength varying
across its domains. These results help in the understanding of the comparable
interlayer bonding strength of 1D grain boundary as well as the grains.
Anomalous phenomena related to probing 2D materials at small gap distances as a
function of strain is discussed.

<h3>Electrostatic theory of the acidity of the solution in the lumina of  viruses and virus-like particles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03722" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03722</a>
<br>
<i>H. J. Muhren, Paul van der Schoot</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, Maassen et al. measured an appreciable pH difference between the
bulk solution and the solution in the lumen of virus-like particles,
self-assembled in an aqueous buffer solution containing the coat proteins of a
simple plant virus and polyanions. [Maassen, S. J.; et al. Small 2018, 14,
1802081] They attribute this to the Donnan effect, caused by an imbalance
between the number of negative charges on the encapsulated polyelectrolyte
molecules and the number of positive charges on the RNA binding domains of the
coat proteins that make up the virus shell or capsid. By applying
Poisson-Boltzmann theory, we confirm this conclusion and show that simple
Donnan theory is accurate even for the smallest of viruses and virus-like
particles. This, in part, is due to the additional screening caused by the
presence of a large number of immobile charges in the cavity of the shell. The
presence of a net charge on the outer surface of the capsid we find in practice
to not have a large effect on the pH shift. Hence, Donnan theory can indeed be
applied to connect the local pH and the amount of encapsulated material. The
large shifts up to a full pH unit that we predict must have consequences for
applications of virus capsids as nanocontainers in bionanotechnology and
artificial cell organelles.

<h3>Characteristic nanoscale deformations on large area coherent graphite  moiré</h3>

Highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HoPG) may be the only known monatomic
crystal with the ability to host naturally formed moire patterns on its cleaved
surfaces, which are coherent over micrometer scales and with discrete sets of
twist angles of fixed periodicity. Such an aspect is in marked contrast to
twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and other multilayered systems, where the long
range coherence of the moire is not easily maintained due to twist angle
disorder. We investigate the electronic and mechanical response of coherent
graphite moire patterns through inducing external strain from STM tip-induced
deformation. Consequently, unique anisotropic mechanical characteristics are
revealed. For example, a lateral widening of one-dimensional (1D) domain walls
(DWs) bridging Bernal (ABA) and rhombohedral (ABC) stacking domains (A, B and C
refer to the atomic layer positioning), was indicated. Further, in situ
tunneling spectroscopy as a function of the deformation indicated a tendency
towards increased electrical conductance, which may be associated with a higher
density of electronic states, and the consequent flattening of the electronic
energy band dispersion. Such features were probed across the DWs, with
implications for strain-induced electronic modulation of the moire
characteristics.

We explore the Casimir-Lifshitz free energy theory for surface freezing of
methane gas hydrates near the freezing point of water. The theory enables us to
explore different pathways, resulting in anomalous (stabilising) ice layers on
methane hydrate surfaces via energy minimization. Notably, we will contrast the
gas hydrate material properties, under which thin ice films can form in water
vapor, with those required in the presence of liquid water. It is predicted
that methane hydrates in water vapor near the freezing point of water nucleate
ice films but not water films.

<h3>Colossal nonreciprocal Hall effect and the breakdown of Ohm's law due to  a room temperature nonlinear Hall effect</h3>

<br>
<br>
Nonreciprocal charge transport in quantum materials has attracted enormous
interest since it offers an avenue to investigate quantum symmetry related
physics and holds many prospective applications such as rectification and
photodetection over a wide range of frequencies. The nonreciprocal transport
reported to date occurs along the longitudinal direction with the nonreciprocal
resistance limited to a few percent of the ohmic resistance. Here we report a
transverse nonreciprocal transport phenomenon with divergent nonreciprocity -
colossal nonreciprocal Hall effect. This is revealed in direct current (DC)
transport measurements on microscale crystals of the Weyl semimetal NbP at zero
magnetic field. When a DC ($I_a$) is applied along its a-axis, it generates a
voltage along the c-axis ($V_c$) near room temperature, with $V_c$
quadratically scaling with $I_a$. The transverse resistance, which shows a sign
reversal upon switching the current direction, results from a colossal
intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) rooted in the band topology and quantum
symmetry. Such a NLHE yields an exceptionally large Hall angle ${\Theta_H}$,
e.g. ${\Theta_H}$ = 39{\deg} at $I_a$ =1 mA at 330K, far exceeding the record
value (~ 12{\deg}) of the anomalous Hall angle at room temperature in magnetic
conductors. Furthermore, we find the large Hall field also results in an
unprecedented bulk electrical field effect, which increases the longitudinal
conductivity, thus causing the breakdown of Ohm's law. These results not only
demonstrate the concept of nonreciprocal Hall effect for the first time but
also pave the way for developing NLHE-based quantum sensors for transformative
advancement in communication technology and energy harvesting.

<br>
The triangular lattice antiferromagnet (TLAF) has been the standard paradigm
of frustrated magnetism for several decades. The most common magnetic ordering
in insulating TLAFs is the 120 structure. However, a fundamentally new triple-Q
chiral state can emerge in metallic TLAFs, which represents the short
wavelength limit of magnetic skyrmion crystals. We report the metallic TLAF
Co1/3TaS2 as the first example of tetrahedral triple-Q ordering with the
associated topological Hall effect (non-zero {\sigma}xy(H=0)) and uniform
orbital magnetization Mz(H=0). Our measurements of the inelastic neutron
scattering cross section are also consistent with the calculated dynamical
structure factor of the tetrahedral triple-Q state.

<br>
Achieving vibrational mode selectivity to control molecular properties is a
challenging task that has become greatly facilitated by vibrational strong
coupling. Here we show that strongly coupling the vibrational transitions of
polystyrene (PS) and poly (benzyl-methacrylate) (PBMA) to the vacuum
electromagnetic field of the cavity enhances the electrical conductance by
several orders of magnitude. Remarkably, the extraordinary enhancement of
electrical conductance in PS is mode-selective to the vibrational strong
coupling (VSC) of the aromatic ring out-of-plane bending transitions
corresponding to B2 symmetry. The delocalized hybrid light-matter states formed
under VSC could promote extended vibronic coherence, enhancing the electrical
conductance. These experiments are done without any light excitation,
demonstrating the role of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations in controlling
the long-range coherent transport in molecular materials.

<h3>On the electric charge of quantized vortices and the dipole moment of  vortex pairs and rings in a magnetic field</h3>

<br>
<i>A. M. Konstantinov, S. I. Shevchenko</i>
<br>
<br>
It is shown that, in the presence of a magnetic field, a quantized vortex
line in a superfluid liquid acquires a linear polarization charge, which is
localized near the vortex axis over a length on the order of the coherence
length. It is found that the total charge of a rectilinear vortex is nonzero,
while the vortex pair and vortex ring have a nonzero dipole moment. The
electric fields of rectilinear vortices near the end surface of a cylindrical
vessel filled with a superfluid liquid are calculated. The electric
polarization of superfluid systems in the presence of thermally activated
vortex pairs and vortex rings has been studied. It is shown that such a
polarization arises in the presence of relative motion of the normal and
superfluid components.

<h3>Adiabaticity enhancement in the classical transverse field Ising chain,  and its effective non-Hermitian description</h3>

<br>
<i>B. Dóra, R. Moessner</i>
<br>
<br>
We analyse the near-adiabatic dynamics in a ramp through the critical point
(CP) of the classical transverse field Ising chain. This is motivated,
conceptually, by the fact that this CP -- unlike its quantum counterpart --
experiences no thermal or quantum fluctuations, and technically by the
tractability of its effective model. For a `half-ramp' from ferromagnet to CP,
the longitudinal and transverse magnetization scale as $\tau^{-1/3}$ and
$\tau^{-2/3}$, respectively, with $1/\tau$ the ramp rate, in accord with
Kibble-Zurek theory. For ferro- to paramagnetic ramps across the CP, however,
they stay closer, $\tau^{-1/2}$ and $\tau^{-1}$, to adiabaticity. This
adiabaticity enhancement compared to the half ramp is understood by casting the
dynamics in the paramagnet in the form of a non-hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian,
with the CP playing the role of an exceptional point, opening an additional
decay channel.

<br>
<br>
The present study explores the edge states in a finite-width graphene ribbon
and a semi-infinite geometry subject to a perpendicular magnetic field and an
in-plane electric field, applied perpendicular to a zigzag edge. To accomplish
this, a combination of analytic and numerical methods within the framework of
low-energy effective theory is employed. Both the gapless and gapped Dirac
fermions in graphene are considered. It is found that a surface mode localized
at the zigzag edge remains dispersionless even in the presence of electric
field. This is shown analytically by employing Darwin's expansion of the
parabolic cylinder functions of large order and argument.

A magnetic insulator is an ideal platform to propagate spin information by
exploiting magnon currents. However, until now, most studies have focused on
Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (YIG) and a few other ferri- and antiferromagnetic
insulators, but not on pure ferromagnets. In this study, we demonstrate for the
first time that magnon currents can propagate in ferromagnetic insulating thin
films of EuS. By performing both local and non-local transport measurements in
18-nm-thick films of EuS using Pt electrodes, we detect magnon currents arising
from thermal generation by the spin Seebeck effect. By comparing the dependence
of the local and non-local signals with the temperature (< 30 K) and magnetic
field (< 9 T), we confirm the magnon transport origin of the non-local signal.
Finally, we extract the magnon diffusion length in the EuS film (~140 nm), a
short value in good correspondence with the large Gilbert damping measured in
the same film.

Semiconducting nanowires with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the
proximity with a superconductor and under a strong Zeeman field can potentially
manifest Majorana zero modes at their edges and are a topical candidate for
topological superconductivity. However, protocols for their detection based on
the local and the non-local conductance spectroscopy have been subject to
intense scrutiny. In this work, by taking current experimental setups into
account, we detail mathematical ideas related to the entanglement entropy and
the fermion parity fluctuations to faithfully distinguish between true Majorana
zero modes and trivial quasi-Majorana zero modes. We demonstrate that the
disconnected entanglement entropy, derived from the von Neumann entanglement
entropy, provides a distinct and robust signature of the topological phase
transition which is immune to system parameters, size and disorders. In order
to understand the entanglement entropy of the Rashba nanowire system, we
establish its connection to a model of interacting spinfull Kitaev chains.
Moreover, we relate the entanglement entropy to the fermionic parity
fluctuation, and show that it behaves concordantly with entanglement entropy,
hence making it a suitable metric for the detection of Majorana zero modes. In
connection with the topological gap protocol that is based on the conductance
spectra, the aforesaid metrics can reliably point toward the topological
transitions even in realistic setups.

<h3>Electronic excitations of the charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond  obtained using time-independent variational density functional calculations</h3>

Elucidation of the mechanism for optical spin initialization of point defects
in solids in the context of quantum applications requires an accurate
description of the excited electronic states involved. While variational
density functional calculations have been successful in describing the ground
state of a great variety of systems, doubts have been expressed in the
literature regarding the ability of such calculations to describe electronic
excitations of point defects. A direct orbital optimization method is used here
to perform time-independent, variational density functional calculations of a
prototypical defect, the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond.
The calculations include up to 512 atoms subject to periodic boundary
conditions and the excited state calculations require similar computational
effort as ground state calculations. Contrary to some previous reports, the use
of local and semi-local density functionals gives the correct ordering of the
low-lying triplet and singlet states, namely ${}^{3}A_2 < {}^{1}E < {}^{1}A_1 <
{}^{3}E$. Furthermore, the more advanced meta generalized gradient
approximation functionals give results that are in remarkably good agreement
with high-level, many-body calculations as well as available experimental
estimates, even for the excited singlet state which is often referred to as
having multireference character. The lowering of the energy in the triplet
excited state as the atom coordinates are optimized in accordance with
analytical forces is also close to the experimental estimate and the resulting
zero-phonon line triplet excitation energy is underestimated by only 0.15 eV.
The approach used here is found to be a promising tool for studying electronic
excitations of point defects in, for example, systems relevant for quantum
technologies.

Janus transition metal dichalcogenides are an emerging class of atomically
thin materials with engineered broken mirror symmetry that gives rise to
long-lived dipolar excitons, Rashba splitting, and topologically protected
solitons. They hold great promise as a versatile nonlinear optical platform due
to their broadband harmonic generation tunability, ease of integration on
photonic structures, and nonlinearities beyond the basal crystal plane. Here,
we study second and third harmonic generation in MoSSe and WSSe Janus
monolayers. We use polarization-resolved spectroscopy to map the full
second-order susceptibility tensor of MoSSe, including its out-of-plane
components. In addition, we measure the effective third-order susceptibility,
and the second-order nonlinear dispersion close to exciton resonances for both
MoSSe and WSSe at room and cryogenic temperatures. Our work sets a bedrock for
understanding the nonlinear optical properties of Janus transition metal
dichalcogenides and probing their use in the next-generation on-chip

Tuning the Gilbert damping of ferromagnetic (FM) metals via a nonvolatile way
is of importance to exploit and design next-generation novel spintronic
devices. Through systematical first-principles calculations, we study the
magnetic properties of the van der Waals heterostructure of two-dimensional FM
metal CrTe2 and ferroelectric (FE) In2Te3 monolayers. The ferromagnetism of
CrTe2 is maintained in CrTe2/In2Te3 and its magnetic easy axis can be switched
from in-plane to out-of-plane by reversing the FE polarization of In2Te3.
Excitingly, we find that the Gilbert damping of CrTe2 is tunable when the FE
polarization of In2Te3 is reversed from upward to downward. By analyzing the
k-dependent contributions to the Gilbert damping, we unravel that such
tunability results from the changed intersections between the bands of CrTe2
and Fermi level on the reversal of the FE polarizations of In2Te3 in
CrTe2/In2Te3. Our work provides an appealing way to electrically tailor Gilbert
dampings of two-dimensional FM metals by contacting them with ferroelectrics.

<h3>A Key Observable for Linear Thermalization</h3>

It has been attracting much attention how an isolated quantum many-body
system thermalizes, that is, how it relaxes to a thermal equilibrium state. For
such studies, the fundamental issue is to determine whether a given system
thermalizes or not. However, most studies tested only a small number of
observables, and it was unclear whether other observables thermalize. Here, we
study whether `linear thermalization' occurs for all additive observables: We
consider a quantum many-body system prepared in an equilibrium state and its
unitary time evolution induced by a small change $\Delta f$ of a physical
parameter $f$ of the Hamiltonian, and examine whether all additive observables
relax to the equilibrium values in a manner fully consistent with
thermodynamics up to the linear order in $\Delta f$. We find that there exists
a single key observable whose linear thermalization guarantees, under
physically reasonable conditions, linear thermalization of all additive
observables. Such a linear thermalization occurs in the timescale of
$\mathcal{O}(|\Delta f|^0)$, and lasts at least for a period of
$o(1/\sqrt{|\Delta f|})$. We identify the key observable as the additive
observable conjugate to $f$. We also consider linear thermalization against the
change of other parameters, and find that linear thermalization of the key
observable against $\Delta f$ guarantees its linear thermalization against
small changes of any other parameters. Furthermore, we discuss the generalized
susceptibilities for cross responses and their consistency between quantum
mechanics and thermodynamics. We demonstrate our main result by performing
numerical calculations for spin models. The present paper offers an efficient
way of judging linear thermalization because it guarantees that examination of
the single key observable is sufficient.

<br>
<br>
We report electrical and thermal transport properties of single crystalline
kagome metals $A$Ti$_3$Bi$_5$ ($A$ = Rb, Cs). Different from the structural
similar kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$, no charge density wave
instabilities are found in $A$Ti$_3$Bi$_5$. At low temperatures below 5 K,
signatures of superconductivity appear in $A$Ti$_3$Bi$_5$ as seen in
magnetization measurements. However, bulk superconductivity is not evidenced by
specific heat results. Similar to $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$, $A$Ti$_3$Bi$_5$ show
nonlinear magnetic field dependence of the Hall effect below about 70 K,
pointing to a multiband nature. Unlike $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ in which phonons and
electron-phonon coupling play important roles in thermal transport, the thermal
conductivity in $A$Ti$_3$Bi$_5$ is dominated by electronic contributions.
Moreover, our calculated electronic structure suggests that van Hove
singularities are sitting well above the Fermi energy. Compared with
$A$V$_3$Sb$_5$, the absence of charge orders in $A$Ti$_3$Bi$_5$ is closely
associated with minor contributions from electron-phonon coupling and/or van
Hove singularities.

<h3>The Role of Self-Torques in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide/Ferromagnet  Bilayers</h3>

<br>
<br>
Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been extensively
studied for their efficient spin-orbit torque generation in TMD/ferromagnetic
bilayers, owing to their large spin-orbit coupling, variety in crystal
symmetries, and pristine interfaces. Although the TMD layer was considered
essential for the generation of the observed SOTs, recent reports show the
presence of a self-torque in single-layer ferromagnetic devices with magnitudes
comparable to TMD/ferromagnetic devices. Here, we perform second-harmonic Hall
SOT measurements on metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) grown
MoS$_{2}$/permalloy/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ devices and compare them to a single-layer
permalloy/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ device to accurately disentangle the role of
self-torques from contributions from the TMD layer. We report a damping-like
self-torque conductivity of opposite sign in our single-layer
permalloy/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ device compared to one
MoS$_{2}$/permalloy/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ device, and find no significant one for all
other MoS$_{2}$/permalloy/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ devices. This indicates a competition
between the self-torque and the torque arising from the TMD layer, which would
reduce the observed torque in these bilayers. In addition, we find a field-like
spin-torque conductivity of comparable magnitude to control
MoS$_{2}$/permalloy/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ devices, indicating only a minor role of
the MoS$_{2}$ layer. Finally, we find a linear dependence of the SOT
conductivity on the Hall bar leg/channel width ratio of our devices, indicating
that the Hall bar dimensions are of significant importance for the reported SOT
strength. Our results accentuate the importance of delicate details, like
device asymmetry, Hall bar dimensions, and self-torque generation, for the
correct disentanglement of the microscopic origins underlying the SOTs,
essential for future energy-efficient spintronic applications.

<h3>Localized states coupled to a network of chiral modes in minimally  twisted bilayer graphene</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Minimally twisted bilayer graphene in the presence of an interlayer bias
develops a triangular network of valley chiral modes that propagate along the
$AB/BA$ interfaces and scatter at the $AA$ regions. The low energy physics of
the resulting network can be captured by means of a phenomenological scattering
network model, allowing to calculate the energy spectrum and the
magnetoconductance in a straightforward way. Although there is in general a
good agreement between microscopic and phenomenological models, there are some
aspects that have not been captured so far with the latter. In particular, the
appearance of flatbands in the energy spectrum associated to a localized
density of states at the $AA$ regions. To bring both approaches closer
together, we modify the previous energy independent phenomenological model and
add the possibility to scatter to a set of discrete energy levels at the $AA$
regions, yielding a $S$ matrix with energy dependent parameters. Furthermore,
we investigate the impact of Coulomb repulsion in these regions on a mean-field
level and discuss possible effects of decoherence due to elastic and inelastic
cotunneling events.

<br>
<br>
We report on a realistic and rather general scheme where noncollinear
magnetic textures proximitized with the most common $s$-wave superconductor can
appear as the alternative to $p$-wave superconductor{--}the prime proposal to
realize two-dimensional (2D) Kitaev model for topological superconductors
(TSCs) hosting Majorana flat edge mode (MFEM). A general minimal Hamiltonian
suitable for magnet/superconductor heterostructures reveals robust MFEM within
the gap of Shiba bands, spatially localized at the edges of a 2D magnetic
domain of spin-spiral. We finally verify this concept by considering Mn (Cr)
monolayer grown on a $s$-wave superconducting substrate, Nb(110) under strain
(Nb(001)). In both 2D cases, the antiferromagnetic spin-spiral solutions
exhibit robust MFEM at certain domain edges. This approach, particularly when
the MFEM appears in the TSC phase for such heterostructure materials, offers a
perspective to extend the realm of the TSC in 2D.

We consider pairs of GOE (Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble) matrices which are
correlated with each others, and subject to additive and multiplicative
rank-one perturbations. We focus on the regime of parameters in which the
finite-rank perturbations generate outliers in the spectrum of the matrices. We
investigate the statistical correlation (i.e., the typical overlap) between the
eigenvectors associated to the outlier eigenvalues of each matrix in the pair,
as well as the typical overlap between the outlier eigenvector of one matrix
with the eigenvectors in the bulk of the spectrum of the other matrix. We
discuss implications of these results for the signal recovery problem for
spiked matrices, as well as for problems of high-dimensional random landscapes.

<h3>Intersite Coulomb repulsion driven quadrupole instability and magnetic  ordering in the orbital frustrated Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$</h3>

<br>
<br>
We develop an unrestricted Hartree-Fock mean-field method including Coulomb
interaction U, V and spin orbital coupling $\lambda$ self$-$consistently to
investigate the mechanism of structural instability and magnetic ordering in
Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$. A comprehensive quadrupole phase diagram versus U and V with
$\lambda$=0.28eV is calculated. Our results demonstrate that, while U and
$\lambda$ mainly lead to the onsite quadrupole $Q_{x^2-y^2}$ and
$Q_{3z^2-r^2}$, the intersite Coulomb repulsion V would arrange $Q_{x^2-y^2}$
antiparallelly, accompanied with small parallel $Q_{3z^2-r^2}$, and stabilize
Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ into the body-centered tetragonal structure. Such antiparallel
$Q_{x^2-y^2}$ provides a new mechanism of Dzyaloshinskii$-$Moriya interaction,
and give rise to the canted antiferromagnetic (CAF) state along [110] axis.
Moreover, sizable octupoles such as $O_{21}^{31}$,$O_{21}^{33}$,$O_{21}^{34}$
and $O_{21}^{36}$ are discovered for the first time in CAF states. Our study
not only provides a comprehensive understanding of the nature and exotic
properties in Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$, but also reveal some commonality of 5d
compounds.

<h3>Three-dimensional study of grain scale tensile twinning activity in Mg:  A combination of microstructure characterization and mechanical modeling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04024" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04024</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Tensile twinning is a main deformation mode in hexagonal close packed
structure metals, so it is important to comprehensively understand twinning
mechanisms which are not fully disclosed using 2D or small volume 3D
characterization techniques. A large area 3D electron backscatter diffraction
(EBSD) measurement and crystal plasticity modeling were carried out to
investigate the tensile twinning behaviors in a Mg alloy. The results showed
that tensile twinning activity was underestimated using conventional 2D EBSD
scans. When compressed to yield point, the examined twin frequency with 2D was
lower than that using 3D EBSD. The effects of Schmid factor (SF) on twinning
were investigated. Almost all high Schmid factor (SF>0.35) grains were twinned.
A surprising high twin frequency of 82% in middle SF (0.35>=SF>=0.15) grains
was observed, which was unexpected since the middle SF grains were believed to
be unfavorable for twinning. The twin frequency in low SF (SF<0.15) grains was
slightly increased from 2D to 3D EBSD due to the small volume of twins. The
shear stress maintained a high level and was homogeneously distributed in high
SF grains, facilitating twin nucleation and growth. The shear stress was
distributed heterogeneously within the middle SF grains, and twins were
nucleated within areas with positive shear stress. The shear stress in low SF
grains was not favorable for twinning and twins occurred in the vicinity of
stress accumulation. Twinning activities in the same grain varied on different
layers. It was attributed to the stress fluctuation derived from grain
environment changes.

Following a well-established practice of publishing commentaries to articles
of other authors who work on materials that were earlier studied by them (n.b.
six published comments[1-6]), Marek Szafra\'nski(MS) and Andrzej Katrusiak (AK)
have filed on the preprint server arXiv a manuscript entitled "On the giant
deformation and ferroelectricity of guanidinium nitrate"[7] with comments on
our article "Exceptionally high work density of a ferroelectric dynamic organic
crystal around room temperature" published in Nature Communications (2022, 13,
2823).[8] Both in the submitted comment as well as in the required (by the
journal) direct communication with us preceding its posting, MS and AK have
expressed dissatisfaction with the choice of literature references in our
article, for which they felt that their previous work on this material has not
been cited to a sufficient extent. In their comment, they summarize their other
remarks on our article as "the structural determinations of GN [guanidinium
nitrate] crystals, their phase transitions and associated giant deformation, as
well as its detailed structural mechanism, the molecular dynamics and
dielectric properties were reported before, while the semiconductivity,
ferroelectricity, and fatigue resistance of the GN [guanidinium nitrate]
crystals cannot be confirmed."[7] Apart from the sentiments of MS and AK on our
choice of cited literature, we find their comments on the scientific content of
our article to be strongly biased towards their own results and unfounded.

<h3>Time-Reversal Soliton Pair In Higher-Order Topological Insulators With  Cs=2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04031" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04031</a>
<br>
<i>Yi-Chun Hung, Baokai Wang, Arun Bansil, Hsin Lin</i>
<br>
<br>
Solitons formed through the one-dimensional mass-kink mechanism on the edges
of two-dimensional systems with non-trivial topologies play an important role
in the emergence of higher-order topological phases. In this connection, the
existing work in time-reversal symmetric systems has focused on gapping Dirac
cones below the Fermi level or the Dirac cones with particle-hole symmetry,
which is unsuitable for the edge solitons in the common spin-Chern insulators.
Here, we discuss the mass-kink mechanism in systems where
time-reversal-symmetric perturbations open gaps in the time-reversal-related
Dirac cones. We thus explain the appearance of pairwise corner modes and
predict the emergence of extra charges around the corners. By following the
phase evolution of the corner modes along the edge of a nanodisk, we
demonstrate that the in-gap corner modes and the extra charges around the
corner can be generated through the mass-kink mechanism driven by the Sz-mixing
spin-orbit coupling. We thus provide strong evidence that a spin-Chern
insulator with spin-Chern number Cs=2 is a higher-order topological insulator
with protected corner charges.

The review considers statistical systems composed of several phases that are
intermixed in space at mesoscopic scale and systems representing a mixture of
several components of microscopic objects. These types of mixtures should be
distinguished from the Gibbs phase mixture, where the system is filled by
macroscopic pieces of phases. The description of the macroscopic Gibbs mixture
is rather simple, consisting in the consideration of pure phases separated by a
surface, whose contribution becomes negligible in thermodynamic limit. The
properties of mixtures, where phases are intermixed at mesoscopic scale, are
principally different. The emphasis in the review is on the matter with phases
mixed at mesoscopic scale. Heterogeneous materials composed of mesoscopic
mixtures are ubiquitous in nature. A general theory of such mesoscopic mixtures
is presented and illustrated by several condensed matter models. A mixture of
several components of microscopic objects is illustrated by clustering
quark-hadron matter.

<h3>Full counting statistics in a Majorana single-charge transistor</h3>

We study full counting statistics of electron transport through a Majorana
single-charge transistor. At low bias voltage, transport is dominated by the
so-called Josephson-Majorana cycle, a sequence of normal and anomalous
single-charge and Josephson tunneling. Factorial cumulants characterizing the
full counting statistics elucidate the correlated nature of the charge
transfers in this cycle. Moreover, we predict a topological transition in the
full counting statistics from a perfect Poissonian transfer of Cooper pairs to
a correlated switching between two distinct fermion parity states with
increasing Josephson coupling.

<h3>Large modulation of thermal transport in 2D semimetal triphosphides by  doping-induced electron-phonon coupling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04060" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04060</a>
<br>
<i>Yongchao Rao, C. Y. Zhao, Lei Shen, Shenghong Ju</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent studies demonstrate that novel 2D triphosphides semiconductors possess
high carrier mobility and promising thermoelectric performance, while the
carrier transport behaviors in 2D semimetal triphosphides have never been
elucidated before. Herein, using the first-principles calculations and
Boltzmann transport theory, we reveal that the electron-phonon coupling can be
significant and thus greatly inhibits the electron and phonon transport in
electron-doped BP3 and CP3. The intrinsic heat transport capacity of flexural
acoustic phonon modes in the wrinkle structure is largely suppressed arising
from the strong out-of-plane phonon scatterings, leading to the low phonon
thermal conductivity of 1.36 and 5.33 W/(mK) for BP3 and CP3 at room
temperature, and at high doping level, the enhanced scattering from electron
diminishes the phonon thermal conductivity by 71% and 54% for BP3 and CP3,
respectively. Instead, electron thermal conductivity shows nonmonotonic
variations with the increase of doping concentration, stemming from the
competition between electron-phonon scattering rates and electron group
velocity. It is worth noting that the heavy-doping effect induced strong
scattering from phonon largely suppresses the electron transport and reduces
electron thermal conductivity to the magnitude of phonon thermal conductivity.
This work sheds light on the electron and phonon transport properties in
semimetal triphosphides monolayer and provides an efficient avenue for the
modulation of carrier transport by doping-induced electron-phonon coupling
effect.

<h3>Diffusion of light in turbid media and Kubelka-Munk theory</h3>

<br>
<br>
We show that the Kubelka-Munk equations for the description of the intensity
transfer of light in turbid media are equivalent to a one-dimensional diffusion
equation, which is obtained by averaging the three-dimensional diffusion
equation over the lateral directions. This enables us to identify uniquely the
Kubelka-Munk parameters and derive expressions for diffuse reflection and
transmission coefficients including the effect of internal reflections. Without
internal reflections we recover the Kubelka-Munk formulas for these
coefficients. We show that the Kubelka-Munk equations are the proper
radiative-transfer equations for the one-dimensional diffusion problem and
comment on previous attempts to derive the Kubelka-Munk equations.

<br>
Photonic crystals -- a class of materials whose optical properties derive
from their structure in addition to their composition -- can be created by
self-assembling particles whose sizes are comparable to the wavelengths of
visible light. Proof-of-principle studies have shown that DNA can be used to
guide the self-assembly of micrometer-sized colloidal particles into fully
programmable crystal structures with photonic properties in the visible
spectrum. However, the extremely temperature-sensitive kinetics of
micrometer-sized DNA-functionalized particles has frustrated attempts to grow
large, monodisperse crystals that are required for photonic metamaterial
applications. Here we describe a robust two-step protocol for self-assembling
single-domain crystals that contain millions of optical-scale
DNA-functionalized particles: Monodisperse crystals are initially assembled in
monodisperse droplets made by microfluidics, after which they are grown to
macroscopic dimensions via seeded diffusion-limited growth. We demonstrate the
generality of our approach by assembling different macroscopic single-domain
photonic crystals with metamaterial properties, like structural coloration,
that depend on the underlying crystal structure. By circumventing the
fundamental kinetic traps intrinsic to crystallization of optical-scale
DNA-coated colloids, we eliminate a key barrier to engineering photonic devices
from DNA-programmed materials.

Chiral magnets feature a rich phase diagram with a variety of thermodynamical
phases. These include helical and conical spin arrangements and topologically
charged objects such as (anti)skyrmions. Crucially, due to hysteresis effects,
the thermodynamical phases can co-exist at any given temperature and external
magnetic field, typically leading to metastability of, e.g., the material's
topological phase. In this work, we use Monte Carlo simulations to study these
effects. We compute the relative free energies of co-existing states, enabling
us to determine the ground state at all values of the external parameters. We
also introduce a method to estimate the activation energy, i.e. the height of
the energy barrier that separates the topological phase from the ground state.
This allows us to address the skyrmion lifetime, which is relevant for
technological applications. Finally, we prescribe predicting the system's
evolution through any path in the space of external parameters. This can serve
as a guideline to prepare the magnetic material in any desired phase or even
trigger a phase transition in an experimental setup.

<br>
<br>
Using Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering, we measure the paramagnon
dispersion and damping of undoped, antiferromagnetic \CCOC{} as well as doped,
superconducting \NaCCOC{}. Our estimation of the spin-exchange parameter and
width of the paramagnon peak at the zone boundary $X=(0.5,0)$ confirms that no
simple relation can be drawn between these parameters and the critical
temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$. Consistently with other cuprate compounds, we show
that upon doping there is a slight softening at $(0.25,0)$, but not at the zone
boundary $X$. In combination with these measurements we perform calculations of
the dynamical spin structure factor of the one-band Hubbard model using cluster
dynamical mean-field theory. The calculations are in excellent agreement with
the experiment in the undoped case, both in terms of energy position and width.
While the increase in width is also captured upon doping, the dynamical spin
structure factor shows a sizable softening at $X$, which provides insightful
information on the length-scale of the spin fluctuations in doped cuprates.

<br>
A single fermion shared between two states threaded by a magnetic flux is the
simplest possible quantum system in which interference is predicted to occur.
We demonstrate tuning of the tunnel coupling between two such fermionic levels
with flux, implemented in a phase-coherent loop comprising two quantum dots.
Using radio-frequency reflectometry of the dots' gate electrodes, we probe the
device tuned into an open loop without tunnel barriers. There, we observe
signal oscillations in magnetic field consistent with the Aharonov-Bohm effect.
Tuning the ring into a loop-shaped double quantum dot, we extract the inter-dot
tunnel coupling as a function of flux, which exhibits oscillations with the
same periodicity. In different tunnel coupling regimes we benchmark the
contrast of these oscillations, and find that their amplitude varies depending
on the levels involved, while tunneling is generically not suppressed at
oscillation minima. These results establish the feasibility and limitations of
conducting parity readout of hybrid qubits with tunnel couplings tuned by flux.
