We probe the response of ultracold, interacting Fermi gases of Lithium (Li)
atoms in the BEC-BCS crossover to strong perturbations in space and time via
rapidly switched optical disorder potentials with focus on the BEC side. We
measure the time evolution of long-range phase coherence quantified via the
ability of the gas to expand hydrodynamically. While in the presence of static
disorder, the effects on a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) type superfluid are
predicted to be much smaller compared to a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC), we find that the quantum properties of a resonantly interacting, unitary
Fermi gas are more strongly suppressed in the presence of quenched disorder
than in a molecular BEC. For quenches from a disordered potential, we find that
the unitary Fermi gas never recovers quantum hydrodynamics for all parameters
studied, while a molecular BEC always recovers quantum hydrodynamics, even when
the quench leads to strong particle losses of up to 70 %. Temperature
measurements indicate an additional heating channel specific to gases close to
resonant interactions, leading to strong local dephasing or pair breaking. Our
work illustrates the striking difference between the nonequilibrium phase
diagram of the time-dependent disordered BEC-BCS crossover compared to that of
the static-disorder case. Moreover, our results suggest an important role of
local dephasing of fermionic pairs by time-dependent local perturbations, which
could be a key contribution to the destruction of macroscopic quantum
properties for time-dependent perturbations.

<h3>Large Deviations in the Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process with Slow  Boundaries: A Hydrodynamic Approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11350" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11350</a>
<br>
<i>Soumyabrata Saha, Tridib Sadhu</i>
<br>
<br>
We revisit the one-dimensional model of the symmetric simple exclusion
process slowly coupled with two unequal reservoirs at the boundaries. In its
non-equilibrium stationary state, the large deviations functions of density and
current have been recently derived using exact microscopic analysis by Derrida
et al. in J. Stat. Phys. 182, 15 (2021). We present an independent derivation
using the hydrodynamic approach of the macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT).
The slow coupling introduces additional boundary terms in the MFT-action which
modifies the spatial boundary conditions for the associated variational
problem. For the density large deviations, we explicitly solve the
corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation using a simple local transformation of
the optimal fields. For the current large deviations, our solution is obtained
using the additivity principle. In addition to recovering the expression of the
large deviation functions, our solution describes the most probable path for
these rare fluctuations.

<h3>A new pairing mechanism via chiral electron-hole condensation in non-BCS  superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10674" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10674</a>

<i>Wanpeng Tan</i>
<br>
<br>
A novel chiral electron-hole (CEH) pairing mechanism is proposed to account
for non-BCS superconductivity. In contrast to BCS Cooper pairs, CEH pairs
exhibit a pronounced affinity to antiferromagnetism for superconductivity. The
gap equations derived from this new microscopic mechanism are analyzed for both
s- and d-wave superconductivity, revealing marked departures from the BCS
theory. Unsurprisingly, CEH naturally describes superconductivity in
strongly-correlated systems, necessitating an exceedingly large coupling
parameter ($\lambda>1$ for s-wave and $\lambda>\pi/2$ for d-wave) to be
efficacious. The new mechanism provides a better understanding of various
non-BCS features, especially in cuprate and iron-based superconductors. In
particular, CEH, through quantitative comparison with experimental data, shows
promise in solving long-standing puzzles such as the unexpectedly large
gap-to-critical-temperature ratio $\Delta_0/T_c$, the lack of gap closure at
$T_c$, superconducting phase diagrams, and a non-zero
heat-capacity-to-temperature ratio $C/T$ at $T=0$ (i.e., the ``anomalous linear
term''), along with its quadratic behavior near $T=0$ for d-wave cuprates.

<h3>$W$ state is not the unique ground state of any local Hamiltonian</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10716" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10716</a>

The characterization of ground states among all quantum states is an
important problem in quantum many-body physics. For example, the celebrated
entanglement area law for gapped Hamiltonians has allowed for efficient
simulation of 1d and some 2d quantum systems using matrix product states. Among
ground states, some types, such as cat states (like the GHZ state) or
topologically ordered states, can only appear alongside their degenerate
partners, as is understood from the theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking. In
this work, we introduce a new class of simple states, including the $W$ state,
that can only occur as a ground state alongside an exactly degenerate partner,
even in gapless or disordered models. We show that these states are never an
element of a stable gapped ground state manifold, which may provide a new
method to discard a wide range of 'unstable' entanglement area law states in
the numerical search of gapped phases. On the other hand when these degenerate
states are the ground states of gapless systems they possess an excitation
spectrum with $O(1/L^2)$ finite-size splitting. One familiar situation where
this special kind of gaplessness occurs is at a Lifshitz transition due to a
zero mode; a potential quantum state signature of such a critical point. We
explore pathological parent Hamiltonians, and discuss generalizations to higher
dimensions, other related states, and implications for understanding
thermodynamic limits of many-body quantum systems.

<h3>Realizing Topological Superconductivity in Tunable Bose-Fermi Mixtures  with Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10720" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10720</a>
<br>
<i>Caterina Zerba, Clemens Kuhlenkamp, Ataç Imamoğlu, Michael Knap</i>
<br>
<br>
Heterostructures of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)
are emerging as a promising platform for investigating exotic correlated states
of matter. Here, we propose to engineer Bose-Fermi mixtures in these systems by
coupling inter-layer excitons to doped charges in a trilayer structure. Their
interactions are determined by the inter-layer trion, whose spin-selective
nature allows excitons to mediate an attractive interaction between charge
carriers of only one spin species. Remarkably, we find that this causes the
system to become unstable to topological p+ip superconductivity at low
temperatures. We then demonstrate a general mechanism to develop and control
this unconventional state by tuning the trion binding energy using a
solid-state Feshbach resonance.

<h3>Superconductivity induced by strong electron-exciton coupling in doped  atomically thin semiconductor heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10726" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10726</a>
<br>
<i>Jonas von Milczewski, Xin Chen, Atac Imamoglu, Richard Schmidt</i>
<br>
<br>
We study a mechanism to induce superconductivity in atomically thin
semiconductors where excitons mediate an effective attraction between
electrons. Our model includes interaction effects beyond the paradigm of
phonon-mediated superconductivity and connects to the well-established limits
of Bose and Fermi polarons. By accounting for the strong-coupling physics of
trions, we find that the effective electron-exciton interaction develops a
strong frequency and momentum dependence accompanied by the system undergoing
an emerging BCS-BEC crossover from weakly bound $s$-wave Cooper pairs to a
superfluid of bipolarons. Even at strong-coupling the bipolarons remain
relatively light, resulting in critical temperatures of up to 10\% of the Fermi
temperature. This renders heterostructures of two-dimensional materials a
promising candidate to realize superconductivity at high critical temperatures
set by electron doping and trion binding energies.

The work examines ferromagnetic films with strong uniaxial anisotropy of the
"easy plane" type and substantiates that paired nano-scaled perforations in
such films can be used as memory cells for recording and storing data in the
ternary number system. The problem of reading the state of cells of this type
has been studied, and an approach to solving it has been proposed, which
consists in measuring the response of the system to a picosecond pulse of an
external magnetic field. The parameters of the system at which the magnitude of
this response is greatest were obtained, and estimates of this value were made
using both analytical and numerical methods.

<h3>Fractal Quasicondensation in One Dimension</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10757" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10757</a>
<br>
<i>Flavio Riche, Miguel Gonçalves, Bruno Amorim, Eduardo V. Castro, Pedro Ribeiro</i>
<br>
<br>
We unveil a novel mechanism for quasicondensation of hard-core bosons in the
presence of quasiperiodicity-induced multifractal single-particle states. The
new critical state, here dubbed fractal quasicondensate, is characterized by
natural orbitals with multifractal properties and by an occupancy of the lowest
natural orbital, {\lambda}0 ~ L{\gamma}, which grows with system size but with
a nonuniversal scaling exponent, {\gamma} < 1/2. In contrast to fractal
quasicondensates obtained when the chemical potential lies in a region of
multifractal single-particle states, placing the chemical potential in regions
of localized or delocalized states yields, respectively, no condensation or the
usual 1D quasicondensation with {\gamma} = 1/2. Our findings are established by
studying one-dimensional hardcore bosons subjected to various quasiperiodic
potentials, including the well-known Aubry-Andre model, employing a mapping to
non-interacting fermionics that allows for numerically exact results. We
discuss how to test our findings in state-of-the-art ultracold atom
experiments.

<h3>Quarter-Metal Phases in Multilayer Graphene: Ising-XY and Annular  Lifshitz Transitions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10759" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10759</a>
<br>
<i>Mainak Das, Chunli Huang</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent experiments have uncovered a distinctive magnetic metal in
lightly-doped multilayer graphene, coined the \textit{quarter metal}. This
quarter metal consolidates all the doped carriers, originally distributed
evenly across the four (or twelve) Fermi surfaces of the paramagnetic state,
into one expansive Fermi surface by breaking time-reversal and/or inversion
symmetry. In this work, we map out a comprehensive mean-field phase diagram of
the quarter-metal in rhombohedral trilayer graphene within the four dimensional
parameter space spanned by the density $n_e$, interlayer electric potential
$U$, external magnetic field parallel to the two-dimensional material plane
$B_{\parallel}$ and Kane-Mele spin-orbit coupling $\lambda$. We found an
annular Lifshitz phase transition and a Ising-XY phase transition and locate
these phase boundaries on the experimental phase diagram. The movement of the
Ising-XY phase boundary offers insights into $\lambda$. Our analysis reveals
that it moves along the line $\partial n_e/\partial B_{\parallel} \sim
-0.5\times 10^{11} \text{cm}^{-2}\text{T}^{-1}$ within the
$n_e$-$B_{\parallel}$ parameter space when $\lambda=30\mu$eV. Additionally, we
estimated the in-plane spin susceptibility of the valley-Ising quarter-metal
$\chi_{_\parallel}\sim 8~\mu\text{eV} ~\text{T}^{-2}$. Beyond these
quantitative findings, two general principles emerge from our study: 1) The
valley-XY quarter metal's dominance in the $n_e-U$ parameter space grows with
an increasing number of layers due to the reduce valley polarization variations
within the Fermi sea. 2) Layer polarization near the band edge plays an
important role in aiding the re-entrance of the paramagnetic state at low
density. The insights derived from the quarter metal physics may shed light on
the complex behaviors observed in other regions of the phase diagram.

<h3>Fragile topological dislocation modes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10779" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10779</a>
<br>
<i>Gabriel Malavé, Jorge Schifferli, Rodrigo Soto-Garrido, Pedro A. Orellana, Vladimir Juričić</i>
<br>
<br>
We here introduce the concept of fragile topological dislocation modes, which
are localized only in a fraction of a topological phase, while otherwise leak
into the bulk continuum. We show that such dislocation modes are hosted in an
obstructed atomic topological phase in the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
model, but only in a finite region with an indirect gap at high energy. These
dislocation modes are realized as chiral pairs at finite energies with
protection stemming from a combination of the chiral (unitary particle-hole)
and the point group (C$_{4v}$) symmetries, but only when the indirect gap is
open. In this regime, we corroborate the stability of the defect modes by
following their localization and also by explicitly adding a weak chemical
potential disorder. Our findings, therefore, should be consequential for the
experimental observation of such modes in designer topological crystals and
classical metamaterials.

<h3>Matrix-product-state-based band-Lanczos solver for quantum cluster  approaches</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10799" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10799</a>
<br>
<i>Sebastian Paeckel, Thomas Köhler, Salvatore R. Manmana, Benjamin Lenz</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a matrix-product state (MPS) based band-Lanczos method as solver
for quantum cluster methods such as the variational cluster approximation
(VCA). While a na\"ive implementation of MPS as cluster solver would barely
improve its range of applicability, we show that our approach makes it possible
to treat cluster geometries well beyond the reach of exact diagonalization
methods. The key modifications we introduce are a continuous energy truncation
combined with a convergence criterion that is more robust against approximation
errors introduced by the MPS representation and provides a bound to deviations
in the resulting Green's function. The potential of the resulting cluster
solver is demonstrated by computing the self-energy functional for the
single-band Hubbard model at half filling in the strongly correlated regime, on
different cluster geometries. Here, we find that only when treating large
cluster sizes, observables can be extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit,
which we demonstrate at the example of the staggered magnetization. Treating
clusters sizes with up to $6\times 6$ sites we obtain excellent agreement with
quantum Monte-Carlo results.

<h3>Spectroscopy of van der Waals nanomaterials: Opportunities and  Challenges</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10811" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10811</a>
<br>
<i>Sivakumar Vishnuvardhan Mambakkam, Stephanie Law</i>
<br>
<br>
The study of van der Waals (vdW) materials has seen increased interest in
recent years, due to the wide range of uses for these materials because of
their unique mechanical, electronic, and optical properties. This area has
recently expanded further into studying the behavior of vdW nanomaterials, as
decreasing dimensions open up opportunities to interact with these materials in
new ways. However, measuring the band structures of nanomaterials, which is key
to understanding how confinement affects material properties and interactions,
comes with several challenges. In this review, we survey a range of techniques
for synthesizing and characterizing vdW nanomaterials, in order to outline the
key material and characterization challenges. This includes controlling the
Fermi level in vdW nanoparticles, preparing these particles for either ensemble
or individual particle measurement, as well as protecting the pristine surface
from oxidation.

<h3>Elucidating the Role of Filament Turnover in Cortical Flow using  Simulations and Representation Learning</h3>

<br>
<br>
Cell polarization relies on long-range cortical flows, which are driven by
active stresses and resisted by the cytoskeletal network. While the general
mechanisms that contribute to cortical flows are known, a quantitative
understanding of the factors that tune flow speeds has remained lacking. Here,
we combine physical simulation, representation learning, and theory to
elucidate the role of actin turnover in cortical flows. We show how turnover
tunes the actin density and filament curvature and use representation learning
to demonstrate that these quantities are sufficient to predict cortical flow
speeds. We extend a recent theory for contractility to account for filament
curvature in addition to the nonuniform distribution of crosslinkers along
actin filaments due to turnover. We obtain formulas that can be used to fit
data from simulations and microscopy experiments. Our work provides insights
into the mechanisms of contractility that contribute to cortical flows and how
they can be controlled quantitatively.

<h3>Three-sublattice antiferro-type and ferri-type skyrmion crystals in  centrosymmetric magnets</h3>

<br>
<i>Satoru Hayami</i>
<br>
<br>
We numerically investigate the stability of the skyrmion crystals in a
centrosymmetric lattice structure by focusing on the role of magnetic
frustration arising from the multi-sublattice degree of freedom. By analyzing
an effective three-sublattice spin model with the antiferromagnetic exchange
interaction between different sublattices and the momentum-resolved exchange
interaction between the same sublattice based on the simulated annealing, we
find that various skyrmion crystal phases with sublattice-dependent skyrmion
numbers are stabilized with and without an external magnetic field depending on
the model parameters: two ferro-type skyrmion crystal phases with the skyrmion
numbers of one and two, two ferri-type skyrmion crystal phases, and one
antiferro-type skyrmion crystal phase. Our results indicate that the
multi-sublattice degree of freedom brings a further intriguing possibility of
inducing exotic skyrmion crystal phases.

<h3>Non-local features of the spin-orbit exciton in Kitaev materials</h3>

<br>
<i>Blair W. Lebert, Subin Kim, Beom Hyun Kim, Sae Hwan Chun, Diego Casa, Jaewon Choi, Stefano Agrestini, Kejin Zhou, Mirian Garcia-Fernandez, Young-June Kim</i>
<br>
<br>
A comparative resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of three
well-known Kitaev materials is presented: $\alpha$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$,
Na$_2$IrO$_3$, and $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Despite similar low-energy physics, these
materials show distinct electronic properties, such as the large difference in
the size of the charge gap. The RIXS spectra of the spin-orbit exciton for
these materials show remarkably similar three-peak features, including sharp
low energy peak (peak A) as well as transitions between $j_{\text{eff}}=1/2$
and $j_{\text{eff}}=3/2$ states. Comparison of experimental spectra with
cluster calculations reveals that the observed three-peak structure reflects
the significant role that non-local physics plays in the electronic structure
of these materials. In particular, the low-energy peak A arises from a
holon-doublon pair rather than a conventional particle-hole exciton as proposed
earlier. Our study suggests that while spin-orbit assisted Mott insulator is
still the best description for these materials, electron itinerancy cannot be
ignored when formulating low-energy Hamiltonian of these materials.

<h3>Basal force fluctuations and granular rheology: Linking macroscopic  descriptions of granular flows to bed forces with implications for monitoring  signals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10871" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10871</a>
<br>
<i>P.J. Zrelak, Eric C. P. Breard, Josef Dufek</i>
<br>
<br>
Granular flows are ubiquitous in nature with single flows traversing a wide
range of dynamic conditions from initiation to deposition. Basal forces exerted
by environmental granular flows are responsible for the generation of
observable seismic signals. To fully realize the benefit of seismic
measurements, basal granular forces must be linked to macroscopic internal flow
dynamics across a wide range of flow conditions. We utilize discrete element
simulations to observe dry and submerged granular flows under plane-shear and
inclined flow configurations, relating bulk kinematics and rheology to basal
forcing signals. We find that regardless of the flow geometry/initiation the
variance in basal forcing scales with a local non-dimensional shear-rate (or
inertial number I), and this scaling tracks four different flow regimes spanned
by our simulations: (1) an unsteady particle rearrangement regime when
$I<10^{-3}$, where basal forces are dominated by low frequencies; (2) an
intermediate regime when $10^{-3}< I<10^{-2}$, where granular temperature is
isotropic and basal forces start to become noise-like, (3) a transitional
regime at $10^{-2}<I<10^{-1}$, where the increase in basal tractions with
increasing shear-rates stalls as the granular bed dilates, partially destroying
the contact network and configurational memory, and (4) a fully collisional
regime when $I>10^{-1}$, where granular temperature is anisotropic in the
stream-wise direction, and the signal becomes white noise-like up to a cutoff
frequency that is dependent on particle size and shear-rate. This effort
suggests that basal forces, recorded in instrumented channels or inverted from
seismic signals, can be used to interpret complex granular processes in
geophysical flows.

<h3>Magnetic field driven Lifshitz transition and one-dimensional Weyl nodes  in three-dimensional pentatellurides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10906" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10906</a>
<br>
<i>Zhigang Cai, Yi-Xiang Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent experiments reported that the magnetic field can drive the Lifshitz
transition and one-dimensional (1D) Weyl nodes in the quantum limit of
three-dimensional pentatellurides, as they own low carrier densities and can
achieve the extreme quantum limit at a low magnetic field. In this paper, we
will investigate the conditions for the existence of the 1D Weyl nodes and
their dc transport properties. We find that in the strong topological insulator
(TI) phase of ZrTe5, the formation of the Weyl nodes depends heavily on the
carrier density; while in the weak TI phase of HfTe5, the Weyl nodes are more
likely to appear. These behaviors are attributed to the fact that in the strong
and weak TI phases, the zeroth Landau levels exhibit opposite evolutions with
the magnetic field. Moreover, the signatures of the critical fields that
characterize the distinct behaviors of the system can be directly captured in
the conductivities.

<h3>Layer-Selective Non-Reciprocal Electric-Field Switching of Magnetism in  van der Waals Heterostructure Multiferroics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10911" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10911</a>

<br>
<br>
Multiferroic materials provide robust and efficient routes for the control of
magnetism by electric fields, which has been diligently sought after for a long
time. The two-dimensional (2D) vdW multiferroics is a more exciting endeavour.
To date, the nonvolatile manipulation of magnetism through ferroelectric
polarization still remains challenging in a 2D vdW heterostructure
multiferroic. Here, we report a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure
multiferroic comprising atomically thin layered antiferromagnet (AFM) CrI3 and
ferroelectric (FE) {\alpha}-In2Se3. We demonstrate anomalously layer-selective
nonreciprocal and nonvolatile electric-field control of magnetization by the
ferroelectric polarization. The nonreciprocal electric control originates from
an intriguing antisymmetric enhancement of interlayer ferromagnetic coupling in
the opposite ferroelectric polarization configurations of {\alpha}-In2Se3,
which favor to selectively switch the spins in the second layer. Our work
provides numerous possibilities for creating diverse heterostructure
multiferroics at the limit of few atomic layers for multi-stage magnetic
memories and brain inspired in-memory computing.

<br>
<br>
We present time-domain THz spectroscopy of thin films of the heavy-fermion
superconductor CeCoIn$_5$. The complex optical conductivity is analyzed through
a Drude model and extended Drude model analysis. Below the $\approx$ 40 K Kondo
coherence temperature, a narrow Drude-like peak forms, as the result of the $f$
orbital - conduction electron hybridization and the formation of the
heavy-fermion state. Via an extended Drude model analysis, we measure the
frequency-dependent scattering rate ($1/ \tau $) and effective mass
($m^*/m_b$). This scattering rate shows a linear dependence on temperature,
which matches the dependence of the resistivity as expected. Nonetheless, the
width of the low-frequency Drude peak (characterized by a {\it renormalized}
quasiparticle scattering rate ($1 / \tau^* = m_b/ m^* \tau $) does show a $T^2$

We report the first observation of a superconducting transition in a 3D
printed, metallised-plastic device. A cylindrical cavity is 3D printed from a
photosensitive polymer resin and then a 20 $\mu$m layer of tin deposited. A
resonant TE microwave mode at 13.41 GHz is observed to reduce its losses by an
order of magnitude once it is cooled below 3.72 K; the superconducting
transition temperature of tin, with the mode's $Q$ factor increasing from
$2.7\times10^4$ to $4.0\times10^5$.

<br>
<br>
In many random search processes of interest in chemistry, biology or during
rescue operations, an entity must find a specific target site before the latter
becomes inactive, no longer available for reaction or lost. We present exact
results on a minimal model system, namely, a one-dimensional searcher
performing a discrete time random walk or L\'evy flight. In contrast with the
search of a permanent target, the capture probability and the conditional mean
first passage time can be optimized. The optimal L\'evy index takes a
non-trivial value, even in the infinite lifetime limit, and exhibits an abrupt
transition as the initial distance to the target is varied. Depending on the
target lifetime, this transition can be discontinuous or continuous, separated
by a tricritical point in the phase diagram. These results pave the way to the
study of search processes under time constraints.

<h3>A Non-Hermitian Moiré Valley Filter</h3>

A valley filter capable of generating a valley-polarized current is a crucial
element in valleytronics, yet its implementation remains challenging. Here, we
propose a valley filter made of a graphene bilayer which exhibits a 1D
moir\'{e} pattern in the overlapping region of the two layers controlled by
heterostrain. In the presence of a lattice modulation between layers, electrons
propagating in one layer can have valley-dependent dissipation due to valley
asymmetric interlayer coupling, thus giving rise to a valley-polarized current.
Such a process can be described by an effective non-Hermitian theory, in which
the valley filter is driven by a valley-resolved non-Hermitian skin effect.
Nearly 100\% valley-polarization can be achieved within a wide parameter range
and the functionality of the valley filter is electrically tunable. The
non-Hermitian topological scenario of the valley filter ensures high tolerance
against imperfections such as disorder and edge defects. Our work opens a new
route for efficient and robust valley filters while significantly relaxing the
stringent implementation requirements.

<br>
<br>
Sophisticated statistical mechanics approaches and human intuition have
demonstrated the possibility to self-assemble complex lattices or finite size
constructs, but have mostly only been successful in silico. The proposed
strategies quite often fail in experiment due to unpredicted traps associated
to kinetic slowing down (gelation, glass transition), as well as to competing
ordered structures. An additional challenge that theoretical predictions face
is the difficulty to encode the desired inter-particle interaction potential
with the currently available library of nano- and micron-sized particles. To
overcome these issues, we conjugate here SAT-assembly -- a patchy-particle
interaction design algorithm based on constrained optimization solvers -- with
coarse-grained simulations of DNA nanotechnology to experimentally realize
trap-free self-assembly pathways. As a proof of concept we investigate the
assembly of the pyrochlore (also known as tetrastack) lattice, a highly coveted
3D crystal lattice due to its promise in construction of optical metamaterials.
We confirm the successful assembly with two different patchy DNA origami
designs via SAXS as well as SEM visualization of the silica-coated lattice. Our
approach offers a versatile modeling pipeline that starts from patchy particles
designed in silico and ends with wireframe DNA origami that self-assemble into
the desired structure.

<br>
<br>
We report on the structural, electrical and magnetic measurements in as-grown
polycrystalline samples of Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O. This compound has been recently
reported to be a room temperature superconductor. Our as-grown specimen has
excellent XRD matching with the original submission of Lee et al. This sample
has 1.5% of Cu2S as an impurity phase. A resistive transition around 380 K,
possibly corresponding to structural transitions of Cu2S, is observed. No
evidence of superconducting to normal state transitions in I-V characteristics
at room temperature is obtained. Magnetization measurements show linear
diamagnetic behavior that cannot be associated to the superconducting state.
Hall measurements provide evidence of hole doping through Cu substitution. In
summary, we find no evidence for room temperature ambient pressure
superconductivity in Cu doped lead apatite Pb9Cu(PO4)6O.

<br>
<br>
Solute segregation at low angle grain boundaries (LAGB) in Mg alloys
significantly affects GB energy and mobility, therefore recrystallization
kinetics and corresponding texture modification. In a system featuring multiple
substitutional elements at high local concentration levels, solute-solute
interaction needs to be considered to interpret and predict co-segregation
behavior. In this work, atomic-scale experimental and modelling techniques were
applied to investigate the co-segregation behavior of Ca, Zn and Al solutes at
a LAGB in a Mg alloy. Three-dimensional atom probe tomography and corresponding
clustering analysis revealed a strong clustering tendency of Ca solutes at the
linear dislocation arrays. Atomistic simulations indicate that the
co-segregation of Ca-Ca pairs in vicinity of the dislocation core region is
more energetically favorable than other solute pairs, as well as the
segregation of individual solutes.

<br>
<i>Pipat Harata, Wipada Hongthong, Prathan Srivilai</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a novel approach for calculating the Coulomb Blockade Phase
Diagram (CBPD) in the experimentally accessible strong coupling regime of a
single-electron transistor (SET). Our method utilizes the Path Integral Monte
Carlo (PIMC) technique to accurately compute the Coulomb oscillation of the
Differential Capacitance (DC). Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the
gate voltage and temperature variations on the DC, thereby gaining insights
into the system's behaviour. As a result, we propose a method to calculate the
Coulomb Blockade Boundary Line (CBBL) and demonstrate its efficacy by setting
the visibility parameter to $10\%$. The resulting boundary line effectively
defines the transition between the Coulomb and non-Coulomb blockade regimes,
thereby enabling the construction of a comprehensive CBPD.

<h3>Towards atomistic understanding of Iron phosphate glass: a  first-principles based DFT modeling and study of its physical properties</h3>

<i>Shakti Singh, Manan Dholakia, Sharat Chandra</i>
<br>
<br>
Iron phosphate glasses (IPG) have been proposed as futuristic glass material
for nuclear waste immobilization, anode material for lithium batteries and also
as bioactive glass. In the last decade, there have been attempts to propose
atomistic models of IPG to explain their properties from atomistic viewpoint
and to predict their behavior in radioactive environment. In this paper, we
seek to produce small scale models of IPG that can be handled within the scheme
of Density Functional Theory (DFT) to study the electronic structure of this
material. The starting models generated using Monte Carlo (MC) method [S. Singh
and S. Chandra, Comp. Mat. Sci., 202, 110943, (2022)] were subsequently
annealed (at 1000 K) using ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). This removes
coordination defects present in the MC models. The equilibrated structure at
this temperature was then force-relaxed using conjugate-gradient (CG)
optimization. This hybrid approach (MC + AIMD + 0K DFT-CG optimization)
produced good atomistic models of IPG which can reproduce experimentally
observed electronic band-gap, vibrational density of states (VDOS), magnetic
moment of Fe, the elastic constants as well as optical and dielectric
properties. Computationally expensive melt-quench simulation can be avoided
using present approach allowing the use of DFT for accurate calculations of
properties of complex glass like IPG.

<br>
<br>
It is now well established that materials are stronger when their dimensions
are reduced to submicron scale. However, what happens at dimensions such as a
few tens of nanometers or lower remains largely unknown, with conflicting
reports on strength or plasticity mechanisms. Here, we combined first
principles molecular dynamics and classical force fields to investigate the
mechanical properties of 1-2 nm Si and SiC nanoparticles. These compression
simulations unambiguously reveal that the strength continues to increase down
to such sizes, and that in these systems the theoretical bulk strength can be
reached or even exceeded in some cases. Most of the nanoparticles yield by
amorphization at strains greater than 20%, with no evidence of beta-tin phase
for Si. Original and unexpected mechanisms are also identified, such as the
homogeneous formation of a dislocation loop embryo for the <111> compression of
SiC nanoparticles, and an elastic softening for the <001> compression of Si
nanoparticles.

Atom arrangement plays a critical role in determining material properties. It
is, therefore, essential for materials science and engineering to identify and
characterize distinct atom configurations. Currently, crystal structures can be
determined either by its static properties or by quantifying its structural
evolution. Here we show how to classify an atom into phase solely by its speed
dynamics. We model silicon crystals at different phase transition points and
use a single atom speed trajectory to demonstrate that
crystal-structure-independent Maxwell distribution of speed is generated by
crystal-structure-dependent atom dynamics. As the classification accuracy of
the method increases with trajectory length, we show that subtle difference in
local atomic structures can be identified using sufficiently long trajectories.
Thanks to symbolization of atom dynamics, the method is computationally
efficient and suitable for an analysis of large datasets on the fly.

<h3>Thermally induced localization of dopants in a magnetic spin ladder</h3>

<br>
<i>K. Knakkergaard Nielsen</i>
<br>
<br>
I unveil a novel variant of Anderson localization. This emergent phenomenon
pertains to the motion of a dopant in a thermal spin lattice, rendered
localized by thermal fluctuations. This is in stark contrast to the intrinsic
origin of localization for quenched disorder. The system of interest consists
of spin-$1/2$ particles organized in a two-leg ladder with nearest neighbor
Ising interactions $J$. The motion of a hole -- the dopant -- is initialized by
suddenly removing a spin from the thermal spin ensemble, which then moves along
the ladder via nearest neighbor hopping $t$. I find that the hole remains
\emph{localized} for all values of $J/t$ and for \emph{all} nonzero
temperatures. The origin is an effective disorder potential seen by the hole
and induced by thermal spin fluctuations. Its length scale is found to match
with the underlying spin-spin correlation length at low temperatures. For
ferromagnetic couplings ($J<0$), the associated localization length of the hole
increases with decreasing temperature and becomes proportional to the
correlation length at low temperatures, asymptotically delocalizing at low
temperatures. For antiferromagnetic couplings ($J>0$), there is a smooth
crossover between thermal localization at high temperatures to localization
driven by the antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures. At infinite
temperatures, the dynamics becomes independent of the sign of the spin
coupling, whereby the localization length is a universal function of $|J|/t$,
diverging as $(t/|J|)^{5/3}$ for $|J| \ll t$. Finally, I analyze a setup with
Rydberg-dressed atoms, which naturally realizes finite range Ising
interactions, accessible in current experimental setups. I show that the
discovered localization phenomenon can be probed on experimentally accessible
length- and timescales, providing a strong testing ground for my predictions.

<h3>Theory of pseudospin resonance for multiband superconductors</h3>

We formulate a generalized pseudospin formalism for multiband superconductors
in the presence of an external perturbing electromagnetic field. Our theory
naturally captures the effects of quantum band geometric quantities and is
valid even for flat-band superconductors. As an interesting consequence of our
theory, we show that there is an interband pairing fluctuations induced by the
external field and mediated by the quantum band geometry. Surprisingly, this
interband fluctuation is independent of the band gap, which can be understood
from the geometric nature of such novel fluctuations. We derive the generalized
equation of motion for the multiband pseudospin and the self-consistency
equation. We present a formal solution to the pseudospin equation of motion in
powers of the perturbing electromagnetic field. As a simple illustration of our
theory, we calculate the Leggett modes for the two band case.

<h3>Influence of the Graft Length on Nanocomposite Structure and Interfacial  Dynamics</h3>

Both the dispersion state of nanoparticles (NPs) within polymer
nanocomposites (PNCs) and the dynamical state of the polymer altered by the
presence of the NP/polymer interfaces have a strong impact on the macroscopic
properties of PNCs. In particular, mechanical properties are strongly affected
by percolation of hard phases, which may be NP networks, dynamically modified
polymer regions, or combinations of both. In this article, the impact on
dispersion and dynamics of surface modification of the NPs by short
monomethoxysilanes with eight carbons in the alkyl part (C8) is studied. As a
function of grafting density and particle content, polymer dynamics is followed
by broadband dielectric spectroscopy and analyzed by an interfacial layer
model, whereas the particle dispersion is investigated by small-angle X-ray
scattering and analyzed by reverse Monte Carlo simulations. NP dispersions are
found to be destabilized only at the highest grafting. The interfacial layer
formalism allows the clear identification of the volume fraction of interfacial
polymer, with its characteristic time. The strongest dynamical slow-down in the
polymer is found for unmodified NPs, while grafting weakens this effect
progressively. The combination of all three techniques enables a unique
measurement of the true thickness of the interfacial layer, which is ca. 5 nm.
Finally, the comparison between longer (C18) and shorter (C8) grafts provides
unprecedented insight into the efficacy and tunability of surface modification.
It is shown that C8-grafting allows for a more progressive tuning, which goes
beyond a pure mass effect.

<h3>Back-reaction and correlation effects on pre-thermalization in  Mott-Hubbard systems</h3>

<br>
<br>
For the Fermi-Hubbard model in the strongly interacting Mott insulator state,
we study the pre-thermalization dynamics after a quench. To this end, we employ
the method of the hierarchy of correlations and compare different levels of
accuracy. To leading order, the usual free quasi-particle dynamics (as encoded
in the two-point correlation functions) yields the standard picture of
pre-thermalization. Taking into account the back-reaction of these
quasi-particle fluctuations onto the mean-field background as the first
next-to-leading order effect, we observe a strong degradation of
pre-thermalization, especially in low dimensions. In contrast, the inclusion of
three-point correlations enhances pre-thermalization.

<h3>The 3-dimensional Fermi liquid description for the normal state of  cuprate superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11236" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11236</a>
<br>
<i>Setsuo Misawa</i>
<br>
<br>
The quasiparticles in the normal state of cuprate superconductors have been
shown to behave universally as a 3-dimensional Fermi liquid. Because of
interactions and the presence of the Fermi surfaces (or Fermi energies), the
quasiparticle energy contains, as a function of the momentum $\boldmath{p}$, a
term of the form $(p-p_0)^3 \ln ( | p-p_0 | / p_0 )$, where $p = | \boldmath{p}
|$ and $p_0$ is the Fermi momentum. The electronic specific heat coefficient
$\gamma(T)$, electrical resistivity, Hall coefficient and thermoelectric power
divided by temperature $T$, follow the logarithmic formula $a - b T^2 \ln (
T/T^*) $, $a$, $b$, and $T^*$ being constant. Singularities in the Landau
$f$-function produce the $T^2 \ln T$ dependence of the magnetic susceptibility
$\chi (T)$, and Knight shift, which gives rise to the phenomenon of the
susceptibility maximum. The logarithmic $T$-dependence of the transport
properties arises exclusively from the impurity scattering in 3-dimensional
(3D) systems, but does not from the electron-electron scattering in 2D systems.
The above logarithmic formula has been shown to explain universally the
experimental data for the normal state of all cuprate superconductors. The
decrease of $\gamma(T)$ or $\chi(T)$ with decreasing $T$ is not due to the
appearance of pseudogap or spin gap but due to its $T^2 \ln T$ variation.

In this study, a spin-1/2 anisotropic extended XY chain has been introduced
in which both time reversal and SU(2) symmetries are broken but $Z_2$ symmetry
is preserved. System exhibits the faithful coexistence of magnetic and
topological superconducting phases even in the presence of transverse magnetic
field. Location of those phases in the parameter space has been determined
precisely. Quantum phase transition is noted at zero magnetic field, as well as
magnetic long range order is found to withstand magnetic field of any strength.
Exact analytic results for spin-spin correlation functions have been obtained
in terms of Jordan Wigner fermionization. Existence of long range magnetic
order has been investigated numerically by finding correlation functions as
well as the Binder cumulant in the ground state. Dispersion relation, ground
state energy, and energy gap are obtained analytically. In order to find the
topologically nontrivial phase, sign of Pfaffian invariant and value of winding
number have been evaluated. Both magnetic and topological phases are robust
against the magnetic field and found to move coercively in the parameter space
with the variation of its strength. Long range orders along two orthogonal
directions and two different topological phases are found and their one-to-one
correspondence has been established. Finally casting the spinless fermions onto
Majorana fermions, properties of zero energy edge states are studied. Three
different kinds of Majorana pairings are noted. In the trivial phase,
next-nearest-neighbor Majorana pairing is found, whereas two different types of
nearest-neighbor Majorana pairings are identified in the topological
superconducting phase.

We develop a high-dimensional neural network potential (NNP) to describe the
structural and energetic properties of borophene deposited on silver. This NNP
has the accuracy of DFT calculations while achieving computational speedups of
several orders of magnitude, allowing the study of extensive structures that
may reveal intriguing moir\'e patterns or surface corrugations. We describe an
efficient approach to constructing the training data set using an iterative
technique known as the "adaptive learning approach". The developed NNP
potential is able to produce, with an excellent agreement, the structure,
energy and forces of DFT. Finally, the calculated stability of various
borophene polymorphs, including those not initially included in the training
dataset, shows better stabilization for $\nu\sim0.1$ hole density, and in
particular for the allotrope $\alpha$ ($\nu=\frac{1}{9}$). The stability of
borophene on the metal surface is shown to depend on its orientation, implying
structural corrugation patterns that can only be observed from long time
simulations on extended systems. The NNP also demonstrates its ability to
simulate vibrational densities of states and produce realistic structures, with
simulated STM images closely matching the experimental ones.

<h3>Effect of Counterion Size on Polyelectrolyte Conformations and  Thermodynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11250" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11250</a>
<br>
<i>Souradeep Ghosh, Arindam Kundagrami</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a theoretical model to study the effect of counterion size on the
effective charge, size, and thermodynamic behavior of a single, isolated, and
flexible polyelectrolyte (PE) chain. We analyze how altering counterion size
modifies the energy and entropy contributions to the system, including the
ion-pair free energy, excluded volume interactions, entropy of free and
condensed ions, and dipolar attraction among monomer-counterion pairs, which
result in competing effects challenging intuitive predictions. The PE self
energy is calculated using Edwards-Muthukumar Hamiltonian, considering a
Gaussian monomer distribution for the PE. The condensed ions are assumed
confined within a cylindrical volume around the PE backbone. The dipolar and
excluded volume interactions are described by the second and third virial
coefficients. Assumption of freely-rotating dipoles results in a first-order
coil-globule transition of the PE chain. A more realistic weaker dipolar
attraction, parameterized in our theory, shifts it to a second-order continuous
transition. We calculate the size scaling-exponent of the PE and find exponents
according to the relative dominance of the electrostatic, excluded volume, or
dipolar effects. We further identify the entropy- and energy-driven regimes of
the effective charge and conformation of the PE, highlighting the interplay of
free ion entropy and ion-pair energy with varying electrostatic strengths. The
crossover strength, dependent on the counterion size, indicates that
diminishing sizes favor counterion condensation at the expense of free ion
entropy. The predictions of the model are consistent with trends in
simulations, and generalize findings of the point-like counterion theories.

Spin-flips are one of the limiting factors for spin-based information
processing. We demonstrate a transport approach for determining the spin-flip
rates of a self-assembled InAs double quantum dot. In such devices, different
Land\'e factors lead to an inhomogeneous Zeeman splitting, so that the two spin
channels can never be at resonance simultaneously, leading to a spin blockade
at low temperatures. This blockade is analyzed in terms of spin flips for
different temperatures and magnetic fields. Our results are in good agreement
with a quantum master equation that combines the dot-lead couplings with an
ohmic spin-boson model for the dissipative spin dynamics.

<br>
<br>
In the last decade, chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) has been
attracting extensive interest. However, there still exists a large gap between
experiments and quantitative theoretical results, and the microscopic mechanism
of CISS, especially transverse CISS where electrons are injected perpendicular
to the helix axis of chiral molecules, remains elusive. Here, we address these
issues by performing a combined experimental and theoretical study on
conducting polyaniline helical nanofibers which are synthesized in the absence
of any chiral species. Large spin polarization is measured in both left- and
right-handed nanofibers for electrons injected perpendicular to their helix
axis, which is comparable to the value of parallel electron injection in other
chiral molecules, and it will be reversed by switching the handedness between
two enantiomers. We develop a theoretical model with extremely weak spin-orbit
coupling arising exclusively from electron propagation between neighboring
polyanilines and the numerical results are quantitatively consistent with the
experimental data. Our results demonstrate that the supramolecular handedness
is sufficient for spin-selective electron transmission in chiral molecules
assembled from achiral monomers and the mechanism of transverse CISS is
revealed.

<br>
<br>
Recently a quantum simulator for the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model on an anisotropic
triangular lattice has been realized, where both geometrical frustration and
doping can be continuously tuned. Here we provide a comprehensive comparison
between the magnetic correlations calculated by the two-particle
self-consistent (TPSC) theory and those measured in this quantum simulator, at
temperatures comparable to the spin exchange energy and Hubbard interactions
comparable to the bandwidth. We find overall excellent agreements between the
TPSC calculations and the measurements from the quantum simulator at all levels
of frustration and doping. This is quite remarkable considering that the
Hubbard model is already in the intermediate to strong coupling regime, for
which very few methods yield reliable results. Our work showcases the potential
of TPSC as a theoretical approach capable of providing reasonably accurate
descriptions of the Hubbard model even at fairly strong interactions and when
the frustration is present.

Recent experiments have implemented resetting by means of an external trap,
whereby a system relaxes to the minimum of the trap and is reset in a finite
time. In this work, we set up and analyze the thermodynamics of such a
protocol. We present a general framework, even valid for non-Poissonian
resetting, that captures the thermodynamic work required to maintain a
resetting process up to a given observation time, and exactly calculate the
moment generating function of this work. Our framework is valid for a wide
range of systems, the only assumption being of relaxation to equilibrium in the
resetting trap. Examples and extensions are considered, including the validity
of fluctuation theorems. In the case of Brownian motion, we investigate optimal
resetting schemes that minimize work and its fluctuations, the mean work for
arbitrary switching protocols and comparisons to earlier-studied resetting
schemes. Numerical simulations are performed to validate our findings.

The emergence of transient checkerboard and stripe patterns in a stack of
driven quasi-one-dimensional homogeneous dipolar condensates is studied. The
parametric driving of the $s$-wave scattering length leads to the excitation of
the lowest collective Bogoliubov mode. The character of the lowest mode depends
critically on the orientation of the dipoles, corresponding to out-of-phase and
in-phase density modulations in neighboring condensates, resulting in
checkerboard and stripe patterns. Further, we show that a dynamical transition
between the checkerboard and stripe patterns can be realized by quenching the
dipole orientation either linearly or abruptly once the initial pattern is
formed via periodic driving.

Altermagnet is an emerging antiferromagnetic material subclass that exhibits
spin-splitting in momentum space without net global magnetization and
spin-orbit-coupling effect. In this work, we develop a model of thermal charge
injection across an altermagnet/semiconductor (AM/S) Schottky contact. We
obtain analytical expressions describing the spin-dependent thermionic current
injection across the AM/S contact under any arbitrary interface orientation
angles. Interestingly, the spin-contrasting Fermi surface of an altermagnetic
electrode enables spin-polarized current to be injected into a nonmagnetic
semiconductor even though the system has net-zero magnetization. Our findings
thus reveal an altermagntic mechanism to achieve spin injection without
involving ferromagnetic ordering. The AM/S Schottky contact proposed here shall
provide a potential altermagnetic building block of spintronic devices that are
resilient against stray magnetic field perturbation and inherently compatible
with ultracompact integration.

Swirling spin textures, including topologically non-trivial states, such as
skyrmions, chiral domain walls, and magnetic vortices, have garnered
significant attention within the scientific community due to their appeal from
both fundamental and applied points of view. However, their creation,
controlled manipulation, and stability are typically constrained to certain
systems with specific crystallographic symmetries, bulk, or interface
interactions, and/or a precise stacking sequence of materials. Here, we make
use of the stray field of YBa2Cu3O7-{\delta} superconducting microstructures in
ferromagnet/superconductor hybrids to imprint magnetic radial vortices in
permalloy at temperatures below the superconducting transition temperature
(TC), a method easily extended to other ferromagnets with in-plane magnetic
anisotropy. We examine the size dependence and temperature stability of the
imprinted magnetic configurations. We show that above TC, magnetic domains
retain memory of the imprinted spin texture. Micromagnetic modelling coupled
with a SC field model reveals that the stabilization mechanism leading to this
memory effect is mediated by microstructural defects. Superconducting control
of swirling spin textures below and above the superconducting transition
temperature holds promising prospects for shaping spintronics based on magnetic
textures.

Spectroscopic photoemission microscopy is a well-established method to
investigate the electronic structure of surfaces. In modern photoemission
microscopes the electron optics allows imaging of the image plane, momentum
plane, or dispersive plane, depending on the lens setting. Furthermore,
apertures allow filtering of energy-, real-, and momentum space. Here, we
describe how a standard spectroscopic and low energy electron microscope can be
equipped with an additional slit at the entrance of the already present
hemispherical analyzer to enable an angle- and energy resolved photoemission
mode with micrometer spatial selectivity. We apply a photogrammetric
calibration to correct for image distortions of the projective system behind
the analyzer and present spectra recorded on Au(111) as a benchmark. Our
approach makes data acquisition in energy-momentum space more efficient, which
is a necessity for laser-based pump-probe photoemission microscopy with
femtosecond time resolution.

The ability to modulate the spin-orbit (SO) interaction is crucial for
engineering a wide range of spintronics-based quantum devices, extending from
state-of-the-art data storage to materials for quantum computing. The use of
proximity-induced effects for this purpose may become the mainstream approach,
whereas their experimental verification using angle-resolved photoelectron
spectroscopy (ARPES) has so far been elusive. Here, using the advantages of
soft-X-ray ARPES on its probing depth and intrinsic resolution in
three-dimensional momentum k, we identify a distinct modulation of the SO
interaction in a van der Waals semiconductor (MoSe2) proximitized to a high-Z
metal (Pb), and measure its variation through the k-space. The strong SO field
from Pb boosts the SO splitting by up to 30% at the H-point of the bulk
Brillouin zone, the spin-orbit hotspot of MoSe2. Tunability of the splitting
via the Pb thickness allows its tailoring to particular applications in
emerging quantum devices.

<h3>Heavy-light $N+1$ clusters of two-dimensional fermions</h3>

We study binding of $N$ identical heavy fermions by a light atom in two
dimensions assuming zero-range attractive heavy-light interactions. By using
the mean-field theory valid for large $N$ we show that the $N+1$ cluster is
bound when the mass ratio exceeds $1.074N^2$. The mean-field theory, being
scale invariant in two dimensions, predicts only the shapes of the clusters
leaving their sizes and energies undefined. By taking into account
beyond-mean-field effects we find closed-form expressions for these quantities.
We also discuss differences between the Thomas-Fermi and Hartree-Fock
approaches for treating the heavy fermions.

<br>
Anomalous Hall effect (AHE), one of the most important electronic transport
phenomena, generally appears in ferromagnetic materials but is rare in
materials without magnetic elements. Here, we present a study of
La$_3$MgBi$_5$, whose band structure carries multitype Dirac fermions. Although
magnetic elements are absent in La$_3$MgBi$_5$, clear signals of AHE can be
observed. In particular, the anomalous Hall conductivity is extremely large,
reaching 42,356 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ with an anomalous Hall angle of 8.8 %,
the largest one that has been observed in the current AHE systems. The AHE is
suggested to originate from the combination of skew scattering and Berry
curvature. Another unique property discovered in La$_3$MgBi$_5$ is the axial
diamagnetism. The diamagnetism is significantly enhanced and dominates the
magnetization in the axial directions, which is the result of restricted motion
of the Dirac fermion at Fermi level. Our findings not only establish
La$_3$MgBi$_5$ as a suitable platform to study AHE and quantum transport, but
also indicate the great potential of 315-type Bi-based materials for exploring
novel physical properties.

Silicon technology offers the enticing opportunity for monolithic integration
of quantum and classical electronic circuits. However, the power consumption
levels of classical electronics may compromise the local chip temperature and
hence the fidelity of qubit operations. Here, we utilize a quantum-dot-based
thermometer embedded in an industry-standard silicon field-effect transistor
(FET), to assess the local temperature increase produced by an active FET
placed in close proximity. We study the impact of both static and dynamic
operation regimes. When the FET is operated statically, we find a power budget
of 45 nW at 100 nm separation whereas at 216 $\mu$m the power budget raises to
150 $\mu$W. When operated dynamically, we observe negligible temperature
increase for the switch frequencies tested up to 10 MHz. Our work describes a
method to accurately map out the available power budget at a distance from a
solid-state quantum processor and indicate under which conditions
cryoelectronics circuits may allow the operation of hybrid quantum-classical
systems.

<h3>A method for crystallographic mapping of an alpha-beta titanium alloy  with nanometre resolution using scanning precession electron diffraction and  open-source software libraries</h3>

An approach for the crystallographic mapping of two-phase alloys on the
nanoscale using a combination of scanned precession electron diffraction and
open source python libraries is introduced in this paper. This method is
demonstrated using the example of a two-phase alpha / beta titanium alloy. The
data was recorded using a direct electron detector to collect the patterns, and
recently developed algorithms to then perform automated indexing and to analyse
the crystallography from the results. Very high-quality mapping is achieved at
a 3nm step size. The results show the expected Burgers orientation
relationships between the alpha laths and beta matrix, as well as the expected
misorientations between alpha laths. It is found that 180{\deg} ambiguities in
indexing occur due to acquisition having been performed too close to a high
symmetry zone axis of the beta with 2-fold projection symmetry (not present in
3D) in the Zero Order Laue Zone for some patterns and that this should be
avoided in data acquisition in the future. Nevertheless, this study
demonstrates a good workflow for the analysis of nanocrystalline two-phase or
multiphase materials, which will be of widespread use in analysing two-phase
titanium and other systems and how they evolve as a function of
thermomechanical treatments.

To produce sounds, we adjust the tension of our vocal cords to shape their
properties and control the pitch. This efficient mechanism offers inspiration
for designing reconfigurable materials and adaptable soft robots. However,
understanding how flexible structures respond to a significant static strain is
not straightforward. This complexity also limits the precision of medical
imaging when applied to tensioned organs like muscles, tendons, ligaments and
blood vessels among others. In this article, we experimentally and
theoretically explore the dynamics of a soft strip subject to a substantial
static extension, up to 180\%. Our observations reveal a few intriguing
effects, such as the resilience of certain vibrational modes to a static
deformation. These observations are supported by a model based on the
incremental displacement theory. This has promising practical implications for
characterizing soft materials but also for scenarios where external actions can
be used to tune properties.

Dipolar gases like erbium and dysprosium have a dense spectrum of resonant
loss features associated with their strong anisotropic interaction potential.
These resonances display various behaviours with density and temperature,
implying diverse microscopic properties. Here, we quantitatively investigate
the low-field ($B < 6\,\text{G}$) loss features in ultracold thermal samples of
$^{162}$Dy, revealing two- and three-body dominated loss processes. We
investigate their temperature dependence and detect a feature compatible with a
$d$-wave Fano-Feshbach resonance, which has not been observed before. We also
analyse the expansion of the dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate as a function of
the magnetic field and interpret the changes in size close to the resonances
with a variation in the scattering length.

<br>
<br>
In the quest for efficient and cost-effective photovoltaic absorber materials
beyond silicon, considerable attention has been directed toward exploring
alternatives. One such material, zincblende-derived Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), has shown
promise due to its ideal band-gap size and high absorption coefficient.
However, challenges such as structural defects and secondary phase formation
have hindered its development. In this study, we examine the potential of
another compound Cu2ZnSnO4 (CZTO) with a similar composition to CZTS as a
promising alternative. Employing ab initio density function theory (DFT)
calculations in combination with an evolutionary structure prediction
algorithm, we identify that the crystalline phase of the delafossite structure
is the most stable among the 900 (meta)stable CZTO. Its thermodynamic stability
at room temperature is also confirmed by the molecular dynamics study.
Excitingly, this new phase of CZTO displays a direct band gap where the
dipole-allowed transition occurs, making it a strong candidate for efficient
light absorption. Furthermore, the estimation of spectroscopic limited maximum
efficiency (SLME) directly demonstrates the high potential of delafossite-CZTO
as a photovoltaic absorber. Our numerical results suggest that delafossite-CZTO
holds another promise for future photovoltaic applications.

<h3>Remarks on effects of 't Hooft anomaly on eigenstate thermalization  hypothesis</h3>

The existence of $p$-form symmetry in $(d+1)$-dimensional quantum field is
known to always lead to the breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization
hypothesis (ETH) for certain $(d-p)$-dimensional operators other than symmetry
operators under some assumptions. The assumptions include the mixing of
symmetry sectors within a given energy shell, which is rather challenging to
verify because it requires information on the eigenstates in the middle of the
spectrum. We reconsider this assumption from the viewpoint of the 't Hooft
anomaly to avoid this difficulty. In the case of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries, we
can circumvent the difficulty by considering
$\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N$-symmetric theories with a mixed 't Hooft
anomaly, and perturbing the Hamiltonian while preserving one of the
$\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries of our interest. We also perform numerical analyses
for $(1+1)$-dimensional spin chains and the $(2+1)$-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$
lattice gauge theory.
