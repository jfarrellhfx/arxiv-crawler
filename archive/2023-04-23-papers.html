<h3>Design aspects of dual gate GaAs nanowire FET for room temperature  charge qubit operation: A study on diameter and gate engineering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10554" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10554</a>
<br>
<i>Nilayan Paul, Basudev Nag Chowdhury, Sanatan Chattopadhyay</i>

The current work explores a geometrically engineered dual gate GaAs nanowire
FET with state of the art miniaturized dimensions for high performance charge
qubit operation at room temperature. Relevant gate voltages in such device can
create two voltage tunable quantum dots (VTQDs) underneath the gates, as well
as can manipulate their eigenstate detuning and the inter-dot coupling to
generate superposition, whereas a small drain bias may cause its collapse
leading to qubit read out. Such qubit operations, i.e., Initialization,
Manipulation, and Measurement, are theoretically modeled in the present work by
developing a second quantization filed operator based Schrodinger-Poisson
self-consistent framework coupled to non-equilibrium Greens function formalism.
The study shows that the Bloch sphere coverage can be discretized along polar
and azimuthal directions by reducing the nanowire diameter and increasing the
inter-dot separation respectively, that can be utilized for selective
information encoding. The theoretically obtained stability diagrams suggest
that downscaled nanowire diameter and increased gate separation sharpen the
bonding and anti-bonding states with reduced anticrossing leading to a gradual
transformation of the hyperbolic current mapping into a pair of straight lines.
However, the dephasing time in the proposed GaAs VTQD-based qubit may be
significantly improved by scaling down both the nanowire diameter and gate
separation. Therefore, the present study suggests an optimization window for
geometrical engineering of a dual gate nanowire FET qubit to achieve superior
qubit performance. Most importantly, such device is compatible with the
mainstream CMOS technology and can be utilized for large scale implementation
by little modification of the state of the art fabrication processes.

<h3>Random geometry at an infinite-randomness fixed point</h3>

We study the low-energy physics of the critical (2+1)-dimensional random
transverse-field Ising model. The one-dimensional version of the model is a
paradigmatic example of a system governed by an infinite-randomness fixed
point, for which many results on the distributions of observables are known via
an asymptotically exact renormalization group (RG) approach. In two dimensions,
the same RG rules have been implemented numerically, and demonstrate a flow to
infinite randomness. However, analytical understanding of the structure of this
RG has remained elusive due to the development of geometrical structure in the
graph of interacting spins. To understand the character of the fixed point, we
consider the RG flow acting on a joint ensemble of graphs and couplings. We
propose that the RG effectively occurs in two stages: (1) randomization of the
interaction graph until it belongs to a certain ensemble of random
triangulations of the plane, and (2) a flow of the distributions of couplings
to infinite randomness while the graph ensemble remains invariant. This picture
is substantiated by a numerical RG in which one obtains a steady-state graph
degree distribution and subsequently infinite-randomness scaling distributions
of the couplings. Both of these aspects of the RG flow can be approximately
reproduced in simplified analytical models.

WO$_3$ is a binary 5d compound which has attracted remarkable attention due
to the vast array of structural transitions that it undergoes in its bulk form.
In the bulk, a wide range of electronic properties has been demonstrated,
including metal-insulator transitions and superconductivity upon doping. In
this context, the synthesis of WO$_3$ thin films holds considerable promise for
stabilizing targeted electronic phase diagrams and embedding them in
technological applications. However, to date, the electronic structure of
WO$_3$ thin films is experimentally unexplored, and only characterized by
numerical calculations. Underpinning such properties experimentally would be
important to understand not only the collective behavior of electrons in this
transition metal oxide, but also to explain and engineer both the observed
optical responses to carriers' concentration and its prized catalytic activity.
Here, by means of tensile strain, we stabilize WO$_3$ thin films into a stable
phase, which we call pseudo-tetragonal, and we unveil its electronic structure
by combining photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory
calculations. This study constitutes the experimental demonstration of the
electronic structure of WO$_3$ thin-films and allows us to pin down the first
experimental benchmarks of the fermiology of this system.

<h3>A mechanism for $π$ phase shifts in Little-Parks experiments:  application to 2H-TaS$_2$ intercalated with chiral molecules and to  4Hb-TaS$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10583" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10583</a>
<br>
<i>Mark H. Fischer, Patrick A. Lee, Jonathan Ruhman</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, unusual $\pi$ phase shifts in Little-Parks experiments performed on
two systems derived from the layered superconductor 2H-TaS$_2$ were reported.
These systems share the common feature that additional layers have been
inserted between the 1H-TaS$_2$ layers. In both cases, the $\pi$ phase shift
has been interpreted as evidence for the emergence of exotic superconductivity
in the 1H layers. Here, we propose an alternative explanation assuming that
superconductivity in the individual 1H layers is of conventional $s$-wave
nature derived from the parent 2H-TaS$_2$. We show that a negative Josephson
coupling between neighboring 1H layers can explain the observations.
Furthermore, we find that the negative coupling arises naturally due to the
well understood spin-momentum locking of Ising type in a single 1H layer
together with the inversion symmetry of the double layer. By paying attention
to the overall inversion symmetry in the material, we can also explain the
absence of a $\pi$ phase shift in the control sample when achiral molecules are
intercalated. In the exotic superconductivity scenario, it is challenging to
explain why the critical temperature is almost the same as in the parent
material and, in the 4Hb case, the superconductivity's robustness to disorder.
Both are non-issues in our picture, which further pinpoints the common origin
of the effect and exposes the common features that are special in these two
systems.

<h3>Imaging inter-valley coherent order in magic-angle twisted trilayer  graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10586" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10586</a>

<i>Hyunjin Kim, Youngjoon Choi, Étienne Lantagne-Hurtubise, Cyprian Lewandowski, Alex Thomson, Lingyuan Kong, Haoxin Zhou, Eli Baum, Yiran Zhang, Ludwig Holleis, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Andrea F. Young, Jason Alicea, Stevan Nadj-Perge</i>
<br>
<br>
Magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG) exhibits a range of strongly
correlated electronic phases that spontaneously break its underlying
symmetries. The microscopic nature of these phases and their residual
symmetries stands as a key outstanding puzzle whose resolution promises to shed
light on the origin of superconductivity in twisted materials. Here we
investigate correlated phases of MATTG using scanning tunneling microscopy and
identify striking signatures of interaction-driven spatial symmetry breaking.
In low-strain samples, over a filling range of about 2-3 electrons or holes per
moir\'e unit cell, we observe atomic-scale reconstruction of the graphene
lattice that accompanies a correlated gap in the tunneling spectrum. This
short-scale restructuring appears as a Kekul\'e supercell -- implying
spontaneous inter-valley coherence between electrons -- and persists in a wide
range of magnetic fields and temperatures that coincide with the development of
the gap. Large-scale maps covering several moir\'e unit cells further reveal a
slow evolution of the Kekul\'e pattern, indicating that atomic-scale
reconstruction coexists with translation symmetry breaking at the much longer
moir\'e scale. We employ auto-correlation and Fourier analyses to extract the
intrinsic periodicity of these phases and find that they are consistent with
the theoretically proposed incommensurate Kekul\'e spiral order. Moreover, we
find that the wavelength characterizing moir\'e-scale modulations monotonically
decreases with hole doping away from half-filling of the bands and depends only
weakly on the magnetic field. Our results provide essential insights into the
nature of MATTG correlated phases in the presence of strain and imply that
superconductivity emerges from an inter-valley coherent parent state.

<h3>Rate enhancement of gated drift-diffusion process by optimal resetting</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10605" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10605</a>
<br>
<i>Arup Biswas, Arnab Pal, Debasish Mondal, Somrita Ray</i>
<br>
<br>
`Gating' is a widely observed phenomenon in biochemistry that describes the
transition between the activated (or open) and deactivated (or closed) states
of an ion-channel, which makes transport through that channel highly selective.
In general, gating is a mechanism that imposes an additional restriction on a
transport, as the process ends only when the `gate' is open and continues
otherwise. When diffusion occurs in presence of a constant bias to a {\it
gated} target, i.e., to a target that switches between an open and a closed
state, the dynamics essentially slows down compared to {\it ungated}
drift-diffusion, resulting in an increase in the mean completion time. In this
work, we utilize stochastic resetting as an external protocol to counterbalance
the delay due to gating. We consider a particle that undergoes drift-diffusion
in the presence of a stochastically gated target and is moreover subjected to a
rate-limiting resetting dynamics. Calculating the minimal mean completion time
rendered by an optimal resetting for this exactly-solvable system, we construct
a phase diagram that owns three distinct phases: (i) where resetting can make
gated drift-diffusion faster even compared to the original ungated process,
(ii) where resetting still expedites gated drift-diffusion, but not beyond the
original ungated process, and (iii) where resetting fails to expedite gated
drift-diffusion. Gated drift-diffusion aptly models various stochastic
processes such as chemical reactions that exclusively take place for certain
activated state of the reactants. Our work predicts the conditions where
stochastic resetting can act as a useful strategy to enhance the rate of such
processes without compromising on their selectivity.

<h3>The two laws of engines in general, information and the meaning of  entropy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10609" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10609</a>

<br>
The association of information with entropy has been argued on plausibility
arguments involving the operation of imaginary engines and beings, and it is
not a universal theorem. In this paper, a theorem by Charles Bennett on
reversible computation is recognized as the much needed theorem. It is proposed
a real, non thermal engine, operated by humans. Its operation has stages
analogous to the stages in Bennett's reversible three-tape computer. The engine
makes possible to prove two results: (1) the engine operates on two laws,
similar to the laws of thermodynamics, which are conditions on the possibility
of resetting the engine; (2) entropy is the measure of erased information, and
is measured in physical units, which complies with Landauer's principle. A
prototype at work is shown in video.

<h3>Higher order topology in a band deformed Haldane model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10635" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10635</a>
<br>
<i>Srijata Lahiri, Saurabh Basu</i>
<br>
<br>
Haldane model is a celebrated tight binding toy model in a 2D honeycomb
lattice that exhibits quantized Hall conductance in the absence of an external
magnetic field. In our work, we deform the bands of the Haldane model smoothly
by varying one of its three nearest neighbour hopping amplitudes ($t_1$), while
keeping the other two ($t$) fixed. This breaks the $C_3$ symmetry of the
Hamiltonian, while the $M_x*T$ symmetry is preserved. The symmetry breaking
causes the Dirac cones to shift from the K and the K' points in the Brillouin
zone (BZ) to an intermediate M point. This is evident from the Berry curvature
plots which show a similar shift in the corresponding values as a function of
$\frac{t_1}{t}$. We observe two different topological phases, one being a
topological insulator (TI) phase and the other is a higher order topological
insulator (HOTI). The Chern number ($C$) remains perfectly quantized at a value
of $C=1$ for the TI phase and goes to zero in the HOTI phase. Furthermore the
evolution of the Wannier charge center (WCC) as the band is deformed shows a
jump in the TI phase indicating a non-trivial bulk. We also study the HOTI
phase and diagonalize the real space Hamiltonian on a rhombic supercell to show
the presence of in-gap zero energy corner modes. The polarization of the
system, namely $p_x$ and $p_y$, are evaluated, along the $x$ and the $y$
directions respectively. We see that both $p_x$ and $p_y$ are quantized in the
HOTI phase owing to the presence of the inversion symmetry of the system.

<h3>The magnon peak lineshape in the transverse dynamical structure factor  of a magnetically polarized $XXZ$ chain at low temperatures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10645" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10645</a>
<br>
<i>P. N. Bibikov</i>
<br>
<br>
The low-temperature integral representation for the transverse magnetic
susceptibility of a ferromagnetically polarized XXZ spin chain is derived
within the Plakida-Tserkovnikov approach. The obtained formula accounts for two
kinds of processes, magnon creations and transitions from magnons to coupled
magnon pairs. Comparison with the exact result for the Ising model shows that
the former one is reproduced with more accuracy. Following this observation, we
focus on the cases where both the contributions lie in non-intersecting
frequency intervals. Considering only the magnon-creation contribution, we
represent it in the form of the Dyson equation. Using the well known
correspondence between imaginary part of magnetic susceptibility and dynamical
structure factor, we present several different magnon-peak lineshapes.

<h3>Observation of self-oscillating supersonic flow across an acoustic  horizon in two dimensions</h3>

Understanding the dynamics and stability of transonic flows in quantum fluids
is an outstanding challenge, with applications ranging from nonlinear optics
and condensed matter to analogue gravity. One intriguing possibility is that a
system with a spatially bounded supersonic flow may evolve into a
self-oscillating state that periodically emits solitons, in a process
originating from the well-known Landau instability. Here, we report observation
of self-oscillating supersonic flows in a two-dimensional atomic superfluid. By
imposing a local particle sink with strong loss, we induce a convergent radial
flow forming an acoustic analogue of a black-hole horizon and an inner horizon
around the sink. The observed superflow appears to be modulated by
quasi-periodic bursts of superluminal signals. We measure their frequencies and
find surprising agreement with numerical simulations of soliton oscillation
frequencies within the black-hole horizon. The presented experiment
demonstrates a new method for creating supersonic flows in atomic superfluids,
which may find applications in quantum simulations of curved spacetime,
supersonic turbulence, and self-oscillating dynamics in dissipative many-body
systems.

<h3>Magnetic Structures and Spin-wave Excitations in Rare-Earth Iron Garnets  near the Compensation Temperature</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10695" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10695</a>
<br>
<i>Michiyasu Mori, Timothy Ziman</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce a simple model for the ferrimagnetic non-collinear ``magnetic
umbrella" states of rare-earth iron garnets (REIG), common when the rare-earth
moments have non-zero orbital angular momentum. The spin-wave excitations are
calculated within linear spin wave theory and temperature effects via
mean-field theory. This could be used to determine the magnetic polarization of
each mode and thereby the spin currents generated by thermal excitations
including the effects of mixed chirality. The spectra reproduce essential
features seen in more complete models, with hybridization between the rare
earth crystal field excitations and the propagating mode on the iron moments.
By the symmetry of the model, only one rare earth mode hybridizes, inducing a
gap at zero wave number and level repulsion at finite frequency. At the
compensation point, the hybridization gap closes and finally, as we approach
the N\'eel temperature, the hybridization gap appears to reopen. The chirality
of the lowest mode changes its sign around the frequency at which the level
repulsion occurs. This is important to estimate the spin current generation in
REIGs.

<h3>Confined states and topological phases in two-dimensional  quasicrystalline $π$-flux model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10699" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10699</a>
<br>
<i>Rasoul Ghadimi, Masahiro Hori, Takanori Sugimoto, Takami Tohyama</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by topological equivalence between an extended Haldane model and a
chiral-$\pi$-flux model on a square lattice, we apply $\pi$-flux models to
two-dimensional bipartite quasicrystals with rhombus tiles in order to
investigate topological properties in aperiodic systems. Topologically trivial
$\pi$-flux models in the Ammann-Beenker tiling lead to massively degenerate
confined states whose energies and fractions differ from the zero-flux model.
This is different from the $\pi$-flux models in the Penrose tiling, where
confined states only appear at the center of the bands as is the case of a
zero-flux model. Additionally, Dirac cones appear in a certain $\pi$-flux model
of the Ammann-Beenker approximant, which remains even if the size of the
approximant increases. Nontrivial topological states with nonzero Bott index
are found when staggered tile-dependent hoppings are introduced in the
$\pi$-flux models. This finding suggests a new direction in realizing
nontrivial topological states without a uniform magnetic field in aperiodic
systems.

<h3>Soft Magnons in Anisotropic Ferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10709" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10709</a>
<br>
<i>G.E.W. Bauer, P. Tang, M. Elyasi, Y.M. Blanter, B.J. van Wees</i>
<br>
<br>
We discuss spin-wave transport in anisotropic ferromagnets with an emphasis
on the zeroes of the band edges as a function of a magnetic field. An
associated divergence of the magnon spin should be observable by enhanced
magnon conductivities in non-local experiments, especially in two-dimensional
ferromagnets.

<h3>Revisiting Andreev processes in superconductor-graphene-superconductor  (SGS) Josephson junctions: Comparison with experimental results</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10741" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10741</a>
<br>
<i>Shahrukh Salim, Rahul Marathe, Sankalpa Ghosh</i>
<br>
<br>
In view of the recent progress in experiments on charge transport through
various Josephson junctions made out of graphene, we have made a careful
comparison between the theory and some of the available experimental results.
Within the framework of a transfer matrix approach, we have first analytically
derived the spectrum of Andreev bound states (ABS) in a superconductor
-graphene-superconductor (SGS) junction for a wide range of experimentally
relevant parameters. We have particularly considered the case of monolayer
graphene (MLG). The theoretical results can account for both the retro Andreev
reflection (RAR) and the specular Andreev reflection (SAR) in the relevant
parameter range. Using the ABS spectrum we have evaluated the current through
such junctions and the junction conductance from the analytically derived
expressions at different bias voltages for a range of other system parameters
directly taken from the experimental works. These theoretical results have then
been compared with experimental results. Evaluated current and the conductance
show scaling behaviour with change in the junction length and agree well with
the experimental results. In the relevant parameter regime where the SAR
process is dominant, the calculated values of the current and the conductivity
have been found much lower than the corresponding values observed when the RAR
process is dominant.

<h3>Emergence of Rashba-spin-valley state in two-dimensional strained  bismuth oxychalcogenides Bi$_{2}$O$_{2}$Se</h3>

<br>
<br>
The experimental evidence of the ultra-high electron mobility and strong
spin-orbit coupling in the two-dimensional (2D) layered bismuth-based
oxyselenide, Bi$_{2}$O$_{2}$Se, makes it a potential material for spintronic
devices. However, its spin-related properties have not been extensively studied
due to the centrosymmetric nature of its crystal structure. By using
first-principles density-functional theory calculation, this study reports the
emergence of Rashba-spin-valley states in Bi$_{2}$O$_{2}$Se monolayer (ML).
Breaking the crystal inversion symmetry of Bi$_{2}$O$_{2}$Se ML using an
external electric field enables the Rashba-spin-valley formation, causing the
appearance of the Rashba-type splitting around the $\Gamma$ valley and
spin-valley coupling at the $D$ valleys located near the middle of $\Gamma-M$
line. In addition to the typical Rashba-type spin textures around the $\Gamma$
valley, the study also observed in-plane unidirectional spin textures around
the $D$ valleys, which is a rare phenomenon in 2D materials. The observed
Rashba-spin-valley states are driven by the lowering point group symmetry of
the crystal from $D_{4h}$ to $C_{4v}$ enforced by the electric field, as
clarified through $\vec{k}\cdot\vec{p}$ model derived from symmetry analysis.
More importantly, tuning the Rashba and spin-valley states by using biaxial
strain offers a promising route to regulate the spin textures and spin
splitting preventing the electron from back-scattering in spin transport. These
findings highlight the potential of the Bi$_{2}$O$_{2}$Se ML for future
spintronics and valleytronics-based devices.

<br>
<br>
Ferromagnets generate an anomalous Hall effect even without the presence of a
magnetic field, something that conventional antiferromagnets cannot replicate
but noncollinear antiferromagnets can. The anomalous Hall effect governed by
the resistivity tensor plays a crucial role in determining the presence of time
reversal symmetry and the topology present in the system. In this work we
reveal the complex origin of the anomalous Hall effect arising in noncollinear
antiferromagnets by performing Hall measurements with fields applied in
selected directions in space with respect to the crystalline axes. Our coplanar
magnetic field geometry goes beyond the conventional perpendicular field
geometry used for ferromagnets and allows us to suppress any magnetic dipole
contribution. It allows us to map the in-plane anomalous Hall contribution and
we demonstrate a 120$^\circ$ symmetry which we find to be governed by the
octupole moment at high fields. At low fields we subsequently discover a
surprising topological Hall-like signature and, from a combination of
theoretical techniques, we show that the spins can be recast into dipole,
emergent octupole and noncoplanar effective magnetic moments. These co-existing
orders enable magnetization dynamics unachievable in either ferromagnetic or
conventional collinear antiferromagnetic materials.

<h3>Scattering Dynamics and Boundary States of a Non-Hermitian Dirac  Equation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10757" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10757</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We study a non-Hermitian variant of the (2+1)-dimensional Dirac wave
equation, which hosts a real energy spectrum with pairwise-orthogonal
eigenstates. In the spatially uniform case, the Hamiltonian's non-Hermitian
symmetries allow its eigenstates to be mapped to a pair of Hermitian Dirac
subsystems. When a wave is transmitted across an interface between two
spatially uniform domains with different model parameters, an anomalous form of
Klein tunneling can occur, whereby reflection is suppressed while the
transmitted flux is substantially higher or lower than the incident flux. The
interface can even function as a simultaneous laser and coherent perfect
absorber. Remarkably, the violation of flux conservation occurs entirely at the
interface, as no wave amplification or damping takes place in the bulk.
Moreover, at energies within the Dirac mass gaps, the interface can support
exponentially localized boundary states with real energies. These features of
the continuum model can also be reproduced in non-Hermitian lattice models.

<h3>Surface structure and multigap superconductivity of V3Si (111) revealed  by scanning tunneling microscopy</h3>

<br>
<br>
V3Si, a classical silicide superconductor with relatively high TC (~16 K), is
promising for constructing silicon-based superconducting devices and
hetero-structures. However, real space characterization on its surfaces and
superconducting properties are still limited. Here we report the first
low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) study on cleaned V3Si
(111) single crystal surface. We observed a r3 by r3 superstructure which
displays mirror symmetry between adjacent terraces, indicating the surface is
V-terminated and reconstructed. The tunneling spectrum shows full
superconducting gap with double pairs of coherence peaks, but has a relatively
small gap size with comparing to bulk TC. Impurity induced in-gap state is
absent on surface defects but present on introduced magnetic adatoms. Upon
applying magnetic field, a hexagonal vortex lattice is visualized.
Interestingly, the vortex size is found to be field dependent, and the
coherence length measured from single vortex at low field is significantly
larger than estimated value from bulk H_c2. These results reflect V3Si is a
multi-band, s- wave superconductor.

properties of lithium, sodium, and potassium silicate glasses containing 25
mole % of alkali oxide. The comparison of two types of surfaces, a melt-formed
surface (MS) and a fracture surface (FS), demonstrates that the influence of
the alkali modifier on the surface properties depends strongly on the nature of
the surface. The FS exhibits a monotonic increase of modifier concentration
with increasing alkali size while the MS shows a saturation of alkali
concentration when going from Na to K glasses, indicating the presence of two
competing mechanism that influence the properties of a MS. For the FS, we find
that larger alkali ions reduce the concentration of under-coordinated Si atoms
and increase the fraction of two-membered rings, implying an enhanced chemical
reactivity of the surface. For both types of surfaces, the roughness is found
to increase with alkali size, with the effect being more pronounced for the FS
than for the MS. The height-height correlation functions of the surfaces show a
scaling behavior that is independent of the alkali species considered: The ones
for the MS are compatible with the prediction of the frozen capillary wave
theory while the ones for the FS show a logarithmic growth, i.e., on the
nanoscale these surfaces are not self-affine fractals. The influence of the
modifier on the surface properties are rationalized in terms of the interplay
between multiple factors involving the size of the ions, bond strength, and
charge balance on the surface.

The calculation of the GW self-energy may be a computational challenge due to
the double convolution integrals over frequency and transferred momentum. In
this work, we combine the recently developed multipole approximation (MPA) with
the W-av method. MPA accurately approximates full-frequency response functions
using a small number of poles, while W-av improves the convergence with respect
to the Brillouin zone (BZ) sampling in 2D materials. The combination of these
techniques is applied to obtain an accurate G0W0 QP band structure of graphene.
The screened interaction of graphene shows a complex low-energy frequency
dependence, that is poorly described with plasmon pole approximations (PPA),
and a sharp q dependence of the dynamical dielectric function over momentum
transfer, making standard BZ integration techniques inefficient. Within the
present development, we compare the calculated QP band structure of graphene
finding an excellent agreement with angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) measurements.

Equilibration dynamics of hot oxygen atoms following O2 dissociation on
Pd(100) and Pd(111) surfaces are investigated by molecular dynamics simulations
based on a scalable neural network potential enabling first-principles
description of O2 and O interacting with variable Pd supercells. We find that
to accurately describe the equilibration dynamics after dissociation, the
simulation cell length necessarily exceeds twice the maximum distance of
equilibrated oxygen adsorbates. By analyzing hundreds of trajectories with
appropriate initial sampling, the measured distance distribution of
equilibrated atom pairs on Pd(111) is well reproduced. However, our results on
Pd(100) suggest that the ballistic motion of hot atoms predicted previously is
a rare event under ideal conditions, while initial molecular orientation and
surface thermal fluctuation could significantly affect the overall
post-dissociation dynamics. On both surfaces, dissociated oxygen atoms remain
primarily locate their nascent positions and then randomly cross bridge sites
nearby.

Generic neural network potentials without forcing users to train potentials
could result in significantly acceleration of total energy calculations.
Takamoto et al. [Nat. Commun. (2022), 13, 2991] developed such a deep neural
network potential (NNP) and made it available in their Matlantis package. We
compared the Matlantis bulk formation, surface, and surface O vacancy formation
energies of metal hydrides, carbides, nitrides, oxides, and sulfides with our
previously calculated VASP values obtained from first-principles with the
PBEsol(+U) functional. Matlantis bulk formation energies were consistently ~0.1
eV/atom larger and the surface energies were typically ~10 meV/{\AA}^2 smaller
than the VASP counterpart. Surface O vacancy formation energies were generally
underestimated within ~0.8 eV. These results suggest that Matlantis energies
could serve as a relatively good descriptor of the VASP bulk formation and
surface energies.

We achieve a comprehensive understanding of the magnetic excitations observed
by electric spin resonance and far-infrared spectroscopy in a frustrated spin
gap system ${\rm SrCu_2(BO_3)_2}$ by considering the effects of magnetoelectric
couplings and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in the Shastry-Sutherland
model. The transitions from the dimer singlet ground state to the triplon and
the bound states of two triplons are electroactive through the magnetoelectric
couplings, even in the Shastry-Sutherland Heisenberg model. The results
indicate that an electro-triplon and a novel electroactive magnetic excitation,
as with an electromagnon in the multiferroics, can be realized in the
conventional spin-gapped singlet and anomalous spin-liquid states. Clarifying
these electroactive magnetic excitations in various spin systems will help
analyze a broad range of quantum magnets, {\it e.g.}, quantum spin liquids and
spin nematics.

Properly tuning the Fermi level position in topological insulators is of
vital importance to tailor their spin-polarized electronic transport and to
improve the efficiency of any functional device based on them. Here we report
the full in situ Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) and study of a
highly crystalline Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 topological insulator heterostructure on top
of large area (4'') Si(111) substrates. The bottom Sb2Te3 layer serves as an
ideal seed layer for the growth of highly crystalline Bi2Te3 on top, also
inducing a remarkable shift of the Fermi level to place it very close to the
Dirac point, as visualized by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. In
order to exploit such ideal topologically-protected surface states, we
fabricate the simple spin-charge converter Si(111)/Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3/Au/Co/Au and
spin-charge conversion (SCC) is probed by spin pumping ferromagnetic resonance.
A large SCC is measured at room temperature, which is interpreted within the
inverse Edelstein effect (IEE), thus resulting in a conversion efficiency
lambda_IEE of 0.44 nm. Our results demonstrate the successful tuning of the
surface Fermi level of Bi2Te3 when grown on top of Sb2Te3 with a full in situ
MOCVD process, which is highly interesting in view of its future technology

<br>
<br>
Using many-body perturbation theory and density functional perturbation
theory, we study the vibrational spectra of the internal stretch (IS) mode of
CO on Pd(111) for the bridge and hollow adsorption structures that are
experimentally identified at 0.5~ML coverage. Our theoretical treatment allows
us to determine the temperature dependence of the IS vibrational spectra under
thermal conditions as well as the time evolution of the non-equilibrium
transient spectra induced by femtosecond laser pulses. Under thermal conditions
(i.e., for equal electronic $T_e$ and phononic $T_l$ temperatures), the
calculated lifetimes at 10-150~K are mostly due to nonadiabatic couplings (NC),
i.e., first-order electronic excitations. As temperature increases, also the
contribution of the second-order electron mediated phonon-phonon couplings
(EMPPC) progressively increases from 25\% at low temperatures to 50\% at 300~K.
Our calculations for the laser-induced non-equilibrium conditions comprise
experimental absorbed fluences of 6-130~J/m$^2$. For fluences for which
$T_e>$2000~K, the transient vibrational spectra are characterized by two
different regimes that follow the distinct time-evolution of $T_e$ and $T_l$
and are respectively dominated by NC and EMPPC processes. At lower fluences,
the initial fast regime becomes progressively negligible as $T_e$ decreases and
only the steady second regime remains visible. Qualitatively, all these
spectral properties are common to the both adsorption structures studied here.

Determining Hamiltonian parameters from noisy experimental measurements is a
key task for the control of experimental quantum systems. An experimental
platform that recently emerged, and where knowledge of Hamiltonian parameters
is crucial to fine-tune the system, is that of quantum dot-based Kitaev chains.
In this work, we demonstrate an adversarial machine learning algorithm to
determine the parameters of a quantum dot-based Kitaev chain. We train a
convolutional conditional generative adversarial neural network (Conv-cGAN)
with simulated differential conductance data and use the model to predict the
parameters at which Majorana bound states are predicted to appear. In
particular, the Conv-cGAN model facilitates a rapid, numerically efficient
exploration of the phase diagram describing the transition between elastic
co-tunneling and crossed Andreev reflection regimes. We verify the theoretical
predictions of the model by applying it to experimentally measured conductance
obtained from a minimal Kitaev chain consisting of two spin-polarized quantum
dots coupled by a superconductor-semiconductor hybrid. Our model accurately
predicts, with an average success probability of $97$\%, whether the
measurement was taken in the elastic co-tunneling or crossed Andreev
reflection-dominated regime. Our work constitutes a stepping stone towards
fast, reliable parameter prediction for tuning quantum-dot systems into
distinct Hamiltonian regimes. Ultimately, our results yield a strategy to
support Kitaev chain tuning that is scalable to longer chains.

We present an ab initio calculation to understand electronic structures and
optical properties of a tungsten carbide WC being a major component of a
TiCN-based cermet. We found that the WC has a fairly low-energy plasma
excitation $\sim$0.6 eV (2 $\mu$m) and therefore can be a good constituent of a
solar selective absorber. The evaluated figure of merit for photothermal
conversion is prominently high compared to those of the other materials
included in the TiCN-based cermet. The imaginary part of the dielectric
function is considerably small around the zero point of the real part of the
dielectric function, corresponding to the plasma excitation energy. Therefore,
a clear plasma edge appeared, ensuring the high performance of the WC as the
solar absorber.

Proposed by the author Q-ball mechanism of the pseudogap state and high-Tc
superconductivity in cuprates was recently supported by micro X-ray diffraction
data in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$. This provides a remarkable opportunity to
investigate X-ray diffraction produced by the quantum thermodynamic time
crystals, a direct embodiment of those are just the Euclidean Q-balls
considered in the aforementioned theory. For this purpose the X-ray 'photon'
Green's function scattered by the Q-balls in the pseudogap phase of high-Tc
superconductors is calculated using the same , but adjusted, Feynman
diagrammatic technique that was previously used for random impurity scattering
in metal alloys. The Bragg's peaks intensity, provided by the imaginary part of
the retarded 'photon' Green's function, is calculated. Thus obtained results
describe X-ray scattering on the finite size Q-ball of CDW/SDW density, that
oscillates with bosonic frequency $\Omega=2\pi nT$ in Matsubara time, i.e. the
quantum thermodynamic time crystal. It is found, that theoretical results are
in good correspondence with X-ray diffraction data in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$
reported recently.

We study the interface representation of the contact process (CP) at its
directed-percolation critical point, where the scaling properties of the
interface can be related to those of the original particle model.
Interestingly, such a behavior happens to be intrinsically anomalous and more
complex than that described by the standard Family-Vicsek dynamic scaling
Ansatz of surface kinetic roughening. We expand on a previous numerical study
by Dickman and Mu\~noz [Phys. Rev. E 62, 7632 (2000)] to fully characterize the
kinetic roughening universality class for interface dimensions $d=1, 2$, and 3.
Beyond obtaining scaling exponent values, we characterize the interface
fluctuations via their probability density function (PDF) and covariance, seen
to display universal properties which are qualitatively similar to those
recently assessed for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) and other important
universality classes of kinetic roughening. Quantitatively, while for $d=1$ the
interface covariance seems to be well described by the KPZ, Airy$_1$
covariance, no such agreement occurs in terms of the fluctuation PDF nor the
scaling exponents.

The interplay between spin-orbit coupling, frustration-induced anisotropic
magnetic interaction, and spin correlations can lead to novel states with
exotic excitations in rare-earth-based quantum magnets. Herein, we present the
crystal structure, magnetization, electron spin resonance (ESR), specific heat,
and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on the polycrystalline samples
of Ba9Yb2Si6O24 in which Yb3+ ions form a perfect honeycomb lattice without
detectable anti-site disorder. Magnetization data reveal antiferromagnetically
coupled spin-orbit entangled Jeff = 1/2 degrees of freedom of Yb3+ ions in the
Kramers doublet state where the Curie-Weiss temperature is - 2.97 K, as
obtained from the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility data. The ESR
measurements reveal that the first excited Kramers doublet is 32.3(7) meV above
the ground state. The specific heat results suggest the presence of an
antiferromagnetic phase transition at 2.26 K. The long-range antiferromagnetic
order is completely suppressed upon the application of magnetic field and a
field-induced disordered state is observed in an applied magnetic field of 2.5
T, which is also confirmed by NMR measurements. Furthermore, the NMR
spin-lattice relaxation rate reveals the presence of a field-induced gap that
is attributed to the Zeeman splitting of Kramers doublet state in this quantum
material. Our experiments suggest the presence of a phase transition and
short-range spin correlations appearing well above the antiferromagnetic phase
transition temperature and a field-induced disordered state in this spin-orbit
entangled Jeff =1/2 rare-earth magnet on a honeycomb lattice.

Classical spin liquids have been a very active subject of research in the
last few years. A very rich variety of cases have been shown to exist,
including short-range and algebraic spin liquids displaying dipolar
correlations at zero temperature. In this article, we investigate different
families of classical spins liquids by combining analytical techniques and
Monte Carlo simulations. Our study relies on the Luttinger-Tisza Approximation
(LTA), which is associated with the constraint vector function in momentum
space, whose general properties allow for a classification of different spin
liquids. We show that the general properties of the LTA provide a framework for
identifying and accurately characterizing the different types of spin liquids
in different geometries. We apply our approach to three different families of
spin liquids defined on the checkerboard and kagome lattices, which exhibit a
remarkable range of situations, including various cases of algebraic and
short-range spin liquids. Additionally, we analyze the effective Gauss law
emerging from different kinds of spin liquids and identify states that exhibit
additional degeneracy lines.
The presence of spin liquid phases and pinch point singularities are
confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations validating our approach. Our study opens
up new avenues of research in the study of spin liquids, exploring algebraic
spin liquids as critical points dividing short-range spin liquids, and
algebraic spin liquids with higher-rank gauge fields, which may be viewed as
critical points separating regions of algebraic spin liquids with a different
number of pinch points.

We report the formation of a pinned vortex liquid spanning a very large
region of the magnetic field-temperature parameter space in a 5 nm thick
amorphous superconducting Re_xZr (x~6) (a-ReZr) thin film, using a combination
of low-temperature scanning tunnelling spectroscopic (STS) imaging and
magnetotransport measurements. The nature of the vortex liquid differs
significantly from a regular liquid. Analysing series of STS images captured as
a function of time, we observe that the interplay of pinning and intervortex
interactions produces a very inhomogeneous state, where some vortices remain
static, whereas others move forming a percolating network along which vortices
are mobile. With increase in temperature or magnetic field this network becomes
denser eventually encompassing all vortices. Our results provide key insight on
the nature of a pinned vortex liquid and some of the peculiarities in the
transport properties of ultrathin superconducting films.

<i>Angelo Russomanno</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work we consider two many-body generalizations of the logistic map,
where we couple single maps with nearest-neighbour interactions on a
one-dimensional lattice, getting a discrete-time nonlinear dynamical system.
Numerically looking at some period $2^k$-tupling order parameters, we check
that at least for $k\in\{1,\,2,\,3,\,4\}$ the period-doubling transitions of
the single map persist. The values of the driving parameter $\mu$ where they
occur remain unchanged, independently of the system size, and of the type and
the strength of the coupling in the many-body system. We numerically observe
that the nonlinear dynamics leads to the formation of patterns, that can occur
if $\mu$ lies beyond the first period-doubling threshold $\mu_2=3$ and appear
if the system is large enough to accommodate them. We study the properties of
the patterns -- the characteristic length scale and the amplitude -- and find
that the former changes over many orders of magnitude when $\mu$ is varied. If
the system size is large enough, the properties of the pattern have no relation
at all with the single logistic map, witnessing the qualitative difference of
the many-body dynamics from the single-map one. We discuss also the effect of
noise and the relation of our findings with time crystals.

Understanding frictional phenomena is a fascinating fundamental problem with
huge potential impact on energy saving. Such an understanding requires
monitoring what happens at the sliding buried interface, which is almost
inaccessible by experiments. Simulations represent powerful tools in this
context, yet a methodological step forward is needed to fully capture the
multiscale nature of the frictional phenomena. Here, we present a multiscale
approach based on linked ab initio and Green's function molecular dynamics,
which is above the state-of-the-art techniques used in computational tribology
as it allows for a realistic description of both the interfacial chemistry and
energy dissipation due to bulk phonons in non-equilibrium conditions. By
considering a technologically relevant system composed of two diamond surfaces
with different degrees of passivation, we show that the presented method can be
used not only for monitoring in real-time tribolochemical phenomena such as the
tribologically-induced surface graphitization and passivation effects but also
for estimating realistic friction coefficients. This opens the way to in silico
experiments of tribology to test materials to reduce friction prior to that in

<br>

Entanglement properties of driven quantum systems can potentially differ from
the equilibrium situation due to long range coherences. We confirm this
observation by studying a suitable toy model for mesoscopic transport: the open
quantum symmetric simple exclusion process (QSSEP). We prove that the average
mutual information of the open QSSEP in the steady state satisfies a volume
law, and derive exact formulae for the mutual information between different
regions of the system. Exploiting the free probability structure of QSSEP, we
obtain these results by developing a new method to determine the eigenvalue
spectrum of sub-blocks of random matrices from their so-called local free
cumulants -- a mathematical result on its own with potential applications in
the theory of random matrices. As an illustration of this method, we show how
to compute expectation values of observables in systems satisfying the
Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) from the local free cumulants.

The paper explores the optical properties of an exfoliated MoSe$_2$ monolayer
implanted with Cr$^+$ ions, accelerated to 25 eV. Photoluminescence of the
implanted MoSe$_2$ reveals an emission line from Cr-related defects that is
present only under weak electron doping. Unlike band-to-band transition, the
Cr-introduced emission is characterised by non-zero activation energy, long
lifetimes, and weak response to the magnetic field. To rationalise the
experimental results and get insights into the atomic structure of the defects,
we modelled the Cr-ion irradiation process using ab-initio molecular dynamics
simulations followed by the electronic structure calculations of the system
with defects. The experimental and theoretical results suggest that the
recombination of electrons on the acceptors, which could be introduced by the
Cr implantation-induced defects, with the valence band holes is the most likely
origin of the low energy emission. Our results demonstrate the potential of
low-energy ion implantation as a tool to tailor the properties of 2D materials
by doping.

Perovskite oxynitrides are, due to their reduced band gap compared to oxides,
promising materials for photocatalytic applications. They are most commonly
synthesized from {110} layered Carpy-Galy (A$_2$B$_2$O$_7$}) perovskites via
thermal ammonolysis, i.e. the exposure to a flow of ammonia at elevated
temperature. The conversion of the layered oxide to the non-layered oxynitride
must involve a complex combination of nitrogen incorporation, oxygen removal
and ultimately structural transition by elimination of the interlayer shear
plane. Despite the process being commonly used, little is known about the
microscopic mechanisms and hence factors that could ease the conversion. Here
we aim to derive such insights via density functional theory calculations of
the defect chemistry of the oxide and the oxynitride as well as the oxide's
surface chemistry. Our results point to the crucial role of surface oxygen
vacancies in forming clusters of NH$_3$ decomposition products and in
incorporating N, most favorably substitutionally at the anion site. N then
spontaneously diffuses away from the surface, more easily parallel to the
surface and in interlayer regions, while diffusion perpendicular to the
interlayer plane is somewhat slower. Once incorporation and diffusion lead to a
local N concentration of about 70% of the stoichiometric oxynitride
composition, the nitridated oxide spontaneously transforms to a
nitrogen-deficient oxynitride.

The Curie-Weiss law is widely used to estimate the strength of frustration in
frustrated magnets. However, the Curie-Weiss law was originally derived as an
estimate of magnetic correlations close to a mean-field phase transition, which
-- by definition -- is absent in spin liquids. Instead, the susceptibility of
spin liquids is known to undergo a Curie-law crossover between two magnetically
disordered regimes. Here, we study the generic aspect of the Curie-law
crossover by comparing a variety of frustrated spin models in two and three
dimensions, using both classical Monte Carlo simulations and analytical Husimi
tree calculations. Husimi tree calculations fit remarkably well the simulations
for all temperatures and almost all lattices. We also propose a Husimi Ansatz
for the reduced susceptibility $\chi T$, to be used in complement to the
traditional Curie-Weiss fit in order to estimate the Curie-Weiss temperature
$\theta_{\rm cw}$. Applications to materials are discussed.

In this paper, we propose a generalized variant of Kr\"oner's self-consistent
scheme for evaluation of the effective standard and gradient elastic moduli of
polycrystalline materials within Mindlin-Toupin second-gradient elasticity
theory. Assuming random orientation of crystallites (grains) we use an extended
Eshelby's equivalent inclusion method and mapping conditions between the
prescribed linear distribution of macro-strain and corresponding micro-scale
field variables averaged over the volume and all possible orientations of
single grain. It is found that developed self-consistent scheme predicts the
absence of strong gradient effects at the macro-scale level for the model of
spherical grains. However, for the more general shape of the grains, considered
approach allows to obtain a set of non-linear relations for determination of
all effective standard and gradient elastic moduli of polycrystals.

Rutile GeO2 has been predicted to be an ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor
suitable for future power electronics devices while quartz-like GeO2 shows
piezoelectric properties. To explore these crystalline phases for application
and fundamental materials investigations, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is a
well-suited thin film growth technique. In this study, we investigate the
reaction kinetics of GeO2 during plasma-assisted MBE using elemental Ge and
plasma-activated oxygen fluxes. The growth rate as a function of oxygen flux is
measured in-situ by laser reflectometry at different growth temperatures. A
flux of the suboxide GeO desorbing off the growth surface is identified and
quantified in-situ by the line-of-sight quadrupole mass spectrometry. Our
measurements reveal that the suboxide formation and desorption limits the
growth rate under metal-rich or high temperature growth conditions, and leads
to etching of the grown GeO2 layer under Ge flux in the absence of oxygen. The
quantitative results fit the sub-compound mediated reaction model, indicating
the intermediate formation of the suboxide at the growth front. This model is
further utilized to delineate the GeO2-growth window in terms of oxygen-flux
and substrate temperature. Our study can serve as a guidance for the thin film
synthesis of GeO2 and defect-free mesa etching in future GeO2-device
processing.

Real structural glasses form through various out-of-equilibrium processes,
including temperature quenches, rapid compression, shear, and aging. Each of
these processes should be formally understandable within the recently
formulated dynamical mean-field theory of glasses, but many of the numerical
tools needed to solve the relevant equations for sufficiently long timescales
do not yet exist. Numerical simulations of structureless (and therefore
mean-field-like) model glass formers can nevertheless aid searching for and
understanding such solutions, thanks to their ability to disentangle structural
from dimensional effects. We here study the infinite-range Mari-Kurchan model
under simple non-equilibrium processes and compare the results with those from
the random Lorentz gas [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 55 334001, (2022)], which are
both mean-field-like and become formally equivalent in the limit of infinite
spatial dimensions. Of particular interest are jamming from crunching and under
instantaneous temperature quenches. The study allows for an algorithmic
understanding of the jamming density and of its approach to the
infinite-dimensional limit. The results provide important insight into the
eventual solution of the dynamical mean-field theory, including onsets and
anomalous relaxation, as well as into the various algorithmic schemes for
jamming.

Using principles of asymptotic analysis, we derive the exact leading
correction to the Thomas-Fermi kinetic energy approximation for Kohn-Sham
electrons for slabs. This asymptotic expansion approximation includes crucial
quantum oscillations missed by standard semilocal density functionals. Because
these account for the derivative discontinuity, chemical accuracy is achieved
at fourth-order. The implications for both orbital-free electronic structure
and exchange-correlation approximations are discussed.

Self-driving labs (SDLs) leverage combinations of artificial intelligence,
automation, and advanced computing to accelerate scientific discovery. The
promise of this field has given rise to a rich community of passionate
scientists, engineers, and social scientists, as evidenced by the development
of the Acceleration Consortium and recent Accelerate Conference. Despite its
strengths, this rapidly developing field presents numerous opportunities for
growth, challenges to overcome, and potential risks of which to remain aware.
This community perspective builds on a discourse instantiated during the first
Accelerate Conference, and looks to the future of self-driving labs with a
tempered optimism. Incorporating input from academia, government, and industry,
we briefly describe the current status of self-driving labs, then turn our
attention to barriers, opportunities, and a vision for what is possible. Our
field is delivering solutions in technology and infrastructure, artificial
intelligence and knowledge generation, and education and workforce development.
In the spirit of community, we intend for this work to foster discussion and
drive best practices as our field grows.

<h3>Monomodes in Tribonacci Chains</h3>

We introduce two 1D tight-binding models based on the Tribonacci
substitution, the hopping and on-site Tribonacci chains, which generalize the
Fibonacci chain. For both hopping and on-site models, a perturbative real-space
renormalization procedure is developed. We show that the two models are
equivalent at the fixed point of the renormalization group flow, and that the
renormalization procedure naturally gives the Local Resonator Modes.
Additionally, the Rauzy fractal, inherent to the Tribonacci substitution, is
shown to serve as the analog of conumbering for the Tribonacci chain. The
renormalization procedure is used to repeatedly subdivide the Rauzy fractal
into copies of itself, which can be used to describe the eigenstates in terms
of Local Resonator Modes. Finally, upon taking open boundary conditions of the
hopping model, edge monomodes are observed at nonzero energy, which are
localized only at one side of the chain. The localization behavior is
non-local, since it depends on more bonds than only the ones at the edge.

<h3>Many-Body Coherence in Quantum Transport</h3>

In this study, we propose the concept of harnessing quantum coherence to
control electron transport in a many-body system. Combining an open quantum
system technique based on Hubbard operators, we show that many-body coherence
can eliminate the well-known Coulomb staircase and cause strong negative
differential resistance. To explore the mechanism, we analytically derive the
current-coherence relationship in the zero electron-phonon coupling limit.
Furthermore, by incorporating a gate field, we demonstrate the possibility of
constructing a coherence-controlled transistor. This development opens up a new
direction for creating quantum electronic devices based on many-body coherence.

<h3>Universal scaling function ansatz for finite-temperature jamming</h3>

We cast a nonzero-temperature analysis of the jamming transition into the
framework of a scaling ansatz. We show that four distinct regimes for scaling
exponents of thermodynamic derivatives of the free energy such as pressure,
bulk and shear moduli, can be consolidated by introducing a universal scaling
function with two branches. Both the original analysis and the scaling theory
assume that the system always resides in a single basis in the energy
landscape. The two branches are separated by a line $T^*(\Delta \phi)$ in the
$T-\Delta \phi$ plane, where $\Delta \phi=\phi-\phi_c^\Lambda$ is the deviation
of the packing fraction from its critical, jamming value, $\phi_c^\Lambda$, for
that basin. The branch for $T<T^*(\Delta \phi)$ reduces at $T=0$ to an earlier
scaling ansatz that is restricted to $T=0$, $\Delta \phi \ge 0$, while the
branch for $T>T^*(\Delta \phi)$ reproduces exponents observed for thermal hard
spheres. In contrast to the usual scenario for critical phenomena, the two
branches are characterized by different exponents. We suggest that this unusual
feature can be resolved by the existence of a dangerous irrelevant variable
$u$, which can appear to modify exponents if the leading $u=0$ term is
sufficiently small in the regime described by one of the two branches of the
scaling function.

<h3>Transition to the Haldane phase driven by electron-electron correlations</h3>

One of the most famous quantum systems with topological properties, the spin
$\mathcal{S}=1$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, is well-known to display
exotic $\mathcal{S}=1/2$ edge states. However, this spin model has not been
analyzed from the more general perspective of strongly correlated systems
varying the electron-electron interaction strength. Here we report the
numerical investigation of the emergence of the Haldane state and its edge
modes in a system of interacting electrons - the two-orbital Hubbard model -
with increasing repulsion strength $U$. We show that these interactions not
only form the magnetic moments but also form a topologically nontrivial
fermionic many-body ground-state with zero-energy edges states that only at
very large $U$ converge to the Haldane chain model. Specifically, upon
increasing the strength of the Hubbard repulsion and Hund exchange, we identify
a novel sharp transition point separating topologically trivial and nontrivial
ground-states. Surprisingly, the latter appears already at rather small values
of the interaction $U$, in a regime where the magnetic moments are barely
developed, thus generalizing the ideas of Haldane for $\mathcal{S}=1$ spin
Heisenberg models into previously unexplored territory involving delocalized
electrons. Furthermore, our results indicate that the topological regime can be
described by a liquid valence bonds state down to interaction strength of the
order of the bare kinetic energy.
