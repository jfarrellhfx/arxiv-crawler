<h3>Solvable models for 2+1D quantum critical points: Loop soups of 1+1D  conformal field theories</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00037" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00037</a>

<i>Amin Moharramipour, Dan Sehayek, Thomas Scaffidi</i>
<br>
<br>
We construct a class of solvable models for 2+1D quantum critical points by
attaching 1+1D conformal field theories (CFTs) to fluctuating domain walls
forming a ``loop soup''. Specifically, our local Hamiltonian attaches gapless
spin chains to the domain walls of a triangular lattice Ising antiferromagnet.
The macroscopic degeneracy between antiferromagnetic configurations is split by
the Casimir energy of each decorating CFT, which is usually negative and thus
favors a short loop phase with a finite gap. However, we found a set of 1D CFT
Hamiltonians for which the Casimir energy is effectively positive, making it
favorable for domain walls to coalesce into a single ``snake'' which is
macroscopically long and thus hosts a CFT with a vanishing gap. The snake
configurations are geometrical objects also known as fully-packed self-avoiding
walks or Hamiltonian walks which are described by an $\mathrm{O}(n=0)$ loop
ensemble with a non-unitary 2+0D CFT description. Combining this description
with the 1+1D decoration CFT, we obtain a 2+1D theory with unusual critical
exponents and entanglement properties. Regarding the latter, we show that the
$\log$ contributions from the decoration CFTs conspire with the spatial
distribution of loops crossing the entanglement cut to generate a ``non-local
area law''. Our predictions are verified by Monte Carlo simulations.

<h3>Kinematically constrained vortex dynamics in charge density waves</h3>

<i>Marvin Qi, Andrew Lucas</i>
<br>
<br>
We build a minimal model of dissipative vortex dynamics in two spatial
dimensions, subject to a kinematic constraint: dipole conservation. The
additional conservation law implies anomalously slow decay rates for vortices.
We argue that this model of vortex dynamics is relevant for a broad range of
time scales during a quench into a uniaxial charge density wave state. Our
predictions are consistent with recent experiments on uniaxial charge density
wave formation in $\mathrm{LaTe}_3$.

<h3>Pb$_9$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O is a charge-transfer semiconductor</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00006" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00006</a>

<br>
<br>
By means of density functional theory and constrained random phase
approximation we analyze the bandstructure of Pb$_9$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O (named
LK-99). Our data show that the lead-phosphate apatite LK-99 in the proposed
Cu-doped structure is a semiconductor with predominant charge-transfer nature,
a result incompatible with a superconducting behaviour. In order to understand
the interesting electronic and magnetic properties of this compound, it will be
necessary to study the actual response to doping, the possibility of
alternative structural and stoichiometric (dis)orders and to clarify the
magnetic interactions as well as their impact on the electronic structure.

<h3>Orthogonality catastrophe beyond Luttinger liquid from post-selection</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00039" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00039</a>
<br>
<i>Martino Stefanini, Jamir Marino</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that the dynamics induced by post-selected measurements can serve as
a controlled route to access physical processes beyond the boundaries of
Luttinger liquid physics. We consider a one-dimensional fermionic wire whose
dynamics results from a sequence of weak measurements of the fermionic density
at a given site, interspersed with unitary hopping dynamics. This realizes a
non-Hermitian variant of the celebrated instance of a local scatterer in a
fermionic system and its ensuing orthogonality catastrophe. We observe a
distinct crossover in the system's time evolution as a function of the fermion
density. In the high-density regime, reminiscent of the Hermitian case,
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid physics properly describes the dynamics while, as we
delve into the low-density regime, the validity of bosonization breaks down,
giving rise to irreversible behavior. Notably, this crossover from reversible
to irreversible dynamics is non-perturbative in the measurement rate and can
manifest itself even with relatively shallow measurement rates, provided that
the system's density remains below the critical threshold. Our results render a
conceptually transparent model for exploring non-perturbative effects beyond
bosonization, which could be used as a step-stone to explore novel routes for
the control of non-linear dynamics in low-dimensional quantum systems.

<h3>Full-bandwidth anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg theory and its application  to superhydrides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00056" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00056</a>
<br>
<i>Roman Lucrezi, Pedro P. Ferreira, Samad Hajinazar, Hitoshi Mori, Hari Paudyal, Elena R. Margine, Christoph Heil</i>
<br>
<br>
We present an advanced implementation of the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg
theory within the EPW code package, enabling accurate and efficient
characterization of superconducting properties in materials with narrow bands
or critical points near the Fermi level. Unlike previous approaches, our method
accommodates scattering processes of electrons with energies and momenta beyond
the Fermi surface, achieved by a self-consistent determination of the mass
renormalization function, energy shift, and order parameter at each temperature
while maintaining charge neutrality. To significantly reduce computational
costs, we introduce a sparse, non-uniform sampling scheme along the imaginary
axis. This technique proves highly effective, making exploring a wide range of
materials feasible at low temperatures. We demonstrate the power of our
implementation by applying it to two classes of near room-temperature
superhydrides, namely the sodalite-like clathrates YH$_6$ and CaH$_6$, as well
as the covalently-bonded H$_3$S and D$_3$S. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed
investigation and comparison of the effect of maximizing the density of states
at the Fermi level for electron- and hole-doped H$_3$S and BaSiH$_8$. This
comparison includes our new full-bandwidth treatment and the previous constant
density-of-states approximation. The findings show significant improvements in
describing the superconducting state with our advanced approach, enabling the
study of materials with greater precision and computational efficiency, and
opening doors for exploring new possibilities and avenues in superconductivity
research.

<h3>Elucidating the impact of microstructure on mechanical properties of  phase-segregated polyurea: Finite element modeling of molecular dynamics  derived microstructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00065" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00065</a>
<br>
<i>Steven J. Yang, Stephanie I. Rosenbloom, Brett P. Fors, Meredith N. Silberstein</i>
<br>
<br>
Phase-segregated polyureas (PU) have received considerable interest due to
their use as tough, impact-resistant coatings. Polyureas are favored for these
applications due to their mechanical strain rate sensitivity and energy
dissipation. Predicting and tailoring the mechanical response of PU remains
challenging due to the complex interaction between its elastomeric and glassy
phases. To elucidate the role of PU microstructure on its mechanical
properties, we developed a finite element modeling framework in which each
phase is represented by a volume fraction within a representative volume
element (RVE). Critically, we used separate constitutive models to describe the
elastomeric and glassy phases. We developed a plasticity-driven breakdown
process in which we model the glassy phase disaggregating into a new phase. The
overall contribution of each phase at a material point is determined by their
respective volume fractions within the RVE. We applied our modeling methods to
two compositions of PU with differing elastomeric segment lengths derived from
oligoether diamines, Versalink P650 and P1000. Our simulations show that a
combination of microstructural differences and elastomeric phase properties
accounts for the difference in mechanical response between P650 and P1000. We
show our model's ability to predict PU behavior in various loading conditions,
including low-rate cyclic loading and monotonic loading over a wide range of
strain rates. Our model produces microstructure transformations that mirror
those indicated by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. Fourier
transform analysis of our RVEs reveals glassy phase fibrillation due to
deformation, a finding consistent with SAXS experiments.

<h3>Temporal credit assignment for one-shot learning utilizing a phase  transition material</h3>

Design of hardware based on biological principles of neuronal computation and
plasticity in the brain is a leading approach to realizing energy- and
sample-efficient artificial intelligence and learning machines. An important
factor in selection of the hardware building blocks is the identification of
candidate materials with physical properties suitable to emulate the large
dynamic ranges and varied timescales of neuronal signaling. Previous work has
shown that the all-or-none spiking behavior of neurons can be mimicked by
threshold switches utilizing phase transitions. Here we demonstrate that
devices based on a prototypical metal-insulator-transition material, vanadium
dioxide (VO2), can be dynamically controlled to access a continuum of
intermediate resistance states. Furthermore, the timescale of their intrinsic
relaxation can be configured to match a range of biologically-relevant
timescales from milliseconds to seconds. We exploit these device properties to
emulate three aspects of neuronal analog computation: fast (~1 ms) spiking in a
neuronal soma compartment, slow (~100 ms) spiking in a dendritic compartment,
and ultraslow (~1 s) biochemical signaling involved in temporal credit
assignment for a recently discovered biological mechanism of one-shot learning.
Simulations show that an artificial neural network using properties of VO2
devices to control an agent navigating a spatial environment can learn an
efficient path to a reward in up to 4 fold fewer trials than standard methods.
The phase relaxations described in our study may be engineered in a variety of
materials, and can be controlled by thermal, electrical, or optical stimuli,
suggesting further opportunities to emulate biological learning.

<h3>Inclusions, Boundaries and Disorder in Scalar Active Matter</h3>

Active systems are driven out of equilibrium by exchanging energy and
momentum with their environment. This endows them with anomalous mechanical
properties that we review in this colloquium for the case of dry scalar active
matter, which has attracted considerable attention. These unusual properties
lead to a rich physics when active fluids are in contact with boundaries,
inclusions, tracers, or disordered potentials. Indeed, studies of the
mechanical pressure of active fluids and of the dynamics of passive tracers
have shown that active systems impact their environment in non-trivial ways,
for example, by propelling and rotating anisotropic inclusions. Conversely, the
long-ranged density and current modulations induced by localized obstacles show
how the environment can have a far-reaching impact on active fluids. This is
best exemplified by the propensity of bulk and boundary disorder to destroy
bulk phase separation in active matter, showing active systems to be much more
sensitive to their surroundings than passive ones. This colloquium aims at
providing a unifying perspective on the rich interplay between active systems
and their environments.

<h3>Magnetic order in the two-dimensional metal-organic framework manganese  pyrazinecarboxylate with Mn-Mn dimers</h3>

The magnetic properties of [Mn(pyrazinecarboxylate)2]n (Mn-pyrazine),
empirical formula C10H6MnN4O4, are investigated through susceptibility, heat
capacity and neutron scattering measurements. The structure of Mn-pyrazine
consists of Mn-Mn dimers linked on a distorted 2D hexagonal structure. The weak
out of plane interactions create a quasi-2D magnetic material within the larger
three dimensional metal organic framework (MOF) structure. We show that this
material undergoes a two stage magnetic transition, related to the low
dimensionality of the Mn lattice. First at 5 K, which is assigned to the
initial development of short range order in the 2D layers. This is followed by
long range order at 3.3 K. Applied field measurements reveal the potential to
induce magnetic transitions in moderately small fields of 2 T. Neutron powder
diffraction enabled the determination of a unique magnetic space group P21'/c
(#14.77) at 1.5 K. This magnetic structure consists of antiferromagnetically
coupled Mn-Mn dimers with spins principally along the out of plane a-axis.

<h3>Surface State Dissipation in Confined 3He-A</h3>

We have studied the power dependence of superfluid Helmholtz resonators in
thin (750 and 1800 nm) rectangular channels. In the A-phase, we observe a
non-linear response for velocities larger than a critical value. The small size
of the channels stabilizes a static uniform texture, which eliminates
dissipative processes produced by changes in the texture. For such a static
texture, the lowest velocity dissipative process is due to the pumping of
surface bound states into the bulk liquid. We show that the temperature
dependence of the critical velocity observed in our devices is consistent with
this surface state dissipation. Characterization of the force-velocity curves
of our devices may provide a platform for studying the physics of exotic
surface bound states in superfluid $^3$He.

<h3>Realistic non-collinear ground states of solids with source-free  exchange correlation functional</h3>

<br>
In this work, we extend the source-free (SF) exchange correlation (XC)
functional developed by Sangeeta Sharma and co-workers to plane-wave density
functional theory (DFT) based on the projector augmented wave (PAW) method.
This constraint is implemented by the current authors within the VASP source
code, using a fast Poisson solver that capitalizes on the parallel
three-dimensional fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) implemented in VASP. Using
this modified XC functional, we explore the improved convergence behavior that
results from applying this constraint to the GGA-PBE+$U$+$J$ functional. In the
process, we compare the non-collinear magnetic ground state computed by each
functional and their SF counterpart for a select number of magnetic materials
in order to provide a metric for comparing with experimentally determined
magnetic orderings. We observe significantly improved agreement with
experimentally measured magnetic ground state structures after applying the
source-free constraint. Furthermore, we explore the importance of considering
probability current densities in spin polarized systems, even under no applied
field. We analyze the XC torque as well, in order to provide theoretical and
computational analyses of the net XC magnetic torque induced by the source-free
constraint. Along these lines, we highlight the importance of properly
considering the real-space integral of the source-free local magnetic XC field.
Our analysis on probability currents, net torque, and constant terms draws
additional links to the rich body of previous research on spin-current density
functional theory (SCDFT), and paves the way for future extensions and
corrections to the SF corrected XC functional.

Signatures of photo-induced superconductivity have been reported in cuprate
materials subjected to a coherent phonon drive. A 'cold' superfluid was
extracted from the transient Terahertz conductivity and was seen to coexist
with 'hot' uncondensed quasi-particles, a hallmark of a driven-dissipative
system of which the interplay between coherent and incoherent responses are not
well understood. Here, time resolved spontaneous Raman scattering was used to
probe the lattice temperature in the photo-induced superconducting state of
YBa2Cu3O6.48. An increase in lattice temperature of approximately 80 K was
observed by measuring the time dependent Raman scattering intensity of an
undriven 'spectator' phonon mode. This is to be compared with an estimated
increase in quasi-particle temperatures of nearly 200 K. These temperature
changes provide quantitative information on the nature of the driven state and
its decay, and may provide a strategy to optimize this effect.

<h3>Zero temperature phase transitions and their anomalous influence on  thermodynamic behavior in the q-state Potts model on a diamond chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00150" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00150</a>

<br>
<br>
The q-state Potts model on a diamond chain has mathematical significance in
analyzing phase transitions and critical behaviors in diverse fields, including
statistical physics, condensed matter physics, and materials science. By
focusing on the 3-state Potts model on a diamond chain, we reveal rich and
analytically solvable behaviors without phase transitions at finite
temperatures. Upon investigating thermodynamic properties such as internal
energy, entropy, specific heat, and correlation length, we observe sharp
changes near zero temperature. Magnetic properties, including magnetization and
magnetic susceptibility, display distinct behaviors that provide insights into
spin configurations in different phases. However, the Potts model lacks genuine
phase transitions at finite temperatures, in line with the Peierls argument for
one-dimensional systems. Nonetheless, in the general case of an arbitrary
$q$-state, magnetic properties such as correlation length, magnetization, and
magnetic susceptibility exhibit intriguing remnants of a zero-temperature phase
transition at finite temperatures. Furthermore, residual entropy uncovers
unusual frustrated regions at zero-temperature phase transitions. This feature
leads to the peculiar thermodynamic properties of phase boundaries, including a
sharp entropy change resembling a first-order discontinuity without an entropy
jump, and pronounced peaks in second-order derivatives of free energy,
suggestive of a second-order phase transition divergence, but without
singularities. This unusual behavior is also observed in the correlation length
at the pseudo-critical temperature, which could potentially be misleading as a
divergence.

<h3>Topological Localized Modes In Moiré Lattices of Bilayer Elastic  Plates With Resonators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00182" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00182</a>
<br>
<i>Tamanna Akter Jui, Raj Kumar Pal</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the existence of higher order topological localized modes in
moir\'{e} lattices of bilayer elastic plates. Each plate has a hexagonal array
of discrete resonators and one of the plates is rotated an angle
($21.78^\circ$) which results in a periodic moir\'{e} lattice with the smallest
area. The two plates are then coupled by inter-layer springs at discrete
locations where the top and bottom plate resonators coincide. Dispersion
analysis using the plane wave expansion method reveals that a bandgap opens on
adding the inter-layer springs. The corresponding topological index, namely
fractional corner mode, for bands below the bandgap predicts the presence of
corner localized modes in a finite structure. Numerical simulations of
frequency response show localization at all corners, consistent with the
theoretical predictions. The considered continuous elastic bilayered moir\'{e}
structures opens opportunities for novel wave phenomena, with potential
applications in tunable energy localization and vibration isolation.

One of the most ancient forms of life dating to ~3.5 billion years ago,
cyanobacteria are highly abundant organisms that convert light into energy and
motion, often within conjoined filaments and larger colonies. We study how
gradients of light intensity trigger orderly phototactic motions and dense
bacterial communities, which remained quantitatively unexplored despite being
among the oldest forms of active living matter on Earth. The phototaxis drives
a transition from initially polar motions of semiflexible long filaments along
complex curved spatiotemporal trajectories confined within illuminated areas to
their bipolar motility in the ensuing crowded environment. We demonstrate how
simply shining light causes a spontaneous self-assembly of two- and
three-dimensional active nematic states of cyanobacterial filaments, with a
plethora of motile and static topological defects. We quantify light-controlled
evolutions of orientational and velocity order parameters during the transition
between disordered and orientationally ordered states of our photosynthetic
active matter, as well as the subsequent active nematic's fluid-gel
transformation. Patterned illumination and foreign inclusions with different
shapes interact with cyanobacterial active nematics in nontrivial ways, while
inducing soft interfacial boundary conditions and quasi-boojum-like defects.
Commanding this cyanobacterial collective behavior could aid inhibiting
generation of toxins or enhancing production of oxygen and biomaterials.

<h3>High gas pressure and high-temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) technique and  its impact on iron-based superconductors</h3>

The high-pressure growth technique generally plays an important role in the
improvement of the sample quality and the enhancement of various physical and
magnetic properties of materials. The high gas pressure technique provides a
large sample space (10-15 cm) to grow various kinds of materials. In this
paper, we introduce the high gas pressure and high-temperature synthesis
(HP-HTS) technique that is present at our institute and is applied to the
growth process of different kinds of superconducting materials, particularly
iron-based superconductors. More details and the working principle of this
HP-HTS technique are discussed. We have also demonstrated the current results
based on the iron-based superconductors by using this unique HP-HTS technique.
These results demonstrate the enhancement of the superconducting properties
with the improved sample quality compared to the conventional synthesis process
at ambient pressure.

<br>
We study fermions on a finite chain, interacting repulsively when residing on
the same and on nearest-neighbor sites, and subjected to a Wannier-Stark
linearly-varying potential. Using the density matrix renormalization-group
numerical technique to solve this generalized extended Hubbard model, the
ground state exhibits a staircase of (quasi) plateaus in the average local site
density along the chain, decreasing from being doubly-filled to empty as the
potential increases. These `plateaus' represent locked-in commensurate phases
of charge density waves together with band and Mott insulators. These phases
are separated by incompressible regions with incommensurate fillings. It is
suggested that experimental variations of the slope of the potential and of the
range of the repulsive interactions will produce such a coexistence of phases
which have been individually expected theoretically and observed experimentally
for uniform systems.

<h3>Chain decay and rates disorder in the totally asymmetric simple  exclusion process</h3>

<br>
<br>
We theoretically study the Totally Asymmetric Exclusion Process (TASEP) with
quenched jumping rates disorder and finite lifetime chain. TASEP is widely used
to model the translation of messenger RNAs by Ribosomes in protein synthesis.
Since the exact solution of the TASEP model is analytically and computationally
intractable for biologically relevant systems parameters, the canonical
Mean-Field (MF) approaches of solving coupled non-linear differential equations
is also computational expensive for the scale of relevant biological data
analysis. In this article, we provide alternative approach to computing the MF
steady state solution via a computationally efficient system of non-linear
algebraic equations. We further outline a framework for including correlations
progressively via the exact solution of small size TASEP system. Leading order
approximation in the biologically relevant entry rate limited regime shows
remarkable agreement with the full Monte-Carlo simulation result for a wide
range of system parameter space. These results could be of importance to the
kinetic rates inference in Ribo-Seq data analysis and other related problems.

<h3>Asymptotic analysis of conversion-limited phase separation</h3>

Liquid-liquid phase separation plays a major role in the formation and
maintenance of various membrane-less subcellular structures in the cytoplasm
and nucleus of cells. Biological condensates contain enhanced concentrations of
proteins and RNA, many of which can be continually exchanged with the
surrounding medium. Coarsening is an important step in the kinetics of phase
separation, whereby an emulsion of polydisperse condensates transitions to a
single condensate in thermodynamic equilibrium with a surrounding dilute phase.
A key feature of biological phase separation is the co-existence of multiple
condensates over significant time scales, which is consistent with experimental
observations showing a slowing of coarsening rates. It has recently been
proposed that one rate limiting step could be the slow interfacial conversion
of a molecular constituent between the dilute and dense phases. In this paper
we analyze conversion-limited phase separation within the framework of
diffusion in singularly perturbed domains, which exploits the fact that
biological condensates tend to be much smaller than the size of a cell. Using
matched asymptotic analysis, we solve the quasi-static diffusion equation for
the concentration in the dilute phase, and then derive kinetic equations for
the slow growth/shrinkage of the condensates. This provides a systematic way of
obtaining corrections to mean-field theory that take into account the geometry
of the cell and the locations of all the condensates.

<h3>A molecular Ferroelectric thin film of imidazolium perchlorate on  Silicon</h3>

Molecular ferroelectric materials have attracted widespread attention due to
their abundant chemical diversity, structural tunability, low synthesis
temperature, and high flexibility. Meanwhile, the integration of molecular
ferroelectric materials and Si is still challenging, while the fundamental
understanding of the ferroelectric switching process is still lacking. Herein,
we have successfully synthesized the imidazole perchlorate (ImClO4) single
crystals and a series of high-quality highly-oriented thin films on a Si
substrate. A high inverse piezoelectric coefficient (55.7 pm/V) is demonstrated
for the thin films. Two types of domain bands can be observed (in the size of a
few microns): type-I band tilts ~60{\deg} with respect to the horizontal axis,
while the type-II band is perpendicular to the horizontal axis. Most of the
domain walls (DWs) are 180{\deg} DWs for the two bands, while some 109{\deg}
DWs can also be observed. Interestingly, the DWs in type-I band are curved,
charged domain walls; while the 180{\deg} DWs in type-II band are straight,
noncharged domain walls. After applying +20 V for 5 s through a PFM tip, the
180{\deg} DWs in type-I band shrink first, then disconnect from the band
boundary, forming a needle-like domain with a size of ~100 nm. The needle-like
domain will extend toward the band boundary after an inverse bias is applied
(-20 V), and expand along the band boundary after touching the boundary.
Whereas for the type-II domain band, the 180{\deg} DWs are more mobile than the
109{\deg} domain walls, which displaces ~500 nm after applying +20 V. While
such displacement is much shorter after the application of a negative bias for
the same duration, starting from the positively poled sample. We hope to spur
further interest in the on-chip design of the molecular ferroelectrics based
electronic devices.

Lead-free solder alloys based on tin, silver, or copper-based ones, have
gained popularity over lead-based options due to improved properties and
safety. In our previous studies, the stress-strain behavior of SAC305 was
studied under varying cooling rate. This study investigates various lead-free
solder materials such as Sn, Sn-Ag, and SAC305 to compare the relative
mechanical and cyclic properties of lead-free solder materials. The cooling
rate is an important controlling parameter of microstructure and mechanical
properties and hence, by using molecular dynamics, the atomistic models are
first melted at a constant rate and then cooled at various rates, including 2.5
K/ps, 10 K/ps, 50 K/ps, and 100 K/ps, and an exponential cooling is also used
to resemble real-world cooling phenomena. A set of modified embedded atomic
model interatomic potentials are used to perform the tensile test and cyclic
loading. The tensile test has been conducted until fracture occurred at a
constant strain rate. In addition, the cyclic loading behavior of the materials
in the strain range of -10% to 10% for 10 cycles are investigated. The result
implies that cooling rates have a substantial influence on mechanical
properties, with slower cooling rates (2.5 K/ps and 10 K/ps) having a
considerable difference and between the higher cooling rates (50 K/ps and 100
K/ps) the observed alterations in mechanical properties are not substantial.
The ultimate strength, Young's modulus, modulus of resilience, and coefficient
of thermal expansion are negatively correlated with increasing cooling rates.
The modulus of toughness exhibits an increasing trend, indicating that the
capacity to resist impact loading has increased. To comprehend the extent of
energy dissipation during cyclic loading, the hysteresis loop area and stress
amplitude of cyclic loading have been examined.

materials, oxides. topological insulators, organic materials etc. using a
combination of experimnetal and computational tools. Some of the useful
highlights are as follows: (a) tuning and control of the magnetic and
electronic state of 2D magentic materials with rapid enhancement in the Curie
temperature, (b) Design and detection of single electron transistor based
nanosensors for the detection of biological species with single molecular

Inconel-718's compatibility with additive manufacturing (AM) has made it a
center of attention for researchers. This paper focuses on how cooling rates
affect the hardness of AM Inconel-718. To study the AM process, monocrystalline
and polycrystalline Inconel-718 layers were added to a pristine substrate and
equilibrated at 2000 K before being cooled to 300 K using cooling rates ranging
from 5 K/ps to 100 K/ps, as well as an exponential cooling rate. The layers
were then subjected to atomistic nanoindentation simulation to analyze the
nanomechanical response, including hardness, dislocation density,
microstructure, and surface imprints, at different cooling rates.
Load-displacement (P-h) curves were plotted for each cooling rate. The findings
of this study provide crucial insights into the effect of cooling rate on the
nanoindentation-based response of additively manufactured Inconel-718. These
insights can aid in the design of high-performance components for various
applications

Due to the vast chemical space, discovering materials with a specific
function is challenging. Chemical formulas are obligated to conform to a set of
exacting criteria such as charge neutrality, balanced electronegativity,
synthesizability, and mechanical stability. In response to this formidable
task, we introduce a deep learning-based generative model for material
composition and structure design by learning and exploiting explicit and
implicit chemical knowledge. Our pipeline first uses deep diffusion language
models as the generator of compositions and then applies a template-based
crystal structure prediction algorithm to predict their corresponding
structures, which is then followed by structure relaxation using a universal
graph neural network-based potential. The density functional theory (DFT)
calculations of the formation energies and energy-above-the-hull analysis are
used to validate new structures generated through our pipeline. Based on the
DFT calculation results, six new materials, including Ti2HfO5, TaNbP, YMoN2,
TaReO4, HfTiO2, and HfMnO2, with formation energy less than zero have been
found. Remarkably, among these, four materials, namely Ti2$HfO5, TaNbP, YMoN2,
and TaReO4, exhibit an e-above-hull energy of less than 0.3 eV. These findings
have proved the effectiveness of our approach.

In the study of the thermalization of closed quantum systems, the role of
kinetic constraints on the temporal dynamics and the eventual thermalization is
attracting significant interest. Kinetic constraints typically lead to
long-lived metastable states depending on initial conditions. We consider a
model of interacting hardcore bosons with an additional kinetic constraint that
was originally devised to capture glassy dynamics at high densities. As a main
result, we demonstrate that the system is highly prone to localization in the
presence of uncorrelated disorder. Adding disorder quickly triggers long-lived
dynamics as evidenced in the time evolution of density autocorrelations.
Moreover, the kinetic constraint favors localization also in the eigenstates,
where a finite-size transition to a many-body localized phase occurs for much
lower disorder strengths than for the same model without a kinetic constraint.
Our work sheds light on the intricate interplay of kinetic constraints and
localization and may provide additional control over many-body localized phases
in the time domain.

We propose a comprehensive theoretical formulation of magnetic penetration
depth, $\lambda(T)$, based on the microscopic calculations for a general
superconducting gap symmetry. Our findings admit the significant role of band
structure and Fermi surface topology together with the symmetry of
superconducting order parameter. We employ our findings pertaining to the
heavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn$_5$ to explore both local and non-local
behaviors in response to an external magnetic field across varying
temperatures. Our calculations in the low-temperature regime offer compelling
macroscopic evidence of the nodal character within the superconducting state
with $d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetry. Furthermore, our findings align with the
characteristics of London-type superconductivity, holding significant
implications for upcoming experiments.

<br>
<br>
Concurrent structural and electronic transformations in VO2 thin films are of
twofold importance: enabling fine-tuning of the emergent electrical properties
in functional devices, yet creating an intricate interfacial domain structure
of transitional phases. Despite the importance of understanding the structure
of VO2 thin films, a detailed real space atomic structure analysis in which
also the oxygen atomic columns are resolved is lacking. Moreover, intermediate
atomic structures have remained elusive due to the lack of robust atomically
resolved quantitative analysis. Here, we directly resolve both V and O atomic
columns and discover the presence of the strain-stabilized intermediate
monoclinic (M2) phase nanolayers (less than 2 nm thick) in epitaxially grown
VO2 films on a TiO2 (001) substrate, where the dominant part of VO2 undergoes a
transition from the tetragonal (rutile) phase to the monoclinic M1 phase. We
unfold the crucial role of imaging the spatial configurations of the oxygen
anions (in addition to V cations) utilizing atomic-resolution electron
microscopy. Our approach sets a direct pathway to unravel the structural
transitions in wide range of correlated oxides, offering substantial
implications for e.g. optoelectronics and ferroelectrics.

<h3>Quantum spin Hall states in the lateral heteromonolayers of WTe2-MoTe2</h3>

<br>
<br>
We used density functional theory to investigate the lateral heteromonolayers
of WTe2 and MoTe2. We confirmed that topologically nontrivial and trivial
phases are energetically favored for the WTe2 and MoTe2 monolayers, taken out
of bulk Td-WTe2 and 2H-MoTe2, respectively. We considered heteromonolayers
consisting of these stable building blocks. In the Td-WTe2 and 2H-MoTe2
heteromonolayers with the interfaces oriented perpendicular to the dimer chains
of W atoms in Td-WTe2 (y direction), two pairs of helical (quantum spin Hall
[QSH]) states, one at each interface, connect the valence and conduction bands.
The strain induced by the large lattice mismatch of the two materials in the y
direction widens the band gap of the QSH insulator of the Td-WTe2 monolayer and
is essential for electronic applications. Furthermore, one-dimensional channels
embedded in the layer can help avoid chemical degradation from the edges and
facilitate the densification of conducting channels. For the heteromonolayer
with interfaces in the x direction, the difference in atomic structure between
the two interfaces due to low symmetry creates an energy difference between two
helical states and a potential gradient in the wide band gap 2H-MoTe2 region,
resulting in various interface localized bands.

<br>
It is known that there is also a topological phase in the SSH coupled-spring
system with the fixed-end boundary conditions. When this is the case, there
would exist edge modes on its boundaries. In contrast, if the system satisfies
the free-end boundary conditions, there is no edge mode, even if it is the
topological phase. We show that by varying the force constant of the spring by
the boundary in such a system, edge modes would generally appear independent of
whether the bulk of the system is in the topological or trivial phases.
Moreover, edge modes could exist even if the system satisfies the free-end
boundary conditions.

<br>
In this work, density functional theory (DFT) is used to find out the ground
state structures of A2AuScX6 (A= Cs, Rb; X= Cl, Br, I) double Perovskite (DP)
halides for the first time. The DP A2AuScX6 halides were studied for their
structural phase stability and optoelectronic properties in order to identify
potential materials for energy harvesting systems. The stability criteria were
verified by computing the formation energy, binding energy, phonon dispersion
curve, stiffness constants, tolerance, and octahedral factors. The electronic
band structure, carrier effective mass, density of states (DOS), and charge
density distribution were calculated to reveal the nature of electronic
conductivity and the chemical bonding nature present within them. For Cs2AuScX6
(Rb2AuScX6) [X = Cl, Br, I], the corresponding values of band gap [using
TB-mBJ] are 1.88 (1.93), 1.68 (1.71), and 1.30 (1.32) eV. The optical constants
(dielectric function, absorption coefficient, refractive index, energy loss
function, photoconductivity, and reflectivity) were also calculated to get more
insights into their electronic nature. For Cs2AuScX6 (Rb2AuScX6) [X = Cl, Br,
I], the absorption coefficient in the visible range are 3.33 (3.45) 105 cm-1,
2.70 (2.81) 105 cm-1, and 2.13 (2.18) 105 cm-1, respectively. We also
investigated the thermoelectric properties to predict promising applications in
thermoelectric devices. Our calculations revealed high ZT values of 0.92, 1.07,
and 1.06 for Cs2AuScX6 (X = Cl, Br, I) and 0.97, 0.99, and 1.01 for Rb2AuScX6
(X = Cl, Br, I) at 300 K. To further aid in predicting any novel materials,
routine research was also done on the thermo-mechanical characteristics. The
results suggest the compounds considered as potential candidates for use in
solar cells and/or thermoelectric devices.

The dynamics of a probe particle is highly influenced by the nature of the
bath in which it is immersed. In particular, baths composed by active (e.g.,
self-propelled) particles induce intriguing out-of-equilibrium effects on
tracer's motion that are customarily described by integrating out the dynamics
of the bath's degrees of freedom (DOFs). However, thermodynamic quantities,
such as the entropy production rate, are generally severely affected by
coarse-graining procedures. Here, we show that active baths are associated with
the presence of \textit{entropic} DOFs exhibiting non-reciprocal interactions
with a probe particle. Surprisingly, integrating out these DOFs inevitably
results into a system-dependent increase or reduction of the entropy production
rate. On the contrary, it stays invariant after integrating out
\textit{non-entropic} DOFs. As a consequence, they determine the dimensionality
of isoentropic hypersurfaces in the parameter space. Our results shed light on
the nature of active baths, revealing that the presence of a typical
correlation time-scale is not a sufficient condition to have non-equilibrium
effects on a probe particle, and draws a path towards the understanding of
thermodynamically-consistent procedures to derive effective dynamics of
observed DOFs.

<h3>Transition path theory for diffusive search with stochastic resetting</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00622" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00622</a>
<br>
<i>Paul C Bressloff</i>
<br>
<br>
Many chemical reactions can be formulated in terms of particle diffusion in a
complex energy landscape. Transition path theory (TPT) is a theoretical
framework for describing the direct (reaction) pathways from reactant to
product states within this energy landscape, and calculating the effective
reaction rate. It is now the standard method for analyzing rare events between
long lived states. In this paper, we consider a completely different
application of TPT, namely, a dual-aspect diffusive search process in which a
particle alternates between collecting cargo from a source domain $A$ and then
delivering it to a target domain $B$. The rate of resource accumulation at the
target, $k_{AB}$, is determined by the statistics of direct (reactive or
transport) paths from A to B. Rather than considering diffusion in a complex
energy landscape, we focus on pure diffusion with stochastic resetting.
Resetting introduces two non-trivial problems in the application of TPT. First,
the process is not time-reversal invariant, which is reflected by the fact that
there exists a unique non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS). Second,
calculating $k_{AB}$ involves determining the total probability flux of direct
transport paths across a dividing surface $S$ between $A$ and $B$. This
requires taking into account discontinuous jumps across $S$ due to resetting.
We derive a general expression for $k_{AB}$ and show that it is independent of
the choice of dividing surface. Finally, using the example of diffusion in a
finite interval, we show that there exists an optimal resetting rate at which
$k_{AB}$ is maximized. We explore how this feature depends on model parameters.

We synthesize a thin film composed of long carbyne chains terminated by gold
clusters and study its optical properties. The presence of gold particles
stabilizes longer chains and leads to their alignment. We show that the gold
clusters also act as a source of electron doping thus changing the intensity of
photoluminescence from quadratic dependence on the pumping intensity without
gold to linear with gold. We also observe that the excitation of the film at
the gold plasmon frequency causes the blue shift of photoluminescence and
estimate on the basis of this effect the minimum length of the carbyne chains.
The high degree of alignment of the gold-terminated carbyne chains results in
strongly anisotropic light absorption characterized by a distinctive cosine
dependence on the angle between the carbyne molecule and polarization plane of
the excitation. This paves the way for a new class of ultimately-thin
polarization sensitive emitters to be used in future integrated quantum
photonics devices.

Diamond-type structure allotrope {\alpha}-Sn is attracting much attention as
a topological Dirac semimetal (TDS). In this study, we demonstrate that
{\alpha}-Sn undergoes a phase transition to another allotrope {\beta}-Sn with
superconductivity at low temperature by irradiating with a focused Ga ion beam
(FIB). To clarify the transition mechanism, we performed X-ray photoemission
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on an {\alpha}-Sn thin film irradiated with FIB
and an as-grown {\alpha}-Sn thin film. The XPS results suggest that the local
annealing, which is one of the side effects of FIB, causes the transformation
from {\alpha}-Sn into {\beta}-Sn. Furthermore, the difference in the chemical
states between {\alpha}-Sn and {\beta}-Sn can be quantitatively explained by
the crystal structures rather than the degree of metallicity reflecting the
conductivity. These results propose a new way of fabricating TDS/superconductor
in-plane heterostructures based on {\alpha}-Sn and {\beta}-Sn.

At magic twisted angles, Dirac cones in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) can
evolve into flat bands, serving a critical playground for the study of strongly
correlated physics. When chiral symmetry is introduced, rigorous mathematical
proof confirms that the flat bands are locked at zero energy in the entire
Moir\'{e} Brillouin zone (BZ). Yet, TBG is not the sole platform that exhibits
this absolute band flatness. Central to this flatness phenomenon are
topological nodes and their specific locations in the BZ. In this study,
considering TBSs that preserve chiral symmetry, we classify various ordered
topological nodes in base layers and all possible node locations across
different BZs. Specifically, we constrain the node locations to rotational
centers, such as $\Gamma$ and $\text{M}$ points, to ensure the interlayer
coupling retains equal strength in all directions. Using this classification as
a foundation, we systematically identify the conditions under which MFBs
emerge. Additionally, through the extension of holomorphic functions, we
provide a proof that flat bands are locked at zero energy, shedding light on
the origin of the band flatness. Remarkably, beyond Dirac cones, numerous
twisted bilayer nodal platforms can host the flat bands with the degeneracy
number more than two, such as four-fold, six-fold, and eight-fold. This
multiplicity of degeneracy in flat bands might unveil more complex and enriched
correlation physics.

In this study, we investigate the effect of proximity-induced spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) on Landau levels in graphene-transition metal dichalcogenides
heterostructures. Using a simple theoretical model, we show that the SOC splits
the electronic band in graphene at zero magnetic field that causes Landau level
crossings at finite magnetic fields in quantum Hall regime. In particular, we
find that the crossings among a few low-energy Landau levels sensitively depend
on the strength of the SOC, suggesting that it can be used to estimate the SOC
strengths in the system. To demonstrate this, we present an experimental
signature of such Landau level crosssings and discuss its implications by
comparing the data with calculation results. Our study provides a practical
strategy to analyze Landau level spectrum in graphene with SOC.

<br>
We formulate and analyze in detail the ground state quantum electrodynamical
density functional theory (QEDFT) for a generalized Dicke model describing a
collection of $N$ tight-binding dimers minimally coupled to a cavity photon
mode. This model is aimed at capturing essential physics of molecules in
quantum cavities in polaritonic chemistry, or quantum emitters embedded in
mesoscopic resonators of the circuit QED, and, because of its simplicity, is
expected to provide important insights regarding the general QEDFT. We adopt
the adiabatic connection formalism and the diagrammatic many-body theory to
regularly derive a sequence of explicit approximations for the
exchange-correlation (xc) energy in the ground state QEDFT, and to compare
their performance with the results of exact numerical diagonalization.
Specifically, we analyze the earlier proposed one-photon optimized effective
potential (OEP) scheme, its direct second order extensions, and a
non-perturbative xc functional based on the photon random phase approximation
(RPA). Our results demonstrate the excellent performance of RPA-QEDFT in the
ultrastrong coupling regime, and for any number $N$ of Dicke molecules in the
cavity. We study in detail the scaling of xc energy with $N$, and emphasize the
importance for the ground state QEDFT of collective effects in the interaction
of molecules with cavity photons. Finally, we discuss implications of our
results for realistic systems.

Excitons are compound particles formed from an electron and a hole in
semiconductors. The impact of this substructure on the phonon-exciton
interaction is described by a closed system of microscopic scattering
equations. To calculate the actual excitonic thermalization properties beyond
the pure bosonic picture, this equation is derived directly from an
electron-hole picture within the Heisenberg equation of motion framework. In
addition to the well-known bosonic character of the compound particles, we
identified processes of a repulsive, fermionic type, as well as attractive
carrier exchange contributing to the scattering process. In this analytical
study we give general statements about the thermalization of excitons in two
and three dimensional semiconductors. We give insights on the strong dependence
of the thermalization characteristics of the exciton Bohr radius and the
thermalization wavelength. Above all, we analytically provide arguments why a
bosonic behavior of excitons - such as an enhanced ground state occupation -
requires the dominant phonon scattering to be quasielastic. Acoustic phonons
tend to fulfil this, as each scattering event only takes small amounts of
energy out of the distribution, while optical phonons tend to prevent
macroscopic occupations of the lowest exciton state, since the Pauli repulsion
between the individual carriers will then dominate the thermalization dynamics.

<h3>Effect of Spin Fluctuations on Magnetoresistance and Anomalous Hall  Effect in the Chiral Magnet Co8Zn8Mn4</h3>

<br>
<br>
The beta Mn type Co-Zn-Mn alloys have seized significant attention due to
their ability to host skyrmions at room temperature. Here we analyse the
unconventional magneto-transport properties of Co8Zn8Mn4 single crystals with a
Curie temperature of 275 K. A negative magnetoresistance is obtained over a
wide temperature range of 50K to 300K. The deviation of the isothermal
magnetoresistance (MR) curves from linearity to non-linearity as one approaches
higher temperatures points towards the transition from the dominance of magnons
to spin fluctuations. In the paramagnetic phase, the change in the shape of the
MR curve has been explained using the Khosla and Fischer model. The
relationship between the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and longitudinal
resistivity reveals the dominance of the skew-scattering mechanism, which is
inexplicable based on the theories of semi-classical magneto-transport. We
experimentally determine that the spin fluctuation is the source of the
skew-scattering mechanism in Co8Zn8Mn4. In general skew-scattering mechanisms
predominate in compounds with high conductivity, but our findings demonstrate
that this is not always the case and that other aspects also require equal
consideration. Our work throws new light on the predominant scattering
mechanism in chiral magnets with skyrmionics phase at low conductivity.

<h3>Derivation of the non-equilibrium generalized Langevin equation from a  generic time-dependent Hamiltonian</h3>

<br>
<br>
It has been become standard practice to describe steady-state non-equilibrium
phenomena by Langevin equations with colored noise and time-dependent friction
kernels that do not obey the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, but since these
Langevin equations are typically not derived from first-principle Hamiltonian
dynamics it is not clear whether they correspond to physically realizable
scenarios. By exact Mori projection in phase space we derive the
non-equilibrium generalized Langevin equation (GLE) from a generic many-body
Hamiltonian with a time-dependent force h(t) acting on an arbitrary phase-space
dependent observable $A$. The GLE is obtained in explicit form to all orders in
$h(t)$. For non-equilibrium observables that correspond to a Gaussian process,
the resultant GLE has the same form as the equilibrium Mori GLE, in particular
the memory kernel is proportional to the total force autocorrelation function.
This means that the extraction and simulation methods developed for equilibrium
GLEs can be used also for non-equilibrium Gaussian variables. This is a
non-trivial and very useful result, as many observables that characterize
non-equilibrium systems display Gaussian statistics. For non-Gaussian
non-equilibrium variables correction terms appear in the GLE and in the
relation between the complementary force autocorrelations and the memory
kernels, which are explicitly given in term of cubic correlation functions of
$A$. Interpreting the time-dependent force h(t) as a stochastic process, we
derive non-equilibrium corrections to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and
methods to extract all GLE parameters from experimental or simulation data,
thus making our non-equilibrium GLE a practical tool to study and model general
non-equilibrium systems.

This work presents electronic properties of the kagome metal ScV6Sn6 using de
Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations and density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. The torque signal with the applied fields up to 43 T shows clear
dHvA oscillations with six major frequencies, five of them are below 400 T (low
frequencies) and one is nearly 2800 T (high frequency). The Berry phase
calculated using the Landau level fan diagram near the quantum limit is
approximately {\pi}, which suggests the non-trivial band topology in ScV6Sn6.
To explain the experimental data, we computed the electronic band structure and
Fermi surface using DFT in both the pristine and charge density wave (CDW)
phases. Our results confirm that the CDW phase is energetically favorable, and
the Fermi surface undergoes a severe reconstruction in the CDW state.
Furthermore, the angular dependence of the dHvA frequencies are consistent with
the DFT calculations. The detailed electronic properties presented here are
invaluable for understanding the electronic structure and CDWorder in ScV6Sn6,
as well as in other vanadium-based kagome systems.

Conventional magneto-oscillations of conductivity in three dimensions are
washed out as the temperature exceeds the spacing between the Landau levels.
This is due to smearing of the Fermi distribution. In two dimensions, in the
presence of two or more size-quantization sub-bands, there is an additional
type of magneto-oscillations, usually referred to as magneto-inter-sub-band
oscillations, which do not decay exponentially with temperature. The period of
these oscillations is determined by the condition that the energy separation
between the sub-bands contains an integer number of Landau levels. Under this
condition, which does not contain the Fermi distribution, the inter-sub-band
scattering rate is maximal. Here we show that, with only one sub-band,
high-temperature oscillations are still possible. They develop when the
electron spectrum is split due to the spin-orbit coupling. For these additional
oscillations, the coupling enters both, the period and the decay rate.

Electrochemical degradation of solid electrolytes is a major roadblock in the
development of solid-state batteries, and the formed solid-solid interphase
(SSI) plays a key role in the performance of solid-state batteries. In this
study, by combining experimental X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)
measurements, first-principles simulations, and unsupervised machine learning,
we have unraveled the atomic-scale oxidative degradation mechanisms of sulfide
electrolytes at the interface using the baseline Li3PS4 (LPS) electrolyte as a
model system. The degradation begins with a decrease of Li neighbor affinity to
S atoms upon initial delithiation, followed by the formation of S-S bonds as
the PS4 tetrahedron deforms. After the first delithiation cycle, the PS4 motifs
become strongly distorted and PS3 motifs start to form. Spectral fingerprints
of the local structural evolution are identified, which correspond to the main
peak broadening and the peak shifting to a higher energy by about 2.5 eV in P
K-edge XAS and a new peak emerging at 2473 eV in S K-edge XAS during
delithiation. The spectral fingerprints serve as a proxy for the
electrochemical stability of phosphorus sulfide solid electrolytes beyond LPS,
as demonstrated in argyrodite Li6PS5Cl. We observed that the strong distortion
and destruction of PS4 tetrahedra and the formation of S-S bonds are correlated
with an increased interfacial impedance. To the best of our knowledge, this
study showcases the first atomic-scale insights into the oxidative degradation
mechanism of the LPS electrolyte, which can provide guidance for controlling
macroscopic reactions through microstructural engineering and, more generally,
can advance the rational design of sulfide electrolytes.

In this study, we investigate the behavior of free inertial Active Brownian
Particles (ABP) in the presence of thermal noise. While finding a closed-form
solution for the joint distribution of positions, orientations, and velocities
using the Fokker-Planck equation is generally challenging, we utilize a Laplace
transform method to obtain the exact temporal evolution of all dynamical
moments in arbitrary dimensions. Our expressions in $d$ dimensions reveal that
inertia significantly impacts steady-state kinetic temperature and swim
pressure while leaving the late-time diffusivity unchanged. Notably, the
velocity distribution exhibits a remarkable re-entrant transition from passive
Gaussian to active non-Gaussian behaviors. We construct a phase diagram using
the exact expression of the $d$-dimensional kurtosis as a function of activity
and inertia. Our analytic expressions describe steady states and offer insights
into time-dependent crossovers observed in various velocity and displacement
moments.

<br>
Recently, there have been significant advancements in the study of
Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), particularly in the discovery of glassy states
in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), a subset of MOFs. However, the
correlation between the glass-forming ability (GFA) of MOFs and their
structural characteristics remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we
analyze over 20,000 MOFs from the QMOF database, comparing geometric and
electronic order parameters between ZIFs and other MOFs. Our findings reveal a
set of order parameters that effectively capture the thermal stability and GFA
of MOFs, acting as structural genes to predict glass formation. Through
molecular dynamics simulations on representative ZIF structures, we validate
the reliability of these order parameters, particularly the total bond-order
density (TBOD) and the largest cavity diameter (LCD), for screening potential
melt-quenched MOFs. Furthermore, we predict that external pressure and electric
fields can control the TBOD of MOFs, expanding our understanding of their
thermal stability. This work identifies structural genes associated with the
melt stability of MOFs,and contributes valuable insights into the prediction
and understanding of MOF glass-forming ability.

<h3>Probability Conservation and Localization in a One-Dimensional  Non-Hermitian System</h3>

We consider transport through a non-Hermitian conductor connected to a pair
of Hermitian leads and analyze the underlying non-Hermitian scattering problem.
In a typical non-Hermitian system, such as a Hatano--Nelson-type asymmetric
hopping model, the continuity of probability and probability current is broken
at a local level. As a result, the notion of transmission and reflection
probabilities becomes ill-defined. Instead of these probabilities, we introduce
the injection rate $R_{\rm I}=1-|{\cal R}|^2$ and the transmission rate $R_{\rm
T}=|{\cal T}|^2$ as relevant physical quantities, where ${\cal T}$ and ${\cal
R}$ are the transmission and reflection amplitudes, respectively. In a generic
non-Hermitian case, $R_{\rm I}$ and $R_{\rm T}$ have independent information.
We provide a modified continuity equation in terms of incoming and outgoing
currents, from which we derive a global probability conservation law that
relates $R_{\rm I}$ and $R_{\rm T}$. We have tested the usefulness of our
probability conservation law in the interpretation of numerical results for
non-Hermitian localization and delocalization phenomena.

<h3>Spin-orbit enabled unconventional Stoner magnetism</h3>

The Stoner instability remains a cornerstone for understanding metallic
ferromagnets. This magnetic instability captures the interplay of Coulomb
repulsion, Pauli exclusion, and two-fold fermionic spin degeneracy. In
materials with spin-orbit coupling, fermionic spin is generalized to a two-fold
degenerate pseudospin. Here we identify a new fermionic pseudospin with a
symmetry that does not allow it to couple to a Zeeman field. This spinless
pseudospin exists in five non-symmorphic space groups and appears at the
Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary. In the presence of Coulomb repulsion, this
spinless pseudopsin gives rise to metallic Stoner instabilities into magnetic
states that are not usual ferromagnets. While these spinless pseudopsin
ferromagnets break time-reversal symmetry, they have a vanishing magnetization
and are generally non-collinear. The non-collinear magnetization enables a
scalar spin chirality driven Berry curvature. In addition, much like
altermagnets, these pseudospin ferromagnets exhibit energy band spin-splittings
that vanish by symmetry along lines in the BZ, allowing for drumhead surfaces
states. We further discuss candidate materials.

One of the central problems in epigenetics is how epigenetic modification
patterns and chromatin structure are regulated in the cell nucleus. The polymer
Potts model, a recently studied model of chromatins, is introduced with an
offset in the interaction energy as a parameter, and the equilibrium properties
are investigated using the mean-field analysis of the lattice model and
molecular dynamics simulations of the off-lattice model. The results show that
in common with both models, a phase emerges, which could be called the
compact-disordered phase, in which the polymer conformation is compact and the
epigenetic modification pattern is disordered, depending on the offset in the
interaction energy and the fraction of the modified nucleosomes.

<h3>Programmable Order by Disorder Effect through Quantum Simulator</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the quantum order by disorder effect of the $S=1/2$ system, which is
programmable in quantum simulator composed of Rydberg atoms in the triangular
optical lattice with a controllable diagonal anisotropy. When the total
magnetization is zero, a set of sub-extensive degenerate ground states is
present in the classical limit, composed of continuous strings whose
configuration enjoys a large degree of freedom. Among all possible
configurations, we focus on the stripe (up and down spins align straightly) and
kinked (up and down spins form a zigzag shape) patterns. Adopting the the real
space perturbation theory (RSPT), we estimate the leading order energy
correction when the nearest-neighbor ($nn$) spin-flip coupling $J$ term is
considered, and the overall model becomes an effective XXZ model with spatial
anisotropy. Our calculation demonstrates a lifting of the degeneracy, favoring
the stripe configuration. When $J$ becomes larger, we adopt the infinite
projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) and numerically check the effect of
degeneracy lifting. The iPEPS results show that even when the spin-flip
coupling term is strong the stripe pattern is still favored. While the above
system is realizable with the deformed optical lattice, at last, we numerically
calculate the hard-core bosonic Hamiltonian with the $nn$ dipole-dipole
interaction for demonstrating the possible underlying phases, using the cluster
mean-field theory. We provide various phase diagrams with different tilted
angles, showing the abundant phases including the supersolid. Our proposal
indicates a realizable scenario through quantum simulator in studying the
quantum effect as well as extraordinary phases.

cooling, an antiferromagnetic phase transition is observed at TN ~ 5.4 K.
Neutron powder diffraction revealed antiferromagnetic noncollinear order with a
commensurate propagation vector k = (1/2, 1, 0). The refined magnetic moment
size of Ni2+ at 1.5 K is 1.84{\mu}B, and its noncollinear spin texture is
confirmed by first-principles calculations. Inelastic neutron-scattering
results and density functional theory calculations confirmed the

<h3>Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing: A new approach to time-resolved  measurement of stress intensity during dynamic fracture of small brittle  specimens</h3>

<br>
<br>
The stress intensity factor is important for understanding crack initiation
and propagation. Because it cannot be measured directly, the characterization
of the stress intensity factor relies on the measurement of deformation around
a crack tip. Such measurements are challenging for dynamic fracture of brittle
materials where the deformation is small and the crack tip velocity can be high
(>1 km/s). Digital gradient sensing (DGS) is capable of full-field measurement
of surface deformation with sub-microsecond temporal resolution, but it is
limited to centimeter-scale specimens and has a spatial resolution of only
$\sim 1$mm. This limits its ability to measure deformations close to the crack
tip. Here, we demonstrate the potential of Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing
(SHWFS), as an alternative to DGS, for measuring surface deformation during
dynamic brittle fracture of millimeter-scale specimens. Using an commercial
glass ceramic as an example material, we demonstrate the capability of SHWFS to
measure the surface slope evolution induced by a propagating crack on
millimeter-scale specimens with a micrometer-scale spatial resolution and a
sub-microsecond temporal resolution. The SHWFS apparatus has the additional
advantage of being physically more compact than a typical DGS apparatus. We
verify our SHWFS measurements by comparing them with analytical predictions and
phase-field simulations of the surface slope around a crack tip. Then, fitting
the surface slope measurements to the asymptotic crack-tip field solution, we
extract the evolution of the apparent stress intensity factor associated with
the propagating crack tip. We conclude by discussing potential future
enhancements of this technique and how its compactness could enable the
integration with other characterization techniques including x-ray
phase-contrast imaging (XPCI) toward a multi-modal characterization.

Precise and reproducible current generation is key to realize quantum current
standards in metrology. A promising candidate is a tunable-barrier
single-charge pump, which can accurately transfer single charges one by one
with an error rate of less than ppm level. Although several high-accuracy
measurements have revealed such a high performance of the pumps, it is
necessary to further pursue the possibility of high-precision operation toward
reproducible generation of the pumping current in many devices. Here, we
investigate in detail a silicon single-hole pumps, which are potentially
expected to have a superior performance to single-electron pumps because of a
heavy effective mass of holes. Temperature dependence measurements of current
generated by the single-hole pump revealed a high energy selectivity of the
tunnel barrier, which is a critical parameter to achieve high-accuracy
operation. In addition, we applied the dynamic gate compensation technique to
the single-hole pump and confirm the further performance improvement.
Furthermore, we demonstrate gigahertz operation of a single-hole pump with an
estimated lower bound of an error rate of around 0.01 ppm. These results imply
a superior capability of single-hole pumps in silicon toward high-accuracy,
high-speed, and stable single-charge pumping appropriate for not only
metrological applications but also quantum device applications.

<br>
Spin nematic (SN) is a magnetic analog of classical liquid crystals, a fourth
state of matter exhibiting characteristics of both liquid and solid.
Particularly intriguing is a valence-bond SN, in which spins are quantum
entangled to form a multi-polar order without breaking time-reversal symmetry,
but its unambiguous experimental realization remains elusive. Here, we
establish a SN phase in the square-lattice iridate Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, which
approximately realizes a pseudospin one-half Heisenberg antiferromagnet (AF) in
the strong spin-orbit coupling limit. Upon cooling, the transition into the SN
phase at T$_C$ $\approx$ 263 K is marked by a divergence in the static spin
quadrupole susceptibility extracted from our Raman spectra, and concomitant
emergence of a collective mode associated with the spontaneous breaking of
rotational symmetries. The quadrupolar order persists in the antiferromagnetic
(AF) phase below T$_N$ $\approx$ 230 K, and becomes directly observable through
its interference with the AF order in resonant x-ray diffraction, which allows
us to uniquely determine its spatial structure. Further, we find using resonant
inelastic x-ray scattering a complete breakdown of coherent magnon excitations
at short-wavelength scales, suggesting a resonating-valence-bond-like quantum
entanglement in the AF state. Taken together, our results reveal a quantum
order underlying the N\'eel AF that is widely believed to be intimately
connected to the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity (HTSC).

While advancing a physics-based comprehensive photodetector-simulation model,
we propose a novel device design of the mid-wavelength infrared nBn
photodetectors by exploiting the inherit flexibility of the $InAs_{1-x}Sb_{x}$
ternary alloy material system. To further explicate the physics of such
photodetectors, we calculate several crucial transport and optoelectronic
parameters, including the dark current density, absorption coefficient,
responsivity, and the quantum efficiency of nBn photodetectors. A remarkable
maximum efficiency of 57.39\% is achieved at room temperature at a bias of
-0.25 V, coupled with a radiation power density of 50 mW/$cm^{2}$. The proposed
structure features a maximum quantum efficiency of 44.18\% and 37.87\% at 60\%
and 70\% of the $\lambda_c$, respectively. Furthermore, a maximum responsivity
of 0.9257 A/W is shown within the mid-wavelength infrared spectrum. Through our
comprehensive analysis, we also demonstrate that our proposed device design
effectively reduces the dark current density by confining the electric field
inside the barrier while preserving a superior level of quantum efficiency, and
the current in such detectors is diffusion-limited. Insights uncovered here
could be of broad interest to critically evaluate the potential of the nBn
structures for mid-wavelength infrared photodetectors.

<br>
<br>
The microscopic arrangement of atoms and molecules is the determining factor
in how materials behave and perform. Beyond the long-range periodicity, the
local disorder with local structures deviating from the average lattice
structure plays a vital role in determining the physical properties of the
phonon, electron and spin subsystems in crystalline functional materials.
Experimentally characterizing the 3D atomic configuration of such local
disorder and correlating it with the advanced functions remain a big challenge.
Time-domain evolution of the local disorder, either static or dynamical, is
lost due to the characterization at equilibrium state with conventional probing
techniques. With the combination of femtosecond electron diffraction, structure
factor calculation and TDDFT-MD simulation, we exclusively identify the static
local disorder and the local anharmonicity of it in thermoelectric SnSe. The
ultrafast structural dynamics in time domain reveal a dominant static
off-symmetry displacement of Sn (~0.4 angstrom) and the anharmonicity of this
local disorder induces an ultrafast atomic displacement within 100 fs after
photoexcitation. The microscopic picture of the local anharmonicity indicates a
direct and first signature of the THz Einstein oscillators in real space.
Therefore, a glass-like thermal transport channel with the local disorder, the
Einstein oscillators and the local anharmonicity, updates the fundamental
insight into the long-debated ultralow thermal conductivity in SnSe. The local
disorder over one to a few unit cells is pervasive and indispensable in
thermoelectric materials, multiferroic materials and correlated electronic
materials. Our method of revealing the 3D local disorder and the local
correlated interactions by ultrafast structural dynamics will inspire broad
interest in construction of the structure-property relationship in material
science.

(CoCuNiFeZn)$_{1-x}$Ga$_x$WO$_4$ through standard solid-state route followed by
spark plasma sintering (SPS) and their structural, microstructural, and
thermoelectric properties are investigated. X-ray diffraction pattern followed
by pattern matching refinement shows monoclinic structure with volume of the
unit cell decreasing with increasing Ga content. The optical band gap for these
oxides shows a cocktail effect in high entropy configuration. The Seebeck
coefficient indicates electrons as dominating charge carriers with a
non-degenerate behavior. The electrical resistivity decreases with increasing
temperature depicting a semiconducting nature. Thermal conductivity in
high-entropy samples ($\kappa\sim$2.1 W/mK @ 300\,K) is significantly lower as
compared to MgWO$_4$ ($\kappa\sim$11.5 W/mK @ 300\,K), which can be explained
by the strong phonon scattering due to large lattice disorder in high entropy
configuration. The thermoelectric figure of merit zT increases with Ga doping
via modifying all three thermoelectric parameters positively.

Using a first principles approach, we studied the hydrogen evolution reaction
activity of newly synthesized biphenylene and B, N, P decorated biphenylene
sheet. hydrogen evolution reaction activity of pristine biphenylene sheet is
not encouraging, as it is similar to pristine graphene. The Gibbs free energy
and overpotential of P(N) doped on biphenylene sheet are 0.022 (-0.092) eV and
22 (92) mV, respectively. The reported Gibbs free energy and overpotential of
Pt are 0.9 eV and 90 mV. Hence doping of P(N) atom on top of biphenylene sheet
improves hydrogen evolution reaction activity much better (near to) Pt metal.
We analyzed the adsorption mechanism of dopants (B, N, P) and hydrogen with
Bader charge analysis and density of states analysis. P and N-decoration on
biphenylene sheet change its electronic structure so that one obtains improved
hydrogen evolution reaction activity for P and N-doped biphenylene sheet.
Furthermore, the stability of N, P decorated biphenylene at room temperature
with ab initio molecular dynamics and formation energy near that of biphenylene
indicate experimental feasibility. We have compared all our best hydrogen
evolution reaction activity results in the reaction coordinate and volcano
plots of pristine, B, N, and P-doped BPh sheets. They indicate that P-doped
biphenylene is a metal-free, powerful catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction
activities.

and specific heat indicate weakly interacting effective spin-1/2 moments below
10~K, with a Curie-Weiss temperature of only 15~mK, that can be polarized by
magnetic fields of order 1~T. For the ADR performance test, we start the
demagnetization from 5~T at a temperature of $\sim 2$~K and reach a minimum
temperature of 150~mK at zero field. The warming curve indicates a sharp
magnetic transition in the heat capacity at 210~mK, implying only weak magnetic
frustration. The entropy density of $S_{\rm GS}\simeq 101$ mJ K$

minimal temperature is higher compared to frustrated Ytterbium-oxide ADR

($\Delta$) in these systems. We carry out the cluster and DFT+DMFT simulations
of the RIXS signal at the Ni $L$-edge for different values of Hund's coupling.
We find the latter dominates for the parent compound while the former becomes
important for sufficiently large doping. Our results are consistent with the
observations of a softening of a RIXS peak as a function of doping by Rossi
{\sl et al.}~\cite{PhysRevB.104.L220505}, only when the Hund coupling is
sizeable. To interpret the results, we separate the theoretical RIXS signal
into spin conserving and non-spin conserving channels and conclude that the
infinite layer nickelates are in a regime where $\Delta$ and $J$ compete
effectively and suggest further experimental tests of the theory.

Understanding the pathways to crystallization during the deposition of a
vapor phase on a cold solid substrate is of great interest in industry, e.g.,
for the realization of electronic devices made of crystallites-free glassy
materials, as well as in the atmospheric science in relation to ice nucleation
and growth in clouds. Here we numerically investigate the nucleation process
during the deposition of a glassformer by using a Lennard-Jones mixture, and
compare the properties of this nucleation process with both its quenched
counterpart and the bulk system. We find that all three systems homogeneously
nucleate crystals in a narrow range of temperatures. However, the deposited
layer shows a peculiar formation of ordered domains, promoted by the faster
relaxation dynamics toward the free surface even in an as-deposited state. In
contrast, the formation of such domains in the other systems occurs only when
the structures are fully relaxed by quenching. Furthermore, the nucleus
initially grows in an isotropic symmetrical manner, but eventually shows sub-3D
growth due to its preference to grow along the basal plane, irrespective of the
layer production procedure.

<h3>Initial perturbations dependence of non-equilibrium continuous and  discontinuous pattern transition</h3>

A phase separation in a spatially heterogeneous environment is closely
related to intracellular science and material science. For the phase
separation, initial heterogeneous perturbations play an important role in
pattern formations. In this study, a pattern transition from a lamellar pattern
to a columnar pattern is investigated in the presence of a slit pattern as the
initial perturbations. Here it is found that the transition behavior depends on
the initial slit width. When the initial slit width is close to the width of
the columnar pattern at the steady state, the pattern transition is the
second-order-like (continuous) transition. Meanwhile, the pattern transition
becomes the first-order-like (discontinuous) transition if the width of the
initial slit is much larger than that at the steady state. Then those
transition behaviors can be explained by the dynamical path during the pattern
formation. This finding will advance understanding of the initial perturbation
dependence of nonequilibrium phenomena.

We have shown in a recent contribution [J. Phys. Chem.B 127, 7983-7987
(2023)] that for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of isotropic fluids based
on orthorhombic periodic boundary conditions with "magic" box length ratios of
$L_z/L_x\!=\!L_z/L_y\!=\!2.7933596497$, the computed self-diffusion
coefficients $D_x$ and $D_y$ in $x$- and $y$-direction become system size
independent. They thus represent the true self-diffusion coefficient
$D_0\!=\!(D_x+D_y)/2$, while the shear viscosity can be determined from
diffusion coefficients in $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-direction, using the expression
$\eta\!=\!k_\mathrm{B}T\cdot 8.1711245653/[3\pi L_z(D_{x}+D_{y}-2D_z)]$. Here
we present a more generalized version of this "OrthoBoXY"-approach, which can
be applied to any orthorhombic MD box. We would like to test, whether it is
possible to improve the efficiency of the approach by using a shape more akin
to the cubic form, albeit with different box-length ratios $L_x/L_z\!\neq\!
L_y/L_z$ and $L_x\!<\!L_y\!<\!L_z$. We use simulations of systems of 1536
TIP4P/2005 water molecules as a benchmark and explore different box-geometries
to determine the influence of the box shape on the computed statistical
uncertainties for $D_0$ and $\eta$. Moreover, another "magical" set of
box-length ratios is discovered with $L_y/L_z\!=\!0.57804765578$ and
$L_x/L_z\!=\!0.33413909235$, where the self-diffusion coefficient in
$x$-direction becomes system size independent, such that $D_0\!=\!D_x$.

Ferroelectric quantum spin Hall insulator (FEQSHI) exhibits coexisting
ferroelectricity and time-reversal symmetry protected edge states, holding
fascinating prospects for inviting both scientific and application advances,
especially in two dimensions. However, all of the previously demonstrated
FEQSHIs consist two or more constituent elements. We herein propose the
$\psi$-bismuthene, an uncharted allotrope of bilayer Bi (110), to be the first
example of 2D elemental FEQSHI. It is demonstrated that $\psi$-bismuthene
harbors measurable ferroelectric polarization and nontrivial band gap with
moderate switching barrier, which are highly beneficial for the detection and
observation of the ferroelectric topologically insulating states. In addition,
all-angle auxetic behavior with giant negative Poisson's ratio and
ferroelectric controllable persistent spin helix in $\psi$-bismuthene are also
discussed. The emergent elemental FEQSHI represents a novel domain for both
fundamental physics and technological innovation.

The recently reported Bilinear Magnetoeletric Resistance (BMR) in novel
materials with rich spin textures, such as bismuth selenide (Bi$_2$Se$_3$) and
tungsten ditelluride (WTe$_2$), opens new possibilities for probing the spin
textures via magneto-transport measurements. By its nature, the BMR effect is
directly linked to the crystal symmetry of the materials and its spin texture.
Therefore, understanding the crystallographic dependency of the effect is
crucial. Here we report the observation of crystallographic-dependent BMR in
thin WTe$_2$ layers and explore how it is linked to its spin textures. The
linear response measured in first harmonic signals and the BMR measured in
second harmonic signals are both studied under a wide range of magnitudes and
directions of magnetic field, applied current and at different temperatures. We
discover a three-fold symmetry contribution of the BMR when current is applied
along the a-axis of the WTe$_2$ thin layer at 10 K, which is absent for when
current is applied along the b-axis.

<h3>Elementary Building Blocks for Cluster Mott Insulators</h3>

Mott insulators, in which strong Coulomb interactions fully localize
electrons on single atomic sites, play host to an incredibly rich and exciting
array of strongly correlated physics. One can naturally extend this concept to
cluster Mott insulators, wherein electrons localize not on single atoms but
across clusters of atoms, forming ``molecules in solids''. The resulting
localized degrees of freedom incorporate the full spectrum of electronic
degrees of freedom, spin, orbital, and charge. These serve as the building
blocks for cluster Mott insulators, and understanding them is an important
first step toward understanding the many-body physics that emerges in candidate
cluster Mott insulators. Here, we focus on elementary building blocks,
neglecting some of the complexity present in real materials which can often
obfuscate the underlying principles at play. Through an extensive set of exact
theoretical calculations on clusters of varying geometry, number of orbitals,
and number of electrons, we uncover some of the basic organizing principles of
cluster Mott phases, particularly when interactions dominate and negate a
simple single-particle picture. These include, for example, the identification
of an additional ``cluster Hund's rule'', of cluster ground states that are
best understood from a purely interacting perspective, and of several localized
degrees of freedom which are protected by an unusual combination of discrete
spatial or orbital symmetries. Finally, we discuss the impact of adding
additional terms, relevant to material candidates, on the phase diagrams
presented throughout, as well as the potential next steps in the journey to
building a more complete picture of cluster Mott insulators.

<h3>Possible Realization of Kitaev Spin Liquids in van der Waals  Heterostructures of $α$-RuCl$_3$ and Cr$X_3$ ($X$=Cl and I)</h3>

<br>
<br>
Despite the presence of the exact solution and well-established recipe for
its realization, the quest for the Kitaev spin liquid in real materials remains
exceptionally challenging. Among many magnets, $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ emerges as a
prime candidate, albeit the hallmarks of the spin liquid manifest only within
the specific region where the zigzag-type antiferromagnetic order is suppressed
by an applied magnetic field. Here, we propose the possibility of the Kitaev
spin liquid at zero field by making van der Waals heterostructures of
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and a ferromagnet Cr$X_3$ ($X$=Cl and I). Using {\it ab
initio} calculations, we find that in the case of $X$=Cl the zigzag order is
suppressed by the proximity effect of the ferromagnetic CrCl$_3$ layer, while
the Kitaev interaction is still relevant in the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ layer.
Notably, the induced Ru moment is close to the value observed in the spin
liquid region of the bulk material, signifying the realization of the Kitaev
spin liquid at zero field. In contrast, in the case of $X$=I, the system is on
the verge of an insulator-metal transition by carrier doping through interlayer
hybridization. Our results indicate that van der Waals heterostructures provide
a new platform for studying not only magnetic but also electronic properties of
the Kitaev magnets.

Chirality of massless fermions emergent in condensed matter is a key to
understand their characteristic behavior as well as to exploit their
functionality. However, chiral nature of massless fermions in Dirac semimetals
has remained elusive, due to equivalent occupation of carriers with the
opposite chirality in thermal equilibrium. Here, we show that the isospin
degree of freedom, which labels the chirality of massless carriers from a
crystallographic point of view, can be injected by circularly polarized light.
Terahertz Faraday rotation spectroscopy successfully detects the anomalous Hall
conductivity by a light-induced isospin polarization in a three-dimensional
Dirac semimetal, Cd$_3$As$_2$. Spectral analysis of the Hall conductivity
reveals a long scattering time and a long decay time, which are characteristic
of the isospin. The long-lived, robust, and reversible character of the isospin
promises potential application of Dirac semimetals in future information
technology.

means of synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction, x-ray absorption spectroscopy,
and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism at the Co and Ir $L_{2,3}$ edges,
magnetometry, and electrical transport. Our results indicate a configuration of
nearly Co$^{2+}$/Ir$^{5+}$ configuration for the transition-metal ions, with
spin canting within the Co antiferromagnetic superstructure responsible for the
ferromagnetic-like behavior observed below 100 K. The highly insulating
character of LaCaCoIrO$_6$ and its positive magnetoresistance further suggest
that this antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction occurs through an
indirect hybridization between the Co $e_g$ orbitals

<br>
<i>Harsh Jain, Shankar Ghosh</i>
<br>
<br>
We present emergent mechanical memory storage behavior in soft cellular
materials. The cellular materials are a network of soft hyperelastic rods which
store shape changes, specifically local indentation. This happens under an
applied global compressive strain on the material. The material transits under
strain from an elastic state (capable of `forgetting' any applied indentation
after un-indentation) to plastic state (indefinitely storing the shape change
due to indentation). The memory can be erased via removal of applied global
strains and is therefore re-programmable. We characterise this behaviour
experimentally and present a simple model that makes use of friction for
understanding this behavior.

Crystallization of the amorphous phases into metastable crystals plays a
fundamental role in the formation of new matter, from geological to biological
processes in nature to synthesis and development of new materials in the
laboratory. Predicting the outcome of such phase transitions reliably would
enable new research directions in these areas, but has remained beyond reach
with molecular modeling or ab-initio methods. Here, we show that
crystallization products of amorphous phases can be predicted in any inorganic
chemistry by sampling the crystallization pathways of their local structural
motifs at the atomistic level using universal deep learning potentials. We show
that this approach identifies the crystal structures of polymorphs that
initially nucleate from amorphous precursors with high accuracy across a
diverse set of material systems, including polymorphic oxides, nitrides,
carbides, fluorides, chlorides, chalcogenides, and metal alloys. Our results
demonstrate that Ostwald's rule of stages can be exploited mechanistically at
the molecular level to predictably access new metastable crystals from the
amorphous phase in material synthesis.

<h3>Fitting an ellipsoid to random points: predictions using the replica  method</h3>

<i>Antoine Maillard, Dmitriy Kunisky</i>
<br>

We consider the problem of fitting a centered ellipsoid to $n$ standard
Gaussian random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$, as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n/d^2 \to
\alpha > 0$. It has been conjectured that this problem is, with high
probability, satisfiable (SAT; that is, there exists an ellipsoid passing
through all $n$ points) for $\alpha < 1/4$, and unsatisfiable (UNSAT) for
$\alpha > 1/4$. In this work we give a precise analytical argument, based on
the non-rigorous replica method of statistical physics, that indeed predicts a
SAT/UNSAT transition at $\alpha = 1/4$, as well as the shape of a typical
fitting ellipsoid in the SAT phase (i.e., the lengths of its principal axes).
Besides the replica method, our main tool is the dilute limit of extensive-rank
"HCIZ integrals" of random matrix theory. We further study different explicit
algorithmic constructions of the matrix characterizing the ellipsoid. In
particular, we show that a procedure based on minimizing its nuclear norm
yields a solution in the whole SAT phase. Finally, we characterize the
SAT/UNSAT transition for ellipsoid fitting of a large class of
rotationally-invariant random vectors. Our work suggests mathematically
rigorous ways to analyze fitting ellipsoids to random vectors, which is the
topic of a companion work.

Background: The introduction of magnetic resonance (MR)-guided radiation
treatment planning has opened a new space for theranostic nanoparticles to
reduce acute toxicity while improving local control. In this work,
second-generation AGuIX nanoparticles (AGuIX-Bi) are synthesized and validated.
AGuIX-Bi are shown to maintain MR positive contrast while further amplifying
the radiation dose by the replacement of some Gd$^{3+}$ cations with higher Z
Bi$^{3+}$. These next-generation nanoparticles are based on the AGuIX platform,
which is currently being evaluated in multiple Phase II clinical trials in
combination with radiotherapy. Methods: In this clinically scalable
methodology, AGuIX is used as an initial chelation platform to exchange
Gd$^{3+}$ for Bi$^{3+}$. AGuIX-Bi nanoparticles are synthesized with three
ratios of Gd/Bi, each maintaining MR contrast while further amplifying
radiation dose relative to Bi$^{3+}$. Safety, efficacy, and theranostic
potential of the nanoparticles were evaluated in vitro and in vivo in a human
non-small cell lung cancer model. Results: We demonstrated that increasing
Bi$^{3+}$ in the nanoparticles is associated with more DNA damage and improves
in vivo efficacy with a statistically significant delay in tumor growth and 33%
complete regression for the largest Bi/Gd ratio tested. The addition of
Bi$^{3+}$ by our synthetic method leads to nanoparticles that present slightly
altered pharmacokinetics and lengthening of the period of high tumor
accumulation with no observed evidence of toxicity. Conclusions: We confirmed
the safety and enhanced efficacy of AGuIX-Bi with radiation therapy at the
selected ratio of 30Gd/70Bi. These results provide crucial evidence towards
patient translation.

<br>
<br>
Two dimensional moir\'e systems have recently emerged as a platform in which
the interplay between topology and strong correlations of electrons play out in
non-trivial ways. Among these systems, twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG)
is of particular interest as its topological properties may be tuned via both
twist angle and applied perpendicular electric field. In this system, energy
gaps are observed at half filling of particular bands, which can be associated
with correlated spin polarized states. In this work, we investigate the fate of
these states as the system is doped away from this filling. We demonstrate
that, for a broad range of fractional fillings, the resulting ground state is
partially valley polarized, and supports multiple broken symmetries, including
a textured spin order indicative of skyrmions, with a novel $\textit{stripe}$
ordering that spontaneously breaks $C_3$ symmetry. Experimental signatures of
this state are discussed.

<i>Gabriele Riva, Pina Romaniello, J. Arjan Berger</i>
<br>
<br>
We present the multi-channel Dyson equation that combines two or more
many-body Green's functions to describe the electronic structure of materials.
In this work we use it to model photoemission spectra by coupling the one-body
Green's function with the three-body Green's function. We demonstrate that,
unlike methods using only the one-body Green's function, our approach puts the
description of quasiparticles and satellites on an equal footing. We propose a
multi-channel self-energy that is static and only contains the bare Coulomb
interaction, making frequency convolutions and self-consistency unnecessary.
Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate with a diagrammatic analysis that the
physics it describes is extremely rich. Finally, we present a framework based
on an effective Hamiltonian that can be solved for any many-body system using
standard numerical tools. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the
Hubbard dimer and show that it is exact both at 1/4 and 1/2 filling.

<br>
<br>
Nickel-based superalloys are important materials for high temperature
applications. Nanoscale precipitates in their microstructure hinder dislocation
motion, which results in an extraordinary strengthening effect at elevated
temperatures. In the present work, we study the deformation behaviour of these
materials using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using classical effective
potentials. In our simulations, we observed the movement of an
$\frac{a}{2}\langle110\rangle\{111\}$ edge dislocation under shear in pure Ni,
which is used to model the Ni solid solution matrix, and extracted the
locations of the dislocations. We show how a Differential Evolution Monte Carlo
(DE-MC) analysis is an effective way to find the parameters of an equation of
motion for the dislocation lines with quantified uncertainties. The parameters
of interest were the effective mass, drag coefficient, and force experienced by
the dislocation. The marginal parameter and joint posterior distributions were
estimated from the accepted samples produced by the DE-MC algorithm. The
equation of motion and parameter distributions were used to predict the
dislocation positions and velocities at the simulation timesteps, and the mean
fit was found to match the MD trajectories with an RMSE of 0.13 nm. We also
discuss how the selected model can be extended to account for the presence of
multiple dislocations as well as dislocation-precipitate interactions. This
work serves as the first step towards building a predictive surrogate model
that describes the deformation behaviour of Ni-based superalloys.

Despite the common expectation that conjugated organic molecules on metals
tend to adsorb in a flat-lying wetting layer, several recent studies have found
strong indications for coverage-dependent transitions to upright-standing
phases, which exhibit notably different physical properties. In this work, we
argue that from an energetic perspective, thermodynamically stable
upright-standing phases may be more common than hitherto thought. However, for
kinetic reasons this phase may often not be observed experimentally. Indeed,
using first principles kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the
structure with lower molecular density is (almost) always formed first,
reminiscent of Ostwalds rule of stages. The phase transitions to the
thermodynamically stable upright-standing phase are likely to be kinetically
hindered under conditions typically used in surface science (gas phase
adsorption at low flux). This provides a possible explanation why they are
commonly not observed. Investigating both the role of the growth conditions and
the energetics of the interface, we find that the time for the phase transition
is determined mostly by the deposition rate and, thus, mostly independent of
the nature of the molecule.

In this study, the effects of sulfur substitution on the structural,
mechanical, electronic, optical, and thermodynamic properties of RbTaO3-xSx
have been investigated using the WIEN2k code in the framework of density
functional theory (DFT). The cubic phase of RbTaO3 transforms to tetragonal for
RbTaO2S and RbTaOS2, the later transforms again to a cubic phase with added
sulfur for RbTaS3. The results showed that substituting S for O anions in
RbTaO3 effectively decreased the band gap from 2.717 eV to 1.438 eV, 0.286 eV,
and 0.103 eV for the RbTaO3,RbTaO2S, RbTaOS2, and RbTaS3 compounds,
respectively. The optical constants such as dielectric constants, refractive
index, absorption coefficient, photoconductivity, reflectivity and loss
function have been calculated and analyzed. The elastic constants and moduli,
and their anisotropic nature were also investigated. Finally, the Debye
temperature, thermal conductivity, melting temperature, specific capacities and
thermal expansion coefficients were computed and analyzed using established
formalisms. The reduced band gap (1.438 eV) and high absorption coefficient
(~106 cm-1) of RbTaO2S makes it suitable for solar cell applications and for
other visible light devices. Reduction of the band gap and phonon thermal
conductivity owing to Ssubstitution is expected to enhance thermoelectric
performances of the S-containing phases

We propose a simple and efficient method to calculate the electronic
self-energy in dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), addressing a numerical
instability often encountered when solving the Dyson equation. Our approach
formulates the Dyson equation as a constrained optimization problem with a
simple quadratic objective. The constraints on the self-energy are obtained via
direct measurement of the leading order terms of its asymptotic expansion
within a continuous time quantum Monte Carlo framework, and the use of the
compact discrete Lehmann representation of the self-energy yields an
optimization problem in a modest number of unknowns. We benchmark our method
for the non-interacting Bethe lattice, as well as DMFT calculations for both
model systems and \textit{ab-initio} applications.

The present work reviews the charge compensation in Ni based layered oxides
(LiNi1-xMexO2 with x <= 0.2, Me = Co, Mn, space group R-3m) relating
performance parameters to changes in the electronic and crystallographic
structure of the cathode materials. Upon charge and discharge two fundamentally
different redox mechanisms are observed: At low and medium states of charge
(SOCs) charge compensation takes mainly place at oxygen sites while electron
density is shifted from the oxygen lattice to nickel (formation of sigma
bonds). At high SOCs the shift of electron density from the transition metals
to oxygen (formation of pi bonds) enables an additional redox process but also
oxygen release from the transition metal host structure and subsequent
detrimental reactions. Depending on the Ni:Co:Mn content, both processes lead
to characteristic features in the voltage profile of the cathode materials and
performance parameters like the capacity, the cycling stability and the open
cell voltage become a function of the composition.

We consider a one-dimensional topological superconductor hosting Majorana
bound states at its ends coupled to a single mode cavity. In the strong
light-matter coupling regime, electronic and photonic degrees of freedom
hybridize resulting in the formation of polaritons. We find the polariton
spectrum by calculating the cavity photon spectral function of the coupled
electron-photon system. In the topological phase the lower in energy polariton
modes are formed by the bulk-Majorana transitions coupled to cavity photons and
are also sensitive to the Majorana parity. In the trivial phase the lower
polariton modes emerge due to the coupling of the bulk-bulk transitions across
the gap to photons. Our work demonstrates the formation of polaritons in
topological superconductors coupled to photons that contain information on the
features of the Majorana bound states.

Irradiation-induced ductility loss is a major concern facing structural
steels in next-generation nuclear reactors. Currently, the mechanisms for this
are unclear but crucial to address for the design of reactor components. Here,
the deformation characteristics around nanoindents in Fe and Fe10Cr irradiated
with Fe ions to $\sim$1 displacement-per-atom at 313 K are non-destructively
studied. Deformation localisation in the irradiated materials is evident from
the increased pile-up height and slip step formation, measured by atomic force
microscopy. From 3D X-ray Laue diffraction, measurements of lattice rotation
and strain fields near the indent site show a large confinement, over 85%, of
plasticity in the irradiated material. We find that despite causing increased
irradiation hardening, Cr content has little effect on the irradiation-induced
changes in pile-up topography and deformation fields. The results demonstrate
that varying Cr content in steels has limited impact on retaining strain
hardening capacity and reducing irradiation-induced embrittlement.

<h3>Optical conductivity and damping of plasmons due to electron-electron  interaction</h3>

We re-visit the issue of plasmon damping due to electron-electron
interaction. The plasmon linewidth can related to the imaginary part of the
charge susceptibility or, equivalently, to the real part of the optical
conductivity, $\mathrm{Re}\sigma(q,\omega)$. Approaching the problem first via
a standard semi-classical Boltzmann equation, we show that
$\mathrm{Re}\sigma(q,\omega)$ of two-dimensional (2D) electron gas scales as
$q^2T^2/\omega^4$ for $\omega\ll T$, which agrees with the results of Refs. [1]
and [2] but disagrees with that of Ref. [3], according to which
$\mathrm{Re}\sigma(q,\omega) \propto q^2T^2/\omega^2$. To resolve this
disagreement, we re-derive $\mathrm{Re}\sigma(q,\omega)$ using the original
method of Ref. {mishchenko:2004} for an arbitrary ratio $\omega/T$ and show
that, while the last term is, indeed, present, it is subleading to the
$q^2T^2/\omega^4$ term. We give a physical interpretation of both leading and
subleading contributions in terms of the shear and bulk viscosities of an
electron liquid, respectively. We also calculate $\mathrm{Re}\sigma(q,\omega)$
for a three-dimensional (3D) electron gas and doped monolayer graphene. We find
that, with all other parameters being equal, finite temperature has the
strongest effect on the plasmon linewidth in graphene, where it scales as
$T^4\ln T$ for $\omega\ll T$.

<h3>A peridynamic-informed deep learning model for brittle damage prediction</h3>

In this study, a novel approach that combines the principles of peridynamic
(PD) theory with PINN is presented to predict quasi-static damage and crack
propagation in brittle materials. To achieve high prediction accuracy and
convergence rate, the linearized PD governing equation is enforced in the
PINN's residual-based loss function. The proposed PD-INN is able to learn and
capture intricate displacement patterns associated with different geometrical
parameters, such as pre-crack position and length. Several enhancements like
cyclical annealing schedule and deformation gradient aware optimization
technique are proposed to ensure the model would not get stuck in its trivial
solution. The model's performance assessment is conducted by monitoring the
behavior of loss function throughout the training process. The PD-INN
predictions are also validated through several benchmark cases with the results
obtained from high-fidelity techniques such as PD direct numerical method and
Extended-Finite Element Method. Our results show the ability of the nonlocal
PD-INN to predict damage and crack propagation accurately and efficiently.

<h3>A comprehensive exploration of structural and electronic properties of  Molybdenum clusters</h3>

Molybdenum clusters, characterised by their unique structure and intriguing
catalytic properties, have gained significant attention in recent years. In
several existing studies density functional theory (DFT) methods have been used
to find the lowest energy Mo clusters and explore their electronic and magnetic
structure. In all cases, with the exception of a single recent study, where a
genetic algorithm was employed, initial geometries of the clusters, prior to
geometry optimisation, were chosen using heuristic approaches based on symmetry
considerations and known structures. DFT calculations were performed using
different types of pseudopotentials, from hard to soft, and different types of
basis sets. However, no comprehensive study has yet been done in which a DFT
method with the best control on its precision would be complemented by a
reliable global minimum search method to find the lowest energy Mo clusters. In
this work, we employ a combination of a plane wave-based DFT method and
\emph{ab initio} random structure searching (AIRSS) technique to find the
lowest energy clusters of up to 10 Mo atoms. In each case, the search has been
performed for clusters with different spin multiplicities, which enabled us to
explore their magnetic structure. The results are compared for both hard and
soft pseudopotentials stressing the importance of treating more electrons
explicitly, in agreement with some of the previous studies. For most of the
low-energy magnetic structures found, we investigate the distribution of their
spin densities, and for all low energy clusters, we confirm their stability by
calculating their phonon structure. Finally, free energies of the Mo clusters,
within the quasi-harmonic approximation, are also calculated and discussed.

<h3>SpinPSO: An agent-based optimization workflow for identifying global  noncollinear magnetic ground-states from first-principles</h3>

We propose and implement a novel hybrid meta-heuristic optimization algorithm
for the identification of non-collinear global ground-states in magnetic
systems. The inputs to this optimization scheme are directly from non-collinear
density functional theory (DFT), and the workflow is implemented in the atomate
code framework, making it suitable to run on high-performance computing
architectures. The hybrid algorithm provides a seamless theoretical extension
of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms to continuous $\mathcal S^2$
spins, giving it the name SpinPSO. The hybrid nature of the algorithm stems
from setting the dynamics of individual spins to be governed by physically
motivated atomistic spin dynamics. Using this algorithm, we are able to achieve
convergence to experimentally resolved magnetic ground-states for a set of
diverse test case materials that exhibit exotic spin textures.

<h3>Exact Ground States and Phase Diagram of the Quantum Compass Model under  an in-plane Field</h3>

We consider the square lattice $S$=1/2 quantum compass model (QCM)
parameterized by $J_x, J_z$, under a field, $\mathbf{h}$, in the $x$-$z$ plane.
At the special field value, $(h_x^\star,h_z^\star)$=$2S(J_x,J_z)$, we show that
the QCM Hamiltonian may be written in a form such that two simple product
states can be identified as exact ground-states, below a gap. Exact excited
states can also be found. The exact product states are characterized by a
staggered vector chirality, attaining a non-zero value in the surrounding
phase. The resulting gapped phase, which we denote by ($SVC$) occupies most of
the in-plane field phase diagram. For some values of $h_x>h_z$ and $h_z>h_x$ at
the edges of the phase diagram, we have found transitions between the $SVC$
phase and phases of weakly-coupled Ising-chain states, $Z$ and $X$. In zero
field, the QCM is known to have an emergent sub-extensive ground-state
degeneracy. As the field is increased from zero, we find that this degeneracy
is partially lifted, resulting in bond-oriented spin-stripe states, $L$ and
$R$, which are each separated from one another and the $SVC$ phase by
first-order transitions. Our findings are important for understanding the field
dependent phase diagram of materials with predominantly directionally-dependent
Ising interactions.

<h3>Cartan media: geometric continuum mechanics in homogeneous spaces</h3>

We present a geometric formulation of the mechanics of a field that takes
values in a homogeneous space \mathbb{X} on which a Lie group G acts
transitively. This generalises the mechanics of Cosserat media where \mathbb{X}
is the frame bundle of Euclidean space and G is the special Euclidean group.
Kinematics is described by a map from a space-time manifold to the homogeneous
space. This map is characterised locally by generalised strains (representing
spatial deformations) and generalised velocities (representing temporal
motions). These are, respectively, the spatial and temporal components of the
Maurer-Cartan one-form in the Lie algebra of G. Cartan's equation of structure
provides the fundamental kinematic relationship between generalised strains and
velocities. Dynamics is derived from a Lagrange-d'Alembert principle in which
generalised stresses and momenta, taking values in the dual Lie algebra of G,
are paired, respectively, with generalised strains and velocities. For
conservative systems, the dynamics can be expressed completely through a
generalised Euler-Poincare action principle. The geometric formulation leads to
accurate and efficient structure-preserving integrators for numerical
simulations. We provide an unified description of the mechanics of Cosserat
solids, surfaces and rods using our formulation. We further show that, with
suitable choices of \mathbb{X} and G, a variety of systems in soft condensed
matter physics and beyond can be understood as instances of a class of
materials we provisionally call Cartan media.
