<p>The ability to understand and ultimately control the transformations and
properties of various nanoscale systems, from proteins to synthetic
nanomaterial assemblies, hinges on the ability to directly elucidate their
dynamics on their characteristic length and time scales. Here, we use MHz X-ray
photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to directly elucidate the characteristic
microsecond-dynamics of density fluctuations of semiconductor nanocrystals
(NCs), not only in a colloidal dispersion but also in a liquid phase consisting
of densely packed, yet mobile, NCs with no long-range order. By carefully
disentangling X-ray induced effects, we find the wavevector-dependent
fluctuation rates in the liquid phase are suppressed relative to those in the
colloidal phase and to those in experiments and hydrodynamic theories of
densely packed repulsive particles. We show that the suppressed rates are due
to a substantial decrease in the self-diffusion of NCs in the liquid phase,
which we attribute to explicit attractive interactions. Via comparison with
simulations, we find that the extracted strength of the attractions explains
the stability of the liquid phase, in contrast to the gelation observed via
XPCS in many other charged colloidal systems. This work opens the door to
elucidating fast, condensed phase dynamics in a variety of complex fluids and
other nanoscale soft matter systems, such as densely packed proteins and
non-equilibrium self-assembly processes.

<h3>Physically recurrent neural network for rate and path-dependent  heterogeneous materials in a finite strain framework</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17583" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17583</a>
<br>
</p><i>M. A. Maia, I. B. C. M. Rocha, D. Kovačević, F. P. van der Meer</i>
<p>In this work, a hybrid physics-based data-driven surrogate model for the
microscale analysis of heterogeneous material is investigated. The proposed
model benefits from the physics-based knowledge contained in the constitutive
models used in the full-order micromodel by embedding them in a neural network.
Following previous developments, this paper extends the applicability of the
physically recurrent neural network (PRNN) by introducing an architecture
suitable for rate-dependent materials in a finite strain framework. In this
model, the homogenized deformation gradient of the micromodel is encoded into a
set of deformation gradients serving as input to the embedded constitutive
models. These constitutive models compute stresses, which are combined in a
decoder to predict the homogenized stress, such that the internal variables of
the history-dependent constitutive models naturally provide physics-based
memory for the network. To demonstrate the capabilities of the surrogate model,
we consider a unidirectional composite micromodel with transversely isotropic
elastic fibers and elasto-viscoplastic matrix material. The extrapolation
properties of the surrogate model trained to replace such micromodel are tested
on loading scenarios unseen during training, ranging from different
strain-rates to cyclic loading and relaxation. Speed-ups of three orders of
magnitude with respect to the runtime of the original micromodel are obtained.

</p><i>Ravi Patel, Cosmin Safta, Reese E. Jones</i>
<p>Composite materials with different microstructural material symmetries are
common in engineering applications where grain structure, alloying and
particle/fiber packing are optimized via controlled manufacturing. In fact
these microstructural tunings can be done throughout a part to achieve
functional gradation and optimization at a structural level. To predict the
performance of particular microstructural configuration and thereby overall
performance, constitutive models of materials with microstructure are needed.
In this work we provide neural network architectures that provide effective
homogenization models of materials with anisotropic components. These models
satisfy equivariance and material symmetry principles inherently through a
combination of equivariant and tensor basis operations. We demonstrate them on
datasets of stochastic volume elements with different textures and phases where
the material undergoes elastic and plastic deformation, and show that the these
network architectures provide significant performance improvements.

<p>Current condensed matter research is centered on advanced materials and their
distinctive features. The interest in Quantum materials (QMs) continues to
increase without any decrease due to their novel phenomenon and potential as
platforms for revolutionary new technologies in modern science and technology.
This article emphasizes the exploration of diverse devices and applications
facilitated by the unique properties of QMs. Encompassing fields like quantum
computing, metrology, sensing, energy, and communication, the review highlights
their transformative potential. In QMs, the emerging phenomena are governed by
quantum confinement, strong electronic correlations, topology, and symmetry,
which makes these materials apart, making them exceptional in their own regard.
This paper emphasizes their unique properties, different types of QMs, various
interdisciplinary applications, and integration with existing technologies.
This study provides a concise overview of diverse discoveries and advancements,
presenting a prospective outlook on QMs in multiple domains.

<h3>Large spontaneous valley polarization and anomalous valley Hall effect  in antiferromagnetic monolayer $\mathrm{Fe_2CF_2}$</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17596" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17596</a>
<br>
</p><i>San-Dong Guo, Liguo Zhang, Yiwen Zhang, Guangzhao Wang</i>
<p>Superior to ferromagnetic (FM) materials, antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials
do not have any net magnetic moment and are robust to external magnetic
perturbation with ultra-high dynamic speed. To achieve spontaneous valley
polarization and anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE) in AFM materials is of
great significance for potential applications in spintronics and valleytronics.
Here, we predict an A-type AFM monolayer $\mathrm{Fe_2CF_2}$ with large
spontaneous valley polarization. Monolayer $\mathrm{Fe_2CF_2}$ has zero Berry
curvature in momentum space but non-zero layer-locked hidden Berry curvature in
real space, which provides the basic conditions for the realization of AVHE.
Because $\mathrm{Fe_2CF_2}$ possesses the combined symmetry ($PT$ symmetry) of
spatial inversion ($P$) and time reversal ($T$) symmetry, the spin is
degenerate, which prevents the AVHE. An out-of-plane external electric field
can be used to produce spin splitting due to the introduction of
layer-dependent electrostatic potential, and then layer-locked AVHE can be
realized in $\mathrm{Fe_2CF_2}$. Moreover, the spin order of spin splitting can
be reversed, when the direction of electric field is reversed. It is proved
that the AVHE can be achieved in Janus $\mathrm{Fe_2CFCl}$ without external
electric field due to intrinsic built-in electric field. Our works provide an
AFM monolayer with excellent properties to realize AVHE.

<h3>Phonon-driven multipolar dynamics in spin-orbit coupled Mott insulators</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17633" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17633</a>
<br>
</p><i>Kathleen Hart, Ruairidh Sutcliffe, Gil Refael, Arun Paramekanti</i>
<p>Motivated by ongoing work on pump-probe experiments and Floquet driven
magnets, we theoretically study the impact of pumped and driven Einstein
phonons with weak dissipation in multipolar Mott insulators. For Mott
insulators with pseudospin-$1/2$ non-Kramers doublets hosting octupolar and
quadrupolar moments, we show that pumping the ${\cal E}_g$ phonon modes which
couple linearly to the quadrupoles leads to characteristic chiral phonon
dynamics below the octupolar ordering transition. We also explore steady states
in the presence of continuously driven phonons, showing that a coherent
two-phonon drive with a suitable phase choice can be used to 'train' octupolar
order or even switch its sign. For spin-$1$ magnets, which host dipolar and
quadrupolar moments, we show that one-phonon and two-phonon drives can generate
Floquet flavor-wave excitations and induce dipolar magnetization. Our results
are obtained using a generalized $SU(N)$ Monte Carlo for the multipolar degrees
of freedom with numerical integration of the coupled spin-phonon equations of
motion. Our work opens up pathways to explore phonon-driven dynamics in
multipolar magnets.

<h3>Charge density-waves with non-trivial orbital textures in rare earth  tritellurides</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17635" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17635</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sergey Alekseev, Sayed Ali Akbar Ghorashi, Rafael M. Fernandes, Jennifer Cano</i>
<p>Motivated by recent experiments reporting unconventional collective modes in
the charge density-wave (CDW) state of rare-earth tritellurides $R$Te$_3$, we
derive from a multi-orbital microscopic model on the square net a CDW
Ginzburg-Landau theory that allows for non-trivial orbital order. Our analysis
reveals unconventional CDWs where order parameters with distinct orbital
character coexist due to an approximate symmetry of the low-energy model, which
becomes exact in the limit of nearest-neighbor-only hopping and decoupled
$p_x$, $p_y$ orbitals. Because of this coexistence, the resulting CDW pattern
displays an orbital texture that generally breaks additional symmetries of the
lattice besides those explicitly broken by the CDW wave-vector. In particular,
we find two competing phases that differ in whether they break or preserve
inversion and vertical mirror symmetries. We explain the mechanisms that favor
each outcome, and discuss experimental probes that can distinguish the
different phases.

<h3>A self-consistent Hartree theory for lattice-relaxed magic-angle twisted  bilayer graphene</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17638" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17638</a>
<br>
</p><i>Mohammed M. Al Ezzi, Liangtao Peng, Zhengyu Liu, Jonah Huang Zi Chao, Gayani N. Pallewela, Darryl Foo, Shaffique Adam</i>
<p>For twisted bilayer graphene close to magic angle, we show that the effects
of lattice relaxation and the Hartree interaction both become simultaneously
important. Including both effects in a continuum theory reveals a Lifshitz
transition to a Fermi surface topology that supports both a ``heavy fermion"
pocket and an ultraflat band ($\approx 8~{\rm meV}$) that is pinned to the
Fermi energy for a large range of fillings. We provide analytical and numerical
results to understand the narrow ``magic angle range" that supports this pinned
ultraflat band and make predictions for its experimental observation. We
believe that the bands presented here are accurate at high temperature and
provide a good starting point to understand the myriad of complex behaviour
observed in this system.

<h3>Patterns of active dipolar particles in external magnetic fields</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17641" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17641</a>
<br>
</p><i>Vitali Telezki, Stefan Klumpp</i>
<p>Active particles with a (magnetic) dipole moment are of interest for steering
self-propelled motion, but also result in novel collective effects due to their
dipole-dipole interaction. Here systems of active dipolar particles are studied
with Brownian dynamics simulations to systematically characterize the different
patterns they form, specifically in the presence of an external (magnetic)
field. The combination of three types of order - clustering, orientational
alignment and chain formation - is used to classify the patterns observed in
these systems. In the presence of an external field, oriented chains and bands
are found to be dominant. These structures show some similarities with columnar
cluster seen in (passive) ferrofluids and display columnar spacing and number
of lanes per cluster that both decrease with increasing field strength.

<h3>Exact Analytical Solution of the Flory-Huggins Model and Extensions to  Multicomponent Systems</h3>

<br>
</p><i>J. Pedro de Souza, Howard A. Stone</i>
<p>The Flory-Huggins theory describes the phase separation of solutions
containing polymers. Although it finds widespread application from polymer
physics to materials science to biology, the concentrations that coexist in
separate phases at equilibrium have not been determined analytically, and
numerical techniques are required that restrict the theory's ease of
application. In this work, we derive an implicit analytical solution to the
Flory-Huggins theory of one polymer in a solvent by applying a procedure that
we call the implicit substitution method. While the solutions are implicit and
in the form of composite variables, they can be mapped explicitly to a phase
diagram in composition space. We apply the same formalism to multicomponent
polymeric systems, where we find analytical solutions for polydisperse mixtures
of polymers of one type. Finally, while complete analytical solutions are not
possible for arbitrary mixtures, we propose computationally efficient
strategies to map out coexistence curves for systems with many components of
different polymer types.

<h3>Thermodynamic Origin of Water's Thermal Conductivity Maximum</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17650" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17650</a>
<br>
</p><i>Oliver R. Gittus, Fernando Bresme</i>
<p>The thermal conductivity of water features a maximum (TCM) as a function of
temperature at constant pressure. By examining why molecular force fields
succeed or fail to reproduce the maximum and interpreting our results using the
Bridgman equation, we show that water's TCM is connected with its
compressibility minimum. Using Stillinger-Weber potentials for tetrahedral
liquids, we interpolate between the behaviour of simple liquids and highly
tetrahedral materials such as carbon. Together with two vanishing limits at
low/high tetrahedrality, we identify three regimes for the TCM: when it
originates from either the compressibility minimum or density maximum, or both.
Thus, the TCM exists in a "Goldilocks Zone" of tetrahedral order. We provide a
thermodynamic explanation for the TCM of not only water, but tetrahedral
liquids in general.

<h3>Temperature and excitation energy dependence of Raman scattering in  nodal line Dirac semimetal ZrAs_{2}</h3>

<br>
</p><i>R. Bacewicz, C. Jastrzębski, K. Zberecki, A. S. Wadge, D. Jastrzębski, A. Wiśniewski</i>
<p>We present a Raman study of ZrAs_{2} single crystals, a nodal line semimetal
with symmetry-enforced Dirac-like band crossings. We identified the symmetry of
phonon modes by polarized light measurements and comparison with calculated
phonon frequencies. Significant dependence of peak intensities on the
excitation wavelength was observed, indicating quantum interference effects.
Phonon peaks in the spectra are superimposed on the electronic background, with
quasi-elastic scattering observed for the 785 nm excitation. We identified the
Fano shape of the 171 cm^{-1} Ag mode due to interference of the phonon state
with the electronic continuum. The temperature dependence of phonon peaks
linewidth indicates that the electron-phonon coupling plays an essential role
in phonon decay.

<h3>Ideal noncrystals: A possible new class of ordered matter without  apparent broken symmetry</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17675" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17675</a>
<br>
</p><i>Xinyu Fan, Ding Xu, Jianhua Zhang, Hao Hu, Peng Tan, Ning Xu, Hajime Tanaka, Hua Tong</i>
<p>Order and disorder constitute two fundamental and opposite themes in
condensed matter physics and materials science. Crystals are considered the
epitome of order characterized by long-range translational order. The discovery
of quasicrystals, with no periodicity but rotational symmetries forbidden for
crystals, leads to a paradigm shift in solid-state physics. Moving one step
forward, it is intriguing to ask whether ordered matter exists without apparent
symmetry breaking. The same question may arise in the pursuit of how ordered
amorphous (noncrystalline) solids can be. Here we report the finding of ideal
noncrystals in two dimensions, which are disordered in the conventional sense
without Bragg peaks but highly ordered according to the steric order. We find
that such ideal noncrystals have vibrational modes the same as phonons
following the Debye law. The elastic responses are fully affine, which is again
characteristic of crystals, and the spatial fluctuations of local volume
fractions approach hyperuniformity. Therefore, ideal noncrystals represent an
anomalous form of matter with a mixed nature of noncrystalline structure but
crystal-like properties. Since such states are found to be thermodynamically
favorable, we identify them as a possible new class of ordered matter without
apparent broken symmetry. Our results thus extend the scope of the ordered
state of matter and may impact the understanding of entropy-driving ordering
also in generic amorphous materials.

<h3>Simulating Crystallization in a Colloidal System Using State Predictive  Information Bottleneck based Enhanced Sampling</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Vanessa J. Meraz, Ziyue Zou, Pratyush Tiwary</i>
<p>We investigate crystal nucleation in supersaturated colloid suspensions using
enhanced molecular dynamics simulations augmented with machine learning
techniques. The simulations reveal that crystallization in the model colloidal
system studied here, with particles interacting through a repulsive screened
Coulomb Yukawa potential, proceeds from vapor to dense liquid droplet to
crystalline phases across multiple high barriers. Employing a one-dimensional
reaction coordinate derived from the State Predictive Information Bottleneck
framework, our simulations capture backand-forth phase transitions across
multiple barriers effectively in biased metadynamics simulations. We obtain
relative free energy differences between different phases and also quantify the
roles of different molecular level features in driving the phase changes.

<h3>Ultimate charge transport regimes in doping-controlled graphene  laminates: phonon-assisted processes revealed by the linear magnetoresistance</h3>

<p>Understanding and controlling the electrical properties of solution-processed
2D materials is key to further printed electronics progress. Here we
demonstrate that the thermolysis of the aromatic intercalants utilized in
nanosheet exfoliation for graphene laminates opens the route to achieving high
intrinsic mobility and simultaneously controlling doping type ($n$- and $p$-)
and concentration over a wide range. We establish that the intra-flake mobility
is high by observing a linear magnetoresistance of such solution-processed
graphene laminates and using it to devolve the inter-flake tunneling and
intra-layer magnetotransport. Consequently, we determine the temperature
dependences of the inter- and intra-layer characteristics, which both appear to
be dominated by phonon-assisted processes at temperature $T>$20 Kelvin. In
particular, we identify the efficiency of phonon-assisted tunneling as the main
limiting factor for electrical conductivity in graphene laminates at room
temperature. We also demonstrate a thermoelectric sensitivity of around 50
${\mu}$V K$^{-1}$ in a solution-processed metal-free graphene-based
thermocouple.

<h3>Single crystal growth, chemical defects, magnetic and transport  properties of antiferromagnetic topological insulators  (Ge$_{1-δ-x}$Mn$_x$)$_2$Bi$_2$Te$_5$ ($x\leq 0.47$, $0.11 \leq δ  \leq 0.20$)</h3>

<p>Magnetic topological insulators provide a platform for emergent phenomena
arising from the interplay between magnetism and band topology. Here we report
the single crystal growth, crystal structure, magnetic and transport
properties, as well as the neutron scattering studies of topological insulator
series (Ge$_{1-\delta-x}$Mn$_x$)$_2$Bi$_2$Te$_5$ ($x\leq 0.47$, $0.11 \leq
\delta \leq 0.20$). Upon doping up to $x = 0.47$, the lattice parameter $c$
decreases by 0.8\%, while the lattice parameter $a$ remains nearly unchanged.
Significant Ge vacancies and Ge/Bi site mixing are revealed via elemental
analysis as well as refinements of the neutron and X-ray diffraction data,
resulting in holes dominating the charge transport. At $x = 0.47$, below 10.8
K, a bilayer A-type antiferromagnetic ordered state emerges, featuring an
ordered moment of 3.0(3) $\mu_{B}$/Mn at 5 K, with the $c$ axis as the easy
axis. Magnetization data unveil a much stronger interlayer antiferromagnetic
exchange interaction and a much smaller uniaxial anisotropy compared to
MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$. We attribute the former to the shorter superexchange path
and the latter to the smaller ligand-field splitting in
(Ge$_{1-\delta-x}$Mn$_x$)$_2$Bi$_2$Te$_5$. Our study demonstrates that this
series of materials holds promise for the investigation of the Layer Hall
effect and quantum metric nonlinear Hall effect.

<p>Spectacular quantum phenomena such as superconductivity often emerge in
flat-band systems where Coulomb interactions overpower electron kinetics.
Engineering strategies for flat-band physics is therefore of great importance.
Here, using high-energy grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction, we demonstrate how
in-situ temperature annealing of the infinite-layer nickelate PrNiO$_2$ induces
a giant superlattice structure. The annealing effect has a maximum well above
room temperature. By covering a large scattering volume, we show a rare
period-six in-plane (bi-axial) symmetry and a period-four symmetry in the
out-of-plane direction. This giant unit-cell superstructure likely stems from
ordering of diffusive oxygen. The stability of this superlattice structure
suggests a connection to an energetically favorable electronic state of matter.
As such, our study provides a new pathway - different from Moir\'e structures -
to ultra-small Brillouin zone electronics.

<h3>Plastic instability of annular crystalline membrane in circular  confinement</h3>

</p><i>Honghui Sun, Zhenwei Yao</i>
<p>Understanding the mechanical instabilities of two-dimensional membranes has
strong connection to the subjects of structure instabilities, morphology
control and materials failures. In this work, we investigate the plastic
mechanism developed in the annular crystalline membrane system for adapting to
the shrinking space, which is caused by the controllable gradual expansion of
the inner boundary. In the process of plastic deformation, we find the
continuous generation of dislocations at the inner boundary, and their
collective migration to the outer boundary; this neat dynamic scenario of
dislocation current captures the complicated reorganization process of the
particles. We also reveal the characteristic vortex structure arising from the
interplay of topological defects and the displacement field. These results may
find applications in the precise control of structural instabilities in
packings of particulate matter and covalently bonded systems.

<h3>Radial distribution and its spherical harmonics expansion in liquid CO2  at 250 K and 50 bar based on pressure-constant Monte Carlo simulation using  Kihara Potential Model</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Koji Kobashi</i>
<p>The purpose of this article is to compute the radial distribution function of
liquid CO2 at 250 K and 50 bar and its expansion coefficients by spherical
harmonics as a function of intermolecular distance up to 20 angstroms for all
possible combinations of angular indices l, l prime, and m less than or equal
to 8, in contrast to past works of limited combinations. The positions and
orientations of CO2 molecules were determined by pressure-constant Monte Carlo
simulation using a Kihara potential model. It was found that the radial
distribution function had an intense peak at 4.05 angstroms and a broad band at
around 7.85 angstroms. The expansion coefficients had prominent structures
below approximately 7.5 angstroms, showing positive and/or negative peaks,
which indicated that the orientational correlations of the central molecule
were intense with the molecules present in that region. It was also found that
the peaks of some expansion coefficients were not small even when l = 8. The
implication of the values of the expansion coefficients as well as their
positive/negative peaks, relating to orientational correlation, are yet to be
investigated further.

<p>The present study delves into exploring the impact of a thin protective layer
of scandium nitride (ScN) on the superconductive properties of thin films of
niobium nitride (NbN) generated through reactive magnetron deposition. This is
the first time such an investigation has been carried out. The article offers a
comprehensive investigation of the morphological, microstructural, and
electrophysical features of thin films that have undergone high-temperature
annealing in an oxygen-rich environment. The dependence of the critical
transition temperature of the NbN thin film on the annealing temperature of the
samples in an oxygen medium, with and without ScN coating, was determined.
According to X-ray reflectometry studies, it has been observed that the ScN
film serves as a protective layer, even when exposed to annealing temperatures
of approximately 450{\deg}C, without significantly affecting the NbN layer
density or thickness. It has been shown that adding a ScN coating to a thin NbN
film increases its resistance to corrosive media compared to a film without the
coating.

<p>Why complex structures emerge in a real world environment is a fascinating
question which has not found any fully satisfactory answer at the point of
today. At the border between statistical physics, machine learning and network
theory, we provide some computational empirical evidence indicating that the
emergence of complex structures in a real world environment is the macroscopic
thermodynamic result of the optimal trade-off between the ability to encode
information about the environment in the very features of the network and the
ability to transmit information across it. While the former is quantified by
the von Neumann network entropy and the latter by the Helmholtz free energy,
the two are gathered into a single quantity tantamount to the thermodynamic
efficiency. We take as a case study an algorithm originally proposed for
creating and searching trees of patterns under the assumption that, akin to
living system, the algorithm seeks the best internal representation of the
outer world, namely a real world dataset of patterns. Remarkably, optimal
thermodynamic efficiency overlaps with the optimal algorithmic efficiency,
defined in terms of accuracy and computational cost, whether the former is
measured at the resolution scale in where the network transits from exhibiting
a specific heat with a single peak to a scale-invariant region. Moreover the
critical hypothesis is investigated and empirical evidence suggests that the
system benefits from the critical-state when it confronts with
higher-complexity environments, while it does not when the environment is
simpler.

<h3>Why Some Metal Ions Spontaneously Form Nanoparticles in Water  Microdroplets? Disentangling the Contributions of Air-Water Interface and  Bulk Redox Chemistry</h3>

</p><i>Muzzamil Ahmad Eatoo, Nimer Wehbe, Najeh Kharbatia, Xianrong Guo, Himanshu Mishra</i>
<p>Water microdroplets containing 100 micromolar HAuCl4 have been shown to
reduce gold ions into gold nanoparticles spontaneously. It has been suggested
that this chemical transformation is driven by ultrahigh electric fields at the
air-water interface, albeit without mechanistic insight. We investigated the
fate of several metallic salts in water, methanol, ethanol, and acetonitrile in
bulk and microdroplets. This revealed that when HAuCl4 (or PtCl4) is added to
bulk water (or methanol or ethanol), metal NPs appear spontaneously. Over time,
the nanoparticles grow in bulk, as evidenced by the solution's changing colors.
If the same bulk solution is sprayed pneumatically and collected, the NP size
has no significant enhancement. Interestingly, the reduction of metal ions is
accompanied by the oxidation of water (or alcohols); however, these redox
reactions are minimal in acetonitrile. We establish that the spontaneous
reduction of metal ions is (i) not limited to water or gold ions, (ii) not
driven by the air-water interface of microdroplets, and (iii) appears to be a
general phenomenon for solvents containing hydroxyl groups. These results
advance our understanding of liquids in general and should be relevant in soil
chemistry, biogeochemistry, electrochemistry, and green chemistry.

<p>We present a detailed analysis of the electronic properties of
graphene/Eu/Ni(111). By using angle and spin-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy and ab initio calculations, we show that the Eu-intercalation of
graphene/Ni(111) restores the nearly freestanding dispersion of the
$\pi\pi^\ast$ Dirac cones at the K point with an additional lifting of the spin
degeneracy due to the mixing of graphene and Eu states. The interaction with
the magnetic substrate results in a large spin-dependent gap in the Dirac cones
with a topological nature characterized by a large Berry curvature, and a
spin-polarized van Hove singularity, whose closeness to the Fermi level gives
rise to a polaronic band.

<h3>Semiclassical perspective on Landau levels and Hall conductivity in an  anisotropic Cubic Dirac Semi-Metal and the peculiar case of star-shaped  classical orbits</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17902" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17902</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ahmed Jellal, Hocine Bahlouli, Michael Vogl</i>
<p>We study an anisotropic cubic Dirac semi-metal subjected to a constant
magnetic field. In the case of an isotropic dispersion in the $x$-$y$ plane,
with parameters $v_{x}=v_{y}$, it is possible to find exact Landau levels,
indexed by the quantum number $n$, using the typical ladder operator approach.
Interestingly, we find that the lowest energy level (the zero energy state in
the case $k_z=0$) has a degeneracy that is three times that of other states.
This degeneracy manifests in the Hall conductivity as a step at zero chemical
potential that is 3/2 the size of other steps. Moreover, as $n\to\infty$ we
find energies $E_n\propto n^{3/2}$, which means the $n$-th step as a function
of chemical potential roughly occurs at a value $\mu\propto n^{3/2}$. We
propose that these exciting features could be used to identify cubic Dirac
semi-metals experimentally. Subsequently, we analyze the anisotropic case
$v_{y}=\lambda v_{x}$ with $\lambda\neq 1$. First, we consider a perturbative
treatment around $\lambda\approx 1$ and find that energies $E_n\propto n^{3/2}$
still holds as $n\to\infty$. To gain further insight into the Landau level
structure for a maximum anisotropy, we turn to a semi-classical treatment that
reveals interesting star-shaped orbits in phase space that close at infinity.
This property is a manifestation of weakly localized states. Despite being
infinite in length, these orbits enclose a finite phase space volume and permit
finding a simple semi-classical formula for the energy, which again has the
form as above. Our findings suggest that both isotropic and anisotropic cubic
Dirac semi-metals should leave similar experimental imprints.

<h3>Localized State-Induced Enhanced Emission in Perovskite Nanocrystals</h3>

<p>The luminescent mechanism of nano-sized materials with indirect bandgap and
parity-forbidden transition has always been a critical issue in breaking
through bottlenecks in traditional luminescent materials. The lack of
understanding has resulted in great disputes regarding the origin of
fluorescence in weak-transition nanocrystals (NCs). This paper proposes a new
physical luminescence model, named as localized state-induced enhanced emission
(LIEE), i.e., localized processes induced by size-limitation or partial doping,
to explain the anomalous luminescence from non-luminescent state to luminescent
state in various perovskite nanocrystals with indirect/direct bandgap or
parity-forbidden transition. These findings provide a theoretical viewpoint to
design efficient lead-free perovskite NCs and promote the development of fast
optical transitions in luminescent materials.

<h3>Hyperbolicity of the ballistic-conductive model of heat conduction: the  reverse side of the coin</h3>

<p>The heat equation, based on Fourier's law, is commonly used for description
of heat conduction. However, Fourier's law is valid under the assumption of
local thermodynamic equilibrium, which is violated in very small dimensions and
short timescales, and at low temperatures. In the paper R. Kovacs and P. Van,
Generalized heat conduction in heat pulse experiments, Int. J. Heat Mass
Transf., 83:613-620, 2015, a ballistic-conductive (BC) model of heat conduction
was developed. In this paper, we study the behavior of solutions to an initial
value problem (IVP) in 1D in the framework of the linearized
ballistic-conductive (BC) model. As a result of the study, an unphysical effect
has been found when part of the initial thermal energy does not spread
anywhere.

<p>We experimentally investigate Josephson current between two 5~$\mu$m spaced
superconducting indium leads, coupled to a NiTe$_2$ single crystal flake, which
is a type-II Dirac semimetal. Under microwave irradiation, we demonstrate a.c.
Josephson effect at millikelvin temperatures as a number of Shapiro steps. In
addition to the integer ($n=1,2,3,4...$) steps, we observe fractional ones at
half-integer values $n=1/2,3/2,5/2$ and 7/2, which corresponds to $\pi$
periodicity of current-phase relationship. In contrast to previous
investigations, we do not observe $4\pi$ periodicity (disappearance of the odd
$n=1,3,5...$ Shapiro steps), while the latter is usually considered as a
fingerprint of helical surface states in Dirac semimetals and topological
insulators. We argue, that our experiment confirms Josephson current through
the topological hinge states in NiTe$_2$: since one can exclude bulk
supercurrent in 5~$\mu$m long Josephson junctions, interference of the hinge
modes is responsible for the $\pi$ periodicity, while stable odd Shapiro steps
reflect chiral character of the topological hinge states.

<h3>Diffusiophoresis of ionic catalytic particles</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Evgeny S. Asmolov, Olga I. Vinogradova</i>
<p>A migration of charged particles relative to a solvent, caused by a gradient
of salt concentration and termed a diffusiophoresis, is of much interest being
exploited in many fields. Existing theories deal with diffusiophoresis of
passive inert particles. In this paper, we extend prior models by focusing on a
particle, which is both passive and catalytic, by postulating an uniform ion
release over its surface. We derive an expression for a particle velocity
depending on a dimensionless ion flux (Damkohler number Da) and show that a
charged region is formed at distances of the order of the particle size,
provided the diffusion coefficients of anions and cations are unequal. When Da
becomes large enough, the contribution of this (outer) region to the particle
velocity dominates. In this case the speed of catalytic passive particles
augments linearly with Da and is inversely proportional to the square of
electrolyte concentration. As a result, they always migrate towards a high
concentration region and in dilute solutions become much faster than inert
(non-catalytic) ones.

<p>The effects of sintering temperature (Ts) and chemical substitution on the
structural and magnetic properties of manganite compounds La1-xSrxMn1-yFeyO3
(0.025 <= x <= 0.7; y= 0.01,0.15) are explored in a search to optimize their
magnetocaloric properties around room temperature. A ferromagnetic (FM) to
paramagnetic (PM) phase transition is observed at a Curie temperature Tc that
can be controlled to approach room temperature by Sr and Fe substitution, but
also by adjusting the sintering temperature Ts. Accordingly, the magnetic
entropy change (-DSM) quantifying the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) presents a
peak at or close to Tc that shifts and broadens with both Sr and Fe doping and
is further tuned with sintering temperature. Altogether, we show that it is
possible to adjust the strength and dominance of the ferromagnetic coupling in
these ceramics, but also using disorder as a tool to broaden and adjust the
temperature range with significant magnetic entropy change.

<p>Magnetic hopfions are three-dimensional localized magnetic topological
solitons which can exist in the bulk of magnetic materials. Based on a Ritz
model for magnetic hopfions in a chiral magnet, the unpolarized magnetic
small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) cross section, the spin-flip scattering
cross section, and the chiral function (characterizing the imbalance between
the two spin-flip scattering amplitudes) are computed here analytically; while
the real-space correlation function is obtained numerically. Features of these
functions, specific to magnetic hopfions, are discussed. Our results enable the
SANS method to be used for the detection of magnetic hopfions.

</p><i>Ambarneil Saha, Matthew Mecklenburg, Alexander J. Pattison, Aaron S. Brewster, Jose A. Rodriguez, Peter Ercius</i>
<p>Every electron crystallography experiment is fundamentally limited by
radiation damage. Nevertheless, little is known about the onset and progression
of radiolysis in beam-sensitive molecular crystals. Here we apply
ambient-temperature scanning nanobeam electron diffraction to record
simultaneous dual-space snapshots of organic and organometallic nanocrystals at
sequential stages of beam-induced radiolytic decay. We show that the underlying
mosaic of coherently diffracting zones (CDZs) continuously undergoes spatial
reorientation as a function of accumulating electron exposure, causing the
intensities of many Bragg reflections to fade nonmonotonically. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that repeated irradiation at a single probe position leads to the
concentric propagation of delocalized radiolytic damage well beyond the initial
point of impact. These results sharpen our understanding of molecular crystals
as conglomerates of CDZs whose complex lattice structure deteriorates through a
series of dynamic internal changes during exposure to ionizing radiation.

<h3>Constrained Hamiltonian dynamics for electrons in magnetic field and  additional forces besides the Lorentz force acting on electrons</h3>

</p><i>Hiroyasu Koizumi</i>
<p>We consider the forces acting on electrons in magnetic field including the
constraints and a condition arising from quantum mechanics. The force is
calculated as the electron mass, $m_e$, multiplied by the total time-derivative
of the velocity field evaluated using the quantum mechanical many-electron wave
function. The velocity field includes a term of the Berry connection from the
many-body wave function; thereby, quantum mechanical effects are included. It
is shown that additional important forces besides the Lorentz force exist; they
include the gradient of the electron velocity field kinetic energy, the
gradient of the chemical potential, and the `force' for producing topologically
protected loop currents. These additional forces are shown to be important in
superconductivity, electric current in metallic wires, and charging of
capacitors.

high-quality graphene through a straightforward CVD process has been
traditionally considered mutually exclusive. This study demonstrates that we
can produce high-quality graphene domains with controlled thickness through a
one-step growth process at atmospheric pressure using blood as a precursor.
Raman spectroscopy confirms the uniformity of the blood-grown graphene films,
and observing the half-integer quantum Hall effect in the measured devices
highlights its outstanding electronic properties. This unprecedented approach
opens possibilities for blood application, facilitating an unconventional route

<p>Microstructure uniformity of the Al-Nd target materials with Al11Nd3
significantly affects the performance of the fabricated film, which is widely
used as wiring material in largesize thin-film transistor liquid crystal
display (TFT-LCD) panels. Understanding the inherent mechanical properties and
chemical bonds of Al11Nd3 is crucial for homogenizing the Al-Nd target. Here,
by a combined experimental and ab-initio theoretical study, the microstructure
and deformability of the Al-3wt%Nd alloy and the inherent mechanical properties
and chemical bonds of Al11Nd3 are investigated comprehensively. The Al-3wt%Nd
alloy is composed of the pre-eutectic {\alpha}-Al matrix and the eutectic
{\alpha}-Al and a high stable {\alpha}-Al11Nd3 phases. During the plastic
deformation, the eutectic microstructure transforms from a cellular to a
lamellar shape, while the morphology and dimension of {\alpha}-Al11Nd3 are not
changed significantly. By examining ideal tensile strength, elastic moduli,
hardness and brittleness-ductility, the hardnessbrittleness of {\alpha}-Al11Nd3
is quantitatively evaluated, accounting for its difficulties of plastic
deformation and fragmentation. Combining band structure, population analysis,
topological analysis and crystal orbital Hamilton population, it is revealed
that {\alpha}-Al11Nd3 possesses two types of chemical bonds: the Nd-Al and
Al-Al bonds. The former is a typical ionic bond with electron transfer from Nd
to Al, while the latter, dominated by both 3s-3p and 3p-3p interactions, is a
weak covalent bond. The mixed chemical bond is responsible for the high
hardness-brittleness of {\alpha}-Al11Nd3. This work is expected to lay a
foundation for Al-Nd alloy and catalyze the fabrication of high-quality Al-Nd
target materials.

<p>Floquet engineering is a powerful manipulation method in modern quantum
technology. However, unwanted heating is the main challenge of Floquet
engineering, therefore the Floquet thermalization has attracting considerable
attentions recently. In this work, we investigate thermalization of
periodically driven many-body systems through the lens of Krylov complexity,
and find a topological origin of different thermalization behaviors. We
demonstrate that If the topology of the Krylov chain is nontrivial, a
periodically driven system will reach a state with finite temperature. When the
Krylov chain is topologically trivial, the system will be heated to infinite
temperature. We further show that the prethermalization can be understood as
the tunnelling process of a quasi-edge mode through the local gap on Krylov
chain. This picture provides a systematically method to obtain the effective
prethermal Hamiltonian.

<p>Spin-orbit torque (SOT) in the heavy elements with a large spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) has been frequently used to manipulate the magnetic states in
spintronic devices. Recent theoretical works have predicted that the surface
oxidized light elements with a negligible SOC can yield a sizable orbital
torque (OT), which plays an important role in switching the magnetization.
Here, we report anomalous-Hall-resistance and harmonic-Hall-voltage
measurements on perpendicularly magnetized Ta/Cu/[Ni/Co]$_5$/Cu-CuO$_x$
multilayers. Both torque efficiency and spin-Hall angle of these multilayers
are largely enhanced by introducing a naturally oxidized Cu-CuO$_x$ layer,
where the SOC is negligible. Such an enhancement is mainly due to the
collaborative driven of the SOT from the Ta layer and the OT from the
Cu/CuO$_x$ interface, and can be tuned by controlling the thickness of
Cu-CuO$_x$ layer. Compared to the Cu-CuO$_x$-free multilayers, the maximum
torque efficiency and spin-Hall angle were enhanced by a factor of ten, larger
than most of the reported values in the other heterostructures.

<p>Two-dimensional ferroelectrics can maintain vertical polarization up to room
temperature, and are, therefore, promising for next-generation nonvolatile
memories. Although natural two-dimensional ferroelectrics are few, moir\'{e}
superlattices provide us with a generalized method to construct ferroelectrics
from non-ferroelectric parent materials. We report a realization of
ferroelectric hysteresis in a AB-BA stacked twisted double bilayer graphene
(TDBG) system. The ferroelectric polarization is prominent at zero external
displacement field and reduces upon increasing displacement fields. TDBG in the
AB-BA configuration possesses a superlattice of non-centrosymmetric domains,
exhibiting alternatively switchable polarities even without the assistance of
any boron nitride layers; however, in the AB-AB stacking case, the development
of polarized domains necessitates the presence of a second superlattice induced
by the adjacent boron nitride layer. Therefore, twisted multilayer graphene
systems offer us a fascinating field to explore two-dimensional
ferroelectricity.

<p>We conduct experimental studies on the electrical transport properties of
monolayer graphene directly covered by a few layers of $\rm CrI_3$. We do not
observe the expected magnetic exchange coupling in the graphene but instead
discover proximity effects featuring gate and magnetic field tunability. The
tunability of gate voltage is manifested in the alignment of the lowest
conduction band of $\rm CrI_3$ and the Fermi level of graphene, which can be
controlled by the gate voltage. The coexistence of the normal and atypical
quantum Hall effects in our device also corresponds to gate-control modulation
doping. The lowest conduction band depends on the magnetic states of the $\rm
CrI_3$ and can be altered by the magnetic field, which corresponds to the
resistance loops during back-and-forth sweeps of the magnetic field. Our
results serve as a reference for exploiting the magnetic proximity effects in
graphene.

</p><i>Zhiyu Dong, Patrick A. Lee, Leonid Levitov</i>
<p>This paper aims to clarify the nature of a surprising ordered phase recently
reported in biased Bernal bilayer graphene that occurs at the phase boundary
between the isospin-polarized and unpolarized phases. Strong nonlinearity of
transport at abnormally small currents, with $dI/dV$ vs. $I$ sharply rising and
then falling back, is typical for a charge/spin-density-wave state (CDW or SDW)
sliding transport. Here, however, it is observed at an isospin-order phase
boundary, prompting a question about the CDW/SDW mechanism and its relation to
the quantum critical point. We argue that the observed phase diagram cannot be
understood within a standard weak-coupling picture. Rather, it points to a
mechanism that relies on an effective interaction enhancement at a quantum
critical point. We develop a detailed strong-coupling framework accounting for
the soft collective modes that explain these observations.

<p>Confinement/deconfinement, captivating attributes of high-energy elementary

on cold atoms. Yet, the partial confinement, an intermediate state between the
confinement and deconfinement, remains underexplored. The partial confinement
encapsulates the phenomenon that the confining behavior of charged particles is
contingent upon their relative positions. In this paper, we demonstrate that
the spin-1 quantum link model provides an excellent platform for exploring
partial confinement. We conduct a comprehensive investigation of the physics
emerging from partial confinement in both the context of equilibrium and
non-equilibrium dynamics. Potential experimental setups using cold atoms are
also discussed. Our work offers a simple and feasible routine for the study of
confinement-related physics in the state-of-the-art artificial quantum systems

for a variety of applications in nanotechnology. We use self-consistent field
theory to investigate the elastic response of sphere monolayer films with
respect to in-plane shear, in-plane extension and compression deformations, and
with respect to bending. The relations between the in-plane elastic moduli is
roughly compatible with the expectations for two-dimensional elastic systems
with hexagonal symmetry, with one notable exception: The pure shear and the
simple shear moduli differ from each other by roughly 20%. Even more
importantly, the bending constants are found to be negative, indicating that
free-standing block copolymer membranes made of only sphere mono-layer are
inherently unstable above the glass transition. Our results are discussed in

<p>A current flowing through a superconductor induces a spatial modulation in
its superconducting order parameter, characterized by a wavevector $Q$ related
to the total momentum of a Cooper pair. Here we investigate this phenomenon in
a $p$-wave topological superconductor, described by a one-dimensional Kitaev
model. We demonstrate that, by treating $Q$ as an extra synthetic dimension,
the current carrying non-equilibrium steady state can be mapped into the ground
state of a half-filled two-dimensional Weyl semimetal, whose Fermi surface
exhibits Lifshitz transitions when varying the model parameters. Specifically,
the transition from Type-I to Type-II Weyl phases corresponds to the emergence
of a gapless $p$-wave superconductor, where Cooper pairs coexist with unpaired
electrons and holes. Such transition is signaled by the appearance of a sharp
cusp in the $Q$-dependence of the supercurrent, at a critical value $Q^*$ that
is robust to variations of the chemical potential $\mu$. We determine the
maximal current that the system can sustain in the topological phase, and
discuss possible implementations.

<h3>Tailoring coercive fields and the Curie temperature via proximity  coupling in WSe$_2$/Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructures</h3>

<p>Hybrid structures consisting of two-dimensional (2D) magnets and
semiconductors have exhibited extensive functionalities in spintronics and
opto-spintronics. In this work, we have fabricated WSe$_2$/Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ van
der Waals (vdW) heterostructures and investigated the proximity effects on 2D
magnetism. Through reflective magnetic circular dichroism (RMCD), we have
observed a temperature-dependent modulation of magnetic order in the
heterostructure. For temperatures above $40$ K, WSe$_2$-covered Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$
exhibits a larger coercive field than that observed in bare Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$,
accompanied by a noticeable enhancement of the Curie temperature by $21$ K.
This strengthening suggests an increase in magnetic anisotropy in the
interfacial Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ layer, which can be attributed to the spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) proximity effect induced by the adjacent WSe$_2$ layers.
However, at much lower temperatures ($T<20$ K), a non-monotonic modification of
the coercive field is observed, showing both reduction and enhancement, which
depends on the thickness of the WSe$_2$ and Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ layers. Moreover, an
unconventional two-step magnetization process emerges in the heterostructure,
indicating the short-range nature of SOC proximity effects. Our findings
revealing proximity effects on 2D magnetism may shed light on the design of
future spintronic and memory devices based on 2D magnetic heterostructures.

<h3>Magnetic phase diagram of EuPdSn_2</h3>

<p>A magnetic phase diagram for EuPdSn_2 is constructed based on magnetization,
DC-susceptibility and specific heat as a function of applied field, and neutron
diffraction results at zero field. The contribution of the ferromagnetic FM and
antiferromagnetic AFM components to the measured magnetic susceptibility can be
separated and weighted as a function of the applied field B by taking the
temperature dependence of the neutron counts from the FM phase at B=0 as a
reference. In the magnetically ordered phase, the temperature dependence of the
specific heat does not follow the mean-field prediction for the Eu^{2+} J=7/2
quantum number rather that for J=5/2. This deviation and the consequent
discrepancy for the entropy is discussed in the context of a non-Zeeman
distribution of the eight fold ground state. Comparing the respective
variations of magnetization M(T,B) and entropy S(T,B), the thermodynamic
relationship dM/dT=dS/dB=0 is observed for the ranges: 0<T<10K and 0<B<0.4T.

<p>Biological motors, as counterpart of heat engines, are driven by a chemical
gradient to output mechanical work and play critical roles in biological
functions, such as the ATP synthesis. Its thermodynamic efficiency, along with
power, are two vital criteria for evaluating the performance of these motors.
In this letter, we investigate a model of a microscopic chemical engine and
assess the constraint relation between power and efficiency for the cycle with
finite operation time. Our model demonstrates a general constraint relation
between power and efficiency, and predicts that the efficiency at maximum power
in the large friction regime is half of the maximum quasi-static efficiency,
i.e., 1/2. These findings shall provide new direction to optimize the operation
of microscopic biological motors.

<p>Quantum Hall systems are platforms of choice when it comes to study
topological properties of condensed matter systems and anyonic exchange
statistics. In this work we have developed a tunable radiofrequency edge
magnetoplasmonic resonator meant to serve as a versatile platform for future
interferometric devices. The resonance frequency of the system is controlled by
both the magnetic field and a set of electrostatic gates. The gates allow us to
change both the size of the resonant cavity and the electronic density of the
two-dimensional electron gas. We show that we can continuously control the
frequency response of our resonator, making it possible to develop an edge
magnetoplasmon interferometer. As we reach smaller sizes of our resonator,
finite size effects caused by the measurement probes manifest. We present a
theoretical description of the system taking into account the spatial extension
of the probing gates. In the future, such device will be a valuable tool to
investigate the properties of non-abelian anyons in the fractional quantum Hall
regime.

</p><i>Dinesh Bista, Willie B. Beeson, Turbasu Sengupta, Jerome Jackson, Shiv N Khanna, Kai Liu, Gen Yin</i>
<p>We show that the magnetic properties of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) can be
captured by \textit{ab initio} calculations within the coherent potential
approximation, where the atomic details of the high-entropy mixing are
considered as an effective medium that possesses the translational symmetry of
the lattice. This is demonstrated using the face-centered cubic (FCC) phase of
$\textrm{FeCoNiMnCu}$ and the $L1_0$ phase of $\textrm{(FeCoNiMnCu)Pt}$ by
comparing the density functional theory (DFT) results with the experimental
values. Working within the first Brillouin zone and the primitive unit cell, we
show that DFT can capture the smooth profile of magnetic properties such as the
saturation magnetization, the Curie temperature and the magnetic anisotropy,
using only a sparse set of sampling points in the vast compositional space. The
smooth profiles given by DFT indeed follow the experimental trend,
demonstrating the promising potential of using machine learning to explore the
magnetic properties of HEAs, by establishing reasonably large datasets with
high-throughput calculations using density-functional theory.

<h3>Autonomous dynamics of two-dimensional insulating domain with  superclimbing edges</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Anatoly Kuklov, Nikolay Prokof'ev, Boris Svistunov</i>
<p>Superclimbing dynamics is the signature feature of transverse quantum fluids
describing wide superfluid one-dimensional interfaces and/or edges with
negligible Peierls barrier. Using Lagrangian formalism, we show how the essence
of the superclimb phenomenon -- dynamic conjugation of the fields of the
superfluid phase and geometric shape -- clearly manifests itself via
characteristic modes of autonomous motion of the insulating domain (``droplet")
with superclimbing edges. In the translation invariant case and in the absence
of supercurrent along the edge, the droplet demonstrates ballistic motion with
the velocity-dependent shape and zero bulk currents. In an isotropic trapping
potential, the droplet features a doubly degenerate sloshing mode. The period
of the ground-state evolution of the superfluid phase (dictating the frequency
of the AC Josephson effect) is sensitive to the geometry of the droplet. The
supercurrent along the edge dramatically changes the droplet dynamics: The
motion acquires features resembling that of a 2D charged particle interacting
with a perpendicular magnetic field. In a linear external potential (uniform
force field), the state with a supercurrent demonstrates a spectacular
gyroscopic effect -- uniform motion in the perpendicular to the force
direction.

<h3>Tunable Ultrafast Dynamics of Antiferromagnetic Vortices in Nanoscale  Dots</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Ji Zou, Even Thingstad, Se Kwon Kim, Jelena Klinovaja, Daniel Loss</i>
<p>Topological vortex textures in magnetic disks have garnered great attention
due to their interesting physics and diverse applications. However, up to now,
the vortex state has mainly been studied in microsize ferromagnetic disks,
which have oscillation frequencies confined to the GHz range. Here, we propose
an experimentally feasible ultrasmall and ultrafast vortex state in an
antiferromagnetic nanodot surrounded by a heavy metal, which is further
harnessed to construct a highly tunable vortex network. We theoretically
demonstrate that, interestingly, the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (iDMI) induced by the heavy metal at the boundary of the dot acts
as an effective chemical potential for the vortices in the interior. Mimicking
the creation of a superfluid vortex by rotation, we show that a magnetic vortex
state can be stabilized by this iDMI. Subjecting the system to an electric
current can trigger vortex oscillations via spin-transfer torque, which reside
in the THz regime and can be further modulated by external magnetic fields.
Furthermore, we show that coherent coupling between vortices in different
nanodisks can be achieved via an antiferromagnetic link. Remarkably, this
interaction depends on the vortex polarity and topological charge and is also
exceptionally tunable through the vortex resonance frequency. This opens up the
possibility for controllable interconnected networks of antiferromagnetic
vortices. Our proposal therefore introduces a new avenue for developing
high-density memory, ultrafast logic devices, and THz signal generators, which
are ideal for compact integration into microchips.

<h3>Casimir force within Ising chain with competing interactions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18324" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18324</a>
<br>
</p><i>Daniel Dantchev, Nicholay Tonchev, Joseph Rudnick</i>
<p>We derive exact results for the critical Casimir force (CCF) within the
one-dimensional Ising model with periodic boundary conditions (PBC's) and
long-range equivalent-neighbor ferromagnetic interactions of strength
$J_{l}/N>0$ superimposed on the nearest-neighbor interactions of strength
$J_{s}$ which could be either ferromagnetic ($J_{s}>0$) or antiferromagnetic
($J_{s}<0$). In the infinite system limit the model, also known as the
Nagle-Kardar model, exhibits in the plane $(K_s=\beta J_s,K_l=\beta J_l)$ a
critical line $2 K_l=\exp{\left(-2 K_s\right)}, K_s>-\ln3/4$, which ends at a
tricritical point $(K_l=-\sqrt{3}/2, K_s=-\ln3/4)$. The critical Casimir
amplitudes are: $\Delta_{\rm Cas}^{\rm (cr)}=1/4$ at the critical line, and
$\Delta_{\rm Cas}^{\rm (tr)}=1/3$ at the tricritical point. Quite unexpectedly,
with the imposed PBC's the CCF exhibits very unusual behavior as a function of
temperature and magnetic field. It is repulsive near the critical line and
tricritical point, decaying rapidly with separation from those two singular
regimes fast away from them and becoming attractive, displaying in which the
maximum amplitude of the attraction exceeds the maximum amplitude of repulsion.
This represents a violation of the widely-accepted "boundary condition rule",
which holds that the CCF is attractive for equivalent BC's and repulsive for
conflicting BC's independently of the actual bulk universality class of the
phase transition under investigation.

<p>We propose a new approach to study the transition between different
topological states, based on the assessment of the vibrational resonances in
infrared spectra. We consider the Haldane and Kane-Mele models finding that
Born effective charges are nearly quantized, with a discontinuous jump
concomitant with the topological phase transition. In particular, Born
effective charges display a finite value in the trivial phase and a null one in
the nontrivial one. This is rooted in the connection between Born effective
charges and electronic Berry curvature at the band edges.

<h3>Interfacial Rheology of Lanthanide Binding Peptide Surfactants at the  Air-Water Interface</h3>

<p>Peptide surfactants (PEPS) are studied to capture and retain rare earth
elements (REEs) at air-water interfaces to enable REE separations. Peptide
sequences, designed to selectively bind REEs, depend crucially on the position
of ligands within their binding loop domain. These ligands form a coordination
sphere that wraps and retains the cation. We study variants of lanthanide
binding tags (LBTs) designed to complex strongly with Tb$^{3+}$. The peptide
LBT$^{5-}$ (with net charge -5) is known to bind Tb$^{3+}$ and adsorb with more
REE cations than peptide molecules, suggesting that undesired non-specific
Coulombic interactions occur. Rheological characterization of interfaces of
LBT$^{5-}$ and Tb$^{3+}$ solutions reveal the formation of an interfacial gel.
To probe whether this gelation reflects chelation among intact adsorbed
LBT$^{5-}$:Tb$^{3+}$ complexes or destruction of the binding loop, we study a
variant, LBT$^{3-}$, designed to form net neutral LBT$^{3-}$:Tb$^{3+}$
complexes. Solutions of LBT$^{3-}$ and Tb$^{3+}$ form purely viscous layers in
the presence of excess Tb$^{3+}$, indicating that each peptide binds a single
REE in an intact coordination sphere. We introduce the variant RR-LBT$^{3-}$
with net charge -3 and anionic ligands outside of the coordination sphere. We
find that such exposed ligands promote interfacial gelation. Thus, a nuanced
requirement for interfacial selectivity of PEPS is proposed: that anionic
ligands outside of the coordination sphere must be avoided to prevent the
non-selective recruitment of REE cations. This view is supported by simulation,
including interfacial molecular dynamics simulations, and interfacial
metadynamics simulations of the free energy landscape of the binding loop
conformational space.

<p>CsV3Sb5, a notable compound within the kagome family, is renowned for its
topological and superconducting properties, as well as its detection of local
magnetic field and anomalous Hall effect in experiments. However, the origin of
this local magnetic field is still veiled. In this study, we employ the
first-principles calculations to investigate the atomic vibration in both the
pristine and the charge-density-wave phases of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our analysis
reveals the presence of ``anomalous phonons" in these structures, these phonon
induce the circular vibration of atoms, contributing to the phonon magnetic
moments and subsequently to the observed the local magnetic fields.
Additionally, we observe that lattice distortion in the charge-density-wave
phase amplifies these circular vibrations, resulting in a stronger local
magnetic field, particularly from the vanadium atoms. This investigation not
only reveals the potential relation between lattice distortion and atomic
polarization but also offers a novel idea to understand the origin of local
magnetic moment in CsV3Sb5.

<p>We consider quantum entanglement in strongly correlated quantum impurity
systems for states manifesting interesting properties such as multi-level Kondo
effect and dual nature between itineracy and localization etc.. For this
purpose, we set up a system consisting of one or two quantum impurities
arbitrarily selected from the system as a subsystem, and investigate quantum
entanglement with its environmental system. We reduce the pure state of
interest as described above to the subsystem, and formulate quantum informative
quantities such as entanglement entropy, mutual information and relative
entropy. We apply them to the single impurity Anderson model where the most
basic Kondo effect is manifested, and obtain new insights into the Kondo effect
there. The obtained results suggest that the method proposed here is promising
for elucidating the quantum entanglement of pure states in various quantum
impurity systems.

<p>We propose a variational modelling method with differentiable temperature for
canonical ensembles. Using a deep generative model, the free energy is
estimated and minimized simultaneously in a continuous temperature range. At
optimal, this generative model is a Boltzmann distribution with temperature
dependence. The training process requires no dataset, and works with arbitrary
explicit density generative models. We applied our method to study the phase
transitions (PT) in the Ising and XY models, and showed that the
direct-sampling simulation of our model is as accurate as the Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, but more efficient. Moreover, our method can
give thermodynamic quantities as differentiable functions of temperature akin
to an analytical solution. The free energy aligns closely with the exact one to
the second-order derivative, so this inclusion of temperature dependence
enables the otherwise biased variational model to capture the subtle thermal
effects at the PTs. These findings shed light on the direct simulation of
physical systems using deep generative models

<p>The interaction of atomic orbitals at the interface of perovskite oxide
heterostructures has been investigated for its profound impact on the band
structures and electronic properties, giving rise to unique electronic states
and a variety of tunable functionalities. In this study, we conducted an
extensive investigation of the optical and electronic properties of epitaxial
NdNiO3 thin films grown on a series of single crystal substrates. Unlike films
synthesized on other substrates, NdNiO3 on SrTiO3 (NNO/STO) gives rise to a
unique band structure which features an additional unoccupied band situated
above the Fermi level. Our comprehensive investigation, which incorporated a
wide array of experimental techniques and density functional theory
calculations, revealed that the emergence of the interfacial band structure is
primarily driven by the orbital hybridization between Ti 3d orbitals of the STO
substrate and O 2p orbitals of the NNO thin film. Furthermore, exciton peaks
have been detected in the optical spectra of the NNO/STO film, attributable to
the pronounced electron-electron (e-e) and electron-hole (e-h) interactions
propagating from the STO substrate into the NNO film. These findings underscore
the substantial influence of interfacial orbital hybridization on the
electronic structure of oxide thin-films, thereby offering key insights into
tuning their interfacial properties.

<p>In the recently discovered kagome superconductor AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, and Cs),
the superconductivity is intertwined with an unconventional charge density wave
order. Its pairing symmetry remains elusive owing to the lack of direct
measurement of the superconducting gap in the momentum space. In this letter,
utilizing laser-based ultra-high-resolution and low-temperature angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, we observe anisotropic Cooper pairing in kagome
superconductor CsV3Sb5. We detect a highly anisotropic superconducting gap
structure with an anisotropy over 80% and the gap maximum along the V-V bond
direction on a Fermi surface originated from the 3d-orbital electrons of the V
kagome lattice. It is in stark contrast to the isotropic superconducting gap
structure on the other Fermi surface that is occupied by Sb 5p-orbital
electrons. Our observation of the anisotropic Cooper pairing in pristine
CsV3Sb5 is fundamental for understanding intertwined orders in the ground state
of kagome superconductors.

<br>
</p><i>Aurélien Grabsch, Hiroki Moriya, Kirone Mallick, Tomohiro Sasamoto, Olivier Bénichou</i>
<p>The symmetric simple exclusion process (SEP), where diffusive particles
cannot overtake each other, is a paradigmatic model of transport in the
single-file geometry. In this model, the study of currents has attracted a lot
of attention, but so far most results are restricted to two geometries: (i) a
finite system between two reservoirs, which does not conserve the number of
particles but reaches a nonequilibrium steady state, and (ii) an infinite
system which conserves the number of particles but never reaches a steady
state. Here, we determine the full cumulant generating function of the
integrated current in the important intermediate situation of a semi-infinite
system connected to a reservoir, which does not conserve the number of
particles and never reaches a steady state. This result is obtained thanks to
the determination of the full spatial structure of the correlations which
remarkably obey the very same closed equation recently obtained in the infinite
geometry. Besides their intrinsic interest, these results allow us to solve two
open problems: the survival probability of a fixed target in the SEP, and the
statistics of the number of particles injected by a localized source.

<h3>Fluctuation of a bilayer composed by surfactants</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Shunta Kikuchi, Hiroshi Watanabe</i>
<p>We investigated the properties of lipid bilayer fluctuations using molecular
dynamics. We modeled the surfactant as a diatomic molecule, constructed a
bilayer in the solvent, and observed the Fourier spectrum of its fluctuations.
The results showed that $q^4$ behavior was dominant at the high temperature,
whereas a crossover from $q^4$ to $q^2$ was observed at the low temperature.
This behavior is complementary to the results for monolayer membranes, where
$q^2$ behavior was dominant when the interfacial tension was high, whereas a
crossover from $q^2$ to $q^4$ was observed when the interfacial tension was
lowered~[S. Kikuchi and H. Watanabe, J. Chem. Phys., $\bm{158}$ 12 (2023)].
These results suggest that the restoring force is dominated by elasticity at
high temperatures and by interfacial tension at low temperatures. We also
observed radial distribution functions to investigate the structure of
surfactants in lipid bilayers. The structure of the surfactant depends on
temperature in the direction horizontal to the interface, while it does not
depend on temperature in the direction perpendicular to the interface. This
result suggests that lipid bilayers increase fluctuations while maintaining the
membrane structure in high temperature.

<h3>Emergent Non-Abelian Thouless Pumping Induced by the Quasiperiodic  Disorder</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18491" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18491</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sen Huang, Yan-Qing Zhu, Zhi Li</i>
<p>We investigate the non-Abelian Thouless pumping in a disorder tunable Lieb
chain with degenerate flat bands. The results reveal that quasiperiodic
disorder will cause a topological phase transition from the trivial (without
non-Abelian Thouless pumping) to the non-trivial (with non-Abelian Thouless
pumping) phase. The mechanism behind is that the monopole originally outside
the topological region can be driven into the topological region due to the
introduction of quasiperiodic disorder. Moreover, since the corresponding
monopole will turn into a nodal line to spread beyond the boundaries of the
topological region, the system with large disorder strength will result in the
disappearance of non-Abelian Thouless pumping. Furthermore, we numerically
simulate the Thouless pumping of non-Abelian systems, and the evolution results
of center of mass' displacement are consistent with the Chern number. Finally,
we discuss the localization properties of the system and find that, similar to
[PRL 130, 206401(2023)], the inverse Anderson transition does not occur in the
system with the increase of quasiperiodic strength, while the system still
maintains the coexistence of localized and extended states.

calculations we explore the superconductivity and ferroelectric properties in
fluorinated 2D Nb2N. H3-Nb2NF2 breaks the spatial inversion symmetry,
exhibiting vertical ferroelectric and metallic properties. More interesting, it
not only possesses intrinsic superconductivity with Tc of 10 K, but also
exhibits nontrivial band topology. While, H1-Nb2NF2, which contains the
inversion symmetry, shows the highest Tc of 32 K, surpassing most of
superconductors with nontrivial band topological properties. Our research has
enriched 2D superconducting materials with nontrivial band topology and
ferroelectric properties, and provided a theoretical basis for the preparation
of devices switching between superconducting and ferroelectric states with

microwave field. We give a complete characterization of the topological
properties from both the single-particle and many-body aspect. The periodic
driving results in richer topological phases. At the single-particle level, we
calculate the real space winding numbers and polarization, confirming robust
amorphous topological phases with 0-type and $\pi$-type edge modes. We show a
structural disorder induced topological phase transition acompanied with
localization transition in the nonequilibrium system. Furthermore, in the
many-body case we find the existence of amorphous topological orders of the
hardcore bosons half-filled the chain, in contrast described by the topological
entanglement entropy and the string order. Possible detection methods are also
addressed.

<p>Ouzo is a well-known drink in Mediterranean countries, with ingredients
water, alcohol and trans-anethole oil. The oil is insoluble in water, but
completely soluble in alcohol, so when water is added to the spirit, the
available alcohol is depleted and the mixture exhibits spontaneous
emulsification. This process is commonly known as the louche or Ouzo effect.
Although the phase boundaries of this archetypal ternary mixture are well
known, the properties of coexisting phases have not previously been studied.
Here, we present a detailed experimental investigation into the phase
behaviour, including tie-lines connecting coexisting phases, determination of
the critical point (also called the plait point in ternary systems) and
measurements of the surface tension and density for varying alcohol
concentrations. Additionally, we present a theory for the thermodynamics and
phase diagram of the system. With suitable selection of the interaction
parameters, the theory captures nearly all features of the experimental work.
This simple model can be used to determine both bulk and non-uniform (e.g.
interfacial) properties, paving the way for a wide range of future applications
of the model to ternary mixtures in general. We show how our accurate
equilibrium phase diagram can be used to provide improved understanding of
non-equilibrium phenomena.

<p>We numerically study the relaxation dynamics of impurity-host systems,
focusing on the presence of long-lived metastable states in the non-equilibrium
dynamics after an initial excitation of the impurities. In generic systems, an
excited impurity coupled to a large bath at zero temperature is expected to
relax and approach its ground state over time. However, certain exceptional
cases exhibit metastability, where the system remains in an excited state on
timescales largely exceeding the typical relaxation time. We study this
phenomenon for three prototypical impurity models: a tight-binding quantum
model of independent spinless fermions on a lattice with two stub impurities, a
classical-spin Heisenberg model with two weakly coupled classical impurity
spins, and a tight-binding quantum model of independent electrons with two
classical impurity spins. Through numerical integration of the fundamental
equations of motion, we find that all three models exhibit similar qualitative
behavior: complete relaxation for nearest-neighbor impurities and incomplete or
strongly delayed relaxation for next-nearest-neighbor impurities. The
underlying mechanisms leading to this behavior differ between models and
include impurity-induced bound states, emergent approximately conserved local
observables, and exact cancellation of local and nonlocal dissipation effects.

<h3>Scheme for braiding Majorana zero modes in vortices using an STT-matrix</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18578" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18578</a>
<br>
</p><i>Guangyao Huang, Xinfang Zhang, Xiapfeng Yi, Jibang Fu, Weichen Wang, Mingtang Deng</i>
<p>Recently conducted experiments on two-dimensional topological superconductors
have revealed various indications of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However,
progress in the manipulation of MZM braiding has been limited, impeding the
realization of topological quantum computing. In this study, we propose a
potential braiding scheme based on a spintronic device matrix. This scheme
involves utilizing a matrix composed of spin-transfer torque devices
(STT-matrix) alongside a two-dimensional topological superconductor material.
By programming the ON/OFF states of the spintronic devices within the
STT-matrix, it becomes possible to manipulate vortices hosting MZMs in the
two-dimensional topological superconductor. To further investigate this
concept, we construct a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model and perform
numerical simulations to analyze vortex-driving dynamics, MZM braiding
processes, and MZM fusion phenomena. Our findings demonstrate that this system
exhibits high versatility and flexibility in manipulating vortices. With
advancements in spintronic device technology, our proposed scheme offers a
feasible and practical method for operating MZMs within vortices present in
topological superconductors.

<h3>A statistical analysis of the first stages of freezing and melting of  Lennard-Jones particles: Number and size distributions of transient nuclei</h3>

</p><i>Patrice Porion, Joël Puibasset</i>
<p>The freezing/melting transition is at the heart of many natural and
industrial processes. In the classical picture, the transition proceeds via the
nucleation of the new phase, which has to overcome a barrier associated to the
free energy cost of the growing nucleus. The total nucleation rate is also
influenced by a kinetic factor which somehow depends on the number of attempts
to create a nucleus, that translates into a significant density of proto-nuclei
in the system. These transient tiny nuclei are not accessible to experiments,
but they can be observed in molecular simulations, and their number and size
distributions can be acquired and analysed. The number distributions are
carefully characterized as a function of the system size, showing limited
finite size effects. It is also shown that the proto-nuclei do exist even in
the stable phase, in agreement with the fact that the volume contribution to
their free energy is negligible in the first stages of nucleation. Moreover,
the number and size distributions vary continuously between the stable and the
metastable phases, in particular when crossing the coexistence temperature. The
size distributions associated to \emph{any} nucleus and to the \emph{largest}
one have also been calculated, and their relation recently established for
bubbles in a liquid [J. Puibasset, J. Chem. Phys. 157, 191102 (2022)] has been
shown to apply here. This is an important relation for free energy barrier
calculations with biased molecular simulations.

<h3>Two-dimensional correlation propagation dynamics with a cluster discrete  phase-space method</h3>

</p><i>Kazuma Nagao, Seiji Yunoki</i>
<p>Nonequilibrium dynamics of highly-controlled quantum systems is a challenging
issue in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics, relevant to recent
experimental developments of analog and digital quantum simulations. In this
work, we develop a discrete phase-space approach for general SU($N$) spin
systems that utilizes cluster mean field equations, which capture non-trivial
quantum correlations inside each cluster, beyond the capability of the standard
discrete truncated Wigner approximation for individual classical spins. Our
formalism, based on a cluster phase-point operator, makes it possible to
realize scalable numerical samplings of cluster phase-space variables, where
the total number of noise variables for a direct product state is independent
of the choice of the separation into finite regions of clusters. We numerically
demonstrate that the cluster discrete truncated Wigner approximation (C-dTWA)
method can reproduce key results in a recent experiment on the correlation
propagation dynamics in a two dimensional Bose-Hubbard system. We also compare
the results of C-dTWA for clusters of $2\times 2$ sites with those of a
two-dimensional tensor network method and discuss that both approaches agree
very well in a short time region, where the energy is well conserved in the
tensor network simulations. Since we formulate the C-dTWA method in a general
form, it can be potentially applied to various dynamical problems in isolated
and open quantum systems even in higher dimensions.

<p>The Kagome network is a unique platform in solid state physics that harbors a
diversity of special electronic states due to its inherent band structure
features comprising Dirac cones, van-Hove singularities, and flat bands. Some
Kagome-based non-magnetic metals have recently been found to exhibit favorable
properties, including unconventional superconductivity, charge density waves
(CDW), switchable chiral transport, and signatures of an anomalous Hall effect
(AHE). The Kagome metal ScV6Sn6 is another promising candidate for studying the
emergence of an unconventional CDW and accompanying effects. We use 51V nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) to study the local properties of the CDW phase in
single crystalline ScV6Sn6, aided by density functional theory (DFT). We trace
the dynamics of the local magnetic field during the CDW phase transition and
determine a loss in the density of states (DOS) by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$, in
excellent agreement with DFT. The local charge symmetry of the V surrounding in
the CDW phase reflects the commensurate modulation of the charge density with
wave vector q=(1/3,1/3,1/3). An unusual orientation dependent change in the NMR
shift splitting symmetry, however, reveals orbital selective modulations of the
local DOS.

<p>Brain-like self-assembled networks can infer and analyze information out of
unorganized noisy signals with minimal power consumption. These networks are
characterized by spatiotemporal avalanches and their crackling behavior, and
their physical models are expected to predict and understand their
computational capabilities. Here, we use a network theory-based approach to
provide a physical model for percolative tunnelling networks, found in Ag-hBN
system, consisting of nodes (atomic clusters) of Ag intercalated in the hBN van
der Waals layers. By modeling a single edge plasticity through constitutive
electrochemical filament formation, and annihilation through Joule heating, we
identify independent parameters that determine the network connectivity. We
construct a phase diagram and show that a small region of the parameter space
contains signals which are long-range temporally correlated, and only a subset
of them contains crackling avalanche dynamics. Physical systems spontaneously
selforganize to this region for possibly maximizing the efficiency of
information transfer.

<h3>Statistical formulation of Onsager-Machlup variational principle</h3>

</p><i>Kento Yasuda, Kenta Ishimoto, Shigeyuki Komura</i>
<p>Onsager's variational principle (OVP) provides us with a systematic way to
derive dynamical equations for various soft matter and active matter. By
reformulating the Onsager-Machlup variational principle (OMVP), which is a
time-global principle, we propose a new method to incorporate thermal
fluctuations. To demonstrate the utility of the statistical formulation of OMVP
(SOMVP), we obtain the diffusion constant of a Brownian particle embedded in a
viscous fluid only by maximizing the modified Onsager-Machlup integral for the
surrounding fluid. We also apply our formulation to a Brownian particle in a
steady shear flow, which is a typical example of a non-equilibrium system.
Possible extensions of our formulation to internally driven active systems are
discussed.

<h3>Nonlinear Superconducting Magnetoelectric Effect</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Jin-Xin Hu, Oles Matsyshyn, Justin C. W. Song</i>
<p>A supercurrent flow can induce a nonvanishing spin magnetization in
noncentrosymmetric superconductors with spin-orbit interaction. Often known as
the non-dissipative magnetoelectric effect, these are most commonly found at
linear order in supercurrent flow. Here, we argue that a nonlinear
superconducting magnetoelectric effect (NSM) can naturally manifest in
altermagnet/superconductor (ALM/SC) heterostructures: NSM manifests as a spin
polarization generated as a second-order response to a driving supercurrent.
Strikingly, we find NSM is the leading order magnetization response in ALM/SC
heterostructures and survives even in the presence of centrosymmetry; $C_4
\mathcal{T}$ symmetry in altermagnets zeroes both the equilibrium magnetization
as well as out-of-plane linear magnetoelectric response. This renders NSM a
powerful electric and non-dissipative means of controlling magnetization in
ALM/SC heterostructures, a promising platform for superconducting spintronics.

<p>Ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals exhibit unique non-linear optical
properties, with the potential to become transformative materials for photonic
applications. A promising direction relies on the fabrication of tailored polar
orientational patterns via photoalignment, thus shaping the non-linear optical
susceptibility through thin slabs of the ferroelectric fluid. Here, we explore
the fabrication of 2D periodic SHG active arrays in ferroelectric nematic
fluids, for different materials, cell thicknesses and motifs. Based on
polarizing optical microscopy observations in combination with optical
simulations, second harmonic generation microscopy and interferometry, the 3D
structure of the motifs are revealed. Two different 2D periodic patterns are
explored, showing that the balance between flexoelectric and electrostatic
energy can lead to different domain structures, an effect which is rooted in
the difference between the flexoelectric properties of the materials. It is
shown that by combining the surface-inscribed alignment with different
spontaneous degrees of twist, 2D SHG active arrays can be obtained in the
micrometre scale, in which adjacent areas exhibit maximum SHG signals at
opposite angles.

<p>Polarized X-rays allow for imaging birefringent or dichroic properties of
materials with nanometric resolution. To disentangle these properties from the
electronic density, either a polarization analyzer or several measurements with
different polarizations (typically two, or more) are needed. Here we
demonstrate that ptychography can disentangle these from a single-polarization
measurement by using a multimodal analysis. This new method provides an
alternative to obtain polarization-resolved images of a sample when
manipulating the incident polarization is not possible nor sufficient.

<h3>A comprehensive study of nonlinear perturbations in the dynamics of  planar crack fronts</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Itamar Kolvin, Mokhtar Adda-Bedia</i>
<p>The interaction of crack fronts with asperities is central to the criteria of
fracture in heterogeneous materials and for the prediction of fracture surface
formation. It is known how dynamic crack fronts respond to small, 1st-order,
perturbations. Large and localized disturbances to crack motion, however,
induce dynamic and geometric nonlinear effects that are beyond the existing
linear theories. Because the determination of the 3D elastic fields surrounding
perturbed crack fronts is a necessary step towards any theoretical study of
crack front dynamics, we develop a 2nd-order perturbation theory for the
asymptotic fields of planar crack fronts. Based on previous work, we consider
two models of fracture. In the so-called scalar elastic model, which is
analogous to anti-plane (Mode III) fracture, the stress and displacement fields
are obtained through matched asymptotic expansions. A self-consistent expansion
is used to resolve the fields near tensile (Mode I) crack fronts. Both methods
can be extended to higher perturbation orders. The main results of this work
are the explicit 2nd-order expressions of the local dynamic
energy-release-rates for perturbations of straight fronts. These general
formulae recover the known energy-release-rates of curved quasi-static fronts
and of straight dynamic fronts.

<h3>Decoherence induced by a sparse bath of two-level fluctuators: peculiar  features of $1/f$ noise in high-quality qubits</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18659" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18659</a>
<br>
</p><i>M. Mehmandoost, V. V. Dobrovitski</i>
<p>Progress in fabrication of semiconductor and superconductor qubits has
greatly diminished the number of decohering defects, thus decreasing the
devastating low-frequency $1/f$ noise and extending the qubits' coherence times
(dephasing time $T_2^*$ and the echo decay time $T_2$). However, large
qubit-to-qubit variation of the coherence properties remains a problem, making
it difficult to produce a large-scale register where all qubits have a
uniformly high quality. In this work we show that large variability is a
characteristic feature of a qubit dephased by a sparse bath made of many ($n\gg
1$) decohering defects, coupled to the qubit with similar strength. We model
the defects as two-level fluctuators (TLFs) whose transition rates $\gamma$ are
sampled from a log-uniform distribution over an interval
$[\gamma_{m},\gamma_M]$, which is a standard model for $1/f$ noise. We
investigate decoherence by such a bath in the limit of high-quality qubit,
i.e.\ when the TLF density $d$ is small (the limit of sparse bath, with
$d=n/w\ll 1$, where $n$ is the number of TLFs and
$w=\ln{[\gamma_M/\gamma_{m}]}$ is the log-width of the distribution). We show
that different realizations of the bath produce very similar noise power
spectra $S(f)\sim 1/f$, but lead to drastically different coherence times
$T_2^*$ and $T_2$. Thus, the spectral density $S(f)$ does not determine
coherence of a qubit coupled to a sparse TLF bath, as opposed to a dense bath;
instead, decoherence is controlled by only a few exceptional fluctuators,
determined by their value of $\gamma$. We show that removing only two of these
TLFs greatly increases $T_2$ and $T_2^*$ times. Our findings help theoretical
understanding and further improvements in the coherence properties of
semiconductor and superconductor qubits, battling the $1/f$ noise in these
platforms.

</p><i>Fatemeh Haghsheno, Mohammad Mehrafarin</i>
<p>The emergence of order from initial disordered movement in self-propelled
collective motion is an instance of nonequilibrium phase transition, which is
known to be first order in the thermodynamic limit. Here, we introduce a
multiplicative scalar noise model of collective motion as a modification of the
original Vicsek model, which more closely mimics the particles' behavior. We
allow for more individual movement in sparsely populated neighborhoods, the
mechanism of which is not incorporated in the original Vicsek model. This is
especially important in the low velocity and density regime where the
probability of a clear neighborhood is relatively high. The modification, thus,
removes the shortcoming of the Vicsek model in predicting continuous phase
transition in this regime. The onset of collective motion in the proposed model
is numerically studied in detail, indicating a first order phase transition in
both high and low velocity/density regimes for systems with comparatively
smaller size which is computationally desirable.

<p>A large number of osmium complexes with osmium in different oxidation states
(II, III, IV, VI) have been reported recently to exhibit good antiproliferative

by $^{187}$Os nuclear forward scattering (NFS) and nuclear inelastic scattering
(NIS) of synchrotron radiation for characterization of hyperfine interactions
and lattice dynamics in a benchmark Os(VI) complex K$_2$[OsO$_2$(OH)$_4$], by
accurate extraction of M\"ossbauer parameters and the determination of
Os-projected density of phonon states confirmed by first-principles phonon
calculations. The values of isomer shift ($\delta$ = 3.3(1) mm/s) relative to
[Os$^{IV}$ Cl$_{6}$]$^{2-}$ and quadrupole splitting ($\Delta E_Q$ = 12.0(2)
mm/s) were determined with NFS, while the Lamb-M\"ossbauer factor (0.55(1)),
the density of phonon states (DOS), and a full thermodynamics characterization
was carried out using the NIS data combined with first principle theoretical
calculations. In more general terms, this study provides strong evidence that
$^{187}$Os nuclear resonance scattering is a reliable technique for the
investigation of hyperfine interactions and Os specific vibrations in
osmium(VI) species, which might be potentially applicable for measuring such
interactions in osmium complexes of other oxidation states, including those
with anticancer activity such as Os(III) and Os(IV).

<p>To realize large-scale quantum information processes, an ideal scheme for
two-qubit operations should enable diverse operations with given hardware and
physical interaction. However, for spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots,
the common two-qubit operations, including CPhase gates, SWAP gates, and CROT
gates, are realized with distinct parameter regions and control waveforms,
posing challenges for their simultaneous implementation. Here, taking advantage
of the inherent Heisenberg interaction between spin qubits, we propose and
verify a fast composite two-qubit gate scheme to extend the available two-qubit
gate types as well as reduce the requirements for device properties. Apart from
the formerly proposed CPhase (controlled-phase) gates and SWAP gates,
theoretical results indicate that the iSWAP-family gate and Fermionic
simulation (fSim) gate set are additionally available for spin qubits.
Meanwhile, our gate scheme limits the parameter requirements of all essential
two-qubit gates to a common J~{\Delta}E_Z region, facilitate the simultaneous
realization of them. Furthermore, we present the preliminary experimental
demonstration of the composite gate scheme, observing excellent match between
the measured and simulated results. With this versatile composite gate scheme,
broad-spectrum two-qubit operations allow us to efficiently utilize the
hardware and the underlying physics resources, helping accelerate and broaden

<p>We investigate the precision of the numerical implementation of the

$O(\partial^2)$ orders of the derivative expansion for the three-dimensional
$O(N)$ models with $N~\in~\{1,2,3\}$. We identify several categories of
numerical error and devise simple tests to track their magnitude as functions
of numerical parameters. Our numerical schemes converge properly and are
characterized by errors of several orders of magnitude smaller than the error
bars of the derivative expansion for these models. We highlight situations in
which our methods cease to converge, most often due to rounding errors. In
particular, we observe an impaired convergence of the discretization scheme
when the $\tilde \rho$ grid is cut off at the value $\tilde \rho_{\text{Max}}$
smaller than $3.5$ times the local potential minimum. The program performing
the numerical calculations for this study is shared as an open-source library

<p>This work investigates the effects of complex networks on the collective
behavior of a three-state opinion formation model in economic systems. Our
model considers two distinct types of investors in financial markets: noise
traders and fundamentalists. Financial states evolve via probabilistic dynamics
that include economic strategies with local and global influences. The local
majoritarian opinion drives noise traders' market behavior, while the market
index influences the financial decisions of fundamentalist agents. We introduce
a level of market anxiety $q$ present in the decision-making process that
influences financial action. In our investigation, nodes of a complex network
represent market agents, whereas the links represent their financial
interactions. We investigate the stochastic dynamics of the model on three
distinct network topologies, including scale-free networks, small-world
networks and Erd{\"o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. Our model mirrors various traits
observed in real-world financial return series, such as heavy-tailed return
distributions, volatility clustering, and short-term memory correlation of
returns. The histograms of returns are fitted by coupled Gaussian
distributions, quantitatively revealing transitions from a leptokurtic to a
mesokurtic regime under specific economic heterogeneity. We show that the
market dynamics depend mainly on the average agent connectivity, anxiety level,
and market composition rather than on specific features of network topology.

akin to the Spin Hall angle ({\theta}_SH), to explain AIOHE. This work pioneers
converting spin-orbital currents into charge current, advancing the

<p>Doped van der Waals heterostructures host layer-hybridized trions, i.e.
charged excitons with layer-delocalized constituents holding promise for highly

the trion energy landscape in naturally stacked WSe$_2$ bilayers. We show that
an out-of-plane electric field modifies the energetic ordering of the lowest
lying trion states, which consist of layer-hybridized $\Lambda$-point electrons
and layer-localized K-point holes. At small fields, intralayer-like trions
yield distinct PL signatures in opposite doping regimes characterized by weak
Stark shifts in both cases. Above a doping-asymmetric critical field,
interlayer-like species are energetically favored and produce PL peaks with a
pronounced Stark red-shift and a counter-intuitively large intensity arising
from efficient phonon-assisted recombination. Our work presents an important
step forward in the microscopic understanding of layer-hybridized trions in van

<p>In graphite, a moderate magnetic field confines electrons and holes into
their lowest Landau levels. In the extreme quantum limit, two insulating states
with a dome-like field dependence of the their critical temperatures are
induced by the magnetic field. Here, we study the evolution of the first dome
(below 60 T) under hydrostatic pressure up to 1.7 GPa. With increasing
pressure, the field-temperature phase boundary shifts towards higher magnetic
fields, yet the maximum critical temperature remains unchanged. According to
our fermiology data, pressure amplifies the density and the effective mass of
hole-like and electron-like carriers. Thanks to this information, we verify the
persistent relevance of the BCS relation between the critical temperature and
the density of states in the weak-coupling boundary of the dome. In contrast,
the strong-coupling summit of the dome does not show any detectable change with
pressure. We argue that this is because the out-of-plane BCS coherence length
approaches the interplane distance that shows little change with pressure.
Thus, the BCS-BEC crossover is tunable by magnetic field and pressure, but with
a locked summit.

<p>The prototypical $\alpha\to\omega$ phase transition in zirconium is an ideal
test-bed for our understanding of polymorphism under extreme loading
conditions. After half a century of study, a consensus had emerged that the
transition is realized via one of two distinct displacive mechanisms, depending
on the nature of the compression path. However, recent dynamic-compression
experiments equipped with in situ diffraction diagnostics performed in the past
few years have revealed new transition mechanisms, demonstrating that our
understanding of the underlying atomistic dynamics and transition kinetics is
in fact far from complete. We present classical molecular dynamics simulations
of the $\alpha\to\omega$ phase transition in single-crystal zirconium
shock-compressed along the [0001] axis using a machine-learning-class
potential. The transition is predicted to proceed primarily via a modified
version of the two-stage Usikov-Zilberstein mechanism, whereby the
high-pressure $\omega$-phase heterogeneously nucleates at boundaries between
grains of an intermediate $\beta$-phase. We further observe the fomentation of
atomistic disorder at the junctions between $\beta$ grains, leading to the
formation of highly defective interstitial material between the $\omega$
grains. We directly compare synthetic x-ray diffraction patterns generated from
our simulations with those obtained using femtosecond diffraction in recent
dynamic-compression experiments, and show that the simulations produce the same
unique, anisotropic diffuse scattering signal unlike any previously seen from
an elemental metal. Our simulations suggest that the diffuse signal arises from
a combination of thermal diffuse scattering, nanoparticle-like scattering from
residual kinetically stabilized $\alpha$ and $\beta$ grains, and scattering
from interstitial defective structures.

</p><i>Vimal Palanivelrajan, Joaquín E. Drut</i>
<p>We explore a generalization of nonrelativistic fermionic statistics that
interpolates between bosons and fermions, in which up to $K$ particles may
occupy a single-particle state. We show that it can be mapped exactly to $K$
flavors of fermions with imaginary polarization. In particular, for $K\!=\!2$,
we use such a mapping to derive the virial coefficients and relate them to
those of conventional spin-1/2 fermions in an exact fashion. We also use the
mapping to derive next-to-leading-order perturbative results for the pressure
equation of state. Our results indicate that the $K\!=\!2$ particles are more
strongly coupled than conventional spin-$1/2$ fermions, as measured by the
interaction effects on the virial expansion and on the pressure equation of
state. In the regime set by the unitary limit, the proposed $K\!=\!2$
deformation represents a universal many-body system whose properties remain
largely unknown. In particular, the system can be expected to become superfluid
at a critical temperature $T_c$ higher than that of the unitary limit. We
suggest it may be possible to realize this system experimentally by engineering
a polarized coupling to an electrostatic potential. Finally, we show that the
$K\!=\!2$ system does not display a sign problem for determinantal Monte Carlo
calculations, which indicates that $T_c$ can at least in principle be
calculated with conventional methods.

<h3>Unveiling the Impact of B-site Distribution on the Frustration Effect in  Double Perovskite Ca2FeReO6 Using Monte Carlo Simulation and Molecular Field  Theory</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18748" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18748</a>
<br>
</p><i>Guoqing Liu, Jiajun Mo, Zeyi Lu, Qinghang Zhang, Puyue Xia, Min Liu</i>
<p>This work systematically investigates the spin glass behavior of the double
perovskite Ca2FeReO6. Building on previous studies, we have developed a formula
to quantify the ions distribution at B-site, incorporating the next-nearest
neighbor interactions. Employing molecular field theory and Monte Carlo
simulations, the influence of various arrangements of two B-site ions on
frustration effects was uncovered. B-site is segmented into a and b-site,
defining the number of nearest neighbors from Fea to Feb (and vice versa) as
Zx(Zy). The significant frustration effects occur when 1<Zx(or Zy)<3, with Zx
is not equal to Zy and also when Zx(or Zy) ~ 3 while Zy(or Zx) ~ 4. All of
these are reflected in the variations observed in ground state magnetization
and the Thermal Energy Step relation to Zx and Zy. The model proposed in this
work can be applied to most B-site disordered in perovskite systems and even to
other chemically disordered in frustrated systems.

<h3>Self-training superconducting neuromorphic circuits using reinforcement  learning rules</h3>

<br>
</p><i>M. L. Schneider, E. M. Jué, M. R. Pufall, K. Segall, C. W. Anderson</i>
<p>Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in a wide range of applications,
from gaming and robotics to autonomous vehicles. In this paper we describe a
set of reinforcement learning-based local weight update rules and their
implementation in superconducting hardware. Using SPICE circuit simulations, we
implement a small-scale neural network with a learning time of order one
nanosecond. This network can be trained to learn new functions simply by
changing the target output for a given set of inputs, without the need for any
external adjustments to the network. In this implementation the weights are
adjusted based on the current state of the overall network response and locally
stored information about the previous action. This removes the need to program
explicit weight values in these networks, which is one of the primary
challenges that analog hardware implementations of neural networks face. The
adjustment of weights is based on a global reinforcement signal that obviates
the need for circuitry to back-propagate errors.

<h3>Photo-induced insulator-metal transition in paramagnetic  (V$_{1-x}$Cr$_{x}$)$_2$O$_3$</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18819" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18819</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jiyu Chen, Francesco Petocchi, Viktor Christiansson, Philipp Werner</i>
<p>Pump-probe experiments with femtosecond time resolution allow to disentangle
the electronic dynamics from the lattice response and thus provide valuable
insights into the non-equilibrium behavior of correlated materials. In Cr-doped
V$_2$O$_3$, a multi-orbital Mott-Hubbard material which has been intensively
investigated for decades, time-resolved experiments reported a photo-induced
insulator-metal transition leading to a transient metal state with nonthermal
properties. Here, we combine non-equilibrium dynamical mean-field theory with
realistic first principles modeling to simulate the ultrafast response of this
material to a laser excitation. Our calculations reproduce the insulating
initial state, with orbital occupations in agreement with experiment, and
reveal an ultrafast pump-induced gap filling associated with a charge
reshuffling between the $e_g^\pi$ and $a_{1g}$ orbitals. However, in contrast
to the related compound VO$_2$, the electronic system thermalizes within a few
tens of femtoseconds and we find no evidence for the existence of a metastable
nonthermal metal. This suggests that the reported nonthermal behavior in the
experiments may be associated with the mismatch between the electronic and
lattice temperatures.

<h3>Extreme fragmentation of a Bose gas</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18827" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18827</a>
<br>
</p><i>Nathan Dupont, Amit Vashisht, Nathan Goldman</i>
<p>Fragmentation of an interacting Bose gas refers to the macroscopic occupation
of a finite set of single-particle eigenstates. This phenomenon is related to
the notion of particle-number squeezing in quantum optics, an exquisite
property of quantum states that can offer metrological gain. So far,
fragmentation has only been partially achieved in experiments involving a large
number $N$ of bosons in few modes. Here, we introduce a practical and efficient
scheme to prepare fragmented states in systems realizing the $L$-mode
Bose-Hubbard model. We demonstrate how a large energy detuning between the
modes can be used as a practical control parameter to successfully fragment a
Bose gas over an extremely short preparation time. Applying an optimal-control
approach within realistic experimental constraints, we obtain total
fragmentation at a high filling factor, realizing $\ket{N/L,...,N/L}$ Fock
states with hundreds of bosons in very few modes over a few tunneling times.

<h3>Correlated Electron Effects in Chromium Trihalide Hetostructures with  Graphene: A Tight-Binding Model Perspective</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18858" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18858</a>
<br>
</p><i>Igor Rozhansky, Vladimir Fal'ko</i>
<p>In this study, we present an effective tight-binding model for an accurate
description of the lowest energy quadruplet of conduction band in a
ferromagnetic CrX$_3$ monolayer, tuned to the complementary \textit{ab initio}
density functional theory simulations. This model, based on a minimum number of
chromium orbitals, captures a distinctively flat dispersion in those bands but
requires taking into account hoppings beyond nearest neighbours, revealing
ligand-mediated electron pathways connecting remote chromium sites. Doping of
states in the lowest conduction band of CrX$_3$ requires charge transfer,
which, according to recent studies, can occur in graphene(G)/CrX$_3$
heterostructures. Here, we use the detailed description of the lowest
conduction band in CrI$_3$ to show that G/CrI$_3$/G and G/CrI$_3$ are type-II
heterostructures where light holes in graphene would coexist with heavy
electrons in the magnetic layer, where the latter can be characterised by
Wigner parameter $r_s\sim 15-20$ (as estimated for hBN-encapsulated
structures).

<h3>Avalanche Dynamics and the Effect of Straining in Dislocation Systems  with Quenched Disorder</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18871" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18871</a>
<br>
</p><i>Dénes Berta, Barna Mendei, Péter Dusán Ispánovity</i>
<p>The plastic deformation of crystalline and other heterogeneous materials
often manifests in stochastic intermittent events indicating the criticality of
plastic behavior. Previous studies demonstrated that the presence of
short-ranged quenched disorder modifies this behavior disrupting long-range
static and dynamic correlations consequently localizing dislocation avalanches.
However, these observations were mostly confined to relaxed materials devoid of
deformation history. In this work our focus is on how straining affects static
and dynamic correlations, avalanche dynamics and local yield stresses. We
demonstrate that the interplay between severe straining and confining quenched
disorder induces critical behavior characterized by dislocation avalanches
distinct from those at lower stresses. Namely, near the flow stress many
avalanches, even if triggered locally, evolve into events affecting a larger
region by exciting small clusters of dislocations all around the sample. This
type of avalanches differ from the ones at low strains where plastic events
typically consist of one compact cluster of dislocations which is either local
or it is already quite extended at the onset of the avalanche. Furthermore, we
examine the impact of avalanches on local yield stresses. It is shown in detail
in this work that while some statistical features of the local yield thresholds
are robust to straining, others are significantly affected by the deformation
history.

<h3>High-performance gate-controlled superconducting switches: large output  voltage and reproducibility</h3>

</p><i>Leon Ruf, Elke Scheer, Angelo Di Bernardo</i>
<p>Logic circuits consist of devices that can be controlled between two distinct
states. The recent demonstration that a superconducting current flowing in a
constriction can be controlled via a gate voltage ($V_G$) - can lead to
superconducting logic with better performance than existing logics. However,
before such logic is developed, high reproducibility in the functioning of GCS
devices and optimization of their performance must be achieved. Here, we report
an investigation of gated Nb devices showing GCS with unprecedently-high
reproducibility. Based on the investigation of a statistically-significant
number of devices, we demonstrate that the GCS is independent of the
constriction width, in contrast with previous reports, and confirm a strong
correlation between the GCS and the leakage current ($I_{leak}$) induced by
$V_G$. We also achieve a voltage output in our devices larger than the typical
values reported to date by at least one order of magnitude, which is relevant
for the future interconnection of devices, and show that $I_{leak}$ can be used
as a tool to modulate the operational $V_G$ of devices on a $SiO_2$ substrates.
These results altogether represent an important step forward towards the
optimization of reproducibility and performance of GCS devices, and the future
development of a GCS-based logic.

<h3>Interaction driven topological phase transitions of hardcore bosons on a  two-leg ladder</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18912" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18912</a>
<br>
</p><i>Rajashri Parida, Ashirbad Padhan, Tapan Mishra</i>
<p>We investigate the topological properties of hardcore bosons possessing
nearest-neighbor repulsive interactions on a two-leg ladder. We show that by
allowing dimerized interactions instead of hopping dimerization, the system
exhibits topological phases and phase transitions under proper conditions.
First, by assuming uniform hopping throughout the ladder, we show that when
interaction along the legs are dimerized and the dimerization pattern is
different in the legs, a trivial rung-Mott insulator to a topological bond
order phase transition occurs as a function of the dimerization strength.
However, for a fixed dimerization strength, the system exhibits a topological
to trivial phase transition with increase in the rung hopping. A completely
different scenario appears when the rung interaction is turned on. We obtain
that for a ladder with uniform hopping, the repulsive interaction either turns
the topological phase into a trivial rung-Mott insulator or a charge density
wave phase. Such feature is absent when the dimerization pattern in the nearest
neighbour interaction is considered to be identical in both the legs of the
ladder. We numerically obtain the ground state properties and show the
signatures of topological phase transition through Thouless charge pumping.

<p>Polar molecules confined in an optical lattice are a versatile platform to
explore spin-motion dynamics based on strong, long-range dipolar interactions.
The precise tunability of Ising and spin-exchange interactions with both
microwave and dc electric fields makes the molecular system particularly
suitable for engineering complex many-body dynamics. Here, we used Floquet
engineering to realize interesting quantum many-body systems of polar
molecules. Using a spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states of
ultracold KRb molecules, we mutually validated XXZ spin models tuned by a
Floquet microwave pulse sequence against those tuned by a dc electric field
through observations of Ramsey contrast dynamics, setting the stage for the
realization of Hamiltonians inaccessible with static fields. In particular, we
observed two-axis twisting mean-field dynamics, generated by a
Floquet-engineered XYZ model using itinerant molecules in 2D layers. In the
future, Floquet-engineered Hamiltonians could generate entangled states for
molecule-based precision measurement or could take advantage of the rich
molecular structure for quantum simulation of multi-level systems.

<h3>Colloidal dispersions of sterically and electrostatically stabilized PbS  quantum dots: the effect of stabilization mechanism on structure factors,  second virial coefficients, and film-forming properties</h3>

<p>Electrostatically stabilized nanocrystals (NCs) and, in particular, quantum
dots (QDs) hold promise for forming strongly coupled superlattices due to their
compact and electronically conductive surface ligands. However, studies on the
colloidal dispersion and interparticle interactions of electrostatically
stabilized sub-10 nm NCs have been limited, hindering the optimization of
colloidal stability and self-assembly. In this study, we employed small-angle X
ray scattering (SAXS) experiments to investigate the interparticle interactions
and arrangement of PbS QDs with thiostannate ligands (PbS-Sn2S64-) in polar
solvents. The study reveals significant deviations from ideal solution behavior
in electrostatically stabilized QD dispersions. Our results demonstrate that
PbS-Sn2S64- QDs exhibit long-range interactions within the solvent, in contrast
to the short-range steric repulsion characteristic of PbS QDs with oleate
ligands (PbS-OA). Introducing highly charged multivalent electrolytes screens
electrostatic interactions between charged QDs, reducing the length scale of
the repulsive interactions. Furthermore, we calculate the second virial (B2)
coefficients from SAXS data, providing insights into how surface chemistry,
solvent, and size influence pair potentials. Finally, we explore the influence
of long-range interparticle interactions of PbS-Sn2S64- QDs on the morphology
of films produced by drying or spin-coating colloidal solutions. The long-range
repulsive term of PbS-Sn2S64- QDs promotes the formation of amorphous films,
and screening the electrostatic repulsion by addition of an electrolyte enables
the formation of a crystalline film. These findings highlight the critical role
of NC-NC interactions in tailoring the properties of functional nanomaterials.

<p>Long-range and anisotropic dipolar interactions profoundly modify the
dynamics of particles hopping in a periodic lattice potential. Here, we report
the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a
system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest
rotational states. We systematically explore the role of dipolar Ising and
spin-exchange couplings and the effect of motion on spin dynamics. The model
parameters can be controlled independently, with dipolar couplings tuned by
electric fields and motion regulated by optical lattices. Using Ramsey
spectroscopy, we observed interaction-driven contrast decay that depends
strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange
couplings and on motion. These observations are supported by theory models
established in different motional regimes that provide intuitive pictures of
the underlying physics. This study paves the way for future exploration of
kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular
platforms in regimes challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods,
and it could shed light on the complex behaviors observed in real materials.

<h3>Fate of surface gaps in magnetic topological insulators</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Habib Rostami, Ali G. Moghaddam</i>
<p>In magnetic topological insulators, the surface states can exhibit a gap due
to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Various experiments, while
suggesting the existence of the surface gap, have raised questions about its
underlying mechanism in the presence of different magnetic orderings. Here, we
demonstrate that magnon-mediated electron-electron interactions, whose effects
are not limited to the surfaces perpendicular to the magnetic ordering, can
significantly influence surface states and their effective gaps. On the
surfaces perpendicular to the spin quantization axis, many-body interactions
can enhance the band gap to a degree that surpasses the non-interacting
scenario. Then, on surfaces parallel to the magnetic ordering, we find that
strong magnon-induced fermionic interactions can lead to features resembling a
massless-like gap. These remarkable results largely stem from the fact that
magnon-mediated interactions exhibit considerable long-range behavior compared
to direct Coulomb interactions among electrons, thereby dominating the
many-body properties at the surface of magnetic topological insulators.

<p>Spin and charge are the two most important degrees of freedom of electrons.
Their interplay lies at the heart of numerous strongly correlated phenomena
including Hubbard model physics and high temperature superconductivity. Such
interplay for bosons, on the other hand, is largely unexplored in condensed
matter systems. Here we demonstrate a unique realization of the spin-1/2
Bose-Hubbard model through excitons in a semiconducting moir\'e superlattice.
We find evidence of a transient in-plane ferromagnetic (FM-$xy$) order of
exciton spin - here valley pseudospin - around exciton filling $\nu_{ex}$ = 1,
which transitions into a FM-$z$ order both with increasing exciton filling and
a small magnetic field of 10 mT. The phase diagram is different from the
fermion case and is qualitatively captured by a simple phenomenological model,
highlighting the unique consequence of Bose-Einstein statistics. Our study
paves the way for engineering exotic phases of matter from spinor bosons, as
well as for unconventional devices in optics and quantum information science.
