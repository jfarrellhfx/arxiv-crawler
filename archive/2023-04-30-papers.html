<h3>Enhanced Critical Field of Superconductivity at an Oxide Interface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14426" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14426</a>

The nature of superconductivity and its interplay with strong spin-orbit
coupling at the KTaO3(111) interfaces remains a subject of debate. To address
this problem, we grew epitaxial LaMnO3/KTaO3(111) heterostructures. We show
that superconductivity is robust against the in-plane magnetic field, with the
critical field of superconductivity reaching 25 T in optimally doped
heterostructures. The superconducting order parameter is highly sensitive to
carrier density. We argue that spin-orbit coupling drives the formation of
anomalous quasiparticles with vanishing magnetic moment, providing the
condensate significant immunity against magnetic fields beyond the Pauli
paramagnetic limit. These results offer design opportunities for
superconductors with extreme resilience against magnetic field.

<h3>Higher-form Symmetries under Weak Measurement</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14433" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14433</a>
<br>
<i>Kaixiang Su, Nayan Myerson-Jain, Chong Wang, Chao-Ming Jian, Cenke Xu</i>
<br>
<br>
We aim to address the following question: if we start with a quantum state
with a spontaneously broken higher-form symmetry, what is the fate of the
system under weak local quantum measurements? We demonstrate that under certain
conditions, a phase transition can be driven by weak measurements, which
suppresses the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry and weakens the
1-form symmetry charge fluctuation. We analyze the nature of the transitions
employing the tool of duality, and we demonstrate that some of the transitions
driven by weak measurement enjoy a line of fixed points with self-duality.

<h3>Phase classification in the long-range Harper model using machine  learning</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14436" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14436</a>
<br>
<i>Abee Nelson, Aamna Ahmed, Ankur Raina, Auditya Sharma</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we map the phase diagrams of one-dimensional quasiperiodic
models using artificial neural networks. We observe that the multi-class
classifier precisely distinguishes the various phases, namely the delocalized,
multifractal, and localized phases when trained on the eigenstates of the
long-range Aubry-Andr\'e Harper (LRH) model. Additionally, when this trained
multi-layer perceptron is fed with the eigenstates of the Aubry-Andr\'e Harper
(AAH) model, it identifies various phases with reasonable accuracy. We examine
the resulting phase diagrams produced using a single disorder realization and
demonstrate that they are consistent with those obtained from the conventional
method of fractal dimension analysis which employs a large number of disorder
samples. Interestingly, when the neural network is trained using the
eigenstates of the AAH model, the resulting phase diagrams for the LRH model
are less exemplary than those previously obtained. Further, we study binary
classification by training the neural network on the probability density
corresponding to the delocalized and localized eigenstates of the AAH model. We
are able to pinpoint the critical transition point by examining the metric
``accuracy" for the central eigenstate. The effectiveness of the binary
classifier in identifying a previously unknown multifractal phase is then
evaluated by applying it to the LRH model.

<h3>Green's functions of multiband non-Hermitian systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14438" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14438</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Green's functions of non-Hermitian systems play a fundamental role in various
dynamical processes. Because non-Hermitian systems are sensitive to boundary
conditions due to the non-Hermitian skin effect, open-boundary Green's
functions are closely related to the non-Bloch band theory. While the exact
formula of open-boundary Green's functions in single-band non-Hermitian systems
proves to be an integral along the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ), the proper
generalization in generic multiband systems remains unclear. In this work, we
derive a formula of open-boundary Green's functions in multiband non-Hermitian
systems by viewing the multiband GBZ on the Riemann surface. This formula can
be applied to describe directional amplification in multiband systems, which
can be verified at various experimental platforms.

<h3>Ab initio investigation of the effects of B-doping on the adsorption of  H2O, H2 and O2 molecules at diamond surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14441" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14441</a>

<br>
<br>
Boron doped diamond is extensively studied for its use in tribological and
electrochemical applications due to its remarkable physical and chemical
properties. However, ambient conditions play a major role to its
macroscopically observed behavior. In this study, the fundamental interactions
between the low Miller index (001), (110) and (111) B-doped diamond surfaces
with H2O, H2 and O2 molecules, which are commonly present in ambient air and
commonly involved in electrochemical reactions, are investi-gated by means of
ab initio simulations. The results are presented in close comparison with
previous studies on undoped diamond surfaces to reveal the impact of B on the
adsorption properties. It is demonstrated that the B dopant is preferably
incorporated on the topmost carbon layer and enhances the physisorption of H2O
by forming a dative bond with O, while, in some cases, it can weaken the
ad-sorption of O2, compared to the undoped diamond. Moreover, a noticeable
displacement of the surface atoms attached to the fragment of the dissociated
H2O and O2 molecules was observed, which can be associated to the first stage
of wear at the atomistic level. These qualitative and quantitative results aim
to provide useful insight towards the development of improved protective
coatings and electrochemical devices.

<h3>Theory of a Single Magnetic Impurity on a Thin Metal Film in Proximity  to a Superconductor</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14448" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14448</a>
<br>
<i>Jon Ortuzar, Jose Ignacio Pascual, F. Sebastian Bergeret, Miguel A. Cazalilla</i>
<br>
<br>
We argue that the formation of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov excitations in proximitized
thin films is largely mediated by a type of Andreev-bound state named after de
Gennes and Saint James. This is shown by studying an experimentally motivated
model and computing the overlap of the wave functions of these two subgap
states. We find the overlap stays close to unity even as the system moves away
from weak coupling across the parity-changing quantum phase transition. Based
on this observation, we introduce a single-site model of the bound state
coupled to a quantum spin. The adequacy of this description is assessed by
reintroducing the coupling to the continuum as a weak perturbation and studying
its scaling flow using Anderson's poor man's scaling.

<h3>Probing localization properties of many-body Hamiltonians via an  imaginary vector potential</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14449" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14449</a>

<i>Liam O'Brien, Gil Refael</i>
<br>
<br>
Identifying and measuring the "localization length'' in many-body systems in
the vicinity of a many-body localization transition is difficult. Following
Hatano and Nelson, a recent work (Heuben, White, Refael, PRB 103, 064201
(2021)) introduced an "imaginary vector potential'' to a disordered ring of
interacting fermions, in order to define a many-body localization length
(corresponding, in the non-interacting case, to the end-to-end Green's function
of the hermitian system). We extend these results, by connecting this
localization length to the length scale appearing in the avalanche model of
delocalization. We use this connection to derive the distribution of the
localization length at the MBL transition, finding good agreement with our
numerical observations. Our results demonstrate how a localization length
defined as such probes the localization of the underlying ring, without the
need to explicitly construct the l-bits.

<h3>Evidence for Unconventional Superconductivity and Nontrivial Topology in  PdTe</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14453" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14453</a>
<br>
<i>Ramakanta Chapai, P. V. Sreenivasa Reddy, Lingyi Xing, David E. Graf, Amar B. Karki, Tay-Rong Chang, Rongying Jin</i>
<br>
<br>
PdTe is a superconductor with Tc ~4.25 K. Recently, evidence for bulk-nodal
and surface-nodeless gap features has been reported in PdTe [Yang et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. 130, 046402 (2023)]. Here, we investigate the physical properties of
PdTe in both the normal and superconducting states via specific heat and
magnetic torque measurements and first-principles calculations. Below Tc, the
electronic specific heat initially decreases in T3 behavior (1.5 K < T < Tc)
then exponentially decays. Using the two-band model, the superconducting
specific heat can be well described with two energy gaps: one is 0.372 meV and
another 1.93 meV. The calculated bulk band structure consists of two electron
bands ({\alpha} and \b{eta}) and two hole bands ({\gamma} and {\eta}) at the
Fermi level. Experimental detection of the de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA)
oscillations allows us to identify four frequencies (F{\alpha} = 65 T, F\b{eta}
= 658 T, F{\gamma} = 1154 T, and F{\eta} = 1867 T for H // a), consistent with
theoretical predictions. Nontrivial {\alpha} and \b{eta} bands are further
identified via both calculations and the angle dependence of the dHvA
oscillations. Our results suggest that PdTe is a candidate for unconventional
superconductivity.

<h3>Dynamics of polaron formation in 1D Bose gases in the strong-coupling  regime</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14490" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14490</a>
<br>
<i>Martin Will, Michael Fleischhauer</i>
<br>
<br>
We discuss the dynamics of the formation of a Bose polaron when an impurity
is injected into a weakly interacting one-dimensional Bose condensate. While
for small impurity-boson couplings this process can be described within the
Froehlich model as generation, emission and binding of Bogoliubov phonons, this
is no longer adequate if the coupling becomes strong. To treat this regime we
consider a mean-field approach beyond the Froehlich model which accounts for
the backaction to the condensate, complemented with Truncated Wigner
simulations to include quantum fluctuation. For the stationary polaron we find
an energy-momentum relation that displays a smooth crossover from a convex to a
concave dependence associated with a non-monotonous relation between impurity
velocity and polaron momentum. For larger momenta the energy is a periodic
function including regions of negative impurity velocity. Studying the polaron
formation after turning on the impurity-boson coupling quasi adiabatically and
in a sudden quench, we find a very rich scenario of dynamical regimes. Due to
the build-up of an effective mass, the impurity is slowed down even if its
initial velocity is below the Landau critical value. For larger initial
velocities we find deceleration and even backscattering caused by emission of
density waves or grey solitons and subsequent formation of stationary polaron
states in different momentum sectors. In order to analyze the effect of quantum
fluctuations we consider a trapped condensate to avoid 1D infrared
divergencies. Using Truncated Wigner simulations in this case we show under
what conditions the influence of quantum fluctuations is small.

<h3>Coherent control of the translational and point group symmetries of  crystals with light</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14506" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14506</a>
<br>
<i>Guru Khalsa, Jeffrey Z. Kaaret, Nicole A. Benedek</i>
<br>
<br>
We use theory and first-principles calculations to explore mechanisms for
control of the translational and point group symmetries of crystals in
ultrafast optical experiments. We focus in particular on mechanisms that
exploit anharmonic (biquadratic) lattice couplings between a driven
infrared-active phonon mode and other modes at arbitrary wave vector, which are
always allowed by symmetry in any space group. We use Floquet theory to develop
a general phase diagram depicting the various dynamical regimes accessible to
materials, with simulated dynamics to illustrate how the biquadratic coupling
changes materials structure depending on both extrinsic factors (light pulse
characteristics) and intrinsic materials parameters (phonon frequencies, phonon
coupling strengths). We use our phase diagram, in conjunction with density
functional theory calculations, both to suggest experiments to reveal hidden
structural order in perovskite KTaO$_3$, and to provide additional insights
into recently reported experiments on SrTiO$_3$ and LiNbO$_3$.

<h3>Wavelength Dependent Nonlinear Spectroscopic Study of Third Harmonic  Generation Probed by Rotational Maker Fringes Method</h3>

Efficient third-order nonlinearities of the Zinc Oxide and Al-doped Zinc
Oxide were studied by Third Harmonic Generation (Third Harmonic Generation)
Maker fringes to establish the effect Aluminum of Aluminum doping(Al-doping) on
the cubic nonlinearities. The addition of the Al-dopant to the Zinc Oxide
crystal structure results in changes that affected the optical and nonlinear
characteristics. Presented results indicate that magnitude of the third-order
nonlinear susceptibility tensor was enhanced at single experimental
wavelengths, however, across the broadband experimental spectrum the effect of
Al-doping remained relatively constant. The observed enhancement of third-order
nonlinearity was purely from the bound electronic response and the observation
is attributed to increased charge carriers and spontaneous polarization in the
Zinc Oxide and Al-doped Zinc Oxide crystal structure.

<h3>The Chlorine Vacancy in 4H-SiC: An NV-like Defect With Telecom Emission</h3>

The diamond nitrogen vacancy (NV) center remains an ever increasing topic of
interest. At present, it is considered an ideal example of a solid-state qubit
applicable in quantum communication, computing, and sensing alike. With its
success, the search for defects that share or improve upon its advantageous
features is an ongoing endeavor. By performing large-scale high-throughput
screening of 52600 defects in 4H silicon carbide (SiC), we identify a
collection of NV-like color-centers of particular interest. From this list, the
single most promising candidate consists of a silicon vacancy and chlorine
substituted on the carbon site, and is given the name of the chlorine vacancy
(ClV) center. Through high-accuracy first-principle calculations, we confirm
that the ClV center is similar to the NV center in diamond in its local
structure and shares many qualitative and quantitative features in the
electronic structure and spin properties. In contrast to the NV center,
however, the ClV center in SiC exhibits emission in the telecom range near the
C-band.

<h3>Large Enhancements in Optical and Piezoelectric Properties in  Ferroelectric Zn1-xMgxO Thin Films through Engineering Electronic and Ionic  Anharmonicities</h3>

<br>
<br>
Multifunctionality as a paradigm requires materials exhibiting multiple
superior properties. Integrating second-order optical nonlinearity and large
bandgap with piezoelectricity could, for example, enable broadband,
strain-tunable photonics. Though very different phenomena at distinct
frequencies, both second-order optical nonlinearity and piezoelectricity are
third-rank polar tensors present only in acentric crystal structures. However,
simultaneously enhancing both phenomena is highly challenging since it involves
competing effects with tradeoffs. Recently, a large switchable ferroelectric
polarization of ~ 80 uC cm-2 was reported in Zn1-xMgxO films. Here,
ferroelectric Zn1-xMgxO is demonstrated to be a platform that hosts
simultaneously a 30% increase in the electronic bandgap, a 50% enhancement in
the second harmonic generation coefficients, and a near 200% improvement in the
piezoelectric coefficients over pure ZnO. These enhancements are shown to be
due to a 400% increase in the electronic anharmonicity and a ~200% decrease in
the ionic anharmonicity with Mg substitution. Precisely controllable periodic
ferroelectric domain gratings are demonstrated down to 800 nm domain width,
enabling ultraviolet quasi-phase-matched optical harmonic generation as well as
domain-engineered piezoelectric devices.

<h3>Core-to-Core X-ray Emission Spectra from Wannier Based Multiplet Ligand  Field Theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14582" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14582</a>
<br>
<i>Charles Cardot, Joshua Kas, Jared Abramson, John Rehr, Gerald T. Seidler</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent advances using Density Functional Theory (DFT) to augment Multiplet
Ligand Field Theory (MLFT) have led to ab-initio calculations of many formerly
empirical parameters. This development makes MLFT more predictive instead of
interpretive, thus improving its value for understanding highly correlated 3d,
4d, and f-electron systems. Here, we explore a DFT + MLFT based approach for
core-to-core K{\alpha} x-ray emission spectra (XES) and evaluate its
performance for a range of transition metal systems. We find good agreement
between theory and experiment, as well as the ability to capture key spectral
trends related to spin and oxidation state. We also discuss limitations of the
model in the context of the remaining free parameters and suggest directions
forward.

<h3>Dissecting the experimental vibrational density of states of liquids  using instantaneous normal mode theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14609" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14609</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Liquid dynamics play crucial roles in chemical and physical processes,
ranging from biological systems to engineering applications. Yet, the
vibrational properties of liquids are poorly understood when compared to the
more familiar case of crystalline solids. Here, we report experimental
neutron-scattering measurements of the vibrational density of states (VDOS) of
water and liquid Fomblin in a wide range of temperatures. In the liquid phase,
we observe a universal low-energy linear scaling of the experimental VDOS as a
function of the frequency, which persists at all temperatures. Importantly, in
both systems, we observe that the slope of this linear behavior grows with
temperature. We confirm this experimental behavior using molecular dynamics
simulations, and we explain it using instantaneous normal mode (INM) theory,
whose predictions are in good agreement with the experimental and simulation
data. Finally, we experimentally observe a sharp crossover at the melting point
of water, below which the standard Debye's law is recovered. On the contrary,
in Fomblin, we observe a gradual and continuous crossover indicating its glassy
dynamics and proving that the low-frequency power-law scaling of the VDOS is a
good probe for the nature of the solid-to-liquid transition. Our results
experimentally confirm the validity of INM theory and the success of a normal
mode approach to liquid dynamics, which could pave the way towards a deeper
understanding of liquids and their properties in general.

<h3>A gauge constrained algorithm of VDAT at $\mathcal{N}=3$ for the  multi-orbital Hubbard model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14616" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14616</a>

<br>
<br>
The recently developed variational discrete action theory (VDAT) provides a
systematic variational approach to the ground state of the quantum many-body
problem, where the quality of the solution is controlled by an integer
$\mathcal{N}$, and increasing $\mathcal{N}$ monotonically approaches the exact
solution. VDAT can be exactly evaluated in the $d=\infty$ multi-orbital Hubbard
model using the self-consistent canonical discrete action theory (SCDA), which
requires a self-consistency condition for the integer time Green's functions.
Previous work demonstrates that $\mathcal{N}=3$ accurately captures
multi-orbital Mott/Hund physics at a cost similar to the Gutzwiller
approximation. Here we employ a gauge constraint to automatically satisfy the
self-consistency condition of the SCDA at $\mathcal{N}=3$, yielding an even
more efficient algorithm with enhanced numerical stability. We derive closed
form expressions of the gauge constrained algorithm for the multi-orbital
Hubbard model with general density-density interactions, allowing VDAT at
$\mathcal{N}=3$ to be straightforwardly applied to the seven orbital Hubbard
model. We present results and a performance analysis using $\mathcal{N}=2$ and
$\mathcal{N}=3$ for the $\textrm{SU}(2\textrm{N}_{\textrm{orb}})$ Hubbard model
in $d=\infty$ with $\textrm{N}_{\textrm{orb}}=2-8$, and compare to numerically
exact dynamical mean-field theory solutions where available. The developments
in this work will greatly facilitate the application of VDAT at $\mathcal{N}=3$
to strongly correlated electron materials.

<h3>Partial molecular orbitals in face-sharing 3$d$ manganese trimer:  Comparative studies on Ba$_{4}$TaMn$_{3}$O$_{12}$ and  Ba$_{4}$NbMn$_{3}$O$_{12}$</h3>

<i>Anzar Ali, Heung-Sik Kim, Suheon Lee, Duhee Yoon, Sungkyun Choi</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a new molecular orbital candidate Ba$_{4}$TaMn$_{3}$O$_{12}$ with
a face-sharing octahedra trimer, by comparing it with a related compound
Ba$_{4}$NbMn$_{3}$O$_{12}$. The synthesis of the polycrystalline powder is
optimized by suppressing the secondary impurity phase via X-ray diffraction.
Magnetic susceptibility measurements on the best samples reveal the intrinsic
magnetic hysteresis with magnetic transitions consistent with heat capacity
results. The effective magnetic moments from susceptibility indicate a strongly
coupled $S=2$ antiferromagnetic trimer at around room temperature, whereas the
estimated magnetic entropy from heat capacity suggests the localized $S=3/2$
timer. These results can be explainable by a partial molecular orbital state,
in which three t$_{2g}$ electrons are localized in each Mn ion and one e$_{g}$
electron is delocalized over two-end Mn ions of the trimer based on density
functional theory calculations. This new 3$d$ orbital state is comprehended as
a consequence of competition between the hybrid interatomic orbitals within the
Mn trimer and the local moment formation by on-site Coulomb correlations. We
further find the potential manipulation of the band gap in the 3$d$ trimer
material platform in searching for the unconventional insulator-metal
transition.

<h3>Noncollinear magnetic order, in-plane anisotropy, and magnetoelectric  coupling in a pyroelectric honeycomb antiferromagnet Ni$_{2}$Mo$_{3}$O$_{8}$</h3>

<br>
Ni$_{2}$Mo$_{3}$O$_{8}$ is a pyroelectric honeycomb antiferromagnet
exhibiting peculiar changes of its electric polarization at magnetic
transitions. Ni$_{2}$Mo$_{3}$O$_{8}$ stands out from the isostructural magnetic
compounds, showing an anomalously low magnetic transition temperature and
unique magnetic anisotropy. We determine the magnetic structure of
Ni$_{2}$Mo$_{3}$O$_{8}$ utilizing high-resolution powder and single-crystal
neutron diffraction. A noncollinear stripy antiferromagnetic order is found in
the honeycomb planes. The magnetic space group is \textit{P$_C$na}2$_1$. The
in-plane magnetic connection is of the stripy type both for the $ab$-plane and
the $c$-axis spin components. This is a simpler connection than the one
proposed previously. The ferromagnetic interlayer order of the $c$-axis spin
components in our model is also distinct. The magnetic anisotropy of
Ni$_{2}$Mo$_{3}$O$_{8}$ is characterized by orientation-dependent magnetic
susceptibility measurements on a single crystal, consistent with neutron
diffraction analysis. The local magnetoelectric tensor analysis using our
magnetic models provides new insights into its magnetoelectric coupling and
polarization. Thus, our results deliver essential information for understanding
both the unusual magnetoelectric properties of Ni$_{2}$Mo$_{3}$O$_{8}$ and the
prospects for observation of exotic nonreciprocal, Hall, and magnonic effects
characteristic to this compound family.

<br>
<br>
Disordered rocksalt Li-excess (DRX) compounds are attractive new cathode
materials for Li-ion batteries as they contain resource-abundant metals and do
not require the use of cobalt or nickel. Understanding the delithiation process
and cation short-range ordering (SRO) in DRX compounds is essential to
improving these promising cathode materials. Herein, we use first-principles
calculations along with the cluster-expansion approach to model the disorder in
DRX Li2-xVO3, 0 < x < 1. We discuss the SRO of Li in tetrahedral and octahedral
sites, and the order in which Li delithiates and V oxidizes with respect to
local environments. We reveal that the number of nearest-neighbor V dictates
the order of delithiation from octahedral sites and that V are oxidized in a
manner that minimizes the electrostatic interactions among V. Our results
provide valuable insight for tailoring the performance of V-based DRX cathode
materials in general by controlling the SRO features that reduce energy
density.

Tuning the interaction between the bulk and edge states of topological
materials is a powerful tool for manipulating edge transport behavior, opening
up exciting opportunities for novel electronic and spintronic applications.
This approach is particularly suited to topological crystalline insulators
(TCI), a class of topologically nontrivial compounds that are endowed with
multiple degrees of topological protection. In this study, we investigate how
bulk-edge interactions can influence the edge transport in planar bismuthene, a
TCI with metallic edge states protected by in-plane mirror symmetry, using
first principles calculations and symmetrized Wannier tight-binding models. By
exploring the impact of various perturbation effects, such as device size,
substrate potentials, and applied transverse electric field, we examine the
evolution of the electronic structure and edge transport in planar bismuthene.
Our findings demonstrate that the TCI states of planar bismuthene can be
engineered to exhibit either a gapped or conducting unconventional helical spin
texture via a combination of substrate and electric field effects. Furthermore,
under strong electric fields, the edge states can be stabilized through a
delicate control of the bulk-edge interactions. These results open up new
directions for discovering novel spin transport patterns in topological
materials and provide critical insights for the fabrication of topological
spintronic devices.

We consider a system of clusters of various sizes or masses, subject to
aggregation and fragmentation by collision with monomers or by
self-disintegration. The aggregation rate for the cluster of size (or mass) $k$
is given by a kernel proportional to $k^{a}$ with $a\ge 0$. The collision rate
and the disintegration rate are given by $\lambda k^{b}$ and $\mu k^{b}$,
respectively, with $0\le a,b\le 1$ and positive factors $\lambda$ and $\mu$. We
study the emergence of oscillations in the phase diagram $(\lambda,\mu)$ for
two models: $(a,b)=(1,0)$ and $(1,1)$. It is shown that the monomer population
satisfies a class of integral equations possessing oscillatory solutions in a
finite domain in the plane $(\lambda,\mu)$. We evaluate analytically this
domain in a precise way and give an estimate of the oscillation frequency. In
particular, these oscillations are found to occur generally for small but
nonzero values of the parameter $\mu$, far smaller than $\lambda$.

Landau quantization associated with the quantized cyclotron motion of
electrons under magnetic field provides the effective way to investigate
topologically protected quantum states with entangled degrees of freedom and
multiple quantum numbers. Here we report the cascade of Landau quantization in
a strained type-II Dirac semimetal NiTe2 with spectroscopic-imaging scanning
tunneling microscopy. The uniform-height surfaces exhibit single-sequence
Landau levels (LLs) at a magnetic field originating from the quantization of
topological surface state (TSS) across the Fermi level. Strikingly, we reveal
the multiple sequence of LLs in the strained surface regions where the rotation
symmetry is broken. Firstprinciples calculations demonstrate that the multiple
LLs attest to the remarkable lifting of the valley degeneracy of TSS by the
in-plane uniaxial or shear strains. Our findings pave a pathway to tune
multiple degrees of freedom and quantum numbers of TMDs via strain engineering
for practical applications such as high-frequency rectifiers, Josephson diode
and valleytronics.

<h3>Coulomb interactions and conventional superconductivity: when going  beyond the random phase approximation is essential</h3>

<br>
<i>Camilla Pellegrini, Carl Kukkonen, Antonio Sanna</i>
<br>
<br>
In ab initio calculations of superconducting properties, the Coulomb
repulsion is accounted for at the GW level and is usually computed in RPA,
which amounts to neglecting vertex corrections both at the polarizability level
and in the self-energy. Although this approach is unjustified, the brute force
inclusion of higher order corrections to the self-energy is computationally
prohibitive. We propose to use a generalized GW self-energy, where vertex
corrections are incorporated into W by employing the Kukkonen and Overhauser
(KO) ansatz for the effective interaction between two electrons in the electron
gas. By computing the KO interaction in the adiabatic local density
approximation for a diverse set of conventional superconductors, and using it
in the Eliashberg equations, we find that vertex corrections lead to a
systematic decrease of the critical temperature (Tc), ranging from a few
percent in bulk lead to more than 40% in compressed lithium. We propose a set
of simple rules to identify those systems where large Tc corrections are to be
expected and hence the use of the KO interaction is recommended. Our approach
offers a rigorous extension of the RPA and GW methods for the prediction of
superconducting properties at a negligible extra computational cost.

Using the strong coupling diagram technique, we investigate the extended
Hubbard model on a two-dimensional square lattice. This approach allows for
charge and spin fluctuations and a short-range antiferromagnetic order at
nonzero temperatures. The model features the first-order phase transition to
states with alternating site occupations (SAO) at the intersite repulsion
$v=v_c$. In this work, we show that doping decreases $v_c$. For a nonzero
next-nearest neighbor hopping $t'$, less mobile carriers produce a stronger
fall in $v_c$. For half-filling and $t'=0$, we consider phase diagrams for a
fixed temperature $T$, on-site $U$, and intersite repulsions. The diagrams
contain regions of SAO, Mott insulator, and several metallic states
distinguished by their densities of states. Two of them are characterized by a
dip and a peak at the Fermi level. The dip originates from the Slater mechanism
for itinerant electrons, while the peak to bound states of electrons with
localized magnetic moments. The existence of these two metallic regions in the
phase diagram is a manifestation of the Pomeranchuk effect. The boundary
between these regions reveals itself as a kink in the curve $v_c(T)$ and as a
maximum in the $T$ dependence of the double occupancy $D$. Our calculated $D$
for different values of $v$, $U$, and $T$ are in semiquantitative agreement
with Monte Carlo results.

We report the results of low-temperature magnetization and specific heat
measurements of Sr$_3$CoTa$_2$O$_9$ powder, in which Co$^{2+}$ ions with
effective spin-1/2 form a uniform triangular lattice in the $ab$ plane. It was
found that Sr$_3$CoTa$_2$O$_9$ undergoes successive antiferromagnetic
transitions at $T_{\rm N1}\,{=}\,0.97~{\rm K}$ and $T_{\rm N2}\,{=}\,0.79~{\rm
K}$ at zero magnetic field. As the magnetic field increases, both $T_{\rm N1}$
and $T_{\rm N2}$ decrease monotonically. The obtained magnetic field vs
temperature phase diagram together with a sharp magnetization anomaly at a
saturation field of ${\mu_0}H_{\rm s}\,{=}\,2.3~{\rm T}$ indicates that
Sr$_3$CoTa$_2$O$_9$ is described as a spin-1/2 three-dimensional
triangular-lattice antiferromagnet with a weak easy-axis anisotropy. We discuss
the characteristics of the magnetic phase diagram, which approximates the phase
diagram for the magnetic field perpendicular to the $c$ axis.

High harmonic emissions from crystalline solids contain rich information on
the dynamics of electrons driven by intense infrared laser fields and have been
intensively studied owing to their potential use as a probe of microscopic
electronic structures. Especially, the ability to measure the temporal response
of high harmonics may allow us to investigate electron dynamics directly in
quantum materials. However, this most essential aspect of high harmonic
emissions has been challenging to measure. Here, we propose a simple solution
for this problem: a high harmonic interferometer, where high harmonics are
generated in each of the path of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer and an
interferogram of them is captured. The high harmonic interferometer allows us
to achieve a relative time resolution between the target and reference high
harmonics of less than 150 attoseconds, which is fine enough to track sub-cycle
dynamics of electrons in solids. By using high harmonic interferometrer, we
succeeded in capturing the real time dynamics of Floquet states in WSe2, whose
indirect signature had so far been caught only by time-averaged measurement.
Our simple technique will open a door to attosecond electron dynamics in
solids.

The family of Van der Waals dichalcogenides (VdWDs) includes a large number
of compositions and phases, exhibiting varied properties and functionalities.
They have opened up a novel electronics of two-dimensional materials,
characterized by higher integration and interfaces which are atomically sharper
and cleaner than conventional electronics. Among these functionalities, some
VdWDs possess remarkable thermoelectric properties. SnSe2 has been identified
as a promising thermoelectric material on the basis of its estimated electronic
and transport properties. In this work we carry out experimental meas-urements
of the electric and thermoelectric properties of SnSe2 flakes. For a 30 micron
thick SnSe2 flake at room temperature, we measure electron mobility of 40 cm^2
V^-1 s^-1, a carrier density of 4 x 10^18 cm^-3, a Seebeck coefficient S around
-400 microV/K and thermoelectric power factor around 0.35 mW m^-1 K^-2. The
comparison of experimental results with theoretical calculations shows fair
agreement and indicates that the dominant carrier scattering mechanisms are
polar optical phonons at room temperature and ionized im-purities below 50 K.
In order to explore possible improvement of the thermoelectric properties, we
carry out reversible electrostatic doping on a thinner flake, in a field effect
setup. On this 75 nm thick SnSe2 flake, we measure a field effect variation of
the Seebeck coefficient of up to 290 % at low temperature, and a corresponding
variation of the thermoelectric power factor of up to 1050 %. We find that the
power factor increases with the depletion of n-type charge carriers. Field
effect control of thermoelectric transport opens perspectives for boosting
energy harvesting and novel switching technologies based on two-dimensional
materials.

This work reports the thermal conductivity of RbV3Sb5 and CsV3Sb5 with
three-dimensional charge density wave phase transitions from 80 K to 400 K
measured by pump-probe thermoreflectance techniques. The in-plane (basal plane)
thermal conductivities are found moderate, i.e., 12 W/mK of RbV3Sb5 and 8.8
W/mK of CsV3Sb5 at 300 K. Low cross-plane (stacking direction) thermal
conductivities are observed, with 0.72 W/mK of RbV3Sb5 and 0.49 W/mK of CsV3Sb5
at 300 K. A unique glass-like temperature dependence in the cross-plane thermal
conductivity is observed, which decreases monotonically even lower than the
Cahill-Pohl limit as the temperature decreases below the phase transition point
TCDW. This temperature dependence is found to obey the hopping transport
picture. In addition, a peak in cross-plane thermal conductivity is observed at
TCDW as a fingerprint of the modulated structural distortion along the stacking
direction.

<h3>Subdiffusion in the Presence of Reactive Boundaries: A Generalized  Feynman-Kac Approach</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We derive, through subordination techniques, a generalized Feynman-Kac
equation in the form of a time fractional Schrodinger equation. We relate such
equation to a functional which we name the subordinated local time. We
demonstrate through a stochastic treatment how this generalized Feynman-Kac
equation describes subdiffusive processes with reactions. In this
interpretation, the subordinated local time represents the number of times a
specific spatial point is reached, with the amount of time spent there being
immaterial. This distinction provides a practical advance due to the potential
long waiting time nature of subdiffusive processes. The subordinated local time
is used to formulate a probabilistic understanding of subdiffusion with
reactions, leading to the well known radiation boundary condition. We
demonstrate the equivalence between the generalized Feynman-Kac equation with a
reflecting boundary and the fractional diffusion equation with a radiation
boundary. We solve the former and find the first-reaction probability density
in analytic form in the time domain, in terms of the Wright function. We are
also able to find the survival probability and subordinated local time density
analytically. These results are validated by stochastic simulations that use
the subordinated local time description of subdiffusion in the presence of
reactions.

The impact of van der Waals interaction on the electronic structure between a
pentacene monolayer and a graphite surface was investigated. Upon cooling the
monolayer, newly formed dispersive bands, showing the constant final state
nature overlapping with the non-dispersive, discrete molecular orbital state,
is observed by low-energy angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. The
dispersive band consists of positive and negative intensities depending on the
final state energy, indicating Fano resonance involving a discrete molecular
state that couples a continuum state upon photoionization. A wave-function
overlap is demonstrated according to their larger spread in unoccupied states
even at the weakly bounded interface by Fano spectral analysis.

<br>
<i>Arindam Mallick, Alexei Andreanov, Sergej Flach</i>
<br>
<br>
We demonstrate the existence of an intermediate super-exponential
localization regime for eigenstates of the Aubry-Andr\'e chain. In this regime,
the eigenstates localize factorially similarly to the eigenstates of the
Wannier-Stark ladder. The super-exponential decay emerges on intermediate
length scales for large values of the $\textit{winding length}$ -- the
quasi-period of the Aubry-Andr\'e potential. This intermediate localization is
present both in the metallic and insulating phases of the system. In the
insulating phase, the super-exponential localization is periodically
interrupted by weaker decaying tails to form the conventional asymptotic
exponential decay predicted for the Aubry-Andr\'e model. In the metallic phase,
the super-exponential localization happens for states with energies away from
the center of the spectrum and is followed by a super-exponential growth into
the next peak of the extended eigenstate. By adjusting the parameters it is
possible to arbitrarily extend the validity of the super-exponential
localization. A similar intermediate super-exponential localization regime is
demonstrated in quasiperiodic discrete-time unitary maps.

We discuss how the wettability of solid walls impacts electrokinetic
properties, from large systems to a nanoscale. We show in particular how could
the hydrophobic slippage, coupled to confinement effects, be exploited to
induce novel electrokinetic properties, such as a salt-dependent giant
amplification of zeta potential and conductivity, and a much more efficient
energy conversion. However, the impact of slippage is dramatically reduced if
some surface charges migrate along the hydrophobic wall under an applied field.

Magnetic nano-objects possess great potential for more efficient data
processing, storage and neuromorphic type of applications. Using high
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy synthetic antiferromagnets in the form of
multilayer-based metamaterials we purposely reduce the antiferromagnetic (AF)
interlayer exchange energy below the out-of-plane demagnetization energy, which
controls the magnetic domain formation. As we show via macroscopic magnetometry
as well as microscopic Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, in this
unusual magnetic energy regime, it becomes possible to stabilize nanometer
scale stripe and bubble textures consisting of ferromagnetic (FM) out-of-plane
domain cores separated by AF in-plane Bloch-type domain walls. This unique
coexistence of mixed FM/AF order on the nanometer scale opens so far unexplored
perspectives in the architecture of magnetic domain landscapes as well as the
design and functionality of individual magnetic textures, such as bubble
domains with alternating chirality.

We employ a novel discrete element method (DEM) force formulation to simulate
adhesive wear and assess the effects of material and loading parameters on the
properties of the third-body layer (TBL) formed during sliding motion. The
study emphasizes the role of a material's critical length scale d* in the
rheology of the TBL. This critical length scale is already known for
controlling the size of smallest wear particles. We observe the emergence of a
several wear regimes involving wear particle creation and aggregation, with
limited effect from d* on TBL properties. Instead, material strength and
surface energy have a profound influence. This study opens up new avenues for
exploration of larger systems, three-dimensional setups, and other loading
conditions.

<br>
Oxide-based two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) have generated significant
interest due to their potential for discovering novel physical properties.
Among these, 2DEGs formed in KTaO3 stand out due to the recently discovered
crystal face-dependent superconductivity and large Rashba splitting, both of
which hold potential for future oxide electronics devices. In this work,
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is used to study the electronic
structure of the 2DEG formed at the (110) surface of KTaO3 after deposition of
a thin Al layer. Our experiments revealed a remarkable anisotropy in the
orbital character of the electron-like dispersive bands, which form a Fermi
surface consisting of two elliptical contours with their major axes
perpendicular to each other. The measured electronic structure is used to
constrain the modeling parameters of self-consistent tight-binding slab
calculations of the band structure. In these calculations, an anisotropic
Rashba splitting is found with a value as large as 4 meV at the Fermi level
along the [-110] crystallographic direction. This large unconventional and
anisotropic Rashba splitting is rationalized based on the orbital angular
momentum formulation. These findings provide insights into the interpretation
of spin-orbitronics experiments and help to constrain models for
superconductivity in the KTO(110)-2DEG system.

Layered superconductors like High-Tc cuprates display out-of-plane plasma
oscillations between layers sustained by the weak Josephson coupling among the
superconducting sheets, the so-called Josephson plasmons. Bilayer cuprates
hosts two of such modes, but due to the anisotropy of the electronic response
their description at generic wavevector cannot be separated from that of the
in-plane oscillations. In this paper we provide an analytical theoretical
framework able to describe the dispersions and the polarizations of the
generalized plasma modes of such systems, that has been only partly addressed
by previous work in the literature. We then employ it to explain the peculiar
characteristics of their linear optical response, by providing a fully
microscopic explanation for the appearance of a finite-frequency peak in the
real part of the optical conductivity. On a wider perspective, the complete
characterization of the Josephson plasma modes provided by our approach
represents a groundwork to address open issues raised by recent experiments
with strong THz pulses, able to drive them beyond the linear-response regime.

Highly periodic structures are often said to convey the beauty of nature.
However, most material properties are strongly influenced by the defects they
contain. On the mesoscopic scale, molecular self-assembly exemplifies this
interplay; thermodynamic principles determine short-range order, but long-range
order is mainly impeded by the kinetic history of the material and by thermal
fluctuations. For the development of self-assembly technologies, it is
imperative to characterise and understand the interplay between self-assembled
order and defect-induced disorder. Here we used synchrotron-based hard X-ray
nanotomography to reveal a pair of extended topological defects within a
self-assembled single-diamond network morphology. These defects are
morphologically similar to the comet and trefoil patterns of equal and opposite
half-integer topological charges observed in liquid crystals and appear to
maintain a constant separation across the thickness of the sample, resembling
pairs of full vortices in superconductors and other hard condensed matter
systems. These results are expected to open new windows to study defect
formation in soft condensed matter, particularly in biological systems where
most structures are formed by self-assembly.

<br>
<br>
Recent experiments have shown that the phase diagrams of the kagome
superconductors $A\mathrm{V}_3\mathrm{Sb}_5$ are strongly impacted by changes
in the $c$-axis lattice parameter. Here, we show that $c$-axis deformations
impact primarily the Sb apical bonds and thus the overlap between their $p_z$
orbitals. Changes in the latter, in turn, substantially affect low-energy
electronic states with significant Sb character, most notably the central
electron pocket and the van Hove singularities located above the Fermi level.
Based on the orbital-selective character of $c$-axis strain, we argue that
these electronic states experience a non-negligible attractive electron-phonon
pairing interaction mediated by fluctuations in the apical Sb bonds. We thus
propose a multi-band model for superconductivity in
$A\mathrm{V}_3\mathrm{Sb}_5$ that includes both the Sb pocket and the V-derived
van Hove singularities. Upon comparing the theoretical phase diagram with the
experimentally observed vanishing of the $T_c$ dome across a Lifshitz
transition of the Sb pocket, we propose that either an $s^{+-}$ or an $s^{++}$
state is realized in $A\mathrm{V}_3\mathrm{Sb}_5$.

Hole spin qubits based on germanium (Ge) have strong tunable spin orbit
interaction (SOI) and ultrafast qubit operation speed. Here we report that the
Rabi frequency (f_Rabi) of a hole spin qubit in a Ge hut wire (HW) double
quantum dot (DQD) is electrically tuned through the detuning energy and middle
gate voltage (V_M). f_Rabi gradually decreases with increasing detuning energy;
on the contrary, f_Rabi is positively correlated with V_M. We attribute our
results to the change of electric field on SOI and the contribution of the
excited state in quantum dots to f_Rabi. We further demonstrate an ultrafast
f_Rabi exceeding 1.2 GHz, which evidences the strong SOI in our device. The
discovery of an ultrafast and electrically tunable f_Rabi in a hole spin qubit
has potential applications in semiconductor quantum computing.

Motivated by recent discoveries of superconductivity in lightly-doped
multilayer graphene systems, we consider a generic Hamiltonian to describe a
metal whose Fermi surface is centered at the two inequivalent valleys of the
hexagonal Brillouin zone and compute its Bologliubov quasiparticle spectrum
when translation symmetry is broken by short-range disorder. We found that the
spectrum depends sensitively on the relative sign of the superconducting order
parameter in the two valleys. When they have opposite signs (odd-valley
superconductivity), the superconducting gap closes and leads to a strongly
enhanced local density of states. When they have the same sign (even-valley
superconductivity), the quasiparticle spectrum remains gapped. Our analytical
results are confirmed by numerical diagonalization of a tight-binding
Hamiltonian on a ribbon geometry.

Self-organization is the autonomous assembly of a network of interacting
components into a stable, organized pattern. This article shows that the
process of self-assembly can be encoded in terms of evolutionary entropy, a
statistical measure of the cooperativity of the interacting components.
Evolutionary entropy describes the rate at which a network of interacting
metabolic units convert an external energy source into mechanical energy and
work. We invoke Directionality Theory, an analytic model of Darwinian evolution
to analyze self-assembly as a variation-selection process, and to derive a
general tenet, namely, the Entropic Principle of Self-Organization: The
equilibrium states of a self-organizing process are states which maximize
evolutionary entropy, contingent on the production rate of the external energy
source. This principle is a universal rule, applicable to the self-assembly of
structures ranging from the folding of proteins, to branching morphogenesis,
and the emergence of social organization. The principle also elucidates the
origin of cellular life: the transition from inorganic matter to the emergence
of cells, capable of replication and metabolism.

It has been recently noted that for a class of dynamical systems with
explicit conservation laws represented via projector operators the dynamics can
be understood in terms of lower dimensional equations This is the case for
instance of memristive circuits Memristive systems are important classes of
devices with wide ranging applications in electronic circuits artificial neural
networks and memory storage We show that such mean field theories can emerge
from averages over the group of orthogonal matrices interpreted as cycle
preserving transformations applied to the projector operator describing
Kirchhoffs laws Our results provide insights into the fundamental principles
underlying the behavior of resistive and memristive circuits and highlight the
importance of conservation laws for their meanf ield theories In addition we
argue that our results shed light on the nature of the critical avalanches
observed in quasi-two dimensional nanowires as boundary phenomena

We analyze the time-evolution of a quantum dot which is proximized by a
large-gap superconductor and weakly probed using the charge and heat currents
into a wide-band metal electrode. We map out the full time dependence of these
currents after initializing the system by a switch. We find that due to the
proximity effect there are two simple yet distinct switching procedures which
initialize a non-stationary mixture of the gate-voltage dependent eigenstates
of the proximized quantum dot. We find in particular that the ensuing
time-dependent heat current is a sensitive two-particle probe of the interplay
of strong Coulomb interaction and induced superconducting pairing. The pairing
can lead to a suppression of charge and heat current decay which we analyze in
detail. The analysis of the results makes crucial use of analytic formulas
obtained using fermionic duality, a ``dissipative symmetry'' of the master
equation describing this class of open systems.

$\text{GdRu}_{\text{2}}\text{Si}_{\text{2}}$ is a centrosymmetric magnet in
which a skyrmion lattice has recently been discovered. Here, we investigate the
magnetic structure of the zero field ground state using neutron diffraction on
single crystal and polycrystalline
$^{\text{160}}\text{GdRu}_{\text{2}}\text{Si}_{\text{2}}$. In addition to
observing the principal propagation vectors $\mathbf{q}_{1}$ and
$\mathbf{q}_{2}$, we discover higher order magnetic satellites, notably
$\mathbf{q}_{1} + 2\mathbf{q}_{2}$. The appearance of these satellites are
explained within the framework of a new double-$Q$ constant-moment solution.
Using powder diffraction we implement a quantitative refinement of this model.
This structure, which contains vortexlike motifs, is shown to have a
one-dimensional topological charge density.

<br>
<br>
Inspired by the neuro-synaptic frameworks in the human brain, neuromorphic
computing is expected to overcome the bottleneck of traditional von-Neumann
architecture and be used in artificial intelligence. Here, we predict a class
of potential candidate materials, MCu$_3$X$_4$ (M = V, Nb, Ta; X = S, Se, Te),
for neuromorphic computing applications through first-principles calculations
based on density functional theory. We find that when MCu$_3$X$_4$ are inserted
with Li atom, the systems would transform from semiconductors to metals due to
the considerable electron filling [~0.8 electrons per formula unit (f.u.)] and
still maintain well structural stability. Meanwhile, the inserted Li atom also
has a low diffusion barrier (~0.6 eV/f.u.), which ensures the feasibility to
control the insertion/extraction of Li by gate voltage. These results establish
that the system can achieve the reversible switching between two stable memory
states, i.e., high/low resistance state, indicating that it could potentially
be used to design synaptic transistor to enable neuromorphic computing. Our
work provides inspiration for advancing the search of candidate materials
related to neuromorphic computing from the perspective of theoretical
calculations.

Physical systems can be used as an information processing substrate and with
that extend traditional computing architectures. For such an application the
experimental platform must guarantee pristine control of the initial state, the
temporal evolution and readout. All these ingredients are provided by modern
experimental realizations of atomic Bose Einstein condensates. By embedding the
nonlinear evolution of a quantum gas in a Machine Learning pipeline, one can
represent nonlinear functions while only linear operations on classical
computing of the pipeline are necessary. We demonstrate successful regression
and interpolation of a nonlinear function using a quasi one-dimensional cloud
of potassium atoms and characterize the performance of our system.

<h3>Computational study of III-V direct-gap semiconductors for  thermoradiative cell applications</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the performance of thermoradiative (TR) cells using the III-V
group of semiconductors, which include GaAs, GaSb, InAs, and InP, with the aim
of determining their efficiency and finding the best TR cell materials among
the III-V group. The TR cells generate electricity from thermal radiation, and
their efficiency is influenced by several factors such as the bandgap,
temperature difference, and absorption spectrum. To create a realistic model,
we incorporate sub-bandgap and heat losses in our calculations and utilize
density-functional theory to determine the energy gap and optical properties of
each material. Our findings suggest that the effect of absorptivity on the
material, especially when the sub-bandgap and heat losses are considered, can
decrease the efficiency of TR cells. However, careful treatment of the
absorptivity indicates that not all materials have the same trend of decrease
in the TR cell efficiency when taking the loss mechanisms into account. We
observe that GaSb exhibits the highest power density, while InP demonstrates
the lowest one. Moreover, GaAs and InP exhibit relatively high efficiency
without the sub-bandgap and heat losses, whereas InAs display lower efficiency
without considering the losses, yet exhibit higher resistance to sub-bandgap
and heat losses compared to the other materials, thus effectively becoming the
best TR cell material in the III-V group of semiconductors.

<h3>Heterogeneous Mean First Passage Time Scaling in Fractal Media</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The mean first passage time~(MFPT) of random walks is a key quantity
characterizing dynamic processes on disordered media. In a random fractal
embedded in the Euclidean space, the MFPT is known to obey the power law
scaling with the distance between a source and a target site with a universal
exponent. We find that the scaling law for the MFPT is not determined solely by
the distance between a source and a target but also by their locations. The
role of a site in the first passage processes is quantified by the random walk
centrality. It turns out that the site of highest random walk centrality,
dubbed as a hub, intervenes in first passage processes. We show that the MFPT
from a departure site to a target site is determined by a competition between
direct paths and indirect paths detouring via the hub. Consequently, the MFPT
displays a crossover scaling between a short distance regime, where direct
paths are dominant, and a long distance regime, where indirect paths are
dominant. The two regimes are characterized by power laws with different
scaling exponents. The crossover scaling behavior is confirmed by extensive
numerical calculations of the MFPTs on the critical percolation cluster in two
dimensional square lattices.

<br>
<br>
Optically driven intersite and interlayer spin transfer are individually
known as the fastest processes for manipulating the spin order of magnetic
materials on the sub 100 fs time scale. However, their competing influence on
the ultrafast magnetization dynamics remains unexplored. In our work, we show
that optically induced intersite spin transfer (also known as OISTR) dominates
the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of ferromagnetic alloys such as Permalloy
(Ni80Fe20) only in the absence of interlayer spin transfer into a substrate.
Once interlayer spin transfer is possible, the influence of OISTR is
significantly reduced and interlayer spin transfer dominates the ultrafast
magnetization dynamics. This provides a new approach to control the
magnetization dynamics of alloys on extremely short time scales by fine-tuning
the interlayer spin transfer.

Permanent magnets draw their properties from a complex interplay, across
multiple length scales, of the composition and distribution of their
constituting phases, that act as building blocks, each with their associated
intrinsic properties. Gaining a fundamental understanding of these interactions
is hence key to decipher the origins of their magnetic performance and
facilitate the engineering of better-performing magnets, through unlocking the
design of the "perfect defects" for ultimate pinning of magnetic domains. Here,
we deployed advanced multiscale microscopy and microanalysis on a bulk
Sm2(CoFeCuZr)17 pinning-type high-performance magnet with outstanding thermal
and chemical stability. Making use of regions with different chemical
compositions, we showcase how both a change in the composition and distribution
of copper, along with the atomic arrangements enforce the pinning of magnetic
domains, as imaged by nanoscale magnetic induction mapping. Micromagnetic
simulations bridge the scales to provide an understanding of how these
peculiarities of micro- and nanostructure change the hard magnetic behaviour of
Sm2(CoFeCuZr)17 magnets. Unveiling the origins of the reduced coercivity allows
us to propose an atomic-scale defect and chemistry manipulation strategy to
define ways toward future hard magnets.

<h3>The Exponential Capacity of Dense Associative Memories</h3>

Recent generalizations of the Hopfield model of associative memories are able
to store a number $P$ of random patterns that grows exponentially with the
number $N$ of neurons, $P=\exp(\alpha N)$. Besides the huge storage capacity,
another interesting feature of these networks is their connection to the
attention mechanism which is part of the Transformer architectures widely
applied in deep learning. In this work, we consider a generic family of pattern
ensembles, and thanks to the statistical mechanics analysis of an auxiliary
Random Energy Model, we are able to provide exact asymptotic thresholds for the
retrieval of a typical pattern, $\alpha_1$, and lower bounds for the maximum of
the load $\alpha$ for which all patterns can be retrieved, $\alpha_c$.
Additionally, we characterize the size of the basins of attractions. We discuss
in detail the cases of Gaussian and spherical patterns, and show that they
display rich and qualitatively different phase diagrams.

Despite recent advances of layered square-net topological material models
that possess ideal semimetallic electronic structures and promising potential
in material applications, the identification of experimentally accessible
two-dimensional square-net materials with related topological properties has
proven challenging. Due to the highly tunable physical and topological
properties of III-V semiconductors, we revisit the class of III-V materials and
observe that the litharge-phase InBi is a layered square-net material and can
be exfoliated into the InBi monolayer. We present a comprehensive
first-principles study of the energy landscape of the InBi monolayer. We
identify a paraelastic phase and three ferroelastic phases and study their
topological properties. Specifically, we show that the paraelastic InBi
monolayer is a trivial insulator due to the orbital-ordering-induced band
inversion occurring between states with the same parity. Substituting one Bi
atom per cell with another V-group element (N, P, As) or applying an electric
field that breaks the inversion symmetry and changes the orbital onsite energy,
the paraelastic InBi monolayer can be driven into the topological insulator
phase. Furthermore, one of the ferroelastic phases of pure InBi, which can be
obtained by gently straining the paraelastic phase, also possesses such
topological insulating properties. These results provide several experimentally
accessible routes to tune the nontrivial topology in the InBi monolayer,
including creating heterostructures with piezoelectric or ferroelectric
substrates and applying mechanical strain, making the InBi monolayer an ideal
platform to study the interplay of reduced dimensionality, square-net chemical
bonding networks, and band topology.

<h3>Interplay of electron-magnon scattering and spin-orbit induced  electronic spin-flip fcattering in a two-band Stoner model</h3>

Magnons are one of the carriers of angular momentum that are involved in the
ultrafast magnetization dynamics in ferromagnets, but their contribution to the
electronic dynamics and their interplay with other scattering process that
occur during ultrafast demagnetization has not yet been studied in the
framework of a microscopic dynamical model. The present paper presents such an
investigation of electronic scattering dynamics in itinerant ferromagnets at
the level of Boltzmann scattering integrals for the magnon distributions and
spin-dependent electron distributions. In addition to electron-magnon
scattering, we include spin-conserving and effective Elliott-Yafet like
spin-flip electron-electron scattering processes and the influence of phonons.
In our model system, the creation or annihilation of magnons leads to
transitions between two spin-split electronic bands with energy and momentum
conservation. Due to the presence of spin-orbit coupling, Coulomb scattering
transitions between these bands are also possible, and we describe them on an
equal footing in terms of Boltzmann scattering integrals. For an instantaneous
carrier excitation process we analyze the influence of both interaction
processes on the magnon and spin-dependent electron dynamics, and show that
their interplay gives rise to an efficient creation of magnons at higher
energies and wave vectors accompanied by only a small increase of the
electronic spin polarization. These results present a microscopic dynamical
scenario that shows how non-equilibrium magnons may dominate the magnetic
response of a ferromagnet on ultrafast timescales.

We numerically compute the guiding center static structure factor
$\bar{S}(\boldsymbol k)$ of various fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states to
$\mathcal{O}\left((k\ell)^6\right)$. Employing density matrix renormalization
group on an infinite cylinder of circumference $L_y$, we study the
two-dimensional problem using $L_y/\ell \gg 1$. The main findings of our work
are: 1) the ground states that deviate away from the ideal conformal block
wavefunctions, do not saturate the Haldane bound, and 2) the coefficient of
$O\left((k\ell)^6\right)$ term appears to be bounded above by a value predicted
by field theories proposed in the literature.

We propose a vortex Chern insulator, motivated by recent experimental
demonstrations on programmable arrangements of cavity polariton vortices by
[Alyatkin et al., ArXiv:2207.01850 (2022)] and [Wang et al., National Sci. Rev.
10, Nwac096 (2022)]. In the absence of any external fields, time-reversal
symmetry is spontaneously by through polariton condensation into structured
arrangements of localized co-rotating vortices. We characterize the response of
the rotating condensate lattice by calculating the spectrum of Bogoliubov
elementary excitations and observe the crossing of edge-states, of opposite
vorticity, connecting bands with opposite Chern numbers. The emergent
topologically nontrivial energy gap stems from inherent vortex anisotropic
polariton-polariton interactions and does not require any spin-orbit coupling,
external magnetic fields, or elliptically polarized pump fields.

<h3>Auger spectroscopy beyond the ultra-short core-hole relaxation time  approximation</h3>

<i>Alberto Nocera, Adrian Feiguin</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a time-dependent computational approach to study Auger electron
spectroscopy (AES) beyond the ultra-short core-hole relaxation time
approximation and, as a test case, we apply it to the paradigmatic example of a
one-dimensional Mott insulator represented by a half-filled Hubbard chain. The
Auger spectrum is usually calculated by assuming that, after the creation of a
core-hole, the system thermalizes almost instantaneously. This leads to a
relatively simple analytical expression that uses the ground-state with a
core-hole as a reference state and ignores all the transient dynamics related
to the screening of the core-hole. In this picture, the response of the system
can be associated to the pair spectral function. On the other hand, in our
numerical calculations, the core hole is created by a light pulse, allowing one
to study the transient dynamics of the system in terms of the pulse duration
and in the non-perturbative regime. Time-dependent density matrix
renormalization group calculations reveal that the relaxation process involves
the creation of a polarization cloud of doublon excitations that have an effect
similar to photo-doping. As a consequence, there is a leak of spectral weight
to higher energies into what otherwise would be the Mott gap. For longer
pulses, these excited states, mostly comprised of doublons, can dominate the
spectrum. By changing the duration of the light-pulse, the entire screening
process can be resolved in time.

Topological lattice defects, such as dislocations and grain boundaries (GBs),
are ubiquitously present in the bulk of quantum materials and externally
tunable in metamaterials. In terms of robust modes, localized near the defect
cores, they are instrumental in identifying topological crystals, featuring the
hallmark band inversion at a finite momentum (translationally active type).
Here we show that GB superlattices in both two- and three-dimensional
translationally active higher-order topological insulators harbor a myriad of
dispersive modes that are typically placed at finite energies, but always
well-separated from the bulk states. However, when the Burgers vector of the
constituting edge dislocations points toward the gapless corners or hinges,
both second- and third-order topological insulators accommodate self-organized
emergent topological metals in the GB mini Brillouin zone. We discuss possible
material platforms where our proposed scenarios can be realized through
band-structure and defect engineering.
