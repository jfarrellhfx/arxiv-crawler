<h3>Influence of Octahedral Site Chemistry on the Elastic Properties of  Biotite</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10915" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10915</a>
<br>
<i>Dillon F. Hanlon, G. Todd Andrews, Roger A. Mason</i>

<br>
Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy was used along with detailed
composition information obtained from electron probe microanalysis to study the
influence of octahedral site chemistry on the elastic properties of biotite
crystals. Elastic wave velocities for a range of directions in the AC and BC
crystallographic planes were obtained for each crystal by application of the
Brillouin equation with refractive indices and phonon frequencies obtained from
the Becke line test and spectral peak positions, respectively. In general,
velocities increase with decreasing Fe content, approach those of muscovite at
low Fe concentrations. 12 of the 13 elastic constants for the full monoclinic
symmetry were obtained for each crystal by fitting analytic expressions for the
velocities as functions of propagation direction and elastic constants to
corresponding experimental data, with the remaining constant estimated using
hexagonal symmetry. Elastic constants C11, C22, and C66 are comparable to those
of muscovite and show little change with Fe concentration due to strong bonding
within layers. In contrast, nearly all remaining constants show a pronounced
dependence on Fe content, likely due to the weak interlayer bonding. Similar
behaviour is shown by elastic stability, which falls greatly as Fe
concentration increases, and elastic anisotropy within the basal cleavage
plane, which decreases with Fe content. This consistent dependency of all
measured elastic constants on Fe content suggests that biotite elasticity is a
function of octahedral site chemistry and gives a method to determine the
elastic constants and elastic stability of most biotite compositions provided,
Fe or Mg concentrations are known. Moreover, the good agreement between elastic
constants of Fe-poor biotite and those of phlogopite obtained from DFT
simulations indicate a method to predict elastic properties of biotites.

<h3>Brownian noise effects on magnetic focusing of prolate and oblate  spheroids in channel flow</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10918" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10918</a>
<br>
<i>Mohammad Reza Shabanniya, Ali Naji</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate Brownian noise effects on magnetic focusing of prolate and
oblate spheroids carrying permanent magnetic dipoles in channel (Poiseuille)
flow subject to a uniform magnetic field. The focusing is effected by the
low-Reynolds-number wall-induced hydrodynamic lift which can be tuned via tilt
angle of the field relative to the flow direction. This mechanism is
incorporated in a steady-state Smoluchowski equation that we solve numerically
to analyze the noise effects through the joint position-orientation probability
distribution function of spheroids within the channel. The results feature
partial and complete pinning of spheroidal orientation as the field strength is
increased and reveal remarkable and even counterintuitive noise-induced
phenomena (specifically due to translational particle diffusivity) deep into
the strong-field regime. These include field-induced defocusing, or lateral
broadening of the focused spheroidal layer, upon strengthening the field. We
map out focusing `phase' diagrams based on the field strength and tilt angle to
illustrate different regimes of behavior including centered focusing and
defocusing in transverse field, and off-centered focusing in tilted fields. The
latter encompasses two subregimes of optimal and shouldered focusing where
spheroidal density profiles across the channel width display either an isolated
off-centered peak or a skewed peak with a pronounced shoulder stretching toward
the channel center. We corroborate our results by analyzing stability of
deterministic fixed points and a reduced one-dimensional probabilistic theory
which we introduce to semiquantitatively explain noise-induced behavior of
pinned spheroids under strong fields. We also elucidate the implications of our
results for efficient shape-based sorting of magnetic spheroids.

<h3>Polar meron-antimeron networks in twisted bilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10786" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10786</a>

<br>
<br>
Out-of-plane polar domain structures have recently been discovered in twisted
bilayers of inversion symmetry broken systems such as hexagonal boron nitride,
and have been experimentally observed to result in ferroelectricity. Here we
show that this symmetry breaking also gives rise to an in-plane component of
polarization, and the form of the total polarization is determined purely from
symmetry considerations. This implies that the polar properties of bilayer
systems are much richer than previously thought. Furthermore, the in-plane
component reveals that the polar domains in twisted bilayers are topologically
nontrivial, forming a network of merons and antimerons (half-skyrmions and
half-antiskyrmions). We propose that the polar domains in twisted bilayers may
serve as a new platform for topological physics in realistic materials, and
discuss how control over topological phases and phase transitions may be
achieved in such systems.

<h3>One-Dimensional Spin-Polarised Surface States -- A Comparison of Bi(112)  with Other Vicinal Bismuth Surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10809" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10809</a>
<br>
<i>Anna Cecilie Åsland, Johannes Bakkelund, Even Thingstad, Håkon I. Røst, Simon P. Cooil, Jinbang Hu, Ivana Vobornik, Jun Fujii, Asle Sudbø, Justin W. Wells, Federico Mazzola</i>
<br>
<br>
Vicinal surfaces of bismuth are unique test-beds for investigating
one-dimensional (1D) spin-polarised surface states that may one day be used in
spintronic devices. In this work, two such states have been observed for the
(112) surface when measured using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) and spin-resolved ARPES, and when calculated using a tight-binding (TB)
model and with density functional theory (DFT). The surface states appear as
elongated Dirac-cones which are 1D and almost dispersionless in the
${k}_{\text{y}}$-direction, but disperse with energy in the orthogonal
${k}_{\text{x}}$-direction to form two ``$\times$''-like features centered at
the ${k}_{\text{y}}$-line through ${\Gamma}$. Unlike many materials considered
for spintronic applications, their 1D nature suggests that conductivity and
spin-transport properties are highly dependent on direction. The
spin-polarisation of the surface states is mainly in-plane and parallel to the
1D state, but there are signs of a tilted out-of-plane spin-component for one
of them. The Bi(112) surface states resemble those found for other vicinal
surfaces of bismuth, strongly indicating that their existence and general
properties are robust properties of vicinal surfaces of bismuth. Furthermore,
differences in the details of the states, particularly related to their
spin-polarisation, suggest that spin-transport properties may be engineered
simply by precise cutting and polishing of the crystal.

Twisted van der Waals multilayers are widely regarded as a rich platform to
access novel electronic phases, thanks to the multiple degrees of freedom such
as layer thickness and twist angle that allow control of their electronic and
chemical properties. Here, we propose that the stacking domains that form
naturally due to the relative twist between successive layers act as an
additional "knob" for controlling the behavior of these systems, and report the
emergence and engineering of stacking domain-dependent surface chemistry in
twisted few-layer graphene. Using mid-infrared near-field optical microscopy
and atomic force microscopy, we observe a selective adhesion of metallic
nanoparticles and liquid water at the domains with rhombohedral stacking
configurations of minimally twisted double bi- and tri-layer graphene.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the manipulation of nanoparticles located at
certain stacking domains can locally reconfigure the moir\'e superlattice in
their vicinity at the {\mu}m-scale. In addition, we report first-principles
simulations of the energetics of adhesion of metal atoms and water molecules on
the stacking domains in an attempt to elucidate the origin of the observed
selective adhesion. Our findings establish a new approach to controlling
moir\'e-assisted chemistry and nanoengineering.

<h3>Lindblad master equation approach to the topological phase transition in  the disordered Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10856" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10856</a>
<br>
<i>Andrea Nava, Gabriele Campagnano, Pasquale Sodano, Domenico Giuliano</i>
<br>
<br>
We use the Lindblad equation method to investigate the onset of a mobility
edge and the topological phase transition in the disordered SSH chain connected
to two external baths in the large bias limit. From the scaling properties of
the nonequilibrium stationary current flowing across the system, we recover the
localization/delocalization in the disordered chain. To probe the topological
phase transition in the presence of disorder, we use the even-odd differential
occupancy as a mean to discriminate topologically trivial from topologically
nontrival phases in the out-of-equilibirum system. Eventually, we argue how to
generalize our method to other systems undergoing a topological phase
transition in the presence of disorder.

<h3>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition with Rabi coupled  bosons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10866" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10866</a>
<br>
<i>Koichiro Furutani, Andrea Perali, Luca Salasnich</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically investigate the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition
in a binary mixture of bosonic atoms with Rabi coupling under balanced
densities. We develop the Nelson-Kosterlitz renormalization group equations in
the two-component Bose gas and obtain the Nelson-Kosterlitz criterion modified
by a fractional parameter, which is responsible for half-integer vortices, and
by Rabi coupling. Adopting the renormalization group approach, we clarify the
dependence of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature on the
Rabi coupling and the inter-component coupling. In particular, we find the
non-monotonic behavior of the transition temperature with respect to the
inter-component coupling and amplification of the transition temperature for
finite values of Rabi coupling, but for small intra-component couplings. We
also obtain the first sound and second sound velocity, which exhibits
suppression of quasicrossing of the two sound modes with a finite Rabi coupling
in the low-temperature regime.

<h3>Geometry-induced spin-filtering in photoemission maps from WTe$_2$  surface states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10870" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10870</a>
<br>
<i>Tristan Heider, Gustav Bihlmayer, Jakub Schusser, Friedrich Reinert, Jan Minár, Stefan Blügel, Claus M. Schneider, Lukasz Plucinski</i>
<br>
<br>
We demonstrate that an important quantum material WTe$_2$ exhibits a new type
of geometry-induced spin-filtering effect in photoemission, stemming from low
symmetry that is responsible for its exotic transport properties. Through the
laser-driven spin-polarized angle-resolved photoemission Fermi surface mapping,
we showcase highly asymmetric spin textures of electrons photoemitted from the
surface states of WTe$_2$. Such asymmetries are not present in the initial
state spin textures, which are bound by the time-reversal and crystal lattice
mirror plane symmetries. The findings are reproduced qualitatively by
theoretical modeling within the one-step model photoemission formalism. The
effect could be understood within the free-electron final state model as an
interference due to emission from different atomic sites. The observed effect
is a manifestation of time-reversal symmetry breaking of the initial state in
the photoemission process, and as such it cannot be eliminated, but only its
magnitude influenced, by special experimental geometries.

<h3>Stable ion-tunable antiambipolarity in mixed ion-electron conducting  polymers enables biorealistic artificial neurons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10871" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10871</a>

<br>
<br>
Bio-integrated neuromorphic systems promise for new protocols to record and
regulate the signaling of biological systems. Making such artificial neural
circuits successful requires minimal circuit complexity and ion-based operating
mechanisms similar to that of biology. However, simple leaky integrate-and-fire
model neurons, commonly realized in either silicon or organic semiconductor
neuromorphic systems, can emulate only a few neural features. More functional
neuron models, based on traditional complex Si-based
complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) or negative differential
resistance (NDR) device circuits, are complicated to fabricate, not
biocompatible, and lack ion- and chemical-based modulation features. Here we
report a biorealistic conductance-based organic electrochemical neuron (c-OECN)
using a mixed ion-electron conducting ladder-type polymer with reliable
ion-tunable antiambipolarity. The latter is used to emulate the
activation/inactivation of Na channels and delayed activation of K channels of
biological neurons. These c-OECNs can then spike at bioplausible frequencies
nearing 100 Hz, emulate most critical biological neural features, demonstrate
stochastic spiking, and enable neurotransmitter and Ca2+-based spiking
modulation. These combined features are impossible to achieve using previous
technologies.

<h3>Generalised form of the magnetic anisotropy field in micromagnetic and  atomistic spin models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10916" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10916</a>
<br>
<i>Jack B. Collings, Ricardo Rama-Eiroa, Rubén M. Otxoa, Richard F. L. Evans, Roy W. Chantrell</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a general approach to the derivation of the effective anisotropy
field which determines the dynamical behaviour of magnetic spins according to
the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. The approach is based on the gradient in
spherical polar coordinates with the final results being expressed in Cartesian
coordinates as usually applied in atomistic and micromagnetic model
calculations. The approach is generally valid for all orders of anisotropies
including higher order combinations of azimuthal and rotational anisotropies
often found in functional magnetic materials such as permanent magnets and an
emerging class of antiferromagnetic materials with applications in spintronics.
Anisotropies are represented in terms of spherical harmonics which have the
important property of rational temperature scaling. Effective field vectors are
given for anisotropies up to sixth order.

<h3>Realization of a fractional quantum Hall state with ultracold atoms</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10919" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10919</a>
<br>
<i>Julian Léonard, Sooshin Kim, Joyce Kwan, Perrin Segura, Fabian Grusdt, Cécile Repellin, Nathan Goldman, Markus Greiner</i>
<br>
<br>
Strongly interacting topological matter exhibits fundamentally new phenomena
with potential applications in quantum information technology. Emblematic
instances are fractional quantum Hall states, where the interplay of magnetic
fields and strong interactions gives rise to fractionally charged
quasi-particles, long-ranged entanglement, and anyonic exchange statistics.
Progress in engineering synthetic magnetic fields has raised the hope to create
these exotic states in controlled quantum systems. However, except for a recent
Laughlin state of light, preparing fractional quantum Hall states in engineered
systems remains elusive. Here, we realize a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state
with ultracold atoms in an optical lattice. The state is a lattice version of a
bosonic $\nu=1/2$ Laughlin state with two particles on sixteen sites. This
minimal system already captures many hallmark features of Laughlin-type FQH
states: we observe a suppression of two-body interactions, we find a
distinctive vortex structure in the density correlations, and we measure a
fractional Hall conductivity of $\sigma_\text{H}/\sigma_0= 0.6(2)$ via the bulk
response to a magnetic perturbation. Furthermore, by tuning the magnetic field
we map out the transition point between the normal and the FQH regime through a
spectroscopic probe of the many-body gap. Our work provides a starting point
for exploring highly entangled topological matter with ultracold atoms.

<h3>Brownian particles in periodic potentials: coarse-graining versus fine  structure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10935" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10935</a>
<br>
<i>Lucianno Defaveri, Eli Barkai, David A. Kessler</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the motion of an overdamped particle connected to a thermal heat
bath in the presence of an external periodic potential. When the
coarse-graining is larger than the periodicity of the potential, the packet of
spreading particles, all starting from a common origin, converges to a normal
distribution centered at the origin with a mean-squared displacement that grows
like $2 D^* t$, with an effective diffusion constant that is smaller than that
of a freely diffusing particle. We examine the interplay between this
coarse-grained description and the fine structure of the density, which is
given by the Boltzmann-Gibbs factor $e^{-V(x)/k_B T}$, the latter being
non-normalizable. We explain this result and construct a theory of observables
using the Fokker-Planck equation. These observables are classified as those
that are related to the BG fine structure, like the energy or occupation times,
while others, like the positional moments, for long times, converge to those of
the large-scale description. Entropy falls into a special category as it has a
coarse-grained and a fine structure description. The basic thermodynamic
formula $F=TS - E$ is extended to this far from equilibrium system. The ergodic
properties are also studied using tools from infinite ergodic theory.

<h3>Cluster expansion methods from physical concepts</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10937" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10937</a>
<br>
<i>Paul E. Lammert, Vincent H. Crespi</i>
<br>
<br>
The cluster expansion formalism used in materials science is reconstructed on
an axiomatic basis with the aims of clarifying underlying concepts and
improving computational procedures, and without using conventional cluster
functions. Instead, cluster components of configuration functions are defined
in an intrinsic manner, which can be viewed as Moebius inversion of conditional
expectation. The associated method for fitting a model to a configurational
sample is grounded entirely in Hilbert space geometry. By constructing models
directly from the given data, we avoid an underdetermination problem to which
the conventional approach is subject. Tensor observables are treated on an
equal footing with scalar observables.

<h3>Structural distortion induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in  monolayer CrI3 at van der Waals heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10949" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10949</a>
<br>
<i>Hongxing Li, Wei-Bing Zhang, Guanghui Zhou</i>
<br>
<br>
The van der Waals (vdW) magnetic heterostructures provide flexible ways to
realize particular magnetic properties that possess both scientific and
practical significance. Here, by firstprinciples calculation, we predict strong
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMIs) by constructing CrI3/Metal vdW
heterostructures. The underlaying mechanisms are ascribed the large
spin-orbital coupling (SOC) of the I atom and the structural distortion in CrI3
layer caused by interlayer interaction. This is different from the traditional
way that deposit magnetic films on substrate to generate DMI, wherein DMI is
dominated by interlayer hybridization and large SOC of substrates. In addition,
both Heisenberg exchange and magnetic anisotropy are modulated dramatically,
such as Heisenberg exchange is nearly doubled on Au(111), and the out-of-plane
magnetism is enhanced by 88% on Ir(111). Our work may provide a experimentally
accessible strategy to induce DMI in vdW magnetic materials, which will be
helpful to the design of spintronics devices.

<h3>Geodesic path for the optimal nonequilibrium transition:  Momentum-independent protocol</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10986" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10986</a>
<br>
<i>Geng Li, C. P. Sun, Hui Dong</i>
<br>
<br>
Accelerating controlled thermodynamic processes requires an auxiliary
Hamiltonian to steer the system into instantaneous equilibrium states. An extra
energy cost is inevitably needed in such finite-time operation. We recently
develop a geodesic approach to minimize such energy cost for the shortcut to
isothermal process. The auxiliary control typically contains momentum-dependent
terms, which are hard to be experimentally implemented due to the requirement
of constantly monitoring the speed. In this work, we employ a variational
auxiliary control without the momentum-dependent force to approximate the exact
control. Following the geometric approach, we obtain the optimal control
protocol with variational minimum energy cost. We demonstrate the construction
of such protocol via an example of Brownian motion with a controllable harmonic
potential.

<h3>Seebeck coefficient in a nickelate superconductor: electronic dispersion  in the strange metal phase</h3>

<br>
<br>
Superconducting nickelates are a new family of materials that combine
strongly-correlated magnetism with unconventional superconductivity. While
comparisons with the superconducting cuprates are natural, very little is known
about the metallic state of the nickelates, making these comparisons difficult.
We probe the electronic dispersion of thin-film superconducting 5-layer ($n=5$)
and metallic 3-layer ($n=3$) nickelates by measuring the Seebeck coefficient,
$S$. We find a temperature independent and negative $S/T$ for both $n=5$
nickelate and $n=3$ -- in stark contrast with the
strongly-temperature-dependent $S/T$ measured at similar electron filling in
the cuprate La$_{1.36}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.24}$CuO$_4$. We explain the temperature
dependence, sign, and amplitude of the $S/T$ in the nickelates using Boltzmann
transport theory with the band dispersion calculated from density functional
theory. This demonstrates that the electronic structure obtained from first
principle calculations is a good starting point for studying nickelates, and
suggests that, despite indications of strong electronic correlations, there are
well-defined quasiparticles in the metallic state of the nickelates. Finally,
we explain the differences in the Seebeck coefficient between nickelates and
cuprates as originating in strong dissimilarities in impurity concentrations.
Beyond establishing a baseline understanding of the electronic structure in
these new materials, this work once again demonstrates the power of the
semi-classical approach to quantitatively describe transport measurements, even
in the strange-metallic state.

<h3>All-Optical Switching of Antiferromagnetic NiO thin films</h3>

<br>
<br>
We demonstrate how the antiferromagnetic order in heterostructures of NiO/Pt
thin films can be modified by optical pulses. We irradiate our samples with
laser light and identify an optically induced switching of the
antiferromagnetic order by imaging the created domain structure utilizing the
X-ray magnetic linear dichroism effect. We study the effect of different laser
polarizations on the switching and identify a polarization-independent creation
of 180{\deg} domain walls and domains with 180{\deg} different N\'eel vector
orientation. By varying the irradiation parameters, we determine the switching
mechanism to be thermally induced and demonstrate the reversibility. We thus
demonstrate experimentally the possibility to optically create
antiferromagnetic domains, an important step towards future functionalization
of all optical switching mechanisms in antiferromagnets.

<h3>Strong variation of spin-orbit torques with relative spin relaxation  rates in ferrimagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11042" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11042</a>
<br>
<i>Lijun Zhu, Daniel C Ralph</i>
<br>
<br>
Spin-orbit torques (SOTs) have been widely understood as an interfacial
transfer of spin that is independent of the bulk properties of the magnetic
layer. Here, we report that SOTs acting on ferrimagnetic FexTb1-x layers
decrease and vanish upon approaching the magnetic compensation point because
the rate of spin transfer to the magnetization becomes slower than the rate of
spin relaxation into the crystal lattice due to spin-orbit scattering. These
results indicate that the relative rates of competing spin relaxation processes
within magnetic layers play a critical role in determining the strength of
SOTs, which provides a unified understanding for the diverse and even seemingly
puzzling SOT phenomena in ferromagnetic and compensated systems. Our work
indicates that spin-orbit scattering within the magnet should be minimized for
efficient SOT devices. We also find that the interfacial spin-mixing
conductance of interfaces of ferrimagnetic alloys (such as FexTb1-x) is as
large as that of 3d ferromagnets and insensitive to the degree of magnetic
compensation.

<h3>Stacking, correlations and electronic dispersion in the photoexcited  state of 1T-TaS$_2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Here we perform angle and time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy on the
commensurate Charge Density Wave phase of 1T-TaS$_2$. Data with different probe
pulse polarization are employed to map the dispersion of electronic states
below or above the chemical potential. The experimental results are compared to
Density-Functional Theory calculations with a self-consistent evaluation of the
coulomb repulsion. Both out-of-plane dimerization and electronic correlations
must be included in order to obtain good agreement with the experimental data.
Upon Photoexcitation, the fluctuations of CDW order erase the band dispersion
near to the chemical potential and halve the charge gap size. This transient
phase sets within half a period of the coherent lattice motion and is likely
favored by strong electronic correlations.

<h3>Fractonic Luttinger Liquids and Supersolids in a Constrained  Bose-Hubbard Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11072" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11072</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Quantum many-body systems with fracton constraints are widely conjectured to
exhibit unconventional low-energy phases of matter. In this work, we
demonstrate the existence of a variety of such exotic quantum phases in the
ground states of a dipole-moment conserving Bose-Hubbard model in one
dimension. For integer boson fillings, we perform a mapping of the system to a
model of microscopic local dipoles, which are composites of fractons. We apply
a combination of low-energy field theory and large-scale tensor network
simulations to demonstrate the emergence of a novel dipole Luttinger liquid
phase. At non-integer fillings our numerical approach shows an intriguing
compressible state described by a quantum Lifshitz model in which charge
density-wave order coexists with dipole long-range order and superfluidity - a
`dipole supersolid'. While this supersolid state may eventually be unstable
against lattice effects in the thermodynamic limit, its numerical robustness is
remarkable. We discuss potential experimental implications of our results.

<i>Zeying Zhang, Weikang Wu, Gui-Bin Liu, Zhi-Ming Yu, Shengyuan A. Yang, Yugui Yao</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a systematic classification of emergent particles in all 528
magnetic layer groups and 394 magnetic rod groups, which describe
two-dimensional and one-dimensional crystals respectively. Our approach is via
constructing a correspondence between a given magnetic layer/rod group and one
of the magnetic space group, such that all irreducible representations of the
layer/rod group can be derived from those of the corresponding space group.
Based on these group representations, we explicitly construct the effective
models for possible band degeneracies and identify all emergent particles,
including both spinless and spinful cases. We find that there are six kinds of
particles protected by magnetic layer groups and three kinds by magnetic rod
groups. Our work provides a useful reference for the search and design of
emergent particles in lower dimensional crystals.

We study theoretically analog multi-terminal Josephson junctions formed by
gapped superfluids created upon resonant pumping of cavity exciton-polaritons.
We study the $p$-like bands of a 5-terminal junction in the 4D parameter space
created by the superfluid phases acting as quasi-momenta. We find 4/6 Weyl
points in 3D subspaces with preserved/broken time-reversal symmetry. We link
the real space topology (vortices) to the parameter space one (Weyl points). We
derive an effective Hamiltonian encoding the creation, motion, and annihilation
of Weyl nodes in 4D. Our work paves the way to the study of exotic topological
phases in a platform allowing direct measurement of eigenstates and band
topology.

<br>
<br>
We apply quantum optimal control to shape the phase-space distribution of
Bose-Einstein condensates in a one-dimensional optical lattice. By a
time-dependent modulation of the lattice position, determined from optimal
control theory, we prepare, in the phase space of each lattice site, translated
and squeezed Gaussian states, and superpositions of Gaussian states. Complete
reconstruction of these non-trivial states is performed through a maximum
likelihood state tomography. As a practical application of our method to
quantum simulations, we initialize the atomic wavefunction in an optimal
Floquet-state superposition to enhance dynamical tunneling signals.

Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of optoelectronic excitation and
relaxation pathways on the single-molecule level has only recently been started
by combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) with
STM-induced luminescence (STML). In this paper, we investigate cationic and
anionic fluorescence of individual zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) molecules
adsorbed on ultrathin NaCl films on Ag(111) by using STML. They depend on the
tip-sample bias polarity and appear at threshold voltages that are correlated
with the onset energies of particular molecular orbitals, as identified by STS.
We also find that the fluorescence is caused by a single electron tunneling
process. Comparing with results from density functional theory calculations, we
propose an alternative many-body picture to describe the charging and
electroluminescence mechanism. Our study provides aspects toward well-defined
voltage selectivity of bipolar electrofluorochromism, as well as fundamental
insights regarding the role of transiently charged states of emitter molecules
within OLED devices.

<h3>Where the really hard sampling problems are</h3>

<br>
<i>Simone Ciarella, Jeanne Trinquier, Martin Weigt, Francesco Zamponi</i>
<br>
<br>
Several strategies have been recently proposed in order to improve Monte
Carlo sampling efficiency using machine learning tools. Here, we reconsider
previous studies and find that most of the sampling problems that were
considered before are not sufficiently hard. We then consider a class of
problems that are known to be exponentially hard to sample using conventional
local Monte Carlo at low enough temperatures, including in particular the
antiferromagnetic Potts model on a random graph, which reduces to the coloring
of random graphs at zero temperature. We test several machine-learning-assisted
Monte Carlo approaches, and we find that they all fail. Our work thus provide
good benchmarks for future proposals for smart sampling algorithms.

<br>
<br>
The long-term stability of halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) remains the
critical problem of this photovoltaic technology. Different structural defects
formed in the thin-film perovskite films were considered as a main trigger for
the decomposition of the absorber and corrosion of the interfaces in the device
structure. The changes in the stability performance of the PSCs require a
detailed analysis of the defects generated under external stress (light and
heat). Using admittance, deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) and reverse
DLTS we determined the evolution of the defect energy levels in p-i-n PCS under
continuous light soaking stress. We compared the impact of the charged defects
on the performance and long-term stability of the CsFAPbI3 based devices with
and without Cl-doping. Despite the gain in the output performance of the PCSs,
the devices with CsFAPbI3-xClx showed improved light soaking stability. The T80
(time required to reduce initial efficiency by 20%) for Cl-doped PSCs was
1280h, while for pure CsFAPbI3 based devices only 650h. Three different defect
energy levels were determined for different device configurations. We found
that Cl-doping suppressed the formation of the antisite defects (IPb, IFA) and
iodine interstitials (Ii). The changes in the defect's energy levels after
continuous light soaking stress were analyzed and discussed. The present work
provides new insights for the defect behavior of PSCs under continuous external
stress, revealing the physical-chemical impact of the Cl-additive strategy.

<h3>Efficient inference in the transverse field Ising model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11193" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11193</a>
<br>
<i>E. Domínguez, H. J. Kappen</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper we introduce an approximate method to solve the quantum cavity
equations for transverse field Ising models. The method relies on a projective
approximation of the exact cavity distributions of imaginary time trajectories
(paths). A key feature, novel in the context of similar algorithms, is the
explicit separation of the classical and quantum parts of the distributions.
Numerical simulations show accurate results in comparison with the sampled
solution of the cavity equations, the exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian
(when possible) and other approximate inference methods in the literature. The
computational complexity of this new algorithm scales linearly with the
connectivity of the underlying lattice, enabling the study of highly connected
networks, as the ones often encountered in quantum machine learning problems.

<h3>Removing grid structure in angle-resolved photoemission spectra via deep  learning method</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11200" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11200</a>
<br>
<i>Junde Liu, Dongchen Huang, Yi-feng Yang, Tian Qian</i>
<br>
<br>
Spectroscopic data may often contain unwanted extrinsic signals. For example,
in ARPES experiment, a wire mesh is typically placed in front of the CCD to
block stray photo-electrons, but could cause a grid-like structure in the
spectra during quick measurement mode. In the past, this structure was often
removed using the mathematical Fourier filtering method by erasing the periodic
structure. However, this method may lead to information loss and vacancies in
the spectra because the grid structure is not strictly linearly superimposed.
Here, we propose a deep learning method to effectively overcome this problem.
Our method takes advantage of the self-correlation information within the
spectra themselves and can greatly optimize the quality of the spectra while
removing the grid structure and noise simultaneously. It has the potential to
be extended to all spectroscopic measurements to eliminate other extrinsic
signals and enhance the spectral quality based on the self-correlation of the
spectra solely.

<h3>Theory of resonant Raman scattering due to spin-flips of resident charge  carries and excitons in perovskite semiconductors</h3>

We have developed a theory of Raman scattering with single and double spin
flips of localized resident electrons and holes as well as nonequilibrium
localized excitons in semiconductor perovskite crystals under optical
excitation in the resonant exciton region. Scattering mechanisms involving
localized excitons, biexcitons and exciton polaritons as intermediate states
has been examined, the spin-flip Raman scattering by polaritons being a novel
mechanism. The derived equations are presented in the invariant form allowing
one for the analysis of the dependence of scattering efficiency on the
polarization of the initial and scattered light and on the orientation of the
external magnetic field.

<br>
<br>
Spectroscopy experiments are routinely used to characterize the behavior of
strongly correlated systems. An in-depth understanding of the different
spectral features is thus essential. Here, we show that the spectrum of the
multiorbital Hubbard model exhibits unique Hund excitations that occur at
energies given only by the Hund coupling $J_\mathrm{H}$, as distinct from the
Hubbard satellites following the interaction $U$. We focus on the
experimentally relevant single-particle and optical spectra that we calculate
for a model related to iron pnictide ladders. The calculations are performed
via the density-matrix renormalization group and Lanczos methods and the
generality of the implications is verified by considering a generic
multiorbital model within the dynamical mean-field theory.

<h3>Efficient Chebyshev polynomial approach to quantum conductance  calculations: Application to twisted bilayer graphene</h3>

<br>
<i>Santiago Giménez de Castro, Aires Ferreira, D. A. Bahamon</i>
<br>
<br>
In recent years, Chebyshev polynomial expansions of tight-binding Green's
functions have been successfully applied to the study of a wide range of
spectral and transport properties of materials. However, the application of the
Chebyshev approach to the study of quantum transport properties of
noninteracting mesoscopic systems with leads has been hampered by the lack of a
suitable Chebyshev expansion of Landaeur's formula or one of its equivalent
formulations in terms of Green's functions in Keldysh's perturbation theory.
Here, we tackle this issue by means of a hybrid approach that combines the
efficiency of Chebyshev expansions with the convenience of complex absorbing
potentials to calculate the conductance of two-terminal devices in a
computationally expedient and accurate fashion. The versatility of the approach
is demonstrated for mesoscopic twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) devices with up
to $2.3\times10^6$ atomic sites. Our results highlight the importance of
moir\'e effects, interlayer scattering events and twist-angle disorder in
determining the conductance curves in devices with a small twist angle near the
TBG magic angle $\theta_m \approx 1.1^\circ$.

<br>
Motivated by the anisotropic interactions between fish, we implement
spatially anisotropic and therefore non-reciprocal interactions in the 2D
Vicsek model. We map this model onto the 2D Ising model by investigating
stationary swimmers confined to a grid. Local perturbations to the
magnetization/polarization in this out-of-equilibrium system manifest
themselves as traveling waves of spin states along the lattice. The speed and
directionality of these traveling waves are controllable by the orientation and
magnitude of the non-reciprocal interaction kernel as well as the proximity of
the system to the critical temperature. Further, we show that the model with
non-reciprocal interactions alters the system critical temperature away from
that of the traditional 2D Ising model.

As a new quantum state, topological insulators have become the focus of
condensed matter and material science. The open system research of topological
insulators has aroused the interest of many researchers. Recently, many
aspects, especially experimental aspects, have been developed rapidly, such as
prediction and discovery of many novel quantum effects and applications of
topological properties of new materials, but the theoretical research is
slightly tough. In this paper, we study the response of topological insulator
driven by momentum-carrying single-mode field. We solve the ground state of the
system after the addition of a single mode light field with adjustable photon
momentum. Specifically, We show that from the analytical solution of hall
conductance compared with the closed system, there is an extra correction term,
and hall conductance can no longer be expressed in terms of the chern number or
the weighted sum of the chern number. Furthermore, the topological properties
are analyzed and discussed through the results of different instance with their
illustration. Such as, the phase transition point of topological phase is
robust to the environment, and the system still has topological phase
transition. It is expected to be realized or controlled by experiments, and our
observations may contribute to its application and extension in condensed
matter physics and quantum statistical physics.

We study the effect of uniaxial strain on the band structure of ZrSe$_3$, a
semiconducting material with a marked in-plane structural anisotropy. By using
a modified 3-point bending test apparatus, thin ZrSe$_3$ flakes were subjected
to uniaxial strain along different crystalline orientations monitoring the
effect of strain on their optical properties through micro-reflectance
spectroscopy. The obtained spectra showed excitonic features that blueshift
upon uniaxial tension. This shift is strongly dependent on the direction along
which the strain is being applied. When the flakes are strained along the
b-axis, the exciton peak shifts at ~ 60-95 meV/%, while along the a-axis, the
shift only reaches ~ 0-15 meV/%. Ab initio calculations were conducted to study
the influence of uniaxial strain, applied along different crystal directions,
on the band structure and reflectance spectra of ZrSe$_3$, exhibiting a
remarkable agreement with the experimental results.

Superconducting nanowires are very important due to their applications
ranging from quantum technology to astronomy. In this work, we implement a
non-invasive process to fabricate nanowires of high-$T_\text{c}$ superconductor
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO). We demonstrate that our nanowires
can be used as bolometers in the visible range with very high responsivity of
9.7 $\times$ 10$^{3}$ V/W. Interestingly, in a long (30 $\mu$m) nanowire of 9
nm thickness and 700 nm width, we observe bias current-dependent localized
spots of maximum photovoltage. Moreover, the scalability of the bolometer
responsivity with the normal state resistance of the nanowire could allow
further performance improvement by increasing the nanowire length in a meander
geometry. We observe phase slip events in nanowires with small cross-sections
(12 nm thick, 300 nm wide, and 3 $\mu$m long) at low temperatures. Our study
presents a scalable method for realizing sensitive bolometers working near the
liquid-nitrogen temperature.

Symmetry plays a critical role in determining various properties of a
material. Semiconducting p-n junction diode exemplifies the engineered skew
electronic response and is at the heart of contemporary electronic circuits.
The non-reciprocal charge transport in a diode arises from doping-induced
breaking of inversion symmetry. Breaking of time-reversal, in addition to
inversion symmetry in some superconducting systems, leads to an analogous
device - the superconducting diode. Following the pioneering first
demonstration of the superconducting diode effect (SDE), a plethora of new
systems showing similar effect have been reported. SDE lays the foundation for
realizing ultra-low dissipative circuits, while Josephson phenomena-based SDE
can enable realization of protected qubits. However, SDE reported thus far is
at low temperatures ($\sim$ 4 K or lower) and impedes their adaptation to
technological applications. Here we demonstrate a superconducting diode working
up to 77 K using an artificial Josephson junction (AJJ) of twisted layers of
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO). The non-reciprocal response
manifests as an asymmetry in the magnitude of switching currents and their
distributions independent of the twist angle. The asymmetry is tunable with a
very small magnetic field applied perpendicular to the junction. We report a
record asymmetry of 60 % at 20 K. Crucially, the AJJ at the interface that
breaks inversion symmetry shows the SDE, while naturally occurring intrinsic
Josephson junctions (IJJ) in the crystal do not. Our results provide a path
toward realizing superconducting quantum circuits at liquid nitrogen
temperature.

<br>
Monolayer 1T'-WTe$_2$ has been the first two-dimensional crystal where a
quantum spin Hall phase was experimentally observed. In addition, recent
experiments and theoretical modeling reported the presence of a robust
excitonic insulating phase. While first-principles calculations with hybrid
functionals and several measurements at low temperatures suggest the presence
of a band gap of the order of 50 meV, experiments could confirm the presence of
the helical edge states only up to 100 K. Here, we study with first-principle
simulations the temperature effects on the electronic structure of monolayer
1T'-WTe$_2$ and consider the contributions of both thermal expansion and
electron-phonon coupling. First, we show that thermal expansion is weak but
tends to increase the indirect band gap. Then, we calculate the effect of
electron-phonon coupling on the band structure with non-perturbative methods
and observe a small reduction of the band inversion with increasing
temperature. Notably, the topological phase and the presence of a finite gap
are found to be particularly robust to thermal effects up to high temperatures.

<br>
We develop a phase-space ab-initio formalism to compute Ballistic Electron
Emission Spectroscopy current-voltage I(V)'s in a metal-semiconductor
interface. We consider injection of electrons into the conduction band for
direct bias ($V>0$) and injection of holes into the valence band or injection
of secondary Auger electrons into the conduction band for reverse bias ($V<0$).
Here, an ab-initio description of the semiconductor inversion layer (spanning
hundreds of Angstroms) is needed. Such formalism is helpful to get
parameter-free best-fit values for the Schottky barrier, a key technological
characteristic for metal-semiconductor rectifying interfaces. We have applied
the theory to characterize the Au/Ge(001) interface; a double barrier is found
for electrons injected into the conduction band -- either directly or created
by the Auger process -- while only a single barrier has been identified for
holes injected into the valence band.

The existence of the V3+ ion orbital moment is the open issue of the nature
of magnetism in the van der Waals ferromagnet VI3. The huge magnetocrystalline
anisotropy in conjunction with the significantly reduced ordered magnetic
moment compared to the spin-only value provides strong but indirect evidence of
a significant V orbital moment. We used the unique capability of X-ray magnetic
circular dichroism to determine the orbital component of the total magnetic
moment and provide for the first time a direct proof of an exceptionally
sizable orbital moment of the V3+ ion in VI3. Our ligand field multiplet
simulations of the XMCD spectra in synergy with the results of DFT calculations
agree with the existence of two V sites with different orbital occupations and
therefore different OM magnitudes in the ground state.

<i>S. P. Fitzgerald, A. Bailey Hass, G. Díaz Leines, A. J. Archer</i>
<br>
<br>
The time evolution of many physical, chemical, and biological systems can be
modelled by stochastic transitions between the minima of the potential energy
surface describing the system of interest. We show that in cases where there
are two (or more) possible pathways that the system can take, the time
available for the transition to occur is crucially important. The well-known
results of reaction rate theory for determining the rates of the transitions
apply in the long-time limit. However, at short times, the system can instead
choose to pass over higher energy barriers with much higher probability, as
long as the distance to travel in phase space is shorter. We construct two
simple models to illustrate this general phenomenon. We also present an
extension of the gMAM algorithm of Vanden-Eijnden and Heymann [J. Chem. Phys.
{\bf 128}, 061103 (2008)] to determine the most likely path at both short and
long times.

Sampling from the low-temperature Boltzmann distribution of spin glasses is a
hard computational task, relevant for physics research and important
optimization problems in engineering and finance. Adiabatic quantum computers
are being used to tackle the optimization task, corresponding to find the
lowest energy spin configuration. In this article, we show how to exploit
quantum annealers to accelerate equilibrium Markov chain Monte Carlo
simulations of spin glasses at low temperature. Generative neural networks are
trained on spin configurations produced by a D-Wave quantum annealer. They are
then used to generate smart proposals for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. In
particular, we explore hybrid schemes by combining single spin-flip and neural
proposals, as well as D-Wave and classical Monte Carlo training data. The
hybrid algorithm outperforms the single spin-flip Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm. It is competitive with parallel tempering in terms of correlation
times, with the significant benefit of a much faster equilibration.

We describe measurements of the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and spin-flop
rotation of the N\'eel vector in antiferromagnetic CuMnAs thin films using
neutron diffraction. The suppression of the magnetic (100) peak under magnetic
fields is observed for films as thin as 20 nm indicating that they undergo a
spin-flop transition. Good agreement is found between neutron diffraction and
electron transport measurements of the spin-flop rotation in the same layer,
with a similar shape and hysteresis of the obtained curves, while the neutron
measurements provide a quantitative determination of the spin flop extent
throughout the antiferromagnet layer.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials are among the most promising candidates for
beyond-silicon electronic, optoelectronic and quantum computing applications.
Recently, their recognized importance sparked a push to discover and
characterize novel 2D materials. Within a few years, the number of
experimentally exfoliated or synthesized 2D materials went from a couple of
dozens to more than a hundred, with the number of theoretically predicted
compounds reaching a few thousands. In 2018 we first contributed to this effort
with the identification of 1825 compounds that are either easily (1036) or
potentially (789) exfoliable from experimentally known 3D compounds. Here, we
report on a major expansion of this 2D portfolio thanks to the extension of the
screening protocol to an additional experimental database (MPDS) as well as to
the updated versions of the two databases (ICSD and COD) used in our previous
work. This expansion has led to the discovery of additional 1252 unique
monolayers, bringing the total to 3077 compounds and, notably, almost doubling
the number of easily exfoliable materials (2004). Moreover, we optimized the
structural properties of all these monolayers and explored their electronic
structure with a particular emphasis on those rare large-bandgap 2D materials
that could be precious to isolate 2D field effect transistors channels.
Finally, for each material containing up to 6 atoms per unit cell, we
identified the best candidates to form commensurate heterostructures, balancing
requirements on the supercells size and minimal strain.

cavity field. Here, we study a two-component spin Bose-Hubbard system with
cavity-mediated interactions. We provide a comprehensive overview of its phase
diagram and transitions in experimentally relevant regimes. The interplay of
different energy scales yields a rich phase diagram with superfluid and
insulating phases exhibiting density modulation or spin ordering. In
particular, the combined effect of contact and global-range interactions gives
rise to an antiferromagnetically ordered phase for arbitrarily small
spin-dependent light-matter coupling, while long-range and inter-spin contact
interactions introduce regions of instability and phase separation in the phase
diagram. We further study the low energy excitations above the
antiferrogmagnetic phase. Besides particle-hole branches, it hosts
spin-exchange excitations with a tunable energy gap. The studied lattice model
can be readily realized in cold-atom experiments with optical cavities.

A collection of thin structures buckle, bend, and bump into each-other when
confined. This contact can lead to the formation of patterns: hair will
self-organize in curls; DNA strands will layer into cell nuclei; paper, when
crumpled, will fold in on itself, forming a maze of interleaved sheets. This
pattern formation changes how densely the structures can pack, as well as the
mechanical properties of the system. How and when these patterns form, as well
as the force required to pack these structures is not currently understood.
Here we study the emergence of order in a canonical example of packing in
slender-structures, i.e. a system of parallel growing elastic beams. Using
experiments, simulations, and simple theory from statistical mechanics, we
predict the amount of growth (or, equivalently, the amount of compression) of
the beams that will guarantee a global system order, which depends only on the
initial geometry of the system. Furthermore, we find that the compressive
stiffness and stored bending energy of this meta-material is directly
proportional to the number of beams that are geometrically frustrated at any
given point. We expect these results to elucidate the mechanisms leading to
pattern formation in these kinds of systems, and to provide a new mechanical
meta-material, with a tunable resistance to compressive force.

The electronic structure of matter is of fundamental importance for chemistry
and materials science. Modeling and simulation rely primarily on density
functional theory (DFT), which has become the principal method for predicting
electronic structures. While DFT calculations have proven to be incredibly
useful, their computational scaling limits them to small systems. We have
developed a machine-learning framework for predicting the electronic structure
of a given atomic configuration at a much lower computational cost than DFT.
Our model demonstrates up to three orders of magnitude speedup on systems where
DFT is tractable. By leveraging mappings within local atomic environments, our
framework also enables robust electronic structure calculations at yet
unattainable length scales. Our work demonstrates how machine learning
circumvents the long-standing computational bottleneck of DFT.

<h3>Practical Forecasting of AC Losses in Multi-layer 2G-HTS Cold Dielectric  Conductors</h3>

With the recent progresses on the designing and manufacturing of lightweight
and high engineering current density superconducting cables, the need for an
established, fast, and sufficiently accurate computational model for the
forecasting of AC-losses in cold-dielectric conductors, is pivotal for
increasing the investment confidence of power grid operators. However,
validating such models is not an easy task, this because on the one hand, there
is a low availability of experimental results for large scale power cables and,
on the other hand, there is a large number of 2G-HTS tapes involved whose
cross-sectional aspect ratio hinders the numerical convergence of the models
within reasonable delivery times. Thus, aiming to overcome this challenge, we
present a detailed two-dimensional H-model capable to reproduce the
experimentally measured AC-losses of multi-layer power cables made of tens of
2G-HTS tapes. Two cable designs with very high critical currents have been
considered, the first rated at 1.7 kA critical current, consisting of fifty 4
mm width 2G-HTS tapes, these split in 5 concentric layers wound over a
cylindrical former, with the three inner layers forming an arrangement of 24
tapes shielded by two further layers with 13 tapes each. This cable is
contrasted with a size wise equivalent cable with 67 superconducting tapes
rated at 3.2 kA critical current, whose design implies the use of 40 tapes of 3
mm width split within four core layers, and 27 tapes of 4 mm width distributed
in two shielding layers. In both situations a remarkable resemblance between
the simulations and experiments has been found, rendering to acceptable
estimates of the AC-losses for cold dielectric conductors, and offering a
unique view of the local electrodynamics of the wound tapes where the
mechanisms of shielding, magnetization, and transport currents can coexist
within the hysteretic process.

<h3>Subdiffusion equation with fractional Caputo time derivative with  respect to another function in modeling transition from ordinary subdiffusion  to superdiffusion</h3>

We use a subdiffusion equation with fractional Caputo time derivative with
respect to another function $g$ ($g$--subdiffusion equation) to describe a
smooth transition from ordinary subdiffusion to superdiffusion. Ordinary
subdiffusion is described by the equation with the ``ordinary'' fractional
Caputo time derivative, superdiffusion is described by the equation with a
fractional Riesz type spatial derivative. We find the function $g$ for which
the solution (Green's function, GF) to the $g$--subdiffusion equation takes the
form of GF for ordinary subdiffusion in the limit of small time and GF for
superdiffusion in the limit of long time. To solve the $g$--subdiffusion
equation we use the $g$--Laplace transform method. It is shown that the scaling
properties of the GF for ordinary subdiffusion and the GF for superdiffusion
are the same in the long time limit. We conclude that for a sufficiently long
time the $g$--subdiffusion equation describes superdiffusion well, despite a
different stochastic interpretation of the processes. Then, paradoxically, a
subdiffusion equation with a fractional time derivative describes
superdiffusion. The superdiffusive effect is achieved here not by making
anomalously long jumps by a diffusing particle, but by greatly increasing the
particle jump frequency which is derived by means of the $g$--continuous time
random walk model. The $g$--subdiffusion equation is shown to be quite general,
it can be used in modeling of processes in which a kind of diffusion change
continuously over time. In addition, some methods used in modeling of ordinary
subdiffusion processes, such as the derivation of local boundary conditions at
a thin partially permeable membrane, can be used to model $g$--subdiffusion
processes, even if this process is interpreted as superdiffusion.

<h3>Electromagnetic Assessment and AC Losses of Triaxial Cables with  Multiple 2G-HTS Layers Per Phase</h3>

For an accurate estimation of the AC losses of superconducting triaxial
cables, we present a 2D model capable to provide a global assessment of
multi-layer triaxial cables, validated against the AC-losses on single-phase
cables provided by the VNIIKP Cable Institute. Four models are presented, the
first being a single-phase cable of 50 tapes and the others being three
triaxial cables made of up to 135 coated conductors distributed in up to 9
layers. A systematic study is devised, where the number of layers per phase
increases from 1 to 3, with at least 14 tapes distributed across each layer of
the first (innermost) phase, 15 in the secondary (middle) phase, and 16 in the
third (outermost) phase, respectively. Remarkably, our results reveal that the
simple strategy of considering an unbalanced distribution for the amplitudes of
the applied current, can generally balance the magnetic field between the three
phases even for the bilayer and trilayer cables, resulting in negligible
magnetic leaks in all situations. Besides, our simulations allow to see for the
first time how the transport and magnetization currents distribute across the
thickness of all the superconducting tapes, from which we have found that the
AC-losses of the 2nd phase is generally higher than at the other phases at low
to moderate transport currents Itr < 0.8 Ic. Nevertheless, depending on whether
the Ic of the SC tapes at the 3rd phase layers is lower than the one at the 2nd
phase, the layers at the third phase can exhibit a considerable increment on
the AC losses, as result of the considered magneto angular anisotropy of the
HTS tapes, which lead to intriguing electromagnetic features that suggest a
practical threshold for the applied transport current, being it 0.8 Ic.
Likewise, the relative change in the AC-losses per adding layers, per phase,
and as a function of the applied current is disclosed.

The ultrafast and element-specific response of magnetic systems containing
ferromagnetic 3d transition metals and 4d/5d heavy metals is of interest both
from a fundamental as well as an applied research perspectives. However, to
date no consensus about the main microscopic processes describing the interplay
between intrinsic 3d and induced 4d/5d magnetic moments upon femtosecond laser
excitation exist. In this work, we study the ultrafast response of CoFeB/Pt
bilayers with resonant, core-hole spectroscopy in the extreme ultraviolet
spectral range using high harmonic radiation. We show that the combination of
magnetic scattering simulations and analysis of the energy- and time-dependent
magnetic asymmetries allows to accurately disentangle the element-specific
response in spite of overlapping Co and Fe M$_{2,3}$ as well as Pt O$_{2,3}$
and N$_7$ resonances. We find a considerably smaller demagnetization time
constant as well as much larger demagnetization amplitudes of the induced
moment of Pt compared to the intrinsic moment of CoFeB. Our results are in
agreement with enhanced spin-flip probabilities due to the higher spin-orbit
coupling localized at the heavy metal Pt compared to Fe and Co, as well as with
the recently formulated hypothesis of a strong sensitivity to the average spin
orientation between intrinsic and induced magnetic moments following a laser
generated incoherent magnon population.

<h3>Quantum-Inspired Tempering for Ground State Approximation using  Artificial Neural Networks</h3>

A large body of work has demonstrated that parameterized artificial neural
networks (ANNs) can efficiently describe ground states of numerous interesting
quantum many-body Hamiltonians. However, the standard variational algorithms
used to update or train the ANN parameters can get trapped in local minima,
especially for frustrated systems and even if the representation is
sufficiently expressive. We propose a parallel tempering method that
facilitates escape from such local minima. This methods involves training
multiple ANNs independently, with each simulation governed by a Hamiltonian
with a different "driver" strength, in analogy to quantum parallel tempering,
and it incorporates an update step into the training that allows for the
exchange of neighboring ANN configurations. We study instances from two classes
of Hamiltonians to demonstrate the utility of our approach. The first instance
is based on a permutation-invariant Hamiltonian whose landscape stymies the
standard training algorithm by drawing it increasingly to a false local
minimum. The second instance is four hydrogen atoms arranged in a rectangle,
which is an instance of the second quantized electronic structure Hamiltonian
discretized using Gaussian basis functions. We study this problem in a minimal
basis set, which exhibits false minima that can trap the standard variational
algorithm despite the problem's small size. We show that augmenting the
training with quantum parallel tempering becomes useful to finding good
approximations to the ground states of these problem instances.

<h3>Hall Effect Induced by Topologically Trivial Target Skyrmions</h3>

Electrons moving through a noncoplanar magnetic texture acquire a Berry
phase, which can be described as an effective magnetic field. This effect is
known as the topological Hall effect and has been observed in topological spin
textures. Motivated by recent experimental realizations, here we study the Hall
effect in a nontopological magnetic texture known as a target skyrmion. We
start from a simplified semiclassical picture and show that the Hall signal is
a nonmonotonic function of both the electronic energy and target skyrmion
radius. That observation carries over to the fully quantum mechanical treatment
in a Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism in a mesoscopic setting. Our conclusion
challenges the popular opinion in the community that the Hall effect in such
structures necessarily requires a nonzero skyrmion number.
