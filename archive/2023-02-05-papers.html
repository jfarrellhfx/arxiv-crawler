<h3>Towards active learning: A stopping criterion for the sequential  sampling of grain boundary degrees of freedom</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01603" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01603</a>

Many materials processes and properties depend on the anisotropy of the
energy of grain boundaries, i.e. on the fact that this energy is a function of
the five geometric degrees of freedom (DOF) of the grain boundaries. To access
this parameter space in an efficient way and discover energy cusps in
unexplored regions, a method was recently established, which combines atomistic
simulations with statistical methods 10.1002/adts.202100615. This sequential
sampling technique is now extended in the spirit of an active learning
algorithm by adding a criterion to decide when the sampling is advanced enough
to stop. To this instance, two parameters to analyse the sampling results on
the fly are introduced: the number of cusps, which correspond to the most
interesting and important regions of the energy landscape, and the maximum
change of energy between two sequential iterations. Monitoring these two
quantities provides valuable insight into how the subspaces are energetically
structured. The combination of both parameters provides the necessary
information to evaluate the sampling of the 2D subspaces of grain boundary
plane inclinations of even non-periodic, low angle grain boundaries. With a
reasonable number of datapoints in the initial design, only a few sequential
iterations already influence the accuracy of the sampling substantially and the
new algorithm outperforms regular high-throughput sampling.

<h3>Islands of Chiral Solitons in Integer Spin Kitaev Chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01347" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01347</a>
<br>
<i>Erik S. Sørensen, Jonathon Riddell, Hae-Young Kee</i>
<br>
<br>
An intriguing chiral soliton phase has recently been identified in the
$S$=1/2 Kitaev spin chain. Here we show that for $S$=1,2,3,4,5 an analogous
phase can be identified, but contrary to the $S$=1/2 case the chiral soliton
phases appear as islands within the sea of the polarized phase. In fact, a
small field applied in a general direction will adiabatically connect the
integer spin Kitaev chain to the polarized phase. Only at sizable intermediate
fields along symmetry directions does the soliton phase appear centered around
the special point $h^\star_x$=$h^\star_y$=$S$ where two exact product
ground-states can be identified. The large $S$ limit can be understood from a
semi-classical analysis, and variational calculations provide a detailed
picture of the $S$=1 soliton phase. Under open boundary conditions, the chain
has a single soliton in the ground-state which can be excited, leading to a
proliferation of in-gap states. In contrast, even length periodic chains
exhibit a gap above a twice degenerate ground-state. The presence of solitons
leaves a distinct imprint on the low temperature specific heat.

<h3>Revisiting the replica trick: Competition between spin glass and  conventional order</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01361" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01361</a>

<br>
<br>
There is an ambiguity in how to apply the replica trick to spin glass models
which have additional order parameters unrelated to spin glass order -- with
respect to which quantities does one minimize vs maximize the action, and in
what sequence? Here we show that the correct procedure is to first maximize
with respect to ``replica'' order parameters, and then minimize with respect to
``conventional'' order parameters. With this result, we further elucidate the
relationship between quenched free energies, annealed free energies, and
replica order. Phase transitions in which the quenched and annealed free
energies become unequal, which we term ``self-averaging transitions'', do not
necessarily correspond to the appearance of replica order. In fact, the
quenched and annealed ensembles can each undergo transitions entirely
independently of the other.

<h3>Controlling the Skyrmion Density and Size for Quantized Convolutional  Neural Networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01390" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01390</a>

<br>
<br>
Skyrmion devices show energy efficient and high integration data storage and
computing capabilities. Herein, we present the results of experimental and
micromagnetic investigations of the creation and stability of magnetic
skyrmions in the Ta/IrMn/CoFeB/MgO thin film system. We investigate the
magnetic-field dependence of the skyrmion density and size using polar magneto
optical Kerr effect MOKE microscopy supported by a micromagnetic study. The
evolution of the topological charge with time under a magnetic field is
investigated, and the transformation dynamics are explained. Furthermore,
considering the voltage control of these skyrmion devices, we evaluate the
dependence of the skyrmion size and density on the Dzyaloshinskii Moriya
interaction and the magnetic anisotropy. We furthermore propose a skyrmion
based synaptic device based on the results of the MOKE and micromagnetic
investigations. We demonstrate the spin-orbit torque controlled discrete
topological resistance states with high linearity and uniformity in the device.
The discrete nature of the topological resistance makes it a good candidate to
realize hardware implementation of weight quantization in a quantized neural
network (QNN). The neural network is trained and tested on the CIFAR10 dataset,
where the devices act as synapses to achieve a recognition accuracy of 87%,
which is comparable to the result of ideal software-based methods.

<h3>Electronic transport in bent carbon nanotubes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01395" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01395</a>
<br>
<i>Eric Kleinherbers, Thomas Stegmann, Nikodem Szpak</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the electronic transport through uniformly bent carbon nanotubes.
For this purpose, we describe the nanotube with the tight-binding model and
calculate the local current flow by employing non-equilibrium Green's functions
(NEGF) in the Keldysh formalism. In addition, we describe the low-energy
excitations using an effective Dirac equation in curved space with a
strain-induced pseudo-magnetic field which can be solved analytically for the
torus geometry in terms of the Mathieu functions. We obtain a perfect
quantitative agreement with the NEGF results. For nanotubes with an armchair
edge, already a weak bending of 1% substantially changes the electronic
properties. Depending on the valley, the current of the zero mode flows either
on the outer or the inner side of the torus and, therefore, can be used as a
valley splitter. In contrast, the zizgzag nanotubes are largely unaffected by
the bending. This has important consequences for nanoelectronic applications of
carbon nanotubes and opens new possibilities for valleytronics.

<h3>Overview of phase-field models for fatigue fracture using a unified  framework</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01396" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01396</a>
<br>
<i>Martha Kalina, Tom Schneider, Jörg Brummund, Markus Kästner</i>
<br>
<br>
In the last ten years, the phase-field method has gained much attention as a
novel method to simulate fracture due to its straightforward way allowing to
cover crack initiation and propagation without additional conditions. More
recently, it has also been applied to fatigue fracture due to cyclic loading.
This publication gives an overview of the main phase-field fatigue models
published to date. We present all models in a unified variational framework for
best comparability. Subsequently, the models are compared regarding their most
important features. It becomes apparent that they can be classified in mainly
two categories according to the way fatigue is implemented in the model - that
is as a gradual degradation of the fracture toughness or with an additional
term in the crack driving force. We aim to provide a helpful guide for choosing
the appropriate model for different applications and for developing existing
models further.

<h3>Dynamical control of topology in ferroelectric skyrmions via twisted  light</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01402" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01402</a>
<br>
<i>Lingyuan Gao, Sergei Prokhorenko, Yousra Nahas, Laurent Bellaiche</i>
<br>
<br>
Twisted light carries a non-zero orbital angular momentum, that can be
transferred from light to electrons and particles ranging from nanometers to
micrometers. Up to now, the interplay between twisted light with dipolar
systems has scarcely been explored, though the latter bear abundant forms of
topologies such as skyrmions and embrace strong light-matter coupling. Here,
using first-principles-based simulations, we show that twisted light can excite
and drive dynamical polar skyrmions and transfer its nonzero winding number to
ferroelectric ultrathin films. The skyrmion is successively created and
annihilated alternately at the two interfaces, and experiences a periodic
transition from a markedly "Bloch" to "Neel" character, accompanied with the
emergence of a "Bloch point" topological defect with vanishing polarization.
The dynamical evolution of skyrmions is connected to a constant jump of
topological number between "0" and "1" over time. These intriguing phenomena
are found to have an electrostatic origin. Our study thus demonstrates that,
and explains why, this unique light-matter interaction can be very powerful in
creating and manipulating topological solitons in functional materials.

<h3>Probing Near-Field Thermal Emission of Localized Surface Phonons from  Silicon Carbide Nanopillars</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01419" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01419</a>
<br>
<i>Saman Zare, Ramin Pouria, Philippe K. Chow, Tom Tiwald, Carl P. Tripp, Sheila Edalatpour</i>
<br>
<br>
Thermal emission of localized surface phonons (LSPhs) from nanostructures of
polaritonic materials is a promising mechanism for tuning the spectrum of
near-field thermal radiation. Previous studies have theoretically shown that
thermal emission of LSPhs results in narrow-band peaks in the near-field
spectra, whose spectral locations can be modulated by changing the dimensions
of the nanostructure. However, near-field thermal emission of LSPhs has not
been experimentally explored yet. In this study, we measure the spectrum of
near-field thermal radiation from arrays of 6H-silicon carbide (6H-SiC)
nanopillars using an internal-reflection-element based spectroscopy technique.
We present an experimental demonstration of thermal emission of the transverse
dipole, quadrupole, and octupole, as well as longitudinal monopole from 6H-SiC
nanopillars at a near-field distance from the array. We show that the spectral
location of the longitudinal monopole and transverse dipole are significantly
affected by the near-field coupling between neighboring nanopillars as well as
the intercoupling of the nanopillars and the substrate. We also experimentally
demonstrate that the spectrum of near-field thermal radiation from 6H-SiC
nanopillar arrays can be tuned by varying the dimensions of the nanopillars,
providing an opportunity for designing emitters with tailored near-field
thermal radiation.

<h3>Approach to Hyperuniformity in a Metallic Glass-Forming Material  Exhibiting a Fragile to Strong Glass Transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01429" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01429</a>
<br>
<i>Hao Zhang, Xinyi Wang, Jiarui Zhang, Hai-Bin Yu, Jack F. Douglas</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate a metallic glass-forming (GF) material (Al90Sm10) exhibiting a
fragile-strong (FS) glass-formation by molecular dynamics simulation to better
understand this highly distinctive pattern of glass-formation in which many of
the usual phenomenological relations describing relaxation times and diffusion
of OGF liquids no longer apply, and where instead genuine thermodynamic
features are observed in response functions and little thermodynamic signature
is exhibited at the glass transition temperature, Tg. Given the many unexpected
similarities between the thermodynamics and dynamics of this metallic GF
material with water, we first focus on the anomalous static scattering in this
liquid, following recent studies on water, silicon and other FS GF liquids. In
particular, we quantify the 'hyperuniformity index' H of our liquid which
provides a quantitative measure of molecular 'jamming'. To gain insight into
the T-dependence and magnitude of H, we also estimated another more familiar
measure of particle localization, the Debye-Waller parameter $<u^2>$ describing
the mean-square particle displacement on a timescale on the order of the fast
relaxation time, and we also calculate H and $<u^2>$ for heated crystalline Cu.
This comparative analysis between H and $<u^2>$ for crystalline and metallic
glass materials allows us to understand the critical value of H on the order of
$10^{-3}$ as being analogous to the Lindemann criterion for both the melting of
crystals and the 'softening' of glasses. We further interpret the emergence of
FS GF and liquid-liquid phase separation in this class of liquids to arise from
a cooperative assembly process in the GF liquid.

<h3>Thermodynamic quantities of two-dimensional Ising models obtained by  noisy mean field annealing and coherent Ising machine</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01454" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01454</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Noisy mean field annealing (NMFA) is an algorithm that mimics a coherent
Ising machine (CIM), which is an optical system for solving Ising problems. The
NMFA has reproduced the solver performance of the CIM for systems of limited
size even though it simplifies the interaction between spins with a mean-field
approximation. However, recent experiments observing various thermodynamic
quantities have revealed that the CIM can capture the phase transitions of the
two-dimensional Ising models that the mean field cannot capture. This situation
leads to a fundamental question as to how well the NMFA can capture the
features of the thermodynamic quantities around the phase transition. This
paper answers that the NMFA reproduces the thermodynamic features of the mean
field, but cannot reproduce the CIM results. This suggests that, in terms of
sampling, the level of performance of the CIM is beyond that of the NMFA.

<h3>Spin waves in a ferromagnetic topological metal</h3>

<br>
<br>
In most metals, charges and spins can hop rapidly between atoms, yielding
strong dispersion of their energy versus momentum. There are, however, special
arrangements of atoms, such as twisted graphene bilayers or lattices which
resemble woven bamboo "kagome" mats, so that particle motion with strong
hopping between neighbours becomes nearly or even completely dispersionless.
Such flat bands are interesting because the interactions between the heavy
particles inhabiting them will become much more important than for strong
dispersion, resulting in novel quantum solid and liquid states, particularly
when topology enters on account of significant spin-orbit coupling for the
underlying electrons. Nonetheless, spectroscopic evidence for flat bands
engendered by lattice geometry rather than weak hopping is rare, particularly
for metallic single crystals. Here we report the discovery, using circularly
polarized X-Rays in resonant absorption and inelastic scattering (RIXS) for the
unambiguous isolation of magnetic signals, of a flat spin wave band and large
orbital moment for the metallic kagome ferromagnet Fe$_3$Sn$_2$, which has a
topologically non-trivial electronic band structure controllable by modest
external magnetic fields. The flat mode energy is consistent with the high
Curie temperature ($T_C$ ~ 640 K) as well as the strong acoustic mode
dispersion, implying, together with the substantial spin-orbit coupling
indicated by the large orbital moment, that the mode is topological. The
measured properties of the spin waves are highly unconventional, and include
very severe damping as well as the flat mode amplitude which is maximized in
the long wavelength limit where it is ordinarily expected to vanish. Our
results open the topic of interactions of topological bosons (spin waves) and
fermions (electrons) with the very specific target of explaining boson
lifetimes and amplitudes.

<h3>Unsupervised learning of representative local atomic arrangements in  molecular dynamics data</h3>

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations present a data-mining challenge, given
that they can generate a considerable amount of data but often rely on limited
or biased human interpretation to examine their information content. By not
asking the right questions of MD data we may miss critical information hidden
within it. We combine dimensionality reduction (UMAP) and unsupervised
hierarchical clustering (HDBSCAN) to quantitatively characterize the
coordination environment of chemical species within MD data. By focusing on
local coordination, we significantly reduce the amount of data to be analyzed
by extracting all distinct molecular formulas within a given coordination
sphere. We then efficiently combine UMAP and HDBSCAN with alignment or
shape-matching algorithms to classify these formulas into distinct structural
isomer families. The outcome is a quantitative mapping of the multiple
coordination environments present in the MD data. The method was employed to
reveal details of cation coordination in electrolytes based on molecular
liquids.

<h3>Effect of iron thicknesses on spin transport in a Fe/Au bilayer system</h3>

This paper is concerned with a theoretical analysis of the behavior of
optically excited spin currents in bilayer and multilayer systems of
ferromagnetic and normal metals. As the propagation, control and manipulation
of the spin currents created in ferromagnets by femtosecond optical pulses is
of particular interest, we examine the influence of different thicknesses of
the constituent layers for the case of electrons excited several electronvolts
above the Fermi level. Using a Monte-Carlo simulation framework for such highly
excited electrons, we first examine the spatio-temporal characteristics of the
spin current density driven in a Fe layer, where the absorption profile of the
light pulses plays an important role. Further, we examine how the combination
of light absorption profiles, spin-dependent transmission probabilities, and
iron layer thicknesses affect spin current density in a Fe/Au bilayer system.
For high-energy electrons studied here, the interface and secondary electron
generation have a small influence on spin transport in the bilayer system.
However, we find that spin injection from one layer to another is most
effective within a certain range of iron layer thicknesses.

<h3>Transport and noise of hot electrons in GaAs using a semi-analytical  model of two-phonon polar optical phonon scattering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01480" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01480</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Recent ab-initio studies of electron transport in GaAs have reported that
electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions beyond the lowest order play a fundamental
role in charge transport and noise phenomena. Inclusion of the
next-leading-order process in which an electron scatters with two phonons was
found to yield good agreement for the high-field drift velocity, but the
characteristic non-monotonic trend of the power spectral density of current
fluctuations (PSD) with electric field was not predicted. The high
computational cost of the ab-initio approach necessitated various
approximations to the two-phonon scattering term, which were suggested as
possible origins of the discrepancy. Here, we report a semi-analytical
transport model of two-phonon electron scattering via the Fr\"ohlich mechanism,
allowing a number of the approximations in the ab-initio treatment to be lifted
while retaining the accuracy to within a few percent. We compare the calculated
and experimental transport and noise properties as well as scattering rates
measured by photoluminescence experiments. We find quantitative agreement
within 15% for the drift velocity and 25% for the $\Gamma$ valley scattering
rates, and agreement with the $\Gamma-L$ intervalley scattering rates within a
factor of two. Considering these results and prior studies of current noise in
GaAs, we conclude that the most probable origin of the non-monotonic PSD trend
versus electric field is the formation of space charge domains rather than
intervalley scattering as has been assumed.

<h3>Collective terahertz fluctuation modes in a polariton laser</h3>

A polariton Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state in a semiconductor
microcavity is an example of symmetry-broken states in open systems.
Fluctuations of the order parameter are an important tool to characterize such
a state. With the condensate formed by composite particles, the set of
zero-momentum fluctuations spans an infinite-dimensional electron-hole mode
subspace. We show that collective fluctuation modes with orbital angular
momentum different from that of the order parameter can be obtained with
terahertz radiation, and that a physical manifestation of such modes, which are
not Higgs modes, can be terahertz gain.

Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) provide a contactless method for measuring the
wavevector-dependent conductivity. This technique has been used to discover
emergent length scales in the fractional quantum Hall regime of traditional,
semiconductor-based heterostructures. SAWs would appear to be an ideal match
for van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, but the right combination of
substrate and experimental geometry to allow access to the quantum transport
regime has not yet been found. We demonstrate that SAW resonant cavities
fabricated on LiNbO$_3$ substrates can be used to access the quantum Hall
regime of high-mobility, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulated graphene
heterostructures. Our work establishes SAW resonant cavities as a viable
platform for performing contactless conductivity measurements in the quantum
transport regime of vdW materials.

<h3>Observation of flat-band localization and topological edge states  induced by effective strong interactions in electrical circuit networks</h3>

Flat-band topologies and localizations in non-interacting systems are
extensively studied in different quantum and classical-wave systems. Recently,
the exploration on the novel physics of flat-band localizations and topologies
in interacting systems has aroused great interest. In particular, it is
theoretically shown that the strong-interaction could drive the formation of
nontrivial topological flat bands, even dispersive trivial bands dominate the
single-particle counterparts. However, the experimental observation of those
interesting phenomena is still lacking. Here, we experimentally simulate the
interaction-induced flat-band localizations and topological edge states in
electrical circuit networks. We directly map the eigenstates of two correlated
bosons in one-dimensional Aharonov Bohm cages to modes of two-dimensional
circuit lattices.In this case, the two-boson flat-bands and topological edge
states are detected by measuring frequency-dependent impedance responses and
voltage dynamics in the time domain. Our finding suggests a flexible platform
to simulate the interaction-induced flat-band topology, and may possess
potential applications in designing novel electronic devices.

<h3>Interface-tuning of ferroelectricity and quadruple-well state in  CuInP$_2$S$_6$ via ferroelectric oxide</h3>

Ferroelectric van der Waals CuInP$_2$S$_6$ possesses intriguing
quadruple-well states and negative piezoelectricity. Its technological
implementation has been impeded by the relatively low Curie temperature (bulk
$T_C$ ~42 {\deg}C) and the lack of precise domain control. Here we show that
CuInP$_2$S$_6$ can be immune to the finite size effect and exhibits enhanced
ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, and polar alignment in the ultrathin limit
when interfaced with ferroelectric oxide PbZr$_{0.2}$Ti$_{0.8}$O$_3$ films.
Piezoresponse force microscopy studies reveal that the polar domains in thin
CuInP$_2$S$_6$ fully conform to those of underlying
PbZr$_{0.2}$Ti$_{0.8}$O$_3$, where the piezoelectric coefficient changes sign
and increases sharply with reducing thickness. The $T_C$ of 13 nm
CuInP$_2$S$_6$ on PbZr$_{0.2}$Ti$_{0.8}$O$_3$ exceeds 200 {\deg}C. Density
functional theory modeling and Monte Carlo simulations show that the enhanced
polar alignment and $T_C$ can be attributed to interface-mediated structure
distortion in CuInP$_2$S$_6$. Our study provides a new material strategy to
engineer the polar properties of CuInP$_2$S$_6$ for flexible nanoelectronic,
optoelectronic, and mechanical applications.

Nanopore membranes are a versatile platform for a wide range of applications
ranging from medical sensing to filtration and clean energy generation. To
attain high-flux rectifying ionic flow it is required to produce short channels
exhibiting asymmetric surface charge distributions. This work reports on a
system of track etched conical nanopores in amorphous SiO$_2$ membranes,
fabricated using the scalable track etch technique. Pores are fabricated by
irradiation of 1 $\mu$m thick SiO$_2$ windows with 2.2 GeV $^{197}$Au ions, and
subsequent chemical etching. Structural characterisation is carried out using
atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), small angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS), ellipsometry and surface profiling. Conductometric
characterisation of the pore surface is performed using a membrane containing
16 pores, including an in depth analysis of ionic transport characteristics.
The pores have a tip radius of (15.7 $\pm$ 1.0) nm, a half-cone angle of (12.6
$\pm$ 0.1)$^{\circ}$, and a length of (710 $\pm$ 5) nm. The $pK_a$, $pK_b$ and
$pI$ are determined to 7.4 $\pm$ 0.1, 1.6 $\pm$ 0.1 and 4.5 $\pm$ 0.1
respectively, enabling the fine tuning of the surface charge density between
+100 to -300 mC $m^{-2}$, and allows achieving an ionic current rectification
ratio of up to 10. This highly versatile technology addresses challenges that
contemporary nanopore systems face, and offers a platform to improve the
performance of existing applications.

Phase field method has been widely used because of its excellent ability to
simulate fracture problems. At present, the implementation process is mainly
based on commercial software, and the operation process is relatively complex.
In this paper, 2D and 3D phase field models are implemented in the open-source
finite element software package AsFem. Compared with commercial software, it is
simpler to realize phase field fracture model in AsFem. At the same time, a
robust staggered scheme and an efficient monolithic scheme can be used to solve
the displacement field and phase field sub-problem, and the transformation
process is very easy. Several examples are tested to demonstrate the
performance of the current implementation. The simulation results are in good
agreement with the previous work, which shows the feasibility and effectiveness
of implementing the phase field method in AsFem. In the future, more complex
multi-field coupled phase field fracture problems can be solved with AsFem.

The direct integration of GaN with Si can boost great potential for low-cost,
large-scale, and high-power device applications. However, it is still
challengeable to directly grow GaN on Si without using thick strain relief
buffer layers due to their large lattice and thermal-expansion-coefficient
mismatches. In this work, a GaN/Si heterointerface without any buffer layer is
successfully fabricated at room temperature via surface activated bonding
(SAB). The residual stress states and interfacial microstructures of GaN/Si
heterostructures were systematically investigated through micro-Raman
spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Compared to the large
compressive stress that existed in GaN layers grown-on-Si by MOCVD, a
significantly relaxed and uniform small tensile stress was observed in GaN
layers bonded-to-Si by SAB; this is mainly ascribed to the amorphous layer
formed at the bonding interface. In addition, the interfacial microstructure
and stress states of bonded GaN/Si heterointerfaces was found can be
significantly tuned by appropriate thermal annealing. This work moves an
important step forward directly integrating GaN to the present Si CMOS
technology with high quality thin interfaces, and brings great promises for
wafer-scale low-cost fabrication of GaN electronics.

Ca$_2$FeMnO$_6$ (CFMO) double perovskite was studied using first principles
density functional theory and tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonian modeling using
extended Hubbard model. We have shown by electronic structure analysis that
charge- and magnetic-ordering are driven by charge disproportionation at low
temperature caused by partial localization of O-$2p$ ligand holes at alternate
Fe sites that creates Jahn-Teller distortion, which leads to metal to insulator
transition (MIT) in CFMO. Our results suggests MIT was triggered by negative
charge-transfer energy of self-hole doping, responsible for symmetry lowering
transitions. Notably, the band-gap was found to fundamentally controlled by the
strength of the charge-transfer energy, and not by the Mott-Hubbard
interactions, which can be modeled by composition, pressure or stoichiometry
modulations. The fundamental insights presented in this work will help
understand similar physics and mechanisms in other class of perovskites and
correlated metals.

The coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism has been a
long-standing issue in the realm of unconventional superconductivity due to the
antagonistic nature of these two ordered states. Experimentally identifying and
characterizing new fascinating heterointerface superconductors that coexist
with magnetism are challenging. Here, we report the experimental observation of
long-range ferromagnetic order at the verge of two-dimensional
superconductivity at the KTaO$_3$ heterointerfaces. Remarkably, the fingerprint
of ferromagnetism is the existence of in-plane magnetization hysteresis loop
persisting up to room temperature observed in direct current superconducting
quantum interference device measurements. Furthermore, first-principles
calculations suggest that the robust ferromagnetism is attributed to the
presence of oxygen vacancies that localize electrons in nearby Ta 5$d$ states.
Our findings not only unveil the KTaO$_3$ heterointerfaces to be unconventional
superconductors with time-reversal symmetry breaking, but also inject a new
momentum to the study of a delicate interplay of superconductivity and
magnetism boosted by the strong spin-orbit coupling inherent to the heavy Ta in
5$d$ orbitals of KTaO$_3$ heterointerfaces.

Hybrid lead halide perovskites (LHPs) are a class of semiconductor with novel
properties that are distinctively governed by structural fluctuations.
Diffraction experiments sensitive to average, long-range order reveal a cubic
structure in the device-relevant, high-temperature phase. Local probes find
additional short-range order with lower symmetry that may govern the
structure-function relationships of LHPs. However, the dimensionality,
participating atoms, and dynamics of this short-range order are unresolved,
impeding our understanding of technologically relevant properties including
long carrier lifetimes and facile halide migration. Here, we determine the true
structure of two prototypical hybrid LHPs, CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ and
CH$_3$NH$_3$PbBr$_3$, using a combination of single-crystal X-ray and neutron
diffuse scattering, neutron inelastic spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics
simulations. The remarkable collective dynamics we found are not suggested by
previous studies and consist of a network of local two-dimensional, circular
pancake-like regions of dynamically tilting lead halide octahedra (lower
symmetry) that induce longer range intermolecular correlations within the
CH$_3$NH$_3^+$ sublattice. The dynamic local structure can introduce transient
ferroelectric or antiferroelectric domains that increase charge carrier
lifetimes, and strongly affect the halide migration, a poorly understood
degradation mechanism. Our approach of co-analyzing single-crystal X-ray and
neutron diffuse scattering data with MD simulations will provide unparalleled
insights into the structure of hybrid materials and materials with engineered
disorder.

<h3>Topological properties of a periodically driven Cruetz ladder</h3>

<br>
<br>
We have investigated a periodically driven Cruetz ladder in presence of two
different driving protocols, namely, a sinusoidal drive and a $\delta$-kick
imparted to the ladder at regular intervals of time. Specifically, we have
studied the topological properties corresponding to the trivial and the
non-trivial limits of the static (undriven) case via computing suitable
topological invariants. Corresponding to the case where the chiral symmetry is
intact, in addition to the zero energy modes, $\pi$ energy modes appear in both
these cases. Further, two different frequency regimes of the driving protocol
emerge, where Floquet-Magnus expansion is particularly employed to study the
high frequency regime for the sinusoidal drive. Apart from the physics being
identical in the high frequency and the static scenarios, the zero energy modes
show distinctive features at low and high frequencies. For the sinusoidal
drive, there exists a sharp frequency threshold beyond which the zero energy
mode only exists in the topological limit, while in the trivial limit, it
exists only upto the threshold frequency. In presence of the $\delta$-kick, the
Cruetz ladder demonstrates higher values of the topological invariant, and as a
consequence the system possesses large number of edge modes.

<h3>Realization of a Hopf insulator in circuit systems</h3>

Three-dimensional (3D) two-band Hopf insulators are a paradigmatic example of
topological phases beyond the topological classifications based on powerful
methods like $K$-theory and symmetry indicators.Since this class of topological
insulating phases was theoretically proposed in 2008, they have attracted
significant interest owing to their conceptual novelty, connection to knot
theory, and many fascinating physical properties. However, because their
realization requires special forms of long-range spin-orbit coupling (SOC),
they have not been achieved in any 3D system yet. Here we report the first
experimental realization of the long-sought-after Hopf insulator in a 3D
circuit system. To implement the Hopf insulator, we construct basic pseudo-spin
modules and connection modules that can realize $2\times2$-matrix elements and
then design the circuit network according to a tight-binding Hopf insulator
Hamiltonian constructed by the Hopf map. By simulating the band structure of
the designed circuit network and calculating the Hopf invariant, we find that
the circuit realizes a Hopf insulator with Hopf invariant equaling $4$.
Experimentally, we measure the band structure of a printed circuit board and
find the observed properties of the bulk bands and topological surface states
(TSS) are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions, verifying the
bulk-boundary correspondence of the Hopf insulator. Our scheme brings the
experimental study of Hopf insulators to reality and opens the door to the
implementation of more unexplored topological phases beyond the known
topological classifications.

We address the fabrication of nano-architectures by impacting thin layers of
amorphous Ge deposited on SiO$_{2}$ with a Ga$^{+}$ ion beam and investigate
the structural and optical properties of the resulting patterns. By adjusting
beam current and scanning parameters, different classes of nano-architectures
can be formed, from elongated and periodic structures to disordered ones with a
footprint of a few tens of nm. The latter disordered case features a
significant suppression of large length scale fluctuations that are
conventionally observed in ordered systems and exhibits a nearly hyperuniform
character, as shown by the analysis of the spectral density at small wave
vectors. It deviates from conventional random fields as accounted for by the
analysis of Minkowski functionals. A proof of concept for potential
applications is given by showing peculiar reflection properties of the
resulting nano-structured films that exhibit colorization and enhanced light
absorption with respect to the flat Ge layer counterpart (up to one order of
magnitude at some wavelength). This fabrication method for disordered
hyperuniform structures does not depend on the beam size. Being ion beam
technology widely adopted in semiconductor foundries over 200 mm wafers, our
work provides a viable pathway for obtaining disordered, nearly-hyperuniform
materials by self-assembly with a footprint of tens of nanometers for
electronic and photonic devices, energy storage and sensing.

<h3>Theory of nematic charge orders in kagome metals</h3>

<br>
<br>
Kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$K, Rb, Cs) exhibit an exotic charge order
(CO), involving three order parameters, with broken translation and
time-reversal symmetries compatible with the presence of orbital currents.
Despite the tremendous experimental and theoretical efforts that have been
invested into the characterization of this phase, its properties are still
intensely debated, and it is unclear if the origin of the CO is mainly due to
electron-electron or electron-phonon interactions. One of the few indications
that are confirmed by the majority of experimental studies is the nematicity of
this state, a feature that might be enhanced by electronic correlations
irrespective of the nature of the primary instability. However, it is still
unclear whether the nematic CO becomes stable at a temperature equal to
($T_\text{nem} = T_\text{C}$) or lower than ($T_\text{nem} < T_\text{C}$) the
one of the CO itself. Here, we systematically characterize several CO
configurations, some proposed for the new member of the family ScV$_6$Sn$_6$,
by combining phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theories, valid irrespective of
the specific ordering mechanism, with mean-field analysis. We find a few
configurations for the CO that are in agreement with most of the experimental
findings to date and that are described by different Ginzburg-Landau
potentials. Moreover, we propose to use resonant ultrasound spectroscopy to
experimentally characterize the properties of the order parameters of the CO,
such as the number of their components and their relative amplitude, and
provide an analysis of the corresponding elastic tensors. This might help
understand which mean-field configuration found in our study is the most
representative for describing the CO state of kagome metals, and it can provide
information regarding the nematicity onset temperature $T_\text{nem}$ with
respect to $T_\text{C}$.

We report an experimental setup for simultaneously measuring specific heat
and thermal conductivity in feedback-controlled pulsed magnetic fields of 50
msec duration at cryogenic temperatures. A stabilized magnetic field pulse
obtained by the feedback control, which dramatically improves the thermal
stability of the setup and sample, is used in combination with the flash method
to obtain absolute values of thermal properties up to 37.2 T in the 2 K to 16 K
temperature range. We describe the experimental setup and demonstrate the
performance of the present method with measurements on single crystal samples
of the geometrically frustrated quantum spin-dimer system SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$.
Our proof-of-principle results show excellent agreement with data taken using a
standard steady-state method, confirming the validity and convenience of the
present approach.

<br>
<br>
Under certain experimental conditions, the deposition of C60 molecules onto
an atomically flat copper surface gives rise to the formation of corrugated
islands. This corrugation, which reflects a molecular displacement
perpendicular to the surface plane, presents an astonishing pattern: it is well
described by a frustrated Ising spin Hamiltonian whose thermodynamics is
compatible with a spin liquid about to transit towards an ordered zigzag state.
Here we study the statistical properties of such a molecular corrugation using
tools generally employed in frustrated magnetism. More specifically, the real
and reciprocal space analysis of pairwise molecule correlations allows us to
demonstrate that the C60/Cu system, in which magnetism is totally absent, has
all the characteristics of a triangular Ising antiferromagnet. Our results
indicate that the organization of two-dimensional matter, at the molecular
length scale, sometimes turns out to be particularly close to that encountered
in highly frustrated magnets.

<h3>Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions Following Double Quenches:  Persistence of the Initial State vs Dynamical Phases</h3>

<br>
<br>
Dynamical quantum phase transitions can occur following quenches in quantum
systems when the rate function, a dynamical analogue of the free energy,
becomes non-analytic at critical times. Here we exhaustively investigate in an
exemplary model how the dynamically evolving state responds to a second quench.
We demonstrate that for quenches where the initial and final Hamiltonian belong
to different phases always result in dynamical quantum phase transitions,
irrespective of the intermediate quench and dynamics or the time of the second
quench. However, if the initial and final Hamiltonian belong to the same
equilibrium phase then the intermediate Hamiltonian must belong to a different
phase. In this case, the second quench time in relation to the critical times
of the first quench becomes crucial to the existence of dynamical quantum phase
transitions.

Resonance Raman scattering, a very effective and sensitive technique for
atomically thin semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide, can be used to
observe the phonons from the entire Brillouin zone. In addition to the
significance of resonance effect on the Raman spectrum it may also be used to
probe the electron-phonon coupling. Our study is devoted to understand the
phonons in layered MoS2, especially for very low frequency range (i.e. below
100 cm-1), as a function of temperature under the resonance effect.
Understanding the phonon-phonon and electron-phonon coupling and the effects of
temperature on the Raman spectrum are the central points of the present study.
We observe the anomalous softening and broadening of a very low frequency
phonon mode P3 (~34 cm-1) at low temperature ( i.e below 150 K). We attributed
the observed anomalous trend in frequency and linewidth of this low frequency
phonon to the electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, our work also highlights
the temperature induced tuning of resonance condition via understanding the
intensity of phonon modes as a function of temperature.

Moir\'e physics plays an important role for the characterization of
functional materials and the engineering of physical properties in general,
ranging from strain-driven transport phenomena to superconductivity. Here, we
report the observation of moir\'e fringes in conductive atomic force microscopy
(cAFM) scans gained on the model ferroelectric Er(Mn,Ti)O$_3$. By performing a
systematic study of the impact of key experimental parameters on the emergent
moir\'e fringes, such as scan angle and pixel density, we demonstrate that the
observed fringes arise due to a superposition of the applied raster scanning
and sample-intrinsic properties, classifying the measured modulation in
conductance as a scanning moir\'e effect. Our findings are important for the
investigation of local transport phenomena in moir\'e engineered materials by
cAFM, providing a general guideline for distinguishing extrinsic from intrinsic
moir\'e effects. Furthermore, the experiments provide a possible pathway for
enhancing the sensitivity, pushing the resolution limit of local transport
measurements by probing conductance variations at the spatial resolution limit
via more long-ranged moir\'e patterns.

Magnetic topological insulators (MTI) constitute a novel class of materials
where the topologically protected band structure coexists with long-range
ferromagnetic order, which can lead to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry
(TRS), introducing a bandgap in the Dirac cone-shaped topological surface state
(TSS). The gap opening in MITs has been predicted to be accompanied by a
distortion in the TSS, evolving its warped shape from hexagonal to trigonal. In
this work, we demonstrate such a transition by means of angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy after the deposition of low concentrations of
magnetic rare earths, namely Er and Dy, on the ternary three-dimensional
prototypical topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_2$Te. Signatures of the gap
opening occurring as a consequence of the TRS breaking have also been observed,
whose existence is supported by the observation of the aforementioned
transition. Moreover, increasing the Er coverage results in a tunable p-type
doping of the TSS. As a consequence, the Fermi level (E$_{\textrm{F}}$) of our
Bi$_2$Se$_2$Te crystals can be gradually tuned towards the TSS Dirac point, and
therefore to the magnetically induced bandgap; thus fulfilling two of the
necessary prerequisites for the realization of the quantum anomalous Hall
effect (QAHE) in this system. The experimental results are rationalized by a
theoretical model where a magnetic Zeeman out-of-plane term is introduced in
the hamiltonian governing the TSS band dispersion. Our results offer new
strategies to control magnetic interactions with TSSs based on a simple
approach and open up viable routes for the realization of the QAHE.

The coupling energies between the buckled dimers of the Si(001) surface were
determined through analysis of the anisotropic critical behavior of its
order-disorder phase transition. Spot profiles in high-resolution low-energy
electron diffraction as a function of temperature were analyzed within the
framework of the anisotropic two-dimensional Ising model. The validity of this
approach is justified by the large ratio of correlation lengths,
$\xi_\parallel^+/\xi_\perp^+ = 5.2$ of the fluctuating $c(4 {\times} 2)$
domains above the critical temperature $T_\mathrm{c} = (190.6 \pm 10)$ K. We
obtain effective couplings $J_\parallel = (-24.9 \pm 1.3)$ meV along the dimer
rows and $J_\perp = (-0.8 \pm 0.1)$ meV across the dimer rows, i.e.,
antiferromagnetic-like coupling of the dimers with $c(4 {\times} 2)$ symmetry.

Time-resolved, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES) is a
one-particle spectroscopic technique that can probe excitons (two-particle
excitations) in momentum space. We present an ab initio, time-domain GW
approach to TR-ARPES and apply it to monolayer MoS$_2$. We show that
photoexcited excitons may be measured and quantified as satellite bands, as
well as leading to the renormalization of the quasiparticle bands. These
features are explained in terms of an exciton- Floquet phenomenon induced by an
exciton time-dependent bosonic field, which is orders of magnitude stronger
than laser field induced Floquet bands in low-dimensional semiconductors. Our
findings open a door to understanding the behavior of optical-field driven
materials.

We investigate the superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) in disordered
quasi-one dimensional systems using the density-matrix renormalization group
method. Focusing on the case of an interacting spinful Hamiltonian at
quarter-filling, we contrast the differences arising in the SIT when the parent
non-interacting model features either flat or dispersive bands. Furthermore, by
comparing disorder distributions that preserve or not SU(2)-symmetry, we unveil
the critical disorder amplitude that triggers insulating behavior. While
scaling analysis suggests the transition to be of a
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type for all models (two lattices and two
disorder types), only in the flat-band model with Zeeman-like disorder the
critical disorder is nonvanishing. In this sense, the flat-band structure does
strengthen superconductivity. For both flat and dispersive band models, i) in
the presence of SU(2)-symmetric random chemical potentials, the
disorder-induced transition is from superconductor to insulator of singlet
pairs; ii) for the Zeeman-type disorder, the transition is from superconductor
to insulator of unpaired fermions. In all cases, our numerical results suggest
no intermediate disorder-driven metallic phase.

We calculate electronic charge and heat transport in tubular nanowires
generated by a temperature gradient or a chemical potential bias. These
nanowires correspond to semiconductor core-shell nanowires with insulating
(undoped) core and conductive (doped) shell, such that the conduction takes
place only in the shell. The cross section of such nanowires is typically
polygonal. We study the influence of the cross section shape and shell
thickness on the electric and heat conduction of the shell. We use the
Landauer-B\"uttiker approach to calculate the electric and heat currents as a
non-linear function of temperature and chemical potential bias beyond the
linear regime.

128, 053401 (2022)] in a quasi-one-dimensional two-component quantum gas in the
case where the component immersed into the Bose-Einstein condensate has a
finite intraspecies interaction strength. As a result of the matter-wave
backaction, the fermionization in the limit of infinite intraspecies repulsion
occurs via a first-order phase transition to the self-pinned state, which is in
contrast to the asymptotic behavior in static trapping potentials. The system
also exhibits an additional superfluid state for the immersed component if the
interspecies interaction is able to overcome the intraspecies repulsion. We
present an analytical model that includes the superfluid state and derive an
approximation to the transition line in the phase diagram. The full phase
diagram of the system is mapped out numerically for the case of N=2 and N=3
atoms in the immersed component.

material research and integrating chiral molecules into MOFs promises devices
with unprecedented functionality. However, considering the nearly unlimited
degrees of freedom concerning the choice of materials and the geometrical
details of the possibly structured films, we urgently need to complement
advanced experimental methods with equally strong modeling techniques. Most
notably, these modeling techniques must cope with the challenge that the
material and devices thereof cover size scales from {\AA}ngstr\"oms to mm. In
response to that need, we outline a computational workflow that seamlessly
combines quantum chemical methods to capture the properties of individual
molecules with optical simulations to capture the properties of functional
devices made from these molecular materials. We concentrate on chiral
properties and apply our work to UiO-67-BINOL MOFs, for which experimental
results are available to benchmark the results of our simulations and explore
the optical properties of cavities and metasurfaces made from that chiral
material.

The quantum phase transition between the low-field fracton phase with type-II
fracton excitations and the high-field polarized phase is investigated in the
two-dimensional self-dual quantum Newman-Moore model. We apply perturbative and
numerical linked-cluster expansions to calculate the ground-state energy per
site in the thermodynamic limit revealing a level crossing at the self-dual
point. In addition, high-order series expansions of the relevant low-energy
gaps are determined using perturbative continuous unitary transformations
indicating no gap-closing. Our results therefore predict a first-order phase
transition between the low-field fracton and the high-field polarized phase at
the self-dual point.

At zero temperature, a Galilean-invariant Bose fluid is expected to be fully
superfluid. Here we investigate theoretically and experimentally the quenching
of the superfluid density of a dilute Bose-Einstein condensate due to the
breaking of translational (and thus Galilean) invariance by an external 1D
periodic potential. Both Leggett's bound fixed by the knowledge of the total
density and the anisotropy of the sound velocity provide a consistent
determination of the superfluid fraction. The use of a large-period lattice
emphasizes the important role of two-body interactions on superfluidity.

The vexing error of excess variance in the sizing of single particles
degrades accuracy in applications ranging from quality control of nanoparticle
products to hazard assessment of nanoplastic byproducts. The particular
importance of lipid nanoparticles for vaccine and medicine delivery motivates
this comment on a publication$^{\textrm{1}}$ in ACS Nano. In Reference 1, the
benchmark measurements of a nanoparticle standard manifest large errors of the
size distribution that contradict the claim of validation. Such errors can bias
the correlation of fluorescence intensity as an optical proxy for the molecular
loading of lipid nanoparticles and give misleading insights from power-law
models of intensity$-$size data. Looking forward, measurement error models have
the potential to address this widespread issue.

The signature of quantum phase transition is generally wiped out at finite
temperature. A few quantities that has been observed to carry this signature
through a non-analytic behavior are also limited to low temperatures only.
However, we have recently constructed a function from the quantum fidelity
which has the potential to bear a non-analytic signature at the quantum
critical point beyond low temperature regime. We demonstrate the behavior of
the corresponding rate function and the robustness of the non-analyticity over
a number of many-body Hamiltonians in different dimensions. We have also shown
that our rate function reduces to that used in the demonstration of the
dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) at zero temperature. It has been
further observed that, unlike DQPT, the long time limit of the rate function
can faithfully detect the equilibrium quantum phase transition as well.

<h3>Theory of intermediate twinning and spontaneous polarization in the  phase transformations of ferroelectric potassium sodium niobate</h3>

Potassium sodium niobate is considered a prominent material system as a
substitute for toxic lead-containing ferroelectric materials. It exhibits
first-order phase transformations and ferroelectricity with potential
applications ranging from energy conversion to innovative cooling technologies,
hereby addressing urgent societal challenges. However, a major obstacle in the
application of potassium sodium niobate is its multi-scale heterogeneity and
the lack of understanding of its phase transition pathway and microstructure.
This can be seen from the findings of Pop-Ghe 2021 et al. [1] which also reveal
the occurrence of intermediate twinning during the phase transition. Here we
show that intermediate twinning is a consequence of energy minimization. We
employ a geometrically nonlinear electroelastic energy function for potassium
sodium niobate, including the cubic-tetragonal-orthorhombic transformations and
ferroelectricity. The construction of the minimizers is based on compatibility
conditions which ensure continuous deformations and pole-free interfaces. These
minimizers agree with the experimental observations, including laminates
between the tetragonal variants under the cubic to tetragonal transformation,
crossing twins under the tetragonal to orthorhombic transformation,
intermediate twinning and spontaneous polarization. This shows how the full
nonlinear electroelastic model provides a powerful tool in understanding,
exploring and tailoring the electromechanical properties of complex
ferroelectric ceramics.

Magnetic order at room temperature induced by atomic lattice defects, like
vacancies, interstitials or pairs of them, has been observed in a large number
of different nonmagnetic hosts, such as pure graphite, oxides and silicon-based
materials. High Curie temperatures and time independent magnetic response at
room temperature indicate the extraordinary robustness of this new phenomenon
in solid state magnetism. In this work, we review experimental and theoretical
results in pure TiO$_2$ (anatase), which magnetic order can be triggered by
low-energy ion irradiation. In particular, we discuss the systematic
observation of an ultrathin magnetic layer with perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy at the surface of this oxide.

<h3>Ultracold plasmas from strongly anti-correlated Rydberg gases in the  Kinetic Field Theory formalism</h3>

The dynamics of correlated systems is relevant in many fields ranging from
cosmology to plasma physics. However, they are challenging to predict and
understand even for classical systems due to the typically large numbers of
particles involved. Here, we study the evolution of an ultracold, correlated
many-body system with repulsive interactions and initial correlations set by
the Rydberg blockade using the analytical framework of Kinetic Field Theory
(KFT). The KFT formalism is based on the path-integral formulation for
classical mechanics and was first developed and successfully used in cosmology
to describe structure formation in Dark Matter. The theoretical framework
offers a high flexibility regarding the initial configuration and interactions
between particles and, in addition, is computationally cheap. More importantly,
the analytic approach allows us to gain better insight into the processes which
dominate the dynamics. In this work we show that KFT can be applied in a much
more general context and study the evolution of a correlated ion plasma. We
find good agreement between the analytical KFT results for the evolution of the
correlation function and results obtained from numerical simulations. We use
the correlation functions obtained with KFT to compute the temperature increase
in the ionic system due to disorder-induced heating. For certain choices of
parameters we observe that the effect can be reversed, leading to correlation
cooling. Due to its numerical efficiency as compared to numerical simulations,
a detailed study using KFT can help to constrain parameter spaces where
disorder-induced heating is minimal in order to reach the regime of strong
coupling.

<h3>Effects of orientational and positional randomness of particles on  photonic band gap</h3>

A recent work [PRL, 126, 208002 (2021)] has explored how thermal
noise-induced randomness in a self-assembled photonic crystal affects photonic
band gaps (PBGs). For the system of a two-dimensional photonic crystal composed
of a self-assembled array of rods with square cross sections, it was found that
its PBGs can exist over an extensive range of packing densities.
Counterintuitively, at intermediate packing densities, the transverse magnetic
(TM) band gap of the self-assembled system can be larger than that of its
corresponding perfect system (rods arranged in a perfect square lattice and
having identical orientations). Due to shape anisotropicity, the randomness in
the self-assembled system contains two kinds of randomness, i.e., positional
and orientational randomness of the particles. In this work, we further
investigate how PBGs are influenced solely by positional or orientational
randomness. We find that compared to the perfect situation, the introduction of
only orientational randomness decreases the transverse electric (TE) band gap
while having no obvious effects on the transverse magnetic (TM) band gap. In
contrast, the introduction of only positional randomness decreases the TE band
gap significantly, while it can widen or narrow the TM band gap, depending on
the parameter range. We also discuss the thermal (i.e., self-assembled) system
where two kinds of randomness are present. Our study contributes to a better
understanding of the role orientational randomness and positional randomness
play on PBGs, and may benefit the PBG engineering of photonic crystals through
self-assembly approaches.

For the realization of magnon-based current-free technologies, referred to as
magnonics, all-optical control of magnons is an important technique for
fundamental research and application. Magnon-polariton is a coupled state of
magnon and photon in a magnetic medium, which is expected to exhibit a
magnon-like controllability and a photon-like high-speed propagation. Recent
studies have observed magnon-polaritons as modulation of the incident terahertz
wave; however, the influence of magnon-photon coupling on the magnon
propagation property has not been explored. This study aimed to observe the
spatiotemporal dynamics of coherent magnon-polariton through time-resolved
imaging measurements. $\mathrm{BiFeO_3}$ was chosen as the sample, because it
is expected to exhibit strong coupling between the magnon and photon. The
observed dynamics suggested that antiferromagnetic magnons can propagate over
long distances up to hundreds of micrometers through strong coupling with the
photons. The results shed light on the understanding of the optical control of
the magnonic systems thereby paving the way for terahertz opto-magnonics.

<h3>Signatures of two- and three-dimensional semimetals from circular  dichroism</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01829" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01829</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Topological invariants are crucial quantities for classifying materials with
topological phases. Hence, their connections with experimentally measurable
quantities are extremely important. In this context, circular dichroism (CD)
provides a protocol to detect the Chern number $\mathcal{C}_0$ of the lowest
energy Bloch band (LBB) of a semimetal. This hinges on the unequal depletion
rates of the Bloch electrons from a filled LBB, under the action of a
time-periodic circular drive, depending on the chirality of the polarization.
According to the dimensionality of the system (i.e., whether it is two- or
three-dimensional), the integrated differential rate for depletion has to be
formulated a bit differently in order to relate it to $\mathcal{C}_0$. Our aim
is to capture the nature of the CD response for semimetals with anisotropic
band dispersions. We show that while the quantization of the CD response for
the three-dimensional cases is strongly sensitive to anisotropy, the
two-dimensional counterparts show a perfectly quantized response.

<h3>Universality of the {\bf q}=1/2 Orbital Magnetism in the Pseudogap Phase  of the High-$T_c$ superconductor $\rm YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}$</h3>

<br>

Several decades of debate have centered around the nature of the enigmatic
pseudo-gap state in high temperature superconducting copper oxides. Recently,
we reported polarized neutron diffraction measurements that suggested the
existence of a magnetic texture bound to the pseudo-gap phase [Bounoua, {\it et
al}. Communications Physics 5, 268 (2022)]. Such a magnetic texture is likely
to involve the spontaneous appearance of loop currents within the CuO$_2$ unit
cells, which give birth to complex correlated patterns. In the underdoped ${\rm
YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6}}$, the magnetic structure factor of such an orbital
magnetic texture gives rise to two distinct magnetic responses at {\bf q}=0 and
{\bf q}=1/2. As this pattern alters the lattice translation invariance, such a
state of matter could contribute to an instability of the Fermi surface. Here,
we report polarized neutron scattering measurements on a nearly optimally doped
high quality single crystal of ${\rm YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.9}}$ that exhibits the
same {\bf q}=1/2 magnetism and a weakly overdoped ${\rm YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}}$
sample where this signal is no longer sizeable. The in-plane and out-of-plane
magnetic neutron scattering intensities in ${\rm YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.9}}$ (at
{\bf q}=1/2) and ${\rm YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.85}}$ (at {\bf q}=0), reported
previously, display the same temperature dependent hallmarks. The magnitudes of
both {\bf q}=0 and {\bf q}=1/2 magnetic signals further exhibit the same trends
upon doping in ${\rm YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}}$, confirming that they are likely
intertwined.

<h3>Stochastic entropy production for dynamical systems with restricted  diffusion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01882" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01882</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Modelling the evolution of a system using stochastic dynamics typically
implies a greater subjective uncertainty in the adopted system coordinates as
time progresses, and stochastic entropy production has been developed as a
measure of this change. In some situations the evolution of stochastic entropy
production can be described using an It\^o process, but mathematical
difficulties can emerge if diffusion in the system phase space is restricted to
a subspace of lower dimension. This can arise if there are constants of the
motion, for example, or more generally when there are functions of the
coordinates that evolve without noise. We discuss such a case for an open
three-level quantum system modelled within a framework of Markovian quantum
state diffusion and show how the problem of computing the stochastic entropy
production in such a situation can be overcome. We go on to illustrate how a
nonequilibrium stationary state of the three-level system, with a constant mean
production rate of stochastic entropy, can be established under suitable
environmental couplings.

<h3>The role of electron correlations in the electronic structure of  putative Chern magnet TbMn$_6$Sn$_6$ using correlated methods</h3>

A member of the RMn$_6$Sn$_6$ rare-earth family materials, TbMn$_6$Sn$_6$,
recently showed experimental signatures of the realization of a quantum-limit
Chern magnet. Despite the promising experimental results, theoretical studies
with accurate electron correlations which probe these observations have been
lacking. In this work, we use quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and density functional
theory with Hubbard $U$ (DFT$+U$) calculations to examine the electronic
structure of TbMn$_6$Sn$_6$. To do so, we optimize accurate,
correlation-consistent pseudopotentials for Tb and Sn using coupled-cluster and
configuration-interaction (CI) methods. We find that DFT$+U$ and single
reference QMC calculations suffer from the same overestimation of the magnetic
moments as meta-GGA and hybrid density functional approximations. Our findings
point to the need for improved orbitals/wavefunctions for this class of
materials, such as natural orbitals from CI, or for the inclusion of
multi-reference effects that capture the static correlations for an accurate
prediction of magnetic properties. The necessity for multi-reference treatment
is motivated by extrapolating the dynamic correlations to the exact limit.
DFT$+U$ with Mn magnetic moments adjusted to experiment predict the Dirac
crossing in bulk to be close to the Fermi level, within $\sim 120$ meV, in
agreement with the experiments. Our non-stoichiometric slab calculations show
that the Dirac crossing approaches even closer to the Fermi level, suggesting
the possible realization of Chern magnetism in this limit.
