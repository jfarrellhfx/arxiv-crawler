<h3>Aharonov-Bohm interference and the evolution of phase jumps in  fractional quantum Hall Fabry-Perot interferometers based on bi-layer  graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12432" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12432</a>

<i>Jehyun Kim, Himanshu Dev, Ravi Kumar, Alexey Ilin, André Haug, Vishal Bhardwaj, Changki Hong, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ady Stern, Yuval Ronen</i>
<p>Quasi-particles in fractional quantum Hall states are collective excitations
that carry fractional charge and anyonic statistics. While the fractional
charge affects semi-classical characteristics such as shot noise and charging
energies, the anyonic statistics is most notable in quantum interference
phenomena. In this study, we utilize a versatile bilayer graphene-based
Fabry-P\'erot Interferometer (FPI) that facilitates the study of a broad
spectrum of operating regimes, from Coulomb-dominated to Aharonov-Bohm, for
both integer and fractional quantum Hall states. Focusing on the $\nu$=$1 \over
3$ fractional quantum Hall state, we study the Aharonov-Bohm interference of
quasi-particles when the magnetic flux through an interference loop and the
charge density within the loop are independently varied. When their combined
variation is such that the Landau filling remains $1 \over 3$ we observe
pristine Aharonov-Bohm oscillations with a period of three flux quanta, as is
expected from the interference of quasi-particles of one-third of the electron
charge. When the combined variation is such that it leads to quasi-particles
addition or removal from the loop, phase jumps emerge, and alter the phase
evolution. Notably, across all cases, the average phase consistently increases
by 2$\pi$ with each addition of one electron to the loop.

<h3>Excitonic quantum criticality: from bilayer graphene to narrow Chern  bands</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12436" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12436</a>
<br>
<i>Zhengyan Darius Shi, Hart Goldman, Zhihuan Dong, T. Senthil</i>
<p>We study a family of excitonic quantum phase transitions describing the
evolution of a bilayer metallic state to an inter-layer coherent state where
excitons condense. We argue that such transitions can be continuous and exhibit
a non-Fermi liquid counterflow response
${\rho_{\mathrm{counterflow}}(\omega)\sim\omega^{2/z}}$ that directly encodes
the dynamical critical exponent $z$. This physics is relevant to any system
with spin, valley, or layer degrees of freedom. We consider two contexts for
excitonic quantum criticality: (1) a weakly interacting graphene bilayer, and
(2) a system of two narrow, half-filled Chern bands at zero external magnetic
field, with total Chern number $C_{\mathrm{tot}}=0$, which may soon be
realizable in moir\'{e} fractional quantum anomalous Hall systems. The latter
system hosts a time-reversed pair of composite Fermi liquid states, and the
condensation of excitons of the composite fermions leads to an exotic exciton
insulator* state with a charge neutral Fermi surface. Our work sheds new light
on the physics of inter-layer coherence transitions in 2D materials, and it
constitutes the first unambiguous example of quantum critical transport in a
clean non-Fermi liquid metal.

<h3>Quantum phase transitions in one-dimensional nanostructures: a  comparison between DFT and DMRG methodologies</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12463" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12463</a>
<br>
<i>T. Pauletti, M. Sanino, L. Gimenes, I. M. Carvalho, V. V. França</i>
<p>In the realm of quantum chemistry, the accurate prediction of electronic
structure and properties of nanostructures remains a formidable challenge.
Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG)
have emerged as two powerful computational methods for addressing electronic
correlation effects in diverse molecular systems. We compare ground-state
energies ($e_0$), density profiles ($n$) and average entanglement entropies
($\bar S$) in metals, insulators and at the transition from metal to insulator,
in homogeneous, superlattices and harmonically confined chains described by the
fermionic one-dimensional Hubbard model. While for the homogeneous systems
there is a clear hierarchy between the deviations, $D\%(\bar S)<D\%(e_0)< \bar
D\%(n)$, and all the deviations decrease with the chain size; for superlattices
and harmonical confinement the relation among the deviations is less trivial
and strongly dependent on the superlattice structure and the confinement
strength considered. For the superlattices, in general increasing the number of
impurities in the unit cell represents less precision on the DFT calculations.
For the confined chains, DFT performs better for metallic phases, while the
highest deviations appear for the Mott and band-insulator phases. This work
provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of these methodologies, shedding
light on their respective strengths, limitations, and applications.

<h3>Field-extension statistics of charged semiflexible polymers stretched  with uniform electric fields</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12470" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12470</a>
<br>
<i>Ananya Mondal, Greg Morrison</i>
<p>Single-molecule force-extension experiments have allowed quantitative
measurements of the mechanical responses of biomolecules to applied forces
explaining their roles in key biological functions. Electrophoretic stretching
of charged polymers such as DNA in uniform electric fields is one such example,
currently, used for sequencing purposes. Field-extension statistics of charged
polymers differ from laser optical tweezer setups due to a non-uniform tension
along the backbone of the chain, the effects of which remain poorly understood.
In this paper, we modify an existing analytically tractable mean-field (MF)
approach to account for the heterogeneity in tension for electric fields.
Naively using this model for stretching of charged polymers such as DNA under
electric fields results in local overstretching of the chain and gives
inaccurate field-extension statistics. We improve this approach and account for
the inhomogeneity in the tension by subdividing the chain into smaller segments
while imposing the inextensibility of the chain. We find that the subdivided MF
model shows better agreement with the simulations for the force-extension
plots. We also show that using an isotropic mean-field model overestimates the
longitudinal fluctuations both for tension forces as well as for fields. We
correct the quantitative predictions for the fluctuations in the mean extension
by numerically differentiating the field-extension plots. We also find that the
subdivided MF model can accurately predict the statistics of experimentally
relevant quantities, such as transverse fluctuations, due to the analytical
tractability of the model. These field-extension predictions may be further
used to introduce confinement effects in the subdivided MF model and develop a
comprehensive understanding of sequencing technologies.

<h3>Geometrical theory of the shift current in presence of disorder and  interaction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12489" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12489</a>
<br>
<i>Raffaele Resta</i>
<p>The electric field of light induces--in a non centrosymmetric insulator--a dc
current, quadratic in the field magnitude, and called "shift current". When
addressed from a many-electron viewpoint, the shift current has a simple
explanation and a simple formulation as well, deeply rooted in quantum
geometry. The basic formula is then specialized to the independent-electron
case, first for a disordered system in a supercell formulation, and then for a
crystalline system. In the latter case the known shift-current formula is
retrieved in a very transparent way.

<h3>Data-driven study of composition-dependent phase compatibility in NiTi  shape memory alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12520" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12520</a>
<br>
<i>Sina Hossein Zadeh, Cem Cakirhan, Danial Khatamsaz, John Broucek, Timothy D. Brown, Xiaoning Qian, Ibrahim Karaman, Raymundo Arroyave</i>
<p>The martensitic transformation in NiTi-based Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs)
provides a basis for shape memory effect and superelasticity, thereby enabling
applications requiring solid-state actuation and large recoverable shape
changes upon mechanical load cycling. In order to tailor the transformation to
a particular application, the compositional dependence of properties in
NiTi-based SMAs, such as martensitic transformation temperatures and
hysteresis, has been exploited. However, the compositional design space is
large and complex, and experimental studies are expensive. In this work, we
develop an interpretable piecewise linear regression model that predicts the
$\lambda_2$ parameter, a measure of compatibility between austenite and
martensite phases, and an (indirect) factor that is well-correlated with
martensitic transformation hysteresis, based on the chemical features derived
from the alloy composition. The model is capable of predicting, for the first
time, the type of martensitic transformation for a given alloy chemistry. The
proposed model is validated by experimental data from the literature as well as
in-house measurements. The results show that the model can effectively
distinguish between $B19$ and $B19^{\prime}$ regions for any given composition
in NiTi-based SMAs and accurately estimate the $\lambda_2$ parameter. Our
analysis also reveals that the weighted average of the quotient of the first
ionization energy and the Voronoi coordination number is a key compositional
characteristic that correlates with the $\lambda_2$ parameter and thermodynamic
responses, including the transformation hysteresis, martensite start
temperature, and critical temperature. The work herein demonstrates the
potential of data-driven methodologies for understanding and designing
NiTi-based SMAs with desired transformation characteristics.

<h3>Revisiting thermodynamics in (LiF, NaF, KF, CrF2)-CrF3 by  first-principles calculations and CALPHAD modeling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12574" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12574</a>
<br>
<i>Rushi Gong, Shun-Li Shang, Yi Wang, Jorge Paz Soldan Palma, Hojong Kim, Zi-Kui Liu</i>
<p>The thermodynamic description of the (LiF, NaF, KF, CrF2)-CrF3 systems has
been revisited, aiming for a better understanding of the effects of Cr on the
FLiNaK molten salt. First-principles calculations based on density functional
theory (DFT) were performed to determine the electronic and structural
properties of each compound, including the formation enthalpy, volume, and bulk
modulus. DFT-based phonon calculations were carried out to determine the
thermodynamic properties of compounds, for example, enthalpy, entropy, and heat
capacity as functions of temperature. Phonon-based thermodynamic properties
show a good agreement with experimental data of binary compounds LiF, NaF, KF,
CrF3, and CrF2, establishing a solid foundation to determine thermodynamic
properties of ternary compounds as well as to verify results estimated by the
Neumann-Kopp rule. Additionally, DFT-based ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)
simulations were employed to predict the mixing enthalpies of liquid salts.
Using DFT-based results and experimental data in the literature, the (LiF, NaF,
KF, CrF2)-CrF3 system has been remodeled in terms of the CALculation of PHAse
Diagrams (CALPHAD) approach using the modified quasichemical model with
quadruplet approximation (MQMQA) for liquid. Calculated phase stability in the
present work shows an excellent agreement with experiments, indicating the
effectiveness of combining DFT-based total energy, phonon, and AIMD
calculations, and CALPHAD modeling to provide the thermodynamic description in
complex molten salt systems.

<h3>Ultrafast dynamics of a fermion chain in a terahertz field-driven  optical cavity</h3>

<br>
<i>Mohsen Yarmohammadi, John Sous, Marin Bukov, Michael H. Kolodrubetz</i>
<p>We study the effect of a terahertz field-driven single cavity mode for
ultrafast control of a fermion chain with dissipation-induced nonlinearity and
quadratic coupling to an infrared-active phonon mode. Without photon loss from
the cavity, we uncover a first-order phase transition in the nonequilibrium
steady state only for the lower phonon-polariton, accompanied by polaritons
whose frequency response is asymmetric with respect to the photon frequency due
to the direct laser-induced dressing effect on the photon. A weak laser field
fails to induce the phase transition but renders the polaritons symmetrical.
Finally, we show that sufficiently strong photon loss from the cavity
eliminates the polaritons and the associated phase transition. The experimental
feasibility of these phenomena is also proposed.

<h3>Direct writing of room temperature polariton condensate lattice by  top-down approach</h3>

<p>Realizing lattices of exciton polariton condensates has been of much interest
owing to the potential of such systems to realize analog Hamiltonian simulators
and physical computing architectures. Prior work on polariton condensate
lattices has primarily been on GaAs-based systems, with the recent advent of
organic molecules and perovskite systems allowing room-temperature operation.
However, in most of these room temperature systems, the lattices are defined
using a bottom-up approach by patterning the bottom mirrors, significantly
limiting the types of lattices and refractive index contrast that can be
realized. Here, we report a direct write approach that uses a Focused Ion Beam
(FIB) to etch 2D lattice into a planar microcavity. Such etching of the cavity
allows for realizing high refractive index contrast lattices. We realize the
polariton condensate lattice using the highly photostable host-guest Frenkel
excitons of an organic dye small molecular ionic lattice (SMILES).1,2 The
lattice structures are defined on a planar microcavity embedded with SMILES
using FIB, allowing the realization of lattices with different geometries,
including defect sites on demand. The band structure of the lattice and the
emergence of condensation are imaged using momentum-resolved spectroscopy. The
present approach allows us to study periodic, quasi-periodic, and disordered
polariton condensate lattices at room temperature using a top-down approach
without compromising on the quantum yield of the organic excitonic material
embedded in the cavity.

<h3>Interlayer ferroelectric polarization modulated anomalous Hall effects  in four-layer MnBi2Te4 antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12603" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12603</a>
<br>
<i>Ziyu Niu, Xiang-Long Yu, Dingfu Shao, Xixiang Jing, Defeng Hou, Xuhong Li, Jing Sun, Junqin Shi, Xiaoli Fan, Tengfei Cao</i>
<p>Van der Waals (vdW) assembly could efficiently modulate the symmetry of
two-dimensional (2D) materials that ultimately governs their physical
properties. Of particular interest is the ferroelectric polarization being
introduced by proper vdW assembly that enables the realization of novel
electronic, magnetic and transport properties of 2D materials. Four-layer
antiferromagnetic MnBi2Te4 (F-MBT) offers an excellent platform to explore
ferroelectric polarization effects on magnetic order and topological transport
properties of nanomaterials. Here, by applying symmetry analyses and
density-functional-theory calculations, the ferroelectric interface effects on
magnetic order, anomalous Hall effect (AHE) or even quantum AHE (QAHE) on the
F-MBT are analyzed. Interlayer ferroelectric polarization in F-MBT efficiently
violates the PT symmetry (the combination symmetry of central inversion (P) and
time reverse (T) of the F-MBT by conferring magnetoelectric couplings, and
stabilizes a specific antiferromagnetic order encompassing a ferromagnetic
interface in the F-MBT. We predict that engineering an interlayer polarization
in the top or bottom interface of F-MBT allows converting F-MBT from a trivial
insulator to a Chern insulator. The switching of ferroelectric polarization at
the middle interfaces results in a direction reversal of the quantum anomalous
Hall current. Additionally, the interlayer polarization of the top and bottom
interfaces can be aligned in the same direction, and the switching of
polarization direction also reverses the direction of anomalous Hall currents.
Overall, our work highlights the occurrence of quantum-transport phenomena in
2D vdW four-layer antiferromagnets through vdW assembly. These phenomena are
absent in the bulk or thin-film in bulk-like stacking forms of MnBi2Te4.

<h3>Nature of Topological Phase Transition of Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12610" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12610</a>
<br>
<i>Huanzhi Hu, Frank Krüger</i>
<p>We investigate the nature of the topological quantum phase transition between
the gapless and gapped Kitaev quantum spin liquid phases away from the exactly
solvable point. The transition is driven by anisotropy of the Kitaev couplings.
At the critical point the two Dirac points of the gapless Majorana modes merge,
resulting in the formation of a semi-Dirac point with quadratic and linear band
touching directions. We derive an effective Gross-Neveu-Yukawa type field
theory that describes the topological phase transition in the presence of
additional magnetic interactions. We obtain the infrared scaling form of the
propagator of the dynamical Ising order parameter field and perform a
renormalization-group analysis. The universality of the transition is found to
be different to that of symmetry-breaking phase transitions of semi-Dirac
electrons. However, as in the electronic case, the Majorana fermions acquire an
anomalous dimension, indicative of the breakdown of the fractionalized
quasiparticle description.

<h3>Electron-phonon coupling in ferromagnetic Fe-Co alloys from first  principles</h3>

<i>Kevin Moseni, Richard B Wilson, Sinisa Coh</i>
<p>We calculate from first principles the electron-phonon coupling strength in
ferromagnetic iron-cobalt Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$ alloys for compositions ranging from
$x=0$ to $x=0.75$. We find strong, spin-dependent variation of the
electron-phonon coupling strength with alloy composition. The minimum of the
electron-phonon interaction is found near the composition $x=0.25$. We analyze
the variation of the electron-phonon interaction with composition, as a
function of electron spin, density of states, electron-phonon matrix elements,
and phonon frequencies. Our results are in good qualitative agreement with
magnetization dynamics experiments.

<h3>Phonon-lithium ion interactions: A case study of LiM(SeO3)2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12671" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12671</a>
<br>
<i>Runxin Ouyang, Yu Yang, Chaohong Guan, Hong Zhu</i>
<p>Li ion diffusion is fundamentally a thermally activated ion hopping process.
Recently, soft lattice, anharmonic phonon and paddlewheel mechanism have been
proposed to potentially benefit the ion transport, while the understanding of
vibrational couplings of mobile ion and anions is still limited but essential.
Herein, we access the ionic conductivity, the stability and the lattice
dynamics in LiM(SeO3)2 (M =Al, Ga, In, Sc, Y, and La) with two types of oxygen
anions within LiO4 polyhedron, namely edge-shared and corner-shared, the
prototype of which, LiGa(SeO3)2, has been experimentally synthesized. We
studied in detail the anharmonic and harmonic phonon interactions, as well as
couplings between vibrations of edge-bonded or corner-bonded anions in Li
polyanions and Li ion diffusion. As M changing from Sc to La, anharmonic
phonons increase alongside reduced activation energy for Li diffusion. Phonon
modes involving edge-bonded oxygen anions contribute more to Li migration than
corner-bonded oxygen anions, owing to greater atomic interactions between Li
ions and edge-bonded anions. Thus, rather than the overall lattice softness,
attentions shall be paid to reduce the frequency of the critical phonons
contributing to Li ion diffusions as well as to increase the anharmonicity, for
the design of Li ion superionic conductors for all-solid-state-batteries.

<h3>Topological nano-switches in higher-order topological insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12693" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12693</a>
<br>
<i>Joseph Poata, Fabio Taddei, Michele Governale</i>
<p>We consider multi-terminal transport through a flake of rectangular shape of
a two-dimensional topological insulator in the presence of an in-plane magnetic
field. This system has been shown to be a second-order topological insulator,
thus exhibiting corner states at its boundaries. The position of the corner
states and their decay length can be controlled by the direction of the
magnetic field. In the leads we assume that the magnetic field is absent and
therefore we have helical one-dimensional propagating states characteristic of
the spin-Hall effect. Using a low-energy effective Hamiltonian we show
analytically that, in a two-terminal setup, transport can be turned on and off
by a rotation of the in-plane magnetic field. Similarly, in a three terminal
configuration, the in-plane magnetic field can be used to turn on and off the
transmission between neighbouring contacts, thus realising a directional
switch. Analytical calculations are supplemented by a numerical
finite-difference method. For small values of the Fermi energy and field
strength, the analytical results agree exceptionally well with the numerics.
The effect of disorder is also addressed in the numerical approach. We find
that the switching functionality is remarkably robust to the presence of strong
disorder stemming from the topological nature of the states contributing to the
electron transport.

<h3>Measurement of Nanoscale Interfacial Contact Area Using Vibrational  Spectroscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12697" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12697</a>
<br>
<i>Utkarsh Patil, Stephen Merriman, Shubhendu Kumar, Ali Dhinojwala</i>
<p>Understanding the extent of contact between objects is crucial for
surface-driven phenomena in the natural world. While interactions are known to
occur at subnanometer-length scales, the techniques needed to measure such
small-length scales are lacking. We combined two complementary techniques of
attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy coupled with an
imaging detector and sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy to
characterize the real contact area between surfaces. Imaging ATR-IR provides
the distribution of airgap separation between the surfaces at larger than
molecular length scales as well as an estimation of the real contact area.
Additionally, SFG directly probes the intermolecular interactions occurring at
molecular scales. Through the combination of these techniques, we show how
contact is achieved for both thin, rigid/glassy polymer films on top of soft
elastomers and rigid/glassy samples. Interestingly, we also show that the
orientation of the molecules in contact is a critically important factor that
influences interfacial interactions rather than just the number of molecular
sites in contact.

<i>Niuchang Ouyang, Dongyi Shen, Chen Wang, Ruihuan Cheng, Qi Wang, Yue Chen</i>
<p>The phonon transport mechanisms and the anomalous temperature-dependent
lattice thermal conductivities (kL) in Ag-based argyrodites have not been fully
understood. Herein, we systematically study the phonon thermal transport of
five Ag-based crystalline argyrodites Ag7PS6, Ag7AsS6, Ag8SnS6, Ag8GeS6 and
Ag9GaS6 utilizing perturbation theory and the unified theory thermal transport
model. Our results show that, as the complexity of the unit cell increases, the
proportion of the population terms falls while the coherence contributions
become more significant, leading to the relatively weak temperature-dependent
kL of Ag7PS6 and Ag7AsS6, while the more complex crystalline argyrodites,
Ag8SnS6, Ag8GeS6 and Ag9GaS6, exhibiting a glass-like behavior in their
temperature dependence of kL. We attribute the positive temperature-dependent
and ultralow kL of Ag8SnS6, Ag8GeS6 and Ag9GaS6 to the dominance of wavelike
phonons and the strong phonon broadening. Furthermore, using laser flash
measurements and the homogeneous non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations
based on accurate machine learning neuroevolution potentials, we provide
further evidence for the glass-like temperature-dependent kL of Ag8SnS6 and
Ag8GeS6.

<h3>Chemical Rules for Stacked Kagome and Honeycomb Topological Semimetals</h3>

<br>
<i>Liqin Zhou, Fazhi Yang, Shuai Zhang, Tiantian Zhang</i>
<p>We study the chemical rules for predicting and understanding topological
states in stacked kagome and honeycomb lattices in both analytical and
numerical ways. Starting with a minimal five-band tight-binding model, we sort
out all the topological states into five groups, which are determined by the
interlayer and intralayer hopping parameters. Combined with the model, we
design an algorithm to obtain a series of experimentally synthesized
topological semimetals with kagome and honeycomb layers, i.e., IAMX family (IA
= Alkali metal element, M = Rare earth metal element, X = Carbon group
element), in the inorganic crystal structure database. A follow-up
high-throughput calculation shows that IAMX family materials are all nodal-line
semimetals and they will be Weyl semimetals after taking spin-orbit coupling
into consideration. To have further insights into the topology of the IAMX
family, a detailed chemical rule analysis is carried out on the high-throughput
calculations, including the lattice constants of the structure, intralayer and
interlayer couplings, bond strengths, electronegativity, and so on, which are
consistent with our tight-binding model. Our study provides a way to discover
and modulate topological properties in stacked kagome and honeycomb crystals
and offers candidates for studying topology-related properties like topological
superconductors and axion insulators.

<i>Masae Katai, Parisa Edalati, Jacqueline Hidalgo-Jimenez, Yu Shundo, Taner Akbay, Tatsumi Ishihara, Makoto Arita, Masayoshi Fuji, Kaveh Edalati</i>
<p>Photocatalytic CO2 conversion is a clean technology to deal with CO2
emissions, and titanium oxide (TiO2) polymorphs are the most investigated
photocatalysts for such an application. In this study, black TiO2 brookite is
produced by a high-pressure torsion (HPT) method and employed as an active
photocatalyst for CO2 conversion. Black brookite with a large concentration of
lattice defects (vacancies, dislocations and grain boundaries) showed enhanced
light absorbance, narrowed optical bandgap and diminished recombination rate of
electrons and holes. The photocatalytic activity of the black oxide for CO2
conversion was higher compared to commercial brookite and benchmark P25
catalyst powders. First-principles calculations suggested that the presence of
oxygen vacancies in black brookite is effective not only for reducing optical
bandgap but also for providing active sites for the adsorption of CO2 on the
surface of TiO2.

<h3>Molten Salt Flux Liquid Transport Method for Ultra Clean Single Crystals  UTe2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12740" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12740</a>
<br>
<i>Dai Aoki</i>
<p>Various single crystal growth techniques are presented for the unconventional
superconductor UTe2. The molten salt flux liquid transport (MSFLT) method is
employed to grow high-quality and large single crystals, exhibiting a high
residual resistivity ratio (RRR = 200-800). On the other hand, the Te self-flux
and chemical vapor transport (CVT) method produces samples of lower quality.
The MSFLT method is a hybrid approach that combines the molten salt flux (MSF)
and CVT methods. One significant advantage is that the materials gradually
crystallize at the relatively low temperature which is fixed during the main
process. This might be crucial for preventing U deficiency and obtaining
high-quality and large single crystals of UTe2. Many different single crystals
obtained by different technique were characterized by resistivity, specific
heat measurements. The superconducting transition temperature decreases with
the residual resistivity, followed by the Abrikosov-Gor'kov pair breaking
theory. The highest quality sample reaches Tc=2.1K. The residual gamma-value of
specific heat for the highest quality sample is only 3 percents of the normal
state gamma-value. The specific heat jump, Delta C/(gamma Tc) reaches about 2.7
for high quality samples, indicating a strong coupling superconductor.
Furthermore, the magnetic susceptibility for the field along a-axis in a high
quality single crystal does not show an up-turn behavior on cooling, which is
consistent with the results of NMR Knight shift and muSR experiments.

<h3>Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory of the vortex spin Hall effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12758" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12758</a>
<br>
<i>Hiroto Adachi, Yusuke Kato, Jun-ichiro Ohe, Masanori Ichioka</i>
<p>We develop a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory of the vortex spin Hall
effect, i.e., a novel spin Hall effect that is driven by the motion of
superconducting vortices. For the direct vortex spin Hall effect in which an
input charge current drives the transverse spin current accompanying the vortex
motion, we start from the well-known Schmid-Caroli-Maki solution for the
time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation under the applied electric field, and
find out the expression of the induced spin current. For the inverse vortex
spin Hall effect in which an input spin current drives the longitudinal vortex
motion and produces the transverse charge current, we microscopically construct
the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation under the applied spin accumulation
gradient, and calculate the induced transverse charge current as well as the
open circuit voltage. The time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation and its
analytical solution developed here can be a basis for more qualitative
numerical simulations of the vortex spin Hall effect.

<i>E. G. Mishchenko</i>
<p>Hot electrons formed in a graphene crystal by high-intensity short-duration
laser pulses can exist for a time that is less than an electron-phonon energy
relaxation time. During that time, electron-electron collisions cause the
electrons to thermalize to a local effective temperature that propagates
(diffuses) through graphene. The non-uniform nature of the electron temperature
leads to a force acting on the graphene lattice. This force is the result of
the electron-lattice interaction that exists even at times that are less than
the electron-phonon scattering time. The force causes the lattice to deform. A
Boltzmann equation description of the transient electron-lattice deformation
causes by hot electrons in graphene is presented.

<i>Daisy Q. Wang, Zeb Krix, Olga A. Tkachenko, Vitaly A. Tkachenko, Chong Chen, Ian Farrer, David A. Ritchie, Oleg P. Sushkov, Alexander R. Hamilton, Oleh Klochan</i>
<p>The electronic properties of solids are determined by the crystal structure
and interactions between electrons, giving rise to a variety of collective
phenomena including superconductivity, strange metals and correlated
insulators. The mechanisms underpinning many of these collective phenomena
remain unknown, driving interest in creating artificial crystals which
replicate the system of interest while allowing precise control of key
parameters. Cold atoms trapped in optical lattices provide great flexibility
and tunability [1, 2], but cannot replicate the long range Coulomb interactions
and long range hopping that drive collective phenomena in real crystals. Solid
state approaches support long range hopping and interactions, but previous
attempts with laterally patterned semiconductor systems were not able to create
tunable low disorder artificial crystals, while approaches based on Moire
superlattices in twisted two-dimensional (2D) materials [3, 4] have limited
tunability and control of lattice geometry. Here we demonstrate the formation
of highly tunable artificial crystals by superimposing a periodic electrostatic
potential on the 2D electron gas in an ultrashallow (25 nm deep) GaAs quantum
well. The 100 nm period artificial crystal is identified by the formation of a
new bandstructure, different from the original cubic crystal and unique to the
artificial triangular lattice: transport measurements show the Hall coefficient
changing sign as the chemical potential sweeps through the artificial bands.
Uniquely, the artificial bandstructure can be continuously tuned from parabolic
free-electron bands into linear graphene-like and flat kagome-like bands in a
single device. This approach allows the formation arbitrary geometry 2D
artificial crystals, opening a new route to studying collective quantum states.

<br>
<i>Yoon Seong Heo, Tae Wan Kim, Wooseok Lee, Jungseok Choi, Soyeon Park, Dong-Il Yeom, Jae-Ung Lee</i>
<p>Mesoscopic-scale stacking reconfigurations are investigated when van der
Waals films are stacked. We have developed a method to visualize complicated
stacking structures and mechanical distortions simultaneously in stacked
atom-thick films using Raman spectroscopy. In the rigid limit, we found that
the distortions originate from the transfer process, which can be understood
through thin film mechanics with a large elastic property mismatch. In
contrast, with atomic corrugations, the in-plane strain fields are more closely
correlated with the stacking configuration, highlighting the impact of atomic
reconstructions on the mesoscopic scale. We discovered that the grain
boundaries don`t have a significant effect while the cracks are causing
inhomogeneous strain in stacked polycrystalline films. This result contributes
to understanding the local variation of emerging properties from moir\'e
structures and advancing the reliability of stacked vdW material fabrication.

<h3>Revisiting the Second Vassiliev (In)variant for Polymer Knots</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12775" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12775</a>
<br>
<i>Alexander R. Klotz, Benjamin Estabrooks</i>
<p>Knots in open strands such as ropes, fibers, and polymers, cannot typically
be described in the language of knot theory, which characterizes only closed
curves in space. Simulations of open knotted polymer chains, often
parameterized to DNA, typically perform a closure operation and calculate the
Alexander polynomial to assign a knot topology. This is limited in scenarios
where the topology is less well-defined, for example when the chain is in the
process of untying or is strongly confined. Here, we use a discretized version
of the Second Vassiliev Invariant for open chains to analyze Langevin Dynamics
simulations of untying and strongly confined polymer chains. We demonstrate
that the Vassiliev parameter can accurately and efficiently characterize the
knotted state of polymers, providing additional information not captured by a
single-closure Alexander calculation. We discuss its relative strengths and
weaknesses compared to standard techniques, and argue that it is a useful and
powerful tool for analyzing polymer knot simulations.

<h3>First-Principle Characterization of Structural, Electronic, and Optical  Properties of Tin-Halide Monomers</h3>

<br>
<i>Freerk Schütt, Ana M. Valencia, Caterina Cocchi</i>
<p>The growing interest in tin-halide semiconductors for photovoltaic
applications demands an in-depth knowledge of the fundamental properties of its
constituents, starting from the smallest monomers entering the initial stages
of formation. In this first-principles work based on time-dependent
density-functional theory, we investigate the structural, electronic, and
optical properties of tin-halide molecules SnX$_n^{2-n}$, with $n=1,2,3,4$ and
X = Cl, Br, I, simulating these compounds in vacuo as well as in an implicit
solvent. We find that structural properties are very sensitive to the halogen
species while the charge distribution is also affected by stoichiometry. The
ionicity of the Sn-X bond is confirmed by the Bader charge analysis albeit
charge displacement plots point to more complex metal-halide coordination.
Particular focus is posed on the neutral molecules SnX$_2$, for which
electronic and optical properties are discussed in detail. Band gaps and
absorption onset decrease with increasing size of the halogen species and
despite general common features, each molecule displays peculiar optical
signatures. Our results are elaborated in the context of experimental and
theoretical literature, including the more widely studied lead-halide analogs,
aiming to contribute with microscopic insight to a better understanding of
tin-halide perovskites.

<h3>Pressure evolution of the normal- and superconducting-state properties  of the line-nodal material CaSb$_2$ revealed by $^{123}$Sb nuclear quadrupole  resonance</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12783" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12783</a>
<br>
<i>H. Takahashi, S. Kitagawa, K. Ishida, A. Ikeda, S. R. Saha, S. Yonezawa, J. Paglione, Y. Maeno</i>
<p>CaSb$_2$ is the Dirac line-nodal material that exhibits a superconducting
(SC) transition at 1.7 K. In spite of its conventional SC state at ambient
pressure, the transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ shows a peak structure
against hydrostatic pressure. We performed ac magnetic susceptibility and
$^{123}$Sb nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements on
single-crystalline CaSb$_2$ under pressures up to 2.08 GPa. $T_{\mathrm{c}}$
monotonically increased in this pressure region, which is consistent with a
previous study. We observed continuous broadening of the NQR spectrum against
pressure, which is a sign of unique compression behavior of the lattice. In the
normal state, the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/$T_1$ is proportional
to temperature in all pressure values; typical of a metal. However, 1/$T_1T$ in
the normal state is independent of pressure, indicating that the density of
states at the Fermi energy $N(E_{\mathrm{F}})$, which is one of the parameters
governing $T_{\mathrm{c}}$, is insensitive to pressure. From these results, we
conclude that $N(E_{\mathrm{F}})$ does not govern the origin of the enhancement
in $T_{\mathrm{c}}$. This is unusual for a weak electron-phonon coupling
superconductor. In the SC state, we revealed that the SC gap becomes larger and
more isotropic under pressure.

<h3>Single-site DFT+DMFT for vanadium dioxide using bond-centered orbitals</h3>

<br>
<i>Peter Mlkvik, Maximilian E. Merkel, Nicola A. Spaldin, Claude Ederer</i>
<p>We present a combined density-functional theory and single-site dynamical
mean-field theory (DMFT) study of vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) using an
unconventional set of bond-centered orbitals as the basis of the correlated
subspace. VO$_2$ is a prototypical material undergoing a metal-insulator
transition (MIT), hosting both intriguing physical phenomena and the potential
for industrial applications. With our choice of correlated subspace basis, we
investigate the interplay of structural dimerization and electronic
correlations in VO$_2$ in a computationally cheaper way compared to other
state-of-the-art methods such as cluster DMFT. Our approach allows us to treat
the rutile and M1 monoclinic VO$_2$ phases on an equal footing and to vary the
dimerizing distortion continuously, exploring the energetics of the transition
between the two phases. The choice of basis presented in this work hence offers
a complementary view on the long-standing discussion of the MIT in VO$_2$ and
suggests possible future extensions to other similar materials hosting
molecular-orbital-like states.

<p>This work aims to study the insertion of AlCl_4^- anion in the crystalline

itself. The electronic and atomic structures of the anion at different

contraction of the anion bonding at the highest intercalation degree obtained
electrochemically (stage 3), while the electronic population changes for both
the edges upon cycle.

<p>We document the ground state phase diagram of the one-dimensional Kitaev
chain with quasi-periodic disorder in the presence of two-body interactions.
Our data was obtained for systems of $L=1000$ sites using large-scale density
matrix renormalization group numerics and is benchmarked against known results
for the clean system. We demonstrate that moderate quasi-periodic disorder
stabilizes the topological phase both for repulsive and attractive
interactions. For larger disorder strengths, the system features re-entrance
behavior and multiple phase transitions.

<h3>High-harmonic generation in semi-Dirac and Weyl semimetals with broken  time-reversal symmetry: Exploring merging of Weyl nodes</h3>

<p>We explore anomalous high-harmonic generation in a model that realizes a
transition from a broken time-reversal symmetry Weyl-semimetal to a semi-Dirac
regime, i.e. a gapless semimetal with dispersion that is parabolic in one
direction and conical in the other two. We point out the intensity of the
induced anomalous high harmonics is high in the semi-Dirac regime. For Weyl
semimetals, we reveal anomalous high harmonics are due to excitations at
momenta where the dispersion is not strictly linear and that in the linearized
low-energy theory the anomalous response is harmonic only. Our findings aid
experimental characterization of Weyl, Dirac, and semi-Dirac semimetals.

<h3>Calculation of Poincaré recurrence time and irreversibility in  Statistical Mechanics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12910" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12910</a>
<br>
<i>Dominique Levesque, Nicolas Sourlas</i>
<p>One of the important questions in statistical mechanics is how
irreversibility (time's arrow) occurs when Newton equations of motion are time
reversal invariant. Boltzmann's argument is that the observed irreversibility
is due to the very large number of particles. One objection to Boltzmann was
based on Poincar\'e's recursion theorem: a classical hamiltonian confined
system returns after some time, called today Poincar\'e recurrence time (PRT),
close to its initial configuration. Boltzmann's reply was that for $N = 10^{23}
$ particles, PRT is very large and exceeds the age of the universe. In this
paper we compute for the first time, a typical recurrence time $ T(N)$ for a
gas of $N$ particles. We find that $T(N) \sim N^z \exp (y N) $ and determine
the exponents $y$ and $z$ for different values of the particle density and
kinetic energy (temperature).
We find that $ T(N) $ exceeds the age of the Universe for a relatively small
number of particles, much smaller than $ 10^{23} $.
Our results support Boltzmann's argument on the origin of irreversibility in
statistical mechanics.

<p>Hydrogen radical attacks and subsequent hydrogen migrations are considered to
play an important role in the atomic-scale mechanisms of diamond chemical
vapour deposition growth. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the reactions
involving H-radical and vacancies on H-passivated diamond surfaces exposed to
hydrogen radical-rich atmosphere. By means of first principles calculations --
density functional theory and climbing image nudged elastic band method --
transition states related to these mechanisms are identified and characterised.
In addition, accurate reaction rates are computed using variational transition
state theory. Together, these methods provide -- for a broad range of
temperatures and hydrogen radical concentrations -- a picture of the relative
likelihood of the migration or radical attack processes, along with a
statistical description of the hydrogen coverage fraction of the (100)
H-passivated surface, refining earlier results via a more thorough analysis of
the processes at stake. Additionally, the migration of H-vacancy is shown to be
anisotropic, and occurring preferentially across the dimer rows of the
reconstructed surface. The approach used in this work can be generalised to
other crystallographic orientations of diamond surfaces or other
semiconductors.

<h3>Antiferromagnetic Chern insulator with large charge gap in heavy  transition-metal compounds</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12918" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12918</a>
<br>
<i>Mohsen Hafez-Torbati, Götz S. Uhrig</i>
<p>Despite the discovery of multiple intrinsic magnetic topological insulators
in recent years the observation of Chern insulators is still restricted to very
low temperatures due to the negligible charge gaps. Here, we uncover the
potential of heavy transition-metal compounds for realizing a collinear
antiferromagnetic Chern insulator (AFCI) with a charge gap as large as 300 meV.
Our analysis relies on the Kane-Mele-Kondo model with a ferromagnetic Hund
coupling $J_{\rm H}$ between the spins of itinerant electrons and the localized
spins of size $S$. We show that a spin-orbit coupling $\lambda_{\rm SO} \gtrsim
0.03t$, where $t$ is the nearest-neighbor hopping element, is already large
enough to stabilize an AFCI provided the alternating sublattice potential
$\delta$ is in the range $\delta \approx SJ_{\rm H}$. We establish a remarkable
increase in the charge gap upon increasing $\lambda_{\rm SO}$ in the AFCI
phase. Using our results we explain the collinear AFCI recently found in
monolayers of CrO and MoO with charge gaps of 1 and $50$ meV, respectively. In
addition, we propose bilayers of heavy transition-metal oxides of perovskite
structure as candidates to realize a room-temperature AFCI if grown along the
$[111]$ direction and subjected to a perpendicular electric field.

<i>Giorgia Greco, Giuseppe Antonio Elia, Daniel Hermida-Merino, Robert Hahn, Simone Raoux</i>
<p>The process of anion intercalation in graphite and its reversibility plays a
crucial role in the next generation energy-storage devices. Herein the reaction
mechanism of the aluminum graphite dual ion cell by operando X-ray scattering
from small angles to wide angles is investigated. The staging behavior of the
graphite intercalation compound (GIC) formation, its phase transitions, and its
reversible process are observed for the first time by directly measuring the
repeated intercalation distance, along with the microporosity of the cathode
graphite. The investigation demonstrates complete reversibility of the
electrochemical intercalation process, alongside nano- and micro-structural
reorganization of natural graphite induced by intercalation. This work
represents a new insight into thermodynamic aspects taking place during
intermediate phase transitions in the GIC formation.

<p>The critical current $I_c$ of single crystals of the iron pnictide
superconductor BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$, has been studied through
measurements of magnetic hysteresis cycles. We show that the introduction of
surface irregularities in the $\mu$m scale significantly increase $I_c$,
primarily near the irreversibility magnetic field $H_{irr}$, where the surface
currents are the main contribution to $I_c$. Such an increase is consistent
with a theoretical estimate for the maximum non-dissipative current that a
rough surface can sustain, based on Mathieu-Simon continuum theory for the
vortex state.

<h3>Apparent color and Raman vibrational modes of the unconventional  superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+δ}$ exfoliated flakes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12941" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12941</a>
<br>
<i>Ignacio Figueruelo-Campanero, Adolfo del Campo, Gladys Nieva, Elvira M. González, Aida Serrano, Mariela Menghini</i>
<p>Studying and controlling the properties of individual exfoliated materials is
one of the first steps towards the fabrication of complex van der Waals
systems. However, prolonged exposure to ambient conditions can affect the
properties of very thin exfoliated materials altering their physical
properties. For this reason, it is imperative to employ versatile
characterization strategies compatible with reduced ambient exposure times. In
this work, we demonstrate that optical microscopy and Raman spectroscopy are
quick and non-invasive techniques to study flakes of the high-temperature
superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO-2212). The apparent
color of BSCCO-2212 exfoliated flakes on SiO$_2$/Si has been studied allowing a
rough and fast identification of the number of layers. Moreover, we find that
thin flakes have a refractive index of around 1.7 in the visible range and 0.5
for the absorption coefficient near the maximum at 550 nm. We determine the
optimal combination of illumination wavelength and substrate properties for the
identification of different numbers of unit cells of BSCCO-2212. In addition,
we report the hardening of the characteristic Raman modes at 116 cm$^{-1}$ and
460 cm$^{-1}$ as flake thickness decreases, possibly due to strain in the BiO
and CuO$_2$ planes, respectively. Moreover, the evolution of the Raman modes
establishes a second approach to determine the thickness of BSCCO-2212 thin
flakes. As BSCCO-2212 is a challenging material to be due to its sensitivity to
ambient conditions deriving in an insulating state, the present work provides a
guide for the fabrication and characterization of complex van der Waals systems
paving the way for studying heterostructures based on unconventional
superconductors in the 2D limit.

<p>The ground-state phonon pressure is an analogue to the famous Casimir
pressure of vacuum produced by zero-point photons. The acoustic Casimir forces
are, however, many orders of magnitude weaker than the electromagnetic Casimir
forces, as the typical speed of sound is 100 000 times smaller than the speed
of light. Because of its weakness, zero-point acoustic Casimir pressure was
never observed, although the pressure of artificially introduced sound noise on
a narrow aperture has been reported. However, the magnitude of Casimir pressure
increases as $1/L^3$ with the decrease of the sample size $L$, and reaches
picoNewtons in the sub-micron scales. We demonstrate and measure the acoustic
Casimir pressure induced by zero-point phonons in solid helium adsorbed on a
carbon nanotube. We have also observed Casimir-like "pushing out" thermal
phonons with the decreasing temperature or the length. We also show that all
thermodynamic quantities are size-dependent, and therefore in the mesoscopic
range $L\lesssim\hbar{c}/(k_BT)$ quadruple points are possible on the phase
diagram where four different phases coexist. Due to the smallness of solid
helium sample, temperature of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of vacancies is
relatively high, $10-100$ mK. This allowed us to experimentally discover the
BEC in a system of zero-point vacancies, predicted more than 50 years ago.

<h3>Adiabatic gauge potential and integrability breaking with free fermions</h3>

<br>
<i>Balázs Pozsgay, Rustem Sharipov, Anastasiia Tiutiakina, István Vona</i>
<p>We revisit the problem of integrability breaking in free fermionic quantum
spin chains. We investigate the so-called adiabatic gauge potential (AGP),
which was recently proposed as an accurate probe of quantum chaos. We also
study the so-called weak integrability breaking, which occurs if the dynamical
effects of the perturbation do not appear at leading order in the perturbing
parameter. A recent statement in the literature claimed that integrability
breaking should generally lead to an exponential growth of the AGP norm with
respect to the volume. However, afterwards it was found that weak integrability
breaking is a counter-example, leading to a cross-over between polynomial and
exponential growth. Here we show that in free fermionic systems the AGP norm
always grows polynomially, if the perturbation is local with respect to the
fermions, even if the perturbation strongly breaks integrability. As a
by-product of our computations we also find, that in free fermionic spin chains
there are operators which weakly break integrability, but which are not
associated with known long range deformations.

<p>A new physics-based compact model, which makes it possible to simulate in a
unified way the neutron and proton of cosmic ray induced SEU cross sections,
including effects from nuclear reaction products and from direct ionization by
low-energy protons, has been proposed and vali-dated. The proposed approach is
analytical and based on explicit analytical relationships and approximations
with physics-based fitting parameters. GEANT4 or SRIM numerical calculations
can be used as an aid to adjust or refine the phenomenological parameters or
functions included in the model taking into account real geometrical
configurations and chemical compositions of the devices. In particular,
explicit energy dependencies of the soft error cross sections for protons and
neutrons over a wide range of nucleon energies were obtained and validated.
Main application areas of developed model include space physics, accelerator

<br>
<i>Thibaut Arnoulx de Pirey, Yariv Kafri, Sriram Ramaswamy</i>
<p>We show that an inclusion placed inside a dilute Stokesian suspension of
microswimmers induces power-law number-density modulations and flows. These
take a different form depending on whether the inclusion is held fixed by an
external force, for example an optical tweezer, or if it is free. When the
inclusion is held in place, the far-field fluid flow is a Stokeslet, while the
microswimmer density decays as $1/r^{2+\epsilon}$, with $r$ the distance from
the inclusion, and $\epsilon$ an anomalous exponent which depends on the
symmetry of the inclusion and varies continuously as a function of a
dimensionless number characterizing the relative amplitudes of the convective
and diffusive effects. The angular dependence takes a non-trivial form which
depends on the same dimensionless number. When the inclusion is free to move,
the far-field fluid flow is a stresslet and the microswimmer density decays as
$1/r^2$ with a simple angular dependence. These long-range modulations mediate
long-range interactions between inclusions that we characterize.

<i>Fabio E. Furcas, Shishir Mundra, Barbara Lothenbach, Camelia N. Borca, Thomas Huthwelker, Ueli M. Angst</i>
<p>Accurate model predictions of corrosion-driven damage in reinforced concrete
structures necessitate a comprehensive understanding of the rate of corrosion
product formation. Here, we investigate the influence of dissolved Si
characteristic of cementitious systems on the rate of corrosion product
transformation at alkaline pH. Compared to systems aged in the absence of Si,
small amounts of Si retard the formation rate of the thermodynamically stable
corrosion product goethite by a factor of 10. The estimated first order rate
constant of transformation k decreases exponentially as a function of the
dissolved Si concentration and follows the progression log10k = log10k_0 -
14.65[Si]^0.28. Findings further suggest that the observed retardation is
primarily due to the formation of a mobile aqueous Fe-Si complex. The
concentration of Si in cementitious systems has a crucial influence, and
additional research is required to fully incorporate this factor into reactive
transport models, ultimately essential for accurate service life predictions.

<p>In this study, we investigate excitonic properties of epitaxially grown WS2,
which is of particular interest for various applications due to its potential
for upscaling to wafer sized structures. Understanding the effect of the
dielectric environment due to changing layer numbers and multi-material
heterostructures on the optical properties is crucial for tailoring device
properties. Monochromated electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning
transmission electron microscope is employed to characterize the excitonic
spectrum of WS2 on graphene grown by metal organic chemical vapor deposition.
This technique provides the required spatial resolution at the nanometer scale
in combination with high quality spectra. To complement the experimental
results, theoretical investigations using density functional theory and
applying the Bethe-Salpeter equations are conducted. We find that by
transitioning from mono- to bi- to multilayers of WS2 the spectra show
redshifts for both, the K-valley excitons at about 2.0 and 2.4 eV as well as
excitonic features of higher energies. The latter features originate from so
called band nesting of transitions between the Gamma- and K-point. In summary,
this study provides valuable insights into the excitonic properties of WS2 in
different layer configurations and environments, which are realistically needed
for future device fabrication and property tuning. Finally, we can show that
nanometer scale electron spectroscopy supported by careful theoretical
modelling can successfully link atomic structure and optical properties, such
as exciton shifts, in non-idealized complex material systems like multilayer 2D
heterostructures.

<p>Precise algorithms capable of providing controlled solutions in the presence
of strong interactions are transforming the landscape of quantum many-body
physics. Particularly exciting breakthroughs are enabling the computation of
non-zero temperature correlation functions. However, computational challenges
arise due to constraints in resources and memory limitations, especially in
scenarios involving complex Green's functions and lattice effects. Leveraging
the principles of signal processing and data compression, this paper explores
the wavelet decomposition as a versatile and efficient method for obtaining
compact and resource-efficient representations of the many-body theory of
interacting systems. The effectiveness of the wavelet decomposition is
illustrated through its application to the representation of generalized
susceptibilities and self-energies in a prototypical interacting fermionic
system, namely the Hubbard model at half-filling in its atomic limit. These
results are the first proof-of-principle application of the wavelet compression
within the realm of many-body physics and demonstrate the potential of this
wavelet-based compression scheme for understanding the physics of correlated
electron systems.

<h3>Inverse design of spinodoid structures using Bayesian optimization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13054" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13054</a>
<br>
<i>Alexander Raßloff, Paul Seibert, Karl A. Kalina, Markus Kästner</i>
<p>Tailoring materials to achieve a desired behavior in specific applications is
of significant scientific and industrial interest as design of materials is a
key driver to innovation. Overcoming the rather slow and expertise-bound
traditional forward approaches of trial and error, inverse design is attracting
substantial attention. Targeting a property, the design model proposes a
candidate structure with the desired property. This concept can be particularly
well applied to the field of architected materials as their structures can be
directly tuned. The bone-like spinodoid materials are a specific class of
architected materials. They are of considerable interest thanks to their
non-periodicity, smoothness, and low-dimensional statistical description.
Previous work successfully employed machine learning (ML) models for inverse
design. The amount of data necessary for most ML approaches poses a severe
obstacle for broader application, especially in the context of inelasticity.
That is why we propose an inverse-design approach based on Bayesian
optimization to operate in the small-data regime. Necessitating substantially
less data, a small initial data set is iteratively augmented by in silico
generated data until a structure with the targeted properties is found. The
application to the inverse design of spinodoid structures of desired elastic
properties demonstrates the framework's potential for paving the way for
advance in inverse design.

<h3>How accurate are simulations and experiments for the lattice energies of  molecular crystals?</h3>

<br>
<i>Flaviano Della Pia, Andrea Zen, Dario Alfè, Angelos Michaelides</i>
<p>Molecular crystals play a central role in a wide range of scientific fields,
including pharmaceuticals and organic semiconductor devices. However, they are
challenging systems to model accurately with computational approaches because
of a delicate interplay of intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding
and van der Waals dispersion forces. Here, by exploiting recent algorithmic
developments, we report the first set of diffusion Monte Carlo lattice energies
for all 23 molecular crystals in the popular and widely used X23 dataset.
Comparisons with previous state-of-the-art lattice energy predictions (on a
subset of the dataset) and a careful analysis of experimental sublimation
enthalpies reveals that high-accuracy computational methods are now at least as
reliable as (computationally derived) experiments for the lattice energies of
molecular crystals. Overall, this work demonstrates the feasibility of
high-level explicitly correlated electronic structure methods for broad
benchmarking studies in complex condensed phase systems, and signposts a route
towards closer agreement between experiment and simulation.

<h3>Josephson Signatures of the Superconducting Higgs/Amplitude Mode</h3>

<br>
<i>Aritra Lahiri, Sang-Jun Choi, Björn Trauzettel</i>
<p>The Higgs/amplitude collective mode in superconductors corresponds to
oscillations of the amplitude of the order parameter. While its detection
typically relies on optical techniques with an external electromagnetic field
resonant with the Higgs mode, we present a purely transport-based setup wherein
it is excited in a voltage biased Josephson junction. Demonstrating the
importance of the order parameter dynamics, we find that in highly transparent
junctions featuring single-band s-wave superconductors, the interplay of the
Higgs resonance and the Josephson physics enhances the second harmonic
Josephson current oscillating at twice the Josephson frequency. If the leads
have unequal equilibrium superconducting gaps, this second harmonic component
may even eclipse its usual first harmonic counterpart, thus furnishing a unique
hallmark of the Higgs oscillations.

<h3>Are boron-nitride nanobelts capable to capture greenhouse gases?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13102" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13102</a>
<br>
<i>C. Aguiar, N. Dattani, I. Camps</i>
<p>Why is the question in the title pertinent? Toxic gases, which are
detrimental to both human health and the environment, have been released in
greater quantities as a result of industrial development. These gases
necessitate capture, immobilization, and measurement. Consequently, the present
study investigates the interactions between boron-nitride nanobelt and
M\"obius-type boron-nitride nanobelt and nine greenhouse gases, namely ammonia,
carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, methane, methanol, nitric
dioxide, nitric oxide, and phosgene. The adsorption energies calculated for the
structures with optimized geometry are all negative, suggesting that all gases
are adsorbed favorably in both nanobelts. Furthermore, we discovered that the
recovery time of the sensors ranges from two hours to a few nanoseconds, and
that the nanobelts exhibit distinct responses to each gas. According to
electronic and topological investigations, covalent bonds were exclusively
formed by nitric oxide; the remaining gases formed non-covalent bonds.
Molecular dynamics ultimately demonstrate that the interaction between a single
gas molecule and the nanobelt remains consistent across the vast majority of
gases, whereas the interaction between 500 gas molecules and the nanobelts
functions as an attraction, notwithstanding the impact of volumetric effects
characteristic of high volume gases on the interaction. For the completion of
each calculation, semiempirical tight-binding methods were implemented
utilizing the xTB software. The outcomes of our study generated a favorable
response to the inquiry posed in the title.

<h3>Magnetic transitions of biphenylene network layers induced by external  perturbations</h3>

<br>
<i>Sejoong Kim</i>
<p>We present a comprehensive investigation of the magnetic ordering in
biphenylene network (BPN) layers, employing density functional theory (DFT)
calculations under external perturbations, including uniaxial strains and hole
doping. We compute fully relaxed structures, energy bands, and magnetic states
by performing DFT calculations augmented with extended Hubbard interactions,
encompassing both on-site and inter-site interactions, to accurately capture
electron correlations. We emphasize the importance of the extended Hubbard
forces by contrasting BPN layers with and without the forces. Our results
reveal that in their fully relaxed structures, both BPN monolayer and bilayer
are non-magnetic. We exploit external perturbations to induce magnetic
ordering. The application of uniaxial strains induces magnetic phase
transitions, leading to ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic states in BPN
monolayer and bilayer, respectively. Additionally, we investigate hole doping
as an alternative mechanism for inducing magnetic transitions. Our findings
shed light on the tunability of magnetic properties in BPN layers through
external perturbations, demonstrating the promise of low-dimensional materials
in future spintronics and nanoelectronic applications.

<h3>Ultrafast lattice disordering can be accelerated by electronic  collisional forces</h3>

<p>In the prevalent picture of ultrafast structural phase transitions, the
atomic motion occurs in a slowly varying potential energy surface determined
adiabatically by the fast electrons. However, this ignores non-conservative
forces caused by electron-lattice collisions, which can significantly influence
atomic motion. Most ultrafast techniques only probe the average structure and
are less sensitive to random displacements, and therefore do not detect the
role played by non-conservative forces in phase transi- tions. Here we show
that the lattice dynamics of the prototypical insulator-to-metal transition of
VO2 cannot be described by a potential energy alone. We use the sample
temperature to control the preexisting lattice disorder before ultrafast
photoexcitation across the phase transition and our ultrafast diffuse
scattering experiments show that the fluctuations characteristic of the rutile
metal develop equally fast (120 fs) at ini- tial temperatures of 100 K and 300
K. This indicates that additional non-conservative forces are responsible for
the increased lattice disorder. These results highlight the need for more
sophisticated descriptions of ultrafast phenomena beyond the Born- Oppenheimer
approximation as well as ultrafast probes of spatial fluctuations beyond the
average unit cell measured by diffraction.

<h3>Disorder-Free Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models: Integrability and Quantum Chaos</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13154" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13154</a>
<br>
<i>Soshun Ozaki, Hosho Katsura</i>
<p>We introduce two disorder-free variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model,
demonstrate their integrability, and study their static and dynamical
properties. Unlike diagrammatic techniques, the integrability of these models
allows us to obtain dynamical correlation functions even when the number of
Majorana fermions is finite. From the solutions, we find that out-of-time-order
correlators (OTOCs) in these models exhibit exponential growth at early times,
resembling that of quantum chaotic systems such as those with disorder or
external kick terms. Conversely, our analysis shows no evidence of
random-matrix behavior in level statistics or the spectral form factor. Our
findings illustrate that the clean versions of the SYK models represent simple
but nontrivial examples of disorder-free quantum many-body systems displaying
chaos-like behavior of OTOCs.

<h3>Measurement-induced phase transitions by matrix product states scaling</h3>

<br>
<i>Guillaume Cecile, Hugo Lóio, Jacopo De Nardis</i>
<p>We study the time evolution of long quantum spin chains subjected to
continuous monitoring via matrix product states (MPS) at fixed bond dimension,
with the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) algorithm. The latter
gives an effective classical non-linear evolution with a conserved charge,
which approximates the real quantum evolution up to an error. We show that the
error rate displays a phase transition in the monitoring strength, which can be
well detected by scaling analysis with relatively low values of bond
dimensions. The method allows for an efficient numerical determination of the
critical measurement-induced phase transition parameters in many-body quantum
systems. Moreover, in the presence of U(1) global spin charge, we show the
existence of a charge-sharpening transition well separated from the
entanglement transition which we detect by studying the charge fluctuations of
a local sub-part of the system at very large times. Our work substantiates the
TDVP time evolution as a method to identify measured-induced phase transitions
in systems of arbitrary dimensions and sizes.

<h3>Nonadiabatic Dynamics of Molecules Interacting with Metal Surfaces: An  Approach Based on Langevin Dynamics and the Hierarchical Equations of Motion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13161" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13161</a>
<br>
<i>Samuel L. Rudge, Christoph Kaspar, Robin L. Grether, Steffen Wolf, Gerhard Stock, Michael Thoss</i>
<p>A novel mixed quantum-classical approach to simulating nonadiabatic dynamics
of molecules at metal surfaces is presented. The method combines the
numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion approach for the quantum
electronic degrees of freedom with Langevin dynamics for the classical degrees
of freedom, namely low-frequency vibrational modes within the molecule. The
approach extends previous mixed quantum-classical methods based on Langevin
equations to models containing strong electron-electron or quantum
electronic-vibrational interactions, while maintaining a nonperturbative and
non-Markovian treatment of the molecule-metal coupling. To demonstrate the
approach, nonequilibrium transport observables are calculated for a molecular
nanojunction containing strong interactions.

<h3>Nonequilibrium fluctuations of chemical reaction networks at  criticality: The Schlögl model as paradigmatic case</h3>

<br>
<i>Benedikt Remlein, Udo Seifert</i>
<p>Chemical reaction networks can undergo nonequilibrium phase transitions upon
variation of external control parameters like the chemical potential of a
species. We investigate the flux in the associated chemostats that is
proportional to the entropy production and its critical fluctuations within the
Schl\"ogl model. Numerical simulations show that the corresponding diffusion
coefficient diverges at the critical point as a function of system size. In the
vicinity of the critical point, the diffusion coefficient follows a scaling
form. We develop an analytical approach based on the chemical Langevin equation
and van Kampen's system size expansion that yields the corresponding exponents
in the monostable regime. In the bistable regime, we rely on a two-state
approximation in order to analytically describe the critical behavior.

<h3>Stark Effects of Rydberg Excitons in a Monolayer WSe2 P-N Junction</h3>

<br>
<i>Zhen Lian, Yun-Mei Li, Li Yan, Lei Ma, Dongxue Chen, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Chuanwei Zhang, Su-Fei Shi</i>
<p>The enhanced Coulomb interaction in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors leads
to the tightly bound electron-hole pairs known as excitons. The large binding
energy of excitons enables the formation of Rydberg excitons with high
principal quantum numbers (n), analogous to Rydberg atoms. Rydberg excitons
possess strong interactions among themselves, as well as sensitive responses to
external stimuli. Here, we probe Rydberg exciton resonances through
photocurrent spectroscopy in a monolayer WSe2 p-n junction formed by a
split-gate geometry. We show that an external in-plane electric field not only
induces a large Stark shift of Rydberg excitons up to quantum principal number
n=3 but also mixes different orbitals and brightens otherwise dark states such
as 3p and 3d. Our study provides an exciting platform for engineering Rydberg
excitons for new quantum states and quantum sensing.

<p>For continuous-time Markov chains and open unimolecular chemical reaction
networks, we prove that any two stationary currents are linearly related upon
perturbations of a single edge's transition rates, arbitrarily far from
equilibrium. We extend the result to non-stationary currents in the frequency
domain, provide and discuss an explicit expression for the current-current
susceptibility in terms of the network topology, and discuss possible
generalizations. In practical scenarios, the mutual linearity relation has
predictive power and can be used as a tool for inference or model
proof-testing.

<h3>Quantum Sensing of Antiferromagnetic Magnon Two-Mode Squeezed Vacuum</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13203" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13203</a>
<br>
<i>Anna-Luisa E. Römling, Akashdeep Kamra</i>
<p>N\'eel ordered antiferromagnets exhibit two-mode squeezing such that their
ground state is a nonclassical superposition of magnon Fock states. Here we
theoretically demonstrate that antiferromagnets can couple to spin qubits via
direct dispersive interaction stemming from, e.g., interfacial exchange. We
demonstrate that this kind of coupling induces a magnon number dependent level
splitting of the excited state resulting in multiple system excitation
energies. This series of level splittings manifests itself as nontrivial
excitation peaks in qubit spectroscopy thereby revealing the underlying
nonclassical magnon composition of the antiferromagnetic quantum state. By
appropriately choosing the drive or excitation energy, the magnonic state can
be controlled via the qubit, suggesting that Fock states of magnon pairs can be
generated deterministically. This enables achieving states useful for quantum
computing and quantum information science protocols.

<p>The unique optical properties of graphene, with broadband absorption and
ultrafast response, make it a critical component of optoelectronic and
spintronic devices. Using time-resolved momentum microscopy with high data rate
and high dynamic range, we report momentum-space measurements of electrons
promoted to the graphene conduction band with visible light, and their
subsequent relaxation. We observe a pronounced non-thermal distribution of
nascent photoexcited electrons with lattice pseudospin polarization in
remarkable agreement with results of simple tight-binding theory. By varying
the excitation fluence, we vary the relative importance of electron-electron
vs. electron-phonon scattering in the relaxation of the initial distribution.
Increasing the excitation fluence results in increased noncollinear
electron-electron scattering and reduced pseudospin polarization, although
up-scattered electrons retain a degree of polarization. These detailed
momentum-resolved electron dynamics in graphene demonstrate the capabilities of
high-performance time-resolved momentum microscopy in the study of 2D materials
and can inform the design of graphene devices.

<h3>Interaction-enhanced nesting in Spin-Fermion and Fermi-Hubbard models</h3>

<br>
<i>R. Rossi, F. Simkovic IV, M. Ferrero, A. Georges, A.M. Tsvelik, N.V. Prokof'ev, I.S. Tupitsyn</i>
<p>The spin-fermion (SF) model postulates that the dominant coupling between
low-energy fermions in near critical metals is mediated by collective spin
fluctuations (paramagnons) peaked at the N\'{e}el wave vector, ${\bf Q}_N$,
connecting hot spots on opposite sides of the Fermi surface. It has been argued
that strong correlations at hot spots lead to a Fermi surface deformation (FSD)
featuring flat regions and increased nesting. This conjecture was confirmed in
the perturbative self-consistent calculations when the paramagnon propagator
dependence on momentum deviation from ${\bf Q}_N$ is given by $\chi^{-1}
\propto |\Delta q|$. Using diagrammatic Monte Carlo (diagMC) technique we show
that such a dependence holds only at temperatures orders of magnitude smaller
than any other energy scale in the problem, indicating that a different
mechanism may be at play. Instead, we find that a $\chi^{-1} \propto |\Delta
q|^{2}$ dependence yields a robust finite-$T$ scenario for achieving FSD. To
link phenomenological and microscopic descriptions, we applied the connected
determinant diagMC method to the $(t-t')$ Hubbard model and found that in this
case: (i) the FSD is not very pronounced, and, instead, it is the lines of
zeros of the renormalized dispersion relation that deform towards nesting; (ii)
this phenomenon appears at large $U/t>5.5$ before the formation of electron and
hole pockets; (iii) the static spin susceptibility is well described by
$\chi^{-1} \propto |\Delta q|^{2}$. Flat FS regions yield a non-trivial
scenario for realizing a non-Fermi liquid state.

<h3>Quantized shift response in multi-gap topological phases</h3>

<br>
<i>Wojciech J. Jankowski, Robert-Jan Slager</i>
<p>We show that certain 3D multi-gap topological insulators can host quantized
shift photoconductivities due to bulk invariants that are defined under reality
conditions imposed by additional symmetries. We recast the quantization in
terms of the integrated torsion tensor and the non-Abelian Berry connection
constituting Chern-Simons forms. Physically, we recognize that the topological
quantization emerges purely from virtual transitions contributing to the
optical response. Our findings provide another quantized electromagnetic DC
response due to the non-trivial band topology, beyond the quantum anomalous
Hall effect of Chern insulators and quantized circular photogalvanic effect
found in Weyl semimetals.
