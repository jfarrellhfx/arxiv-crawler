<h3>Dynamical Freezing in Exactly Solvable Models of Driven Chaotic Quantum  Dots</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01627" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01627</a>
<br>
</p><i>Haoyu Guo, Rohit Mukherjee, Debanjan Chowdhury</i>
<p>The late-time equilibrium behavior of generic interacting models is
determined by the coupled hydrodynamic equations associated with the globally
conserved quantities. In the presence of an external time-dependent drive,
non-integrable systems typically thermalize to an effectively
infinite-temperature state, losing all memory of their initial states. However,
in the presence of a large time-periodic Floquet drive, there exist special
points in phase-space where the strongly interacting system develops
approximate {\it emergent} conservation laws. Here we present results for an
exactly solvable model of two coupled chaotic quantum dots with multiple
orbitals interacting via random two and four-fermion interactions in the
presence of a Floquet drive. We analyze the phenomenology of dynamically
generated freezing using a combination of exact diagonalization, and
field-theoretic analysis in the limit of a large number of electronic orbitals.
The model displays universal freezing behavior irrespective of whether the
theory is averaged over the disorder configurations or not. We present explicit
computations for the growth of many-body chaos and entanglement entropy, which
demonstrates the long-lived coherence associated with the interacting degrees
of freedom even at late-times at the dynamically frozen points. We also compute
the slow timescale that controls relaxation away from exact freezing in a
high-frequency expansion.

<h3>Added mass effect in coupled Brownian particles</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01696" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01696</a>
<br>
</p><i>Long Him Cheung, Christopher Jarzynski</i>
<p>The added mass effect is the contribution to a Brownian particle's effective
mass arising from the hydrodynamic flow its motion induces. For a spherical
particle in an incompressible fluid, the added mass is half the fluid's
displaced mass, but in a compressible fluid its value depends on a competition
between timescales. Here we illustrate this behavior with a solvable model of
two harmonically coupled Brownian particles of mass $m$, one representing the
sphere, the other the immediately surrounding fluid. The measured distribution
of the Brownian particle's velocity, $P(\bar{v})$, follows a Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution with an effective mass $m^*$. Solving analytically for $m^*$, we
find that its value is determined by three relevant timescales: the momentum
relaxation time, $t_p$, the harmonic oscillation period, $\tau$, and the
velocity measurement time resolution, $\Delta t$. In limiting cases $\Delta t
\ll \tau,t_p$ and $\tau\ll\Delta t\ll t_p$, our expression for $m^*$ reduces to
$m$ and $2m$, respectively. We find similar behavior upon generalizing the
model to the case of unequal masses.

<h3>Superconductivity of Bulk Abnormal Magic-stoichiometric Na3Cl Salt  Crystals at Normal Pressure</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01570" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01570</a>
<br>
</p><i>Shuqiang He, Yi-Feng Zheng, Guosheng Shi, Yi-Jie Xiang, Meihui Xiao, Qituan Zhang, Yue-Yu Zhang, Haiping Fang</i>
<p>The identification of new materials with superconducting properties is the
pursuit in the realm of superconductivity research. Here, excitedly, we show
that the simplest salt daily used can be made a superconductor at normal
pressure only by adjusting its stoichiometry of Na and Cl as Na3Cl at normal
pressure based on first-principles calculations. This bulk stable abnormal
Na-Cl stoichiometric crystal of 3:1, the first 'magic' ratio, includes metallic
(Na) atoms in the core as well as hybridization of ionic and metallic bonding,
facilitating the electron-phonon-coupling for superconductivity with a critical
temperature Tc of 0.13 K. The flat bands and van Hove singularities near the
Fermi level produce large densities of states, similar to H3S and LaH10, which
is beneficial for the emergence of superconductivity. The crystal composed of
with abnormal Na-Cl magic stoichiometry is a precisely tunable, purely sodium
and chloride-based, three-dimensional bulk superconductor, which is therefore
an ideal material for designing and understanding abnormal stoichiometric
crystals. The methodology of constructing this bulk abnormal crystal may be
general to almost all elements, which could lead to insights into the physics
of other conventional superconductors and even high-critical-temperature
superconductors.

<h3>Interacting quasiperiodic spin chains in the prethermal regime</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01622" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01622</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yi-Ting Tu, David M. Long, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<p>Recent progress in the study of many-body localization (MBL) in strongly
disordered interacting spin chains has emphasized the importance of
distinguishing finite time prethermal behavior from long time and large volume
asymptotics. We re-examine a reported non-ergodic extended (NEE) regime in
quasiperiodically disordered chains from this perspective, and propose that
this regime is a prethermal feature. Indeed, we argue that the NEE regime may
be identified through a change in the functional form of spin-spin
autocorrelation functions, demonstrating that the NEE regime is distinguishable
within intermediate-time dynamics. This is in contrast with existing
conjectures relating the NEE regime to the presence of an asymptotic mobility
edge in the single-particle spectrum. Thus, we propose a mechanism for the
formation of an NEE regime which does not rely on asymptotic properties of the
spin chain. Namely, we propose that the NEE regime emerges due to regularly
spaced deep wells in the disorder potential. The highly detuned sites suppress
spin transport across the system, effectively cutting the chain, and producing
a separation of time scales between the spreading of different operators. To
support this proposal, we show that the NEE phenomenology also occurs in random
models with deep wells but with no mobility edges, and does not occur in
quasiperiodic models with mobility edges but with no deep wells. Our results
support the broad conclusion that there is not a sharp distinction between the
dynamics of quasiperiodically and randomly disordered systems in the prethermal
regime. More specifically, we find that generic interacting quasiperiodic
models do not have stable intermediate dynamical phases arising from their
single-particle mobility edges, and that NEE phenomenology in such models is
transient.

<h3>Uniaxial stress effect on the electronic structure of quantum materials</h3>

</p><i>Na Hyun Jo, Elena Gati, Heike Pfau</i>
<p>Uniaxial stress has proven to be a powerful experimental tuning parameter for
effectively controlling lattice, charge, orbital, and spin degrees of freedom
in quantum materials. In addition, its ability to manipulate the symmetry of
materials has garnered significant attention. Recent technical progress to
combine uniaxial stress cells with quantum oscillation and angle-resolved
photoemission techniques allowed to study the electronic structure as function
of uniaxial stress. This review provides an overview on experimental
advancements in methods and examines studies on diverse quantum materials,
encompassing the semimetal WTe2, the unconventional superconductor Sr2RuO4,
Fe-based superconductors, and topological materials.

<h3>Universal non-Hermitian flow in one-dimensional PT-symmetric quantum  criticalities</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01640" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01640</a>
<br>
</p><i>Xin-Chi Zhou, Ke Wang</i>
<p>The critical point of a topological phase transition is described by a
conformal field theory (CFT), where the finite-size corrections to the ground
state energy are uniquely related to its central charge. We study the
finite-size scaling of the energy of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)
model with parity and time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. We find
that under open boundary condition (OBC), the energy scaling $E(L)\sim c/L$
reveals a negative central charge $c=-2$ at the non-Hermitian critical point,
indicative of a non-unitary CFT. Furthermore, we discover a universal scaling
function capturing the flow of a system from Dirac CFT with $c=1$ to a
non-unitary CFT with $c=-2$. The scaling function demonstrates distinct
behaviors at topologically non-trivial and trivial sides of critical points.
Notably, within the realm of topological criticality, the scaling function
exhibits an universal rise-dip-rise pattern, manifesting a characteristic
singularity inherent in the non-Hermitian topological critical points. The
analytic expression of the scaling function has been derived and is in good
agreement with the numerical results.

<h3>Spectral form factor in chaotic, localized, and integrable open quantum  many-body systems</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01641" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01641</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jiachen Li, Stephen Yan, Tomaž Prosen, Amos Chan</i>
<p>We numerically study the spectral statistics of open quantum many-body
systems (OQMBS) as signatures of quantum chaos (or the lack thereof), using the
dissipative spectral form factor (DSFF), a generalization of the spectral form
factor to complex spectra. We show that the DSFF of chaotic OQMBS generically
displays the $\textit{quadratic}$ ramp-plateau behaviour of the Ginibre
ensemble from random matrix theory, in contrast to the linear ramp-plateau
behaviour of the Gaussian ensemble in closed quantum systems. Furthermore, in
the presence of many-body interactions, such RMT behaviour emerges only after a
time scale $\tau_{\mathrm{dev}}$, which generally increases with system size
for sufficiently large system size, and can be identified as the non-Hermitian
analogue of the $\textit{many-body Thouless time}$. The universality of the
random matrix theory behavior is demonstrated by surveying twelve models of
OQMBS, including random Kraus circuits (quantum channels) and random
Lindbladians (Liouvillians) in several symmetry classes, as well as
Lindbladians of paradigmatic models such as the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK), XXZ,
and the transverse field Ising models. We devise an unfolding and filtering
procedure to remove variations of the averaged density of states which would
otherwise hide the universal RMT-like signatures in the DSFF for chaotic OQMBS.
Beyond chaotic OQMBS, we study the spectral statistics of non-chaotic OQMBS,
specifically the integrable XX model and a system in the many-body localized
(MBL) regime in the presence of dissipation, which exhibit DSFF behaviours
distinct from the ramp-plateau behaviour of random matrix theory. Lastly, we
study the DSFF of Lindbladians with the Hamiltonian term set to zero, i.e. only
the jump operators are present, and demonstrate that the results of RMT
universality and scaling of many-body Thouless time survive even without
coherent evolution.

<h3>Floquet engineered inhomogeneous quantum chaos in critical systems</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Bastien Lapierre, Tokiro Numasawa, Titus Neupert, Shinsei Ryu</i>
<p>We study universal chaotic dynamics of a large class of periodically driven
critical systems described by spatially inhomogeneous conformal field theories.
By employing an effective curved spacetime approach, we show that the onset of
quantum chaotic correlations, captured by the Lyapunov exponent of
out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), is set by the Hawking temperature of
emergent Floquet horizons. Furthermore, scrambling of quantum information is
shown to be strongly inhomogeneous, leading to transitions from chaotic to
non-chaotic regimes by tuning driving parameters. We finally use our framework
to propose a concrete protocol to simulate and measure OTOCs in quantum
simulators, by designing an efficient stroboscopic backward time evolution.

<h3>Polarons in the Cubic Generalized Fröhlich Model: Spontaneous Symmetry  Breaking</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01653" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01653</a>
<br>
</p><i>Vasilii Vasilchenko, Xavier Gonze</i>
<p>Within the variational polaron equation framework, the Fr\"ohlich model for
cubic systems with three-fold degenerate electronic bands is numerically solved
in the strong coupling regime, for a wide range of its input parameters. By
comparing the results to the previously reported ones obtained with the
Gaussian Ansatz approach, the inadequacy of the latter is uncovered, especially
when degenerate bands are present in a system. Moreover, the symmetry groups of
polaronic solutions in the cubic generalized Fr\"ohlich model without
spin-orbit coupling are investigated: we provide and discuss a phase diagram of
symmetry groups of ground-state polarons, showing spontaneous symmetry
breaking. While the cubic symmetry of the three-band degenerate model
Hamiltonian corresponds to the full octahedral group $O_h$, lowest-energy
polarons possess either $D_{4h}$ or $D_{3d}$ point groups. This phase diagram
bears some similarities but differs nevertheless from the one that is obtained
by the straight analysis of the band effective masses. The obtained results
will provide a firm ground for further exploration of the generalized
Fr\"ohlich model and will likely be applicable beyond the model's inherent
approximations.

<h3>Ferromagnetic resonance response in square artificial spin ice: roles of  geometry in vertex dynamics and magnetic configurations</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01720" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01720</a>

</p><i>G. A. Gomez-Iriarte, D. E. Gonzalez-Chavez, R. L. Sommer, J. P. Sinnecker</i>
<p>Artificial spin ice (ASI) represents a class of uniquely structured
superlattices comprising geometrically arranged interacting nanomagnets. This
arrangement facilitates the exploration of magnetic frustration phenomena and
related spin wave dynamics, contributing to the field of magnonics. In this
work, we present a compressive study of spin wave dynamics in square ASI
lattices using micromagnetic simulations, explicitly focusing on ferromagnetic
resonance (FMR) and oscillation modes. We investigate how variations in the
aspect ratio of nanomagnets dimensions influence magnetic excitations in both
saturated and remanent states. We analyze the frequency variations of FMR peaks
corresponding to edges and bulk oscillation modes in relation to both magnetic
configuration and nanomagnets dimensions. We emphasize the remanent state of
square ASI vertex configurations, particularly focusing on their characteristic
energy states (Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV), while detailing how
symmetries influence oscillation modes. We observe distinct FMR responses
originating from vertices, exhibiting unique characteristics for each energy
state. Our results offer a potential method of utilizing the FMR technique to
identify energy states in ASI systems.

<h3>Theory of nonlinear terahertz susceptibility in ferroelectrics</h3>

<p>An analytical theory is developed for predicting the nonlinear susceptibility
of ionic polarization to continuous electromagnetic waves in both bulk and
strained thin film ferroelectrics. Using a perturbation method for solving the
nonlinear equation of motion for ionic polarization within the framework of
Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory, the full second-order nonlinear
susceptibility tensor is derived as a function of frequency, temperature, and
strain. The theory predicts the coexistence of a significantly enhanced
second-order dielectric susceptibility and a relatively low dielectric loss in
BaTiO3 films with a strain-stabilized monoclinic ferroelectric phase and in a
strained SrTiO3 film near its temperature-driven second-order
ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition. This work establishes a
theoretical framework for predicting and exploiting nonlinear interactions
between THz waves and ferroelectric materials, and more generally, suggests
exciting opportunities to strain-engineer nonlinear dynamical properties of
ferroelectrics beyond the static and quasi-static limits.

<h3>Large anomalous Nernst effect in the ferromagnetic Fe3Si polycrystal</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01800" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01800</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yangming Wang, Susumu Minami, Akito Sakai, Taishi Chen, Zili Feng, Daisuke Nishio-Hamane, Satoru Nakatsuji</i>
<p>The high-throughput calculation predicts that the Fe-based cubic ferromagnet
Fe$_3$Si may exhibit a large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE). Here, we report our
experimental observation of the large Nernst coefficient $S_{yx}\sim$2 $\mu$V/K
and the transverse thermoelectric coefficient $-\alpha_{yx}$ $\sim$ 3
Am$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ for Fe$_3$Si polycrystal at room temperature. The large
$-\alpha_{yx}$ indicates that the large ANE originates from the intrinsic Berry
curvature mechanism. The high Curie temperature of 840 K and the most abundant
raw elements of Fe and Si make Fe$_3$Si a competitive candidate for Nernst
thermoelectric generations.

<h3>Strategy for Direct Detection of Chiral Phonons with Phase-Structured  Free Electrons</h3>

</p><i>Marc R. Bourgeois, Andrew W. Rossi, David J. Masiello</i>
<p>Chiral phonons possessing valley pseudo angular momentum (PAM) underlie a
diversity of quantum phenomena of fundamental and applied importance, but are
challenging to probe directly. We show that deficiencies of typical
momentum-resolved electron energy loss measurements that make it impossible to
distinguish the PAM of chiral phonons can be overcome by introducing pinwheel
free electron states with well-defined PAM. Transitions between such states
generate 2D periodic arrays of in-plane field vortices with polarization
textures tailored to selectively couple to desired chiral mode symmetries.

<h3>Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in a semimetal</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01829" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01829</a>
<br>
</p><i>Wenqi Yang, Dawei Zhai, Feng-Ren Fan, Wang Yao</i>
<p>In the search of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effects, the
conventional wisdom is to start from a flat Chern band isolated from the rest
of the Hilbert space by bandgap, so that many-body interaction can be projected
to a landscape that mimics a Landau level. Here we report the finding of FQAH
in a 2D semimetal. Described by a 2{\pi}-flux dice lattice, the model features
a flat band in touching with a dispersive lower band, where the band touching
is symmetry-protected from being gapped by electron interaction. At 1/3 and 2/3
filling of the gapless flat band, FQAH phases are found using density matrix
renormalisation group calculations taking into accounts all bands. Symmetry
breaking to gap the band touching can turn the semimetal into a Chern insulator
while keeping the Chern band nearly flat, but counter-intuitively this
suppresses the FQAH, as the gap opening introduces strong inhomogeneity to the
quantum geometry. We show an optical scheme to realize the 2{\pi}-flux dice
lattice for cold atoms. Our finding uncovers a new arena for the exploration of
fractional quantum Hall physics in addition to the Landau levels and Chern
insulators.

<h3>Theoretical studies on off-axis phase diagrams and Knight shifts in  UTe$_2$ -- Tetra-critical point, d-vector rotation, and multiple phases</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01831" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01831</a>
<br>
</p><i>Kazushige Machida</i>
<p>Inspired by recent remarkable sets of experiments on UTe$_2$: discoveries of
the fourth horizontal internal transition line running toward a tetra-critical
point (TCP) at $H$=15T, the off-axis high field phases, and abnormally large
Knight shift (KS) drop below $T_{\rm c}$ for $H$$\parallel$$a$-magnetic easy
axis, we advance further our theoretical work on the field ($H$)-temperature
($T$) phase diagram for $H$$\parallel$$b$-magnetic hard axis which contains a
positive sloped $H_{\rm c2}$ departing from TCP. A nonunitary spin-triplet
pairing with three components explains these experimental facts simultaneously
and consistently by assuming that the underlying normal electron system with a
narrow bandwidth characteristic to the Kondo temperature $\sim$60K
unsurprisingly breaks the particle-hole symmetry. This causes a special
invariant term in Ginzburg-Landau (GL) free energy functional which couples
directly with the 5f magnetic system, giving rise to the $T_{\rm c}$ splitting
and ultimately to the positive sloped $H_{\rm c2}$ and the horizontal internal
transition line connected to TCP. The large KS drop can be understood in terms
of this GL invariance whose coefficient is negative and leads to a diamagnetic
response where the Cooper pair spin is antiparallel to the applied field
direction. The present scenario also accounts for the observed d-vector
rotation phenomena and off-axis phase diagrams with extremely high $H_{\rm
c2}$$\gtrsim$70T found at angles in between the $b$ and $c$-axes and between
the $bc$ plane and $a$-axis, making UTe$_2$ a fertile playground for a
topological superconductor.

<h3>Strategies for enhancing spin-shuttling fidelities in Si/SiGe quantum  wells with random-alloy disorder</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Merritt P. Losert, Max Oberländer, Julian D. Teske, Mats Volmer, Lars R. Schreiber, Hendrik Bluhm, S. N. Coppersmith, Mark Friesen</i>
<p>Coherent coupling between distant qubits is needed for any scalable quantum
computing scheme. In quantum dot systems, one proposal for long-distance
coupling is to coherently transfer electron spins across a chip in a moving
potential. Here, we use simulations to study challenges for spin shuttling in
Si/SiGe heterostructures caused by the valley degree of freedom. We show that
for devices with valley splitting dominated by alloy disorder, one can expect
to encounter pockets of low valley splitting, given a long-enough shuttling
path. At such locations, inter-valley tunneling leads to dephasing of the spin
wavefunction, substantially reducing the shuttling fidelity. We show how to
mitigate this problem by modifying the heterostructure composition, or by
varying the vertical electric field, the shuttling velocity, the shape and size
of the dot, or the shuttling path. We further show that combinations of these
strategies can reduce the shuttling infidelity by several orders of magnitude,
putting shuttling fidelities sufficient for error correction within reach.

<p>Studying antiferromagnetic domains is essential for fundamental physics and
potential spintronics applications. Despite its importance, few systematic
studies have been performed on van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnets (AFMs)
domains with high spatial resolutions, and direct probing of the N\`eel vectors
remains challenging. In this work, we found a multidomain in vdW AFM NiPS3, a
material extensively investigated for its exotic magnetic exciton. We employed
photoemission electron microscopy combined with the X-ray magnetic linear
dichroism (XMLD-PEEM) to image the NiPS3's magnetic structure. The
nanometer-spatial resolution of XMLD-PEEM allows us to determine local N\`eel
vector orientations and discover thermally fluctuating N\'eel vectors that are
independent of the crystal symmetry even at 65 K, well below TN of 155 K. We
demonstrate a Ni ions' small in-plane orbital moment anisotropy is responsible
for the weak magneto-crystalline anisotropy. The observed multidomain's thermal
fluctuations may explain the broadening of magnetic exciton peaks at higher
temperatures.

<h3>Origin of low specific heat and possible self-heating in field-cooled  Sn-Pb solders</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01850" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01850</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yoshikazu Mizuguchi, Takumi Murakami, Md. Riad Kasem, Hiroto Arima</i>
<p>Magnetic flux trapping in field-cooled (FC) Sn-Pb solders has been recently
studied because of the observation of nonvolatile magneto-thermal switching [H.
Arima et al., Commun. Mater. 5, 34 (2024)] and anomalous magnetic
field-temperature (H-T) phase diagrams [T. Murakami et al., AIP Adv. 13, 125008
(2023)]. In this paper, we investigate the origin of the anomalously low
specific heat (C) in Sn10-Pb90 and Sn45-Pb55 solders after FC at H = 1500 Oe.
We show that the FC solders exhibit self-heating possibly caused by the flux
flow during the reduction of trapped fluxes when heating the sample during the
C measurements. The T dependence of T rise clearly exhibits unexpectedly large
values when the low-C states are observed. In addition, the cause of the
transition-like behavior in C-T of FC solders are explained by local heating
during H control and flux-jump phenomena.

<h3>Spectral Features of the Fourth Order Irreducible Correlations in a  Monolayer Semiconductor</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01853" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01853</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jiacheng Tang, Cun-Zheng Ning</i>
<p>Understanding high-order correlations or multi-particle entities in a
many-body system is not only of fundamental importance in condensed matter
physics, but also critical for many technological applications. So far,
higher-order multi-particle irreducible correlations in semiconductors have not
been studied beyond the second-order or two-particle case. In this paper, we
study the correlation of two electrons and two holes (2e2h) using the four-body
Bethe-Salpeter equation (4B-BSE) and applied to the calculation of the
helicity-resolved absorption between the two-body and four-body states for a
monolayer MoTe2. Surprisingly, we found a rich series of spectral peaks within
an energy span of ~40 meV below the exciton that has not been seen before. To
understand the origin of the new spectral peaks, the Feynman diagrams of the 4B
BSE are recast into the cluster expansion formalism, allowing us to study the
individual effects of selected clusters or correlations of various orders. We
found that the irreducible clusters of orders up to the 3rd and their
factorized combinations cannot explain the spectral features. Importantly, we
found that the 4th order irreducible correlation is necessary and sufficient to
explain the new features. The 4th order irreducible correlation corresponds to
a four-particle irreducible cluster involving two electrons and two holes,
alternatively called quadron or quadruplon. The new 4th order correlation or

<h3>Many-Body Configurational Spectral Splitting between Trion and Charged  Exciton in a Monolayer Semiconductor</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01862" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01862</a>

</p><i>Jiacheng Tang, Cun-Zheng Ning</i>
<p>Many-body electron-hole complexes in a semiconductor are important both from
a fundamental physics point of view and for practical device applications. A
three-body system of electrons (e) and holes (h) (2e1h, or 1e2h) in a two-band
semiconductor is commonly believed to be associated with two spectral peaks for
the exciton and trion (or charged exciton), respectively. But both the validity
of this understanding and the physical meaning of a trion or charged exciton
have not been thoroughly examined. From the physics point of view, there are
two different configurations, (e)(eh) or (eeh), which could be considered
charged exciton and trion, respectively. Here (...) represents an irreducible
cluster with respect to Coulomb interactions. In this paper, we consider these
issues related to the 2e1h three-body problem theoretically and experimentally
using monolayer MoTe2 as an example. Our theoretical tools involve the
three-body Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) and the cluster expansion technique,
especially their correspondence. Experimentally, we measure the
photoluminescence spectrum on a gate-controlled monolayer MoTe2. We found two
spectral peaks that are 21 and 4 meV, respectively, below the exciton peak, in
contrast to the single "trion" peak from the conventional understanding. We
show that, while the three-body BSE in a two-band model can reproduce all
spectral features, the cluster-expansion technique shows that the two peaks
correspond to the charged exciton (e)(eh) and trion (eeh), respectively. In
other words, there is a spectral splitting due to the two different many-body
configurations. Furthermore, we find that the trion only exists in the
intervalley case, while the charged exciton exists both for the intervalley and
intravalley cases.

<h3>Aubry transition with small distortions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01878" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01878</a>
<br>
</p><i>O. Cépas, P. Quémerais</i>
<p>We show that when the Aubry transition occurs in incommensurately distorted
structures, the amplitude of the distortions is not necessarily large as
suggested by the standard Frenkel-Kontorova mechanical model. By modifying the
shape of the potential in such a way that the mechanical force is locally
stronger (i.e. increasing the nonlinearities), the transition may occur at a
small amplitude of the potential with small distortions. A ``phason'' gap then
opens, while the phonon spectrum resembles a standard undistorted spectrum at
higher energies. This may explain the existence of pinned phases with small
distortions as experimentally observed in charge-density waves.

<p>For a number of mixtures of rate gases at high pressures, sound speed minima
are experimentally observed depending on the concentration. This behavior has
not yet been explained. We have studied the behavior of a mixture of argon and
helium using computer simulation. Sound speed minima have been discovered at a
certain concentration, which is in good agreement with experimental data. It is
shown that this behavior is due to the fact that the P and T parameters for gas
mixtures are near the Frenkel line, separating the states of "rigid" and
quasi-gas fluid.

<h3>Fluctuation induced piezomagnetism in local moment altermagnets</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Kostiantyn V. Yershov, Volodymyr P. Kravchuk, Maria Daghofer, Jeroen van den Brink</i>
<p>It was recently discovered that, depending on their symmetries, collinear
antiferromagnets may break spin degeneracy in momentum space, even in absence
of spin-orbit coupling. Such systems, dubbed altermagnets, have electronic
bands with a spin-momentum texture set mainly by the combined crystal-magnetic
symmetry. This discovery motivates the question which novel physical properties
derive from altermagnetic order. Here we show that one consequence of
altermagnetic order is a fluctuation-driven piezomagnetic response. Using the
checkerboard Heisenberg hamiltonian as a prototypical localized moment
altermagnet, we determine its fluctuation induced piezomagnetic coefficient
considering temperature induced transversal spin fluctuations. We establish in
addition that magnetic fluctuations induce an anisotropic thermal spin
conductivity.

<h3>Multiple Topological Phase Transitions Unveiling Gapless Topological  Superconductivity in Magnet/Unconventional Superconductor Hybrid Platform</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01914" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01914</a>
<br>
</p><i>Minakshi Subhadarshini, Amartya Pal, Pritam Chatterjee, Arijit Saha</i>
<p>We propose a theoretical framework for generating gapless topological
superconductivity (GTSC) hosting Majorana flat edge modes (MFEMs) in the
presence of a two-dimensional (2D) array of magnetic adatoms with noncollinear
spin texture deposited on top of a unconventional superconductor. Our
observations reveal two distinct topological phase transitions within the
emergent Shiba band depending on the exchange coupling strength ($J$) between
magnetic adatom spins and superconducting electrons: the first one designates
transition from gapless non-topological to gapless topological phase at lower
$J$, while the second one denotes transition from gapless topological to a
trivial gapped superconducting phase at higher $J$. The gapless topological
superconducting phase survives at intermediate values of $J$, hosting MFEMs.
Further, we investigate the nature of the bulk effective pairings which
indicate that GTSC appears due to the interplay between pseudo "$s$-wave" and
pseudo "$p_{x}+p_y$" types of pairing. Consequently, our study opens a
promising avenue for the experimental realization of GTSC in 2D Shiba lattice
based on $d$-wave superconductors as a high-temperature platform.

<h3>Giant effective $g$-factor due to spin bifurcations in polariton  condensates</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01941" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01941</a>
<br>
</p><i>A. Bochin, I. Chestnov, A. Nalitov</i>
<p>We predict giant susceptibility of spin-bifurcating polariton condensates to
externally applied permanent magnetic field. In the presence of
spin-anisotropic polariton-polariton interactions, the condensate spontaneously
takes an elliptically polarised state, {whose perturbation dynamics can be
interpreted in terms of the presence of strong effective magnetic field}
significantly surpassing the external one. Surprisingly, this behaviour of the
addressed strongly out-of-equilibrium system in the vicinity of a critical
point exhibits intriguing analogy with the second-order phase transition. The
predicted field-enhancement effect can be utilized for creation of
topologically nontrivial states of Bogoliubov's excitations existing on top of
the polariton condensate.

<h3>Enhancement of swimmer diffusion through regular kicks: analytic mapping  of a scale independent parameter space</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Arnau Jurado Romero, Carles Calero, Rossend Rey</i>
<p>Depending on their mechanism of self-propulsion, active particles can exhibit
a time-dependent, often periodic, propulsion velocity. The precise propulsion
velocity profile determines their mean square displacement and their effective
diffusion coefficient at long times. Here we demonstrate that any periodic
propulsion profile results in a larger diffusion coefficient than the
corresponding case with constant propulsion velocity. We investigate in detail
the case of periodic exponentially decaying velocity pulses, expected in
propulsion mechanisms based on sudden absorption of finite amounts of energy.
We show both analytically and with numerical simulations that in these cases
the effective diffusion coefficient can be arbitrarily enhanced with respect to
the case with constant velocity equal to the average speed. Our results may
help interpret in a new light observations on the diffusion enhancement of
active particles.

<h3>Proliferation-driven mechanical feedback regulates cell dynamics in  growing tissues</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01960" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01960</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sumit Sinha, Xin Li, Abdul N Malmi-Kakkada, D. Thirumalai</i>
<p>Local stresses in a tissue, a collective property, regulate cell division and
apoptosis. In turn, cell growth and division induce active stresses in the
tissue. As a consequence, there is a feedback between cell growth and local
stresses. However, how the cell dynamics depend on local stress-dependent cell
division and the feedback strength is not fully understood. Here, we probe the
consequences of stress-mediated growth and cell division on cell dynamics using
agent-based simulations of a two-dimensional growing tissue. We discover a rich
dynamical behavior of individual cells, ranging from jamming (mean square
displacement, $\Delta (t) \sim t^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha$ less than unity), to
hyperdiffusion ($\alpha > 2$) depending on cell division rate and the strength
of the mechanical feedback. Strikingly, $\Delta (t)$ is determined by the
tissue growth law, which quantifies cell proliferation (number of cells $N(t)$
as a function of time). The growth law ($N(t) \sim t^{\lambda}$ at long times)
is regulated by the critical pressure that controls the strength of the
mechanical feedback and the ratio between cell division-apoptosis rates. We
show that $\lambda \sim \alpha$, which implies that higher growth rate leads to
a greater degree of cell migration. The variations in cell motility are linked
to the emergence of highly persistent forces extending over several cell cycle
times. Our predictions are testable using cell-tracking imaging techniques.

<h3>All optical control of bubble and skyrmion breathing</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Tim Titze, Timo Schmidt, Manfred Albrecht, Stefan Mathias, Daniel Steil</i>
<p>Controlling the dynamics of topologically protected spin objects by all
optical means promises enormous potential for future spintronic applications.
Excitation of bubbles and skyrmions in ferrimagnetic [Fe(0.35 nm)/Gd(0.40
nm)]$_{160}$ multilayers by ultrashort laser pulses leads to a periodic
modulation of the core diameter of these spin objects, the so-called breathing
mode. We demonstrate versatile amplitude and phase control of this breathing
using a double excitation scheme, where the observed dynamics is controlled by
the excitation delay. We gain insight into both the time scale on which the
breathing mode is launched and the role of the spin object size on the
dynamics. Our results demonstrate that ultrafast optical excitation allows for
precise tuning of the spin dynamics of trivial and non-trivial spin objects,
showing a possible control strategy in device applications.

<h3>Smoothly vanishing density in the contact process by an interplay of  disorder and long-distance dispersal</h3>

<br>
</p><i>R. Juhász, I. A. Kovács</i>
<p>Realistic modeling of ecological population dynamics requires spatially
explicit descriptions that can take into account spatial heterogeneity as well
as long-distance dispersal. Here, we present Monte Carlo simulations and
numerical renormalization group results for the paradigmatic model, the contact
process, in the combined presence of these factors in both one and
two-dimensional systems. Our results confirm our analytic arguments stating
that the density vanishes smoothly at the extinction threshold, in a way
characteristic of infinite-order transitions. This extremely smooth vanishing
of the global density entails an enhanced exposure of the population to
extinction events. At the same time, a reverse order parameter, the local
persistence displays a discontinuity characteristic of mixed-order transitions,
as it approaches a non-universal critical value algebraically with an exponent
$\beta_p'<1$.

<h3>A proximitized quantum dot in germanium</h3>

<p>Planar germanium quantum wells have recently been shown to host a hard-gapped
superconductor-semiconductor interface. Additionally, quantum dot spin qubits
in germanium are well-suited for quantum information processing, with isotopic
purification to a nuclear spin-free material expected to yield long coherence
times. Therefore, as one of the few group IV materials with the potential to
host superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices, proximitized quantum dots in
germanium are a crucial ingredient towards topological superconductivity and
novel qubit modalities. Here we demonstrate a quantum dot (QD) in a Ge/SiGe
heterostructure proximitized by a platinum germanosilicide (PtGeSi)
superconducting lead (SC), forming a SC-QD-SC junction. We show tunability of
the QD-SC coupling strength, as well as gate control of the ratio of charging
energy and the induced gap. We further exploit this tunability by exhibiting
control of the ground state of the system between even and odd parity.
Furthermore, we characterize the critical magnetic field strengths, finding a
robust critical out-of-plane field of 0.91(5) T. Finally we explore sub-gap
spin splitting in the device, observing rich physics in the resulting spectra,
that we model using a zero-bandwidth model in the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov limit. The
demonstration of controllable proximitization at the nanoscale of a germanium
quantum dot opens up the physics of novel spin and superconducting qubits, and
Josephson junction arrays in a group IV material.

<p>Spin waves, the fundamental excitations in magnetic materials, are promising
candidates for realizing low-dissipation information processing in spintronics.
The ability to visualize and manipulate coherent spin-wave transport is crucial
for the development of spin wave-based devices. We use a recently discovered
method utilizing nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, point defects in the diamond
lattice, to measure spin waves in thin film magnetic insulators by detecting
their magnetic stray field. We experimentally demonstrate enhanced contrast in
the detected wavefront amplitudes by imaging spin waves underneath a reference
stripline and phenomenologically model the results. By extracting the spin wave
dispersion and comparing NV center based spin wave measurements to spin wave
imaging conducted through the well-established time-resolved magneto-optical
Kerr effect, we discuss the advantages and limitations of employing NV centers
as spin wave sensors.

</p><i>Alex Shaji, Kevin J. Rietwyk, Islay O. Robertson, Philipp Reineck, David A. Broadway, Jean-Philippe Tetienne</i>
<p>Magnetic imaging based on ensembles of diamond nitrogen-vacancy quantum
sensors has emerged as a useful technique for the spatial characterisation of
magnetic materials and current distributions. However, demonstrations have so
far been restricted to laboratory-based experiments using relatively bulky
apparatus and requiring manual handling of the diamond sensing element,
hampering broader adoption of the technique. Here we present a simple, compact
device that can be deployed outside a laboratory environment and enables
robust, simplified operation. It relies on a specially designed sensor head
that directly integrates the diamond sensor while incorporating a microwave
antenna and all necessary optical components. This integrated sensor head is
complemented by a small control unit and a laptop computer that displays the
resulting magnetic image. We test the device by imaging a magnetic sample,
demonstrating a spatial resolution of 4 $\mu$m over a field of view exceeding 1
mm, and a best sensitivity of 45 $\mu$T/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ per ($5\,\mu$m)$^2$
pixel. Our portable magnetic imaging instrument may find use in situations
where taking the sample to be measured to a specialist lab is impractical or
undesirable.

<p>In this paper, we theoretically investigate the many-body localization
properties of one-dimensional Ising spin-1 chains by using the methods of exact
matrix diagonalization. We compare it with the MBL properties of the Ising
spin-1/2 chains. The results indicate that the one-dimensional Ising spin-1
chains can also undergo MBL phase transition. There are various forms of
disorder, and we compare the effects of different forms of quasi-disorder and
random disorder on many-body localization in this paper. First, we calculate
the exctied-state fidelity to study the MBL phase transtion. By changing the
form of the quasi-disorder, we study the MBL transition of the system with
different forms of quasi-disorder and compare them with those of the random
disordered system. The results show that both random disorder and
quasi-disorder can cause the MBL phase transition in the one-dimensional Ising
spin-1 chains. In order to study the effect of spin interactions, we compare
Ising spin-1 chains and spin-1/2 chains with the next-nearest-neighbour(N-N)
two-body interactions and the next-next-nearest-neighbour (N-N-N)interactions.
The results show that the critical point increases with the addition of the
interaction. Then we study the dynamical properties of the model by the
dynamical behavior of diagonal entropy (DE), local magnetization and the time
evolution of fidelity to further prove the occurrence of MBL phase transition
in the disordered Ising spin-1 chains with the (N-N) coupling term and
distinguish the ergodic phase (thermal phase) and the many-body localized
phase. Lastly, we delve into the impact of periodic driving on one-dimensional
Ising spin-1 chains. And we compare it with the results obtained from the Ising
spin-1/2 chains. It shows that periodic driving can cause Ising spin-1 chains
and Ising spin-1/2 chains to occur the MBL transition.

<p>Hybrid quantum devices enable novel functionalities by combining the benefits
of different subsystems. Particularly, point defects in nanomechanical
resonators made of diamond or silicon carbide (SiC) have been proposed for
precise magnetic field sensing and as versatile quantum transducers. However,
the realization of a hybrid system may involve tradeoffs in the performance of
the constituent subsystems. In a spin-mechanical system, the mechanical
properties of the resonator may suffer from the presence of engineered defects
in the crystal lattice. This may severely restrict the performance of the
resulting device and needs to be carefully explored. Here, we focus on the
impact of defects on high Q nanomechanical string resonators made of
pre-stressed 3C-SiC grown on Si(111). We use helium ion implantation to create
point defects and study their accumulated effect on the mechanical performance.
Using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, we present a method to determine Young's
modulus and the pre-stress of the strings. We find that Young's modulus is not
modified by implantation. Under implantation doses relevant for single defect
or defect ensemble generation, both tensile stress and damping rate also remain
unaltered. For higher implantation dose, both exhibit a characteristic change.

<p>Materials that transition between metal and insulator, the two opposing
states that distinguish all solids, are fascinating because they underlie many
mysteries in the physics of the solid state. In 1T-TaS$_{2}$, the
metal-insulator transition is linked to a series of metastable states of a
chiral charge density wave whose basic nature is still an open question. In
this work, we show that pulses of current through these materials create
current-carrying boundary channels that distinguish the metallic and insulating
states. We demonstrate electrical control of these channels' properties,
suggesting their formation could be due to the complex interplay of the
formation of domain walls and the viscous flow of electrons. Our findings show
that physical boundaries play a key role in the properties of the metastable
states of the metal-insulator transition, highlighting new possibilities for
in-situ electrical design and active manipulation of electrical components.

<p>A new method for dark field imaging is introduced which uses scanned electron
diffraction (or 4DSTEM - 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron
microscopy datasets) as its input. Instead of working on simple summation of
intensity, it works on a sparse representation of the diffraction patterns in
terms of a list of their diffraction peaks. This is tested on a thin perovskite
film containing structural ordering resulting in additional superlattice spots
that reveal details of domain structures, and is shown to give much better
selectivity and contrast than conventional virtual dark field imaging. It is
also shown to work well in polycrystalline aggregates of CuO nanoparticles. In
view of the higher contrast and selectivity, and the complete exclusion of
diffuse scattering from the image formation, it is expected to be of
significant benefit for characterisation of a wide variety of crystalline
materials.

<p>Cu$_x$Al$_{1-x}$ thin films with $0.2 \le x \le 0.7$ have been studied as
potential alternatives for the metallization of advanced interconnects.
First-principles simulations were used to obtain the Cu$_x$Al$_{1-x}$
electronic structure and cohesive energy to benchmark different intermetallics
and their prospects for interconnect metallization. Next, thin Cu$_x$Al$_{1-x}$
films were deposited by PVD with thicknesses in the range between 3 and 28 nm.
The lowest resistivities of 9.5 $\mu\Omega$cm were obtained for 28 nm thick
stochiometric CuAl and CuAl$_2$ after 400$^\circ$C post-deposition annealing.
Based on the experimental results, we discuss the main challenges for the

the film stoichiometry, the phase separation observed for off-stoichiometric
CuAl and CuAl$_2$, as well as the presence of a nonstoichiometric surface

<p>Fragile topology, akin to twisted bilayer graphene and the exotic phases
therein, is a notable topological class with intriguing properties. However,
due to its unique nature and the lack of bulk-edge correspondence, the
experimental signature of fragile topology has been under debated since its
birth. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that fragile topological phases with
filling anomaly can be probed via screw dislocations, despite that they do not
support gapless edge states. Using a designer hexagonal phononic crystal with a
fragile topological band gap, we find that 1D gapless bound modes can emerge at
a screw dislocation due to the bulk fragile topology. We then establish a
connection between our system and the twisted boundary condition via the gauge
invariance principle and illustrate that such an emergent phenomenon is an
intrinsic property of fragile topological phases with filling anomaly. We
observe experimentally the 1D topological bound states using the pump-probe
measurements of their dispersion and wavefunctions, which unveils a novel
bulk-defect correspondence of fragile topology and a powerful tool for probing
fragile topological phases and materials.

<p>No state of matter can be defined categorically by what it is not; yet spin
liquids are often conjectured to exist based on the nonexistence of magnetic
order as $T \to 0$. An emerging concept designed to circumvent this ambiguity
is to categorically identify each spin liquid type by using its spectrum of
spontaneous spin noise. Here we introduce such a spectroscopy to spin liquid
studies by considering Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$. This is a spin liquid, but
whether classical or quantum and in which specific state, are unknown. By
enhancing the flux-noise spectrometry techniques introduced for magnetic
monopole noise studies, here we measure the time and temperature dependence of
spontaneous flux $\varPhi(t,T)$ and thus magnetization $M(t,T)$ of
Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$ samples. The resulting power spectral density of
magnetization noise $S_M(\omega,T)$ along with its correlation function
$C_M(t,T)$, reveal intense spin fluctuations spanning frequencies $0.1\
\mathrm{Hz} \leq \omega/2\pi \leq 50\ \mathrm{kHz}$, and that
$S_M(\omega,T)\propto \omega^{-\alpha(T)}$ with $0.84 < \alpha(T) < 1.04$.
Predictions for quantum spin liquids yield a frequency-independent spin-noise
spectrum, clearly inconsistent with this phenomenology However, when compared
to Monte Carlo simulations for a 2D spiral spin liquid state that are
accurately parameterized to describe Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$, comprehensive
quantitative correspondence with the data including $S_M(\omega,T)$, $C_M(t,T)$
and magnetization variance $\sigma_M^2(T)$ fingerprint the state of
Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$ as a spiral spin liquid.

<p>Direct access to transition state energies at low computational cost unlocks
the possibility of accelerating catalyst discovery. We show that the top
performing graph neural network potential trained on the OC20 dataset, a
related but different task, is able to find transition states energetically
similar (within 0.1 eV) to density functional theory (DFT) 91% of the time with
a 28x speedup. This speaks to the generalizability of the models, having never
been explicitly trained on reactions, the machine learned potential
approximates the potential energy surface well enough to be performant for this
auxiliary task. We introduce the Open Catalyst 2020 Nudged Elastic Band
(OC20NEB) dataset, which is made of 932 DFT nudged elastic band calculations,
to benchmark machine learned model performance on transition state energies. To
demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, we replicated a well-known, large
reaction network with 61 intermediates and 174 dissociation reactions at DFT
resolution (40 meV). In this case of dense NEB enumeration, we realize even
more computational cost savings and used just 12 GPU days of compute, where DFT
would have taken 52 GPU years, a 1500x speedup. Similar searches for complete
reaction networks could become routine using the approach presented here.
Finally, we replicated an ammonia synthesis activity volcano and systematically
found lower energy configurations of the transition states and intermediates on
six stepped unary surfaces. This scalable approach offers a more complete
treatment of configurational space to improve and accelerate catalyst
discovery.

parabolic trapping potential which merely serves to confine the atoms, but
otherwise remains negligible. In contrast, we suggest a different class of
experiments in which the presence of a stronger trap is an essential part of
the set-up. Because the trap-modified on-site energies exhibit a slowly varying
level spacing, similar to that of an anharmonic oscillator, an additional
time-periodic trap modulation with judiciously chosen parameters creates
nonlinear resonances which enable efficient Floquet engineering. We employ a
Mathieu approximation for constructing the near-resonant Floquet states in an
accurate manner and demonstrate the emergence of effective ground states from
the resonant trap eigenstates. Moreover, we show that the population of the
Floquet states is strongly affected by the phase of a sudden turn-on of the
trap modulation, which leads to significantly modified and rich dynamics. As a
guideline for further studies, we argue that the deliberate population of only
the resonance-induced effective ground states will allow one to realize Floquet
condensates which follow classical periodic orbits, thus providing challenging
future perspectives for the investigation of the quantum-classical
correspondence.

<h3>Piezoresistivity as an Order Parameter for Ferroaxial Transitions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02149" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02149</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ezra Day-Roberts, Rafael M. Fernandes, Turan Birol</i>
<p>Recent progress in the understanding of the collective behavior of electrons
and ions have revealed new types of ferroic orders beyond ferroelectricity and
ferromagnetism, such as the ferroaxial state. The latter retains only
rotational symmetry around a single axis and reflection symmetry with respect
to a single mirror plane, both of which are set by an emergent electric
toroidal dipole moment. Due to this unusual symmetry-breaking pattern, it has
been challenging to directly measure the ferroaxial order parameter, despite
the increasing attention this state has drawn. Here, we show that off-diagonal
components of the piezoresistivity tensor (i.e., the linear change in
resistivity under strain) transform the same way as the ferroaxial moments,
providing a direct probe of such order parameters. We identify two new proper
ferroaxial materials through a materials database search, and use
first-principles calculations to evaluate the piezoconductivity of the
double-perovskite CaSnF$_6$, revealing its connection to ferroaxial order and
to octahedral rotation modes.

<h3>Mobility-induced kinetic effects in multicomponent mixtures</h3>

<p>We give an overview exploring the role of kinetics in multicomponent
mixtures. Compared to the most commonly studied binary (single species plus
solvent) case, multicomponent fluids show a rich interplay between kinetics and
thermodynamics due to the possibility of fractionation, interdiffusion of
mixture components and collective motion. This leads to a competition between
multiple timescales that change depending on the underlying kinetics. At high
densities, crowding effects are relevant and non-equilibrium structures can
become long-lived. We present the main approaches for the study of kinetic
effects in multicomponents mixtures, including the role of crowding, and
explore their consequences for equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios. We
conclude by identifying the main challenges in the field.

<h3>Symmetry-enforced metal-insulator transition and topological adiabatic  charge pump in sliding bilayers of threefold symmetric materials</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02167" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02167</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sergio Bravo, P. A. Orellana, L. Rosales</i>
<p>Sliding bilayers are systems that exploit the possibility of relatively
translating two monolayers along a specific direction in real space, such that
different stackings could be implemented in the process. This simple approach
allows for manipulating the electronic properties of layered materials
similarly as in twisted multilayers. In this work, the sliding of bilayers,
composed of one type of monolayer with spatial symmetry described by space
group P$\bar{3}1m$ is studied. Using a minimal tight-binding model along with
symmetry analysis, we propose two effects that arise in a specific sliding
direction. First, the sliding-induced control of the band gap magnitude, which
produces a metal-insulator transition, is demonstrated. In addition, the
potential to achieve a topological adiabatic charge pump for cyclic sliding is
discussed. For each effect, we also present material implementations using
first-principles calculations. Bilayer GaS is selected for the metal-insulator
transition and bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide ZrS$_2$ is found to
display the topological pump effect. Both realizations show good agreement with
the predictions of the model.

<h3>Unraveling p-type and n-type interfaces in Superconducting  Infinite-Layer Nickelate thin films</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02186" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02186</a>
<br>
</p><i>Aravind Raji, Araceli Gutiérrez-Llorente, Dongxin Zhang, Xiaoyan Li, Manuel Bibes, Lucia Iglesias, Jean-Pascal Rueff, Alexandre Gloter</i>
<p>After decades of research, superconductivity was finally found in
nickel-based analogs of superconducting cuprates, with infinite-layer (IL)
structure. These results are so far restricted to thin films in the case of
IL-nickelates. Therefore, the nature of the interface with the substrate, and
how it couples with the thin film properties is still an open question. Here,
using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)- electron energy loss
spectroscopy (EELS) and four-dimensional (4D)-STEM, a novel chemically sharp
p-type interface is observed in a series of superconducting IL-praseodymium
nickelate samples, and a comparative study is carried out with the previously
reported n-type interface obtained in other samples. Both interfaces have
strong differences, with the p-type interface being highly polar. In
combination with ab-initio calculations, we find that the influence of the
interface on the electronic structure is local, and does not extend beyond 2-3
unit cells into the thin film. This decouples the direct influence of the
interface in driving the superconductivity, and indicates that the IL-nickelate
thin films do not have a universal interface model. Insights into the spatial
hole-distribution in SC samples, provided by monochromated EELS and total
reflection-hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, suggest that this particular
distribution might be directly influencing superconductivity.

<h3>Tangentially Active Polymers in Cylindrical Channels</h3>

<br>
</p><i>José Martín-Roca, Emanuele Locatelli, Valentino Bianco, Paolo Malgaretti, Chantal Valeriani</i>
<p>We present an analytical and computational study characterizing the
structural and dynamical properties of an active filament confined in
cylindrical channels. We first outline the effects of the interplay between
confinement and polar self-propulsion on the conformation of the chains. We
observe that the scaling of the polymer size in the channel, quantified by the
end-to-end distance, shows different anomalous behaviours at different
confinement and activity conditions. Interestingly, we show that the universal
relation, describing the ratio between the end-to-end distance of passive
polymer chains in cylindrical channels and in bulk is broken by activity.
Finally, we show that the long-time diffusion coefficient under confinement can
be rationalised by an analytical model, that takes into account the presence of
the channel and the elongated nature of the polymer.

<h3>Interaction-controlled transport in a two-dimensional massless-massive  Dirac system: Transition from degenerate to nondegenerate regimes</h3>

<p>The resistivity of two-dimensional (2D) metals generally exhibits
insensitivity to electron-electron scattering. However, it's worth noting that
Galilean invariance may not hold true in systems characterized by a spectrum
containing multiple electronic branches or in scenarios involving electron-hole
plasma. In the context of our study, we focus on 2D electrons confined within a
triple quantum well (TQW) based on HgTe. This system displays a coexistence of
energy bands featuring both linear and parabolic-like spectra at low energy
and, therefore, lacks the Galilean invariance. This research employs a combined
theoretical and experimental approach to investigate the transport properties
of this two-component system across various regimes. By manipulating carrier
density and temperature, we tune our system from a fully degenerate regime,
where resistance follows a temperature-dependent behavior proportional to
$T^2$, to a regime where both types of electrons adhere to Boltzmann
statistics. In the non-degenerate regime, electron interactions lead to
resistance that is weakly dependent on temperature. Notably, our experimental
observations closely align with the theoretical predictions derived in this
study. This work establishes the HgTe-based TQW as a promising platform for
exploring different interaction dominant scenarios for the massless-massive
Dirac system.9 pages, 8 figures

<h3>Influence of Polymer on Shock-Induced Pore Collapse: Hotspot Criticality  through Reactive Molecular Dynamics</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02234" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02234</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jalen Macatangay, Chunyu Li, Alejandro Strachan</i>
<p>The shock initiation of energetic materials is mediated by the localization
of mechanical energy into hotspots. These originate through the interaction of
the shock and material microstructure; the most potent hotspots are formed by
the collapse of porosity. Recent work using molecular dynamics (MD) has shed
light on the molecular mechanisms responsible for the shock-to-deflagration
transition following pore collapse in pure energetic materials. However,
explosive formulations are composites of energetic crystals and a polymer
binder, which differs from the prior focus on pure materials. The role of
polymer phases on hotspot formation and its criticality is not well-understood.
We use reactive MD simulations to investigate the role of polystyrene and
polyvinyl nitrate films around pores in the shock-induced pore collapse of RDX.
The polymer affects the hotspots' temperature and their criticality. While the
presence of inert polymer often delays or hinders chemical reactions of the
energetic material, certain geometries accelerate chemistry. The simulations
provide a mechanistic understanding of these phenomena.

<h3>Fractonic criticality in Rydberg atom arrays</h3>

</p><i>Rafael A. Macedo, Rodrigo G. Pereira</i>
<p>Fractonic matter can undergo unconventional phase transitions driven by the
condensation of particles that move along subdimensional manifolds. We propose
that this type of quantum critical point can be realized in a bilayer of
crossed Rydberg chains. This system exhibits a transition between a disordered
phase and a charge-density-wave phase with subextensive ground state
degeneracy. The transition is described by a stack of critical Ising conformal
field theories that become decoupled in the low-energy limit due to emergent
subsystem symmetries. We discuss the unusual scaling properties and derive
anisotropic correlators that provide signatures of subdimensional criticality
in a realistic setup.

<h3>Electron Drag Effect on Thermal Conductivity in Two-dimensional  Semiconductors</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02257" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02257</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yujie Quan, Bolin Liao</i>
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials have shown great potential in applications as
transistors, where thermal dissipation becomes crucial because of the
increasing energy density. Although thermal conductivity of 2D materials has
been extensively studied, interactions between nonequilibrium electrons and
phonons, which can be strong when high electric fields and heat current
coexist, are not considered. In this work, we systematically study the electron
drag effect, where nonequilibrium electrons impart momenta to phonons and
influence the thermal conductivity, in 2D semiconductors using ab initio
simulations. We find that, at room temperature, electron drag can significantly
increase thermal conductivity by decreasing phonon-electron scattering in 2D
semiconductors, while its impact in three-dimensional (3D) semiconductors is
negligible. We attribute this difference to the large electron-phonon
scattering phase space and higher contribution to thermal conductivity by
drag-active phonons. Our work elucidates the fundamental physics underlying
coupled electron-phonon transport in materials of various dimensionalities.

<p>Magnetic hopfions are localized magnetic solitons with a nonzero 3D
topological charge (Hopf index). Herein, an analytical calculation of the
magnetic hopfion gyrovector is presented and it is shown that it does not
vanish even in an infinite sample. The calculation method is based on the
concept of the emergent magnetic field. The particular case of the simplest
nontrivial toroidal hopfion with the Hopf index $\|Q_H\|=1$ in the cylindrical
magnetic dot is considered and dependencies of the gyrovector components on the
dot sizes are calculated. Nonzero hopfion gyrovector is important in any
description of the hopfion dynamics within the collective coordinate Thieles
approach.

<h3>Local number fluctuations in ordered and disordered phases of water  across temperatures: Higher-order moments and degrees of tetrahedrality</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02271" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02271</a>
<br>
</p><i>Michael A. Klatt, Jaeuk Kim, Thomas E. Gartner III, Salvatore Torquato</i>
<p>The isothermal compressibility (i.e., the asymptotic number variance) of
equilibrium liquid water as a function of temperature is minimal near ambient
conditions. This anomalous non-monotonic temperature dependence is due to a
balance between thermal fluctuations and the formation of tetrahedral
hydrogen-bond networks. Since tetrahedrality is a many-body property, it will
also influence the higher-order moments of density fluctuations, including the
skewness and kurtosis. To gain a more complete picture, we examine these
higher-order moments that encapsulate many-body correlations using a recently
developed, advanced platform for local density fluctuations. We study an
extensive set of simulated phases of water across a range of temperatures (80 K
to 1600 K) with various degrees of tetrahedrality, including ice phases,
equilibrium liquid water, supercritical water, and disordered nonequilibrium
quenches. We find clear signatures of tetrahedrality in the higher-order
moments, including the skewness and excess kurtosis, that scale for all cases
with the degree of tetrahedrality. More importantly, this scaling behavior
leads to non-monotonic temperature dependencies in the higher-order moments for
both equilibrium and non-equilibrium phases. Specifically, at near-ambient
conditions, the higher-order moments vanish most rapidly for large length
scales, and the distribution quickly converges to a Gaussian in our metric.
However, at non-ambient conditions, higher-order moments vanish more slowly and
hence become more relevant especially for improving information-theoretic
approximations of hydrophobic solubility. The temperature non-monotonicity that
we observe in the full distribution across length-scales could shed light on
water's nested anomalies, i.e., reveal new links between structural, dynamic,
and thermodynamic anomalies.

<h3>Local insulator-to-superconductor transition in amorphous InO$_x$ films  modulated by e-beam irradiation</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02276" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02276</a>
<br>
</p><i>Iago F. Llovo, Julien Delahaye</i>
<p>We present a novel method enabling precise post-fabrication modulation of the
electrical resistance in micrometer-scale regions of amorphous indium oxide
(a-InO$_x$) films. By subjecting initially insulating films to an electron beam
at room temperature, we demonstrate that the exposed region of the films
becomes superconducting. The resultant superconducting transition temperature
($T_c$) is adjustable up to 2.8 K by changing the electron dose and
accelerating voltage. This technique offers a compelling alternative to
traditional a-InO$_x$ annealing methods for both fundamental investigations and
practical applications. Moreover, it empowers independent adjustment of
electrical properties across initially identical a-InO$_x$ samples on the same
substrate, facilitating the creation of superconducting microstructures with
precise $T_c$ control at the micrometer scale. The observed resistance
modifications likely stem from photoreduction induced by X-ray and/or UV
radiation emitted during electron beam interactions with the film and
substrate.

<h3>Modulational instability in a quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein  condensates</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02282" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02282</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sherzod R. Otajonov, Bakhram A. Umarov, Fatkhulla Kh. Abdullaev</i>
<p>In this work, we investigate the modulational instability of plane wave
solutions within a modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation framework. The equation
features cubic and quartic nonlinearity. It models the behaviour of
quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates in symmetric Bose-Bose mixtures
of ultra-dilute cold atoms. Our study demonstrates the pivotal role of the
competition between mean-field attractions and quantum fluctuation-induced
repulsions. This competition significantly affects the emergence and evolution
of modulational instability. By employing linear stability analysis, we
identify the essential conditions that lead to modulational instability. We
find that the stability of plane wave solutions significantly depends on the
interaction among system parameters. Further development of the instability
leads to the fragmentation of the BEC into a chain of quantum droplets. We
calculated the quantity of quantum droplets generated during the nonlinear
phase of the instability. Our analytical results are corroborated by numerical
simulations of the modified quasi-1D Gross-Pitaevskii equation. These
simulations vividly depict the formation, interaction, and coalescence of
droplets during the nonlinear phase of modulational instability. The
investigation shows that linear stability analysis of the modified
Gross-Pitaevskii equation, considering quantum fluctuations, precisely
forecasts modulational instability phenomena across different domains of
parameter spaces.
