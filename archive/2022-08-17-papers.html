<h3>Determining the timing jitter of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors using a CW laser</h3>

We investigated the timing jitter of superconducing nanowire single-photon
detectors (SNSPDs) and found a strong dependence on the detector response. By
varying the material stack, we observed changes in pulse shape which are
attributed to capacitive behaviour affecting the pulse heights, rise times and
consequently timing jitter. Moreover, we developed a technique to predict the
timing jitter of a single device within certain limits by capturing only a
single detector pulse, eliminating the need for detailed jitter measurement
using a pulsed laser.

We present three Lagrangian algebras in the modular 2-category associated to
the 3+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order and discuss their physical
interpretations, connecting algebras with gapped boundary conditions, and
interestingly, maps (braided autoequivalences) exchanging algebras with bulk
domain walls. A Lagrangian algebra, together with its modules and local
modules, encapsulates detailed physical data of strings condensing at a gapped
boundary. In particular, the condensed strings can terminate at boundaries in
non-trivial ways. This phenomenon has no lower dimensional analogue and
corresponds to novel mathematical structures associated to higher algebras. We
provide a layered construction and also explicit lattice realizations of these
boundaries and illustrate the correspondence between physics and mathematics of
these boundary conditions. This is a first detailed study of the mathematics of
Lagrangian algebras in modular 2-categories and their corresponding physics,
that brings together rich phenomena of string condensations, gapped boundaries
and domain walls in 3+1D topological orders.

Surfactant choice is key in starting the phenomena of artificial
morphogenesis, the bottom-up growth of geometric particles from cooled emulsion
droplets, as well as the bottom-up self-assembly of rechargeable microswimmer
robots from similar droplets. The choice of surfactant is crucial for the
formation of a plastic phase at the oil-water interface, for the kinetics, and
for the onset temperature of these processes. But further details are needed to
control these processes for bottom-up manufacturing and understand their
molecular mechanisms. Still unknown are the minimum concentration of the
surfactant necessary to induce the processes, or competing effects in a mixture
of surfactants when only one is capable of inducing shapes. Here we
systematically study the effect of surfactant nature and concentration on the
shape-inducing behaviour of hexadecane-in-water emulsions with both cationic
(CTAB) and non-ionic (Tween, Brij) surfactants over up to five orders of
magnitude of concentration. The minimum effective concentration is found
approximately equal to the critical micelle concentration (CMC), or the
solubility limit below the Krafft point of the surfactant. However, the
emulsions show low stability at the vicinity of CMC. In a mixed surfactant
experiment (Tween 60 and Tween 20), where only one (Tween 60) can induce shapes
we elucidate the role of competition at the interface during mixed surfactant
adsorption by varying the composition. We find that a lower bound of ~ 75%
surface coverage of the shape-inducing surfactant with C14 or longer chain
length is necessary for self-shaping to occur. The resulting technique produces
a clear visual readout of otherwise difficult to investigate molecular events
and establish basic requirements for minimum concentration and protocols to
find % surface coverage to induce oil self-shaping by surfactant mixtures.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07763v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07763v1</a>

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are complex diseases in which the gut
microbiota is attacked by the immune system of genetically predisposed subjects
when they are exposed to yet unclear environmental factors. The complexity of
this class of diseases makes them suitable to be represented and studied with
network science. In the project, the metagenomic data of the gut microbiota of
control, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis subjects were divided in three
ranges (prevalent, common, uncommon). Then, correlation networks and
co-expression networks were used to represent this data. The former networks
involved the calculation of the Pearson's correlation and the use of the
percolation threshold to binarize the adjacency matrix, whereas the latter
involved the construction of the bipartite networks and the monopartite
projection after binarization of the biadjacency matrix. Then, centrality
measures and community detection were used on the so-built networks. The main
results obtained were about the modules of "Bacteroides", which were connected
in control subjects' correlation network, "Faecalibacterium prausnitzii", where
co-enzyme A became central in IBD correlation networks and "Escherichia coli",
which module has different position in the different diagnoses networks.

We study magnetic multilayers, incorporating dilute ferromagnetic spacers
between strongly-ferromagnetic layers exhibiting a proximity-enhanced
magnetocaloric effect. Using magnetometry and direct measurements of the
adiabatic temperature change based on a nanomembrane-calorimetry, we find that
the magnetocaloric effect in the studied multilayer is indeed enhanced compared
to that in the bulk spacer material. We develop a phenomenological numerical
model of the studied trilayer and find that a long-range exchange interaction
through the weakly-ferromagnetic spacer is required to adequately describe the
magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of the system.

Motivated by rapid developments in the field of quantum computing and the
increasingly diverse nature of qubits, we theoretically study the influence
that quenched outside disturbances have in an intermediately long time limit.
We consider localized imperfections, uniform fields, noise, and couplings to an
environment which we study in a unified framework using a prototypical but
idealized interacting quantum device - the Kitaev honeycomb model. Our study
focuses on the quantum state robustness in response to an outside magnetic
field, a magnetic bath, magnetic noise, magnetic impurities, and a noisy
impurity. As indicators for quantum robustness, we use the Uhlmann fidelty of
the ground state and excited spinon states after a quench. We find that the
time dependence of the fidelity often depends crucially on whether the system
is gapped. We find that in the gapped case the fidelity decays to a constant
value under noiseless quenches, while in a gapless system it exhibits algebraic
decay. In all other situations studied, such as coupling to a bath and noisy
quenches, both gapped and gapless systems exhibit a universal form for the
long-time fidelity, $Ce^{-\alpha t}t^{-\beta}$, where the values of $C$,
$\alpha$, and $\beta$ depend on physical parameters such as system size,
disturbance strength, etc. Therefore, our work provides estimates for the
intermediate-long time stability of a quantum device and it suggests under what
conditions there appear the hallmarks of an orthogonality catastrophe in the
time-dependence of the fidelity. Our work provides engineering guidelines for
quantum devices in quench design and system size.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07680v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07680v1</a>

The dielectric response of non-interacting dipoles is discussed in the
framework of the classical model of stochastic reorientations in an asymmetric
double well potential (ADWP). In the nonlinear regime, this model exhibits some
pecularities in the static response. We find that the saturation behavior of
the symmetric double well potential model does not follow the Langevin function
and only in the linear regime the standard results are recovered. If a finite
asymmetry is assumed, the nonlinear susceptibilities are found to change the
sign at a number of characteristic temperatures that depend on the magnitude of
the asymmetry, as has been observed earlier for the third-order and the
fifth-order response. If the kinetics of the barrier crossing in the ADWP model
is described as a two-state model, we can give analytical expressions for the
values of the characteristic temperatures. The results for the response
obtained from a (numerical) solution of the Fokker-Planck equation for the
Brownian motion in a model ADWP behaves very similar to the two-state model for
high barriers. For small barriers no clearcut time scale separation between the
barrier crossing process and the intra-well relaxation exists and the model
exhibits a number of time scales. In this case, the frequency-dependent linear
susceptibility at low temperatures is dominated by the fast intra-well
transitions and at higher temperatures by the barrier crossing kinetics. We
find that for nonlinear susceptibilities the latter process appears to be more
important and the intra-well transitions play only role at the lowest
temperatures.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07661v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07661v1</a>

The spin-orbit interaction, which describes the coupling of the spin dynamics
of an electron with its orbital motion, could result in peculiar properties for
the associated energy dispersion under some special situations. In this letter,
we study the spin-orbit coupling of Dirac-Weyl fermions in graphene subject to
a magnetic field with Rashba contribution in the minimal length situation. The
exact solution for the energy dispersion of Dirac-like charge carriers coupled
to the magnetic moments in a (2+1)-dimension is obtained by the use of the
momentum space representation. Moreover, as it comes to applications for 2D
Dirac-like quasiparticles, we also extend our theory and results in some
special cases, showing that the emerging energy spectrum at the high energy
limit becomes independent of the Rashba coupling, $\lambda_{R}$, and the band
index of Landau levels.
