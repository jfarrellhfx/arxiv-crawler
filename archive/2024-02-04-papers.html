<h3>Study of a general growth model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00882" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00882</a>
<br>
<i>G. Albano, V. Giorno, P. Román-Román, F. Torres-Ruiz</i>
<p>We discuss a general growth curve including several parameters, whose choice
leads to a variety of models including the classical cases of Malthusian,
Richards, Gompertz, Logistic and some their generalizations. The advantage is
to obtain a single mathematically tractable equation from which the main
characteristics of the considered curves can be deduced. We focus on the
effects of the involved parameters through both analytical results and
computational evaluations.

<h3>The dynamical bulk boundary correspondence and dynamical quantum phase  transitions in the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00883" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00883</a>
<br>
<i>Tomasz Masłowski, Nicholas Sedlmayr</i>
<p>In this article we demonstrate that dynamical quantum phase transitions occur
for an exemplary higher order topological insulator, the
Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model, following quenches across a topological phase
boundary. A dynamical bulk boundary correspondence is also seen both in the
eigenvalues of the Loschmidt overlap matrix and the boundary return rate. The
latter is found from a finite size scaling analysis for which the relative
simplicity of the model is crucial. Contrary to the usual two dimensional case
the dynamical quantum phase transitions in this model show up as cusps in the
return rate, as for a one dimensional model, rather than as cusps in its
derivative as would be typical for a two dimensional model. We explain the
origin of this behaviour.

<h3>Correlated phases and topological phase transition in twisted bilayer  graphene at one quantum of magnetic flux</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00884" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00884</a>
<br>
<i>Miguel Sánchez Sánchez, Tobias Stauber</i>
<p>When the perpendicular magnetic flux per unit cell in a crystal is equal to
the quantum of magnetic flux, $\Phi_0=h/e$, we enter the 'Hofstadter regime'.
The large unit cell of moir\'e materials like magic-angle twisted bilayer
graphene (MATBG) allows the experimental study of this regime at feasible
values of the field of around $25$ T. In this work, we report numerical
analysis of a tight-binding model for MATBG at one quantum of external magnetic
flux, including the long-range Coulomb and on-site Hubbard interaction. We
study the correlated states for dopings of $-2,0$ and $2$ electrons per unit
cell at the mean-field level. We find competing insulators with Chern numbers
$2$ and $0$ at positive doping, the stability of which is determined by the
dielectric screening, which opens up the possibility of observing a topological
phase transition in this system.

<h3>TopologicalNumbers.jl: A Julia package for topological number  computation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00885" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00885</a>
<br>
<i>Keisuke Adachi, Minoru Kanega</i>
<p>Topological insulators have been of considerable interest in the last
decades. These materials show new states of matter that are insulating in the
bulk but have conducting states on their surfaces. The conducting states on the
surface are protected by the topology of the bulk band structure, and
topological numbers, such as first Chern number, second Chern number,
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ number, etc., are used to characterize them. As a typical
example, the quantum Hall effect has the quantized Hall conductivity, which can
be calculated by the first Chern number. Other topological numbers similarly
become important physical quantities that characterize the system, depending on
the system dimension and symmetry classes. To obtain the topological numbers,
we often need numerical calculations, and it may require an enormous amount of
computation before convergence is achieved. Therefore, creating tools to easily
compute these numbers will lead to advances in research for the topological
phase of matters. So far, several methods have been reported that suggest that
some topological numbers can be computed efficiently. However, since each
method is specialized for a specific dimension or symmetry class, it is
necessary to implement the algorithm for each problem, respectively. Our
project, TopologicalNumbers.jl, aims to provide a package that can easily and
efficiently compute topological numbers comprehensively in various dimensions
and symmetry classes.

<h3>Time-Dependent Dielectric Breakdown on Subnanometer EOT nMOS FinFETs</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00886" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00886</a>
<br>
<i>Pedro C. Feijoo, Thomas Kauerauf, María Toledano-Luque, Mitsuhiro Togo, Enrique San Andrés, Guido Groeseneken</i>
<p>In this paper, the time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) in sub-1-nm
equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) n-type bulk FinFETs is studied. The gate
stacks consist of an IMEC clean interfacial layer, atomic layer deposition HfO2
high-k and TiN metal electrode. For the 0.8-nm EOT FinFETs, it is found that
TDDB lifetime is consistent with results of planar devices for areas around
1e-8 cm2, implying that the FinFET architecture does not seem to introduce new
failure mechanisms. However, for devices with smaller area, the extrapolated
voltage at a ten-year lifetime for soft breakdown (SBD) does not meet the
specifications, and as a consequence, the SBD path wear-out will have to be
included in the final extrapolation. Furthermore, it is shown that for EOTs
smaller than 0.8 nm, the TDDB reliability on n-type FinFETs is challenged by
the high leakage currents.

<h3>Gadolinium scandate by high-pressure sputtering for future generations  of high-k dielectrics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00887" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00887</a>
<br>
<i>Pedro Carlos Feijoo, María Ángela Pampillón, Enrique San Andrés, José Luis G. Fierro</i>
<p>Gd-rich gadolinium scandate (Gd2-xScxO3) was deposited by high-pressure
sputtering on (100) silicon by alternating the deposition of lower than 0.5 nm
thick films of its binary components: Sc2O3 and Gd2O3. The formation of the
ternary oxide was observed after the thermal treatments, with a high increase
in the effective permittivity of the dielectric (up to 21). The silicon
diffuses into the Gd2-xScxO3 films, which show an amorphous character. After
the annealing no interfacial silicon oxide is present. CHF-VG curves indicated
low hysteresis (55 mV) and a density of interfacial defects of 6e11 eV-1 cm-2.

<h3>Electrical characterization of gadolinium oxide deposited by high  pressure sputtering with in situ plasma oxidation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00889" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00889</a>
<br>
<i>María Ángela Pampillón, Pedro Carlos Feijoo, Enrique San Andrés</i>
<p>In this work, we characterized gadolinium oxide films deposited on silicon by
high pressure sputtering with a two-step process: first, we sputtered metallic
gadolinium in an argon atmosphere and then, we performed an in-situ plasma
oxidation of the metallic layer previously deposited. By means of high
resolution transmission electron microscopy, we can detect the oxidation degree
of the metallic film. Under optimized deposition conditions, fully oxidized
Gd2O3 films are obtained. In addition, the capacitance and conductance as a
function of gate voltage of Pt gated metal-insulator-semiconductor capacitors
confirm stable dielectric behavior of the fully oxidized films. The devices
show low gate leakage currents (1e5 A/cm2 at 1 V for 2.2 nm of equivalent oxide
thickness), low interface trap density and an almost negligible hysteresis and
frequency dispersion.

<h3>Photovoltaic properties evaluated by its thermodynamic evolution in a  double quantum dot photocell</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00894" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00894</a>
<br>
<i>Sheng-Nan Zhu, Shun-Cai Zhao, Lin-Jie Chen</i>
<p>Obtaining the physical mechanism of photoelectric transfer in quantum-dot
(QD) photocells may be one strategy to boost the photovoltaic conversion
efficiency. In this work, we attempted to formulate a novel theoretical
approach to evaluate photocells' performance via evaluating their thermodynamic
evolution during the photoelectric conversion process in a double quantum dot
(DQD) photocell model. Results demonstrate that the thermodynamic-related
quantities can reflect the law of photovoltaic dynamics, i.e., the
photoelectric transfer properties can be evaluated by the heat currents
indirectly. The merit of this work not only expands our understanding of the
physical law of heat currents in the photoelectric transport process, but it
may also propose a new method for optimizing photoelectric conversion
efficiency in a DQD photocell.

<h3>Photoexcited carriers transfer properties in a doped double quantum dots  photocell</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00895" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00895</a>
<br>
<i>Sheng-Nan Zhu, Shun-Cai Zhao, Lin-Jie Chen, Qing Fang</i>
<p>Identifying the behavior of photoexcited carriers is one method for
empirically boosting their transfer efficiencies in doped double quantum dots
(DQDs) photocells. The photoexcited carriers transfer qualities were assessed
in this study by the output current, power, and output efficiency in the
multi-photon absorption process for a doped DQDs photocell, and an optimization
technique is theoretically obtained for this proposed photocell model. The
results show that some structure parameters caused by doping, such as gaps,
incoherent tunneling coupling, and symmetry of structure between two vertically
aligned QDs, can remarkably control the photoexcited carriers transfer
properties, and that slightly increasing the ambient temperature around room
temperature is beneficial to the transfer performance in this doping DQDs
photocell model. Thus, our scheme proves a way to optimized strategies for DQDs
photocell.

<h3>Test of the formal basis of Arrhenius law with heat capacities</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00900" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00900</a>
<br>
<i>Denis Michel</i>
<p>The exponential factor of Arrhenius satisfactorily quantifies the energetic
restriction of chemical reactions but is still awaiting a rigorous basis.
Assuming that the Arrhenius equation should be based on statistical mechanics
and is probabilistic in nature, two structures for this equation are compared,
depending on whether the reactant energies are viewed as the mean values of
specific energy distributions or as particular levels in a global energy
distribution. In the first version, the Arrhenius exponential factor would be a
probability that depends once on temperature, while in the second it is a ratio
of probabilities that depends twice on temperature. These concurrent equations
are tested using experimental data for the isomerization of 2-butene. This
comparison reveals the fundamental structure of the Arrhenius law in isothermal
systems and overlooked properties resulting from the introduction of reactant
energies into the equation.

<h3>Enhancement of Chiral-Induced Spin Selectivity via Circularly Polarized  Light</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00903" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00903</a>
<br>
<i>Wei Liu, Jingqi Chen, Wenjie Dou</i>
<p>The notion of chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) has attracted intensive
research interest recently. However, the practical applications of the CISS
effects face challenges due to relatively low spin polarization. In this
Letter, we propose a non-perturbative theory illustrating how circularly
polarized (CP) light enhances CISS effects through strong light-matter
interactions. We introduce a Floquet electronic friction model to study the
nonadiabatic dynamics and spin transport through a chiral molecule in a
molecule junction subjected to external driving. Our results show that the
interplay of the nonadiabatic effects and light-matter interactions can
significantly ($>90\%$) enhance electron spin polarization under CP light. Our
predictions can be very useful in experiments for using CP light to control
spin current in chiral molecular junctions.

<h3>Photovoltaic properties enhanced by the tunneling effect in a coupled  quantum dot photocell</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00908" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00908</a>
<br>
<i>Sheng-Qiang Zhong, Shun-Cai Zhao, Sheng-Nan Zhu</i>
<p>Double quantum dots (DQDs) have emerged as versatile and efficient absorbing
light devices owing to their more multiple adjusting parameters than the single
QD's. Using the system-reservoir theory, tunneling effect on the quantum
photovoltaic properties is evaluated detailedly in a DQDs photocell with
different energy mismatches under different temperatures. Repopulation of
photo-generated carriers in two excited states is generated by electron
tunneling effect between two coupled QD pairs, which brings out more efficient
quantum photovoltaic yields evaluated by the short-circuit current,
open-circuit voltage and output power through the current-voltage and
power-voltage characteristics. Further discussion reveals that the quantum
photovoltaic properties are enhanced by the ambient environment temperatures
but weakened by the energy mismatches. However, the weakening effect caused by
the energy mismatches can be greatly reduced by tunneling effect. Insights into
tunneling effect between two adjacent QD not only facilitate a better
understanding of the fundamentals in carriers transport, but also provide novel
strategies for efficient artificial assembled QD arrays photocell inspired by
this proposed DQDs photocell model.

<h3>Dielectric spectroscopy of a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal and  the effect of the sample thickness</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00911" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00911</a>
<br>
<i>Aitor Erkoreka, Josu Martinez-Perdiguero, Richard J. Mandle, Alenka Mertelj, Nerea Sebastián</i>
<p>The recently discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals have been
reported to exhibit very large dielectric permittivity values. Here, we report
a systematic investigation of the dielectric behavior of a prototypical
ferroelectric nematogen by varying the thickness of the parallel capacitor
measuring cell. While in the non-polar high temperature nematic phase results
show only slight differences due to slight variations of the alignment, the
measured permittivity values in the ferroelectric nematic phase show a linear
dependence on the cell thickness. It is also shown that the characteristic
relaxation frequency decreases inversely proportionally to the thickness. The
results are discussed in terms of three different available models based on
different underlying mechanisms, accounting for cancellation of the probe
electric fields by polarization reorientation or by ionic charges, or based on
a recently proposed continuous phenomenological model.

<h3>Numerical linked cluster expansions for two-dimensional spin models with  continuous disorder distributions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00931" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00931</a>
<br>
<i>Mahmoud Abdelshafy, Marcos Rigol</i>
<p>We show that numerical linked cluster expansions (NLCEs) based on
sufficiently large building blocks can be used to obtain accurate
low-temperature results for the thermodynamic properties of spin lattice models
with continuous disorder distributions. Our main finding is that such results
can be obtained using direct disorder averages on the NLCE clusters before
computing their weights. We provide a proof of concept using three different
NLCEs based on L, square, and rectangle building blocks. We consider both
classical (Ising) and quantum (Heisenberg) spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ models and show
that convergence can be achieved down to temperatures that are up to two orders
of magnitude lower than the relevant energy scale in the model. Additionally,
we provide evidence that in one dimension one can compute observables such as
the energy down to their ground state values.

<h3>In pursuit of deconfined quantum criticality in Ising gauge theory  entangled with single-component fermions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00933" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00933</a>
<br>
<i>Umberto Borla, Snir Gazit, Sergej Moroz</i>
<p>We highlight exotic quantum criticality of quasi-two-dimensional
single-component fermions at half-filling that are minimally coupled to a
dynamical Ising gauge theory. With the numerical matrix product state based
iDMRG method, we discover a robust quantum critical line in the infinite
cylinder geometry, where gauge confinement and dimerized translation symmetry
breaking emerge simultaneously. We investigate how the transition can be split
by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered dimerized phase that is stabilized by
additional short-range repulsive interactions. We conjecture a $u(1)$
deconfined criticality scenario, propose a corresponding low-energy effective
field theory of the exotic quantum critical point in the two-dimensional limit
and identify its shortcomings

<h3>Conserved quantities for Generalized Gibbs Ensemble from Entanglement</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00939" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00939</a>
<br>
<i>Hao Chen, Biao Lian</i>
<p>Relaxed quantum systems with conservation laws are believed to be
approximated by the Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), which incorporates the
constraints of certain conserved quantities serving as integrals of motion. By
drawing analogy between reduced density matrix and GGE, we demonstrate for free
fermions a generic entanglement Hamiltonian superdensity matrix (EHSM)
framework for determining the set of conserved quantities in GGE. The framework
proposes that such conserved quantities are linear superposition of eigenstate
entanglement Hamiltonians of a larger auxiliary system, where the eigenstates
are Fock states occupying the common eigenmodes. For 1D homogeneous free
fermions with periodic boundary condition, which maps to 1D hardcore bosons,
these conserved quantities lead to an non-Abelian GGE, which predicts the
relaxation of both fermion and boson bilinears more accurately than the
conventional Abelian GGE. Generalization of the framework to interacting models
may provide novel numerical insights for quantum integrability.

<h3>Parity-time symmetry breaking enables swarming motility in  Caenorhabditis elegans</h3>

<i>Mustafa Basaran, Tevfik Can Yüce, Ali Keçebaş, Baha Altın, Yusuf Ilker Yaman, Esin Demir, Coşkun Kocabaş, Şahin K. Özdemir, Aşkın Kocabaş</i>
<p>Nonreciprocal interactions break action-reaction symmetry in systems of
interacting bodies. This process inevitably introduces non-Hermitian dynamics
which with its hallmark signature called exceptional points (EPs) has been a
subject of intense research across different disciplines ranging from photonics
to metamaterials. Whether non-Hermiticity and EPs are a fundamental property of
nature and if so, how nature utilizes them to gain competitive advantage have
remained largely unanswered. Although biological systems feature many examples
of non-reciprocal interactions with the potential to drive non-Hermitian
dynamics, these are often theoretically overlooked and not experimentally
investigated. Here, we demonstrate in an active matter composed of social
animal Caenorhabditis elegans and bacteria, non-Hermitian dynamics, and the
emergence of EPs owing to the nonreciprocal nature of oxygen sensing,
nonequilibrium interfacial current, and bacterial consumption. We observed that
when driven through the EP, the system collectively breaks parity-time (PT)
symmetry leading to traveling waves and arrested phase separation. We further
find that these features enable the collective ability to localize interfaces
between broken and exact PT-phases. Remarkably, this ability provides a strong
evolutionary advantage to animals living in soil. Altogether our results
provide mechanistic insights into the detailed symmetries controlling the
collective response of biological systems; answer a long-standing problem; and
give an example of the EP-enabled dynamics in a biological system.

<h3>Berry curvature inside parity-time-symmetry protected exceptional  surface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00953" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00953</a>
<br>
<i>P. Wang, L. Jin, Z. Song</i>
<p>A three-dimensional non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with parity-time symmetry can
exhibit a closed exceptional surface (EP surface) in momentum space, which is a
non-Hermitian deformation of the degeneracy line (DL). Since the degeneracy
line lacks an internal space, the distributions of Berry curvature inside the
EP surface becomes particularly intriguing. This paper studies the
distributions taking a torus-like EP surface as an example. In a meridian
cross-section, the Berry connection exhibits a vortex-like field with only
angular components, while the Berry curvature is perpendicular to this
cross-section; in a equatorial cross-section, the Berry curvature forms a
closed curve surrounding the central genus. Both Berry connection and curvature
converge along the coplanar axis and diverge at the surface. We find the Berry
flux depends on the radius of the integration region and is not quantized
inside the EP torus. Approaching the surface, the Berry flux tends to infinity
and the dynamical phase oscillates violently. We point that the streamlines of
Berry curvature can be used to estimate the zero or non-zero Berry flux. We
generalize the above patterns to the case of EP surfaces with complex shapes,
and present a proposal of realizing the EP surface in an electrical circuit.
Our research outcomes enhance the comprehension of EP surfaces and the
topological characteristics of non-Hermitian systems with parity-time (PT )
symmetry.

<h3>The shape memory effect and minimal surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00980" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00980</a>
<br>
<i>Mengdi Yin, Dimitri D. Vvedensky</i>
<p>Martensitic transformations, viewed as continuous transformations between
triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS), as originally proposed by Hyde and
Andersson [Z. Kristallogr. 174, 225 (1986)], is extended to include paths
between the initial and final phases. Bravais lattices correspond to particular
TPMS whose lattice points are flat points, where the Gaussian curvature
vanishes. Reversible transformations, which correspond to shape memory
materials, occur only if lattice points remain at flat points on a TPMS
throughout a continuous deformation. For the shape memory material NiTi,
density-functional theory (DFT) yields irreversible and reversible paths with
and without energy barriers, respectively. Although there are TPMS for
face-centered gamma-Fe) and body-centered (alpha-Fe) cubic lattices, gamma to
alpha deformation paths are not reversible, in agreement with non-vanishing
energy barriers obtained from DFT.

<h3>Two-dimensional 5d multiferroic W3Cl8: breathing Kagome lattice and  tunable magneto-optical Kerr effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01100" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01100</a>
<br>
<i>Di Hu, Haoshen Ye, Ning Ding, Kaidi Xu, Shan-Shan Wang, Shuai Dong, Xiaoyan Yao</i>
<p>Owing to the strong spin-orbit coupling and the related fascinating physical
properties, heavy 5d transition-metals exhibit desirable application prospects.
However, up to now, the 5d magnetic materials are still very limited,
especially very rare for tungsten. In this work, we theoretically predict a
two-dimensional multiferroic W3Cl8 monolayer. Intrinsic 5d magnetism of
tungsten is activated by the W ions' fractional valence in a breathing Kagome
lattice of reduced effective dimension. A coplanar Y-type antiferromagnetism
composed by ferromagnetic W3 trimers is confirmed as the magnetic ground state.
The spontaneous ferroelectric polarization mainly originates from the ion
displacement induced by the breathing distortion of Kagome lattice. An
intrinsic magneto-optical Kerr effect with sizable Kerr angle can be observed
to detect this trimeric Y-type antiferromagnetism, and it depends strongly on
the detailed magnetic order. Thereby, we propose a general scheme for realizing
more 5d magnetism in two-dimensional multiferroic systems.

<i>David Mateos, Oscar Jover, Miguel Varea, Koen Lauwaet, Daniel Granados, Rodolfo Miranda, Antonio I. Fernandez-Dominguez, Alberto Martin-Jimenez, Roberto Otero</i>
<p>Plasmonic nanoantennas, metallodielectric structures with engineered size and
shape, have attracted much attention lately as they make the control of the
directionality and temporal characteristics of light emitted by fluorophores
possible. Nanoantennas exploit light-matter interactions mediated by Localized
Surface Plasmon Resonances and, so far, have been demonstrated using metallic
nanoparticles or other metallic nanostructures. Plasmonic picocavities, i.e.,
plasmonic cavities with mode volumes below 1 cubic nanometer, could act as
antennas to mediate light-matter interaction even more efficiently than their
nanoscale counterparts due to their extreme field confinement, but the
directionality on their emission is difficult to control. In this work, we show
that the plasmonic picocavity formed between the tip of a Scanning Tunnelling
Microscope and a metal surface with a monoatomic step shows directional
emission profiles and, thus, can be considered as a realization of a
picoantenna. Comparison with electromagnetic calculations demonstrates that the
observed directionality arises from light emission tilting of the picocavity
plasmons. Our results, thus, pave the way to exploiting picoantennas as an
efficient way to control light-matter interaction at the nanoscale.

<h3>Deformation dynamics of an oil droplet into a crescent shape during the  intermittent motion</h3>

<i>Sayaka Otani, Hiroaki Ito, Tomonori Nomoto, Masanori Fujinami, Jerzy Gorecki, Hiroyuki Kitahata</i>
<p>A paraffin droplet containing camphor and oil red O dye floating on the water
surface exhibits spontaneous motion with deformation by generating a surface
tension gradient around the droplet. We focused on the intermittent motion with
a pronounced deformation into a crescent shape observed at specific
concentrations of camphor and oil red O. We quantitatively analyzed the time
changes in the droplet deformation and investigated the role of the oil red O
by measuring the time-dependent oil/water interfacial tension with the pendant
drop method. The observed effect can be explained by adsorption of the oil red
O molecules at the oil/water interface: the interfacial tension decreases
gradually after the interface formation, resulting in the dynamic deformation
of the droplet. The combination of the decrease in interfacial tension and the
decrease in driving force related to camphor outflow generates intermittent
motion with dynamic deformation into a crescent shape.

<h3>Edge State, Band Topology, and Time Boundary Effect in the Fine-Grained  Categorization of Chern Insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01167" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01167</a>
<br>
<i>H. C. Wu, H. S. Xu, L. C. Xie, L. Jin</i>
<p>We predict novel topological phases with broken time-reversal symmetry
supporting the coexistence of opposite chiral edge states, which are
fundamentally different from the photonic spin-Hall, valley-Hall, and
higher-order topological phases. We find a fine-grained categorization of Chern
insulators, their band topologies characterized by identical Chern number are
completely different. Furthermore, we prove that different topologies cause
zeros in their Bloch wavefunction overlaps, which imprint the band gap closing
and appear at the degenerate points of topological phase transition. The Bloch
wavefunction overlaps predict the reflection and refraction at a topological
time boundary, and the overlap zeros ensure the existence of vanishing revival
amplitude at critical times even though different topologies before and after
the time boundary have identical Chern number. Our findings create new
opportunities for topological metamaterials, uncover the topological feature
hidden in the time boundary effect as a probe of topology, and open a venue for
the exploration of the rich physics originating from the long-range couplings.

<p>3D Dirac semimetals with square-net non-symmorphic symmetry, such as ternary
ZrXY (X=Si, Ge; Y=S, Se, Te) compounds, have attracted significant attention
owing to the presence of topological nodal lines, loops, or networks in their
bulk. Orbital symmetry plays a profound role such materials as the different
branches of the nodal dispersion can be distinguished by their distinct orbital
symmetry eigenvalues. The presence of different eigenvalues suggests that
scattering between states of different orbital symmetry may be strongly
suppressed. Indeed, in ZrSiS, there has been no clear experimental evidence of
quasiparticle scattering between states of different symmetry eigenvalue has
been reported at small wave vector $q$. Here we show, using quasiparticle
interference (QPI), that atomic step-edges in the ZrSiS surface facilitate
quasiparticle scattering between states of different symmetry eigenvalues. This
symmetry eigenvalue mixing quasiparticle scattering is the first to be reported
for ZrSiS and contrasts quasiparticle scattering with no mixing of symmetry
eigenvalues, where the latter occurs with scatterers preserving the glide
mirror symmetry of the crystal lattice, e.g., native point defects in ZrSiS.
Finally, we show that the electronic structure of the ZrSiS surface, including
its unique floating band surface state (FBSS), can be tuned by a vertical
electric field locally applied by the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope
(STM), enabling control of a spin-orbit induced avoided crossing near the Fermi
level by as much as 300%.

<h3>Mechanism of ferromagnetism enhancement in a La$_{2/3}$ Sr$_{1/3}$  MnO$_3$ membrane released from epitaxial strain</h3>

<i>Takahito Takeda, Takuma Arai, Kohei Yamagami, Le Duc Anh, Masaaki Tanaka, Masaki Kobayashi, Shinobu Ohya</i>
<p>Recent studies have shown that the magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic
perovskite oxide La$_{2/3}$ Sr$_{1/3}$ MnO$_3$ (LSMO) grown on an SrTiO3 (STO)
substrate, such as its magnetic moment and Curie temperature, can be improved
by releasing the film from the substrate. However, the microscopic origin of
this enhancement is not yet well understood. In this study, we use synchrotron
radiation measurements to investigate the mechanism of ferromagnetism
enhancement in an LSMO membrane released from an STO substrate by dissolving a
water-soluble Sr$_4$Al$_2$O$_7$ buffer layer. Using resonant photoemission
spectroscopy on the as-grown LSMO film and LSMO membrane, we elucidate that the
strain release from the STO substrate enhances the itineracy of the Mn-3d
electrons via p-d hybridization, and this strengthens the double-exchange
interaction. The reinforcement of the double-exchange interaction, in turn,
improves the ferromagnetism of LSMO.

<p>Assembling two-dimensional van der Waals layered materials into
heterostructures is an exciting development that sparked the discovery of rich
correlated electronic phenomena and offers possibilities for designer device
applications. However, resist residue from fabrication processes is a major
limitation. Resulting disordered interfaces degrade device performance and mask
underlying transport physics. Conventional cleaning processes are inefficient
and can cause material and device damage. Here, we show that thermal scanning
probe based cleaning can effectively eliminate resist residue to recover
pristine material surfaces. Our technique is compatible at both the material-
and device-level, and we demonstrate the significant improvement in the
electrical performance of 2D WS2 transistors. We also demonstrate the cleaning
of van der Waals heterostructures to achieve interfaces with low disorder. This
enables the electrical formation and control of quantum dots that can be tuned
from macroscopic current flow to the single-electron tunnelling regime. Such
material processing advances are crucial for constructing high-quality vdW
heterostructures that are important platforms for fundamental studies and
building blocks for quantum and nano-electronics applications.

<p>Spins confined to point defects in atomically-thin semiconductors constitute
well-defined atomic-scale quantum systems that are being explored as single
photon emitters and spin qubits. Here, we investigate the in-gap electronic
structure of individual sulphur vacancies in molybdenum disulphide (MoS2)
monolayers using resonant tunneling scanning probe spectroscopy in the Coulomb
blockade regime. Spectroscopic mapping of defect wavefunctions reveals an
interplay of local symmetry breaking by a charge-state dependent Jahn-Teller
lattice distortion that, when combined with strong (~100 meV) spin-orbit
coupling, leads to a locking of an unpaired spin-1/2 magnetic moment to the
lattice at low temperature, susceptible to lattice strain. Our results provide
new insights into spin and electronic structure of vacancy induced in-gap
states towards their application as electrically and optically addressable
quantum systems.

<p>We successfully synthesized a verdazyl-based complex,
($p$-Py-V-$p$-CN)$_2$[Cu(hfac)$_2$]. Molecular orbital calculations reveal that
three types of antiferromagnetic (AF) interactions are involved in the
formation of a spin-1/2 distorted octagonal lattice composed of the verdazyl
radical and Cu spins. The magnetic properties of the compound exhibited
contributions from AF correlations and a phase transition to an AF ordered
state at approximately $T_{\rm{N}}$ = 2.5 K. Below $T_{\rm{N}}$, we observed a
$T^2$ dependence of the specific heat, indicating dominant two-dimensional AF
correlations within the octagonal lattice. The magnetization curve in the
low-temperature region exhibited a low-field linear increase, subsequent
bending at 1/3 magnetization, and high-field nonlinear increase. We reproduced
the observed unique magnetic behavior through the numerical analysis based on
the octagonal lattice. These results demonstrate that the present compound
exhibits magnetic properties characteristic of octagonal lattice topology.

<i>Surajit Mandal, Satyaki Kar</i>
<p>A chiral symmetric Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain features topological end
states in one of its dimerized configurations. Those mid-gap zero energy states
show interesting modifications upon a periodic tuning of the hopping
modulations. Besides, more and more in-gap end modes appear at nonzero energies
for further partitioning of the Brillouin zone due to increased hopping
periodicity. The new topological phases are identified with a detailed analysis
of the topological invariants namely, winding number and Zak phases. Spectra
and topology of these systems with periodically modulated hopping are studied
also in presence of a single static domain wall, separating two topologically
inequivalent dimerized structures. Lastly, we also study the effect of
disorder, particularly the chirality breaking onsite ones, on the edge and
domain wall states. The end solitons and domain wall solitons show noteworthy
evolutions with the variation of hopping periodicity. Our findings can add
important feedback in utilizing topological phases in various fields including
quantum computations and the results can be easily verified in a cold atom set

<h3>Light-induced phase transitions in vanadium dioxide: a tensor network  study</h3>

<i>Lin Zhang, Utso Bhattacharya, Maria Recasens, Tobias Grass, Ravindra W. Chhajlany, Maciej Lewenstein, Allan S. Johnson</i>
<p>Nonequilibrium phase transitions driven by light pulses represent a rapidly
developing field in condensed matter physics. As one of the archetypal strongly
correlated materials, vanadium dioxide (VO2) undergoes a structural phase
transition (SPT) from a monoclinic (M1) to rutile (R) structure and an
insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) either when heated above 340 K or when
excited by an ultrafast laser pulse. Here, we present a tensor network study of
the light-induced phase transitions in VO2 based on a quasi-one-dimensional
model with all the important ingredients -- multi-orbital character,
electron-lattice coupling, and electron-electron correlations -- being
included. We show that this model qualitatively captures the equilibrium
properties of VO2 by calculating the ground state phase diagram and
finite-temperature phase transitions. A hybrid quantum-classical tensor-network
method is used to simulate the dynamics following photoexcitation. We find that
the structure can transform faster than the harmonic phonon modes of M1 phase,
suggesting lattice nonlinearity is key in the SPT. We also find separate
timescales for the evolution of dimerization and tilt distortions in the
lattice dynamics, as well as the loss and subsequent partial restoration
behavior of the displacements, which can provide an explanation for the complex
dynamics observed in recent experiments [C. Brahms et al., arXiv:XXXX.XXXXX].
Moreover, decoupled SPT and IMT dynamics are observed in the numerical
simulations: while the initial M1 structure transforms to the R one in tens of
femtoseconds, the IMT occurs quasi-instantaneously, consistent with recent
experimental findings. Our theoretical studies provide insight into the
light-induced phase transitions of VO2, revealing unexpected non-monotonic
transformation pathways and paving the way for future studies of non-thermal
phase transformations.

<i>Onurcan Kaya, Hyeongjoon Kim, Byeongkyu Kim, Luigi Colombo, Hyeon-Jin Shin, Ivan Cole, Hyeon Suk Shin, Stephan Roche</i>
<p>This study focuses on amorphous boron nitride ($\rm \alpha$-BN) as a novel
diffusion barrier for advanced semiconductor technology, particularly
addressing the critical challenge of copper diffusion in back-end-of-logic
(BEOL) interconnects. Owing to its ultralow dielectric constant and robust
barrier properties, $\rm \alpha$-BN is examined as an alternative to
conventional low-k dielectrics. The investigation primarily employs theoretical
modeling, using a Gaussian Approximation Potential, to simulate and understand
the atomic-level interactions and barrier mechanisms of $\rm \alpha$-BN. This
machine learning-based approach allows for realistic simulations of its
amorphous structure, enabling the exploration of the impact of different film
morphologies on barrier efficacy. Complementing the theoretical study,
experimental analyses are conducted on Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor
Deposition (PECVD) grown $\rm \alpha$-BN films, evaluating their effectiveness
in preventing copper diffusion in silicon-based substrates. The results from
both the theoretical and experimental investigations highlight the potential of
$\rm \alpha$-BN as a highly effective diffusion barrier, suitable for
integration in nanoelectronics. This research not only proposes $\rm \alpha$-BN
as a promising candidate for BEOL interconnects but also demonstrates the
synergy of advanced computational models and experimental methods in material
innovation for semiconductor applications.

<p>Elucidating the emergence of long-range magnetic ordering from its precursor
short-range magnetic ordering (SRMO) in two-dimensional van der Waals materials
holds profound implications for fundamental research and technological
advancements. However, directly observing the intricate stages of this magnetic
dimensional crossover (MDC) remains a significant experimental challenge. While
magneto-elastic coupling offers a promising avenue, detecting the minute
lattice response to SRMO proves challenging. Recent investigations utilizing
second harmonic generation have unveiled a two-step MDC in a van der Waals
ferromagnetic insulator. However, an unambiguous detection of MDC through the
time-resolved techniques remains elusive. To meet this goal, we have executed
an alternative approach by employing picosecond acoustic strain pulses
generated by femtosecond lasers to probe the various stages of MDC through the
magneto-elastic coupling for the first time. By analyzing the shape of the
strain pulse in both the time and frequency domains as a function of
temperature, we clearly demonstrate the detection of the subtle influence of
spin fluctuations on the lattice. Additionally, the ultrafast carrier dynamics
also show signatures of MDC. Our measurements pave the way towards
characterizing magnetic materials in time-resolved experiments that are crucial
in designing a new generation of spin-based optoelectronic devices.

<p>The nature of the insulator-to-metal phase transition in vanadium dioxide
(VO2) is one of the longest-standing problems in condensed-matter physics.
Ultrafast spectroscopy has long promised to determine whether the transition is
primarily driven by the electronic or structural degree of freedom, but
measurements to date have been stymied by their sensitivity to only one of
these components and/or their limited temporal resolution. Here we use
ultra-broadband few-femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy to resolve the
electronic and structural phase transitions in VO2 at their fundamental time
scales. We find that the system transforms into a bad-metallic phase within 10
fs after photoexcitation, but requires another 100 fs to complete the
transition, during which we observe electronic oscillations and a partial
re-opening of the bandgap, signalling a transient semi-metallic state.
Comparisons with tensor-network simulations and density-functional theory
calculations show these features originate from oscillations around the
equilibrium high-symmetry atomic positions during an unprecedentedly fast
structural transition, in which the vanadium dimers separate and untwist with
two different timescales. Our results resolve the complete structural and
electronic nature of the light-induced phase transition in VO2 and establish
ultra-broadband few-femtosecond spectroscopy as a powerful new tool for
studying quantum materials out of equilibrium.

<h3>Nonconventional screening of Coulomb interaction in two-dimensional  semiconductors and metals: A comprehensive cRPA study of MX2 (M=Mo, W, Nb,  Ta; X=S, Se, Te)</h3>

<i>Hamid Reza Ramezani, Ersoy Sasioglu, Hanif Hadipour, Hamid Rahimpour Soleimani, Christoph Friedrich, Stefan Blugel, Ingrid Mertig</i>
<p>Experimental observations of large exciton binding energies and
non-hydrogenic Rydberg series in 2D semiconducting TMDs, along with deviations
in plasmon dispersion in 2D metallic TMDs, suggest the presence of a
nonconventional screening of the Coulomb interaction. The experimentally
observed Mott insulating state in the charge density wave (CDW) reconstructed
lattice of TMDs containing 4d and 5d elements further confirms the presence of
strong Coulomb interactions in these systems. In this study, we use
first-principles electronic structure calculations and constrained random-phase
approximation to calculate the Coulomb interaction parameters (partially
screened U and fully screened W) between localized $d$ electrons in 2D TMDs. We
specifically explore materials represented by the formula MX2 (M=Nb, Ta, Mo, W,
and X=S, Se, Te) and consider three different phases (1H, 1T, and 1T'). Our
results show that the short-range interactions are strongly screened in all
three phases, whereas the long-range interactions remain significant even in
metallic systems. This nonconventional screening provides a compelling
explanation for the deviations observed in the usual hydrogenic Rydberg series
and conventional plasmon dispersion in 2D semiconducting and metallic TMDs,
respectively. Our calculations yield on-site Coulomb interaction parameters U
within the ranges of 0.8-2.5 eV, 0.8-1.9 eV, and 0.9-2.4 eV for the 1H, 1T, and
1T' structures, respectively. Furthermore, our findings indicate a
substantially high ratio of on-site effective Coulomb interaction to bandwidth
(U_eff/W_b >> 1) in CDW TMDs, providing robust evidence for the experimentally
observed strongly correlated Mott phase.

self-consistency on the in-gap states produced by magnetic stuctures on
superconductors, specifically evaluating the density of states, the in-gap
bands, and their topological attributes. Here, we show results ranging from
single impurity to finite chains, and infinite ferromagnetic spin chains in
wide-band s-wave superconductors. These results show that the order parameter
contains important information regarding quantum phase transitions and their
topological nature, underscoring the importance of self-consistency in such

<br>
<i>Bar Alon, Roni Ilan, Moshe Goldstein</i>
<p>Berry phases have long been known to significantly alter the properties of
periodic systems, giving rise to anomalous terms in the semiclassical equations
of motion describing wave-packet dynamics. In non-Hermitian systems,
generalizations of the Berry connection have been proposed and shown to have
novel effects on dynamics and transport. In this work, we expand upon these
results by deriving the full set of semiclassical equations of motion for
wave-packet dynamics in a non-Hermitian system subject to complex external
electric fields, which are realizable as gain gradients. We show that the
non-Hermiticities of both the band Hamiltonian and the external potential give
rise to anomalous weight rate and velocity terms which depend on the geometric
properties of the eigenfunctions, including the quantum metric tensor. These
analytical results are compared with numerical lattice simulations which reveal
these anomalous terms even in one-dimension. Our work expands the range of
phenomena expected to be detectable in experimental setups, which should be
realizable in currently available metamaterials and classical wave systems,
including mechanical, acoustic, and optical.

<h3>A new universality class describes Vicsek's flocking phase in physical  dimensions</h3>

<i>Patrick Jentsch, Chiu Fan Lee</i>
<p>The Vicsek simulation model of flocking together with its theoretical
treatment by Toner and Tu in 1995 were two foundational cornerstones of active
matter physics. However, despite the field's tremendous progress, the actual
universality class (UC) governing the scaling behavior of Viscek's "flocking"
phase remains elusive. Here, we use nonperturbative, functional renormalization
group methods to analyze, numerically and analytically, a simplified version of
the Toner-Tu model, and uncover a novel UC with scaling exponents that agree
remarkably well with the values obtained in a recent simulation study by
Mahault et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 218001 (2019)], in both two and three
spatial dimensions. We therefore believe that there is strong evidence that the
UC uncovered here describes Vicsek's flocking phase.

<i>Lin Ma, Xiao-Dong Yang, Feng Yang, Xin-Jia Zhou, Zhen-Wei Wu</i>
<p>The early stage evolution of local atomic structures in a multicomponent
metallic glass during its crystallization process has been investigated via
molecular dynamics simulation. It is found that the initial thermal stability
and earliest stage evolution of the local atomic clusters show no strong
correlation with their initial short-range orders, and this leads to an
observation of a novel symmetry convergence phenomenon, which can be understood
as an atomic structure manifestation of the ergodicity. Furthermore, in our
system we have quantitatively proved that the crucial factor for the thermal
stability against crystallization exhibited by the metallic glass, is not the
total amount of icosahedral clusters, but the degree of global connectivity
among them.

<br>
<i>Amarjyoti Choudhury, T. Maitra</i>
<p>New materials with magnetic order driven topological phases are hugely sought
after for their immense application potential. In this work, we propose a new
compound EuMn$_2$Bi$_2$ from our first principles density functional theory
calculations to host novel topological phases such as Dirac/Weyl semimetal and
topological insulator in its different magnetic states which are energetically
close to one another. We started with an isostructural compound EuMn$_2$As$_2$
where the magnetic structure has been studied experimentally. From our
calculations we could explain the nature of two magnetic transitions observed
experimentally in this system and could also establish the correct magnetic
ground state. Our electronic structure calculations reveal the insulating
nature of the ground state consistent with the experiments. By replacing all As
by Bi in EuMn$_2$As$_2$ and by optimizing the new structure, we obtained the
new compound EuMn$_2$Bi$_2$. We observe this compound to be dynamically stable
from our phonon calculations supporting its experimental preparation in future.
By comparing the total energies of various possible magnetic structures we
identified the ground state. Though the magnetic ground state is found to be
insulating in nature with tiny band gap which is an order of magnitude less
than the same in EuMn$_2$As$_2$, there were other magnetic states energetically
very close to the ground state which display remarkable non-trivial band
topology such as Dirac/Weyl points close to the Fermi level and topological
insulator state. The energetic proximity of these magnetic order driven
topological phases makes them tunable via external handle which indicates that
the proposed new material EuMn$_2$Bi$_2$ would be a very versatile magnetic
topological material.

<i>Youngkyoung Bae, Seungwoong Ha, Hawoong Jeong</i>
<p>Pervasive across diverse domains, stochastic systems exhibit fluctuations in
processes ranging from molecular dynamics to climate phenomena. The Langevin
equation has served as a common mathematical model for studying such systems,
enabling predictions of their temporal evolution and analyses of thermodynamic
quantities, including absorbed heat, work done on the system, and entropy
production. However, inferring the Langevin equation from observed trajectories
remains challenging, particularly for nonlinear and high-dimensional systems.
In this study, we present a comprehensive framework that employs Bayesian
neural networks for inferring Langevin equations in both overdamped and
underdamped regimes. Our framework first provides the drift force and diffusion
matrix separately and then combines them to construct the Langevin equation. By
providing a distribution of predictions instead of a single value, our approach
allows us to assess prediction uncertainties, which can prevent potential
misunderstandings and erroneous decisions about the system. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework in inferring Langevin equations for various
scenarios including a neuron model and microscopic engine, highlighting its
versatility and potential impact.

<h3>Quantum Griffiths singularity in three-dimensional MoTiN superconducting  films</h3>

<br>
<i>Zi-Xiao Wang, Tian-Yu Jing, Zi-Yan Han, Kuang-Hong Gao, Song-Ci Li, Zhi-Qing Li</i>
<p>Quantum Griffiths singularity (QGS) has been experimentally observed in a
range of two-dimensional (2D) superconducting systems. Although it is
theoretically suggested that the QGS also exists in three-dimensional (3D)
superconductors, there is almost no experimental support to the theoretical
prediction. In the present paper, we observe the occurrence of QGS in a series
of $\sim$80-nm-thick Mo$_{0.8}$Ti$_{0.2}$N$_x$ ($0.84 \lesssim x \lesssim
1.12$) superconducting films near the field-driven superconductor-metal
transition (SMT). These films have a NaCl structure and are 3D with respect to
the superconductivity. For each film, the low-temperature magnetoresistance
isotherms, measured at magnetic fields being perpendicular or parallel to the
film plane, do not cross at a single point but at a clear wide region. The
dynamical critical exponents $z\nu_{\perp}$ (for perpendicular field) and
$z\nu_{\parallel}$ (for parallel field) obtained by analyzing the related
magnetoresistance isotherms increase with decreasing temperature and tend to
diverge as $T\rightarrow 0$ K. In addition, the effective resistivity data for
the perpendicular and parallel field in the vicinity of the SMTs both obey an
activated scaling based on the random transverse-field Ising model. We also
fabricate a $\sim$80-nm-thick (Mo$_{0.8}$Ti$_{0.2}$)$_2$N$_{1.06}$
superconducting film with face-centered cubic structure at low nitrogen partial
pressure. It is found that the low-temperature magnetoresistance isotherms for
the perpendicular (parallel) field cross at a single point and the resistivity
data for the perpendicular (parallel) field in the vicinity of the
field-induced SMT obey the power-law scaling deduced from the dirty-boson
model. Our results provide unambigous experimental evidence for the existence
of QGS in 3D superconductors.

<h3>Catching thermal avalanches in disordered XXZ model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01362" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01362</a>
<br>
<i>Tomasz Szołdra, Piotr Sierant, Maciej Lewenstein, Jakub Zakrzewski</i>
<p>We study the XXZ model with a random magnetic field in contact with a weakly
disordered spin chain, acting as a finite thermal bath. We revise Fermi's
golden rule description of the interaction between the thermal bath and the XXZ
spin chain, contrasting it with a non-perturbative quantum avalanche scenario
for the thermalization of the system. We employ two-point correlation functions
to define the extent, $\xi_d$, of the thermalized region next to the bath.
Unbounded growth of $\xi_d$ proportional to the logarithm of time or faster is
a signature of an avalanche. It signifies the thermalization of the system, as
we confirm numerically for a generic initial state in the ergodic and critical
regimes of the XXZ spin chain. In the many-body localized regime, a clear
termination of avalanches is observed for specifically prepared initial states
and, surprisingly, is not visible for generic initial product states.
Additionally, we extract the localization length of the local integrals of
motion and show that a bath made out of a weakly disordered XXZ chain has a
similar effect on the system as a bath modeled by a Hamiltonian from a Gaussian
Orthogonal Ensemble of random matrices. We also comment on the result of the
earlier study (Phys. Rev. B 108, L020201 (2023)), arguing that the observed
thermalization is due to external driving of the system and does not occur in
the autonomous model. Our work reveals experimentally accessible signatures of
quantum avalanches and identifies conditions under which termination of the
avalanches may be observed.

analyzed. Among these three composition parameters, the alumina dopant and
especially the Ni content appear to have by far a much more pronounced effect
on both the CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity as compared to the Ce-Pr mixed

<p>Although BiFeO$_3$ is one of the most studied multiferroic materials, recent
magnetization and neutron scattering studies have revealed a new magnetic phase

excitations of this phase, we performed THz spectroscopy in magnetic fields up
to 17 T at and above room temperature. We observed five spin-wave branches in
the magnetic phase with long wavelength conical modulation. Using a numerical
spin dynamics model we found two kinds of excitations with magnetic moments
oscillating either along or perpendicular to the static fields. Remarkably, we
detected strong directional dichroism, an optical manifestation of the
magnetoelectric effect, for two spin-wave modes of the conical phase. According
to our experiments, the stability of the conical state is sensitive to the
magnetic field history and it can become (meta)stable at or close to zero
magnetic field, which may allow exploiting its magnetoelectric properties at
room temperature.

<i>Lyuzhou Ye, Xiao Zheng, Xin Xu</i>
<p>The combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and electron spin
resonance (ESR) has emerged as a powerful and innovative tool for detecting
spin excitations and spin-spin interactions in surface-adsorbed atoms and
molecules. However, the origin of the STM-ESR signal and the underlying
mechanisms behind the important features of the measured spectra have remained
elusive. To address this perplexity, we perform precise numerical simulations
of STM-ESR spectra for a single Ti adatom and a Ti dimer, achieving excellent
agreement with experimental observations. We further develop an analytic theory
that elucidates the origin of the signal as well as the essential features in
the measured spectra. These theoretical insights establish a solid foundation
for the on-demand detection and manipulation of atomic-scale spin states, with
promising implications for cutting-edge applications in spin sensing, quantum
information, and quantum computing.

<p>Nickel (II) oxide, NiO, a wide band gap Mott insulator characterized by
strong Coulomb repulsion between d-electrons and displaying antiferromagnetic
order at room temperature, has gained attention in recent years as a very
promising candidate for applications in a broad set of areas, including
chemistry and metallurgy to spintronics and energy harvesting. Here, we report
on the synthesis of polycrystalline NiO fabricated using spray-pyrolysis
technique, which is a deposition technique able to produce quite uniform films
of pure and crystalline materials without the need of high vacuum or inert
atmospheres. We then characterized the composition and structure of our NiO
thin films using X-ray diffraction, and atomic force and scanning electron
microscopies, respectively. We completed our study by looking at the phononic
and magnonic properties of our NiO thin films via Raman spectroscopy, and at
the ultrafast electron dynamics by using optical pump probe spectroscopy. We
found that our NiO samples display the same phononic and magnonic dispersion
expected for single crystal NiO at room temperature, and that electron dynamics
in our system is similar to those of previously reported NiO mono- and
poli-crystalline systems synthesized with different techniques. These results
prove that spray-pyrolysis can be used as affordable and large-scale
fabrication technique to synthetize strongly correlated materials for a large
set of applications.

<i>Lukas Rødland, Carlos Ortega-Taberner, Megha Agarwal, Maria Hermanns</i>
<p>We study the effect of disorder on Z$_2$ quantum spin liquids with a Majorana
Fermi line (respectively surface in three dimensions) and show that depending
on the symmetries that are preserved \emph{on average} qualitatively different
scenarios will occur.
In particular, we identify the relevant non-Hermitian symmetries for which
disorder will effectively split the Fermi line into two exceptional lines, with
$\Re(E)=0$ states filling the area in between. We demonstrate the different
scenarios using both toy models as well as large-scale numerical simulations.

<h3>A momentum-resolved view of polaron formation in materials</h3>

<br>
<i>Tristan L Britt, Fabio Caruso, Bradley J Siwick</i>
<p>A combined experimental and computational methodology for interrogating the
phonon contribution to polaron formation in real materials is developed. Using
LiF as an example, we show that the recent ab-initio theory of Sio et. al [PRL
122, 246403 (2019)] makes predictions of the momentum- and branch dependent
phonon amplitides in polaron quasiparticles that are testable using ultrafast
electron diffuse scattering (UEDS) and related techniques. The large electron
polaron in LiF has UEDS signatures that are qualitatively similar to those
expected from a simple point-defect model, but the small hole polaron exhibits
a profoundly anisotropic UEDS pattern that is in poor agreement with a
point-defect model. We also show that these polaron diffuse scattering
signatures are directly emblematic of the underlying polaron wavefunction. The
combination of new time and momentum resolved experimental probes of
nonequilibrium phonons with novel computational methods promises to complement
the qualitative results obtained via model Hamiltonians with a first
principles, material-specific quantiative understanding of polarons and their
properties.

<h3>Intrinsic orbital fourfold anisotropic magnetoresistance in Dirac  materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01470" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01470</a>
<br>
<i>Daifeng Tu, Can Wang, Jianhui Zhou</i>
<p>Fourfold anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) have been widely observed in
quantum materials, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here
we find, in a variety of three-dimensional Dirac materials that can be
unifiedly described by the massive Dirac equation, the intrinsic orbital
magnetic moment of electrons vary synchronously with the magnetic field and
give rise to a {\pi} periodic correction to its velocity, further leading to
unusual fourfold AMR, dubbed intrinsic orbital fourfold AMR. Our theory not
only explains the observation of fourfold AMR in bismuth but also uncovers the
nature of the dominant fourfold AMR in thin films of antiferromagnetic
topological insulator MnBi2Te4, which arises from the near cancellation of the
twofold AMR from the surface states and bulk states due to distinct
spin-momentum lockings. Our work provides a new mechanism for creation and
manipulation of intrinsic fourfold AMR in both conventional conductors and
various topological insulators.

<p>A recent mathematical framework for optimizing resistor networks to achieve
values in the M{\Omega} through G{\Omega} levels was employed for two specific
cases. Objectives here include proof of concept and identification of possible
apparatus limitations for future experiments involving graphene-based quantum
Hall array resistance standards. Using fractal-like, or recursive, features of
the framework allows one to calculate and implement network designs with
substantially lower-valued resistors. The cases of 100 M{\Omega} and 1
G{\Omega} demonstrate that, theoretically, one would not need more than 100
quantum Hall elements to achieve these high resistances.

<br>
<i>Vineet Kumar Sharma, Alana Okullo, Jalen Garner, Cheng Peng, Rajan Plumley, Adrian Feiguin, Chunjing Jia, Josh Turner, A. Bansil, Sugata Chowdhury</i>
<p>Recent years have witnessed an enormous rise in research interest in magnetic
skyrmions owing to their capability to improve over contemporary spintronic
devices. An overview of the various magnetic interactions responsible for the
formation of skyrmion together with distinct noncentrosymmetric and
centrosymmetric skyrmion candidates is given in this review article. The
magnetic interactions known as Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) have
been extensively studied over the years to better understand the mechanism of
skyrmions in chiral magnets that have larger skyrmion sizes. Because of their
low skyrmion size, the centrosymmetric frustrated magnets are dwelling to
skyrmions controlled by long-range interactions such as the
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction (RKKY), which may be useful in the
development of high density memory devices. To lay a solid foundation for the
magnetic interactions involved in skyrmion formations and many other special
physical properties, more research in the field of centrosymmetric skyrmions is
required. Apart from studying candidates with low skyrmion sizes, one of the
main goals for the future is to better understand the dynamics of skyrmion
using polarized magnons, which has the potential to be extremely beneficial for
spintronic applications.

<i>Farhan Islam, Deborah Schlagel, Yongbin Lee, Santanu Pakhira, Daniel M. Pajerowski, David C. Johnston, Liqin Ke, David Vaknin, Robert J. McQueeney</i>
<p>The addition of magnetic impurities in topological insulators can drive
ferromagnetic order that leads to novel quantum anomalous Hall transport well
below the Curie temperature. The fragility of the quantized regime has been
ascribed to the random nature of the magnetic moment distribution. Here, we
refine this hypothesis by using inelastic neutron scattering and
density-functional theory calculations to show that two antagonistic components
define the magnetism in Mn-substituted SnTe, thereby limiting the effectiveness
of dilute magnetic TIs. One component is strongly bound antiferromagnetic
dimers that compete with ferromagnetic order. The other component consists of
undimerized moments where ferromagnetic order develops via long-range
interactions.

<i>Juan Sánchez-Baena, Thomas Pohl, Fabian Maucher</i>
<p>We analyse the finite-temperature phase diagram of a dipolar Bose Einstein
Condensate confined in a tubular geometry. The effect of thermal fluctuations
is accounted for by means of Bogoliubov theory employing the local density
approximation. In the considered geometry, the superfluid-supersolid phase
transition can be of first- and second-order. We discuss how the corresponding
transition point is affected by the finite temperature of the system.

<h3>Q-factor: A measure of competition between the topper and the average in  percolation and in SOC</h3>

<br>
<i>Asim Ghosh, S. S. Manna, Bikas K. Chakrabarti</i>
<p>We define the $Q$-factor in the percolation problem as the quotient of the
size of the
largest cluster and the average size of all clusters. As the occupation
probability $p$
is increased, the $Q$-factor for the system size $L$ grows systematically to
its maximum
value $Q_{max}(L)$ at a specific value $p_{max}(L)$ and then gradually
decays. Our numerical
study of site percolation problems on the square, triangular and the simple
cubic lattices
exhibits that the asymptotic values of $p_{max}$ though close, are distinctly
different
from the corresponding percolation thresholds of these lattices. We have also
shown using
the scaling analysis that at $p_{max}$ the value of $Q_{max}(L)$ diverges as
$L^d$ ($d$
denoting the dimension of the lattice) as the system size approaches to their
asymptotic
limit. We have further extended this idea to the non-equilibrium systems such
as the
sandpile model of self-organized criticality. Here, the $Q(\rho,L)$-factor is
the quotient
of the size of the largest avalanche and the cumulative average of the sizes
of all the
avalanches; $\rho$ being the drop density of the driving mechanism. This
study has been
prompted by some observations in Sociophysics.

<h3>Theory of acoustic-phonon involved exciton spin flip in perovskite  semiconductors</h3>

<br>
<i>A.V. Rodina, E.L. Ivchenko</i>
<p>We present a theory of the acoustic phonon assisted spin-flip Raman
scattering (SFRS), or resonant photoluminescence with the spin flip of a
photoexcited exciton localized in a bulk cubic-phase perovskite semiconductor.
We consider the spin-flip transitions between the ground-state exciton spin
sublevels in external magnetic field B and discuss the variation of their
probability rate and polarization selection rules with the increase of B. The
transitions are treated as two-quantum processes with the virtual to and fro
transfer of the electron in the electron-hole pair between the bottom and first
excited conduction bands. The transfer occurs due to both the electron-hole
exchange interaction and the electron-phonon interaction. The theoretical
results allow one to distinguish the phonon assisted Raman scattering from (a)
the resonant Raman scattering with the combined spin flip of the localized
resident electron and hole and (b) the biexciton-mediated SFRS analyzed
previously.

<h3>Resolution dependence of most probable pathways with state-dependent  diffusivity</h3>

<br>
<i>Alice L. Thorneywork, Jannes Gladrow, Ulrich F. Keyser, Michael E. Cates, Ronojoy Adhikari, Julian Kappler</i>
<p>Recent experiments have probed the relative likelihoods of trajectories in
stochastic systems by observing survival probabilities within a tube of radius
$R$ in spacetime. We measure such probabilities here for a colloidal particle
in a corrugated channel, corresponding to a bistable potential with
state-dependent diffusivity. In contrast to previous findings for
state-independent noise, we find that the most probable pathway changes
qualitatively as the tube radius $R$ is altered. We explain this by computing
the survival probabilities predicted by overdamped Langevin dynamics. At high
enough resolution (small enough $R$), survival probabilities depend solely on
diffusivity variations, independent of deterministic forces; finite $R$
corrections yield a generalization of the Onsager-Machlup action. As corollary,
ratios of survival probabilities are singular as $R \to 0$, but become regular,
and described by the classical Onsager-Machlup action, only in the special case
of state-independent noise.

<p>We present muon spin rotation and relaxation ($\mu$SR) results for
chalcogenide spinels CuCr$_2$X$_4$ with X= S and Se. Both compounds are known
as ferromagnetic metals with high Curie temperatures. Our $\mu$SR and
magnetization data show clear signatures for additional magnetic transitions
far below the respective Curie temperatures. They can be related to changes in
the Cr valence system from the mixed valence between Cr$^{3+}$ and Cr$^{4+}$ at
high temperatures and collinear ferromagnetism to a charge-ordered state at low
temperatures with a conical or even more complex structure. Our results
demonstrate that the electronic systems and the related spin structures of both
compounds are more complex than assumed so far.

<h3>Switching of Magnetization in Quantum Antiferromagnets with  Time-Dependent Control Fields</h3>

<br>
<i>Asliddin Khudoyberdiev, Götz S. Uhrig</i>
<p>Ultrafast manipulation of magnetic states is one of the necessities in modern
data storage technology. Quantum antiferromagnets are promising candidates in
this respect. The orientation of the order parameter, the sublattice
magnetization, can be used to encode "0" and "1" of a bit. Then, the switching
of magnetization and the full control of its reorientation are crucial for
writing data. We show that the magnetization can be switched efficiently by an
external short THz pulses with relatively low amplitude. The coupling to the
spin degrees can be direct via the magnetic field or indirect via the electric
field inducing spin-polarized charge currents. Our description is based on
time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory which includes the intrinsic
dephasing mechanisms beyond a macrospin description. The findings help to
introduce the use of antiferromagnets in data storage technology.

<h3>Controllable frequency tunability and parabolic-like threshold current  behavior in spin Hall nano-oscillators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01570" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01570</a>
<br>
<i>Arunima TM, Himanshu Fulara</i>
<p>We investigate the individual impacts of critical magnetodynamical
parameters-effective magnetization and magnetic damping-on the auto-oscillation
characteristics of nano-constriction-based Spin Hall Nano-Oscillators (SHNOs).
Our micromagnetic simulations unveil a distinctive non-monotonic relationship
between current and auto-oscillation frequency in out-of-plane magnetic fields.
The influence of effective magnetization on frequency tunability varies with
out-of-plane field strengths. At large out-of-plane fields, the frequency
tunability is predominantly governed by effective magnetization, achieving a
current tunability of 1 GHz/mA-four times larger than that observed at the
lowest effective magnetization. Conversely, at low out-of-plane fields,
although a remarkably high-frequency tunability of 4 GHz/mA is observed, the
effective magnetization alters the onset of the transition from a linear-like
mode to a spin-wave bullet mode. Magnetic damping primarily affects the
threshold current with negligible impact on auto-oscillation frequency
tunability. The threshold current scales linearly with increased magnetic
damping at a constant out-of-plane field but exhibits a parabolic behavior with
variations in out-of-plane fields. This behavior is attributed to the
qualitatively distinct evolution of the auto-oscillation mode across different
out-of-plane field values. Our study not only extends the versatility of SHNOs
for oscillator-based neuromorphic computing with controllable frequency
tunability but also unveils the intricate auto-oscillation dynamics in
out-of-plane fields.

<h3>Predictive Models based on Deep Learning Algorithms for Tensile  Deformation of AlCoCuCrFeNi High-entropy alloy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01578" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01578</a>
<br>
<i>Hoang-Giang Nguyen, Thanh-Dung Le</i>
<p>High-entropy alloys (HEAs) stand out between multi-component alloys due to
their attractive microstructures and mechanical properties. In this
investigation, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and machine learning were
used to ascertain the deformation mechanism of AlCoCuCrFeNi HEAs under the
influence of temperature, strain rate, and grain sizes. First, the MD
simulation shows that the yield stress decreases significantly as the strain
and temperature increase. In other cases, changes in strain rate and grain size
have less effect on mechanical properties than changes in strain and
temperature. The alloys exhibited superplastic behavior under all test
conditions. The deformity mechanism discloses that strain and temperature are
the main sources of beginning strain, and the shear bands move along the
uniaxial tensile axis inside the workpiece. Furthermore, the fast phase shift
of inclusion under mild strain indicates the relative instability of the
inclusion phase of HCP. Ultimately, the dislocation evolution mechanism shows
that the dislocations are transported to free surfaces under increased strain
when they nucleate around the grain boundary. Surprisingly, the ML prediction
results also confirm the same characteristics as those confirmed from the MD
simulation. Hence, the combination of MD and ML reinforces the confidence in
the findings of mechanical characteristics of HEA. Consequently, this
combination fills the gaps between MD and ML, which can significantly save time
human power and cost to conduct real experiments for testing HEA deformation in
practice.

<br>
<i>G. O. Heymans, N. F. Svaiter, B. F. Svaiter, G. Krein</i>
<p>Critical Casimir effect appears when critical fluctuations of an order
parameter interact with classical boundaries. We investigate this effect in the
setting of a Landau-Ginzburg model with continuous symmetry in the presence of
quenched disorder. The quenched free energy is written as an asymptotic series
of moments of the models partition function. Our main result is that, in the
presence of a strong disorder, Goldstone modes of the system contribute either
with an attractive or with a repulsive force. This result was obtained using
the distributional zeta-function method without relying on any particular
ansatz in the functional space of the moments of the partition function.

<h3>Revealing crucial effects of reservoir environment and hydrocarbon  fractions on fluid behaviour in kaolinite pores</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01633" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01633</a>
<br>
<i>Rixin Zhao, Haitao Xue, Shuangfang Lu, H. Chris Greenwell, Valentina Erastova</i>
<p>Interactions of hydrocarbons (HCs) and clay surfaces are responsible for
fluid behaviour within shale reservoirs. These interactions are affected by the
diversity of HC components and the variations in environmental conditions. This
study examines the interactions between kaolinite clay, featuring two distinct
basal surfaces, and an array of HCs. We assess the impact of various molecular
structures, functional groups, and environmental conditions (focusing on the
reservoir temperature and pressure ranges) on the adsorption selectivity,
surface packing, molecular alignment and orientation, and diffusion of HCs.
Analyses of molecular interaction energies provide a quantitative elucidation
of the adsorption mechanisms of HCs on the different kaolinite surfaces. Our
findings suggest that molecular configuration, functional groups, and spatial
effects dictate the distribution patterns of HCs for the different kaolinite
surfaces. The differences in the interaction energy between various HCs with
kaolinite reveal the adsorption strength of different HCs in the order of
asphaltenes>heteroatomic HCs>saturated HCs>aromatic HCs. Furthermore, we
observe that the adsorptive characteristics are highly temperature-sensitive;
with increased temperatures markedly reducing the adsorption amount. Beyond a
certain threshold, the effect of pressure rise on the fluid behaviour of HCs is
non-negligible and is related to molecular packing and reduced mobility.
Simulation results based on actual geological characteristics demonstrate
notable adsorption disparities among hydrocarbon components on different
kaolinite surfaces, influenced by competitive adsorption and clay surface
interactions. Polar surfaces are predominantly occupied by heteroatomic HCs,
whereas on non-polar surfaces, asphaltenes and heavy saturated HCs develop
multi-layer adsorption structures, with molecules aligned parallel to the
surface.

<h3>Dynamics of Onsager vortex clustering in decaying turbulent polariton  quantum fluids</h3>

<br>
<i>P. Comaron, R. Panico, D. Ballarini, M. Matuszewski</i>
<p>We investigate the turbulent properties of a confined driven-dissipative
polariton quantum fluid after a pulsed excitation. Using numerical simulations,
we provide insight into the vortex clustering processes that emerge during the
relaxation dynamics of the initially injected vortex cloud. A confrontation
between conservative and non-conservative dynamics reveals that the onset of
clusterization strongly depends on the interplay between the different
characteristic system lengths and time scales at stake, with an additional time
scale due to dissipation in the non-conservative case. Quantification of the
clustering observables allows us to numerically characterize the optimal
conditions for observing Onsager condensation in decaying polariton systems,
demonstrating its experimental reachability under pulse excitation. These
findings hold significance for exploring the onset of turbulent dynamics in
open systems, spanning both classical and quantum domains.
