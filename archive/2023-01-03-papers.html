<h3>Orbital Hall physics in two-dimensional Dirac materials</h3>

Orbitronics has recently emerged as a very active research topic after
several proposals aiming to exploit the orbital degree of freedom for
charge-free electronics. In this communication, we investigate orbital
transport in selected two-dimensional systems to better understand which
parameters govern the intra-atomic and inter-atomic contributions to the
orbital Hall effect. We study the impact of the gap, the role of the materials'
topology and the influence of the disorder on spin and orbital Hall transport.
Starting from the Kane-Mele model, we describe how the orbital moment behaves
depending on the material's topology and clarify the influence of the gap on
the orbital Hall conductivity. We then extend the study to realistic
topologically trivial and non-trivial materials, and find that the topology has
little qualitative influence on the orbital Hall conductivity. In contrast, we
observe that the energy dispersion has a more dramatic impact, especially in
the presence of disorder. Remarkably, our results suggest that the intra-atomic
orbital Hall current is more robust against scattering than the inter-atomic
one, without further impact of the topological properties of the system under
consideration.

<h3>The Fermi-Dirac staircase occupation of Floquet bands and current  rectification inside the optical gap of metals: a rigorous perspective</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00811" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00811</a>

We consider a model of a Bloch band subjected to an oscillating electric
field and coupled to a featureless fermionic heat bath, which can be solved
exactly. We demonstrate rigorously that in the limit of vanishing coupling to
this bath (so that it acts as an ideal thermodynamic bath) the occupation of
the Floquet band is not a simple Fermi-Dirac distribution function of the
Floquet energy, but instead it becomes a ``staircase'' version of this
distribution. We show that this distribution generically leads to a finite
rectified electric current within the optical gap of a metal even in the limit
of vanishing carrier relaxation rates, providing a rigorous demonstration that
such rectification is generically possible and clarifying previous statements
in the optoelectronics literature. We show that this current remains non-zero
even up to the leading perturbative second order in the amplitude of electric
fields, and that it approaches the standard perturbative expression of the Jerk
current obtained from a simpler Boltzmann description within a relaxation time
approximation when the frequencies are small compared to the bandwidth.

<h3>A Generic Topological Criterion for Flat Bands in Two Dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00824" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00824</a>

Mutually distorted layers of graphene give rise to a moir\'e pattern and a
variety of non-trivial phenomena. We show that the continuum limit of this
class of models is equivalent to a (2+1)-dimensional field theory of Dirac
fermions coupled to two classical gauge fields. We further show that the
existence of a flat band implies an effective dimensional reduction in the
field theory, where the time dimension is ``removed.'' The resulting
two-dimensional Euclidean theory contains the chiral anomaly. The associated
Atiyah-Singer index theorem provides a self-consistency condition for the
existence of flat bands. In particular, it reproduces a series of quantized
magic angles known to exist in twisted bilayer graphene in the chiral limit
where there is a particle-hole symmetry. We also use this criterion to prove
that an external magnetic field splits this series into pairs of magnetic
field-dependent magic angles associated with flat moir\'e-Landau bands. The
topological criterion we derive provides a generic practical method for finding
flat bands in a variety of material systems including but not limited to
moir\'e bilayers.

<h3>Dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems with long range  interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00829" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00829</a>
<br>
<i>Menghan Song, Jiarui Zhao, Chengkang Zhou, Zi Yang Meng</i>
<br>
<br>
Employing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we systematically
compute the energy spectra of the 2D spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with long-range
interactions. With the $1/r^{\alpha}$ ferromagnetic and staggered
antiferromagnetic interactions, we find the explicit range in $\alpha$ for the
Goldstone-type (gapless) and Higgs-type (gapped) spectra. Accompanied with the
spin wave analysis, our results vividly reveal how the long-range interactions
induce a mass to the Goldstone mode via the generalized Higgs mechanism. This
work provides the first set of unbiased dynamical properties of long-range
quantum many-body systems and suggest that many universally accepted low-energy
customs for short-range systems need to be substantially modified for
long-range ones which are of immediate relevance to the on-going experimental
efforts from quantum simulators to 2D quantum moir\'e materials.

<h3>Theory of Fractional Quantum Hall States of the $\mathcal{A}$-phase in  the Second Landau Level</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00850" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00850</a>
<br>
<i>Sudipto Das, Sahana Das, Sudhansu S. Mandal</i>
<br>
<br>
A proposal of the existence of an {\em Anomalous} phase ($\mathcal{A}$-phase)
at the experimental range of moderate Landau-level-mixing strength has recently
been made for $5/2$ state. We here report that the gapped $\mathcal{A}$-phase
is generic to the sequence of spin-polarized fractional quantum Hall states
with filling fractions $\nu = n/(nm-1)$ and $\nu = 1-n/(nm-1)$, $(n \geqslant
1,\,m\geqslant 3)$, thereby predicting several other states in addition to the
observed ones in the second Landau level for GaAs systems. Our proposed trial
wave functions for all these states have remarkably high overlaps with the
corresponding exact ground states and can support non-Abelian quasiparticle
excitations with charge $e/[2(nm-1)]$. By analyzing edge modes, we predict
experimentally verifiable thermal Hall conductance $2.5(\pi^2 k_B^2T/3h)$ for
all the states in these sequences.

<h3>On the existence of an intermediate phase in the antiferromagnetic Ising  model on an face-centered cubic lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00869" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00869</a>
<br>
<i>Graeme J Ackland</i>
<br>
<br>
We use Monte Carlo simulation to determine the stable structures in the
second-neighbour Ising model on the face-centred cubic lattice. Those
structures are L1$_1$ for strongly antiferromagnetic second neighbour
interactions and L1$_0$ for ferromagnetic and weakly antiferromagnetic second
neighbours. We find a third stable "intermediate" antiferromagnetic phase with
I4$_1$/amd symmetry, and calculate the paramagnetic transition temperature for
each.
The transition temperature depends strongly on second neighbour interactions
which are not frustrated. Our results contradict a recent paper, which also
reported two different AFM structures and a new "intermediate" phase exists in
this system. Here we show that the assumed sublattice structure in is
inconsistent with the ground state. We determine a sublattice structure
suitable for solving this problem with mean field theory.

Nanometer copper ferrite, as a kind of nanometer particle with catalytic
activity, and its photothermal and magnetothermal effects as ferrite, can be
widely used in different fields. It is a general way to obtain the nano effect
of the target by controlling the particle size. In this paper, the
crystallization process of hydrothermal/solvothermal synthesis was analyzed,
and the nucleation model was established to simulate the effects of solvent,
reaction temperature and cooling time on the particle size of copper ferrite
nanoparticles. Through Monte Carlo method and energy function, the ratio of
nano particle agglomeration was established, and the influence of different
reaction conditions on it was discussed.

<h3>Effects of opposite atoms on electronic structure and optical absorption  of two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00906" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00906</a>
<br>
<i>You-Zhao Lan</i>
<br>
<br>
We perform the first-principles many-body GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation
(BSE) calculations on the two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (2D-hBN) to
explore the effects of opposite atoms on the electronic structure and linear
one-photon absorption (OPA). Five AA- and AB-stacked bilayer and eight
AAB-stacked trilayer structures are considered. The AAB-stacked trilayer hBN
(TL-BN) structures are constructed by mixing the AA- and AB-stacked bilayer hBN
(BL-BN). We show that the GW approximation gives rise to different types (i.e.,
indirect or direct) of fundamental band gaps from the independent particle
approximation for all structures except those dominated by the B-B opposite.
The stacking modes dominated by the B-B opposite have a direct fundamental band
gap in both approximations. The OPA spectra are calculated by solving the
Bethe-Salpeter equation combined with the GW quasi-particle correction. Strong
absorption peaks are found for most structures in the deep-ultraviolet region.
The binding energy and Davydov splitting of excitons of TL-BN strongly depend
on the opposite atoms and are related to the role of the stacking BL-BN
substructure. Finally, taking the six-layer and below AB-stacked structures as
examples, we show that the B-B opposite unit is helpful in constructing the
turbostratic-phase-like stacking structures with a direct fundamental band gap
which are more suitable for optoelectronic applications.

<h3>Scale-dependent elasticity as a probe of universal heterogeneity in  equilibrium amorphous solids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00907" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00907</a>
<br>
<i>Boli Zhou, Rafael Hipolito, Paul M. Goldbart</i>
<br>
<br>
The equilibrium amorphous solid state -- formed, e.g., by adequately randomly
crosslinking the constituents of a macromolecular fluid -- is a heterogeneous
state characterized by a universal distribution of particle localization
lengths. Near to the crosslink-density-controlled continuous
amorphous-solidification transition, this distribution obeys a scaling form: it
has a single peak at a lengthscale that diverges (along with the width of the
distribution) as the transition is approached. The modulus controlling
macroscale elastic shear deformations of the amorphous solid does not depend on
the distribution of localization lengths. However, it is natural to anticipate
that for deformations at progressively shorter lengthscales -- mesoscale
deformations -- the effective modulus exhibits a scale-dependence, softening as
the deformation lengthscale is reduced. This is because an increasing fraction
of the localized particles are, in effect, liquid-like at the deformation
lengthscale, and therefore less effective at contributing to the elastic
response. In this paper, the relationship between the distribution of
localization lengths and the scale-dependent elastic shear modulus is explored,
and it is shown, within the setting of a replica mean-field theory, that the
effective modulus does indeed exhibit scale-dependent softening. Through this
softening, mesoscale elasticity provides a probe of the heterogeneity of the
state as characterized by the distribution of localization lengths. In
particular, the response to short-lengthscale elastic deformations is shown to
shed light on the asymptotics of the universal localization-length distribution
at short localization lengths.

Constitutive relations are fundamental and essential to characterize physical
systems. By utilizing the $\kappa$-deformed functions, some constitutive
relations are generalized. We here show some applications of the Kaniadakis
distributions based on the inverse hyperbolic sine function to some topics
belonging to the realm of statistical physics and natural science.

<h3>Anomalous circular phonon dichroism in transition metal dichalcogenides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00917" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00917</a>
<br>
<i>Wen-Yu Shan</i>
<br>
<br>
A magnetic field can generally induce circular phonon dichroism based on the
formation of Landau levels of electrons. Here, we study the
magnetization-induced circular phonon dichroism in transition metal
dichalcogenides, without forming Landau levels. We find that, instead of the
conventional deformation potential coupling, pseudogauge-type electron-phonon
coupling plays an essential role in the emergence of the phenomenon. As a
concrete example, a large dichroism signal is obtained in monolayer MoTe2 on a
EuO substrate, even without considering Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Due to the
two-dimensional spin-valley-coupled band structure, MoTe2 shows a reciprocal
and nonreciprocal absorption of circularly polarized acoustic phonons upon
reversing the direction of phonon propagation and magnetization, respectively.
By varying the gate voltage, a tunable circular phonon dichroism can be
realized, which paves a way toward different physics and applications of
two-dimensional acoustoelectronics.

<h3>Berry curvature dipole and nonlinear Hall effect in two-dimensional  Nb$_{2n+1}$Si$_n$Te$_{4n+2}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00946" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00946</a>
<br>
<i>Yiwei Zhao, Jin Cao, Zeying Zhang, Si Li, Yan Li, Fei Ma, Shengyuan A. Yang</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent experiments have demonstrated interesting physics in a family of
two-dimensional (2D) composition-tunable materials
Nb$_{2n+1}$Si$_n$Te$_{4n+2}$. Here, we show that owing to its intrinsic low
symmetry, metallic nature, tunable composition, and ambient stability, these
materials offer a good platform for studying Berry curvature dipole (BCD) and
nonlinear Hall effect. Using first-principles calculations, we find that BCD
exhibits pronounced peaks in monolayer Nb$_{3}$SiTe$_{6}$ ($n=1$ case). Its
magnitude decreases monotonically with $n$ and completely vanishes in the
$n\rightarrow\infty$ limit. This variation manifests a special hidden
dimensional crossover of the low-energy electronic states in this system. The
resulting nonlinear Hall response from BCD in these materials is discussed. Our
work reveals pronounced geometric quantities and nonlinear transport physics in
Nb$_{2n+1}$Si$_n$Te$_{4n+2}$ family materials, which should be readily detected
in experiment.

<h3>Transverse circular photogalvanic effect associated with  Lorentz-violating Weyl fermions</h3>

<br>
<br>
Nonlinear optical responses of quantum materials have recently undergone
dramatic developments to unveil nontrivial geometry and topology. A remarkable
example is the quantized longitudinal circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE)
associated with the Chern number of Weyl fermions, while the physics of
transverse CPGE in Weyl semimetals remains exclusive. Here, we show that the
transverse CPGE of Lorentz invariant Weyl fermions is forced to be zero. We
find that the transverse photocurrents of Weyl fermions are associated not only
with the Chern numbers but also with the degree of Lorentz-symmetry breaking in
condensed matter systems. Based on the generic two-band model analysis, we
provide a new powerful equation to calculate the transverse CPGE based on the
tilting and warping terms of Weyl fermions. Our results are more capable in
designing large transverse CPGE of Weyl semimetals in experiments and are
applied to more than tens of Weyl materials to estimate their photocurrents.
Our method paves the way to study the CPGE of massless or massive
quasiparticles to design next-generation quantum optoelectronics.

<h3>Low-Temperature Chemical Vapor Deposition of Copper(II) Sulfide Crystals  and its Nonlinear Optical Response</h3>

The need for novel multifunctional nanomaterials capable of meeting new
demands in the realm of nanotechnology coupled with versatility of chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) technique (in large-area growth of crystals), encourages
innovative methods for synthesis of untried two-dimensional (2D) crystals.
While there exist reports on both top-down and bottom-up synthesis
methodologies of different Cu2S-based nanostructures, CVD-based synthesis of 2D
crystals of copper(II) sulfide (CuS) has not been investigated. This work
represents details of CVD method in systematic growth of highly crystalline 2D
CuS sheets as thin as ~ 6 nm with lateral sizes exceeding 60 {\mu}m, at a
relatively low temperature of 560 {\deg}C in ambient pressure. Samples were
characterized via X-ray diffraction, Raman, atomic force microscopy, and
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. SAED revealed a 6-fold
symmetric structure and identical atomic ratio of copper:sulphur was
corroborated from the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The as-prepared 2D
CuS sheets were successfully utilized in second harmonic generation (SHG) and
their strong response was found to be highly polarization angle-sensitive as
well. The CVD-synthesized 2D CuS crystals in this study are considered to be of
great significance in a diverse range of future applications, as in energy
storage, next-generation solar cells, nonlinear optoelectronic-related devices,
and even bioelectronics pursuits.

<br>
To realize a thermoelectric power generator, typically a junction between two
materials with different Seebeck coefficient needs to be fabricated. Such
difference in Seebeck coefficients can be induced by doping, which renders
difficult when working with two-dimensional (2d) materials. Here, we employ
substrate effects to form a thermoelectric junction in ultra-thin few-layer
MoS2 films. We investigated the junctions with a combination of scanning
photocurrent microscopy and scanning thermal microscopy. This allows us to
reveal that thermoelectric junctions form across the substrate-engineered
parts. We attribute this to a gating effect induced by interfacial charges in
combination with alterations in the electron-phonon scattering mechanisms. This
work demonstrates that substrate engineering is a promising strategy to develop
future compact thin-film thermoelectric power generators.

<h3>Monolayer-to-mesoscale modulation of the optical properties in 2D CrI3  mapped by hyperspectral microscopy</h3>

<br>
<br>
Magnetic 2D materials hold promise to change the miniaturization paradigm of
unidirectional photonic components. However, the integration of these materials
in devices hinges on the accurate determination of the optical properties down
to the monolayer limit, which is still missing. By using hyperspectral
wide-field imaging we reveal a non-monotonic thickness dependence of the
complex optical dielectric function in the archetypal magnetic 2D material CrI3
extending across different length scales: onsetting at the mesoscale, peaking
at the nanoscale and decreasing again down to the single layer. These results
portray a modification of the electronic properties of the material and align
with the layer-dependent magnetism in CrI3, shedding light into the
long-standing structural conundrum in this material. The unique modulation of
the complex dielectric function from the monolayer up to more than 100 layers
will be instrumental for understanding and manipulating the magneto-optical
effects of magnetic 2D materials.

<h3>A fixed point can hide another one: the nonperturbative behavior of the  tetracritical fixed point of the O($N$) models at large $N$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01021" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01021</a>
<br>
<i>Shunsuke Yabunaka, Bertrand Delamotte</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that at $N=\infty$ and below its upper critical dimension, $d<d_{\rm
up}$, the critical and tetracritical behaviors of the O($N$) models are
associated with the same renormalization group fixed point (FP) potential. Only
their derivatives make them different with the subtleties that taking their
$N\to\infty$ limit and deriving them do not commute and that two relevant
eigenperturbations show singularities. This invalidates both the $\epsilon-$
and the $1/N-$ expansions. We also show how the Bardeen-Moshe-Bander line of
tetracritical FPs at $N=\infty$ and $d=d_{\rm up}$ can be understood from a
finite-$N$ analysis.

<h3>Ab-initio study of phononic thermal conduction in ScAgC half-Heusler</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present a first-principles lattice calculations to comprehend the thermal
expansion $\alpha(T)$ and lattice thermal conductivity $\kappa_{ph}$ of ScAgC.
The obtained positive frequencies of phonon dispersion shows the dynamical
stability of ScAgC in FCC structure. The estimated $\alpha(T)$ from
quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) at 300(1200) K is
$\sim$4(4.6)$\times$$10^{-6}$ K$^{-1}$. The predicted value of total
$\kappa_{ph}$ from phonon-phonon interaction (PPI) at 300(1200) K is
$\sim$7.4(1.8) Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$. The highest group velocity for acoustic $\&$
optical branches (AB $\&$ OB) is $\sim$6.7 and $\sim$3.5 km/s, respectively.
The predicted average phonon lifetime ($\tau_{\lambda}$) for AB(OB) is
$\sim$2.5(1.65) ps at 300 K, whereas it is $\sim$0.6(0.4) ps at 1200 K. The
estimated highest heat capacity ($C_{\lambda}$) at 200 K for AB(OB) is
$\sim$23.5 (19.5) meV/K. We fitted the equation
$A_{\kappa}$T$^{-x_{\kappa}}$($A_{\tau}$T$^{-x_{\tau}}$) in the
$\kappa_{ph}$($\tau_{\lambda}$) curve to gain a thorough understanding of
temperature-dependent $\kappa_{ph}$ trend. The $x_{\kappa}$ for total branches
is calculated to be $\sim$1.02. The $x_{\tau}$ value due to total AB(OB) is
estimated to be $\sim$1.04(1.02), while it is $\sim$1.03 for total branches.
The calculated $x_{\kappa}$ for total AB(OB) is $\sim$1.04(0.95), implying that
AB contributes more to the total $\kappa_{ph}$. This research could be
important for enhancing the properties of ScAgC regarding thermoelectric and
photovoltaic applications.

Liquid crystals generally support orientational singularities of the director
field known as topological defects. These latter modifiy transport properties
in their vicinity as if the geometry was non-Euclidean. We present a state of
the art of the differential geometry of nematic liquid crystals, with a special
emphasis on linear defects. We then discuss unexpected but deep connections
with cosmology and high-energy-physics, and conclude with a review on defect

<h3>Uncovering the role of the light-induced reduction of the inter-atomic  exchange in the ultrafast demagnetization of Fe, Co, and Ni</h3>

<br>
<i>Philippe Scheid, Julius Hohlfeld, Gregory Malinowski, Anders Bergman, Olle Eriksson, Sébastien Lebègue, Stéphane Mangin</i>
<br>
<br>
Time resolved measurements of the linear magneto-optical Kerr rotation reveal
that, in the {\it 3d} ferromagnets Fe, Co and Ni, the amplitude of the
demagnetization increases linearly with the fluence of the light. We
rationalize this phenomenon as being linearly driven by the increase in
temperature, the electron-phonon and electron-magnon scattering, and a
reduction of the inter-atomic exchange. The amplitude of the latter phenomenon,
which until the present study has been widely overlooked, is obtained through
\textit{ab initio} density functional theory calculations, and is argued to be
the principal source of demagnetization in Ni and Co, while still contributing
largely in Fe.

Large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) due to the Berry curvature in
magnetic topological semimetals is attracting enormous interest due to its
fundamental importance and technological relevance. Mechanisms resulting in
large intrinsic AHE include diverging Berry curvature in Weyl semimetals,
anticrossing nodal rings or points of non-trivial bands, and noncollinear spin
structures. Here we show that a half-topological semimetal (HTS) state near a
topological critical point can provide a new mechanism for driving an
exceptionally large AHE. We reveal this through a systematic experimental and
theoretical study of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) half-Heusler compound TbPdBi.
We not only observed an unusual AHE with a surprisingly large anomalous Hall
angle {\Theta}H (tan {\Theta}H ~ 2, the largest among the antiferromagnets) in
its field-driven ferromagnetic (FM) phase, but also found a distinct Hall
resistivity peak in the canted AFM phase within a low field range, where its
isothermal magnetization is nearly linearly dependent on the field. Moreover,
we observed a nearly isotropic, giant negative magnetoresistance with a
magnitude of ~98%. Our in-depth theoretical modelling demonstrates that these
exotic transport properties originate from the HTS state. A minimal Berry
curvature cancellation between the trivial spin-up and nontrivial spin-down
bands results not only in an extremely large AHE, but it also enhances the spin
polarization of the spin-down bands substantially and thus leads to a giant
negative magnetoresistance. Our study advances the understanding of the
interplay between band topology and magnetism and offers new clues for
materials design for spintronics and other applications.

Layer-by-layer material engineering has enabled exotic quantum phenomena such
as interfacial superconductivity and the quantum anomalous Hall effect.
Meanwhile, deciphering electronic states layer-by-layer remains a fundamental
scientific challenge. This is exemplified by the difficulty in understanding
the layer origins of topological electronic states in magnetic topological
insulators, which is key to understanding and controlling topological quantum
phases. Here, we report a layer-encoded frequency-domain ARPES experiment on a
magnetic topological insulator (MnBi2Te4)(Bi2Te3) to characterize the layer
origins of electronic states. Infrared laser excitations launch coherent
lattice vibrations with the layer index encoded by the vibration frequency;
photoemission spectroscopy tracks the electron dynamics, where the layer
information is decoded in the frequency domain. This layer-frequency
correspondence reveals a surprising wavefunction relocation of the topological
surface state from the top magnetic layer into the buried second layer,
reconciling the controversy over the vanishing broken-symmetry energy gap in
(MnBi2Te4)(Bi2Te3) and its related compounds. The layer-frequency
correspondence can be harnessed to disentangle electronic states layer-by-layer
in a broad class of van der Waals superlattices.

By moving individual Fe-Porphyrin-based molecules with the tip of Scanning
Tunneling Microscope in the vicinity of a Br-atom containing elbow of the
herringbone-reconstructed Au(111), we reversibly and continuously control their
magnetic state. Several regimes are obtained experimentally and explored
theoretically: from the integer spin limit, through intermediate magnetic
states with renormalized magnetic anisotropy, until the Kondo-screened regime,
corresponding to a progressive increase of charge fluctuations and mixed
valency due to an increase in the interaction of the molecular Fe states with
the substrate Fermi sea. Our results open a route for the realization, tuning
and experimental studies of novel quantum magnetic states in molecule-surface
hybrids.

We consider the distribution of first passage time events in the presence of
non-ergodic modes that drive otherwise ergodic dynamics on a potential
landscape. We find that in the limit of slow and large enough fluctuations the
distribution of first passage time events, $f(t)$, exhibits heavy tails
dominated by a power law with exponent $f(t)\sim t^{-2}$, and corrections that
depend on the strength and the nature of fluctuations. We support our
theoretical findings through direct numerical simulations in illustrative
examples.

<br>
<br>
In an in-situ prepared three-terminal Josephson junction based on the
topological insulator Bi$_4$Te$_3$ and the superconductor Nb the transport
properties are studied. The differential resistance maps as a function of two
bias currents reveal extended areas of Josephson supercurrent including
coupling effects between adjacent superconducting electrodes. The observed
dynamics for the coupling of the junctions is interpreted using a numerical
simulation of a similar geometry based on a resistively and capacitively
shunted Josephson junction model. The temperature dependency indicates that the
device behaves similar to prior experiments with single Josephson junctions
comprising topological insulators weak links. Irradiating radio frequencies to
the junction we find a spectrum of integer Shapiro steps and an additional
fractional step, which is interpreted by a skewed current-phase relationship.
In a perpendicular magnetic field we observe Fraunhofer-like interference
patterns of the switching currents.

<br>
<br>
Recently, the natural heterostructure of (PbSe)5(Bi2Se3)6 has been
theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed as a topological
insulator. In this work, we induce superconductivity in (PbSe)5(Bi2Se3)6 by
implementing high pressure. As increasing pressure up to 10 GPa,
superconductivity with Tc ~ 4.6 K suddenly appears, followed by an abrupt
decrease. Remarkably, upon further compression above 30 GPa, a new
superconducting state arises, where pressure raises the Tc to an unsaturated
6.0 K within the limit of our research. Combining XRD and Raman spectroscopies,
we suggest that the emergence of two distinct superconducting states occurs
concurrently with the pressure-induced structural transition in this
topological heterostructure (PbSe)5(Bi2Se3)6.

Coherent engineering of landscape potential in crystalline materials is a
rapidly evolving research field. Ultrafast optical pulses can manipulate
low-frequency shear phonons in van der Waals layered materials through the
dynamical dressing of electronic structure and photoexcited carrier density. In
this work, we provide a diagrammatic formalism for nonlinear Raman force and
implement it to shear phonon dynamics in bilayer graphene. We predict a
controllable splitting of double degenerate shear phonon modes due to
light-induced phonon mixing and renormalization according to a coherent
nonlinear Raman force mechanism. Intriguingly, we obtain a light-induced shear
phonon softening that facilitates structural instability at a critical field
amplitude for which the shear phonon frequency vanishes. The phonon splitting
and instability strongly depend on the laser intensity, frequency, chemical
potential, and temperature of photoexcited electrons. This study motivates
future experimental investigation of the optical fine-tuning and regulation of
shear phonons and layer stacking order in layered van der Waals mater

We apply a field-theoretical approach to study the structure and
thermodynamics of a two-Yukawa fluid confined by a hard wall. We derive mean
field equations allowing for numerical evaluation of the density profile which
is compared to analytical estimations. Beyond the mean field approximation,
analytical expressions for the free energy, the pressure, and the correlation
function are derived. Subsequently, contributions to the density profile and
the adsorption coefficient due to Gaussian fluctuations are found. Both the
mean field and the fluctuation terms of the density profile are shown to
satisfy the contact theorem. We further use the contact theorem to improve the
Gaussian approximation for the density profile based on a better approximation
for the bulk pressure. The results obtained are compared to computer simulation
data.

<h3>Axisymmetric necking of a circular electrodes-coated dielectric membrane</h3>

<br>

We investigate the stability of a circular electrodes-coated dielectric
membrane under the combined action of an electric field and all-round in-plane
tension. It is known that such a membrane is susceptible to the limiting point
instability (also known as pull-in instability) which is widely believed to be
a precursor to electric breakdown. However, there is experimental evidence
showing that the limiting point instability may not necessarily be responsible
for rapid thinning and electric breakdown. We explore the possibility that the
latter is due to a new instability mechanism, namely localised axisymmetric
necking. The bifurcation condition for axisymmetric necking is first derived
and used to show that this instability may occur before the Treloar-Kearsley
instability or the limiting point instability for a class of free energy
functions. A weakly nonlinear analysis is then conducted and it is shown that
the near-critical behavior is described by a fourth order nonlinear ODE with
variable coefficients. This amplitude equation is solved using the finite
difference method and it is demonstrated that a localised solution does indeed
bifurcate from the homogeneous solution. Based on this analysis and what is
already known for the purely mechanical case, we may deduce that the necking
evolution follows the same three stages of initiation, growth and propagation
as other similar localisation problems. The insight provided by the current
study is expected to be relevant in assessing the integrity of dielectric
elastomer actuators.

<h3>Statistical model of a superfluid solid</h3>

A microscopic statistical model of a quantum solid is developed, where inside
a crystalline lattice there can exist regions of disorder, such as dislocation
networks or grain boundaries. The cores of these regions of disorder are
allowed for exhibiting fluid-like properties. If the solid is composed of Bose
atoms, then the fluid-like aggregations inside the regions of disorder can
exhibit Bose-Einstein condensation and hence superfluidity. The regions of
disorder are randomly distributed throughout the sample, so that for describing
the overall properties of the solid requires to accomplish averaging over the
disordered aggregation configurations. The averaging procedure results in a
renormalized Hamiltonian of a solid that can combine the properties of a
crystal and superfluidity. The possibility of such a combination depends on the
system parameters. In general, there exists a range of the model parameters
allowing for the occurrence of superfluidity inside the disordered
aggregations. This microscopic statistical model gives the opportunity to
answer which real quantum crystals can exhibit the property of superfluidity
and which cannot.

<h3>Spin-orbit torque for eld-free switching in C_{3v} crystals</h3>

<br>
<br>
Spin-orbit torques in noncentrosymmetric polycrystalline magnetic
heterostructures are usually described in terms of field-like and damping-like
torques. However, materials with a lower symmetry point group can exhibit
torques whose behavior substantially deviates from the conventional ones. In
particular, based on symmetry arguments it was recently proposed that systems
belonging to the C_{3v} point group display spin-orbit torques that can promote
field-free switching [Liu et al. Nature Nanotechnology 16, 277 (2021)]. In the
present work, we analyze the general form of the torques expected in C3v
crystals using the Invariant Theory. We uncover several new components that
arise from the coexistence of the three-fold rotation and mirror symmetries.
Using both tight binding model and first principles simulations, we show that
these unconventional torque components arise from the onset of trigonal warping
of the Fermi surface and can be as large as the damping-like torque. In other
words, the Fermi surface warping is a key indicator to the onset of field-free
switching in low symmetry crystals.

<h3>Synergistic Photon Management and Strain-Induced Band Gap Engineering of  Two-Dimensional MoS2 Using Semimetal Composite Nanostructures</h3>

2D MoS2 attracts increasing attention for its application in flexible
electronics and photonic devices. For 2D material optoelectronic devices, light
absorption of the molecularly thin 2D absorber would be one of the key limiting
factors in device efficiency, and conventional photon management techniques are
not necessarily compatible with them. In this paper, we show two semimetal
composite nanostructures for synergistic photon management and strain-induced
band gap engineering of 2D MoS2: (1) pseudo-periodic Sn nanodots, (2)
conductive SnOx (x<1) core-shell nanoneedle structures. Without sophisticated
nanolithography, both nanostructures are self-assembled from physical vapor
deposition. 2D MoS2 achieves up to >15x enhancement in absorption at
{\lambda}=650-950 nm under Sn nanodots, and 20-30x at {\lambda}=700-900 nm
under SnOx (x<1) nanoneedles, both spanning from visible to near infrared
regime. Enhanced absorption in MoS2 results from strong near field enhancement
and reduced MoS2 band gap due to the tensile strain induced by the Sn
nanostructures, as confirmed by Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy.
Especially, we demonstrate that up to 3.5% biaxial tensile strain is introduced
to 2D MoS2 using conductive nanoneedle-structured SnOx (x<1), which reduces the
band gap by ~0.35 eV to further enhance light absorption at longer wavelengths.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a synergistic
triple-functional photon management, stressor, and conductive electrode layer
on 2D MoS2. Such synergistic photon management and band gap engineering
approach for extended spectral response can be further applied to other 2D
materials for future 2D photonic devices.

<h3>Carbon in solution and the Charpy impact performance of medium Mn steels</h3>

<br>

Carbon is a well known austenite stabiliser and can be used to alter the
stacking fault energy and stability against martensitic transformation in
medium Mn steels, producing a range of deformation mechanisms such as the
Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) or combined Twinning and
Transformation Induced Plasticity (TWIP $+$ TRIP) effects. However, the effect
of C beyond quasi-static tensile behaviour is less well known. Therefore, two
medium Mn steels with 0.2 wt\% and 0.5 wt\% C were designed to produce similar
austenite fractions and stability and therefore tensile behaviour. These were
processed to form lamellar and mixed equiaxed $+$ lamellar microstructures. The
low C steel had a corrected Charpy impact energy (KV\textsubscript{10}) of 320
J cm\textsuperscript{-2} compared to 66 J cm\textsuperscript{-2} in the high C
steel despite both having a ductility of over 35\%. Interface segregation, e.g.
of tramp elements, was investigated as a potential cause and none was found.
Only a small amount of Mn rejection from partitioning was observed at the
interface. The fracture surfaces were investigated and the TRIP effect was
found to occur more readily in the Low C Charpy specimen. Therefore it is
concluded that the use of C to promote TWIP$+$TRIP behaviour should be avoided
in alloy design but the Charpy impact performance can be understood purely in
terms of C in solution.

<h3>Extracting optical parameters of Cu-Mn-Fe spinel oxide nanoparticles for  optimizing air-stable, high-efficiency solar selective coatings</h3>

High-temperature Cu-Mn-Fe spinel-oxide nanoparticle solar selective absorber
coatings are investigated experimentally and theoretically. A reliable, general
approach to evaluate absorption coefficient spectra from the optical
measurements of the nanoparticle-pigmented coatings is developed based on
solving the inverse problem using four-flux-radiative method. The derived
absorption properties of NP materials can be directly applied to predict the
solar absorptance, optimize the nanoparticle-pigmented coatings, and analyze
the thermal degradation, which agree well with the experimental results. The
analysis reveals that the Cu-Mn-Fe spinel oxides are fundamentally indirect
bandgap ranging from 1.7 to 2.1 eV, while iron-free CuMn2O4 is a direct bandgap
material with Eg=1.84 eV. With the same coating thickness and nanoparticle
load, the solar absorptance ranks in the order of Mn2O3 < MnFe2O4 < CuFe2O4 <
CuFeMnO4 < CuMn2O4. The optimized spray-coated iron-free CuMn2O4 NP-pigmented
coating demonstrates a high solar absorptance of 97%, a low emittance of 55%, a
high optical-to-thermal energy conversion efficiency of ~93.5 % under 1000x
solar concentration at 750 degrees C, and long-term endurance upon thermal
cycling between 750{\deg}C and room temperature in air. The optical parameter
analysis approach can be easily extended to other material systems to
facilitate the searching and optimizing high-temperature pigmented-solar
selective coatings.

<br>
<br>
In the context of wave propagation, caustics are usually defined as the
envelope of a finite-extent wavefront; folds and cusps in a caustic result in
enhanced wave amplitudes. Here, we tackle a related phenomenon, namely the
existence of well-defined beams originating solely from the geometric
properties of the corresponding dispersion relation. This directional emission,
termed caustic beam, is enabled by a stationary group velocity direction, and
has been observed first in the case of phonons. We propose an overview of this
"focusing" effect in the context of spin waves excited in soft, thin
ferromagnetic films. Based on an analytical dispersion relation, we provide
tools for a systematic survey of caustic spin wave beams. Our theoretical
approach is validated by time-resolved microscopy experiments using the
magneto-optical Kerr effect. Then, we identify two cases of particular interest
both from fundamental and applicative perspectives. Indeed, both of them enable
broadband excitations (in terms of wave vectors) to result in narrowband beams
of low divergence.
