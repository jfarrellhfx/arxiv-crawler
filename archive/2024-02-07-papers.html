<h3>Swimmers at Interfaces Enhance Interfacial Transport</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04277" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04277</a>
<br>
<i>Jiayi Deng, Mehdi Molaei, Nicholas G. Chisholm, Kathleen J. Stebe</i>
<p>The behavior of fluid interfaces far from equilibrium plays central roles in
nature and in industry. Active swimmers trapped at interfaces can alter
transport at fluid boundaries with far reaching implications. Swimmers can
become trapped at interfaces in diverse configurations and swim persistently in
these surface adhered states. The self-propelled motion of bacteria makes them
ideal model swimmers to understand such effects. We have recently characterized
the swimming of interfacially-trapped Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 moving in
pusher mode. The swimmers adsorb at the interface with pinned contact lines,
which fix the angle of the cell body at the interface and constrain their
motion. Thus, most interfacially-trapped bacteria swim along circular paths.
Fluid interfaces form incompressible two-dimensional layers, altering leading
order interfacial flows generated by the swimmers from those in bulk. In our
previous work, we have visualized the interfacial flow around a pusher
bacterium and described the flow field using two dipolar hydrodynamic modes;
one stresslet mode whose symmetries differ from those in bulk, and another bulk
mode unique to incompressible fluid interfaces. Based on this understanding,
swimmers-induced tracer displacements and swimmer-swimmer pair interactions are
explored using analysis and experiment. The settings in which multiple
interfacial swimmers with circular motion can significantly enhance interfacial
transport of tracers or promotemixing of other swimmers on the interface are
identified through simulations and compared to experiment. This study
identifies important factors of general interest regarding swimmers on or near
fluid boundaries, and in the design of biomimetic swimmers to enhance transport
at interfaces

<h3>Vectorial active matter on the lattice: polar condensates and nematic  filaments</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04450" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04450</a>
<br>
<i>Josué Manik Nava-Sedeño, Haralampos Hatzikirou, Anja Voß-Böhme, Lutz Brusch, Andreas Deutsch, Fernando Peruani</i>
<p>We introduce a novel lattice-gas cellular automaton (LGCA) for compressible
vectorial active matter with polar and nematic velocity alignment. Interactions
are, by construction, zero-range. For polar alignment, we show the system
undergoes a phase transition that promotes aggregation with strong resemblance
to the classic zero-range process. We find that above a critical point, the
states of a macroscopic fraction of the particles in the system coalesce into
the same state, sharing the same position and momentum (polar condensate). For
nematic alignment, the system also exhibits condensation, but there exist
fundamental differences: a macroscopic fraction of the particles in the system
collapses into a filament, where particles possess only two possible momenta.
Furthermore, we derive hydrodynamic equations for the active LGCA model to
understand the phase transitions and condensation that undergoes the system. We
also show that generically the discrete lattice symmetries -- e.g. of a square
or hexagonal lattice -- affect drastically the emergent large-scale properties
of on-lattice active systems. The study puts in evidence that aligning active
matter on the lattice displays new behavior, including phase transitions to
states that share similarities to condensation models.

<h3>Run-and-tumble motion of ellipsoidal swimmers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04697" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04697</a>
<br>
<i>Gordei Anchutkin, Viktor Holubec, Frank Cichos</i>
<p>A hallmark of bacteria is their so-called "run-and-tumble" motion, consisting
of a sequence of linear directed "runs" and random rotations that constantly
alternate due to biochemical feedback. It plays a crucial role in the ability
of bacteria to move through chemical gradients and inspired a fundamental
active particle model. Nevertheless, synthetic active particles generally do
not exhibit run-and-tumble motion but rather active Brownian motion. We show in
experiments that ellipsoidal thermophoretic Janus particles, propelling along
their short axis, can yield run-and-tumble-like motion even without feedback.
Their hydrodynamic wall interactions under strong confinement give rise to an
effective double-well potential for the declination of the short axis. The
geometry-induced timescale separation of the in-plane rotational dynamics and
noise-induced transitions in the potential then yields run-and-tumble-like
motion.

<h3>Fluctuating hydrodynamics of active particles interacting via chemotaxis  and quorum sensing: static and dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05072" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05072</a>
<br>
<i>Alberto Dinelli, Jérémy O'Byrne, Julien Tailleur</i>
<p>In this article we derive and test the fluctuating hydrodynamic description
of active particles interacting via taxis and quorum sensing, both for
mono-disperse systems and for mixtures of co-existing species of active
particles. We compute the average steady-state density profile in the presence
of spatial motility regulation, as well as the structure factor and
intermediate scattering function for interacting systems. By comparing our
predictions to microscopic numerical simulations, we show that our fluctuating
hydrodynamics correctly predicts the large-scale static and dynamical
properties of the system. We also discuss how the theory breaks down when
structures emerge at scales smaller or comparable to the persistence length of
the particles. When the density field is the unique hydrodynamic mode of the
system, we show that active Brownian particles, run-and-tumble particles and
active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles, interacting via quorum-sensing or
chemotactic interactions, display undistinguishable large-scale properties.
This form of universality implies an interesting robustness of the predicted
physics but also that large-scale observations of patterns are insufficient to
assess their microscopic origins.

<h3>Fluctuation-Induced First Order Transition to Collective Motion</h3>

<i>David Martin, Gianmarco Spera, Hugues Chaté, Charlie Duclut, Cesare Nardini, Julien Tailleur, Frédéric van Wijland</i>
<p>The nature of the transition to collective motion in assemblies of aligning
self-propelled particles remains a long-standing matter of debate. In this
article, we focus on dry active matter and show that weak fluctuations suffice
to generically turn second-order mean-field transitions into a `discontinuous'
coexistence scenario. Our theory shows how fluctuations induce a
density-dependence of the polar-field mass, even when this effect is absent at
mean-field level. In turn, this dependency on density triggers a feedback loop
between ordering and advection that ultimately leads to an inhomogeneous
transition to collective motion and the emergence of non-linear travelling
`flocks'. Importantly, we show that such a fluctuation-induced first order
transition is present in both metric models, in which particles align with
neighbors within a finite distance, and in topological ones, in which alignment
is not based on relative distances. We compute analytically the noise-induced
renormalization of the polar-field mass using stochastic calculus, which we
further back up by a one-loop field-theoretical analysis. Finally, we confirm
our analytical predictions by numerical simulations of fluctuating
hydrodynamics as well as of topological microscopic models with either
$k$-nearest neighbors or Voronoi alignment.

<h3>Maximizing bipolar sensitivity for anomalous Nernst thermopiles in heat  flux sensing in amorphous GdCo alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04259" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04259</a>
<br>
<i>Miho Odagiri, Hiroto Imaeda, Ahmet Yagmur, Yuichiro Kurokawa, Satoshi Sumi, Hiroyuki Awano, Kenji Tanabe</i>
<p>A Heat Flux Sensor (HFS) facilitates the visualization of heat flow, unlike a
temperature sensor, and is anticipated to be a key technology in managing waste
heat. Commercialized HFS devices, which are based on the Seebeck effect, are
notably expensive due to fabrication challenges and the need for sensitive
calibration. Recently, an HFS utilizing the Anomalous Nernst Effect (ANE) has
been proposed as a solution to these issues, garnering significant interest in
enhancing the transverse Seebeck coefficient. However, ideal materials for HFS
not only require a large transverse Seebeck coefficient but also meet several
criteria including low thermal conductivity and a bipolar nature of the
transverse Seebeck coefficient. In this study, we have investigated ANE in
amorphous ferrimagnetic GdCo alloys, revealing their numerous advantages as HFS
materials. These include unparalleled sensitivity comparable to Co2MnGa, the
ability to exhibit both positive and negative ANE, versatility for deposition
on various substrates, and a small longitudinal Seebeck coefficient. These
qualities position GdCo films as promising candidates for the advancement of
ANE-based HFS technology.

<h3>Statistical mechanics of elastica for the shape of supercoiled DNA:  hyperelliptic elastica of genus three</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04260" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04260</a>
<br>
<i>Shigeki Matsutani</i>
<p>This article studies the statistical mechanics of elastica as a model of the
shapes of the supercoiled DNA, and shows that its excited states can be
characterized by the focusing modified KdV (MKdV) equation due to thermal
fluctuation. Following the previous paper (Matsutani and Previato, Physica D
430 (2022) 133073), the hyperelliptic solutions of the focusing modified KdV
(MKdV) equation of genus three are considered. There appears a pattern as a
repetition of the modulation of figure-eight and the inverse 'S' as a thermal
fluctuation of elastica, called the S-eight mode. Our model states that the
excited states of elastica due to the thermal effect have the S-eight mode,
which reproduces the shapes of the AFM image of the supercoiled DNAs observed
by Japaridze et al. (Nano Lett. 17 3, (2017) 1938).

<h3>Pinning of crack fronts by hard and soft inclusions: a phase field study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04261" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04261</a>
<br>
<i>Hervé Henry</i>
<p>Through tridimensonal numerical simulations of crack propagating in material
with an elastic moduli heterogeneity it is shown that the presence of a simple
inclusion can affect dramatically the propagation of the crack. Both the
presence of soft and hard inclusions can lead to the arrest of a crack front.
Here the mechanism leading to the arrest of the crack are described and shown
to depend on the nature of the inclusion. This is also the case in regimes
where the presence of the inclusion leads to a slow down of the crack.

<h3>Generalization of the Landauer-Büttiker theory onto the case of  dissipative contacts</h3>

<br>
<i>Andrey R. Kolovsky</i>
<p>We revisit the problem of two-terminal transport of non-interacting Fermi
particles in a mesoscopic device. First, we generalize the problem by including
into consideration relaxation processes in contacts (which are characterized by
the contact self-thermalization rate $\gamma$) and then solve it by using the
master equation approach. In the limit $\gamma\rightarrow0$ the obtained
results are shown to reproduce those of the Landauer-B\"uttiker theory. Thus,
the presented analysis proves analytical correspondence between the
Landauer-B\"uttiker and master-equation approaches to quantum transport, -- the
problem which resisted solution for decades.

<p>The automated discovery of constitutive laws forms an emerging area that
focuses on automatically obtaining symbolic expressions describing the
constitutive behavior of solid materials from experimental data. Existing
symbolic/sparse regression methods rely on availability of libraries of
material models, which are typically hand-designed by a human expert relying on
known models as reference, or deploy generative algorithms with exponential
complexity which are only practicable for very simple expressions. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach to constitutive law discovery relying on
formal grammars as an automated and systematic tool to generate constitutive
law expressions complying with physics constraints. We deploy the approach for
two tasks: i) Automatically generating a library of valid constitutive laws for
hyperelastic isotropic materials; ii) Performing data-driven discovery of
hyperelastic material models from displacement data affected by different noise
levels. For the task of automatic library generation, we demonstrate the
flexibility and efficiency of the proposed methodology in alleviating
hand-crafted features and human intervention. For the data-driven discovery
task, we demonstrate the accuracy, robustness and significant generalizability
of the proposed methodology.

<p>Magnesium and calcium batteries offer promising energy storage solutions
characterised by cost-effectiveness, safety, and high energy density. However,
the scarcity of viable electrode and electrolyte materials vastly hinders their
advancement. This study utilises solid-state metathetical reactions involving
predominantly chalcogen- and pnictogen-based honeycomb layered oxides with
alkaline-earth halides/nitrates to synthesise $\rm Mg^{2+}$- and $\rm
Ca^{2+}$-based materials previously achievable only under
high-temperature/high-pressure conditions, as well as new metastable materials
with unique crystal versatility. Particularly, we employ metathetical reactions
involving $\rm Li_4MgTeO_6$, $\rm Na_2Mg_2TeO_6$, and $\rm Na_4MgTeO_6$ with
$\rm MgCl_2/Mg(NO_3)_2$ or $\rm Ca(NO_3)_2$ at temperatures not exceeding
500$\,^{\circ}$C to produce $\rm Mg_3TeO_6$ polymorphs, ilmenite-type $\rm
CaMg_2TeO_6$ ($\rm Mg_2CaTeO_6$), and double perovskite $\rm Ca_2MgTeO_6$.
Thus, we demonstrate that these materials, conventionally requiring gigascale
pressures and high temperatures ($> 1000\,^{\circ}$C) for their proper
synthesis, are now readily accessible at ambient pressure and considerably
lower temperatures. Meanwhile, despite sub-optimal pellet densities, the
synthesised ilmenite-type $\rm Mg_3TeO_6$ and double perovskite ${\rm Ca}_2M\rm
TeO_6$ ($M = \rm Mg,Ca,Zn$) materials exhibit remarkable bulk ionic
conductivity at room temperature, marking them as promising compositional
spaces for exploring novel $\rm Mg^{2+}$ and $\rm Ca^{2+}$ conductors.
Furthermore, this study extends the applicability of metathetical reactions to
attain $\rm Mg$- or $\rm Ca$-based bismuthates, antimonates, ruthenates,
tungstates, titanates, phosphates, and silicates, thus opening avenues to novel
multifunctional nanomaterial platforms with utility in energy storage and
beyond.

<p>Designing de novo proteins beyond those found in nature holds significant
promise for advancements in both scientific and engineering applications.
Current methodologies for protein design often rely on AI-based models, such as
surrogate models that address end-to-end problems by linking protein structure
to material properties or vice versa. However, these models frequently focus on
specific material objectives or structural properties, limiting their
flexibility when incorporating out-of-domain knowledge into the design process
or comprehensive data analysis is required. In this study, we introduce
ProtAgents, a platform for de novo protein design based on Large Language
Models (LLMs), where multiple AI agents with distinct capabilities
collaboratively address complex tasks within a dynamic environment. The
versatility in agent development allows for expertise in diverse domains,
including knowledge retrieval, protein structure analysis, physics-based
simulations, and results analysis. The dynamic collaboration between agents,
empowered by LLMs, provides a versatile approach to tackling protein design and
analysis problems, as demonstrated through diverse examples in this study. The
problems of interest encompass designing new proteins, analyzing protein
structures and obtaining new first-principles data -- natural vibrational
frequencies -- via physics simulations. The concerted effort of the system
allows for powerful automated and synergistic design of de novo proteins with
targeted mechanical properties. The flexibility in designing the agents, on one
hand, and their capacity in autonomous collaboration through the dynamic
LLM-based multi-agent environment on the other hand, unleashes great potentials
of LLMs in addressing multi-objective materials problems and opens up new
avenues for autonomous materials discovery and design.

<h3>A closer physico-chemical look to the Layer-by-Layer electrostatic  self-assembly of polyelectrolyte multilayers</h3>

<i>Eduardo Guzman, Ramon G. Rubio, Francisco Ortega</i>
<p>The fabrication of polyelectrolyte multilayer films (PEMs) using the
Layer-by-Layer (LbL) method is one of the most versatile approaches for
manufacturing functional surfaces. This is the result of the possibility to
control the assembly process of the LbL films almost at will, by changing the
nature of the assembled materials (building blocks), the assembly conditions
(pH, ionic strength, temperature, etc.) or even by changing some other
operational parameters which may impact in the structure and physico-chemical
properties of the obtained multi-layered films. Therefore, the understanding of
the impact of the above mentioned parameters on the assembly process of LbL
materials plays a critical role in the potential use of the LbL method for the
fabrication of new functional materials with technological interest. This
review tries to provide a broad physico-chemical perspective to the study of
the fabrication process of PEMs by the LbL method, which allows one to take
advantage of the many possibilities offered for this approach on the
fabrication of new functional nanomaterials.

<h3>Anisotropic frictional model for an object sliding in a granular media</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04271" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04271</a>
<br>
<i>René Zuñiga, Carlos Vasconcellos, Baptiste Darbois Texier, Francisco Melo</i>
<p>Several locomotion strategies are based on the anisotropic nature of the
forces experienced by the moving body with its environment. We report
experiments on the anisotropy of the frictional force experienced by a cylinder
moving in a granular medium as a function of the orientation $\alpha$ between
the cylinder and its velocity. The component of the force in the direction
parallel to the velocity of the cylinder is always higher than the
perpendicular component and the force is therefore anisotropic. While the
parallel component increases continuously with the cylinder angle $\alpha$, we
observe that the perpendicular component reaches a maximum value for an
orientation of $\alpha_c \simeq 35^\circ$. In order to rationalise these
observations, we have developed a theoretical model which assumes that the
mechanical energy required to move the cylinder is dissipated by friction and
establishes a relationship between the parallel and perpendicular force
components that is consistent with experiments.

<i>J. D. Phan, A.-V. Phan</i>
<p>This paper presents a novel and efficient approach for the computation of
energy eigenvalues in quantum semiconductor heterostructures. Accurate
determination of the electronic states in these heterostructures is crucial for
understanding their optical and electronic properties, making it a key
challenge in semiconductor physics. The proposed method is based on utilizing
series expansions of zero-order Bessel functions to numerically solve the
Schr\"odinger equation using boundary integral method for bound electron states
in a computationally efficient manner. To validate the proposed technique, we
applied it to address previously explored issues by other research groups. The
results clearly demonstrate the computational efficiency and high precision of
our approach. Notably, the proposed technique significantly reduces the
computational time compared to the conventional method for searching the energy
eigenvalues in quantum structures.

<h3>Electrokinetic origin of swirling flow on nanoscale interface</h3>

<p>The zeta ($\zeta$) potential is a pivotal metric for characterizing the
electric field topology within an electric double layer - an important
phenomenon on phase interface. It underpins critical processes in diverse
realms such as chemistry, biomedical engineering, and micro/nanofluidics. Yet,
local measurement of $\zeta$ potential at the interface has historically
presented challenges, leading researchers to simplify a chemically homogenized
surface with a uniform $\zeta$ potential. In the current investigation, we
present evidence that, within a microchannel, the spatial distribution of
$\zeta$ potential across a chemically homogeneous solid-liquid interface can
become two-dimensional (2D) under an imposed flow regime, as disclosed by a
state-of-art fluorescence photobleaching electrochemistry analyzer (FLEA)
technique. The $\zeta$ potential' s propensity to become increasingly negative
downstream, presents an approximately symmetric, V-shaped pattern in the
spanwise orientation. Intriguingly, and of notable significance to chemistry
and engineering, this 2D $\zeta$ potential framework was found to
electrokinetically induce swirling flows in tens of nanometers, aligning with
the streamwise axis, bearing a remarkable resemblance to the well-documented
hairpin vortices in turbulent boundary layers. Our findings gesture towards a
novel perspective on the genesis of vortex structures in nanoscale.
Additionally, the FLEA technique emerges as a potent tool for discerning
$\zeta$ potential at a local scale with high resolution, potentially
accelerating the evolution and applications of novel surface material.

<p>Strongly interacting electron systems can provide insight into quantum
many-body phenomena, such as Mott insulating behavior and spin liquidity,
facilitating semiconductor optimization. The Fermi-Hubbard model is the
prototypical model used to study such systems. Recent research, however, has
shown that the extended Fermi-Hubbard model, which accounts for long-range
interactions, is more accurate, especially for systems far from half-filling.
In this study, we use the extended Fermi-Hubbard model to mathematically
analyze charge transport through a lattice of quantum dots. One-dimensional
chains with spinless electrons and source-drain bias are observed, focusing on
the transition between the ground state and the first excited state. Level
repulsion decreases the expected energy levels of anticrossings as the hopping
onto the chain tends to the hopping within the chain. The distribution of
charge density along the chain is characterized in terms of the hopping,
nuclear, and Coulomb parameters and novel plasmonic behavior is analyzed. Minor
perturbations in electron transport are identified, corresponding to the
one-dimensional nature of the observed systems. This research will lead to a
better understanding of electron behavior in silicon-doped semiconductors, like
the formation of correlation-induced band gaps, and open the door to using the
extended Fermi-Hubbard model as a more accurate alternative to study quantum
many-body systems.

<p>Ultrafast electric-field control of emergent electronic and magnetic states
at oxide interfaces offers exciting prospects for the development of new
generations of energy-efficient devices. Here, we demonstrate that the
electronic structure and emergent ferromagnetic interfacial state in epitaxial
LaNiO3/CaMnO3 superlattices can be effectively controlled using intense
single-cycle THz electric-field pulses. We employ a combination of
polarization-dependent X-ray absorption spectroscopy with magnetic circular
dichroism and X-ray resonant magnetic reflectivity to measure a detailed
magneto-optical profile and thickness of the ferromagnetic interfacial layer.
Then, we use time-resolved and temperature-dependent magneto-optical Kerr
effect, along with transient optical reflectivity and transmissivity
measurements, to disentangle multiple correlated electronic and magnetic
processes driven by ultrafast high-field (~1 MV/cm) THz pulses. These processes
include an initial sub-picosecond electronic response, consistent with
non-equilibrium Joule heating; a rapid (~270 fs) demagnetization of the
ferromagnetic interfacial layer, driven by THz-field-induced nonequilibrium
spin-polarized currents; and subsequent multi-picosecond dynamics, possibly
indicative of a change in the magnetic state of the superlattice due to the
transfer of spin angular momentum to the lattice. Our findings shed light on
the intricate interplay of electronic and magnetic phenomena in this strongly
correlated material system, suggesting a promising avenue for efficient control
of two-dimensional ferromagnetic states at oxide interfaces using ultrafast

<h3>Broken Symmetry in Ideal Chern Bands</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04303" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04303</a>
<br>
<i>Hui Liu, Kang Yang, Ahmed Abouelkomsan, Zhao Liu, Emil J. Bergholtz</i>
<p>Recent observations of the fractional anomalous quantum Hall effect in
moir\'e materials have reignited the interest in fractional Chern insulators
(FCIs). The chiral limit in which analytic Landau level-like single-particle
states form an "ideal" Chern band and local interactions lead to Laughlin-like
FCIs at $1/3$ filling, has been very useful for understanding these systems by
relating them to the lowest Landau level. We show, however, that, even in the
idealized chiral limit, a fluctuating quantum geometry is associated with
strongly broken symmetries and a phenomenology very different from that of
Landau levels. In particular, particle-hole symmetry is strongly violated and
e.g. at $2/3$ filling an emergent interaction driven Fermi liquid state with no
Landau level counterpart is energetically favoured. In fact, even the exact
Laughlin-like zero modes at $1/3$ filling have a non-uniform density tracking
the underlying quantum geometry. Moreover, by switching to a Coulomb
interaction, the ideal Chern band features charge density wave states with no
lowest Landau level counterpart.

<h3>Probing magnetism in moiré heterostructures with quantum twisting  microscopes</h3>

<br>
<i>Fabian Pichler, Wilhelm Kadow, Clemens Kuhlenkamp, Michael Knap</i>
<p>Spin-ordered states close to metal-insulator transitions are poorly
understood theoretically and challenging to probe in experiments. Here, we
propose that the quantum twisting microscope, which provides direct access to
the energy-momentum resolved spectrum of single-particle and collective
excitations, can be used as a novel tool to distinguish between different types
of magnetic order. To this end, we calculate the single-particle spectral
function and the dynamical spin-structure factor for both a ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic generalized Wigner crystal formed in fractionally filled
moir\'e superlattices of transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures. We
demonstrate that magnetic order can be clearly identified in these response
functions. Furthermore, we explore signatures of quantum phase transitions in
the quantum twisting microscope response. We focus on the specific case of
triangular moir\'e lattices at half filling, which have been proposed to host a
topological phase transition between a chiral spin liquid and a 120 degree
ordered state. Our work demonstrates the potential for quantum twisting
microscopes to characterize quantum magnetism in moir\'e heterostructures.

<br>
<i>Matthew T. Konnik, Trey Oldham, Allison Rzepka, Vincent Le Maout, Kelly A. Stephani, Francesco Panerai</i>
<p>The influence of nitrogen on the oxidation behavior of hot-pressed zirconium
carbide was investigated using a flow-tube furnace at temperatures ranging from
1000 to 1600 {\deg}C. Mass gain, oxide formation characteristics, and oxide
transitions were evaluated at various experimental conditions. Differences in
oxidation behavior across the range of temperatures investigated show both
kinetic and microstructural dependence with implications pointing to this
materials efficacy in ultra-high temperature applications. Results suggest that
at temperatures above 1400 {\deg}C, although oxidation mechanisms remain
dominant, nitridation and reduction mechanisms may be appreciable enough to
require consideration. Supporting discussions regarding polymorphism and
microstructural influences are outlined.

<h3>Phase-type distributions for studying variability in resistive memories</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04351" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04351</a>
<br>
<i>Christian Acal, Juan E. Ruiz-Castro, Ana M. Aguilera, Francisco Jiménez-Molinos, Juan B. Roldán</i>
<p>A new statistical approach has been developed to analyze Resistive Random
Access Memory (RRAM) variability. The stochastic nature of the physical
processes behind the operation of resistive memories makes variability one of
the key issues to solve from the industrial viewpoint of these new devices. The
statistical features of variability have been usually studied making use of
Weibull distribution. However, this probability distribution does not work
correctly for some resistive memories, in particular for those based on the
Ni/HfO2/Si structure that has been employed in this work. A completely new
approach based on phase-type modeling is proposed in this paper to characterize
the randomness of resistive memories operation. An in-depth comparison with
experimental results shows that the fitted phase-type distribution works better
than the Weibull distribution and also helps to understand the physics of the
resistive memories.

<p>A powerful time series analysis modeling technique is presented to describe
cycle-to-cycle variability in memristors. These devices show variability linked
to the inherent stochasticity of device operation and it needs to be accurately
modeled to build compact models for circuit simulation and design purposes. A
new multivariate approach is proposed for the reset and set voltages that
accurately describes the statistical data structure of a resistive switching
series. Experimental data were measured from advanced hafnium oxide based
devices. The models reproduce the experiments correctly and a comparison of the
multivariate and univariate approaches is shown for comparison.

<h3>Resonance Cascades and Number Theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04361" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04361</a>
<br>
<i>Oleksandr V. Marchukov, Maxim Olshanii</i>
<p>In this article, we are interested in situations where the existence of a
contiguous cascade of quantum resonant transitions is predicated on the
validity of a particular statement in number theory. Unexpectedly, the
principal challenge was posed by the design of the perturbation potential: as
we have reported elsewhere, a non-uniform distribution of the transition matrix
elements leads to a localization that arrests mobility. A significant portion
of our paper is devoted to ensuring that uniformity.
As a case study, we look at the following trivial statement: "Any power of
$3$ is an integer." Consequently, we "test" this statement in a numerical
experiment where we demonstrate an un-impeded upward mobility along an
equidistant, $\ln(3)$-spaced subsequence of the energy levels of a potential
with a log-natural spectrum, under a frequency $\ln(3)$ time-periodic
perturbation. We further show when we "remove" $9$ from the set of integers --
by excluding the corresponding energy level from the spectrum -- the cascade
halts abruptly.

<h3>Graphene field-effect transistors for sensing ion-channel coupled  receptors: towards biohybrid nanoelectronics for chemical detection</h3>

<br>
<i>Océane Terral, Guillaume Audic, Arnaud Claudel, Justine Magnat, Aurélie Dupont, Christophe J. Moreau, Cécile Delacour</i>
<p>Graphene field effect transistors (G-FETs) have appeared as suitable
candidates for sensing charges and have thus attracted large interest for ion
and chemical detections. In particular, their high sensitivity, chemical
robustness, transparency and bendability offer a unique combination for
interfacing living and soft matters. Here we have demonstrated their ability to
sense targeted biomolecules, by combining them with ion channels-coupled
receptors (ICCRs). These receptors have been naturally or artificially
expressed within living cell membranes to generate ion fluxes in presence of
chemicals of interest. Here, we have successfully combined those biosensors
with G-FET array which converts the bio-activation of the ICCRs into readable
electronic signals. This hybrid bioelectronic device leverages the advantages
of the biological receptor and the graphene field effect transistor enabling
the selective detection of biomolecules, which is a current shortcoming of
electronic sensors. Additionally, the G-FET allows to discriminate the polarity
of the ion fluxes which otherwise remains hidden from conventional
electrophysiological recordings. The multisite recording ability offered by the
G-FET array rises numerous possibilities for multiscale sensing and high
throughput screening of cellular solutions or analytes, which is of both
fundamental and applied interests in health and environment monitoring.

<h3>Giant piezoelectricity in group IV monochalcogenides with ferroelectric  AA layer stacking</h3>

<br>
<i>Seungjun Lee, Hyeong-Ryul Kim, Wei Jiang, Young-Kyun Kwon, Tony Low</i>
<p>The piezoelectricity of group IV monochalcogenides (MXs, with M = Ge, Sn and
X = S, Se) has attracted much attention due to their substantially higher
piezoelectric coefficients compared to other 2D materials. However, with
increasing layer number, their piezoelectricity rapidly disappears due to the
antiferroelectric stacking order, severely limiting their practical
applications. Using first-principles calculations, we investigated the
piezoelectricity of MXs with the ferroelectric AA stacking configuration, which
has recently been stabilized in experiments. We found that AA-stacked MXs have
a ferroelectric ground state with the smallest lattice constant among other
stacking configurations, resulting in a giant piezoelectric coefficient, which
is the first demonstration of a strategy where the piezoelectric coefficients
can increase with the number of layers. This can be attributed to a strong
negative correlation between the lattice constant along the armchair direction
and the piezoelectric coefficient, and spontaneous compressive strain
stabilized in ferroelectric AA stacking configuration.

<i>Subhajit Paul, Suman Majumder, Wolfhard Janke</i>
<p>Observing spontaneous velocity ordering or flocking during motility induced
phase separation (MIPS) in a system of spherical active Brownian particles
without alignment interaction is challenging. We take up this problem by
performing simulations of spherical active inertial particles with purely
repulsive potential in presence of thermal noise and absence of any explicit
alignment interaction. Our results not only show the presence of MIPS, but also
reveal a micro-flocking transition. We characterize this transition in terms of
a velocity order parameter as well as a characteristic length scale derived
from the spatial correlation of the velocities.

<h3>Understanding the Role of Open Metal Sites in MOFs for the Efficient  Separation of Benzene/Cyclohexane Mixtures</h3>

<i>C. González-Galán, R. M. Madero-Castro, A. Luna-Triguero, J. M. Vicent-Luna, S. Calero</i>
<p>Separating C6 cyclic hydrocarbons, specifically benzene and cyclohexane,
presents a significant industrial challenge due to their similar
physicochemical properties. We conducted Monte Carlo simulations in the
Grand-Canonical ensemble to acquire adsorption properties and separation
performance data for benzene and cyclohexane in three metal-organic frameworks
featuring coordinatively unsaturated metal sites (Ni-MOF-74, Ni-ClBBTA, and
Ni-ClBTDD). The separation performance of these MOFs was analyzed and compared
with literature data for adsorbents of different natures, demonstrating
superior performance. Additionally, we explored the molecular origins of this
effective separation, examining the pore-filling mechanism, interaction of
guest molecules with metal centers, and mutual interactions of each adsorbate.
Our results highlight that the selected adsorbents, with remarkable loading
capacity, can efficiently separate both compounds in a mixture with exceptional
effectiveness.

<h3>Field-dependent magnetic relaxation times of magnetic nanoparticle  systems: analytic approximations supported by numerical simulations</h3>

<br>
<i>Jonathon C. Davidson, Nicholas R. Anderson, Karen L. Livesey</i>
<p>Many estimates for the magnetic relaxation time of magnetic nanoparticle
systems neglect the effect of the applied field strength. This is despite many
applications of magnetic nanoparticles involving relaxation dynamics under the
influence of applied fields. Here, an analytic approximation for the
field-dependent Brownian relaxation time of single-domain, spherical magnetic
nanoparticles in an external applied field is developed mathematically. This
expression is validated by comparison with existing empirically-derived
expressions and by comparison to particle-level simulations that allow particle
rotations. Our approximation works particularly well for larger particles. We
then use the developed expression to analytically calculate the total magnetic
relaxation time when both Brownian and N\'eel relaxation mechanisms are at
play. Again, we show that the results match those found using particle-level
simulations, this time with both particle rotations and internal magnetization
dynamics allowed. However, for some particle parameters and for large field
strengths, our simulations reveal that the Brownian and N\'eel relaxation
mechanisms are decoupled and it is not appropriate to combine these to
calculate a total relaxation time.

<i>Xinwei Wang, Seán R. Kavanagh, David O. Scanlon, Aron Walsh</i>
<p>Antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) is at the forefront of an emerging class of
sustainable photovoltaic materials. Despite notable developments over the past
decade, the light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of Sb2Se3 has reached a
plateau of ~10%. Is this an intrinsic limitation of the material or is there
scope to rival the success of metal halide perovskite solar cells? Here we
assess the trap-limited conversion efficiency of Sb2Se3. First-principles
defect analysis of the hole and electron capture rates for point defects
demonstrates the critical role of vacancies as active recombination centres. We
predict an upper limit of 25% efficiency in Sb2Se3 grown under optimal
equilibrium conditions where the concentrations of charged vacancies are
minimised. We further reveal how the detrimental effect of Se vacancies can be
reduced by extrinsic oxygen passivation, highlighting a pathway to achieve
high-performance metal selenide solar cells close to the thermodynamic limit.

<h3>Resonant Raman scattering of surface phonon polaritons mediated by  excitons in WSe$_2$ films</h3>

<i>L. Zhou, K. Wirth, M. N. Bui, R. Rani, D. Grützmacher, T. Taubner, B. E. Kardynał</i>
<p>Surface phonon-polaritons propagating along interfaces of polar dielectrics
coexist with excitons in many van der Waals heterostructures, so understanding
their mutual interactions is of great interest. Here, we investigate the type I
surface phonon polariton of hBN via low-temperature resonant-Raman spectroscopy
in hBN/WSe2 heterostructures. The resonantly enhanced hBN surface phonon
polariton (SPhP) Raman signal, when laser energy is such that the scattered
photons have energy close to that of the WSe2 excitons, enables detailed
characterization of type I SPhP in hBN even when hBN is one monolayer thick. We
find that the measured bandwidth of the SPhP Raman signal depends on the
thicknesses of the hBN layer. We are able explain the experimental data using
transfer matrix method simulations of SPhP dispersions providing that we assume
the Raman scattering to be momentum non-conserving, as could be the case if
localized WSe2 exciton states participated in the process. We further show that
resonant Raman scattering from SiO2 SPhP can also be mediated by WSe$_2$.

<h3>Casimir and Helmholtz forces in one-dimensional Ising model with  Dirichlet (free) boundary conditions</h3>

<br>
<i>D. M. Dantchev, N. S. Tonchev, J. Rudnick</i>
<p>Attention in the literature has increasingly turned to the issue of the
dependence on ensemble and boundary conditions of fluctuation-induced forces.
We have recently investigated this problem in the one-dimensional Ising model
with periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions (Annals of Physics {\bf
459}, 169533 (2023)). Significant variations of the behavior of Casimir and
Helmholtz forces was observed, depending on both ensemble and boundary
conditions. Here we extend our study by considering the problem in the
important case of Dirichlet (also termed free, or missing neighbors) boundary
conditions. The advantage of the mathematical formulation of the problem in
terms of Chebyshev polynomials is demonstrated and, in this approach,
expressions for the partition functions in the canonical and the grand
canonical ensembles are presented. We prove analytically that the Casimir force
is attractive for all values of temperature and external ordering field, while
the Helmholtz force can be both attractive and repulsive.

<p>Spectroscopies utilizing free electron beams as probes offer detailed
information on the reciprocal-space excitations of 2D materials such as
graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers. Yet, despite the
attention paid to such quantum materials, less consideration has been given to
the electron-beam characterization of 2D periodic nanostructures such as
photonic crystals, metasurfaces, and plasmon arrays, which can exhibit the same
lattice and excitation symmetries as their atomic analogs albeit at drastically
different length, momentum, and energy scales. Due to their lack of covalent
bonding and influence of retarded electromagnetic interactions, important
physical distinctions arise that complicate interpretation of scattering
signals. Here we present a fully-retarded theoretical framework for describing
the inelastic scattering of wide field electron beams from 2D materials and
apply it to investigate the complementarity in sample excitation information
gained in the measurement of a honeycomb plasmon array versus angle-resolved
optical spectroscopy in comparison to single monolayer graphene.

<p>The pyrochlore lattice, a three-dimensional network of corner-sharing
tetrahedra, is a promising material playground for correlated topological
phases arising from the interplay between spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and
electron-electron interactions. Due to its geometrically frustrated lattice
structure, exotic correlated states on the pyrochlore lattice have been
extensively studied using various spin Hamiltonians in the localized limit. On
the other hand, the topological properties of the electronic structure in the
pyrochlore lattice have rarely been explored, due to the scarcity of pyrochlore
materials in the itinerant paramagnetic limit. Here, we explore the topological
electronic band structure of pyrochlore superconductor RbBi$_{2}$ using
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Thanks to the strong SOC of the Bi
pyrochlore network, we experimentally confirm the existence of
three-dimensional (3D) massless Dirac fermions enforced by nonsymmorphic
symmetry, as well as a 3D quadratic band crossing protected by cubic
crystalline symmetry. Furthermore, we identify an additional 3D linear Dirac
dispersion associated with band inversion protected by threefold rotation
symmetry. These observations reveal the rich non-trivial band topology of
itinerant pyrochlore lattice systems in the strong SOC regime. Through
manipulation of electron correlations and SOC of the frustrated pyrochlore
lattices, this material platform is a natural host for exotic phases of matter,
including the fractionalized quantum spin Hall effect in the topological Mott
insulator phase, as well as axion electrodynamics in the axion insulator phase.

<h3>Density Functional Theory Analysis that Explains the Volume Expansion in  Prelithiated Silicon Nanowires</h3>

<br>
<i>Donald C. Boone</i>
<p>This research is a theoretical study that simulates the volume expansion of a
prelithiated silicon nanowire during lithium ion insertion and the application
of an electric current. Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) the ground
state energy E_g (x) of prelithiated silicon (Li_xSi) is define as a function
of the lithium ion (Li+) concentration (x). As the Li+ are increased, E_g (x)
becomes increasingly stable from x=1.00 through x=2.415 and decreases in
stability as the lithium ion concentration becomes x >2.415 until full
lithiation of the silicon nanowire is reached at x=3.75. After the
determination of the lithiated silicon ground state energies an electric
current is applied to the lithiated silicon nanowire at varies Li+
concentrations x. It was discovered that the volume expansion began at
approximately x=3.25 and increased to over 300% of the original volume of a
pristine silicon nanowire at x=3.75 which at this point was full lithiation.
This is in sharp contrast to prior research studies where the ground state
energy was not considered. In previous studies the computation of the volume
expansion starts approximately at x=0.75 and produces a continuous nonlinear
volume expansion until the process was terminated at full lithiation.

<p>This study investigates the catalytic degradation of ground-level ozone on
low-index stoichiometric and reduced CeO$_2$ surfaces using first-principles
calculations. The presence of oxygen vacancies on the surface enhances the
interaction between ozone and catalyst by serving as active sites for
adsorption and decomposition. Our results suggest that the {111} surface has
superior ozone decomposition performance due to unstable oxygen species
resulting from reaction with catalysts. However, when water is present, it
competes with ozone molecules for these active sites, resulting in reduced
catalytic activity or water poisoning. A possible solution could be heat
treatment that reduces the vacancy concentration, thereby increasing the
available adsorption sites for ozone molecules while minimizing competitive
adsorption by water molecules. These results suggest that controlling moisture
content during operation is crucial for the efficient use of CeO$_2$-based
catalysts in industrial applications to reduce ground-level ozone pollution.

<br>
<i>Debashish Mondal, Tanay Nag</i>
<p>Considering a non-Hermitian version of $p$-wave Kitaev chain in the presence
of additional second nearest neighbour tunneling, we study dynamical quantum
phase transition (DQPT) which accounts for the vanishing Loschmidt amplitude.
The locus of the Fisher's zero traces a continuous path on the complex time
plane for the Hermitian case while it becomes discontinuous for non-Hermitian
cases. This further leads to the half-unit jumps in the winding number
characterizing a dynamical topological aspect of DQPT for non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian. Uncovering the interplay between non-Hermiticity and long-range
tunneling, we find these features to be universally present irrespective of the
additional second nearest neighbour tunneling terms as long as non-Hermiticity
is preserved.

<p>The application of atom probe tomography (APT) to frozen liquids is limited
by difficulties in specimen preparation. Here, we report on the use of
nanoporous Cu needles as a physical framework to hold water ice for
investigation using APT. Nanoporous Cu needles are prepared by the
electropolishing and dealloying of Cu-Mn matchstick precursors. Cryogenic
scanning electron microscopy and focused-ion beam milling reveal a
hierarchical, dendritic, highly-wettable microstructure. The atom probe mass
spectrum is dominated by peaks of Cu+ and H(H2O)n+ up to n <= 3, and the
reconstructed volume shows the protrusion of a Cu ligament into an ice-filled
pore. The continuous Cu ligament network electrically connects the apex to the
cryostage, leading to enhanced electric field at the apex and increased
cooling, both of which simplify the mass spectrum compared to previous reports.

<i>H. Y. Yuan, Yaroslav Blanter</i>
<p>Surface plasmons in two-dimensional (2D) electron systems have attracted
great attention for their promising light-matter applications. However, the
excitation of a surface plasmon, in particular, transverse-electric (TE)
surface plasmon, remains an outstanding challenge due to the difficulty to
conserve energy and momentum simultaneously in the normal 2D materials. Here we
show that the TE surface plasmons ranging from gigahertz to terahertz regime
can be effectively excited and manipulated in a hybrid dielectric, 2D material
and magnet structure. The essential physics is that the surface spin wave
supplements an additional freedom of surface plasmon excitation and thus
greatly enhances the electric field in the 2D medium. Based on widely-used
magnetic materials like yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and manganese difluoride
($\mathrm{MnF}_2$), we further show that the plasmon excitation manifests
itself as a measurable dip in the reflection spectrum of the hybrid system
while the dip position and the dip depth can be well controlled by the electric
gating on the 2D layer and an external magnetic field. Our findings should
bridge the fields of low-dimensional physics, plasmonics and spintronics and
open a novel route to integrate plasmonic and spintronic devices.

<i>Chen Sun, Wayne M. Saslow</i>
<p>Ferromagnetic metals and spin-polarized $^{3}$He are spin 1/2 systems with
the same macroscopic symmetry, and thus should have macroscopic magnetic
dynamics with the same structure. Using Onsager's irreversible thermodynamics,
we develop a theory for these systems that contains two relaxation times (one
for the magnetization $\vec{M}$ and the other for the spin current
$\vec{J}_{i}$), a magnetic compressibility, and a mean-field parameter.
Currently spintronics data on metallic ferromagnets are analyzed using a
complex decay length from a theory employing a diffusion constant, a lifetime,
and a mean-field parameter. The present theory leads to a complex decay length
with the same structure. On neglecting decay of $\vec{M}$, the present theory
applies to liquids and gases. For macroscopic equations the particle statistics
is not relevant, so the theory also applies to bosons. The theory predicts a
longitudinal spin wave whose velocity we estimate for liquid $^{3}$He and for
paramagnetic metals; but such a wave should also occur for ferromagnets and for
gases.

quantum critical point (DQCP) in a one-dimensional quantum spin chain by means
of the entanglement entropy and fidelity. Our results show that there is a
close connection between the reconstruction of low-lying excitation spectra and
the DQCP. The precise position of the critical point and its continuous nature
is indicated by the singular behavior of the entanglement and fidelity of the
first-excited state. Furthermore, compared with the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type phase transitions, which also go beyond
the scope of Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm, we attempt to reveal the essence
of different types of symmetries on both sides of the DQPT from different

<p>The remarkable properties of (1T-)TiSe$_2$ among the transition metal

peculiar behavior during the charge density wave (CDW) transition. Therefore,
it is highly desirable to study its electronic structure down to the atomic
orbitals. In the present research, we applied momentum-resolved resonant
photoelectron spectroscopy to study TiSe$_2$ at the Ti2p-Ti3d absorption edge
by using a momentum microscope, which can simultaneously detect the electronic
states in a wide $(k_x,k_y)$ range. We have also used constant initial state
(CIS) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to reveal
the hybridization between the Ti3d and Se4p orbitals within the valence band at
the Gamma point at room temperature. In addition, an interesting result comes
from our analysis of the CIS spectrum for the energy band located at a binding
energy of 2 eV at the M-point. This band, mainly composed of the Se4p orbital,
exhibited a Fano line profile at the Ti2p edge, with a negative value of the
parameter "$q$". This is the first clear evidence of the inter-atomic
interaction during the valence band photoelectron emission process. This
behavior differs significantly from the standard resonant photoelectron
emission, which usually involves intra-atomic interactions. It also differs
from the multi-atom resonant photoelectron emission (MARPE) observed in the
core-level photoelectron emission, as we focus on the photoelectron emission
from the valence band in this research.

<h3>Positron lifetime calculations for defects in Zn</h3>

<p>The effect of the lattice relaxation at vacancy clusters and
interstitial-type dislocation loops on the lifetime of positrons in Zn has been
studied. Defective relaxed structures have been generated for the lifetime
calculations by using a many-body potential for Zn. From the results, it is
inferred that the effect of the atomic relaxation is mainly significant for
small vacancy clusters. The lifetime associated with interstitial-type loops is
very sensitive to the loop structure and its surroundings. Previous
experimental results are compared with the theoretical calculations.

<h3>Confinement enhanced viscosity vs shear thinning in lubricated ice  friction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04700" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04700</a>
<br>
<i>Lukasz Baran, Luis G. MacDowell</i>
<p>The ice surface is known for presenting a very small kinetic friction
coefficient, but the origin of this property remains highly controversial to
date. In this work, we revisit recent computer simulations of ice sliding on
atomically smooth substrates, using newly calculated bulk viscosities for the
TIP4P/Ice water model. The results show that spontaneously formed premelting
films in static conditions exhibit an effective viscosity which is about twice
the bulk viscosity. However, upon approaching sliding speeds in the order of
m/s, the shear rate becomes very large, and the viscosities decrease by several
orders of magnitude. This shows that premelting films can act as an efficient
lubrication layer despite their small thickness, and illustrates an interesting
interplay between confinement enhanced viscosities, and shear thinning. Our
results suggest that the strongly thinned viscosities that operate under the
high speed skating regime could largely reduce the amount of frictional
heating.

<h3>Nonuniversal Equation of State of a Quasi-2D Bose Gas in Dimensional  Crossover</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04703" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04703</a>

<i>Xiaoran Ye, Tao Yu, Zhaoxin Liang</i>
<p>Equation of state (EOS) for a pure two-dimensional (2D) Bose gas exhibits a
logarithmic dependence on the s-wave scattering length [L. Salasnich, Phys.
Rev. Lett. 118, 130402 (2017)]. The pronounced disparity between the EOS of a
2D Bose gas and its 3D counterpart underscores the significance of exploring
the dimensional crossover between these two distinct dimensions. In this work,
we are motivated to deduce nonuniversal corrections to EOS for an optically
trapped Bose gas along the dimensional crossover from 3D to 2D, incorporating
the finite-range effects of the interatomic potential. Employing the framework
of effective field theory, we derive the analytical expressions for both the
ground state energy and quantum depletion. The introduction of the lattice
induces a transition from a 3D to a quasi-2D regime. In particular, we
systematically analyze the asymptotic behaviors of both the 2D and 3D aspects
of the model system, with a specific focus on the nonuniversal effects on the
EOS arising from finite-range interactions. The nonuniversal effects proposed
in this study along the dimensional crossover represent a significant stride
toward unraveling the intricate interplay between dimensionality and quantum
fluctuations.

<h3>Anatomy of localized edge modes in laterally coupled waveguides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04715" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04715</a>
<br>
<i>Vadym Iurchuk, Sven Stienen, Jürgen Lindner, Attila Kákay</i>
<p>We present a systematic micromagnetic study of standing spin-wave modes in
infinitely long Permalloy strips with rectangular cross-section. Using a
finite-element dynamic-matrix method, we first calculate the eigenfrequencies
and the corresponding eigenvectors (mode profiles), as a function of the
in-plane magnetic field applied across the strip. The ferromagnetic resonance
spectra is computed from the mode profiles, assuming a homogeneous
radio-frequency excitation, equivalently to an experimental ferromagnetic
resonance measurement. The investigation of the field-dependent mode profiles
enables for the classification of the observed resonances, here focusing mostly
on the true edge mode localized at the vicinity of strip edges. Furthermore, we
study the mode localization in pairs of 50-nm-thick Permalloy strips as a
function of the strip width and their lateral separation. For closely spaced
strips, the spatial profile of the quasi-uniform mode is substantially modified
due to a significant hybridization with the edge-localized standing spin-wave
modes of the neighbouring strip. We show that a wide-range-tunability of the
localized edge-mode resonances can be achieved with a precise control of the
magnetostatic coupling between the strips. Extreme sensitivity of the edge mode
frequency on the bias field demonstrates a potential of the edge resonances for
field sensing. Furthermore, for narrow strips (~100 nm in width), due to the
reduced number of the allowed confined modes, a field-controllable switching
between the resonances localized either in the strip center or at the edges of
the strips can be achieved.

<h3>Observation of scale-free localized states induced by non-Hermitian  defects</h3>

<p>Wave localization is a fundamental phenomenon that appears universally in
both natural materials and artificial structures and plays a crucial role in
understanding the various physical properties of a system. Usually, a localized
state has an exponential profile with a localization length independent of the
system size. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a new class of localized
states called scale-free localized states, which has an unfixed localization
length scaling linearly with the system size. Using circuit lattices, we
observe that a non-Hermitian defect added to a Hermitian lattice induces an
extensive number of states with scale-free localization. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that, in a lattice with a parity-time-symmetric non-Hermitian
defect, the scale-free localization emerges because of spontaneous parity-time
symmetry breaking. Our results uncover a new type of localized states and
extend the study of defect physics to the non-Hermitian regime.

<h3>Quantum Theory of Spin-Transfer and Spin-Pumping in Collinear  Antiferromagnets and Ferrimagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04719" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04719</a>
<br>
<i>Hans Gløckner Giil, Arne Brataas</i>
<p>Antiferromagnets are promising candidates as active components in spintronic
applications. They share features with ferrimagnets in that opposing spin
orientations exist in two or more sublattices. Spin transfer torque and spin
pumping are essential ingredients in antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnet
spintronics. This paper develops an out-of-equilibrium quantum theory of the
spin dynamics of collinear magnets containing many spins coupled to normal
metal reservoirs. At equilibrium, the spins are parallel or antiparallel to the
easy axis. The theory, therefore, covers collinear antiferromagnets and
ferrimagnets. We focus on the resulting semi-classical spin dynamics. The
dissipation in the spin dynamics is enhanced due to spin-pumping. Spin
accumulations in the normal metals induce deterministic spin-transfer torques
on the magnet. Additionally, each electron's discrete spin angular momentum
causes stochastic fluctuating torques on the antiferromagnet or ferrimagnet. We
derive these fluctuating torques. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem holds at
high temperatures, including the effects of spin-pumping. At low temperatures,
we derive shot noise contributions to the fluctuations.

<h3>The Interaction between Surface Acoustic Wave and Quantum Hall Effects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04724" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04724</a>
<br>
<i>Xiao Liu, Mengmeng Wu, Renfei Wang, Xinghao Wang, Wenfeng Zhang, Yujiang Dong, Rui-Rui Du, Yang Liu, Xi Lin</i>
<p>Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) is a powerful technique for investigating quantum
phases appearing in two-dimensional electron systems. The electrons respond to
the piezoelectric field of SAWthrough screening, attenuating its amplitude and
shifting its velocity, which is described by the relaxation model. In this
work, we systematically study this interaction using orders of magnitude lower
SAW amplitude than that in previous studies. At high magnetic fields when
electrons form highly correlated states such as the quantum Hall effect, we
observe an anomalously large attenuation of SAW while the acoustic speed
remains considerably high, inconsistent with the conventional relaxation model.
This anomaly exists only when the SAW power is sufficiently low.

<h3>Phase stability and mechanical property trends for MAB phases by  high-throughput ab initio calculations</h3>

<br>
<i>Nikola Koutná, Lars Hultman, Paul H. Mayrhofer, Davide G. Sangiovanni</i>
<p>MAB phases (MABs) are atomically-thin laminates of ceramic/metallic-like
layers, having made a breakthrough in the development of 2D materials. Though
theoretically offering a vast chemical and phase space, relatively few MABs
have yet been synthesised. To guide experiments, we perform a systematic
high-throughput {\it{ab initio}} screening of MABs that combine group 4--7
transition metals (M); Al, Si, Ga, Ge, or In (A); and boron (B) focusing on
their phase stability trends and mechanical properties. Considering the 1:1:1,
2:1:1, 2:1:2, 3:1:2, 3:1:3, and 3:1:4 M:A:B ratios and 10 phase prototypes,
possible stabilisation of a single-phase compound for each elemental
combination is assessed through formation energy spectra of the competing
mechanically and dynamically stable MABs. Based on the volumetric proximity of
energetically-close phases, we identify systems in which volume-changing
deformations may facilitate transformation toughening. Subsequently, chemistry-
and phase-structure-related trends in the elastic stiffness and ductility are
predicted using elastic-constants-based descriptors. The analysis of
directional Cauchy pressures and Young's moduli allows comparing mechanical
response parallel and normal to M--B/A layers. Among the suggested most
promising MABs are Nb$_3$AlB$_4$, Cr$_2$SiB$_2$, Mn$_2$SiB$_2$ or the already
synthesised MoAlB.

<h3>Emergent Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless and Kugel-Khomskii physics in  the triangular lattice bilayer colbaltate</h3>

<br>
<i>Gang V. Chen</i>
<p>Motivated by the experiments on the triangular lattice bilayer colbaltate
K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$, we formulate a theory to explore the underlying
physics from a couple observation. The model is composed of interacting
Co$^{2+}$ dimers on the triangular lattice, where the Co$^{2+}$ ion provides an
effective spin-1/2 local moment via the spin-orbit coupling and the crystal
field effect. The intra-dimer interaction is dominant and would simply favor
the local spin singlet, and the inter-dimer interactions compete with the
inter-dimer interaction, leading to rich behaviors. With the easy-axis
anisotropy, it is shown that, in the ground state manifold of the intra-dimer
Ising interaction, the system realizes an effective transverse field Ising
model, where the ground state is either a three-sublattice order or Ising
disordered. The finite temperature regime naturally realizes the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless physics. To explore the full excitations, we
incorporate the excited state manifold of the intra-dimer Ising interaction and
establish the emergent Kugel-Khomskii physics. Thus, the triangular lattice
bilayer colbaltate is an excellent platform to explore the interplay between
geometrical frustration and anisotropic interactions as well as the emergent
effective models and the resulting physics.

<p>The displacement of a single electron enables exciting avenues for
nanotechnology with vast application potential in quantum metrology, quantum
communication and quantum computation. Surface acoustic waves (SAW) have proven
itself as a surprisingly useful solution to perform this task over large
distance with outstanding precision and reliability. Over the last decade,
important milestones have been achieved bringing SAW-driven single-electron
transport from first proof-of-principle demonstrations to accurate,
highly-controlled implementations, such as coherent spin transport,
charge-to-photon conversion, or antibunching of charge states. Beyond the
well-established piezoelectric gallium-arsenide platform, first realisations of
acousto-electronic transport have also been carried out on the surface of
liquid helium. In this review article, we aim to keep track of this remarkable
progress by explaining these recent achievements from basic principles, with an
outlook on follow-up experiments and near-term applications.

<p>Theoretical positron lifetime values have been calculated systematically for
most of the elements of the Periodic Table. Self-consistent and
non-self-consistent schemes have been used for the calculation of the
electronic structure in the solid, as well as different parameterizations for
the positron enhancement factor and correlation energy. The results obtained
have been studied and compared with experimental data, confirming the
theoretical trends. As it is known, positron lifetimes in bulk show a periodic
behaviour with atomic number. These calculations also confirm that monovacancy
lifetimes follow the same behaviour. From this fact a strong relation between
the atomic volume and the positron lifetime has been set. The effects of
enhancement factors used in calculations have been commented. Finally, we have
analysed the effects that f and d electrons cause in positron lifetimes.

<p>Forces and torques exerted by a superconducting torus on a permanent magnet
have been mapped. It is demonstrated that stable orbits exist. Moreover,
provided that the magnet remains in any of these orbits, the first critical
field in the superconductor is never overpassed and the superconductor remains
in the Meissner state. The consequent absence of hysteresis makes these kinds
of device perfect candidates for non-frictional bearings or gyroscopes.

<h3>Suppression of nucleation density in twisted graphene domains grown on  graphene/SiC template by sequential thermal process</h3>

<br>
<i>Yao Yao, Taiki Inoue, Makoto Takamura, Yoshitaka Taniyasu, Yoshihiro Kobayashi</i>
<p>We investigated the growth of twisted graphene on graphene/silicon carbide
(SiC-G) templates by metal-free chemical vapor deposition (CVD) through a
sequential thermal (ST) process, which exploits the ultraclean surface of SiC-G
without exposing the surface to air before CVD. By conducting control
experiments with SiC-G templates exposed to air (AirE process), structural
analysis by atomic force microscopy revealed that the nucleation density of CVD
graphene (CVD-G) was significantly suppressed in the ST process under the same
growth condition. The nucleation behavior on SiC-G surfaces is observed to be
very sensitive to carbon source concentration and process temperature. The
nucleation on the ultraclean surface of SiC-G prepared by the ST process
requires higher partial pressure of carbon source compared with that on the
surface by the AirE process. Moreover, analysis of CVD-G growth over a wide
temperature range indicates that nucleation phenomena change dramatically with
a threshold temperature of 1300{\deg}C, possibly due to arising of etching
effects. The successful synthesis of twisted few-layer graphene (tFLG) was
affirmed by Raman spectroscopy, in which analysis of the G' band proves a high
ratio of twisted structure in CVD-G. These results demonstrate that metal-free
CVD utilizing ultraclean templates is an effective approach for the scalable
production of large-domain tFLG that is valuable for electronic applications.

<i>O. Contreras-Vergara, G. Valencia-Ortega, N. Sánchez-Salas, J. I. Jiménez-Aquino</i>
<p>This paper focuses on the coefficient of performance (COP) at maximum figure
of merit $\chi$ for a Brownian Carnot-like refrigerator, within the context of
symmetric Low-Dissipation approach. Our proposal is based on the Langevin
equation for a Brownian particle bounded to a harmonic potential trap, which
can perform Carnot-like cycles at finite time. We show that under quasistatic
conditions the COP has the same expression as the macroscopic Carnot
refrigerator. However, for irreversible cycles at finite time and under
symmetric dissipation, the optimal COP is the counterpart of Curzon-Ahlborn
efficiency for irreversible macroscopic refrigerators.

<h3>Extreme near-field heat transfer between silica surfaces</h3>

<br>
<i>Ali Rajabpour, Julien El Hajj, Mauricio Gómez Viloria, Riccardo Messina, Philippe Ben-Abdallah, Yangyu Guo, Samy Merabia</i>
<p>Despite recent experiments exhibiting an impressive enhancement in radiative
heat flux between parallel planar silica surfaces with gap sizes of about 10
nm, the exploration of sub-nanometric gap distances remains unexplored. In this
work, by employing non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations, we
study the heat transfer between two SiO2 plates in both their amorphous and
crystalline forms. When the gap size is 2 nm, we find that the heat transfer
coefficient experiences a substantial ~30-fold increase compared to the
experimental value at the gap size of 10 nm confirming the dependence on the
distance inversely quadratic as predicted by the fluctuational electrodynamics
(FE) theory. Comparative analysis between NEMD and FE reveals a generally good
agreement, particularly for amorphous silica. Spectral heat transfer analysis
demonstrates the profound influence of gap size on heat transfer, with peaks
corresponding to the resonances of dielectric function. Deviations from
fluctuational electrodynamics theory at smaller gap sizes are interpreted in
the context of acoustic phonon tunneling and the effects of a gradient of
permittivity close to the surfaces.

<h3>Ab initio study of subsurface diffusion of Cu on the H-passivated  Si(001) surface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04804" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04804</a>
<br>
<i>A. Rodriguez-Prieto, D. R. Bowler</i>
<p>In this paper we use density-functional theory calculations to analyze both
the stability and diffusion of Cu adatoms near and on the H-passivated Si(001)
surface. Two different Cu sources are considered: depositing Cu from vacuum,
and contaminating Cu outdiffusing from bulk Si. Deposited Cu from vacuum
quickly moves subsurface to an interstitial site in the third Si layer (T2).
Once there, Cu adatoms enter a subsurface zigzag migration route between T2 and
another subsurface site, T2->HSL->T2, along the dimer row direction.
Contaminating Cu outdiffusing from bulk is found to be a fast diffuser along
both parallel and perpendicular directions to the dimer row when far from the
surface. It is attracted to the layers close to the surface and becomes trapped
at an interstitial site located at the sixth Si layer (T3). As the outdiffusing
Cu atoms get closer to the surface, a channeling zigzag diffusion along the
dimer row direction, similar to that one followed by deposited Cu from vacuum,
is favoured over diffusion along the perpendicular direction. These results are
consistent with previous experimental work done on similar systems and will
motivate further experiments on the interesting interaction between Cu and Si
surfaces.

<h3>YBa$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuFeO$_{5}$ layered perovskites: exploring the  magnetic order beyond the paramagnetic-collinear-spiral triple point</h3>

<br>
<i>Victor Porée, Dariusz J. Gawryluk, Tian Shang, J. Alberto Rodríguez-Velamazań, Nicola Casati, Denis Sheptyakov, Xavier Torrelles, Marisa Medarde</i>
<p>Layered perovskites of general formula AA'CuFeO$_5$ are one of the few
examples of cycloidal spiral magnets where the ordering temperatures
$T_{spiral}$ can be tuned far beyond room temperature by introducing modest
amounts of Cu/Fe chemical disorder in the crystal structure. This rare property
makes these materials prominent candidates to host multiferroicity and
magnetoelectric coupling at room temperature. Moreover, it has been proposed
that the highest $T_{spiral}$ value that can be reached in this structural
family ($\sim$ 400 K) corresponds to a paramagnetic-collinear-spiral triple
point with potential to show exotic physics. Since generating high amounts of
Cu/Fe disorder is experimentally difficult, the phase diagram region beyond the
triple point has been barely explored. To fill this gap we investigate here the
YBa$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuFeO$_{5}$ solid solutions ($0 \leq x \leq 1$), where we
replace Ba with Sr with the aim of enhancing the impact of the experimentally
available Cu/Fe disorder. Using a combination of bulk magnetization,
synchrotron X-ray and neutron powder diffraction we show that the spiral state
is destabilized beyond a critical degree of Cu/Fe disorder, being replaced by a
non-frustrated, fully antiferromagnetic state with propagation vector k$_{c2}$
= $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, 0)$ and ordering temperature $T_{coll2}$ $\geq$
$T_{spiral}$, which is progressively stabilized beyond the triple point.
Interestingly, $T_{spiral}$ and $T_{coll2}$ increase with $x$ at the same rate.
This suggests a common, disorder-driven origin, consistent with theoretical
predictions.

number in all the calculation methods and it is in agreement with selected
experimental data. The ratio shows, in contradiction to previous assumptions,
sensitiveness to the approximations used in the calculations. This extensive
work has allowed us to study and enlighten features of the theory and computing
methods broadly used nowadays in simulating, studying and understanding
positronic parameters.

<p>Neural network force fields have significantly advanced ab initio atomistic
simulations across diverse fields. However, their application in the realm of
magnetic materials is still in its early stage due to challenges posed by the
subtle magnetic energy landscape and the difficulty of obtaining training data.
Here we introduce a data-efficient neural network architecture to represent
density functional theory total energy, atomic forces, and magnetic forces as
functions of atomic and magnetic structures. Our approach incorporates the
principle of equivariance under the three-dimensional Euclidean group into the
neural network model. Through systematic experiments on various systems,
including monolayer magnets, curved nanotube magnets, and moir\'e-twisted
bilayer magnets of $\text{CrI}_{3}$, we showcase the method's high efficiency
and accuracy, as well as exceptional generalization ability. The work creates
opportunities for exploring magnetic phenomena in large-scale materials

<h3>Fine-Tuning of the Excitonic Response in Monolayer WS2 Domes via Coupled  Pressure and Strain Variation</h3>

<i>Elena Stellino, Beatrice D'Alò, Elena Blundo, Paolo Postorino, Antonio Polimeni</i>
<p>We present a spectroscopic investigation into the vibrational and
optoelectronic properties of WS2 domes in the 0-0.65 GPa range. The pressure
evolution of the system morphology, deduced by the combined analysis of Raman
and photoluminescence spectra, revealed a significant variation in the dome's
aspect ratio. The modification of the dome shape caused major changes in the
mechanical properties of the system resulting in a sizable increase of the
out-of-plane compressive strain while keeping the in-plane tensile strain
unchanged. The variation of the strain gradients drives a non-linear behavior
in both the exciton energy and radiative recombination intensity, interpreted
as the consequence of a hybridization mechanism between the electronic states
of two distinct minima in the conduction band. Our results indicate that
pressure and strain can be efficiently combined in low dimensional systems with
unconventional morphology to obtain modulations of the electronic band
structure not achievable in planar crystals.

<p>We propose a novel approach to evaluating the ionic Seebeck coefficient in
electrolytes from relatively short equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations,
based on the Green-Kubo theory of linear response and Bayesian regression
analysis. By exploiting the probability distribution of the off-diagonal
elements of a Wishart matrix, we develop a consistent and unbiased estimator
for the Seebeck coefficient whose statistical uncertainty can be arbitrarily
reduced in the long-time limit. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we
benchmark it against extensive equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations
conducted on molten $\mathrm{CsF}$ using empirical force fields. We then employ
this procedure to calculate the Seebeck coefficient of molten $\mathrm{NaCl}$,
$\mathrm{KCl}$ and $\mathrm{LiCl}$ using neural-network force fields trained on

<p>The magnetic susceptibility of self-organized two-dimensional Co nanodots on
Au(111) has been measured as a function of their size in the 2-7~nm diameter
range. We show that the activation energy for the thermal reversal displays a
power law behavior with the dot volume. Atomic scale simulations based on the
Heisenberg hamiltonian show that this behavior is due to a deviation from the
macrospin model for dot size as small as 3~nm in diameter. This discrepancy is
attributed to finite temperature effects through the thermal excitation of
spin-wave modes inside the particles

<h3>On correctly assessing the reversibility of the magnetocaloric effect  from indirect measurements</h3>

<p>The adiabatic temperature change ($\Delta T_{ad}$) of a magnetic refrigerant
can be indirectly estimated through field ($H$) and temperature ($T$) dependent
magnetization ($M$) and specific heat ($C_p$) measurements. A direct
integration approach for this estimation is frequently reported, which is an
approximation to a rigorous mathematical approach. In this work, we propose an
iterative method in small $H$ steps, to estimate $\Delta T_{ad}$ from indirect
measurements. We show that this approach is able to reproduce the reversibility
of the magnetocaloric effect, and provides a more accurate estimation of
$\Delta T_{ad}$, up to 10\% when considering a detailed $M(H,T)$ and $Cp(H,T)$
dataset that reproduces the magnetothermal properties of gadolinium, a
benchmark room-temperature magnetic refrigerant.

<h3>Modulation Mechanism of Ionic Transport through Short Nanopores by  Charged Exterior Surfaces</h3>

<p>Short nanopores have various applications in biosensing, desalination, and
energy conversion. Here, the modulation of charged exterior surfaces on ionic
transport is investigated through simulations with sub-200 nm long nanopores
under applied voltages. Detailed analysis of ionic current, electric field
strength, and fluid flow inside and outside nanopores reveals that charged
exterior surfaces can increase ionic conductance by increasing both the
concentration and migration speed of charge carriers. The electric double
layers near charged exterior surfaces provide an ion pool and an additional
passageway for counterions, which lead to enhanced exterior surface conductance
and ionic concentrations at pore entrances and inside the nanopore. We also
report that charges on the membrane surfaces increase electric field strengths
inside nanopores. The effective width of a ring with surface charges placed at
pore entrances (Lcs) is considered as well by studying the dependence of the
current on Lcs. We find a linear relationship between the effective Lcs and the
surface charge density and voltage, and an inverse relationship between the
geometrical pore length and salt concentration. Our results elucidate the
modulation mechanism of charged exterior surfaces on ionic transport through
short nanopores, which is important for the design and fabrication of porous
membranes.

<h3>Energy Dissipation to Tungsten Surfaces upon Eley-Rideal Recombination  of N2 and H2</h3>

<i>O. Galparsoro, R. Pétuya, J.I. Juaristi, C. Crespos, M. Alducin, P. Larrégaray</i>
<p>Quasiclassical molecular dynamics simulations are performed to investigate
energy dissipation to the (100) and (110) tungsten surfaces upon Eley-Rideal
(ER) recombination of H2 and N2. Calculations are carried out within the single
adsorbate limit under normal incidence. A generalized Langevin surface
oscillator (GLO) scheme is used to simulate the coupling to phonons, whereas
electron-hole (e-h) pair excitations are implemented using the local density
friction approximation (LDFA). Phonon excitations are found to reduce the ER
reactivity for N2 recombination, but do not affect H abstraction. In contrast,
the effect of e-h pair excitations on the ER recombination cross section is
small for N2, but can be important for H2. The analysis of the energy lost by
the recombined species shows that most of the energy is dissipated into phonon
excitations in the N2 recombination and into electronic excitations in the H2
recombination. In all cases, the energy dissipated into e-h pairs is taken away
from the translational kinetic energy of the formed molecules, whereas
dissipation to phonons, only significant for N2, also affects vibration.
Interestingly, the electron mediated energy losses are found to be smaller in
the case of N2 when surface motion is allowed.

<h3>Quantum vortex stability in draining fluid flows</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04961" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04961</a>
<br>
<i>Sam Patrick</i>
<p>Quantum vortices with more than a single circulation quantum are usually
unstable and decay into clusters of smaller vortices. One way to prevent the
decay is to place the vortex at the centre of a convergent (draining) fluid
flow, which tends to force vortices together. It is found that whilst the
primary splitting instability is suppressed in this way (and completely
quenched for strong enough flows) a secondary instability can emerge in
circular trapping geometries. This behaviour is related to an instability of
rotating black holes when superradiantly amplified waves are confined inside a
reflective cavity. The end state of the secondary instability is dramatic,
manifesting as a shock wave that propagates round the circular wall and
nucleates many more vortices.

<p>A central paradigm of non-equilibrium physics concerns the dynamics of
heterogeneity and disorder, impacting processes ranging from the behavior of
glasses1 to the emergent functionality of active matter. Understanding these
complex mesoscopic systems requires probing the microscopic trajectories
associated with irreversible processes, the role of fluctuations and entropy
growth, and the timescales on which non-equilibrium responses are ultimately
maintained. Approaches that illuminate these processes in model systems may
enable a more general understanding of other heterogeneous non-equilibrium
phenomena, and potentially define ultimate speed and energy cost limits for
information processing technologies. Here, we apply ultrafast single shot x-ray
photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to resolve the non-equilibrium,
heterogeneous, and irreversible mesoscale dynamics during a light-induced phase
transition. This approach defines a new way of capturing the nucleation of the
induced phase, the formation of transient mesoscale defects at the boundaries
of the nuclei, and the eventual disappearance of these defects, even in systems
with complex polarization topologies. A non-equilibrium, sub-diffusive response
spanning >10 orders of magnitude in timescales is observed with multistep
behavior similar to the plateaus observed in supercooled liquids or glasses. We
show how the observed time-dependent long-time correlations can be understood
in terms of the stochastic dynamics of domain walls, encoded in effective
waiting-time distributions with power-law tails. This work defines new
possibilities for probing the non-equilibrium dynamics of disordered and
heterogeneous media.

<br>
<i>Raphael Saiseau, Henri Truong, Thomas Guérin, Ulysse Delabre, Jean-Pierre Delville</i>
<p>Domain decay is at the heart of the so-called evaporation-condensation
Ostwald-ripening regime of phase ordering kinetics, where the growth of large
domains occurs at the expense of smaller ones, which are expected to
`evaporate'. We experimentally investigate such decay dynamics at the level of
a single spherical domain picked from one phase in coexistence and brought into
the other phase by an opto-mechanical approach, in a near-critical
phase-separated binary liquid mixture. We observe that the decay dynamics is
generally not compatible with the theoretically expected surface-tension decay
laws for conserved order parameters. Using a mean-field description, we
quantitatively explain this apparent disagreement by the stratification of
solute concentrations induced by gravity close to a critical point. Finally, we
determine the conditions for which buoyancy becomes negligible compared to
capillarity and perform dedicated experiments that retrieve the predicted
surface-tension induced decay exponent. The surface-tension driven decay
dynamics of conserved order parameter systems in the presence and the absence
of gravity, is thus established at the level of a single domain.

spin models. We dressed the spins with a randomly distributed length and we
alternated long-range spin exchanges with conventional single spin flip Monte
Carlo updates, both accepted with a stochastic rule which respects detailed
balance. We show that this algorithm, when applied to the bidimensional
Edwards-Anderson model, speeds up significantly the relaxation at low
temperatures and manages to find ground states with high efficiency and little
computational cost. The exploration of spin models should help in understanding
why SWAP accelerates the evolution of particle systems and shed light on
relations between dynamics and free-energy landscapes.

<h3>Heat transport through an open coupled scalar field theory hosting  stability-to-instability transition</h3>

<br>
<i>T. R. Vishnu, Dibyendu Roy</i>
<p>We investigate heat transport through a one-dimensional open coupled scalar
field theory, depicted as a network of harmonic oscillators connected to
thermal baths at the boundaries. The non-Hermitian dynamical matrix of the
network undergoes a stability-to-instability transition at the exceptional
points as the coupling strength between the scalar fields increases. The open
network in the unstable regime, marked by the emergence of inverted oscillator
modes, does not acquire a steady state, and the heat conduction is then
unbounded for general bath couplings. In this work, we engineer a unique bath
coupling where a single bath is connected to two fields at each edge with the
same strength. This configuration leads to a finite steady-state heat
conduction in the network, even in the unstable regime. We also study general
bath couplings, e.g., connecting two fields to two separate baths at each
boundary, which shows an exciting signature of approaching the unstable regime
for massive fields. We derive analytical expressions for high-temperature
classical heat current through the network for different bath couplings at the
edges and compare them. Furthermore, we determine the temperature dependence of
low-temperature quantum heat current in different cases. Our study will help to
probe topological phases and phase transitions in various quadratic Hermitian
bosonic models whose dynamical matrices resemble non-Hermitian Hamiltonians,
hosting exciting topological phases.

<h3>Challenges and opportunities in the supervised learning of quantum  circuit outputs</h3>

<br>
<i>Simone Cantori, Sebastiano Pilati</i>
<p>Recently, deep neural networks have proven capable of predicting some output
properties of relevant random quantum circuits, indicating a strategy to
emulate quantum computers alternative to direct simulation methods such as,
e.g., tensor-network methods. However, the reach of this alternative strategy
is not yet clear. Here we investigate if and to what extent neural networks can
learn to predict the output expectation values of circuits often employed in
variational quantum algorithms, namely, circuits formed by layers of CNOT gates
alternated with random single-qubit rotations. On the one hand, we find that
the computational cost of supervised learning scales exponentially with the
inter-layer variance of the random angles. This allows entering a regime where
quantum computers can easily outperform classical neural networks. On the other
hand, circuits featuring only inter-qubit angle variations are easily emulated.
In fact, thanks to a suitable scalable design, neural networks accurately
predict the output of larger and deeper circuits than those used for training,
even reaching circuit sizes which turn out to be intractable for the most
common simulation libraries, considering both state-vector and tensor-network
algorithms. We provide a repository of testing data in this regime, to be used
for future benchmarking of quantum devices and novel classical algorithms.

<h3>Observation of Giant Spin Splitting and d-wave Spin Texture in Room  Temperature Altermagnet RuO2</h3>

<i>Zihan Lin, Dong Chen, Wenlong Lu, Xin Liang, Shiyu Feng, Kohei Yamagami, Jacek Osiecki, Mats Leandersson, Balasubramanian Thiagarajan, Junwei Liu, Claudia Felser, Junzhang Ma</i>
<p>Recently, a novel magnetic phase called altermagnetism has been proposed,
ushering in a third distinct magnetic phase beyond ferromagnetism and
antiferromagnetism. It is expected that this groundbreaking phase exhibits
unique physical properties such as C-paired spin-valley locking, anomalous Hall
effect, nontrivial Berry phase, and giant magnetoresistance, etc. Among all the
predicted candidates, several room temperature altermagnets are suggested to
host significant potential applications in the near future. Nevertheless,
direct evidence about the spin pattern of the room temperature altermagnet is
still unrevealed. Previous studies found that RuO2 is identified as the most
promising candidate for room temperature d-wave altermagnetism, exhibiting a
substantial spin splitting of up to 1.4 eV. In this study, utilizing
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we report experimental
observation of the spin splitting in RuO2. Furthermore, employing spin-ARPES,
we directly observed the d-wave spin pattern. Our results unequivocally show
that RuO2 is a perfect d-wave altermagnet with great potential for upcoming
spintronic applications.

<p>We measured the far-infrared reflectivity of a KH2PO4 single crystal up to
pressures of 2 GPa in the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. We find that
the nu4 vibrational mode of the PO4 tetrahedron is strongly affected by the
applied pressure. At ambient pressure this phonon is destabilized by the
presence of the H ions and hence shows a highly damped character, beyond the
phonon propagation threshold. Applying a pressure close to 0.6 GPa makes this
phonon clearly underdamped. Its behavior closely follows the soft-mode behavior
observed in Raman spectroscopy. Our results solve a long standing open problem,
demonstrating that the nu4 mode is the excitation mediating the coupling of the
hydrogen network to the lattice modes that create the ferroelectic polarization
in KH2PO4.

<i>M. Dolgushev, T.V. Mendes, B. Gorin, K. Xie, N. Levernier, O. Bénichou, H. Kellay, R. Voituriez, T. Guérin</i>
<p>Splitting probabilities quantify the likelihood of a given outcome out of
competitive events for general random processes. This key observable of random
walk theory, historically introduced as the Gambler's ruin problem for a player
in a casino, has a broad range of applications beyond mathematical finance in
evolution genetics, physics and chemistry, such as allele fixation, polymer
translocation, protein folding and more generally competitive reactions. The
statistics of competitive events is well understood for memoryless (Markovian)
processes. However, in complex systems such as polymer fluids, the motion of a
particle should typically be described as a process with memory. Appart from
scaling theories and perturbative approaches in one-dimension, the outcome of
competitive events is much less characterized analytically for processes with
memory. Here, we introduce an analytical approach that provides the splitting
probabilities for general $d$-dimensional non-Markovian Gaussian processes.
This analysis shows that splitting probabilities are critically controlled by
the out of equilibrium statistics of reactive trajectories, observed after the
first passage. This hallmark of non-Markovian dynamics and its quantitative
impact on splitting probabilities are directly evidenced in a prototypical
experimental reaction scheme in viscoelastic fluids. Altogether, these results
reveal both experimentally and theoretically the importance of memory effects
on competitive reactions.

<h3>Realization of Wess-Zumino-Witten transitions with levels $k=6$ and  $k=4$ in a frustrated spin-3 chain</h3>

<br>
<i>Natalia Chepiga</i>
<p>We study dimerization transitions in a frustrated spin-3 chain with
next-nearest neighbor and three-site interactions. We show that two independent
coupling constants of the model are sufficient to fine-tune the system to the
critical point in the Wess-Zumino-Witten SU(2)$_6$ universality class. This
critical point appears as the end point of an extended SU(2)$_4$ critical line.
This implies that the renormalization group flow lead to the critical theory
with the largest level $k$ such that the number of relevant operators is
reduced by one and the parity of the level is preserved. We also report the
appearance of non-magnetic Ising transition between the topologically trivial
uniform and dimerized phases. This transition takes place within the singlet
sector, while magnetic gap remains open.

<h3>Critical behavior of a phase transition in the dynamics of interacting  populations</h3>

<br>
<i>Thibaut Arnoulx de Pirey, Guy Bunin</i>
<p>Many-variable differential equations with random coefficients provide
powerful models for the dynamics of many interacting species in ecology. These
models are known to exhibit a dynamical phase transition from a phase where
population sizes reach a fixed point, to a phase where they fluctuate
indefinitely. This transition has parallels with models developed in other
fields, but also distinct features that stem from the requirement that the
variables represent non-negative population sizes.
Abstract Here we provide a theory for the critical behavior close to the
phase transition. We show that there are three different universality classes,
depending on the distance from the critical point, and the migration rate which
couples the system to its surroundings. We derive scaling relations for two
parameters, the size of the temporal fluctuations, and the correlation
timescale. We show that the temporal fluctuations grow continuously upon
crossing the transition, and that timescales diverge near the transition (a
critical slowing down). We define and calculate the corresponding critical
exponents.

<i>Ittai Fraenkel, Jorge Kurchan, Dov Levine</i>
<p>It is often stated that if one is presented with a snapshot of the positions
of the molecules of a glass and one of a liquid, one is unable to tell the
difference. Here we argue instead that given several such snapshots taken over
a time-interval, even without specifying the times, there is a definite
procedure to assess precisely the level of glassiness: it suffices to
concatenate the snapshots side-by-side, and to subject the joint picture to a
lossless compression protocol. We argue that the size of the compressed file
yields a direct and unambiguous measure of the `vibrational' and
`configurational' entropies, and may be used to study the associated glass
length scale in or out of equilibrium through the size and frequency of the
repeated motifs essential to the compression, a quantity that would diverge at
a putative glass transition.

<h3>Electronic structure and magnetic tendencies of trilayer  La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure: structural transition, molecular  orbitals, and layer differentiation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05085" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05085</a>
<br>
<i>Harrison LaBollita, Jesse Kapeghian, Michael R. Norman, Antia S. Botana</i>
<p>Motivated by the recent observation of superconductivity in the pressurized
trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate, we explore its
structural, electronic, and magnetic properties as a function of hydrostatic
pressure from first-principles calculations. We find that in both the bilayer
and trilayer nickelates, an orthorhombic(monoclinic)-to-tetragonal transition
under pressure takes place concomitantly with the onset of superconductivity.
The electronic structure of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ can be understood using a
molecular trimer basis wherein $n$ molecular subbands arise as the $d_{z^2}$
orbitals hybridize strongly along the $c$-axis within the trilayer. The
magnetic tendencies indicate that the ground state at ambient pressure is
formed by nonmagnetic inner planes and stripe-ordered outer planes that are
antiferromagnetically coupled along the $c$ axis, resulting in an unusual
$\uparrow$, 0, $\downarrow$ stacking that is consistent with the spin density
wave model suggested by neutron diffraction. Such a state is destabilized by
the pressures wherein superconductivity arises. Despite the presence of
$d_{z^2}$ states at the Fermi level, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals also play a key
role in the electronic structure of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. This active role of
the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states in the low-energy physics of the trilayer RP
nickelate, together with the distinct electronic behavior of inner and outer
planes, resembles the physics of multilayer cuprates.

<i>Thibaut Arnoulx de Pirey</i>
<p>This research presents a universal mapping between two key concepts in the
study of stochastic processes: nonequilibrium steady-states under confinement
and extreme value statistics, focusing on one-dimensional systems. The mapping
holds irrespectively of the statistics of the noise driving the dynamics. This
result is based on a novel approach that provides an exact trajectory-wise
solution for first-order dynamics near a hard-wall boundary. I first
demonstrate the applicability of this method by efficiently reproducing known
results from Brownian motion theory, such as the distribution of the running
maximum, and by deriving new ones, such as the survival probability below a
specific curve with conditioning on the endpoint value. I then extend the
analysis to non-Markovian processes, focusing on run-and-tumble particles. The
mapping to a steady-state allows to compute several quantities of interest,
such as the long-time probability that run-and-tumble and Brownian particles do
not cross each other.

<br>
<i>Chen Li, Qi Liang, Pradyumna Paranjape, RuGway Wu, Jörg Schmiedmayer</i>
<p>We implement two types of matter wave interferometers using trapped
Bose-condensed Feshbach molecules, from weak to strong interactions. In each
case, we focus on investigating interaction effects and their implications for
the performance. In the Ramsey-type interferometer where the interference
between the two motional quantum states in an optical lattice is observed,
inter-particle interactions are found to induce energy shifts in the states.
Consequently, this results in a reduction of the interferometer frequency and
introduces a phase shift during the lattice pulses used for state manipulation.
Furthermore, non-uniformity leads to dephasing and collisional losses of
condensate contribute to the degradation of contrast. In the Michelson-type
interferometer, where matter waves are spatially split and recombined in a
waveguide, interference is observed in the presence of significant interaction,
however coherence degrades with increasing interaction strength. Notably,
coherence is also observed in thermal clouds, indicating the white-color nature
of the implemented Michelson interferometer.

<h3>Motile bacteria crossing liquid-liquid interfaces</h3>

<i>Jiyong Cheon, Joowang Son, Sungbin Lim, Robert J. Mitchell, Jaeup U. Kim, Joonwoo Jeong</i>
<p>Real-life bacteria often swim in complex fluids, but our understanding of the
interactions between bacteria and complex surroundings is still evolving. In
this work, rod-like $\textit{Bacillus subtilis}$ swims in a quasi-2D
environment with aqueous liquid-liquid interfaces, i.e., the isotropic-nematic
coexistence phase of an aqueous chromonic liquid crystal. Focusing on the
bacteria motion near and at the liquid-liquid interfaces, we collect and
quantify bacterial trajectories from the isotropic to the nematic phase.
Despite its small magnitude, the interfacial tension of the order of 10
$\mathrm{\mu N/m}$ at the isotropic-nematic interface justifies our
observations that bacteria swimming more perpendicular to the interface have a
higher probability of crossing the interface. Our force-balance model,
considering the interfacial tension, further predicts how the length and speed
of the bacteria affect their crossing behaviors.

<p>Progress in the study of infinite-layer nickelates has always been highly
linked to materials advances. In particular, the recent development of
superconductivity via hole-doping was predicated on the controlled synthesis of
Ni in a very high oxidation state, and subsequent topotactic reduction to a
very low oxidation state, currently limited to epitaxial thin films. Here we
demonstrate a process to combine these steps with a heterostructure which
includes an epitaxial soluble buffer layer, enabling the release of
freestanding membranes of (Nd,Sr)NiO2 encapsulated in SrTiO3, which serves as a
protective layer. The membranes have comparable structural and electronic
properties to that of optimized thin films, and range in lateral dimensions
from millimeters to ~100 micron fragments, depending on the degree of strain
released with respect to the initial substrate. The changes in the
superconducting transition temperature associated with membrane release are
quite similar to those reported for substrate and pressure variations,
suggestive of a common underlying mechanism. These membranes structures should
provide a versatile platform for a range of experimental studies and devices
free from substrate constraints.

<h3>Vortex spin liquid with neutral Fermi surface and fractional quantum  spin Hall effect at odd integer filling of moiré Chern band</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05112" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05112</a>
<br>
<i>Ya-Hui Zhang</i>
<p>There have been many progress in realizing integer and fractional quantum
anomalous Hall (QAH) phases in moir\'e systems with nearly flat Chern band.
More recently there is even observation of a time reversal invariant fractional
phase at filling $n=3$ in twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayer at small twist angle,
indicating completely new physics beyond the conventional quantum Hall systems.
While an obvious interpretation is from decoupled FQAH phases in the two
valleys, the absence of similar phases at fillings such as
$n=\frac{2}{3}+\frac{2}{3}$ is at odds with it and suggests physics unique to
the odd integer filling $n=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}$. In this work we start from
a pair of composite Fermi liquids (CFL) with opposite chiralities in the two
valleys and consider the possible proximate phase after adding the inter-valley
correlation. We propose a new fractional insulator through the exciton pairing
of the composite fermions. This insulating phase hosts neutral Fermi surfaces
and fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) effect. The neutral fermion is also
spinless, while there is gapless spin (locked to valley) excitation from the
internal flux of an U(1) gauge field. We dub the phase as a vortex spin liquid
(VSL) because it can be reached from proliferating fermionic vortex of a nearby
inter-valley-coherent (IVC) insulator. The phase in the bulk is essentially a
quantum spin liquid as in a Mott insulator. Because the charge gap suppresses
the double occupancy from the two valleys in the same region, the VSL phase may
likely be energetically better than the decoupled FQSH phase. As a spin liquid,
this special FQSH candidate exists only at odd integer filling, consistent with
the experiment. We also discuss the potential routes from the VSL phase to
competing symmetry breaking phases. \end{abstract}
