<h3>Following your nose: Autochemotaxis and other mechanisms for spinodal  decomposition in flocks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10391" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10391</a>

<i>Maxx Miller, John Toner</i>
<p>We develop the hydrodynamic theory of dry, polar ordered, active matter
(``flocking") with autochemotaxis; i.e., self-propelled entities moving in the
same direction, each emitting a substance which attracts the others (e.g.,
ants). We find that sufficiently strong autochemotaxis leads to an instability
to phase separation into one high and one low density band. This is very
analogous to both equilibrium phase separation, and ``motility induced phase
separation" (``MIPS") and can occur in flocks due to any microscopic mechanism
(e.g., sufficiently strong attractive interactions) that makes the entities
cohere.

<h3>A Fluctuation-Response Relation as a Probe of Long-Range Correlations in  Non-Equilibrium Quantum and Classical Fluids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10414" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10414</a>
<br>
<i>T.R. Kirkpatrick, D. Belitz</i>
<p>The absence of a simple fluctuation-dissipation theorem is a major obstacle
for studying systems that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium. We show that
for a fluid in a non-equilibrium steady state characterized by a constant
temperature gradient the commutator correlation functions are still related to
response functions; however, the relation is to the bilinear response of
products of two observables, rather than to a single linear response function
as is the case in equilibrium. This modified fluctuation-response relation
holds for both quantum and classical systems. It is both motivated and informed
by the long-range correlations that exist in such a steady state and allows for
probing them via response experiments. This is of particular interest in
quantum fluids, where the direct observation of fluctuations by light
scattering would be difficult. In classical fluids it is known that the
coupling of the temperature gradient to the diffusive shear velocity leads to
correlations of various observables, in particular temperature fluctuations,
that do not decay as a function of distance, but rather extend over the entire
system. We investigate the nature of these correlations in a fermionic quantum
fluid and show that the crucial coupling between the temperature gradient and
velocity fluctuations is the same as in the classical case. Accordingly, the
nature of the long-ranged correlations in the hydrodynamic regime also is the
same. However, as one enters the collisionless regime in the low-temperature
limit the nature of the velocity fluctuations changes: they become ballistic
rather than diffusive. As a result, correlations of the temperature and other
observables are still singular in the long-wavelength limit, but the
singularity is weaker than in the hydrodynamic regime.

<h3>Radiative Transfer and its Impact on Determination of Thermal  Diffusivity in Thin Films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10277" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10277</a>
<br>
<i>O. Yu Troitsky, H. Reiss</i>
<p>This paper extends the recently introduced Front Face Flash Method for
extraction of thermal diffusivity of thin films to samples of small optical
thickness. The paper discusses the principal question whether diffusivity is
uniquely defined in case a heated ceramic, thin film sample is non- or only
partly transparent to radiation. The paper applies radiative Monte Carlo and
Two-Flux simulations to numerically solve the Equation of Radiative Transfer.
Both methods are integrated in a Finite Element scheme, with conduction coupled
to radiation, to investigate heat transfer under strongly transient and
non-linear conditions. In this paper, the Front Face Flash method is
successfully applied to ZrO2- and SiC samples. It thus provides a promising
tool to also investigate the thermal transport properties of thin film
superconductors, but applicability still has to be demonstrated. The approach
is particularly suitable for analysis of coupled conduction/radiation
processes.

<h3>Super-Tonks-Girardeau quench of dipolar bosons in a one-dimensional  optical lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10317" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10317</a>
<br>
<i>Paolo Molignini, Barnali Chakrabarti</i>
<p>A super-Tonks-Giradeau gas is a highly excited yet stable quantum state of
strongly attractive bosons confined to one dimension. This state can be
obtained by quenching the interparticle interactions from the ground state of a
strongly repulsive Tonks-Girardeau gas to the strongly attractive regime. While
the super-Tonks-Girardeau quench with contact interactions has been thoroughly
studied, less is known about the stability of such a procedure when long-range
interactions come into play. This is a particularly important question in light
of recent advances in controlling ultracold atoms with dipole-dipole
interactions. In this study, we thus simulate a super-Tonks-Girardeau quench on
dipolar bosons in a one-dimensional optical lattice and investigate their
dynamics for many different initial states and fillings. By calculating
particle density, correlations, entropy measures, and natural occupations, we
establish the regimes of stability as a function of dipolar interaction
strength. For an initial unit-filled Mott state, stability is retained at weak
dipolar interactions. For cluster states and doubly-filled Mott states,
instead, dipolar interactions eventually lead to complete evaporation of the
initial state and thermalization consistent with predictions from random matrix
theory. Remarkably, though, dipolar interactions can be tuned to achieve
longer-lived prethermal states before the eventual thermalization. Our study
highlights the potential of long-range interactions to explore new mechanisms
to steer and stabilize excited quantum states of matter.

<h3>Detection of Quantized Vortices using Fourth Sound Attenuation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10339" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10339</a>
<br>
<i>Filip Novotný, Marek Talíř, Ritesh Dwivedi, Šimon Midlik, Emil Varga</i>
<p>Superfluid helium confined to nanofluidic systems is emerging as an important
system for studies of two-dimensional turbulence and as the basis for novel
quantum technologies. In fully enclosed nanofluidic geometries only the fourth
sound can propagate, which we show can be used for probing quantized vortices
pinned in well-defined slab geometry. We show that similarly to
well-established second sound attenuation, fourth sound attenuation can be used
to infer the number of quantized vortices in a unit area. We experimentally
verify fourth sound attenuation as a probe of vortex line density by injecting
a known number of quantized vortices into a nanofluidic slab using a rotating
cryostat.

<h3>Composition dependence of bulk properties in the Co-intercalated  transition-metal dichalcogenide Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10421" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10421</a>
<br>
<i>Pyeongjae Park, Woonghee Cho, Chaebin Kim, Yeochan An, Maxim Avdeev, Kazuki Iida, Ryoichi Kajimoto, Je-Geun Park</i>
<p>Spontaneous Hall conductivity has recently been reported in the triangular
lattice antiferromagnet Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$ under a zero magnetic field. This
phenomenon originates from the distinctive noncoplanar triple-Q magnetic ground
state, possessing uniform real-space Berry curvature characterized by scalar
spin chirality. We investigated the physical properties of Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$ by
judiciously controlling the composition, revealing a drastic change in its bulk
properties, even by slight variations in cobalt composition, despite the same
crystal structure. For $0.299 < x < 0.325$, Co$_x$TaS$_2$ keeps all the
characteristics of the ground state consistent with the previous studies -- two
antiferromagnetic phase transitions at $T_{N1}$ and $T_{N2} (< T_{N1})$, a
large spontaneous Hall conductivity (${\sigma}_{xy} (H=0)$), and a weak
ferromagnetic moment along the c-axis. However, samples with $x > 0.330$
exhibit distinct bulk properties, including the absence of both ${\sigma}_{xy}
(H=0)$ and the weak ferromagnetic moment. Our neutron diffraction data reveal
that Co$_x$TaS$_2$ with $x > 0.330$ develops coplanar helical magnetic order
with $q_{m1} = (1/3, 0, 0)$. This is entirely different from what has been seen
in $x < 0.325$, explaining the observed composition dependence.

<h3>Nanoscale Conducting and Insulating Domains on YbB$_6$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10424" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10424</a>
<br>
<i>Aaron Coe, Zhi-Huai Zhu, Yang He, Dae-Jeong Kim, Zachary Fisk, Jason Hoffman, Jennifer Hoffman</i>
<p>YbB$_6$ is a predicted topological insulator, with experimental evidence for
conducting surface states of yet-unproven origin. However, its lack of a
natural cleavage plane, and resultant surface-dependent polarity, has obscured
its study. We use scanning tunneling microscopy to image the cleaved surface of
YbB$_6$, exhibiting several coexisting terminations with distinct atomic
structures. Our spectroscopic measurements show band-bending between the
terminations, resulting in both conducting and fully-gapped regions. In the
conductive regions, we observe spectral peaks that are suggestive of van Hove
singularities arising from Rashba spin-split quantum well states. The
insulating regions rule out the possibility that YbB$_6$ is a strong
topological insulator, while the spin-polarized conducting regions suggest
possible utility for spintronic devices.

<h3>Treatment and Aging Studies of GaAs(111)B Substrates for van der Waals  Chalcogenide Film Growth</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10425" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10425</a>
<br>
<i>Mingyu Yu, Jiayang Wang, Sahani A. Iddawela, Molly McDonough, Jessica L. Thompson, Susan B Sinnott, Danielle Reifsnyder Hickey, Stephanie Law</i>
<p>GaAs(111)B is a semiconductor substrate widely used in research and
commercial fields due to its low cost, mature synthesis technology, and
excellent properties for manufacturing electronic devices. It is not only used
to grow three-dimensional (3D) strongly-bonded materials, but has also been
used as a substrate for layered, van der Waals (vdW)-bonded chalcogenide film
growth. However, GaAs(111)B wafers cannot be directly used for growing
epitaxial vdW chalcogenide films for two reasons: (1) the GaAs surface has a
substantial number of dangling bonds that need to be passivated for vdW layers
growth; (2) the substrate surface is covered with a thin epi-ready oxide layer
which must be removed before film growth. In this paper, we optimize the method
for deoxidizing GaAs(111)B substrates under a Se overpressure and successfully
create a smooth, deoxidized, and passivated substrate for subsequent growth of
vdW chalcogenide materials. We demonstrate the benefits of this method for the
growth of vdW chalcogenide thin films using GaSe as a representative of vdW
chalcogenides. In addition, we find that severely aged substrates have
difficulty maintaining a smooth surface during the deoxidation and passivation
process and cause GaSe crystals to nucleate in random shapes and orientations.
We describe a method using water droplet testing to determine the age of the
substrate. Finally, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization
reveals that the natural aging of GaAs(111)B in the air results in an increase
in surface oxides, Ga2O3 and As2O3, while exposure to ultraviolet (UV)-ozone
not only enhances the contents of these two oxides but also generates a new
oxide, As2O5. Our research contributes to expanding the compatibility of
GaAs(111)B with diverse growth materials and the production of high-quality
heterostructure devices.

<h3>Spontaneous localization at a potential saddle point from edge state  reconstruction in a quantum Hall point contact</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10433" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10433</a>
<br>
<i>Liam A. Cohen, Noah L. Samuelson, Taige Wang, Kai Klocke, Cian C. Reeves, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Sagar Vijay, Michael P. Zaletel, Andrea F. Young</i>
<p>Quantum point contacts (QPCs) are an essential component in mesoscopic
devices. Here, we study the transmission of quantum Hall edge modes through a
gate-defined QPC in monolayer graphene. We observe resonant tunneling peaks and
a nonlinear conductance pattern characteristic of Coulomb-blockaded localized
states. The in-plane electric polarizability reveals the states are localized
at a classically-unstable electrostatic saddle point. We explain this
unexpected finding within a self-consistent Thomas-Fermi model, finding that
localization of a zero-dimensional state at the saddle point is favored
whenever the applied confinement potential is sufficiently soft compared to the
Coulomb energy. Our results provide a direct demonstration of Coulomb-driven
reconstruction at the boundary of a quantum Hall system.

<h3>Fractal Quantum Transport in MoS2 Superlattices</h3>

<br>
<i>Aitor Garcia-Ruiz, Ming-Hao Liu</i>
<p>We study the band structure and quantum transport of MoS2 on a
nanometer-scale periodic potential under magnetic fields. Using the continuum
model, we compute the band structure of the system with and without magnetic
fields. We found the formation of a self-similar fractal band gaps for values
of the magnetic field of about 1 T. Additionally, we simulate the quantum
transport along a realistic two-terminal device affected by the same potential
and find a remarkably good consistency between these two approaches. Our
results can be extended to provide a theoretical understanding on the transport
phenomenon on transition metal-dichalcogenides.

<h3>Diffusion of intrinsically disordered proteins within viscoelastic  membraneless droplets</h3>

<br>
<i>Fuga Watanabe, Takuma Akimoto, Robert B. Best, Kresten Lindorff-Larsen, Ralf Metzler, Eiji Yamamoto</i>
<p>In living cells, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), such as FUS and
DDX4, undergo phase separation, forming biomolecular condensates. Using
molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate their behavior in their
respective homogenous droplets. We find that the proteins exhibit transient
subdiffusion due to the viscoelastic nature and confinement effects in the
droplets. The conformation and the instantaneous diffusivity of the proteins
significantly vary between the interior and the interface of the droplet,
resulting in non-Gaussianity in the displacement distributions. This study
highlights key aspects of IDP behavior in biomolecular condensates.

<h3>Raman scattering signatures of spinons and triplons in frustrated  antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10452" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10452</a>
<br>
<i>O. R. Bellwood, H. L. Nourse, B. J. Powell</i>
<p>Magnetically frustrated spin systems compose a significant proportion of
topological quantum spin liquid candidates. Evidence for spin liquids in these
materials comes largely from the detection of fractionalised spin-1/2
quasiparticles, known as spinons. However, the one-dimensional Heisenberg
chain, which is topologically trivial, also hosts spinons. Thus, observing
spinons does not necessarily signify long-range entanglement. Here, we show
that spinons arising from one-dimensional physics leave a clear fingerprint in
magnetic Raman scattering. We achieve this by calculating the magnetic Raman
intensity of coupled Heisenberg chains. Our findings are in excellent agreement
with the magnetic Raman scattering measurements on the anisotropic triangular
antiferromagnet Ca$_3$ReO$_5$Cl$_2$.

<h3>Two-dimensional quantum droplets in binary quadrupolar condensates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10481" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10481</a>
<br>
<i>Aowei Yang, Jiahao Zhou, Xiaoqing Liang, Guilong Li, Bin Liu, Huan-Bo Luo, Boris A Malomed, Yongyao Li</i>
<p>We study the stability and characteristics of two-dimensional (2D)
quasi-isotropic quantum droplets (QDs) of fundamental and vortex types, formed
by binary Bose-Einstein condensate with magnetic quadrupole-quadrupole
interactions (MQQIs). The magnetic quadrupoles are built as pairs of dipoles
and antidipoles polarized along the x-axis. The MQQIs are induced by applying
an external magnetic field that varies along the x-axis. The system is modeled
by the Gross-Pitaevskii equations including the MQQIs and Lee-Huang-Yang
correction to the mean-field approximation. Stable 2D fundamental QDs and
quasi-isotropic vortex QDs with topological charges S<4 are produced by means
of the imaginary-time-integration method for configurations with the
quadrupoles polarized parallel to the systems two-dimensional plane. Effects of
the norm and MQQI strength on the QDs are studied in detail. Some results,
including an accurate prediction of the effective area, chemical potential, and
peak density of QDs, are obtained in an analytical form by means of the
Thomas-Fermi approximation. Collisions between moving QDs are studied by means
of systematic simulations.

<h3>Scaling Relations of Spectrum Form Factor and Krylov Complexity at  Finite Temperature</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10499" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10499</a>
<br>
<i>Chengming Tan, Zhiyang Wei, Ren Zhang</i>
<p>In the study of quantum chaos diagnostics, considerable attention has been
attributed to the Krylov complexity and spectrum form factor (SFF) for systems
at infinite temperature. These investigations have unveiled universal
properties of quantum chaotic systems. By extending the analysis to include the
finite temperature effects on the Krylov complexity and SFF, we demonstrate
that the Lanczos coefficients $b_n$, which are associated with the Wightman
inner product, display consistency with the universal hypothesis presented in
PRX 9, 041017 (2019). This result contrasts with the behavior of Lanczos
coefficients associated with the standard inner product. Our results indicate
that the slope $\alpha$ of the $b_n$ is bounded by $\pi k_BT$, where $k_B$ is
the Boltzmann constant and $T$ the temperature. We also investigate the SFF,
which characterizes the two-point correlation of the spectrum and encapsulates
an indicator of ergodicity denoted by $g$ in chaotic systems. Our analysis
demonstrates that as the temperature decreases, the value of $g$ decreases as
well. Considering that $\alpha$ also represents the operator growth rate, we
establish a quantitative relationship between ergodicity indicator and Lanczos
coefficients slope. To support our findings, we provide evidence using the
Gaussian orthogonal ensemble and a random spin model. Our work deepens the
understanding of the finite temperature effects on Krylov complexity, SFF, and
the connection between ergodicity and operator growth.

<h3>Exploration of magnon-magnon coupling in an antidot lattice: The role of  non-uniform magnetization texture</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10540" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10540</a>
<br>
<i>Mathieu Moalic, Mateusz Zelent, Krzysztof Szulc, Maciej Krawczyk</i>
<p>We numerically study the spin-wave dynamics in antidot lattices (ADL-MR)
based on a Co/Pd multilayer structure with reduced perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy at the edges of the antidots, creating in-plane magnetized rims. Our
results delineate the distinct behavior of spin waves in the bulk and in the
rims of the ADL-MR under varying external magnetic field strength, revealing
complex spin-wave spectra with mode hybridization between these subsystems. In
particular, we show that the coupling between the spin waves at low frequencies
is masked by the changes in the static magnetization at the bulk-rim interface.
Nevertheless, a strong magnon-magnon exchange coupling between bulk spin waves
and second-order radial rim modes is found. The research expands the horizons
of magnonic crystals by combining periodic patterning and magnetization texture
to achieve magnon-magnon coupling. In addition, the results highlight the
significant role of exchange interactions in bulk-rim mode coupling, paving the
way for innovative explorations of the dynamic capabilities of ADL-MRs.

<h3>Chirality-2 fermion induced anti-Klein tunneling in 2D checkerboard  lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10554" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10554</a>
<br>
<i>Jiannan Hua, Z. F. Wang, W. Zhu, Weiwei Chen</i>
<p>The quantum tunneling effect in the two-dimensional (2D) checkerboard lattice
is investigated. By analyzing the pseudospin texture of the states in a 2D
checkerboard lattice based on the low-energy effective Hamiltonian, we find
that this system has a chiral symmetry with chirality equal to 2. Although
compared to regular chiral fermions, its pseudospin orientation does not vary
uniformly. This suggests that the perfect reflection chiral tunneling, also
known as the anti-Klein tunneling, is expected to appear in checkerboard
lattice as well. In order to verify the conjecture, we calculate the
transmission probability and find that normally incident electron states can be
perfectly reflected by the barrier with hole states inside, and vice versa.
Furthermore, we also numerically calculate the tunneling conductance of the
checkerboard nanotube using the recursive Green's function method. The results
show that a perfect on-off ratio can be achieved by confining the energy of the
incident states within a certain range. It also suggests that, by tuning the
barrier, the checkerboard nanotube is able to work as a perfect ``band filter"
or ``tunneling field effect transistor", which transmits electrons selectively
with respect to the pseudospin of the incident electrons.

<i>Claudio Bonati, Andrea Pelissetto, Ettore Vicari</i>
<p>We critically discuss the results reported in arXiv:2311.17994v1 by L.
Oppenheim, M. Koch-Janusz, S. Gazit, and Z. Ringel, on the multicritical
behavior of the three-dimensional Ising-Gauge model at the multicritical point.
We argue that their results do not contradict the theoretical scenario put
forward in ``Multicritical point of the three-dimensional ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge
Higgs model'', Phys. Rev. B 105, 165138 (2022), arXiv:2112.01824, that
predicted a multicritical behavior controlled by the stable $XY$ fixed point of
an effective three-dimensional ${\mathbb Z}_2\oplus {\mathbb Z}_2$
Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\Phi^4$ field theory. Actually, their results, as well
as all numerical results reported so far in the literature, are consistent with
a multicritical $XY$ scenario.

<h3>Resolving the relaxation complexity of vitrimers: time-temperature  superpositions of a time-temperature non-equivalent system</h3>

<br>
<i>Paolo Edera, Selene Chappuis, Michel Cloitre, Francois Tournilhac</i>
<p>Vitrimers are polymer networks that, thanks to covalent bond exchange,
combine desirable properties of thermoplastic and thermosets, such as
flowability and insolubility. For this reason, vitrimers are considered to be
good candidates for a number of innovative applications from self-healing soft
robots to hard reprocessable materials. All these applications are related to
the unusual thermomechanical behavior of vitrimers, consequence of the
non-trivial interplay between the polymer network dynamics and the thermally
activated chemical link exchange. Here we use solid-state rheology to
investigate the properties of a recently developed epoxy-based vitrimer. The
rheological analysis demonstrates that the mechanical spectrum is composed of
two relaxation processes with distinct activation energies which are associated
with glass dynamics and covalent bond exchange, respectively. This makes the
material thermo-rheologically complex and time temperature equivalence does not
apply. Nonetheless, thanks to mechanical spectral analysis in a wide range of
stiffness, time and temperature, we are able to depict the
time-temperature-relaxation landscape in an enough precise way to account for
the two dynamical processes and recombine them to predict the mechanical moduli
in a wide (virtually unlimited) interval of frequencies, from low temperatures
(close to room temperature) to high temperatures (above the Tg).

<h3>Photodriven germanium hole qubit</h3>

<br>
<i>Bashab Dey, John Schliemann</i>
<p>Hole qubits in germanium quantum dots are promising candidates for coherent
control and manipulation of the spin degree of freedom through electric dipole
spin resonance. We theoretically study the time dynamics of a single heavy-hole
qubit in a laser-driven planar germanium quantum dot confined laterally by a
harmonic potential in presence of linear and cubic Rashba spin-orbit couplings
and an out-of-plane magnetic field. We obtain an approximate analytical formula
of the Rabi frequency using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation and establish a
connection of our model with the ESDR results obtained for this system. For
stronger beams, we employ different methods such as unitary transformation and
Floquet theory to study the time evolution numerically. We observe that high
radiation intensity is not suitable for the qubit rotation due to the presence
of high frequency noise superimposed on the Rabi oscillations. We display the
Floquet spectrum and highlight the quasienergy levels responsible for the Rabi
oscillations in the Floquet picture. We study the interplay of both the types
of Rashba couplings and show that the Rabi oscillations, which are brought
about by the linear Rashba coupling, vanish for typical values of the cubic
Rashba coupling in this system.

<h3>Towards predicting shear-banding instabilities in lipid monolayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10593" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10593</a>
<br>
<i>A.R. Carotenuto, A. Gaffney, K.Y.C. Lee, L. Pocivavsek, M. Fraldi, L. Deseri</i>
<p>Langmuir monolayers are advantageous systems used to investigate how lipid
membranes get involved in the physiology of many living structures, such as
collapse phenomena in alveolar structures. Much work focuses on characterizing
the pressure-bearing capacity of Langmuir films, expressed in the form of
isotherm curves. These show that monolayers experience different phases during
compression with an according evolution of their mechanical response, incurring
into instability events when a critical stress threshold is overcome. Although
well-known state equations, which establish an inverse relationship between
surface pressure and area change, are able to describe monolayer behavior
during liquid expanded phase, the modelling of their nonlinear behavior in the
subsequent condensed region is still an open issue. In this regard, efforts are
addressed to explain out-of-plane collapse by modeling buckling and wrinkling
mainly resorting to linearly elastic plate theory. However, some experiments on
Langmuir monolayers also show in-plane instability phenomena leading to the
formation of the so-called shear bands and, to date, no theoretical description
of the onset of shear banding bifurcation in monolayers has been yet provided.
For this reason, by adopting a macroscopic description, we here study material
stability of the monolayers and exploit an incremental approach to find the
conditions that kindle shear bands. By starting from the widely assumed
hypothesis that monolayers behave elastically in the solid-like region, a
hyperfoam hyperelastic potential is introduced as a new constitutive strategy
to trace back the nonlinear response of monolayer response during
densification. In this way, the obtained mechanical properties together with
the adopted strain energy are successfully employed to reproduce the onset of
shear banding exhibited by some lipid systems under different conditions.

<h3>Superconductivity and Mottness in Organic Charge Transfer Materials</h3>

<i>Henri Menke, Marcel Klett, Kazushi Kanoda, Antoine Georges, Michel Ferrero, Thomas Schäfer</i>
<p>The phase diagrams of quasi two-dimensional organic superconductors display a
plethora of fundamental phenomena associated with strong electron correlations,
such as unconventional superconductivity, metal-insulator transitions,
frustrated magnetism and spin liquid behavior. We analyze a minimal model for
these compounds, the Hubbard model on an anisotropic triangular lattice, using
cutting-edge quantum embedding methods respecting the lattice symmetry. We
demonstrate the existence of unconventional superconductivity by directly
entering the symmetry-broken phase. We show that the crossover from the Fermi
liquid metal to the Mott insulator is associated with the formation of a
pseudogap. The predicted momentum-selective destruction of the Fermi surface
into hot and cold regions provides motivation for further spectroscopic
studies. Our results are in remarkable agreement with experimental phase
diagrams of $\kappa$-BEDT organics.

<h3>Liquid-liquid phase separation driven by charge heterogeneity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10655" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10655</a>
<br>
<i>Daniele Notarmuzi, Emanuela Bianchi</i>
<p>Globular proteins as well as recently synthesized colloids engineered with
differently charged surface regions have in common a reduced bonding valence
and a complex interaction pattern dominated by like-charge attraction and
opposite-charge repulsion. While the impact of low functionality on the
condensation of the liquid phase has been extensively studied, the combined
effect of limited bonding valence and particle charge heterogeneity on the
liquid-liquid phase separation has not been investigated yet. We numerically
tackle this challenge in a systematic fashion by taking advantage of an
efficient coarse-grained model grounded into a robust mean-field description.
We consider a relatively simple surface pattern consisting of two charged polar
caps and an oppositely charged equatorial belt and investigate how the
interplay between geometry and electrostatics affect the critical point
parameters. We find that electrostatics has a dramatic effect on the
condensation of the liquid phase -- especially in the regime of large polar
caps.

<h3>Formation of Highly Tunable Periodic Plasmonic Structures on Gold Films  Using Direct Laser Writing</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10661" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10661</a>
<br>
<i>Kernius Vilkevičius, George D. Tsibidis, Algirdas Selskis, Emmanuel Stratakis, Evaldas Stankevičius</i>
<p>Direct laser writing method is a promising technique for the large-scale and
cost-effective fabrication of periodic nanostructure arrays exciting hybrid
lattice plasmons. This type of electromagnetic mode manifests a narrow and deep
resonance peak with a high dispersion whose precise controllability is crucial
for practical applications in photonic devices. Here, the formation of
differently shaped gold nanostructures using the direct laser writing method on
Au layers of different thicknesses is presented. The resonance peak is
demonstrated to be highly dependent on the shape of the structures in the
array, thus its position in the spectra, as well as the quality, can be
additionally modulated by changing the morphology. The shape of the structure
and the resonance itself pertain not only on the laser pulse energy but also on
the grating period. This overlapping effect occurring at distances smaller than
the diameter of the focused laser beam is studied in detail. By taking
advantage of the highly controllable plasmonic resonance, the fabricated
gratings open up new opportunities for applications in sensing.

<h3>Diversity of Ultrafast Spin Dynamics Near the Tricritical Point in a  Ferrimagnetic Gd/FeCo Multilayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10671" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10671</a>
<br>
<i>T.G.H. Blank, B.D. Muis, T. Lichtenberg, B. Koopmans, A.V. Kimel</i>
<p>It is found that subtle changes in the external magnetic field and
temperature result in dramatic changes in the ultrafast response of spins to a
femtosecond laser excitation in a ferrimagnetic Gd/FeCo multilayer. A total of
six distinct types of spin dynamics were observed and explained by considering
the spin-flop transition to the noncollinear phase and the concept of a
tricritical point in the $H$-$T$ phase diagram. A particularly interesting type
of dynamics is the exchange-driven reversal. These exchange-driven dynamics
provide new insights into the tricritical point, which is shown to separate two
thermodynamically distinct noncollinear phases with the transition-metal
magnetization pointing on adjacent sides of the anisotropy plane.

<h3>Multipole and fracton topological order via gauging foliated SPT phases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10677" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10677</a>
<br>
<i>Hiromi Ebisu, Masazumi Honda, Taiichi Nakanishi</i>
<p>Spurred by recent development of fracton topological phases, unusual
topological phases possessing fractionalized quasi-particles with mobility
constraints, the concept of symmetries has been renewed. In particular, in
accordance with the progress of multipole symmetries, associated with
conservation of multipoles, such as dipole or quadruple moments as well as
global charges, there have been proposed topological phases with such
symmetries. These topological phases are unconventional as excitations are
subject to mobility constraints corresponding to the multipole symmetries. We
demonstrate a way to construct such phases by preparing layers of symmetry
protected topological (SPT) phases and implementing gauging a global symmetry.
After gauging, the statistics of a fractional excitation is altered when
crossing the SPT phases, resulting in topological phases with the multipole
symmetries. The way we construct the phases allows us to have a comprehensive
understanding of field theories of topological phases with the multipole
symmetries and other fracton models.

<h3>An Experimental Estimation Method of Diffusion Coefficients in Ternary  and Multicomponent Systems from a Single Diffusion Couple Profile</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10684" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10684</a>
<br>
<i>Suman Sadhu, Anindita Chakraborty, Surendra Makineni, Saswata Bhattacharyya, Aloke Paul</i>
<p>Until recently, it was textbook knowledge that the diffusion coefficients
could not be estimated in a multi-component system following the widely
practised diffusion couple method. The recently proposed constrained diffusion
couple methods need two intersecting diffusion paths in a multi-component space
with very well-controlled compositions of the diffusion couple end members,
which may be tricky depending on the complications of diffusion paths in
certain systems. In this study, we have proposed a method for estimating all
types of diffusion coefficients directly at the Kirkendall marker plane from a
single diffusion couple. The estimation method and design strategy for
producing diffusion couples are discussed in concentrated ternary Ni-Co-Fe,
Fe-rich quaternary Fe-Ni-Co-Cr and Ni-rich Ni-Co-Fe-Cr-Al quinary alloys. As
demonstrated further, one can even estimate the impurity diffusion coefficients
utilizing the composition profiles at the ends of the diffusion couples, which
has been rarely practised in multicomponent systems until now. We have further
demonstrated the importance of estimating the tracer and intrinsic diffusion
coefficients in a concentrated or multi-principal element alloy in which
interdiffusion coefficients can be vague and misleading for understanding the
elements' diffusional interactions and relative mobilities. We have also shown
the importance of considering the vacancy wind effect in concentrated alloys.
The method and design strategy of producing diffusion couples demonstrated in
this study can be suitable for generating a mobility database in Ni-, Co-based
(superalloys) and Fe-based (steel) multicomponent systems with relative ease,
which was considered impossible until recently.

<h3>Experimental determination of the spin Hamiltonian of the cubic chiral  magnet MnSi</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10687" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10687</a>
<br>
<i>P. Dalmas de Reotier, A. Yaouanc, G. Lapertot, C. Wang, A. Amato, D. Andreica</i>
<p>A thorough description of the physics of a magnetic compound requires the
validation of its microscopic spin Hamiltonian. Here, from the analysis of
muon-spin rotation spectra recorded in the magnetically ordered state at low
temperature in zero and finite magnetic fields, we determine the minimal
Hamiltonian for the chiral binary intermetallic magnet MnSi, consistent with
its high-temperature nonsymmorphic cubic space group P$2_1$3. The model
provides constraints for the orientation of the Moriya vector characterizing
the microscopic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, with respect to the Mn
nearest-neighbor bonds. Small twist and canting of the magnetic structure are
revealed. Our result indicates that, within experimental uncertainties, the
magnetoelastic coupling is not strong enough to lower the paramagnetic crystal
symmetry in the magnetically ordered state. Additional implications from our
work are discussed and complementary studies are suggested.

<h3>Non-Fermi-Liquid/Marginal-Fermi-Liquid Signatures Induced by Van Hove  Singularity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10707" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10707</a>
<br>
<i>Yi-Hui Xing, Wu-Ming Liu</i>
<p>We theoretically study the two-dimensional metal that is coupled to critical
magnons and features van Hove singularities on the Fermi surface. When there is
only translationally invariant SYK-liked Yukawa interaction, van Hove points
suppress the contribution from the part of the Fermi surface away from them,
dominating and exhibiting non-Fermi-liquid behavior. When introducing
disordered Yukawa coupling, it leads to a crossover from non-Fermi-liquid to
marginal-Fermi-liquid, and the marginal-Fermi-liquid region exhibits the $T\ln
(1/T)$ specific heat and temperature-linear resistivity of strange metal. By
solving the gap equation, we provide the critical temperature for
superconductor induced by van Hove singularities and point out the possible
emergence of pair-density-wave superconductor. Our theory may become a new
mechanism for understanding non-Fermi-liquid or marginal-Fermi-liquid
phenomenons.

<h3>Excess heat capacity in magnetically ordered Ce heavy fermion metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10718" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10718</a>
<br>
<i>A. Scheie, Yu Liu, E. A. Ghioldi, S. Fender, P. F. S. Rosa, E. D. Bauer, Jian-Xin Zhu, F. Ronning</i>
<p>We study the magnetic heat capacity of a series of magnetically ordered
Ce-based heavy fermion materials, which show an anomalous $T^3$ heat capacity
in excess of the phonon contribution in many materials. For compounds for which
magnon models have been worked out, we show that the local-moment magnon heat
capacity derived from the measured magnon spectra underestimates the
experimental specific heat. The excess heat capacity reveals increasing density
of states with increasing energy, akin to a pseudogap. We show that this
anomalous temperature-dependent term is not associated with proximity to a
quantum critical point (QCP), but is strongly correlated with $T_N$, indicating
the anomalous excitations are governed by the magnetic exchange interaction.
This insight may hold key information for understanding magnetically ordered
heavy fermions.

<h3>Coupling Dynamics and Linear Polarization Phenomena in Codirectional  Polariton Waveguide Couplers</h3>

<br>
<i>Elena Rozas, Alexey Yulin, Sebastian Klembt, Sven Höfling, María Dolores Martín, Luis Viña</i>
<p>In this work, we explore the potential of spin-based integrated devices using
polariton waveguides that form codirectional couplers. For suitable coupler
parameters, a transfer of condensates between the arms of the coupler, occurs
leading to the observation of Josephson-like oscillations. The ability to tune
the periodicity of these oscillations opens the way to the design of
polaritonic circuits in which the directionality of the signal towards the
output terminals can be controlled. We also investigate the response of the
devices to linearly polarized excitation, delving into the dynamics of linear
polarization at the output terminals of long couplers, providing valuable
insights into the potential applications of spin-based polariton devices,
including polariton switches and logic gates with efficient operation. Our
results are supported by numerical simulations based on generalized
Gross-Pitaevskii equation describing the dynamics of coherent polaritons in
spatially non-uniform system. We show, how the coupling and the controllable
spin degree of freedom in polariton couplers opens avenues for innovative
optical architectures and functionalities.

<h3>Resurgence of superconductivity and the role of $d_{xy}$ hole band in  FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10769" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10769</a>
<br>
<i>Archie B. Morfoot, Timur K. Kim, Matthew D. Watson, Amir A. Haghighirad, Shiv J. Singh, Nick Bultinck, Amalia I. Coldea</i>
<p>Iron-chalcogenide superconductors display rich phenomena caused by
orbital-dependent band shifts and electronic correlations. Additionally, they
are potential candidates for topological superconductivity due to the band
inversion between the Fe $d$ bands and the chalcogen $p_z$ band. Here we
present a detailed study of the electronic structure of the nematic
superconductors FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ ($0<x<0.4$) using angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy to understand the role of orbital-dependent band
shifts, electronic correlations and the chalcogen band. We assess the changes
in the effective masses using a three-band low energy model, and the band
renormalization via comparison with DFT band structure calculations. The
effective masses decrease for all three-hole bands inside the nematic phase
followed by a strong increase for the band with $d_{xy}$ orbital character.
Interestingly, this nearly-flat $d_{xy}$ band becomes more correlated as it
shifts towards the Fermi level with increasing Te concentrations and as the
second superconducting dome emerges. Our findings suggests that the $d_{xy}$
hole band, which is very sensitive to the chalcogen height, could be involved
in promoting an additional pairing channel and increasing the density of states
to stabilize the second superconducting dome in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$. This
simultaneous shift of the $d_{xy}$ hole band and enhanced superconductivity is
in contrast with FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$.

<h3>Bidisperse micro fluidized beds: Effect of bed inclination on mixing</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10780" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10780</a>
<br>
<i>Henrique Barbosa de Oliveira, Erick de Moraes Franklin</i>
<p>Micro fluidized beds are basically suspensions of solid particles by an
ascending fluid in a mm-scale tube, with applications in chemical and
pharmaceutical processes involving powders. Although in many applications beds
are polydisperse, previous works considered only monodisperse beds aligned in
the vertical direction. However, introducing an inclination with respect to
gravity leads to different bed patterns and mixing levels, which can be
beneficial for some applications. In this paper, we investigate experimentally
the behavior of micro gas-solid beds consisting of bidisperse mixtures under
different inclinations. In our experiments, mono and bidisperse beds are filmed
with a high-speed camera and the images are processed for obtaining
measurements at both the bed and grain scales. We show that the degree of
segregation is larger for vertical beds, but mixing varies non-monotonically
with inclination, with an optimal angle of 30$^{\circ}$--50$^{\circ}$ with
respect to gravity. By computing the mean and fluctuation velocities of grains,
we reveal that the mixing layer results from the competition between
segregation by kinetic sieving and circulation promoted by the fluid flow. We
also observe worse fluidization as the angle relative to gravity increases,
accounting then for the non-monotonic behavior. Our results bring new insights
into mixing and segregation in polydisperse beds, which can be explored for
processing powders in industry.

<h3>Influence of particle size polydispersity on dynamical heterogeneities  in dense particle packings</h3>

<br>
<i>Rajkumar Biswas, Anoop Mutneja, Smarajit Karmakar, Ranjini Bandyopadhyay</i>
<p>The dynamics of dense particle packings near the jamming transition is
characterized by correlated particle motion. The growth of dynamical
heterogeneities, or strong spatial variations in the motion of the particles
constituting the system, is a hallmark feature of slow glassy dynamics. We
report here a systematic confocal microscopy study that characterizes the
cooperative dynamics of fluorescently-labelled colloidal particles in dense
aqueous suspensions. We demonstrate that jammed particulate suspensions can be
fluidized by increasing the width of the particle size distribution. Our
molecular dynamics simulations, performed to numerically investigate the
effects of continuous-size polydispersity on dense particle packing dynamics,
show an excellent match with our experimental results. Besides shedding light
on the fundamental aspects of particle-scale dynamics at the jamming-unjamming
transition, our findings are significant in the processing of
commonly-encountered dense suspensions such as paints, cosmetics, and food.

<h3>Bendability parameter for twisted ribbons to describe longitudinal  wrinkling and delineate the near-threshold regime</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10797" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10797</a>
<br>
<i>Madelyn Leembruggen, Jovana Andrejevic, Arshad Kudrolli, Chris H. Rycroft</i>
<p>We propose a dimensionless bendability parameter, $\epsilon^{-1} =
[\left(h/W\right)^2 T^{-1}]^{-1}$ for wrinkling of thin, twisted ribbons with
thickness $h$, width $W$, and tensional strain $T$. Bendability permits
efficient collapse of data for wrinkle onset, wavelength, critical stress, and
residual stress, demonstrating longitudinal wrinkling's primary dependence on
this parameter. This new parameter also allows us to distinguish the highly
bendable range ($\epsilon^{-1} > 20$) from moderately bendable samples
($\epsilon^{-1} \in (0,20]$). We identify scaling relations to describe
longitudinal wrinkles that are valid across our entire set of simulated
ribbons. When restricted to the highly bendable regime, simulations confirm
theoretical near-threshold (NT) predictions for wrinkle onset and wavelength.

<h3>Rough neutron fields and nuclear reactor noise</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10810" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10810</a>
<br>
<i>Eric Dumonteil</i>
<p>Nuclear reactor cores achieve sustained fission chain reactions through the
so-called 'critical state' -a subtle equilibrium between their material
properties and their geometries. Observed at macroscopic scales during
operations, the resulting stationary neutron field is tainted by a noise term,
that hinders various fluctuations occurring at smaller scales. These
fluctuations are either of a stochastic nature (whenever the core is operated
at low power) or related to various perturbations and vibrations within the
core, even operated in its power regime. For reasons that are only partially
understood using linear noise theory, incidental events have been reported,
characterized by an increase of the power noise. Such events of power noise
growth, sometimes up to seemingly unbounded levels, have already led in the
past to volontary scramming of reactors. In this paper, we will extend the
findings of \cite{percolation_pre} (where a statistical field theory of
critical processes was employed to model stochastic neutron noise) by
incorporating the effects of power noise. We will show that the evolution of
the neutron field in a reactor is intimately connected to the dynamic of
surface growths given by the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation. Recent numerical
results emerging from renormalization group approaches will be used to
calculate a threshold in the amplitude of the reactor noise above which the
core could enter a new criticality state, and to estimate the critical
exponents characterizing this phase transition to rough neutron fields. The
phenomenology of this roughening transition will be correlated and compared to
data of misunderstood reactor noise levels and reactor instabilities, and will
be shown to provide both qualitative and quantitative insights into this
long-standing issue of reactor physics.

<h3>Inverse Primitive Path Analysis</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10813" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10813</a>
<br>
<i>Carsten Svaneborg</i>
<p>The primitive-path analysis (PPA) {[}R. Everaers et al. Science 303, 823,
(2004){]} is an algorithm that transforms a model polymer melt into its
topologically equivalent mesh by removing excess contour length stored in
thermal fluctuations. Here we present an inverse PPA algorithm that gradually
reintroduces contour length in a PPA mesh to produce an topologically
equilvalent polymer melt. This enables the generation of model polymer
materials with well controlled topology. As an illustration, we generate
knitted model polymer materials with a 2D cubic lattice of entanglement points
using a synthetic PPA mesh as a starting point. We also show how to combine PPA
and inverse PPA to accelerate stress relaxation approximately by an order of
magnitude in simulation time. This reduces the computational cost of
computational studies of structure-property relations for polymer materials.

<h3>Helical Luttinger liquid on a space-time lattice</h3>

<br>
<i>V. A. Zakharov, J. Tworzydlo, C. W. J. Beenakker, M. J. Pacholski</i>
<p>The Luttinger model is a paradigm for the breakdown due to interactions of
the Fermi liquid description of one-dimensional massless Dirac fermions.
Attempts to discretize the model on a one-dimensional lattice have failed to
reproduce the established bosonization results, because of the fermion-doubling
obstruction: A local discretization of the Hamiltonian introduces a spurious
second species of low-energy excitations, while a nonlocal discretization opens
a single-particle gap at the Dirac point. Here we show how to work around this
obstruction, by discretizing both space and time to obtain a local action for a
helical Luttinger liquid with Hubbard interaction. The approach enables quantum
Monte Carlo simulations of interacting relativistic fermions.

<h3>Accuracy of metaGGA functionals in describing transition metal fluorides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10832" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10832</a>
<br>
<i>Dereje Bekele Tekliye, Gopalakrishnan Sai Gautam</i>
<p>Accurate predictions of material properties within the chemical space of
transition metal fluorides (TMFs), using density functional theory (DFT) is
important for advancing several technological applications. The
state-of-the-art semi-local exchange-correlation functionals within DFT include
the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) and the restored
regularized SCAN (r$^2$SCAN), both of which are meta generalized gradient
approximation (metaGGA) functionals. Both SCAN and r$^2$SCAN are susceptible to
self-interaction errors (SIEs) while modelling correlated $d$ electrons of
transition metals. Hence, in this work, we evaluate the accuracy of both
functionals in estimating properties of TMFs, including redox enthalpies,
lattice geometries, on-site magnetic moments, and band gaps. We observe both
SCAN and r$^2$SCAN to exhibit poor accuracy in estimating fluorination
enthalpies among TMFs, attributable to SIEs among the $d$ electrons. Thus, we
derive optimal Hubbard $U$ corrections for both functionals based on
experimental fluorination enthalpies of binary TMFs. Note that the linear
response theory yielded unphysical $U$ values for V, Fe, and Ni fluorides.
While adding the optimal $U$ to the metaGGA functionals does not significantly
affect the lattice volumes and magnetic moments, it does significantly increase
the calculated band gaps. Also, we calculate the average Na intercalation
voltage in Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni fluorides as a transferability check of our
optimal $U$ values. Overall, we recommend using the Hubbard $U$ correction to
improve predictions of redox enthalpies in other TMFs, while for band gap
predictions, we suggest using the non-corrected functionals. Finally, our study
should advance the accuracy of DFT-based screening studies to unearth novel
TMFs, which can be used in various applications, including energy storage,
catalysis, and magnetic devices.

<h3>Post-synthesis tuning of dielectric constant via ferroelectric domain  wall engineering</h3>

<br>
<i>L. Zhou, L. Puntigam, P. Lunkenheimer, E. Bourret, Z. Yan, I. Kézsmárki, D. Meier, S. Krohns, J. Schultheiß, D. M. Evans</i>
<p>A promising mechanism for achieving colossal dielectric constants is to use
insulating internal barrier layers, which typically form during synthesis and
then remain in the material. It has recently been shown that insulating domain
walls in ferroelectrics can act as such barriers. One advantage domain walls
have, in comparison to stationary interfaces, is that they can be moved,
offering the potential of post-synthesis control of the dielectric constant.
However, to date, direct imaging of how changes in domain wall pattern cause a
change in dielectric constant within a single sample has not been realized. In
this work, we demonstrate that changing the domain wall density allows the
engineering of the dielectric constant in hexagonal-ErMnO3 single crystals. The
changes of the domain wall density are quantified via microscopy techniques,
while the dielectric constant is determined via macroscopic dielectric
spectroscopy measurements. The observed changes in the dielectric constant are
quantitatively consistent with the observed variation in domain wall density,
implying that the insulating domain walls behave as 'ideal' capacitors
connected in series. Our approach to engineer the domain wall density can be
readily extended to other control methods, e.g., electric fields or mechanical
stresses, providing a novel degree of flexibility to in-situ tune the
dielectric constant.

<h3>Nature of the unconventional heavy fermion Kondo state in monolayer  CeSiI</h3>

<br>
<i>Adolfo O. Fumega, Jose L. Lado</i>
<p>CeSiI has been recently isolated in the ultrathin limit, establishing CeSiI
as the first intrinsic two-dimensional van der Waals heavy-fermion material up
to 85 K. We show that, due to the strong Ce spin-orbit coupling, the local
moments develop a multipolar real-space magnetic texture, leading to local
pseudospins with a nearly vanishing net moment. To elucidate its Kondo-screened
regime, we extract from first principles the parameters of the Kondo lattice
model describing this material. We develop a fractional pseudofermion
methodology in combination with ab initio calculations to reveal the nature of
the Kondo-screened heavy fermion state in CeSiI. Using this formalism, we
analyze the competing magnetic interactions leading to a heavy-fermion order as
a function of the magnetic exchange between the localized f-electrons and the
strength of the Kondo coupling. Our results show that the magnetic exchange
interactions promote an unconventional momentum-dependent heavy-fermion Kondo
screened phase, establishing the nature of the heavy-fermion behavior of
ultrathin CeSiI observed experimentally.

<h3>Spectral signatures of non-trivial topology in a superconducting circuit</h3>

<br>
<i>L. Peyruchat, R. H. Rodriguez, J.-L. Smirr, R. Leone, Ç. Ö. Girit</i>
<p>Topology, like symmetry, is a fundamental concept in understanding general
properties of physical systems. In condensed matter systems, non-trivial
topology may manifest itself as singular features in the energy spectrum or the
quantization of observable quantities such as electrical conductance and
magnetic flux. Using microwave spectroscopy, we show that a superconducting
circuit with three Josephson tunnel junctions in parallel can possess energy
degeneracies indicative of $\textrm{\emph{intrinsic}}$ non-trivial topology. We
identify three topological invariants, one of which is related to a hidden
quantum mechanical supersymmetry. Depending on fabrication parameters, devices
are gapless or not, and fall on a simple phase diagram which is shown to be
robust to perturbations including junction imperfections, asymmetry, and
inductance. Josephson tunnel junction circuits, which are readily fabricated
with conventional microlithography techniques, allow access to a wide range of
topological systems which have no condensed matter analog. Notable spectral
features of these circuits, such as degeneracies and flat bands, may be
leveraged for quantum information applications, whereas quantized transport
properties could be useful for metrology applications.

<h3>Non-Analytic Magnetic Response and Intrinsic Ferromagnetic Clusters in a  Dirac Spin Liquid Candidate</h3>

<br>
<i>B.S. Shivaram, J. Prestigiacomo, Aini Xu, Zhenyuan Zeng, Trevor D. Ford, Itamar Kimchi, Shiliang Li, Patrick A. Lee</i>
<p>Finding distinct signatures of a quantum spin liquid (QSL) is an ongoing
quest in condensed matter physics, invariably complicated by the presence of
disorder in real materials. In this regard the 2D Kagome system
YCu$_3$(OH)$_6$[(Cl$_x$Br$_{(1-x)}$)$_{3-y}$(OH)$_y$] (YCOB-Cl), where the vast
mismatch in size of Y and Cu avoids subsitutional disorder, otherwise present
in kagome materials, has emerged as a favorable candidate. In crystals of this
system, with $x<$ 0.4 and no long range order, we report an unusual field
dependent magnetization $M(B)$, where $M/B$ changes linearly with $|B|$, the
absolute value of the field, in contrast to the expected quadratic behavior.
Model calculations with a distribution of ferromagnetic (FM) clusters
faithfully capture observed features suggesting such clusters to be intrinsic
to real QSL materials. YCOB-Cl has a field enhanced $T^2$ heat capacity as
expected for a Dirac QSL but lacks a linear $T$ behavior in the spin
susceptibility. By demonstrating that FM clusters dominate the contribution to
the susceptibility but not the heat capacity, our work paves the way towards
reconciling the apparent inconsistency with a Dirac QSL.
