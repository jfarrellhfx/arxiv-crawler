<h3>Thermal Transport in 2D Nematic Superconductors</h3>

We study the thermal transport in a two-dimensional system with coexisting
superconducting (SC) and nematic orders. We analyze the nature of the
coexistence phase in a tight-binding square lattice where the nematic state is
modelled as a $d$-wave Pomeranchuk type instability and the feedback of the
symmetry breaking nematic state on the SC order is accounted for by mixing of
the $s$, $d$ paring interaction. The electronic thermal conductivity is
computed within the framework of Boltzmann kinetic theory where the impurity
scattering collision is treated in the both the Born and Unitary limits. We
present qualitative, analytical, and numerical results that show that the heat
transport properties of SC states emerging from a nematic background are quite
distinct and depend on the degree of anisotropy of the SC gap induced by
nematicity. We describe the influence of the Fermi surface topology, the van
Hove singularities, and the presence or absence of zero energy excitations in
the coexistence phase on the the low temperature behaviour of the thermal
conductivity. Our main conclusion is that the interplay of nematic and SC
orders has visible signatures in the thermal transport which can be used to
infer SC gap structure in the coexistence phase.

<h3>Logarithmic negativity in out-of-equilibrium open free-fermion chains: An exactly solvable case</h3>

We derive the quasiparticle picture for the fermionic logarithmic negativity
in a tight-binding chain subject to gain and loss dissipation. We focus on the
dynamics after the quantum quench from the fermionic N\'eel state. We consider
the negativity between both adjacent and disjoint intervals embedded in an
infinite chain. Our result holds in the standard hydrodynamic limit of large
subsystems and long times, with their ratio fixed. Additionally, we consider
the weakly-dissipative limit, in which the dissipation rates are inversely
proportional to the size of the intervals. We show that the negativity is
proportional to the number of entangled pairs of quasiparticles that are shared
between the two intervals, as is the case for the mutual information.
Crucially, in contrast with the unitary case, the negativity content of
quasiparticles is not given by the R\'enyi entropy with R\'enyi index 1/2, and
it is in general not easily related to thermodynamic quantities.
