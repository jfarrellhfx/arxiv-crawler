<h3>Molecular hints of two-step transition to convective flow via streamline percolation</h3>

Convection is a key transport phenomenon important in many different areas,
from hydrodynamics and ocean circulation to planetary atmospheres or stellar
physics. However its microscopic understanding still remains challenging. Here
we numerically investigate the onset of convective flow in a compressible
(non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq) hard disk fluid under a temperature gradient in a
gravitational field. We uncover a surprising two-step transition scenario with
two different critical temperatures. When the bottom plate temperature reaches
a first threshold, convection kicks in (as shown by a structured velocity
field) but gravity results in hindered heat transport as compared to the
gravity-free case. It is at a second (higher) temperature that a percolation
transition of advection zones connecting the hot and cold plates triggers
efficient convective heat transport. Interestingly, this novel picture for the
convection instability opens the door to unknown piecewise-continuous solutions
to the Navier-Stokes equations.
