<h3>Anomaly inflow, dualities, and quantum simulation of abelian lattice  gauge theories induced by measurements</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08720" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08720</a>
<br>
<i>Takuya Okuda, Aswin Parayil Mana, Hiroki Sukeno</i>
<p>A previous work demonstrated that quantum simulation of abelian lattice gauge
theories (Wegner models including the toric code in a limit) in general
dimensions can be achieved by local adaptive measurements on symmetry-protected
topological (SPT) states with higher-form generalized global symmetries. The
entanglement structure of the resource SPT state reflects the geometric
structure of the gauge theory. In this work, we explicitly demonstrate the
anomaly inflow mechanism between the deconfining phase of the simulated gauge
theory on the boundary and the SPT state in the bulk, by showing that the
anomalous gauge variation of the boundary state obtained by bulk measurement
matches that of the bulk theory. Moreover, we construct the resource state and
the measurement pattern for the measurement-based quantum simulation of a
lattice gauge theory with a matter field (Fradkin-Shenker model), where a
simple scheme to protect gauge invariance of the simulated state against errors
is proposed. We further consider taking an overlap between the wave function of
the resource state for lattice gauge theories and that of a parameterized
product state, and we derive precise dualities between partition functions with
insertion of defects corresponding to gauging higher-form global symmetries, as
well as measurement-induced phases where states induced by a partial overlap
possess different (symmetry-protected) topological orders. Measurement-assisted
operators to dualize quantum Hamiltonians of lattice gauge theories and their
non-invertibility are also presented.

<h3>Thermodynamics of the dipole-octupole pyrochlore magnet  Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_{7}$ in applied magnetic fields</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08723" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08723</a>
<br>
<i>Anish Bhardwaj, Victor Porée, Han Yan, Nicolas Gauthier, Elsa Lhotel, Sylvain Petit, Jeffrey A. Quilliam, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy, Romain Sibille, Hitesh J. Changlani</i>
<p>The recently discovered dipole-octupole pyrochlore magnet Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$
is a promising three-dimensional quantum spin liquid candidate which shows no
signs of ordering at low temperature. The low energy effective pseudospin-1/2
description in a magnetic field is characterized by the XYZ Hamiltonian and a
Zeeman term where the dipolar local z-component of the pseudospin couples to
the local z-component of the applied magnetic field, while the local x- and
y-components of the pseudospin remain decoupled as a consequence of their
octupolar character. Using effective parameters determined in V. Poree et al.,
arXiv:2305.08261 (2023), remarkable experimental features can be reproduced, as
for instance the specific heat and magnetization data as well as the continuum
of states seen in neutron scattering. Here we investigate the thermodynamic
response to magnetic fields applied along the global [110] direction using
specific heat measurements and fits using numerical methods, and solve the
corresponding magnetic structure using neutron diffraction. Specific heat data
in moderate fields are reproduced well, however, at high fields the agreement
is not satisfactory. We especially observe a two-step release of entropy, a
finding that demands a review of both theory and experiment. We address it
within the framework of three possible scenarios, including an analysis of the
crystal field Hamiltonian not restricted to the two-dimensional single-ion
doublet subspace. We conclusively rule out two of these scenarios and find
qualitative agreement with a simple model of field misalignment with respect to
the crystalline direction. We discuss the implications of our findings for
[111] applied fields and for future experiments on Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ and its
sister compounds.

<h3>Universal low-temperature fluctuation of unconventional superconductors  revealed: 'Smoking gun' leaves proper bosonic superfluidity the last theory  standing</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08730" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08730</a>
<br>
<i>Anthony Hegg, Ruoshi Jiang, Jie Wang, Jinning Hou, Yucel Yildirim, Wei Ku</i>
<p>Low-temperature thermal fluctuations offer an essential window in
characterizing the true nature of a quantum state of matter, a quintessential
example being Fermi liquid theory. In the long-standing pursuit toward a
fundamental understanding of unconventional superconductivity, the most
essential low-temperature thermal fluctuation of superfluidity has
unfortunately been greatly overlooked. Here, we examine the leading thermal
fluctuation of the superfluid density across numerous families ranging from
relatively conventional to highly unconventional superconductors (MgB$_2$,
bismuthates, doped buckyballs, heavy fermions, Chevrel clusters,
intermetallics, $\kappa$-organics, transition metal dichalcogenides,
ruthenates, iron-pnictides, cuprates, and kagome metals). Amazingly, in all of
them an unprecedented universal $T^3$ depletion materializes in the
low-temperature superfluid density, even in the believed-to-be-conventional
MgB$_2$. This reveals a new quantum superfluid state of matter and requires a
necessary change of paradigm in describing modern superconductors. We
demonstrate that such unorthodox yet generic behavior can be described by an
proper particle-conserving theory of bosonic superfluidity hosting a long-lived
`true condensate'.

<h3>Magneto-optical Hall response in generic Weyl semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08735" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08735</a>
<br>
<i>Marcus Stålhammar</i>
<p>Weyl semimetals are predicted to host signature magneto-optical properties
sourced by their peculiar Landau level structure, including the chiral level.
Analytical studies are often leaving out the Hall component of the conductivity
due to its complicated nature, and even though the chiral anomaly requires Weyl
nodes to come in charge-conjugate pairs, toy-models hosting only one node are
considered almost exclusively; numerical studies including several Weyl nodes
are on the other hand often limited to high-field quantum limits or DC studies.
Here, I present a twofold purpose study, where I a) analytically derive a
closed-form expression also for the Hall conductivity of a generic Weyl
semimetal using linear response theory, and b) apply this general framework to
evaluate the transverse conductivity components for Weyl systems with two
nodes. I study how various model parameters, including the tilt, momentum
separation, and energy location of the nodes, as well as the chemical potential
affect the magneto-optical conductivity, and complement these studies with
deriving an analytical expression for the DC Hall conductivity, which is also
evaluated in various systems. Including a chiral pair of nodes result two
important differences compared to earlier studies; the contribution from the
chiral level is equal in size but opposite at the two nodes, making the net
contribution to disappear; the energy scales at which intraband transitions
occur is smeared out and approaches that of interband transitions,
strengthening the hypothesis that intraband transitions mask signature optical
features in materials. This general formalism can be applied for a large family
of generic Weyl semimetals, and comprise an important piece towards unravelling
the source of the mismatch between theoretical predictions and experimental
observations in candidate materials.

<h3>Universal stress correlations in crystalline and amorphous packings</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08738" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08738</a>
<br>
<i>Roshan Maharana, Debunker Das, Pinaki Chaudhuri, Kabir Ramola</i>
<p>We present a universal characterization of stress correlations in athermal
systems, across crystalline to amorphous packings. Via numerical analysis of
static configurations of particles interacting through harmonic as well as
Lennard-Jones potentials, for a variety of preparation protocols and ranges of
microscopic disorder, we show that the properties of the stress correlations at
large lengthscales are surprisingly universal across all situations,
independent of structural correlations, or the correlations in orientational
order. In the near-crystalline limit, we present exact results for the stress
correlations for both models, which work surprisingly well at large
lengthscales, even in the amorphous phase. Finally, we study the differences in
stress fluctuations across the amorphization transition, where stress
correlations reveal the loss of periodicity in the structure at short
lengthscales with increasing disorder.

<h3>Machine Learning Potential Powered Insights into the Mechanical  Stability of Amorphous Li-Si Alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08834" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08834</a>
<br>
<i>Zixiong Wei, Nongnuch Artrith</i>
<p>Understanding the mechanical properties of solid-state materials at the
atomic scale is crucial for developing novel materials. For example, amorphous
LiSi alloys are attractive anode materials for solid-state Li-ion batteries but
face mechanical instabilities due to significant volume variations with
changing Li content. A fundamental grasp of the mechanical behavior in such
systems is essential to address their poor mechanical integrity. Experimental
methods offer insufficient information to elaborate on dynamic mechanical
degradation mechanisms at the atomic scale, and computationally demanding
first-principles methods, like DFT, struggle to access the system sizes needed
for modeling mechanical phenomena. Machine learning potentials (MLPs) can
overcome the computational constraints of traditional DFT-based simulations,
enabling large-scale, accurate, and efficient simulations. Here, we provide a
concise tutorial on developing and applying MLPs to investigate mechanical
properties in materials systems, ranging from bulk to nanoparticles, using
Li-Si alloys as an example. Trained on a comprehensive dataset (~45,000 DFT
structures) with the aenet package accelerated by PyTorch, a robust MLP is
constructed to reproduce results consistent with previous experimental
observations. We demonstrate applying the MLP to realistic structures to
visualize the deformation mechanism and determine the origin of mechanical
instabilities caused by fracturing. This work aims to establish MLP-based
simulations as a tool to understand the atomic-scale mechanical behavior in
different materials systems.

<h3>Coexistence and interplay of two ferroelectric mechanisms in Zn1-xMgxO</h3>

<br>
<i>Jonghee Yang, Anton V. Ievlev, Anna N. Morozovska, Eugene Eliseev, Jonathan D Poplawsky, Devin Goodling, Robert Jackson Spurling, Jon-Paul Maria, Sergei V. Kalinin, Yongtao Liu</i>
<p>Ferroelectric materials promise exceptional attributes including low power
dissipation, fast operational speeds, enhanced endurance, and superior
retention to revolutionize information technology. However, the practical
application of ferroelectric-semiconductor memory devices has been
significantly challenged by the incompatibility of traditional perovskite oxide
ferroelectrics with metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. Recent discoveries of
ferroelectricity in binary oxides such as Zn1-xMgxO and Hf1-xZrxO have been a
focal point of research in ferroelectric information technology. This work
investigates the ferroelectric properties of Zn1-xMgxO utilizing automated band
excitation piezoresponse force microscopy. Our findings reveal the coexistence
of two ferroelectric subsystems within Zn1-xMgxO. We propose a "fringing-ridge
mechanism" of polarization switching that is characterized by initial lateral
expansion of nucleation without significant propagation in depth, contradicting
the conventional domain growth process observed in ferroelectrics. This unique
polarization dynamics in Zn1-xMgxO suggests a new understanding of
ferroelectric behavior, contributing to both the fundamental science of
ferroelectrics and their application in information technology.

<h3>Slow-Wave Hybrid Magnonics</h3>

<i>Jing Xu, Changchun Zhong, Shihao Zhuang, Chen Qian, Yu Jiang, Amin Pishehvar, Xu Han, Dafei Jin, Josep M. Jornet, Bo Zhen, Jiamian Hu, Liang Jiang, Xufeng Zhang</i>
<p>Cavity magnonics is an emerging research area focusing on the coupling
between magnons and photons. Despite its great potential for coherent
information processing, it has been long restricted by the narrow interaction
bandwidth. In this work, we theoretically propose and experimentally
demonstrate a novel approach to achieve broadband photon-magnon coupling by
adopting slow waves on engineered microwave waveguides. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first time that slow wave is combined with hybrid
magnonics. Its unique properties promise great potentials for both fundamental
research and practical applications, for instance, by deepening our
understanding of the light-matter interaction in the slow wave regime and
providing high-efficiency spin wave transducers. The device concept can be
extended to other systems such as optomagnonics and magnomechanics, opening up
new directions for hybrid magnonics.

<h3>Machine Learning, Density Functional Theory, and Experiments to  Understand the Photocatalytic Reduction of CO$_2$ by CuPt/TiO$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08884" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08884</a>
<br>
<i>Vaidish Sumaria, Takat B. Rawal, Young Feng Li, David Sommer, Jake Vikoren, Robert J. Bondi, Matthias Rupp, Amrit Prasad, Deeptanshu Prasad</i>
<p>The photoconversion of CO$_2$ to hydrocarbons is a sustainable route to its
transformation into value-added compounds and, thereby, crucial to mitigating
the energy and climate crises. CuPt nanoparticles on TiO$_2$ surfaces have been
reported to show promising photoconversion efficiency. For further progress, a
mechanistic understanding of the catalytic properties of these CuPt/TiO$_2$
systems is vital. Here, we employ \textit{ab-initio} calculations, machine
learning, and photocatalysis experiments to explore their configurational space
and examine their reactivity and find that the interface plays a key role in
stabilizing *CO$_2$, *CO, and other CH-containing intermediates, facilitating
higher activity and selectivity for methane. A bias-corrected machine-learning
interatomic potential trained on density functional theory data enables
efficient exploration of the potential energy surfaces of numerous
CO$_2$@CuPt/TiO$_2$ configurations via basin-hopping Monte Carlo simulations,
greatly accelerating the study of these photocatalyst systems. Our simulations
show that CO$_2$ preferentially adsorbs at the interface, with C atom bonded to
a Pt site and one O atom occupying an O-vacancy site. The interface also
promotes the formation of *CH and *CH$_2$ intermediates. For confirmation, we
synthesize CuPt/TiO$_2$ samples with a variety of compositions and analyze
their morphologies and compositions using scanning electron microscopy and
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and measure their photocatalytic
activity. Our computational and experimental findings qualitatively agree and
highlight the importance of interface design for selective conversion of CO$_2$
to hydrocarbons.

<p>Hydrogen dynamics in the nanoscale region of VO$_{2}$ was investigated by
muon spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu $SR) technique. Positively charged muon
acts as a light radioisotope of proton and can be used as a probe to explore
the inside of materials from an atomic perspective. By analyzing the muon
hopping rate and the spatial distribution of the $^{51}$V nuclear magnetic
moments, we have identified two types of diffusion paths in VO$_{2}$ (via
oxygen-muon bonds or defects) and the potential of a high diffusion coefficient
in the 10$^{-10}$ cm$^{2}$/s range at ambient temperature. Our results provide
valuable information for developing hydrogen-driven VO$_{2}$--related
electronic devices.

<h3>High-resolution spectroscopy of proximity superconductivity in  finite-size quantized surface states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08895" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08895</a>
<br>
<i>Lucas Schneider, Christian von Bredow, Howon Kim, Khai That Ton, Torben Hänke, Jens Wiebe, Roland Wiesendanger</i>
<p>Adding superconducting (SC) electron pairing via the proximity effect to
pristinely non-superconducting materials can lead to a variety of interesting
physical phenomena. Particular interest has recently focused on inducing SC
into two-dimensional surface states (SSs), potentially also combined with
non-trivial topology. We study the mechanism of proximity-induced SC into the
Shockley-type SSs of the noble metals Ag(111) and Cu(111) grown on the
elemental SC Nb(110) using scanning tunneling spectroscopy. The tunneling
spectra exhibit an intriguing multitude of sharp states at low energies. Their
appearance can be explained by Andreev bound states (ABS) formed by the weakly
proximitized SSs subject to lateral finite-size confinement. We study
systematically how the proximity gap in the bulk states of both Ag(111) and
Cu(111) persists up to island thicknesses of several times the bulk coherence
length of Nb. We find that even for thick islands, the SSs acquire a gap, with
the gap size for Cu being consistently larger than for Ag. Based on this, we
argue that the SC in the SS is not provided through direct overlap of the SS
wavefunction with the SC host but can be understood to be mediated by step
edges inducing electronic coupling to the bulk. Our work provides important
input for the microscopic understanding of induced superconductivity in
heterostructures and its spectral manifestation. Moreover, it lays the
foundation for more complex SC heterostructures based on noble metals.

<h3>Study of local conserved quantities in the one-dimensional Hubbard model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08924" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08924</a>
<br>
<i>Kohei Fukai</i>
<p>In this thesis, I study the local charges $\{Q_k\}$ in the one-dimensional
Hubbard model, which is an integrable system used for theoretical studies of
non-perturbative effects in strongly correlated electron systems. I obtained
their explicit expressions in a closed form. An expression of the $k$-local
charge $Q_k$ for $k > 5$, where $k$ denotes the support, had been unknown in
previous studies. I find that $Q_k$ is a linear combination of a particular
kind of products of the hopping terms. I introduce a diagrammatic notation to
represent these products efficiently, which enables the prediction of the
general formula of the local charges. These linear combinations have
non-trivial coefficients for $k > 5$, and some of the coefficients were proved
to be identical to the generalized Catalan numbers, which also appear in the
local charges of the Heisenberg chain. I derive the recursion equation for
these coefficients. I also prove that the obtained local charges are
exhaustive. Thus, any local charge is written as a linear combination of
$\{Q_k\}$. Although the completeness of the local charges is a natural
conjecture in the transfer-matrix formulation, its proof has not been presented
for almost all cases. Lastly, I emphasize that this is the first study
demonstrating general explicit expressions of the local charges for an electron
system that lacks the boost operator.

<h3>Structure and magnetic properties of a  La$_{0.75}$Sr$_{0.25}$Cr$_{0.90}$O$_{3-δ}$ single crystal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08940" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08940</a>
<br>
<i>Kaitong Sun, Yinghao Zhu, S. Yano, Qian Zhao, Muqing Su, Guanping Xu, Ruifeng Zheng, Ying Ellie Fu, Hai-Feng Li</i>
<p>We have successfully grown large and good-quality single crystals of the
La$_{0.75}$Sr$_{0.25}$Cr$_{0.90}$O$_{3-\delta}$ compound using the
floating-zone method with laser diodes. We investigated the crystal quality,
crystallography, chemical composition, magnetic properties and the oxidation
state of Cr in the grown single crystals by employing a combination of
techniques, including X-ray Laue and powder diffraction, scanning electron
microscopy, magnetization measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and
light absorption. The La$_{0.75}$Sr$_{0.25}$Cr$_{0.90}$O$_{3-\delta}$ single
crystal exhibits a single-phase composition, crystallizing in a trigonal
structure with the space group $R\bar{3}c$ at room temperature. The chemical
composition was determined as La$_{0.75}$Sr$_{0.25}$Cr$_{0.90}$O$_{3-\delta}$,
indicating a significant chromium deficiency. Upon warming, we observed five
distinctive characteristic temperatures, namely $T_1 =$ 21.50(1) K, $T_2 =$
34.98(1) K, $T_3 =$ 117.94(1) K, $T_4 =$ 155.01(1) K, and $T_{\textrm{N}} =$
271.80(1) K, revealing five distinct magnetic anomalies. Our magnetization
study allows us to explore the nature of these anomalies. Remarkably, the
oxidation state of chromium in the single-crystal
La$_{0.75}$Sr$_{0.25}$Cr$_{0.90}$O$_{3-\delta}$, characterized by a band gap of
1.630(8) eV, is exclusively attributed to Cr$^{3+}$ ions, making a departure
from the findings of previous studies on polycrystalline materials.

<h3>NMR contributions to the study of water transfer in proton exchange  membranes for fuel cells</h3>

<i>Jean-Christophe Perrin, Assma El Kaddouri, Laouès Guendouz, Christine Mrad, Kévin Mozet, Jérôme Dillet, Sebastien Leclerc, Olivier Lottin</i>
<p>As programs to support efficient and sustainable energy sources are
expanding, research into the potential applications of the hydrogen vector is
accelerating. Proton exchange membrane fuel cells are electrochemical
converters that transform the chemical energy of hydrogen into electrical
energy. These devices are used today for low- and medium-power stationary
applications and for mobility, in trains, cars, bicycles, etc. Proton exchange
membrane fuel cells use a polymer membrane as the electrolyte. The role of the
membrane is multiple: it must separate gases, be an electronic insulator and a
very good ionic conductor. In addition, it must resist free-radical chemical
attack and have good mechanical strength. Nafion-type perfluorinated membranes
have all these properties: the fluorinated backbone is naturally hydrophobic,
but the hydrophilic ionic groups give the material excellent water sorption
properties. The water adsorbed in the structure is extremely mobile, acting as
a transport medium for the protons generated at the anode. Although it has been
studied for a long time and has been the subject of a large number of papers
perfluorinated membranes are still the reference membranes today. This article
reviews some contributions of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance methods in liquid
state to the study of water properties in the structure of Nafion-type
perfluorinated membranes.

<p>The Casimir-Lifshitz force is calculated between a heterogeneous gapped metal
surface and a silica sphere attached to an AFM cantilever tip. We demonstrate
that heterogeneous surface patches with different off-stoichiometry surface

This can incorrectly be interpreted as occurrences of surface roughness.

<h3>Giant asymmetric proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling in twisted  graphene/SnTe heterostructure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09045" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09045</a>
<br>
<i>Marko Milivojević, Martin Gmitra, Marcin Kurpas, Ivan Štich, Jaroslav Fabian</i>
<p>We analyze the spin-orbit coupling effects in a three-degree twisted bilayer
heterostructure made of graphene and an in-plane ferroelectric SnTe, with the
goal of transferring the spin-orbit coupling from SnTe to graphene, via the
proximity effect. Our results indicate that the point-symmetry breaking due to
the incompatible mutual symmetry of the twisted monolayers and a strong
hybridization has a massive impact on the spin splitting in graphene close to
the Dirac point, with the spin splitting values greater than 20 meV. The band
structure and spin expectation values of graphene close to the Dirac point can
be described using a symmetry-free model, triggering different types of
interaction with respect to the threefold symmetric graphene/transition-metal
dichalcogenide heterostructure. We show that the strong hybridization of the
Dirac cone's right movers with the SnTe band gives rise to a large asymmetric
spin splitting in the momentum space. Furthermore, we discover that the
ferroelectricity-induced Rashba spin-orbit coupling in graphene is the dominant
contribution to the overall Rashba field, with the effective in-plane electric
field that is almost aligned with the (in-plane) ferroelectricity direction of
the SnTe monolayer. We also predict an anisotropy of the in-plane spin
relaxation rates. Our results demonstrate that the group-IV monochalcogenides
MX (M=Sn, Ge; X=S, Se, Te) are a viable alternative to transition-metal
dichalcogenides for inducing strong spin-orbit coupling in graphene.

<h3>Quantum Theory of Phonon Induced Anomalous Hall Effect in 2D Massive  Dirac metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09049" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09049</a>
<br>
<i>Jia-Xing Zhang, Wei Chen</i>
<p>The phonon induced anomalous Hall or thermal Hall effects have been observed
in various systems in recent experiments. However, the theoretical studies on
this subject are very scarce and incomplete. In this work, we present a
systematic quantum field theory study on the phonon induced anomalous Hall
effect, including both the side jump and skew scattering contributions, in a 2D
massive Dirac metal, which is considered as the minimum anomalous Hall system.
We reveal significant difference from the anomalous Hall effect induced by the
widely studied Gaussian disorder which is known to be insensitive to
temperature. While the anomalous Hall effect induced by phonon approaches that
by Gaussian disorder at high temperature, it behaves very differently at low
temperature. Our work provides a microscopic and quantitative description of
the crossover from the low to high temperature regime of the phonon induced
anomalous Hall conductivity, which may be observed in 2D Dirac metals with
breaking time reversal symmetry.

<h3>Effect of junction critical current disorder in superconducting quantum  interference filter arrays</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09093" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09093</a>
<br>
<i>K.-H. Müller, E. E. Mitchell</i>
<p>In this study, we investigated the performance of two 2D superconducting
quantum interference filter (SQIF) arrays fabricated from YBCO thin films at a
temperature of 77 K. Each array consisted of 6 Josephson junctions (JJs) in
parallel and 167 in series. We conducted both experimental and theoretical
analyses, measuring the arrays' voltage responses to an applied magnetic field
and their voltage versus bias-current characteristics. To properly model the
planar array layouts, our theoretical model used the stream function approach
and also included the Johnson noise in the JJs. The model further divides the
superconducting current density of the arrays into its Meissner current,
circulating current, and bias current parts for practicality. Since the
fabrication process of YBCO thin films cannot produce identical JJ critical
currents, we assumed a log-normal distribution to model the JJ critical current
disorder. Our model predictions, with a JJ critical current spread of 50%,
agreed well with our experimental data. Using our model, we were able to study
the dependence of the voltage modulation depth on critical current disorder and
London penetration depth. We also analyzed the observed reflection asymmetries
of the voltage versus magnetic field characteristics, which might provide
insight into the degree of critical current disorder. Overall, our findings
suggest that the use of YBCO thin films in SQIF arrays is promising, despite
the critical current disorder inherent in their fabrication process. Our study
highlights the importance of theoretical modeling in understanding the
performance of superconducting devices and provides insights that could inform
the design of future SQIF arrays.

<h3>Localization engineering by resonant driving in dissipative polariton  arrays</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09104" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09104</a>
<br>
<i>Gonzalo Usaj</i>
<p>Arrays of microcavity polaritons are very versatile systems that allow for
broad possibilities for the engineering of multi-orbital lattice geometries
using different state preparation schemes. One of these schemes, spatially
modulated resonant driving, can be used to selectively localize the polariton
field on a particular region of the lattice. Both the frequency and the spatial
amplitude distribution (module and phase) of the driven laser field are
important and serve as a knob to control the extend of the spatial
localization. Here, we analyse both the linear and nonlinear regimes using the
lattice Green function formalism that is particularly suitable for the case of
polariton arrays described in a tight-binding approximation. We identify the
conditions for maximum localization on arbitrary lattice's geometries and
discuss some experimentally relevant cases. We find that the
polariton-polariton interaction leads to a frequency shift of the optimal
localization condition that could be used to further control it.

<i>Andrey Kudlis, Ivan A. Aleksandrov, Mikhail M. Glazov, Ivan A. Shelykh</i>
<p>We theoretically investigate a nonlinear optical response of a planar
microcavity with an embedded transition metal dicalcogenide monolayer of a when
an energy of a biexcitonic transition is brought in resonance with an energy of
a cavity mode. We demonstrate that the emission spectrum of this system
strongly depends on an external pump. For small and moderate pumps we reveal
the presence of a doublet in the emission with the corresponding Rabi splitting
scaling as a square root of the number of the excitations in the system.
Further increase of the pump leads to the reshaping of the spectrum, which
demonstrates the pattern typical for a Mollow triplet. An intermediate pumping
regime shows a broad irregular spectrum reminiscent of a chaotic dynamics of
the system.

<h3>Machine learning assisted prediction of organic salt structure  properties</h3>

<i>Ethan P. Shapera, Dejan-Krešimir Bučar, Rohit P. Prasankumar, Christoph Heil</i>
<p>We demonstrate a machine learning-based approach which predicts the
properties of crystal structures following relaxation based on the unrelaxed
structure. Use of crystal graph singular values reduces the number of features
required to describe a crystal by more than an order of magnitude compared to
the full crystal graph representation. We construct machine learning models
using the crystal graph singular value representations in order to predict the
volume, enthalpy per atom, and metal versus semiconducting phase of DFT-relaxed
organic salt crystals based on randomly generated unrelaxed crystal structures.
Initial base models are trained to relate 89,949 randomly generated structures
of salts formed by varying ratios of 1,3,5-triazine and HCl with the
corresponding volumes, enthalpies per atom, and phase of the DFT-relaxed
structures. We further demonstrate that the base model is able to extrapolate
to new chemical systems with the inclusion of 2,000 to 10,000 crystal
structures from the new system. After training a single model with a large
number of data points, extension can be done at significantly lower cost. The
constructed machine learning models can be used to rapidly screen large sets of
randomly generated organic salt crystal structures and efficiently downselect
the structures most likely to be experimentally realizable. The models can be
used either as a stand-alone crystal structure predictor or incorporated into
more sophisticated workflows as a filtering step.

<h3>Manipulation of magnetic anisotropy of 2D magnetized graphene by  ferroelectric In$_2$Se$_3$</h3>

<br>
<i>Rui-Qi Wang, Tian-Min Lei, Yue-Wen Fang</i>
<p>The capacity to externally manipulate magnetic properties is highly desired
from both fundamental and technological perspectives, particularly in the
development of magnetoelectronics and spintronics devices. Here, using
first-principles calculations, we have demonstrated the ability of controlling
the magnetism of magnetized graphene monolayers by interfacing them with a
two-dimensional ferroelectric material. When the 3$d$ transition metal (TM) is
adsorbed on the graphene monolayer, its magnetization easy axis can be flipped
from in-plane to out-of-plane by the ferroelectric polarization reversal of
In$_2$Se$_3$, and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) can be high to
-0.692 meV/atom when adopting the Fe atom at bridge site with downward
polarization. This may be a universal method since the 3$d$ TM-adsorbed
graphene has a very small MAE, which can be easily manipulated by the
ferroelectric polarization. As a result, the inherent mechanism is analyzed by
second variation method.

<h3>Davydov's soliton in an external alternating magnetic field</h3>

<br>
<i>Larissa Brizhik</i>
<p>The influence of an external oscillating in time magnetic field on the
dynamics of the Davydov's soliton is investigated. It is shown that it
essentially depends not only on the amplitude and frequency of the magnetic
field, but also on the field orientation with respect to the molecular chain
axis. The soliton velocity and phase are calculated. They are oscillating in
time functions with the frequency of the main harmonic, given by the external
field frequency, and higher multiple harmonics. It is concluded that such
complex effects of external time-depending magnetic fields on the dynamics of
solitons modify the charge transport in low-dimensional molecular systems,
which can affect functioning of the devices based on such systems. These
results suggest also the physical mechanism of therapeutic effects of
oscillating magnetic fields, based on the field influence on the dynamics of
solitons which provide charge transport through biological macro-molecules in
the redox processes.

<p>The interface of two materials can harbor unexpected emergent phenomena. One
example is interface-induced superconductivity. In this work, we employ
molecular beam epitaxy to grow a series of heterostructures formed by stacking
together two non-superconducting antiferromagnetic materials, an intrinsic
antiferromagnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 and an antiferromagnetic iron
chalcogenide FeTe. Our electrical transport measurements reveal
interface-induced superconductivity in these heterostructures. By performing
scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy measurements, we observe a
proximity-induced superconducting gap on the top surface of the MnBi2Te4 layer,
confirming the interaction between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in
the MnBi2Te4 layer. Our findings will advance the fundamental inquiries into
the topological superconducting phase in hybrid devices and provide a promising
platform for the exploration of chiral Majorana physics in MnBi2Te4-based
heterostructures.

<br>
<i>Mathilde Auxois, Marine Minière, Chloé Bertrand-Drira, Fabien Salvatori, Jan Verstraete, Sébastien Manneville, Thibaut Divoux</i>
<p>The efficiency of supported catalysts depends on the porous microstructure of
their solid support, which regulates mass transfer, exposure to the active
phase, and mechanical strength. Here, we focus on the manufacturing of a
specific type of catalytic support, $\gamma$-alumina extrudates, by a
kneading-extrusion process. In this process, a paste is initially formed by
blending and subsequently kneading a boehmite powder, an aluminum oxide
hydroxide precursor of $\gamma$-alumina, with various liquids before undergoing
extrusion. The crucial step in this process is the kneading step, which allows
control over the textural and mechanical properties of the extrudate. The
present experimental study aims to measure the impact of the kneading step on
boehmite pastes prepared using a pilot kneader. The pastes are obtained by
mixing boehmite powder with an acid and a basic solution in a two-step process
known as peptization and neutralization. In this study, kneading is conducted
at various mixing speeds and durations while monitoring the torque exerted by
the boehmite paste on the kneader blades. Moreover, samples are extracted from
the pilot kneader at various stages of the kneading process, and their textural
properties are determined by both nitrogen sorption and mercury intrusion
porosimetry. Our findings show that, at fixed composition, the textural
properties of boehmite pastes are controlled by the overall deformation
accumulated during kneading. Conversely, for a fixed accumulated deformation,
the pH sets the textural properties. Finally, we identify an empirical control
parameter that captures the combined effects of pH and accumulated deformation
on the key textural attributes of boehmite pastes. These results set the stage
for a systematic design approach of boehmite-based catalyst supports.

<h3>Efficient Terahertz Generation from CoPt-based Terahertz Emitters via  Orbital-to-Charge Conversion</h3>

<i>Yongshan Liu, Yong Xu, Albert Fert, Henri-Yves Jaffres, Sylvain Eimer, Tianxiao Nie, Xiaoqiang Zhang, Weisheng Zhao</i>
<p>Orbitronics devices operate by manipulating orbitally-polarized currents.
Recent studies have shown that these orbital currents can be excited by
femtosecond laser pulses in ferromagnet as Ni and converted into ultrafast
charge current via orbital-to-charge conversion. However, the terahertz
emission from orbitronic terahertz emitter based on Ni is still much weaker
than the typical spintronic terahertz emitter. Here, we report more efficient
light-induced generation of orbital current from CoPt alloy and the orbitronic
terahertz emission by CoPt/Cu/MgO shows terahertz radiation comparable to that
of efficient spintronic terahertz emitters. By varying the concentration of
CoPt alloy, the thickness of Cu, and the capping layer, we confirm that THz
emission primarily originates from the orbital accumulation generated within
CoPt, propagating through Cu and followed by the subsequent orbital-to-charge
conversion from the inverse orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect at the Cu/MgO
interface. This study provides strong evidence for the very efficient orbital
current generation in CoPt alloy, paving the way to efficient orbital terahertz
emitters.

<h3>Nonreciprocal collective dynamics in a mixture of phoretic Janus  colloids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09279" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09279</a>
<br>
<i>Gennaro Tucci, Ramin Golestanian, Suropriya Saha</i>
<p>A multicomponent mixture of Janus colloids with distinct catalytic coats and
phoretic mobilities is a promising theoretical system to explore the collective
behavior arising from nonreciprocal interactions. An active colloid produces
(or consumes) chemicals, self-propels, drifts along chemical gradients, and
rotates its intrinsic polarity to align with a gradient. As a result the
connection from microscopics to continuum theories through coarse-graining
couples densities and polarization fields in unique ways. Focusing on a binary
mixture, we show that these couplings render the unpatterned reference state
unstable to small perturbations through a variety of instabilities including
oscillatory ones which arise on crossing an exceptional point or through a Hopf
bifurcation. For fast relaxation of the polar fields, they can be eliminated in
favor of the density fields to obtain a microscopic realization of the
Nonreciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model for two conserved species with two distinct
sources of non-reciprocity, one in the interaction coefficient and the other in
the interfacial tension. Our work establishes Janus colloids as a versatile
model for a bottom-up approach to both scalar and polar active mixtures.

<h3>Quantized Thouless pumps protected by interactions in dimerized Rydberg  tweezer arrays</h3>

<br>
<i>Sergi Julià-Farré, Javier Argüello-Luengo, Loïc Henriet, Alexandre Dauphin</i>
<p>We study Thouless pumps, i.e., adiabatic topological transport, in an
interacting spin chain described by the dimerized XXZ Hamiltonian. In the
noninteracting case, quantized Thouless pumps can only occur when a topological
singularity is encircled adiabatically. In contrast, here we show that, in the
presence of interactions, such topological transport can even persist for
exotic paths in which the system gets arbitrarily close to the singularity. We
illustrate the robustness of these exotic Thouless pumps through the behavior
of the noninteracting singularity, which for sufficiently strong interactions
splits into two singularities separated by a spontaneous antiferromagnetic
insulator. We perform a numerical benchmark of these phenomena by means of
tensor network simulations of ground-state physics and real-time adiabatic
dynamics. Finally, we propose an experimental protocol with Floquet-driven
Rydberg tweezer arrays.

<p>A Josephson junction (JJ) has been under intensive study ever since 1960's.
Yet even in the present era of building quantum information processing devices
based on many JJs, open questions regarding a single junction remain unsolved,
such as quantum phase transitions, coupling of the JJ to an environment and
improving coherence of a superconducting qubit. Here we design and build an
engineered on-chip reservoir that acts as an efficient bolometer for detecting
the Josephson radiation under non-equilibrium (biased) conditions. The
bolometer converts ac Josephson current at microwave frequencies, up to about
$100\,$GHz, into a measurable dc temperature rise. The present experiment
demonstrates an efficient, wide-band, thermal detection scheme of microwave
photons and provides a sensitive detector of Josephson dynamics beyond the
standard conductance measurements. Using a circuit model, we capture both the
current-voltage characteristics and the measured power quantitatively.

<p>In this work, we study the cobalt radical interface obtained by depositing a
monolayer of a derivative of the Blatter radical on polycrystalline cobalt. By
examining the occupied and unoccupied states at the interface, using soft X-ray
techniques, and combining them with ab initio calculations, we can completely
determine the electronic structure at the interface, simultaneously, on both
the molecular and ferromagnetic sides, and thus obtain a full understanding of
the magnetic properties at the interface. We find that the molecule is strongly
hybridized with the surface. Changes in the core level spectra reflect the
modification of the molecule and cobalt electronic structure induced by the
bonding across the interface. This causes a decrease in the magnetic moments of
the cobalt atoms bonded to the molecules that lose their radical character. Our
method allows screening, beforehand, the organic ferromagnetic interfaces in
view of potential applications in spintronic.

<h3>On the system size dependence of the diffusion coefficients in MD  simulations: A simple correction formula for pure dense fluids</h3>

<br>
<i>Sergey Khrapak</i>
<p>A practical correction formula relating the self-diffusion coefficient of
dense liquids from molecular dynamics simulations with periodic boundary
conditions to the self-diffusion coefficient in the thermodynamic limit is
discussed. This formula applies to pure dense fluids and has a very simple form
$D=D_0(1-\gamma N^{-1/3})$, where $D_0$ is the self-diffusion coefficient in
the thermodynamic limit and $N$ is the number of particles in the simulation.
The numerical factor $\gamma$ depends on the geometry of the simulation cell.
Remarkably, $\gamma\simeq 1.0$ for the most popular cubic geometry. The success
of this formula is supported by results from MD simulations, including very
recent simulations with a ``magic'' simulation geometry.

<p>Rare-earth diantimondes exhibit coupling between structural and electronic
orders which are tunable under pressure and temperature. Here we present the
discovery of a new polymorph of LaSb$_2$ stabilized in thin films synthesized
using molecular beam epitaxy. Using diffraction, electron microscopy, and first
principles calculations we identify a YbSb$_2$-type monoclinic lattice as a
yet-uncharacterized stacking configuration. The material hosts
superconductivity with a $T_\mathrm{c}$ = 2 K, which is enhanced relative to
the bulk ambient phase, and a long superconducting coherence length of 140 nm.
This result highlights the potential thin film growth has in stabilizing novel
stacking configurations in quasi-two dimensional compounds with competing
layered structures.

<h3>Investigation of Ga interstitial and vacancy diffusion in  $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ via split defects: a direct approach via master diffusion  equations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09354" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09354</a>
<br>
<i>Channyung Lee, Michael A. Scarpulla, Elif Ertekin</i>
<p>The low symmetry of monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ leads to elaborate
intrinsic defects, such as Ga vacancies split amongst multiple lattice sites.
These defects contribute to fast, anisotropic Ga diffusion, yet their
complexity makes it challenging to understand dominant diffusion mechanisms.
Here, we predict the 3D diffusivity tensors for Ga interstitials
(Ga${_i^{3+}}$) and vacancies (V${_{Ga}^{3-}}$) via first principles and direct
solution of the master diffusion equations. We first explore the maximum extent
of configurationally complex ''$N$-split'' Ga interstitials and vacancies. With
dominant low-energy defects identified, we enumerate all possible elementary
hops connecting defect configurations to each other, including interstitialcy
hops. Hopping barriers are obtained from nudged elastic band simulations.
Finally, the comprehensive sets of (i) defect configurations and their energies
and (ii) the hopping barriers that connect them are used to construct the
master diffusion equations for both Ga${_i^{3+}}$ and V${_{Ga}^{3-}}$. The
solution to these equations yields the Onsager transport coefficients, i.e. the
components of the 3D diffusivity tensors $D_{{Ga}_i}$ and $D_{V_{Ga}}$ for
Ga${_i^{3+}}$ and V${_{Ga}^{3-}}$, respectively. It further reveals the active
diffusion paths along all crystallographic directions. We find that both
Ga${_i^{3+}}$ and V${_{{Ga}}^{3-}}$ diffusion are fastest along the $c$-axis,
due to 3-split defects that bridge neighboring unit cells along the $c$-axis
and divert diffusing species around high-energy bottlenecks. Although isolated
Ga${_i^{3+}}$ diffuse faster than isolated V${_{Ga}^{3-}}$, self-diffusion of
Ga is predominantly mediated by V$_{Ga}^{3-}$ due to the higher V$_{Ga}^{3-}$
defect concentration under most thermodynamic environments.

<p>Strongly differing static dipole moments of the trans and cis isomers of
photochromic azobenzene allow for optical switching the work function of
azobenzene-functionalized self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). We apply these

illumination and the transient isomerization profile of the SAM was spatially
resolved recording photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) images. Thereby we
demonstrate the spatial tuning of the SAM work-function and discuss the role of
the laser spot-profile in generating sharp edges or gradual changes of the work

<br>
<i>Pietro Pampili, Vitaly Z. Zubialevich, Peter J. Parbrook</i>
<p>In this study we report on a novel two-step epitaxial growth technique that
enables a significant improvement of the crystal quality of nitrogen-polar GaN.
The starting material is grown on 4{\deg} vicinal sapphire substrates by metal
organic vapour phase epitaxy, with an initial high-temperature sapphire
nitridation to control polarity. The material is then converted into a regular
array of hexagonal pyramids by wet-etch in a KOH solution, and subsequently
regrown to coalesce the pyramids back into a smooth layer of improved crystal
quality. The key points that enable this technique are the control of the array
geometry, obtained by exploiting the anisotropic behaviour of the wet-etch
step, and the use of regrowth conditions that preserve the orientation of the
pyramids' sidewalls. In contrast, growth conditions that cause an excessive
expansion of the residual (000-1) facets on the pyramids' tops cause the onset
of a very rough surface morphology upon full coalescence. An X-ray diffraction
study confirms the reduction of the threading dislocation density as the
regrowth step develops. The analysis of the relative position of the 000-2 GaN
peak with respect to the 0006 sapphire peak reveals a macroscopic tilt of the
pyramids, probably induced by the large off-axis substrate orientation. This
tilt correlates very well with an anomalous broadening of the 000-2 diffraction
peaks at the beginning of the regrowth step.

<h3>A superstatistical measure of distance from canonical equilibrium</h3>

<br>
<i>Sergio Davis</i>
<p>Non-equilibrium systems in steady states are commonly described by
generalized statistical mechanical theories such as non-extensive statistics
and superstatistics. Superstatistics assumes that the inverse temperature
$\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ follows some pre-established statistical distribution,
however, it has been previously proved (Physica A 505, 864-870 [2018]) that
$\beta$ cannot be associated to an observable function $B(\boldsymbol{\Gamma})$
of the microstates $\boldsymbol{\Gamma}$. In this work, we provide an
information-theoretical interpretation of this theorem by introducing a new
quantity $\mathcal{D}$, the mutual information between $\beta$ and
$\boldsymbol{\Gamma}$. Our results show that $\mathcal{D}$ is also a measure of
departure from canonical equilibrium, and reveal a minimum, non-zero
uncertainty about $\beta$ given $\boldsymbol{\Gamma}$ for every non-canonical
superstatistical ensemble. This supports the use of the mutual information as a
descriptor of complexity and correlation in complex systems, also providing in
some cases a sound basis for the use of Tsallis' entropic index $q$ as a
measure of distance from equilibrium, being in those cases a proxy for
$\mathcal{D}$.

<p>A promising route towards the realization of chiral spin liquids is the
quantum melting of classically noncoplanar spin states via quantum
fluctuations. In the classical realm, such noncoplanar orders can effectively
be stabilized by interactions beyond nearest neighbors. Motivated by the recent
synthesis of materials with a maple-leaf lattice geometry, we study the effect
of cross-plaquette couplings on elementary Heisenberg antiferromagnets for this
geometry. We find a rich spectrum of noncoplanar states, including a novel
icosahedral order as well as incommensurate spin spirals, using large-scale
Monte Carlo simulations in combination with a semi-analytical analysis. To
inspect the potential quantum melting of these states, we analyze the quantum
$S = 1/2$ variant of these models using pseudo-fermion functional
renormalization group (pf-FRG) simulations. Notably, we indeed find extended
parameter regimes lacking long-range magnetic order -- in regions classically
occupied by noncoplanar orders -- which we putatively identify with the
possible formation of chiral quantum spin liquids.

<p>Due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space dimension with system
size, the simulation of quantum many-body systems has remained a persistent
challenge until today. Here, we review a relatively new class of variational
states for the simulation of such systems, namely neural quantum states (NQS),
which overcome the exponential scaling by compressing the state in terms of the
network parameters rather than storing all exponentially many coefficients
needed for an exact parameterization of the state. We introduce the commonly
used NQS architectures and their various applications for the simulation of
ground and excited states, finite temperature and open system states as well as
NQS approaches to simulate the dynamics of quantum states. Furthermore, we
discuss NQS in the context of quantum state tomography.
