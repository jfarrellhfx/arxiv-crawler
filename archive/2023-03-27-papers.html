The ``flow'' of electric currents and heat in standard metals is diffusive
with electronic motion randomized by impurities. However, for ultraclean
metals, electrons can flow like water with their flow being described by the
equations of hydrodynamics. While theoretically postulated, this situation was
highly elusive for decades. In the last decade, several experimental groups
have found strong indications for this type of flow, especially in
graphene-based devices. In this review, we give an overview of some of the
recent key developments, both on the theoretical and experimental side.

<h3>A review on the advancements in the characterization of the  high-pressure properties of iodates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14215" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14215</a>

<br>
<br>
The goal of this work is to report a systematic and balanced review of the
progress made in recent years on the high-pressure behavior of iodates, a group
of materials with multiple technological applications and peculiar behaviors
under external compression. This review article presents results obtained from
multiple characterization techniques which include: X-ray diffraction, Raman
and infrared spectroscopy, optical-absorption, resistivity, and second-harmonic
generation measurements. The discussion of the results from experiments will be
combined with density-functional theory calculations which have been shown to
be a very useful tool for the interpretation of experimental data. Throughout
the manuscript many of the phenomena observed will be connected to the presence
of a lone electron pairs of the iodine atoms in the studied iodates. The
presence of the lone electron pairs plays a crucial role in the high-pressure
behavior of iodates and it is associated with many of the phenomena discussed
here, in particular with the pressure-induced changes in the character of
iodine-oxygen bonds, which causes many physical properties to behave
nonlinearly. Towards the end of this review, a discussion of current problems
that remain unsolved is presented as well as proposals for possible avenues for
future studies.

<h3>Proximity effect in superconductor/antiferromagnet hybrids: Neel  triplets and impurity suppression of superconductivity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14225" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14225</a>
<br>
<i>G.A. Bobkov, I. V. Bobkova, A. M. Bobkov</i>
<br>
<br>
By now two possible physical mechanisms of superconductivity suppression at
superconductor/antiferromagnet (S/AF) interfaces, which work even for
interfaces with compensated antiferromagnets, were reported. One of them
suggests that the Neel order of the AF induces rapidly oscillating spin-triplet
correlations in the S layer. They are called Neel triplets and they suppress
singlet superconductivity. Nonmagnetic disorder destroys this type of triplet
correlations. As a result, the critical temperature of the S/AF bilayer grows
with impurity strength. The second mechanism, on the contrary, suggests that
nonmagnetic impurity scattering suppresses superconductivity in S/AF hybrids.
The predictions were made in the framework of two different quasiclassical
approaches [G. A. Bobkov et al. Phys. Rev. B 106, 144512 (2022) and E. H. Fyhn
et al. arXiv:2210.09325]. Here we suggest the unified theory of the proximity
effect in thin-film S/AF structures, which incorporates the both pictures as
limiting cases and study the proximity effect at S/AF interfaces for arbitrary
impurity strength, chemical potential and the value of the Neel exchange field.

<h3>Andreev reflection in altermagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14236" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14236</a>
<br>
<i>Chi Sun, Arne Brataas, Jacob Linder</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent works have predicted materials featuring bands with a large
spin-splitting distinct from ferromagnetic and relativistically spin-orbit
coupled systems. Materials displaying this property known as altermagnets,
featuring a spin-polarized band structure reminiscent of a $d$-wave
superconducting order parameter. We here consider the contact between an
altermagnet and a superconductor and determine how the altermagnetism affects
the fundamental process of Andreev reflection. We show that the resulting
charge and spin conductance depends strongly on the interfacial orientation of
the altermagnet relative the superconductor. The topological zero-energy states
present at the interface in the $d$-wave case are robust toward the presence of
an altermagnetic interaction. Moreover, the spin conductance can be increased
by more than an order of magnitude compared to its normal-state value and also
changes its sign via the applied bias voltage. These results show how the
spin-anisotropic altermagnetic state can be probed by conductance spectroscopy,
and how it offers voltage-control over directionally dependent spin currents
that are strongly enhanced due to superconductivity.

<h3>Anticorrosion properties of silica-based sol-gel coatings on steel --  the influence of hydrolysis and condensation conditions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14250" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14250</a>
<br>
<i>Jolanta Gasiorek, Anna Gasiorek, Bartosz Babiarczuk, Walis Jones, Wojciech Simka, Jerzy Detyna, Jerzy Kaleta, Justyna Krzak</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, we present indirect methods to define the change in the rates
of hydrolysis and condensation reactions of a silica oxide network formed of
(3-glycidoxypropyl)methyltriethoxysilane (GPTMS) and
(3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (ApTEOS), which was strongly dependent upon the
nature of the solvent used in the reaction environment, such as methanol,
ethanol, propanol, butanol and acetone. Electron microscopy (SEM), focused ion
beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB), and Raman spectroscopy were used to
investigate the morphology and structure changes. UV-VIS spectrometry, a
wettability test, a scratch test and electrochemical tests, namely Tafel's
polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), were used to
analyze the functional changes in the obtained silica coatings. The coating
synthesized in a methanol environment showed a polarization resistance (Rp)
almost an order of magnitude greater than those synthesized in the other
organic solvents. The greatest thickness, nearly 1.5 um, was obtained with the
ethanol based coatings. Almost twice as much force (near 11 N) was required to
detach the acetone based coatings, compared to the other coatings. Propanol and
butanol contribute to the defects created and the decreased protection
properties in the final materials and show a statistically significant
influence on the formed corrosion film under sol-gel coatings, particularly for
coatings based on propanol. No statistically significant influence of the
solvents was observed on the thickness of coatings prepared with butanol or
acetone.

<h3>Surface termination control of charge transfer and band alignment across  a semiconductor-crystalline oxide heterojunction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14323" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14323</a>
<br>
<i>M. Chrysler, J. Gabel, T.-L. Lee, Z. Zhu, T. C. Kaspar, P. V. Sushko, S. A. Chambers, J. H. Ngai</i>
<br>
<br>
Charge redistribution across heterojunctions has long been utilized to induce
functional response in materials systems. Here we examine how the composition
of the terminating surface affects charge transfer across a heterojunction
consisting of Si and the crystalline complex oxide SrTiO3. Itinerant electrons
in Si migrate across the interface toward the surface of SrTiO3 due to surface
depletion. The electron transfer in turn creates an electric field across the
interface that modifies the interfacial dipole associated with bonding between
SrTiO3 and Si, leading to a change in the band alignment from type-II to
type-III. By capping the SrTiO3 surface with ultra-thin layers of BaO, SrO or
TiO2, charge transfer across the interface can be weakened or inhibited. Ab
initio modeling implicates the adsorption of oxygen as driving surface
depletion in SrTiO3. The electronic coupling between the surface and buried
interface expands the functionality of semiconductor-crystalline oxide
heterojunctions.

<h3>Computing entanglement entropy of interacting fermions with quantum  Monte Carlo: Why we failed and how to get it right</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14326" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14326</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
There is no doubt that the information hidden in quantum entanglement can be
used to infer the organizing principle of various quantum phases of matter,
ranging from spontaneous symmetry breaking phases, quantum critical points to
topologically ordered states. It is far from clear, however, whether
entanglement measures, such as the entanglement entropy (EE), can actually be
obtained with the precision required to observe these subtle features --
usually in the form of universal finite size scaling behavior -- in highly
entangled quantum matter. In the case of 2D interacting fermionic lattice
models with gapless spectra, such as in the Hubbard model, the computation of
the EE has faced severe limitations, making reliable data in the universal
scaling regime off limits to all existing numerical algorithms. Here we explain
the reason for the previously unsuccessful attempts in EE computations in
quantum Monte Carlo simulations and more importantly, show how to overcome the
conceptual and computational barrier with the incremental algorithm[1,2], such
that the computation of the EE in 2D interacting fermion systems finally
becomes easy and reliable.

<h3>Natural orbitals renormalization group approach to a spin-1/2 impurity  interacting with two helical liquids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14331" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14331</a>
<br>
<i>Ru Zheng, Rong-Qiang He, Zhong-Yi Lu</i>
<br>
<br>
Using the natural orbitals renormalization group, we studied the problem of a
localized spin- 1/2 impurity coupled to two helical liquids via the Kondo
interaction in a quantum spin Hall insulator, based on the Kane-Mele model
defined in a finite zigzag graphene nanoribbon. We investigated the influence
of the Kondo couplings with the helical liquids on both the static and dynamic
properties of the ground state. The number and distinct spatial structures of
the active natural orbitals (ANOs), which play essential roles in constructing
the ground-state wave function, were first analyzed. Our numerical results
indicate that two ANOs emerge, equal to the number of helical liquids.
Specifically, at the coupling symmetry point, both ANOs are fully active with
their spatial structures being respectively constituted by the different
helical liquids. In comparison, when deviating from the symmetry point, only
one ANO remains fully active, which is dominantly constructed by the helical
liquid with the larger Kondo coupling. Local screening of the impurity,
described by the impurity spin polarization and susceptibility, was further
studied. It shows that at the coupling symmetry point, the impurity is
maximally polarized and the spin susceptibility reaches the maximum. On the
contrary, the impurity tends to be screened without polarization when the Kondo
couplings deviate well from the symmetry point. The Kondo screening cloud,
manifested by the spin correlation between the impurity and the conduction
electrons, was finally explored. It is demonstrated that the Kondo cloud is
mainly formed by the helical liquid with the larger Kondo coupling to the
impurity. On the other hand, the spin-orbital coupling breaks the symmetry in
spatial distribution of the spin correlation, leading to anisotropy in the
Kondo cloud.

<h3>Observation of multigap and coherence peak in the noncentrosymmetric  superconductor CaPtAs: $^{75}$As nuclear quadrupole resonance measurement</h3>

<i>Yuya Nagase, Masahiro Manago, Junichi Hayashi, Keiki Takeda, Hideki Tou, Eiichi Matsuoka, Hitoshi Sugawara, Hisatomo Harima, Hisashi Kotegawa</i>
<br>
<br>
We present synthesis and $^{75}$As-nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR)
measurements for the noncentrosymmetric superconductor CaPtAs with a
superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ of $\sim 1.5$ K. We discovered two
different forms of CaPtAs during synthesis; one is a high-temperature
tetragonal form that was previously reported, and the other is a
low-temperature form consistent with the orthorhombic structure of CaPtP.
According to the $^{75}$As-NQR measurement for superconducting tetragonal
CaPtAs, the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ has an obvious
coherence peak below $T_c$ and does not follow a simple exponential variation
at low temperatures. These findings indicate that CaPtAs is a multigap
superconductor and a large $s$-wave component.

<h3>Ferroelectric metals in 1T/1T'-phase bilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14343" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14343</a>
<br>
<i>Haohao Sheng, Zhijun Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
Typically, ferroelectricity and metallicity cannot coexist due to the
screening effect of conducting electrons, and a large number of stable
monolayers with 1T/1T$^{\prime}$ phase lack spontaneous polarization due to
inversion symmetry (IS). In this work, we have constructed the $\pi$-bilayer
structures for $M$Te$_2$ ($M =$ Pt, Pd, and Ni) with van der Waals (vdW)
stacking, where two monolayers are related by $C_{2z}$ rotation, and have
demonstrated that these $\pi$-bilayers are typical ferroelectric metals (FEMs).
The vertical polarization of PtTe$_2$ $\pi$-bilayer is 0.46 pC/m, comparable to
that of FEM WTe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$ $\pi$-bilayers. We show that the switching of
polarization can be realized through interlayer sliding, which only requires
crossing a very small energy barrier. The interlayer vdW charge transfer is the
source of both vertical polarization and metallicity, and these properties are
closely related to the spatially extended Te-$p_z$ orbital. Finally, we reveal
that electron doping can significantly adjust the vertical polarization of
these FEMs in both magnitude and direction. Our findings introduce a new class
of FEMs, which have potential applicatioons in functional nanodevices such as
ferroelectric tunneling junction and nonvolatile ferroelectric memory.

<h3>Universal Properties of the Spectral Form Factor in Open Quantum Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14352" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14352</a>
<br>
<i>Yi-Neng Zhou, Tian-Gang Zhou, Pengfei Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
The spectral form factor (SFF) can probe the eigenvalue statistic at
different energy scales as its time variable varies. In closed quantum chaotic
systems, the SFF exhibits a universal dip-ramp-plateau behavior, which reflects
the spectrum rigidity of the Hamiltonian. In this work, we explore the
universal properties of SFF in open quantum systems. We find that in open
systems the SFF first decays exponentially, followed by a linear increase at
some intermediate time scale, and finally decreases to a saturated plateau
value. We derive universal relations between (1) the early-time decay exponent
and Lindblad operators; (2) the long-time plateau value and the number of
steady states. We also explain the effective field theory perspective of
universal behaviors. We verify our theoretical predictions by numerically
simulating the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, random matrix theory (RMT), and
the Bose-Hubbard model.

<h3>Collinear antiferromagnetic ordering in double perovskite oxide  Sr$_2$NiWO$_6$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14370" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14370</a>
<br>
<i>Cheng Su, Xu-Tao Zeng, Kaitong Sun, Denis Sheptyakov, Ziyu Chen, Xian-Lei Sheng, Haifeng Li, Wentao Jin</i>
<br>
<br>
Magnetic double perovskite compounds provide a fertile playground to explore
interesting electronic and magnetic properties. By complementary macroscopic
characterizations, neutron powder diffraction measurements and first-principles
calculations, we have performed comprehensive studies on the magnetic ordering
in the double perovskite compound Sr$_2$NiWO$_6$. It is found by neutron
diffraction to order magnetically in a collinear AFM structure in a tetragonal
lattice with $k$ = (0.5, 0, 0.5) below $T\rm_N$ = 56 K. In the ground state,
the ordered moment of the spin-1 Ni$^{2+}$ ions is determined to be 1.9(2)
$\mu\rm_{B}$, indicating a significant quenching of the orbital moment. The
Ni$^{2+}$ moments in Sr$_2$NiWO$_6$ are revealed to cant off the $c$ axis by
29.2$^{\circ}$ with an easy-axis type magnetic anisotropy, which is well
supported by the first-principles calculations. Furthermore, the in-plane and
out-of-plane next-nearest-neighbor superexchange couplings ($J\rm_2$ and
$J\rm_{2c}$) are found to play a dominant role in the spin Hamiltonian of
Sr$_2$NiWO$_6$, which accounts for the stabilization of the collinear AFM-II
structure as its magnetic ground state.

<h3>Equilibrium via multi-spin-flip Glauber dynamics in Ising Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14380" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14380</a>
<br>
<i>Diana Thongjaomayum, Prabodh Shukla</i>
<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding great strides that statistical mechanics has made in recent
decades, an analytic solution of arguably the simplest model of relaxation
dynamics, the Ising model in an applied external field remains elusive even in
$1d$. Extant studies are based on numerics using single-spin-flip Glauber
dynamics. There is no reason why this algorithm should lead to the global
minimum energy state of the system. With this in mind, we explore
multi-spin-flip parallel and sequential Glauber dynamics of Ising spins in $1d$
and also on a regular random graph of coordination number $z=3$. We view our
study as a small initial step to test the generally implied hypothesis that the
equilibrium is independent of the relaxational dynamics or if it carries some
signature of it.

<h3>Non-equilibrium fractional Josephson effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14385" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14385</a>
<br>
<i>Aritra Lahiri, Sang-Jun Choi, Björn Trauzettel</i>
<br>
<br>
Josephson tunnel junctions exhibit a supercurrent typically proportional to
the sine of the superconducting phase difference $\phi$. In general, a term
proportional to $\cos(\phi)$ is also present, alongside microscopic electronic
retardation effects. We show that voltage pulses sharply varying in time prompt
a significant impact of the $\cos(\phi)$ term. Its interplay with the
$\sin(\phi)$ term results in a non-equilibrium fractional Josephson effect
$\sim\sin(\phi/2)$ in the presence of bound states close to zero frequency. Our
microscopic analysis reveals that the interference of non-equilibrium virtual
quasiparticle excitations is responsible for this phenomenon. We also analyse
this phenomenon for topological Josephson junctions with Majorana bound states.
Remarkably, the non-equilibrium fractional Josephson effect is independent of
the ground state fermion parity unlike its equilibrium counterpart.

<h3>Relative efficiency of three mechanisms of vector fields growth in a  random media</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14388" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14388</a>
<br>
<i>E. A. Illarionov, D. D. Sokoloff</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider a model of a random media with fixed and finite memory time with
abrupt losses of memory (renovation model). Within the memory intervals we can
observe either amplification or oscillation of the vector field in a given
particle. The cumulative effect of amplifications in many subsequent intervals
leads to amplification of the mean field and mean energy. Similarly, the
cumulative effect of intermittent amplifications or oscillations also leads to
amplification of the mean field and mean energy, however, at a lower rate.
Finally, the random oscillations alone can resonate and yield the growth of the
mean field and energy. These are the three mechanisms that we investigate and
compute analytically and numerically the growth rates based on the Jacobi
equation with the random curvature parameter.

<h3>Two Anderson impurities coupled through a superconducting island: charge  stability diagrams and double impurity qubit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14410" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14410</a>
<br>
<i>Filip K. Malinowski</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a model of two Anderson impurities coupled to and through a
superconducting island. The model parametrizes the strength of the coupling
between impurity sites, allowing it to represent a variable distance between
the impurities. We systematically explore the effect of the model parameters in
the subspaces with total even and odd occupancy, identifying unique features of
the charge stability diagrams that distinguish the two parities. For total odd
electron parity, we identify a device tuning, in which the splitting between
the two lowest energy states is highly insensitive to changes of the chemical
potentials. We investigate the degree to which a qubit based on such two states
is tunable and discuss an optimal choice of parameters to maximize
inhomogeneous dephasing time. Finally, we point out that the proposed qubit
lacks a transition dipole moment, and outline some of the consequences on
viable driving and readout mechanisms. The prototype qubits could be realized
with the existing capabilities of coupling quantum dots to hard-gapped
superconductors.

<h3>Muon spin relaxation and emergence of disorder-induced unconventional  dynamic magnetic fluctuations in Dy$_{2}$Zr$_{2}$O$_{7}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14426" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14426</a>

<br>
<br>
The disordered pyrochlore oxide Dy$_{2}$Zr$_{2}$O$_{7}$ shows the signatures
of field-induced spin freezing with remnant zero-point spin-ice entropy at 5
kOe magnetic field. We have performed zero-field and longitudinal field Muon
spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) studies on Dy$_{2}$Zr$_{2}$O$_{7}$. Our zero field
studies reveal the absence of both long-range ordering and spin freezing down
to 62 mK. The $\mu$SR relaxation rate exhibits a temperature-independent
plateau below 4 K, indicating a dynamic ground state of fluctuating spins
similar to the well-known spin ice system Dy$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$O$_{7}$. The
low-temperature spin fluctuations persist in the longitudinal field of 20 kOe
as well and show unusual field dependence of the relaxation rate, which is
uncommon for a spin-liquid system. Our results, combined with the previous
studies do not show any evidence of spin ice or spin glass ground state, rather
point to a disorder-induced dynamic magnetic ground state in the
Dy$_{2}$Zr$_{2}$O$_{7}$ material.

<h3>Odd symmetry planar Hall effect: A method of detecting current-induced  in-plane magnetization switching</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14431" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14431</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Type-x device attracts considerable interest in the field of spintronics due
to its robust spin-orbit torque (SOT) induced magnetization switching, and easy
deposition technique. However, universally applicable and straightforward
detection of type-X magnetization reversal is still elusive, unlike type-Z
switching, which employs DC-based anomalous Hall effect measurement. Here, we,
demonstrated that the odd planar Hall signal (O-PHV) exhibits an odd symmetry
with the application of an external magnetic field which motivates us to
develop a reading mechanism for detecting magnetization switching of in-plane
magnetized type-X devices. We verified our DC-based reading mechanism in the
Pt/Co/NiFe/Pt stack where a thin Co layer is inserted to create dissimilar
interfaces about the NiFe layer. Remarkably, the current-induced in-plane
fields are found to be significantly large in Pt/Co/NiFe/Pt stack. Further, we
successfully employed the O-PHV method to detect the current-induced
magnetization switching. The pure DC nature of the writing and reading
mechanism of our proposed type-X detection technique through O-PHV makes it the
easiest in-plane magnetization detection technique. Moreover, the high
repeatability and easy detection of our proposed method will open new avenues
toward in-plane SOT switching based memory devices and sensors.

<h3>Heat flux for semi-local machine-learning potentials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14434" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14434</a>

<i>Marcel F. Langer, Florian Knoop, Christian Carbogno, Matthias Scheffler, Matthias Rupp</i>
<br>
<br>
The Green-Kubo (GK) method is a rigorous framework for heat transport
simulations in materials. However, it requires an accurate description of the
potential-energy surface and carefully converged statistics. Machine-learning
potentials can achieve the accuracy of first-principles simulations while
allowing to reach well beyond their simulation time and length scales at a
fraction of the cost. In this paper, we explain how to apply the GK approach to
the recent class of message-passing machine-learning potentials, which
iteratively consider semi-local interactions beyond the initial interaction
cutoff. We derive an adapted heat flux formulation that can be implemented
using automatic differentiation without compromising computational efficiency.
The approach is demonstrated and validated by calculating the thermal
conductivity of zirconium dioxide across temperatures.

Ordered intermetallics are long believed to be the final products of the
aging of U-Nb solid solutions at low temperatures, a crucial property for the
practical applications of this alloy in engineering and industry. However, such
conjectured ordered compounds have not been experimentally or theoretically
established. Herein, numerical evidence for ordered intermetallic U-Nb
compounds is presented using thorough first-principles structure predictions up
to 500 GPa. Two stable U2Nb compounds and one metastable U2Nb and one
metastable U3Nb were discovered. A unique hybridized transition driven by
pressure was observed in U2Nb, which is a superposition of one first-order
transition and another second-order transition, leading to striking features
near the transition pressure of 21.6 GPa. The decomposition limit of these
compounds at high temperature was also investigated. The strong stability of
U2Nb in the region of low pressure and high temperature was revealed. This
discovery of ordered U2Nb and its strong stability over a wide pressure range
completely changed the phase diagram of U-Nb alloys and shed new light on the
dynamic response and aging mechanism of U-Nb alloys.

We provide a microscopic approach to describe the onset of radial oscillation
of a silver nanoparticle. Using the Heisenberg equation of motion framework, we
find that the coupled ultrafast dynamics of coherently excited electron
occupation and the coherent phonon amplitude initiate periodic size
oscillations of the nanoparticle. Compared to the established interpretation of
experiments, our results show a more direct coupling mechanism between the
field intensity and coherent phonons. This interaction triggers a size
oscillation via an optically induced electron density gradient occurring
directly with the optical excitation. This source is more efficient than the
incoherent heating process currently discussed in the literature and
well-describes the early onset of the oscillations in recent experiments.

Novel "quasi two dimensional" typically layered (semi) metals offer a unique
opportunity to control the density and even the topology of the electronic
matter. Along with doping and gate voltage, a robust tuning is achieved by
application of the hydrostatic pressure. In Weyl semi - metals the tilt of the
dispersion relation cones, k , increases with pressure, so that one is able to
reach type II k > 1 starting from the more conventional type I Weyl semi -
metals k < 1. The microscopic theory of such a transition is constructed. It is
found that upon increasing pressure the I to II transition occurs in two
continuous steps. In the first step the cones of opposite chirality coalesce so
that the chiral symmetry is restored, while the second transition to the Fermi
surface extending throughout the Brillouin zone occurs at higher pressures.
Flattening of the band leads to profound changes in Coulomb screening.
Superconductivity observed recently in wide range of pressure and chemical
composition in Weyl semi-metals of both types. The phonon theory of pairing
including the Coulomb repulsion for a layered material is constructed and
applied to recent extensive experiments on HfTe5.

Symmetry-adapted distortion modes provide a natural way to describe distorted
structures derived from higher-symmetry parent phases. Structural refinements
using symmetry-mode amplitudes as fit variables have been used for at least 10
years in Rietveld refinements of the average crystal structure from diffraction
data; more recently, this approach has also been used for investigations of the
local structure using real-space pair distribution function (PDF) data. Here,
we further demonstrate the value of performing symmetry-mode fits to PDF data
through the successful application of this method to two topical materials:
TiSe$_2$, where we detect the subtle but long-range structural distortion
driven by the formation of a charge density wave, and MnTe, where we
characterize a large but highly localized structural distortion in terms of
symmetry-lowering displacements of the Te atoms. The analysis is performed
using fully open-source code within the DiffPy framework using two packages we
developed for this work: pydistort, which provides a scriptable interface to
the ISODISTORT web application for group theoretical calculations, and
isotools, which converts the ISODISTORT output into a DiffPy-compatible format
for subsequent fitting and analysis. These developments expand the potential
impact of symmetry-adapted PDF analysis by enabling high throughput analysis
and removing the need for any commercial software.

Quenched disorder is known to lead to peculiar dynamical phases including
trapping behavior in active matter. We construct a minimal model for a
collection of active Brownian particles (ABPs) having soft repulsive
interactions on a chemically patterned substrate that serves as a disorder.
Using numerical simulations, we vary the strength of the chemical potential
spatially for a range of self-propulsion speeds of the Brownian particles for
the proposed variant of the Keller-Segel model. The interplay between
chemo-phoretic interactions and activity results in a chemo-motility-induced
phase-separated state and a new cohesive phase having synchronized rotations,
amongst two other dynamically almost frozen phases. We show that rotational
order can emerge in systems by virtue of activity and repulsive interactions
alone without the need to explicitly model alignment interactions.

used pho-tovoltaic (PV) panels will be a serious environmental challenge in the
future dec-ades since the solar panels would eventually become a source of
hazardous waste. The potential of waste solar panel glass to generate porous
glass material with the addition of CaCO3 and water glass was assessed in this
study. The porous glass firing temperature range, from 830{\deg}C - 910{\deg}C,
was determined using a simu-lation of heating microscope technique. The created
samples have the smallest volumetric density of 0.25 g/cm3 and the largest
water absorption of 303.08 wt.%. This indicates that the image analysis of
samples during the heating process could be used to identify the firing
temperature for better foaming, which was favorably indicated by specific
physicochemical parameters. The created glass-foam mate-rials with an apparent
porosity up to 81.49% could be used as a water-retaining medium in hydroponic

Recent experimental discoveries of novel nematic types with polar order,
including ferroelectric nematic and splay nematic have brought the resurgence
of the interest in polar and modulated phases with a non-standard symmetry. One
of the most important factors that is widely believed to be crucial for the
formation of the new phases is the wedge (pearlike) shape of the mesogenic
molecules. Such shapes were treated using second-virial density functional
theory in [De Gregorio, P et al., Soft Matter, 2016, 12(23), 5188-5198], where
the authors showed that the $K_{11}$ splay elastic constant can become negative
due to solely entropic reasons leading to long-range splay and polar
correlations. To verify whether the predictions are correct, we performed Monte
Carlo simulations of the same hard-core particles used in the DFT study. As our
results suggest, no nonstandard liquid crystalline phases emerge; polar and
splay correlations are at most short-range or completely absent. On the other
hand, a polar ferroelectric crystal was observed. The system was analyzed in
terms of nematic, smectic, and hexatic bond order parameters, as well as
correlation functions. We also propose the possible reasons for failed
predictions of DFT computations, where the most probable one is the absence of
the density modulation in the theoretical model.

The helicity of 3D topological insulator surface states has drawn significant
attention in spintronics owing to spin-momentum locking where the carriers'
spin is oriented perpendicular to their momentum. This property can provide an
efficient method to convert charge currents into spin currents, and vice-versa,
through the Rashba-Edelstein effect. However, experimental signatures of these
surface states to the spin-charge conversion are extremely difficult to
disentangle from bulk state contributions. Here, we combine spin- and
angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy, and time-resolved THz emission
spectroscopy to categorically demonstrate that spin-charge conversion arises
mainly from the surface state in Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ ultrathin films, down to few
nanometers where confinement effects emerge. We correlate this large conversion
efficiency, typically at the level of the bulk spin Hall effect from heavy
metals, to the complex Fermi surface obtained from theoretical calculations of
the inverse Rashba-Edelstein response. %We demonstrate this for film thickness
down to a few nanometers, Both surface state robustness and sizeable conversion
efficiency in epitaxial Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ thin films bring new perspectives for
ultra-low power magnetic random-access memories and broadband THz generation.

The opacity of graphene is known to be approximately given by the fine
structure constant $\alpha$ times $\pi$. We point out the fact that the opacity
is roughly independent of the frequency of the light can be attributed to the
topological charge of the Dirac point. As a result, one can literally see the
topological charge by naked eyes from the opacity of graphene, and moreover it
implies that the fine structure constant is topologically protected. A similar
analysis applied to 3D topological insulators suggests that their opacity in
the infrared region is also given by $\pi\alpha$, which may be seen by naked
eyes through an infrared lens, and ideally is independent of the thickness of
the material since it is contributed solely from the topological surface
states. For 3D Dirac or Weyl semimetals, the optical absorption power is linear
to the frequency in the infrared region, with a linearity given by the fine
structure constant and the topological charge of Weyl points.

Traditional catalysis theory claims that catalysts speed up reactions by
introducing low activation barriers and cannot alter the thermodynamic
spontaneous reaction direction. However, if environments change rapidly,
catalysts can be driven away from stationary states and exhibit anomalous
performance. We present a geometric non-equilibrium theory and a
control-conjugate landscape to describe and explain anomalous catalytic
behaviors in rapidly oscillatory environments. Moreover, we derive a universal
design principle for engineering optimal catalytic energy landscapes to achieve
desired anomalous catalyst behaviors. Applications include but are not limited
to (1) inverting a spontaneous reaction to synthesize high-free-energy
molecules, and (2) dissipatively speeding up reactions without lowering
activation barriers. In both cases, catalysts autonomously harness energy from
non-equilibrium environments to enable such functionalities.

The century-long development of surface sciences has witnessed the
discoveries of a variety of quantum states. In the recently proposed
"obstructed atomic insulators", insulators with symmetric charges pinned at
virtual sites where no real atoms reside, the cleavage through these sites
could lead to a set of obstructed surface states with partial occupation. Here,
utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy, angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we observe spectroscopic
signature of obstructed surface states in SrIn$_2$P$_2$. We find a pair of
surface states originated from the pristine obstructed surface states split by
a unique surface reconstruction. The upper branch is marked with a striking
differential conductance peak followed by negative differential conductance,
signaling its localized nature, while the lower branch is found to be highly
dispersive. This pair of surface states is in consistency with our
calculational results. Our finding not only demonstrates a surface quantum
state induced by a new type of bulk-boundary correspondence, but also provides
a platform for exploring efficient catalysts and related surface engineering.

Anisotropic magnetic interactions become the origins of intriguing magnetic
structures, such as helical and skyrmion structures by the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. In general, possible anisotropic exchange
interactions are restricted by crystal symmetry. Meanwhile, by lowering the
crystal symmetry with light, additional anisotropic magnetic interactions are
expected according to its polarization and frequency. In this study, we clarify
a relationship between anisotropic magnetic interactions and symmetry lowering
in insulating magnets irradiated by light. Based on the Floquet formalism, we
find that a variety of anisotropic two-spin and three-spin interactions are
induced via spin-dependent electric polarizations activated by light
irrespective of the presence/absence of the spatial inversion symmetry; we
systematically classify them in the hexagonal point group, tetragonal point
group, and their subgroups. Our symmetry analyses show that the light-induced
two-spin (three-spin) interaction is owing to the reduction of the point group
to a chiral point group (black and white magnetic point group). We also
demonstrate the effect of the light-induced magnetic interactions on the
magnetic structures in a triangular unit. Our results will be a symmetry-based
reference for the Floquet engineering of magnetic structures.

Using first-principles calculations, we have investigated
temperature-dependent phonon properties in tetragonal SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and
orthorhombic SrZrO$_3$ (SZO) perovskites. Within the quasiharmonic
approximation, we have calculated the mode Gr\"uneisen parameters, thermal
expansion, and frequency shifts for several optical modes. These shifts show a
downward trend with increasing temperature for almost all the modes in both
systems and thus add to the normal behavior of frequencies with temperature.
Next, within the third-order lattice anharmonic effect, we have investigated
the temperature dependence of linewidths and lineshifts for several phonon
modes. Except for a few modes, the lineshifts for most of the modes also show a
downward trend with temperature and thus further leading to the normal
temperature-dependent behavior of phonon modes. However, these lineshifts for a
few optical modes in both the systems show an upward trend with increasing
temperature, which, in principle, could lead to the anomalous
temperature-dependent behavior of the frequencies of these modes; but when we
add all the corrections including the quasiharmonic and third-order anharmonic
shifts to the frequencies as obtained within the harmonic approximation, the
frequencies of almost all the modes behave normally with temperature, i.e. they
display blue shifts with cooling.

In the lyotropic phase of lipids with excess water, multilamellar tubules
(MLTs) grow from defects. A phenomenological model for the stability of MLTs is
developed that is universal and independent of the underlying growth mechanisms
of MLTs. The stability of MLTs implies that they are in hydrostatic equilibrium
and stable as elastic objects that have compression and bending elasticity. The
results show that even with 0.1 atm solvent pressure differences, the density
profile is not significantly altered, thus determining that the stability is
due to the trapped solvent. The results are of sufficient value in relation to
lamellar stability models and may have implications beyond the described MLT
models, especially in other models of membrane systems.

The topological magneto-electric effect (TME) is a characteristic property of

electronic structure model to theoretically evaluate the THz and far infrared
Kerr and Faraday responses of thin films of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ with up to $N=10$
septuple layers with the goal of clarifying the relationship between these
convenient magneto-optical observable and the TME. We find that for even $N$
the linear Kerr and Faraday responses to an electric field vanish in the
low-frequency limit, even though the the magnetoelectric response is large and
approximately quantized.

Any system with internal correlations (e.g., interactions), such as spin
glasses, random media, and brains, can be studied as a network where nodes are
elements and edges denote correlated interactions. As internal correlations
increase, correlated behaviours originate and propagate among elements to
create percolation phenomena. In this work, we study percolation in correlated
systems by proposing a framework referred to as the non-isomorphic
decomposition analysis. This framework analyzes the evolution of the space of
non-isomorphic percolation configuration classes governed by internal
correlations, where a metric called as the automorphism entropy is proposed to
measure the reduction of information (i.e., freedom degrees) in the space. A
special case of our theory under the mean-field approximation is elaborated,
where all concepts can be explicitly calculated based on group theory and
percolation theory. Our framework has been applied to studying absorbing phase
transition, spreading process, and synchronization, whose results reveal the
shared properties of percolation and dynamics in different correlated systems.
First, the percolation process driven by internal correlations is intrinsically
an information loss process in the probability space of non-isomorphic
percolation configuration classes. The metric of information loss degree,
automorphism entropy, serves as a sensitive indicator of percolation transition
and related processes in diverse systems. Second, the information loss
intensity depends on the strength of internal correlations. Sufficiently strong
correlations ensure slight information losses and make specific freedom degrees
omissible, which supports the implementation of renormalization groups.
Sufficiently weak correlations, on the contrary, imply significant information
losses and make renormalization groups less effective for the correlated
system.

The present era has seen tremendous demands for low-cost electrochromic
materials for visible-region multicolor display technology, paper-based,

devices fabricated on rigid to flexible ITO substrates comprising novel
anthracene containing viologen,
(1,1'-bis(anthracen-9-ylmethyl)-[4,4'-bipyridine]-1,1'-diium bromide,
abbreviated as AnV2+), and polythiophene (P3HT). Inter-estingly, the devices
show three states of reversible visible color in response to the applied bias,
sub-second to second switching time (0.7 s/1.6 s), and high coloration
efficiency (484 cm2/C), longer cycling stability up to 3000 s (103 switching
cycles). Thanks to the anthracenes moieties introduced to viologen that inhibit
formation of undesired dimer of cation radicals formed in response to the
applied bias, other-wise it would hamper the devices reconfiguration. The
devices are fully characterized, and electrochromic performances are ensured by
bias-dependent UV-Vis, and Raman spectroscopy. The fabricated electro-chromic
devices are tested with the commercially available low-cost cells to perform,
which is highly de-sired for practical applications. The computational study
facilitates the understanding of experimental re-sults. The alternating current
(AC)-based electrical impedance spectroscopy reveals that P3HT facilitates
reducing charge transfer resistance of the devices. Our work shows CMOS
compatibility and one of the best-performing devices that could pave the way
for developing cost-effective flexible, and wearable electrochromic devices.

We propose a Monte Carlo simulation to understand electron transport in a
non-equilibrium steady state (\textit{NESS}) for the lattice Coulomb Glass
model, created by continuous excitation of single electrons to high energies
followed by relaxation of the system. Around the Fermi level, the \textit{NESS}
state approximately obeys the Fermi-Dirac statistics, with an effective
temperature ($T_{eff}$) greater than the system's bath temperature ($T$).
$T_{eff}$ is a function of $T$ and the rate of photon absorption by the system.
Furthermore, we find that the change in conductivity is only a function of
relaxation times and is almost independent of the bath temperature. Our results
indicate that the conductivity of the \textit{NESS} state can still be
characterized by the Efros-Shklovskii law with an effective temperature
$T_{eff}>T$. Additionally, the dominance of phonon-less hopping over
phonon-assisted hopping is used to explain the relevance of the hot-electron
model to the conductivity of the \textit{NESS} state.

We present a study on the magnetic behavior of dextran-coated magnetite
nanoparticles (DM NPs) with sizes between 3 and 19 nm, synthesized by
hydrothermal-assisted co-precipitation method. The decrease of saturation
magnetization ($M_s$) with decreasing particle size has been modeled by
assuming the existence of a spin-disordered layer at the particle surface,
which is magnetically dead. Based on this core-shell model and taking into
account the weight contribution of the non-magnetic coating layer (dextran) to
the whole magnetization, the dead layer thickness ($t$) and saturation
magnetization $M_s$ of the magnetic cores in our samples were estimated to be
$t = 6.8~\mathrm{\AA}$ and $M_s = 98.8~\mathrm{emu/g}$, respectively. The data
of $M_s$ were analyzed using a law of approach to saturation, indicating an
increase in effective magnetic anisotropy ($K_{eff}$) with decreasing particle
size as expected from the increased surface/volume ratio in small MNPs. The
obtained $K_{eff}$ values were successfully modeled by including an extra
contribution of dipolar interactions due to the formation of chain-like
clusters of MNPs. The surface magnetic anisotropy ($K_s$) was estimated to be
about $K_s = 1.04\times10^5~\mathrm{J/m^3}$. Our method provides a simple and
accurate way to obtain the $M_s$ core values in surface-disordered MNPs, a
relevant parameter required for magnetic modeling in many applications.

The edge state of the topological insulator coupled to a superconductor
system is able to simulate the Majorana fermion in zero energy mode since the
Kitaev-type pairing is induced by exchanging quasi-excitations in electron
tunneling. However, the present study has revealed that this physical
simulation is not valid for a larger surface gap, which is the energy gap of
the insulator's surface states. To address this issue, a refined pairing term
that depends on the surface gap has been obtained as a second-order effect of
the proximity effect, whereas the lowest order produces a constant pairing
strength. By carefully considering the dependence of pairing strength on the
surface gap, the Majorana phase diagram is re-achieved and a significant
difference from previous work is observed, where the pairing strength was
assumed to be independent of the surface gap and resulted in a conical phase
boundary.

line parallel to the square diagonal were rigorously proven to follow the
Tracy-Widom distribution. We provide strong numerical evidence that this is
true also for other values of the anisotropy parameter $\Delta$ ($0\leq \Delta

Superconductivity remains one of most fascinating quantum phenomena existing
on a macroscopic scale. Its rich phenomenology is usually described by the
Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory in terms of the order parameter, representing the
macroscopic wave function of the superconducting condensate. The GL theory
addresses one of the prime superconducting properties, screening of the
electromagnetic field because it becomes massive within a superconductor, the
famous Anderson-Higgs mechanism. Here we describe another widely-spread type of
superconductivity where the Anderson-Higgs mechanism does not work and must be
replaced by the Deser-Jackiw-Templeton topological mass generation and,
correspondingly, the GL effective field theory must be replaced by an effective
topological gauge theory. These superconductors are inherently inhomogeneous
granular superconductors, where electronic granularity is either fundamental or
emerging. We show that the corresponding superconducting transition is a
three-dimensional (3D) generalization of the 2D Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
(BKT) vortex binding-unbinding transition. The binding-unbinding of the
line-like vortices in 3D results in the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT) scaling of
the resistance near the superconducting transition. We report experimental data
fully confirming the VFT behavior of the resistance.

<br>
We theoretically propose that the monolayer V$_2 MX_4$ ($M=$ W, Mo; $X=$ S,
Se) is a new family of quantum anomalous Hall insulators with sizable bulk gap
and Chern number $\mathcal{C}=-1$. The interplay between topology and magnetism
in this class of compounds are from $d$-orbitals of both V and $M$. We
construct the tight-binding model from orbital projected band structure and
symmetry analysis to uncover the origin of topology. Remarkably, the topology
is not only from the spin polarized quadratic band touching of degenerate
$d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals of V guaranteed by $C_{4z}$ symmetry, but also
the band inversion between $d_{xz},d_{yz}$ orbitals of V and $d_{z^2}$ of $M$
at Fermi level, which is further gapped by spin-orbit coupling. This results in
the Chern band lying far below Fermi energy. Furthermore, the thickness
dependence of the Chern number for few multilayers shows interesting
oscillating behavior. The general physics from the $d$-orbitals here applies to
a large class of ternary transition metal chalcogenide such as Ti$_2$W$X_4$
with the space group $P$-$42m$.

<br>
<br>
We show the first experimental demonstration of room-temperature
exciton-polariton (EP) condensation from a bound state in the continuum (BIC).
This demonstration is achieved by strongly coupling stable excitons in an
organic perylene dye with the extremely long-lived BIC in a dielectric
metasurface of silicon nanoparticles. The long lifetime of the BIC, mainly due
to the suppression of radiation leakage, allows for EP thermalization to the
ground state before decaying. This property results in a condensation threshold
of less than 5 \mu J cm^{-2}, one order of magnitude lower that the lasing
threshold reported in similar systems in the weak coupling limit.

The critical step in a molecular process is often a rare-event and has to be
simulated by an enhanced sampling protocol. Recovering accurate dynamical
estimates from such biased simulation is challenging. Girsanov reweighting is a
method to reweight dynamic properties formulated as path expected values. The
path probability is calculated at the time-step resolution of the
molecular-dynamics integrator. But the theory is largely limited to overdamped
Langevin dynamics. For underdamped Langevin dynamics, the absolute continuity
of the path probability ratio for the biased and unbiased potential is not
guaranteed, but it depends on the Langevin integrator. We develop a general
approach to derive the path probability ratio for Langevin integrators and to
analyze whether absolute continuity is fulfilled. We demonstrate our approach
on symmetric splitting methods for underdamped Langevin dynamics. For methods
that obey absolute continuity, and thus can be used for Girsanov reweighting,
we provide an expression for the relative path probability. %

Self-propelled Janus particles exhibit autonomous motion thanks to engines of
their own. However, due to randomly changing direction of such motion they are
of little use for emerging nano-technological and bio-medical applications.
Here, we numerically show that the motion of chiral active Janus can be
directed subjecting them to a linear array of convection rolls. Rectification
power of self-propulsion motion here can be made more than 60% which is much
larger than earlier reports. We show that rectification of chiral Janus
particle's motion leads to conspicuous segregation of dextrogyre and levogyre
active particles from a racemic binary mixture. Further, we demonstrate how
efficiently the rectification effect can be exploited to separate dextrogyre
and levogyre particles when their intrinsic torques are distributed with
Gaussian statistics.

<h3>Domain statistics in the relaxation of the one-dimensional Ising model  with strong long-range interactions</h3>

<br>
<i>Federico Corberi, Manoj Kumar, Eugenio Lippiello, Paolo Politi</i>
<br>
<br>
After a zero temperature quench, we study the kinetics of the one-dimensional
Ising model with long-range interactions between spins at distance $r$ decaying
as $r^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha \le 1$. As shown in our recent study [SciPost
Phys 10, 109 (2021)] that only a fraction of the non-equilibrium trajectories
is characterized by the presence of coarsening domains while in the remaining
ones the system is quickly driven towards a magnetised state. Restricting to
realisations displaying coarsening we compute numerically the probability
distribution of the size of the domains and find that it exhibits a scaling
behaviour with an unusual $\alpha$-dependent power-law decay. This peculiar
behaviour is also related to the divergence of the average size of domains with
system size at finite times. Such a scenario differs from the one observed when
$\alpha>1$, where the distribution decays exponentially. Finally, based on
numerical results and on analytical calculations we argue that the average
domain size grows asymptotically linearly in time.

<h3>Robust superconducting correlation against inter-site interactions in  the extended two-leg Hubbard ladder</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Hubbard and related models serve as a fundamental starting point in
understanding the novel experimental phenomena in correlated electron
materials, such as superconductivity, Mott insulator, magnetism and stripe
phases. Recent numerical simulations indicate that the emergence of
superconductivity is connected with the next nearest-neighbor hopping
$t^\prime$ in the Hubbard model. However, the impacts of complex inter-site
electron interaction in the $t^\prime$-Hubbard model are less explored.
Utilizing the state-of-art density-matrix renormalization group method, we
investigate the $t^\prime$-Hubbard model on a two-leg ladder with inter-site
interactions extended to the fourth neighbor sites. The accurate numerical
results show that the quasi-long-range superconducting correlation remains
stable under the repulsive nearest-neighbor and the next nearest-neighbor
interactions though these interactions are against the superconductivity. The
ground state properties are also undisturbed by the longer-range repulsive
interactions. In addition, inspired by recent experiments on one-dimensional
cuprates chain $\mathrm{Ba}_{2-x}\mathrm{Sr}_x\mathrm{CuO}_{3+\delta}$, which
implies an effective attraction between the nearest neighbors may exist in the
cuprates superconductors, we also show that the attractive interaction between
the nearest neighbors significantly enhances the superconducting correlation
when it is comparable to the strength of the nearest-neighbor hopping
$t^\prime$. Stronger attraction drives the system into a Luther-Emery liquid
phase. Nevertheless, with the attraction further increasing, the system enters
an electron-hole phase separation and the superconducting correlation is
destroyed. Finally, we investigate the effects of on-site Coulomb interaction
on superconductivity.

This paper begins with a summary of a powerful formalism for the study of
electronic states in condensed matter physics called "Gauge Theory of
States/Phases of Matter." The chiral anomaly, which plays quite a prominent
role in that formalism, is recalled. I then sketch an application of the chiral
anomaly in 1+1 dimensions to quantum wires. Subsequently, some elements of the
quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional (2D) gapped ("incompressible") electron
liquids are reviewed. In particular, I discuss the role of anomalous chiral
edge currents and of anomaly inflow in 2D gapped electron liquids with
explicitly or spontaneously broken time reversal, i.e., in Hall- and Chern
insulators. The topological Chern-Simons action yielding the transport
equations valid in the bulk of such systems and the associated anomalous edge
action are derived. The results of a general classification of "abelian" Hall
insulators are outlined. After some remarks on induced Chern-Simons actions, I
sketch results on certain 2D chiral photonic wave guides. I then continue with
an analysis of chiral edge spin-currents and the bulk response equations in
time-reversal invariant 2D topological insulators of electron gases with
spin-orbit interactions. The "chiral magnetic effect" in 3D systems and
axion-electrodynamics are reviewed next. This prepares the ground for an
outline of a general theory of 3D topological insulators, including "axionic
insulators". Some remarks on Weyl semi-metals, which exhibit the chiral
magnetic effect, and on Mott transitions in 3D systems with dynamical
axion-like degrees of freedom conclude this review.}

Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are rubber-like solids that incorporate
nematic mesogens (stiff rod-like molecules) as a part of their polymer chains.
In recent years, isotropic-genesis, polydomain liquid crystal elastomers
(I-PLCEs) has been a topic of both scientific and technological interest due to
their intriguing properties such as soft behavior, ability to dissipate energy
and stimuli response, as well as the ease with which they can be synthesized.
We present a macroscopic or engineering scale constitutive model of the
behavior of I-PLCEs. The model implicitly accounts for the complex evolution of
the domain patterns and is able to faithfully capture the experimentally
observed complex response to multi-axial loading. We describe a multiscale
framework that motivates the model, explore various aspects of the model,
validate it against experiments, and finally verify and demonstrate a numerical
implementation.

<h3>Anomalous open orbits in Hofstadter spectrum of Chern insulator</h3>

<br>
<br>
The nontrivial band topology can influence the Hofstadter spectrum. We
investigate the Hofstadter spectrum for various models of Chern insulators
under a rational flux $\frac{\phi_{0}}{q}$, here $\phi_{0}=\frac{h}{e}$ and $q$
being an integer. We find two major features. First, the number of splitting
subbands is $|q-C|$ with Chern number $C$. Second, the anomalous open-orbit
subbands with Chern numbers $q-1$ and $-q-1$ emerge, which are beyond the
parameter window $(-q/2,q/2)$ of the Diophantine equation studied by
Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-den Nijs [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{49}, 405
(1982)]. These two findings are explained by semiclassical dynamics. We propose
that the number of splitting subbands can be utilized to determine Chern number
in cold atom systems, and the open-orbit subbands can provide routes to study
exotic features beyond the Landau level physics.

<h3>Optical Control Of Mass Ejection From Ferroelectric Liquid Droplets: A  Possible Tool For The Actuation Of Complex Fluids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14798" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14798</a>

<br>
<br>
We report on the optical control of the recently observed electromechanical
instability of ferroelectric liquid droplets exposed to the photovoltaic field
of a lithium niobate ferroelectric crystal substrate. The ferroelectric liquid
is a nematic liquid crystal in which almost complete polar ordering of the
molecular dipoles generates an internal macroscopic polarization locally
collinear to the mean molecular long axis. Upon entering the ferroelectric
phase, droplets irradiated by unfocused beam undergo an electromechanical
instability and disintegrate by the explosive emission of fluid jets. We show
here that the regions of jets emission can be controlled by focusing the light
beam in areas close to the droplet's edge. Once emitted, the fluid jets can be
walked by moving the beam up to millimeter distance from the mother droplet.
Reverting the lithium niobate substrate, jets become thinner and show the
tendency of being repelled by the beam instead of being attracted, thus
offering an additional tool for their optical manipulation. These observations
may pave the way to intriguing applications of ferroelectric nematic fluids
related to manipulation, actuation, and control of soft, flexible materials.

<h3>Many-body effects in the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a composite  bosonic Josephson junction</h3>

<br>
<br>
The out-of-equilibrium many-body quantum dynamics of an interacting Bose gas
trapped in a one-dimensional composite double-well potential is studied by
solving the many-body Schr\"odinger equation numerically accurately by
employing the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons (MCTDHB)
method. The composite double-well is formed by merging two deformed harmonic
wells having a hump at their centre. We characterised the dynamics by the time
evolution of survival probability, fragmentation, and many-particle position
and momentum variances. Our study demonstrates the prominent role played by the
higher orbitals in the dynamics and thereby highlighted the necessity of a
many-body technique like MCTDHB which can take into account all the relevant
orbitals for the accurate description of complex many-body dynamics. Further,
we showed that the universality of fragmentation with respect to the number of
particles corresponding to a particular interaction strength is also exhibited
by the higher-order orbitals. Therefore, it is a robust phenomenon not limited
to systems that can be described by two orbitals only.

<h3>Strong lateral exchange coupling and current-induced switching in  single-layer ferrimagnetic films with patterned compensation temperature</h3>

Strong, adjustable magnetic couplings are of great importance to all devices
based on magnetic materials. Controlling the coupling between adjacent regions
of a single magnetic layer, however, is challenging. In this work, we
demonstrate strong exchange-based coupling between arbitrarily shaped regions
of a single ferrimagnetic layer. This is achieved by spatially patterning the
compensation temperature of the ferrimagnet by either oxidation or He+
irradiation. The coupling originates at the lateral interface between regions
with different compensation temperature and scales inversely with their width.
We show that this coupling generates large lateral exchange coupling fields and
we demonstrate its application to control the switching of magnetically
compensated dots with an electric current.

<h3>Microscopic study of the Josephson supercurrent diode effect in  2DEG-based Josephson junctions</h3>

Superconducting systems that simultaneously lack space-inversion and
time-reversal symmetries have recently been the subject of a flurry of
experimental and theoretical research activities. Their ability to carry
supercurrents with magnitudes depending on the polarity (current direction) -
termed supercurrent diode effect - might be practically exploited to design
dissipationless counterparts of contemporary semiconductor-based diodes.
Magnetic Josephson junctions realized in the two-dimensional electron gas
(2DEG) within a narrow quantum well through proximity to conventional
superconductors perhaps belong to the most striking and versatile platforms for
such supercurrent rectifiers. Starting from the Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach,
we provide a minimal theoretical model to explore the impact of the spin-orbit
coupling and magnetic exchange inside the 2DEG on the Andreev bound states and
Josephson current-phase relations. Assuming realistic junction parameters, we
evaluate the polarity-dependent critical currents to quantify the efficiency of
these Josephson junctions as supercurrent diodes, and discuss the tunability of
the Josephson supercurrent diode effect in terms of spin-orbit coupling,
magnetic exchange, and transparency of the nonsuperconducting weak link.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the junctions might undergo current-reversing
$ 0 $-$ \pi $-like phase transitions at large enough magnetic exchange, which
appear as sharp peaks followed by a sudden suppression in the
supercurrent-diode-effect efficiency. The characteristics of the Josephson
supercurrent diode effect obtained from our model convincingly reproduce many
unique features observed in recent experiments, validating its robustness and
suitability for further studies.

Many-body localization (MBL) features long-time persistence of
charge-density-like waves (CDWs) of local observables. Is it practical to
commence from a modulated state pattern also for nonlocal quantum entanglement?
Will such entanglement analogs of CDWs survive still in MBL? From a constituent
viewpoint, a great deal of MBL is learnt from 1D spin or fermion systems where
carriers are scatter particles. What about the situation when multiple
interacting particles cluster in a random-potential background? To tackle these
questions, we study symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy in disordered
Bose-Hubbard (dBH) chain using numerical quantum quench dynamics. We
concentrate on 2 types of inhomogeneous initial states after mapping out the
energy-resolved dynamical phase diagram of the model. From time-evolving a
line-shape initial product state, we find the sudden formation of robust
entropy imbalance across different symmetry sectors, termed
entanglement-channel wave (ECW). Intriguingly, ECW melts in MBL under
strong-disorder limit. It is tempting to conjecture that melting of ECW and
freezing of CDW are duo traits inherent to disorder-induced MBL. Further, by
exploiting dynamical consequences of loading bosons onto one site, we find the
possibility to realize an interaction-facilitated cluster localization unique
to BH-type models at weak disorders. Together, the unraveled rich entanglement
dynamics manifests the intrinsic complexity of dBH model from a jointly energy-
and symmetry-resolved perspective.

Strontium titanate SrTiO$_3$ is one of the most studied and paradigmatic
transition metal oxides. Recently, a breakthrough has been achieved with the
fabrication of freestanding SrTiO$_3$ ultrathin films down to the monolayer
limit. However, the many-body effects on the quasiparticle and optical
properties of monolayer SrTiO$_3$ remain unexplored. Using state-of-the-art
many-body perturbation theory in the GW approximation combined with the
Bethe-Salpeter equation, we study the quasiparticle band structure, optical and
excitonic properties of monolayer SrTiO$_3$. We show that quasiparticle
corrections significantly alter the band structure topology; however, the
widely used diagonal $G_0W_0$ approach yields unphysical band dispersions. The
correct band dispersions are restored only by taking into account the
off-diagonal elements of the self-energy. The optical properties are studied
both in the optical limit and for finite momenta by computing the electron
energy loss spectra. We find that the imaginary part of dielectric function at
the long wavelength limit is dominated by three strongly bound excitonic peaks
and the direct optical gap is associated to a bright exciton state with a large
binding energy of 0.93 eV. We discuss the character of the excitonic peaks via
the contributing interband transitions, and reveal that the lowest bound
excitonic state becomes optical inactive for finite momenta along $\Gamma$-M,
while the other two excitonic peaks disperse to higher energies and eventually
merge for momenta close to M.

<br>
Multiple systems hosting Andreev molecular states have been proposed and
studied, consisting of closely spaced Josephson junctions modeled as ballistic
channels. We show that replacing the ballistic channels in the weak link of the
Josephson junctions with quantum dots (QD), leads to a very exciting, rich
phase diagram. It shows a strong nonlocal Josephson effect: as one junction is
tuned the current-phase relation of the other junction is modified. This
architecture hosts $0 - \pi$ transitions and shows a tunable anomalous
phase-shift $\phi_0$ , nonlocally controlled in both cases, without relying on
spin-orbit interaction or Zeeman fields. In addition significant
superconducting diode effect can also be observed. The presented non-local
current-phase relation can be used as a signature of the formation of an
Andreev molecular state, as well as to introduce new ways to tune quantum
architectures.

<h3>Compact localised states in magnonic Lieb lattices</h3>

<br>
<br>
Lieb lattice is one of the simplest bipartite lattices where compact
localized states (CLS) are observed. This type of localisation is induced by
the peculiar topology of the unit cell, where the modes are localized only on
one sublattice due to the destructive interference of partial waves. The CLS
exist in the absence of defects and are associated with the flat bands in the
dispersion relation. The Lieb lattices were successfully implemented as optical
lattices or photonic crystals. This work demonstrates the possibility of
magnonic Lieb lattice realization where the flat bands and CLS can be observed
in the planar structure of sub-micron in-plane sizes. Using forward volume
configuration, we investigated numerically (using the finite element method)
the Ga-dopped YIG layer with cylindrical inclusions (without Ga content)
arranged in a Lieb lattice of the period 250 nm. We tailored the structure to
observe, for the few lowest magnonic bands, the oscillatory and evanescent spin
waves in inclusions and matrix, respectively. Such a design reproduces the Lieb
lattice of nodes (inclusions) coupled to each other by the matrix with the CLS
in flat bands.

<br>
Despite the ubiquity of nanoconfined aqueous electrolytes, a theoretical
framework that accounts for the nonlinear coupling of water and ion
polarization is still missing. We introduce a nonlocal and nonlinear field
theory for the nanoscale polarization of ions and water and derive the
electrolyte dielectric properties as a function of salt concentration to first
order in a loop expansion. Classical molecular dynamics simulations are
favorably compared with the calculated dielectric response functions. The
theory correctly predicts the dielectric permittivity decrement with rising
salt concentration and furthermore shows that salt induces a Debye screening in
the longitudinal susceptibility but leaves the short-range water organization
remarkably unchanged.

The ever-growing demand for device miniaturization and energy efficiency in
data storage and computing technology has prompted a shift towards
antiferromagnetic (AFM) topological spin textures as information carriers,
owing to their negligible stray fields, leading to possible high device density
and potentially ultrafast dynamics. We realize, in this work, such chiral
in-plane (IP) topological antiferromagnetic spin textures, namely merons,
antimerons, and bimerons in synthetic antiferromagnets by concurrently
engineering the effective perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, the interlayer
exchange coupling, and the magnetic compensation ratio. We demonstrate by
three-dimensional vector imaging of the N\'eel order parameter, the topology of
those spin textures and reveal globally a well-defined chirality, which is a
crucial requirement for controlled current-induced dynamics. Our analysis
reveals that the interplay between interlayer exchange and interlayer magnetic
dipolar interactions plays a key role in significantly reducing the critical
strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction required to stabilize
topological spin textures, such as AFM merons, making synthetic
antiferromagnets a promising platform for next-generation spintronics
applications.

<h3>A Local Concentration-based Descriptor Predicting the Stacking Fault  Energy of Refractory High Entropy Alloys</h3>

<br>
<br>
Stacking fault energy (SFE) is an essential parameter for characterizing
mechanical properties. However, in high entropy alloys (HEAs), the local
chemical environment varies significantly across different stacking fault
planes, resulting in a substantial fluctuation of SFE values rather than a
unique value, which prohibits the prediction of the local SFE. Herein, we
proposed an effective descriptor based on the local concentration ratio near
stacking fault to quantitatively predict the local SFE of refractory HEAs. We
find that the role of a given element in determining SFE strongly depends on
its valence-electron number relative to other components and the contribution
of its s- and d-electrons to its cohesive properties, which can be understood
in the framework of the tight-binding model. Notably, the descriptor not only
unifies the local nature of SFE from simple alloys to HEAs but also helps to
quickly design HEAs as the involved parameters are easily accessible.

<h3>Biased thermodynamics can explain the behaviour of smart optimization  algorithms that work above the dynamical threshold</h3>

<i>Angelo Giorgio Cavaliere, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi</i>
<br>
<br>
Random constraint satisfaction problems can display a very rich structure in
the space of solutions, with often an ergodicity breaking -- also known as
clustering or dynamical -- transition preceding the satisfiability threshold
when the constraint-to-variables ratio $\alpha$ is increased. However, smart
algorithms start to fail finding solutions in polynomial time at some threshold
$\alpha_{\rm alg}$ which is algorithmic dependent and generally bigger than the
dynamical one $\alpha_d$. The reason for this discrepancy is due to the fact
that $\alpha_d$ is traditionally computed according to the uniform measure over
all the solutions. Thus, while bounding the region where a uniform sampling of
the solutions is easy, it cannot predict the performance of off-equilibrium
processes, that are still able of finding atypical solutions even beyond
$\alpha_d$. Here we show that a reconciliation between algorithmic behaviour
and thermodynamic prediction is nonetheless possible at least up to some
threshold $\alpha_d^{\rm opt}\geq\alpha_d$, which is defined as the maximum
value of the dynamical threshold computed on all possible probability measures
over the solutions. We consider a simple Monte Carlo-based optimization
algorithm, which is restricted to the solution space, and we demonstrate that
sampling the equilibrium distribution of a biased measure improving on
$\alpha_d$ is still possible even beyond the ergodicity breaking point for the
uniform measure, where other algorithms hopelessly enter the out-of-equilibrium
regime. The conjecture we put forward is that many smart algorithms sample the
solution space according to a biased measure: once this measure is identified,
the algorithmic threshold is given by the corresponding ergodicity-breaking
transition.

considered in this work represented lattice vibration and impurity
configuration effects. The results show that 6% Si doping stabilizes the
tetragonal phase at room temperature, although a higher concentration of Si is
required to stabilize the tetragonal phase at zero temperature. These data
indicate that lattice vibration and impurity configuration effects are
important factors determining structural stability at finite temperatures.

The unusual properties of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer
graphene (MATBG) have sparked enormous research interest. However, despite the
dedication of intensive experimental efforts and the proposal of several
possible pairing mechanisms, the origin of its superconductivity remains
elusive. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with micrometer
spatial resolution, we discover replicas of the flat bands in superconducting
MATBG unaligned with its hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate, which are
absent in non-superconducting MATBG aligned with the hBN substrate. Crucially,
the replicas are evenly spaced in energy, separated by 150 +- 15 meV,
signalling the strong coupling of electrons in MATBG to a bosonic mode of this
energy. By comparing our observations to simulations, the formation of replicas
is attributed to the presence of strong inter-valley electron-phonon coupling
to a K-point phonon mode. In total, the observation of these replica flat bands
and the corresponding phonon mode in MATBG could provide important information
for understanding the origin and the unusual properties of its superconducting
phase.

Several effective methods have been developed recently to demonstrate
simultaneous high energy and high power density in Li - carbon fluoride
(CF$_x$) batteries. These methods can achieve as high as 1000 Wh/kg energy
density at 60-70 kW/kg power density (40-50 C rate) in coin cells and 750 Wh/kg
energy density at 12.5 kW/kg power density (20 C rate) in pouch cells. This
performance is made possible by ingenious nano-architecture design, controlled
porosity, boron doping and electrolyte additives. In the present study, we show
that a similarly great performance, 931 Wh/kg energy density at 59 kW/kg power
density, can be achieved by using a polyacrylonitrile binder and a LiBF4
electrolyte in Li - graphite fluoride coin cells. We also demonstrate that the
observed effect is the result of the right combination of the binder and the
electrolyte. We propose that the mechanistic origin of the observed phenomena
is an electro-catalytic effect by the polyacrylonitrile binder. While our
proposed method has a competitive performance, it also offers a simple
implementation and a scalable production of high energy and high power primary
Li-CF$_x$ cells.

Graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) have a variety of functions due to
their rich material variations, and thus,innovative methods for their synthesis
are desired for practical applications. We have discovered that Na has a
catalytic property that dramatically accelerates the formation of GICs. We
demonstrate that LiC6n (n = 1, 2), KC8, KC12n (n = 2, 3, 4), and NaCx are
synthesized simply by mixing alkali metals and graphite powder with Na at room
temperature (~25 {\deg}C), and AEC6 (AE = Ca, Sr, Ba) are synthesized by
heating Na-added reagents at 250 {\deg}C only for a few hours. The NaCx, formed
by the mixing of C and Na, is understood to act as a reaction intermediate for
a catalyst, thereby accelerating the formation of GICs by lowering the
activation energy of intercalation. The Na-catalyzed method, which enables the
rapid and mass synthesis of homogeneous GIC samples in a significantly simpler
manner than conventional methods, is anticipated to stimulate research and
development for GIC applications.

Here we report, the successful synthesis of single crystals of topological
semimetal (TSM) candidate, PdSn$_4$ using the self-grown route. The synthesized
crystal is well characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). Detailed Rietveld analysis of the powder XRD pattern of PdSn$_4$
confirmed the same to crystallize in the Aea2 space group instead of reported
Ccce. A large magnetoresistance (MR) along with Subnikov-de Haas oscillations
have been observed in magnetotransport measurements at 2K. The presence of a
weak antilocalization (WAL) effect in synthesized PdSn$_4$ crystal is confirmed
and analyzed using Hikami Larkin Nagaoka (HLN) formalism, being applied on
magnetoconductivity of the same at the low magnetic field. An extended Kohler
rule is implemented on MR data, to determine the role of the scattering process
and temperature-dependent carrier density on transport phenomenon in PdSn$_4$.
Further, the non-trivial band topology and presence of edge states are shown
through density functional theory (DFT) based theoretical calculations. All
calculations are performed considering the Aea2 space group symmetry. The
calculated Z2 invariants suggest the presence of weak topological insulating
properties in PdSn$_4$. Clear evidence of topological edge states at the
$\Gamma$ point is visible in calculated edge state spectra. This is the first
report on PdSn$_4$, showing the presence of SdH oscillation in magneto
transport measurement.

<h3>Langevin picture of subdiffusion in nonuniformly expanding medium</h3>

<br>
<br>
Anomalous diffusion phenomena have been observed in many complex physical and
biological systems. One significant advance recently is the physical extension
of particle's motion in static medium to uniformly (and even nonuniformly)
expanding medium. The dynamic mechanism of particle's motion in the
nonuniformly expanding medium has only been investigated in the framework of
continuous-time random walk. To study more physical observables and supplement
the theory of the expanding medium problems, we characterize the nonuniformly
expanding medium with a spatial-temporal dependent scale factor $a(x,t)$, and
build the Langevin picture describing the particle's motion in the nonuniformly
expanding medium. By introducing a new coordinate, besides of the existing
comoving and physical coordinates, we build the relation between the
nonuniformly expanding medium and the uniformly expanding one, and further
obtain the moments of the comoving and physical coordinates. Both exponential
and power-law formed scale factor are considered to uncover the combined
effects of the particle's intrinsic diffusion and the nonuniform expansion of
medium. Our detailed theoretical analyses and simulations provide the
foundation for studying more expanding medium problems.

<h3>Revisiting multiple thermal reservoir stochastic thermodynamics</h3>

<br>
<i>Vaibhav Wasnik</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work we first show that for a Markovian system connected to two
thermal reservoirs with temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$, the transition rate
between two energy states labelled by $m$ and $m'$, $W_{m,m'}$ cannot be
written as $W^1_{m,m'} + W^2_{m,m'}$, where $ W^{1 }_{m,m'}$, $ W^{2 }_{m,m'}$
are the transition rates between energy states for systems connected to the
corresponding thermal reservoirs. We next show that the evolution of a system
connected to two thermal reservoirs is non-Markovian by considering an example
of a system made up of two points at different temperatures, each following a
Markovian evolution. We explain the difficulty in realizing the second law of
thermodynamics using the Shannonian entropy definition for such composite
systems.

<br>
<i>Naoki Hara, Masaya Nakagawa</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the effect of two-body loss due to chemical reactions on
quantum magnetism of fermionic polar molecules in an optical lattice. We show
that an interplay between dissipation and strong long-range interactions leads
to formation of metastable ferromagnetic clusters. The spin states of clusters
are controlled by interaction parameters and reflect the symmetry of
interactions. The size of clusters strongly depends on the initial
configuration of molecules due to Hilbert-space fragmentation during
dissipative many-body dynamics. We construct an effective model to show the
emergence of metastable states as quasi-dark states. Application to quantum
simulation of the spin-$S$ Heisenberg model is discussed.

<br>
<br>
We perform polarized optical reflection measurements on a single nodal-ring
semimetal $\rm{SrAs_3}$. For the radial and axial directions of the ring, the
optical conductivity $\sigma_1(\omega)$ exhibits a flat absorption
$\sigma^{\mathrm{flat}}$ over a certain frequency range. In addition, a
prominent optical peak appears at 2$\Delta_{\mathrm{SOC}}$ = 30 meV. For
comparison, we theoretically calculate $\sigma_1(\omega)$ using an effective
model Hamiltonian and first-principles calculations, which successfully
reproduces the data for both directions. The $\sigma^{\mathrm{flat}}$
establishes that the universal power-law of optical conductivity holds robustly
in the nodal ring. Furthermore, key quantities of the nodal ring such as the
band overlap energy, average ring radius, ring ellipticity, and the SOC-gap are
determined from this comparative study. As temperature increases,
$\sigma_1(\omega)$ shows a substantial change, suggesting that a $T$-driven
evolution occurs in the nodal ring.

<h3>Spatial-photonic Boltzmann machines: low-rank combinatorial optimization  and statistical learning by spatial light modulation</h3>

<br>
<br>
The spatial-photonic Ising machine (SPIM) [D. Pierangeli et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett. 122, 213902 (2019)] is a promising optical architecture utilizing spatial
light modulation for solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems
efficiently. However, the SPIM can accommodate Ising problems with only
rank-one interaction matrices, which limits its applicability to various
real-world problems. In this Letter, we propose a new computing model for the
SPIM that can accommodate any Ising problem without changing its optical
implementation. The proposed model is particularly efficient for Ising problems
with low-rank interaction matrices, such as knapsack problems. Moreover, the
model acquires learning ability and can thus be termed a spatial-photonic
Boltzmann machine (SPBM). We demonstrate that learning, classification, and
sampling of the MNIST handwritten digit images are achieved efficiently using
SPBMs with low-rank interactions. Thus, the proposed SPBM model exhibits higher
practical applicability to various problems of combinatorial optimization and
statistical learning, without losing the scalability inherent in the SPIM
architecture.

<h3>Theoretical understanding of correlation between magnetic phase  transition and the superconducting dome in high-Tc cuprates</h3>

<i>Chen Zhang, Cai-Xin Zhang, Su-Huai Wei, Haiqing Lin, Hui-Xiong Deng</i>
<br>
<br>
Many issues concerning the origin of high-temperature superconductivity (HTS)
are still under debate. For example, how the magnetic ordering varies with
doping and its relationship with the superconducting temperature; and why the
maximal Tc always occurs near the quantum critical point. In this paper, taking
hole-doped La2CuO4 as a classical example, we employ the first-principles band
structure and total energy calculations and Monte Carlo simulations to explore
how the symmetry-breaking magnetic ground state evolves with hole doping and
the origin of a dome-shaped superconductivity region in the phase diagram. We
demonstrate that the local antiferromagnetic ordering and doping play key roles
in determining the electron-phonon coupling, thus Tc. Initially, the La2CuO4
possesses a checkerboard local antiferromagnetic ground state. As the hole
doping increases, Tc increases with the increase of the density of states at
the Fermi surface. But as the doping increases further, the strength of the
antiferromagnetic interaction weakens. At the critical doping level, a magnetic
phase transition occurs that reduces the local antiferromagnetism-assisted
electron-phonon coupling, thus diminishing the Tc. The superconductivity
disappears in the heavily overdoped region when the antiferromagnetic ordering
disappears. These observations could account for why cuprates have a
dome-shaped superconductivity region in the phase diagram. Our study, thus,
contributes to a fundamental understanding of the correlation between doping,
local magnetic ordering, and superconductivity of HTS.

<br>

We study the interplay of two different non-Hermitian constitutive
parameters: directional coupling and onsite gain/loss balancing along with
topology in a coupled one dimensional (1D) lattice chain. This work
demonstrates two distinct localization behaviors for the bulk and discrete
in-gap eigen modes in the system. We numerically show that the bulk and half of
the in-gap modes are strongly confined at the boundaries due to directional
hopping and topological localization, respectively. Whereas, correlation
between the constitutive non-Hermitian parameters can tune the energy and
localization length of the remaining in-gap modes and demonstrates two novel
phenomena: one is when the directional strength and gain/loss match these
states become completely extended. Second, coalescing of these modes into
exceptional point (EP). We present explicit analytical solutions for the eigen
function and energy of in-gap modes, that exactly matches with our numerical
results and uncover the origin of delocalization and emergence of EP.

<br>
<br>
The effect of proximity of the magnetism of the Pr-based manganite
(Pr0.6Sr0.4MnO3) on the superconductivity of Bi-based high-temperature
superconductor (Bi1.75Pb0.25Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+d) was studied based on the results
obtained from the magnetotransport and magnetization measurements. Decrease in
the values of the upper critical field (HC2(0)) and an increase in the width of
the superconducting transition (Delta TC) of Bi1.75Pb0.25Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+d were
observed in proximity with the manganite. The combined effect of magnetic
exchange interaction arising from the manganite, the leakage of Cooper-pairs
from the superconductor into the manganite, and the diffusion and transport of
spin-polarized electrons from the manganite into the superconductor were found
to modify the superconducting properties of Bi1.75Pb0.25Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+d. The
stacking sequence of the individual layers in these heterostructures was found
to dictate the ground state properties of the heterostructure. As a consequence
of the proximity effect, the colossal-magnetoresistance (CMR) ratio as high as
~ 99 % observed in the heterostructure makes the thin film heterostructures
promising candidates for potential technological applications.

<h3>Exact Excited-State Functionals of the Asymmetric Hubbard Dimer</h3>

<br>
<i>Sara Giarrusso, Pierre-François Loos</i>
<br>
<br>
We derive, for the case of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling, the
exact functional associated with each singlet ground and excited state, using
both Levy's constrained search and Lieb's convex formulation. While the
ground-state functional is, as commonly known, a convex function with respect
to the density (or, more precisely, the site occupation), the functional
associated with the (highest) doubly-excited state is found to be concave.
Also, we find that, because the density of the first excited state is
non-invertible, its "functional" is a partial, multi-valued function composed
of one concave and one convex branch that correspond to two separate sets of
values of the external potential. These findings offer insight into the
challenges of developing state-specific excited-state density functionals for
general applications in electronic structure theory.

In this study, we investigate the dynamic response of a Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$
(YIG)/ Gd$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (GdIG)/ Pt trilayer system by measurements of the
ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and the pumped spin current detected by the
inverse spin Hall effect. This trilayer system offers the unique opportunity to
investigate the spin dynamics of the ferrimagnetic GdIG, close to its
compensation temperature. We show that our trilayer acts as a highly tunable
spin current source. Our experimental results are supported by micro-magnetic
simulations. As the detected spin current in the top Pt layer is distinctly
dominated by the GdIG layer, this gives the unique opportunity to investigate
the excitation and dynamic properties of GdIG while comparing it to the
broadband FMR absorption spectrum of the heterostructure.

<br>
<i>Miha Srdinsek, Tomaz Prosen, Spyros Sotiriadis</i>
<br>
<br>
The validity of the ergodic hypothesis in quantum systems can be rephrased in
the form of the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis (ETH), a set of
statistical properties for the matrix elements of local observables in energy
eigenstates, which is expected to hold in any ergodic system. We test ETH in a
nonintegrable model of relativistic Quantum Field Theory (QFT) using the
numerical method of Hamiltonian Truncation in combination with analytical
arguments based on Lorentz symmetry and Renormalisation Group theory. We find
that there is an infinite sequence of eigenstates with the characteristics of
Quantum Many-Body Scars, that is, exceptional eigenstates with observable
expectation values that lie far from thermal values, and we show that these
states are one-quasiparticle states. We argue that in the thermodynamic limit
the eigenstates cover the entire area between two diverging lines, the line of
one-quasiparticle states, whose direction is dictated by relativistic
kinematics, and the thermal average line. Our results suggest that the strong
version of ETH is violated in any relativistic QFT whose spectrum admits a
quasiparticle description.

Growth optimization of multilayers is a topic of interest due to their unique
physical properties. Systems containing magnetic materials, such as
platinum-cobalt, have been studied because of their potential for technological
applications, e.g. spintronics, magnetic storage and magnetic sensors. Since
the magnetic properties of thin layers are strongly related to the growth
parameters, the fine tuning of these parameters is necessary to produce
multilayers with specific properties required in various applications. Here, an
efficient approach to tune the coercive field of Co ultrathin films in the
multilayer by varying the underlayer thickness is demonstrated. Using magnetron
sputtering, we prepared multilayer systems of Au(x)/Pt(5nm)/Co(0.7nm)/Au(5nm)
with various thicknesses of Au underlayer. The surface morphology of
Au(x)/Pt(5nm) stack on which Co layer was deposited was studied by atomic force
microscopy. We show the possibility to control the interfacial roughness by
changing the Au underlayer thickness due to its island-like growth mechanism
(Volmer-Weber mode). As the nominal thickness of Au increases, the islands grow
in larger lateral size, resulting in a higher overall roughness of the layer
surface. Magnetization measurements indicate a direct influence of the
underlayer roughness on the coercivity of the multilayers by promoting
additional magnetic anisotropy. With thickness of the Au layer up to 20 nm, we
can change the coercive field in the range from ~200 Oe to ~1100 Oe, while
remaining a nearly constant saturation magnetization. The use of Cu replacing
Au underlayer in the same multilayers was also investigated, demonstrating the
possibility of coercivity adjustment using different materials. The results are
important for applications where the magnetic properties of multilayer
structures based on Co thin films could be adjusted via buffer layer roughness
engineering.

<br>
We present a proof-of-principle demonstration of a universal law for the
element Mn, which greatly enhances vacancy diffusion through an anomalous
Friedel Oscillation effect in a series of Ni-based concentrated solid-solution
alloys, regardless of the type of atom involved. The antiferromagnetic element
Mn possesses a unique half-filled 3d electron structure, creating split virtual
bound states near the Fermi energy level and producing a large local magnetic
moment after vacancy formation. The resultant electron spin oscillations reduce
the number of electrons involved in charge density oscillations, destroying
charge screening and lowering potential interaction at the saddle point between
the vacancy and diffusing atom. This ultimately facilitates vacancy diffusion
by reducing energy level variations of conduction band electrons during the
diffusion process. These findings offer valuable insights into atom diffusion
mechanisms and open up new avenues for manipulating defect properties through
unique element design, thereby enabling the creation of high-performance alloys
in a broad range of fields.

Using the density functional theory (DFT) in combination with Boltzmann
transport theory, the influence of Mg concentrations (x) doping on the
thermoelectric properties of Hg1-xMgxSe ternary alloys was systematically
investigated. The generalized gradient approximations of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof

Various thermoelectric transport parameters, such as the Seebeck coefficient
(S), the thermal conductivity over relaxation time, the electrical conductivity
over relaxation time, the power factor (PF) and the figure of merit (ZT) have
been deduced and discussed. The obtained results of thermoelectric properties
show that the studied materials can be useful for room temperature
thermoelectric devices. It is also found that Mg compositions can increase the
thermal efficiency of the HgSe alloy.

<br>
<br>
In general, the energy spectrum of a non-Hermitian system turns out to be
complex, which is not so satisfactory since the time evolution of eigenstates
with complex eigenvalues is either exponentially growing or decaying. Here we
provide a sufficient and necessary condition of the real spectrum under open
boundary conditions for one-dimensional non-Hermitian tight-binding
Hamiltonians. The necessity is directly related to the fact that the
generalized Brillouin zone in one dimension is a closed loop with the origin in
its interior. For some simple models, we demonstrate the sufficiency by
analytically determining when the preimage of the characteristic polynomial
contains a loop and showing that this loop is just the generalized Brillouin
zone itself. For more complex models, the numerical results are shown. Our
results indicate that real spectra are more common than one may have expected
in non-Hermitian systems and are helpful for designing non-Hermitian models
with real spectra.

Synthetic ferrimagnets are an attractive materials class for spintronics as
they provide access to all-optical switching of magnetization and, at the same
time, allow for ultrafast domain wall motion at angular momentum compensation.
In this work, we systematically study the effects of strain on the
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and magnetization compensation of Co/Gd and
Co/Gd/Co/Gd synthetic ferrimagnets. Firstly, the spin reorientation transition
of a bilayer system is investigated in wedge type samples, where we report an
increase in the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in the presence of in-plane
strain. Using a model for magnetostatics and spin reorientation transition in
this type of system, we confirm that the observed changes in anisotropy field
are mainly due to the Co magnetoelastic anisotropy. Secondly, the magnetization
compensation of a quadlayer is studied. We find that magnetization compensation
of this synthetic ferrimagnetic system is not altered by external strain. This
confirms the robustness of this material system against strain, which could be
potentially induced form integration process.

a finite rate. We start with a Fokker Planck equation to describe the evolution
of the membrane coupled with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type of active noise. Using
the method of characteristics, we solve the equation and obtain the joint
distribution of the membrane height and active noise. In order to obtain the
mean first-passage time (MFPT), we further obtain a relation between the MFPT
and a propagator that includes stochastic resetting. The derived relation is
then used to calculate it analytically. Our studies show that the MFPT
increases with a larger resetting rate and decreases with a smaller rate, i.e.,
there is an optimal resetting rate. We compare the results in terms of MFPT of
the membrane with active and thermal noises for different membrane properties.
The optimal resetting rate is much smaller with active noise compared to
thermal. When the resetting rate is much lower than the optimal rate, we
demonstrate how the MFPT scales with resetting rates, distance to the target,
and the properties of the membranes.

<br>
<br>
The formation of helium cavities in coarse-grained materials produces
hardening proportional to the number density and size of the cavities and due
to the interaction of dislocations with intragranular helium defects. In
nanostructured metals containing a high density of interfacial sinks,
preferential cavity formation on the grain boundaries instead produces
softening and often attributed to enhanced interfacial plasticity. Employing
two grades of ultrafine-grained tungsten, we explore this effect using targeted
implantation studies to map cavity evolution as a function of the irradiation
conditions and quantify its impact on the mechanical response through
nanoindentation. Softening is reported at implantation temperatures above the
threshold for preferential grain boundary cavity formation but at a
sufficiently low fluence prior to the growth of intragranular cavities.
Collective changes in the mean cavity size, density, and morphology beneath a
residual impression on an implanted surface indicate that cavity coalescence
accompanied the reduction in hardness. Complementary atomistic simulations
demonstrate that, in tungsten grain structures exhibiting softening, grain
boundary bubble coalescence is driven by stress concentrations that further act
to localize strain in the grain boundaries through cooperative deformation
processes involving local atomic shuffling and sliding, dislocation emission,
and even the nucleation of unstable twinning events.

Microswimmer suspensions are constantly in non-equilibrium and exhibit
macroscale properties that are in stark contrast to passive suspensions.
Motivated by ubiquitous microbial systems suspended in biological fluids, we
analyse the rheological response of a suspension of elongated microswimmers to
a steady shear flow in a weakly viscoelastic fluid. At the individual level, we
find that the viscoelastic stresses generated by activity substantially modify
the Jeffery orbits well-known from Newtonian fluids. The orientational dynamics
depends on the swimmer type and, in particular, microswimmers can resist
flow-induced rotation and align at an angle with the flow. To analyze its
impact on the bulk rheological response, we study a dilute ensemble of
microswimmers in the presence of stochastic noise due to tumbling and
rotational diffusion. Compared to Newtonian fluids, activity and its elastic
response in polymeric fluids alter the orientational distribution and
substantially amplify the swimmer-induced viscosity. This suggests that pusher
suspensions reach the regime of superfluidity at lower volume fractions.

The dynamics of magnetic moments consist of a precession around the magnetic
field direction and a relaxation towards the field to minimize the energy.
While the magnetic moment and the angular momentum are conventionally assumed
to be parallel to each other, at ultrafast time scales their directions become
separated due to inertial effects. The inertial dynamics give rise to
additional high-frequency modes in the excitation spectrum of magnetic
materials. Here, we review the recent theoretical and experimental advances in
this emerging topic and discuss the open challenges and opportunities in the
detection and the potential applications of inertial spin dynamics.

We study reduced density matrices of the integrable critical RSOS model in a
particular topological sector containing the ground state. Similar as in the
spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg model correlation functions of this model on short
segments can be `factorized': they are completely determined by a single
nearest-neighbour two-point function $\omega$ and a set of structure functions.
While $\omega$ captures the dependence on the system size and the state of the
system the structure functions can be expressed in terms of the possible
operators on the segment, in the present case representations of the
Temperley-Lieb algebra $\text{TL}_n$, and are independent of the model
parameters. We present explicit results for the function $\omega$ in the
infinite system ground state of the model and compute multi-point local height
probabilities for up to four adjacent sites for the RSOS model and the related
three-point correlation functions of non-Abelian $su(2)_k$ anyons.

<h3>Measuring Magnetic 1/f Noise in Superconducting Microstructures and the  Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem</h3>

<br>
<br>
The performance of superconducting devices like qubits, SQUIDs, and particle
detectors is often limited by finite coherence times and 1/f noise. Various
types of slow fluctuators in the Josephson junctions and the passive parts of
these superconducting circuits can be the cause, and devices usually suffer
from a combination of different noise sources, which are hard to disentangle
and therefore hard to eliminate. One contribution is magnetic 1/f noise caused
by fluctuating magnetic moments of magnetic impurities or dangling bonds in
superconducting inductances, surface oxides, insulating oxide layers, and
adsorbates. In an effort to further analyze such sources of noise, we have
developed an experimental set-up to measure both the complex impedance of
superconducting microstructures, and the overall noise picked up by these
structures. This allows for important sanity checks by connecting both
quantities via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Since these two
measurements are sensitive to different types of noise, we are able to identify
and quantify individual noise sources. The superconducting inductances under
investigation form a Wheatstone-like bridge, read out by two independent
cross-correlated dc-SQUID read-out chains. The resulting noise resolution lies
beneath the quantum limit of the front-end SQUIDs and lets us measure noise
caused by just a few ppm of impurities in close-by materials. We present
measurements of the insulating SiO2 layers of our devices, and magnetically
doped noble metal layers in the vicinity of the pickup coils at T = 30 mK - 800
mK and f = 1 Hz - 100 kHz.

<br>
<br>
Antiferromagnetic CuMnAs thin films have attracted attention since the
discovery of the manipulation of their magnetic structure via electrical,
optical, and terahertz pulses of electric fields, enabling convenient
approaches to the switching between magnetoresistive states of the film for the
information storage. However, the magnetic structure and, thus, the efficiency
of the manipulation can be affected by the film morphology and growth defects.
In this study, we investigate the properties of CuMnAs thin films by probing
the defect-related uniaxial anisotropy of electric conductivity by contact-free
terahertz transmission spectroscopy. We show that the terahertz measurements
conveniently detect the conductivity anisotropy, that are consistent with
conventional DC Hall-bar measurements. Moreover, the terahertz technique allows
for considerably finer determination of anisotropy axes and it is less
sensitive to the local film degradation. Thanks to the averaging over a large
detection area, the THz probing also allows for an analysis of strongly
non-uniform thin films. Using scanning near-field terahertz and electron
microscopies, we relate the observed anisotropic conductivity of CuMnAs to the
elongation and orientation of growth defects, which influence the local
microscopic conductivity. We also demonstrate control over the morphology of
defects by using vicinal substrates.

<br>
<br>
In this paper, we show that magnetic skyrmion nucleation can be controlled
using Ga+ ion irradiation, which manipulates the magnetic interface effects (in
particular the magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction) that
govern the stability and energy cost of skyrmions in thin film systems. We
systematically and quantitatively investigated what effect these changes have
on the nucleation of magnetic skyrmions. Our results indicate that the energy
cost of skyrmion nucleation can be reduced up to 26% in the studied dose range
and that it scales approximately linearly with the square root of the
domain-wall energy density. Moreover, the total number of nucleated skyrmions
in irradiated devices after nucleation was found to depend linearly on the ion
dose and could be doubled compared to nonirradiated devices. These results show
that ion irradiation cannot only be used to enable local nucleation of
skyrmions, but that it also allows for fine control of the threshold and
efficiency of the nucleation process.

<h3>Ising analogues of quantum spin chains with multispin interactions</h3>

<br>
A new family of free fermionic quantum spin chains with multispin
interactions was recently introduced. Here we show that it is possible to build
standard quantum Ising chains -- but with inhomogeneous couplings -- which have
the same spectra as the novel spin chains with multispin interactions. The
Ising models are obtained by associating an antisymmetric tridiagonal matrix to
the polynomials that characterize the quasienergies of the system via a
modified Euclidean algorithm. For the simplest non-trivial case, corresponding
to the Fendley model, the phase diagram of the inhomogeneous Ising model is
investigated numerically. It is characterized by gapped phases separated by
critical lines with order-disorder transitions depending on the parity of the
total number of energy density operators in the Hamiltonian.

<h3>A comprehensive thermodynamic model for temperature change in i-caloric  effects</h3>

<br>
<br>
Solid-state cooling based on i-caloric effects may be an alternative to
conventional vapor-compression refrigeration systems. The adiabatic temperature
change ($\Delta T_{S}$) is one of the parameters that characterize the
i-caloric effects, therefore it is important to obtain the correct $\Delta
T_{S}$ values and, whenever possible, to correlate this parameter with
thermodynamic and microscopic quantities. In this work, we propose a
comprehensive thermodynamic model that allows us to determine the adiabatic
temperature change from non-adiabatic measurements of temperature change
induced by a field change. Our model fits efficiently temperature versus time
and temperature change versus the inverse of the field change rate data for
three different materials presenting different i-caloric effects. The results
indicate the present model is a very useful and robust tool to obtain the
correct $\Delta T_{S}$ values and to correlate $\Delta T_{S}$ with other
thermodynamic quantities.

<h3>The role of thermal fluctuations in the motion of a free body</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The motion of a rigid body is described in Classical Mechanics with the
venerable Euler's equations which are based on the assumption that the relative
distances among the constituent particles are fixed in time. Real bodies,
however, cannot satisfy this property, as a consequence of thermal
fluctuations. We generalize Euler's equations for a free body in order to
describe dissipative and thermal fluctuation effects in a thermodynamically
consistent way. The origin of these effects is internal, i.e. not due to an
external thermal bath. The stochastic differential equations governing the
orientation and central moments of the body are derived from first principles
through the theory of coarse-graining. Within this theory, Euler's equations
emerge as the reversible part of the dynamics. For the irreversible part, we
identify two distinct dissipative mechanisms; one associated with diffusion of
the orientation, whose origin lies in the difference between the spin velocity
and the angular velocity, and one associated with the damping of dilations,
i.e. inelasticity. We show that a deformable body with zero angular momentum
will explore uniformly, through thermal fluctuations, all possible
orientations. When the body spins, the equations describe the evolution towards
the alignment of the body's major principal axis with the angular momentum
vector. In this alignment process, the body increases its temperature. We
demonstrate that the origin of the alignment process is not inelasticity but
rather orientational diffusion. The theory also predicts the equilibrium shape
of a spinning body.

<h3>The percolating cluster is invisible to image recognition with deep  learning</h3>

<br>
<i>Djénabou Bayo, Andreas Honecker, Rudolf A. Römer</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the two-dimensional site-percolation model on a square lattice. In
this paradigmatic model, sites are randomly occupied with probability $p$; a
second-order phase transition from a non-percolating to a fully percolating
phase appears at occupation density $p_c$, called percolation threshold.
Through supervised deep learning approaches like classification and regression,
we show that standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs), known to work well
in similar image recognition tasks, can identify $p_c$ and indeed classify the
states of a percolation lattice according to their $p$ content or predict their
$p$ value via regression. When using instead of $p$ the spatial cluster
correlation length $\xi$ as labels, the recognition is beginning to falter.
Finally, we show that the same network struggles to detect the presence of a
spanning cluster. Rather, predictive power seems lost and the absence or
presence of a global spanning cluster is not noticed by a CNN with local
convolutional kernel. Since the existence of such a spanning cluster is at the
heart of the percolation problem, our results suggest that CNNs require careful
application when used in physics, particularly when encountering less-explored
situations.

<h3>Effect of dispersive optical phonons on the properties of Bond  Su-Schrieffer-Heeger polaron</h3>

We use a newly developed Quantum Monte Carlo method based on the
path-integral formulation of the particle sector and the real-space
diagrammatic technique of the phonon sector to investigate the impact of a
finite dispersion of the optical phonon mode on the properties of the bond
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger polaron in two dimensions. Our study focuses on the effect
of positive bandwidth on the bond polaron's effective mass, ground state
energy, and $Z$ factor, comparing these properties with those of the
dispersionless case. At the same electron-phonon coupling strength, in the
absence of phonon dispersion, we observe that the effective mass increases as
the phonon frequency decreases, indicating a heavier polaron in the deep
adiabatic regime. While in the dispersive case, we find that the effective mass
increases as the phonon bandwidth increases. Furthermore, we observe a
crossover from a light polaron state to a heavy polaron state in the deep
adiabatic regime for both the dispersionless and dispersive case.

<h3>Ordering of water molecules confined in beryl: A theoretical study</h3>

<br>
<br>
In agreement with recent NMR experiments on beryl crystals containing
confined water molecules, we developed an improved model for studying the
interactions among the water molecules' dipole moments. The model is based on a
local crystal potential with a dihexagonal symmetry for the rotations of the
water dipole moments, leading to their deflection from the $ab$ hexagonal
crystallographic plane. This shape of the potential implies nontrivial
consequences concerning the dipole ordering, which are linked to the non-zero
projection of the dipole moment along the hexagonal $c$ axis. We used a
variational mean-field approximation, Monte Carlo simulations, and quantum
tunneling to reveal a tendency toward three types of equilibrium-ordered
states. These states involve a purely planar dipole order with an antiparallel
arrangement in the adjacent planes, a configuration with deflected dipole
moments ordered in antiparallel directions, and a helical structure of the
dipoles twisting along the $c$ axis.

Electrochemical energy storage always involves the capacitive process. The
prevailing electrode model used in the molecular simulation of polarizable
electrode-electrolyte systems is the Siepmann-Sprik model developed for perfect
metal electrodes. This model has been recently extended to study the
metallicity in the electrode model by including the Thomas-Fermi screening
length. Nevertheless, a further extension to heterogeneous electrode models
requires introducing chemical specificity which does not have any analytical
recipes. Here, we address this challenge by integrating the atomistic machine
learning code (PiNN) for generating the base charge and response kernel and the
classical molecular dynamics code (MetalWalls) dedicated to the modelling of
electrochemical systems, and this leads to the development of the PiNNwall
interface. Apart from the cases of chemically doped graphene and graphene oxide
electrodes as shown in this study, the PiNNwall interface also allows us to
probe polarized oxide surfaces in which both the proton charge and the
electronic charge can coexist. Therefore, this work opens the door for
modelling heterogeneous and complex electrode materials often found in energy
storage systems.

The electron-hole exchange interaction is a fundamental mechanism that drives
valley depolarization via intervalley exciton hopping in semiconductor
multi-valley systems. Here, we report polarization-resolved photoluminescence
spectroscopy of neutral excitons and negatively charged trions in monolayer
MoSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ under biaxial strain. We observe a marked
enhancement(reduction) on the WSe$_2$ triplet trion valley polarization with
compressive(tensile) strain while the trion in MoSe$_2$ is unaffected. The
origin of this effect is shown to be a strain dependent tuning of the
electron-hole exchange interaction. A combined analysis of the strain dependent
polarization degree using ab initio calculations and rate equations shows that
strain affects intervalley scattering beyond what is expected from strain
dependent bandgap modulations. The results evidence how strain can be used to
tune valley physics in energetically degenerate multi-valley systems.

Taking advantage of recent progress in neutron instrumentation and in the
understanding of magnetic-field-dependent small-angle neutron scattering, here,
we study the three-dimensional magnetization distribution within an isotropic
Nd-Fe-B bulk magnet. The magnetic neutron scattering cross section of this
system features the so-called spike anisotropy, which points towards the
presence of a strong magnetodipolar interaction. This experimental result
combined with a damped oscillatory behavior of the corresponding correlation
function and recent micromagnetic simulation results on spherical nanoparticles
suggest an interpretation of the neutron data in terms of vortex-like flux
closure patterns. The field-dependent correlation length is very well
reproduced by a power-law model used to describe the London penetration depth
in the vortex state of type-II superconductors and suggests the 'pairing'

Magnetically assembled superparamagnetic colloids have been exploited as
fluid mixers, swimmers and delivery systems in several microscale applications.
The encapsulation of such colloids in droplets may open new opportunities to
build magnetically controlled displays and optical components. Here, we study
the assembly of superparamagnetic colloids inside droplets under rotating
magnetic fields and exploit this phenomenon to create functional optical
devices. Colloids are encapsulated in monodisperse droplets produced by
microfluidics and magnetically assembled into dynamic two-dimensional clusters.
Using an optical microscope equipped with a magnetic control setup, we
investigate the effect of the magnetic field strength and rotational frequency
on the size, stability and dynamics of 2D colloidal clusters inside droplets.
Our results show that cluster size and stability depend on the magnetic forces
acting on the structure under the externally imposed field. By rotating the
cluster in specific orientations, we illustrate how magnetic fields can be used
to control the effective refractive index and the transmission of light through
the colloid-laden droplets, thus demonstrating the potential of the
encapsulated colloids in optical applications.

Advances in the control of intense infrared light have led to the striking
discovery of metastable superconductivity in $\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{C}_{60}$ at
100K, lasting more than 10 nanoseconds. Inspired by these experiments, we
discuss possible mechanisms for long-lived, photo-induced superconductivity
above $T_{c}$. We analyze a minimal model of optically-driven Raman phonons
coupled to inter-band electronic transitions. Using this model, we develop a
possible microscopic mechanism for photo-controlling the pairing interaction by
displacively shifting the Raman mode. Leveraging this mechanism, we explore two
pictures of long-lived, light-induced superconductivity far above $T_c$. We
first investigate long-lived, photo-induced superconductivity arising from the
metastable trapping of a displaced phonon coordinate. We then propose an
alternate route to long-lived superconductivity. Within this paradigm, the slow
equilibration of quasi-particles enables a long-lived, non-thermal
superconducting gap. We conclude by discussing implications of both scenarios
to experiments that can be used to discriminate between them. Our work provides
falsifiable, mechanistic explanations for the nanosecond scale photo-induced
superconductivity found in $\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{C}_{60}$, while also offering a
theoretical basis for exploring long-lived, non-equilibrium superconductivity
in other quantum materials.

We present an unbiased mean-field analysis of magnetic and charge orders in
the two-dimensional Hubbard model on a square lattice, both at zero and finite
temperatures. Unrestricted Hartree-Fock calculations on large finite lattices
are complemented by solutions restricted to N\'eel and circular spiral order in
the thermodynamic limit. The magnetic states are classified by a systematic
scheme based on the dominant Fourier components of the spin texture. On finite
lattices a whole zoo of ordering patterns appears. We show that many of these
states are finite size artifacts related to the limited choice of ordering wave
vectors on a finite lattice. In the thermodynamic limit only three classes of
states with a relatively simple structure survive: N\'eel, circular spiral, and
stripe states. Stripes involve also charge order and can be unidirectional or
bidirectional, with horizontal and/or vertical orientation. We present complete
phase diagrams in the plane spanned by electron density and temperature, for a
moderate Hubbard interaction and various choices of the next-nearest neighbor
hopping amplitude.

Nanoscale multi-phase microstructures observed in multi-principal element
alloys (MPEAs) such as $\rm AlMo_{0.5}NbTa_{0.5}TiZr$, $\rm

Fe_{15}Co_{15}Ni_{20}Mn_{20}Cu_{30}$ that exhibit promising mechanical or
functional properties may have evolved through spinodal-mediated phase
transformation pathways (PTPs). The microstructures in such MPEA systems could
be further engineered for targeted applications by appropriately designing the
alloy composition and heat-treatment schedule. In this study, we investigate
systematically how different heat treatment schedules such as single-step
isothermal aging, two-step isothermal aging and continuous cooling alter the
interplay among the various factors associated with alloy composition, such as
volume fraction of individual phases, lattice misfit and modulus mismatch
between the co-existing phases. We have determined the degree to which these
factors influence significantly the spinodal-mediated PTPs and the
corresponding microstructures by use of high-throughput phase-field
simulations. In particular, we demonstrate that the microstructural topology
(i.e., which phase forms the continuous matrix and which phase forms discrete
precipitates) in the same MPEA having an asymmetric miscibility gap could be
inverted simply by a continuous cooling heat treatment. Further, we reveal a
rich variety of novel hierarchical microstructures that could be designed using
two-step isothermal aging heat treatments in MPEA systems with symmetric or
asymmetric miscibility gaps. These simulation results may shed light on novel
microstructure design and engineering for the above-mentioned MPEA systems.

We study semiclassically the dynamics of a quantum $p$-spin glass model
starting from initial states defined in microcanonical shells. We compute
different chaos estimators, such as the Lyapunov exponent and the
Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, and find a marked maximum as a function of the energy
of the initial state. By studying the relaxation dynamics and the properties of
the energy landscape we show that the maximal chaos emerges in correspondence
with the fastest spin relaxation and the maximum complexity, thus suggesting a
qualitative picture where chaos emerges as the trajectories are scattered over
the exponentially many saddles of the underlying landscape.
We also observe hints of ergodicity breaking at low energies, indicated by
the correlation function and a maximum of the fidelity susceptibility.

The orientation of the order parameter of quantum magnets can be used to
store information in a dense and efficient way. Switching this order parameter
corresponds to writing data. To understand how this can be done, we study a
precessional reorientation of the sublattice magnetization in an (an)isotropic
quantum antiferromagnet induced by an applied magnetic field. We use a
description including the leading quantum and thermal fluctuations, namely
Schwinger boson mean-field theory, because this theory allows us to describe
both ordered phases and the phases in between them, as is crucial for
switching. An activation energy has to be overcome requiring a minimum applied
field $h_\text{t}$ which is given essentially by the spin gap. It can be
reduced significantly for temperatures approaching the N\'eel temperature
facilitating switching. The time required for switching diverges when the field
approaches $h_\text{t}$ which is the signature of an inertia in the
magnetization dynamics. The temporal evolution of the magnetization and of the
energy reveals signs of dephasing. The switched state has lost a part of its
coherence because the magnetic modes do not evolve in phase.

For almost 70 years, the pronounced dependence of the glass transition
temperature (Tg) on molecular size has been understood as resulting from
enhanced mobility and free volume of chain ends, combined with a simple
dilution effect as chain length increases. Here we report on findings from
molecular dynamics simulations demonstrating that this proposed mechanism is
inconsistent with local dynamics and free volume behavior in multiple model
polymers. Results indicate that free volume is not universally enhanced at the
chain end; moreover, we find that chain end mobility enhancements are far too
weak to account for the trend in Tg with varying molecular weight. Instead,
results support a scenario wherein this trend is driven by a molecular size
dependence of intramolecular correlations and barriers - an effect already
present at temperatures far above the glass formation range.

Periodically driven quantum dots can act as counterparts of cyclic thermal
machines at the nanoscale. In the slow-driving regime of geometric pumping,
such machines have been shown to operate in analogy to a Carnot cycle. For
larger driving frequencies, which are required in order to increase the cooling
power, the efficiency of the operation decreases. Up to which frequency a
close-to-optimal performance is still possible depends on the magnitude and
sign of on-site electron-electron interaction. Extending our previous detailed
study on cyclic quantum-dot refrigerators [Phys. Rev. B 106, 035405 (2022)], we
here find that the optimal cooling power remains constant up to weak
interaction strength compared to the cold-bath temperature. By contrast, the
work cost depends on the interaction via the dot's charge relaxation rate, as
the latter sets the typical driving frequency for the onset of non-geometric
pumping contributions.

Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are very promising
materials for quantum dots and spin-qubit implementation. Reliable operation of
spin qubits requires the knowledge of Land\'e g-factor, which can be measured
by exploiting the discrete energy spectrum on a quantum dot. However, the
quantum dots realized in TMDCs has yet to reach the required quality for
reliable measurement of g-factor. Quantum dot sizes reported in TMDCs so far
are not small enough to observe discrete energy levels on them. Here, we report
on electron transport through discrete energy levels of quantum dot in a single
layer MoS2. The quantum dot energy levels are separated by few (5-6) meV such
that the ground state and the excited state transitions are clearly visible.
This well resolved energy separation allows us to accurately measure the ground
state g-factor of ~5 in MoS2 quantum dots. We observe a spin filling sequence
in our quantum dot under perpendicular magnetic field. Such a system offers an
excellent testbed to measure the key parameters for evaluation and
implementation of spin-valley qubits in TMDCs, thus accelerating the
development of quantum systems in two dimensional semiconducting TMDCs.

In this paper, we study the Berry curvature induced linear and nonlinear
magnon transport in bilayer van der Waals antiferromagnets, where we deduce
forms for the spin and energy currents within the semiclassical Boltzmann
formalism under the relaxation time approximation. Even in the absence of the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, if we turn on the layer-dependent
electrostatic doping (ED) potential and anisotropy in the Heisenberg
interactions, the linear response remains zero, whereas, we obtain a nonzero
nonlinear thermal Hall response resulting from higher moments of the Berry
curvature. We show that, there is a sign reversal of nonlinear thermal Hall
conductivity with varying strength of ED potential, which can be potentially
useful in spin-based technologies. We also comment on the momentum and
temperature dependence of the relaxation time which can influence the transport
properties.

Resetting a stochastic process is an important problem describing the
evolution of physical, biological and other systems which are continually
returned to their some fixed point different from their initial position. We
consider the motion of a subdiffusive particle with a constant drift under
Poissonian resetting. In this model the stochastic process is Brownian motion
subordinated by an inverse infinitely divisible process (subordinator).
Although this approach includes a wide class of subdiffusive system with
Poissonian resetting by using different subordinators, each of such systems has
a stationary state with the asymmetric Laplace distribution in which the scale
and asymmetric parameters depend on the Laplace exponent of used subordinators.
Moreover, the mean time for the particle to reach a target is finite and has a
minimum, optimal with respect to the resetting rate. Features of Levy motion
under this resetting and the influence of a linear potential are discussed.

A Kondo lattice is often electrically insulating at low temperatures.
However, several recent experiments have detected signatures of bulk
metallicity within this Kondo insulating phase. Here we visualize the
real-space charge landscape within a Kondo lattice with atomic resolution using
a scanning tunneling microscope. We discover nanometer-scale puddles of
metallic conduction electrons centered around uranium-site substitutions in the
heavy-fermion compound URu$_2$Si$_2$, and around samarium-site defects in the
topological Kondo insulator SmB$_6$. These defects disturb the Kondo screening
cloud, leaving behind a fingerprint of the metallic parent state. Our results
suggest that the mysterious 3D quantum oscillations measured in SmB$_6$ could
arise from these Kondo-lattice defects, although we cannot rule out other
explanations. Our imaging technique could enable the development of
atomic-scale charge sensors using heavy-fermion probes.

On-demand emission of individual electrons for the implementation of flying
qubits and quantum electron-optics experiments requires precise knowledge and
tunability of emission times and energies. Crucially, for confined electron
sources such as driven quantum dots, the effect of local Coulomb interaction on
these emission properties needs to be understood, in particular if multiple
particles are emitted close in time or near-simultaneously. This paper
theoretically analyzes electron-pair emission from an ac driven quantum dot,
detailing the competing effects of the electron-electron interaction, the
time-dependent potential forming the quantum dot, and of the quantum-state
properties such as degeneracy on the emission times and energies. We complement
a numerical analysis of the coherent Schr\"odinger evolution of two particles
in a driven potential with a master-equation description for strongly
interacting electrons tunneling stochastically into a weakly coupled conductor.
This captures a broad range of different influences on the emitted particles
and thereby guides the development of single-electron sources higher control
over two-particle emission properties.
