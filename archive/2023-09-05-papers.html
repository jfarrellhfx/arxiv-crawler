<h3>Shear flow of non-Brownian rod-sphere mixtures near jamming</h3>

Varying particle shape provides a route to rationally design the viscosity
and jamming of complex fluids. The underlying physical mechanisms, however,
remain unexplored. Here we use the discrete element method, taking particle
contact and hydrodynamic lubrication into account, to unveil the shear rheology
of mixtures of frictionless non-Brownian spheres and rod-like (spherocylinders)
particles in the dense regime of packing fraction. By increasing the aspect
ratio of the rods, while keeping constant either the total (rods plus spheres)
particle packing fraction and the rod-sphere mixing ratio, the viscosity $\eta$
of the mixture is observed to vary in a non-monotonical fashion. An initial
decrease of viscosity with increasing aspect ratio is followed by a subsequent
increase after that a minimum is reached when the rods have an aspect ratio of
approximately $1.5.$ This minimum represents the absolute one, in the
particular case of no spheres present in the system. A mechanistic
interpretation of this discovery is provided in terms of packing and
excluded-volume arguments.

<h3>Control of the Scattering Properties of Complex Systems By Means of  Tunable Metasurfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00633" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00633</a>

We demonstrate the ability to control the scattering properties of a
two-dimensional wave-chaotic microwave billiard through the use of tunable
metasurfaces located on the interior walls of the billiard. The complex
reflection coefficient of the metasurfaces can be varied by applying a DC
voltage bias to varactor diodes on mushroom-shaped resonant patches, and this
proves to be very effective at perturbing the eigenmodes of the cavity. Placing
multiple metasurfaces inside the cavity allows us to engineer desired
scattering conditions, such as coherent perfect absorption (CPA), by actively
manipulating the poles and zeros of the scattering matrix through the
application of multiple voltage biases. We demonstrate the ability to create
on-demand CPA conditions at a specific frequency, and document the near-null of
output power as a function of four independent parameters tuned through the CPA
point. A remarkably low output-to-input power ratio of $\frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}
= 3.71 \times 10^{-8}$ is achieved near the CPA point at 8.54 GHz.

<h3>Integrating dynamical mean-field theory and diagrammatic Monte Carlo</h3>

Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is one of the most widely used theoretical
methods for electronic structure calculations, providing self-consistent
solutions even in low-temperature regimes, which are exact in the limit of
infinite dimension. The principal limitation of this method is that it neglects
spatial fluctuations, which become important in finite dimensions. Diagrammatic
Monte Carlo (diagMC), by contrast, provides results that are asymptotically
exact for a convergent or resummable series, but are typically limited to high
temperature as they depend on the analytic structure of the expansion. In this
work, we present a framework for integrating these two methods so that the
diagrammatic expansion is conducted around the DMFT solution. This results in a
series expansion conducted only in terms that explicitly depend on nonlocal
correlations, and which is asymptotically exact.

<h3>Spin-fluctuation glue disfavors high-critical temperature of  superconductivity?</h3>

Antiferromagnetic fluctuations are believed to be a promising glue to drive
high-temperature superconductivity especially in cuprates. Here, we perform a
close inspection of the superconducting mechanism from spin fluctuations in the
Eliashberg framework by employing a typical one-band model on a square lattice.
While spin fluctuations can eventually drive superconductivity as is well
established, we find that the superconducting tendency is suppressed
substantially by a seemingly negligible contribution from a small momentum
transfer far away from (pi,pi). This suppression comes from phase frustration
of the pairing gap and is expected to be a general feature due to the repulsive
pairing interaction of spin fluctuations. Furthermore, we find that the
momentum dependence of the pairing gap largely deviates from the functional
form of cos kx - cos ky, although this form is well established in cuprate
superconductors. We argue that an instantaneous magnetic interaction plays the
important role to understand high-critical temperature of superconductivity as
well as the momentum dependence of the pairing gap.

<h3>Quantum-Geometric Origin of Stacking Ferroelectricity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00728" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00728</a>

<br>
<br>
Stacking ferroelectricity has been discovered in a wide range of van der
Waals materials and holds promise for applications, including photovoltaics and
high-density memory devices. We show that the microscopic origin of stacking
ferroelectric polarization can be generally understood as a consequence of
nontrivial Berry phase borne out of an effective Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model
description with broken sublattice symmetry, thus uniting novel two-dimensional
ferroelectricity with the modern theory of polarization. Our theory applies to
known stacking ferroelectrics such as bilayer transition-metal dichalcogenides
in 3R and T$_{\rm d}$ phases, as well as general AB-stacked bilayers with
honeycomb lattice and staggered sublattice potential. In addition to
establishing a unifying microscopic framework for stacking ferroelectrics the
quantum-geometric perspective provides key guiding principles for the design of
new van der Waals materials with robust ferroelectric polarization.

<h3>Microscopic scale of pair-breaking quantum phase transitions in  superconducting films, nanowires and La$_{1.92}$Sr$_{0.08}$CuO$_{4}$</h3>

The superconducting ground state in a large number of two-dimensional (2d)
systems can be created and destroyed through quantum phase transitions (QPTs)
driven by non-thermal parameters such as the carrier density or magnetic field.
The microscopic mechanism of QPTs has not been established in any 2d
superconductor, in part due to an emergent scale-invariance near the critical
point, which conceals the specific processes driving the transitions. In this
work, we find that the pair-breaking mechanism causing the suppression of the
Cooper pair density gives a unifyingly consistent description of
magnetic-field-driven QPTs in amorphous MoGe, Pb and TaN films, as well as in
quasi-2d high-temperature superconductor La$_{1.92}$Sr$_{0.08}$CuO$_{4}$. This
discovery was facilitated by the development of a novel theoretical approach,
one which goes beyond the standard determination of critical exponents and
allows for the extraction of a microscopic seeding length scale of the
transitions. Remarkably, for the materials studied, and also for MoGe
nanowires, this scale matches the superconducting coherence length. Further,
this approach has been successfully applied to many other complex,
non-superconducting systems.

In the vicinity of continuous quantum phase transitions (QPTs), quantum
systems become scale-invariant and can be grouped into universality classes
characterized by sets of critical exponents. We have found that despite
scale-invariance and universality, the experimental data still contain
information related to the microscopic processes and scales governing QPTs. We
conjecture that near QPTs, various physical quantities follow the generic
exponential dependence predicted by the scaling theory of localization; this
dependence includes as a parameter a microscopic seeding scale of the
renormalization group, $L_0$. We also conjecture that for interacting systems,
the temperature cuts the renormalization group flow at the length travelled by
a system-specific elementary excitation over the life-time set by the Planckian
time, $\tau_P$=$\hbar/k_BT$. We have adapted this approach for QPTs in several
systems and showed that $L_0$ extracted from experiment is comparable to
physically-expected minimal length scales, namely (i) the mean free path for
metal-insulator transition in doped semiconductors, (ii) the distance between
spins in Heisenberg and Ising chains, (iii) the period of an optical lattice
for cold atom boson gases, and (iv) the period of a moir\'e superlattice for
the Mott QPT in dichalcogenide bilayers. In the first companion paper, we show
that in superconducting films and nanowires, as well as in the high temperature
superconductor La$_{1.92}$Sr$_{0.08}$CuO$_4$, $L_0$ is comparable to
superconducting coherence length. In the second companion paper, we show that
in quantum Hall systems, $L_0$ is comparable to the magnetic length. The
developed theoretical approach quantitatively explains and unifies a large body
of experimental data and can be expanded to other complex systems

<h3>Quantum phase transitions in quantum Hall and other topological systems:  role of the Planckian time</h3>

Transformations between the plateau states of the quantum Hall effect (QHE)
are an archetypical example of quantum phase transitions (QPTs) between phases
with non-trivial topological order. These transitions appear to be
well-described by the single-particle network theories. The long-standing
problem with this approach is that it does not account for Coulomb
interactions. In this paper, we show that experimental data in the quantum
critical regime for both integer and fractional QHEs can be quantitatively
explained by the recently developed phenomenological model of QPTs in
interacting systems. This model assumes that all effects of interactions are
contained in the life-time of fluctuations as set by the Planckian time
$\tau_P=\hbar/k_BT$. The dephasing length is taken as the distance traveled by
a non-interacting particle along the bulk edge state over this time. We show
that the model also provides quantitative description of QPTs between the
ground states of anomalous QHE and axion and Chern insulators. These analyzed
systems are connected in that the QPTs occur via quantum percolation. Combining
the presented results with the results of two companion papers, we conclude
that the Planckian time is the encompassing characteristic of QPTs in
interacting systems, independent of dimensionality and microscopic physics.

<h3>Diffuse Inelastic Neutron Scattering from Anharmonic Vibrations in  Cuprite</h3>

<br>
<br>
Atomic vibrational dynamics in cuprite, Cu2O, was studied by inelastic
neutron scattering and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations from 10 K to 900 K.
Above 300 K, a diffuse inelastic intensity (DII) appeared, obscuring the
high-energy phonon modes. Classical MD simulations with a machine learning
interatomic potential reproduced general features of the DII, especially with a
Langevin thermostat. The DII originates from random phase shifts of vibrating
O-atoms that have anharmonic interactions with neighboring Cu-atoms.

<br>
<br>
With extensive variational simulations, dissipative quantum phase transitions
in the sub-Ohmic spin-boson model are numerically studied in a dense limit of
environmental modes. By employing a generalized trial wave function composed of
coherent-state expansions, transition points and critical exponents are
accurately determined for various spectral exponents, demonstrating excellent
agreement with those obtained by other sophisticated numerical techniques.
Besides, the quantum-to-classical correspondence is fully confirmed over the
entire sub-Ohmic range, compared with theoretical predictions of the long-range
Ising model. Mean-field and non-mean-field critical behaviors are found in the
deep and shallow sub-Ohmic regimes, respectively, and distinct physical
mechanisms of them are uncovered.

Since the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) was first observed
experimentally, its microscopic mechanism has been continuously explored by the
scientific community. Among these investigations, the non-equilibrium effects
and the unknown origins of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) have been the central
issues discussed in recent years. Here, we have achieved a persistent spin
current in different circular single-helix molecule driven by a magnetic field,
which is inherently linked to the equilibrium state associated with chirality.
Due to its measurement method being different from the transport currents
observed in previous experiments, the origin of its spin-orbit coupling can be
explored by modifying the substrate with different light and heavy metal
elements. Our results demonstrate that a persistent spin current can be
observed regardless of whether the SOC originates from the chiral molecule or
the substrate. Furthermore, by tuning the direction of the magnetic field, we
can achieve a phase transition between trivial and non-trivial chiral
persistent spin currents. Our work provides a new perspective and platform for
exploring the nature of CISS and controlling the effects of CISS.

Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and other quasi-two-dimensional moir\'e
superlattices have attracted significant attention due to the emergence of
various correlated and topological states associated with the flat bands in
these systems. In this work, we theoretically explore the physical properties
of a new type of \textit{three dimensional graphite moir\'e superlattice}, the
bulk alternating twisted graphite (ATG) system with homogeneous twist angle,
which is grown by in situ chemical vapor decomposition method. Compared to TBG,
the bulk ATG system is bestowed with an additional wavevector degrees of
freedom due to the extra dimensionality. As a result, we find that when the
twist angle of bulk ATG is smaller than twice of the magic angle of TBG, there
always exist ``magic momenta" at which the in-plane Fermi velocities of the
moir\'e bands vanish. Moreover, topologically distinct flat bands of TBG at
different magic angles can even co-exist at different out-of-plane wavevectors
in a single bulk ATG system. Most saliently, when the twist angle is relatively
large, exactly dispersionless three dimensional zeroth Landau level would
emerge in the bulk ATG, which may give rise to robust three dimensional quantum
Hall effects over a large range of twist angles.

<h3>An Isotropic Discretization with Semi-implicit Approach for Phase Field  Model of Alloy Solidification</h3>

Quantitative phase field models have been extensively used to study the
solidification behavior of alloys under different conditions. However, a
longstanding challenge of phase field models is the directional bias caused by
the discretization-induced lattice effects. In particular, widely used
discretization methods may introduce significant spurious anisotropy for
simulations of polycrystalline solidification. In this paper, we demonstrate a
feasible 2D discretization strategy utilizing a hexagonal mesh to reduce the
lattice-induced anisotropy of the phase field model. The leading differential
terms of the 2D discretization methods are analyzed by using known methods in
Fourier space. Using Taylor expansion of discrete Fourier Transform up to sixth
order, we found that the proposed discretization strategy is more accurate and
isotropic than other methods, including the isotropic discretization recently
proposed by Ji et al.[1]. Additionally, the proposed 2D discretization method
can be easily incorporated into a semi-implicit algorithm to solve phase field
equations, thereby greatly reducing time step constraints and improving
computational efficiency compared to explicit approaches. To prove the accuracy
and efficiency of the proposed isotropic discretization with semi-implicit
algorithm, 2D simulations of alloy solidification with different discretization
schemes were performed and compared. We show that the proposed discretization
using a hexagonal mesh can drastically reduce grid-induced anisotropy compared
to conventional methods.

<h3>Linear Trimer Formation by Three-Center-Four-Electron Bonding in RuP</h3>

In molecules like hydrogen, most chemical bonds are formed by sharing two
electrons from each atom in the bonding molecular orbital
(two-center-two-electron (2c2e) bonding). There are, however, different kinds
of chemical bonding. The I3- molecule, for example, is noteworthy because three
iodine atoms are linearly united by sharing four electrons
(three-center-four-electron (3c4e) bonding). Some inorganic solids undergo
phase transitions that result in the formation of "molecules" in their
crystalline frameworks, which are often accompanied by dramatic changes in
physical properties; the metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) in vanadium
dioxide, for example, occurs with the formation of dimer molecules with 2c2e
bonding. We repot the creation of a linear ruthenium trimer with 3c4e bonding
in ruthenium monopnictide at its MIT. Charge transfer from polymerized
phosphorous to ruthenium produces this unusual molecule, with all conduction
electrons trapped by the bonding molecular orbital. Our results demonstrate
that molecules are crucial even in solid crystals as they impact their
electronic properties.

The disorder-free localization that occurred in the study of relaxation
dynamics in far-from-equilibrium quantum systems has been widely explored. Here
we investigate the interplay between the dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) and
disorder in the hard-core polar bosons in a one-dimensional lattice. We find
that the localized dynamics will eventually thermalize in the clean gas, but
can be stabilized with the existence of a small disorder proportional to the
inverse of DDI strength. From the effective dimer Hamiltonian, we show that the
effective second-order hopping of quasiparticles between nearest-neighbor sites
is suppressed by the disorder with strength similar to the effective hopping
amplitude. The significant gap between the largest two eigenvalues of the
entanglement spectrum indicates the dynamical confinement. We also find that
the disorder related sample-to-sample fluctuation is suppressed by the DDI.
Finally, we extend our research from the uncorrelated random disorder to the
correlated quasiperiodic disorder and from the two-dimer model to the
half-filling system, obtaining similar results.

<h3>A path integral approximation of conditional probability densities with  application to stochastic elastic rods</h3>

In this work, we generalise Gelfand-Yaglom-type methods in the vector case
for the computation of Gaussian path integrals. The extension we propose allows
to consider general second variation operators subject to different boundary
conditions and to regularise the divergence in presence of zero modes. The
derived methods are exploited to study the statistical physics of polymers at
thermodynamic equilibrium (e.g. DNA). The energy of equilibria combined with
suitable Jacobi field determinants can be used to estimate the distribution of
end-to-end displacements when the filament is interacting with a heat bath. In
the continuum limit of Cosserat elastic rods, we demonstrate how to derive
approximate conditional probability density functions governing the relative
location and orientation of the two ends, first for the looping problem and
second when the rod is subject to a prescribed external end-loading, in
addition to external stochastic forcing. For isotropic Cosserat rods, certain
looping boundary value problems admit non-isolated families of critical points
of the energy due to an associated continuous symmetry, and the standard
Laplace method fails for the presence of zero modes. Taking inspiration from
(imaginary) path integral techniques, we show how a quantum mechanical
probabilistic treatment of Goldstone modes in statistical rod mechanics sheds
light on J-factor computations for isotropic rods in the semi-classical
context. All the results are achieved exploiting appropriate Jacobi fields
arising from Gaussian path integrals, and show good agreement when compared
with intense Monte Carlo simulations for the target examples.

<h3>Room-Temperature Anomalous Hall Effect in Graphene in Interfacial  Magnetic Proximity with EuO Grown by Topotactic Reduction</h3>

<br>
<br>
We show that thin layers of EuO, a ferromagnetic insulator, can be achieved
by topotactic reduction under titanium of a Eu2O3 film deposited on top of a
graphene template. The reduction process leads to the formation of a 7-nm thick
EuO smooth layer, without noticeable structural changes in the underlying
chemical vapor deposited (CVD) graphene. The obtained EuO films exhibit
ferromagnetism, with a Curie temperature that decreases with the initially
deposited Eu2O3 layer thickness. By adjusting the thickness of the Eu2O3 layer
below 7 nm, we promote the formation of EuO at the very graphene interface: the
EuO/graphene heterostructure demonstrates the anomalous Hall effect (AHE),
which is a fingerprint of proximity-induced spin polarization in graphene. The
AHE signal moreover persists above Tc up to 350K due to a robust
super-paramagnetic phase in EuO. This original high-temperature magnetic phase
is attributed to magnetic polarons in EuO: we propose that the high strain in
our EuO films grown on graphene stabilizes the magnetic polarons up to room
temperature. This effect is different from the case of bulk EuO in which
polarons vanish in the vicinity of the Curie temperature Tc= 69K.

We present an analytic, Mie-theory based solution for the energy-loss and the
photon-emission probabilities in the interaction of spherical nanoparticles
with electrons passing nearby and through them, in both cathodoluminescence
(CL) and electron energy-loss spectroscopies (EELS). In particular, we focus on
the case of penetrating electron trajectories, for which the complete fully
electrodynamic and relativistic formalism has not been reported as yet. We
exhibit the efficiency of this method in describing collective excitations in
matter through calculations for a dispersive and lossy system, namely a sphere
described by a Drude permittivity, and discuss possible complications when
computing contributions from higher-order modes. Subsequently, we use the
analytic solution to corroborate the implementation of electron-beam sources in
a state-of-the-art numerical method methods. We show that the two approaches
produce spectra in good mutual agreement, and demonstrate the versatility of
DGTD via simulations of spherical nanoparticles characterized by surface
roughness. The possibility of simultaneously employing both kinds of
calculations (analytic and numerical) facilitates a better understanding of the
rich optical response of nanophotonic architectures excited by fast electron
beams.

<h3>Electron Spin Polarization as a Predictor of Chiroptical Activity in  Helical Molecules</h3>

<br>
<br>
Chiral structures, breaking spatial inversion symmetry, exhibit non-zero
chiroptical activity (COA) due to the interaction between their electric and
magnetic responses under external electromagnetic fields, an effect that is
otherwise absent in achiral systems. Non-magnetic chiral structures also
exhibit Chiral Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS), where spin-polarization (SP)
emerges without external magnetic influence. We have obtained a COA-SP
connection for a model system of an electron constrained to a helix including
spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and in the presence of an external electromagnetic
field. Despite its simplicity, this model captures the relevant physics
required to address the problem. In particular, our results reveal that the
norm of the SP vector can be used as a predictor of COA. In addition to SOC and
the breaking of space inversion, a non-vanishing SP requires the breaking of
time-reversal symmetry (TRS), as demanded by Onsager's reciprocity. Beyond the
relationship between SP and COA, we obtain the novel result that TRS breaking
is also necessary to yield a non-vanishing contribution of the SOC to the COA.

<h3>Effect of cholesterol on the mechanical stability of gel-phase  phospholipid bilayers studied by AFM force spectroscopy</h3>

<br>
<br>
The low sliding friction of articular cartilage in the major joints , which
is crucial for its homeostasis and for joint health, has been attributed to
lipid bilayers forming lubricious boundary layers at its surface. The
robustness of such layers, and thus their lubrication efficiency at joint
pressures, depends on the lipids forming them, including cholesterol, which may
act to strengthen of weaken the bilayer. A systematic study using an Atomic
Force Microscope (AFM) was carried out to understand the effect of cholesterol
on the nanomechanical stability of two saturated phospholipids, DSPC
(1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidlycholine) and DPPC
(1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-phosphatidylcholine), that differ in acyl chain
lengths. Measurements were carried out both in water and in phosphate buffer
solution (PBS). The nanomechanical stability of the lipid bilayers was
quantitatively evaluated by measuring the breakthrough force needed to puncture
the bilayer by the AFM tip. The molar fractions of cholesterol incorporated in
the bilayers were 10% and 40%. We found that for both DSPC and DPPC,
cholesterol significantly decreases the mechanical stability of the bilayers in
solid ordered (SO) phase. In accordance with the literature, the strengthening
effect of salt on the lipid bilayers was also observed. For DPPC with 10 mol %
cholesterol, the effect of tip properties and the experimental procedure
parameters on the breakthrough forces were also studied. Tip radius (2 - 42
nm), material (Si, Si3N4, Au) and loading rate (40 - 1000 nm/s) were varied
systematically. The values of the breakthrough forces measured were not
significantly affected by any of these parameters, showing that the weakening
effect of cholesterol does not result from such changes in experimental
conditions. This study helps to shed light on the mechanism of physiological
lubrication.

Multi-directional spin-to-charge conversion - in which spin polarizations
with different orientations can be converted into a charge current in the same
direction - has been demonstrated in low-symmetry materials and interfaces.
This is possible because, in these systems, spin to charge conversion can occur
in unconventional configurations in which spin polarization and charge current
where charge current, spin current and polarization do not need to be mutually
orthogonal. Here, we explore, in the low temperature regime, the spin-to-charge
conversion in heterostructures of graphene with the low-symmetry 1T' phase of
MoTe$_2$. First, we observe the emergence of charge conversion for out-of-plane
spins at temperatures below 100 K. This unconventional component is allowed by
the symmetries of both MoTe$_2$ and graphene and likely arises from spin Hall
effect in the spin-orbit proximitized graphene. Moreover, we examine the
low-temperature evolution of non-local voltage signals arising from the charge
conversion of the two in-plane spin polarizations, which have been previously
observed at higher temperature. As a result, we report omni-directional
spin-to-charge conversion - for all spin polarization orientations - in
graphene/MoTe${_2}$ heterostructures at low temperatures.

<h3>Machine-learning potentials for nanoscale simulations of deformation and  fracture: example of TiB$_2$ ceramic</h3>

<br>
<br>
Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) offer a powerful avenue for
simulations beyond length and timescales of ab initio methods. Their
development for investigation of mechanical properties and fracture, however,
is far from trivial since extended defects -- governing plasticity and crack
nucleation in most materials -- are too large to be included in the training
set. Using TiB$_2$ as a model ceramic material, we propose a strategy for
fitting MLIPs suitable to simulate mechanical response of monocrystals until
fracture. Our MLIP accurately reproduces ab initio stresses and failure
mechanisms during room-temperature uniaxial tensile deformation of TiB$_2$ at
the atomic scale ($\approx{10}^3$ atoms). More realistic tensile tests (low
strain rate, Poisson's contraction) at the nanoscale ($\approx{10}^4$--10$^6$
atoms) require MLIP up-fitting, i.e. learning from additional ab initio
configurations. Consequently, we elucidate trends in theoretical strength,
toughness, and crack initiation patterns under different loading directions. To
identify useful environments for further up-fitting, i.e., making the MLIP
applicable to a wider spectrum of simulations, we asses transferability to
other deformation conditions and phases not explicitly trained on.

<h3>Modeling single-molecule stretching experiments using statistical  thermodynamics</h3>

<br>
<br>
Single-molecule stretching experiments are widely utilized within the fields
of physics and chemistry to characterize the mechanics of individual bonds or
molecules, as well as chemical reactions. Analytic relations describing these
experiments are valuable, and these relations can be obtained through the
statistical thermodynamics of idealized model systems representing the
experiments. Since the specific thermodynamic ensembles manifested by the
experiments affect the outcome, primarily for small molecules, the stretching
device must be included in the idealized model system. Though the model for the
stretched molecule might be exactly solvable, including the device in the model
often prevents analytic solutions. In the limit of large or small devices
stiffness, the isometric or isotensional ensembles can provide effective
approximations, but the device effects are missing. Here, a dual set of
asymptotically correct statistical thermodynamic theories are applied to
develop accurate approximations for the full model system that includes both
the molecule and the device. The asymptotic theories are first demonstrated to
be accurate using the freely jointed chain model, and then using molecular
dynamics calculations of a single polyethylene chain.

Using Floquet theory and the hierarchy of correlations, we study the
non-equilibrium dynamics of the Mott insulator state in the Fermi-Hubbard model

<h3>Size effects on atomic collapse in the dice lattice</h3>

<br>
<i>D. O. Oriekhov, S. O. Voronov</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the role of size effects on atomic collapse of charged impurity in
the flat band system. The tight-binding simulations are made for the dice
lattice with circular quantum dot shapes. It is shown that the mixing of in-gap
edge states with bound states in impurity potential leads to increasing the
critical charge value. This effect, together with enhancement of gap due to
spatial quantization, makes it more difficult to observe the
dive-into-continuum phenomenon in small quantum dots. At the same time, we show
that if in-gap states are filled, the resonant tunneling to bound state in the
impurity potential might occur at much smaller charge, which demonstrates
non-monotonous dependence with the size of sample lattice. In addition, we
study the possibility of creating supercritical localized potential well on
different sublattices, and show that it is possible only on rim sites, but not
on hub site. The predicted effects are expected to naturally occur in
artificial flat band lattices.

<h3>Energy transport between heat baths with oscillating temperatures</h3>

<br>
<i>Renai Chen, Tammie Gibson, Galen T. Craven</i>
<br>
<br>
Energy transport is a fundamental physical process that plays a prominent
role in the function and performance of myriad systems and technologies. Recent
experimental measurements have shown that subjecting a macroscale system to a
time-periodic temperature gradient can increase thermal conductivity in
comparison to a static temperature gradient. Here, we theoretically examine
this mechanism in a nanoscale model by applying a stochastic Langevin framework
to describe the energy transport properties of a particle connecting two heat
baths with different temperatures, where the temperature difference between
baths is oscillating in time. Analytical expressions for the energy flux of
each heat bath and for the system itself are derived for the case of a free
particle and a particle in a harmonic potential. We find that dynamical effects
in the energy flux induced by temperature oscillations give rise to complex
energy transport hysteresis effects. The presented results suggest that
applying time-periodic temperature modulations is a potential route to control
energy storage and release in molecular devices and nanosystems.

<h3>Theoretical investigation on potential of zero free charge of (111) and  (100) surfaces of Group 10 and 11 metals</h3>

<br>
<i>Jack Jon Hinsch, Jessica Jein White, Yun Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
The potential of zero free charge (PZFC) value is a crucial parameter in
electrochemistry. However, the evaluations of PZFC have traditionally been
difficult. To overcome this challenge, we applied a hybrid solvation method
that incorporates, both an explicit water layer next to the metal surface and
an implicit water layer, combined with density functional theory (DFT) to
simplify the PZFC evaluation. Using the (111) and (100) surfaces of Group 10
and 11 metals as model systems, we calculated their PZFC values, which showed
excellent agreement with the reported data. This great match validates the
accuracy and reliability of our theoretical approach. Notably, we observed that
the surface structure and the orientation of water molecules have a significant
influence on the PZFC values of the metals. Our study, therefore, paves the way
for efficiently and accurately calculating the PZFC values of materials, which
can greatly benefit their practical applications.

<br>
<br>
While the surface-bulk correspondence has been ubiquitously shown in
topological phases, the relationship between surface and bulk in Landau-like
phases is much less explored. Theoretical investigations since 1970s for
semi-infinite systems have predicted the possibility of the surface order
emerging at a higher temperature than the bulk, clearly illustrating a
counterintuitive situation and greatly enriching phase transitions. But
experimental realizations of this prediction remain missing. Here, we
demonstrate the higher-temperature surface and lower-temperature bulk phase
transitions in CrSBr, a van der Waals (vdW) layered antiferromagnet. We
leverage the surface sensitivity of electric dipole second harmonic generation
(SHG) to resolve surface magnetism, the bulk nature of electric quadrupole SHG
to probe bulk spin correlations, and their interference to capture the two
magnetic domain states. Our density functional theory calculations show the
suppression of ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic competition at the surface
responsible for this enhanced surface magnetism. Our results not only show
unexpected, richer phase transitions in vdW magnets, but also provide viable
ways to enhance magnetism in their 2D form.

<br>
We measure the thermal conductivity of solid and molten tungsten using Steady
State Temperature Differential Radiometry. We demonstrate that the thermal
conductivity can be well described by application of Wiedemann-Franz Law to
electrical resistivity data, thus suggesting the validity of Wiedemann-Franz
Law to capture the electronic thermal conductivity of metals in their molten
phase. We further support this conclusion using ab initio molecular dynamics
simulations with a machine-learned potential. Our results show that at these
high temperatures, the vibrational contribution to thermal conductivity is
negligible compared to the electronic component.

<h3>Geometry, mechanics and actuation of intrinsically curved folds</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01088" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01088</a>
<br>
<i>Fan Feng, Klaudia Dradrach, Michał Zmyślony, Morgan Barnes, John S. Biggins</i>
<br>
<br>
We combine theory and experiments to explore the kinematics and actuation of
intrinsically curved folds (ICFs) in otherwise developable shells. Unlike
origami folds, ICFs are not bending isometries of flat sheets, but arise via
non-isometric processes (growth/moulding) or by joining sheets along curved
boundaries. Experimentally, we implement both, first making joined ICFs from
paper, then fabricating flat liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) sheets that morph
into ICFs upon heating/swelling via programmed metric changes. Theoretically,
an ICF's intrinsic geometry is defined by the geodesic curvatures on either
side, $\kappa_{g_i}$. Given these, and a target 3D fold-line, one can construct
the entire surface isometrically, and compute the bending energy. This
construction shows ICFs are bending mechanisms, with a continuous family of
isometries trading fold angle against fold-line curvature. In ICFs with
symmetric $\kappa_{g_i}$, straightening the fold-line culminates in a
fully-folded flat state that is deployable but weak, while asymmetric ICFs
ultimately lock with a mechanically strong finite-angle. When unloaded,
freely-hinged ICFs simply adopt the (thickness $t$ independent) isometry that
minimizes the bend energy. In contrast, in LCE ICFs a competition between flank
and ridge selects a ridge curvature that, unusually, scales as $t^{-1/7}$.
Finally, we demonstrate how multiple ICFs can be combined in one LCE sheet, to
create a versatile stretch-strong gripper that lifts $\sim$40x its own weight.

<h3>Study of vacancy ordering and the boson peak in metastable cubic  Ge-Sb-Te using machine learning potentials</h3>

<br>
<i>Young-Jae Choi, Minjae Ghim, Seung-Hoon Jhi</i>
<br>
<br>
The mechanism of the vacancy ordering in metastable cubic Ge-Sb-Te
\mbox{(c-GST)} that underlies the ultrafast phase-change dynamics and prominent
thermoelectric properties remains elusive. Achieving a comprehensive
understanding of the vacancy-ordering process at an atomic level is challenging
because of enormous computational demands required to simulate disordered
structures on large temporal and spatial scales. In this study, we investigate
the vacancy ordering in \mbox{c-GST} by performing large-scale molecular
dynamics simulations using machine learning potentials. The initial
\mbox{c-GST} structure with randomly distributed vacancies rearranges to
develop a semi-ordered cubic structure with layer-like ordered vacancies after
annealing at 700~K for 100~ns. The vacancy ordering significantly affects the
lattice dynamical properties of \mbox{c-GST}. In the initial structure with
fully disordered vacancies, we observe a boson peak, usually associated with
amorphous solids, that consists of localized modes at $\sim$0.575~THz. As
vacancies become ordered, the boson peak disappears and the Debye-Waller
thermal \textit{B} factor of Te decreases substantially. This finding indicates
that the \mbox{c-GST} undergoes a transition from amorphous-like to
crystalline-like solid state by thermal annealing in low-frequency dynamics.

<br>
A numerical model based on a lumped circuit element approximation for a
bi-superconducting quantum interference device (bi-SQUID) operating in the
presence of an external magnetic field is presented in this paper. Included in
the model is the novel ability to capture the resultant behaviour of the device
when a strong electric field is applied to its Josephson junctions by utilising
gate electrodes. The model is used to simulate an all-metallic SNS (Al-Cu-Al)
bi-SQUID, where good agreement is observed between the simulated results and
the experimental data. The results discussed in this work suggest that the
primary consequences of the superconducting field effect induced by the gating
of the Josephson junctions are accounted for in our minimal model; namely, the
suppression of the junctions super-current. Although based on a simplified
model, our results can potentially help with the task of clarifying the
microscopic origin of this effect. Also, the possible applications of this
effect regarding the operation of SQUIDs as ultra-high precision sensors, where
the performance of such devices can be improved via careful tuning of the
applied gate voltages, are discussed at the end of the paper.

<br>
<br>
Motivated by the recent progress in realizing and controlling extended
Bose-Hubbard systems using excitonic or atomic devices, the present Letter
theoretically investigates the case of a two-band Bose-Hubbard chain with
nearest-neighbor interactions. Specifically, this study concentrates on the
scenario where, due to the interactions, one band supports a density wave
phase, i.e. a correlated insulating phase with spontaneous breaking of
translational symmetry in the lattice, while the other band supports superfluid
behavior. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we show that
supersolid order can emerge from such a combination, that is, an elusive
quantum state that combines crystalline order with long-range phase coherence.
Depending on the filling of the bands and the interband interaction strength,
the supersolid phase competes with phase-separation, superfluid order, or Mott
insulating density-wave order. As a possible setup to observe supersolidity, we
propose the combination of a lower band supporting density-wave order and a
thermally excited band that supports superfluidity due to weaker lattice
confinement.

The ideal strength is crucial for predicting material behavior under extreme
conditions, which can provide insights into material limits, guide design and
engineer for enhanced performance and durability. In this work, we present a
method within an allows for the estimation of tensile, shear, and indentation
strengths in any crystallographic direction or plane. We have examined the
strain-stress relationships of several well-known structures and compared our
findings with previous work, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.
Moreover, we performed extensive investigations into the indentation strength
of hexagonal WC, \b{eta}-SiC, and MgA$l_2O_4$. The current study uncovers the
modes of structural deformation and the underlying atomistic mechanisms. The
insights gained from this study have significant implications for the further

<i>Yi-Cai Zhang, J.M. Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we investigate energy bands in a three dimensional simple cubic
lattice of contact potential. The energy bands in the first Brillouin Zone are
obtained with Ewald's summation method. In comparison with single point
potential, the presence of lattice potential changes the existence condition of
negative energy states near zero energy. It is found that the system always has
negative energy states for an arbitrarily weak periodic potential. In addition,
we prove that if an irreducible unitary representation is not a trivial
representation of group of wave vector, the corresponding wave functions at
lattice sites would be zero. With this theorem, the degeneracy of energy bands
is explained with group theory. Furthermore, we find that there exists some
energy bands which are not affected by the lattice potential. We call their
corresponding eigenstates as dark states. The physical mechanism of the dark
states is explained by explicitly constructing the standing wave-type Bloch
wave functions.

<br>
Owing to the trade-off between the accuracy and efficiency,
machine-learning-potentials (MLPs) have been widely applied in the battery
materials science, enabling atomic-level dynamics description for various
critical processes. However, the challenge arises when dealing with complex
transition metal (TM) oxide cathode materials, as multiple possibilities of
d-orbital electrons localization often lead to convergence to different spin
states (or equivalently local minimums with respect to the spin configurations)
after ab initio self-consistent-field calculations, which causes a significant
obstacle for training MLPs of cathode materials. In this work, we introduce a
solution by incorporating an additional feature - atomic spins - into the
descriptor, based on the pristine deep potential (DP) model, to address the
above issue by distinguishing different spin states of TM ions. We demonstrate
that our proposed scheme provides accurate descriptions for the potential
energies of a variety of representative cathode materials, including the
traditional Li$_x$TMO$_2$ (TM=Ni, Co, Mn, $x$=0.5 and 1.0), Li-Ni anti-sites in
Li$_x$NiO$_2$ ($x$=0.5 and 1.0), cobalt-free high-nickel
Li$_x$Ni$_{1.5}$Mn$_{0.5}$O$_4$ ($x$=1.5 and 0.5), and even a ternary cathode
material Li$_x$Ni$_{1/3}$Co$_{1/3}$Mn$_{1/3}$O$_2$ ($x$=1.0 and 0.67). We
highlight that our approach allows the utilization of all ab initio results as
a training dataset, regardless of the system being in a spin ground state or
not. Overall, our proposed approach paves the way for efficiently training MLPs
for complex TM oxide cathode materials.

The latest discovery of high temperature superconductivity near 80K in
La3Ni2O7 under high pressure has attracted much attention. Many proposals are
put forth to understand the origin of superconductivity. The determination of
electronic structures is a prerequisite to establish theories to understand
superconductivity in nickelates but is still lacking. Here we report our direct
measurement of the electronic structures of La3Ni2O7 by high-resolution
angle-resolved photoemmission spectroscopy. The Fermi surface and band
structures of La3Ni2O7 are observed and compared with the band structure
calculations. A flat band is formed from the Ni-3dz2 orbitals around the zone
corner which is 50meV below the Fermi level. Strong electron correlations are
revealed which are orbital- and momentum-dependent. Our observations will
provide key information to understand the origin of high temperature
superconductivity in La3Ni2O7.

The oxygen vacancy formation energy ($\Delta E_{vf}$) governs defect dynamics
and is a useful metric to perform materials selection for a variety of
applications. However, density functional theory (DFT) calculations of $\Delta
E_{vf}$ come at a greater computational cost than the typical bulk calculations
available in materials databases due to the involvement of multiple
vacancy-containing supercells. As a result, available repositories of direct
calculations of $\Delta E_{vf}$ remain relatively scarce, and the development
of machine learning models capable of delivering accurate predictions is of
interest. In the present, work we address both such points. We first report the
results of new high-throughput DFT calculations of oxygen vacancy formation
energies of the different unique oxygen sites in over 1000 different oxide
materials, which together form the largest dataset of directly computed oxygen
vacancy formation energies to date, to our knowledge. We then utilize the
resulting dataset of $\sim$2500 $\Delta E_{vf}$ values to train random forest
models with different sets of features, examining both novel features
introduced in this work and ones previously employed in the literature. We
demonstrate the benefits of including features that contain information
specific to the vacancy site and account for both cation identity and oxidation
state, and achieve a mean absolute error upon prediction of $\sim$0.3 eV/O,
which is comparable to the accuracy observed upon comparison of DFT
computations of oxygen vacancy formation energy and experimental results.
Finally, we demonstrate the predictive power of the developed models in the
search for new compounds for solar-thermochemical water-splitting applications,
finding over 250 new AA$^{\prime}$BB$^{\prime}$O$_6$ double perovskite
candidates.

We study an analytically solvable and experimentally relevant

found to support generalized Majorana zero and $\pi$ modes which, despite being
non-Hermitian, are still capable of encoding qubits. Moreover, appropriate
winding numbers characterizing the topology of such generalized Majorana modes
are defined and explicitly calculated. We further discuss the fate of the
obtained generalized Majorana modes in the presence of finite charging energy.
Finally, we shed light on the quantum computing prospects of such modes by
demonstrating the robustness of their encoded qubits and explicitly braiding a

Kagome lattices have emerged as an ideal platform for exploring various
exotic quantum phenomena such as correlated topological phases, frustrated

phases, superconductivity, etc. In particular, the vanadium based nonmagnetic
kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A= K, Rb, and Cs) have seen a flurry of research interest
due to the discovery of multiple competing orders. Here, we report the
discovery of a new Ti based kagome metal YbTi3Bi4 and employ angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), magnetotransport in combination with
density functional theory calculations to investigate its electronic structure.
We reveal spectroscopic evidence of multiple flat bands arising from the kagome
lattice of Ti with predominant Ti 3d character. Through our calculations of the
Z2 indices, we have identified that the system exhibits topological
nontriviality with surface Dirac cones at the Gamma point and a quasi
two-dimensional Dirac state at the K point which is further confirmed by our
ARPES measured band dispersion. These results establish YbTi3Bi4 as a novel
platform for exploring the intersection of nontrivial topology, and electron
correlation effects in this newly discovered Ti based kagome lattice.

We report the crystal growth and characterization of a rare-earth-containing
ternary material, Dy3.1(3)Pt2.0(7)Sb3.8(4). This compound possesses a similar
structure to the previously reported Y3Pt4Ge6, but lacks two layers of Pt
atoms. Crystallographic disorder was found in Dy3.1Pt2.0Sb3.8. Additionally,
the Dy-Dy framework was found to have both square net and triangular lattices.
Dy3.1Pt2.0Sb3.8 was determined to be antiferromagnetically ordered around ~15 K
while a competing antiferromagnetic sublattice also exists at lower
temperature. Strong magnetic anisotropy was observed and several metamagnetic
transitions were seen in the hysteresis loops. Furthermore, the Curie-Weiss
fitting revealed unusually small effective moment of Dy, which is far below the
expected value of Dy2+ (10.6 muB), Dy3+ (10.65 muB) and Dy4+ (9.72 muB). This
novel material might provide a new platform to study the relation between

Learning the electron scattering around atomic impurities is a fundamental
step to fully understand the basic electronic transport properties of realistic
conducting materials. Although many efforts have been made in this field for
several decades, atomic scale transport around single point-like impurities has
yet been achieved. Here, we report the direct visualization of the electric
current induced dipoles around single atomic impurities in epitaxial bilayer
graphene by multi-probe low temperature scanning tunneling potentiometry as the
local current density is raised up to around 25 A/m, which is considerably
higher than that in previous studies. We find the directions of these dipoles
which are parallel or anti-parallel to local current are determined by the
charge polarity of the impurities, revealing the direct evidence for the
existence of the carrier density modulation effect proposed by Landauer in
1976. Furthermore, by $in$ $situ$ tuning local current direction with contact
probes, these dipoles are redirected correspondingly. Our work paves the way to
explore the electronic quantum transport phenomena at single atomic impurity
level and the potential future electronics toward or beyond the end of Moore's
Law.

Phase diagrams serve as a highly informative tool for materials design,
encapsulating information about the phases that a material can manifest under
specific conditions. In this work, we develop a method in which Bayesian
inference is employed to combine thermodynamic data from molecular dynamics
(MD), melting point simulations, and phonon calculations, process these data,
and yield a temperature-concentration phase diagram. The employed Bayesian
framework yields us not only the free energies of different phases as functions
of temperature and concentration but also the uncertainties of these free
energies originating from statistical errors inherent to finite-length MD
trajectories. Furthermore, it extrapolates the results of the finite-atom
calculations to the infinite-atom limit and facilitates the choice of
temperature, chemical potentials, and the number of atoms conducting the next
simulation with which will be the most efficient in reducing the uncertainty of
the phase diagram. The developed algorithm was successfully tested on two
binary systems, Ge-Si and K-Na, in the full range of concentrations and
temperatures.

Experimental data show that under pressure, Gd goes through a series of
structural transitions hcp to Sm-type (close-packed rhombohedral) to dhcp that
is accompanied by a gradual decrease of the Curie temperature and magnetization
till the collapse of a finite magnetization close to the dhcp structure. We
explore theoretically the pressure-induced changes of the magnetic properties,
by describing these structural transitions as the formation of fcc stackings
faults. Using this approach, we are able to describe correctly the variation of
the Curie temperature with pressure, in contrast to a static structural model
using the hcp structure.

<h3>Study on Susceptibilities of Superconductors BaPtSb and BaPtAs with  Honeycomb Structure</h3>

The low-energy electronic properties of the new superconductors BaPtSb and
BaPtAs with an ordered honeycomb network are investigated in the normal phase,
where the former compound is a candidate for time-reversal symmetry-breaking
superconductors. By means of the first-principles calculation, we show that
there exist two-dimensional cylinder-like Fermi surfaces around the kz axis and
one outer spherelike Fermi surface around the K and K' points in both
compounds, which are mainly composed of Pt 5d and Sb 5p/As 4p electrons. We
construct low-energy effective models, which are well described by using three
bands consisting of two Pt 5d orbitals and one Sb 5p/As 4p orbital. By
evaluating susceptibilities using effective models, we find that dominant
contributions to those susceptibilities result from the outer spherelike Fermi
surface. Whereas out-of-plane fluctuations are enhanced in both compounds in
the higher-temperature region, in-plane fluctuations become dominant in the
very low-temperature region in BaPtSb owing to a better nesting condition in
the k_z=0 plane from the outer spherelike Fermi surface. These fluctuations
yield instabilities to ordered states, such as superconductivity, and might be
associated with the occurrence of the superconducting state with time-reversal
symmetry breaking in BaPtSb.

The electron's charge and spin degrees of freedom are at the core of modern
electronic devices. With the in-depth investigation of two-dimensional
materials, another degree of freedom, valley, has also attracted tremendous
research interest. The intrinsic spontaneous valley polarization in
two-dimensional magnetic systems, ferrovalley material, provides convenience
for detecting and modulating the valley. In this review, we first introduce the
development of valleytronics. Then, the valley polarization forms by the p, d,
and f-orbit that are discussed. Following, we discuss the investigation
progress of modulating the valley polarization of two-dimensional ferrovalley
materials by multiple physical fields, such as electric, stacking mode, strain,
and interface. Finally, we look forward to the future developments of
valleytronics.

In the creation of Hopf topological matters, the old paradigm is to conceive
the Hopf invariant first, and then display its intuitive topology through
links. Here we brush aside this effort and put forward a new recipe for
unraveling the quenched two-dimensional (2D) two-band Chern insulators under a
parallel quench protocol, which implies that the quench quantities with
different momentum k are parallel or antiparallel to each other. We find that
whether the dynamical Hopf invariant exists or not, the links in (2+1)D space
always keep their standard shape even for topological initial states, and trace
out the trajectories of phase vortices. The linking number is exactly equal to
the difference between pre- and post-quench Chern numbers regardless of the
construction of homotopy groups. We employ two concrete examples to illustrate
these results, highlighting the polarity reversal at fixed points.

Modulation of electronic properties of materials by electric fields is
central to the operation of modern semiconductor devices, providing access to
complex electronic behaviors and greater freedom in tuning the energy bands of
materials. Here, we explore one-dimensional superlattices induced by a
confining electrostatic potential in monolayer MoS$_2$, a prototypical
two-dimensional semiconductor. Using first-principles calculations, we show
that periodic potentials applied to monolayer MoS$_2$ induce electrostatic
superlattices in which the response is dominated by structural distortions
relative to purely electronic effects. These structural distortions reduce the
intrinsic band gap of the monolayer substantially while also polarizing the
monolayer through piezoelectric coupling, resulting in spatial separation of
charge carriers as well as Stark shifts that produce dispersive minibands.
Importantly, these minibands inherit the valley-selective magnetic properties
of monolayer MoS$_2$, enabling fine control over spin-valley coupling in
MoS$_2$ and similar transition-metal dichalcogenides.

<br>
Semiconductor nanowires coupled to a superconductor provide a powerful
testbed for quantum device physics such as Majorana zero modes and gate-tunable
hybrid qubits. The performance of these quantum devices heavily relies on the
quality of the induced superconducting gap. A hard gap, evident as vanishing
subgap conductance in tunneling spectroscopy, is both necessary and desired.
Previously, a hard gap has been achieved and extensively studied in III-V
semiconductor nanowires (InAs and InSb). In this study, we present the
observation of a hard superconducting gap in PbTe nanowires coupled to a
superconductor Pb. The gap size ($\Delta$) is $\sim$ 1 meV (maximally 1.3 meV
in one device). Additionally, subgap Andreev bound states can also be created
and controlled through gate tuning. Tuning a device into the open regime can
reveal Andreev enhancement of the subgap conductance, suggesting a remarkable
transparent superconductor-semiconductor interface, with a transparency of
$\sim$ 0.96. These results pave the way for diverse superconducting quantum
devices based on PbTe nanowires.

<h3>Energy Spectrum Theory of Incommensurate Systems</h3>

Due to the lack of the translational symmetry, calculating the energy
spectrum of an incommensurate system has always been a theoretical challenge.
Here, we propose a natural approach to generalize the energy band theory to the
incommensurate systems without reliance on the commensurate approximation, thus
providing a comprehensive energy spectrum theory of the incommensurate systems.
Except for a truncation dependent weighting factor, the formulae of this theory
are formally almost identical to that of the Bloch electrons, making it
particularly suitable for complex incommensurate structures. To illustrate the
application of this theory, we give three typical examples: one-dimensional
bichromatic and trichromatic incommensurate potential model, as well as a
moir\'{e} quasicrystal. Our theory establishes a fundamental framework for
understanding the incommensurate systems.

Intuitive entropic interpretations of the thermoelectric effect in metals
predict an isotropic Seebeck coefficient at high temperatures in the incoherent
regime even in anisotropic metals since entropy is not directional.
$\mathrm{Sr}_2\mathrm{Ru}\mathrm{O}_4$ is an enigmatic material known for a
well characterised anisotropic normal state and unconventional
superconductivity. Recent ab-initio transport calculations of
$\mathrm{Sr}_2\mathrm{Ru}\mathrm{O}_4$ that include the effect of strong
electronic correlations predicted an enhanced high-temperature anisotropy of
the Seebeck coefficient at temperatures above 300 K, but experimental evidence
is missing. From measurements on clean $\mathrm{Sr}_2\mathrm{Ru}\mathrm{O}_4$
single crystals along both crystallographic directions, we find that the
Seebeck coefficient becomes increasingly isotropic upon heating towards room
temperature as generally expected. Above 300 K, however, $S$ acquires a new
anisotropy which rises up to the highest temperatures measured (750 K), in
qualitative agreement with calculations. This is a challenge to entropic
interpretations and highlights the lack of an intuitive framework to understand
the anisotropy of thermopower at high temperatures.

<h3>Classification of Lifshitz invariant in multiband superconductors: an  application to Leggett modes in the linear response regime in Kagome lattice  models</h3>

<br>
<br>
Multiband superconductors are sources of rich physics arising from multiple
order parameters, which show unique collective dynamics including Leggett mode
as relative phase oscillations. Previously, it has been pointed out that the
Leggett mode can be optically excited in the linear response regime, as
demonstrated in a one-dimensional model for multiband superconductors[T.
Kamatani, et al., Phys. Rev. B 105, 094520 (2022)]. Here we identify the linear
coupling term in the Ginzburg-Landau free energy to be the so-called Lifshitz
invariant, which takes a form of
$\boldsymbol{d}\cdot\left(\Psi^{*}_{i}\nabla\Psi_{j} -
\Psi_{j}\nabla\Psi^{*}_{i}\right)$, where $\boldsymbol{d}$ is a constant vector
and $\Psi_{i}$ and $\Psi_{j}$ $(i\neq j)$ represent superconducting order
parameters. We have classified all pairs of irreducible representations of
order parameters in the crystallographic point groups that allow for the
existence of the Lifshitz invariant. We emphasize that the Lifshitz invariant
can appear even in systems with inversion symmetry. The results are applied to
a model of $s$-wave superconductors on a Kagome lattice with various bond
orders, for which in some cases we confirm that the Leggett mode appears as a
resonance peak in a linear optical conductivity spectrum based on microscopic
calculations. We discuss a possible experimental observation of the Leggett
mode by a linear optical response in multiband superconductors.

<h3>A python tool to determine the thickness of the hydrate layer around  clinker grains using SEM-BSE images</h3>

<br>
To accurately simulate the hydration process of cementitious materials,
understanding the growth rate of C-S-H layers around clinker grains is crucial.
Nonetheless, the thickness of the hydrate layer shows substantial variation
around individual grains, depending on their surrounding. Consequently, it is
not feasible to measure hydrate layers manually in a reliable and reproducible
manner. To address this challenge, a software has been developed to
statistically determine the C-S-H thickness, requiring minimal manual
interventions for thresholding and for setting limits like particle size or
circularity.
This study presents a tool, which automatically identifies suitable clinker
grains and and perform statistical measurements of their hydrate layer up to a
specimen age of 28 days. The findings reveal a significant increase in the
C-S-H layer, starting from 0.45 micrometer after 1 day and reaching 3.04
micrometer after 28 days. However, for older specimens, the measurement of the
C-S-H layer was not feasible due to limited pore space and clinker grains.

<h3>Middle-obstacle approach of mapping phase-field model unto its sharp  interface counterpart</h3>

A new diffuse interface model has been proposed in this study for simulating
binary alloy solidification under universal cooling conditions, involving both
equilibrium and non-equilibrium solute partitioning. Starting from the
Gibbs-Thomson equation, which is the classical theory that describes the
dynamics of a sharp interface, the phase-field equation is derived using a
traveling wave solution that represents a diffuse interface. To tackle the
spurious effects caused by the variation of liquid concentration within the
diffuse interface with artificial width, a middle obstacle is introduced to
sharpen the diffuse interface and an invariant liquid concentration can be
found for determining a constant undercooling in the interface normal
direction. For slow solidification under equilibrium conditions, the
convergence performance of the dendrite tip shows superior invulnerability to
the width effect of the diffuse interface. For rapid solidification under
non-equilibrium conditions, the output partition coefficients obtained from the
steady-state concentration profiles agree with the input velocity-dependent
function. The proposed model is promising to be an indispensable tool for the
development of advanced alloy materials through the microstructure control of
solidification under a wide range of cooling conditions.

<h3>One-dimensional topological channels in heterostrained bilayer graphene</h3>

The domain walls between AB- and BA-stacked gapped bilayer graphene have
garnered intense interest as they host topologically-protected,
valley-polarised transport channels. The introduction of a twist angle between
the bilayers and the associated formation of a Moire pattern has been the
dominant method used to study these topological channels, but heterostrain can
also give rise to similar stacking domains and interfaces. Here, we
theoretically study the electronic structure of a uniaxially heterostrained
bilayer graphene. We discuss the formation and evolution of interface-localized
channels in the one-dimensional Moire pattern that emerges due to the different
stacking registries between the two layers. We find that a uniform heterostrain
is not sufficient to create one-dimensional topological channels in biased
bilayer graphene. Instead, using a simple model to account for the in-plane
atomic reconstruction driven by the changing stacking registry, we show that
the resulting expanded Bernal-stacked domains and sharper interfaces are
required for robust topological interfaces to emerge. These states are highly
localised in the AA- or SP-stacked interface regions and exhibit differences in
their layer and sublattice distribution depending on the interface stacking. We
conclude that heterostrain can be used as a mechanism to tune the presence and
distribution of topological channels in gapped bilayer graphene systems,
complementary to the field of twistronics.

Cellulose, as naturally abundant and biocompatible material, is still gaining
interest due to its high potential for functionalization. This makes cellulose
a promising candidate for replacing plastic. To accomplish a comparable range
of properties, as is the case for plastics, a generalized understanding of the
interaction between the cellulose fiber and the large variety of applicable
additives is essential. By using a well-defined cellulose model surface, we
investigated the adsorption and desorption of two different polymeric particles
to the cellulose surface. The particles were characterized regarding their pH
dependent charge behavior by zeta potential measurements and their structural
morphology using indentation AFM measurements. We quantified the adsorption and
desorption of the particles on the CMS using AFM topography measurements.
Complementary to the standard AFM measurements, we quantified the force that is
necessary to move individual particles on the CMS by peak force AFM
measurements. Both the particles (CSP and MG) and the CMS possess a pH
dependent charge behavior, leading to a tunable interaction between particles
and CMS. The adsorption of the particles is irreversible and dominated by
electrostatic interactions stemming from the charge of both CMS and particles.
The desorption as well as the force to move individual particles is neither
dominated by the electrostatic interaction nor the total contact area of the
particles on the CMS. In addition, we found that an annealing procedure
consisting of swelling/drying cycles significantly increased the adhesion
strength of both particles up to five fold. Using the data, we created an
understanding of the interaction of cellulose with polymeric particles, with
the potential to advance the development of functional materials and contribute
to various fields, including smart packaging, sensors, and biomedical
applications.

Symmetry plays a key role in classifying topological phases. Recent theory
shows that in the presence of gauge fields, the algebraic structure of
crystalline symmetries needs to be projectively represented, which enables
unprecedented topological band physics. Here, we report a concrete acoustic
realization of mirror Chern insulators by exploiting the concept of projective
symmetry. More specifically, we introduce a simple but universal recipe for
constructing projective mirror symmetry, and conceive a minimal model for
achieving the projective symmetry-enriched mirror Chern insulators. Based on
our selective-excitation measurements, we demonstrate unambiguously the
projective mirror eigenvalue-locked topological nature of the bulk states and
associated chiral edge states. More importantly, we extract the non-abelian
Berry curvature and identify the mirror Chern number directly, as conclusive
experimental evidence for this exotic topological phase. All experimental
results agree well with the theoretical predictions. Our findings will shine
new light on the topological systems equipped with gauge fields.

Nodal-line semimetal is commonly believed to exist in $\mathcal{PT}$

parameter-dimensional second-order nodal-line semimetal (SONLS), which has the
coexisting hinge Fermi arcs and drumhead surface states, in a two-dimensional
system without $\mathcal{PT}$ and mirror-rotation symmetries. Meanwhile, we
discover a flux-induced second-order topological insulator (SOTI). Then we
artificially create exotic hybrid-order nodal-line semimetals with fruitful
nodal-line structures hosted by different quasienergy gaps and widely tunable
numbers of corner states by applying a periodic driving on our SONLS and SOTI,
respectively. Such Floquet engineered high tunability of the orders and the
nodal-line structures of the SONLS and the corner-state number of SOTI sets up
a foundation on exploring their further applications.

Many types of peripheral and transmembrane proteins can sense and generate
membrane curvature. Laterally isotropic proteins and crescent proteins with
two-fold rotational symmetry, such as Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs superfamily proteins,
have been studied theoretically. However, proteins often have an asymmetric
structure or a higher rotational symmetry. We theoretically studied the
curvature sensing of proteins with asymmetric structures and structural
deformations. First, we examined proteins consisting of two rod-like segments.
When proteins have mirror symmetry, their sensing ability is similar to that of
single-rod proteins, and second- or first-order transition occurs on the
cylindrical membrane of a middle or small radius, respectively. As asymmetry is
introduced, this transition becomes a continuous change, and metastable states
appear at high protein densities. Protein with three-, five-, or more-fold
rotational symmetry has laterally isotropic bending energy. However, when an
asymmetric structural deformation is allowed, they can have a preferred
orientation and stronger curvature sensing.

The requirements for broadband photodetection are becoming exceedingly
demanding in hyperspectral imaging. Whilst intrinsic photoconductor arrays
based on mercury cadmium telluride represent the most sensitive and suitable
technology, their optical spectrum imposes a narrow spectral range with a sharp
absorption edge that cuts their operation to < 25 um. Here, we demonstrate a
giant ultra-broadband photoconductivity in twisted double bilayer graphene
heterostructures spanning a spectral range of 2 - 100 um with internal quantum
efficiencies ~ 40 % at speeds of 100 kHz. The giant response originates from
unique properties of twist-decoupled heterostructures including pristine,
crystal field induced terahertz band gaps, parallel photoactive channels, and
strong photoconductivity enhancements caused by interlayer screening of
electronic interactions by respective layers acting as sub-atomic spaced
proximity screening gates. Our work demonstrates a rare instance of an
intrinsic infrared-terahertz photoconductor that is complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor compatible and array integratable, and introduces
twist-decoupled graphene heterostructures as a viable route for engineering

The interplay between symmetry and topology led to the concept of
symmetry-protected topological states, including all non-interacting and weakly
interacting topological quantum states. Among them, recently proposed nodal
line semimetal states with space-time inversion ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry which
are classified by the Stiefel-Whitney characteristic class associated with real
vector bundles and can carry a nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ monopole charge have
attracted widespread attention. However, we know less about such 3D
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ nodal line semimetals and do not know how to construct them. In
this work, we first extend the layer construction previously used to construct
topological insulating states to topological semimetallic systems. We construct
3D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ nodal line semimetals by stacking of 2D
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Dirac semimetals via nonsymmorphic symmetries. Based
on our construction scheme, effective model and combined with first-principles
calculations, we predict two types of candidate electronic materials for
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ nodal line semimetals, namely 14 Si and Ge structures and 108
transition metal dichalcogenides $MX_2$ ($M$=Cr, Mo, W, $X$=S, Se, Te). Our
theoretical construction scheme can be directly applied to metamaterials and
circuit systems. Our work not only greatly enriches the candidate materials and
deepens the understanding of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ nodal line semimetal states but
also significantly extends the application scope of layer construction.

Lee-Huang-Yang-type interaction, employing a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D)
trap in a way distinct from that in the pioneering experiment, M. A. Norcia et.
al., Nature 596, 357 (2021), where the polarization z direction was taken to be
perpendicular to the quasi-2D x-y plane. In the present study we take the
polarization z direction in the quasi-2D x-z plane. Employing the same trapping
frequencies as in the experiment, and interchanging the frequencies along the y
and z directions, we find the formation of mini droplets for number of atoms N
as small as N = 1000. With the increase of number of atoms, a
spatially-periodic supersolid-like one-dimensional array of mega droplets
containing 50000 to 200000 atoms are formed along the x direction in the x-y
plane. These mega droplets are elongated along the polarization z direction,
consequently, the spatially periodic arrangement of droplets appears as a
stripe pattern in the x-z plane. To establish the supersolidity of the droplets
we demonstrate continued dipole-mode and scissors-mode oscillations of the
droplet-lattice pattern. The main findings of the present study can be tested
experimentally with the present know-how.

Magnetic topological quantum materials display a diverse range of fascinating
physical properties which arise from their intrinsic magnetism and the breaking
of time-reversal symmetry. However, so far, few examples of intrinsic magnetic
topological materials have been confirmed experimentally, which significantly
hinder our comprehensive understanding of the abundant physical properties in
this system. The kagome lattices, which host diversity of electronic structure
signatures such as Dirac nodes, flat bands, and saddle points, provide an
alternative and promising platform for in-depth investigations into
correlations and band topology. In this article, drawing inspiration from the
stacking configuration of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, we conceive and then synthesize a
high-quality single crystal EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$, which is a unique natural
heterostructure consisting of both topological kagome layers and magnetic
interlayers. We investigate the electronic structure of EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$ and
uncover distinct features of anisotropic multiple Van Hove singularitie (VHS)
that might prevent Fermi surface nesting, leading to the absence of a charge
density wave (CDW). In addition, we identify the topological nontrivial surface
states that serve as connections between different saddle bands in the vicinity
of the Fermi level. Combined with calculations, we establish that, the
effective time-reversal symmetry S=$\theta$$\tau_{1/2}$ play a crucial role in
the antiferromagnetic ground state of EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$, which ensures the
stability of the topological surface states and gives rise to their intriguing
topological nature. Therefore, EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$ offers the rare opportunity to
investigate correlated topological states in magnetic kagome materials.

Geometric phase analysis (GPA) is a widely used technique for extracting
displacement and strain fields from scanning probe images. Here, we demonstrate
that GPA should be implemented with caution when several fundamental lattices
contribute to the image, in particular in twisted heterostructures featuring
moir\'e patterns. We find that in this case, GPA is likely to suggest the
presence of chiral displacement and periodic strain fields, even if the
structure is completely relaxed and without distortions. These delusive fields
are subject to change with varying twist angles, which could mislead the
interpretation of twist angle dependent properties.

We present a coherent and effective theoretical framework to systematically
construct numerically exact nonlinear solitary waves from their respective
linear limits. First, all possible linear degenerate sets are classified for a
harmonic potential using lattice planes. For a generic linear degenerate set,
distinct wave patterns are identified in the near-linear regime using a random
searching algorithm by suitably mixing the linear degenerate states, followed
by a numerical continuation in the chemical potential extending the waves into
the Thomas-Fermi regime. The method is applied to the two-dimensional,
one-component Bose-Einstein condensates, yielding a spectacular set of
waveforms. Our method opens a remarkably large program, and many more solitary
waves are expected. Finally, the method can be readily generalized to three
dimensions, and also multi-component condensates, providing a highly powerful
technique for investigating solitary waves in future works.

Spin-orbit coupling arising from the relativistic Dirac equation underpins
fundamental and applied research areas such as the spin Hall effects and
topological insulators. This Dirac mechanism of spin-orbit coupling induces in
non-centrosymmetric crystals a momentum-dependent spin splitting typically
limited to a meV scale unless involving heavy and often toxic elements. Here we
identify a previously overlooked mechanism that shares with the Dirac mechanism
the characteristic signature of spin-orbit coupling, namely the antisymmetric
time-reversal-invariant spin polarization in the band structure. In contrast to
the relativistic Dirac equation, our spin-orbit coupling arises from the
magnetic exchange interaction in non-centrosymmetric crystals with a
non-coplanar spin order. An unconventional p-wave magnetic phase, corresponding
to this exchange spin-orbit coupling, represents a long-sought but elusive
realization of a magnetic counterpart of the p-wave phase of superfluid He-3.
We identify type-A exchange spin-orbit coupling realized on mutually-shifted
opposite-spin Fermi surfaces, and type-B on one Fermi surface. We predict giant
spin splitting magnitudes on the scale of hundreds of meV in realistic material
candidates, namely in antiperovskite Ce$_3$InN and Mn$_3$GaN. Our results open
a possibility for realizing large exchange spin-orbit coupling phenomena in
materials comprising abundant light elements and with implications in fields
ranging from spintronics, dissipationless nanoelectronics and quantum
electronics, to topological matter.

To reduce the impact of charging effects on satellites, cheap and lightweight
conductive coatings are desirable. We mimic space-like charging environments in
ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chambers during deposition of charges via the electron
beam of a scanning electron microscope (SEM). We use the charge induced
signatures in SEM images of a thin ionic liquid (IL) film on insulating
surfaces such as glass, to assess the general performance of such coatings. In
order to get a reference structure in SEM, the samples were structured by
nanosphere lithography and coated with IL. The IL film (we choose BMP DCA, due
to its beneficial physical properties) was applied ex situ and a thickness of
10 to 30 nm was determined by reflectometry. Such an IL film is stable under
vacuum conditions. It would also only lead to additional mass of below 20
mg/m$^2$. At about 5 A/m$^2 \approx 3\cdot10^{19}$ e/(s$\cdot$m$^2$), a typical
sample charging rate in SEM, imaging is possible with no noticeable contrast
changes over many hours; this electron current density is already 6 orders of
magnitudes higher than "worst case geosynchronous environments" of
$3\cdot10^{-6}$ A/m$^2$. Measurements of the surface potential are used for
further insights in the reaction of IL films to the electron beam of a SEM.
Participating mechanisms such as polarization or reorientation will are
discussed.

<h3>Evolution of Maximum Bending Strain on Poisson's Ratio Distribution</h3>

In recent years, new flexible functional materials have attracted increasing
interest, but there is a lack of the designing mechanisms of flexibility design
with superstructures. In traditional engineering mechanics, the maximum bending
strain (MBS) was considered universal for describing the bendable properties of
a given material, leading to the universal designing method of lowering the
dimension such as thin membranes designed flexible functional materials.In this
work, the MBS was found only applicable for materials with uniformly
distributed Poisson's ratio, while the MBS increases with the thickness of the
given material in case there is a variation Poisson's ratio in different areas.
This means the MBS can be enhanced by certain Poisson's ratio design in the
future to achieve better flexibility of thick materials. Here, the inorganic
freestanding nanofiber membranes, which have a nonconstant Poisson's ratio
response on stress/strain for creating nonuniformly distributed Poisson's ratio
were proven applicable for designing larger MBS and lower Young's modulus for
thicker samples.

Here we report the formation of type-A and type-B electronic junctions
without any structural discontinuity along a well-defined 1-nm-wide
one-dimensional electronic channel within a van der Waals layer. We employ
scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy techniques to investigate the
atomic and electronic structure along peculiar domain walls formed on the
charge-density-wave phase of 1T-TaS2. We find distinct kinds of abrupt
electronic junctions with discontinuities of the band gap along the domain
walls, which do not have any structural kinks and defects. Our
density-functional calculations reveal a novel mechanism of the electronic
junction formation; they are formed by a kinked domain wall in the layer
underneath through substantial electronic interlayer coupling. This work
demonstrates that the interlayer electronic coupling can be an effective
control knob over several-nanometer-scale electronic property of
two-dimensional atomic monolayers.

Interfacial superconductors have the potential to revolutionize electronics,
quantum computing, and fundamental physics due to their enhanced
superconducting properties and ability to create new types of superconductors.
The emergence of superconductivity at the interface of
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$/La$_{2}$CuO$_{4}$ (LSCO/LCO), with a T$_c$
enhancement of $\sim$ 10 K compared to the La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ bulk
single crystals, provides an exciting opportunity to study quantum phenomena in
reduced dimensions. To investigate the carrier distribution and excitations in
interfacial superconductors, we combine O K-edge resonant inelastic X-ray
scattering and atomic-resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy
measurements to study La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$/La$_{2}$CuO$_{4}$
superlattices (x=0.15, 0.45) and bulk La$_{1.55}$Sr$_{0.45}$CuO$_{4}$ films. We
find direct evidence of charge redistribution, charge order and plasmon in
LSCO/LCO superlattices. Notably, the observed behaviors of charge order and
plasmon deviate from the anticipated properties of individual constituents or
the average doping level of the superlattice. Instead, they conform
harmoniously to the effective doping, a critical parameter governed by the
T$_c$ of interfacial superconductors.

Recently the discovery of superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc up
to 80 K in Ruddlesden-Popper phases Lan+1NinO3n+1 (n = 2) under pressure has
garnered considerable attention. Up to now, the superconductivity was only
observed in La3Ni2O7 single crystal grown with the optical-image floating zone
furnace under oxygen pressure. It remains to be understood the effect of
chemical doping on superconducting La3Ni2O7 as well as other Ruddlesden-Popper
phases. Here, we systematically investigate the effect of external pressure and
chemical doping on polycrystalline Ruddlesden-Popper phases. Our results
demonstrate the application of pressure and doping effectively tunes the
transport properties of Ruddlesden-Popper phases. We find pressure-induced
superconductivity up to 86 K in La3Ni2O7 polycrystalline sample, while no
signatures of superconductivity are observed in La2NiO4 and La4Ni3O10 systems
under high pressure up to 50 GPa. Our study sheds light on the exploration of
high-Tc superconductivity in nickelates.

<h3>Emergent self-duality in long range critical spin chain: from deconfined  criticality to first order transition</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Over the past few decades, tremendous efforts have been devoted to
understanding self-duality at the quantum critical point, which enlarges the
global symmetry and constrains the dynamics. In this letter, we employ
large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations to investigate the
critical spin chain with long-range interaction $V(r) \sim 1/r^{\alpha}$.
Remarkably, we reveal that the long-range interaction drives the deconfined
criticality towards a first-order phase transition as $\alpha$ decreases. More
strikingly, the emergent self-duality leads to an emergent symmetry and
manifests at these first-order critical points. This discovery is reminiscent
of self-duality protected multicritical points and provides the example of the
critical line with generalized symmetry. Our work has far-reaching implications
for ongoing experimental efforts in Rydberg atom quantum simulators.

Macroscopic objects supported by surface tension at the fluid interface can
self-assemble through the action of capillary forces arising from interfacial
deformations. The resulting self-assembled structures are ordered but remain
trapped in one of potentially many metastable states in the capillary energy
landscape. This contrasts with microscopic colloidal self-assembly where
thermal fluctuations excite transitions between geometrically distinct
ground-state configurations. We herein utilize supercritical Faraday waves to
drive structural rearrangements between metastable states of few-particle
clusters of millimetric spheres bound by capillary attractions at the fluid
interface. Using a combination of experiments and theoretical modelling, we
demonstrate how the occupation probabilities of different cluster topologies
and transition statistics are controlled by the level of the vibrational
forcing and the spatial extent of long-range capillary forces. Our results
demonstrate how self-assembly dynamics and statistics may be manipulated across
scales by controlling the strength of fluctuations and by tuning the properties
of the particle interaction-potential.

<br>
<br>
Understanding the mechanisms underlying a stable polarization at the surface
of ferroelectric thin films is of particular importance both from a fundamental
point of view and to achieve control of the surface polarization itself. In
this study, it is demonstrated that the X-ray standing wave technique allows
the polarization near the surface of a ferroelectric thin film to be probed
directly. The X-ray standing wave technique is employed to determine, with
picometer accuracy, Ti and Ba atomic positions near the surface of three
differently strained $\mathrm{BaTiO_3}$ thin films grown on scandate
substrates, with a $\mathrm{SrRuO_3}$ film as bottom electrode. This technique
gives direct access to atomic positions, and thus to the local ferroelectric
polarization, within the first 3 unit cells below the surface. By employing
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, a detailed overview of the oxygen-containing
species adsorbed on the surface, upon exposure to ambient conditions, is
obtained. The combination of structural and spectroscopic information allows us
to conclude on the most plausible mechanisms that stabilize the surface
polarization in the three samples under study. The different amplitude and
orientation of the local ferroelectric polarizations are associated with
surface charges attributed to the type, amount and spatial distribution of the
oxygen-containing adsorbates.

Employing a combination of first-principles calculations and low-energy
effective models, we present a comprehensive investigation on the electronic
structure of Pb$_{10}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{6}$O$_{4}$, which exhibits remarkable
quasi-one-dimensional flat-band around the Fermi level that contains novel
multi-dimensional fermions. These flat bands predominantly originate from
$p_x/p_y$ orbital of the oxygen molecules chain at $4e$ Wyckoff positions, and
thus can be well-captured by a four-band tight-binding model. Furthermore, the
abundant crystal symmetry inherent to Pb$_{10}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{6}$O$_{4}$ provides
an ideal platform for the emergence of various multi-dimensional fermions,
including a 0D four-fold degenerated Dirac fermion with quadratic dispersion, a
1D quadratic/linear nodal-line (QNL/LNL) fermion along symmetric $k$-paths, 1D
hourglass nodal-line (HNL) fermion linked to the Dirac fermion, and a 2D
symmetry-enforced nodal surface (NS) found on the $k_z$=$\pi$ plane. Moreover,
when considering the weak ferromagnetic order, Pb$_{10}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{6}$O$_{4}$
transforms into a rare semi-half-metal, which is characterized by the presence
of Dirac fermion and HNL fermion at the Fermi level for a single spin channel
exhibiting 100$\%$ spin polarization. Our findings reveal the coexistence of
flat bands, diverse topological semimetal states and ferromagnetism within in
Pb$_{10}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{6}$O$_{4}$, which may provide valuable insights for
further exploring intriguing interplay between superconductivity and exotic
electronic states.

The adsorption of fluorocarbons has gained significant importance as its use
as refrigerants in energy storage applications. In this context, the adsorption
behavior of two low global warming potential refrigerants, R125 fluorocarbon
and its hydrocarbon analog, R170, within four nanoporous materials, namely
MIL-101, Cu-BTC, ZIF-8, and UiO-66 has been investigated. By analyzing the
validity of our models against experimental observations, we ensure the
reliability of our molecular simulations. Our analysis encompasses a range of
crucial parameters, including adsorption isotherms, enthalpy of adsorption, and
energy storage densities, all under varying operating conditions.We find
remarkable agreement between computed and observed adsorption isotherms for
R125 within MIL-101. However, to obtain similar success for the rest of the
adsorbents, we need to take into account a few considerations, such as the
presence of inaccessible cages in Cu-BTC, the flexibility of ZIF-8, or the
defects in UiO-66. Transitioning to energy storage properties, we investigated
various scenarios, including processes with varying adsorption and desorption
conditions. Our findings underscore the dominance of MIL-101 in terms of
storage densities, with R125 exhibiting superior affinity over R170. Complex
mechanisms governed by changes in pressure, temperature, and desorption
behavior make for complicated patterns, demanding a case-specific approach. In
summary, this study navigates the complex landscape of refrigerant adsorption
in diverse nanoporous materials. It highlights the significance of operating
conditions, model selection, and refrigerant and adsorbent choices for energy
storage applications.

Most macroscopic magnetic phenomena (including magnetic hysteresis) are
typically understood classically. Here, we examine the dynamics of a uniaxial
rare-earth ferromagnet deep within the quantum regime, so that domain wall
motion, and the associated hysteresis, is dominated by large-scale quantum
tunneling of spins, rather than classical thermal activation over a potential
barrier. The domain wall motion is found to exhibit avalanche dynamics,
observable as an unusual form of Barkhausen noise. We observe non-critical
behavior in the avalanche dynamics that only can be explained by going beyond
traditional renormalization group methods or classical domain wall models. We
find that this ``quantum Barkhausen noise'' exhibits two distinct mechanisms
for domain wall movement, each of which is quantum-mechanical, but with very
different dependences on an external magnetic field applied transverse to the
spin (Ising) axis. These observations can be understood in terms of the
correlated motion of pairs of domain walls, nucleated by co-tunneling of
plaquettes (sections of domain wall), with plaquette pairs correlated by
dipolar interactions; this correlation is suppressed by the transverse field.
Similar macroscopic correlations may be expected to appear in the hysteresis of
other systems with long-range interactions.

<h3>Effective Hamiltonian approach to the kinetic infinitely long-range  Ising (the Husimi-Temperley) model</h3>

<br>
<br>
The linear master equation (ME) describing the stochastic kinetics of
Ising-type models has been transformed into a nonlinear ME (NLME) for a
time-dependent effective Hamiltonian (EH). It has been argued that for models
with large number of spins ($N$) NLME is easier to deal with numerically than
ME. The reason is that the non-equilibrium probability distribution entering ME
scales exponentially with the system size which for large $N$ causes numerical
under- and overflow problems. NLME, in contrast, contains quantities scaling
with $ N $ not faster than linearly.
The advantages of NLME in numerical calculations has been illustrated on the
problem of decay of metastable states in the kinetic Husimi-Temperley model
(HTM) previously studied within ME approach by other authors. It has been shown
that the use of NLME makes possible to extend by orders of magnitude the ranges
of numerically accessible quantities, such as the system size $ N $ and the
lifetimes of metastable states, as well as the accuracy of the calculations. An
excellent agreement of numerical results with previous studies has been found.
It has been shown that in the thermodynamic limit EH for HTM exactly
satisfies a nonlinear first order differential equation. The system of
characteristic equations for its solution has been derived and it has been
shown that the conventional mean field equation is one of them.

Quantum processors based on integrated nanoscale silicon spin qubits are a
promising platform for highly scalable quantum computation. Current CMOS spin
qubit processors consist of dense gate arrays to define the quantum dots,
making them susceptible to crosstalk from capacitive coupling between a dot and
its neighbouring gates. Small but sizeable spin-orbit interactions can transfer
this electrostatic crosstalk to the spin g-factors, creating a dependence of
the Larmor frequency on the electric field created by gate electrodes
positioned even tens of nanometers apart. By studying the Stark shift from tens
of spin qubits measured in nine different CMOS devices, we developed a
theoretical frawework that explains how electric fields couple to the spin of
the electrons in increasingly complex arrays, including those electric
fluctuations that limit qubit dephasing times $T_2^*$. The results will aid in
the design of robust strategies to scale CMOS quantum technology.

We derive the equations of quantum mechanics and quantum thermodynamics from
the assumption that a quantum system can be described by an underlying
classical system of particles. Each component $\phi_j$ of the wave vector is
understood as a stochastic complex variable whose real and imaginary parts are
proportional to the coordinate and momentum associated to a degree of freedom
of the underlying classical system. From the classical stochastic equations of
motion, we derive a general equation for the covariance matrix of the wave
vector which turns out to be of the Lindblad type. When the noise changes only
the phase of $\phi_j$, the Schr\"odinger and the quantum Liouville equation are
obtained. The component $\psi_j$ of the wave vector obeying the Schr\"odinger
equation is related to stochastic wave vector by
$|\psi_j|^2=\langle|\phi_j|^2\rangle$.

We investigate the interplay between the quantum Hall (QH) effect and
superconductivity in InAs surface quantum well (SQW)/NbTiN heterostructures
using a quantum point contact (QPC). We use QPC to control the proximity of the
edge states to the superconductor. By measuring the upstream and downstream
resistances of the device, we investigate the efficiency of Andreev conversion
at the InAs/NbTiN interface. Our experimental data is analyzed using the
Landauer-Buttiker formalism, generalized to allow for Andreev reflection
processes. We show that by varying the voltage of the QPC, $V_{QPC}$, the
average Andreev reflection, $A$, at the QH-SC interface can be tuned from 50%
to 10%. The evolution of $A$ with $V_{QPC}$ extracted from the measurements
exhibits plateaus separated by regions for which $A$ varies continuously with
$V_{QPC}$. The presence of plateaus suggests that for some ranges of $V_{QPC}$
the QPC might be pinching off almost completely from the QH-SC interface some
of the edge modes. Our work shows a new experimental setup to control and
advance the understanding of the complex interplay between superconductivity
and QH effect in two-dimensional gas systems.

Virtual Power to derive a thermodynamically consistent theory coupling the
diffusion of a guest species (Cahn-Hilliard type) with the finite deformation
of host lattices (nonlinear gradient elasticity). We adapt this theory to
intercalation materials--specifically Li$_{1-2}$Mn$_2$O$_4$--to investigate the
delicate interplay between Li-diffusion and the cubic-to-tetragonal deformation
of lattices. Our computations reveal fundamental insights into the
microstructural evolution pathways under dynamic discharge conditions, and
provide quantitative insights into the nucleation and growth of twinned
microstructures during intercalation. Additionally, our results identify
regions of stress concentrations (e.g., at phase boundaries, particle surfaces)
that arise from lattice misfit and accumulate in the electrode with repeated
cycling. These findings suggest a potential mechanism for structural decay in
Li$_2$Mn$_2$O$_4$. More generally, we establish a theoretical framework that
can be used to investigate microstructural evolution pathways, across multiple
length scales, in first-order phase transformation materials.

Two-dimensional magnetism and valleys have recently emerged as two
significant research areas, with intriguing properties and practical uses in
advanced information technology. Considering the importance of these two areas
and their couplings, controllable creations of both the magnetism and valley
polarization are highly sought after. Based on first-principles calculations,
we propose a new class of two-dimensional monolayers with a chemical formula of
MAZ$_3$, which is viewed as a 2H-MZ$_2$ trilayer passivated by the A-Z bilayer
on its one side. Taking VSiN$_3$ as an example, the MAZ$_3$ monolayers are
found to exhibit tunable magnetism and valleys. For the intrinsic VSiN$_3$
monolayer, it is a non-magnetic semiconductor, with multiple degenerate valleys
and trigonal warping near $K_\pm$ points in the band structure. Besides, the
bands have spin splittings owing to the spin-orbit coupling. Under a moderate
carrier doping, the monolayer becomes a Stoner ferromagnet, which enhances the
spin splittings of the valence band and generates valley splittings. Moreover,
the Berry curvature is valley contrasting, leading to distinct valley-spin
related anomalous Hall currents as the doping concentration increases. Our work
opens up new way to modulate the spin splittings and valley splittings via
electric means, and provides opportunities for exploring advanced spintronic
and valleytronic devices.

Composites with high strength and high fracture resistance are desirable for
structural and protective applications. Most composites, however, suffer from
poor damage tolerance and are prone to unpredictable fractures. Understanding
the behavior of materials with an irregular reinforcement phase offers
fundamental guidelines for tailoring their performance. Here, we study the
fracture nucleation and propagation in two phase composites, as a function of
the topology of their irregular microstructures. We use a stochastic algorithm
to design the polymeric reinforcing network, achieving independent control of
topology and geometry of the microstructure. By tuning the local connectivity
of isodense tiles and their assembly into larger structures, we tailor the
mechanical and fracture properties of the architected composites, at the local
and global scale. Finally, combining different reinforcing networks into a
spatially determined meso-scale assembly, we demonstrate how the spatial
propagation of fractures in architected composite materials can be designed and
controlled a priori.

We investigate a two-level system with alternating XX coupling in a photon
cavity. It is mapped to a free boson model equally coupled to a photon, whose
interaction is highly nonlocal. Some intriguing topological phenomena emerge as
a function of the photon coupling. The photon energy level anticrosses the
zero-energy topological edges at a certain photon coupling, around which the
symmetric edge state acquires nonzero energy due to the mixing with the photon.
Furthermore, the photon state is transformed into the topological zero-energy
edge or corner state when the photon coupling is strong enough. It is a
cavity-induced topological edge or corner state. On the other hand, the other
topological edge or corner states do not couple with the photon and remains at
zero energy even in the presence of the cavity. We analyze a cavity-induced
topological edge state in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and a cavity-induced
topological corner state in the breathing Kagome model.

<br>
<br>
In this study, we conducted experiments on CaC6 for elucidating the
Na-catalyzed formation mechanism and achieving rapid mass synthesis of graphite
intercalation compounds (GICs). Rapidly synthesized CaC6 was characterized by
analysis of its crystal structure and physical properties. We found that the
formation of the reaction intermediate Na-GIC (NaCx, x = 64) requires a larger
amount of Na than is intercalated between the graphite interlayers. The
requirement for excess Na may provide insights into the mechanism of
Na-catalyzed GIC formation. A Na-to-C molar mixing ratio of 1.5-2.0:6 was
suitable for the efficient formation of CaC6 under heat treatment at 250{\deg}C
for 2 h, and the catalytic Na remaining in the sample was demonstrably reduced
to a Na:Ca ratio of approximately 3:97. The upper critical field Hc2 was
enhanced approximately three times compared to those of previous reports. Based
on X-ray diffraction and experimental parameter analysis, we concluded that the
enhancement of Hc2 was attributed to the disordered stacking sequence in CaC6,
possibly because of the rapid and low-temperature formation. Physical
properties derived from specific heat measurements were comparable to those of
high-quality CaC6, which is slowly synthesized using the molten Li-Ca alloy
method. This study provides new avenues for future research and exploration in
the rapid mass synthesis of GICs as practical materials, for applications such
as battery electrodes and superconducting wires.

<h3>Strong and nearly 100$\%$ spin-polarized second-harmonic generation from  ferrimagnet Mn$_{2}$RuGa</h3>

<br>
Second-harmonic generation (SHG) has emerged as a promising tool for
detecting electronic and magnetic structures in noncentrosymmetric materials,
but 100$\%$ spin-polarized SHG has not been reported. In this work, we
demonstrate nearly 100$\%$ spin-polarized SHG from half-metallic ferrimagnet
Mn$_{2}$RuGa. A band gap in the spin-down channel suppresses SHG, so the
spin-up channel contributes nearly all the signal, as large as 3614 pm/V about
10 times larger than that of GaAs. In the spin-up channel, $\chi_{xyz}^{(2)}$
is dominated by the large intraband current in three highly dispersed bands
near the Fermi level. With the spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the reduced magnetic
point group allows additional SHG components, where the interband contribution
is enhanced. Our finding is important as it predicts a large and complete
spin-polarized SHG in a all-optical spin switching ferrimagnet. This opens the
door for future applications.

Needle-like twins are observed experimentally within the transition layer at
the martensite-twinned martensite interface. We utilize a phase-field approach
to investigate this microstructure. Our goal is to simulate the morphology of
the transition layer and to perform a detailed analysis to characterize its
interfacial and elastic micro-strain energy. To illustrate the micromechanical
framework developed for that purpose, sample computations are carried out for a
CuAlNi shape memory alloy undergoing the cubic-to-orthorhombic martensitic
transformation. A particular focus of the study is on size-dependent morphology
through examining the impact of twin spacing. Additionally, our results reveal
that certain twin volume fractions lead to the emergence of twin branching, as
a way to minimize the total free energy stored in the microstructure.

<br>
<br>
Ferroelectric domain walls are a rich source of emergent electronic
properties and unusual polar order. Recent studies showed that the
configuration of ferroelectric walls can go well beyond the conventional
Ising-type structure. N\'eel-, Bloch-, and vortex-like polar patterns have been
observed, displaying strong similarities with the spin textures at magnetic
domain walls. Here, we report the discovery of antiferroelectric domain walls
in the uniaxial ferroelectric Pb$_{5}$Ge$_{3}$O$_{11}$. We resolve highly
mobile domain walls with an alternating displacement of Pb atoms, resulting in
a cyclic 180$^{\circ}$ flip of dipole direction within the wall. Density
functional theory calculations reveal that Pb$_{5}$Ge$_{3}$O$_{11}$ is
hyperferroelectric, allowing the system to overcome the depolarization fields
that usually suppress antiparallel ordering of dipoles along the longitudinal
direction. Interestingly, the antiferroelectric walls observed under the
electron beam are energetically more costly than basic head-to-head or
tail-to-tail walls. The results suggest a new type of excited domain-wall
state, expanding previous studies on ferroelectric domain walls into the realm
of antiferroic phenomena.

<h3>Calculated iron $L_{2,3}$ x-ray absorption and XMCD of spin-crossover  Fe(phen)$_{2}$(NCS)$_{2}$ molecule adsorbed on Cu(001) surface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02078" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02078</a>

<i>R. Pasquier, M. Alouani</i>
<br>
<br>
The PAW method has been used to compute the iron L$_{2,3}$ edges of x-ray
absorption spectra (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) of the
spin-crossover Fe(phen)$_{2}$(NCS)$_{2}$ molecule when adsorbed on Cu(001)
surface and in the gas phase, for both the high spin (HS) and low spin (LS)
states. It is found that the calculated XAS and XMCD with the static core hole
or the Slater transition state half hole are in less good agreement with
experiment than those using the so called initial state. This disagreement is
due to the reduction of the iron spin magnetic moment caused by the static
screening of the core hole by the photo-electron. The L$_{2,3}$ XAS formula is
found to be directly related to the unoccupied $3d$ density of states (DOS),
and hence the symmetry broken $e_g$ and the $t_{2g}$ iron DOS are used to
explain the XAS and XMCD results. It is demonstrated that the dependence of the
HS XMCD on the direction of incident x-ray circularly polarized light with
respect to the magnetization direction can be used to determine the iron
octahedron deformation, while the XMCD for various magnetization directions is
directly related to the anisotropy of the orbital magnetic moment and the
magneto-crystalline energy. It is also shown that the magnetic dipole moment
$T_z$ is very large due to the strong distortion of the iron octahedron and is
necessary for an accurate determination of the sum rule computed spin magnetic
moment.

<h3>On the sign of the linear magnetoelectric coefficient in Cr$_2$O$_3$</h3>

<br>
<br>
We establish the sign of the linear magnetoelectric (ME) coefficient,
$\alpha$, in chromia, Cr$_2$O$_3$. Cr$_2$O$_3$ is the prototypical linear ME
material, in which an electric (magnetic) field induces a linearly proportional
magnetization (polarization), and a single magnetic domain can be selected by
annealing in combined magnetic (H) and electric (E) fields. Opposite
antiferromagnetic domains have opposite ME responses, and which
antiferromagnetic domain corresponds to which sign of response has previously
been unclear. We use density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the magnetic
response of a single antiferromagnetic domain of Cr$_2$O$_3$ to an applied
in-plane electric field at 0 K. We find that the domain with nearest neighbor
magnetic moments oriented away from (towards) each other has a negative
(positive) in-plane ME coefficient, $\alpha_{\perp}$, at 0 K. We show that this
sign is consistent with all other DFT calculations in the literature that
specified the domain orientation, independent of the choice of DFT code or
functional, the method used to apply the field, and whether the direct
(magnetic field) or inverse (electric field) ME response was calculated. Next,
we reanalyze our previously published spherical neutron polarimetry data to
determine the antiferromagnetic domain produced by annealing in combined E and
H fields oriented along the crystallographic symmetry axis at room temperature.
We find that the antiferromagnetic domain with nearest-neighbor magnetic
moments oriented away from (towards) each other is produced by annealing in
(anti-)parallel E and H fields, corresponding to a positive (negative) axial ME
coefficient, $\alpha_{\parallel}$, at room temperature. Since $\alpha_{\perp}$
at 0 K and $\alpha_{\parallel}$ at room temperature are known to be of opposite
sign, our computational and experimental results are consistent.

<h3>Deformation twins as a probe for tribologically induced stress states</h3>

<br>
<br>
Friction and wear of metals are critically influenced by the microstructures
of the bodies constituting the tribological contact. Understanding the
microstructural evolution taking place over the lifetime of a tribological
system therefore is crucial for strategically designing tribological systems
with tailored friction and wear properties. Here, we focus on
single-crystalline CoCrFeMnNi that is prone to form twins at room temperature.
Deformation twins feature a pronounced orientation dependence with a
tension-compression anisotropy, a distinct strain release in an extended volume
and robust onset stresses. This makes deformation twinning an ideal probe to
experimentally investigate the complex stress fields occurring in a
tribological contact. Our results clearly show a grain orientation dependence
of twinning under tribological load. Unexpectedly, neither the crystal
direction parallel to the sliding nor the normal direction are solely decisive
for twinning. This experimental approach is ideal to experimentally validate
tribological stress field models, as is demonstrates here.

<h3>Non-diffusive dynamics in a colloidal glass: aging versus rejuvenation</h3>

<br>
<br>
The microscopic dynamics of spontaneously aged and rejuvenated glassy
Laponite is investigated through X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy. Two
different behaviours of the intensity autocorrelation functions are observed
depending on the history of the sample: stretched for spontaneously aged
samples and samples rejuvenated from a Wigner glass and compressed, typical of
anomalous dynamics, for samples rejuvenated from a DHOC glass. The relaxation
time behaviour in the three cases indicates a non-diffusive dynamics of the
particles. The present system offers therefore an overview of various dynamical
behaviours previously observed individually in several systems and the
possibility to pass from one to the other choosing ad hoc the time parameter.

<br>

Using both time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and the
``single-shot" $GW$ plus Bethe-Salpeter equation ($GW$-BSE) approach, we
compute optical band gaps and optical absorption spectra from first principles
for eight common binary and ternary closed-shell metal oxides (MgO,
Al$_2$O$_3$, CaO, TiO$_2$, Cu$_2$O, ZnO, BaSnO$_3$, and BiVO$_4$), based on the
non-empirical Wannier-localized optimally-tuned screened range-separated hybrid
functional. Overall, we find excellent agreement between our TDDFT and $GW$-BSE
results and experiment, with a mean absolute error less than 0.4 eV, including
for Cu$_2$O and ZnO, traditionally considered to be challenging for both
methods.

<h3>Electronic structure of americium sesquioxide probed by resonant  inelastic x-ray scattering</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Am $5d$-$5f$ resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) data of americium
sesquioxide were measured at incident photon energies throughout the Am
$O_{4,5}$ edges. The experiment was supported by calculations using several
model approaches. While the experimental Am $O_{4,5}$ x-ray absorption spectrum
of Am$_2$O$_3$ is compared with the spectra calculated in the framework of
atomic multiplet and crystal-field multiplet theories and Anderson impurity
model (AIM) for the Am(III) system, the recorded Am $5d$-$5f$ RIXS data are
essentially reproduced by the crystal-field multiplet calculations. A
combination of the experimental scattering geometry and theoretical analysis of
the character of the electronic states probed during the RIXS process confirms
that the ground state of Am$_2$O$_3$ is singlet $\Gamma_1$. An appearance of
the low-intense charge-transfer satellite in the Am $5d$-$5f$ RIXS spectra at
an energy loss of $\sim$5.5 eV, suggests weak Am $5f$-O $2p$ hybridization
which is in agreement with AIM estimations of the $5f$ occupancy from
spectroscopic data in Am$_2$O$_3$ as being 6.05 electrons.

Granular gases are fascinating non-equilibrium systems with interesting
features such as spontaneous clustering and non-Gaussian velocity
distributions. Mixtures of different components represent a much more natural
composition than monodisperse ensembles, but attracted comparably little
attention so far. We present the first experimental observation and
characterization of a mixture of rod-like particles with different sizes and
masses in microgravity. Kinetic energy decay rates during granular cooling and
collision rates were determined and Haff's law for homogeneous granular cooling
was confirmed. Thereby, energy equipartition between the mixture components and
between individual degrees of freedom is violated. Heavier particles keep a
slightly higher average kinetic energy than lighter ones. Experimental results
are supported by numerical simulations.

<br>
<br>
Rectification effects in solid-state devices are a consequence of
nonreciprocal transport properties. This phenomenon is usually observed in
systems with broken inversion symmetry. In most instances, nonreciprocal
transport arises in the presence of an applied magnetic field and the rectified
signal has an antisymmetric dependence on the field. We have observed
rectification of environmental electromagnetic fluctuations in plain Nb
channels without any asymmetry in design, leading to spontaneous voltage peaks
at the superconducting transition. The signal is symmetric in the magnetic
field and appears even without an applied field at the critical temperature.
This is indicative of an unconventional mechanism of nonreciprocal transport
resulting from a spontaneous breaking of inversion symmetry.

<br>
<br>
Non-equilibrium phases of quantum matter featuring time crystalline
eigenstate order have been realized recently on noisy intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) devices. While ideal quantum time crystals exhibit collective
subharmonic oscillations and spatio-temporal long-range order persisting for
infinite times, the decoherence time of current NISQ devices sets a natural
limit to the survival of these phases, restricting their observation to a
shallow quantum circuit. Here we propose a scheme that leverages
quantum-classical feedback protocols to enhance a time crystal signal
significantly exceeding the decoherence time of the device. As a case of study,
we demonstrate the survival of the many-body localized discrete time crystal
phase (MBL-DTC) in the one dimensional periodically kicked Ising model,
accounting for decoherence of the system with an environment, in a classical
simulation. We employ a scheme that uses a periodic quantum-classical feedback
protocol based on measurement outcomes obtained in subregions of the system.
This approach is suitable for implementation on existing quantum hardware and
presents a prospective path to simulate complex quantum many-body dynamics that
transcend the low depth limit of current digital quantum computers.

<br>
<br>
Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has been extensively explored
both theoretically and experimentally as a suitable platform for a rich and
tunable phase diagram that includes ferromagnetism, charge order, broken
symmetries, and unconventional superconductivity. In this work, we investigate
the intricate interplay between long-range electron-electron interactions, spin
fluctuations, and superconductivity in MATBG. By employing a low-energy model
for MATBG that captures the correct shape of the flat bands, we explore the
effects of short- and long-range interactions on spin fluctuations and their
impact on the superconducting (SC) pairing vertex in the Random Phase
Approximation (RPA). We find that the SC state is notably influenced by the
strength of long-range Coulomb interactions. Interestingly, our RPA
calculations indicate that there is a regime where the system can traverse from
a magnetic phase to the SC phase by \emph{increasing} the relative strength of
long-range interactions compared to the on-site ones. These findings underscore
the relevance of electron-electron interactions in shaping the intriguing
properties of MATBG and offer a pathway for designing and controlling its SC
phase.

<h3>On the origin of circular dichroism in angular resolved photoemission  from graphene, graphite, and WSe$_2$ family of materials</h3>

<br>
<br>
Circular dichroism in angle-resolved photoemission (CD-ARPES) is one of the
promising techniques for obtaining experimental insight into topological
properties of novel materials, in particular to the orbital angular momentum
(OAM) in dispersive bands, which might be related, albeit certainly in a
non-trivial way, to the momentum resolved Berry curvature of the bands.
Therefore, it is important to understand how non-vanishing CD-ARPES signal
arises in graphene, a material where Dirac bands are made from C $|2p_z\rangle$
orbitals that carry zero OAM, spin-orbit-coupling (SOC) can be neglected, and
Berry curvature effectively vanishes. Dubs et al., Phys. Rev. B 32, 8389 (1985)
have demonstrated non-vanishing cricular dichroism in angular distribution
(CDAD) from an oriented $p_z$ orbital, and this process can be responsible for
the experimentally observed CD-ARPES in graphene. In this paper, we derive the
CD-ARPES from $p_z$ orbitals by elementary means, using only simple algebraic
formulas and tabulated numerical values, and show that it leads to significant
CD-ARPES signal over the entire vacuum ultraviolet and soft x-ray energy range,
with an exception of the photon energy region near $h\nu \approx 40$ eV. We
also demonstrate that another process, emerging from the finite electron
inelastic mean free path, also leads to CD-ARPES of the potentially similar
order of magnitude, as previously discussed by Moser, J. Electron Spectrosc.
Relat. Phenom. 214, 29 (2017). We present calculated CDAD maps for selected
orbitals and briefly discuss the consequences of the findings for CD-ARPES,
focusing on graphene, graphite and WSe$_2$.

Coulomb impurity of charge $Ze$ is known to destabilize the ground state of
undoped graphene with respect to creation of screening space charge if $Z$
exceeds a critical value of $1/2\alpha$ set by material's fine structure
constant $\alpha$. Recent experimental advances made it possible to explore
this transition in a controlled manner by tuning $Z$ across the critical point.
Combined with relatively large value of $\alpha$ this opens a possibility to
study graphene's screening response to a supercritical impurity $Z\alpha\gg1$
when the screening charge is large, and the Thomas-Fermi analysis, that we
revisit, is adequate. The character of screening in this regime is controlled
by the dimensionless screening parameter $Z\alpha^{2}$. Specifically, for
circular impurity cluster most of the screening charge in the weak-screening
regime $Z\alpha^{2}\ll1$ is found to reside outside the cluster. The
strong-screening regime $Z\alpha^{2}\gg1$ provides a realization of the Thomson
atom: most of the screening charge is inside the cluster nearly perfectly
neutralizing the source charge with the exception of a transition layer near
cluster's edge where the rest of the space charge is localized.

We consider a model of two harmonically driven damped harmonic oscillators
that are coupled linearly and with a cross-Kerr coupling. We show how to
distinguish this combination of coupling types from the case where a coupling
of optomechanical type is present. This can be useful for the characterization
of various nonlinear systems, such as mechanical oscillators, qubits, and
hybrid systems. We then consider a hybrid system with linear and cross-Kerr
interactions and a relatively high damping in one of the modes. We derive a
quantum Hamiltonian of a doubly clamped magnetic beam, showing that the
cross-Kerr coupling is prominent there. We discuss, in the classical limit,
measurements of its linear response as well as the specific higher-harmonic
responses. These frequency-domain measurements can allow estimating the
magnitude of the cross-Kerr coupling or its magnon population.

Triphosphides, with a chemical formula of XP$_3$ (X is a group IIIA, IVA, or

potential in several applications. Here, using density functional theory
calculations, we describe for the first time the structural and electronic
properties of the bulk bismuth triphosphide (BiP$_3$). Phonon spectra and
molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the 3D crystal of BiP$_3$ is a
metal thermodynamically stable with no bandgap. Unlike the bulk, the mono-,
bi-, tri-, and tetra-layers of BiP$_3$ are semiconductors with a bandgap
ranging from 1.4 to 0.06 eV. However, stackings with more than five layers
exhibit metallic behavior equal to the bulk. The results show that quantum
confinement is a powerful tool for tuning the electronic properties of BiP$_3$
triphosphide, making it suitable for technological applications. Building on
this, the electronic properties of van der Waals heterostructure constructed by
graphene (G) and the \bip~monolayer (m-\bip) were investigated. Our results
show that the Dirac cone in graphene remains intact in this heterostructure. At
the equilibrium interlayer distance, the G/m-BiP$_3$ forms an n-type contact
with a Schottky barrier height of 0.5 eV. It is worth noting that the SHB in
the G/m-BiP$_3$ heterostructure can be adjusted by changing the interlayer
distance or applying a transverse electric field. Thus, we show that few-layers
\bip~is an interesting material for realizing nanoelectronic and optoelectronic
devices and is an excellent option for designing Schottky nanoelectronic
devices.

We investigated temperature ($T$) dependent ultrafast near-infrared (NIR)
transient reflectivity dynamics in coexisting superconducting (SC) and charge
density wave (CDW) phases of two-dimensional 2H-NbSe$_{2}$ using NIR and
visible excitations. With visible pump-photon excitation (400 nm) we find a
slow high-energy quasiparticle relaxation channel which is present in all
phases. In the CDW phase, we observe a distinctive transient response
component, irrespective of the pump-photon energy. The component is marked by
the absence of coherent amplitude mode oscillations and a relatively slow,
picosecond rise time, which is different than in most of the typical CDW
materials. In the SC phase, another tiny component emerges that is associated
with optical suppression of the SC phase. The transient reflectivity relaxation
in the CDW phase is dominated by phonon diffusive processes with an estimated
low-$T$ heat diffusion constant anisotropy of $\sim30$. Strong excitation of
the CDW phase reveals a weakly non-thermal CDW order parameter (OP)
suppression. Unlike CDW systems with a larger gap, where the optical OP
suppression involves only a small fraction of phonon degrees of freedom, the OP
suppression in 2H-NbSe$_{2}$ is characterised by the excitation of a large
amount of phonon degrees of freedom and significantly slower dynamics.

<br>
<br>
The magnetic and structural properties of the recently discovered
pnictogen/chalcogen-free superconductor LaFeSiH ($T_c\simeq10$~K) have been
investigated by $^{57}$Fe synchrotron M{\"o}ssbauer source (SMS) spectroscopy,
x-ray and neutron powder diffraction and $^{29}$Si nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (NMR). No sign of long range magnetic order or local moments has
been detected in any of the measurements and LaFeSiH remains tetragonal down to
2 K. The activated temperature dependence of both the NMR Knight shift and the
relaxation rate $1/T_1$ is analogous to that observed in strongly overdoped
Fe-based superconductors. These results, together with the
temperature-independent NMR linewidth, show that LaFeSiH is an homogeneous
metal, far from any magnetic or nematic instability, and with similar Fermi
surface properties as strongly overdoped iron pnictides. This raises the
prospect of enhancing the $T_c$ of LaFeSiH by reducing its carrier
concentration through appropriate chemical substitutions. Additional SMS
spectroscopy measurements under hydrostatic pressure up to 18.8~GPa found no
measurable hyperfine field.

<h3>Compressing and forecasting atomic material simulations with descriptors</h3>

Atomic simulations of material microstructure require significant resources
to generate, store and analyze. Here, atomic descriptor functions are proposed
as a general latent space to compress atomic microstructure, ideal for use in
large-scale simulations. Descriptors can regress a broad range of properties,
including character-dependent dislocation densities, stress states or radial
distribution functions. A vector autoregressive model can generate trajectories
over yield points, resample from new initial conditions and forecast trajectory
futures. A forecast confidence, essential for practical application, is derived
by propagating forecasts through the Mahalanobis outlier distance, providing a
powerful tool to assess coarse-grained models. Application to nanoparticles and
yielding of dislocation networks confirms low uncertainty forecasts are
accurate and resampling allows for the propagation of smooth microstructure
distributions. Yielding is associated with a collapse in the intrinsic
dimension of the descriptor manifold, which is discussed in relation to the
yield surface.

<h3>Controlling Spontaneous Orientation Polarization in Organic  Semiconductors -- The Case of Phosphine Oxides</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Upon film growth by physical vapor deposition, the preferential orientation
of polar organic molecules can result in a non-zero permanent dipole moment
(PDM) alignment, causing a macroscopic film polarization. This effect, known as
spontaneous orientation polarization (SOP), was studied in the case of
different phosphine oxides. We investigate the control of SOP by molecular
design and film-growth conditions. Our results show that using less polar
phosphine oxides with just one phosphor-oxygen bond yields an exceptionally
high degree of SOP with the so-called giant surface potential (slope) reaching
more than 150mV/nm in a neat BCPO film grown at room temperature. Additionally,
by altering the evaporation rate and the substrate temperature, we are able to
control the SOP magnitude over a broad range from 0 to almost 300mV/nm.
Diluting BCPO in a non-polar host enhances the PDM alignment only marginally,
but combining temperature control together with dipolar doping can result in
almost perfectly aligned molecules with more than 80% of their PDMs standing
upright on the substrate on average.

<h3>Dynamics of anisotropic frustrated antiferromagnet Cs2CoBr4 in a  spin-liquid regime</h3>

<i>T. A. Soldatov, A. I. Smirnov, A. V. Syromyatnikov</i>
<br>
<br>
Cs2CoBr4 is a triangular-lattice antiferromagnet which can be viewed as
weakly interacting spin chains due to spatially anisotropic frustrating
exchange couplings. The spin-orbit interaction in Co(2+) spin-3/2 ions leads to
a strong easy-plane single-ion anisotropy which allows to consider the
low-energy spin dynamics of this system using an anisotropic pseudospin-1/2
model. By means of the electron spin resonance (ESR) technique, we study the
spin dynamics of Cs2CoBr4 in magnetic field in a spin-liquid regime, i.e.,
above the N'eel temperature of 1.3 K but below the temperature of the crossover
to in-chain correlations of pseudospins (6 K). Our experiments reveal two
bright branches of excitations which strongly differ both from excitations in
the low-temperature ordered phases and from high-temperature paramagnetic
resonance of uncorrelated pseudospins and spins. These two branches are
interpreted as excitations with zero momentum of an anisotropic spin-1/2 chain.
Besides, we observe several weak modes of unknown origin which arise mostly as
satellites of one of the bright modes.

<h3>Probing defect induced room temperature ferromagnetism in CVD grown MoO3  flakes: A correlation with electronic structure and first principle-based  calculations</h3>

<br>
In this paper, we report the growth of pure {\alpha}-MoO3 micro-flakes by CVD
technique and their structural, electronic, optical, and magnetic properties.
Samples are annealed at various temperatures in an H2 atmosphere to induce
ferromagnetism. All the samples exhibit ferromagnetism at room temperature, and
250oC annealed sample shows the highest magnetic moment of 0.087 emu/g. It is
evident from PL data that pristine as well as annealed samples contain
different types of defects like oxygen vacancies, surface defects, interstitial
oxygen, etc. It is deduced from the analysis of Mo3d and O1s core-level XPS
spectra that oxygen vacancies increase up to an annealing temperature of 250oC
that correlates with the magnetic moment. Significant changes in the total
density of states and also in the magnetic moment for two and three oxygen
vacancies are noticed through first-principle-based calculations. It is
concluded that the magnetic moment is produced by oxygen vacancies or vacancy
clusters, which is consistent with our experimental findings.

<h3>Inferring effective couplings with Restricted Boltzmann Machines</h3>

Generative models offer a direct way to model complex data. Among them,
energy-based models provide us with a neural network model that aims to
accurately reproduce all statistical correlations observed in the data at the
level of the Boltzmann weight of the model. However, one challenge is to
understand the physical interpretation of such models. In this study, we
propose a simple solution by implementing a direct mapping between the energy
function of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine and an effective Ising spin
Hamiltonian that includes high-order interactions between spins. This mapping
includes interactions of all possible orders, going beyond the conventional
pairwise interactions typically considered in the inverse Ising approach, and
allowing the description of complex datasets. Earlier work attempted to achieve
this goal, but the proposed mappings did not do properly treat the complexity
of the problem or did not contain direct prescriptions for practical
application. To validate our method, we perform several controlled numerical
experiments where the training samples are equilibrium samples of predefined
models containing local external fields, two-body and three-body interactions
in various low-dimensional topologies. The results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach in learning the correct interaction
network and pave the way for its application in modeling interesting datasets.
We also evaluate the quality of the inferred model based on different training
methods.

<h3>Probing the Dark Exciton in Monolayer MoS$_2$ by Quantum Interference in  Second Harmonic Generation Spectroscopy</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report resonant second harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy of an
hBN-encapsulated monolayer of MoS$_2$. By tuning the energy of the excitation
laser, we identify a dark state transition (D) that is blue detuned by +25 meV
from the neutral exciton X$^0$. We observe a splitting of the SHG spectrum into
two distinct peaks and a clear anticrossing between them as the SHG resonance
is tuned through the energy of the dark exciton D. This observation is
indicative of quantum interference arising from the strong two-photon
light-matter interaction. We further probe the incoherent relaxation from the
dark state to the bright excitons, including X$^0$ and localized excitons LX,
by the resonant enhancement of their intensities at the SHG-D resonance. The
relaxation of D to bright excitons is strongly suppressed on the bare substrate
whilst enabled when the hBN/MoS$_2$/hBN heterostructure is integrated in a
nanobeam cavity. The relaxation enabled by the cavity is explained by the
phonon scattering enhanced by the cavity phononic effects. Our work reveals the
two-photon quantum interference with long-lived dark states and enables the
control through nanostructuring of the substrate. These results indicate the
great potential of dark excitons in 2D-material based nonlinear quantum
devices.

<br>
<br>
Controlled doping and understanding its underlying microscopic mechanisms is
crucial for advancement of nanoscale electronic technologies, especially in
semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes (s-SWNTs), where adsorbed
counterions are known to govern redox-doping levels. However, modeling the
associated 'Coulomb defects' is challenging due to the need for large-scale
simulations at low doping levels. Using modified H\"uckel calculations on 120
nm long s-SWNTs with adsorbed $\rm Cl^-$ ions, we study the scaling properties
of shallow Coulomb defect states at the valence band edge and quantum well (QW)
states in the conduction band. Interestingly, the QW states may underlie
observed exciton band shifts of inhomogeneously doped semiconductors. Binding
energies of Coulomb defects are found to scale with counterion distance,
effective band mass, relative permittivity and counterion charge according to
$d^{\alpha-2}m^{\alpha-1}\epsilon_r^{-\alpha}|z_j|^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha$ as
an empirical parameter, deepening our understanding of s-SWNT doping.

<h3>Hidden subsystem symmetry protected states in competing topological  orders</h3>

We reveal the connection between two-dimensional subsystem symmetry-protected
topological (SSPT) states and two-dimensional topological orders via a
self-dual frustrated toric code model. This model, an enrichment of the toric
code (TC) with its dual interactions, can be mapped to a model defined on the
dual lattice with subsystem symmetries and subextensive ground state
degeneracy. The map connects exactly the frustrated TC to two copies of the
topological plaquette Ising model (TPIM), as a strong SSPT model with linear
subsystem symmetries. The membrane order parameter of TPIM is exactly mapped to
dual TC stabilizers as the order parameter of the frustrated TC model, and the
transition between the SSPT-ordered TPIM to the trivial paramagnetic phase is
mapped to the transition between two distinct topological orders. We also
demonstrate that this picture of frustrated TC can be used to construct other
SSPT models, hinting at a subtle linkage between SSPT order and topological
order in two dimensions.

<h3>Shubnikov-de Haas effect in the Falicov-Kimball model: strong  correlation meets quantum oscillation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02313" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02313</a>
<br>
<i>Wei-Wei Yang, Hong-Gang Luo, Yin Zhong</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a comprehensive investigation of quantum oscillations (QOs) in the
strongly-correlated Falicov-Kimball model (FKM). The FKM is a particularly
suitable platform for probing the non-Fermi liquid state devoid of
quasiparticles, affording exact Monte Carlo simulation across all parameter
spaces. In the high-correlation regime, we report the presence of prominent QOs
in magnetoresistance and electron density at low temperatures within the phase
separation state. The frequency behavior of these oscillations uncovers a
transition in the Fermi surface as electron density diminishes, switching from
hole-like to electron-like. Both types of Fermi surfaces are found to conform
to the Onsager relation, establishing a connection between QOs frequency and
Fermi surface area. Upon exploring the temperature dependence of QOs amplitude,
we discern a strong alignment with the Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) theory, provided
the effective mass is suitably renormalized. Notwithstanding, the substantial
enhancement of the overall effective mass results in a notable suppression of
the QOs amplitude within the examined temperature scope, a finding inconsistent
with Fermi liquid predictions. For the most part, the effective mass diminishes
as the temperature increases, but an unusual increase is observed at the
proximity of the second-order phase transition instigated by thermal effects.
As the transition ensues, the regular QOs disappear, replaced by irregular ones
in the non-Fermi liquid state under a high magnetic field. We also uncover
significant QOs in the insulating charge density wave state under weak
interactions ($0 < U < 1$), a phenomenon we elucidate through analytical
calculations. Our findings shed light on the critical role of quasiparticles in
the manifestation of QOs, enabling further understanding of their function in
this context.

<h3>Landau Theory of Barocaloric Plastic Crystals</h3>

<br>
<i>Marín-Delgado R., Moya, Guzmán-Verri, G. G</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a simple Landau phenomenology for plastic-to-crystal phase
transitions and use the resulting model to calculate barocaloric effects in
plastic crystals that are driven by hydrostatic pressure. The essential
ingredients of the model are (i) a multipole-moment order parameter that
describes the orientational ordering of the constituent molecules, (ii)
coupling between such order parameter and elastic strains, and (iii) the
thermal expansion of the solid. The model captures main features of
plastic-to-crystal phase transitions, namely large volume and entropy changes
at the transition, and strong dependence of the transition temperature with
pressure. Using solid C$_{60}$ under $0.60\,$GPa as case example, we show that
calculated peak isothermal entropy changes of $\sim 58 \,{\rm J K^{-1}
kg^{-1}}$ and peak adiabatic entropy changes of $\sim 23 \,{\rm K}$ agree well
with experimental values.

<br>
<br>
We investigated photo induced ultrafast transient dynamics in different
magnetic phases in CeSb by means of the time resolved magneto-optical
spectroscopy. We observe a distinctive coherent oscillations in the
ground-state antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase and the high-magnetic field
ferromagnetic (F) phase. While the AFM-phase oscillations frequencies match the
recent Raman scattering findings the F-phase oscillation frequency does not
correspond to the previously observed magnetic excitation. The large
spectroscopic factor, g=3.94, and optical polarization properties suggest that
it corresponds to a previously undetected Ce^{3+} crystal field excitation. To
our best knowledge this is the first observation of a coherently excited
excitonic magnetic transition. The AFM-phase oscillations show no magnetic
field dependence so their lattice origin cannot be excluded. The
non-oscillatory part of the transients is qualitatively similar in all
investigated magnetic phases with a faster sub-picosecond dynamics in the
ferromagnetic and ferro-para-magnetic phases and is attributed to differences
in the electronic structure, which affect the photo-excited quasiparticle
energy relaxation.

A pivotal challenge in present quantum technologies lies in reconciling long
coherence times with efficient manipulation of the quantum states of a system.
Lanthanide atoms, with their well-localized 4f electrons, emerge as a promising
solution to this dilemma if provided with a rational design of the manipulation
and detection schemes. Here we utilize a scanning tunneling microscope to
construct tailored spin structures and perform electron spin resonance on a
single lanthanide atom in such a structure. A magnetically coupled structure
made of an Erbium and a Titanium atom at sub-nanometer distance enables us to
both drive Erbium's 4f electron spins and indirectly probe them through the
Titanium's 3d electrons. In this coupled configuration, the Erbium spin states
exhibit a four-fold increase in the spin relaxation time and a two-fold
increase in the driving efficiency compared to the 3d electron counterparts.
Our work provides a new approach to accessing highly protected spin states,
enabling us to control them in an all-electric fashion.

Altermagnets (AM) are a recently discovered third class of collinear magnets,
distinctly different from conventional ferromagnets (FM) and antiferromagnets
(AF). AM have been actively researched in the last few years, but two aspects
so far remain unaddressed: (1) Are there realistic 2D single-layer
altermagnets? And (2) is it possible to functionalize a conventional AF into AM
by external stimuli? In this paper we address both issues by demonstrating how
a well-known 2D AF, MnP(S,Se)$_3$ can be functionalized into strong AM by
applying out-of-plane electric field. Of particular interest is that the
induced altermagnetism is of a higher even-parity wave symmetry than expected
in 3D AM with similar crystal symmetries. We confirm our finding by
first-principles calculations of the electronic structure and magnetooptical
response. We also propose that recent observations of the time-reversal
symmetry breaking in the famous Fe-based superconducting chalchogenides, either
in monolayer form or in the surface layer, may be related not to an FM, as
previously assumed, but to the induced 2D AM order. Finally, we show that
monolayer FeSe can simultaneously exhibit unconventional altermagnetic
time-reversal symmetry breaking and quantized spin Hall conductivity indicating
possibility to research an intriquing interplay of 2D altermagnetism with
topological and superconducting states within a common crystal-potential
environment.

An essential aspect of extending safe operation of the active nuclear
reactors is understanding and predicting the embrittlement that occurs in the
steels that make up the Reactor pressure vessel (RPV). In this work we
integrate state of the art machine learning methods using ensembles of neural
networks with unprecedented data collection and integration to develop a new
model for RPV steel embrittlement. The new model has multiple improvements over
previous machine learning and hand-tuned efforts, including greater accuracy
(e.g., at high-fluence relevant for extending the life of present reactors),
wider domain of applicability (e.g., including a wide-range of compositions),
uncertainty quantification, and online accessibility for easy use by the
community. These improvements provide a model with significant new
capabilities, including the ability to easily and accurately explore
compositions, flux, and fluence effects on RPV steel embrittlement for the
first time. Furthermore, our detailed comparisons show our approach improves on
the leading American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) E900-15 standard
model for RPV embrittlement on every metric we assessed, demonstrating the
efficacy of machine learning approaches for this type of highly demanding
materials property prediction.

<br>
Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field-theory arguments, we study
the fully frustrated (Villain) transverse-field Ising model on the square
lattice. We consider a "primary" spin order parameter and a "secondary" dimer
order parameter, which both lead to the same phase diagram but detect $Z_8$ and
$Z_4$ symmetry, respectively. The spin order scales with conventional
exponents, both in the finite temperature critical phase and at the $T = 0$
quantum critical point. The scaling of the dimer order requires more detailed
investigations of the applicable low-energy theories; the height model at $T >
0$ and the $O(2)$ model in 2+1 dimensions at $T = 0$. Relating the order
parameters to operators in these effective models, we predict the secondary
critical exponents and confirm them numerically. The relationships between the
primary and secondary order parameters have not been previously discussed in
this context and provide insight more broadly for Ising models whose low-energy
physics involves dimer degrees of freedom.

RhPb was initially recognized as one of a CoSn-like compounds with $P6/mmm$
symmetry, containing an ideal kagome lattice of $d$-block atoms. However,
theoretical calculations predict the realization of the phonon soft mode which
leads to the kagome lattice distortion and stabilization of the structure with
$P\bar{6}2m$ symmetry [A. Ptok et al., Phys. Rev. B 104, 054305 (2021)]. Here,
we present the single crystal x-ray diffraction results supporting this
prediction. Furthermore, we discuss the main dynamical properties of RhPb with
$P\bar{6}2m$ symmetry. The bulk phononic dispersion curves contain several
flattened bands, Dirac nodal lines, and triple degenerate Dirac points. As a
consequence, the phononic drumhead surface state is realized for the (100)
surface, terminated by the zigzag-like edge of Pb honeycomb sublattice.

Ruthenium oxide with the rutile structure is one of example of altermagnets.
These systems are characterized by compensated magnetic moments (typical for
antiferromagnets) and strong time reversal symmetry breaking (typical for
ferromagnets). However, in such cases, the electronic band structure exhibit
strong spin splitting along some directions in the momentum space. Occurrence
of the compensated magnetic textures allows for realization of surfaces with
specific magnetization, which dependent on the surface orientation and/or its
termination. Here, we study interplay between the electronic surface states and
the surface magnetization. We show that the spin-resolved spectra strongly
depends on a direction in reciprocal space. Such properties can be used for the
experimental confirmation of the altermagnetism in RuO$_{2}$ within the
spectroscopic techniques. Additionally, we show that the most modified orbitals
in the system are $d_{z^{2}}$ and $d_{xy}$ orbitals of Ru. Similarly, the Ru
$e_{g}$ states are most sensitive on epitaxial strain, what can suggest some
link between altermagnetism and strain.
