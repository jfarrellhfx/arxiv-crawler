<h3>Suppression of Heating by Multi-color Driving Protocols in Floquet  Engineered Strongly Correlated Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10379" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10379</a>

Heating effects in Floquet engineered system are detrimental to the control
of physical properties. In this work, we show that the heating of periodically
driven strongly correlated systems can be suppressed by multi-color driving,
i.e., by applying auxiliary excitations which interfere with the absorption
processes from the main drive. We focus on the Mott insulating single-band
Hubbard model and study the effects of multi-color driving with nonequilibrium
dynamical mean-field theory. The main excitation is a periodic electric field
with frequency $\Omega$ smaller than the Mott gap, while for the auxiliary
excitations, we consider additional electric fields and/or hopping modulations
with a higher harmonic of $\Omega$. To suppress the 3-photon absorption of the
main excitation, which is a parity-odd process, we consider auxiliary
electric-field excitations and a combination of electric-field excitations and
hopping modulations. On the other hand, to suppress the 2-photon absorption,
which is a parity-even process, we consider hopping modulations. The conditions
for an efficient suppression of heating are well captured by the Floquet
effective Hamiltonian derived with the high-frequency expansion in a rotating
frame. As an application, we focus on the exchange couplings of the spins
(pseudo-spins) in the repulsive (attractive) model, and demonstrate that the
suppression of heating allows to realize and clearly observe a significant
Floquet-induced change of the low energy physics.

<h3>Interaction of Confined Light with Optically Structured Thin Film  Organic Semiconductor Devices</h3>

The pioneering experiments of Karl H. Drexhage explained the classical
interaction of light with matter and the modification of the decay rates of an
emitter.1 Here, we tried to mimic these experiments in a slightly different
configuration and measured the electron mobility of a thin film semiconductor
from weak to strong coupling regime. Perylene diimide (organic semiconductor
dye) molecules are deposited on a MOSFET device. The refractive index mismatch
between the silicon/silicon dioxide layer and the dye molecules forms an
interference pattern. The frequency of the interference lines is tuned by
changing the thickness of the organic semiconductor. Interestingly, we observed
an increase in the electron mobility of the active layer once the system slowly
entered into strong coupling condition in a {\lambda} cavity. Whereas resonance
tuning of a {\lambda}/2 cavity does not affect the electron transport,
suggesting the system is still in the weak coupling regime. These results are
further correlated by optical measurements and transfer matrix simulations. The
increase in electron mobility is not large due to high dissipation or
low-quality factors of the cavity modes. However, the mirrorless configuration
presented here may offer a simpler way of studying the properties of the
polaritonic states.

We study the fluctuations of the integrated density current across the origin
up to time $T$ in a lattice model of active particles with hard-core
interactions. This model is amenable to an exact description within a
fluctuating hydrodynamics framework. We focus on quenched initial conditions
for both the density and magnetization fields and derive expressions for the
cumulants of the density current, which can be matched with direct numerical
simulations of the microscopic lattice model. For the case of uniform initial
profiles, we show that the second cumulant of the integrated current displays
three regimes: an initial $\sqrt{T}$ rise with a coefficient given by the
symmetric simple exclusion process, a cross-over regime where the effects of
activity increase the fluctuations, and a large time $\sqrt{T}$ behavior with a
prefactor which depends on the initial conditions, the P\'eclet number and the
mean density of particles. Additionally, we study the limit of zero diffusion
where the fluctuations intriguingly exhibit a $T^2$ behavior at short times.
However, at large times, the fluctuations still grow as $\sqrt{T}$, with a
coefficient that can be calculated explicitly. For low densities, we show that
this coefficient can be expressed in terms of the effective diffusion constant
$D_{\text{eff}}$ for non-interacting active particles.

<h3>Coexistence of $s$-wave superconductivity and phase separation in the  half-filled extended Hubbard model with attractive interactions</h3>

Understanding competing instabilities in systems with correlated fermions
remains one of the holy grails of modern condensed matter physics. Among the
fermionic lattice models used to this effect, the extended Hubbard model
occupies a prime place due to the potential relevance of its repulsive and
attractive versions for both electronic materials and artificial systems. Using
the recently introduced multi-channel fluctuating field approach, we address
the interplay of charge density wave, $s$-wave superconductivity, and phase
separation fluctuations in the attractive extended Hubbard model. Despite of
the fact that this model has been intensively studied for decades, our novel
approach has allowed us to identify a novel phase that is characterised by the
coexistence of $s$-wave superconductivity and phase separation. Our findings
resonate with previous observations of interplaying phase separation and
superconducting phases in electronic systems, most importantly in
high-temperature superconductors.

<h3>Spectral signatures of symmetry-breaking dynamical phase transitions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10262" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10262</a>

Large deviation theory provides the framework to study the probability of
rare fluctuations of time-averaged observables, opening new avenues of research
in nonequilibrium physics. One of the most appealing results within this
context are dynamical phase transitions (DPTs), which might occur at the level
of trajectories in order to maximize the probability of sustaining a rare
event. While the Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory has underpinned much recent
progress on the understanding of symmetry-breaking DPTs in driven diffusive
systems, their microscopic characterization is still challenging. In this work
we shed light on the general spectral mechanism giving rise to continuous DPTs
not only for driven diffusive systems, but for any jump process in which a
discrete $\mathbb{Z}_n$ symmetry is broken. By means of a symmetry-aided
spectral analysis of the Doob-transformed dynamics, we provide the conditions
whereby symmetry-breaking DPTs might emerge and how the different dynamical
phases arise from the specific structure of the degenerate eigenvectors. We
show explicitly how all symmetry-breaking features are encoded in the
subleading eigenvectors of the degenerate manifold. Moreover, by partitioning
configuration space into equivalence classes according to a proper order
parameter, we achieve a substantial dimensional reduction which allows for the
quantitative characterization of the spectral fingerprints of DPTs. We
illustrate our predictions in three paradigmatic many-body systems: (i) the 1D
boundary-driven weakly asymmetric exclusion process (WASEP), which exhibits a
particle-hole symmetry-breaking DPT for current fluctuations, (ii) the $3$ and
$4$-state Potts model, which displays discrete rotational symmetry-breaking DPT
for energy fluctuations, and (iii) the closed WASEP which presents a continuous
symmetry-breaking DPT to a time-crystal phase characterized by a rotating
condensate.

<h3>Strain-induced dynamic control over the population of quantum emitters  in two-dimensional materials</h3>

The discovery of quantum emitters in two-dimensional materials has triggered
a surge of research to assess their suitability for quantum photonics. While
their microscopic origin is still the subject of intense studies, ordered
arrays of quantum emitters are routinely fabricated using static
strain-gradients, which are used to drive excitons toward localized regions of
the 2D crystals where quantum-light-emission takes place. However, the
possibility of using strain in a dynamic fashion to control the appearance of
individual quantum emitters has never been explored so far. In this work, we
tackle this challenge by introducing a novel hybrid semiconductor-piezoelectric
device in which WSe2 monolayers are integrated onto piezoelectric pillars
delivering both static and dynamic strains. Static strains are first used to
induce the formation of quantum emitters, whose emission shows photon
anti-bunching. Their excitonic population and emission energy are then
reversibly controlled via the application of a voltage to the piezoelectric
pillar. Numerical simulations combined with drift-diffusion equations show that
these effects are due to a strain-induced modification of the
confining-potential landscape, which in turn leads to a net redistribution of
excitons among the different quantum emitters. Our work provides relevant
insights into the role of strain in the formation of quantum emitters in 2D
materials and suggests a method to switch them on and off on demand.

<h3>Transverse-electric surface plasmon polaritons in periodically modulated  graphene</h3>

Transverse-electric (TE) surface plasmon polaritons are unique eigenmodes of
a homogeneous graphene layer that are tunable with the chemical potential and
temperature. However, as they spectrally lie just below the light line, they
cannot be resonantly excited by an externally incident wave. Here, we propose a
way of exciting the TE modes and tuning the transmission peaks by introducing a
one-dimensional graphene grating. Using the scattering-matrix formalism, we
show that periodic modulations of graphene make the transmission more
pronounced, potentially allowing for experimental observation of the TE modes.
Furthermore, we propose the use of turbostratic graphene to enhance the role of
the surface plasmon polaritons in optical spectra.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials present an exciting opportunity for devices
and systems beyond the von Neumann computing architecture paradigm due to their
diversity of electronic structure, physical properties, and atomically-thin,
van der Waals structures that enable ease of integration with conventional
electronic materials and silicon-based hardware. All major classes of
non-volatile memory (NVM) devices have been demonstrated using 2D materials,
including their operation as synaptic devices for applications in neuromorphic
computing hardware. Their atomically-thin structure, superior physical
properties, i.e., mechanical strength, electrical and thermal conductivity, as
well as gate-tunable electronic properties provide performance advantages and
novel functionality in NVM devices and systems. However, device performance and
variability as compared to incumbent materials and technology remain major
concerns for real applications. Ultimately, the progress of 2D materials as a
novel class of electronic materials and specifically their application in the
area of neuromorphic electronics will depend on their scalable synthesis in
thin-film form with desired crystal quality, defect density, and phase purity.

The electronic and magnetic structure of CrPS$_{4}$, a 2D magnetic
semiconductor is examined by employing the SCAN meta-GGA density functional. We
find the resulting magnetic moment and band gap are in excellent agreement with
experiment. From the bulk magnetic configurations, we confirm the
experimentally observed A-type antiferromagnetic (A-AFM) ordered ground state
with a magnetic moment of 2.78 $\mu_B$ per chromium atom and band gap of 1.34
eV. To gain insight into the evolution of the ground state with layers, the
total energy of each magnetic configuration is calculated for a variety of
thicknesses. Monolayer CrPS$_{4}$ is predicted to be a ferromagnetic insulator
with a band gap of 1.37 eV, and A-AFM for bilayer and trilayer, with band gaps
of 1.35 eV and 1.30 eV, respectively. The electronic structure is reported for
the single, two, three layer and bulk CrPS$_{4}$. Finally, we explore the
optical properties of the 2D structure and report the dielectric tensor
components and Kerr parameters for the monolayer.

A new group of kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) exhibit a variety
of intertwined unconventional electronic phases, which emerge from a puzzling
charge density wave phase. Understanding of this parent charge order phase is
crucial for deciphering the entire phase diagram. However, the mechanism of the
charge density wave is still controversial, and its primary source of
fluctuations - the collective modes - have not been experimentally observed.
Here, we use ultrashort laser pulses to melt the charge order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$
and record the resulting dynamics using femtosecond angle-resolved
photoemission. We resolve the melting time of the charge order and directly
observe its amplitude mode, imposing a fundamental limit for the fastest
possible lattice rearrangement time. These observations together with ab-initio
calculations provide clear evidence for a structural rather than electronic
mechanism of the charge density wave. Our findings pave the way for better
understanding of the unconventional phases hosted on the kagome lattice.

<h3>Two-Level Systems in Nucleated and Non-Nucleated Epitaxial  alpha-Tantalum films</h3>

Building usefully coherent superconducting quantum processors depends on
reducing losses in their constituent materials. Tantalum, like niobium, has
proven utility as the primary superconducting layer within highly coherent
qubits. But, unlike Nb, high temperatures are typically used to stabilize the
desirable body-centered-cubic phase, alpha-Ta, during thin film deposition. It
has long been known that a thin Nb layer permits the room-temperature
nucleation of alpha-Ta, although neither an epitaxial process nor few-photon
microwave loss measurements have been reported for Nb-nucleated Ta films prior
to this study. We compare resonators patterned from Ta films grown at high
temperature (500 {\deg}C) and films nucleated at room temperature, in order to
understand the impact of crystalline order on quantum coherence. In both cases,
films grew with Al2O3 (001) || Ta (110) indicating that the epitaxial
orientation is independent of temperature and is preserved across the Nb/Ta
interface. We use conventional low-power spectroscopy to measure two level
system (TLS) loss, as well as an electric-field bias technique to measure the
effective dipole moments of TLS in the surfaces of resonators. In our
measurements, Nb-nucleated Ta resonators had greater loss tangent (1.5 +/- 0.1
x 10^-5) than non-nucleated (5 +/- 1 x 10^-6) in approximate proportion to
defect densities as characterized by X-ray diffraction (0.27 {\deg} vs 0.18
{\deg} [110] reflection width) and electron microscopy (30 nm vs 70 nm domain
size). The dependence of the loss tangent on domain size indicates that the
development of more ordered Ta films is likely to lead to improvements in qubit
coherence times. Moreover, low-temperature alpha-Ta epitaxy may enable the
growth of new, microstate-free heterostructures which would not withstand high
temperature processing.

<h3>Simulation studies of Single Event Effects in Ga$_2$O$_3$ MOSFETs</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this article, we investigate the Single Events Effects (SEE) leading to
Single Event Burnout (SEB) in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ MOSFETs. Using Silvaco TCAD,
2D simulations were performed to understand the mechanism behind the SEB
mechanism in lateral Ga$_2$O$_3$ MOSFETS. The high electric fields in the
channel played a critical role leading to high impact generation rates and
eventual SEB. To reduce the electric field in the channel, radiation hardened
designs are then proposed with rounded gates and the use of a combination of
high permittivity (k) dielectric with SiO$_2$. With HfO$_2$-SiO$_2$ dielectric
combination, the SEB threshold of 550V at LET=10 MeV/mg/cm$^2$ is seen.
However, to operate under extreme radiation conditions, a combination of very
high-k dielectric material BaTiO$_3$ with SiO$_2$ is proposed. Using the
radiation hardened design, SEB thresholds up to 1000 V for LET=75 MeV/mg/cm$^2$
could be achieved which is higher than the state-of-the-art technology. The
energy dissipated during the ion strike event is also calculated and it is
observed that it is lower than that of SiC MOSFETs.

Fluorophores emitting in the NIR-IIb wavelength range (1.5 micron - 1.7
micron) show great potential for bioimaging due to their large tissue
penetration. However, current fluorophores suffer from poor emission with
quantum yields ~2% in aqueous solvents. In this work, we report the synthesis
of HgSe/CdSe core/shell quantum dots emitting at 1.7 microns through the
interband transition. Growth of a thick shell led to a drastic increase in the
photoluminescence quantum yield, with a value of 55% in nonpolar solvents. The
quantum yields of our QDs and other reported QDs are explained well by a model
of Forster resonance energy transfer to ligands and solvent molecules. The
model predicts a quantum yield >6% when these HgSe/CdSe QDs are solubilized in
water. Our work demonstrates the importance of a thick type-I shell to obtain
bright emission in the NIR-IIb region

Maxwell lattices are characterized by an equal number of degrees of freedom
and constraints. A subset of them, dubbed topological lattices, are capable of
localizing stress and deformation on opposing edges, displaying a polarized
mechanical response protected by the reciprocal-space topology of their band
structure. In two dimensions, the opportunities for topological polarization
have been largely restricted to the kagome and square lattice benchmark
configurations, due to the non-triviality of generating arbitrary geometries
that abide by Maxwell conditions. In this work, we introduce a generalized
family of augmented topological lattices that display full in-plane topological
polarization. We explore the robustness of such polarization upon selection of
different augmentation criteria, with special emphasis on augmented
configurations that display dichotomous behavior with respect to their
primitive counterparts. We corroborate our results via intuitive table-top
experiments conducted on a lattice prototype assembled from 3D-printed
mechanical links.

Geometrically frustrated magnetism is commonly studied in triangular and
Kagome lattices. A rare lattice which exhibits frustration is obtained by
depleting 1/7 of the sites from a triangular lattice and is called a maple-leaf
lattice. We report the magnetic properties of an oxide material with a
maple-leaf lattice: Na2Mn3O7. Structural studies suggest slight lattice
distortion and density functional theory predicts energetic near-degeneracy
between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetic phases which points towards
competing magnetic orderings at low temperatures. In addition, from our
magnetic studies, we discovered a non-equilibrium spin state below ~50 K. The
bifurcation of field-cooled and zero-field-cooled magnetization curves,
hysteresis of ~16 kOe at 2 K, and time-dependent magnetization response is
consistent with a spin glass state. To our knowledge this is the first report
of such a state in materials with a MLL. This is a promising discovery towards
using spin glass to transport angular momentum or spins for applications low
power spintronics.

The electrical and optoelectronic properties of transition-metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS2, are highly dependent on carrier doping
and layer thickness. The ability to selectively control these two critical
characteristics is of great importance to develop TMD-based multifunctional
device applications, which remains challenging. Here, we report a strategy for
controllable surface modification and layer thinning of MoS2 via ultraviolet
(UV) light irradiation in a silver ionic solution environment. The results show
that by adjusting UV irradiation time, nanostructured silver ultrathin films
(~2.9 nm) are uniformly deposited on monolayer MoS2 and can lead to
controllable p-type doping effect, while the thickness of MoS2 from few-layer
to bulk crystals could be thinned down to the atomic monolayer limit. Both
silver nanostructure deposition and layer thinning process have been evidenced
to initiate from the edges of MoS2, and independent of the edge type, thus
revealing a unique UV light-assisted defect-induced surface modification and
layer thinning mechanism. Overall, this study provides a new methodology for
selective control of doping and layer thickness in TMDs, paving the way for
developing novel 2D nanoelectronics and integrated optoelectronics.

<h3>Ab initio prediction of anomalous Hall effect in antiferromagnetic  CaCrO$_3$</h3>

<br>
While the anomalous Hall effect takes place typically in ferromagnets with
finite magnetization, large anomalous Hall conductivity in noncollinear
antiferromagnetic systems has been recently observed and attracted much
attention. In this study, we predict the anomalous Hall effect in perovskite
CaCrO$_3$ as a representative of 'collinear' antiferromagnetic materials. Our
result shows that the C-type antiferromagnetic ordering generates the sizable
anomalous Hall conductivity. Based on symmetry analyses, we show that the
antiferromagnetic order parameter belongs to the same irreducible
representation as the ferromagnetic order parameter in the nonsymmorphic space
group, allowing the non-vanishing Berry curvatures in k space. By performing
first-principles density-functional theory calculations, we find that the
Berry-curvature 'hot spots' lie along the gapped nodal lines where spin-orbit
coupling induces the spin splitting of Cr-3d bands near the Fermi energy and
enhances the anomalous Hall effect in CaCrO$_3$.

We present low-temperature Raman measurements on gate tunable graphene
encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride, which allows to study in detail the
Raman G and 2D mode frequencies and line widths as function of the charge
carrier density. We observe a clear softening of the Raman G mode (of up to 2.5
cm$^{-1}$) at low carrier density due to the phonon anomaly and a residual
G~mode line width of $\approx$ 3.5 cm$^{-1}$ at high doping. From analyzing the
G mode dependence on doping and laser power we extract an
electron-phonon-coupling constant of $\approx$ 4.4 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ (for the
G mode phonon). The ultra-flat nature of encapsulated graphene results in a
minimum Raman 2D peak line width of 14.5 cm$^{-1}$ and allows to observe the
intrinsic electron-electron scattering induced broadening of the 2D peak of up
to 18 cm$^{-1}$ for an electron density of 5$\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ (laser
excitation energy of 2.33 eV). Our findings not only provide insights into
electron-phonon coupling and the role of electron-electron scattering for the
broadening of the 2D peak, but also crucially shows the limitations when it
comes to the use of Raman spectroscopy (i.e. the use of the frequencies and the
line widths of the G and 2D modes) to benchmark graphene in terms of charge
carrier density, strain and strain inhomogenities. This is particularly
relevant when utilizing spatially-resolved 2D Raman line width maps to assess
substrate-induced nanometer-scale strain variations.

The expansiveness of compositional phase space is too vast to fully search
using current theoretical tools for many emergent problems in condensed matter
physics. The reliance on a deep chemical understanding is one method to
identify local minima of relevance to investigate further, minimizing sample
space. Utilizing machine learning methods can permit a deeper appreciation of
correlations in higher order parameter space and be trained to behave as a
predictive tool in the exploration of new materials. We have applied this
approach in our search for new high temperature superconductors by
incorporating models which can differentiate structural polymorphisms, in a
pressure landscape, a critical component for understanding high temperature
superconductivity. Our development of a representation for machine learning
superconductivity with structural properties allows fast predictions of
superconducting transition temperatures ($T_c$) providing a $r^2$ above 0.94.

<h3>Effect of the initial microstructure on the pressure-induced phase  transition in Zr and microstructure evolution</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10475" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10475</a>

<br>
<br>
The effect of initial microstructure and its evolution across the
$\alpha\rightarrow\omega$ phase transformation in commercially pure Zr under
hydrostatic compression has been studied using in situ x-ray diffraction
measurements. Two samples were studied: one is plastically pre-deformed Zr with
saturated hardness and the other is annealed. Phase transformation
$\alpha\rightarrow\omega$ initiates at lower pressure for pre-deformed sample,
suggesting pre-straining promotes nucleation by producing more defects with
stronger stress concentrators. With transformation progress, the promoting
effect on nucleation reduces while that on growth is suppressed by producing
more obstacles for interface propagation. The crystal domain size reduces and
microstrain and dislocation density increase during loading for both $\alpha$
and $\omega$ phases in their single-phase regions. For $\alpha$ phase, domain
sizes are much smaller for prestrained Zr, while microstrain and dislocation
densities are much higher. On the other hand, they do not differ much in
$\omega$ Zr for both prestrained and annealed samples, implying that
microstructure is not inherited during phase transformation. The significant
effect of pressure on the microstructural parameters (domain size, microstrain,
and dislocation density) demonstrates that their postmortem evaluation does not
represent the true conditions during loading. A simple model for the initiation
of the phase transformation involving microstrain is suggested, and a possible
model for the growth is outlined. The obtained results suggest an extended
experimental basis is required for better predictive models for the
pressure-induced and combined pressure- and strain-induced phase
transformations.

<br>
<br>
We study a particle in an Aharonov-Bohm ring subject to interactions with a
weakly interacting Bose gas. We show that the ground state of the system can be
described using the Bose polaron concept -- a particle dressed by interactions
with a bosonic environment. We connect the energy spectrum to the effective
mass of the polaron, and demonstrate how to change currents in the system by
tuning boson-particle interactions. Our results suggest the Aharonov-Bohm ring
as a platform for studying coherence and few- to many-body crossover of
quasi-particles that arise from an impurity immersed in a medium.

<h3>The delayed fracture test for viscoelastic elastomers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10490" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10490</a>
<br>
<i>Bhavesh Shrimali, Oscar Lopez-Pamies</i>
<br>
<br>
In a recent contribution, Shrimali and Lopez-Pamies (2023) have shown that
the Griffith criticality condition that governs crack growth in viscoelastic
elastomers can be reduced -- from its ordinary form involving a historically
elusive loading-history-dependent critical tearing energy $T_c$ -- to a
fundamental form that involves exclusively the intrinsic fracture energy $G_c$
of the elastomer. The purpose of this paper is to make use of this fundamental
form to explain one of the most distinctive fracture tests for viscoelastic
elastomers, the so-called delayed fracture test.

<h3>Nonequilibrium Seebeck effect and thermoelectric efficiency of  Kondo-correlated molecular junctions</h3>

<br>
<br>
We theoretically study the nonequilibrium thermoelectric transport properties
of a strongly-correlated molecule (or quantum dot) embedded in a tunnel
junction. Assuming that the coupling of the molecule to the contacts is
asymmetric, we determine the nonlinear current driven by the voltage and
temperature gradients by using the perturbation theory. However, the subsystem
consisting of the molecule strongly coupled to one of the contacts is solved by
using the numerical renormalization group method, which allows for accurate
description of Kondo correlations. We study the temperature gradient and
voltage dependence of the nonlinear and differential Seebeck coefficients for
various initial configurations of the system. In particular, we show that in
the Coulomb blockade regime with singly occupied molecule, both thermopowers
exhibit sign changes due to the Kondo correlations at nonequilibrium
conditions. Moreover, we determine the nonlinear heat current and
thermoelectric efficiency, demonstrating that the system can work as a heat
engine with considerable efficiency, depending on the transport regime.

<h3>Stability of Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces within BCS Theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10524" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10524</a>
<br>
<i>Ankita Bhattacharya, Carsten Timm</i>
<br>
<br>
It has recently been realized that the gap nodes of multiband superconductors
that break time-reversal symmetry generically take the form of Fermi surfaces
of Bogoliubov quasiparticles. However, these Fermi surfaces lead to a nonzero
density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy, which typically disfavors such
superconducting states. It has thus not been clear whether they can be stable
for reasonable pairing interactions or are in practice preempted by
time-reversal-symmetric states with vanishing DOS. In this Letter, we show
within BCS theory applied to a paradigmatic model that the
time-reversal-symmetry-breaking states are indeed stabilized over broad
parameter ranges at weak coupling. Moreover, we introduce a fast method that
involves solving the inverse BCS gap equation, does not require iteration, does
not suffer from convergence problems, and can handle metastable solutions.

<h3>Gate-controlled Magnetotransport and Electrostatic Modulation of  Magnetism in 2D magnetic semiconductor CrPS$_4$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Using field-effect transistors (FETs) to explore atomically thin magnetic
semiconductors with transport measurements is difficult, because the very
narrow bands of most 2D magnetic semiconductors cause carrier localization,
preventing transistor operation. Here, we show that exfoliated layers of
CrPS$_4$ -- a 2D layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor whose bandwidth
approaches 1 eV -- allow the realization of FETs that operate properly down to
cryogenic temperature. Using these devices, we perform conductance measurements
as a function of temperature and magnetic field, to determine the full magnetic
phase diagram, which includes a spin-flop and a spin-flip phase. We find that
the magnetoconductance depends strongly on gate voltage, reaching values as
high as 5000 % near the threshold for electron conduction. The gate voltage
also allows the magnetic states to be tuned, despite the relatively large
thickness of the CrPS$_4$ multilayers employed in our study. Our results show
the need to employ 2D magnetic semiconductors with sufficiently large bandwidth
to realize properly functioning transistors, and identify a candidate material
to realize a fully gate-tunable half-metallic conductor.

<h3>Metal adsorption and nucleation on free-standing graphene by low-energy  electron point source microscopy (graphene intercalation)</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The interaction of metals with carbon materials, specifically with graphene,
is of importance for various technological applications. In particular,
intercalation of alkali metals is believed to provide a means for tuning the
electronic properties of graphene for device applications. While the
macroscopic effects of such intercalation events can readily be studied,
following the related processes at an atomic scale in detail and under
well-defined experimental conditions constitutes a challenge. Here, we
investigate in situ the adsorption and nucleation of the alkali metals K, Cs,
and Li on free-standing graphene by means of low-energy electron point source
microscopy. We find that alkali metals readily intercalate in between bilayer
graphene. In fact, the equilibrium distribution of K and Cs favours a much
higher particle density in between the bilayer than on the single layer
graphene. We obtain a quantitative value for the difference of the free energy
of binding between these two domains. Our study is completed with a control
experiment introducing Pd as a representative of the non-alkali metals. Now, we
observe cluster formation in equal measure on both, single and bilayer
graphene, however no intercalation. Our investigations thus constitute the
first in situ study of metal atom sorption of different specificity on
free-standing graphene.

centres and others as visiting centres with extensive visiting programs for
luminaries from various basic sciences (Mathematics, Physics, Biology,
Economics, and Sociology) and students from various institutions around the

we briefly discuss the efforts that our institute has made (without any visible
success so far, as in the other attempts elsewhere). We then emphasise the
critical need for such an international centre to attract stalwarts in the
basic disciplinary fields as well as interested students from around the world
in order to comprehend the world's global socio-economic dynamics.

<h3>Fokker-Planck equation for the particle size distribution function in  KJMA transformations</h3>

<br>
<i>M. Tomellini</i>
<br>
<br>
The Fokker-Planck (FP) equation has been derived for describing the temporal
evolution of the particle size probability density function (PDF) for KJMA
(Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami) transformations. The classical case of
transformations with constant rates of both nucleation and growth, in 3D space,
has been considered. Integration of the equation shows that the PDF is given by
the superposition of one-parameter Gamma distributions with time dependent mean
size given by the KJMA theory. The asymptotic behavior of the FP solution
offers a demonstration of the conjecture, previously proposed by Pineda et al
[E. Pineda, P. Bruna, D. Crespo, Phys. Rev. E 70 (2004) 066119], according to
which the set of nuclei formed at the same time are Gamma-distributed, with
parameter depending on nucleus birth time. Computer simulations of the
transformation with constant nucleation and growth rates, do show that the
temporal evolution of the PDF, in the volume domain, is in good agreement with
the Johnson-Mehl PDF. The approach based on the FP equations provides a
particle size PDF that exhibits such behavior.

<h3>Hubbard bands, Mott transition and deconfinement in strongly correlated  systems</h3>

<br>
<i>V. Yu. Irkhin</i>
<br>
<br>
The problem of deconfinement phases in strongly correlated systems is
discussed. In space-time dimension $d=3+1$, a competition of confinement and
Coulomb phases occurs, but in $d=2+1$ the confining phase dominates owing to
monopole proliferation, but gapless fermion excitations can change the
situation. Combining the Kotliar-Ruckenstein representation and fractionalized
spin-liquid deconfinement picture, the Mott transition and Hubbard subbands are
treated, general expressions in the case of an arbitrary bare band spectrum
being obtained. The transition into a metallic state is determined by
condensation of a gapless boson mode. The spectrum picture in the insulating
state is considerably influenced by the spinon spin-liquid spectrum and hidden
Fermi surface.

<br>
<i>Markus Lysne, Michael Schüler, Philipp Werner</i>
<br>
<br>
We show how a quantum optical measurement scheme based on heterodyne
detection can be used to explore geometrical and topological properties of
condensed matter systems. Considering a 2D material placed in a cavity with a
coupling to the environment, we compute correlation functions of the photons
exiting the cavity and relate them to the hybrid light-matter state within the
cavity. Different polarizations of the intracavity field give access to all
components of the quantum geometric tensor on contours in the Brillouin zone
defined by the transition energy. Combining recent results based on the
metric-curvature correspondence with the measured quantum metric allows us to
characterize the topological phase of the material. Moreover, in systems where
$S_z$ is a good quantum number, the procedure also allows us to extract the
spin Chern number. As an interesting application, we consider a minimal model
for twisted bilayer graphene at the magic angle, and discuss the feasibility of
extracting the Euler number.

<h3>Rapid Reconstruction of 3-D Membrane Pore Structure Using a Single 2-D  Micrograph</h3>

<br>
<br>
Conventional 2-D scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is commonly used to
rapidly and qualitatively evaluate membrane pore structure. Quantitative 2-D
analyses of pore sizes can be extracted from SEM, but without information about
3-D spatial arrangement and connectivity, which are crucial to the
understanding of membrane pore structure. Meanwhile, experimental 3-D
reconstruction via tomography is complex, expensive, and not easily accessible.
Here, we employ data-science tools to demonstrate a proof-of-principle
reconstruction of the 3-D structure of a membrane using a single 2-D image
pulled from a 3-D tomographic data set. The reconstructed and experimental 3-D
structures were then directly compared, with important properties such as mean
pore radius, mean throat radius, coordination number and tortuosity differing
by less than 15%. The developed algorithm will dramatically improve the ability
of the membrane community to characterize membranes, accelerating the design
and synthesis of membranes with desired structural and transport properties.

<br>
<br>
The layered delafossite metal PdCrO$_2$ is a natural heterostructure of
highly conductive Pd layers Kondo coupled to localized spins in the adjacent
Mott insulating CrO$_2$ layers. At high temperatures $T$ it has a $T$-linear
resistivity which is not seen in the isostructural but non-magnetic PdCoO$_2$.
The strength of the Kondo coupling is known, as-grown crystals are extremely
high purity and the Fermi surface is both very simple and experimentally known.
It is therefore an ideal material platform in which to investigate 'Planckian
metal' physics. We do this by means of controlled introduction of point
disorder, measurement of the thermal conductivity and Lorenz ratio and studying
the sources of its high temperature entropy. The $T$-linear resistivity is seen
to be due mainly to elastic scattering and to arise from a sum of several
scattering mechanisms. Remarkably, this sum leads to a scattering rate within
10$\%$ of the Planckian value of $k_BT/$$\hbar$.

The ground-state phases of a quantum many-body system are characterized by an
order parameter, which changes abruptly at quantum phase transitions when an
external control parameter is varied. Interestingly, these concepts may be
extended to excited states, for which it is possible to define equivalent
excited-state quantum phase transitions. However, the experimental mapping of a
phase diagram of excited quantum states has not yet been demonstrated. Here we
present the experimental determination of the excited-state phase diagram of an
atomic ferromagnetic quantum gas, where, crucially, the excitation energy is
one of the control parameters. The obtained phase diagram exemplifies how the
extensive Hilbert state of quantum many-body systems can be structured by the
measurement of well-defined order parameters.

<br>
<br>
Magnetic skyrmions are topological quasiparticles whose non-volatility,
detectability, and mobility make them exciting candidates for low-energy
computing. Previous works have demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of
current-driven skyrmions in cascaded logic structures inspired by reversible
computing. As skyrmions can be propelled through the voltage-controlled
magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect with much greater efficiency, this work
proposes a VCMA-based skyrmion propagation mechanism that drastically reduces
energy dissipation. Additionally, we demonstrate the functionality of skyrmion
logic gates enabled by our novel voltage-based propagation and estimate its
energy efficiency relative to other logic schemes. The minimum dissipation of
this VCMA-driven magnetic skyrmion logic at 0 K is found to be $\sim$6$\times$
the room-temperature Landauer limit, indicating the potential for sub-Landauer
dissipation through further engineering.

<h3>Renewal processes with a trap under stochastic resetting</h3>

<br>
<i>Pascal Grange</i>
<br>
<br>
Renewal processes are zero-dimensional processes defined by independent
intervals of time between zero crossings or a random walker. The distribution
of the occupation times of the sign states are well studied (in particular, it
yields the arcsine law if the time intervals are drawn from a L\'evy stable law
of index $\theta=1/2$). We can subject them to stochastic resetting by setting
the position of the random walker to the origin at Poisson-distributed time
with rate $r$. We introduce an additional parameter, the probability $\beta$ of
keeping the sign state of the system at resetting time. Moreover, we introduce
a trap at the origin, which absorbs the process with a fixed probability at
each zero crossing. We obtain the mean lifetime of the process in closed form.
For time intervals drawn from a L\'evy stable distribution of parameter
$\theta$, the mean lifetime is finite for every positive value of the resetting
rate, but goes to infinity when $r$ goes to zero. If the sign-keeping
probability $\beta$ is higher than a critical level $\beta_c(\theta)$ (and
strictly lower than $1$), the mean lifetime exhibits two extrema as a function
of the resetting rate. Moreover, it goes to zero as $r^{-1}$ when $r$ goes to
infinity. On the other hand, there is a single minimum if $\beta$ is set to
one.

<br>
<br>
The impulsive excitation of ensembles of excitons or color centers by a
high-energy electron beam results in the observation of photon bunching in the
second-order correlation function of the cathodoluminescence generated by those
emitters. Photon bunching in cathodoluminescence microscopy can be used to
resolve the excited-state dynamics and the excitation and emission efficiency
of nanoscale materials, and it can be used to probe interactions between
emitters and nanophotonic cavities. Here, we report substantial changes in the
measured bunching induced by indirect electron interactions (with indirect
electron excitation inducing $g^{2}(0)$ values approaching $10^4$). This result
is critical to the interpretation of $g^{2}(\tau)$ in cathodoluminescence
microscopies, and, more importantly, it provides a foundation for the nanoscale
characterization of optical properties in beam-sensitive materials.

Bose-Einstain condensation occurs at an appropriate density of bosonic

<br>
<br>
We introduce the generalization of the Slave-Spin Mean-Field method to
broken-symmetry phases. Through a variational approach we derive the
single-particle energy shift in the mean-field equations which generates the
appropriate self-consistent field responsible for the stabilization of the
broken symmetry. With this correction the different flavours of the slave-spin
mean-field are actually the same method and they give identical results to
Kotliar-Ruckenstein slave-bosons and to the Gutzwiller approximation. We apply
our formalism to the N\'eel antiferromagnetic state and study it in
multi-orbital models as a function of the number of orbitals and Hund's
coupling strength, providing phase diagrams in the interaction-doping plane. We
show that the doped antiferromagnet in proximity of half-filling is typically
unstable towards insulator-metal and magnetic-non magnetic phase separation.
Hund's coupling extends the range of this antiferromagnet, and favors its phase
separation.

We introduce range-controlled random walks with hopping rates depending on
the range $\mathcal{N}$, that is, the total number of previously visited sites.
We analyze a one-parameter class of models with a hopping rate $\mathcal{N}^a$
and determine the large time behavior of the average range, as well as its
complete distribution in two limit cases. We find that the behavior drastically
changes depending on whether the exponent $a$ is smaller, equal, or larger than
the critical value, $a_d$, depending only on the spatial dimension $d$. When
$a>a_d$, the forager covers the infinite lattice in a finite time. The critical
exponent is $a_1=2$ and $a_d=1$ when $d\geq 2$. We also consider the case of
two foragers who compete for food, with hopping rates depending on the number
of sites each visited before the other. Surprising behaviors occur in one
dimension where a single walker dominates and finds most of the sites when
$a>1$, while for $a<1$, the walkers evenly explore the line. We compute the
gain of efficiency in visiting sites by adding one walker.
