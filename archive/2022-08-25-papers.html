<h3>Measurement-Prepared Quantum Criticality: from Ising model to gauge theory, and beyond</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11699v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11699v1</a>
<br>
<i>Jong Yeon Lee, Wenjie Ji, Zhen Bi, Matthew P. A. Fisher</i>
<br>
<br>
Measurements allow efficient preparation of interesting quantum many-body
states exhibiting long-range, topological, or fractonic orders. Here, we prove
that the so-called conformal quantum critical points (CQCP) can be obtained by
performing general single-site measurements in appropriate basis on the cluster
states in $d\geq2$. The equal-time correlators of the said states are described
by correlation functions of a certain $d$-dimensional classical model at the
critical temperature, featuring spatial conformal invariance. This establishes
an exact correspondence between the measurement-prepared critical states and
conformal field theories of a range of critical spin models, including familiar
Ising model and gauge theories among others. Furthermore, by mapping the
correlations of the measured quantum state into the statistical mechanics
problem, we establish the stability of long-range or topological orders with
respect to measurements deviating from the ideal setting, without any
post-selection. Therefore, our findings suggest a novel mechanism in which a
quantum critical wavefunction emerges, providing new practical ways to study
quantum phases and conformal quantum critical points.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11690v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11690v1</a>
<br>
<i>Zohar Nussinov, Gerardo Ortiz</i>
<br>
<br>
We establish, in the spirit of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem, lower bounds
on the spectral degeneracy of quantum systems with higher (Gauge Like)
symmetries with rather generic physical boundary conditions in an arbitrary
number of spatial dimensions. Contrary to applying twists or equivalent
adiabatic operations, we exploit the effects of modified boundary conditions.
When a general choice of boundary geometry is immaterial in approaching the
thermodynamic limit, systems that exhibit non-commuting Gauge Like symmetries,
such as the orbital compass model, must have an exponential (in the size of the
boundary) degeneracy of each of their spectral levels. We briefly discuss why,
in spite of the proven large degeneracy associated with infrared-ultraviolet
mixing, some systems may still exhibit conventional physical behaviors, i.e.,
of those of systems with non-extensive degeneracies, due to entropic "order by
disorder" type effects.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11657v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11657v1</a>
<br>
<i>Alexander P. Antonov, Sren Schweers, Artem Ryabov, Philipp Maass</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a simulation method for Brownian dynamics of hard spheres in one
dimension for arbitrary continuous external force fields. It is an event-driven
procedure based on the fragmentation and mergers of clusters formed by
particles in contact. It allows one to treat particle interactions in addition
to the hard-sphere exclusion as long as the corresponding interaction forces
are continuous functions of the particle coordinates. We furthermore develop a
treatment of sticky hard spheres as described by Baxter's contact interaction
potential.

</body><h3>Combining phylogeny and coevolution improves the inference of interaction partners among paralogous proteins</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11626v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11626v1</a>
<br>
<i>Carlos A. Gandarilla-Perez, Sergio Pinilla, Anne-Florence Bitbol, Martin Weigt</i>
<br>
<br>
Predicting protein-protein interactions from sequences is an important goal
of computational biology. Various sources of information can be used to this
end. Starting from the sequences of two interacting protein families, one can
use phylogeny or residue coevolution to infer which paralogs are specific
interaction partners within each species. We show that these two signals can be
combined to improve the performance of the inference of interaction partners
among paralogs. For this, we first align the sequence-similarity graphs of the
two families through simulated annealing, yielding a robust partial pairing. We
next use this partial pairing to seed a coevolution-based iterative pairing
algorithm. This combined method improves performance over either separate
method. The improvement obtained is striking in the difficult cases where the
average number of paralogs per species is large or where the total number of
sequences is modest.

</body><h3>Room-temperature coherent optical manipulation of single-hole spins in solution-grown perovskite quantum dots</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11614v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11614v1</a>
<br>
<i>Xuyang Lin, Yaoyao Han, Jingyi Zhu, Kaifeng Wu</i>
<br>
<br>
Manipulation of solid-state spin coherence is an important paradigm for
quantum information processing. Current systems either operate at very low
temperatures or are difficult to scale-up. Developing low-cost, scalable
materials whose spins can be coherently manipulated at room temperature is thus
highly-attractive for a sustainable future of quantum information science. Here
we report ambient-condition all-optical initialization, manipulation and
readout of single-hole spins in an ensemble of solution-grown CsPbBr3
perovskite QDs. Single-hole spins are obtained by sub-picosecond electron
scavenging following a circularly-polarized femtosecond-pulse excitation. A
transversal magnetic field induces spin precession, and a second off-resonance
femtosecond-pulse coherently rotates hole spins via strong light-matter
interaction. These operations accomplish nearly complete quantum-state control
of single-hole spins at room temperature.

</body><h3>Tuning the magnetic configuration of bilayer graphene quantum dot by twisting</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11603v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11603v1</a>
<br>
<i>Ma Luo</i>
<br>
<br>
Twistronic has recently attracted tremendous attention because the twisting
can engineer the bilayer graphene-like materials into varying types of strongly
correlated phases. In this paper, we study the twisting of bilayer graphene
(BLG) quantum dots (QDs) with hexagonal shape and zigzag edges. In the
untwisted BLG-QDs, the zigzag edges of graphene host spontaneous magnetism with
varying magnetic configurations. As a BLG-QD being adiabatically twisted, the
quantum state evolves as a function of the twisting angle. If the twisting
angle changes across certain critical value, the magnetic configuration of the
quantum state sharply changes. For the twisting process with increasing or
decreasing twisting angle, the number and value of the critical twisting angles
are different. Thus, the twisting process with the twisting angle increasing
and decreasing back and forth could enter a hysteresis loop. The twisting of
BLG QDs with adatom is also investigated. The tuning features of the magnetic
configuration of the twisted BLG-QDs could be applied for graphene-based
quantum memory devices.

</body><h3>An objective collapse model without state dependent stochasticity</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11584v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11584v1</a>
<br>
<i>Lotte Mertens, Matthijs Wesseling, Jasper van Wezel</i>
<br>
<br>
The impossibility of describing measurement in quantum mechanics while using
a quantum mechanical model for the measurement machine, remains one of its
central problems. Objective collapse theories attempt to resolve this problem
by proposing alterations to Schrodinger's equation. Here, we present a minimal
model for an objective collapse theory that, in contrast to previous proposals,
does not employ state dependent stochastic terms in its construction. It is an
explicit proof of principle that it is possible for Born's rule to emerge from
a stochastic evolution in which no properties of the stochastic process depend
on the state being evolved. We propose the presented model as a basis from
which more realistic objective collapse theories can be constructed.

</body><h3>Symmetry breaking/symmetry preserving circuits and symmetry restoration on quantum computers: A quantum many-body perspective</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11567v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11567v1</a>
<br>
<i>Denis Lacroix, Edgar Andres Ruiz Guzman, Pooja Siwach</i>
<br>
<br>
We discuss here some aspects related to symmetries of a quantum many-body
problem when trying to treat it on a quantum computer. Several features related
to symmetry conservation, symmetry breaking and possible symmetry restoration
are reviewed. After a brief discussion of some of the standard symmetries
relevant for many-particle systems, we discuss the advantage to encode directly
some symmetries in quantum ansatze, especially with the aim to reduce the
quantum register size. It is however well-known that the use of symmetry
breaking states can also be a unique way to incorporate specific internal
correlations when a spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs. These aspects are
discussed in the quantum computing context. Precise description of quantum
systems can however be achieved only when the symmetries that are initially
broken are properly restored. Several methods are introduced to perform
symmetry restoration on a quantum computer, for instance, purification of the
state by means of the Grover algorithm, use of the combination of Hadamard test
and oracle concepts, symmetry filtering by quantum phase estimation and by an
iterative independent set of Hadamard tests.

</body><h3>Driven Andreev molecule</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11541v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11541v1</a>
<br>
<i>Andriani Keliri, Benot Douot</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the three terminal S-QD-S-QD-S Josephson junction biased with
commensurate voltages. In the absence of an applied voltage, the Andreev bound
states on each quantum dot hybridize forming an `Andreev molecule'. However,
understanding of this system in a non-equilibrium setup is lacking. Applying a
dc voltage on the bijunction makes the system time-periodic, and the
equilibrium Andreev bound states evolve into a ladder of resonances with a
finite lifetime due to multiple Andreev reflections (MAR). Starting from the
time-periodic Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations we map the problem to a
tight-binding chain in the (infinite) Floquet space. The resolvent of this
non-Hermitian block matrix is obtained via a continued fraction method. We
numerically calculate the Floquet-Andreev spectra which could be probed by
local tunneling spectroscopy on the dots. We also consider the subgap current,
and show that the Floquet resonances determine the position of the MAR steps.
Proximity of the two dots causes splitting of the steps, while at large
distances we observe interference effects which cause oscillations in the I-V
curves. The latter effect should persist at very long distances.
<br>
<br>
</body><h3>Non-local Andreev reflection through Andreev molecular states in graphene Josephson junctions</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11536v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11536v1</a>
<br>
<i>Edurd Zsurka, Noel Plaszk, Pter Rakyta, Andor Kormnyos</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose that a device composed of two vertically stacked monolayer
graphene Josephson junctions can be used for Cooper pair splitting. The
hybridization of the Andreev bound states of the two Josephson junction can
facilitate non-local transport in this normal-superconductor hybrid structure,
which we study by calculating the non-local differential conductance. Assuming
that one of the graphene layers is electron and the other is hole doped, we
find that the non-local Andreev reflection can dominate the differential
conductance of the system. Our setup does not require the precise control of
junction length, doping, or superconducting phase difference, which could be an
important advantage for experimental realization.
<br>
<br>
</body><h3>Multitask quantum thermal machines and cooperative effects</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11531v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11531v1</a>
<br>
<i>Jincheng Lu, Zi Wang, Rongqian Wang, Jiebin Peng, Chen Wang, Jian-Hua Jiang</i>
<br>
<br>
The performance of nonequilibrium work extraction in thermoelectric devices
can be enhanced by introducing the phonon-assisted inelastic process. Herein,
we study phonon-thermoelectric devices where particle current and phononic heat
currents are coupled by dominating phonon-assisted inelastic process and fueled
by chemical potential difference and temperature biases and show that inelastic
thermoelectric setups have a much richer functionality diagram and can even
simultaneously perform multiple tasks, such as heat engines, refrigerators, and
heat pumps. From the viewpoint of entropy production, we study the efficiencies
and coefficients of performance of multi-task quantum thermal machines by
analyzing two typical thermoelectric devices and emphasize the role of the
inelastic scattering process and multiple biases in multiterminal setups. In a
three-terminal double-quantum-dot setup with a tunable gate, we show that it
performs two useful tasks due to the phonon-assisted inelastic process
dominating the transport. For four-terminal four-quantum-dot thermoelectric
device, we demonstrate that additional thermodynamic affinity furnishes the
system with both substantially enriched functionality diagrams and enhanced
efficiency. We also discuss unconventional transverse thermoelectric effects
originating from the phonon-assisted inelastic process in the linear response.
The cooperation between the longitudinal and transverse thermoelectric effects
in the three-terminal thermoelectric systems leads to markedly improved
performance of the thermal machines. Our work provides insights into optimizing
general thermoelectric devices.

</body><h3>Probing resonating valence bonds on a programmable germanium quantum simulator</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11505v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11505v1</a>
<br>
<i>Chien-An Wang, Corentin Dprez, Hanifa Tidjani, William I. L. Lawrie, Nico W. Hendrickx, Amir Sammak, Giordano Scappucci, Menno Veldhorst</i>
<br>
<br>
Simulations using highly tunable quantum systems may enable investigations of
condensed matter systems beyond the capabilities of classical computers.
Quantum dots and donors in semiconductor technology define a natural approach
to implement quantum simulation. Several material platforms have been used to
study interacting charge states, while gallium arsenide has also been used to
investigate spin evolution. However, decoherence remains a key challenge in
simulating coherent quantum dynamics. Here, we introduce quantum simulation
using hole spins in germanium quantum dots. We demonstrate extensive and
coherent control enabling the tuning of multi-spin states in isolated, paired,
and fully coupled quantum dots. We then focus on the simulation of resonating
valence bonds and measure the evolution between singlet product states which
remains coherent over many periods. Finally, we realize four-spin states with
$s$-wave and $d$-wave symmetry. These results provide means to perform
non-trivial and coherent simulations of correlated electron systems.

</body><h3>Reporter-spin-assisted T1 relaxometry</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11470v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11470v1</a>
<br>
<i>Zhiran Zhang, Maxime Joos, Dolev Bluvstein, Yuanqi Lyu, Ania C. Bleszynski Jayich</i>
<br>
<br>
A single spin quantum sensor can quantitatively detect and image fluctuating
electromagnetic fields via their effect on the sensor spin's relaxation time,
thus revealing important information about the target solid-state or molecular
structures. However, the sensitivity and spatial resolution of spin relaxometry
are often limited by the distance between the sensor and target. Here, we
propose an alternative approach that leverages an auxiliary reporter spin in
conjunction with a single spin sensor, a diamond nitrogen vacancy (NV) center.
We show that this approach can realize a 10^4 measurement speed improvement for
realistic working conditions and we experimentally verify the proposed method
using a single shallow NV center. Our work opens up a broad path of inquiry
into a range of possible spin systems that can serve as relaxation sensors
without the need for optical initialization and readout capabilities.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11463v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11463v1</a>
<br>
<i>Parijat Barman, Abhik Chakraborty, Denis Akimov, Ankit Kumar Singh, Tobias Meyer-Zedler, Xiaofei Wu, Carsten Ronning, Michael Schmitt, Jrgen Popp, Jer-Shing Huang</i>
<br>
<br>
The deployment of plasmonic nanostructures to enhance nonlinear signal
generation requires effective far-to-near field coupling and phase matching for
frequency conversion. While the latter can be easily achieved at plasmonic
hotspots, the former is an antenna problem that requires dedicated structural
design and optimization. Plasmonic gratings are a simple but effective platform
for nonlinear signal generation since they provide a well-defined momentum for
photon-plasmon coupling and local hotspots for frequency conversion. In this
work, a plasmonic azimuthally chirped grating (ACG), which provides spatially
resolved broadband momentum for photon-plasmon coupling, was exploited to
investigate the plasmonic enhancement effect in two nonlinear optical
processes, namely two-photon photoluminescence (TPPL) and second-harmonic
generation (SHG). The spatial distributions of the nonlinear signals were
determined experimentally by hyperspectral mapping with ultrashort pulsed
excitation. The experimental spatial distributions of nonlinear signals agree
very well with the analytical prediction based solely on photon-plasmon
coupling with the momentum of the ACG, revealing the antenna function of the
grating in plasmonic nonlinear signal generation. This work highlights the
importance of the antenna effect of the gratings for nonlinear signal
generation and provides insight into the enhancement mechanism of plasmonic
gratings in addition to local hotspot engineering.

Some political strategies to win elections over the last years were based
heavily on fomenting general distrust in information institutions and favoring
distrustful sources. The misinformation pandemic has the straightforward
consequence that people do not believe any information unless it is compatible
with their own beliefs. We present a simple model to study the emergence of
consensus in opinion pools of uncertain agents that trust (couple to) their
neighbors (information sources) with strength K. We focus the studies on
regular lattices and linear coupling. Depending on the coupling constant, K,
and the propensity to choose an opinion (the probability to manifest a given
opinion in solitude), p_0, we get regions where consensus is surely reached
even in infinity systems (K greater than or equal to K_c), regions where
not-consensus is the only steady state (K lesser than K_c), and a region where
consensus on any opinion is transitory with each agent presenting periods of
strong oscillation of opinions before changing polarization (p_0 equal to p_c
and K greater than or equal K_c. The first model in this last region presents
transition probabilities identical to the voter model (p_0 equal to p_c and K
equal to K_c). Different upbringings, exposition to education biased to a
single political view, and previous coexistence with opinion polarized people
can change the opinion of agents in isolation. We model such characteristics
with heterogeneous populations (p^i_0 not equal to p^j_0 for some pairs of
nodes i,j). Such systems present regions where the coexistence of local
consensus (bulk-stable clusters of like-minded opinions), weak consensus
(bulk-unstable temporary clusters where contrary opinions emerge inside the

Metallic systems exhibit plasmons as elementary excitations. This fundamental
concept was reinforced also in high-temperature cuprate superconductors
recently, although cuprates are not only layered systems but also strongly
correlated electron systems. Here, we study how such ubiquitous plasmons leave
their marks on the electron dispersion in cuprates. In contrast to phonons and
magnetic fluctuations, plasmons do not yield a kink in the electron dispersion.
Instead, we find that the optical plasmon accounts for an emergent band --
plasmarons -- in the one-particle excitation spectrum; acoustic-like plasmons
typical to a layered system are far less effective. Because of strong electron
correlations, the plasmarons are generated by bosonic fluctuations associated
with the local constraint, not by the usual charge-density fluctuations,
although both equally describe plasmons. Apart from this physical mechanism, a
mathematical structure to host the plasmarons is similar to a weak coupling
scheme discussed in alkali metals, Bi, graphene, monolayer transition-metal
dichalcogenides, semiconductors, diamond, two-dimensional electron systems, and
SrIrO3 films, establishing a concept of plasmarons in metallic systems in
general. Plasmarons are realized below (above) the quasiparticle band in
electron-doped (hole-doped) cuprates, including a region around (pi,0) and
(0,pi) where the superconducting gap and the pseudogap are most enhanced.
