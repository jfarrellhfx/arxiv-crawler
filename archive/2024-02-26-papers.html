<h3>Giant resonant skew scattering of plasma waves in graphene off a  micromagnet</h3>

<i>Cooper Finnigan, Dmitry K. Efimkin</i>
<p>Electron skew scattering by impurities is one of the major mechanisms behind
the anomalous Hall effect in ferromagnetic nanostructures. It is particularly
strong at the surface of topological insulators where the Dirac equation
governs electron dynamics. Motivated by recently discovered mappings between
hydrodynamics and spin-1 Dirac equations, we consider the scattering of plasma
waves -- propagating charge density oscillations -- excited in graphene off a
non-uniform magnetic field created by an adjacent circular micromagnet. The
calculated scattering amplitude not only exhibits a giant asymmetry, or
skewness, but is resonantly enhanced if the frequency of the incoming wave
matches the frequency of the trapped mode circulating the micromagnet in only
one direction. Furthermore, if the frequency of incoming waves exceeds the
Larmor frequency, the angular distribution of scattered plasma waves is
indistinguishable from the one of Dirac electrons at the surface of a
topological insulator scattering off a magnetic impurity. The micrometer scale
of the proposed setup enables direct investigations of individual skew
scattering events previously inaccessible in electronic systems.

<h3>Stokes Law at Molecular Length Scales: Effects of Intermolecular  Interactions and Linear Response Theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16301" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16301</a>

<i>Subhajit Acharya, Biman Bagchi</i>
<p>The celebrated Stokes Law (SL) of hydrodynamics predicts that the velocity of
a particle pulled through a liquid by an external force, Fex, is directly
proportional to the force and inversely proportional to the friction {\zeta}
acted by the medium on the particle. We investigate the range of validity of
Stokes Law at molecular length scales by employing computer simulations to
calculate friction by pulling a tagged particle with a constant force. We thus
calculate friction for two model interaction potentials, Lennard-Jones, and
soft sphere, for several particle sizes, ranging from radius (a) smaller than
the solvent particles to three times larger. We next obtain friction from
diffusion (D) by using Einstein's relation between diffusion and friction
{\zeta} in an unperturbed liquid. We find, to our surprise, a quantitative
agreement between the two at a small-to-intermediate pulling force regime for
all the sizes studied. The Law does break down at a large pulling force beyond
a threshold value. Importantly, the range of validity of Stokes' scheme to
obtain friction increases substantially if we turn off the attractive part of
the interaction potential. Additionally, we calculate the viscosity ({\eta}) of
the unperturbed liquid and find a good agreement with the Stokes-Einstein
relation {\zeta}=C{\eta}a for the viscosity dependence with a value of C close
to 5 {\pi}, that is intermediate between the slip and stick boundary condition.

<h3>Numerical investigation of the structure factors of the Read-Rezayi  series</h3>

<h3>Interplay of superexchange and vibronic effects in the hidden order of  Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ unravelled from first principles</h3>

<i>Dario Fiore Mosca, Cesare Franchini, Leonid V. Pourovskii</i>
<p>The origin of the "hidden" quadrupolar and unconventional magnetic
low-temperature orders observed in the spin-orbit double perovskite
Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ defies explanation through standard experimental and
theoretical techniques. Here we address this problem by deriving and solving an
ab initio low-temperature effective Hamiltonian including inter-site electronic
exchange and vibronic (electron-lattice) couplings between $J_{eff}=3/2$
Jahn-Teller-active Rhenium states. Our findings disclose the nature of these
elusive states, attributing it to intertwined exchange and electron-lattice
couplings, thus diverging from the conventional dichotomy of purely electronic
or lattice driving mechanisms. Our results indicate the resilience of the
quadrupolar hidden order under pressure, yet its rapid suppression under
uniaxial strain suggests that external or lattice-induced distortions play a
pivotal role in determining the relative stability of competing phases in
Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ and similar $d^1$ double perovskites.

<h3>Restoring the fluctuation-dissipation theorem in Kardar-Parisi-Zhang  universality class through a new emergent fractal dimension</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15576" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15576</a>
<br>
<i>Márcio S. Gomes-Filho, Pablo de Castro, Danilo B. Liarte, Fernando A. Oliveira</i>
<p>The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation describes a wide range of growth-like
phenomena, with applications in physics, chemistry and biology. There are three
central questions in the study of KPZ growth: the determination of height
probability distributions; the search for ever more precise universal growth
exponents; and the apparent absence of a fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT)
for spatial dimension $d>1$. Notably, these questions were answered exactly
only for $1+1$ dimensions. In this work, we propose a new FDT valid for the KPZ
problem in $d+1$ dimensions. This is done by rearranging terms and identifying
a new correlated noise which we argue to be characterized by a fractal
dimension $d_n$. We present relations between the KPZ exponents and two
emergent fractal dimensions, namely $d_f$, of the rough interface, and $d_n$.
Also, we simulate KPZ growth to obtain values for transient versions of the
roughness exponent $\alpha$, the surface fractal dimension $d_f$ and, through
our relations, the noise fractal dimension $d_n$. Our results indicate that KPZ
may have at least two fractal dimensions and that, within this proposal, a FDT
is restored. Finally, we provide new insights into the old question about the
upper critical dimension of the KPZ universality class.

<h3>Probabilistic Prediction of Material Stability: Integrating Convex Hulls  into Active Learning</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15582" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15582</a>
<br>
<i>Andrew Novick, Diana Cai, Quan Nguyen, Roman Garnett, Ryan Adams, Eric Toberer</i>
<p>Active learning is a valuable tool for efficiently exploring complex spaces,
finding a variety of uses in materials science. However, the determination of
convex hulls for phase diagrams does not neatly fit into traditional active
learning approaches due to their global nature. Specifically, the thermodynamic
stability of a material is not simply a function of its own energy, but rather
requires energetic information from all other competing compositions and
phases. Here we present Convex hull-aware Active Learning (CAL), a novel
Bayesian algorithm that chooses experiments to minimize the uncertainty in the
convex hull. CAL prioritizes compositions that are close to or on the hull,
leaving significant uncertainty in other compositions that are quickly
determined to be irrelevant to the convex hull. The convex hull can thus be
predicted with significantly fewer observations than approaches that focus
solely on energy. Intrinsic to this Bayesian approach is uncertainty
quantification in both the convex hull and all subsequent predictions (e.g.,
stability and chemical potential). By providing increased search efficiency and
uncertainty quantification, CAL can be readily incorporated into the emerging
paradigm of uncertainty-based workflows for thermodynamic prediction.

<h3>An experimental scheme for determining the Berry phase in  two-dimensional quantum materials with a flat band</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15596" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15596</a>
<br>
<i>Li-Li Ye, Cheng-Zhen Wang, Ying-Cheng Lai</i>
<p>Experimentally feasible methods to determine the Berry phase, a fundamental
quantity characterizing a quantum material, are often needed in applications.
We develop an approach to detecting the Berry phase by using a class of
two-dimensional (2D) Dirac materials with a flat band, the
$\alpha$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattices. The properties of this class of quantum
materials are controlled by a single parameter $0 \le \alpha \le 1$, where the
left and right endpoints correspond to graphene with pseudospin-1/2 and the
dice lattice with pseudospin-1 Dirac-Weyl quasiparticles, respectively, and
each specific value of $\alpha$ represents a material with a unique Berry
phase. Applying a constant electric field to the $\alpha$-$\mathcal{T}_3$
lattice, we calculate the resulting electric current and find a one-to-one
correspondence between the current and the Berry phase in both the linear and
nonlinear response regimes. In the linear (Kubo) regime, the main physics is
the Zitterbewegung effect. In the nonlinear regime, the Schwinger mechanism
dominates. Beyond the nonlinear regime, Bloch-Zener oscillations can arise.
Measuring the current thus provides an effective and experimentally feasible
way to determine the Berry phase for this spectrum of 2D quantum materials.

<h3>Minimal Models for Altermagnetism</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15616" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15616</a>
<br>
<i>Mercè Roig, Andreas Kreisel, Yue Yu, Brian M. Andersen, Daniel F. Agterberg</i>
<p>Altermagnets feature vanishing net magnetization, like antiferromagnets, but
exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking and momentum-dependent spin-split band
structures. Motivated by the prevalence of altermagnetic materials with
non-symmorphic symmetry-dictated band degeneracies, we provide realistic
minimal models for altermagnetism by constructing tight-binding models for
nonsymmorphic space groups with a sublattice defined by two magnetic atoms.
These models can be applied to monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal,
rhombohedral, hexagonal, and cubic materials and can describe d-wave, g-wave,
and i-wave altermagnetism. By examining the altermagnetic susceptibility and
mean field instabilities within a Hubbard model we reveal that these models
have altermagnetic ground states and yield a Berry curvature that is linear in
the spin-orbit coupling. We apply our models to RuO$_2$, MnF$_2$, FeSb$_2$,
$\kappa$-Cl, and CrSb.

<h3>Role of chalcogen vacancies and hydrogen in the optical and electrical  properties of bulk transition-metal dichalcogenides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15618" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15618</a>
<br>
<i>Shoaib Khalid, Anderson Janotti, Bharat Medasani</i>
<p>Like in any other semiconductor, point defects in transition-metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) are expected to strongly impact their electronic and
optical properties. However, identifying defects in these layered
two-dimensional materials has been quite challenging with controversial
conclusions despite the extensive literature in the past decade. Using
first-principles calculations, we revisit the role of chalcogen vacancies and
hydrogen impurity in bulk TMDs, reporting formation energies and thermodynamic
and optical transition levels. We show that the S vacancy can explain recently
observed cathodoluminescence spectra of MoS$_2$ flakes and predict similar
optical levels in the other TMDs. In the case of the H impurity, we find it
more stable sitting on an interstitial site in the Mo plane, acting as a
shallow donor, and possibly explaining the often observed n-type conductivity
in some TMDs. We also predict the frequencies of the local vibration modes for
the H impurity, aiding its identification through Raman or infrared
spectroscopy.

<h3>The influence of Structural Dynamics in Two-Dimensional Hybrid  Organic-Inorganic Perovskites on their Photoluminescence Efficiency --  Neutron scattering analysis</h3>

<i>Haritha Sindhu Rajeev, Xiao Hu, Wei-Liang Chen, Depei Zhang, Tianran Chen, Maiko Kofu, Ryoichi Kajimoto, Mitsutaka Nakamura, Alexander Z. Chen, Mina Yoon, Yu-Ming Chang, Joshua J. Choi, Seung-Hun Lee</i>
<p>Two-dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have emerged as
promising materials for light-emitting diode applications. In this study, by
using time-of-flight neutron spectroscopy we identified and quantitatively
separated the lattice vibrational and molecular rotational dynamics of two
perovskites, butylammonium lead iodide $(\text{BA})_{2}\text{PbI}_{4}$ and
phenethyl-ammonium lead iodide $\text{(PEA)}_{2}\text{PbI}_{4}$. By examining
the corresponding temperature dependence, we found that the lattice vibrations,
as evidenced by neutron spectra, are consistent with the lattice dynamics
obtained from Raman scattering. We revealed that the rotational dynamics of
organic molecules in these materials tend to suppress their photoluminescence
quantum yield while the vibrational dynamics did not show predominant
correlations with their optoelectronic properties. This study proposes that the
rotational motions of the polarized molecules could significantly interrupt the
exciton binding energy potential, cause the exciton dissociations, enhance the
non-radiative recombination rates, and hence reduce the photoluminescence
yield. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental
interactions in 2D HOIPs and may guide the design of more efficient
light-emitting materials for advanced technological applications.

<h3>Effects of Non-local Pseudopotentials on the Electrical and Thermal  Transport Properties of Aluminum: A Density Functional Theory Study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15706" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15706</a>
<br>
<i>Qianrui Liu, Mohan Chen</i>
<p>Accurate prediction of electron transport coefficients is crucial for
understanding warm dense matter. Utilizing the density functional theory (DFT)
with the Kubo-Greenwood formula is widely used to evaluate the electrical and
thermal conductivities of electrons. By adding the non-local potential
correction term that appears in the dynamic Onsager coefficient and using two
different norm-conserving pseudopotentials, we predict the electrical and
thermal conductivities of electrons for liquid Al (1000 K) and warm dense Al
(0.2 to 10 eV). We systematically investigate the effects of non-local terms in
the pseudopotentials and the frozen-core approximation on the conductivities.
We find that taking into account the non-local potential correction and
validating the frozen core approximation is essential for accurately
calculating the electrical and thermal transport properties of electrons across
a wide range of temperatures.

<h3>Observation of the In-plane Anomalous Hall Effect induced by Octupole in  Magnetization Space</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15741" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15741</a>
<br>
<i>Wenzhi Peng, Zheng Liu, Haolin Pan, Peng Wang, Yulong Chen, Jiachen Zhang, Xuhao Yu, Jinhui Shen, Mingmin Yang, Qian Niu, Yang Gao, Dazhi Hou</i>
<p>The Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE) manifests as a transverse voltage
proportional to magnetization in ferromagnetic materials under the application
of a charge current, being an indispensable tool for probing magnetism,
especially in nanoscale devices. However, the AHE primarily sensitizes to
out-of-plane magnetization, thereby hindering its capacity to discern the
in-plane magnetization, a characteristic prevalent in ferromagnetic films. Here
we challenge this conventional understanding by demonstrating the in-plane
magnetization-induced AHE in iron and nickel, two ubiquitous ferromagnets. This
observation of the in-plane AHE is remarkable as it contradicts existing
theories that forbid such phenomena in cubic crystal systems. We trace the
origin of this unanticipated phenomenon to a hitherto unconsidered octupole of
the anomalous Hall conductivity in the magnetization space, a mechanism we
propose could enable the detection of in-plane AHE in a wide range of
ferromagnetic materials. This work realizes the in-plane AHE in common
ferromagnets by exploiting the anomalous Hall conductivity octupole, revealing
a new physical origin of the AHE and promising to revolutionize the design of
magnetic devices and sensors.

<h3>Tunable incommensurability and spontaneous symmetry breaking in the  reconstructed moiré-of-moiré lattices</h3>

<p>Imposing incommensurable periodicity on the periodic atomic lattice can lead
to complex structural phases consisting of locally periodic structure bounded
by topological defects. Twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) is an ideal material
platform to study the interplay between different atomic periodicities, which
can be tuned by twist angles between the layers, leading to moir\'e-of-moir\'e
lattices. Interlayer and intralayer interactions between two interfaces in TTG
transform this moir\'e-of-moir\'e lattice into an intricate network of domain
structures at small twist angles, which can harbor exotic electronic behaviors.
Here we report a complete structural phase diagram of TTG with atomic scale
lattice reconstruction. Using transmission electron microscopy combined with a
new interatomic potential simulation, we show that a cornucopia of large-scale
moir\'e lattices, ranging from triangular, kagome, and a corner-shared
hexagram-shaped domain pattern, are present. For small twist angles below
0.1{\deg}, all domains are bounded by a network of two-dimensional domain wall
lattices. In particular, in the limit of small twist angles, the competition
between interlayer stacking energy and the formation of discommensurate domain
walls leads to unique spontaneous symmetry breaking structures with nematic
orders, suggesting the pivotal role of long-range interactions across entire
layers. The diverse tessellation of distinct domains, whose topological network
can be tuned by the adjustment of the twist angles, establishes TTG as a
platform for exploring the interplay between emerging quantum properties and
controllable nontrivial lattices.

<h3>The power-spectrum tensor in steady-state systems and its role in  quantum friction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15777" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15777</a>
<br>
<i>F. Intravaia, K. Busch</i>
<p>For systems in equilibrium, quantum statistical physics provides a number of
general theorems and relations that are not tied to specific microscopic
models, one example being the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Much less is
known for nonequilibrium situations. In this work, we discuss certain
properties of the power-spectrum tensor for systems in general steady-states,
i.e. stationary states not necessarily corresponding to equilibrium
configurations. In our analyses, we do not make any direct connection to
specific models for the underlying microscopic dynamics and, therefore, our
results can be applied to a large variety of systems. We also connect the
power-spectrum tensor to other quantities that characterize these systems and,
where appropriate, compare with the equilibrium counterparts. As an
application, we consider the specific problem of quantum friction, where, at
zero temperature, a contactless quantum-electrodynamic drag force acts on a
particle that moves in close proximity to an arrangement of material bodies.
Specifically, we show how the additional information about the system's physics
facilitates the derivation of more precise constraints on the power spectrum
and its functional dependencies.

<h3>Prediction of Superionic State in LiH2 at Conditions Enroute to Nuclear  Fusion</h3>

<i>Fude Li, Hao Wang, Jinlong Li, Hua Y. Geng</i>
<p>Hydrogen and lithium, along with their compounds, are crucial materials for
nuclear fusion research. High-pressure studies have revealed intricate
structural transitions in all these materials. However, research on lithium
hydrides beyond LiH has mostly focused on the low-temperature regime. Here, we
use density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to
investigate the behavior of LiH2, a hydrogen-rich compound, near its melting
point. Our study is particularly relevant to the low-pressure region of the
compression pathway of lithium hydrides toward fusion. We discovered a
premelting superionic phase transition in LiH2 that has significant
implications for its mass transportation, elastic properties, and sound
velocity. The theoretical boundary for the superionic transition and melting
temperature was then determined. In contrast, we also found that the primary
compound of lithium hydrides, LiH, does not exhibit a superionic transition.
These findings have important implications for optimizing the compression path
to achieve the ignition condition in inertial confinement fusion research,
especially when lithium tritium-deuteride(LiTD) are used as the fuel.

<h3>Prediction of novel ordered phases in U-X (X= Zr, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Y, Nb,  Mo, Hf, Ta, W) binary alloys under high pressure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15793" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15793</a>
<br>
<i>Xiao L. Pan, Hong X. Song, H. Wang, F. C. Wu, Y. C. Gan, Xiang R. Chen, Ying Chen, Hua Y. Geng</i>
<p>U-based binary alloys have been widely adopted in fast nuclear reactors, but
their stability under extreme conditions of high-pressure is almost unknown,
mounting up to latent risk in applications. Here, possible ordered phases in
U-Zr system up to 200 GPa are comprehensively investigated by unbiased
first-principles structure prediction. Stable U2Zr, metastable U3Zr and U4Zr
phases are discovered for the first time, which exhibit strong stability under
compression. They all are metallic, with 5f electrons of uranium dominating the
electronic density of states near the Fermi level. Prominent ionic interactions
between U and Zr atoms, as well as covalent interactions between adjacent
uranium atoms, are found. The same strategy is applied to explore the stability
of ordered phases in other U-based binary transition metal alloys, U-X (X= Sc,
Ti, V, Cr, Y, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W). Stable and metastable ordered phases similar
to U-Zr alloy are unveiled, all with similar electronic structures. For these
alloys, we find that the structure of U2X (X=Zr, Ti, Hf) hosts a unique hybrid
phase transition similar to U2Nb, which is a superposition of a first-order
transition and a second-order transition. The prediction of these novel phases
not only refutes the stability of the long-believed ordered phase I4/mmm-U2Mo,
but also rewrites the phase diagrams of U-X (X= Zr, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Nb, Mo, Hf,
Ta) alloys under high pressure. All of these findings promote our understanding
of the high-pressure behavior of the broad category of U-based binary alloys
with transition metals.

<h3>Universal Metallic Surface States in Electride</h3>

<br>
<i>Dan Wang, Hongxing Song, Leilei Zhang, Hao Wang, Yi Sun, Fengchao Wu, Ying Chen, Xiangrong Chen, Hua Y. Geng</i>
<p>Robust metallic surface states (MSS) of topological insulator (TI) against
imperfections and perturbations are important in broad applications such as
chemical catalysis and quantum computing. Unfortunately, they are suffered from
the narrow band gap that can be accessed. Searching for MSS with large bulk
band gap beyond conventional TIs becomes a quest. In this work, inspired by the
adiabatic connection principle in real space, we identify that all electrides,
a new class of emerging materials, must host robust and universal MSS that
resists any disturbances, in spite of the fact that some of them could be
classified as trivial in standard topology theory. This counterintuitive
property is traced to the specific charge localization-delocalization change
intrinsic to electride when approaching the crystalline surface or interface,
which is a kind of interstice-centered to atom-centered transition in the
real-space topology of the charge density distribution, and is sharply
different from the band inversion in the standard topology theory. The new
mechanism circumvents the obstacle that limits the band gap of TI. Robust and
universal MSS in an electride that conventionally-determined as trivial but
with a colossal band gap beyond 6.13 eV are demonstrated. This gap size is
about 6-fold larger than the highest record of known "wide-gap" TIs, thus opens
up new avenues to universal MSS with gigantic bulk gap.

<h3>Topological and superconducting properties of two-dimensional C6-2x(BN)x  biphenylene network: a first-principles investigation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15801" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15801</a>
<br>
<i>Guang F. Yang, Hong X. Song, Dan Wang, Hao Wang, Hua Y. Geng</i>
<p>First-principles calculations have been used to investigate the electronic
and topological properties of the two-dimensional C6-2x(BN)x biphenylene
network, a graphene-like structure composed of not only hexagonal ring but also
octagonal and square rings. Nontrivial topological properties have been found
in two of them, with a stoichiometry of C4BN and C2(BN)2. The former C4BN is
predicted to be a type-II Dirac semimetal with a superconducting critical
temperature Tc=0.38K, which is similar to the pure carbon biphenylene network
(C-BPN). The latter shows a novel isolated edge state exists between the
conduction and valence bands. By regulation of strains and virtual-crystal
approximation calculations, we found the annihilation of two pairs of Dirac
points (DPs) in the non-high symmetric region (non-HSR) causes the two
corresponding edge states stick together to generate this isolated edge state.
In addition, we found that one pair of DPs arises from the shift of DPs in the
C-BPN, while another new pair of DPs emerges around the Time Reversal Invariant
Momenta (TRIM) point X due to the doping of boron and nitrogen. We constructed
a tight-binding (TB) model to reveal the mechanism of forming the isolated edge
state from the C-BPN to C2(BN)2. This study not only demonstrates the existence
and mechanism of forming the isolated edge state in semimetals, but also
provides an example in which the DPs can move away from the high-symmetry
region.

<i>Koji Inui, Yukitoshi Motome</i>
<p>Solving inverse problems to identify Hamiltonians with desired properties
holds promise for the discovery of fundamental principles. In quantum systems,
quantum entanglement plays a pivotal role in not only characterizing the
quantum nature but also developing quantum technology like quantum computing.
Nonetheless, the design principles of the quantum entanglement are yet to be
clarified. Here we apply an inverse design framework using automatic
differentiation to quantum spin systems, aiming to construct Hamiltonians with
large quantum entanglement. We show that the method automatically finds the
Kitaev model with bond-dependent anisotropic interactions, whose ground state
is a quantum spin liquid, on both honeycomb and square-octagon lattices. On
triangular and maple-leaf lattices with geometrical frustration, it generates
numerous solutions with spatially inhomogeneous interactions rather than
converging to a specific model, but it still helps to construct unprecedented
models. The comparative study reveals that bond-dependent anisotropic
interactions, rather than isotropic Heisenberg interactions, amplify quantum
entanglement, even in systems with geometrical frustration. The present study
paves the way for the automatic design of new quantum systems with desired
quantum nature and functionality.

<i>Leo S.I. Lam, Gautham Gopinath, Zichen Zhao, Shuling Wang, Chun-Shing Lee, Hai-Yao Deng, Feng Wang, Yilong Han, Cho-Tung Yip, Chi-Hang Lam</i>
<p>The nature of glassy dynamics and the glass transition are long-standing
problems under active debate. In the presence of a structural disorder widely
believed to be an essential characteristic of structural glass, identifying and
understanding key dynamical behaviors are very challenging. In this work, we
demonstrate that an energetic disorder, which usually results from a structural
disorder, is instead a more essential feature of glass. Specifically, we
develop a distinguishable-particle glassy crystal (DPGC) in which particles are
ordered in a face-centered cubic lattice and follow particle-dependent random
interactions, leading to an energetic disorder in the particle configuration
space. Molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of vacancy-induced
particle diffusion show typical glassy behaviors. A unique feature of this
molecular model is the knowledge of the complete set of inherent structures
with easily calculable free energies, implying a well-understood potential
energy landscape. Due to its simplicity, the study of the DPGC provides a
promising direction to unlock the mysteries of glass.

<h3>Collective excitations in two-dimensional harmonically trapped quantum  droplets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15811" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15811</a>
<br>
<i>Yifan Fei, Xucong Du, Xiao-Long Chen, Yunbo Zhang</i>
<p>The collective excitation modes in quantum droplets trapped in a
two-dimensional harmonic potential in the context of symmetric weakly
interacting binary bosonic mixtures are studied. By utilizing the linearization
technique, the time-dependent extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and a
sum-rule approach with a variational approximation, the ground state properties
and collective excitations of such a two-dimensional quantum system are
investigated for various system parameters. We present comprehensive analysis
and calculations on the effect of the confinement strength and anisotropy of
the trapping potential, the number of atoms in the droplet, and the collective
excitation modes. The radius of the droplet, as well as the chemical potential,
is non-monotonically related to the number of atoms in the droplet, and the
confinement tends to shift the minimum values towards the ideal gas limit. The
excitation frequency peaks, which are prominent in a self-bounded droplet,
become less pronounced and smoother when subjected to a strong trapping
potential. The sum-rule approach fails to reproduce the breathing mode
frequency for a moderate number of atoms in a weak trapping potential, however,
works perfectly well in a strong confinement. It was found that the anisotropy
in the trap eliminates the degeneracy between the quadrupole and scissors modes
that occurs in an isotropic trap, causing the frequencies of these two modes to
immediately diverge from each other for any degree of anisotropy. These
findings provide valuable insights into the unique characteristics and behavior
of quantum droplets, offering potential implications for future research and
applications in the dynamic behaviors of intriguing quantum droplets.

<h3>Role of strong correlation and spin-orbit coupling in  $\textrm{LuB}_{4}$: a first principle study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15822" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15822</a>
<br>
<i>Ismail Sk, Joydeep Chatterjee, A. Taraphder, Nandan Pakhira</i>
<p>The recent observation of magnetization plateaus in rare-earth metallic
tetraborides has drawn a lot of attention to this class of materials. In this
work, we investigate the electronic structure of one such canonical system
$\textrm{LuB}_{4}$, using first-principle density functional theory, together
with strong Coulomb correlation and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects. The
electronic band structures show that $\textrm{LuB}_{4}$ is a non-magnetic
correlated metal with completely filled $4f$ shell. The projected density of
states (DOS) shows a continuum at the Fermi level (FL), arising mainly from
hybridized Lu $d$ and B $p$ orbitals, along with some discrete peaks, well
separated from the continuum. These peaks arise mainly due to core-level Lu
$s$, $p$ and $4f$ atomic orbitals. Upon inclusion of SOC, the discrete peak
arising due to Lu $p$ is split into two peaks with $j = 1/2$, $j = 3/2$ while
the peak arising due to Lu $4f$ orbitals splits into two peaks with $j = 5/2$
and $j = 7/2$. These peaks will give rise to multiplet structure in core level
X-ray photo-emission spectroscopy. Inclusion of strong correlation effects
pushes the Lu $4f$ peak away from the FL while the qualitative features remain
intact.

<h3>Steerable current-driven emission of spin waves in magnetic vortex pairs</h3>

<i>Sabri Koraltan, Katrin Schultheiss, Florian Bruckner, Markus Weigand, Claas Abert, Dieter Suess, Sebastian Wintz</i>
<p>The efficient excitation of spin waves is a key challenge in the realization
of magnonic devices. We demonstrate the current-driven generation of spin waves
in antiferromagnetically coupled magnetic vortices. We employ time-resolved
scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (TR-STXM) to directly image the emission
of spin waves upon the application of an alternating current flowing directly
through the magnetic stack. Micromagnetic simulations allow us to identify the
origin of the excitation to be the current-driven Oersted field, which in the
present system proves to be orders of magnitude more efficient than the
commonly used excitation via stripline antennas. Our numerical studies also
reveal that the spin-transfer torque can lead to the emission of spin waves as
well, yet only at much higher current amplitudes. By using magnetostrictive
materials, we futhermore demonstrate that the direction of the magnon
propagation can be steered by increasing the excitation amplitude, which
modifies the underlying magnetization profile through an additional anisotropy
in the magnetic layers. The demonstrated methods allow for the efficient and
tunable excitation of spin waves, marking a significant advance in the
generation and control of spin waves in magnonic devices.

<p>A supersolid is a quantum entangled state of matter that combines features of
both superfluids and solids. Despite predictions of its analog in quantum
magnets, the experimental realization was lacking until recent claims in
triangular-lattice compounds. Here, we report the magnetic phase diagram and
neutron scattering for a spin-1/2 triangular-lattice antiferromagnet,
K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$. In zero field, neutron spectroscopy reveals the gradual
development of a $\sqrt3 \times sqrt3$ magnetic order associated with $Z_3$
symmetry breaking for temperatures 5 K < T < 15 K. Below 5 K, the emergence of
a Goldstone mode from low-energy continuum scattering suggests that the system
enters a supersolid phase characterized by the breaking of both $Z_3$ and spin
rotational U(1) symmetry. In c-axis-oriented magnetic fields 1.1 T < B < 21 T,
a prominent 1/3 magnetization plateau phase emerges, accompanied by a distinct
high-field supersolid phase (18 T < B < 21 T). From the coherent spin wave
excitations in the 1/3 magnetized plateau phase, we infer the spin Hamiltonian,
which features nearest neighbor interactions with $J_z$ = 2.98(2) meV and
$J_{\rm perp}$ = 0.21(3) meV. Our work demonstrates that K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$
is a spectacular example of a spin-1/2 triangular-lattice quantum Ising
antiferromagnet, documents its magnetic phase diagram highlighting two
supersolid phases, and provides spectroscopic evidence of zero-field
supersolidity.

<p>The integration of low-energy states into bottom-up engineered graphene
nanoribbons (GNRs) is a robust strategy for realizing materials with tailored
electronic band structure for nanoelectronics. Low-energy zero-modes (ZMs) can
be introduced into nanographenes (NGs) by creating an imbalance between the two
sublattices of graphene. This phenomenon is exemplified by the family of
[n]triangulenes. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of [3]triangulene-GNRs, a
regioregular one-dimensional (1D) chain of [3]triangulenes linked by
five-membered rings. Hybridization between ZMs on adjacent [3]triangulenes
leads to the emergence of a narrow band gap, Eg = 0.7 eV, and topological end
states that are experimentally verified using scanning tunneling spectroscopy
(STS). Tight-binding and first-principles density functional theory (DFT)
calculations within the local spin density approximation (LSDA) corroborate our
experimental observations. Our synthetic design takes advantage of a selective
on-surface head-to-tail coupling of monomer building blocks enabling the
regioselective synthesis of [3]triangulene-GNRs. Detailed ab initio theory
provides insight into the mechanism of on-surface radical polymerization,
revealing the pivotal role of Au-C bond formation/breakage in driving
selectivity.

<h3>Investigating the basis set convergence of diagrammatically decomposed  coupled-cluster correlation energy contributions for the uniform electron gas</h3>

<br>
<i>Nikolaos Masios, Felix Hummel, Andreas Grüneis, Andreas Irmler</i>
<p>We investigate the convergence of coupled-cluster correlation energies and
related quantities with respect to the employed basis set size for the uniform
electron gas to gain a better understanding of the basis set incompleteness
error. To this end, coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) theory is applied to the
three dimensional uniform electron gas for a range of densities, basis set
sizes and electron numbers. We present a detailed analysis of individual,
diagrammatically decomposed contributions to the amplitudes at the level of CCD
theory. In particular, we show that only two terms from the amplitude equations
contribute to the asymptotic large-momentum behavior of the transition
structure factor, corresponding to the cusp region at short interelectronic
distances. However, due to the coupling present in the amplitude equations, all
decomposed correlation energy contributions show the same asymptotic
convergence behavior to the complete basis set limit. These findings provide an
additional rationale for the success of a recently proposed correction to the
basis set incompleteness error (BSIE) of coupled-cluster theory. Lastly, we
examine the BSIE in the coupled-cluster doubles plus perturbative triples
[CCD(T)] method, as well as in the newly proposed coupled-cluster doubles plus
complete perturbative triples [CCD(cT)] method.

<h3>Energy landscape of noncollinear exchange coupled magnetic multilayers</h3>

<br>
<i>George Lertzman-Lepofsky, Afan Terko, Sabri Koraltan, Dieter Suess, Erol Girt, Claas Abert</i>
<p>We conduct an exploration of the energy landscape of two coupled
ferromagnetic layers with perpendicular-to-plane uniaxial anisotropy using
finite-element micromagnetic simulations. These multilayers can be used to
produce noncollinearity in spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memory
cells, which has been shown to increase the performance of this class of
computer memory. We show that there exists a range of values of the interlayer
exchange coupling constants for which the magnetic state of these multilayers
can relax into two energy minima. The size of this region is determined by the
difference in the magnitude of the layer anisotropies and is minimized when
this difference is large. In this case, there is a wide range of experimentally
achievable coupling constants that can produce desirable and stable
noncollinear alignment. We investigate the energy barriers separating the local
and global minima using string method simulations, showing that the stabilities
of the minima increase with increasing difference in the anisotropy of the
ferromagnetic layers. We provide an analytical solution to the location of the
minima in the energy landscape of coupled macrospins, which has good agreement
with our micromagnetic results for a case involving ferromagnetic layers with
the same thickness and anisotropy, no demagnetization field, and large exchange
stiffness. These results are important to understand how best to employ
noncollinear coupling in the next generation of thin film magnetic devices.

<h3>Phase diagram of the one dimensional $t_1-t_2-J$ model: Ferromagnetism,  triplet pairing, charge and pair density waves</h3>

<i>Luhang Yang, Adrian E. Feiguin</i>
<p>We present a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) study of an extended
$t-J$ model with hopping to the first and second neighbors -- the one
dimensional $t_1-t_2-J$ model. The full phase diagram as a function of the
density $n$ and exchange strength $J$, for both positive and negative values of
$t_2$, is obtained. For $t_2=-0.5$ we observe that, in the strongly interacting
region, Nagaoka Ferromagnetism (FM) is accompanied by a triplet pair density
wave (PDW) upon doping. As the spin exchange $J$ increases, a charge density
wave (CDW) phase emerges and then gives way to singlet superconductivity (SC).
This phase behaves as a singlet PDW with vanishing spacial average of the order
parameter and a spin gap. When $t_2=0.5$, the physics is basically reminiscent
of the conventional $t-J$ model, undergoing a transition from a metallic to a
SC phase as a function of $J$.

<i>Zhaojun Li, Lorenzo Varrassi, Yali Yang, Cesare Franchini, Laurent Bellaiche, Jiangang He</i>
<p>Tuning the properties of materials using external stimuli is crucial for
developing versatile smart materials. A strong coupling among order parameters
within a single-phase material constitutes a potent foundation for achieving
precise property control. However, cross-coupling is pretty weak in most single
materials. Leveraging first principles calculations, we demonstrate the layered
mixed anion compound MoBr$_2$O$_2$ exhibits electric-field switchable
spontaneous polarization and ultrastrong coupling between polar distortion and
electronic structures as well as optical properties. It offers feasible avenues
of achieving tunable Rashba spin-splitting, electrochromism, thermochromism,
photochromism, and nonlinear optics by applying an external electric field to a
single domain sample, heating, as well as intense light illumination.
Additionally, it exhibits an exceptionally large photostrictive effect. These
findings not only showcase the feasibility of achieving multiple order
parameter coupling within a single material, but also pave the way for
comprehensive applications based on property control, such as energy
harvesting, information processing, and ultrafast control.

<h3>Probing Topology of Gaussian Mixed States by the Full Counting  Statistics</h3>

<br>
<i>Liang Mao, Hui Zhai, Fan Yang</i>
<p>Topological band theory has been studied for free fermions for decades, and
one of the most profound physical results is the bulk-boundary correspondence.
Recently a trend in topological physics is extending topological classification
to mixed state. Here, we focus on Gaussian mixed states where the modular
Hamiltonians of the density matrix are quadratic free fermion models and can be
classified by topological invariants. The bulk-boundary correspondence is then
manifested as stable gapless modes of the modular Hamiltonian and degenerate
spectrum of the density matrix. In this letter, we show that these gapless
modes can be detected by the full counting statistics, mathematically described
by a function introduced as F({\theta}). We show that a divergent derivative at
{\theta} = {\pi} probes the gapless modes in the modular Hamiltonian. We can
introduce a topological indicator whose quantization to unity senses
topologically nontrivial mixed states. We present the physical intuition of
these results and also demonstrate these results with concrete models in both
one- and two-dimensions. Our results pave the way for revealing the physical
significance of topology in mixed states.

<i>Zuxin Fu, Kuanrong Hao, Min Guo, Jingjing He, Xiaohong Yan, Yangbo Zhou, Lei Shen, Jiaren Yuan</i>
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) multiferroic materials with coexisting ferroelectricity
and ferromagnetism have garnered substantial attention for their intriguing
physical properties and diverse promising applications in spintronics. For
example, multiferroic materials with electronically controlled broken central
symmetry provide a versatile platform for designing and manipulating
topological skyrmions and diverse spintronic applications. Here, we investigate
the complex magnetic properties of room-temerature multiferroic material
MoPtGe2S6 and its electrical control of topological skyrmions using
first-principles calculations and atomistic micromagnetic simulations. A
sizable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) (2.1 meV) is found in the
multiferroic material MoPtGe2S6 with an electrically polarized ground state.
The magnetic skyrmions can be stabilized in monolayer MoPtGe2S6 under zero
magnetic field, and the chirality of skyrmions can be reversed with electric
field-induced flipping of electrical polarization due to the reversed chirality
of the DMI. Furthermore, an external magnetic fielc can reverse the
magnetization direction and topological charge of the skyrmions as well as tune
the size of skyrmions. These results demonstrate that the monolayer MoPtGe2S6
can enrich the 2D skyrmion community and pave the way for electronically
controlled spintronic devices.

<i>Yining Hu, Xu Wang, Chen Chen, Qingle Zhang, Dongming Zhao, Tianzhen Zhang, Chenxi Wang, Donglai Feng, Tong Zhang</i>
<p>Conventional magnetic domain walls are characterized by the reorientation of
local moments. However, what occurs at the boundary of itinerant magnets is
largely unknown. Here using spin-sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy, we
investigated the microscopic boundaries of spin-density-wave (SDW) state in a
prototypical itinerant anti-ferromagnet of Cr. We find at the boundary of two
incommensurate SDW domains, the spins display finite-scale decay rather than
reorientation. A novel double-Q SDW is generated with a second-order charge
modulation. In commensurate SDW domains, a clear SDW gap is observed. Screw
dislocations induced novel "half" vortex and anti-vortex that are connected by
antiphase domain wall. This domain wall is characterized by vanishing spin
density, where intriguing SDW in-gap states emerge, resembling the Andreev
bound states in superconductors. All these unique SDW boundary structures can
be viewed as consequences of local interference of two SDW, either with
different Q or reversed phases. Therefore, our study revealed a new category of
magnetic domain wall, the "interference wall", with a mechanism rooted in
itinerant nature.

<h3>Network analysis of memristive device circuits: dynamics, stability and  correlations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16015" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16015</a>

<i>Frank Barrows, Forrest C. Sheldon, Francesco Caravelli</i>
<p>Networks with memristive devices are a potential basis for the next
generation of computing devices. They are also an important model system for
basic science, from modeling nanoscale conductivity to providing insight into
the information-processing of neurons. The resistance in a memristive device
depends on the history of the applied bias and thus displays a type of memory.
The interplay of this memory with the dynamic properties of the network can
give rise to new behavior, offering many fascinating theoretical challenges.
But methods to analyze general memristive circuits are not well described in
the literature. In this paper we develop a general circuit analysis for
networks that combine memristive devices alongside resistors, capacitors and
inductors and under various types of control. We derive equations of motion for
the memory parameters of these circuits and describe the conditions for which a
network should display properties characteristic of a resonator system. For the
case of a purely memresistive network, we derive Lyapunov functions, which can
be used to study the stability of the network dynamics. Surprisingly, analysis
of the Lyapunov functions show that these circuits do not always have a stable
equilibrium in the case of nonlinear resistance and window functions. The
Lyapunov function allows us to study circuit invariances, wherein different
circuits give rise to similar equations of motion, which manifest through a
gauge freedom and node permutations. Finally, we identify the relation between
the graph Laplacian and the operators governing the dynamics of memristor
networks operators, and we use these tools to study the correlations between
distant memristive devices through the effective resistance.

<p>The intimate connection between magnetism and superconducting pairing
routinely plays a central role in determining the occurrence of unconventional
superconducting states. In high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) stripe-ordered
cuprate superconductors and a magnetically ordered iron-based superconductor,
the coupling between magnetism and superconductivity gives birth to novel
phases of matter with modulation of the superconducting pairing in the real
space. Further exploration of these phases can shed light on the mechanism of
unconventional superconductivity. Here we report on the discovery of a peculiar
spatially-varying superconducting state residing at the interface between
(110)-oriented KTaO3 and ferromagnetic EuO. Electrical transport measurements
reveal different Tc and upper critical fields (Hc2) with current applied along
the two orthogonal in-plane directions. Such anisotropy persistently occurs in
the low-carrier-density samples that are characterized by strong coupling
between Ta 5d and Eu 4f electrons, whereas in the high-carrier-density samples
the coupling is weakened and Tc and Hc2 becomes isotropic. Complemented by
local imaging of diamagnetism and theoretical analysis, our observations imply
an unprecedented emergence of superconducting stripes wherein the phase
coherence is established ahead of the rest of the interface, arising from a
band-filling-dependent ferromagnetic proximity. The realization of such exotic
superconducting states provides impetus for the study of novel physics in
heterostructures possessing both magnetism and superconductivity.

<i>Tamali Mukherjee, V Satya Narayana Murthy</i>
<p>Skyrmions, which are topologically stable magnetic structures, have
manifested promising features to be used as an information carrier in new-age,
non-volatile data storage devices. In this article, we show how the creation
and stability of skyrmion can be manipulated by external stimuli (here,
nano-second current pulse). Co/Pt square nano-structure with Co free layer
thickness in the range 1 nm to 5 nm and first and second-order anisotropy
constants are taken to study the controlled creation of skyrmions. The
magnetization dynamics controlled by the current-induced spin transfer torque
help to nucleate skyrmions by transformation from perpendicularly magnetized
ground state to a stable state of isolated skyrmions via complex transformation
of Neel wall following its image inversion. Compared with the first-order
anisotropy alone, how the higher-order anisotropy constants (up to second
order) impact the relaxed state of a system has been discussed.

<h3>$Q$-voter model with independence on signed random graphs: approximate  master equations</h3>

<br>
<i>Andrzej Krawiecki, Tomasz Gradowski</i>
<p>Approximate master equations are derived for the two-state $q$-voter model
with independence on signed random graphs, with negative and positive weights
of links corresponding to antagonistic and reinforcing interactions,
respectively. Depending on the mean degree of nodes, the size of the
$q$-neighborhood, and the fraction of the antagonistic links, with decreasing
independence of agents, this model shows a first- or second-order
ferromagnetic-like transition to an ordered state with one dominant opinion.
Predictions of the approximate master equations concerning this transition
exhibit quantitative agreement with results of Monte Carlo simulations in the
whole range of parameters of the model, even if predictions of the widely used
pair and mean field approximations are inaccurate. Heterogeneous pair
approximation derived from the approximate master equations yields results
indistinguishable from homogeneous pair approximation studied before and fails
in the case of the model on networks with a small and comparable mean degree of
nodes and size of the $q$-neighborhood.

<i>Yuta Nozaki, Tamás Kálmán, Masakazu Teragaito, Yuya Koda</i>
<p>We give a homotopy classification of the global defects in ordered media, and
explain it via the example of biaxial nematic liquid crystals, i.e., systems
where the order parameter space is the quotient of the $3$-sphere $S^3$ by the
quaternion group $Q$. As our mathematical model we consider continuous maps
from complements of spatial graphs to the space $S^3/Q$ modulo a certain
equivalence relation, and find that the equivalence classes are enumerated by
the six subgroups of $Q$. Through monodromy around meridional loops, the edges
of our spatial graphs are marked by conjugacy classes of $Q$; once we pass to
planar diagrams, these labels can be refined to elements of $Q$ associated to
each arc. The same classification scheme applies not only in the case of $Q$
but also to arbitrary groups.

<i>Ding-Bang Zhou, Kuang-Hong Gao, Meng-Fan Zhao, Zhi-Yan Jia, Xiao-Xia Hu, Qian-Jin Guo, Hai-Yan Du, Xiao-Ping Chen, Zhi-Qing Li</i>
<p>Layered transition metal chalcogenides have stimulated a wide research
interest due to its many exotic physical properties. In this paper, we studied
the magnetotransport properties of the exfoliated TaNiTe5, a recently
discovered Dirac nodal-line semimetal. A giant positive magnetoresistance (MR)
is observed when the current is parallel to the crystallographic c axis, while
it is strongly diminished when the current flows along the a axis. The observed
giant MR is gradually suppressed either on reducing the thickness of nanoflake
or on increasing temperature. By performing MR measurement in tilted magnetic
fields, the interlayer coupling is found to be weakened both by reducing the
thickness and by increasing temperature. We propose a mechanism of
electron-electron interaction-assisted interlayer transport as a origin of the
giant MR. The mechanism is likely to provide a explanation for the giant MR in
other layered materials.

<p>Tunable quantum materials hold great potential for applications. Of special
interest are materials in which small lattice strain induces giant electronic
responses. The kagome compounds AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) provide a testbed for
such singular electronic states. In this study, through angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, we provide comprehensive spectroscopic measurements
of the giant responses induced by compressive and tensile strains on the
charge-density-wave (CDW) order parameter and high-order van Hove singularity
(HO-VHS) in CsV3Sb5. We observe a tripling of the CDW gap magnitudes with ~1%
strain, accompanied by the changes of both energy and mass of the saddle-point
fermions. Our results reveal an anticorrelation between the unconventional CDW
order parameter and the mass of a HO-VHS, and highlight the role of the latter
in the superconducting pairing. The giant electronic responses uncover a rich
strain tunability of the versatile kagome system in studying quantum interplays
under lattice perturbations.

<p>Intrinsic Rashba spin-orbital coupling (SOC) can exist in centrosymmetric
materials with local inversion symmetry breaking. Here we show that such a SOC
can induce topological superconductivity together with an in-plane Zeeman field
in planar Josephson junctions formed by the centrosymmetric materials. A single
Majorana mode can be created at each end of the junction. We demonstrate this
result in a model based on iron-based superconductors. We derive the necessary
Fermi surface condition for the topological planar junction and calculate the
topological phase diagram with respect to the in-plane Zeeman field and the
phase difference between the two superconductors. We provide experimental
characteristics for the topological superconductivity, including the
differential conductance and the Fano factor tomography which can be measured
in the scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Our study reveals that the
centrosymmetric systems with local-inversion-symmetry breaking can serve as new
platforms for the topological planar Josephson junctions, and help to find more
experimentally feasible materials for the topological superconductors.

<h3>Displaced Drude peak from $π$-ton vertex corrections</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16104" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16104</a>
<br>
<i>J. Krsnik, O. Simard, P. Werner, A. Kauch, K. Held</i>
<p>Correlated electron systems often show strong bosonic fluctuations, e.g., of
antiferromagnetic nature, around a large wave vector such as
$\mathbf{q}=(\pi,\pi\ldots)$. These fluctuations can give rise to vertex
corrections to the optical conductivity through the (transversal) particle-hole
channel, coined $\pi$-ton contributions. Previous numerical results differed
qualitatively on how such vertex corrections alter the optical conductivity.
Here, we clarify that $\pi$-ton vertex corrections lead to a displaced Drude
peak for correlated metals. The proximity and enhancement of the effect when
approaching a phase transition of, e.g., antiferromagnetic nature can be
utilized for discriminating $\pi$-tons in experiments from other physics
leading to a displaced Drude peak.

<i>Omri Y. Cohen, Yael Klein, Eran Sharon</i>
<p>The locomotion of flexible membrane-like organisms on top of curved surfaces
appears in different contexts and scales. Still, such dynamics have not yet
been quantitatively modeled and no realization of such motion in manmade
systems has been achieved. We present an experimental and theoretical study of
active gel ribbons surfing on a curved fluid-fluid interface via periodic
modulation of their reference curvature. We derive a theoretical model, in
which forces and torques emerge from curvature mismatch between the ribbon and
the substrate. Analytic and numerical solutions of the equations of motion
successfully predict the experimentally measured velocity profiles. We conclude
by highlighting the relevance of this new, curvature-driven, mode of locomotion
for a broad range of mechanical, as well as biological systems.

<h3>General Shiba mapping for on-site four-point correlation functions</h3>

<br>
<i>Herbert Eßl, Matthias Reitner, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Alessandro Toschi</i>
<p>By applying the Shiba mapping on the two particle level, we derive the
relation between the local four-point correlation functions of bipartite
lattice models with on-site electronic repulsion and those of the corresponding
models with attractive interaction in the most general setting. In particular,
we extend the results of [Phys. Rev. B, 101, 155148 (2020)], which were limited
to the rather specific situation of the static limit in strictly particle-hole
symmetric models, (i) by explicitly including both magnetic field and different
values of the chemical potentials, and (ii) by considering the full dependence
of the generalized susceptibilities on the transfer (bosonic) Matsubara
frequency. The derived formalism is then applied, as a relevant benchmark, to
the Hubbard atom, by investigating the general properties of the divergences of
its irreducible vertex functions as a function of chemical potential and
applied magnetic field. The resulting phase-diagrams provide an insightful
compass for future studies of the breakdown of the self-consistent perturbation
expansion beyond high-symmetric regimes.

<h3>Liquid-liquid transition in a Bose fluid near collapse</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16125" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16125</a>
<br>
<i>Saverio Moroni, Fabio Cinti, Massimo Boninsegni, Giuseppe Pellicane, Santi Prestipino</i>
<p>Discovering novel emergent behavior in quantum many-body systems is a main
objective of contemporary research. In this paper, we explore the effects on
phases and phase transitions of the proximity to a Ruelle instability. To
accomplish this, we study by quantum Monte Carlo simulations a two-dimensional
system of finite-ranged attractive potential with soft-core repulsion at short
distances, with a parameter $\eta$ describing the relative strength of the
attractive versus the repulsive part. If $\eta$ exceeds a characteristic value
$\eta_c$, the thermodynamic limit is lost, as the system becomes unstable
against collapse. We investigate the phase diagram of the model for $\eta
\lesssim \eta_c$, finding -- in addition to a liquid-vapor transition -- a
first-order transition between two liquid phases. Upon cooling, the
high-density liquid turns superfluid, possibly above the vapor-liquid-liquid
triple temperature. As $\eta$ approaches $\eta_c$, the stability region of the
high-density liquid is shifted to increasingly higher densities, a behavior at
variance with distinguishable quantum or classical particles. Finally, for
$\eta$ larger than $\eta_c$ our simulations yield evidence of collapse of the
low-temperature fluid for any density; the collapsed system forms a circular
cluster whose radius is insensitive to the number of particles.

<h3>3D active nematic disclinations behave as Majorana quasiparticles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16149" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16149</a>

<i>Louise C. Head, Giuseppe Negro, Livio N. Carenza, Ryan R. Keogh, Giuseppe Gonnella, Alexander Morozov, Enzo Orlandini, Tyler N. Shendruk, Adriano Tiribocchi, Davide Marenduzzo</i>
<p>Quasiparticles are low-energy excitations with important roles in condensed
matter physics. An intriguing example is provided by Majorana fermions,
quasiparticles which are identical to their antiparticles. Despite being
implicated in neutrino oscillations and topological superconductivity, their
experimental realisations remain scarce. Here we propose a purely classical
realisation of Majorana fermions, in terms of 3-dimensional disclination lines
in active nematics. Activity is required to overcome the elastic cost
associated with these excitations, so they can appear in steady state. We
combine topology and simulations to show that active nematics under confinement
spontaneously create in their interior topologically charged disclination lines
and loops, akin to Majorana quasiparticles with finite momentum. Within an
elongated channel, we find a phenomenology similar to that of the Kitaev chain,
as local Majorana-like excitations appear near surfaces, while a non-local
system-spanning helical disclination line can arise along the centre. In
unconfined active turbulence, Majorana-like charged loops are instead
exceedingly rare, suggesting that boundaries are crucial to generate these
quasiparticles, as in quantum condensed matter. We suggest that 3-dimensional
active disclinations can be used to probe the physics of Majorana spinors at a
much larger scale than traditionally considered, potentially facilitating the
experimental observation of their dynamics.

<h3>Experimental identification of force, velocity, and nematic order  relationships in active nematic cell monolayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16151" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16151</a>
<br>
<i>Masahito Uwamichi, He Li, Zihui Zhao, Yisong Yao, Hideo Higuchi, Kyogo Kawaguchi, Masaki Sano</i>
<p>Cell alignment often forms nematic order, which can lead to anomalous
collective cell flow due to the so-called active force. Although it is
appreciated that cell migration is driven by traction force, a quantitative
evaluation of the relationships between the traction force, the nematic
patterning, and the cell flow velocity is still elusive. Here we have found
that cellular traction force aligns almost perfectly and is proportional in
amplitude to the gradient of the nematic order tensor, not only near the
topological defects but also globally. Furthermore, the flow in the monolayer
was best described by adding nonlinear forces and a diffusion term derived from
symmetry considerations. These nonlinear active forces enhance density
instability but suppress bending instability, explaining why cell accumulation
and dispersion can occur in neural progenitor cell culture while their ordering
pattern is stable.

<p>Integration of 2D semiconductors with photonic crystal slabs provides an
attractive approach to achieve strong light--matter coupling and
exciton-polariton formation in a planar chip-compatible geometry. However, for
the development of practical devices, it is crucial that the polariton
excitations in the structure are easily tunable and exhibit strong nonlinear
response. Here we study neutral and charged exciton-polaritons in an
electrostatically gated planar photonic crystal slab with an embedded monolayer
semiconductor MoSe$_2$ and experimentally demonstrate strong polariton
nonlinearity, which can be tuned via gate voltage. We find that modulation of
dielectric environment within the photonic crystal results in the formation of
two distinct resonances with significantly different nonlinear response, which
enables optical switching with ultrashort laser pulses. Our results open new
avenues towards development of active polaritonic devices in a compact
chip-compatible implementation.

<h3>High-resolution numerical-experimental comparison of heterogeneous slip  activity in quasi-2D ferrite sheets</h3>

<p>The role of heterogeneity in the plastic flow of thin ferrite specimens is
investigated in this study. This is done through a recently introduced quasi-2D
experimental-numerical framework that allows for a quantitative comparison of
the deformation fields of metal microstructures between experiments and
simulations at a high level of detail and complexity. The method exploits
samples that are locally ultra-thin ("2D") and hence have a practically uniform
microstructure through their thickness. This allows testing more complex
loading conditions compared to uniaxial micromechanical experiments while
avoiding the complexity of an unknown subsurface microstructure, which limits
comparisons between experiments and simulations in traditional integrated
approaches at the level of the polycrystalline microstructure. The present
approach enables to study the effect of microstructural features such as grain
boundaries. To study the role of stochastic fluctuations, a constitutive model
is employed which introduces random heterogeneity into a crystal plasticity
model. A detailed analysis of the simulations is performed at the level of
individual slip systems. Since both experimental and numerical results are
susceptible to stochastic fluctuations, the outcomes of many simulations are
compared to the experimentally obtained result. This comparison allows us to
determine how a single experiment relates to an ensemble of simulations.
Additionally, results obtained with a conventional crystal plasticity model are
considered. The analysis reveals that the heterogeneity in the plasticity model
is essential for accurately capturing the deformation mechanisms.

<h3>Effective Phonon Dispersion and Low field transport in AlxGa1-xN alloys  using supercells: An ab-initio approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16203" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16203</a>
<br>
<i>Animesh Datta, Ankit Sharma, Matinehsadat Hosseinigheidari, Uttam Singisetti</i>
<p>To investigate the transport properties in random alloys, it is important to
model the alloy disorder using supercells. Though traditional methods like
Virtual Crystal Approximation (VCA) are computationally efficient, the local
disorder in the system is not accurately captured as artificial translational
symmetry is imposed on the system. However, in the case of supercells, the
error introduced by self-image interaction between the impurities is reduced
and translational symmetry is explicitly imposed over larger length scales. In
this work, we have investigated the Effective Phonon Dispersion (EPD) and
transport properties, from first principle calculations using supercells in
AlxGa1-xN alloy systems. Using our in-house developed code, the EPD of AlGaN is
obtained and the individual modes are identified. Next, we discuss our in-house
developed method to calculate low-field transport properties in supercells.
First to validate our methods we have solved the Boltzmann Transport Equation
using Rode method to compare the phonon limited mobility in the 4 atom GaN
primitive cell and 12 atom GaN supercell. Using the same technique, we have
investigated the low field transport in random AlxGa1-xN alloy systems. Our
calculations show that along with alloy scattering, electron-phonon scattering
may also play an important role at room temperature and high-temperature device
operation. This technique opens up the path for calculating phonon-limited
transport properties in random alloy systems.

<h3>Charge orders with distinct magnetic response in a prototypical kagome  superconductor LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$</h3>

<p>The kagome lattice has emerged as a promising platform for hosting
unconventional chiral charge order at high temperatures. Notably, in
LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$, a room-temperature charge-ordered state with a propagation
vector of ($\frac{1}{4}$,~0,~0) has been recently identified. However,
understanding the interplay between this charge order and superconductivity,
particularly with respect to time-reversal-symmetry breaking, remains elusive.
In this study, we employ single crystal X-ray diffraction, magnetotransport,
and muon-spin rotation experiments to investigate the charge order and its
electronic and magnetic responses in LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$ across a wide
temperature range down to the superconducting state. Our findings reveal the
emergence of a charge order with a propagation vector of ($\frac{1}{6}$,~0,~0)
below $T_{\rm CO,2}$ ${\simeq}$ 80 K, coexisting with the previously identified
room-temperature primary charge order ($\frac{1}{4}$,~0,~0). The primary
charge-ordered state exhibits zero magnetoresistance. In contrast, the
appearance of the secondary charge order at $T_{\rm CO,2}$ is accompanied by a
notable magnetoresistance response and a pronounced temperature-dependent Hall
effect, which experiences a sign reversal, switching from positive to negative
below $T^{*}$ ${\simeq}$ 35 K. Intriguingly, we observe an enhancement in the
internal field width sensed by the muon ensemble below $T^{*}$ ${\simeq}$ 35 K.
Moreover, the muon spin relaxation rate exhibits a substantial increase upon
the application of an external magnetic field below $T_{\rm CO,2}$ ${\simeq}$
80 K. Our results highlight the coexistence of two distinct types of charge
order in LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$ within the correlated kagome lattice, namely a
non-magnetic charge order ($\frac{1}{4}$,~0,~0) below $T_{\rm co,1}$ ${\simeq}$
400 K and a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking charge order below $T_{\rm CO,2}$.

<h3>Entropic Cohesion in Vitrimers</h3>

<br>
<i>Rahul Karmakar, Himanshu, Srikanth Sastry, Sanat K Kumar, Tarak K Patra</i>
<p>Vitrimers are polymer networks that can undergo bond exchange reactions. They
dynamically rearrange their structures while maintaining their overall
integrity, thus resulting in unique properties such as self-healing,
reprocessability, shape memory and adaptability. Here, we show that the
introduction of dynamic bonds directly impacts the polymer density. For a
limiting case, where the dynamic bonds are the same size as the polymer chain
bonds, simulations and theory show an enhancement in the density, because these
bonds induce an increased cohesive force in the liquid, which is entropic in
origin. The crosslinks are well mixed in the bulk but are depleted from the air
and polymer interface. These findings implicate density as a key variable in
polymers with dynamic crosslinkers, one that can be used to facilely tune their
properties.

<p>We consider the macroscopic dynamics of systems with charge and spin
currents, using the methods of Onsager's irreversible thermodynamics. Applied
to systems with spin-orbit interaction (SOI), we derive Onsager relations
showing that, if electrical disequilibrium leads to spin currents, then
magnetic disequilibrium leads to charge currents. We consider three examples of
such SOI. Two of these predicted charge currents have not previously appeared.
By measuring these charge currents one can infer the corresponding spin
currents.

<br>
<i>Liheng Lang, Qichen Lu, C. M. Dai, Xingbo Wei, Yanxia Liu, Yunbo Zhang</i>
<p>The study of integrable systems has led to significant advancements in our
understanding of many-body physics. We design a series of numerical experiments
to analyze the integrability of a mass-imbalanced two-body system through
energy level statistics and deep learning of wavefunctions. The level spacing
distributions are fitted by a Brody distribution and the fitting parameter
$\omega$ is found to separate the integrable and non-integrable mass ratios by
a critical line $\omega=0$. The convolutional neural network built from the
probability density images could identify the transition points between
integrable and non-integrable systems with high accuracy, yet in a much shorter
computation time. A brilliant example of the network's ability is to identify a
new integrable mass ratio $1/3$ by learning from the known integrable case of
equal mass, with a remarkable network confidence of $98.78\%$. The robustness
of our neural networks is further enhanced by adversarial learning, where
samples are generated by standard and quantum perturbations mixed in the
probability density images and the wavefunctions, respectively.

<br>
<i>Kantaro Honda, Yosuke Takasu, Yuki Haruna, Yusuke Nishida, Yoshiro Takahashi</i>
<p>A two-body interaction or force between quantum particles is ubiquitous in
nature, and the microscopic description in terms of the bare two-body
interaction is the basis for quantitatively describing interacting few- and
many-body systems. Alternatively, the effective description in terms of an
effective two-body interaction successfully captures the essence of the
systems. However, for several important observations, the explanation in terms
of an effective two-body interaction is not satisfactory, and the effective
three-body interaction has played an essential role in understanding the
systems. In this study, we investigate a few-body system comprising of
ultracold bosons tightly confined in a deep optical lattice site, which is
effectively described as zero-dimensional bosons. By combining an
occupancy-resolving high-resolution laser spectroscopy with an inter-orbital
Feshbach resonance controlling the bare two-body interaction over a wide range,
we obtain a clear evidence of an effective four-body force, which has never
been observed in any few-body quantum system so far. This will open the door
for the study of multi-body forces in various few-body systems.

<h3>A novel method for determining the resistivity of compressed  superconducting materials</h3>

<br>
<i>Liling Sun, Qi Wu, Shu Cai, Yang Ding, Ho-kwang Mao</i>
<p>The resistivity of a superconductor in its normal state plays a critical role
in determining its superconducting ground state. However, measuring the
resistivity of a material under high pressure has long presented a significant
technical challenge due to pressure-induced changes in the crystallographic
directions, especially for samples with anisotropic layered structures like
high-Tc superconductors and other intriguing quantum materials. Here, we are
the first to propose a novel and effective method for determining high-pressure
resistivity, which relies on the ambient-pressure resistivity, initial sample
sizes, lattice parameters, high-pressure resistance, and lattice parameters
measured from the same sample. Its validity has been confirmed through our
investigations of pressurized copper-oxide superconductors, which demonstrates
that this method provides new possibilities for researchers conducting
high-pressure studies related to resistivity of these materials.

<p>The normal-conducting state of the superconductor UTe$_2$ is studied by
entropy analysis for magnetic fields along the $b$-axis, obtained from
magnetization using the relation $(\partial M/\partial T)_B=(\partial
S/\partial B)_T$. We observe a strong increase in entropy with magnetic field
due to metamagnetic fluctuations (spatially uniform, $Q=0$). The field
dependence is well described by the Hertz-Millis-Moriya theory for quantum
criticality of itinerant metamagnetism. Notably, the lower bound of the
quantum-critical region coincides well with the position of the minimum in the
superconducting transition temperature $T_c(B)$. Hence, our results suggest
that $Q=0$ fluctuations reinforce the superconductivity.

<p>The significance of the superconducting diode effect lies in its potential
application as a fundamental component in the development of next-generation
superconducting circuit technology. The stringent operating conditions at low
temperatures have posed challenges for the conventional semiconductor diode,
primarily due to its exceptionally high resistivity. In response to this
limitation, various approaches have emerged to achieve the superconducting
diode effect, primarily involving the disruption of inversion symmetry in a
two-dimensional superconductor through heterostructure fabrication. In this
study, we present a direct observation of the supercurrent diode effect in a
NbSe2 nanobridge with a length of approximately 15 nm, created using focused
helium ion beam fabrication. Nonreciprocal supercurrents were identified,
reaching a peak value of approximately 380 $\mu$A for each bias polarity at
$B_{z}^{max} =\pm 0.2$ mT. Notably, the nonreciprocal supercurrent can be
toggled by altering the bias polarity. This discovery of the superconducting
diode effect introduces a novel avenue and mechanism through nanofabrication on
a superconducting flake, offering fresh perspectives for the development of
superconducting devices and potential circuits.

<h3>Topological transitions by magnetization rotation in kagome monolayers  of ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co-based shandite</h3>

<br>
<i>Kazuki Nakazawa, Yasuyuki Kato, Yukitoshi Motome</i>
<p>Co-based shandite Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ is a ferromagnet hosting Weyl fermions in
the layered Co kagome structure. The band topology as well as the magnetism is
predicted to vary drastically in the atomically thin films depending on the
thickness and surface termination, and as an extreme case, the quantum
anomalous Hall state is expected in a monolayer of the Co kagome lattice. Given
that the bulk Weyl gap depends on the magnetization direction, here we
theoretically study how the topological nature and transport properties vary
with the magnetization direction in the systems with kagome monolayer with both
Sn and S surface terminations. By using $ab \ initio$ calculations, we find
that in the Sn-end monolayer the anomalous Hall conductivity shows successive
discrete changes between different quantized values by rotating the
magnetization, indicating several topological transitions between the anomalous
quantum Hall insulators with different Chern numbers. Notably, when the
magnetization is oriented in-plane and perpendicular to the Co-Co bond, the
system exhibits a planar quantized anomalous Hall effect. We clarify that these
peculiar behaviors are due to topological changes in the band structures
associated with gap closing of the Weyl nodes. In contrast, the S-end monolayer
shows rather continuous changes in the transport properties since the system is
metallic, although the band structure contains many Weyl nodes. Our results
pave the way for controlling Weyl fermions in atomically thin films of Co-based
shandite, where the topological nature associated with the Weyl nodes appears
more clearly than the bulk.

<i>Sahand Tabatabaei, Pritam Priyadarsi, Namanish Singh, Pardis Sahafi, Daniel Tay, Andrew Jordan, Raffi Budakian</i>
<p>Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) has revolutionized the field of NMR
spectroscopy, expanding its reach and capabilities to investigate diverse
materials, biomolecules, and complex dynamic processes. Bringing
high-efficiency DNP to the nanometer scale would open new avenues for studying
nanoscale nuclear spin ensembles, such as single biomolecules, virus particles,
and condensed matter systems. Combining pulsed DNP with nanoscale
force-detected magnetic resonance measurements, we demonstrated a 100-fold
enhancement in the Boltzmann polarization of proton spins in nanoscale sugar
droplets at 6 K and 0.33 T. Crucially, this enhancement corresponds to a factor
of 200 reduction in the averaging time compared to measurements that rely on
the detection of statistical fluctuations in nanoscale nuclear spin ensembles.
These results significantly advance the capabilities of force-detected magnetic
resonance detection as a practical tool for nanoscale imaging.

<h3>Oscillatory Hall effect from magnetoelectronic coupling in  flexoelectronic silicon</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16330" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16330</a>
<br>
<i>Paul C. Lou, Ravindra G. Bhardwaj, Anand Katailiha, W.P. Beyermann, Sandeep Kumar</i>
<p>The magnetoelectronic coupling can be defined as cross-domain coupling
between electronic and magnetic properties, where modulation in magnetic
properties changes the electronic properties. In this letter, an explicit
experimental evidence of magnetoelectronic coupling is presented, which is
uncovered from oscillatory Hall effect response in Hall measurement. The strain
gradient in a MgO (1.8 nm)/p-Si (~400 nm) freestanding sample leads to transfer
of electrons (~5X10^18 cm^-3) from valence to conduction band due to
flexoelectronic charge separation in the p-Si layer. The resulting
flexoelectronic polarization gives rise to temporal magnetic moment from
dynamical multiferroicity. The external magnetic field changes the net temporal
magnetic moment, which causes modulations in charge carrier concentration and
oscillatory Hall effect. The period of oscillatory Hall response is 1.12 T,
which is attributed to the magnitude of temporal magnetic moment. The discovery
of oscillatory Hall effect adds a new member to the family of Hall effects.

<i>Hiroto Saito, Takashi Koretsune</i>
<p>Magnetocrystalline anisotropy, a crucial factor in magnetic properties and
applications like magnetoresistive random-access memory, often requires
extensive $k$-point mesh in first-principles calculations. In this study, we
develop a Wannier orbital tight-binding model incorporating crystal and spin
symmetries and utilize time-reversal symmetry to divide magnetization
components. This model enables efficient computation of magnetocrystalline
anisotropy. Applying this method to $\mathrm{L1_0}$ $\mathrm{FePt}$ and
$\mathrm{FeNi}$, we calculate the dependence of the anisotropic energy on
$k$-point mesh size, chemical potential, spin-orbit interaction, and
magnetization direction. The results validate the practicality of the models to
the energy order of $10~[\mathrm{\mu eV}/f.u.]$.

<p>A novel high-fan-in differential superconductor neuron structure designed for
ultra-high-performance Spiking Neural Network (SNN) accelerators is presented.
Utilizing a high-fan-in neuron structure allows us to design SNN accelerators
with more synaptic connections, enhancing the overall network capabilities. The
proposed neuron design is based on superconductor electronics fabric,
incorporating multiple superconducting loops, each with two Josephson
Junctions. This arrangement enables each input data branch to have positive and
negative inductive coupling, supporting excitatory and inhibitory synaptic
data. Compatibility with synaptic devices and thresholding operation is
achieved using a single flux quantum (SFQ) pulse-based logic style. The neuron
design, along with ternary synaptic connections, forms the foundation for a
superconductor-based SNN inference. To demonstrate the capabilities of our
design, we train the SNN using snnTorch, augmenting the PyTorch framework.
After pruning, the demonstrated SNN inference achieves an impressive 96.1%
accuracy on MNIST images. Notably, the network exhibits a remarkable throughput
of 8.92 GHz while consuming only 1.5 nJ per inference, including the energy
consumption associated with cooling to 4K. These results underscore the
potential of superconductor electronics in developing high-performance and
ultra-energy-efficient neural network accelerator architectures.

<h3>Entropy production for diffusion processes across a semipermeable  interface</h3>

<br>
<i>Paul C Bressloff</i>
<p>The emerging field of stochastic thermodynamics extends classical ideas of
entropy, heat and work to non-equilibrium systems. One notable finding is that
the second law of thermodynamics typically only holds after taking appropriate
averages with respect to an ensemble of stochastic trajectories. The resulting
average rate of entropy production then quantifies the degree of departure from
thermodynamic equilibrium. In this paper we investigate how the presence of a
semipermeable interface increases the average entropy production of a single
diffusing particle. Starting from the Gibbs-Shannon entropy for the particle
probability density, we show that a semipermeable interface or membrane $\calS$
increases the average rate of entropy production by an amount that is equal to
the product of the flux through the interface and the logarithm of the ratio of
the probability density on either side of the interface, integrated along
$\calS$. The entropy production rate thus vanishes at thermodynamic
equilibrium, but can be nonzero during the relaxation to equilibrium, or if
there exists a nonzero stationary equilibrium state (NESS). We illustrate the
latter using the example of diffusion with stochastic resetting on a circle,
and show that the average rate of interfacial entropy production is a
nonmonotonic function of the resetting rate and the permeability. Finally, we
give a probabilistic interpretation of the interfacial entropy production rate
using so-called snapping out Brownian motion. This also allows us to construct
a stochastic version of entropy production.

<h3>Exploring spatial dispersion in helical wired media: An effective field  theory approach</h3>

<br>
<i>P.O. Kazinski, P.S. Korolev</i>
<p>The propagation of electromagnetic waves in helical media with spatial
dispersion is investigated. The general form of the permittivity tensor with
spatial dispersion obeying the helical symmetry is derived. Its particular form
describing the medium made of conducting spiral wires with pitch $2\pi/|q|$ is
studied in detail. The solution of the corresponding Maxwell equations is
obtained in the paraxial limit. The dispersion law of the electromagnetic field
modes, their polarization, and the integral curves of the Poynting vector are
analyzed. The dispersion law of photons in such a medium possesses polarization
dependent forbidden bands. The widths of these gaps and their positions are
tunable in a wide range of energies. If the helix angle $\alpha$ is not close
to $\pi/2$ and the plasma frequency $\omega_p\ll|q|$, then there are two chiral
forbidden bands. The energies of one chiral forbidden band are near the plasma
frequency $\omega_p$ and the width of this gap is of order $|q|$. The other
chiral forbidden band is narrow and is located near the photon energy $|q|$. In
the case $\alpha\approx\pi/2$, the first chiral forbidden band becomes a total
forbidden band. If, additionally, the plasma frequency $\omega_p\gg|q|$, then
the second forbidden band turns into a wide polarization dependent forbidden
band. For the energies belonging to this interval the photons with only one
linear polarization are transmitted through the medium and the polarization
plane of transmitted photons is rotated. In the nonparaxial regime, the
solution of the Maxwell equations is obtained in the shortwave approximation.
The dispersion law of the electromagnetic field modes, their polarization, and
the integral curves of the Poynting vector are found. Scattering of the
electromagnetic waves by a slab made of the helical wired medium is considered.

<h3>Direct excitation of Kelvin waves on quantized vortices</h3>

<p>Helices and spirals, prevalent across various systems, play a crucial role in
characterizing symmetry, describing dynamics, and imparting unique
functionalities, attributed to their inherent simplicity and chiral nature. A
helical excitation on a quantized vortex, an example of a one-dimensional
topological defect, emerges as a Nambu-Goldstone mode following spontaneous
symmetry breaking, known as a Kelvin wave. Kelvin waves play a vital role in
energy dissipation within inviscid quantum fluids. However, deliberately
exciting Kelvin waves has proven to be challenging. Here, we introduce a
controlled method for exciting Kelvin waves on a quantized vortex in superfluid
helium-4. We used a charged nanoparticle, oscillated by a time-varying electric
field, to stimulate Kelvin waves on the vortex. A major breakthrough in our
research is the confirmation of the helical nature of Kelvin waves through
three-dimensional image reconstruction, providing visual evidence of their
complex dynamics. Additionally, we determined the dispersion relation and the
phase velocity of the Kelvin wave and identified the vorticity direction,
enhancing our understanding of quantum fluid behavior. This work elucidates the
dynamics of Kelvin waves and pioneers a novel approach for manipulating and
observing quantized vortices in three dimensions, thereby opening new avenues
for exploring quantum fluidic systems.

<h3>Electronic phase transitions and superconductivity in ferroelectric  Sn$_2$P$_2$Se$_6$ under pressure</h3>

<br>
<i>He Zhang, Wei Zhong, Xiaohui Yu, Binbin Yue, Fang Hong</i>
<p>Since there is both strong electron-phonon coupling during a ferroelectric/FE
transition and superconducting/SC transition, it has been an important topic to
explore superconductivity from the FE instability. Sn$_2$P$_2$Se$_6$ arouses
broad attention due to its unique FE properties. Here, we reported the
electronic phase transitions and superconductivity in this compound based on
high-pressure electrical transport measurement, optical absorption spectroscopy
and Raman based structural analysis. Upon compression, the conductivity of
Sn$_2$P$_2$Se$_6$ was elevated monotonously, an electronic phase transition
occurred near 5.4 GPa, revealed by optical absorption spectroscopy, and the
insulating state is estimated to be fully suppressed near 15 GPa. Then, it
started to show the signature of superconductivity near 15.3 GPa. The
zero-resistance state was presented from 19.4 GPa, and the superconductivity
was enhanced with pressure continuously. The magnetic field effect further
confirmed the SC behavior and this compound had a $T_c$ of 5.4 K at 41.8 GPa
with a zero temperature upper critical field of 6.55 T. The Raman spectra
confirmed the structural origin of the electronic transition near 5.4 GPa,
which should due to the transition from the paraelectric phase to the
incommensurate phase, and suggested a possible first-order phase transition
when the sample underwent the semiconductor-metal transition near 15 GPa. This
work demonstrates the versatile physical properties in ferroelectrics and
inspires the further investigation on the correlation between FE instability
and SC in M$_2$P$_2$X$_6$ family.

<h3>The Map between Symmetries and Orbital Rules to Realize Tunable Band Gap  in Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect Material</h3>

<br>
<i>Jiaohong Shu, Xinxin Zhao, Weiqin Fan, Lili Wang, Guanglong Chen, Jianbao Wu, Yiming Mi</i>
<p>We establish the map between symmetries and orbital rules to realize tunable
band gap in quantum anomalous Hall effect material. This band gap is determined
by the SOC between local orbitals associated with band crossing, which is
constrained by at least one of lattice symmetries. The band gap could be turned
on/off by breaking or keeping corresponding lattice symmetry through rotation
of magnetization direction. The components of local orbital related to band
crossing is required to match the symmetry, and to produce non-zero SOC when
symmetry is broken. Following this map, the TiSb monolayer is predicted to be a
quantum anomalous Hall effect material with a band gap adjusted in the range of
0 to 209 meV through magnetization direction rotation.

<br>
<i>Shakul Awasthi, Sreedhar B. Dutta</i>
<p>Periodically driven thermodynamic systems support stable non-equilibrium
oscillating states with properties drastically different from equilibrium. They
exhibit even more exotic features for low viscous drives, which is a regime
that is hard to probe due to singular behavior of the underlying Langevin
dynamics near vanishing viscosity. We propose a method, based on singular
perturbation and Floquet theories, that allows us to obtain oscillating states
in this limit. We then find two distinct classes of distributions, each
exhibiting interesting features that can be exploited for a range of practical
applicability, including cooling a system and triggering chemical reactions
through weakly interacting driven environments.

<p>The crystal structure of KAgF3 was studied by powder neutron diffraction.
KAgF3 exhibits at all temperatures an orthorhombic symmetry in space group Pnma
that allows for several distortions with respect to the ideal cubic perovskite
structure. At all temperatures there is a strong splitting of Ag-F distances
parallel to the a,c planes that documents alternating occupation of holes in
x2-y2 and z2-y2 orbitals. The orientation of the octahedron elongation and
thereby the orbital order flips at a structural phase transition occurring
around Ts=240K which is accompanied by a suppression of magnetic
susceptibility. The orbital ordering is further enhanced in the low-temperature
phase and the twisting of the AgF4 plaquettes forming the antiferromagnetic
chains changes. DFT calculations show an enhancement of the magnetic
interaction in the low temperature phase indicating that the transition and the
orbital order are partially driven by the Kugel-Khomskii mechanism.

<h3>Large Anomalous Hall Effect at Room Temperature in a Fermi-Level-Tuned  Kagome Antiferromagnet</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16521" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16521</a>
<br>
<i>Linxuan Song, Feng Zhou, Hang Li, Bei Ding, Xue Li, Xuekui Xi, Yuan Yao, Yong-Chang Lau, Wenhong Wang</i>
<p>The recent discoveries of surperisingly large anomalous Hall effect in chiral
antiderromagnets have triggered extensive research efforts in various fields,
ranging from topological condensed-matter physics to antiferromagnetic
spintronics, and energy harvesting technology. However, such AHE-hosting
antiferromagnetic materials are rare in nature. Herein, we demonstrate that
Mn2.4Ga, a Fermi-level-tuned kagome antiferromagnet, has a large anomalous Hall
conductivity of about 150 {\Omega}-1cm-1 at room temperature that surpasses the
usual high values (i.e.,20-50 {\Omega}-1cm-1) observed so far in two
outstanding kagome antiferromagnets, Mn3Sn and Mn3Ge. The spin triangular
structure of Mn2.4Ga guarantees a nonzero Berry curvature while generates only
a weak net moment in the kagome plane.Moreover, the anomalous Hall conductivity
exhibits a sign reversal with the rotation of a small magnetic field, which can
be ascribed to the field-controlled chirality of the spin triangular structure.
Our theoretical calculation indicate that the large AHE in Mn2.4Ga originates
from a significantly enhanced Berry curvature associated wiht the tuning of the
Fermi level close to the Weyl points. These properties, together with the
ability to manipulate moment orientations using a moderate external magnetic
field, make Mn2.4Ga extremely exciting for future antiferromagnetic
spintronics.

<p>Paramagnetic point defects in silicon provide qubits that could open up
pathways towards silicon-technology based, low-cost, room-temperature (RT)
quantum sensing. The silicon dangling bond (db) is a natural candidate, given
its sub-nanometer localization and direct involvement in spin-dependent
charge-carrier recombination, allowing for electrical spin readout. In
crystalline silicon, however, rapid loss of db spin-coherence at RT due to
free-electron trapping, strongly limits quantum applications. In this work, by
combining density-functional theory and multifrequency (100 MHz-263 GHz) pulsed
electrically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we show that upon
electron capture, dbs in a hydrogenated amorphous silicon matrix form
metastable spin pairs in a well-defined quasi two-dimensional (2D)
configuration. Although highly localized, these entangled spin pairs exhibit
nearly vanishing intrinsic dipolar and exchange coupling. The formation of this
magic-angle-like configuration involves a >0.3 eV energy relaxation of a
trapped electron, stabilizing the pair. This extends RT spin coherence times
into the microsecond range in silicon required for a future spin-based quantum
sensing technology.

<i>Indaco Biazzo, Dian Wu, Giuseppe Carleo</i>
<p>Efficient sampling and approximation of Boltzmann distributions involving
large sets of binary variables, or spins, are pivotal in diverse scientific
fields even beyond physics. Recent advancements in generative neural networks
have significantly impacted this domain. However, those neural networks are
often treated as black boxes, with architectures primarily influenced by
data-driven problems in computational science. Addressing this gap, we
introduce a novel autoregressive neural network architecture named TwoBo,
specifically designed for sparse two-body interacting spin systems. We directly
incorporate the Boltzmann distribution into its architecture and parameters,
resulting in enhanced convergence speed, superior free energy accuracy, and
reduced trainable parameters. We perform numerical experiments on disordered,
frustrated systems with more than 1000 spins on grids and random graphs, and
demonstrated its advantages compared to previous autoregressive and recurrent
architectures. Our findings validate a physically informed approach and suggest
potential extensions to multi-valued variables and many-body interaction
systems, paving the way for broader applications in scientific research.

<br>
<i>Andrea Gabrielli</i>
<p>In this paper we analyse d-dimensional Langevin equations in Ito
representation characterised by anisotropic multiplicative noise, composed by
the superposition of an isotropic tensorial component and a radial one, and a
radial power law drift term. This class of model is relevant in many contexts
ranging from vortex stochastic dynamics, passive scalar transport in fully
developed turbulence and second order phase transitions from active to
absorbing states. The focus of the paper is the system behaviour around the
singularity at vanishing distance depending on the model parameters. This can
vary from regular boundary to naturally repulsive or attractive ones. The work
develops in the following steps: (i) introducing a mapping that disentangle the
radial dynamics from the angular one, with the first characterised by additive
noise and either logarithmic or power law potential, and the second one being
simply a free isotropic Brownian motion on the unitary sphere surface; (ii)
applying the Feller's - Van Kampen's classification of singularities for
continuous Markov processes; (iii) developing an Exponent Hunter Method to find
the small distance scaling behaviour of the solutions; (iv) building a mapping
into a well studied Schrodinger equation with singular potential in order to
build a bridge between Feller's theory of singular boundaries of a continuous
Markov process and the problem of self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian operator
in quantum theory.

<h3>Dynamical quasi-condensation in the weakly interacting Fermi-Hubbard  model</h3>

<br>
<i>Iva Březinová, Markus Stimpfle, Stefan Donsa, Angel Rubio</i>
<p>We study dynamical (quasi)-condensation in the Fermi-Hubbard model starting
from a completely uncorrelated initial state of adjacent doubly occupied sites.
We show that upon expansion of the system in one dimension, dynamical
(quasi)-condensation occurs not only for large interactions via the
condensation of doublons, but also for small interactions. The behavior of the
system is distinctly different in the two parameter regimes, underlining a
different mechanism at work. We address the question whether the dynamical
(quasi-)condensation effect persists in the thermodynamic limit. For this
purpose, we use the two-particle reduced density matrix method, which allows
the extension to large system sizes, long propagation times, and
two-dimensional (2D) systems. Our results indicate that the effect vanishes in
the thermodynamic limit. However, especially in 2D, further investigation
beyond numerically tractable system sizes calls for the use of quantum
simulators, for which we show that the described effect can be investigated by
probing density fluctuations.

<i>Julia Santana-Andreo, Holger-Dietrich Saßnick, Caterina Cocchi</i>
<p>Modern advances in generating ultrabright electron beams have unlocked
unprecedented experimental advances based on synchrotron radiation. Current
challenges lie in improving the quality of electron sources with novel
photocathode materials such as alkali-based semiconductors. To unleash their
potential, a detailed characterization and prediction of their fundamental
properties is essential. In this work, we employ density functional theory
combined with machine learning techniques to probe the thermodynamic stability
of various alkali antimonide crystals, emphasizing the role of the
approximations taken for the exchange-correlation potential. Our results reveal
that the SCAN functional offers an optimal trade-off between accuracy and
computational costs to describe the vibrational properties of these materials.
Furthermore, it is found that systems with a higher concentration of Cs atoms
exhibit enhanced anharmonicities, which are accurately predicted and
characterized with the employed methodology.

<i>B. Evrard, A. Ghita, T. Uto, L. Ciorciaro, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, M. Kroner, A. İmamoğlu</i>
<p>We use time-resolved nonlinear pump--probe measurements to reveal features of
semiconductor moir\'e materials not accessible to linear spectroscopy. With an
intense, red-detuned pump pulse, we generate a high density of virtual excitons
or exciton--polarons in various moir\'e minibands. A broadband probe pulse in
turn measures the response of all optical resonances induced by the
pump-generated excitations. We generically observe a coherent blue shift
originating from contact-like exciton--exciton interactions. At charge
neutrality, these measurements allow us to assess the spatial overlap between
different optical excitations: in particular, we observe signatures of a bound
biexciton state between two different moire exciton modes. For integer fillings
$\nu=2$ and $\nu=3$ of the moir\'e lattice with electrons, the correlated Mott
state results in a suppression of the exciton--polaron interactions, providing
a nonlinear optical signature of electronic incompressibility. In stark
contrast, for lower electron fillings $\nu < 2$, the light shift of the
attractive polaron resonance is electron density independent. Deeply localized
moir\'e polarons are thus akin to an ensemble of non-interacting two-level
atoms, subject to the single-emitter ac Stark effect. Finally, tuning the pump
laser on resonance with the attractive polaron for $\nu < 2$, we demonstrate
the filling of the moir\'e lattice with localized polarons and thereby realize
a nonequilibrium Bose--Fermi mixture in moir\'e flat bands.

<p>This study delves into the intriguing properties of 1H/1T-TaS$_2$ van der
Waals heterostructure, focusing on the transparency of the 1H layer to the
Charge Density Wave of the underlying 1T layer. Despite the sizable interlayer
separation and metallic nature of the 1H layer, positive bias voltages result
in a pronounced superposition of the 1T charge density wave structure on the 1H
layer. The conventional explanation relying on tunneling effects proves
insufficient. Through a comprehensive investigation combining lowtemperature
scanning tunneling microscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, non-contact
atomic force microscopy, and firstprinciples calculations, we propose an
alternative interpretation. The transparency effect arises from a weak yet
substantial electronic coupling between the 1H and 1T layers, challenging prior
understanding of the system. Our results highlight the critical role played by
interlayer electronic interactions in van der Waals heterostructures to
determine the final ground states of the systems.

<p>Ultracold atomic spin mixtures develop rich and intriguing magnetic
properties when an external radiation coherently couples different spin states.
In particular, the coupled mixture may acquire a critical behavior when the
spin interactions equal the coupling energy. However, atomic mixtures generally

<p>Strong coupling between light and molecular matter is currently attracting
interest both in chemistry and physics, in the fast-growing field of molecular
polaritonics. The large near-field enhancement of the electric field of
plasmonic surfaces and their high tunability make arrays of metallic
nanoparticles an interesting platform to achieve and control strong coupling.
Two dimensional plasmonic arrays with several nanoparticles per unit cell and
crystalline symmetries can host topological edge and corner states. Here we
explore the coupling of molecular materials to these edge states using a
coupled-dipole framework including long-range interactions. We study both the
weak and strong coupling regimes and demonstrate that coupling to topological
edge states can be employed to enhance highly-directional long-range energy
transfer between molecules.

<br>
<i>M. Wiśniewski, J. Łuczka, J. Spiechowicz</i>
<p>Recent pioneering experiments on non-Markovian dynamics done e.g. for active
matter have demonstrated that our theoretical understanding of this challenging
yet hot topic is rather incomplete and there is a wealth of phenomena still
awaiting discovery. It is related to the fact that typically for simplification
the Markovian approximation is employed and as a consequence the memory is
neglected. Therefore methods allowing to study memory effects are extremely
valuable. We demonstrate that a non-Markovian system described by the
Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) for a Brownian particle of mass $M$ can be
approximated by the memoryless Langevin equation in which the memory effects
are correctly reproduced solely via the effective mass $M^*$ of the Brownian
particle which is determined only by the form of the memory kernel. Our work
lays the foundation for an impactful approach which allows to readily study
memory-related corrections to Markovian dynamics.

<h3>Rapidly convergent coupled-cluster Monte Carlo using a Chebyshev  projector</h3>

<br>
<i>Zijun Zhao, Maria-Andreea Filip, Alex J W Thom</i>
<p>The multi-reference coupled-cluster Monte Carlo (MR-CCMC) algorithm is a
determinant-based quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm that is conceptually
similar to Full Configuration Interaction QMC (FCIQMC). It has been shown to
offer a balanced treatment of both static and dynamic correlation while
retaining polynomial scaling, although scaling to large systems with
significant strong correlation remained impractical. In this paper, we document
recent algorithmic advances that enable rapid convergence and a more black-box
approach to the multi-reference problem. These include a logarithmically
scaling metric-tree based excitation acceptance algorithm to search for
determinants connected to the model space at the desired excitation level and a
symmetry-screening procedure for the reference space. We show that, for
moderately sized model spaces, the new search algorithm brings about an
approximately 8-fold acceleration of one MR-CCMC iteration, while the symmetry
screening procedure reduces the number of active model space determinants at
essentially no loss of accuracy. We also introduce a stochastic implementation
of an approximate wall projector, which is the infinite imaginary time limit of
the exponential projector, using a truncated expansion of the wall function in
Chebyshev polynomials. We show that this wall-Chebyshev projector requires
significantly fewer applications of the Hamiltonian to achieve the same
statistical convergence. We have applied these methods to calculate the binding
curve of the beryllium and carbon dimers with large active spaces, obtaining
binding curves that are close to FCIQMC quality. Notably, the wall-Chebyshev
projector presented here can be applied to accelerate any projector-based QMC
algorithm. This paper represents a significant step in the algorithmic
maturation of the MR-CCMC algorithm and paves the way for large-scale
calculations.

<p>The valley degree of freedom in honeycomb crystals such as 2D semiconductors,
graphene and bilayer graphene is a promising carrier of quantum information
alongside spin and charge. This is all the more true since gate-controlled
single-particle quantum dots (QDs) have been demonstrated in bilayer graphene
(BLG), paving the way for the realisation of spin and valley qubits. Although
long spin relaxation times have recently been reported in BLG QDs, nothing is
known about single-particle valley lifetimes. Here we report single-particle
valley relaxation times ($T_1$ times) exceeding several microseconds in
electrostatically defined BLG QDs. The observed dependence of $T_1$ on the
perpendicular magnetic field can be understood qualitatively and quantitatively
by a model in which $T_1$ is limited by electron-phonon coupling. We identify
coupling to acoustic phonons via the bond length change and via the deformation
potential as the limiting mechanisms.

<h3>Matrix denoising: Bayes-optimal estimators via low-degree polynomials</h3>

<p>We consider the additive version of the matrix denoising problem, where a
random symmetric matrix $S$ of size $n$ has to be inferred from the observation
of $Y=S+Z$, with $Z$ an independent random matrix modeling a noise. For prior
distributions of $S$ and $Z$ that are invariant under conjugation by orthogonal
matrices we determine, using results from first and second order free
probability theory, the Bayes-optimal (in terms of the mean square error)
polynomial estimators of degree at most $D$, asymptotically in $n$, and show
that as $D$ increases they converge towards the estimator introduced by Bun,
Allez, Bouchaud and Potters in [IEEE Transactions on Information Theory {\bf
62}, 7475 (2016)]. We conjecture that this optimality holds beyond strictly
orthogonally invariant priors, and provide partial evidences of this
universality phenomenon when $S$ is an arbitrary Wishart matrix and $Z$ is
drawn from the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble, a case motivated by the related
extensive rank matrix factorization problem.

<h3>Synthesis, structural and magnetic characterizations of  Li$_4$Cu$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$TeO$_6$ ( $x$ = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1)</h3>

<p>We investigated the effect of Ni doping in a recently proposed quantum spin
liquid (QSL) candidate Li$_4$CuTeO$_6$. We performed a comprehensive study on
the structural and magnetic properties. We find that the anti-site disorder
between Li$^+$ and Cu$^{2+}$ persists until 50\% Ni doping in which Ni and Cu
occupy different crystallographic sites. As a result, while Cu sits in both
triangular and honeycomb layers in Li$_4$CuTeO$_6$, Ni forms only honeycomb
layer in Li$_4$NiTeO$_6$ and Li$_4$Cu$_{0.5}$Ni$_{0.5}$TeO$_6$. Our magnetic
susceptibility measurements show that the Weiss temperature decreases from
-145.68 K in Li$_4$CuTeO$_6$ to -6.15 K in Li$_4$NiTeO$_6$ as Ni doping
increases, and find no hint of magnetic ordering or freezing down to 1.8 K. Our
analysis implies the existence of abundant low energy excitations in these
materials.

<h3>Chern Bands with Higher-Order Van Hove Singularities on Topological  Moiré Surface States</h3>

<p>In two-dimensional electronic lattices, changes in the topology of the Fermi
surface (Lifshitz transitions) lead to Van Hove singularities characterized by
a divergence in the electronic density of states. Van Hove singularities can
enhance the effect of electronic interactions, providing a platform to explore
novel correlated electronic states. In this work, we investigate the emergence
of topological Chern bands on the surface of three-dimensional topological
insulators, which host higher-order Van Hove singularities that are
characterized by the power-law diverging density of states. These singularities
can arise from the interplay between a time-reversal breaking Zeeman field
induced by proximity to a ferromagnetic insulator and a time-reversal invariant
moir\'e potential on the surface electrons, created by quintuple layer
misalignment in a family of topological insulators such as Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and
Bi$_2$Te$_3$, which host a single surface Dirac fermion. We establish the onset
of Chern bands near charge neutrality with Chern numbers $C = \pm 1$ that also
possess a manifold of higher-order Van Hove singularities on the moir\'e
Brillouin zone valleys controlled by the Zeeman and moir\'e potential energy
scales, unveiling a new platform to realize exotic Lifshitz transitions in
topological bands. Furthermore, we show that the strong peaks in the density of
states in the vicinity of Lifshitz transitions give rise to characteristic
features in the low-temperature intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity, yielding
a path to probe Van Hove singularities in Chern bands through anomalous
transport measurements.

<h3>Linear Magnetoresistance from Glassy Orders</h3>

<i>Jaewon Kim, Ehud Altman, Shubhayu Chatterjee</i>
<p>Several strongly correlated metals display B-linear magnetoresistance (LMR)
with a universal slope, in sharp contrast to the $B^2$ scaling predicted by
Fermi liquid theory. We provide a unifying explanation of the origin of LMR by
focusing on a common feature in their phase diagrams -- proximity to
symmetry-breaking orders. Specifically, we demonstrate via two microscopic
models that LMR with a universal slope arises ubiquitously near ordered phases,
provided the order parameter either (i) has a finite wave-vector, or (ii) has
nodes on the Fermi surface. We elucidate the distinct physical mechanisms at
play in these two scenarions, and derive upper and lower bounds on the field
range for which LMR is observed. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of our
picture to strange metal physics at higher temperatures, and argue that our
theory provides an understanding of recent experimental results on thin film
cuprates and moir\'e materials.
