<h3>Negative tripartite information after quantum quenches in integrable  systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10245" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10245</a>
<br>
<i>Fabio Caceffo, Vincenzo Alba</i>
<br>
<br>
We build the quasiparticle picture for the tripartite mutual information
(TMI) after quantum quenches in spin chains that can be mapped onto
free-fermion theories. A nonzero TMI (equivalently, topological entropy)
signals quantum correlations between three regions of a quantum many-body
system. The TMI is sensitive to entangled multiplets of more than two
quasiparticles, i.e., beyond the entangled-pair paradigm of the standard
quasiparticle picture. Surprisingly, for some nontrivially entangled multiplets
the TMI is negative at intermediate times. This means that the mutual
information is monogamous, similar to holographic theories. Oppositely, for
multiplets that are "classically" entangled, the TMI is positive. Crucially, a
negative TMI reflects that the entanglement content of the multiplets is not
directly related to the Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE) that describes the
post-quench steady state. Thus, the TMI is the ideal lens to observe the
weakening of the relationship between entanglement and thermodynamics. We
benchmark our results in the XX chain and in the transverse field Ising chain.
In the hydrodynamic limit of long times and large intervals, with their ratio
fixed, exact lattice results are in agreement with the quasiparticle picture.

<h3>Dynamical structure factor and a new method to measure the pairing gap  in two-dimensional attractive Fermi-Hubbard model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09685" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09685</a>
<br>
<i>Huaisong Zhao, Peng Zou, Feng Yuan</i>
<br>
<br>
By calculating the dynamical structure factor along the high symmetry
directions in the Brillouin zone, the dynamical excitations in two-dimensional
attractive Fermi-Hubbard model are studied based on the random-phase
approximation. At the small transfer momentum, the sound speed can be obtained
and is suppressed by the interaction strength. In particular, at the transfer
momentum ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$, the dynamical structure factor
consists of a sharp bosonic molecular excitation peak in the low-energy region
and a broad atomic excitation band in the higher energy region. Furthermore, as
the hopping strength increases (the interaction strength decreases), the weight
of the molecular excitation peak decreases monotonically while the weight of
the atomic excitations increases quickly. The area of the molecular excitation
peak scales with the square of the pairing gap, which also applies to the
spin-orbit coupling case. These theoretical results show that the pairing gap
in optical lattice can be obtained experimentally by measuring the dynamical
structure factor at ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$.

<h3>Unveiling Topological Modes on Curved Surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09728" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09728</a>

<br>
<br>
In this paper, we investigate topological modes of different physical systems
defined on arbitrary two-dimensional curved surfaces. We consider the shallow
water equations, inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations, Jackiw-Rebbi model and show
how the topological protection mechanism responses to the presence of curvature
in different situations. We show the existence of a line gap in the considered
models and study the condition on the curve which can host topological modes.

<h3>Spin scattering and Hall effects in monolayer Fe3GeTe2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09743" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09743</a>
<br>
<i>Luyan Yu, Jie-Xiang Yu, Jiadong Zang, Roger K. Lake, Houlong Zhuang, Gen Yin</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically show that the carrier transport in monolayer Fe3GeTe2
experiences a transition between anomalous Hall effect and spin Hall effect
when the spin polarization of disorders switches between out-of-plane and
in-plane. These Hall effects are allowed when the magnetization is polarized
in-plane, breaking the C3 rotation symmetry. The transition originates from the
selection rule of spin scattering, the strong spin-orbit coupling, and the van
Hove singularities near the Fermi surface. The scattering selection rule
tolerates the sign change of the disorder spin, which provides a convenient
method to detect the switching of antiferromagnetic insulators regardless of
the interfacial roughness in a heterostructure. This provides a convenient
platform for the study of 2D spintronics through various van-der-Waals
heterostructures.

<h3>Flat bands in bilayer graphene induced by proximity with polar $h$-BN  superlattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09749" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09749</a>
<br>
<i>Marta Brzezi≈Ñska, Oleg V. Yazyev</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the observation of polarization superlattices in twisted
multilayers of hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN), we address the possibility of
using these heterostructures for tailoring the properties of multilayer
graphene by means of the electrostatic proximity effect. By using the
combination of first-principles and large-scale tight-binding model
calculations coupled via the Wannier function approach, we demonstrate the
possibility of creating a sequence of well-separated flat-band manifolds in
AB-stacked bilayer graphene at experimentally relevant superlattice
periodicities above $\sim$30 nm. Our calculations show that the details of band
structures depend on the local inversion symmetry breaking and the vertical
electrical polarization, which are directly related to the atomic arrangement.
The results advance the atomistic characterization of graphene-based systems in
a superlattice potential beyond the continuum model.

<h3>Controlling entanglement in a triple-well system of dipolar atoms</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09754" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09754</a>
<br>
<i>Karin Wittmann W, Leandro H. Ymai, Bruno H. C. Barros, Jon Links, Angela Foerster</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the dynamics of entanglement and atomic populations of ultracold
dipolar bosons in an aligned three-well potential described by an extended
Bose-Hubbard model. We focus on a sufficiently strong interacting regime where
the couplings are tuned to obtain an integrable system, in which the time
evolution exhibits a resonant behavior that can be exactly predicted. Within
this framework, we propose a protocol that includes an integrability breaking
step by tilting the edge wells for a short time through an external field,
allowing the production of quantum states with a controllable degree of
entanglement. We analyze this protocol for different initial states and show
the formation of highly entangled states as well as NOON-like states. These
results offer valuable insights into how entanglement can be controlled in
ultracold atom systems that may be useful for the proposals of new quantum
devices.

<h3>Random walks on modular chains: Detecting structure through statistics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09759" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09759</a>
<br>
<i>Matthew Gerry, Dvira Segal</i>
<br>
<br>
We study kinetic transport through modular networks consisting of alternating
domains using both analytical and numerical methods. We demonstrate that the
mean velocity is insensitive to the local structure of the network, and it
indicates only on global, structural-averaged properties. However, by examining
high-order cumulants characterizing the kinetics, we reveal information on the
degree of inhomogeneity of blocks and the size of repeating units in the
network. Specifically, in unbiased diffusion, the kurtosis is the first
transport coefficient that exposes structural information, whereas in biased
chains, the diffusion coefficient already reveals structural motifs.
Nevertheless, this latter dependence is weak and it disappears at both low and
high biasing. Our study demonstrates that high order moments of the population
distribution over sites provide information about the network structure that is
not captured by the first moment (mean velocity) alone. These results are
useful towards deciphering mechanisms and determining architectures underlying
long-range charge transport in biomolecules and biological and chemical
reaction networks.

<h3>On out-of-equilibrium phenomena in pseudogap phase of complex SYK+U  model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09767" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09767</a>
<br>
<i>Artem Alexandrov, Alexander Gorsky</i>
<br>
<br>
In this Letter we consider the out-of-equilibrium phenomena in the complex
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model supplemented with the attractive Hubbard
interaction (SYK+U). This model provides the clear-cut transition from
non-Fermi liquid phase in pure SYK to the superconducting phase through the
pseudogap phase with non-synchronized Cooper pairs. We investigate the quench
of the phase soft mode in this model and the relaxation to the equilibrium
state. Using the relation with Hamiltonian mean field (HMF) model we show that
the SYK+U model enjoys the several interesting phenomena, like violent
relaxation, quasi-stationary long living states, out-of-equilibrium finite time
phase transitions, non-extensivity and tower of condensates. We comment on the
holographic dual gravity counterparts of these phenomena.

<h3>Ice Rule Breakdown and frustrated antiferrotoroidicity in an artificial  colloidal Cairo ice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09769" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09769</a>
<br>
<i>Carolina Rodr√≠guez-Gallo, Antonio Ortiz-Ambriz, Cristiano Nisoli, Pietro Tierno</i>
<br>
<br>
We combine experiments and numerical simulations to investigate the low
energy states and the emergence of topological defects in an artificial
colloidal ice in the Cairo geometry. This type of geometry is characterized by
a mixed coordination ($z$), with coexistence of both $z=3$ and $z=4$ vertices.
We realize this particle ice by confining field tunable paramagnetic colloidal
particles within a lattice of topographic double wells at a one to one filling
using optical tweezers. By raising the interaction strength via an applied
magnetic field, we find that the ice rule breaks down, and positive monopoles
with charge $q=+2$ accumulate in the $z = 4$ vertices and are screened by
negative ones ($q=-1$) in the $z = 3$. The resulting, strongly coupled state
remains disordered. Further, via analysis of the mean chirality associated to
each pentagonal plaquette, we find that the disordered ensemble for this
geometry is massively degenerate and it corresponds to a frustrated
antiferrotoroid.

<h3>Lattice Dynamics and Thermal Transport in Semiconductors with  Anti-bonding Valence Bands</h3>

Achieving high thermoelectric performance requires efficient manipulation of
thermal conductivity and a fundamental understanding of the microscopic
mechanisms of phonon transport in crystalline solids. One of the major
challenges in thermal transport is achieving ultralow lattice thermal
conductivity. In this study, we use the anti-bonding character of the
highest-occupied valence band as an efficient descriptor for discovering new
materials with an ultralow thermal conductivity. We first examined the
relationship between anti-bonding valence bands and low lattice thermal
conductivity in model systems PbTe and CsPbBr3. Then, we conducted a
high-throughput search in the Materials Project database and identified over
600 experimentally stable binary semi-conductors with a strong anti-bonding
character in their valence bands. From our candidate list, we conducted a
comprehensive analysis of the chemical bonds and the thermal transport in the
XS family, where X=K, Rb, and Cs are alkaline metals. These materials all
exhibit ultralow thermal conductivities less than 1 W/(m K) at room temperature
despite simple structures. We attributed the ultralow thermal conductivity to
the weakened bonds and increased phonon anharmonicity due to their anti-bonding
valence bands. Our results provide chemical intuitions to understand lattice
dynamics in crystals and open up a convenient venue towards searching for
materials with an intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity.

<h3>Active-matter isomorphs in the size-polydisperse Ornstein-Uhlenbeck  Lennard-Jones model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09801" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09801</a>
<br>
<i>Daniel Jespersen, Lorenzo Costigliola, Jeppe C. Dyre, Shibu Saw</i>
<br>
<br>
This paper studies size-polydisperse Lennard-Jones systems described by
active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle dynamics. The focus is on the existence of
isomorphs (curves of invariant structure and dynamics) in the model's
three-dimensional phase diagram. First, the isomorphs are traced out from a
single steady-state configuration by means of the configurational-temperature
method [Saw et al., Phys. Rev. E 107, 024609 (2023)]. Good invariance of the
structure (probed by the reduced-unit radial distribution function) and of the
dynamics (probed by the mean-square displacement as a function of time) is
demonstrated for three uniform-distribution polydispersities, 12%, 23%, and
29%. Comparing to active-matter isomorphs generated by the analytical
direct-isomorph-check method, the latter give somewhat worse invariance of the
structure but better invariance of the dynamics. We conclude that both methods
can be used to quickly get an overview of the phase diagram of AOUP models
involving a potential-energy function obeying the hidden-scale-invariance
symmetry that generally required for isomorph theory to apply.

<h3>On the universality class of the special adsorption point of  two-dimensional lattice polymers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09803" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09803</a>
<br>
<i>Nathann T. Rodrigues, Tiago J. Oliveira, Thomas Prellberg</i>
<br>
<br>
In recent work [PRE 100, 022121 (2019)] evidence was found that the surface
adsorption transition of interacting self-avoiding trails (ISATs) placed on the
square lattice displays a non-universal behavior at the special adsorption
point (SAP) where the collapsing polymers adsorb. In fact, different surface
exponents $\phi^{(s)}$ and $1/\delta^{(s)}$ were found at the SAP depending on
whether the surface orientation is horizontal (HS) or diagonal (DS). Here, we
revisit these systems and study other ones, through extensive Monte Carlo
simulations, considering much longer trails than previous works. Importantly,
we demonstrate that the different exponents observed in the reference above are
due to the presence of a previously unseen surface-attached-globule (SAG) phase
in the DS system, which changes the multicritical nature of the SAP and is
absent in the HS case. By considering a modified horizontal surface (mHS) where
the trails are forbidden of having two consecutive steps along it, resembling
the DS situation, a stable SAG phase is found in the phase diagram, and both DS
and mHS systems present similar $1/\delta^{(s)}$ exponents at the SAP, being
$1/\delta^{(s)} \approx 0.44$, whilst $1/\delta^{(s)} \approx 0.34$ in the HS
case. Intriguingly, while $\phi^{(s)} \approx 1/\delta^{(s)}$ is found for the
DS and HS scenarios, as expected, in the mHS case $\phi^{(s)}$ is about $10$\%
smaller than $1/\delta^{(s)}$. These results strongly indicate that at least
two universality classes exist for the SAPs of adsorbing ISATs on the square
lattice.

<h3>Mesoscopic critical fluctuations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09819" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09819</a>
<br>
<i>Saikat Banerjee, Nikolai A. Sinitsyn</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate magnetic fluctuations of a mesoscopic critical region at the
interface induced by smooth time-independent spacial changes of a control
parameter across its critical value. Near the spatial critical point, the order
parameter fluctuations are mesoscopic, i.e., much larger than the lattice
constant but decaying away from the critical region. We propose a minimal model
to describe this behavior and show that it leads to the integrable
Painlev\'e-II equation for the local order parameter. We argue that known
mathematical properties of this equation produce insight into the nonlinear
susceptibilities of this region.

The engineering of new states of matter through Floquet driving has
revolutionized the field of condensed matter physics. This technique enables
the creation of hybrid topological states and ordered phases that are absent in
normal systems. Crystalline structures, exemplifying spatially ordered systems
under periodic driving, have been extensively studied. However, the recent
focus has shifted towards discrete time crystals (DTCs), periodically driven
quantum many-body systems that break time translation symmetry under specific
conditions. In this paper, we explore the theoretical predictions, experimental
realizations, and emerging possibilities of utilizing DTCs on quantum
computers. Additionally, the formation of time varying tesseracts using
discrete time crystals is presented, allowing for the investigation of time
translational symmetry in higher-dimensional lattice systems.

<h3>Spin-wave dynamics controlled by tunable ac magnonic crystal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09876" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09876</a>
<br>
<i>Ankang Liu, Alexander M. Finkel'stein</i>
<br>
<br>
The magnonic crystal, which has a spatial modulation wave vector $q$, couples
the spin wave with wave vector $k$ to the one with wave vector $k-q$. For a
conventional magnonic crystal with direct current (dc) supply, the spin waves
around $q/2$ are resonantly coupled to the waves near $-q/2$, and a band gap is
opened at $k=\pm q/2$. If instead of the dc current the magnonic crystal is
supplied with an alternating current (ac), then the band gap is \emph{shifted}
to $k$ satisfying $|\omega_{s}(k)-\omega_{s}(k-q)|=\omega_{ac}$; here
$\omega_{s}(k)$ is the dispersion of the spin wave, while $\omega_{ac}$ is the
frequency of the ac modulation. The resulting gap in the case of the ac
magnonic crystal is the half of the one caused by the dc with the same
amplitude of modulation. The time evolution of the resonantly coupled spin
waves controlled by properly suited ac pulses can be well interpreted as the
motion on a Bloch sphere. The tunability of the ac magnonic crystal broadens
the perspective of spin-wave computing.

<h3>Substantial reduction of write-error rate for voltage-controlled  magnetoresistive random access memory by in-plane demagnetizing field and  voltage-induced negative out-of-plane anisotropy field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09883" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09883</a>
<br>
<i>Rie Matsumoto, Shiniji Yuasa, Hiroshi Imamura</i>
<br>
<br>
Voltage-controlled magnetoresistive random access memory (VC-MRAM) based on
voltage-induced dynamic switching in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is a
promising ultimate non-volatile memory with ultralow power consumption.
However, the dynamic switching in a conventional MTJ is accompanied by a
relatively high write error rate (WER), hindering the reliable operation of
VC-MRAM. Here, we propose a reliable writing scheme using the in-plane
demagnetizing field (IDF) and voltage-induced negative out-of-plane anisotropy
field (NOAF). Numerical simulations based on macrospin model demonstrate that
the voltage-induced NOAF modifies the switching dynamics and increases the
torque due to the IDF, thereby reducing the switching time. The IDF and
voltage-induced NOAF also reduce the mean energy difference between the
magnetization direction at the end of the pulse and the equilibrium direction.
As a result, an appropriate combination of the IDF and voltage-induced NOAF
reduces the WER by one order of magnitude compared with that of the dynamic
switching in a conventional MTJ.

<h3>Tensor Network Methods for Extracting CFT Data from Fixed-Point Tensors  and Defect Coarse Graining</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09899" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09899</a>
<br>
<i>Wenhan Guo, Tzu-Chieh Wei</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a comprehensive study on the extraction of CFT data using tensor
network methods, specially, from the fixed-point tensor of the linearized
tensor renormalization group (lTRG) for the 2D classical Ising model near the
critical temperature. Utilizing two different methods, we extract operator
scaling dimensions and operator-product-expansion (OPE) coefficients by
introducing defects on the lattice and by employing the fixed-point tensor. We
also explore the effects of point-like defects in the lattice on the
coarse-graining process. We find that there is a correspondence between
coarse-grained defect tensors and conformal states obtained from lTRG
fixed-point equation. We also analyze the capabilities and limitations of our
proposed coarse-graining scheme for tensor networks with point-like defects,
which includes graph independent local truncation (GILT) and higher-order
tensor renormalization group (HOTRG). Our results provide a better
understanding of the capacity and limitations of the tenor renormalization
group scheme in coarse-graining defect tensors, and we show that GILT+HOTRG can
be used to give accurate two- and four-point functions under specific
conditions. We also find that employing the minimal canonical form further
improves the stability of the RG flow.

<h3>Pump-probe spectroscopy of the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model at  half filling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09909" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09909</a>
<br>
<i>Koudai Sugimoto, Satoshi Ejima</i>
<br>
<br>
By utilizing time-dependent tensor-network algorithms in the (infinite)
matrix-product-state representation, we theoretically investigate the
pump-probe spectroscopy of the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model at half
filling. Our focus lies on nonequilibrium optical conductivity and time- and
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments. In the spin-density-wave
(SDW) phase, we identify an in-gap state in the nonequilibrium optical
conductivity due to the formation of excitons (or doublon-holon pairs),
generated by the pulse through nonlocal interactions. In the strong-coupling
regime, we discern additional multiple in-gap and out-of-gap states. In the
charge-density-wave (CDW) phase, we detect not only an in-gap state but also a
finite Drude weight, which results from the dissolution of charge order by
photoexcitation. Analyzing time-dependent single-particle excitation spectra
directly in the thermodynamic limit confirms the origin of these new states in
the SDW and CDW phases as the excitation of newly emerged dispersions. Our
study illustrates that the pump-probe spectroscopy simulations in the
thermodynamic limit furnish unambiguous spectral structures that allow for
direct comparison with experimental results, and the integration of
nonequilibrium optical conductivity and time- and angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy provides comprehensive insights into nonequilibrium states.

<h3>An unambiguous and robust formulation for Wannier localization</h3>

We provide a new variational definition for the spread of an orbital under
periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) that is continuous with respect to the
gauge, consistent in the thermodynamic limit, well-suited to diffuse orbitals,
and systematically adaptable to schemes computing localized Wannier functions.
Existing definitions do not satisfy all these desiderata, partly because they
depend on an "orbital center"-an ill-defined concept under PBCs. Based on this
theoretical development, we showcase a robust and efficient (10x-70x fewer
iterations) localization scheme across a range of materials.

Multistate memory systems have the ability to store and process more data in
the same physical space as binary memory systems, making them a potential
alternative to existing binary memory systems. In the past, it has been
demonstrated that voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) based writing
is highly energy-efficient compared to other writing methods used in
non-volatile nano-magnetic binary memory systems. In this study, we introduce a
new, VCMA-based and skyrmion-mediated non-volatile ternary memory system using
a perpendicular magnetic tunnel junction (p-MTJ) in the presence of room
temperature thermal perturbation. We have also shown that ternary states {-1,
0, +1} can be implemented with three magnetoresistance values obtained from a
p-MTJ corresponding to ferromagnetic up, down, and skyrmion state, with 99%
switching probability in the presence of room temperature thermal noise in an
energy-efficient way, requiring ~3 fJ energy on an average for each switching
operation. Additionally, we show that our proposed ternary memory demonstrates
an improvement in area and energy by at least 2X and ~60X respectively,
compared to state-of-the-art spin-transfer torque (STT)-based non-volatile
magnetic multistate memories. Furthermore, these three states can be
potentially utilized for energy-efficient, high-density in-memory quantized
deep neural network implementation.

<h3>Cathodoluminescence spectroscopy of monolayer hexagonal boron nitride</h3>

<br>
<br>
Cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for studying
emission properties of optoelectronic materials because CL is free from
excitable bandgap limits and from ambiguous signals due to simple light
scattering and resonant Raman scattering potentially involved in the
photoluminescence (PL) spectra. However, direct CL measurements of atomically
thin two-dimensional materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides and
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), have been difficult due to the small excitation
volume that interacts with high-energy electron beams (e-beams). Herein,
distinct CL signals from a monolayer hBN, namely mBN, epitaxial film grown on a
highly oriented pyrolytic graphite substrate are shown by using a home-made CL
system capable of large-area and surface-sensitive excitation by an e-beam. The
spatially resolved CL spectra at 13 K exhibited a predominant 5.5-eV emission
band, which has been ascribed to originate from multilayered aggregates of hBN,
markedly at thicker areas formed on the step edges of the substrate.
Conversely, a faint peak at 6.04 eV was routinely observed from atomically flat
areas. Since the energy agreed with the PL peak of 6.05 eV at 10 K that has
been assigned as being due to the recombination of phonon-assisted direct
excitons of mBN by Elias et al. [Nat. Commun. 10, 2639 (2019)], the CL peak at
6.04 eV is attributed to originate from the mBN epilayer. The CL results
support the transition from indirect bandgap in bulk hBN to direct bandgap in
mBN, in analogy with molybdenum disulfide. The results also encourage to

Understanding fluctuation phenomena plays a dominant role in the development
of many-body physics. The time evolution of entanglement is essential to a
broad range of subjects in many-body physics, ranging from exotic quantum
matter to quantum thermalization. Stemming from various dynamical processes of
information, fluctuations in entanglement evolution differ conceptually from
out-of-equilibrium fluctuations of traditional physical quantities. Their
studies remain elusive. Here we uncover an emergent random structure in the
evolution of the wavefunction in a class of integrable models. It gives rise to
out-of-equilibrium entanglement fluctuations which, strikingly, fall into the
paradigm of mesoscopic fluctuations of wave interference origin. Specifically,
the entanglement entropy variance obeys a universal scaling law, and the
distribution displays a sub-Gaussian upper and a sub-Gamma lower tail. These
statistics are independent of both the system's microscopic details and the
choice of entanglement probes, and broaden the class of mesoscopic
universalities. They have practical implications for controlling entanglement
in mesoscopic devices.

In order to gain a deeper understanding of complex systems and infer key
information using minimal data, I classify all configurations based on
classical probability, starting from the dimensions of energy and different
categories of configurations. By utilizing the principle of maximum entropy, it
is concluded that all possible configurations with the same energy have equal
probabilities of occurrence. By using different representations of high and low
energy, the emergence of a transition point has been inferred. Finally, I take
the Ising model as an example and calculate the transition point of the
thermodynamic phase transition, which is determined to be 2.25. This value is
very close to the simulation value obtained by Monte Carlo method, but I have
only consumed a small amount of computational resources in the process.

<h3>Emergence of superconductivity in single-crystalline LaFeAsO under  simultaneous Sm and P substitution</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10034" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10034</a>

<br>
<br>
We report on the high-pressure growth, structural characterization, and
investigation of the electronic properties of single-crystalline LaFeAsO
co-substituted by Sm and P, in both its normal- and superconducting states.
Here, the appearance of superconductivity is attributed to the inner chemical
pressure induced by the smaller-size isovalent substituents. X-ray structural
refinements show that the partial substitution of La by Sm and As by P in the
parent LaFeAsO compound leads to a contraction in both the conducting
Fe2(As,P)2 layers and the interlayer spacing. The main parameters of the
superconducting state, including the critical temperature, the lower- and upper
critical fields, as well as the coherence length, the penetration depth, and
their anisotropy, were determined from magnetometry measurements on a
single-crystalline La0.87Sm0.13FeAs0.91P0.09O sample. The critical current
density (jc), as resulting from loops of magnetization hysteresis in the
self-generated magnetic field, is 2 x 106 A/cm2 at 2 K. Overall, our findings
illustrate a rare and interesting case of how superconductivity can be induced
by co-substitution in the 1111 family. Such approach delineates new
possibilities in the creation of superconductors by design, thus stimulating
the exploration of related systems under multi-chemical pressure conditions.

We study the room-temperature electrical control of charge and spin transport
in high-quality bilayer graphene, fully encapsulated with hBN and contacted via
1D spin injectors. We show that spin transport in this device architecture is
measurable at room temperature and its spin transport parameters can be
modulated by opening of a band gap via a perpendicular displacement field. The
modulation of the spin current is dominated by the control of the spin
relaxation time with displacement field, demonstrating the basic operation of a
spin-based field-effect transistor.

<br>
<br>
The pairing structure of superconducting materials is regulated by the point
group symmetries of the crystal. Here, we study spin-singlet multiorbital
superconductivity in materials with unusually low crystalline symmetry content
and unveil the the appearance of even-parity (s-wave) Cooper pairs with high
orbital moment. We show that the lack of mirror and rotation symmetries makes
pairing states with quintet orbital angular momentum symmetry-allowed. A
remarkable fingerprint of this type of pairing state is provided by a
nontrivial superconducting phase texture in momentum space with $\pi$-shifted
domains and walls with anomalous phase winding. The pattern of the quintet
pairing texture is shown to depend on the orientation of the orbital
polarization and the strength of the mirror and/or rotation symmetry breaking
terms. Such momentum dependent phase makes Cooper pairs with net orbital
component suited to design orbitronic Josephson effects. We discuss how an
intrinsic orbital dependent phase can set out anomalous Josephson couplings by
employing superconducting leads with nonequivalent breaking of crystalline
symmetry.

Systematic research was performed to investigate magnetic properties of the
Tsai-type Ga-Pd-RE (RE = Gd, Tb, Dy, and Ho) systems, where both 1/1 and 2/1
quasicrystal approximants (ACs) are attainable at the same compositions as
thermodynamical stable phases. Most of the samples exhibited spin-glass
(SG)-like freezing behavior at low temperatures except Ga-Pd-Tb 2/1 AC and
Ga-Pd-Ho 1/1 AC. The former showcased antiferromagnetic order at 5.78 K while
the latter did not show any anomaly down to 1.8 K. Furthermore, 2/1 ACs were
noticed to be less frustrated than their corresponding 1/1 ACs presumably due
to the disorder-free environment in the nearest neighbors of the rare earth
sites that form a network of distorted octahedron in the 2/1 ACs. The spin
dynamic in SG samples was also characterized by means of ac magnetic
susceptibility measurements. The results evidenced a weak response of the
freezing temperatures to the measurement frequency in the Heisenberg systems,
i.e., Gd-contained ACs, in contrast to the non-Heisenberg systems, i.e., Tb, Dy
and Ho-contained ACs, where significant dependency is noticed for the latter.
The spin-glass samples were further examined by fitting their freezing
temperatures to the Vogel-Fulcher law.

<br>
<br>
We present a study of the piezostrain-tunable gyrotropic dynamics in
Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$ vortex microstructures fabricated on a 0.7PMN-0.3PT
single crystalline substrate. Using field-modulated spin rectification
measurements, we demonstrate large frequency tunability (up to 45 %) in
individual microdisks accessed locally with low surface voltages, and
magnetoresistive readout. With increased voltage applied to the PMN-PT, we
observe a gradual decrease of the vortex core gyrotropic frequency associated
with the strain-induced magnetoelastic energy contribution. The frequency
tunability strongly depends on the disk size, with increased frequency
downshift for the disks with larger diameter. Micromagnetic simulations suggest
that the observed size effects originate from the joint action of the
strain-induced magnetoelastic and demagnetizing energies in large magnetic
disks. These results enable a selective energy-efficient tuning of the vortex
gyrotropic frequency in individual vortex-based oscillators with all-electrical
operation.

<br>
<br>
By means of the field-theoretic renormalization group, we study the damping
of the viscosity coefficient near the superfluid phase transition. We utilize
the fact that in the infrared region, the complex model used to describe the
phase transition belongs to the same universality class as the well-known
stochastic model A. This allows us a determination of the critical behavior of
viscosity using composite operators for model A. Our analysis is based on the
$\varepsilon$-expansion near the upper critical dimension $d_c = 4$ of model A.
The critical exponent of viscosity is then calculated from the critical
dimensions of composite operators of massless two-component model A. In
particular, we present results for critical dimensions of a selected class of
composite operators with the canonical dimension $8$ to the leading order.

In the classical approach to deal with near-field radiative heat exchanges
between two closely spaced bodies no coupling between the different heat
carriers inside the materials and thermal photons is usually considered. Here
we make an overview of the current state of studies on this coupling between
solids of different sizes by paying a specific attention to the impact of the
conduction regime inside the solids on conduction-radiation coupling. We also
describe how the shape of solids affects this coupling. We show that this
coupling can be at the origin of a drastic change of temperature profiles
inside each body and of heat flux exchanged between them. These results could
have important implications in the fields of nanoscale thermal management,
near-field solid-state cooling and nanoscale energy conversion.

<h3>Material Parameters for Faster Ballistic Switching of an In-plane  Magnetized Nanomagnet</h3>

High-speed magnetization switching of a nanomagnet is necessary for faster
information processing. The ballistic switching by a pulsed magnetic filed is a
promising candidate for the high-speed switching. It is known that the
switching speed of the ballistic switching can be increased by increasing the
magnitude of the pulsed magnetic field. However it is difficult to generate a
strong and short magnetic field pulse in a small device. Here we explore
another direction to achieve the high-speed ballistic switching by designing
material parameters such as anisotropy constant, saturation magnetization, and
the Gilbert damping constant. We perform the macrospin simulations for the
ballistic switching of in-plane magnetized nano magnets with varying material
parameters. The results are analyzed based on the switching dynamics on the
energy density contour. We show that the pulse width required for the ballistic
switching can be reduced by increasing the magnetic anisotropy constant or by
decreasing the saturation magnetization. We also show that there exists an
optimal value of the Gilbert damping constant that minimizes the pulse width
required for the ballistic switching.

<h3>Antibubbles enable tunable payload release with low-intensity ultrasound</h3>

The benefits of ultrasound are its ease-of-use and its ability to precisely
deliver energy or stimuli in opaque and complex media. However, most materials
only show a weak response to ultrasound, and those materials that are
responsive to ultrasound to date require the use of high-powers, which is
associated with undesirable effects such as streaming, cavitation, or
temperature rise. These effects make it difficult to control the response and
may even cause damage to the medium where the ultrasound is applied. Moreover,
materials that are currently in use typically make use of all-or-nothing
effects, limiting the ability to fine-tune the response of the material on the
fly. For these reasons, it would be desirable to identify materials that can
respond to low intensity ultrasound. Here we demonstrate that antibubbles are a
low-intensity-ultrasound-responsive material system that can controllably
release a payload using acoustic pressures in the kPa range. By tuning the size
and composition of the antibubble, the release pressure can be tuned, and the
response can be switched between a single release and stepwise release across
multiple ultrasound pulses. Observations using confocal and high-speed
microscopy revealed the different ways in which antibubbles respond to
ultrasound and release the payload. Our findings lay the groundwork to design
antibubble formulations that controllably respond to low-intensity ultrasound
and thereby open up a wide range of applications ranging from
ultrasound-responsive material systems to advanced contrast agents and carriers
for targeted delivery.

Photo-doped states in strongly correlated charge transfer insulators are
characterized by $d$-$d$ and $d$-$p$ interactions and the resulting intertwined
dynamics of charge excitations and local multiplets. Here we use femtosecond
x-ray absorption spectroscopy in combination with dynamical mean-field theory
to disentangle these contributions in NiO. Upon resonant optical excitation
across the charge transfer gap, the Ni $L_3$ and O $K$ absorption edges
red-shift for $>10$ ps, which is explained by a simultaneous Hartree shift and
a renormalization of the local interactions. Furthermore, below the Ni $L_3$
edge an additional signature is identified for $<1$ ps, which reflects a
transient nonthermal population of local many-body multiplets. Overall, the
photo-doped state differs significantly from a chemically doped state. Our
results demonstrate the ability to reveal excitation pathways in correlated
materials by x-ray spectroscopies, which is relevant for ultrafast materials
design.

<br>
<br>
Functional polymers, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) terminated with a
single phosphonic acid, hereafter PEGik-Ph are often applied to coat metal
oxide surfaces during post synthesis steps, but are not sufficient to stabilize
sub-10 nm particles in protein-rich biofluids. The instability is attributed to
the weak binding affinity of post-grafted phosphonic acid groups, resulting in
a gradual detachment of the polymers the surface. Here, we assess these
polymers as coating agents using an alternative route, namely the one-step
wet-chemical synthesis, where PEGik-Ph is introduced with cerium precursors
during the synthesis. Characterization of the coated cerium oxide nanoparticles
indicates a core-shell structure, where the cores are 3 nm cerium oxide and the
shell consists of functionalized PEG polymers in a brush configuration. Results
show that cerium oxide nanoparticles coated with PEG1k-Ph and PEG2k-Ph are of
potential interest for applications as nanomedicine due to their high Ce(III)
content and increased colloidal stability in cell culture media. We further
demonstrate that the cerium oxide nanoparticles in the presence of hydrogen
peroxide show an additional absorbance band in the UV-vis spectrum, which is
attributed to Ce-O22- peroxo-complexes and could be used in the evaluation of
their catalytic activity for scavenging reactive oxygen species.

Inverse Anderson transitions, where the flat-band localization is destroyed
by disorder, have been wildly investigated in quantum and classical systems in
the presence of Abelian gauge fields. Here, we report the first investigation
on inverse Anderson transitions in the system with non-Abelian gauge fields. It
is found that pseudospin-dependent localized and delocalized eigenstates
coexist in the disordered non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm cage, making inverse
Anderson transitions depend on the relative phase of two internal pseudospins.
Such an exotic phenomenon induced by the interplay between non-Abelian gauge
fields and disorder has no Abelian analogy. Furthermore, we theoretically
design and experimentally fabricate nonAbelian Aharonov-Bohm topolectrical
circuits to observe the non-Abelian inverse Anderson transition. Through the
direct measurements of frequency-dependent impedance responses and voltage
dynamics, the pseudospin-dependent non-Abelian inverse Anderson transitions are
observed. Our results establish the connection between inverse Anderson
transitions and non-Abelian gauge fields, and thus comprise a new insight on
the fundamental aspects of localization in disordered non-Abelian flat-band
systems.

We delineate quantum magnetism in the strongly spin-orbit coupled, distorted
honeycomb-lattice antiferromagnet BiYbGeO$_{5}$. Our magnetization and heat
capacity measurements reveal that its low-temperature behavior is well
described by an effective $J_{\rm eff}=1/2$ Kramers doublet of Yb$^{3+}$. The
ground state is nonmagnetic with a tiny spin gap. Temperature-dependent
magnetic susceptibility, magnetization isotherm, and heat capacity could be
modeled well assuming isolated spin dimers with anisotropic exchange
interactions $J_{\rm Z} \simeq 2.6$~K and $J_{\rm XY} \simeq 1.3$~K. Heat
capacity measurements backed by muon spin relaxation suggest the absence of
magnetic long-range order down to at least 80\,mK both in zero field and in
applied fields. This sets BiYbGeO$_5$ apart from Yb$_2$Si$_2$O$_7$ with its
unusual regime of magnon Bose-Einstein condensation and suggests negligible
interdimer couplings, despite only a weak structural deformation of the
honeycomb lattice.

The formation of ice in the atmosphere affects precipitation and cloud
properties, and plays a key role in the climate of our planet. Although ice can
form directly from liquid water at deeply supercooled conditions, the presence
of foreign particles can aid ice formation at much warmer temperatures. Over
the past decade, experiments have highlighted the remarkable efficiency of
feldspar minerals as ice nuclei compared to other particles present in the
atmosphere. However, the exact mechanism of ice formation on feldspar surfaces
has yet to be fully understood. Here, we develop a first-principles
machine-learning model for the potential energy surface aimed at studying ice
nucleation at microcline feldspar surfaces. The model is able to reproduce with
high fidelity the energies and forces derived from density-functional theory
(DFT) based on the SCAN exchange and correlation functional. We apply the
machine-learning force field to study different fully-hydroxylated terminations
of the (100), (010), and (001) surfaces of microcline exposed to vacuum. Our
calculations suggest that terminations that do not minimize the number of
broken bonds are preferred in vacuum. We also study the structure of
supercooled liquid water in contact with microcline surfaces, and find that
water density correlations extend up to around 1 nm from the surfaces. Finally,
we show that the force field maintains a high accuracy during the simulation of
ice formation at microcline surfaces, even for large systems of around 30,000
atoms. Future work will be directed towards the calculation of nucleation free
energy barriers and rates using the force field developed herein, and
understanding the role of different microcline surfaces on ice nucleation.

<h3>Elementary mechanisms of shear-coupled grain boundary migration for  different complexions of a copper tilt grain boundary</h3>

<br>
<br>
The migration of grain boundaries leads to grain growth in polycrystals and
is one mechanism of grain-boundary-mediated plasticity, especially in metallic
nanocrystals. This migration is due to the movement of dislocation-like
defects, called disconnections, which couple to externally applied shear
stresses. Here, we investigate a $\Sigma$19b symmetric tilt grain boundary
without pre-existing defects using atomistic computer simulations with
classical potentials. This specific grain boundary exhibits two different
atomic structures with different microscopic degrees of freedom (complexions),
called ``domino'' and ``pearl'' complexion. We show that the grain boundary
migration is affected by both the formation energy of a disconnection dipole
and the Peierls-like barrier required to move the disconnections. For the pearl
complexion, the latter is much higher, leading to a high stress required for
grain boundary migration at low temperatures. However, in absolute values, the
Peierls barrier is low and can be overcome by thermal energy even at room
temperature. Since the domino complexion has higher disconnection formation
energies, it is more resistant to migration at room temperature and above.

<br>
Quantum electrodynamics of particles conctrained to move on a plane is not a
fully dimensionally reduced theory because the gauge fields through which they
interact live in higher dimensions. By constraining the gauge field to the
surface of the bulk, we obtain a fully reduced planar Abelian Chern-Simons
Higgs model that can describe the vortex dynamics and second-order
superconducting-normal phase transitions in planar Chern-Simons
superconductors. Dual analyses performed before and after dimensional reduction
yield the same Lagrangian for describing vortex dynamics, indicating the
self-consistency of our reduced theory. Compared to ordinary (2+1)-dimensional
electrodynamics, we obtain anomalous fermion statistical vortices, consistent
with results considering boundary effects. An additional electric charge
constraint and different Chern-Simons parameters constraint are also found,
which may help define a self-dual conformal field theory. Our renormalization
group analysis shows that the quantized critical exponent depends on the
Chern-Simons parameter. Quench disorder can bring more stable fixed points and
can suppress interaction $U$. If we dimensionality reduce to a curved surface,
our theory can also be extended to curved spacetimes, where geometric flow will
be introduced and compete with vortex flow.

<i>Danqing Hu, Jiangfan Wang, Yi-feng Yang</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose an auxiliary-bath algorithm for the numerical renormalization
group (NRG) method to solve multi-impurity models with shared electron baths.
The method allows us to disentangle the electron baths into independent Wilson
chains to perform standard NRG procedures beyond the widely adopted independent
bath approximation. Its application to the 2-impurity model immediately
reproduces the well-known even- and odd-parity channels. For 3-impurity Kondo
models, we find successive screening of collective degrees of freedom such as
the helicity and the cluster spin, and clarify the false prediction of a
non-Fermi liquid ground state in unphysical parameter region in previous
literature due to improper treatment of disentanglement. Our work highlights
the importance of nonlocal spatial correlations due to shared baths and reveals
a generic picture of successive collective screening for the entropy depletion
that is crucial in real correlated systems. Our method greatly expands the
applicability of the NRG and opens an avenue for its further development.

We explore critical field and critical current behavior in inhomogeneous
narrow thin-film superconducting strips. Formulations are developed to
calculate free energy, critical field, and critical current for strips with
inhomogeneous Pearl length distributions. Our findings show that
inhomogeneities, specifically a shorter Pearl length in the middle of the
strip, significantly enhance the critical field $B_{c1}$. This has practical
implications for achieving complete flux expulsion. While narrow strips have
traditionally been considered the most effective approach to improve $B_{c1}$
and eliminate trapped vortices, our results suggest that engineered
inhomogeneities offer an alternative method to enhance $B_{c1}$ and improve
flux expulsion without reducing strip width, providing greater design
flexibility for superconducting devices. Additionally, we find that for the
purpose of increasing the critical current, utilizing an inhomogeneous film
with a reduced Pearl length in the middle of the strip is more advantageous.
The enhancement in critical current arises from the current suppression effect
at the edges induced by the inhomogeneous distribution of superfluid density.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that an inhomogeneous film with a left-right
asymmetric Pearl length distribution enables control over the nonreciprocity of
the critical current, highlighting the potential of engineering inhomogeneous
Pearl length distributions to implement devices exhibiting the superconducting
diode effect. Our results provide concrete examples of how manipulating the
inhomogeneity of Pearl length can enhance the performance of superconducting
devices. Various methods such as doping nonuniform impurities or creating a
temperature gradient can be employed to implement an inhomogeneous Pearl length
distribution.

reported previously is mostly formed near the vacancies, zigzag edges, or
impurities by breaking the local sublattice imbalance, though a bulk chiral
spin-density-wave ground state is also reported at van Hove filling due to its
perfectly nested Fermi surface. Here, combining of the first-principles and
tight-binding model simulations, we predict a robust ferromagnetic domain lies
between the inter-chain carbon atoms inside the zigzag graphene nanoribbons by
applying a potential drop. We show that the effective zigzag edges provide the
strong correlation background through narrowing the band width, while the
internal Van Hove filling provides the strong ferromagnetic background
inherited from the bulk. The induced ferromagnetism exhibit interesting
switching effect when the nominal Van Hove filling crosses the intra- and
inter-chain region by tuning the potential drops. We further observe a robust
half-metallicity transition from one spin channel to another within the same
magnetic phase. These novel properties provide promising ways to manipulate the
spin degree of freedom in graphene nanostructures.

The quantum critical properties of interacting fermions in the presence of
disorder are still not fully understood. While it is well known that for Dirac
fermions, interactions are irrelevant to the non-interacting infinite
randomness fixed point (IRFP), the problem remains largely open in the case of
Majorana fermions which further display a much richer disorder-free phase
diagram. Here, pushing the limits of DMRG simulations, we carefully examine the
ground-state of a Majorana chain with both disorder and interactions. Building
on appropriate boundary conditions and key observables such as entanglement,
energy gap, and correlations, we strikingly find that the non-interacting
Majorana IRFP is very stable against finite interactions, in contrast with
previous claims.

Progress toward a first-principles theory of plasticity and work-hardening is
currently impeded by an insufficient picture of dislocation kinetics (the
dynamic effect of driving forces in a given dislocation theory). This is
because present methods ignore the short-range interaction of dislocations.
This work presents a kinetic theory of continuum dislocation dynamics in a
vector density framework which takes into account the short-range interactions
by means of suitably defined correlation functions. The weak line bundle
ensemble of dislocations is defined, whereby the treatment of dislocations by a
vector density is justified. It is then found by direct averaging of the
dislocation transport equation that additional driving forces arise which are
dependent on the dislocation correlation functions. A combination of spatial
coarse-graining and statistical averaging of discrete dislocation systems are
used to evaluate the various classes of tensorial dislocation correlations
which arise in the kinetic theory. A novel, chiral classification of slip
system interactions in FCC is used to define proper and improper rotations by
which correlation functions corresponding to the six traditional interaction
classifications can be evaluated. The full set of dislocation correlations are
evaluated from discrete data. Only the self-correlations (for densities of like
slip system) are found to be highly anisotropic. All correlation functions are
found to decay within 2-4 times the coarse-graining distance. One type of
interaction (coplanar correlations) are found to be negligible. Implications of
the evaluated correlation functions for the future of vector density continuum
dislocation dynamics are discussed, especially in terms of additional
correlation driving forces and a gesture towards a coarse-grained dislocation
mobility.

We consider the effect of perturbing a single bond on ground-states of
nearest-neighbor Ising spin-glasses, with a Gaussian distribution of the
coupling constants, across various two and three-dimensional lattices and
regular random graphs. Our results reveal that the ground-states are strikingly
susceptible to such changes. Altering the strength of only a single bond beyond
a critical threshold value leads to a new ground-state that differs from the
original one by a droplet of flipped spins whose boundary and volume diverge
with the system size -- an effect that is reminiscent of the more familiar
phenomenon of disorder chaos. These elementary fractal-boundary zero-energy
droplets and their composites feature robust characteristics and provide the
lowest-energy macroscopic spin-glass excitations. Remarkably, within numerical
accuracy, the size of such droplets conforms to a nearly universal power-law
distribution with exponents dependent on the spatial dimension of the system.
Furthermore, the critical coupling strengths adhere to a stretched Gaussian
distribution that is predominantly determined by the local coordination number.

Recent experiments have shown how the interplay between Bose statistics and
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can lead to superfluid liquid crystalline (stripe)
analogues in cold atomic gases. For isotropic SOC in two spatial dimensions, a
Rashba dispersion is encountered where a continuous ring of single-particle
states constitutes a massive ground-state degeneracy. Here, we perform
approximation-free field-theoretic simulations of ensembles of interacting
Rashba bosons and find a spin microemulsion phase with bicontinuous,
antiferromagnetic domains. The microemulsion emerges at elevated temperatures
as the low-temperature stripe phase undergoes a Kosterlitz--Thouless-like
transition and loses superfluidity. Momentum distribution calculations
highlight a thermally broadened occupation of the Rashba circle of low-energy
states with macroscopic and isotropic occupation around the ring. We provide a
finite-temperature phase diagram that positions the emulsion as an
intermediate, structured isotropic phase with residual quantum character before
transitioning at higher temperature into a structureless normal fluid.
