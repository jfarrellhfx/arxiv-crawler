<h3>Emergent Kelvin waves in chiral active matter</h3>

The phenomenological equations of hydrodynamics describe emergent behavior in
many body systems. Their forms and the associated phenomena are well
established when the quiescent state of the system is one of thermodynamic
equilibrium, yet away from equilibrium relatively little is firmly established.
Here, we deduce directly from first principles the hydrodynamic equations for a
system far from equilibrium, a chiral active fluid in which both parity and
time-reversal symmetries are broken. With our theory, we rationalize the
emergence of a spontaneous boundary current in the confined fluid, a feature
forbidden at equilibrium, which allows us to extract estimates of transport
coefficients that we favorably compare to forced flows. The hydrodynamic
solution reveals that the boundary current is analogous to a quasigeostrophic
coastal current, a well known phenomenon in oceanography. Such currents are
conjugate to a class of chiral waves called Kelvin waves. Motivated by this
analogy, we demonstrate that an acoustic chiral Kelvin wave mode also exists in
confined chiral active matter in the absence of an imposed rotation,
originating from the spontaneous emergence of a Coriolis-like parameter in the
bound modes of a chiral fluid.

<h3>Coulomb screening and scattering in atomically thin transistors across  dimensional crossover</h3>

Layered two-dimensional dichalcogenides are potential candidates for
post-silicon electronics. Here, we report insightfully experimental and
theoretical studies on the fundamental Coulomb screening and scattering effects
in these correlated systems, in response to the changes of three crucial
Coulomb factors, including electric permittivity, interaction length, and
density of Coulomb impurities. We systematically collect and analyze the trends
of electron mobility with respect to the above factors, realized by synergic
modulations on channel thicknesses and gating modes in dual-gated MoS2
transistors with asymmetric dielectric cleanliness. Strict configurative form
factors are developed to capture the subtle parametric changes across
dimensional crossover. A full diagram of the carrier scattering mechanisms, in
particular on the pronounced Coulomb scattering, is unfolded. Moreover, we
clarify the presence of up to 40% discrepancy in mobility by considering the
permittivity modification across dimensional crossover. The understanding is
useful for exploiting atomically thin body transistors for advanced
electronics.

<h3>Toward a new theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect: The many-body  spectra and energy gaps at $ν<1$</h3>

In a recent paper (arXiv:2206.05152v4), using the exact diagonalization
technique, I calculated the energy and other physical properties (electron
density, pair correlation function) of a system of $N\le 7$ two-dimensional
electrons at the Landau level filling factor $\nu=1/3$, and showed that the
variational many-body wave function proposed for this filling factor by
Laughlin is far from the true ground state. In this paper I continue to study
exact properties of a small ($N\le 7$) system of two-dimensional electrons
lying on the lowest Landau level. I analyze the energies and electron densities
of the systems with $N\le 7$ electrons continuously as a function of the
magnetic field in the range $1/4\lesssim\nu<1$. The physical mechanisms of the
appearance of energy gaps in many-particle electron spectra are elucidated. The
results obtained clarify the true nature of the ground and excited states of
the considered systems.

Transition metal dichalcogenide superlattices provide an exciting new
platform for exploring and understanding a variety of phases of matter. The
moir\'e continuum Hamiltonian, of two-dimensional jellium in a modulating
potential, provides a fundamental model for such systems. Accurate computations
with this model are essential for interpreting experimental observations and
making predictions for future explorations. In this work, we combine two
complementary quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods, phaseless auxiliary field
quantum Monte Carlo and fixed-phase diffusion Monte Carlo, to study the ground
state of this Hamiltonian. We observe a metal-insulator transition between a
paramagnetic and a $120^\circ$ N\'eel ordered state as the moir\'e potential
depth and the interaction strength are varied. We find significant differences
from existing results by Hartree-Fock and exact diagonalization studies. In
addition, we benchmark density-functional theory, and suggest an optimal hybrid
functional which best approximates our QMC results.

<h3>Bosonization of Non-Fermi Liquids</h3>

Understanding non-Fermi liquids in dimensions higher than one remains one of
the most formidable challenges in modern condensed matter physics. These
systems, characterized by an abundance of gapless degrees of freedom and the
absence of well-defined quasiparticles, defy conventional analytical
frameworks. Inspired by recent work on the bosonization of Fermi surfaces
[Delacretaz, Du, Mehta, and Son, Physical Review Research, 4, 033131 (2022)],
we present a procedure for bosonizing non-Fermi liquids, which provides a
holistic approach capable of addressing their intricate physics. Our method
involves parameterizing the generalized fermionic distribution function through
a bosonic field that describes frequency-dependent local variations of the
chemical potential in momentum space. We propose an effective action that
produces the collisionless quantum Boltzmann equation as its equation of motion
and can straightforwardly be used for any dimension and Fermi surface of
interest. Even at the quadratic order, this action reproduces highly
non-trivial results obtainable only through involved analysis with alternative
means. By offering a comprehensive description of the physics of non-Fermi
liquids, our work stands as an important building block in advancing the
comprehension of strange metals and associated phenomena.

<h3>Self-bound Vortex Lattice in a Rapidly Rotating Quantum Droplet</h3>

A rapidly rotating Bose gas in the quantum Hall limit is usually associated
with a melted vortex lattice. In this work, we report a self-bound and visible
triangular vortex lattice without melting for a two-dimensional Bose-Bose
droplet rotating in the quantum Hall limit, i.e., with rotation frequency
$\Omega$ approaching the trapping frequency $\omega$. Increasing $\Omega$ with
respect to interaction strength $U$, we find a smooth crossover of vortex
lattice droplet from a needling regime, as featured by small vortex cores and
an equilibrium flat-top surface, to the lowest-Landau-level regime with
Gaussian-extended cores spreading over the whole surface. The surface density
of such rotating droplet is higher than that of a static one, and their ratio
is found to be a universal function of $\Omega/U$. We have demonstrated these
results by both numerical and variational methods. The results pave the way for
future experimental exploration of rapidly rotating ultracold droplets into the
quantum Hall limit.

<h3>Topological phase transition revealed by electron waiting times</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14964" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14964</a>
<br>
<i>Paramita Dutta, Jorge Cayao, Annica M. Black-Schaffer, Pablo Burset</i>
<br>
<br>
The analysis of waiting times of electron transfers has recently become
experimentally accessible owing to advances in noninvasive probes working in
the short-time regime. We study electron waiting times in a topological Andreev
interferometer: a superconducting loop with controllable phase difference
connected to a quantum spin Hall edge. The edge state helicity enables the
transfer of electrons and holes into separate leads, with transmission
controlled by the loop's phase difference $\phi$. In this setup, a topological
phase transition with emerging Majorana bound states occurs at $\phi=\pi$. The
waiting times for electron transfers across the junction are sensitive to the
phase transition, but are uncorrelated for all $\phi$. By contrast, in the
topological phase, the waiting times of Andreev-scattered holes show a strong
correlation and the crossed (hole-electron) distributions feature a unique
behavior. Both effects exclusively result from the presence of Majorana bound
states. Consequently, electron waiting times could circumvent some of the
challenges for detecting topological superconductivity and Majorana states
beyond conductance signatures.

<h3>Renormalization Group Analysis of the Anderson Model on Random Regular  Graphs</h3>

<br>
<i>Carlo Vanoni, Boris L. Altshuler, Vladimir E. Kravtsov, Antonello Scardicchio</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a renormalization group analysis of the problem of the Anderson
localization on a Regular Random Graph which generalizes the renormalization
group of Abrahams, Anderson, Licciardello, and Ramakrishnan to
infinite-dimensional graphs. The renormalization group equations necessarily
involve two parameters (one being the changing connectivity of sub-trees), but
we show that the one-parameter scaling hypothesis is recovered for sufficiently
large system sizes for both eigenstates and spectrum observables. We also
explain the non-monotonic behavior of dynamical and spectral quantities as a
function of the system size for values of disorder close to the transition, by
identifying two terms in the beta function of the running fractal dimension of
different signs and functional dependence. Our theory provides the first
coherent explanation for the unusual scaling behaviors observed in numerical
data of the Anderson model and of Many-Body Localization.

<h3>Quantum interference of pseudospin-1 fermions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14967" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14967</a>
<br>
<i>Adesh Singh, G. Sharma</i>
<br>
<br>
Quantum interference is studied in a three-band model of pseudospin-one
fermions in the $\alpha-\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice. We derive a general formula for
magnetoconductivity that predicts a rich crossover between weak localization
(WL) and weak antilocalization (WAL) in various scenarios. Recovering the known
results for graphene ($\alpha=0$), we remarkably discover that WAL is notably
enhanced when one deviates slightly from the graphene lattice, i.e. when
$\alpha>0$, even though Berry's phase is no longer $\pi$. This is attributed to
the presence of multiple Cooperon channels. Upon further increasing $\alpha$, a
crossover to WL occurs that is maximal for the case of the Dice lattice
($\alpha=1$). Our work distinctly underscores the role of non-trivial band
topology in the localization properties of electrons confined to the
two-dimensional $\alpha-\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice.

<h3>Heat Conductance of the Quantum Hall Bulk</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) is the prototypical realization of a
topological state of matter. It emerges from a subtle interplay between
topology, interactions, and disorder. The disorder enables the formation of
localized states in the bulk that stabilize the quantum Hall states with
respect to the magnetic field and carrier density. Still, the details of the
localized states and their contribution to transport remain beyond the reach of
most experimental techniques. Here, we describe an extensive study of the
bulk's heat conductance. Using a novel 'multi-terminal' device, we separate the
longitudinal thermal conductance (due to bulk's contribution) $\kappa_{xx}T$
from the two-terminal value $\kappa_{2T}T$, by eliminating the contribution of
the edge modes. We find that when the field is tuned away from the conductance
plateau center, the electronic states of the bulk conduct heat efficiently
while the bulk remains electrically insulating. For fragile fractional states,
such as the non-Abelian $\nu=5/2$, we observe a finite $\kappa_{xx}T$
throughout the plateau. We identify the localized states as the cause of the
finite $\kappa_{xx}T$ and propose a theoretical model which qualitatively
explains our findings.

<h3>Hot hole transport and noise phenomena in silicon at cryogenic  temperatures from first principles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14986" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14986</a>
<br>
<i>David S. Catherall, Austin J. Minnich</i>
<br>
<br>
The transport properties of hot holes in silicon at cryogenic temperatures
exhibit several anomalous features, including the emergence of two distinct
saturated drift velocity regimes and a non-monotonic trend of the current noise
versus electric field at microwave frequencies. Despite prior investigations,
these features lack generally accepted explanations. Here, we examine the
microscopic origin of these phenomena by extending a recently developed
ab-initio theory of high-field transport and noise in semiconductors. We find
that the drift velocity anomaly may be attributed to scattering dominated by
acoustic phonon emission, leading to an additional regime of drift velocity
saturation at temperatures $\sim 40$ K for which the acoustic phonon occupation
is negligible; while the non-monotonic trend in the current noise arises due to
the decrease in momentum relaxation time with electric field. The former
conclusion is consistent with the findings of prior work, but the latter
distinctly differs from previous explanations. This work highlights the use of
high-field transport and noise phenomena as sensitive probes of microscopic
charge transport phenomena in semiconductors.

<h3>Topological triple phase transition in non-Hermitian quasicrystals with  complex asymmetric hopping</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14987" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14987</a>
<br>
<i>Shaina Gandhi, Jayendra N. Bandyopadhyay</i>
<br>
<br>
The triple phase transitions or simultaneous transitions of three different
phases, namely topological, parity-time (PT) symmetry breaking, and
metal-insulator transitions, are observed in an extension of PT symmetric
non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model. In this model, besides non-Hermitian
complex quasi-periodic onsite potential, non-Hermiticity is also included in
the nearest-neighbor hopping terms. Moreover, the nearest-neighbor hopping
terms is also quasi-periodic. The presence of two non-Hermitian parameters, one
from the onsite potential and another one from the hopping part, ensures PT
symmetry transition in the system. In addition, tuning these two non-Hermitian
parameters, we identify a parameters regime, where we observe the triple phase
transition. Following some recent studies, an electrical circuit based
experimental realization of this model is also discussed.

<h3>Quantifying the Topology of Magnetic Skyrmions in three Dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15003" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15003</a>
<br>
<i>David Raftrey, Simone Finizio, Rajesh V. Chopdekar, Scott Dhuey, Temuujin Bayaraa, Paul Ashby, Jörg Raabe, Tiffany Santos, Sinéad Griffin, Peter Fischer</i>
<br>
<br>
Magnetic skyrmions have so far been treated as two-dimensional spin
structures characterized by a topological winding number describing the
rotation of spins across the skyrmion. However, in real systems with a finite
thickness of the material being larger than the magnetic exchange length, the
skyrmion spin texture extends into the third dimension and cannot be assumed as
homogeneous. Using soft x-ray laminography we reconstruct with about 20nm
spatial (voxel) resolution the full three-dimensional spin texture of a
skyrmion in an 800 nm diameter and 95 nm thin disk patterned into a trilayer
[Ir/Co/Pt] thin film structure. A quantitative analysis finds that the
evolution of the radial profile of the topological skyrmion number and the
chirality is non-uniform across the thickness of the disk. Estimates of local
micromagnetic energy densities suggest that the changes in topological profile
are related to non-uniform competing energetic interactions. Theoretical
calculations and micromagnetic simulations are consistent with the experimental
findings. Our results provide the foundation for nanoscale magnetic metrology
for future tailored spintronics devices using topology as a design parameter,
and have the potential to reverse-engineer a spin Hamiltonian from macroscopic
data, tying theory more closely to experiment.

<h3>Particle-Based Simulations of Electrophoretic Deposition with Adaptive  Physics Models</h3>

<br>
<i>John J. Karnes, Andrew J. Pascall, Christoph Rehbock, Vaijayanthi Ramesh, Marcus A. Worsley, Stephan Barcikowski, Elaine Lee, Brian Giera</i>
<br>
<br>
This work represents an extension of mesoscale particle-based modeling of
electrophoretic deposition (EPD), which has relied exclusively on pairwise
interparticle interactions described by Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO)
theory. With this standard treatment, particles continuously move and interact
via excluded volume and electrostatic pair potentials under the influence of
external fields throughout the EPD process. The physics imposed by DLVO theory
may not be appropriate to describe all systems, considering the vast material,
operational, and application space available to EPD. As such, we present three
modifications to standard particle-based models, each rooted in the ability to
dynamically change interparticle interactions as simulated deposition
progresses. This approach allows simulations to capture charge transfer and/or
irreversible adsorption based on tunable parameters. We evaluate and compare
simulated deposits formed under new physical assumptions, demonstrating the
range of systems that these adaptive physics models may capture.

<h3>Origin of Charge Density Wave in Topological Semimetals SrAl4 and EuAl4</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15068" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15068</a>
<br>
<i>Lin-Lin Wang, Niraj K. Nepal, Paul C. Canfield</i>
<br>
<br>
Topological semimetals in BaAl4-type structure have shown many interesting
behaviors, such as charge density wave (CDW) in SrAl4 and EuAl4, but not the
isostructural and isovalent BaAl4, SrGa4 and BaGa4, although they all host
Dirac points and nodal line Dirac-like dispersion. Here using Wannier functions
based on density functional theory, we have calculated the susceptibility
functions with millions of k-points to reach the small q-vector and study the
origin and driving force behind the CDW. Our comparative study reveals that the
origin of the CDW in SrAl4 and EuAl4 is the strong electron-phonon coupling
interaction for the transverse acoustic mode at small q-vector along the
{\Gamma}-Z direction besides the maximum of the real part of the susceptibility
function from the nested Fermi surfaces of the Dirac-like bands, which explains
well the absence of CDW in the other three closely related compounds in a good
agreement with experiment.

<h3>Comment on newly found Charge Density Waves in infinite layer Nickelates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15086" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15086</a>
<br>
<i>J. Pelliciari, N. Khan, P. Wasik, A. Barbour, Y.Li, Y. Nie, J. M. Tranquada, V. Bisogni, C. Mazzoli</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent works[1-3] reported evidence for charge density waves (CDWs) in
infinite layer nickelates (112 structure) based on resonant diffraction at the
Ni $L_3$ edge measured at fixed scattering angle. We have found that a
measurement with fixed momentum transfer, rather than scattering angle, does
not show a resonance effect. We have also observed that a nearby structural
Bragg peak from the substrate appears due to third harmonic content of the
incident beam, and spreads intensity down to the region of the attributed CDW
order. This was further confirmed by testing a bare substrate. We suggest
procedures to confirm an effective resonant enhancement of a diffraction peak.

<h3>Anisotropic molecular diffusion in confinement II: A model for  structurally complex particles applied to transport in thin ionic liquid  films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15094" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15094</a>
<br>
<i>Kevin Höllring, Andreas Baer, Nataša Vučemilović-Alagić, David M. Smith, Ana-Sunčana Smith</i>
<br>
<br>
Hypothesis:Diffusion in confinement is an important fundamental problem with
significant implications for applications of supported liquid phases. However,
resolving the spatially dependent diffusion coefficient, parallel and
perpendicular to interfaces, has been a standing issue and for objects of
nanometric size, which structurally fluctuate on a similar time scale as they
diffuse, no methodology has been established so far. We hypothesise that the
complex, coupled dynamics can be captured and analysed by using a model built
on the $2$-dimensional Smoluchowski equation and systematic coarse-graining.
Methods and simulations: For large, flexible species, a universal approach is
offered that does not make any assumptions about the separation of time scales
between translation and other degrees of freedom. The method is validated on
Molecular Dynamics simulations of bulk systems of a family of ionic liquids
with increasing cation sizes where internal degrees of freedom have little to
major effects.
Findings: After validation on bulk liquids, where we provide an
interpretation of two diffusion constants for each species found
experimentally, we clearly demonstrate the anisotropic nature of diffusion
coefficients at interfaces. Spatial variations in the diffusivities relate to
interface-induced structuring of the ionic liquids. Notably, the length scales
in strongly confined ionic liquids vary consistently but differently at the
solid-liquid and liquid-vapour interfaces.

<br>
<br>
We show that the spontaneous emission rate of the interlayer excitons in a
twisted WSe2-MoSe2 heterobilayer can be precisely tailored in a low-temperature
open optical microcavity via the Purcell effect. We engineer the local density
of optical states in our resonator structures in two complementary experimental
settings. In the first approach, we utilize an ultra-low quality factor planar
vertical cavity structure, which develops multiple longitudinal modes that can
be consecutively brought to resonance with the broad interlayer exciton
spectrum of our heterostructure. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements
reveal that the interlayer exciton lifetime can thus be periodically tuned with
an amplitude of around 100 ps. The resulting oscillations of the exciton
lifetime allows us to extract a free-space radiative exciton lifetime of 2.2 ns
and an approximately 15 % quantum efficiency of the interlayer excitons. We
subsequently engineered the local density of optical states by introducing a
spatially confined and fully spectrally tunable Tamm-plasmon resonance. The
dramatic redistribution of the local optical modes in this setting allows us to
encounter a profound inhibition of spontaneous emission of the interlayer
excitons by a factor of 3.3. Our results will further boost the cavity-mediated
collective emission phenomena such as super-radiance. We expect that
specifically engineering the inhibition of radiation from moire excitons is a
powerful tool to steer their thermalization, and eventually their condensation
into coherent condensate phases.

<br>
<br>
We introduce a system of bacteria confined to a finite 2D oil-water interface
and driven on two distinct time scales by motility and by growth. The combined
effect of activity on different time scales creates transitions between several
common collective behaviors. These transitions are observed using time-lapse
microscopy with high spatial and temporal resolution over eight hours. We
sequentially observe an initial dilute state, a clustered state, an active
turbulent state, and a glassy state, and we are able to directly observe and
characterize the transitions between these states. This system allows the
investigation of emergent effects surrounding transitions between phases,
expanding on studies that have considered them in isolation. In particular, a
peak in the velocity correlation length is observed at the turbulent-glassy
transition, suggesting that this transition significantly increases the active
turbulent length scale.

The capability to finely tailor material thickness with simultaneous atomic
precision and non-invasivity would be useful for constructing quantum platforms
and post-Moore microelectronics. However, it remains challenging to attain
synchronized controls over tailoring selectivity and precision. Here we report
a protocol that allows for non-invasive and atomically digital etching of van
der Waals transition-metal dichalcogenides through selective alloying via
low-temperature thermal diffusion and subsequent wet etching. The mechanism of
selective alloying between sacrifice metal atoms and defective or pristine
dichalcogenides is analyzed with high-resolution scanning transmission electron
microscopy. Also, the non-invasive nature and atomic level precision of our
etching technique are corroborated by consistent spectral, crystallographic and
electrical characterization measurements. The low-temperature charge mobility
of as-etched MoS$_2$ reaches up to $1200\,$cm$^{2}\cdot$V$^{-1}\cdot$s$^{-1}$,
comparable to that of exfoliated pristine counterparts. The entire protocol
represents a highly precise and non-invasive tailoring route for material
manipulation.

Ring-shaped REBa2Cu3Oy melt-textured bulks have been successfully grown by
the Single-Direction Melt Growth (SDMG) method, which enables the direct
fabrication of uniform bulks with high reproducibility. Three homogeneous
DyBa2Cu3Oy ring-bulks with various sizes were synthesized in this study. All of
these bulks exhibited concentrically cone-shaped trapped field distribution on
the surface and high trapped field more than 1.8 T at 77 K inside the ring, the
highest among bulks of comparable size to date. Furthermore, superconducting
properties such as superconducting transitions and critical current densities
are highly uniform throughout the bulk, confirming the effectiveness of the
SDMG approach. Our findings represent a significant advancement in the direct
fabrication of high-quality ring-shaped REBCO bulks suitable for high magnetic
field applications, in particular, compact nuclear magnetic resonance systems.

We explore the role of interfacial antiferromagnetic interaction in coupled
soft and hard ferromagnetic layers to ascribe the complex variety of
magneto-transport phenomena observed in $La_{0.7}Sr_{0.3}MnO_3/SrRuO_3$
(LSMO/SRO) superlattices (SLs) within a one-band double exchange model using
Monte-Carlo simulations. Our calculations incorporate the magneto-crystalline
anisotropy interactions and super-exchange interactions of the constituent
materials, and two types of antiferromagnetic interactions between Mn and Ru
ions at the interface: (i) carrier-driven and (ii) Mn-O-Ru bond super-exchange
in the model Hamiltonian to investigate the properties along the hysteresis
loop. We find that the antiferromagnetic coupling at the interface induces the
LSMO and SRO layers to align in anti-parallel orientation at low temperatures.
Our results reproduce the positive exchange bias of the minor loop and inverted
hysteresis loop of LSMO/SRO SL at low temperatures as reported in experiments.
In addition, conductivity calculations show that the carrier-driven
antiferromagnetic coupling between the two ferromagnetic layers steers the SL
towards a metallic (insulating) state when LSMO and SRO are aligned in
anti-parallel (parallel) configuration, in good agreement with the experimental
data. This demonstrate the necessity of carrier-driven antiferromagnetic
interactions at the interface to understand the one-to-one correlation between
the magnetic and transport properties observed in experiments. For high
temperature, just below the ferromagnetic $T_C$ of SRO, we unveiled the
unconventional three-step flipping process along the magnetic hysteresis loop.
We emphasize the key role of interfacial antiferromagnetic coupling between
LSMO and SRO to understand these multiple-step flipping processes along the
hysteresis loop.

Classical stochastic Conway Game of Life is expressed by the dissipative
Schr\"odinger equation and dissipative tight-binding model. This is conducted
at the prize of usage of time dependent anomalous non-Hermitian Hamiltonians as
with occurrence of complex value potential that do not preserve the
normalization of wave-function and thus allows for mimicking creationism or
annihilationism of cellular automaton. Simply saying time-dependent complex
value eigenenergies are similar to complex values of resonant frequencies in
electromagnetic resonant cavities reflecting presence of dissipation that
reflects energy leaving the system or being pumped into the system. At the same
time various aspects of thermodynamics were observed in cellular automata that
can be later reformulated by quantum mechanical pictures. The usage of Shannon
entropy and mass equivalence to energy points definition of cellular automata
temperature. Contrary to intuitive statement the system dynamical equilibrium
is always reflected by negative temperatures. Diffusion of mass, energy and
temperature as well as phase of proposed wave function is reported and can be
directly linked with second thermodynamics law approximately valid for the
system, where neither mass nor energy is conserved. The concept of
complex-valued mass mimics wave-function behavior. Equivalence an anomalous
second Fick law and dissipative Schr\"odinger equation is given. Dissipative
Conway Game of Life tight-binding Hamiltonian is given using phenomenological
justification.

<br>
<br>
Stimulated by a recent report of a giant magnetocaloric effect in HoB$_2$
found via machine-learning predictions, we have explored the magnetocaloric
properties of a related compound ErB$_2$, that has remained the last
ferromagnetic material among the rare-earth diboride (REB$_2$) family with
unreported magnetic entropy change |{\Delta}SM|. The evaluated $|\Delta S_M|$
at field change of 5 T in ErB$_2$ turned out to be as high as 26.1 (J kg$^{-1}$
K$^{-1}$) around the ferromagnetic transition (${T_C}$) of 14 K. In this
series, HoB$_2$ is found to be the material with the largest $|\Delta S_M|$ as
the model predicted, while the predicted values showed a deviation with a
systematic error compared to the experimental values. Through a coalition
analysis using SHAP, we explore how this rare-earth dependence and the
deviation in the prediction are deduced in the model. We further discuss how
SHAP analysis can be useful in clarifying favorable combinations of constituent
atoms through the machine-learned model with compositional descriptors. This
analysis helps us to perform materials design with aid of machine learning of
materials data.

<h3>Ferromagnetically ordered states in the Hubbard model on the $H_{00}$  hexagonal golden-mean tiling</h3>

<i>Toranosuke Matsubara, Akihisa Koga, Sam Coates</i>
<br>
<br>
We study magnetic properties of the half-filled Hubbard model on the
two-dimensional $H_{00}$ hexagonal golden-mean quasiperiodic tiling. The tiling
is composed of large and small hexagons, and parallelograms, and its vertex
model is bipartite with a sublattice imbalance. The tight-binding model on the
tiling has macroscopically degenerate states at $E = 0$. We find the existence
of two extended states in one of the sublattices, in addition to confined
states in the other. This property is distinct from that of the well-known
two-dimensional quasiperiodic tilings such as the Penrose and Ammann-Beenker
tilings. Applying the Lieb theorem to the Hubbard model on the tiling, we
obtain the exact fraction of the confined states as $1/2\tau^2$, where $\tau$
is the golden mean. This leads to a ferromagnetically ordered state in the weak
coupling limit. Increasing the Coulomb interaction, the staggered magnetic
moments are induced and gradually increase. Crossover behaviour in the
magnetically ordered states is also addressed in terms of perpendicular space
analysis.

<h3>Crystal structure and magnetic properties of spin-$1/2$ frustrated  two-leg ladder compounds (C$_4$H$_{14}$N$_2$)Cu$_2X_6$ ($X$= Cl and Br)</h3>

We have successfully synthesized single crystals, solved the crystal
structure, and studied the magnetic properties of a new family of copper
halides (C$_4$H$_{14}$N$_2$)Cu$_2X_6$ ($X$= Cl, Br). These compounds
crystallize in an orthorhombic crystal structure with space group $Pnma$. The
crystal structure features Cu$^{2+}$ dimers arranged parallel to each other
that makes a zig-zag two-leg ladder-like structure. Further, there exists a
diagonal interaction between two adjacent dimers which generates inter-dimer
frustration. Both the compounds manifest a singlet ground state with a large
gap in the excitation spectrum. Magnetic susceptibility is analyzed in terms of
both interacting spin-$1/2$ dimer and two-leg ladder models followed by exact
diagonalization calculations. Our theoretical calculations in conjunction with
the experimental magnetic susceptibility establish that the spin-lattice can be
described well by a frustrated two-leg ladder model with strong rung coupling
($J_0/k_{\rm B} \simeq 116$ K and 300 K), weak leg coupling
($J^{\prime\prime}/k_{\rm B} \simeq 18.6$ K and 105 K), and equally weak
diagonal coupling ($J^{\prime }/k_{\rm B} \simeq 23.2$ K and 90 K) for Cl and
Br compounds, respectively. These exchange couplings set the critical fields
very high, making them experimentally inaccessible. The correlation function
decays exponentially as expected for a gapped spin system. The structural
aspects of both the compounds are correlated with their magnetic properties.
The calculation of entanglement witness divulges strong entanglement in both
the compounds which persists upto high temperatures, even beyond 370~K for the
Br compound.

The capability to reach ultracold atomic temperatures in compact instruments
has recently been extended into space. Ultracold temperatures amplify quantum
effects, while free-fall allows further cooling and longer interactions time
with gravity - the final force without a quantum description. On Earth, these
devices have produced macroscopic quantum phenomena such as Bose-Einstein
condensation (BECs), superfluidity, and strongly interacting quantum gases.
Quantum sensors interfering the superposition of two ultracold atomic isotopes
have tested the Universality of Free Fall (UFF), a core tenet of Einstein's
classical gravitational theory, at the $10^{-12}$ level. In space, cooling the
elements needed to explore the rich physics of strong interactions and
preparing the multiple species required for quantum tests of the UFF has
remained elusive. Here, utilizing upgraded capabilities of the multi-user Cold
Atom Lab (CAL) instrument within the International Space Station (ISS), we
report the first simultaneous production of a dual species Bose-Einstein
condensate in space (formed from $^{87}$Rb and $^{41}$K), observation of
interspecies interactions, as well as the production of $^{39}$K ultracold
gases. We have further achieved the first space-borne demonstration of
simultaneous atom interferometry with two atomic species ($^{87}$Rb and
$^{41}$K). These results are an important step towards quantum tests of UFF in
space, and will allow scientists to investigate aspects of few-body physics,
quantum chemistry, and fundamental physics in novel regimes without the
perturbing asymmetry of gravity.

<h3>Quantum spin fluctuations in dynamical quantum phase transitions</h3>

Quantum phase transitions have long been studied in their relation to quantum
fluctuations. These fluctuations can be quantified as the degree of spin
squeezing in spin models, where one of the two non-commutative observables
breaks the standard quantum limit of measurement by minimizing its uncertainty.
However, the understanding of their role in dynamical quantum phase transitions
(DQPTs) is still incomplete. In this work, we combine the Loschmidt amplitude,
which detects DQPTs, and the spin-squeezing parameter (SSP), the quantification
of spin squeezing, to study the spin dynamics in a quenched interacting spin
model around DQPT. We show that the extremal, mostly maximal, of SSP occurs
near DQPTs when the system is quenched between different phases. These
phenomena further unveil the spin correlations during DQPTs, for which the
highest contribution aligns with the preferred direction of spin interactions
in the post-quenched phase. We also demonstrate the time evolution of SSP
differs for various quench scenarios. These findings provide us with physical
insights into the dynamics of quantum fluctuations around DQPTs and their
relation to the equilibrium phase diagrams.

<h3>Towards Stirling engine using an optically confined particle subjected  to asymmetric temperature profile</h3>

The realization of microscopic heat engines has gained a surge of research
interest in statistical physics, soft matter, and biological physics. A typical
microscopic heat engine employs a colloidal particle trapped in a confining
potential, which is modulated in time to mimic the cycle operations. Here, we
use a lanthanide-doped upconverting particle (UCP) suspended in a passive
aqueous bath, which is highly absorptive at 975 nm and converts NIR photons to
visible, as the working substance of the engine. When a single UCP is optically
trapped with a 975 nm laser, it behaves like an active particle by executing
motion subjected to an asymmetric temperature profile along the direction of
propagation of the laser. The strong absorption of 975 nm light by the particle
introduces a temperature gradient and results in significant thermophoretic
diffusion along the temperature gradient. However, the activity of the particle
vanishes when the trapping wavelength is switched to 1064 nm. We carefully
regulate the wavelength-dependent activity of the particle to engineer all four
cycles of a Stirling engine by using a combination of 1064 nm and 975 nm
wavelengths. Since the motion of the particle is stochastic, the work done on
the particle due to the stiffness modulation per cycle is random. We provide
statistical estimation for this work averaged over 5 cycles which can be
extended towards several cycles to make a Stirling engine. Our experiment
proposes a robust set-up to systematically harness temperature which is a
crucial factor behind building microscopic engines.

Now-a-days, the development of clean and green energy sources is the prior
interest of research due to increasing global energy demand and extensive usage
of fossil fuels that create pollutants. Hydrogen has the highest energy density
by weight among all chemical fuels. For the commercial-scale production of
hydrogen, water electrolysis is the best method which in turn requires an
efficient, cost-effective and earth-abundant electrocatalyst. Recent studies
have shown that the 2D Janus TMDs are highly effective in the electrocatalytic
activity for HER. Herein we report a 2D monolayer WSeTe Janus TMD
electrocatalyst for HER. We studied the electronic properties of 2D monolayer
WSeTe Janus TMD using periodic DFT calculations, and the direct electronic band
gap was obtained to be 2.39 eV. After the calculations of electronic
properties, we explored the HER intermediates including various transition
state structures (Volmer TS, Heyrovsky TS, and Tafel TS) using a molecular
cluster model of WSeTe noted as W10Se9Te12. The present calculations revealed
that the 2D monolayer WSeTe Janus TMD is a potential electrocatalyst for HER.
It has the lowest energy barriers for all the TSs among other TMDs, such as
MoS2, Mn-MoS2, MoSSe, etc. The calculated Heyrovsky energy barrier (= 8.72
kcal.mol-1) for the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism is larger than the Tafel energy
barrier (=3.27 kcal.mol-1) in the Volmer-Tafel mechanism. Hence our present
study suggests that the formation of H2 is energetically more favorable via the
Vomer-Tafel mechanism. This work helps shed light on the rational design of
effective HER catalysts.

The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy production cannot be
negative. Recent developments of uncertainty relations in stochastic
thermodynamics, such as thermodynamic uncertainty relations and speed limits,
have conferred refined second laws, which provide lower bounds of the entropy
production by incorporating information of current statistics or distributions.
In this work, in contrast, we bound the entropy production from above by terms
consisting of the dynamical activity and the maximum transition rate ratio. We
derive two upper bounds: one applies to steady-state conditions, while the
other applies to arbitrary time-dependent conditions. We verify these bounds
through numerical simulations and identify several potential applications.

<h3>Platinum-absorbed Defective 2D Monolayer Boron Nitride: A Promising  Electrocatalyst for O2 Reduction Reaction</h3>

The large bandgap and strong covalent bonds of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)
had long been thought to be chemically inert. Due to its inertness with
saturated robust covalent bonds, the pristine 2D monolayer hBN cannot be
functionalized for applications of energy conversion. Therefore, it is
necessary to make the 2D hBN chemically reactive for potential applications.
Here, we have computationally designed a single nitrogen (N) and boron (B)
di-vacancy of the 2D monolayer hBN, noted by VBN defective-BN (d-BN), to
activate the chemical reactivity, which is an effective strategy to use the
d-BN for potential applications. Single Pt atom absorbed on the defective area
of the VBN d-BN acts as a single-atom catalyst which exhibits distinctive
performances for O2 reduction reaction (ORR). First-principles based
dispersion-corrected periodic hybrid Density Functional Theory (DFT-D) method
has been employed to investigate the equilibrium structure and properties of
the Pt-absorbed 2D defective boron nitride (Pt-d-BN). The present study shows
the semiconducting character of Pt-d-BN with an electronic bandgap of 1.30 eV,
which is an essential aspect of the ORR. The ORR mechanism on the surface of 2D
monolayer Pt-d-BN follows a 4e-reduction route because of the low barriers to
OOH formation and dissociation, H2O2 instability and water production at the
Pt-d-BN surface. Here, both the dissociative and associative ORR mechanisms
have been investigated, and it is found that results for both mechanisms with
the ORR pathways are almost equally favorable. Therefore, it can be mentioned
here that the 2D monolayer Pt-d-BN exhibits a high selectivity for the
four-electron reduction pathway. According to the calculations of the relative
adsorption energy of each step in ORR, the Pt-d-BN is anticipated to exhibit
substantial catalytic activity.

Interfacial thermal resistance arises challenges for the thermal management
as the modern semiconductors are miniatured to nanoscale. Previous studies
found that graded mass distribution in interface can maximumly enhance the
interfacial thermal conductance of crystalline interface, however, whether this
strategy is effective for amorphous interface is less explored. In this work,
graded mass distribution in the amorphous interface between crystalline Si and
crystalline Ge is optimized to increase the interfacial thermal conductance by
the extended atomistic Greens function method.

Synchronization is a widespread phenomenon encountered in many natural and
engineered systems with nonlinear classical dynamics. How synchronization
concepts and mechanisms transfer to the quantum realm and whether features are
universal or platform specific are timely questions of fundamental interest.
Here, we present a new approach to model incoherently driven dissipative
quantum systems susceptible to synchronization within the framework of
Josephson photonics devices, where a dc-biased Josephson junction creates
(non-classical) light in a microwave cavity. The combined quantum compound
constitutes a self-sustained oscillator with a neutrally stable phase. Linking
current noise to the full counting statistics of photon emission allows us to
capture phase diffusion, but moreover permits phase locking to an ac-signal and
mutual synchronization of two such devices. Thereby one can observe phase
stabilization leading to a sharp emission spectrum as well as unique photon
emission statistics revealing shot noise induced phase slips. Two-time
perturbation theory is used to obtain a reduced description of the oscillators
phase dynamics in form of a Fokker-Planck equation in generalization of
classical synchronization theories.

<h3>Closest Wannier functions to a given set of localized orbitals</h3>

<br>
<br>
A non-iterative method is presented to calculate the closest Wannier
functions (CWFs) to a given set of localized guiding functions, such as atomic
orbitals, hybrid atomic orbitals, and molecular orbitals, based on minimization
of a distance measure function. It is shown that the minimization is directly
achieved by a polar decomposition of a projection matrix via singular value
decomposition, making iterative calculations and complications arising from the
choice of the gauge irrelevant. The disentanglement of bands is inherently
addressed by introducing a smoothly varying window function and a greater
number of Bloch functions, even for isolated bands. In addition to atomic and
hybrid atomic orbitals, we introduce embedded molecular orbitals in molecules
and bulks as the guiding functions, and demonstrate that the Wannier
interpolated bands accurately reproduce the targeted conventional bands of a
wide variety of systems including Si, Cu, the TTF-TCNQ molecular crystal, and a
topological insulator of Bi$_2$Se$_3$. We further show the usefulness of the
proposed method in calculating effective atomic charges. These numerical
results not only establish our proposed method as an efficient alternative for
calculating WFs, but also suggest that the concept of CWFs can serve as a
foundation for developing novel methods to analyze electronic structures and
calculate physical properties.

Microscopy images are usually analyzed qualitatively or manually and there is
a need for autonomous quantitative analysis of objects. In this paper, we
present a physics-based computational model for accurate segmentation and
geometrical analysis of one-dimensional irregular and deformable objects from
microscopy images. This model, named Nano1D, has four steps of preprocessing,
segmentation, separating overlapped objects and geometrical measurements. The
model is tested on Ag nanowires, and successfully segments and analyzes their
geometrical characteristics including length, width and distributions. The
function of the algorithm is not undermined by the size, number, density,
orientation and overlapping of objects in images. The main strength of the
model is shown to be its ability to segment and analyze overlapping objects
successfully with more than 99% accuracy, while current machine learning and
computational models suffer from inaccuracy and inability to segment
overlapping objects. Nano1D can analyze one-dimensional (1D) nanoparticles
including nanowires, nanotubes, nanorods in addition to other 1D features of
microstructures like microcracks, dislocations etc.

Efficient and sustainable techniques for separating water-methanol mixtures
are in high demand in the industry. Recent studies have revealed that membranes
and 2D materials could achieve such separation. In our research, we explore the
impact of a nanoconfining graphene slit-pore on the dynamics and structure of
water-methanol mixtures. By Molecular Dynamics simulations of a coarse-grained
model for water mixtures containing up to 25% methanol, we show that, for
appropriate pore sizes, water tends to occupy the center of the pore. In
contrast, methanol's apolar moiety accumulates near the hydrophobic walls.
Additionally, modifying the pore's width leads to a non-monotonic change in the
diffusivity of each component. However, water always diffuses faster than
methanol, implying that it should be possible to identify an optimal
configuration for water-methanol separation based on physical mechanisms. Our
calculations indicate that one of the more effective pore sizes, 12.5{\AA}, is
also mechanically stable, minimizing the energy cost of a possible filtering
membrane.

Resistivity measurements are widely exploited to uncover electronic
excitations and phase transitions in metallic solids. While single crystals are
preferably studied to explore crystalline anisotropies, these usually cancel
out in polycrystalline materials. Here we show that in polycrystalline
Mn3Zn0.5Ge0.5N with non-collinear antiferromagnetic order, changes in the
diagonal and, rather unexpected, off-diagonal components of the resistivity
tensor occur at low temperatures indicating subtle transitions between magnetic
phases of different symmetry. This is supported by neutron scattering and
explained within a phenomenological model which suggests that the phase
transitions in magnetic field are associated with field induced topological
orbital momenta. The fact that we observe transitions between spin phases in a
polycrystal, where effects of crystalline anisotropy are cancelled suggests
that they are only controlled by exchange interactions. The observation of an
off-diagonal resistivity extends the possibilities for realising
antiferromagnetic spintronics with polycrystalline materials.

Defects in the lattice are of primal importance to tune graphene chemical,
thermal and electronic properties. Electron-beam irradiation is an easy method
to induce defects in graphene following pre-designed patterns, but no
systematic study of the time evolution of the resulting defects is available.
In this paper, the change over time of defected sites created in graphene with
low-energy ($\leq 20$ keV) electron irradiation is studied both experimentally
via micro-Raman spectroscopy for a period of $6\times 10^3$ hours and through
molecular dynamics simulations. During the first 10 h, the structural defects
are stable at the highest density value. Subsequently, the crystal partially
reconstructs, eventually reaching a stable, less defected condition after more
than one month. The simulations allow the rationalization of the processes at
the atomic level and confirm that the irradiation induces composite clusters of
defects of different nature rather than well-defined nanoholes as in the case
of high-energy electrons. The presented results identify the timescale of the
defects stability, thus establishing the operability timespan of engineerable
defect-rich graphene devices with applications in nanoelectronics. Moreover,
long-lasting chemical reactivity of the defective graphene is pointed out. This
property can be exploited to functionalize graphene for sensing and energy
storage applications.

The non-equilibrium dynamics of domain wall initial states in a classical
anisotropic Heisenberg chain exhibits a striking coexistence of apparently
linear and non-linear behaviours: the propagation and spreading of the domain
wall can be captured quantitatively by \textit{linear}, i.e. non-interacting,
spin wave theory absent its usual justifications; while, simultaneously, for a
wide range of easy-plane anisotropies, emission can take place of stable
topological solitons -- a process and objects intrinsically associated with
interactions and non-linearities. The easy-axis domain wall only has transient
dynamics, the isotropic one broadens diffusively, while the easy-plane one
yields a pair of ballistically counter-propagating domain walls which,
unusually, broaden \textit{subdiffusively}, their width scaling as $t^{1/3}$.

We study the effect of electric stress, gas pressure and gas type on the
hysteresis in the transfer characteristics of monolayer molybdenum disulfide

the MoS2 crystal structure facilitates the adsorption of oxygen, nitrogen,
hydrogen or methane, which strongly affect the transistor electrical
characteristics. Although the gas adsorption does not modify the conduction
type, we demonstrate a correlation between hysteresis width and adsorption
energy onto the MoS2 surface. We show that hysteresis is controllable by
pressure and/or gas type. Hysteresis features two well-separated current
levels, especially when gases are stably adsorbed on the channel, which can be
exploited in memory devices.

<br>
Electron-photon temporal correlations in electron energy loss (EELS) and
cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopies have recently been used to measure the
relative quantum efficiency of materials. This combined spectroscopy, named
Cathodoluminescence excitation spectroscopy (CLE), allows the identification of
excitation and decay channels which are hidden in average measurements. Here,
we demonstrate that CLE can also be used to measure excitation's decay time. In
addition, the decay time as a function of the excitation energy is accessed, as
the energy for each electron-photon pair is probed. We used two well-known
insulating materials to characterize this technique, nanodiamonds with
\textit{NV$^0$} defect emission and h-BN with a \textit{4.1 eV} defect
emission. Both also exhibit marked transition radiations, whose extremely short
decay times can be used to characterize the instrumental response function. It
is found to be typically 2 ns, in agreement with the expected limit of the EELS
detector temporal resolution. The measured lifetimes of \textit{NV$^0$} centers
in diamond nanoparticles (20 to 40 ns) and \textit{4.1 eV} defect in h-BN
flakes ($<$ 2 ns) matches those reported for those materials previously.

<h3>A Cluster-Based Computational Thermodynamics Framework with Intrinsic  Chemical Short-Range Order: Part I. Configurational Contribution</h3>

Exploiting chemical short-range order (SRO) is a promising new avenue for
manipulating the properties of alloys. However, existing modeling frameworks
are not sufficient to understand and predict SRO in multicomponent (>3) alloys.
In this work, we developed a hybrid computational thermodynamics framework by
marrying unique advantages from CVM (Cluster Variation Method) and CALPHAD
(CALculation of PHAse Diagram) method through incorporating chemical SRO into
CALPHAD with a novel cluster-based solution model. The key is to use the
Fowler-Yang-Li transform to decompose the cumbersome cluster chemical
potentials in CVM into fewer site chemical potentials of the basis cluster,
thereby considerably reducing the number of variables that must be minimized
for multicomponent systems. The new framework puts more physics, primarily
intrinsic SRO, into CALPHAD, while maintaining its practicality and efficiency.
It leverages statistical mechanics to yield a more physical description of
configurational entropy and opens the door to cluster-based CALPHAD database
development. The application of this newly proposed model in the prototype FCC
AB system demonstrated that this model can correctly capture the essential
features of the phase diagram and thermodynamic properties. The hybrid
CVM-CALPHAD framework represents a new methodology for thermodynamic modeling
that enables atomic-scale order to be exploited as a dimension for materials
design, which potentially leads to novel complex concentrated alloys. It
achieves a balance between the accuracy and computational cost for modeling
multicomponent alloys with the intrinsic SRO in the context of CALPHAD.

<h3>Anisotropy in the dielectric function of Bi$_2$Te$_3$ from first  principles: From the UV-visible to the infrared range</h3>

<br>
<br>
The dielectric properties of Bi$_2$Te$_3$, a layered compound crystallizing
in a rhombohedral structure, are investigated by means of first-principles
calculations at the random phase approximation level. A special attention is
devoted to the anisotropy in the dielectric function and to the local field
effects that strongly renormalize the optical properties in the UV-visible
range when the electric field is polarized along the stacking axis.
Furthermore, both the Born effective charges for each atom and the zone center
phonon frequencies and eigenvectors needed to describe the dielectric response
in the infrared range are computed. Our theoretical near-normal incidence
reflectivity spectras in both the UV-visible and infrared range are in fairly
good agreement with the experimental spectras, provided that the free carriers
Drude contribution arising from defects is included in the infrared response.
The anisotropic plasmon frequencies entering the Drude model are computed
within the rigid band approximation, suggesting that a measurement of the
reflectivity in the infrared range for both polarizations might allow to infer
not only the type of doping but also the level of doping.

Spin waves are collective perturbations in the orientation of the magnetic
moments in magnetically ordered materials. Their rich phenomenology is
intrinsically three dimensional, from the trajectory of the spin precession
during their propagation, to the profiles of the spin-wave mode throughout the
volume of the magnetic system. This gives rise to novel complex phenomena with
high potential for applications in the field of magnonics. However, the
three-dimensional imaging of spin waves, key to understanding and harnessing
these phenomena, has so far not been possible. Here, we image the
three-dimensional dynamics of spin waves excited in a synthetic
antiferromagnet, with nanoscale spatial resolution and sub-ns temporal
resolution, using time-resolved magnetic laminography. In this way, we map the
distribution of the spin-wave modes throughout the volume of the structure,
revealing unexpected depth-dependent profiles originating from the interlayer
dipolar interaction. We experimentally demonstrate the existence of complex
three-dimensional interference patterns, and analyze them via micromagnetic
modelling. We find that these patterns are generated by the superposition of
spin waves with non-uniform amplitude profiles, and that their features can be
controlled by tuning the composition and structure of the magnetic system. Our
results open unforeseen possibilities for the study of complex spin-wave modes
and their interaction within nanostructures, and for the generation and
manipulation of three-dimensional spin-wave landscapes for the design of novel
functions in magnonic devices.

<h3>Nonlinear intensity dependence of ratchet currents induced by terahertz  laser radiation in bilayer graphene with asymmetric periodic grating gates</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report on the observation of a nonlinear intensity dependence of the
terahertz radiation induced ratchet effects in bilayer graphene with asymmetric
dual grating gate lateral lattices. These nonlinear ratchet currents are
studied in structures of two designs with dual grating gate fabricated on top
of encapsulated bilayer graphene and beneath it. The strength and sign of the
photocurrent can be controllably varied by changing the bias voltages applied
to individual dual grating subgates and the back gate. The current consists of
contributions insensitive to the radiation's polarization state, defined by the
orientation of the radiation electric field vector with respect to the dual
grating gate metal stripes, and the circular ratchet sensitive to the radiation
helicity. We show that intense terahertz radiation results in a nonlinear
intensity dependence caused by electron gas heating. At room temperature the
ratchet current saturates at high intensities of the order of hundreds to
several hundreds of kWcm$^{-2}$. At $T = 4 {\rm K}$, the nonlinearity manifests
itself at intensities that are one or two orders of magnitude lower, moreover,
the photoresponse exhibits a complex dependence on the intensity, including a
saturation and even a change of sign with increasing intensity. This complexity
is attributed to the interplay of the Seebeck ratchet and the dynamic carrier
density redistribution, which feature different intensity dependencies and a
nonlinear behavior of the sample's conductivity induced by electron gas
heating. Our study demonstrates that graphene-based asymmetric dual grating
gate devices can be used as terahertz detectors at room temperature over a wide
dynamic range, spanning many orders of magnitude of terahertz radiation power.
Therefore, their integration together with current-driven read-out electronics
is attractive for the operation with high-power pulsed sources.

<h3>Magnetic proximity in a coupled Ferromagnet-Spin glass system</h3>

We study the competition between ferromagnetic and spin glass phases using a
system of coupled infinite-range Ising and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick models. We
obtain the replica-symmetric solution for the free energy of this system in
terms of magnetization and Edwards-Anderson order parameters in both
subsystems. Using these order parameters we are able to identify different
phases in the system and determine which phase is dominant for different
strengths of the coupling between two subsystems. We observe that both
subsystems are in the same phase although with different order parameters. The
phase boundary between paramagnetic-ferromagnetic and paramagnetic-spin glass
phases is more or less similar to that in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick phase
diagram. But the boundary between ferromagnetic-spin glass phases becomes
qualitatively different as the coupling between the two subsystems changes.
Remarkably, for intermediate values of the coupling, this phase boundary is
such that there could be a reentrant transition between spin glass and
ferromagnetic phases by increasing the temperature. We found that for some
range of the coupling, the second order transition between these phases turns
into first order at a tricritical point. Further, we carry out the stability
analysis by considering deviations from the replica symmetric solution.

Quantized adiabatic transport can occur when a system is slowly modulated
over time. In most realizations however, the efficiency of such transport is
reduced by unwanted dissipation, back-scattering, and non-adiabatic effects. In
this work, we realize a topological adiabatic pump in an electrical circuit
network that supports remarkably stable and long-lasting pumping of a voltage
signal. We further characterize the topology of our system by deducing the
Chern number from the measured edge band structure. To achieve this, the
experimental setup makes use of active circuit elements that act as
time-variable voltage-controlled inductors.

Van der Waals atomic solids of noble gases on metals at cryogenic
temperatures were the first experimental examples of two-dimensional systems.
Recently such structures have also been created on under encapsulation by
graphene, allowing studies at elevated temperatures through scanning tunneling
microscopy. However, for this technique, the encapsulation layer often obscures
the actual arrangement of the noble gas atoms. Here, we create Kr and Xe
clusters in between two suspended graphene layers, and uncover their atomic
structure through direct imaging with transmission electron microscopy. We show
that small crystals (N<9) arrange as expected based on the simple
non-directional van der Waals interaction. Crystals larger than this show some
deviations for the outermost atoms, possibly enabled by deformations in the
encapsulating graphene lattice. We further discuss the dynamics of the clusters
within the graphene sandwich, and show that while all Xe clusters with up to at
least N=51 remain solid, Kr clusters with already N~16 turn occasionally fluid
under our experimental conditions with an estimated pressure of ca. 0.3 GPa.
This study opens a way for the so-far unexplored frontier of encapsulated
two-dimensional van der Waals solids with exciting possibilities for condensed
matter physics research that expands from quantum structures to biological
applications.

Strongly correlated electron systems can be driven to quantum critical points
via various routes. Contrary to field-induced transitions of a gapped quantum
antiferromagnet into the gapless ordered state (characterized by the $z=2$
dynamic critical exponent and a quadratic excitation dispersion),
pressure-induced instabilities possess $z=1$ and a linear excitation spectrum,
belonging to another universality class. Employing radio-frequency
susceptibility technique, we demonstrate that in the tetragonal easy-plane
quantum paramagnet NiCl$_2$$\cdot$4SC(NH$_2$)$_2$ (aka DTN) the spin gap
vanishes at about $4.3$ kbar, suggesting the onset of antiferromagentic order
induced by pressure. Powder neutron diffraction measurements confirm that no
lattice distortion occurs at this pressure and that the high spin symmetry is
preserved. We are able to quantitatively describe the pressure-driven evolution
of the critical fields and spin Hamiltonian parameters in DTN. The studies are
complemented by high-pressure electron spin resonance measurements confirming
the proposed scenario.

We present an experimental study of the dynamics of a set of magnets within a
fluid in which a remote torque applied by a vertical oscillating magnetic field
transfers angular momentum to individual magnets. This system differs from
previous experimental studies of granular gas where the energy is injected by
vibrating the boundaries. Here, we do not observe any cluster formation,
orientational correlation and equipartition of the energy. The magnets' linear
velocity distributions are stretched exponentials, similar to 3D
boundary-forced dry granular gas systems, but the exponent does not depend on
the number of magnets. The value of the exponent of the stretched exponential
distributions is close to the value of 3/2 previously derived theoretically.
Our results also show that the conversion rate of angular momentum into linear
momentum during the collisions controls the dynamics of this
homogenously-forced granular gas. We report the differences between this
homogeneously-forced granular gas, ideal gas, and nonequilibrium
boundary-forced dissipative granular gas.

EPIq (Electron-Phonon wannier Interpolation over k and q-points) is an
open-source software for the calculation of electron-phonon interaction related
properties from first principles.Acting as a post-processing tool for a
density-functional perturbation theory code ( Quantum ESPRESSO ) and wannier90,
EPIq exploits the localization of the deformation potential in the Wannier
function basis and the stationary properties of a force-constant functional
with respect to the first-order perturbation of the electronic charge density
to calculate many electron-phonon related properties with high accuracy and
free from convergence issues related to Brillouin zone sampling. EPIq features
includes: the adiabatic and non-adiabatic phonon dispersion, superconducting
properties (including the superconducting band gap in the Migdal-Eliashberg
formulation), double-resonant Raman spectra and lifetime of excited carriers.
The possibility to customize most of its input makes EPIq a versatile and
interoperable tool. Particularly relevant is the interaction with the
Stochastic Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SSCHA) allowing anharmonic
effects to be included in the calculation of electron-properties. The
scalability offered by the Wannier representation combined with a
straightforward workflow and easy-to-read input and output files make EPIq
accessible to the wide condensed matter and material science communities.

The topology of the Brillouin zone, foundational in topological physics, is
always assumed to be a torus. We theoretically report the construction of
Brillouin real projective plane ($\mathrm{RP}^2$) and the appearance of
quadrupole insulating phase, which are enabled by momentum-space nonsymmorphic
symmetries stemming from $\mathbb{Z}_2$ synthetic gauge fields. We show that
the momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries quantize bulk polarization and
Wannier-sector polarization nonlocally across different momenta, resulting in
quantized corner charges and an isotropic binary bulk quadrupole phase diagram,
where the phase transition is triggered by a bulk energy gap closing. Under
open boundary conditions, the nontrivial bulk quadrupole phase manifests either
trivial or nontrivial edge polarization, resulting from the violation of
momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries under lattice termination. We present a
concrete design for the $\mathrm{RP}^2$ quadrupole insulator based on acoustic
resonator arrays and discuss its feasibility in optics, mechanics, and
electrical circuits. Our results show that deforming the Brillouin manifold
creates opportunities for realizing high-order band topology.

Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond offer a sensitive method of
measuring the spatially localized dynamics of magnetization and associated spin
textures in ferromagnetic materials. We use NV centers in a deterministically
positioned nanodiamond to demonstrate off-resonant detection of GHz-scale
microwave field driven oscillations of a single domain wall (DW). The technique
exploits the enhanced relaxation of NV center spins due to the broadband stray
fields generated by an oscillating DW pinned at an engineered defect in a
lithographically patterned ferromagnetic nanowire. Discrepancies between the
observed DW oscillation frequency and predictions from micromagnetic
simulations suggest extreme sensitivity of DW dynamics to patterning
imperfections such as edge roughness. These experiments and simulations
identify potential pathways toward quantum spintronic devices that exploit
current driven DWs as nanoscale microwave generators for qubit control, greatly
increasing the driving field at an NV center and thus drastically reducing the
{\pi} pulse time.

We study the electron-phonon relaxation in the model of a granular metal
film, where the grains are formed by regularly arranged potential barriers of
arbitrary transparency. The relaxation rate of Debye acoustic phonons is
calculated taking into account two mechanisms of electron-phonon scattering:
the standard Frohlich interaction of the lattice deformation with the electron
density and the interaction mediated by the displacement of grain boundaries
dragged by the lattice vibration. At lowest temperatures, the electron-phonon
cooling power follows the power-law temperature dependence typical for clean
systems, but with the prefactor growing as the transparency of the grain
boundaries decreases.

Magnetic random access memory (MRAM) is a leading emergent memory technology
that is poised to replace current non-volatile memory technologies such as
eFlash. However, the scaling of MRAM technologies is heavily affected by
device-to-device variability rooted in the stochastic nature of the MRAM
writing process into nanoscale magnetic layers. Here, we introduce a
non-contact metrology technique deploying Scanning NV Magnetometry (SNVM) to
investigate MRAM performance at the individual bit level. We demonstrate
magnetic reversal characterization in individual, < 60 nm sized bits, to
extract key magnetic properties, thermal stability, and switching statistics,
and thereby gauge bit-to-bit uniformity. We showcase the performance of our
method by benchmarking two distinct bit etching processes immediately after
pattern formation. Unlike previous methods, our approach unveils marked
differences in switching behaviour of fully contacted MRAM devices stemming
from these processes. Our findings highlight the potential of nanoscale quantum
sensing of MRAM devices for early-stage screening in the processing line,
paving the way for future incorporation of this nanoscale characterization tool

<br>
We investigate optically induced magnetization in Floquet-Weyl semimetals
generated by irradiation of a circularly-polarized continuous-wave laser from
the group II-V narrow gap semiconductor Zn$_3$As$_2$ in a theoretical manner.
Here, this trivial and nonmagnetic crystal is driven by the laser with a nearly
resonant frequency with a band gap to generate two types of Floquet-Weyl
semimetal phases composed of different spin states. These two phases host
nontrivial two-dimensional surface states pinned to the respective pairs of the
Weyl points. By numerically evaluating the laser-induced transient
carrier-dynamics, it is found that both spins are distributed in an uneven
manner on the corresponding surface states, respectively, due to significantly
different excitation probabilities caused by the circularly-polarized laser
with the nearly resonant frequency. It is likely that such spin-polarized
surface states produce surface magnetization, and furthermore the inverse
Faraday effect also contributes almost as much as the spin magnetization. To be
more specific, excited carries with high density of the order of $10^{21}\:
{\rm cm}^{-3}$ are generated by the laser with electric field strength of a few
MV/cm to result in the surface magnetization that becomes asymptotically
constant with respect to time, around 1 mT. The magnitude and the direction of
it depend sharply on both of the intensity and frequency of the driving laser,
which would be detected by virtue of the magneto-optic Kerr effect.

Vinen's vibrating wire experiment detected quantized vortices in superfluid
4He, with the anticipated circulation quantum h/m. In addition to this main
result, Vinen used his data to propose other properties and behaviors of
vortices, which are revisited here. Subsequent work confirmed that
non-quantized values occur when vortices cover only part of the wire's length,
and that the size of the covered section can change easily. Any motion of the
detached portion of the vortex induces changes in the circulation around the
wire, which provides a means of tracking the free vortex. Particularly
distinctive signatures correspond to a circular motion of the vortex through
the cell and to Kelvin waves along the free vortex. Another issue, the lack of
stability of multi-quantum states, can also be explained through simple
arguments, in which the possibility of a partially detached vortex again plays
a key role. Vibrating wire measurements descended from Vinen's continue to
probe superfluid flow.

We study equilibrium configurations in spherical droplets of nematic liquid
crystal with strong radial anchoring, within the Landau-de Gennes theory with a
sixth-order bulk potential. The sixth-order potential predicts a bulk biaxial
phase for sufficiently low temperatures, which the conventional fourth-order
potential cannot predict. We prove the existence of a radial hedgehog solution,
which is a uniaxial solution with a single isotropic point defect at the
droplet centre, for all temperatures and droplet sizes, and prove that there is
a unique radial hedgehog solution for moderately low temperatures, but not deep
in the nematic phase. We numerically compute critical points of the Landau-de
Gennes free energy with the sixth order bulk potential, with rotational and
mirror symmetry, and find at least two competing stable critical points: the
biaxial torus and split core solutions, which have biaxial regions around the
centre, for low temperatures. The size of the biaxial regions increases with
decreasing temperature. We also compare the properties of the radial hedgehog
solution with the fourth-order and sixth-order potentials respectively, in
terms of the Morse indices as a function of the temperature and droplet radius;
the role of the radial hedgehog solution as a transition state in switching
processes; and compare the bifurcation plots with temperature, with the fourth-
and sixth-order potentials. Overall, the sixth-order potential has a
stabilising effect on biaxial critical points and a de-stabilising effect on
uniaxial critical points and we discover an altogether novel bulk biaxial
critical point of the Landau-de Gennes energy with the sixth-order potential,
for which the bulk biaxiality is driven by the sixth-order potential.

<br>
The reliability of fast repeated erasures is studied experimentally and
theoretically in a 1-bit underdamped memory. The bit is encoded by the position
of a micro-mechanical oscillator whose motion is confined in a double well
potential. To contain the energetic cost of fast erasures, we use a resonator
with high quality factor $Q$: the erasure work $\mathcal{W}$ is close to
Landauer's bound, even at high speed. The drawback is the rise of the system's
temperature $T$ due to a weak coupling to the environment. Repeated erasures
without letting the memory thermalize between operations result in a continuous
warming, potentially leading to a thermal noise overcoming the barrier between
the potential wells. In such case, the reset operation can fail to reach the
targeted logical state. The reliability is characterized by the success rate
$R^{\textrm{s}}_i$ after $i$ successive operations. $\mathcal{W}$, $T$ and
$R^{\textrm{s}}_i$ are studied experimentally as a function of the erasure
speed. Above a velocity threshold, $T$ soars while $R^{\textrm{s}}_i$
collapses: the reliability of too fast erasures is low. These experimental
results are fully justified by two complementary models. We demonstrate that
$Q\simeq 10$ is optimal to contain energetic costs and maintain high
reliability standards for repeated erasures at any speed.

Optical box traps for cold atoms offer new possibilities for quantum-gas

propose to engineer system-reservoir configurations using box traps, in view of
preparing and manipulating topological atomic states in optical lattices.
First, we consider the injection of particles from the reservoir to the system:
this scenario is shown to be particularly well suited to activate
energy-selective chiral edge currents, but also, to prepare fractional Chern
insulating ground states. Then, we devise a practical evaporative-cooling
scheme to effectively cool down atomic gases into topological ground states.
Our open-system approach to optical-lattice settings provides a new path for
the investigation of ultracold quantum matter, including strongly-correlated

of GdV$_6$Sn$_6$ suggested the presence of a modulated magnetic order distinct
from the ferromagnetism that is easily polarized by the application of a
magnetic field. Diffraction data near the Gd-$L_2$ edge directly resolve a
$c$-axis modulated spin structure order on the Gd sublattice with an
incommensurate wave vector that evolves upon cooling toward a partial lock-in
transition. While equal moment (spiral) and amplitude (sine) modulated spin
states can not be unambiguously discerned from the scattering data, the overall
phenomenology suggests an amplitude modulated state with moments predominantly
oriented in the $ab$-plane. Comparisons to the ``double-flat" spiral state
observed in Mn-based $R$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$ kagome compounds of the same structure
type are discussed.

Population heterogeneity is ubiquitous among active living systems, but
little is known about its role in determining their spatial organization and
large-scale dynamics. Combining evidence from synthetic active fluids assembled
from self-propelled colloidal particles along with theoretical predictions at
the continuum scale, we demonstrate the spontaneous demixing of binary polar
liquids within circular confinement. Our analysis reveals how both active speed
heterogeneity and non-reciprocal repulsive interactions lead to self-sorting
behavior. By establishing general principles for the self-organization of
binary polar liquids, our findings highlight the specificity of multi-component
active systems.

The combination of soft responsive particles, such as microgels, with
nanoparticles (NPs) yields highly versatile complexes of great potential for
applications, from ad-hoc plasmonic sensors to controlled protocols for loading
and release. However, the assembly process between these microscale networks
and the co-dispersed nano-objects has not been investigated so far at the
microscopic level, preempting the possibility of designing such hybrid
complexes a priori. In this work, we combine state-of-the-art numerical
simulations with experiments, to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms taking
place when microgels-NPs assembly is controlled by electrostatic interactions.
We find a general behavior where, by increasing the number of interacting NPs,
the microgel deswells up to a minimum size, after which a plateau behavior
occurs. This occurs either when NPs are mainly adsorbed to the microgel corona
via the folding of the more external chains, or when NPs penetrate inside the
microgel, thereby inducing a collective reorganization of the polymer network.
By varying microgel properties, such as fraction of crosslinkers or charge, as
well as NPs size and charge, we further show that the microgel deswelling
curves can be rescaled onto a single master curve, for both experiments and
simulations, demonstrating that the process is entirely controlled by the
charge of the whole microgel-NPs complex. Our results thus have a direct
relevance in fundamental materials science and offer novel tools to tailor the
nanofabrication of hybrid devices of technological interest.

Tantalum ditelluride TaTe$_2$ belongs to the family of layered transition
metal dichalcogenides but exhibits a unique structural phase transition at
around 170 K that accompanies the rearrangement of the Ta atomic network from a
"ribbon chain" to a "butterfly-like" pattern. While multiple mechanisms
including Fermi surface nesting and chemical bonding instabilities have been
intensively discussed, the origin of this transition remains elusive. Here we
investigate the electronic structure of single-crystalline TaTe$_2$ with a
particular focus on its modifications through the phase transition, by
employing core-level and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy combined
with first-principles calculations. Temperature-dependent core-level
spectroscopy demonstrates a splitting of the Ta $4f$ core-level spectra through
the phase transition indicative of the Ta-dominated electronic state
reconstruction. Low-energy electronic state measurements further reveal an
unusual kink-like band reconstruction occurring at the Brillouin zone boundary,
which cannot be explained by Fermi surface nesting or band folding effects. On
the basis of the orbital-projected band calculations, this band reconstruction
is mainly attributed to the modifications of specific Ta $5d$ states, namely
the $d_{XY}$ orbitals (the ones elongating along the ribbon chains) at the
center Ta sites of the ribbon chains. The present results highlight the strong
orbital-dependent electronic state reconstruction through the phase transition
in this system and provide fundamental insights towards understanding complex
electron-lattice-bond coupled phenomena.

<h3>Compression and fracture of ordered and disordered droplet rafts</h3>

We simulate a two-dimensional array of droplets being compressed between two
walls. The droplets are adhesive due to an attractive depletion force. As one
wall moves toward the other, the droplet array is compressed and eventually
induced to rearrange. The rearrangement occurs via a fracture, where depletion
bonds are quickly broken between a subset of droplets. For monodisperse,
hexagonally ordered droplet arrays, this fracture is preceded by a maximum
force exerted on the walls, which drops rapidly after the fracture occurs. In
small droplet arrays a fracture is a single well-defined event, but for larger
droplet arrays, competing fractures can be observed. These are fractures
nucleated nearly simultaneously in different locations. Finally, we also study
the compression of bidisperse droplet arrays. The addition of a second droplet
size further disrupts fracture events, showing differences between ideal
crystalline arrays, crystalline arrays with a small number of defects, and
fully amorphous arrays. These results are in good agreement with previously
published experiments.

<h3>Utilizing multimodal microscopy to reconstruct Si/SiGe interfacial  atomic disorder and infer its impacts on qubit variability</h3>

SiGe heteroepitaxial growth yields pristine host material for quantum dot
qubits, but residual interface disorder can lead to qubit-to-qubit variability
that might pose an obstacle to reliable SiGe-based quantum computing. We
demonstrate a technique to reconstruct 3D interfacial atomic structure spanning
multiqubit areas by combining data from two verifiably atomic-resolution
microscopy techniques. Utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to track
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth, we image surface atomic structure
following deposition of each heterostructure layer revealing nanosized SiGe
undulations, disordered strained-Si atomic steps, and nonconformal uncorrelated
roughness between interfaces. Since phenomena such as atomic intermixing during
subsequent overgrowth inevitably modify interfaces, we measure post-growth
structure via cross-sectional high-angle annular dark field scanning
transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). Features such as nanosized
roughness remain intact, but atomic step structure is indiscernible in $1.0\pm
0.4$~nm-wide intermixing at interfaces. Convolving STM and HAADF-STEM data
yields 3D structures capturing interface roughness and intermixing. We utilize
the structures in an atomistic multivalley effective mass theory to quantify
qubit spectral variability. The results indicate (1) appreciable valley
splitting (VS) variability of roughly $\pm$ $50\%$ owing to alloy disorder, and
(2) roughness-induced double-dot detuning bias energy variability of order
$1-10$ meV depending on well thickness. For measured intermixing, atomic steps
have negligible influence on VS, and uncorrelated roughness causes spatially
fluctuating energy biases in double-dot detunings potentially incorrectly
attributed to charge disorder.

We use resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the O $K$- and Cu
$K$-edges to investigate the doping- and temperature dependence of low-energy
plasmon excitations in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$. We observe a monotonic
increase of the energy scale of the plasmons with increasing doping $x$ in the
underdoped regime, whereas a saturation occurs above optimal doping $x \gtrsim
0.16$ and persists at least up to $x = 0.4$. Furthermore, we find that the
plasmon excitations show only a marginal temperature dependence, and possible
effects due to the superconducting transition and the onset of strange metal
behavior are either absent or below the detection limit of our experiment.
Taking into account the strongly correlated character of the cuprates, we show
that layered $t$-$J$-$V$ model calculations accurately capture the increase of
the plasmon energy in the underdoped regime. However, the computed plasmon
energy continues to increase even for doping levels above $x \gtrsim 0.16$,
which is distinct from the experimentally observed saturation, and reaches a
broad maximum around $x = 0.55$. We discuss whether possible lattice disorder
in overdoped samples, a renormalization of the electronic correlation strength
at high dopings, or an increasing relevance of non-planar Cu and O orbitals
could be responsible for the discrepancy between experiment and theory for
doping levels above $x = 0.16$.

<h3>Zinc dialkyldithiophosphates adsorption and dissociation on ferrous  substrates: an ab initio study</h3>

Zinc dialkyldithiophosphates (ZDDPs) have been commonly used as anti-wear
additives in the automotive industry for the past 80 years. The morphology,
composition and structure of the ZDDPs phosphate-based tribofilm, which is
essential for its lubricant functioning, have been widely studied
experimentally. However, despite their widespread use, a general agreement on
their primary functioning mechanism is still lacking. The morphology and
composition of the ZDDPs phosphate-based tribofilm have been widely studied
experimentally, but the formation process and the relevant driving forces are
still largely debated. In particular, it is unclear whether the stress-induced
molecular dissociation occurs in the bulk oil or on the substrate. In this
work, we employ ab initio density-functional theory simulations to compare ZDDP
fragmentation in vacuum and over a reactive substrate, considering the effects
of surface oxidation on the dissociation path. Our results show that the
molecular dissociation is highly endothermic in the absence of a supporting
substrate, while in the presence of an iron substrate it becomes highly
energetically favoured. Moreover, the presence of the substrate changes the
reaction path. At the same time, surface oxidation reduces the
molecule-substrate interaction. These findings provide valuable insights into
the early stages of the formation of phosphate-based tribofilms.

<h3>Surface superconductor-insulator transition induced by an electric field</h3>

It is well-known that the electric field can induce phase transitions between
superconducting, metallic and insulating states in thin-film materials due to
its control of the charge carrier density. Since a similar effect on the charge
carriers can also be expected for surfaces of bulk samples, here we investigate
the transformation of the surface states in a superconductor under an applied
screened electric field. Our study is performed by numerically solving the
self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for the one-dimensional
attractive Hubbard model. It is found that the surface insulating regime occurs
at sufficiently large (but still experimentally accessible) electric fields.
Our calculations yield the phase diagram of the surface superconducting,
metallic, and insulating states for a wide range of temperatures and applied
fields. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the phase diagram
obtained by the transport measurements for (Li, Fe)OHFeSe thin flakes [Sci.
Bull. 64, 653 (2019); ACS Nano 14, 7513 (2020)].

<h3>Flat-band induced local Hilbert space fragmentation</h3>

We demonstrate that a complete class of flat-band lattices with underlying
commutative local symmetries exhibit a locally fragmented Hilbert space. The
equitable partition theorem ensures distinct parities for the compact localized
states (CLSs) present in this class of flat-band lattices and the extended
eigenstates of the system. In the presence of on-site bosonic interactions,
such models exhibit a conserved quantity, the parity of the number of particles
located in all the CLSs in a unit cell. As a consequence, the Hilbert space
presents local fragmentation, which is only revealed upon rotating the basis of
the Hamiltonian that decouples the CLSs at the single-particle level. We find
that the fragmentation is strong and also robust to the addition of long-range
interactions. As an example, we numerically analyze the fragmentation of the
one-dimensional Pyrochlore chain, which exhibits both nonintegrable sectors,
effective single-particle sectors, and frozen states. We also show that the
entanglement entropies form a nested-dome structure typical of these fragmented
systems and that thermalization is restricted to each sub-sector.

<h3>Synthetic tensor gauge fields</h3>

Synthetic gauge fields have provided physicists with a unique tool to explore
a wide range of fundamentally important phenomena in physics. However, only
synthetic vector gauge fields are currently available in experiments. The study
of tensor gauge fields, which play a vital role in fracton phase of matter,
remains purely theoretical. Here, we propose schemes to realize synthetic
tensor gauge fields using techniques readily available in laboratories. A
lattice tilted by a strong linear potential and a weak quadratic potential
naturally yields a rank-2 electric field for a lineon formed by a particle-hole
pair. Such a rank-2 electric field leads to a new type of Bloch oscillations,
where neither a single particle nor a single hole responds but a lineon
vibrates. A synthetic vector gauge field carrying a position-dependent phase
could also be implemented to produce the same synthetic tensor gauge field for
a lineon. In higher dimensions, the interplay between interactions and vector
gauge potentials imprints a phase to the ring-exchange interaction and thus
generates synthetic tensor gauge fields for planons. Such tensor gauge fields
make it possible to realize a dipolar Harper-Hofstadter model in laboratories.
