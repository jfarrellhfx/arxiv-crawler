<h3>Anisotropic run-and-tumble-turn dynamics</h3>

Run-and-tumble processes successfully model several living systems. While
studies have typically focused on particles with isotropic tumbles, recent
examples exhibit "tumble-turns", in which particles undergo 90{\deg} tumbles
and so possess explicitly anisotropic dynamics. We study the consequences of
such tumble-turn anisotropicity at both short and long-time scales. We model
run-and-tumble-turn particles as self-propelled particles subjected to an
angular potential. Using agent-based simulations, we study the interplay of
noise and potential on the particles' trajectories, demonstrating that the
long-time effect is to alter the tumble-turn time, which governs the long-time
dynamics. In particular, when normalized by this timescale, trajectories become
independent of the underlying details of the potential. As such, we develop a
simplified continuum theory, which quantitatively agrees with agent
simulations. The hydrodynamic limit reveals that the transition to diffusive
dynamics precedes the transition to isotropic dynamics as the hydrodynamic
limit, while purely diffusive, can drive anisotropicity at intermediate times.

<h3>$G_2$ Integrable Point Characterization via Isotropic Spin-3 Chains</h3>

We investigate the physical properties of $G_2$-symmetric integrable chains
with local degrees of freedom in the fundamental representation; given the
typical connection between integrability and critical points, we test the
model's properties against a hypothesis of conformal-invariant long-distance
behavior. Leveraging an embedding between the $G_2$ exceptional Lie algebra and
$SU(2)$-symmetric chains with local spin-3 representations, we perform
numerical analyses via exact diagonalization (ED) targeted at specific spin
sectors, as well as via non-Abelian density-matrix renormalization group
(DMRG). A basic study of the momentum-resolved ED spectrum suggests the
low-energy system is effectively described by a $(G_2)_1$ Wess--Zumino--Witten
(WZW) theory, but we find challenges in further numerical characterization of
conformal data. The study and control of the phenomenology of this model may
have implications for the development of accessible models for Fibonacci
anyons.

The pursuit of efficient spin-polarization in quaternary Heusler alloys with
the general formula $XX'YZ$ (where X, $X'$, and Y are transition metals and Z
is a p-block element), has been a subject of significant scientific interest.
While previous studies shows that isoelectronic substitution of 4d element in
place of 3d element in quaternary Heusler alloy, improves the half-metallic
ferromagnetic characteristics, our research on the quaternary Heusler alloy
NiRuMnSn reveals a strikingly different scenario. In this study, we present a
detailed structural analysis of the material using X-ray absorption fine
structure (EXAFS) and neutron diffraction (ND) techniques, which confirms the
formation of a single-phase compound with 50:50 site disorder between Ni/Ru
atoms at 4c/4d sites. Contrary to expectations, our DFT calculations suggests a
considerable decrease in spin-polarization even in the ordered structure.
Additionally, we report on the compound's exceptional behavior, displaying a
rare re-entrant spin glass property below $\sim$60 K, a unique and intriguing
feature for quaternary Heusler-type compounds.

The realization of spin-glass (S-G) state in Heusler alloys is very rare
despite the presence of inherent structural and elemental disorder in those
compounds. Although a few half and full Heusler alloys are known to exhibit S-G
state, there is hardly any manifestation of the same in cases of quaternary
Heusler compounds. Here we report the observation of S-G state in a highly
disordered equiatomic quaternary Heusler compound: FeRuMnGa, where the S-G
state is in between of canonical S-G and cluster glass. Different intricate
features of S-G state including non-equilibrium magnetic dynamics at low
temperature in the compound are unveiled through our comprehensive magnetic,
heat capacity and neutron diffraction studies. The structural disorder in the
sample is neither conventional \textit{A2}- nor \textit{B2}-type while those
two types are commonly observed for Heusler compounds. The presence of disorder
also plays a significant role in electron transport properties of the alloy,
which is reflected in its exhibition of semi-metallic behavior and anomalous
Hall effect at low temperature.

<h3>Understanding the Salt Effects on the Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation of  Proteins</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03109" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03109</a>

Protein aggregation via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is ubiquitous
in nature and intimately connects to many human diseases. Although it is widely
known that the addition of salt has crucial impacts on the LLPS of protein,
full understanding of the salt effect remains an outstanding challenge. Here,
we develop a molecular theory which systematically incorporates the
self-consistent field theory for charged macromolecules into the solution
thermodynamics. The electrostatic interaction, hydrophobicity, ion solvation
and translational entropy are included in a unified framework. Our theory fully
captures the long-standing puzzles of the non-monotonic salt concentration
dependence and the specific ion effect. We find that proteins show salting-out
at low salt concentrations due to ionic screening. The solubility follows the
inverse Hofmeister series. In the high salt concentration regime, protein
remains salting-out for small ions but turns to salting-in for larger ions,
accompanied by the reversal of the Hofmeister series. We reveal that the
solubility at high salt concentrations is determined by the competition between
the solvation energy and translational entropy of ion. Furthermore, we derive
an analytical criterion for determining the boundary between the salting-in and
salting-out regimes. The theoretical prediction is in quantitative agreement
with experimental results for various proteins and salt ions without any
fitting parameters.

<h3>Ordering/displacive ferrielectricity in 2D MM'P$_2$S$_6$</h3>

DFT-based molecular dynamics simulation of the Cu$^+$ cations flipping of and
the In$^{3+}$ cations displacive dynamics of, we clarify the dipole ordering of
CuInP$_2$S$_6$ ferrielectrics through the second order Jahn-Teller effect which
determines the double-well potential for copper cations as well as three-well
potential for indium cations inside the structural layers. The temperature
dependence of the spatial distribution of Cu$^+$ and In$^{3+}$ cations is also
described within the quantum anharmonic oscillators model. In$^{3+}$ cations
play a decisive role in the character of the polar ordering: at ambient or for
positive pressures, the first order transition occurs; with the rise of
negative compression, the ferrielectric transition evolves to the second order.
The peculiarities of spontaneous polarization switching are related to the
contributions of copper and indium cationic sublattices.

<h3>The Ising model with a periodic spin-lattice coupling on the triangular  lattice</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this work, we study and evaluate the impact of a periodic spin-lattice
coupling in an Ising-like system on a 2D triangular lattice. Our proposed
simple Hamiltonian considers this additional interaction as an effect of
preferential phonon propagation direction augmented by the symmetry of the
underline lattice. The simplified analytical description of this new model
brought us consistent information about its ground state and thermal behavior,
and allowed us to highlight a singularity where the model behaves as several
decoupled one-dimensional Ising systems. A thorough analysis was obtained via
numerical simulations using the Wang-Landau Monte Carlo method that estimates
the density of states g(E) to explore the phase diagram and other thermodynamic
properties of interest. Also, we used the finite size scaling technique to
characterize the critical exponents and the nature of the phase transitions
that, despite the strong influence of the spin-lattice coupling, turned out to
be within the same universality class as the original 2D Ising model.

<h3>Finite-temperature many-body perturbation theory for vibrations:  Recursions, algebraic reduction, second-quantized reduction, diagrammatic  rules, linked-diagram theorem, finite-temperature self-consistent field, and  general-order algorithm</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03137" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03137</a>
<br>
<i>Xiuyi Qin, So Hirata</i>
<br>
<br>
A unified theory is presented for finite-temperature many-body perturbation
expansions of anharmonic vibrational contributions to thermodynamic functions,
i.e., the free energy, internal energy, and entropy. The theory is formulated
bottom-up by the Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger-style recursions derivable in
transparent and straightforward algebra from the time-independent
Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The recursions then generate sum-over-states formulas
for the perturbation series. Two strategies are introduced to reducing these
sum-over-states formulas into compact sum-over-modes analytical formulas, which
have the remarkable ability to incorporate thermal anharmonic effects on
infinitely many states. One is a purely algebraic method based on the
Born-Huang rules elevated to finite temperature. The other is
finite-temperature normal-ordered second quantization, which is fully developed
in this study, including a proof of thermal Wick's theorem and the derivation
of a normal-ordered vibrational Hamiltonian at finite temperature, defining a
finite-temperature extension of the size-extensive vibrational self-consistent
field. These two reduction strategies lead to an identical formalism, which can
furthermore be represented graphically as time-independent Feynman diagrams
with resolvent lines (designating denominator factors), which include the
anomalous and/or renormalization diagrams. A linked-diagram theorem is proved,
guaranteeing size-consistency of the theory at any order. Two order-by-order
and one general-order algorithms of computing these perturbation corrections
are implemented and applied up to the eighth order. The results numerically
demonstrate the convergence of the perturbation series at the
finite-temperature vibrational full-configuration-interaction limits and the
expected zero-temperature behaviors, with no signs of Kohn-Luttinger-type
nonconvergence .

<h3>Flexible graphene/boron nitride nanosheets paper for thermal management  of high power electronics</h3>

<br>
<br>
Graphene nanosheets (GNS) paper is widely regarded as a promising candidate
for heat dissipation due to its outstanding thermal conductivity. However, the
accompanied high electrical conductivity makes it unfavorable for thermal
management of high power electronics since it runs a high risk of short
circuits. To eliminate the risk from the high electrical conductivity and
simultaneously maintain the excellent thermal performance, we introduce boron
nitride nanosheets (BNNS) that possess high thermal conductivity but electrical
insulation into the GNS paper. The hybrid paper has a much lower electrical
conductivity but similar thermal performance compared to the pristine GNS
paper. Besides, the flexible hybrid paper exhibits better thermal stability
than pure GNS paper. Our results show that the ability of BNNS to change the
electrical conductivity of paper without affecting its thermal conductivity is
potential for the application of heat management materials with tailored
electrical properties.

<br>
<br>
The magnetic susceptibility of a triangular-graphene-quantum-dot-like system
was examined by using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method. We focused on
three kinds of zigzag edge quantum dots or rings, namely the triangular
graphene quantum ring, twist bilayer triangular graphene quantum dot, and twist
bilayer triangular graphene quantum ring. The
triangular-graphene-quantum-dot-like system exhibits robust edge ferromagnetic
behavior, which is independent of size, monolayer or bilayer, and dot or ring
shape, according to the unbiased numerical results. At half filling, the edge
magnetic susceptibility is increased by on-site interaction, especially in low
temperature region. Applications of this system in spintronics may benefit from
the robust edge ferromagnetic behavior.

<h3>Correlated Insulator and Chern Insulators in Pentalayer Rhombohedral  Stacked Graphene</h3>

<br>
<br>
Rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene is an ideal platform to search for
correlated electron phenomena, due to its pair of flat bands touching at zero
energy and further tunability by an electric field. Furthermore, its
valley-dependent Berry phase at zero energy points to possible topological
states when the pseudospin symmetry is broken by electron correlation. However,
experimental explorations of these opportunities are very limited so far, due
to a lack of devices with optimized layer numbers and configurations. Here we
present electron transport measurements of hBN-encapsulated pentalayer graphene
at down to 100 milli-Kelvin. We observed a correlated insulating state with
>MOhm resistance at zero charge density and zero displacement field, where the
tight-binding calculation predicts a metallic ground state. By increasing the
displacement field, we observed a Chern insulator state with C = -5 and two
other states with C = -3 at a low magnetic field of ~1 Tesla. At high
displacement fields and charge densities, we observed isospin-polarized
quarter- and half-metals. Therefore, rhombohedral-stacked pentalayer graphene
is the first graphene system to exhibit two different types of Fermi-surface
instabilities: driven by a pair of flat bands touching at zero energy, and by
the Stoner mechanism in a single flat band. Our results demonstrate a new
direction to explore intertwined electron correlation and topology phenomena in
natural graphitic materials without the need of moir\'e superlattice
engineering.

<h3>Charge transport in BAs and the role of two-phonon scattering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03159" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03159</a>
<br>
<i>Iretomiwa Esho, Austin Minnich</i>
<br>
<br>
The semiconductor BAs has drawn significant interest due to experimental
reports of simultaneous high thermal conductivity and ambipolar charge
mobility. The \textit{ab~initio} prediction of high electron and hole mobility
assumed the dominance of charge carrier scattering by one phonon. Recently,
higher-order electron-phonon scattering processes in polar and non-polar
semiconductors have been reported to have a non-negligible impact on charge
transport properties, suggesting they may play a role in BAs as well. Here, we
report an \textit{ab~initio} study of two-phonon electron and hole scattering
processes in BAs. We find that inclusion of these higher-order processes
reduces the computed room temperature electron and hole mobility in BAs by
around 40\% from the one-phonon value, resulting in an underestimate of
experimental values by a similar percentage. We suggest an experimental
approach to test these predictions using luminescence spectroscopy that is
applicable to the defective samples which are presently available.

<h3>Integrating Magnons for Quantum Information</h3>

Magnons, the quanta of collective spin excitations in magnetically ordered
materials, have distinct properties that make them uniquely appealing for
quantum information applications. They can have ultra-small wavelengths down to
the nanometer scale even at microwave frequencies. They can provide coupling to
a diverse set of other quantum excitations, and their inherently gyrotropic
dynamics forms the basis for pronounced non-reciprocities. In this article we
discuss what the current research challenges are for integrating magnetic
materials into quantum information systems and provide a perspective on how to
address them.

Evaluating the speed of a physical observable plays a pivotal role in
understanding and controlling nonequilibrium dynamics of a system. We here
elucidate that the speed of an observable of our interest can be tighter
bounded when we have knowledge of other observables, such as experimentally
accessible ones or conserved quantities. We prove this by introducing a new
concept, "quantum velocity limit," which is a universal inequality of a
velocity vector for multiple observables and improves conventional speed limits
for a single observable. We first derive an information-theoretical velocity
limit in terms of the generalized correlation matrix of the observables and the
quantum Fisher information. The velocity limit has various novel consequences,
some of which are particularly noteworthy: (I) Conservation law in the system,
a fundamental ingredient of quantum dynamics, can improve the velocity and
speed limits through the correlation between the observables and conserved
quantities; (II) Speed of an observable can be bounded by a nontrivial lower
bound from the information on another observable, while most of the previous
speed limits provide only upper bounds; (III) There exists a new tradeoff
relation in nonequilibrium quantum statistical mechanics, i.e., speeds of
uncorrelated observables cannot be simultaneously large; (IV) Velocity and
speed limits for observables on a subsystem in locally interacting many-body
systems remain convergent even in the thermodynamic limit, unlike the naive
application of the conventional speed limits. Moreover, we discover another
distinct velocity limit for multiple observables on the basis of the local
conservation law of probability current, which becomes advantageous for
macroscopic transitions of multiple quantities.

<h3>Enhanced photostrictive actuation in freestanding ferroelectric  membranes</h3>

<br>
Complex oxides offer a range of functional properties and recent advances in
fabrication of freestanding membranes of these oxides have enabled enhanced
functionality and novel manipulation strategies. Here, we demonstrate
photoactuation on freestanding thin film resonators of ferroelectric Barium
Titanate (BaTiO$_3$) and paraelectric Strontium Titanate (SrTiO$_3$). The
membranes act as nano-drums, oscillating at their natural resonance frequency
when illuminated by a frequency-modulated laser. Upon illumination, large
out-of-plane deflections develop in BaTiO$_3$ membranes, two orders of
magnitude larger than in SrTiO$_3$ ones, providing evidence for a ferroelectric
origin of their large photoresponse. Time-resolved X-ray micro-diffraction
under illumination and temperature-dependent vibrometry provide combined
evidence for a photostrictive strain in BaTiO$_3$ originated from partial
screening of polarization by photo-excited carriers. These findings emphasise
the pivotal role of light-matter interaction and its manifestation in
ferroelectrics such as photostriction, and demonstrate the potential of
freestanding ferroelectric membranes as wireless remote optomechanical devices
for applications such as photo-actuators and sensors.

<h3>Micromechanical measurements of local plastic events in granular  materials</h3>

<br>
<br>
Understanding the relationship between micromechanics and macroscopic plastic
deformation is vital for elucidating the deformation mechanism of amorphous
solids, such as granular materials. In this study, we directly measure T1
events, which are topological rearrangements of particles, and the associated
microscopic stresses in dense packings of photoelastic disks under pure shear.
We observe a remarkable similarity between the evolution of the total number of
T1 events and the global stress-strain curve. The competition between the birth
and death of T1 events establishes a dynamic equilibrium after the yield
strain, contributing to the overall plastic behavior. Despite the erratic
stress fluctuations of individual T1 events, the local stresses decrease on
average once T1 events occur, indicating their soft characteristics.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the microscopic stress fluctuations exhibit a
long-range anisotropic spatial correlation similar to the Eschelby character,
but with a distinct scaling of $r^{-1.5}$. Interestingly, we also find a
striking similarity in the correlation functions of T1 and non-T1 regions.
These findings establish a significant connection between macroscopic
mechanical behavior and the elementary deformation of T1 events, shedding light
on the fundamental understanding of granular materials as amorphous solids with
contact-scale plastic deformation.

We introduce 'single-particle-exact density functional theory' (1pEx-DFT), a
novel density functional approach that represents all single-particle
contributions to the energy with exact functionals. Here, we parameterize
interaction energy functionals by utilizing two new schemes for constructing
density matrices from 'participation numbers' of the single-particle states of
quantum many-body systems. These participation numbers play the role of the
variational variables akin to the particle densities in standard orbital-free
density functional theory. We minimize the total energies with the help of
evolutionary algorithms and obtain ground-state energies that are typically
accurate at the one-percent level for our proof-of-principle simulations that
comprise interacting Fermi gases as well as the electronic structure of atoms
and ions, with and without relativistic corrections. We thereby illustrate the
ingredients and practical features of 1pEx-DFT and reveal its potential of
becoming an accurate, scalable, and transferable technology for simulating
mesoscopic quantum many-body systems.

Non-Abelian topological phases (NATPs) are highly sought-after candidate
states for quantum computing and communication while lacking straightforward
configuration and manipulation, especially for classical waves. In this work,
we exploit novel braid-type couplings among a pair of triple-component acoustic
dipoles, which act as functional elements with effective imaginary couplings.
Sequencing them in one dimension allows us to generate acoustic NATPs in a
compact yet reciprocal Hermitian system. We further provide the whole phase
diagram that encompasses all i, j, and k non-Abelian phases, and directly
demonstrate their unique quotient relations via different endpoint states. Our
NATPs based on real-space braiding may inspire the exploration of acoustic
devices with non-commutative characters.

<h3>Effect of ring-exchange interactions in the extended Kitaev honeycomb  model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03258" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03258</a>
<br>
<i>Jiucai Wang, Zheng-Xin Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the possible triple-$\bf Q$ classical order in the Kitaev
candidate material Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, we investigate microscopic models that
may stabilize the triple-$\bf Q$ order by studying an extended Kitaev honeycomb
model with ring-exchange interactions (namely, $K$-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$-$J_{\rm
R}$ model) using variational Monte Carlo method. It turns out that with
positive ring-exchange interaction $J_{\rm R}>0$ there indeed appears an exotic
non-collinear triple-$\bf Q$ ordered state featured by three Bragg peaks at
symmetry-related M points in the crystallographic Brillouin zone. A magnetic
field in the honeycomb plane can suppress the triple-$\bf Q$ order and induce a
gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) with 8 cones. Furthermore, with the increase
of $J_{\rm R}$ a proximate Kitaev spin liquid with eight Majorana cones labeled
as the PKSL8 is found which is very stable under a large range of $\Gamma$
interactions. The PKSL8 state shares the same projective symmetry group with
the Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) which is located at small $\Gamma$ and $J_{\rm
R}$. In a weak magnetic field applied normal to the honeycomb plane, the PKSL8
turns into an Abelian chiral spin liquid with Chern number $\nu=-4$, unlike the
KSL which yields a chiral spin liquid with $\nu=1$. Since the triple-$\bf Q$
phase is adjacent to two QSLs in the phase diagram, our work suggests that it
is more hopeful to experimentally realize the exotic QSL phases starting from
the triple-$\bf Q$ order.

The strongly correlated two-dimensional electron liquid within
SmTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$/SmTiO$_3$ quantum well structures exhibits a pseudogap
phase when the quantum well width is sufficiently narrow. Using low-temperature
transport and optical experiments that drive the quantum-well system out of
equilibrium, we find evidence of mobile, long-lived, negatively-charged
quasiparticles, consistent with the idea that the pseudogap phase arises from
strongly bound electron pairs.

<br>
<br>
We report a study of NiBi$_3$ single crystals by means of
electrical-resistivity-, magnetization-, and muon-spin rotation and relaxation
($\mu$SR) measurements. As a single crystal, NiBi$_3$ adopts a needle-like
shape and exhibits bulk superconductivity with $T_c \approx 4.1$ K. By applying
magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the $b$-axis of NiBi$_3$, we
establish that its lower- and upper critical fields, as well as the magnetic
penetration depths show slightly different values, suggesting a weakly
anisotropic superconductivity. In both cases, the zero-temperature upper
critical fields are much smaller than the Pauli-limit value, indicating that
the superconducting state is constrained by the orbital pair breaking. The
temperature evolution of the superfluid density, obtained from transverse-field
$\mu$SR, reveals a fully-gapped superconductivity in NiBi$_3$, with a shared
superconducting gap $\Delta_0$ = 2.1 $k_\mathrm{B}$$T_c$ and magnetic
penetration depths $\lambda_0$ = 223 and 210 nm for $H \parallel b$- and $H
\perp b$, respectively. The lack of spontaneous fields below $T_c$ indicates
that time-reversal symmetry is preserved in NiBi$_3$. The absence of a fast
muon-spin relaxation and/or precession in the zero-field $\mu$SR spectra
definitely rules out any type of magnetic ordering in NiBi$_3$ single crystals.
Overall, our investigation suggests that NiBi$_3$ behaves as a conventional
$s$-type superconductor.

<h3>Towards efficient computational screening of strongly correlated  materials -- Multi-orbital phenomenology within the ghost Gutzwiller  approximation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03329" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03329</a>
<br>
<i>Carlos Mejuto-Zaera, Michele Fabrizio</i>
<br>
<br>
The theoretical description of strongly correlated materials relies on the
ability to simultaneously capture, on equal footing, the different competing
energy scales. Unfortunately, existing approaches are either typically
extremely computationally demanding, making systematic screenings of correlated
materials challenging or are limited to a subset of observables of interest.
The recently developed ghost Gutzwiller Ansatz (gGut) has shown great promise
to remedy this dichotomy. It is based on a self-consistency condition around
the comparatively simple static one-particle reduced density matrix, yet has
been shown to provide accurate static and dynamical observables in one-band
systems. In this work, we investigate its potential role in the modelling of
correlated materials, by applying it to several multi-orbital lattice models.
Our results confirm the accuracy at lower computational cost of the gGut, and
show promise for its application to materials research.

<h3>Complexity of spin configurations dynamics due to unitary evolution and  periodic projective measurements</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the Hamiltonian dynamics of a many-body quantum system subjected to
periodic projective measurements which leads to probabilistic cellular automata
dynamics. Given a sequence of measured values, we characterize their dynamics
by performing a principal component analysis. The number of principal
components required for an almost complete description of the system, which is
a measure of complexity we refer to as PCA complexity, is studied as a function
of the Hamiltonian parameters and measurement intervals. We consider different
Hamiltonians that describe interacting, non-interacting, integrable, and
non-integrable systems, including random local Hamiltonians and translational
invariant random local Hamiltonians. In all these scenarios, we find that the
PCA complexity grows rapidly in time before approaching a plateau. The dynamics
of the PCA complexity can vary quantitatively and qualitatively as a function
of the Hamiltonian parameters and measurement protocol. Importantly, the
dynamics of PCA complexity present behavior that is considerably less sensitive
to the specific system parameters for models which lack simple local dynamics,
as is often the case in non-integrable models. In particular, we point out a
figure of merit that considers the local dynamics and the measurement direction
to predict the sensitivity of the PCA complexity dynamics to the system
parameters.

<h3>Rich structural polymorphism of monolayer C60 from cluster rotation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03339" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03339</a>
<br>
<i>Xueao Li, Fan Zhang, Xuefei Wang, Weiwei Gao, Jijun Zhao</i>
<br>
<br>
The recent experimental fabrication of monolayer and few-layer C60 polymers
paves the way for synthesizing two-dimensional cluster-assembled materials.
Compared to atoms with the SO(3) symmetry, clusters as superatoms (e.g., C60)
have an additional rotational degree of freedom, greatly enriching the phase
spaces of superatom-assembled materials. Using first-principles calculations,
we find the energy barriers of cluster rotation in quasi-tetragonal monolayer
C60 structures are rather low (about 10 meV/atom). The small rotational energy
barriers lead to a series of tetragonal C60 polymorphs with energies that are
close to the experimental quasi-tetragonal (expt-qT) phase. Similarly, several
dynamically stable quasi-hexagonal monolayer C60 structures are found to have
energies within 7 meV/atom above the experimental quasi-hexagonal phase. Our
calculations demonstrate photo-excited electron-hole pairs and electrostatic
doping of electrons can effectively modulate the relative energies of
quasi-tetragonal C60 polymorphs. Particularly, the unstable monolayer expt-qT
phase becomes dynamically stable when it is electrostatically doped with
electrons. In contrast, the relative energies between different quasi-hexagonal
polymorphs are insensitive to electrostatic doping of electrons.

<h3>Finite-size analysis in neural network classification of critical  phenomena</h3>

<br>
<i>Vladislav Chertenkov, Evgeni Burovski, Lev Shchur</i>
<br>
<br>
We analyze the problem of supervised learning of ferromagnetic phase
transitions from the statistical physics perspective. We consider two systems
in two universality classes, the two-dimensional Ising model and
two-dimensional Baxter-Wu model, and perform careful finite-size analysis of
the results of the supervised learning of the phases of each model. We find
that the variance of the neural network (NN) output function (VOF) as a
function of temperature has a peak in the critical region. Qualitatively, the
VOF is related to the classification rate of the NN. We find that the width of
the VOF peak displays the finite-size scaling governed by the correlation
length exponent, $\nu$, of the universality class of the model. We check this
conclusion using several NN architectures -- a fully connected NN, a
convolutional NN and several members of the ResNet family -- and discuss the
accuracy of the extracted critical exponents $\nu$.

<h3>Nonlinear terahertz Néel spin-orbit torques in antiferromagnetic  Mn$_2$Au</h3>

<br>
<br>
Antiferromagnets have large potential for ultrafast coherent switching of
magnetic order with minimum heat dissipation. In novel materials such as
Mn$_2$Au and CuMnAs, electric rather than magnetic fields may control
antiferromagnetic order by N\'eel spin-orbit torques (NSOTs), which have,
however, not been observed on ultrafast time scales yet. Here, we excite
Mn$_2$Au thin films with phase-locked single-cycle terahertz electromagnetic
pulses and monitor the spin response with femtosecond magneto-optic probes. We
observe signals whose symmetry, dynamics, terahertz-field scaling and
dependence on sample structure are fully consistent with a uniform in-plane
antiferromagnetic magnon driven by field-like terahertz NSOTs with a torkance
of (150$\pm$50) cm$^2$/A s. At incident terahertz electric fields above 500
kV/cm, we find pronounced nonlinear dynamics with massive N\'eel-vector
deflections by as much as 30{\deg}. Our data are in excellent agreement with a
micromagnetic model which indicates that fully coherent N\'eel-vector switching
by 90{\deg} within 1 ps is within close reach.

<h3>Investigating particle size effects on NMR spectra of ions diffusing in  porous carbons through a mesoscopic model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03371" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03371</a>
<br>
<i>Anagha Sasikumar, Céline Merlet</i>
<br>
<br>
Characterizing ion adsorption and diffusion in porous carbons is essential to
understand the performance of such materials in a range of key technologies
such as energy storage and capacitive deionisation. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique to get insights in these systems
thanks to its ability to distinguish between bulk and adsorbed species and to
its sensitivity to dynamic phenomena. Nevertheless, a clear interpretation of
the experimental results is sometimes rendered difficult by the various factors
affecting NMR spectra. A mesoscopic model to predict NMR spectra of ions
diffusing in carbon particles is adapted to include dynamic exchange between
the intra-particle space and the bulk electrolyte surrounding the particle. A
systematic study of the particle size effect on the NMR spectra for different
distributions of magnetic environments in the porous carbons is conducted. The
model demonstrates the importance of considering a range of magnetic
environments, instead of a single chemical shift value corresponding to
adsorbed species, and of including a range of exchange rates (between in and
out of the particle), instead of a single timescale, to predict realistic NMR
spectra. Depending on the pore size distribution of the carbon particle and the
ratio between bulk and adsorbed species, both the NMR linewidth and peak
positions can be largely influenced by the particle size.

<br>
<br>
Chalcopyrite compounds are extensively explored for their exotic topological
phases and associated phenomena in a variety of experiments. Here, we discuss
the electrical transport properties of a direct energy gap semiconductor
CdGeAs$_{2}$. The observed transverse magnetoresistance (MR) is found to be
around 136% at a temperature of 1.8 K and a magnetic field of 14 T, following
the semiclassical exponent MR $\sim$ $B^{2.18}$. The MR analysis exhibits a
violation of the Kohler rule, suggesting the involvement of multiple carriers
in the system. Below 15 K, with decreasing magnetic field, the MR increases,
leading to the well known quantum interference phenomenon weak localization
(WL). The analysis of the magnetoconductivity data based on the
Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka (HLN) model unveils three dimensional nature of the WL
and the weak spin-orbit coupling in CdGeAs$_{2}$. The phase coherence length
follows the $L_{\phi}$ $\sim$ $T^{-0.66}$ power law, which exhibits the 3D
nature of the observed WL feature.

<br>
<br>
Neural networks can be used to represent quantum states. Here we explore and
compare different strategies for supervised learning of multilayer perceptrons.
In particular, we consider two different loss functions which we refer to as
mean-squared error and overlap, and we test their performance for the wave
function in different phases of matter. For this, we consider the next-nearest
neighbor Ising model because its ground state can be in various different
phases. Of these phases, we focus on the paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, and
pair-antiferromagnetic phases, while for the training we study the role of
batch size, number of samples, and size of the neural network. We observe that
the overlap loss function allows us to train the model better across all
phases, provided one rescales the neural network.

<h3>Symmetry-protected topological phases, conformal criticalities, and  duality in exactly solvable SO($n$) spin chains</h3>

<br>
<i>Sreejith Chulliparambil, Hua-Chen Zhang, Hong-Hao Tu</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce a family of SO($n$)-symmetric spin chains which generalize the
transverse-field Ising chain for $n=1$. These spin chains are defined with
Gamma matrices and can be exactly solved by mapping to $n$ species of itinerant
Majorana fermions coupled to a static $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. Their phase
diagrams include a critical point described by the SO($n$)$_1$
Wess-Zumino-Witten model as well as two distinct gapped phases. We show that
one of the gapped phases is a trivial phase and the other realizes a
symmetry-protected topological phase when $n \geq 2$. These two gapped phases
are proved to be related to each other by a Kramers-Wannier duality.
Furthermore, other elegant structures in the transverse-field Ising chain, such
as the infinite-dimensional Onsager algebra, also carry over to our models.

<br>
<br>
In the Kitaev magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, the existence of a
magnetic-field-induced quantum spin liquid phase and of anyonic excitations are
discussed controversially. We address this elusive, exotic phase via
helicity-dependent Raman scattering and analyze the Raman optical activity of
excitations as a function of magnetic field and temperature. The hotly debated
field regime between 7.5 T and 10.5 T is characterized by clear spectroscopic
signatures such as a plateau of the Raman optical activity of the dominant,
chiral spin-flip excitation. This provides direct evidence for the existence of
a distinct intermediate field regime compatible with a quantum spin liquid
phase.

<br>

Increasing experimental evidence suggests the occurrence of filamentary
superconductivity in different (quasi) two-dimensional physical systems. In
this piece of work, we discuss the proposal that, under certain circumstances,

<i>Joana Fraxanet, Alexandre Dauphin, Maciej Lewenstein, Luca Barbiero, Daniel González-Cuadra</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we investigate a two-dimensional system of ultracold bosonic
atoms inside an optical cavity, and show how photon-mediated interactions give
rise to a plaquette-ordered bond pattern in the atomic ground state. The latter
corresponds to a 2D Peierls transition, generalizing the spontaneous bond
dimmerization driven by phonon-electron interactions in the 1D
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Here the bosonic nature of the atoms plays a
crucial role to generate the phase, as similar generalizations with fermionic
matter do not lead to a plaquette structure. Similar to the SSH model, we show
how this pattern opens a non-trivial topological gap in 2D, resulting in a
higher-order topological phase hosting corner states, that we characterize by
means of a many-body topological invariant and through its entanglement
structure. Finally, we demonstrate how this higher-order topological Peierls
insulator can be readily prepared in atomic experiments through adiabatic
protocols. Our work thus shows how atomic quantum simulators can be harnessed
to investigate novel strongly-correlated topological phenomena beyond those
observed in natural materials.

<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional arrays of magnetically coupled nanomagnets provide a
mesoscopic platform for exploring collective phenomena as well as realizing a
broad range of spintronic devices. In particular, the magnetic coupling plays a
critical role in determining the nature of the cooperative behaviour and
providing new functionalities in nanomagnet-based devices. Here, we create
coupled Ising-like nanomagnets in which the coupling between adjacent
nanomagnetic regions can be reversibly converted between parallel and
antiparallel through solid-state ionic gating. This is achieved with the
voltage-control of magnetic anisotropies in a nanosized region where the
symmetric exchange interaction favours parallel alignment and the antisymmetric
exchange interaction, namely the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, favours
antiparallel alignment. Applying this concept to a two-dimensional lattice, we
demonstrate a voltage-controlled phase transition in artificial spin ices.
Furthermore, we achieve an addressable control of the individual couplings and
realize an electrically programmable Ising network, which opens up new avenues
to design nanomagnet-based logic devices and neuromorphic computers

<br>
<br>
Van der Waals heterostructures show fascinating physics including trapped
moire exciton states, anomalous moire exciton transport, generalized Wigner
crystals, etc. Bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are
characterized by long-lived spatially separated interlayer excitons. Provided a
strong interlayer tunneling, hybrid exciton states consisting of interlayer and
intralayer excitons can be formed. Here, electrons and/or holes are in a
superposition of both layers. Although crucial for optics, dynamics, and
transport, hybrid excitons are usually optically inactive and have therefore
not been directly observed yet. Based on a microscopic and material-specific
theory, we show that time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(tr-ARPES) is the ideal technique to directly visualize these hybrid excitons.
Concretely, we predict a characteristic double-peak ARPES signal arising from
the hybridized hole in the MoS$_2$ homobilayer. The relative intensity is
proportional to the quantum mixture of the two hybrid valence bands at the
$\Gamma$ point. Due to the strong hybridization, the peak separation of more
than 0.5 eV can be resolved in ARPES experiments. Our study provides a concrete
recipe of how to directly visualize hybrid excitons and how to distinguish them
from the usually observed regular excitonic signatures.

<br>
<br>
The formation of angulon, stemming from the rotor (molecule or impurity)
rotating in the quantum many-body field, adds a new member in the
quasiparticle's family and has aroused intensively interests in multiple
research fields. However, the analysis of the coupling strength between the
rotor and its hosting environment remains a challenging task both in theory and
experiment. Here, we develop the all-coupling theory of the angulon by
introducing an unitary transformation, where the renormalization of the
rotational constants for different molecules in the helium nanodroplets are
reproduced, getting excellent agreement with the collected experimental data
during the past decades. Moreover, the strength of molecule-helium coupling and
the effective radius of the solvation shell corotating along with the molecular
rotor could be estimated qualitatively. This model not only provides the
significant enlightenment for analyzing the rotational spectroscopy of
molecules in the phononic environment, but also provides a new method to study
the transfer of the phonon angular momentum in angulon frame.

<br>
<br>
Pauli blockade is a fundamental quantum phenomenon that also serves as a
powerful tool for qubit manipulation and read-out. While most systems exhibit a
simple even-odd pattern of double-dot Pauli spin blockade due to the preferred
singlet pairing of spins, the additional valley degree of freedom offered by
bilayer graphene greatly alters this pattern. Inspecting bias-triangle
measurements at double-dot charge degeneracies with up to four electrons in
each dot reveals a much richer double-dot Pauli blockade catalogue with both
spin and/or valley blockade. In addition, we use single-dot Kondo effect
measurements to substantiate our understanding of the three- and four-particle
state spectra by analyzing their magnetic field dependence. With high
controllability and reported long valley- and spin-relaxation times, bilayer
graphene is a rising platform for hosting semiconductor quantum dot qubits. A
thorough understanding of state spectra is crucial for qubit design and
manipulation, and the rich Pauli blockade catalogue provides an abundance of
novel qubit operational possibilities and opportunities to explore intriguing
spin and valley physics.

<h3>Type-I to type-II band alignment switching for (In,Ga)(As,Sb)/GaAs/GaP  quantum dots overgrown by a thin GaSb capping layer</h3>

<i>Elisa Maddalena Sala, Petr Klenovský</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the optical and theoretical properties of (In,Ga)(As,Sb)/GaAs
quantum dots (QDs) embedded in a GaP (100) matrix, which are overgrown by a
thin GaSb capping layer with variable thickness. QD samples are studied by
temperature-dependent photoluminescence, and the results analyzed with the help
of theoretical simulations by eight-band~\textbf{k$\cdot$p}, with multiparticle
corrections using the configuration interaction. We reveal a type-I to type-II
band alignment switching when QDs are overgrown by a GaSb layer with a
thickness larger than one monolayer. Moreover, we observe a temperature driven
blueshift of the quantum dot luminescence, which is explained by decomposing
the spectra into sum of Gaussians. Our analysis reveals that the GaSb overlayer
causes switching of the intensity between $\Gamma$- and L-transitions, making
the ${\bf k}$-indirect electron-hole transition in type-II regime to be
optically more radiant than the $\Gamma$-direct one. Finally, we provide
theoretical expectations for the storage time for (In,Ga)(As,Sb)/GaAs/GaP QDs
overgrown by the GaSb layer with an AlP barrier underneath, to be embedded in a
nanomemory device. We find that by increasing the thickness of the GaSb layer
from 0 to 1.5~monolayers (MLs) leads to an increase in the storage time of four
orders of magnitude, from 1 hour to up almost a year, rendering such QDs very
promising candidates as storage units for nanomemory devices.

The charge-density wave (CDW) phase in the layered transition-metal
dichalcogenide VTe$_{2}$ is strongly coupled to the band inversion involving
vanadium and tellurium orbitals. In particular, this coupling leads to a
selective disappearance of the Dirac-type states that characterize the normal
phase, when the CDW phase sets in. Here, by means of broadband time-resolved
optical spectroscopy (TR-OS), we investigate the ultrafast reflectivity changes
caused by collective and single particle excitations in the CDW ground state of
VTe$_{2}$. Remarkably, our measurements show the presence of two collective
(amplitude) modes of the CDW ground state. By applying a double-pulse
excitation scheme, we show the possibility to manipulate these modes,
demonstrating a more efficient way to control and perturb the CDW phase in
VTe$_{2}$.

<h3>Minority-spin conducting states in Fe substituted pyrite CoS$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03551" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03551</a>
<br>
<i>Anustup Mukherjee, Alaska Subedi</i>
<br>
<br>
There has been a longstanding debate whether the pyrite CoS$_2$ or its alloys
with FeS$_2$ are half metallic. We argue using first principles calculations
that there is a finite occupation of minority-spin states at the Fermi level
throughout the series Co$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$S$_2$. Although the exchange-correlation
functional influences the specifics of the electronic structure, we observe a
similar trend with increasing Fe concentration in both LDA and GGA
calculations. Specifically, even as band filling is decreased through Fe
substitution, the lowest-lying conduction band in the minority-spin channel
broadens such that these states keep getting lowered relative to the Fermi
level, which is contrary to the expectations from a rigid band picture.
Furthermore, the exchange splitting decreases as more Co atoms are replaced by
Fe, and this again brings the minority-spin states closer to the Fermi level.
These two mechanisms, in conjunction with the experimental observation that
minority-spin bands cross the Fermi level in stoichiometric CoS$_2$, indicate
that minority-spin charge carriers will always be present in
Co$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$S$_2$.

We studied the exciton properties in double layers of transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) with a dielectric spacer between the layers. We
developed a method based on an expansion of Chebyshev polynomials to solve the
Wannier equation for the exciton. Corrections to the quasiparticle bandgap due
to the dielectric environment were also included via the exchange self-energy
calculated within a continuum model. We systematically investigated hetero
double-layer systems for TMDs with chemical compounds MX2, showing the
dependence of the inter- and intralayer excitons binding energies as a function
of the spacer width and the dielectric constant. Moreover, we discussed how the
exciton energy and its wave function, which includes the effects of the
changing bandgap, depend on the geometric system setup.

We present a general-purpose parameterization of the atomic cluster expansion
(ACE) for magnesium. The ACE shows outstanding transferability over a broad
range of atomic environments and captures physical properties of bulk as well
as defective Mg phases in excellent agreement with reference first-principles
calculations. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and the predictive
power of ACE by calculating properties of extended defects and by evaluating
the P-T phase diagram covering temperatures up to 3000 K and pressures up to 80
GPa. We compare the ACE predictions with those of other interatomic potentials,
including the embedded-atom method, an angular-dependent potential, and a
recently developed neural network potential. The comparison reveals that ACE is
the only model that is able to predict correctly the phase diagram in close
agreement with experimental observations.

Altermagnetism is a recently identified magnetic symmetry class combining
characteristics of conventional collinear ferromagnets and antiferromagnets,
that were regarded as mutually exclusive, and enabling phenomena and
functionalities unparalleled in either of the two traditional elementary
magnetic classes. In this work we use symmetry and ab initio theory to explore
X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) in the altermagnetic class. Our
results highlight the distinct phenomenology in altermagnets of this
time-reversal symmetry breaking response, and its potential utility for
element-specific spectroscopy and microscopy in altermagnets. As a
representative material for our XMCD study we choose $\alpha$-MnTe with the
compensated antiparallel magnetic order in which an anomalous Hall effect has
been already demonstrated both in theory and experiment. The predicted
magnitude of XMCD lies well within the resolution of existing experimental
techniques.

The penetration of atomic hydrogen through defect-free graphene was generally
predicted to have a barrier of at least several eV, which is much higher than
the 1 eV barrier measured for hydrogen-gas permeation through pristine graphene
membranes. Herein, our density functional theory calculations show that
ripples, which are ubiquitous in atomically thin crystals and mostly overlooked
in the previous simulations, can significantly reduce the barriers for all
steps constituting the mechanism of hydrogen-gas permeation through graphene
membranes, including dissociation of hydrogen molecules, reconstruction of the
dissociated hydrogen atoms and their flipping across graphene. Especially, the
flipping barrier of hydrogen atoms from a cluster configuration is found to
decrease rapidly down to <1 eV with increasing ripples' curvature. The
estimated hydrogen permeation rates by fully considering the distribution of
ripples with all realistic curvatures and the major reaction steps that
occurred on them are quite close to the experimental measurements. Our work
provides insights into the fundamental understanding of hydrogen-gas permeation
through graphene membranes and emphasizes the importance of nanoscale
non-flatness (ripples) in explaining many surface and transport phenomena (for
example, functionalization, corrosion and separation) in graphene and other
two-dimensional materials.

<h3>Suppressed Polaronic Conductivity induced Sensor Response Enhancement in  Mo doped V2O5 Nanowires</h3>

In this paper, we show the direct correlation between suppression of
polaronic oxygen vacancy defect (Vo) density and gas sensor response of 1 at%
Mo doped $V_2O_5$ (MVONW) nanowires. Doping 1 at% $Mo^{5+}$ leads to
substitution at the $V^{5+}$ site in $V_2O_5$ nanowires (VONW) and thereby
reduction in Vo defects. This in turn affects the charge carrier hopping sites
and subsequently enhances the sensor response at lower temperatures
($<320^oC$). The $Mo^{5+}$ dopants lead to the lowering of Fermi energy (EF)
towards valence band maxima due to reduced $V_o$ donor density. The polaron
suppression is confirmed with activation energy of polaron hopping, increasing
from 195 meV to 385 meV in VONW and MVONW respectively. As a result, the
response to ethanol gas enhanced as the depletion width is widened for the
given cross-section of the nanowires. This may lead to large depletion
controlled cross-sectional area and thereby better sensitivity. At about
$350^oC$ VONW show change in slope of resistance vs temperature (MIT) which is
not observed in case of MVONW. This is attributed to presence of enhanced
non-stoichiometry of V ion resulting in metallic behaviour and accompanied with
sudden rise in sensor response at this temperature. Moreover, the absence of
MIT may be attributed to lack of such sudden rise in response in MVONW.

Quaternary III-V semiconductors are one of the major promising material
classes in optoelectronics. The bandgap and its character, direct or indirect,
are the most important fundamental properties determining the performance and
characteristics of optoelectronic devices. Experimental approaches screening a
large range of possible combinations of III- and V-elements with variations in
composition and strain are impractical for every target application. We present
a combination of accurate first-principles calculations and machine learning
based approaches to predict the properties of the bandgap for quaternary III-V
semiconductors. By learning bandgap magnitudes and their nature at density
functional theory accuracy based solely on the composition and strain features
of the materials as an input, we develop a computationally efficient yet highly
accurate machine learning approach that can be applied to a large number of
compositions and strain values. This allows for a computationally efficient
prediction of a vast range of materials under different strains, offering the
possibility for virtual screening of multinary III-V materials for
optoelectronic applications.

<h3>Particle-based model of active skyrmions</h3>

<br>
<br>
Motivated by recent experimental results that reveal rich collective dynamics
of thousands-to-millions of active liquid crystal skyrmions we have developed a
coarse grained particle-based model of the dynamics of skyrmions in dilute
regime. The basic physical mechanism of the skyrmion motion is related to the
non-reciprocal rotational dynamics of the liquid crystal director field when
the electric field is turned {\it on} and {\it off}. Guided by fine grained
results of the Frank-Oseen continuum approach, we have mapped this
non-reciprocal director distortions onto an effective force acting
asymmetrically upon switching the electrical field {\it on} or {\it off}. The
coarse grained model correctly reproduces the skyrmion dynamics, including the
velocity reversal as a function of the frequency of a pulse width modulated
driving voltage. We have also obtained approximate analytical expressions for
the phenomenological model parameters encoding their dependence upon the
cholesteric pitch and the strength of the electric field. This has been
achieved by fitting coarse grained skyrmion trajectories to those determined in
the framework of the Frank-Oseen model.

The organization of cells within tissues plays a vital role in various
biological processes, including development and morphogenesis. As a result,
understanding how cells self-organize in tissues has been an active area of
research. In our study, we explore a mechanistic model of cellular organization
that represents cells as force dipoles that interact with each other via the
tissue, which we model as an elastic medium. By conducting numerical
simulations using this model, we are able to observe organizational features
that are consistent with those obtained from vertex model simulations. This
approach provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms that govern
cellular organization within tissues, which can help us better understand the
processes involved in development and disease.

<br>
<br>
Motivated by a recent experiment on a square-lattice Rydberg atom array
realizing a long-range dipolar XY model [Chen et al., Nature (2023)], we
numerically study the model's equilibrium properties. We obtain the phase
diagram, critical properties, entropies, variance of the magnetization, and
site-resolved correlation functions. We consider both ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic interactions and apply quantum Monte Carlo and
pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group techniques, generalizing the
latter to a U(1) symmetric setting. Our simulations open the door to directly
performing many-body thermometry in dipolar Rydberg atom arrays. Moreover, our
results provide new insights into the experimental data, suggesting the
presence of intriguing quasi-equilibrium features, and motivating future
studies on the non-equilibrium dynamics of the system.

<h3>Study the effect of scratching depth and ceramic-metal ratio on the  scratch behavior of NbC/Nb Ceramic/Metal nano-laminates using molecular  dynamics simulation and machine learning</h3>

The tribological characteristics of NbC/Nb ceramic/metal nano-laminate
(CMNLs) coatings were studied using molecular dynamics atomistic simulations of
nano-indentation and nano-scratching by penetrating and moving a spherical
indenter into the models. The effect of individual metallic or ceramic layer
thickness and penetration depth on the scratching behavior of the NbC/Nb
nanolaminates were investigated. The results showed generally the individual
metallic and ceramic layer thickness play a significant role. However, some
punctures were seen on the top ceramic layer of some model which can
significantly after the scratching behavior by reducing the effect the
individual metallic and ceramic layer thickness on the scratching behavior. The
reason for being punctured models is the thickness of the top ceramic layer is
too low that the indenter can easily puncture the ceramic layer instead of
pushing the atoms of ceramic. The least thickness that can resist the indenter
can be defined as a critical thickness which is dependent on the indenter size
and penetration depth. In the later part of this paper, machine learning has
been employed to reduce the computational cost and it is shown that the machine
learning based model can predict the friction coefficient with R- squared value
0.958.

<h3>Chern mosaic and ideal flat bands in equal-twist trilayer graphene</h3>

We study trilayer graphene arranged in a staircase stacking configuration
with equal consecutive twist angle. On top of the moir\'e cristalline pattern,
a supermoir\'e long-wavelength modulation emerges that we treat adiabatically.
For each valley, we find that the two central bands are topological with Chern
numbers $C=\pm 1$ forming a Chern mosaic at the supermoir\'e scale. The Chern
domains are centered around the high-symmetry stacking points ABA or BAB and
they are separated by gapless lines connecting the AAA points, where the
spectrum is fully connected. In the chiral limit and at a magic angle of
$\theta \sim 1.69^\circ$, we prove that the central bands are exactly flat with
ideal quantum curvature at ABA and BAB. Furthermore, we decompose them
analytically as a superposition of an intrinsic color-entangled state with $\pm
2$ and a Landau level state with Chern number $\mp 1$. To connect with
experimental configurations, we also explore the non-chiral limit with finite
corrugation and find that the topological Chern mosaic pattern is indeed robust
and the central bands are still well separated from remote bands.

K. Alex M\"uller started his scientific career in 1958 when he was about
thirty-one years old. After his wife passed away and being in his nineties, his
interest in physics gradually faded. In those years shortly before he passed
away, on January 9, 2023, he was no longer interested in superconductivity or
ferroelectricity, he had become essentially devoted to philosophy and
psychology. It is of note that altogether his research in physics comprised
sixty years of activity. Almost in the middle of this period, he was awarded
the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of high-temperature
superconductivity in ceramic copper oxides in 1987. This discovery made him
truly famous. While most researchers are familiar with his Nobel Prize work,
many are not aware of the fact that K. Alex M\"uller was already an acclaimed
scientist before that and highly respected in the field of perovskite oxides,
ferroelectricity, structural phase transitions, Jahn-Teller physics, electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and, especially so in the properties of SrTiO3.
