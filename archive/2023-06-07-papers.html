<h3>Electronic ratchet effect in a moiré system: signatures of excitonic  ferroelectricity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03922" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03922</a>

Electronic ferroelectricity represents a new paradigm where spontaneous
symmetry breaking driven by electronic correlations, in contrast to traditional
lattice-driven ferroelectricity, leads to the formation of electric dipoles.
Despite the potential application advantages arising from its electronic
nature, switchable electronic ferroelectricity remains exceedingly rare. Here,
we report the discovery of an electronic ratchet effect that manifests itself
as switchable electronic ferroelectricity in a layer-contrasting graphene-boron
nitride moir\'e heterostructure. Our engineered layer-asymmetric moir\'e
potential landscapes result in layer-polarized localized and itinerant
electronic subsystems. At particular fillings of the localized subsystem, we
find a ratcheting injection of itinerant carriers in a non-volatile manner,
leading to a highly unusual ferroelectric response. Strikingly, the remnant
polarization can be stabilized at multiple (quasi-continuous) states with
behavior markedly distinct from known ferroelectrics. Our experimental
observations, simulations, and theoretical analysis suggest that dipolar
excitons are the driving force and elementary ferroelectric units in our
system. This signifies a new type of electronic ferroelectricity where the
formation of dipolar excitons with aligned moments generates a macroscopic
polarization and leads to an electronically-driven ferroelectric response,
which we term excitonic ferroelectricity. Such new ferroelectrics, driven by
quantum objects like dipolar excitons, could pave the way to innovative quantum
analog memory and synaptic devices.

<h3>Proof of Gauge-Invariance of Magnetic Susceptibility of Topologically  Trivial Insulators in the Independent Particle Approximation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03946" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03946</a>
<br>
<i>Alistair H. Duff, J. E. Sipe</i>
<br>
<br>
We have derived an expression for the magnetic susceptibility of
topologically trivial insulators, however an important consideration for any
response tensor is whether it is gauge-invariant. By this we refer to the
gauge-freedom in choosing the Bloch functions one uses in a computation since
multiplication by an arbitrary $\textbf{k}$-dependent complex phase produces
equally valid Bloch functions. Additionally Wannier functions, which can be
constructed by a unitary mixing of the Bloch functions, are a useful basis for
computation due to their localized properties, but are strongly non-unique.
Therefore, we show that the theoretical expression we derived is independent of
the choice of Bloch functions or Wannier functions used, and thus is
gauge-invariant in this sense.

<h3>Effects of local incompressibility on the rheology of composite  biopolymer networks</h3>

<br>
<br>
Fibrous networks such as collagen are common in biological systems. Recent
theoretical and experimental efforts have shed light on the mechanics of single
component networks. Most real biopolymer networks, however, are composites made
of elements with different rigidity. For instance, the extracellular matrix in
mammalian tissues consists of stiff collagen fibers in a background matrix of
flexible polymers such as hyaluronic acid (HA). The interplay between different
biopolymer components in such composite networks remains unclear. In this work,
we use 2D coarse-grained models to study the nonlinear strain-stiffening
behavior of composites. We introduce a local volume constraint to model the
incompressibility of HA. We also perform rheology experiments on composites of
collagen with HA. We demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that the
linear shear modulus of composite networks can be increased by approximately an
order of magnitude above the corresponding moduli of the pure components. Our
model shows that this synergistic effect can be understood in terms of the
local incompressibility of HA, which acts to suppress density fluctuations of
the collagen matrix with which it is entangled.

<h3>A machine learning potential-based generative algorithm for on-lattice  crystal structure prediction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03989" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03989</a>
<br>
<i>Vadim Sotskov, Alexander V. Shapeev, Evgeny V. Podryabinkin</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a method for crystal structure prediction based on a new structure
generation algorithm and on-lattice machine learning interatomic potentials.
Our algorithm generates the atomic configurations assigning atomic species to
sites of the given lattice, and uses cluster expansion or low-rank potential to
evaluate their energy. We demonstrate two benefits of such approach. First, our
structure generation algorithm offers a ``smart'' configurational space
sampling, targeting low-energy structures which significantly reduces
computational costs. Second, the application of machine learning interatomic
potentials significantly reduces the number of DFT calculations. We discuss how
our algorithm resembles the latent diffusion models for image generation. We
demonstrate the efficiency of our method by constructing the convex hull of
Nb-Mo-Ta-W system, including binary and ternary Nb-W and Mo-Ta-W subsystems. We
found new binary, ternary, and quaternary stable structures that are not
reported in the AFLOW database which we choose as our baseline. Due to the
computational efficiency of our method we anticipate that it can pave the way
towards efficient high-throughput discovery of multicomponent materials.

<h3>Competing Relaxation Channels in Continuously Polydisperse Fluids: A  Mode-Coupling Study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03992" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03992</a>
<br>
<i>Corentin C. L. Laudicina, Ilian Pihlajamaa, Liesbeth M. C. Janssen</i>
<br>
<br>
Systems with a high degree of size polydispersity are becoming standard in
the computational study of deeply supercooled liquids. In this work we perform
a systematic analysis of continuously polydisperse fluids as a function of the
degree of polydispersity within the framework of the Mode-Coupling Theory of
the glass transition (MCT). Our results show that a high degree of
polydispersity tends to stabilize the liquid phase against vitrification, the
magnitude of which depends on the shape of the polydispersity distribution.
Further, we report on a separation between the localization lengths of the
smallest and largest particles. A diameter-resolved analysis of the
intermediate scattering functions reveals that this separation significantly
stretches the relaxation patterns, which we quantitatively study by an analysis
of the dynamical exponents predicted by the theory. Our observations have
strong implications for our understanding of the nature of dynamical
heterogeneities and localization lengths in continuously polydisperse systems.
These results suggest that the dynamics of the smallest particles is of central
importance to understand structural relaxation of continuously size
polydisperse fluids, already in the mildly supercooled regime where MCT is
usually applicable.

<h3>Time-reversal switching responses in antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04017" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04017</a>
<br>
<i>Satoru Hayami, Hiroaki Kusunose</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose emergent time-reversal switching responses in antiferromagnets,
which are triggered by an accompanying magnetic toroidal monopole, i.e.,
time-reversal odd scalar distinct from electric and magnetic monopoles. We show
that simple collinear antiferromagnets exhibit unconventional responses to
external electric and/or magnetic fields once magnetic symmetry accommodates
the magnetic toroidal monopole. We specifically demonstrate that the emergence
of the magnetic toroidal monopole in antiferromagnets enables us to control
rotational distortion by an external magnetic field, switch vortex-type
antiferromagnetic structure by an external electric field, and convert
right/left-handedness in chirality by a composite electromagnetic field. We
also present the symmetry conditions to induce the magnetic toroidal monopole
and exhibit candidate materials including noncollinear antiferromagnets in
order to stimulate experimental observations.

<h3>Coexistence of polar and antipolar phases in ferroelectric halide  perovskite CsGeBr$_3$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04033" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04033</a>
<br>
<i>Ravi Kashikar, S. Lisenkov, I. Ponomareva</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently ferroelectricity has been demonstrated in the family of halide
perovskites: CsGeX$_3$ (X=Cl, Br, I). We develop a first-principles-based
computational approach to probe finite-temperature properties of \cgb. Our
computations reveal the existence of a dynamic antipolar phase above the Curie
temperature. The phase can be stabilized below the Curie temperature through
quenching. Furthermore, competition between the polar and antipolar phases
results in the formation of rare polar-antipolar domains. We demonstrate that
such polar-antipolar domains can result in the formation of unusual
polarization fields with head-to-head and tail-to-tail dipole arrangements,
which not only offers an explanation for the recent experimental findings but
could also lead to the discovery of novel topological polar structures.

<h3>A Comprehensive Model of Snow Crystal Faceting</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04042" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04042</a>
<br>
<i>Kenneth G. Libbrecht, James Walkling</i>
<br>
<br>
Crystal faceting can emerge via two broad physical mechanisms: anisotropic
attachment kinetics on growing crystals and anisotropic surface energies on
near-equilibrium crystals. For the case of the ice/vapor system, anisotropic
attachment kinetics is the dominant faceting mechanism, while the possible
occurrence of equilibrium faceting has been debated for many decades. In this
investigation we examine ice/vapor faceting at low supersaturations over the
temperature range -15C<T<0C, where evidence of a roughening transition has been
previously reported. Our findings indicate that a comprehensive attachment
kinetics model can explain all the experimental data to date, while assuming an
essentially isotropic surface energy (which is supported by other
considerations). Specifically, our kinetic model naturally explains the
observed disappearance of prism faceting on slowly growing ice crystals in
vacuum at T>-2C, thus suggesting that snow crystal faceting is caused by
anisotropic attachment kinetics even at extremely slow growth rates.

<h3>Nuclear Spin-Depleted, Isotopically Enriched  $^\text{70}$Ge/$^\text{28}$Si$^\text{70}$Ge Quantum Wells</h3>

<br>
<br>
The p-symmetry of the hole wavefunction is associated with a weaker hyperfine
interaction as compared to electrons, thus making hole spin qubits attractive
candidates to implement long coherence quantum processors. However, recent
studies demonstrated that hole qubits in planar germanium (Ge) heterostructures
are still very sensitive to nuclear spin bath. These observations highlight the
need to develop nuclear spin-free Ge qubits to suppress this decoherence
channel and evaluate its impact. With this perspective, this work demonstrates
the epitaxial growth of $^\text{73}$Ge-depleted isotopically enriched
$^\text{70}$Ge/SiGe quantum wells. The growth was achieved by reduced pressure
chemical vapor deposition using isotopically purified monogermane
$^\text{70}$GeH$_\text{4}$ and monosilane $^\text{28}$SiH$_\text{4}$ with an
isotopic purity higher than 99.9 $\%$ and 99.99 $\%$, respectively. The quantum
wells consist of a series of $^\text{70}$Ge/SiGe heterostructures grown on Si
wafers using a Ge virtual substrate and a graded SiGe buffer layer. The
isotopic purity is investigated using atom probe tomography following an
analytical procedure addressing the discrepancies in the isotopic content
caused by the overlap of isotope peaks in mass spectra. The nuclear spin
background in the quantum wells was found to be sensitive to the growth
conditions. The lowest concentration of nuclear spin-full isotopes
$^\text{73}$Ge and $^\text{29}$Si in the heterostructure was established at
0.01 $\%$ in the Ge quantum well and SiGe barriers. The measured average
distance between nuclear spins reaches 3-4 nm in
$^\text{70}$Ge/$^\text{28}$Si$^\text{70}$Ge, which is an order of magnitude
larger than in natural Ge/SiGe heterostructures.

<h3>Electron-hole dichotomy for thermoelectric transport in a two-valley  system with strong intervalley scattering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04075" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04075</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The role of electron-phonon scattering in thermoelectric transport has been
paid much attention, especially in multivalley systems. By investigating a
two-valley model with electron-phonon coupling, we find three electron
transport regimes realized by electron-hole asymmetry of electron relaxation
time due to the strong intervalley scattering. Seebeck coefficient denotes an
electron-hole dichotomy due to this asymmetry. Our finding sheds light on
unexplored thermoelectric transport under the strong electron-phonon
scattering.

<h3>Majorana zero modes in Y-shape interacting Kitaev wires</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04081" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04081</a>
<br>
<i>Bradraj Pandey, Nitin Kaushal, Gonzalo Alvarez, Elbio Dagotto</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the recent experimental realization of minimal Kitaev chains
using quantum dots, we investigate the Majorana zero modes (MZM) in $Y$-shape
Kitaev wires. We solve the associated Kitaev models analytically at the sweet
spot ($t_h=\Delta$) and derive the exact form of MZM wave-functions in this
geometry. The novelty of our result is the observation of it non-local MZMs
near the junction center, made of a linear combination of edge sites MZMs for
each arm. Furthermore, we study the stability of local (on site) and non-local
MZMs modes in the presence of Coulomb repulsion, using density matrix
renormalization group theory. Our local density-of-states calculation shows
that these non-local MZMs are as equally topologically protected as the local
MZMs when in the presence of Coulomb repulsion.

<h3>Orbitally controlled quantum Hall states in decoupled two-bilayer  graphene sheets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04082" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04082</a>
<br>
<i>Soyun Kim, Dohun Kim, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jurgen. H. Smet, Youngwook Kim</i>
<br>
<br>
We report on integer and fractional quantum Hall states in a stack of two
twisted Bernal bilayer graphene sheets. By exploiting the momentum mismatch in
reciprocal space, we suppress single particle tunneling between both bilayers.
Since the bilayers are spatially separated by only 0.34 nm, the stack benefits
from strong interlayer Coulomb interactions. These interactions can cause the
formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate. Indeed, such a condensate is observed
for half filling in each bilayer sheet. However, only when the partially filled
levels have orbital index 1. It is absent for partially filled levels with
orbital index 0. This discrepancy is tentatively attributed to the role of
skyrmion/anti-skyrmion pair excitations and the dependence of the energy of
these excitations on the orbital index. The application of asymmetric top and
bottom gate voltages enables to influence the orbital nature of the electronic
states of the graphene bilayers at the chemical potential and to navigate in an
orbital mixed space. The latter hosts an even denominator fractional quantum
Hall state at total filling -3/2. Our observations suggest a unique edge
reconstruction involving both electrons and chiral p-wave composite fermions.

<h3>Piezoelectric altermagnetism and spin-valley polarization in Janus  monolayer $\mathrm{Cr_2SO}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04094" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04094</a>
<br>
<i>San-Dong Guo, Xiao-Shu Guo, Kai Cheng, Ke Wang, Yee Sin Ang</i>
<br>
<br>
The altermagnetism can achieve spin-split bands in collinear
symmetry-compensated antiferromagnets. Here, we predict altermagnetic order in
Janus monolayer $\mathrm{Cr_2SO}$ with eliminated inversion symmetry, which can
realize the combination of piezoelectricity and altermagnetism in a
two-dimensional material, namely 2D piezoelectric altermagnetism. It is found
that $\mathrm{Cr_2SO}$ is an altermagnetic semiconductor, and the spin-split
bands of both valence and conduction bands are near the Fermi level. The
$\mathrm{Cr_2SO}$ has large out-of-plane piezoelectricity ($|d_{31}|$$=$0.97
pm/V), which is highly desirable for ultrathin piezoelectric device
application. Due to spin-valley locking, both spin and valley can be polarized
by simply breaking the corresponding crystal symmetry with uniaxial strain. Our
findings provide a platform to integrate spin, piezoelectricity and valley in a
single material, which is useful for multi-functional device applications.

<h3>Hydrogen crystals reduce dissipation in superconducting resonators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04112" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04112</a>
<br>
<i>Francesco Valenti, Andrew N. Kanagin, Andreas Angerer, Luiza Buimaga-Iarinca, Cristian Morari, Jörg Schmiedmayer, Ioan M. Pop</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that the internal quality factors of high impedance superconducting
resonators made of granular aluminum can be improved by coating them with
micrometric films of solid para-hydrogen molecular crystals. We attribute the
average measured $\approx 8\%$ reduction in dissipation to absorption of stray
terahertz radiation at the crystal-resonator interface and the subsequent
dissipation of its energy in the form of phonons below the pair-breaking gap.
Our results prove that, contrary to expectations, replacing the vacuum
dielectric atop a superconducting resonator can be beneficial, thanks to the
added protection against Cooper pair-braking terahertz radiation. Moreover, at
the level of internal quality factors in the $10^5$ range, the hydrogen crystal
does not introduce additional losses, which is promising for embedding
impurities to couple to superconducting thin-film devices in hybrid quantum
architectures.

<h3>A topologically stabilized metastable fluid in a system of cylindrically  confined hard spheres</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04134" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04134</a>
<br>
<i>Mahdi Zarif, Richard K. Bowles</i>
<br>
<br>
Metastability in soft condensed matter systems usually results from the
presence of a nucleation free energy barrier and/or slow dynamics caused by
high density jamming phenomena. Here, we use molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo
simulation to show that the interactions between topological defects stabilizes
a chiral helical fluid in a confined quasi-one-dimensional hard sphere fluid
dramatically slowing its decay toward the equilibrium achiral fluid state.
Analysis of thermodynamic, structural and dynamic properties of the system show
the equation of state bifurcates continuously at intermediate pressures into
two distinct branches that are accessed from different initial conditions, but
terminate at the same close packed single helix in the high pressure limit. The
equilibrium fluid, which forms the high pressure branch as the system is
compressed from low density, is characterized by helical sections separated by
randomly distributed topological defects that change the helical twist
direction giving rise to an achiral fluid. The low pressure metastable branch,
formed by decompressing the system from the perfect helix, is characterized by
the appearance of loosely paired defects that help retain the chiral excess of
the original state and stabliize the fluids until it merges continuously with
the equilibrium branch at intermediate pressures.

<h3>Role of electron correlation and disorder on the electronic structure of  layered nickelate (La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$)$_2$NiO$_4$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04154" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04154</a>
<br>
<i>Sakshi Bansal, R. K. Maurya, Asif Ali, B. H. Reddy, Ravi Shankar Singh</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the role of electron correlation and disorder on the
electronic structure of layered nickelate (La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$)$_2$NiO$_4$
using core level and valence band photoemission spectroscopy in conjunction
with density functional theory (DFT) and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT)
calculations. Sr 3$d$ and La 4$d$ core level spectra exhibit multiple features
associated with photoemission final state effects. An increase of unscreened
features in the Sr 3$d$ and La 4$d$ core level spectra with lowering
temperature suggests the reduction in density of states (DOS) at the Fermi
level, $E_F$. Valence band spectra collected using different photon energies
reveal finite intensity at $E_F$ and overall spectra are well captured by
DFT+DMFT. Strong renormalization of partially filled $e_g$ bands in DFT+DMFT
result indicates strong correlation in this system. Mass enhancement factor,
$m^*/m_{\text{DFT}} \sim$ 3, agrees well with values obtained from specific
heat measurements. High resolution spectra in the vicinity of $E_F$ show
monotonically decreasing spectral intensity with lowering temperature, which
evolves to exhibit a Fermi cut-off at low temperatures indicating metallic
character in contrast to insulating transport, suggesting Anderson insulating
state. $|E-E_F|^{1/2}$ dependence of the spectral DOS and square root
temperature dependence of spectral DOS at $E_F$ evidences the role of disorder
in the electronic structure of (La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$)$_2$NiO$_4$.

<br>
<br>
The recent discovery of superconductivity in hole-doped infinite-layer
nickelates has triggered a great interest in the synthesis of novel nickelate
phases, which have primarily been examined in thin film samples. Here, we
report the high-pressure optical floating zone (OFZ) growth of various
perovskite and perovskite-derived rare-earth nickelate single-crystals, and
investigate the effects of hole-, electron-, and self-doping. For hole-doping
with Ca and Sr, we observe phase separations during the growth process when a
substitution level of 8% is exceeded. A similar trend emerges for
electron-doping with Ce and Zr. Employing lower doping levels allows us to grow
sizeable crystals in the perovskite phase, which exhibit significantly
different electronic and magnetic properties than the undoped parent compounds,
such as a decreased resistivity and a suppressed magnetic response. Our
insights into the doping-dependent phase formation and the resulting properties
of the synthesized crystals reveal limitations and opportunities for the
exploration and manipulation of electronic states in rare-earth nickelates.

<h3>Bragg Intersections</h3>

We theoretically study nearly uniform electron models with weak crystalline
potentials. In particular, we theorize the modulation of the plane-wave
branches at linear regions where multiple Bragg planes intersect. Any such
linear intersections involve three or more plane-wave branches diffracted by
the periodic potential. Small inter-branch interactions can yield various
crossing and anticrossing singularities with promised breakdown of the
quadratic approximation, extending alongside the intersection lines. Most of
the intersections run in low-symmetric paths in the Brillouin zone and
therefore we cannot completely characterize their electronic states with
standard band structure plotting methods. The present theory reveals a general
mechanism in nearly uniform systems to induce approximately degenerate and
linearly continuous Dirac and van-Hove singularities in three dimensions, which
may host a variety of anomalous low-energy electronic properties. We apply the
theory to a recently discovered high temperature superconductor H$_{3}$S to
interpret the enigmatic density-of-state peaking therein.

<h3>MXene-based Ti2C/Ta2C lateral heterostructure: an intrinsic room  temperature ferromagnetic material with large magnetic anisotropy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04257" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04257</a>

<br>
<br>
(2D) lateral heterostructures (LH) combining Ti$_2$C and Ta$_2$C MXenes were
investigated by means of first-principles calculations. Our structural and
elastic properties calculations show that the lateral Ti$_2$C/Ta$_2$C
heterostructure results in a 2D material that is stronger than the original
isolated MXenes and other 2D monolayers such as germanene or MoS$_2$. The
analysis of the evolution of the charge distribution with the size of the LH
shows that, for small systems, it tends to distribute homogeneously between the
two monolayers, whereas for larger systems electrons tend to accumulate in a
region of $\sim$~6 {\AA} around the interface. The work function of the
heterostructure, one crucial parameter in the design of electronic nanodevices,
is found to be lower than that of some conventional 2D LH. Remarkably, all the
heterostructures studied show a very high Curie temperature (between 696 K and
1082 K), high magnetic moments %present in the ferromagnetic ground state, and
high magnetic anisotropy energies. These features make (Ti$_2$C)/(Ta$_2$C)
lateral heterostructures very suitable candidates for spintronic,
photocatalysis, and data storage applications based upon 2D magnetic materials.

Recently, the claim of "near-ambient superconductivity" in a N-doped lutetium
hydride attracted enormous following-up investigations in the community of
condensed matter physics and material sciences. But quite soon, the
experimental results from different groups indicate consistently that no
evidence of near-ambient superconductivity is found in the samples synthesized
by the same method as the reported one, or by the other alternative methods.
From our extended high-pressure heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility
measurements on the samples prepared with the lutetium foil and H2/N2 gas
mixture, we report the finding of a magnetic transition at the temperature
about 56 K. Our results show that this magnetic phase is robust against
pressure up to 4.3 GPa, which covers the critical pressure of boosting the
claimed near room temperature superconductivity.

Analytical gradients of the total energy are provided for local density and
generalized-gradient hybrid approximations to generalized Kohn-Sham
spin-current density functional theory (SCDFT). An implementation is presented
in the public \textsc{crystal} program. It is shown that gradients may be
determined analytically, in a two-component framework, including spin-orbit
coupling (SOC), with high accuracy. We demonstrate that renormalization of the
electron-electron potential by SOC-induced spin-currents can account for
considerable modification of crystal structures. In the case of iodine-based
molecular crystals, the effect amounts to about half or more of the total
modification of the structure by SOC. Such effects necessitate an SCDFT, rather
than DFT, formulation, in which exchange-correlation functionals are endowed
with an explicit dependence on spin-current densities.

Magnetic kagome metals, in which topologically non-trivial band structures
and electronic correlation are intertwined, have recently emerged as an
exciting platform to explore exotic correlated topological phases, that are
usually not found in weakly interacting materials described within the
semi-classical picture of electrons. Here, via a comprehensive single-crystal
neutron diffraction and first-principles density functional theory study of the
archetypical topological kagome metal Mn$_3$Sn, which is also a magnetic Weyl
fermion material and a promising chiral magnet for antiferromagnetic
spintronics, we report the realisation of an emergent spin-density wave (SDW)
order, a hallmark correlated many-body phenomenon, that is engineered by the
Fermi surface nesting of topological flat bands. We further reveal that the
phase transition, from the well-known high-temperature coplanar and
non-collinear k = 0 inverse triangular antiferromagnetic order to a double-$k$
non-coplanar modulated incommensurate magnetic structure below $T_1$ = 280 K,
is primarily driven by the SDW instability. The double-$k$ nature of this
complex low-temperature magnetic order, which can be regarded as an intriguing
superposition of a longitudinal SDW with a modulation wavevector k$_L$ and a
transverse incommensurate helical magnetic order with a modulation wavevector
k$_T$, is unambiguously confirmed by our observation of the inter-modulation
high-order harmonics of the type of 2k$_L$+k$_T$. This discovery not only
solves a long-standing puzzle concerning the nature of the phase transition at
$T_1$, but also provides an extraordinary example on the intrinsic engineering
of correlated many-body phenomena in topological matter. The identified
multi-$k$ magnetic state can be further exploited for the engineering of the
new modes of magnetization and chirality switching in antiferromagnetic
spintronics.

<br>
<br>
Phase-field models are widely employed to simulate microstructure evolution
during processes such as solidification or heat treatment. The resulting
partial differential equations, often strongly coupled together, may be solved
by a broad range of numerical methods, but this often results in a high
computational cost, which calls for advanced numerical methods to accelerate
their resolution. Here, we quantitatively test the efficiency and accuracy of
semi-implicit Fourier spectral-based methods, implemented in Python programming
language and parallelized on a graphics processing unit (GPU), for solving a
phase-field model coupling Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn equations. We compare
computational performance and accuracy with a standard explicit finite
difference (FD) implementation with similar GPU parallelization on the same
hardware. For a similar spatial discretization, the semi-implicit Fourier
spectral (FS) solvers outperform the FD resolution as soon as the time step can
be taken 5 to 6 times higher than afforded for the stability of the FD scheme.
The accuracy of the FS methods also remains excellent even for coarse grids,
while that of FD deteriorates significantly. Therefore, for an equivalent level
of accuracy, semi-implicit FS methods severely outperform explicit FD, by up to
4 orders of magnitude, as they allow much coarser spatial and temporal
discretization.

Dissipation in mechanics, optics, acoustics, and electronic circuits is
nowadays recognized to be not always detrimental but can be exploited to
achieve non-Hermitian topological phases with functionalities for potential
device applications, ranging from sensors with unprecedented sensitivity, light
funneling, wave isolators, non-reciprocal amplification, to dissipation induced
phase transition. As elementary excitations of ordered magnetic moments that
exist in various magnetic materials, magnons are the information carrier in
magnonic devices with low-energy consumption for reprogrammable logic,
non-reciprocal communication, and non-volatile memory functionalities.
Non-Hermitian topological magnonics deals with the engineering of dissipation
for non-Hermitian topological phases in magnets that are not achievable in the
conventional Hermitian scenario, with associated functionalities
cross-fertilized with their electronic, acoustic, optic, and mechanic
counterparts, such as giant enhancement of magnonic frequency combs, magnon
amplification, (quantum) sensing of the magnetic field with unprecedented
sensitivity, magnon accumulation, and perfect absorption of microwaves. In this
review article, we introduce the unified basic physics and provide a
comprehensive overview of the recent theoretical and experimental progress
towards achieving distinct non-Hermitian topological phases in magnonic
devices, including exceptional points, exceptional nodal phases, non-Hermitian
magnonic SSH model, and non-Hermitian skin effect. We emphasize the
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach based on the Lindbladian or self-energy of
the magnonic subsystem but address the physics beyond it as well, such as the
crucial quantum jump effect in the quantum regime and non-Markovian dynamics.
We provide a perspective for future opportunities and challenges before
concluding this article.

<h3>Edge conductivity in PtSe$_2$ nanostructures</h3>

PtSe$_2$ is a promising 2D material for nanoelectromechanical sensing and
photodetection in the infrared regime. One of its most compelling features is
the facile synthesis at temperatures below 500 {\deg}C, which is compatible
with current back-end-of-line semiconductor processing. However, this process
generates polycrystalline thin films with nanoflake-like domains of 5 to 100 nm
size. To investigate the lateral quantum confinement effect in this size
regime, we train a deep neural network to obtain an interatomic potential at
DFT accuracy and use that to model ribbons, surfaces, nanoflakes, and
nanoplatelets of PtSe$_2$ with lateral widths between 5 to 15 nm. We determine
which edge terminations are the most stable and find evidence that the
electrical conductivity is localized on the edges for lateral sizes below 10
nm. This suggests that the transport channels in thin films of PtSe$_2$ might
be dominated by networks of edges, instead of transport through the layers
themselves.

<br>
<br>
Excitons hosted by GaN/(Al,Ga)N quantum wells (QWs) are spatially indirect
due to the giant built-in electric field that separates electrons and holes
along the growth direction. This electric field, and thus exciton energy, can
be reduced by depositing metallic layers on the sample surface. Using
spatially-resolved micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy we compare the effects
of two different materials, Nickel/Gold (NiAu) and few-layered graphene (FLG),
on the potential landscape experienced by the excitons. We are able to (i)
determine the potential barriers imposed on QW excitons by deposition of FLG
and NiAu to be $14$ and $82$~meV, respectively, and (ii) to evidence their
impact on the exciton transport at appropriate densities. Optical losses and
inhomogeneous broadening induced by deposition of NiAu and FLG layers are
similar, and their joined implementation constitute a promising tool for
electrostatic modulation of IX densities even in the absence of any applied
electric bias.

Machine learning is used to generate empirical pseudopotentials that
characterize the local screened interactions in the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. Our
approach incorporates momentum-range-separated rotation-covariant descriptors
to capture crystal symmetries as well as crucial directional information of
bonds, thus realizing accurate descriptions of anisotropic solids. Trained
empirical potentials are shown to be versatile and transferable such that the
calculated energy bands and wave functions without cumbersome self-consistency
reproduce conventional ab initio results even for semiconductors with defects,
thus fostering faster and faithful data-driven materials researches.

<br>
<br>
Heusler compounds have always attracted a great deal of attention from
researchers thanks to a wealth of interesting properties for technological
applications. They are intermetallic ductile compounds, and some of them have
been found to be superconducting. With this in mind, we perform an extensive
study of the superconducting and elastic properties of the cubic (full-)Heusler
family. Starting from thermodynamically stable compounds, we use ab initio
methods for the calculation of the phonon spectra, electron-phonon couplings,
superconducting critical temperatures and elastic tensors. By analyzing the
statistical distributions of these properties and comparing them to
anti-perovskites we recognize universal behaviors that should be common to all
conventional superconductors while others turn out to be specific to the
material family. The resulting data is used to train interpretable and
predictive machine learning models, that are used to extend our knowledge of
superconductivity in Heuslers and to provide an interpretation of our results.
In total, we discover a total of 8 hypothetical materials with critical
temperatures above 10 K, to be compared with the current record of Tc = 4.7 K
in this family. Furthermore, we expect most of these materials to be highly
ductile, making them potential candidates for the manufacture of wires and
tapes for superconducting magnets.

<br>
Cellular Potts models are broadly applied across developmental biology and
cancer research. The traditional approach, which reinterprets a modified
Metropolis sampling as ad hoc dynamics, lacks control over kinetic parameters
of the system. From principles of stochastic thermodynamics we formulate an
alternative dynamics of cellular Potts models, which offers a more realistic
description of the modeled processes. Our method accurately describes the time
course of cell sorting in mouse embryo development and identifies the distinct
contributions of nonequilibrium processes, e.g. cell growth and active
fluctuations.

Charge density wave (CDW) ordering has been an important topic of study for a
long time owing to its connection with other exotic phases such as
superconductivity and magnetism. The RTe3 (R = rare-earth elements) family of
materials provides a fertile ground to study the dynamics of CDW in van der
Waals layered materials, and the presence of magnetism in these materials
allows to explore the interplay among CDW and long range magnetic ordering.
Here, we have carried out a high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) study of a CDW material GdTe3, which is antiferromagnetic
below 12 K, along with thermodynamic, electrical transport, magnetic, and Raman
measurements. Our Raman spectroscopy measurements show the presence of CDW
amplitude mode at room temperature, which remains prominent when the sample is
thinned down to 4-layers by exfoliation. Our ARPES data show a two-fold
symmetric Fermi surface with both gapped and ungapped regions indicative of the
partial nesting. The gap is momentum dependent, maximum along G-Z and gradually
decreases going towards G - M. Our study provides a platform to study the
dynamics of CDW and its interaction with other physical orders in two- and
three-dimensions.

Actinide-bearing intermetallics display unusual electronic, magnetic, and
physical properties which arise from the complex behavior of their 5$f$
electron orbitals. Temperature ($T$) effects on actinide intermetallics are
well studied, but high pressure ($P$) properties and phase stabilities are
known for only a handful of compositions. Furthermore, almost no data exist for
simultaneous high $P$ and high $T$. We performed ambient-$T$ diamond anvil cell
X-ray diffraction experiments to study the behavior of the intermetallic
U$_6$Fe upon compression up to 82 GPa. U$_6$Fe remains stable in the tetragonal
$I4/mcm$ structure over this pressure range. We also performed ambient $P$,
low-$T$ diffraction and heat capacity measurements to constrain U$_6$Fe's
thermal behavior. These data were combined with calculations and fitted to a
Mie-Gruneisen/Birch-Murnaghan thermal equation of state with the following
parameter values at ambient $P$: bulk modulus $B_0$ = 124.0 GPa, pressure
derivative $B'_0$ = 5.6, Gruneisen parameter $\Gamma_0$ = 2.028, volume
exponent $q$ = 0.934, Debye temperature $\theta_0$ = 175 K, and unit cell
volume $V_0$ = 554.4 angstrom$^3$. We report $T$-dependent thermal expansion
coefficients and bond lengths of U$_6$Fe, which demonstrate the anisotropic
compressibility and negative thermal expansion of the crystallographic $c$
axis. Additionally, density-functional theory calculations indicate increased
delocalization of U$_6$Fe bonds at high $P$.

<h3>Observation of 2D Mott insulator and $π$-superfluid quantum phase  transition in shaking optical lattice</h3>

<br>
The Mott insulator and superfluid phase transition is one of the most
prominent phenomena in ultracold atoms. In this work, we report the observation
of a novel 2D quantum phase transition between Mott insulator and $\pi$
superfluid in a shaking optical lattice. In the deep optical lattice regime,
the lowest $s$-band can be tuned to Mott phase, while the higher $p_{x,y}$
bands are itinerant for having larger bandwidth. Through a shaking technique
coupling the $s$ orbital to $p_{x,y}$ orbital states, we experimentally observe
the transition between the states of the $s$ and $p_{x,y}$ bands, leading to a
quantum phase transition from 2D $s$-orbital Mott phase to the
$p_{x,y}$-orbital superfluid which condensed at $(\pi,\pi)$ momentum.

We use numerical simulations and linear stability analysis to study the
dynamics of an active liquid crystal film on a substrate in the regime where
the passive system would be isotropic. Extensile activity builds up local
orientational order and destabilizes the quiescent isotropic state above a
critical activity value, eventually resulting in spatiotemporal chaotic
dynamics akin to the one observed ubiquitously in the nematic state. Here we
show that tuning substrate friction yields a variety of emergent structures at
intermediate activity, including lattices of flow vortices with associated
regular arrangements of topological defects and a new chiral state where flow
vortices trap pairs of $+1/2$ defect that chase each other tail. The length
scale of these emergent structures is set by the screening length
$l_\eta=\sqrt{\eta/\Gamma}$ of the flow, controlled by the shear viscosity
$\eta$ and the substrate friction $\Gamma$, and can be captured by simple mode
selection of the vortical flows. We demonstrate that the emergence of coherent
structures can be interpreted as a phase separation of vorticity, where
friction pays a role akin to that of birth/death processes in breaking
conservation of the phase separating species and selecting a characteristic
scale for the patterns. Our work shows that friction provides an experimentally
accessible tuning parameter for designing controlled active flows.

Using the near-detailed-balance distribution function obtained in our recent
work, we present a set of covariant gravito-thermal transport equations for
neutral relativistic gases in a generic stationary spacetime. All relevant
tensorial transport coefficients are worked out and are presented using some
particular integration functions in $(\alpha,\zeta)$, where $\alpha =
-\beta\mu$ and $\zeta =\beta m$ is the relativistic coldness, with $\beta$
being the inverse temperature and $\mu$ being the chemical potential. It is
shown that the Onsager reciprocal relation holds in the gravito-thermal
transport phenomena, and that the heat conductivity and the
gravito-conductivity tensors are proportional to each other, with the
coefficient of proportionality given by the product of the so-called Lorenz
number with the temperature, thus proving a gravitational variant of the
Wiedemann-Franz law. It is remarkable that, for strongly degenerate Fermi
gases, the Lorenz number takes a universal constant value $L=\pi^2/3$, which
extends the Wiedemann-Franz law into the Wiedemann-Franz-Lorenz law.

Quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) was discovered a decade ago, but is
still not utilized beyond a handful of research groups, due to numerous
limitations such as extremely low temperature, electric field-effect gating
requirement, small sample sizes and environmental aging effect. Here, we
present a robust platform that provides effective solutions to these problems.
Specifically, on this platform, we observe QAH signatures at record high
temperatures, with the Hall conductance of 1.00 e2/h at 2.0 K, 0.98 e2/h at 4.2
K, and 0.92 e2/h at 10 K, on centimeter-scale substrates, without
electric-field-effect gating. The key ingredient is an active CrOx capping
layer, which substantially boosts the ferromagnetism while suppressing
environmental degradation. With this development, QAHE will now be accessible
to much broader applications than before.

AC losses in conductor-on-rounded-core (CORC) cables of YBCO high-temperature
superconducting (HTS) tapes are a significant challenge in HTS power
applications. This study employs two finite element analysis (FEA) models to
investigate the contributions from different AC loss components and provide
approaches for reducing AC losses in cables. An FEA model based on T-A formula
treats the cross-section of thin superconducting layers as 1D lines and,
therefore, only can predict the AC loss generated by the perpendicular magnetic
field. In contrast, the model based on H-formulation can be performed on the
actual 2D rectangular cross-section HTS tapes to provide the total AC losses
generated by magnetic fluxes penetrating from both the edges and surfaces of
HTS tapes, although this model requires more computing time and memory. Both 1D
and 2D simulation approaches were employed to offer a comprehensive
understanding of the effects of cable design and operational parameters on the
AC loss components in a 2-layer CORC cable. The research results given in this
paper are therefore not only valuable to suggest strategies for reducing AC
loss in multi-layer cables but also for developing more accurate and effective
methods to calculate AC loss in CORC HTS cables.

Twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) subject to a sequence of commensurate
external periodic potentials reveals the formation of moir\'e fractals that
share striking similarities with the central place theory (CPT) of economic
geography, thus uncovering a remarkable connection between twistronics and the
geometry of economic zones. The moir\'e fractals arise from the self-similarity
of the hierarchy of Brillouin zones (BZ) so formed, forming a nested subband
structure within the bandwidth of the original moir\'e bands. The fractal
generators for TBLG under these external potentials are derived and we explore
their impact on the hierarchy of the BZ edges. Furthermore, we uncover
parallels between the modification of the BZ hierarchy and magnetic BZ
formation in the Hofstadter butterfly, allowing us to construct an
incommensurability measure for moir\'e fractals as a function of the twist
angle. The resulting band structure hierarchy bolsters correlation effects,
pushing more bands within the same energy window for both commensurate and
incommensurate structures.

We unveil the multifractal behavior of Ising spin glasses in their
low-temperature phase. Using the Janus II custom-built supercomputer, the
spin-glass correlation function is studied locally. Dramatic fluctuations are
found when pairs of sites at the same distance are compared. The scaling of
these fluctuations, as the spin-glass coherence length grows with time, is
characterized through the computation of the singularity spectrum and its
corresponding Legendre transform. A comparatively small number of site pairs
controls the average correlation that governs the response to a magnetic field.
We explain how this scenario of dramatic fluctuations (at length scales smaller
than the coherence length) can be reconciled with the smooth, self-averaging
behavior that has long been considered to describe spin-glass dynamics.

Long-range interacting systems unavoidably relax through Poisson shot noise
fluctuations generated by their finite number of particles, $N$. When driven by
two-body correlations, i.e. ${1/N}$ effects, this long-term evolution is
described by the inhomogeneous Balescu-Lenard equation. Yet, in one-dimensional
systems with a monotonic frequency profile and only subject to 1:1 resonances,
this kinetic equation exactly vanishes: this is a first-order full kinetic
blocking. These systems' long-term evolution is then driven by three-body
correlations, i.e. ${1/N^2}$ effects. In the limit of dynamically hot systems,
this is described by the inhomogeneous ${1/N^2}$ Landau equation. We
investigate numerically the long-term evolution of systems for which this
second kinetic equation also exactly vanishes: this a second-order bare kinetic
blocking. We demonstrate that these systems relax through the "leaking"
contributions of dressed three-body interactions that are neglected in the
inhomogeneous ${1/N^2}$ Landau equation. Finally, we argue that these
never-vanishing contributions prevent four-body correlations, i.e. ${1/N^{3}}$
effects, from ever being the main driver of relaxation.

We present an \textit{ab-initio} study of the quasi-2D layered perovskite
Sr$_3$Hf$_2$O$_7$ com\-pound, performed within the framework of the Density
Functional Theory and lattice dynamics analysis. At high temperatures, this
compound takes a \textit{I4/mmm} centrosym\-met\-ric structure (S.G. n. 139);
as the temperature is lowered, the symmetry is broken into other intermediate
polymorphs before reaching the ground state structure, which is the
\textit{Cmc2$_1$} ferroelectric phase (S.G. n. 36). One of these intermediate
polymorphs is the \textit{Ccce} structural phase (S.G. n. 68). Additionally, we
have probed the \textit{C2/c} system (S.G n. 15), which was obtained by
following the atomic displacements corresponding to the eigenvectors of the
imaginary frequency mode localized at the $\mathbf{\Gamma}$-point of the
\textit{Ccce} phase. By observing the enthalpies at low pressures, we found
that the \textit{Cmc2$_1$} phase is thermodynamically the most stable. Our
results show that the \textit{I4/mmm} and \textit{C2/c} phases never stabilize
in the 0-20 GPa range of pressure values. On the other hand, the \textit{Ccce}
phase becomes energetically more stable at around 17 GPa, surpassing the
\textit{Cmc2$_1$} structure. By considering the effect of entropy and the
constant-volume free energies, we observe that the \textit{Cmc2$_1$} polymorph
is energetically the most stable phase at low temperature; however, at 350 K
the \textit{Ccce} system becomes the most stable. By probing the
volume-dependent free energies at 19 GPa, we see that \textit{Ccce} is always
the most stable phase between the two structures and also throughout the
studied temperature range. When analyzing the phonon dispersion frequencies, we
conclude that the \textit{Ccce} system becomes dynamically stable only around
19-20 GPa, and that the \textit{Cmc2$_1$} phase, is metastable up to 30 GPa.

This study introduces a new paradigm that unifies abrasion and breakage
concepts, allowing for a holistic understanding of the comminution process. The
significance of this paradigm lies in its ability to present both abrasion and
breakage in a single big picture because both processes can co-occur under
loading as particles are subjected to friction as well as collision. A
comprehensive descriptive framework is employed to this end, which operates in
a log-transformed surface-area-to-volume ratio (A/V) and volume (V) space. This
space facilitates a holistic characterization of the four-dimensional particle
geometry features, i.e., volume (V), surface area (A), size (D), and shape
(\b{eta}). Consequently, this approach enables to systematically relate the
co-occurring abrasion and breakage process to co-evolving particle shape and
size. Transformative concepts including the breakage line, sphere line, and
average shape-conserving line are introduced to describe the limit states and a
special comminution process. This approach also uncovers a self-similar nature
in evolving particle geometry during comminution, which will be a significant
discovery for the granular materials research community given the most
fundamental properties observed in natural phenomena.
