<h3>Bridging Effective Field Theories and Generalized Hydrodynamics</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15871v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15871v1</a>

Generalized Hydrodynamics (GHD) has recently been devised as a method to
solve the dynamics of integrable quantum many-body systems beyond the
mean-field approximation. In its original form, a major limitation is the
inability to predict equal-time correlations. Here we present a new method to
treat thermal fluctuations of a 1D bosonic degenerate gas within the GHD
framework. We show how the standard results using the thermodynmaic Bethe
ansatz can be obtained through sampling of collective bosonic excitations,
revealing the connection or duality between GHD and effective field theories
such as the standard hydrodynamic equations. As an example, we study the
damping of a coherently excited density wave and show how equal-time phase
correlation functions can be extracted from the GHD evolution. Our results
present a conceptually new way of treating fluctuations beyond the linearized
regime of GHD.
