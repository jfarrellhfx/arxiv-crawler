<h3>2D hydrodynamic electron flow through periodic and random potentials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15917" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15917</a>

We study the hydrodynamic flow of electrons through a smooth potential energy
landscape in two dimensions, for which the electrical current is concentrated
along thin channels that follow percolating equipotential contours. The width
of these channels, and hence the electrical resistance, is determined by a
competition between viscous and thermoelectric forces. For the case of periodic
(moir\'{e}) potentials, we find that hydrodynamic flow provides a new route to
linear-in-$T$ resistivity. We calculate the associated prefactors for
potentials with $C_3$ and $C_4$ symmetry. On the other hand, for a random
potential the resistivity has qualitatively different behavior because
equipotential paths become increasingly tortuous as their width is reduced.
This effect leads to a resistivity that grows with temperature as $T^{10/3}$.

<h3>Spin Drude weight for the integrable XXZ chain with arbitrary spin</h3>

Using generalized hydrodynamics (GHD), we exactly evaluate the
finite-temperature spin Drude weight in a zero magnetic field for the
integrable XXZ chain with arbitrary spin and easy-plane anisotropy. First, we
construct the fusion hierarchy of the quantum transfer matrices ($T$-functions)
and derive functional relations ($T$- and $Y$-systems) satisfied by the
$T$-functions and certain combinations of them ($Y$-functions). Through
analytical arguments, the $Y$-system is reduced to a set of non-linear integral
equations, equivalent to the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) equations. Then,
employing GHD, we calculate the spin Drude weight at arbitrary finite
temperatures. As a result, a characteristic fractal-like structure of the Drude
weight is observed at arbitrary spin, similar to the spin-1/2 case. In our
approach, the solutions to the TBA equations (i.e., the $Y$-functions) can be
explicitly written in terms of the $T$-functions, thus allowing for a
systematic calculation of the high-temperature limit of the Drude weight.

<h3>Novel one-pot sol-gel synthesis route of Fe3C/few-layered graphene  core/shell nanoparticles embedded in a carbon matrix</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15858" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15858</a>
<br>
<i>Alberto Castellano-Soria, Jesús López-Sánchez, Cecilia Granados-Miralles, María Varela, Elena Navarro, César González, Pilar Marín</i>
<br>
<br>
Fe3C/few-layered graphene core/shell nanoparticles embedded in a carbon
matrix are synthesized by a novel two-step surfactant sol-gel strategy, where
the processes of hydrolysis, polycondensation and drying take place in a
one-pot. The present approach is based on the combined action of oleic acid and
oleylamine, which act sterically on the precursor micelles when a densification
temperature is performed in a reducing atmosphere. The structural and magnetic
evolution of the formed compounds is investigated, ranging from iron oxides
such as Fe3O4 and FeO, to the formation of pure Fe3C/C samples from 700 {\deg}C
onwards. Interestingly, Fe3C nanoparticles with a size of ~20 nm crystallize
immersed in the carbon matrix and the surrounding environment forms an oriented
encapsulation built by few-layered graphene. The nanostructures show a
saturation magnetization of ~43 emu/g and a moderate coercivity of ~500 Oe.
Thereby, an innovative chemical route to produce single phase Fe3C
nanoparticles is described, and an effective method of few-layered graphene
passivation is proposed, yielding a product with a high magnetic response and
high chemical stability against environmental corrosion.

<h3>Effect of organic solvent on the cold sintering processing of SrFe12O19  platelet-based permanent magnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15859" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15859</a>
<br>
<i>Aida Serrano, Eduardo García-Martín, Cecilia Granados-Miralles, Jesús López-Sánchez, Giulio Gorni, Adrián Quesada, José F. Fernández</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work we have investigated the effect of the solvent during the
processing of SrFe12O19 platelet-based permanent magnets by cold sintering
process (CSP) plus a post-thermal treatment. Several organic solvents: glacial
acetic acid, oleic acid and oleylamine have been analyzed, optimizing the CSP
temperatures at 190-270 {\deg}C, under pressures of 375-670 MPa and 6-50 wt% of
solvent. Modifications in the morphological and structural properties are
identified depending on the solvent, which impacts on the magnetic response.
Independently of the solvent, the mechanical integrity of ferrite magnets
obtained by CSP is improved by a post-annealing at 1100 {\deg}C for 2 h,
resulting in relative densities around 92 % with an average grain size of 1
{\mu}m and a fraction of SrFe12O19 phase > 91 %. Hc > 2.1 kOe and MS of 73
emu/g are obtained in the final sintered ceramic magnets, exhibiting the
highest HC value of 2.8 kOe for the magnet sintered using glacial acetic acid.

<h3>Greener processing of SrFe$_{12}$O$_{19}$ ceramic permanent magnets by  two-step sintering</h3>

<br>
<br>
With an annual production amounting to 800 kilotons, ferrite magnets
constitute the largest family of permanent magnets in volume, a demand that
will only increase as a consequence of the rare-earth crisis. With the global
goal of building a climate-resilient future, strategies towards a greener
manufacturing of ferrite magnets are of great interest. A new ceramic
processing route for obtaining dense Sr-ferrite sintered magnets is presented
here. Instead of the usual sintering process employed nowadays in ferrite
magnet manufacturing that demands long dwell times, a shorter two-step
sintering is designed to densify the ferrite ceramics. As a result of these
processes, dense SrFe$_{12}$O$_{19}$ ceramic magnets with properties comparable
to state-of-the-art ferrite magnets are obtained. In particular, the
SrFe$_{12}$O$_{19}$ magnet containing 0.2% PVA and 0.6% wt SiO$_2$ reaches a
coercivity of 164 kA/m along with a 93% relative density. A reduction of 31% in
energy consumption is achieved in the thermal treatment with respect to
conventional sintering, which could lead to energy savings for the industry of
the order of 7.109 kWh per year.

<br>
<br>
Calculations of elastic and mechanical characteristics of non-crystalline
solids are challenging due to high computation cost of $ab$ $initio$ methods
and low accuracy of empirical potentials. We propose a computational technique
towards efficient calculations of mechanical properties of polycrystals,
composites, and multi-phase systems from atomistic simulation with high
accuracy and reasonable computational cost. It is based on using actively
learned machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained on a local
fragments of the polycrystalline system for which forces, stresses and energies
are computed by using $ab$ $initio$ calculations. Developed approach is used
for calculation the dependence of elastic moduli of polycrystalline diamond on
the grain size. This technique allows one to perform large-scale calculations
of mechanical properties of complex solids of various compositions and
structures with high accuracy making the transition from ideal (single crystal)
systems to more realistic ones.

<h3>Multiband strong-coupling superconductors with spontaneously broken  time-reversal symmetry</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15894" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15894</a>
<br>
<i>Niels Henrik Aase, Kristian Mæland, Asle Sudbø</i>
<br>
<br>
We study superconducting three-band systems within strong-coupling Eliashberg
theory. In particular, we search for phase-frustrated superconducting systems
with spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) states. The emergence
of TRSB states in multiband systems has so far been studied using microscopic
weak-coupling BCS theory or more phenomenological effective field theories such
as multi-component Ginzburg-Landau theories. For systems with three disjoint
Fermi surfaces whose electrons experience interactions mediated by phonons, we
present a microscopic analysis showing that TRSB states also exist within a
strong-coupling microscopic theory. The systems we consider have sizeable
electron-phonon couplings, putting them into the strong-coupling regime. They
are thus a fitting description for strong-coupling materials such as some of
the iron pnictides. Moreover, as the TRSB states are challenging to find
numerically, we calculate the free energy of multiband systems within
strong-coupling theory and make explicit use of it to pin down their elusive
nature. Since Eliashberg theory is well-incorporated with first-principle
calculations, our strong-coupling approach might help facilitate a more
efficient search for candidate materials that can exhibit TRSB.

<h3>Pumping Chirality in Three Dimensions</h3>

Using bosonization, which maps fermions coupled to a ${\mathbb{Z}}_2$ gauge
field to a qubit system, we give a simple form for the non-trivial 3-fermion
quantum cellular automaton (QCA) as a unitary operator realizing a phase
depending on the framing of flux loops, building off work by Shirley et al. We
relate this framing dependent phase to a pump of $8$ copies of a $p+ip$ state
through the system. We give a resolution of an apparent paradox, namely that
the pump is a shallow depth circuit (albeit with tails), while the QCA is
nontrivial. We discuss also the pump of fewer copies of a $p+ip$ state, and
describe its action on topologically degenerate ground states. One consequence
of our results is that a pump of $n$ $p+ip$ states generated by a free Fermi
evolution is a free fermion unitary characterized by a non-trivial winding
number $n$ as a map from the third homotopy group of the Brilliouin Zone
$3$-torus to that of $SU(N_ b)$, where $N_b$ is the number of bands. Using our
simplified form of the QCA, we give higher dimensional generalizations that we
conjecture are also nontrivial QCAs, and we discuss the relation to
Chern-Simons theory.

<h3>Emergent Quantum Phenomena of Noncentrosymmetric Charge-Density Wave in  1T-Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15916" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15916</a>

<br>
<br>
1T-transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) have been an exciting platform for
exploring the intertwinement of charge density waves and strong correlation
phenomena. While the David star structure has been conventionally considered as
the underlying charge order in the literature, recent scanning tunneling probe
experiments on several monolayer 1T-TMD materials have motivated a new,
alternative structure, namely the anion-centered David star structure. In this
paper, we show that this novel anion-centered David star structure manifestly
breaks inversion symmetry, resulting in flat bands with pronounced Rashba
spin-orbit couplings. These distinctive features unlock novel possibilities and
functionalities for 1T-TMDs, including the giant spin Hall effect, the
emergence of Chern bands, and spin liquid that spontaneously breaks crystalline
rotational symmetry. Our findings establish promising avenues for exploring
emerging quantum phenomena of monolayer 1T-TMDs with this novel
noncentrosymmetric structure.

<h3>Symmetry-specific characterization of bond orientation order in  DNA-assembled nanoparticle lattices</h3>

<br>
<br>
Bond-orientational order in DNA-assembled nanoparticle lattices is explored
with the help of recently introduced Symmetry-specific Bond Order Parameters
(SymBOPs). This approach provides a more sensitive analysis of local order than
traditional scalar Bond Order Parameters, facilitating the identification of
coherent domains at the single bond level. The present study expands the method
initially developed for assemblies of anisotropic particles to the isotropic
ones or cases where particle orientation information is unavailable. The SymBOP
analysis was applied to experiments on DNA-frame-based assembly of nanoparticle
lattices. It proved highly sensitive in identifying coherent crystalline
domains with different orientations, as well as detecting topological defects,
such as dislocations. Furthermore, the analysis distinguishes individual
sublattices within a single crystalline domain, such as pair of
interpenetrating FCC lattices within a cubic diamond. The results underscore
the versatility and robustness of SymBOPs in characterizing ordering phenomena,
making them valuable tools for investigating structural properties in various
systems.

<br>
<br>
In this study, we address the influence of internal liquid dynamics on
liquid-solid friction. Taking advantage of the wide range of relaxation
timescales in supercooled liquids, we use a tuning-fork based AFM to measure
slippage of supercooled glycerol on mica at 30 kHz. We report a 2-orders of
magnitudes increase of slippage with decreasing temperature by only 30{\deg}c.
More importantly, as the bulk liquid dynamics are slown down as the temperature
decreases, we report a sharp decrease of the interfacial friction coefficient
in contrast with the usual assumption of thermally activated interfacial
dynamics.

<h3>Presence of a chiral soliton lattice in the chiral helimagnet  MnTa$_{3}$S$_{6}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Chiral helimagnetism was investigated in transition-metal intercalated
dichalcogenide single crystals of MnTa$_3$S$_6$. Small-angle neutron scattering
(SANS) experiments revealed the presence of harmonic chiral helimagnetic order,
which was successfully detected as a pair of satellite peaks in the SANS
pattern. The magnetization data are also supportive of the presence of chiral
soliton lattice (CSL) phase in MnTa$_3$S$_6$. The observed features are
summarized in the phase diagram of MnTa$_3$S$_6$, which is in strong contrast
with that observed in other dichalcogenides such as CrNb$_3$S$_6$ and
CrTa$_3$S$_6$. The presence of the remanent state provides tunable capability
of the number of chiral solitons at zero magnetic field in the CSL system,
which may be useful for memory device applications.

<h3>Quantifying orbital Rashba effect via harmonic Hall torque measurements  in transition-metal|Cu|Oxide structures</h3>

<br>
<br>
Spin-orbit interaction (SOI) plays a pivotal role in the charge-to-spin
conversion mechanisms, notably the spin Hall effect involving spin-dependent
deflection of conduction electrons and the interfacial spin Rashba-Edelstein
effect. In recent developments, significant current-induced torques have been
predicted and observed in material systems featuring interfaces with light
elements \textit{i.e.} possessing a weak SOI. These findings challenge existing
mechanisms and point to the potential involvement of the orbital counterpart of
electrons, namely the orbital Hall and orbital Rashba effects. Here, we
establish, in Pt|Co|Cu|AlOx stacking, the comparable strength between the
orbital Rashba effect at the Cu|AlOx interface and the effective spin Hall
effect in Pt|Co. Subsequently, we investigate the thickness dependence of an
intermediate Pt layer in Co|Pt|Cu|CuOx, revealing the strong signature of the
orbital Rashba effect at the Cu|CuOx interface besides the well-identified Pt
intrinsic spin Hall effect. Leveraging such contribution from the orbital
Rashba effect, we show a twofold enhancement in the effective torques on Co
through harmonic Hall measurements. This result is corroborated by
complementary spin Hall magneto-resistance and THz spectroscopy experiments.
Our results unveil unexplored aspects of the electron's orbital degree of
freedom, offering an alternative avenue for magnetization manipulation in
spintronic devices with potential implications for energy-efficient and
environmentally friendly technologies using abundant and light elements.

<br>
<br>
Recent improvements in the energy resolution of resonant inelastic x-ray
scattering experiments (RIXS) at the Cu-L$_3$ edge have enabled the study of
lattice, spin, and charge excitations. Here, we report on the detection of a
low intensity signal at 140meV, twice the energy of the bond-stretching (BS)
phonon mode, in the cuprate superconductor
$\textrm{Bi}_2\textrm{Sr}_2\textrm{Ca}\textrm{Cu}_2\textrm{O}_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212).
Ultra-high resolution polarimetric RIXS measurements allow us to resolve the
outgoing polarization of the signal and identify this feature as a two-phonon
excitation. Further, we study the connection between the two-phonon mode and
the BS one-phonon mode by constructing a joint density of states toy model that
reproduces the key features of the data.

<h3>Scale-invariant critical dynamics at eigenstate transitions</h3>

<br>
<br>
The notion of scale invariant dynamics is well established at late times in
quantum chaotic systems, as illustrated by the emergence of a ramp in the
spectral form factor (SFF). Building on the results of the preceding Letter
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 060404 (2023)], we explore features of scale invariant
dynamics of survival probability and SFF at criticality, i.e., at eigenstate
transitions from quantum chaos to localization. We show that, in contrast to
the quantum chaotic regime, the quantum dynamics at criticality do not only
exhibit scale invariance at late times, but also at much shorter times that we
refer to as mid-time dynamics. Our results apply to both quadratic and
interacting models. Specifically, we study Anderson models in dimensions three
to five and power-law random banded matrices for the former, and the quantum
sun model and the ultrametric model for the latter, as well as the
Rosenzweig-Porter model.

<h3>Interfacial and thickness effects in  La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$/YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7}$ superlattices</h3>

<br>
<br>
Superlattices of correlated oxides have been used to explore interfacial
effects and to achieve additional control over the physical properties of
individual constituents. In this work, we present a first-principles
perspective of the strain and thickness effects in
La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$/YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7}$ (LSMO/YBCO) superlattices. Our
findings indicate that the presence of epitaxial strain and LSMO leads to a
reduction of buckling parameters of the interfacial CuO$_2$ planes, as well as
the transfer of electrons from LSMO to YBCO. In addition, the change in Cu-3$d$
valence is slightly dependent on the LSMO layer thickness. More interestingly,
the in-plane ferromagnetic ground state within the CuO$_2$ planes near the
interface is induced due to the local moments centered at the copper atoms.
These local moments are decoupled from the charge transfer and, according to
our calculations, appear mainly due to the Mn $3d$-O $2p$-Cu $3d$ hybridization
being restricted to the interfacial region. The induced net magnetic ordering
in interfacial copper atoms may have implications in the control of the
superconducting state in the LSMO/YBCO superlattices.

<h3>In-depth investigations of size and occupancies in cobalt ferrite  nanoparticles by joint Rietveld refinements of X-ray and neutron powder  diffraction data</h3>

<br>
<br>
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and neutron powder diffraction (NPD) have
been used to investigate the crystal structure of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles
prepared via different hydrothermal synthesis routes, with particular attention
given to accurately determining the spinel inversion degrees. The study is
divided into four parts. In the first part, the investigations focus on the
influence of using different diffraction pattern combinations (NPD, Cu-source
PXRD and Co-source PXRD) for the structural modelling. It is found that
combining PXRD data from a Co source with NPD data offers a robust structural
model. The second part of the study evaluates the reproducibility of the
employed multipattern Rietveld refinement procedure using different data sets
collected on the same sample, as well as on equivalently prepared samples. The
refinement procedure gives reproducible results and reveals that the synthesis
method is likewise reproducible since only minor differences are noted between
the samples. The third part focuses on the structural consequences of (i) the
employed heating rate (achieved using three different hydrothermal reactor
types) and (ii) changing the cobalt salt in the precursors [aqueous salt
solutions of Co(CH3COOH)2, Co(NO3)2 and CoCl2] in the synthesis. It is found
that increasing the heating rate causes a change in the crystal structure (unit
cell and crystallite sizes) while the Co/Fe occupancy and magnetic parameters
remain similar in all cases. Also, changing the type of cobalt salt does not
alter the final crystal/magnetic structure of the CoFe2O4 nanoparticles. The
last part of this study is a consideration of the chemicals and parameters used
in the synthesis of the different samples.

<br>
<br>
The use of rare-earth-based permanent magnets is one of the critical points
for the development of the current technology. On the one hand, industry of the
rare-earths is highly polluting due to the negative environmental impact of
their extraction and, on the other hand, the sector is potentially dependent on
China. Therefore, investigation is required both in the development of
rare-earth-free permanent magnets and in sintering processes that enable their
greener fabrication with attractive magnetic properties at a more competitive
price. This work presents the use of a cold sintering process (CSP) followed by
a post-annealing at 1100 {\deg}C as a new way to sinter composite permanent
magnets based on strontium ferrite (SFO). Composites that incorporate a
percentage < 10% of an additional magnetic phase have been prepared and the
morphological, structural and magnetic properties have been evaluated after
each stage of the process. CSP induces a phase transformation of SFO in the
composites, which is partially recovered by the post-thermal treatment
improving the relative density to 92% and the magnetic response of the final
magnets with a coercivity of up to 3.0 kOe. Control of the magnetic properties
is possible through the composition and the grain size in the sintered magnets.
These attractive results show the potential of the sintering approach as an
alternative to develop modern rare-earth-free composite permanent magnets.

<h3>Te Vacancy-Driven Anomalous Transport in ZrTe$_{5}$ and HfTe$_{5}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
In the search for experimental signatures of quantum anomalies, the layered
Dirac materials ZrTe$_{5}$ and HfTe$_{5}$ have received much attention for
potentially hosting a chiral anomaly. These materials exhibit a negative
longitudinal magnetoresistance (NLMR) that is taken as a signature of broken
chiral symmetry. The anomalous transport properties of ZrTe$_{5}$ and
HfTe$_{5}$ are known to strongly correlate with the presence of Te vacancies,
prompting questions as to the microscopic mechanism driving the NLMR. In this
work, the effect of Te vacancies on the electronic structure of ZrTe$_{5}$ and
HfTe$_{5}$ is investigated via first-principles calculations to garner insight
into how they may modulate the transport properties of these materials. While
Te vacancies act as a source of effective compressive strain, they also produce
local changes to the electronic structure that cannot be explained simply as
volume effects. The reorganization of the electronic structure near the Fermi
energy indicates that Te vacancies can rationalize both spectroscopic and
transport measurements that have remained elusive in prior first-principles
studies. These results show that Te vacancies contribute, at least in part, to
the anomalous transport properties of ZrTe$_{5}$ and HfTe$_{5}$ and offer a
path towards understanding the possibility of a chiral anomaly in these
materials.

Ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) materials such as AlN and BN hold great promise for
future power electronics due to their exceptional properties. They exhibit
large band gaps, high breakdown fields, high thermal conductivity, and high
mechanical strengths. Although AlN and BN have been extensively researched,
however, their alloys, B$_{x}$Al$_{1-x}$N, are much less studied despite their
ability to offer tunable properties by adjusting $x$. In this article, we
predict the electronic properties of recently predicted 17 ground states of
B$_{x}$Al$_{1-x}$N in the $x=0-1$ range using first-principles density
functional theory and many-body perturbation theory within $GW$ approximation.
All the B$_{x}$Al$_{1-x}$N structures are found to be UWBG materials and have
band gaps that vary linearly from that of wurtzite-phase ($w$) AlN (6.19 eV) to
that of $w$-BN (7.47 eV). The bandstructures of B$_{x}$Al$_{1-x}$N show that a
direct-to-indirect bandgap crossover occurs near $x = 0.25$. Furthermore, we
find that B$_{x}$Al$_{1-x}$N alloys have much larger dielectric constants than
the constituent bulk materials (AlN=$9.3~\varepsilon_0$ or
BN=$7.3~\varepsilon_0$), with values reaching as high as $12.1~\varepsilon_0$.
These alloys are found to exhibit large dielectric breakdown fields in the
range 9--35 MV/cm with a linear dependence on $x$. This work provides the
much-needed advancement in the understanding of the properties of
B$_{x}$Al$_{1-x}$N to aid their application in next-generation devices.

Anisotropic two-dimensional layered materials with low-symmetric lattices
have attracted increasing attention due to their unique orientation-dependent
mechanical properties. Black arsenic (b-As), with the puckered structure,
exhibits extreme in-plane anisotropy in optical, electrical and thermal
properties. However, experimental research on mechanical properties of b-As is
very rare, although theoretical calculations predicted the exotic elastic
properties of b-As, such as anisotropic Young's modulus and negative Poisson's
ratio. Herein, experimental observations on highly anisotropic elastic
properties of b-As were demonstrated using our developed in situ tensile
straining setup based on the effective microelectromechanical system. The
cyclic and repeatable load-displacement curves proved that Young's modulus
along zigzag direction was ~1.6 times greater than that along armchair
direction, while the anisotropic ratio of ultimate strain reached ~2.5,
attributed to hinge structure in armchair direction. This study could provide
significant insights to design novel anisotropic materials and explore their
potential applications in nanomechanics and nanodevices.

<h3>Magnetocaloric effect in $\mathrm{Cu}_{3}$-like compounds using the  Heisenberg antiferromagnetic model in a triangular ring</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16080" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16080</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
In this work we present a theoretical investigation into an
antiferromagnetically coupled spin system, specifically ${\rm Cu}_{3}-X$
($\mathrm{X=As,Sb}$), which exhibits an isosceles triangular configuration or
slightly distorted equilateral triangular configuration, as previously
identified in reference {[}Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{96}, 107202 (2006){]}. This
system can be effectively represented by the Heisenberg model on a triangular
structure, taking into account the exchange interaction, the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, g-factors and external magnetic field, as
delineated in the aforementioned reference. By using numerical approach we
explore both zero-temperature and finite-temperature behaviors of a ${\rm
Cu}_{3}$-like antiferromagnetically coupled spin system. At zero temperature,
the system displays a 1/3 quasi-plateau magnetization, when the magnetic field
is varied. Moreover, we place particular emphasis on magnetic properties
including magnetization, magnetic susceptibility, entropy, and specific heat at
finite temperatures. Furthermore, we investigate the magnetocaloric effect as a
function of an externally imposed magnetic field, oriented both parallel and
perpendicular to the plane of the triangular structure. Interestingly, these
configurations demonstrate remarkably similar behavior for both orientations of
the magnetic field. Our investigation also includes an analysis of the
adiabatic curve, the Gr\"uneisen parameter, and the variation in entropy when
applied or removed the magnetic field. The magnetocaloric effect is found to be
more prominent in low the temperature region, typically at $T\sim1$K, for both
parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields at $\sim4.5$T and $\sim5$T,
respectively.

<h3>Relevant long-range interaction of the entanglement Hamiltonian emerges  from a short-range system</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Beyond the Li-Haldane conjecture, we find the entanglement Hamiltonian (EH)
is actually not closely similar to the original Hamiltonian on the virtual
edge. Unexpectedly, the EH has some relevant long-range interacting terms which
hugely affect the physics. Without loss of generality, we study a spin-1/2
Heisenberg bilayer to obtain the entanglement information between the two
layers. Although the entanglement spectrum carrying Goldstone mode seems like a
Heisenberg model on a single layer which is consistent with Li-Haldane
conjecture, we demonstrate there actually is a finite temperature phase
transition for the EH. The results violate the Mermin-Wagner theorem which
means there should be relevant long-range terms in the EH. It reveals that the
Li-Haldane conjecture ignores necessary corrections for the EH which may lead
totally different physics.

Halide perovskites have been extensively studied as materials of interest for
optoelectronic applications. There is a major emphasis on ways to tailor the
stability, defect behavior, electronic band structure, and optical absorption
in halide perovskites, by changing the composition or structure. In this work,
we present our contribution to this field in the form of a comprehensive
computational investigation of properties as a function of the perovskite
phase, different degrees of lattice strains and octahedral distortion and
rotation, and the ordering of cations in perovskite alloys. We performed first
principles-based density functional theory computations using multiple
semi-local and non-local hybrid functionals to calculate optimized lattice
parameters, energies of decomposition, electronic band gaps, and theoretical
photovoltaic efficiencies. Trends and critical observations from the
high-throughput dataset are discussed, especially in terms of the range of
optoelectronic properties achievable while keeping the material in a
(meta)stable phase or distorted, strained, or differently ordered polymorph.
All data is made openly available to the community and is currently being
utilized to train state-of-the-art machine learning models for accelerated
prediction and discovery, as well as to guide rational experimental discovery.

<h3>Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics of steady-state fluid transport  through a 2D membrane driven by a concentration gradient</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16103" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16103</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We use a novel non-equilibrium algorithm to simulate steady-state fluid
transport through a two-dimensional (2D) membrane due to a concentration
gradient by molecular dynamics (MD) for the first time. We confirm that, as
required by the Onsager reciprocal relations in the linear-response regime, the
solution flux obtained using this algorithm agrees with the excess solute flux
obtained from an established non-equilibrium MD algorithm for pressure-driven
flow. In addition, we show that the concentration-gradient solution flux in
this regime is quantified far more efficiently by explicitly applying a
transmembrane concentration difference using our algorithm than by applying
Onsager reciprocity to pressure-driven flow. The simulated fluid fluxes are
captured with reasonable quantitative accuracy by our previously derived
continuum theory of concentration-gradient-driven fluid transport through a 2D
membrane [J. Chem. Phys. 151, 044705 (2019)] for a wide range of solution and
membrane parameters even though the simulated pore sizes are only several times
the size of the fluid particles. The simulations deviate from the theory
especially for strong solute--membrane interactions relative to the thermal
energy, for which the theoretical approximations break down. Our findings will
be beneficial for molecular-level understanding of fluid transport driven by
concentration gradients through membranes made from 2D materials, which have
diverse applications in energy harvesting, molecular separations, and
biosensing.

<h3>Solving the Bethe-Salpeter Equation in Real Frequencies at Finite  Temperature</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation combined with solutions of
Bethe-Salpeter equation offers a powerful tool for studies of strong
correlation effects arising in condensed matter models, nuclear physics,
quantum field theories, and real materials. The standard finite-temperature
approach would be to first solve the problem in the Matsubara representation
and then apply numerical analytic continuation to the real-frequency axis to
link theoretical results with experimental probes, but this ill-conditioned
procedure often distorts important spectral features even for very accurate
imaginary-frequency data. We demonstrate that the ladder-type
finite-temperature Bethe-Salpeter equation in the Hartree-Fock basis for the
3-point vertex function and, ultimately, system's polarization can be
accurately solved directly on the real frequency axis using the diagrammatic
Monte Carlo technique and series resummation. We illustrate the method by
applying it to the homogeneous electron gas model and demonstrate how multiple
scattering events renormalize Landau damping.

<br>
<i>Md. Sajidul Islam, Razu Ahmed, M.M. Hossain, M.A. Ali, M.M. Uddin, S.H. Naqib</i>
<br>
<br>
Here we report the structural, elastic, bonding, thermo-mechanical,
optoelectronic and superconducting state properties of recently discovered XIr3
(X = La, Th) superconductors utilizing the density functional theory (DFT). The
elastic, bonding, thermal and optical properties of these compounds are
investigated for the first time. The calculated lattice and superconducting
state parameters are in reasonable agreement to those found in the literature.
In the ground state, both the compounds are mechanically stable and possess
highly ductile character, high machinability, low Debye temperature, low bond
hardness and significantly high melting point. The thermal conductivities of
the compounds are found to be very low which suggests that they can be used for
thermal insulation purpose. The population analysis and charge density
distribution map confirm the presence of both ionic and covalent bonds in the
compounds with ionic bond playing dominant roles. The calculated band structure
and DOS profiles indicate metallic character. Unlike the significant anisotropy
observed in elastic and thermal properties, all the optical constants of these
compounds exhibit almost isotropic behavior. The optical constants correspond
very well with the electronic band structure and DOS features. We have
estimated the superconducting transition temperature of the compounds in this
work.

<br>
<br>
Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Cr$_2$O$_4$ crystallizes as a normal spinel in the cubic $Fd
\overline{3}m$ space group, and the end members have been reported to display a
region of collinear ferrimagnetism as well as a low-temperature spin-spiral
state with variable coherence lengths from 3 nm to 10 nm in polycrystalline
samples. Here, we present the synthesis of the entire solid solution, and data
showing that the ferrimagnetic ordering temperature as well as the spin-spiral
lock-in temperature are tunable with the Co/Mn ratio. The peak magnetocaloric
entropy change was determined to be $\Delta S_M$ = -5.63 J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$
in an applied magnetic field change of $\Delta H$ = 0 T to 5 T for the Mn
end-member at the ferrimagnetic ordering temperature. Using density functional
theory (DFT), we explore the shortcomings of the magnetic deformation proxy to
identify trends in $\Delta S_M$ across composition in this spinel system, and
explore future extensions of theory to address these discrepancies.

<h3>Theory of Non-Hermitian Fermionic Superfluidity on a Honeycomb Lattice:  Interplay between Exceptional Manifolds and Van Hove Singularity</h3>

<br>
<i>Soma Takemori, Kazuki Yamamoto, Akihisa Koga</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the non-Hermitian fermionic superfluidity subject to dissipation of
Cooper pairs on a honeycomb lattice, for which we analyze the attractive
Hubbard model with a complex-valued interaction. Remarkably, we demonstrate the
emergence of the dissipation-induced superfluid phase that is anomalously
enlarged by a cusp on the phase boundary. We find that this unconventional
phase transition originates from the interplay between exceptional lines and
van Hove singularity, which has no counterpart in equilibrium. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the infinitesimal dissipation induces the nontrivial
superfluid solution at the critical point. Our results can be tested in
ultracold atoms with photoassociation techniques by postselcting special
measurement outcomes with the use of quantum-gas microscopy and pave the way
for understanding non-Hermitian many-body physics triggered by exceptional
manifolds in open quantum systems.

<h3>Reconstructing microstructures from statistical descriptors using neural  cellular automata</h3>

<br>
<br>
The problem of generating microstructures of complex materials in silico has
been approached from various directions including simulation, Markov, deep
learning and descriptor-based approaches. This work presents a hybrid method
that is inspired by all four categories and has interesting scalability
properties. A neural cellular automaton is trained to evolve microstructures
based on local information. Unlike most machine learning-based approaches, it
does not directly require a data set of reference micrographs, but is trained
from statistical microstructure descriptors that can stem from a single
reference. This means that the training cost scales only with the complexity of
the structure and associated descriptors. Since the size of the reconstructed
structures can be set during inference, even extremely large structures can be
efficiently generated. Similarly, the method is very efficient if many
structures are to be reconstructed from the same descriptor for statistical
evaluations. The method is formulated and discussed in detail by means of
various numerical experiments, demonstrating its utility and scalability.

<h3>Adiabatic theorem for classical stochastic processes</h3>

<br>
<br>
We apply adiabatic theorems developed for quantum mechanics to stochastic
annealing processes described by the classical master equation with a
time-dependent generator. When the instantaneous stationary state is unique and
the minimum decay rate g is nonzero, the time-evolved state is basically
relaxed to the instantaneous stationary state. By formulating an asymptotic
expansion rigorously, we derive conditions for the annealing time T that the
state is close to the instantaneous stationary state. Depending on the time
dependence of the generator, typical conditions are written as T> const/g^a
with 1<a<2. We also find that a rigorous treatment gives the scaling T>const|ln
g|/g^2.

<br>
<br>
The challenge of achieving ultrafast switching of electric polarization in
ferroelectric materials remains unsolved, as there is no experimental evidence
of such switching to date. In this study, we have developed an enhanced model
that describes switching within a two-dimensional space of generalized
coordinates at THz pulses. Our findings indicate that stable switching in
barium titanate cannot be achieved through a single linearly polarized pulse.
When the intensity of the linearly polarized pulse reaches a certain threshold,
the sample experiences depolarization, but not stable switching. Our study also
reveals that phonon friction plays a minor role in the switching dynamics and
provides an estimate of the optimal parameters of the perturbing pulse with the
lowest intensity that results in depolarization of an initially polarized
sample.

<h3>Pressure-induced one-dimensional oxygen ion diffusion channel in  lead-apatite</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16218" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16218</a>

<br>
<br>
Recently, Lee et al. claimed that the experimental observation of
room-temperature ambient-pressure superconductivity in a Cu-doped lead-apatite
(Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O). The study revealed the Cu doping induces a chemical
pressure, resulting in a structural contraction of one-dimensional Cu-O-Cu
atomic column. This unique structure promotes a one-dimensional electronic
conduction channel along the c-axis mediated by the O atoms, which may be
related to superconductivity. These O atoms occupy 1/4 of the equivalent
positions along the c-axis and exhibit a low diffusion activation energy of 0.8
eV, indicating the possibility of diffusion between these equivalent positions.
Here, using machine-learning based deep potential, we predict the
pressure-induced fast diffusion of 1/4-occupied O atoms along the
one-dimensional channel in Pb10(PO4)6O at 500 K, while the frameworks of Pb
triangles and PO4 tetrahedrons remain stable. The calculation results also
indicate Cu doping can provide appropriate effective chemical pressure,
indicating the one-dimensional ion diffusion channel may appear in
Pb9Cu(PO4)6O, even at ambient pressure. Our finding shows that the
one-dimensional ions diffusion channel may be an important factor to affects
the fabrication and electrical measurement of doped lead-apatite.

<h3>Fast rare events in exit times distributions of jump processes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16227" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16227</a>
<br>
<i>Alessandro Vezzani, Raffaella Burioni</i>
<br>
<br>
Rare events in the first-passage distributions of jump processes are capable
of triggering anomalous reactions or series of events. Estimating their
probability is particularly important when the jump probabilities have
broad-tailed distributions, and rare events are therefore not so rare. We study
three jump processes that are used to model a wide class of stochastic
processes ranging from biology to transport in disordered systems, ecology and
finance. We consider discrete time random-walks, continuous time random-walks
and the L\'evy-Lorentz gas and determine the exact form of the scaling function
for the probability distribution of fast rare events, in which the jump process
exits in a very short time at a large distance opposite to the starting point.
For this estimation we use the so called big jump principle, and we show that
in the regime of fast rare events the exit time distributions are not
exponentially suppressed, even in the case of normal diffusion. This implies
that fast rare events are actually much less rare than predicted by the usual
estimates of large deviations and can occur on timescales orders of magnitude
shorter than expected. Our results are confirmed by extensive numerical
simulations.

<h3>Influence of Dopamine Methacrylamide on swelling behaviour and  nanomechanical properties of PNIPAM microgels</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16229" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16229</a>
<br>
<i>Sandra Forg, Xuhong Guo, Regine von Klitzing</i>
<br>
<br>
The combination of the catechol-containing co-monomer dopamine methacrylamide
(DMA) with stimuli-responsive microgels such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
(PNIPAM) bears a huge potential in research and for applications due to the
versatile properties of catechols. This research gives first detailed insights
into the influence of DMA on the swelling of PNIPAM microgels and the
correlation with their nanomechanical properties. Dynamic light scattering
(DLS) was used to analyse the swelling behaviour of microgels in bulk solution.
The incorporation of DMA decreases the volume phase transition temperature
(VPTT) and completion temperature (VPT CT) due to its higher hydrophobicity
when compared to NIPAM, while sharpening the transition. The cross-linking
ability of DMA decreases swelling ratios and mesh sizes of the microgels.
Microgels adsorbed at the solid surface are characterised by atomic force
microscopy (AFM): Scanning provides information about the microgel's shape on
the surface and force spectroscopy measurements determines their nanomechanical
properties ($E$ modulus). As the DMA content increases, microgels protrude more
from the surface, correlating with an increase of $E$ modulus and a stiffening
of the microgels - confirming the cross-linking ability of DMA. Force
spectroscopy measurements below and above the VPTT display a stiffening of the
microgels with the incorporation of DMA and upon heating across it's entire
cross-section. The affine network factor $\beta$, derived from the Flory-Rehner
theory describing the elasticity and swelling of the microgel network, is
linearly correlated with the $E$ moduli of the microgels for both - pure PNIPAM
and P(NIPAM-co-DMA) microgels. However, for large amounts of DMA, DMA appears
to hinder the microgel shrinking, while still ensuring mechanical stiffness,
possibly due to catechol interactions within the microgel network.

We develop a combined theoretical and experimental method for estimating the
amount of heating that occurs in metallic nanoparticles that are being imaged
in an electron microscope. We model the thermal transport between the
nanoparticle and the supporting material using molecular dynamics and
eqivariant neural network potentials. The potentials are trained to Density
Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, and we show that an ensemble of
potentials can be used as an estimate of the errors the neural network make in
predicting energies and forces. This can be used both to improve the networks
during the training phase, and to validate the performance when simulating
systems too big to be described by DFT. The energy deposited into the
nanoparticle by the electron beam is estimated by measuring the mean free path
of the electrons and the average energy loss, both are done with Electron
Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) within the microscope. In combination, this
allows us to predict the heating incurred by a nanoparticle as a function of
its size, its shape, the support material, and the electron beam energy and
intensity.

This chapter delves into the realm of computational complexity, exploring the
world of challenging combinatorial problems and their ties with statistical
physics. Our exploration starts by delving deep into the foundations of
combinatorial challenges, emphasizing their nature. We will traverse the class
P, which comprises problems solvable in polynomial time using deterministic
algorithms, contrasting it with the class NP, where finding efficient solutions
remains an enigmatic endeavor, understanding the intricacies of algorithmic
transitions and thresholds demarcating the boundary between tractable and
intractable problems. We will discuss the implications of the P versus NP
problem, representing one of the profoundest unsolved enigmas of computer
science and mathematics, bearing a tantalizing reward for its resolution.
Drawing parallels between combinatorics and statistical physics, we will

Coulomb interactions among electrons and holes in two-dimensional (2D)
semimetals with overlapping valence and conduction bands can give rise to a
correlated insulating ground state via exciton formation and condensation. One
candidate material in which such excitonic state uniquely combines with
non-trivial band topology are atomic monolayers of tungsten ditelluride (WTe2),
in which a 2D topological excitonic insulator (2D TEI) forms. However, the
detailed mechanism of the 2D bulk gap formation in WTe2, in particular with
regard to the role of Coulomb interactions, has remained a subject of ongoing
debate. Here, we show that WTe2 is susceptible to a gate-tunable quantum phase
transition, evident from an abrupt collapse of its 2D bulk energy gap upon
ambipolar field-effect doping. Such gate tunability of a 2D TEI, into either n-
and p-type semimetals, promises novel handles of control over non-trivial 2D
superconductivity with excitonic pairing.

Bilayer moir\'e structures have attracted significant attention recently due
to their spatially modulated layer degrees of freedom. However, the
layer-dependent transport mechanism in the moir\'e structures is still a
problem to be explored. Here we investigate the layer-dependent transport
properties regulated by the strain, the interlayer bias and the number of
moir\'e periods in a strained moir\'e homobilayer TMDs nanoribbon based on
low-energy efficient models. The charge carriers can pass perfectly through the
scattering region with the moir\'e potential. While, it is noted that the
overall transmission coefficient is mainly contributed from either intralayer
or interlayer transmissions. The transition of transport mechanism between
intralayer and interlayer transmissions can be achieved by adjusting the
strain. The intralayer transmissions are suppressed and one of the interlayer
transmissions can be selected by a vertical external electric field, which can
cause a controllable layer polarization. Moreover, the staggered intralayer and
interlayer minigaps are formed as the number of moir\'e periods increases in
the scattering region due to the overlap of the wave functions in two adjacent
moir\'e periods. Our finding points to an opportunity to realize layer
functionalities by the strain and electric field.

Bi2O2Se has attracted intensive attention due to its potential in
electronics, optoelectronics, as well as ferroelectric applications. Despite
that, there have only been a handful of experimental studies based on ultrafast
spectroscopy to elucidate the carrier dynamics in Bi2O2Se thin films, Different
groups have reported various ultrafast timescales and associated mechanisms
across films of different thicknesses. A comprehensive understanding in
relation to thickness and fluence is still lacking. In this work, we have
systematically explored the thickness-dependent Raman spectroscopy and
ultrafast carrier dynamics in chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown Bi2O2Se
thin films on mica substrate with thicknesses varying from 22.44 nm down to
4.62 nm at both low and high pump fluence regions. Combining the thickness
dependence and fluence dependence of the slow decay time, we demonstrate a
ferroelectric transition in the thinner (< 8 nm) Bi2O2Se films, influenced by
substrate-induced compressive strain and non-equilibrium states. Moreover, this
transition can be manifested under highly non-equilibrium states. Our results
deepen the understanding of the interplay between the ferroelectric phase and
semiconducting characteristics of Bi2O2Se thin films, providing a new route to
manipulate the ferroelectric transition.

A physical artificial complex-valued neuron is formed by four-wave mixing in
a homogeneous three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. Bragg beamsplitter
pulses prepare superpositions of three plane-waves states as an input- and the
fourth wave as an output signal. The nonlinear dynamics of the non-degenerate
four-wave mixing process leads to Josephson-like oscillations within the closed
four-dimensional subspace and defines the activation function of a neuron. Due
to the high number of symmetries, closed form solutions can be found by
quadrature and agree with numerical simulation. The ideal behaviour of an
isolated four-wave mixing setup is compared to a situation with additional
population of rogue states. We observe a robust persistence of the main
oscillation. As an application for neural learning of this physical system, we
train it on the XOR problem. After $100$ training epochs, the neuron responds
to input data correctly at the $10^{-5}$ error level.

Broken spatial inversion symmetry in semiconducting materials with
time-reversal pair valleys can exhibit valley polarization. Based on
first-principles calculations, here we propose a lateral heterostructure of
kagome lattice of hBN and hexagonal graphene domains that exhibits opposite
Berry curvature in inequivalent K and K' valleys. Explicit consideration of
excitonic scattering processes within GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation formalism
confirm insignificant intervalley coupling and consequent valley polarization
ability along with 0.46 eV higher binding energy of triplet excitons. Such
heterostructure with large charge carrier mobility can be exploited for
advanced valleytronic and optoelectronic applications.

The condensate of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) pair in the ground
state, which may contain information on both topology and spin pairing,
promises the superconductivity of the system. In this paper, we study a
singlet-triplet spin paring model on a square lattice and investigate the
consequences of the competition of on-site and nearest neighbor pairing
parameters. We show that the ground state of the system has the form of the
condensate of the BCS pair, and the topological transition is associated with
the nonanalytic behavior of the pairing order parameters. A real space
correlation function on opposite spin direction is introduced to characterizing
the topological phase of the many-body ground state. Numerical results
demonstrate that this method works well in the presence of disordered
perturbation, lattice defects, or irregular boundary conditions. The real space
correlation function between two edges of the system is also discussed, which
directly reflects the existence of topological edge modes in the many-body
ground state.

The magnetic dilution of Vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc) within the
isostructural diamagnetic Titanyl phthalocyanine (TiOPc) affords promising
molecular spin qubit platforms for solid-state quantum computing. The
development of quantitative methods for determining how the interactions with a
supporting substrate impact the electronic structure of the system are
fundamental to determine their potential integration in physical devices. In
this work we propose a combined approach based on X-ray absorption spectroscopy
(XAS), atomic multiplet calculations, and density functional theory (DFT) to
investigate the 3d orbital level structure of VOPc on TiOPc/Ag(100). We
characterize VOPc in different molecular environments realized by changing the
thickness of TiOPc interlayer and adsorption configuration on Ag(100). The
characteristic XAS features of the molecular film structure have been analyzed
using atomic multiplet calculations. We use a Bayesian optimization algorithm
to accelerate the parameter search process in the multiplet calculations and
identify the ground state properties, such as the 3d orbital occupancy and
splitting and intra-atomic interactions. Our analysis indicates that VOPc
retains its spin S = 1/2 character in all configurations. Conversely, the
energy separation and sequence of the unoccupied V 3d orbitals sensitively
depend on the interaction with the surface and TiOPc interlayer. Wevalidate the
atomic orbital picture obtained from the multiplet model by comparison with
DFT, which further allows us to understand the VOPc electronic properties using
a molecular orbital description.

The effective spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg-Ising chain materials,
ACo$_2$V$_2$O$_8$, A = Sr, Ba, are a rich source of exotic fundamental
phenomena and have been investigated for their model magnetic properties both
in zero and non-zero magnetic fields. Here we investigate a new member of the
family, namely PbCo$_2$V$_2$O$_8$. We synthesize powder and single crystal
samples of PbCo$_2$V$_2$O$_8$ and determine its magnetic structure using
neutron diffraction. Furthermore, the magnetic field/temperature phase diagrams
for magnetic field applied along the c, a, and [110] crystallographic
directions in the tetragonal unit cell are determined via magnetization and
heat capacity measurements. A complex series of phases and quantum phase
transitions are discovered that depend strongly on both the magnitude and
direction of the field. Our results show that \pcvo is an effective spin-1/2
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg-Ising chain with properties that are in general
comparable to those of SrCo$_2$V$_2$O$_8$ and BaCo$_2$V$_2$O$_8$. One
interesting departure from the results of these related compounds, is however,
the discovery of a new field-induced phase for the field direction $H\|$[110]
which has not been previously observed.

Topoelectrical circuits are meta-material realizations of topological
features of condensed matter systems. In this work, we discuss experimental
methods that allow a fast and straightforward detection of the spectral
features of these systems from the two-point impedance of the circuit. This
allows to deduce the full spectrum of a topoelectrical circuit consisting of N
sites from a single two-point measurement of the frequency resolved impedance.
In contrast, the standard methods rely on $N^2$ measurements of admittance
matrix elements with a subsequent diagonalization on a computer. We
experimentally test our approach by constructing a Fibonacci topoelectrical
circuit. Although the spectrum of this chain is fractal, i.e., more complex
than the spectra of periodic systems, our approach is successful in recovering
its eigenvalues. Our work promotes the topoelectrical circuits as an ideal
platform to measure spectral properties of various (quasi)crystalline systems.

<h3>Identifying Crystal Structures from XRD Data using Enumeration Beyond  Known Prototypes</h3>

The large amount of powder diffraction data for which the corresponding
crystal structures have not yet been identified suggests the existence of
numerous undiscovered, physically relevant crystal structure prototypes. In
this paper, we present a scheme to resolve powder diffraction data into crystal
structures with precise atomic coordinates by screening the space of all
possible atomic arrangements, i.e., structural prototypes, including those not
previously observed, using a pre-trained machine learning (ML) model. This
involves: (i) enumerating all possible symmetry-confined ways in which a given
composition can be accommodated in a given space group, (ii) ranking the
element-assigned prototype representations using energies predicted using Wren
ML model [Sci. Adv. 8, eabn4117 (2022)], (iii) assigning and perturbing atoms
along the degree of freedom allowed by the Wyckoff positions to match the
experimental diffraction data (iv) validating the thermodynamic stability of
the material using density-functional theory (DFT). An advantage of the
presented method is that it does not rely on a database of previously observed
prototypes and, therefore is capable of finding crystal structures with
entirely new symmetric arrangements of atoms. We demonstrate the workflow on
unidentified XRD spectra from the ICDD database and identify a number of stable
structures, where a majority turns out to be derivable from known prototypes,
but at least two are found to not be part of our prior structural data sets.

A formalism based on the Fermionic Functional Renormalization Group approach
to interacting electron models defined on a lattice is presented. One loop flow
equations for the coupling constants and susceptibilities in the
particle-particle and particle-hole channels are derived in weak coupling
conditions. It is shown that lattice effects manifest themselves through the
curvature of the spectrum and the dependence of the coupling constants on
momenta. This method is then applied to the determination of the phase diagram
of the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model as a function of band filling and
their critical comparison with the predictions of the field theory continuum
limit and available numerical results. This method is then applied to the
one-dimensional extended Hubbard model; we thoroughly discuss the evolution of
the phase diagram, and in particular the fate of the bond centered charge
density wave phase, as the system is doped away from half-filling. Our findings
are compared to the predictions of the field theory continuum limit and
available numerical results.

<h3>Local stability of spheres via the convex hull and the radical Voronoi  diagram</h3>

Jamming is an emergent phenomenon wherein the local stability of individual
particles percolates to form a globally rigid structure. However, the onset of
rigidity does not imply that every particle becomes rigid, and indeed some
remain locally unstable. These particles, if they become unmoored from their
neighbors, are called \textit{rattlers}, and their identification is critical
to understanding the rigid backbone of a packing, as these particles cannot
bear stress. The accurate identification of rattlers, however, can be a
time-consuming process, and the currently accepted method lacks a simple
geometric interpretation. In this manuscript, we propose two simpler
classifications of rattlers based on the convex hull of contacting neighbors
and the maximum inscribed sphere of the radical Voronoi cell, each of which
provides geometric insight into the source of their instability. Furthermore,
the convex hull formulation can be generalized to explore stability in
hyperstatic soft sphere packings, spring networks, non-spherical packings, and
mean-field non-central-force potentials.

The cubic polytype of silicon (Si) is the most commercialized semiconductor
material and finds applications in numerous electronic and optoelectronic
devices such as solar cells. However, recent reports on the synthesis of the
hexagonal 4H Si polytype have attracted the attention of the scientific
community to understand its functional properties. Here we report the
electronic, vibrational, and optical properties of the 4H Si polytype obtained
with predictive first-principles calculations. We find that, compared to the
cubic polytype, 4H Si shows a slightly narrower indirect gap by $\sim$ 0.05 eV.
By calculating its direct and phonon-assisted optical spectra, we show that 4H
Si exhibits a stronger absorption coefficient than cubic Si across the visible
and IR spectral regions. We further evaluate the short-circuit current density
of textured thin-films, and we demonstrate that 4H Si can achieve the same
short-circuit current density for a five times thinner film compared to the
cubic polytype. Our work demonstrates the advantages of 4H Si for thin-film
silicon-based solar-cell applications.

Kagome metals are important for exploring emergent phenomena due to the
interplay between band topology and electron correlation.Motivated by the
recent discovery of charge density wave in a kagome lattice antiferromagnet
FeGe,we investigate the impact of Sb doping on the structural,charge and magnet
order of FeGe.The charge density wave is rapidly suppressed by Sb doping(~1.5%)
and the antiferromagnet ordering temperature gradually shifts to 280K for
FeGe0.7Sb0.3.For FeGe1-xSbx with x>0.1,crystal structures with slightly
distorted Fe kagome lattice are formed.Their magnet anisotropy has significant
change,temperature driven spin-reorientation and field-induced spin-flop
transition are identified from magnetization measurement.Interestingly.neutron
diffraction reveals noncollinear magnet orders could possibly be unconventional
and resulted from onsite repulsion and filling condition of kagome flat band,as
predicted by a recent thoeretical work.

<h3>Kinetics of the one-dimensional voter model with long-range interactions</h3>

The one-dimensional long-range voter model, where an agent takes the opinion
of another at distance $r$ with probability $\propto r^{-\alpha}$, is studied
analytically. The model displays rich and diverse features as $\alpha$ is
changed. For $\alpha >3$ the behavior is similar to the one of the
nearest-neighbor version, with the formation of ordered domains whose typical
size grows as $R(t)\propto t^{1/2}$ until consensus (a fully ordered
configuration) is reached. The correlation function $C(r,t)$ between two agents
at distance $r$ obeys dynamical scaling with sizeable corrections at large
distances $r>r^*(t)$, slowly fading away in time. For $2< \alpha \le 3$
violations of scaling appear, due to the simultaneous presence of two
lengh-scales, the size of domains growing as $t^{(\alpha-2)/(\alpha-1)}$, and
the distance $L(t)\propto t^{1/(\alpha-1)}$ over which correlations extend. For
$\alpha \le 2$ the system reaches a partially ordered stationary state,
characterised by an algebraic correlator, % $C(r)\propto r^{-(2-\alpha)}$,
whose lifetime diverges in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely many agents,
so that consensus is not reached. For a finite system escape towards the fully
ordered configuration is finally promoted by development of large distance
correlations. In a system of $N$ sites, global consensus is achieved after a
time $T \propto N^2$ for $\alpha>3$, $T \propto N^{\alpha-1}$ for $2<\alpha \le
3$, and $T \propto N$ for $\alpha \le 2$.

Chimera states are a captivating occurrence in which a system comprised of
multiple interconnected elements exhibits a distinctive combination of
synchronized and desynchronized behavior. The emergence of these states can be
attributed to the complex interdependence between quantum entanglement and the
delicate balance of interactions among system constituents. The emergence of
Discrete Time Crystal (DTC) in typical many-body periodically driven systems
occurs when there is a breaking of time translation symmetry. Coexisting
coupled DTC and a ferromagnetic dynamically many-body localized (DMBL) phase at
distinct regions have been investigated under the controlled spin rotational
error of a disorder-free spin-1/2 chain for different types of spin-spin
interactions. We contribute a novel approach for the emergence of the
DTC-DMBL-Chimera phase, which is robust against external static fields in a
periodically driven quantum many-body system.

Identifying intrinsic noncollinear magnetic order in monolayer van der Waals
(vdW) crystals is highly desirable for understanding the delicate magnetic
interactions at reduced spatial constraints and miniaturized spintronic
applications, but remains elusive in experiments. Here, we achieved
spin-resolved imaging of helimagnetism at atomic scale in monolayer NiI2
crystals, that were grown on graphene-covered SiC(0001) substrate, using
spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy. Our experiments identify the
existence of a spin spiral state with canted plane in monolayer NiI2. The spin
modulation Q vector of the spin spiral is determined as (0.2203, 0, 0), which
is different from its bulk value or its in-plane projection, but agrees well
with our first principles calculations. The spin spiral surprisingly indicates
collective spin switching behavior under magnetic field, whose origin is
ascribed to the incommensurability between the spin spiral and the crystal
lattice. Our work unambiguously identifies the helimagnetic state in monolayer
NiI2, paving the way for illuminating its expected type-II multiferroic order
and developing spintronic devices based on vdW magnets.

Trilayer graphene exhibits valley-protected gapless states when the stacking
order changes from ABC to CBA and a gate voltage is applied to outer layers.
Some of these states survive strong distortions of the trilayer. For example,
they persist when the outer layers are partially devoid yielding a system of
two trilayers of different stacking order connected by a strip of a single
graphene layer. Here we investigate how these states respond to another
perturbation, i.e., the presence of magnetic defects, which we model as
pi-vacancies. We show that the gap states hybridize with the defect states and
strongly spin-split. More importantly, it is demonstrated that by changing the
gate voltage value one can change the spin density of the gap states and the
corresponding currents at the Fermi level.

Remarkable recent experiments have observed fractional quantum anomalous Hall
(FQAH) effects at zero field and unusually high temperatures in twisted
semiconductor bilayer $t$MoTe$_2$. Intriguing observations in these experiments
such as the absence of integer Hall effects at twist angles where a fractional
Hall effect is observed, do however remain unexplained. The experimental phase
diagram as a function of twist angle remains to be established. By
comprehensive numerical study, we show that band mixing has large qualitative
and quantitative effects on the energetics of competing states and their energy
gaps throughout the twist angle range $\theta\leq 4^\circ$. This lays the
ground for the detailed realistic study of a rich variety of strongly
correlated twisted semiconductor multilayers and an understanding of the phase

We demonstrate epitaxial lattice-matched Al$_{0.89}$Sc$_{0.11}$N/GaN ten and
twenty period distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) grown on c-plane bulk n-type
GaN substrates by plasma-enhanced molecular beam epitaxy (PA-MBE). Resulting
from a rapid increase of in-plane lattice coefficient as scandium is
incorporated into AlScN, we measure a lattice-matched condition to $c$-plane
GaN for a Sc content of just 11\%, resulting in a large refractive index
mismatch $\mathrm{\Delta n}$ greater than 0.3 corresponding to an index
contrast of $\mathrm{\Delta n/n_{GaN}}$ = 0.12 with GaN. The DBRs demonstrated
here are designed for a peak reflectivity at a wavelength of 400 nm reaching a
reflectivity of 0.98 for twenty periods. It is highlighted that AlScN/GaN
multilayers require fewer periods for a desired reflectivity than other
lattice-matched Bragg reflectors such as those based on AlInN/GaN multilayers.

In this paper we revisit the mathematical foundations of nonlinear
viscoelasticity. We study the underlying geometry of viscoelastic deformations,
and in particular, the intermediate configuration. Starting from the
multiplicative decomposition of deformation gradient into elastic and viscous
parts $\mathbf{F}=\Fe\Fv\,$, we point out that $\Fv$ can be either a material
tensor ($\Fe$ is a two-point tensor) or a two-point tensor ($\Fe$ is a spatial
tensor). We show that based on physical grounds the second choice is
unacceptable. It is assumed that the free energy density is the sum of an
equilibrium and a non-equilibrium part. The symmetry transformations and their
action on the total, elastic, and viscous deformation gradients are carefully
discussed. Following a two-potential approach the governing equations of
nonlinear viscoelasticity are derived using the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle.
We discuss the constitutive and kinetic equations for compressible and
incompressible isotropic, transversely isotropic, orthotropic, and monoclinic
viscoelastic solids. We finally semi-analytically study creep and relaxation in
three examples of universal deformations.

We determine the ground states and excitation spectra of the paradigmatic
four-flavour Heisenberg model with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor exchange
couplings on the triangular lattice in a field controlling the population
imbalance of flavor pairs. Such a system arises in the strongly correlated
limit of moir\'{e} bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides in an electric
displacement field or in-plane magnetic field, and can be simulated via
ultracold alkaline-earth atoms. We argue that the field tunes between effective
SU(4) and SU(2) symmetries in the balanced and fully polarised limits and
employ a combination of mean-field calculations, flavour-wave theory, and exact
diagonalisation to analyse the intermediate, imbalanced regime. We find
different symmetry-broken phases with simultaneous spin and excitonic order
depending on the field and next-nearest-neighbor coupling. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that there is a strongly fluctuating regime without long-range
order that connects candidate spin liquids of the SU(2) and SU(4) limit. The
strong fluctuations are facilitated by an extensive classical degeneracy of the
model, and we argue that they are also responsible for a strong polarisability
at 1/3 polarisation that survives from the mean-field level to the exact
spectrum.

Rare-earth ion dopants in solid-state hosts are ideal candidates for quantum
communication technologies such as quantum memory, due to the intrinsic
spin-photon interface of the rare-earth ion combined with the integration
methods available in the solid-state. Erbium-doped cerium oxide (Er:CeO$_2$) is
a particularly promising platform for such a quantum memory, as it combines the
telecom-wavelength (~1.5 $\mu$m) 4f-4f transition of erbium, a predicted long
electron spin coherence time supported by CeO$_2$, and is also near
lattice-matched to silicon for heteroepitaxial growth. In this work, we report
on the epitaxial growth of Er:CeO$_2$ thin films on silicon using molecular
beam epitaxy (MBE), with controlled erbium concentration down to 2 parts per
million (ppm). We carry out a detailed microstructural study to verify the
CeO$_2$ host structure, and characterize the spin and optical properties of the
embedded Er$^{3+}$ ions. In the 2-3 ppm Er regime, we identify EPR linewidths
of 245(1) MHz, optical inhomogeneous linewidths of 9.5(2) GHz, optical excited
state lifetimes of 3.5(1) ms, and spectral diffusion-limited homogenoeus
linewidths as narrow as 4.8(3) MHz in the as-grown material. We test annealing
of the Er:CeO$_2$ films up to 900 deg C, which yields modest narrowing of the
inhomogeneous linewidth by 20% and extension of the excited state lifetime by
40%. We have also studied the variation of the optical properties as a function
of Er doping and find that the results are consistent with the trends expected
from inter-dopant charge interactions.
