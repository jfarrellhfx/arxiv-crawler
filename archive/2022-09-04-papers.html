<br>
We study non-homogeneous quantum quenches in a one-dimensional gas of
repulsive spin-$1/2$ fermions, as described by the integrable Yang-Gaudin
model. By means of generalized hydrodynamics (GHD), we analyze in detail the
real-time evolution following a sudden change of the confining potential. We
consider in particular release protocols and trap quenches, including a version
of the quantum Newton's cradle. At zero temperature, we employ a simplified
phase-space hydrodynamic picture to characterize the dynamics of the particle-
and spin-density profiles. Away from zero temperatures, we perform a thorough
numerical study of the GHD equations, and provide quantitative predictions for
different values of the temperature, external magnetic field, and chemical
potential. We highlight the qualitative features arising due to the
multi-component nature of the elementary excitations, discussing in particular
effects of spin-charge separation and dynamical polarization.

<h3>Dark quantum droplets in beyond-mean-field Bose-Einstein condensate  mixtures</h3>

<i>Matthew Edmonds</i>
<br>
Quantum liquid-like states of matter have been realized in an ongoing series
of experiments with ultracold Bose gases. By means of analytical and
theoretical methods we identify the specific criteria for the existence of dark
solitons in beyond-mean-field condensates, revealing how these excitations
exist for both repulsive and attractive interactions, the latter leading to
dark quantum droplets with properties intermediate between a dark soliton and a
quantum droplet. The dark quantum droplet's physical characteristics are
investigated, including calculation of the integrals of motion, revealing their
sensitive dependence on physical parameters relevant to the current generation
of experiments with quantum gases in the beyond-mean-field limit.

<h3>Encounter-based approach to diffusion with resetting</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00947" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00947</a>
<br>
<i>Ziyad Benkhadaj, Denis S. Grebenkov</i>
<br>
An encounter-based approach consists in using the boundary local time as a
proxy for the number of encounters between a diffusing particle and a target to
implement various surface reaction mechanisms on that target. In this paper, we
investigate the effects of stochastic resetting onto diffusion-controlled
reactions in bounded confining domains. We first discuss the effect of position
resetting onto the propagator and related quantities; in this way, we retrieve
a number of earlier results but also provide complementary insights onto them.
Second, we introduce boundary local time resetting and investigate its impact.
Curiously, we find that this type of resetting does not alter the conventional
propagator governing the diffusive dynamics in the presence of a partially
reactive target with a constant reactivity. In turn, the generalized propagator
for other surface reaction mechanisms can be significantly affected. Our
general results are illustrated for diffusion on an interval with reactive
endpoints. Further perspectives and some open problems are discussed.

<h3>Neutral magic-angle bilayer graphene: Condon instability and chiral  resonances</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00958" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00958</a>
<br>
<i>T. Stauber, M. Wackerl, P. Wenk, D. Margetis, J. González, G. Gómez-Santos, J. Schliemann</i>
<br>
We discuss the full optical response of twisted bilayer graphene at the
neutrality point close to the magic angle within the continuum model. (i)
First, we define the full optical response consistent with the underlying $D_3$
symmetry, yielding the total, magnetic, and chiral response that transform
according to the irreducible representations $A_1$, $A_2$, and $E$,
respectively. Then, we numerically calculate the dissipative and reactive
response for twist angles around the magic angle $\theta_m$ and comment on the
possibility of a Condon instability. (ii) Second, we numerically calculate the
full optical response {\it almost at} $\theta_m$. The total response is
characterized by three universal plateaus which can be obtained from an
analytical calculation. The magnetic and the chiral response, however, is given
by corresponding non-universal plateaus depending on the twist angle $\theta$
via the dimensionless parameter $\alpha\sim\theta_m-\theta$. (iii) Following
the discussion on the large magnetic response, we calculate the plasmonic
excitations at the neutrality point inside the optical gap of relaxed twisted
bilayer graphene. We find that acoustic plasmons extend over almost the whole
optical gap and carry the largest oscillator strength. (iv) Finally, we discuss
symmetry relations for the response functions as function of the chemical
potential and highlight the consequences of the approximate particle-hole
symmetry of the continuum model for twisted bilayer graphene. We then discuss a
detailed balance relation where the chiral response at charge neutrality can be
understood in terms of electron (hole) transitions for which the initial
(final) states are energetically closer to charge neutrality than the final
(initial) states.

<h3>Finite temperature tensor network study of the Hubbard model on an  infinite square lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00985" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00985</a>
<br>
<i>Aritra Sinha, Marek M. Rams, Piotr Czarnik, Jacek Dziarmaga</i>
<br>
The Hubbard model is a long-standing problem in the theory of strongly
correlated electrons and a very active one in the experiments with ultracold
fermionic atoms. Motivated by current and prospective quantum simulations, we
apply a two-dimensional tensor network, an infinite projected entangled pair
state, evolved in imaginary time by the neighborhood tensor update algorithm
working directly in the thermodynamic limit. With U(1)xU(1) symmetry and the
bond dimensions up to 29, we generate thermal states down to the temperature of
0.17 times the hopping rate. We obtain results for spin and charge correlators,
unaffected by boundary effects. The spin correlators, measurable in prospective
ultracold atoms experiments attempting to approach the thermodynamic limit,
provides evidence of disruption of antiferromagnetic background with mobile
holes in a slightly doped Hubbard model. The charge correlators reveal the
presence of hole-doublon pairs near half-filling and signatures of hole-hole
repulsion on doping. We also obtain specific heat in the slightly doped regime.

<h3>String-like Theory of Quantum Hall Interfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01001" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01001</a>
<br>
<i>Oguz Turker, Kun Yang</i>
<br>
We derive the effective theories for quantum hall droplets with attractive
interaction among the constituent particles. In the absence of confining
potentials such droplets are defined by their freely moving interfaces (or
boundaries) with the vacuum. We demonstrate the effective theories take forms
similar to string theories. Generalization to interfaces between different
quantum Hall liquids is discussed.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Anomalous collective dynamics of auto-chemotactic populations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01047" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01047</a>
<br>
<i>Jasper van der Kolk, Florian Rasshofer, Richard Swiderski, Astik Haldar, Abhik Basu, Erwin Frey</i>
<br>
While the role of local interactions in nonequilibrium phase transitions is
well studied, a fundamental understanding of the effects of long-range
interactions is lacking. We study the critical dynamics of reproducing agents
subject to auto-chemotactic interactions and limited resources. A
renormalization group analysis reveals distinct scaling regimes for fast
(attractive or repulsive) interactions; for slow signal transduction the
dynamics is dominated by a diffusive fixed point. Further, we present a novel
nonlinear mechanism that stabilizes the continuous transition against the
emergence of a characteristic length scale due to a chemotactic collapse.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Metastability of Constant-Density Flocks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01134" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01134</a>
<br>
<i>Marc Besse, Hugues Chaté, Alexandre Solon</i>
<br>
We study numerically the Toner-Tu field theory where the density field is
maintained constant, a limit case of "Malthusian" flocks for which the
asymptotic scaling of correlation functions in the ordered phase is known
exactly. While we confirm these scaling laws, we also show that such
constant-density flocks are metastable to the nucleation of a specific defect
configuration, and are replaced by a globally disordered phase consisting of
asters surrounded by shock lines that constantly evolves and remodels itself.
We demonstrate that the main source of disorder lies along shock lines,
rendering this active foam fundamentally different from the corresponding
equilibrium system. We thus show that in the context of active matter also, a
result obtained at all orders of perturbation theory can be superseded by
non-perturbative effects, calling for a different approach.

<h3>Role of electronic thermal transport in amorphous metal  recrystallization: a molecular dynamics study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01203" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01203</a>
<br>
<i>Zachary D. McClure, Samuel Temple Reeve, Alejandro Strachan</i>
<br>
Recrystallization of glasses is important in a wide range of applications
including electronics and reactive materials. Molecular dynamics (MD) has been
used to provide an atomic picture of this process, but prior work has neglected
the thermal transport role of electrons, the dominant thermal carrier in
metallic systems. We characterize the role of electronic thermal conductivity
on the velocity of recrystallization in Ni using MD coupled to a continuum
description of electronic thermal transport via a two-temperature model. Our
simulations show that for strong enough coupling between electrons and ions,
the increased thermal conductivity removes the heat from the exothermic
recrystallization process more efficiently, leading to a lower effective
temperature at the recrystallization front and, consequently, lower propagation
velocity. We characterize how electron-phonon coupling strength and system size
affects front propagation velocity. Interestingly, we find that initial
recrystallization velocity increases with decreasing in system size due to
higher overall temperatures. Overall, we show that a more accurate description
of thermal transport due to the incorporation of electrons results in better
agreement with experiments.

<h3>Stable solid molecular hydrogen above 900K from a machine-learned  potential trained with diffusion Quantum Monte Carlo</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00658" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00658</a>
<br>
<i>Hongwei Niu, Yubo Yang, Scott Jensen, Markus Holzmann, Carlo Pierleoni, David M. Ceperley</i>
<br>
We survey the phase diagram of high-pressure molecular hydrogen with path
integral molecular dynamics using a machine-learned interatomic potential
trained with Quantum Monte Carlo forces and energies. Besides the HCP and
C2/c-24 phases, we find two new stable phases both with molecular centers in
the Fmmm-4 structure, separated by a molecular orientation transition with
temperature. The high temperature isotropic Fmmm-4 phase has a reentrant
melting line with a maximum at higher temperature (1450K at 150GPa) than
previously estimated and crosses the liquid-liquid transition line around 1200K
and 200GPa.

<h3>Numerical interchain mean-field theory for the specific heat of the  bimetallic ferromagnetically coupled chain compound MnNi(NO$_2$)$_4$(en)$_2$  (en = ethylenediamine)</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00660" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00660</a>
<br>
<i>Andreas Honecker, Wolfram Brenig, Maheshwor Tiwari, Ralf Feyerherm, Matthias Bleckmann, Stefan Süllow</i>
<br>
We present a detailed study of the field-dependent specific heat of the
bimetallic ferromagnetically coupled chain compound MnNi(NO$_2$)$_4$(en)$_2$,
en = ethylenediamine. For this material, which in zero field orders
antiferromagnetically below $T_N=2.45$ K, small fields suppress magnetic order.
Instead, in such fields a double-peak like structure in the temperature
dependence of the specific heat is observed. We attribute this behavior to the
existence of an acoustic and an optical mode in the spin wave dispersion as
result of the existence of two different spins per unit cell. We compare our
experimental data to numerical results for the specific heat obtained by exact
diagonalization and Quantum-Monte-Carlo simulations for the alternating spin
chain model, using parameters that have been derived from the high-temperature
behavior of the magnetic susceptibility. The interchain coupling is included in
the numerical treatment at the mean-field level. We observe remarkable
agreement between experiment and theory, including the ordering transition,
using previously determined parameters. Furthermore, the observed strong effect
of an applied magnetic field on the ordered state of MnNi(NO$_2$)$_4$(en)$_2$
promises interesting magnetocaloric properties.

<h3>Restoring ergodicity in a strongly disordered interacting chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00661" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00661</a>
<br>
<i>B. Krajewski, L. Vidmar, J. Bonca, M. Mierzejewski</i>
<br>
We consider a chain of interacting fermions with random disorder that was
intensively studied in the context of many-body localization. We show that only
a small fraction of the two-body interaction represents a true local
perturbation to the Anderson insulator. While this true perturbation is nonzero
at any finite disorder strength W, it decreases with increasing W. This
establishes a view that the strongly disordered system should be viewed as a
weakly perturbed integrable model, i.e., a weakly perturbed Anderson insulator.
As a consequence, the latter can hardly be distinguished from a strictly
integrable system in finite-size calculations at large W. We then introduce a
rescaled model in which the true perturbation is of the same order of magnitude
as the other terms of the Hamiltonian, and show that the system remains ergodic
at arbitrary large disorder.

<h3>Triangular lattice Hubbard model physics at intermediate temperatures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00664" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00664</a>
<br>
<i>Kyungmin Lee, Prakash Sharma, Oskar Vafek, Hitesh J. Changlani</i>
<br>
Moire systems offer an exciting playground to study many-body effects of
strongly correlated electrons in regimes that are not easily accessible in
conventional material settings. Motivated by a recent experiment on
$\text{WSe}_2/\text{WS}_2$ moire bilayers [Y. Tang et al., Nature 579, 353-358
(2020)], which realizes a triangular superlattice with a small hopping (of
approximately 10 Kelvin), with tunable density of holes, we explore the Hubbard
model on the triangular lattice for intermediate temperatures $t < T < U$.
Employing finite temperature Lanczos calculations, and closely following the
fitting protocols used in the experiment, we recover the observed trends in the
reported Curie-Weiss temperature $\Theta$ with filling, using the reported
interaction strength $U/t=20$. We focus on the large increase of $|\Theta|$ on
decreasing the density below half filling and the sign change of $\Theta$ at
higher fillings, which signals the onset of ferromagnetism. The increase in
$|\Theta|$ is also seen in the $t$-$J$ model (the low energy limit of the
Hubbard model) in the intermediate temperature range. However, its high
temperature limit yields an opposite trend with density, whose origin we
explain. Our numerical calculations also capture the crossover between short
range antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic order in the intermediate temperature
regime, a result broadly consistent with the experimental findings. We find
that this behavior is a finite-temperature remnant of the underlying zero
temperature phase transition, which we explore with ground state density matrix
renormalization group calculations. We provide evidence of ferromagnetism
characterized by weak (but robust) correlations that explain the small $\Theta$
seen in the experiment.

<h3>Nonlinear sigma model description of deconfined quantum criticality in  arbitrary dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00670" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00670</a>
<br>
<i>Da-Chuan Lu</i>
<br>
In this paper, we propose using the nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) with the
Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) term as a general description of deconfined quantum
critical points that separate two spontaneously symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases
in arbitrary dimensions. In particular, we discuss the suitable choice of the
target space of the NLSM, which is in general the homogeneous space $G/K$,
where $G$ is the UV symmetry and $K$ is generated by
$\mathfrak{k}=\mathfrak{h}_1\cap \mathfrak{h}_2$, and $\mathfrak{h}_i$ is the
Lie algebra of the unbroken symmetry in each SSB phase. With this specific
target space, the symmetry defects in both SSB phases are on equal footing, and
their intertwinement is captured by the WZW term. The DQCP transition is then
tuned by proliferating the symmetry defects. By coupling the $G/K$ NLSM with
the WZW term to the background gauge field, the 't Hooft anomaly of this theory
can be determined. The bulk symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase that
cancels the anomaly is described by the relative Chern-Simons term. We
construct and discuss a series of models with Grassmannian symmetry defects in
3+1d. We also provide the fermionic model that reproduces the $G/K$ NLSM with
the WZW term.

How much structural information is needed to distinguish living from
non-living systems? Here, we show that the statistical properties of Delaunay
tessellations suffice to differentiate prokaryotic and eukaroytic cell packings
from a wide variety of inanimate physical structures. By introducing a
mathematical framework for measuring topological distances between general 3D
point clouds, we construct a universal topological atlas encompassing bacterial
biofilms, zebrafish brain matter and embryonic tissues as well as colloidal
packings, glassy materials, and stellar configurations. Living systems are
found to localize within a bounded island-like region, reflecting that growth
memory essentially distinguishes multicellular from physical packings. By
detecting subtle topological differences, the underlying metric framework
enables a unifying classification of 3D disordered media, from microbial
populations, organoids and tissues to amorphous materials and astrophysical
systems.

We study the nonlinear response of non-integrable 1D spin models using
infinite matrix-product state techniques. As a benchmark and demonstration of
the method, we first calculate the 2D coherent spectroscopy for the exactly
soluble ferromagnetic transverse field Ising model, where excitations are
freely moving domain-walls. We then investigate the distinct signatures of
confined bound states by introducing a longitudinal field and observe the
emergence of strong non-rephasing like signals. To interpret the observed
phenomena, we use a two-kink approximation to perturbatively compute the 2D
spectra. We find good agreement in comparison with the exact results of the
infinite matrix-product state method in the strongly confined regime. We
discuss the relevance of our results for quasi$-$1D Ising spin chain materials
such as $\mathrm{CoNb}_2\mathrm{O}_6$.

Electrons of orbitals near to nuclei of heavy atoms acquire speeds comparable
to the speed of light in vacuum. Therefore, to study the properties of crystals
containing heavy atoms, it is necessary to take into account the relativistic
effects. In this work, using the first-principles DFT+U method, we have
calculated the electronic structure and geometric properties of uranium dioxide
UO2 within full-relativistic, scalar-relativistic, and non-relativistic
formulations, and compared the results. It is shown that: (i) the
non-relativistic scheme gives results far form experimental values; (ii)
including the spin-orbit effects increases the Kohn-Sham band-gap by $6.2\%$
compared to the scalar-relativistic. On the other hand, in full-relativistic
case, the lattice constant decreases by $0.05\%$ compared to
scalar-relativistic one and much better agreement with experiment.

Spectral probes, such as neutron scattering, are crucial for characterizing
excitations in quantum many-body systems and the properties of quantum
materials. Among the most elusive phases of matter are quantum spin liquids,
which have no long-range order even at zero temperature and host exotic
fractionalized excitations with non-trivial statistics. These phases can occur
in frustrated quantum magnets, such as the paradigmatic Heisenberg model with
nearest and next-nearest neighbor exchange interactions on the triangular
lattice, the so-called $J_1-J_2$ model. In this work, we compute the spectral
function using large scale matrix product state simulations across the three
different phases of this model's phase diagram, including a quantum spin liquid
phase at intermediate $J_2/J_1$. Despite a plethora of theoretical and
experimental studies, the exact nature of this phase is still contested, with
the dominant candidates being a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_2$, a gapless $U(1)$ Dirac,
and a spinon Fermi surface quantum spin liquid state. We find a V-shaped
spectrum near the center of the Brillouin zone ($\Gamma$ point), a key
signature of a spinon Fermi surface, observed in prior neutron scattering
experiments. However, we find a small gap near the $\Gamma$ point, ruling out
such a phase. Furthermore, we find localized gapless excitations at the corner
of the Brillouin zone boundary (K point) and the middle of the edge of the
Brillouin zone boundary (M point), ruling out the gapped $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin
liquid phase. Our results imply that the intermediate spin liquid phase is a
gapless $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid, and provide clear signatures to detect this
phase in future neutron scattering experiments.

<br>
The separation of substances into different phases is ubiquitous in nature
and important scientifically and technologically. This phenomenon may become
drastically different if the species involved, whether molecules or
supramolecular assemblies, interconvert. In the presence of an external force
large enough to overcome energetic differences between the interconvertible
species (forced interconversion), the two alternative species will be present
in equal amounts, and the striking phenomenon of steady-state, restricted phase
separation into mesoscales is observed. Such microphase separation is one of
the simplest examples of dissipative structures in condensed matter. In this
work, we investigate the formation of such mesoscale steady-state structures
through Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics simulations of three physically
distinct microscopic models of binary mixtures that exhibit both equilibrium
(natural) interconversion and a nonequilibrium source of forced
interconversion. We show that this source can be introduced through an internal
imbalance of intermolecular forces or an external flux of energy that promotes
molecular interconversion, possible manifestations of which could include the
internal nonequilibrium environment of living cells or a flux of photons. The
main trends and observations from the simulations are well captured by a
non-equilibrium thermodynamic theory of phase transitions affected by
interconversion. We show how a nonequilibrium bicontinuous microemulsion or a
spatially modulated state may be generated depending on the interplay between
diffusion, natural interconversion, and forced interconversion.

This invited talk will review a series of our recent studies on high-entropy
ceramics (HECs) and compositionally complex ceramics (CCCs) and discuss the
future perspective. Various single-phase equimolar quinary (five-component)
HECs, e.g., MB2, MB, M3B4, MB4, and MB6 borides, MSi2 and M3Si5 silicides,
perovskite, fluorite, and pyrochlore oxides, and (intermetallic) aluminides
have been fabricated. We further proposed to extend HECs to CCCs to include
non-equimolar compositions and further consider short- and long-range orders,
which reduce configurational entropies but offer additional dimensions and
opportunities to tailor and improve various properties. We also reported the
first dual-phase HECs/CCCs. Using compositionally complex fluorite-based oxides
(CCFBOs, which can possess fluorite or defect fluorite, pyrochlore, weberite,
fergusonite, and bixbyite phases) as the model systems, we have recently
discovered long- and short- range orders, composition- and redox-induced
order-disorder transitions (ODTs), and ultrahigh-entropy weberite and
fergusonite phases in several 10- to 21-component systems.

<h3>Computing Grain Boundary 'Phase' Diagrams</h3>

Grain boundaries (GBs) can be treated as two-dimensional (2-D) interfacial
phases (also called 'complexions') that can undergo interfacial phase-like
transitions. As bulk phase diagrams and calculation of phase diagram (CALPHAD)
methods are a foundation for modern materials science, we propose to extend
them to GBs to have equally significant impacts. This perspective article
reviews a series of studies to compute the GB counterparts to bulk phase
diagrams. First, a phenomenological interfacial thermodynamic model was
developed to construct GB lambda diagrams to forecast high-temperature GB
disordering and related trends in sintering and other properties for both
metallic and ceramic materials. In parallel, an Ising-type lattice statistical
thermodynamic model was utilized to construct GB adsorption diagrams, which
predicted first-order GB adsorption (a.k.a. segregation) transitions and
critical phenomena. These two simplified thermodynamic models emphasize on the
GB structural (disordering) and chemical (adsorption) aspects, respectively.
Subsequently, hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics atomistic simulations
were used to compute more rigorous and accurate GB 'phase' diagrams. Computed
GB diagrams of thermodynamic and structural properties were further extended to
include mechanical properties. Moreover, machine learning was combined with
atomistic simulations to predict GB properties as functions of four independent
compositional variables and temperature in a 5-D space for a given GB in
high-entropy alloys or as functions of five GB macroscopic (crystallographic)
degrees of freedom (DOFs) plus temperature and composition for a binary alloy
in a 7-D space. Relevant other studies are examined. Future perspective and
outlook, including two emerging fields of high-entropy grain boundaries (HEGBs)
and electrically (or electrochemically) induced GB transitions, are discussed.

Do high-entropy alloys and ceramics have their grain boundary (GB)
counterparts? As the concept of high-entropy grain boundaries (HEGBs) was
initially proposed in 2016, this article provides the first complete and
rigorous discussion of the underlying interfacial thermodynamics. A simplified
segregation model can illustrate both GB and bulk high-entropy effects, which
reduce GB energy with increasing temperature for saturated multicomponent
(conventional and high-entropy) alloys. HEGBs can be utilized to stabilize
nanocrystalline alloys at high temperatures via thermodynamic and kinetic
effects. GB structural disordering and transitions offer further opportunities
to attain higher effective GB entropies. Future perspective is discussed.

<br>
The quantum many body states in the BCS-BEC crossover regime are of
long-lasting interest. Here we report direct spectroscopic evidence of BCS-BEC
crossover in real-space in a FeSe monolayer thin film by using spatially
resolved scanning tunneling spectra. The crossover is driven by the shift of
band structure relative to the Fermi level. The theoretical calculation based
on a two-band model qualitatively reproduces the measured spectra in the whole
crossover range. In addition, the Zeeman splitting of the quasi-particle states
is found to be consistent with the characteristics of a condensate. Our work
paves the way to study the exotic states of BCS-BEC crossover in a
two-dimensional crystalline material at the atomic scale.

We study characteristic electronic structures in the extended martini lattice
model and propose its materialization in $\pi$-electron networks constructed by
designated chemisorption on graphene and silicene. By investigating the minimal
tight-binding model, we reveal rich electronic structures tuned by the ratio of
hopping parameters, ranging from the band insulator to the unconventional
gapless semiconductor. Remarkably, the unconventional gapless semiconductor is
characterized by the flat band at the Fermi level. Further, the density
functional theory calculations for candidate materials reveal that the
characteristic electronic structures can be realized by the designated
chemisorption or the chemical substitution on graphene and silicene, and that
the electronic structure near the Fermi level is tunable by the choice of the
atomic species of adsorbed atoms. Our results open the way to search exotic
electronic structures and their functionalities induced by the extended martini
lattice.

<h3>Linear-in-Frequency Optical Conductivity over a broad range in the  three-dimensional Dirac semimetal candidate Ir$_2$In$_8$Se</h3>

<br>
The optical conductivity of the new Dirac semimetal candidate Ir$_2$In$_8$Se
is measured in a frequency range from 40 to 30000 cm$^{-1}$ at temperatures
from 300 K down to 10 K. The measurement reveals that the compound is a low
carrier density metal. We find that the real part of the conductivity
$\sigma_1(\omega)$ is linear in frequency over a broad range from 500 to 4000
cm$^{-1}$ at 300 K and varies slightly with cooling. This linearity strongly
suggests the presence of three-dimensional linear electronic bands with band
crossings near the Fermi level. Band structure calculations indicate the
presence of type-II Dirac points. By comparing our data with the optical
conductivity computed from the band structure, we conclude that the observed
linear dependence mainly originates from the Dirac cones and the transition
between the Dirac cones and the next lower bands. In addition, a weak energy
gap feature is resolved below the charge density wave phase transition
temperature in reflectivity spectra. An enhanced structure arising from the
imperfect Fermi surface nesting is identified in the electronic susceptibility
function, suggesting a Fermi surface nesting driven instability.

<i>Mahajabin Rahman, Stefan Boettcher</i>
<br>
We offer an alternative real-space description based purely on activated
processes for the understanding of relaxation dynamics in hierarchical
landscapes. To this end, we use the cluster model, a coarse-grained lattice
model of a jammed system, to analyze rejuvenation and memory effects during
aging after a hard quench. In this model, neighboring particles on a lattice
aggregate through local interactions into clusters that fragment with a
probability based on their size. Despite the simplicity of the cluster model,
it has been shown to reproduce salient observables of the aging dynamics in
colloidal systems, such as those accounting for particle mobility and
displacements. Here, we probe the model for more complex quench protocols and
show that it exhibits the same rejuvenation and memory effects attributed to
the complex hierarchical structure of a glassy energy landscape. Beyond
studying rejuvenation and memory effects, we also demonstrate that this model
can be used for predictive purposes on the end of memory.

TBPLaS is an open-source software package for the accurate simulation of
physical systems with arbitrary geometry and dimensionality utilizing the
tight-binding (TB) theory. It has an intuitive object-oriented Python
application interface (API) and Cython/Fortran extensions for the performance
critical parts, ensuring both flexibility and efficiency. Under the hood,
numerical calculations are mainly performed by both exact diagonalizatin and
the tight-binding propagation method (TBPM) without diagonalization.
Especially, the TBPM is based on the numerical solution of time-dependent
Schr\"odinger equation, achieving linear scaling with system size in both
memory and CPU costs. Consequently, TBPLaS provides a numerically cheap
approach to calculate the electronic, transport and optical properties of large
tight-binding models with billions of atomic orbitals. Current capabilities of
TBPLaS include the calculation of band structure, density of states, local
density of states, quasi-eigenstates, optical conductivity, electrical
conductivity, Hall conductivity, polarization function, dielectric function,
plasmon dispersion, carrier mobility and velocity, localization length and free
path, Z2 topological invariant, wave-packet propagation, etc. All the
properties can be obtained with only a few lines of code. Other algorithms
involving tight-binding Hamiltonians can be implemented easily thanks to its
extensible and modular nature. In this paper, we discuss the theoretical
framework, implementation details and common workflow of TBPLaS, and give a few
demonstrations of its applications.

<h3>Critical field measure for topological superconductivity</h3>

<br>
A promising direction for harnessing the laws of quantum mechanics to perform
quantum computation is the topological quantum computation, for which
topological superconductivity is one of the physical platforms. Intensive
theoretical studies have been carried out and followed by tremendous
experimental efforts in the realization of topological superconductivity,
though debates remain mainly because of the inadequacy of the convincing
detection techniques. Here we report a theoretical finding in a superconductor
with surface or edge states, where the critical field is found to obey the
unique power-law temperature dependence $B_{c3}\sim (T_c-T)^{\gamma}$ with
$T_c$ being the onset critical temperature of superconductivity and the
fractional exponent $\gamma= 2/3$, differing from the conventional values of
$\gamma=1/2$ and $1$. The topological surface superconductivity is hence
expected in the three-dimensional (3D) system and the topological edge
superconductivity in the two-dimensional (2D) system. The application of this
measure to the intrinsic topological superconductors FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_{x}$
($x\sim 0.5$) supports the validity of such an accessible, convenient, and
reliable transport technique for the identification of topological
superconductivity. The new form of theory on topological superconductivity
together with the developed identification technique is expected to guide the
search of topological superconductors in future.

<br>
We have synthesized YbPdAs with the hexagonal ZrNiAl-type structure, in which
the Yb-atoms form a distorted kagome sublattice in the hexagonal basal plane.
Magnetic, transport, and thermodynamic measurements indicate that YbPdAs is a
low-carrier Kondo lattice compound with an antiferromagnetic transition at
$T_\mathrm{N}$ = 6.6 K, which is slightly suppressed in applied magnetic fields
up to 9 T. The magnetic entropy at $T_\mathrm{N}$ recovers only 33\% of
$R\ln{2}$, the full entropy of the ground state doublet of the Yb-ions. The
resistivity displays a $-\ln T$ dependence between 30 and 15 K, followed by a
broad maximum at $T\rm_{coh}$ = 12 K upon cooling. Below $T\rm_{coh}$, the
magnetoresistance changes from negative to positive, suggesting a crossover
from single-ion Kondo scattering processes at intermediate temperatures to
coherent Kondo lattice behaviors at low temperatures. Both the Hall resistivity
measurements and band structure calculations indicate a relatively low carrier
concentration in YbPdAs. Our results suggest that YbPdAs could provide an
opportunity for examining the interplay of Kondo physics and magnetic
frustration in low carrier systems.

<br>
Topological superconductivity (TSC) is a highly sought-after superconducting
state hosting topological order and Majorana excitations. In this work, we
explore the mechanism to the TSC in the doped Mott insulators with
time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Through large-scale density matrix
renormalization group study of an extended triangular-lattice $t$-$J$ model on
the $6$- and $8$-leg cylinders, we identify a $d+id$-wave chiral TSC phase with
spontaneous TRS breaking, which is characterized by a Chern number $C=2$ and
quasi-long-range superconducting order. We map out the quantum phase diagram
with tuning the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) electron hopping and spin
interaction. In the weaker NNN-coupling regime, a charge stripe phase
coexisting with strong spin fluctuations and fluctuating superconductivity is
revealed. The TSC emerges in the intermediate-coupling regime, which has a
transition to a $d$-wave superconducting phase at larger NNN couplings. The
emergence of the TSC is driven by geometrical frustrations and hole dynamics,
which suppress spin correlation and charge order, leading to a topological
quantum phase transition.

Recent theoretical studies have suggested that Kitaev physics and such
effects as formation of a mysterious spin-liquid state can be expected not only
in RuCl3 and iridates, but also in conventional $3d$ transition metal
compounds. Using DC and AC magnetometry, thermodynamic and $^{23}$Na nuclear
magnetic resonance measurements (NMR) we studied such a candidate material
Na3Co2SbO6 . A full phase diagram of Na3Co2SbO6 in a wide range of magnetic
fields and temperatures is presented. The results demonstrate transformation of
the magnetic structure realized at low-temperature and suppression of the AFM
order under the external field, the gradual development of the saturation
phase, as well as evidence of gapped spin-liquid-like behavior in certain parts
of the phase diagram.

We simulated the radiative response of the cavity quantum electrodynamics
(QED) coupled to the double quantum dot Cooper pair splitter and analyzed its
spectral dependence to get insight into dynamics of the Cooper pair transfers.
The model is confined to the energy subspace where two entangled electrons are
transferred to two normal electrodes through the inter-dot singlet state on two
proximitized quantum dots. Our research is focused on the Andreev scatterings
in the subgap regime, for which the local charge susceptibility $\Pi(\omega_p)$
is derived, by means of Keldysh Green functions, in a whole bias voltage range.
In particular, in the large voltage limit the spectrum of $\Pi(\omega_p)$ is
expressed by a simple analytical formula, which shows various dissipation
processes related with photon-induced transitions between the Andreev bound
states.

Polymer networks and biological tissues are often swollen by a solvent, such
that their properties emerge from a coupling between swelling and elastic
stress. This poroelastic coupling becomes particularly intricate in wetting,
adhesion, and creasing, for which sharp folds appear that can even lead to
phase separation. Here we resolve the singular nature of poroelastic surface
folds and determine the solvent distribution in the vicinity of the fold-tip.
Surprisingly, two opposite scenarios emerge depending on the angle of the fold.
In obtuse folds such as creases, it is found that the solvent is completely
expelled near the crease-tip, according to a nontrivial spatial distribution.
For wetting ridges with acute fold angles, the solvent migration is reversed as
compared to creasing, and the degree of swelling is maximal at the fold-tip. We
discuss how our poroelastic fold-analysis offers an explanation for phase
separation, fracture and contact angle hysteresis.

Nanostructures, such a quantum dots or nanoparticles, made of
three-dimensional topological insulators (3DTIs) have been recently attracting
increasing interest, especially for their optical properties. In this paper we
calculate the energy spectrum, the surface states and the dipole matrix
elements for optical transitions with in-plane polarization of 3DTI
nanocylinders of finite height L and radius R. We first derive an effective 2D
Hamiltonian by exploiting the cylindrical symmetry of the problem. We develop
two approaches: the first one is an exact numerical tight-binding model
obtained by discretising the Hamiltonian. The second one, which allows us to
obtain analytical results, is an approximated model based on a large-R
expansion and on an effective boundary condition to account for the finite
height of the nanocylinder. We find that the agreement between the two models,
as far as eigenenergies and eigenfunctions are concerned, is excellent for the
lowest absolute value of the longitudinal component of the angular momentum.
Finally, we derive analytical expressions for the dipole matrix elements by
first considering the lateral surface alone and the bases alone, and then for
the whole nanocylinder. In particular, we focus on the two limiting cases of
tall and squat nanocylinders. The latter case is compared with the numerical
results finding a good agreement.

Hydrogels which are hydrophilic and porous materials have recently emerged as
promising systems for filtration applications. In our study, we prepare
hydrogel membranes by the photopolymerization of a mixture of poly (ethylene
glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) and large poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains of 300
000 g.mol-1 in the presence of a photoinitiator. We find that this addition of
free PEG chains induces a large and non-linear increase of the water
permeability. Indeed, by changing the content of PEG chains added, we obtain
variations of the hydrogel water permeability over two orders of magnitude. The
highest water permeability values are obtained for the membranes when the PEG
concentration is equal to its critical overlap concentration C*. Moreover, we
find that the flow rate of water through the membranes varies non-linearly with
the pressure. We relate this result to the deformability of the membranes as
the applied pressure leads to a compression of the pores. This study provides
new perspectives for the design of flexible hydrogel membranes with controlled
permeability and their application in water treatment and bioseparation.

Subgap states are responsible for the low-bias transport features of hybrid
superconducting--semiconducting devices. Here, we analyze the local and
nonlocal differential conductance of Coulomb-blockaded multiterminal
superconducting islands that host subgap states with different spatial
structures. The emerging patterns of their transport spectroscopy are used to
characterize the possible topological nature of these devices and offer the
possibility of controlling their transport properties. We develop a
next-to-leading order master equation to describe the multiterminal transport
in superconductors with both strong Coulomb interactions and multiple subgap
states, coupled with metallic leads. We show that the nonlocal differential
conductance characterizes the spatial extension of the subgap states and
signals the presence of degenerate bound states with a finite support on
different parts of the device. Additionally, it displays sharp sign changes as
a function of the induced charge of the superconductor, signaling energy
crossings among its lowest excited states.

Coherent links between qubits separated by tens of micrometers are expected
to facilitate scalable quantum computing architectures for spin qubits in
electrically-defined quantum dots. These links create space for classical
on-chip control electronics between qubit arrays, which can help to alleviate
the so-called wiring bottleneck. A promising method of achieving coherent links
between distant spin qubits consists of shuttling the spin through an array of
quantum dots. Here, we use a linear array of four tunnel-coupled quantum dots
in a 28Si/SiGe heterostructure to create a short quantum link. We move an
electron spin through the quantum dot array by adjusting the electrochemical
potential for each quantum dot sequentially. By pulsing the gates repeatedly,
we shuttle an electron forward and backward through the array up to 250 times,
which corresponds to a total distance of approximately 80 {\mu}m. We make an
estimate of the spin-flip probability per hop in these experiments and conclude
that this is well below 0.01% per hop.

<h3>Impact of rheology on the acousto-elastic effect revealed by guided  waves in a highly-stretched plate</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00926" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00926</a>

<br>
We study the propagation of guided elastic waves in a plate made of Ecoflex,
a nearly-incompressible elastomer. The in-plane displacement field in a soft
plate is extracted. We measure the phase velocities of two in-plane modes
$S\!H_0$ and $S_0$ (first symmetrical Lamb mode) coexisting in the low
frequency limit. While $S\!H_0$ propagates at the transverse velocity, $S_0$
propagates at the plate velocity. The plate is then subjected to a
nearly-uniaxial stress with an elongation reaching 120%. An induced anisotropy
is first observed and then characterized by following the phase velocities of
both modes in two principal directions. Although these measurements provide an
estimate of the initial stress, they are not correctly predicted by the
acousto-elastic theory. We thus show that the acousto-elastic theory alone is
not sufficient to explain the evolution of velocities in a prestressed
elastomer. The origin of this discrepancy is actually explained by the
rheological properties of the elastomer, namely the frequency-dependent shear
modulus. The implementation a fractional rheological model in the
acousto-elastic theory enables a proper prediction for these velocities up to
80% elongation.

<br>
We study the dynamics of a tracer in a dense mixture of particles connected
to different thermostats. Starting from the overdamped Langevin equations that
describe the evolution of the system, we derive the expression of the
self-diffusion coefficient of a tagged particle in the suspension, in the limit
of soft interactions between the particles. Our derivation, which relies on the
linearization of the Dean-Kawasaki equations obeyed by the density fields and
on a path-integral representation of the dynamics of the tracer, extends
previous derivations that held for tracers in contact with a single bath. Our
analytical result is confronted to results from Brownian dynamics simulations.
The agreement with numerical simulations is very good even for high densities.
We show how the diffusivity of tracers can be affected by the activity of a
dense environment of soft particles that may represent polymer coils -- a
result that could be of relevance in the interpretation of measurements of
diffusivity in biological media. Finally, our analytical result is general and
can be applied to the diffusion of tracers coupled to different types of
fluctuating environments, provided that their evolution equations are linear
and that the coupling between the tracer and the bath is weak.

By introducing electron screening in the extended Koopmans' theorem we
correctly describe the band gap opening in weakly as well as strongly
correlated systems. We show this by applying our method to bulk LiH, Si, and
paramagnetic as well as antiferromagnetic NiO. Although incorrect features
remain in the full photoemission spectra, this is a remarkable result for an
ab-initio electronic structure method and it opens the way to a unified
description of photoemission spectra at weak and strong correlation.

The use of a thermodynamic framework in the study of learning systems has a
long tradition. Recently, new tools relating perfect thermodynamic adaptation
to the adaptation process have been developed. These results, known as
fluctuation theorems, have been tested experimentally in several physical
scenarios and, moreover, they have been shown to be true under broad
mathematical conditions. Hence, although not experimentally challenged yet,
they are presumed to apply to learning systems as well. We address this issue
here by testing the applicability of fluctuation theorems in learning systems,
more specifically, in human sensorimotor learning.

A gas of interacting fermions confined in a quasi one-dimensional geometry
shows a BEC to BCS crossover upon slowly driving its coupling constant through
a confinement-induced resonance. On one side of the crossover the fermions form
tightly-bound bosonic molecules behaving as a repulsive Bose gas, while on the
other they form Cooper pairs, whose size is much larger than the average
inter-particle distance. Here we consider the situation arising when the
coupling constant is varied suddenly from the BEC to the BCS value. Namely, we
study a BEC-to-BCS quench. By exploiting a suitable continuum limit of recently
discovered solvable quenches in the Hubbard model, we show that the local
stationary state reached at large times after the quench can be determined
exactly by means of the Quench Action approach. We provide an
experimentally-accessible characterisation of the stationary state by computing
local pair correlation function as well as the quasi-particle distribution
functions. We find that the steady state is increasingly dominated by two
particle spin singlet bound states for stronger interaction strength but that
bound state formation is inhibited at larger BEC density. The bound state
rapidity distribution displays quartic power law decay suggesting a violation
of Tan's contact relations.

<h3>Triple-$\mathcal{Q}$ partial magnetic orders induced by quadrupolar  interactions: Triforce order scenario for UNi$_4$B</h3>

<br>
We theoretically investigate possible symmetry broken states in ${\rm
UNi_4B}$, constructing a localized pseudo triplet crystalline-electric field
model. For a long time, the low-temperature symmetry broken phase in ${\rm
UNi_4B}$ has been considered to be a magnetic toroidal order forming
atomic-scale vortices lattice with disordered sites at each center of the
vortices. However, recent observation of current-induced magnetizations offers
a reinvestigation about the validity of this order parameter because of the
contradiction in their anisotropy. Our model takes into account the quadrupole
degrees of freedom, whose importance is recently evidenced by the
sound-velocity softening. We find that the quadrupole moments play an important
role in determining the magnetic structure in the ordered states. For a wide
range of parameter space, we obtain two triple-$\mathcal{Q}$ magnetic orders in
our 36-site mean-field analysis: toroidal order and another one with the same
number of disordered sites as in the toroidal order. We name the latter
"triforce" order after its magnetic structure. Importantly, the triforce order
possesses exactly the same spin structure factor as the toroidal order does,
while the phase factors in the superposition of the triple-$\mathcal{Q}$
structure are different. We show that the triforce order is consistent with the
observed current-induced magnetization when the realistic crystal structure of
${\rm UNi_4B}$ is taken into account. We compare the predictions of the
triforce order with the experimental data available at present in detail and
also discuss possible applications of the present mechanism for
triple-$\mathcal{Q}$ orders to anisotropic correlated systems.

In this paper we provide a physical interpretation of It\^o-process resulting
in thermal equilibrium distribution of a Brownian particle experiencing
coordinate dependent diffusion. Since the local quantities like diffusivity
would go through large fluctuations in thermal equilibrium, one needs to take
these fluctuation into account. We identify that the protocol of local
diffusivity measurement is an essential ingredient that effectively modifies
Hamiltonian of the system to result in a physically relevant Gibbs measure
related to the It\^o-distribution.

Laser cooling exploits the physics of light scattering to cool atomic and
molecular gases to close to absolute zero. It is the crucial initial step for
essentially all atomic gas experiments in which Bose-Einstein condensation and,
more generally, quantum degeneracy is reached. The ongoing development of
laser-cooling methods has allowed more elements to be brought to quantum
degeneracy, with each additional atomic species offering its own experimental
opportunities. Improved methods are opening new avenues, for example, reaching
Bose-Einstein condensation purely through laser cooling as well as the
realization of continuous Bose-Einstein condensation. Here we review these
recent innovations in laser cooling and provide an outlook on methods that may
enable new ways of creating quantum gases.

Although challenging, realizing controllable high-temperature entanglement is
of immense importance for practical applications as well as for fundamental
research in quantum technologies. Here, we report the existence of entangled
steady states in bipartite quantum magnonic systems at high temperatures. We
consider dissipative dynamics of two magnons in a bipartite antiferromagnet or
ferrimagnet subjected to a vibrational phonon mode and an external rotating
magnetic field. To quantify the bipartite magnon-magnon entanglement, we use
the entanglement negativity and compute its dependence on the temperature and
magnetic field. We show that, for any given phonon frequency and magnon-phonon
coupling rates, there are always ranges of the magnetic field amplitudes and
frequencies, for which bipartite magnon-magnon entanglement persists up to and
above the room temperature. The generality of the result allows for
experimental observation in a variety of crystals and synthetic bipartite
antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials.

<br>
Over the past decades, magnetic frustration has been under intense debate due
to its unusual properties. For instance, frustration in the kagome lattice
suppresses long range spin correlations and it is expected to be a candidate
for a spin liquid system. Therefore, with the advent of experiments with
ultra-cold atoms, the interest for frustrated geometries has increased. Given
this, in the present work we investigate the repulsive Hubbard model on the
kagome lattice by unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We examine its
thermodynamic properties, as well as the magnetic and transport response of the
system at finite temperatures and different values of the repulsive
interaction. From these results, we discuss the possible occurrence of
adiabatic cooling, a quite important feature in ultra-cold systems, and the
presence of a metal-to-insulator transition at a finite interaction strength.
Our findings may guide future experiments in ultra-cold fermionic atoms on the
kagome lattice.

We provide a quantitative characterization of generic weakly first-order
thermal phase transitions out of planar spin-nematic states in
three-dimensional spin-one quantum magnets, based on calculations using
Poisson-Dirichlet distributions (PD) within a universal loop model formulation,
combined with large-scale quantum Monte Carlo calculations. In contrast to
earlier claims, the thermal melting of the nematic state is not continuous,
instead a weakly first-order transition is identified from both thermal
properties and the distribution of the nematic order parameter. Furthermore,
based on PD calculations, we obtain exact results for the order parameter
distribution and Binder cumulants at the discontinuous melting transition. Our
findings establish the thermal melting of planar spin-nematic states as a
generic platform for quantitative approaches to weakly first-order phase
transitions in quantum systems with a continuous SU(2) internal symmetry.

<br>
We studied the effects of multiband electronic structure on the
thermoelectric and electrical transport properties in the normal state of
kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs). In all three members,
the multiband nature is manifested by sign changes in the temperature
dependence of the Seebeck and Hall resistivity, together with sublinear
response of the isothermal Nernst and Hall effects to external magnetic fields
in the charge ordered state. Moreover, ambipolar transport effects appear
ubiquitously in all three systems, giving rise to sizable Nernst signal.
Finally, possible origins of the sign reversal in the temperature dependence of
the Hall effect are discussed.

<br>
Persistent spin textures (PSTs) in momentum space have the potential to
enable spintronic devices which are currently limited by low spin lifetimes in
nonmagnetic spin-orbit coupled materials. We perform a first-principles study
on the proustite mineral family, Ag$_3$BQ$_3$} (B=As,\,Sb; Q=S,\,Se), and show
these chalcogenides exhibit a non-symmetry protected PST, which we refer to as
symmetry-assisted PSTs. Chemical substitution can be used to tune the PST
quality and properties, e.g., spin lifetime, and we find that a Rashba
anisotropy criterion correlates with the PST area and spin lifetime for two of
the three proustites examined. Last, we show that a first-order effective SOC
Hamiltonian, often used in two-dimensional systems, is insufficient to describe
the PST state in all proustites, suggesting that higher order models are
necessary to fully describe PSTs in bulk three-dimensional materials.

<br>
Brownian particles interacting sequentially with distinct temperatures and
driving forces at each stroke have been tackled as a reliable alternative for
the construction of engine setups. However they can behave very inefficiently
depending on the driving used for the worksource and/or when temperatures of
each stage are very different from each other. Inspired by some models for
molecular motors and recent experimental studies, a coupling between driving
and velocities is introduced as an alternative ingredient for enhancing the
system performance. Here, the role of this new ingredient for levering the
engine performance is detailed investigated from stochastic thermodynamics.
Exact expressions for quantities and distinct maximization routes have been
obtained and investigated. The search of an optimal coupling provides a
substantial increase of engine performance (mainly efficiency), even for large
$\Delta T$. A simple and general argument for the optimal coupling can be
estimated, irrespective the driving and other model details.

<br>
Resilient supply chains are often inherently dependent on the nature of their
complex interconnected networks that are simultaneously multi-dimensional and
multi-layered. This article presents a Supply Chain Network (SCN) model that
can be used to regulate downstream relationships towards a sustainable SME
using a 4-component cost function structure - Environmental (E), Demand (D),
Economic (E), and Social (S). As a major generalization to the existing
practice of using phenomenological interrelationships between the EDES cost
kernels, we propose a complementary time varying model of a cost function,
based on Lagrangian mechanics (incorporating SCN constraints through Lagrange
multipliers), to analyze the time evolution of the SCN variables to interpret
the competition between economic inertia and market potential. Multicriteria
decision making, based on an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), ranks
performance quality, identifying key business decision makers. The model is
first solved numerically and then validated against real data pertaining to two
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) from diverse domains, establishing the
domain-independent nature of the model. The results quantify how increases in a
production line without appropriate consideration of market volatility can lead
to bankruptcy, and how high transportation cost together with increased
production may lead to a break-even state. The model also predicts the time it
takes a policy change to reinvigorate sales, thereby forecasting best practice
operational procedure that ensures holistic sustainability on all four
sustainability fronts.

Ab initio Green-Kubo (aiGK) simulations of heat transport in solids allow for
assessing lattice thermal conductivity in anharmonic or complex materials from
first principles. In this work, we present a detailed account of their
practical application and evaluation with an emphasis on noise reduction and
finite-size corrections in semiconductors and insulators. To account for such
corrections, we propose strategies in which all necessary numerical parameters
are chosen based on the dynamical properties displayed during molecular
dynamics simulations in order to minimize manual intervention. This paves the
way for applying the aiGK method in semi-automated and high-throughput
frameworks. The proposed strategies are presented and demonstrated for
computing the lattice thermal conductivity at room temperature in the mildly
anharmonic periclase MgO, and for the strongly anharmonic marshite CuI.

<br>
Understanding the interplay between various design strategies (for instance,
bonding heterogeneity and lone pair induced anharmonicity) to achieve ultralow
lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_l$) is indispensable for discovering
novel functional materials for thermal energy applications. In the present
study, we investigate layered PbXF (X = Cl, Br, I), which offers bonding
heterogeneity through the layered crystal structure, anharmonicity through the
Pb$^{2+}$ $6s^2$ lone pair, and phonon softening through the mass difference
between F and Pb/X. The weak inter-layer van der Waals bonding and the strong
intra-layer ionic bonding with partial covalent bonding result in a significant
bonding heterogeneity and a poor phonon transport in the out-of-plane
direction. Large average Gr\"uneisen parameters ($\geq$ 2.5) demonstrate strong
anharmonicity. The computed phonon dispersions show flat bands, which suggest
short phonon lifetimes, especially for PbIF. Enhanced Born effective charges
are due to cross-band-gap hybridization. PbIF shows lattice instability at a
small volume expansion of 0.1$\%$. The $\kappa_l$ values obtained by the two
channel transport model are 20-50$\%$ higher than those obtained by solving the
Boltzmann transport equation. Overall, ultralow $\kappa_l$ values are found at
300 K, especially for PbIF. We propose that the interplay of bonding
heterogeneity, lone pair induced anharmonicity, and constituent elements with
high mass difference aids the design of low $\kappa_l$ materials for thermal
energy applications.

<br>
The ultra-long relaxation time of glass transition makes it difficult to
construct atomic models of amorphous materials by conventional methods. We
propose a novel method for building such atomic models using data assimilation
method by simulated annealing with an accurately computed interatomic potential
augmented by penalty from experimental data. The advantage of this method is
that not only can it reproduce experimental data as the structure refinement
methods like reverse Monte Carlo but also obtain the reasonable structure in
terms of interatomic potential energy. In addition, thanks to the interatomic
potential, we do not need high $Q$ range diffraction data, which is necessary
to take into account the short-range order. Persistent homology analysis shows
that the amorphous ice obtained by the new method is indeed more ordered at
intermediate range.

By collecting from literature data the experimental evidences of anomalous
diffusion of passive tracers inside cytoplasm, and in particular of
subdiffusion of mRNA molecules inside live E. coli cells, we get the
probability density function of molecules' displacement and we derive the
corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. Molecules' distribution emerges to be
related to the Kr\"atzel function and its Fokker-Planck equation be a
fractional diffusion equation in the Erd\'elyi-Kober sense. The irreducibility
of the derived Fokker-Planck equation to those of other literature models is
also discussed.

We investigate the quantum-critical behavior between the rung-singlet phase
with hidden string order and the N\'eel phase with broken $SU(2)$-symmetry on
quantum spin ladders with algebraically decaying unfrustrated long-range
Heisenberg interactions. Combining perturbative continuous unitary
transformations (pCUT) with a white-graph expansion and Monte Carlo simulations
yields high-order series expansions of energies and observables in the
thermodynamic limit about the isolated rung-dimer limit. The breakdown of the
rung-singlet phase allows to determine the critical line and the entire set of
critical exponents as a function of the decay exponent of the long-range
interaction. A non-trivial regime of continuously varying critical exponents as
well as long-range mean-field behavior is demonstrated reminiscent of the
long-range transverse-field Ising model.

<h3>Oxygen dissociation on the C3N monolayer:A first-principles study</h3>

<br>
C3N,a novel two-dimensional (2D) atomic-thick nanomaterial with unique
mechanical and electronic properties, has many promising uses in various
technological applications. Despite the structure analogous to graphene, the
oxidation properties of the pristine C3N sheet have not been revealed in detail
to the same extent. In particular, the oxygen dissociation behavior and the
oxidized structure are the inevitably critical issues in the C3N manipulation
and engineering. Here, using the first-principles calculations, we have
systematically investigated the possible adsorption sites for an oxygen
molecule and the atomic oxygen, eight oxygen dissociation pathways and the
associated oxidized structures.It is demonstrated that the pristine C3N
monolayer shows more O2 physisorption sites and exhibits the stronger O2
adsorption than the pristine graphene. Among eight O2 dissociation pathways,
the most preferable pathway is a two-step process involving an intermediate
state with the chemisorbed oxygen molecule where the barrier is lower than that
on the pristine graphene, indicating that the pristine C3N monolayer is more
susceptible to oxidation than the pristine graphene.Furthermore,we found that
the most stable oxidized structure is not produced by the most preferable
dissociation pathway but generated from a direct dissociation process. The
presence of nitrogen atoms introduces the stable dangling C-O or N-O bonds,
leading to the enriched oxidized structures in the pristine C3N sheet after
oxygen dissociation. Our findings deepen the understanding of the chemical
stability of 2D crystalline carbon nitrides under ambient conditions, and also
provide insights into the tailoring of the surface chemical structures via
doping and oxidation.

A very simple method for determining the center (isomer) shift, CS, and the
spectral area, A, of a M\"ossbauer spectrum is outlined. Its applicability is
demonstrated in two examples viz. pyrite and a ternary sigma-phase Fe-Cr-Ni
compound. Sets of the spectra recorded in the temperature interval of 78-295 K
for the former, and 78-295 K for the latter were analyzed with the simple and a
standard method. CS(T)- and A(T)-data obtained with both ways of the spectra
analysis were analyzed in terms of the Debye model. The determined values of
the Debye temperatures agree well within the error limit with each other
proving that this very simple method is suitable for a quick determining of CS
and A spectral parameters.

<br>
Nanoelectronics devices, such as quantum dot systems or single-molecule
transistors, consist of a quantum nanostructure coupled to a macroscopic
external electronic circuit. Thermoelectric transport between source and drain
leads is controlled by the quantum dynamics of the lead-coupled nanostructure,
through which a current must pass. Strong electron interactions due to quantum
confinement on the nanostructure produce nontrivial conductance signatures such
as Coulomb blockade and Kondo effects, which become especially pronounced at
low temperatures. In this work we first provide a modern review of standard
quantum transport techniques, focusing on the linear response regime, and
highlight the strengths and limitations of each. In the second part, we develop
an improved numerical scheme for calculation of the ac linear electrical
conductance through generic interacting nanostructures, based on the numerical
renormalization group (NRG) method, and explicitly demonstrate its utility in
terms of accuracy and efficiency. In the third part we derive low-energy
effective models valid in various commonly-encountered situations, and from
them we obtain simple analytical expressions for the low-temperature
conductance. This indirect route via effective models, although approximate,
allows certain limitations of conventional methodologies to be overcome, and
provides physical insights into transport mechanisms. Finally, we apply and
compare the various techniques, taking the two-terminal triple quantum dot and
the serial multi-level double dot devices as nontrivial benchmark systems.
