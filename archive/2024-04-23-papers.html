<h3>Cation exchange synthesis of AgBiS$_2$ quantum dots for highly efficient  solar cells</h3>

<p>Silver bismuth sulfide (AgBiS$_2$) nanocrystals have emerged as a promising
eco-friendly, low-cost solar cell absorber material. Their direct synthesis
often relies on the hot-injection method, requiring the application of high
temperatures and vacuum for prolonged times. Here, we demonstrate an
alternative synthetic approach via a cation exchange reaction. In the
first-step, bis(stearoyl)sulfide is used as an air-stable sulfur precursor for
the synthesis of small, monodisperse Ag2S nanocrystals at room-temperature. In
a second step, bismuth cations are incorporated into the nanocrystal lattice to
form ternary AgBiS$_2$ nanocrystals, without altering their size and shape.
When implemented into photovoltaic devices, AgBiS$_2$ nanocrystals obtained by
cation exchange reach power conversion efficiencies of up to 7.35%,
demonstrating the efficacy of the new synthetic approach for the formation of
high-quality, ternary semiconducting nanocrystals.

<h3>Optimally scrambling chiral spin-chain with effective black hole  geometry</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14473" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14473</a>
<br>
</p><i>Aiden Daniel, Andrew Hallam, Matthew D. Horner, Jiannis K. Pachos</i>
<p>There is currently significant interest in emulating the essential
characteristics of black holes, such as their Hawking radiation or their
optimal scrambling behavior, using condensed matter models. In this article, we
investigate a chiral spin-chain, whose mean field theory effectively captures
the behavior of Dirac fermions in the curved spacetime geometry of a black
hole. We find that within the region of the chain that describe the interior of
the black hole, strong correlations prevail giving rise to many-body chaotic
dynamics. Employing out-of-time-order correlations as a diagnostic tool, we
numerically compute the associated Lyapunov exponent. Intriguingly, we observe
a linear increase in the Lyapunov exponent with temperature within the black
hole's interior at low temperatures, indicative of optimal scrambling behavior.
This contrasts with the quadratic temperature dependence exhibited by the
spin-chain on the region outside the black hole. Our findings contribute to a
deeper understanding of the interplay between black hole geometry and quantum
chaos, offering insights into fundamental aspects of quantum gravity.

<h3>Ferroelectric modulation of quantum emitters in monolayer WS$_2$</h3>

<p>Quantum photonics promises significant advances in secure communications,
metrology, sensing and information processing/computation. Single photon
sources are fundamental to this endeavor. However, the lack of high quality
single photon sources remains a significant obstacle. We present here a new
paradigm for the control of single photon emitters (SPEs) and single photon
purity by integrating monolayer WS$_2$ with the organic ferroelectric polymer
poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)). We demonstrate
that the ferroelectric domains in the P(VDF-TrFE) film control the purity of
single photon emission from the adjacent WS$_2$. By switching the ferroelectric
polarization, we reversibly tune the single photon purity between the
semi-classical and quantum light regimes, with single photon purities as high
as 94%. This provides another avenue for modulating and encoding quantum
photonic information, complementing more complex approaches. This novel
multidimensional heterostructure introduces a new avenue for control of quantum
emitters by combining the nonvolatile ferroic properties of a ferroelectric
with the radiative properties of the zero-dimensional atomic scale emitters
embedded in the two-dimensional WS$_2$ semiconductor monolayer.

<h3>Shot noise in coupled electron-boson systems</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14515" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14515</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yiming Wang, Shouvik Sur, Chandan Setty, Qimiao Si</i>
<p>The nature of charge carriers in strange metals has become a topic of intense
current investigation. Recent shot noise measurements in the quantum critical
heavy fermion metal YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ revealed a suppression of the Fano factor
that cannot be understood from electron-phonon scattering or strong electron
correlations in a Fermi liquid, indicating loss of quasiparticles. The
experiment motivates the consideration of shot noise in a variety of
theoretical models in which quasiparticles may be lost. Here we study shot
noise in systems with co-existing itinerant electrons and dispersive bosons,
going beyond the regime where the bosons are on their own in thermal
equilibrium. We construct the Boltzmann-Langevin equations for the coupled
system, and show that adequate electron-boson couplings restore the Fano factor
to its Fermi liquid value. Our findings point to the beyond-Landau form of
quantum criticality as underlying the suppressed shot noise of strange metals
in heavy fermion metals and beyond.

<h3>Effect of biquadratic magnetic exchange interaction in the 2D  antiferromagnets MPS_3 (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni)</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14553" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14553</a>
<br>
</p><i>Mohammad Amirabbasi, Peter Kratzer</i>
<p>The two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials MPS_3(M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni)
display antiferromagnetic ordering of the magnetic moments at the transition
metal ions. The possibility to exfoliate thin layers that preserve the magnetic
order makes these materials interesting for numerous applications in devices
that require integration of flexible patches of magnetic materials, e.g. in
antiferromagnetic spintronics. Hence, an improved understanding of their
magnetic properties is desirable. Here, we parameterize spin Hamiltonians for a
monolayer of all four materials of this class using density functional theory
plus Hubbard U calculations. We provide a step-by-step guide for calculating
the magnetic exchange interactions and magnetic anisotropy energy using the
(non-)collinear DFT+U(+ SOC) approach with a suitably chosen U for each
material. It is found that the biquadratic interactions gain in importance
while moving through the 3d series. Retaining the leading terms of a
Holstein-Primakoff-transformed spin Hamiltonian, the magnon spectra are
calculated. While MnPS_3 is found to be an almost isotropic antiferromagnet
with a tiny gap, the biquadratic interaction opens an increasingly wider gap
for FePS_3, CoPS_3 and NiPS_3. In line with this observation, Monte Carlo
simulations demonstrate that the biquadratic interactions contribute to a
systematic rise in the Neel temperature from FePS_3 to NiPS_3.

<h3>Fermiology and transport properties of the proposed topological  crystalline insulator SrAg4Sb2</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14561" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14561</a>
<br>
</p><i>J Green, Eve Emmanouilidou, Harry W. T. Morgan, William T. Laderer, Chaowei Hu, Jonathan Loera, Anastassia N. Alexandrova, Ni Ni</i>
<p>Compared to time-reversal symmetry-protected Z2 topological insulators and
Dirac/Weyl semimetals, there are significantly fewer candidates for topological
crystalline insulators. SrAg4Sb2 is predicted to exhibit topological
crystalline insulator behavior when considering spin-orbit coupling. In this
study, we systematically investigate single crystals of SrAg4Sb2 using
electrical transport and magnetic torque measurements, along with
first-principles calculations. Our transport data reveals its compensated
semimetal nature with a magnetoresistance up to around 700% at 2 K and 9 T.
Analysis of de Haas-van Alphen oscillations uncovers a Fermi surface consisting
of three distinct Fermi pockets with light effective masses. Comparison between
the three-dimensional fermiology obtained from our oscillation data and the
first-principles calculations demonstrates excellent agreement. This confirms
the accuracy of the calculations, which indicate a band inversion centered at
the {\Gamma} point and identify the existence of nontrivial tube and needle
hole Fermi pockets at {\Gamma}, alongside one trivial diamond electron pocket
at the T point in the Brillouin zone. Furthermore, symmetry and topology
analysis results in two potential sets of topological invariants, suggesting
the emergence of two-dimensional gapless Dirac surface states either on the ab
planes or on both the ab planes and mirror planes, protected by crystal
symmetries. Therefore, SrAg4Sb2 emerges as a promising candidate topological
crystalline insulator.

<h3>Superconducting Diode Effect in Two-dimensional Topological Insulator  Edges and Josephson Junctions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14566" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14566</a>
<br>
</p><i>Haixuan Huang, Tatiana de Picoli, Jukka I. V√§yrynen</i>
<p>The superconducting diode effect -- the dependence of critical current on its
direction -- can arise from the simultaneous breaking of inversion and
time-reversal symmetry in a superconductor and has gained interest for its
potential applications in superconducting electronics. In this letter, we study
the effect in a two-dimensional topological insulator (2D TI) in both a uniform
geometry as well as in a long Josephson junction. We show that in the presence
of Zeeman fields, a circulating edge current enables a large non-reciprocity of
the critical current. We find a maximum diode efficiency 1 for the uniform 2D
TI and $(\sqrt{2} - 1)^2 \approx 0.17$ for the long Josephson junction.

<h3>Control of a ferrimagnet phase by a two-component magnetic field</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Daria O. Ignatyeva, Nikolay A. Gusev, Anatoly K. Zvezdin, Vladimir I. Belotelov</i>
<p>We report a theoretical study of the phase diagram of a ferrimagnetic
iron-garnet with uniaxial anisotropy near a magnetization compensation point in
the presence of a two-component magnetic field. The study is performed based on
a quasi-antiferromagnetic approximation. The number and stability of the
equilibrium states of the Neel vector are analyzed using the effective energy
function. It is shown that application of the small out-of-plane magnetic field
in addition to the stronger in-plane magnetic field significantly changes the
equilibrium states of a ferrimagnet. The possibilities to control the
equilibrium Neel vector position and to switch between the monostable and
bistable states by tuning the value and ratio of the in-plane and out-of-plane
magnetic field components are demonstrated. This opens new possibilities for
the utilization of ferrimagnets since the magnetic field could be changed much
faster than the temperature.

<p>Empirical A-site cation substitution has advanced the stability and
efficiency of hybrid organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites solar cells and
the functionality of X-ray detectors. Yet, the fundamental mechanisms
underpinning their unique performance remain elusive. This multi-modal study
unveils the link between nanoscale structural dynamics and macroscopic
optoelectronic properties in these materials by utilising X-ray diffuse
scattering, inelastic neutron spectroscopy and optical microscopy complemented
by state-of-the-art machine learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations.
Our approach uncovers the presence of dynamic, lower-symmetry local nanodomains
embedded within the higher-symmetry average phase in various perovskite
compositions. The properties of these nanodomains are tunable via the A-site
cation selection: methylammonium induces a high density of anisotropic, planar
nanodomains of out-of-phase octahedral tilts, while formamidinium favours
sparsely distributed isotropic, spherical nanodomains with in-phase tilting,
even when crystallography reveals cubic symmetry on average. The observed
variations in the properties of dynamic nanodomains are in agreement with our
simulations and are directly linked to the differing macroscopic optoelectronic
and ferroelastic behaviours of these compositions. By demonstrating the
influence of A-site cation on local nanodomains and consequently, on
macroscopic properties, we propose leveraging this relationship to engineer the
optoelectronic response of these materials, propelling further advancements in
perovskite-based photovoltaics, optoelectronics, and X-ray imaging.

<h3>Unsupervised Learning of Individual Kohn-Sham States: Interpretable  Representations and Consequences for Downstream Predictions of Many-Body  Effects</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14601" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14601</a>
<br>
</p><i>Bowen Hou, Jinyuan Wu, Diana Y. Qiu</i>
<p>Representation learning for the electronic structure problem is a major
challenge of machine learning in computational condensed matter and materials
physics. Within quantum mechanical first principles approaches, Kohn-Sham
density functional theory (DFT) is the preeminent tool for understanding
electronic structure, and the high-dimensional wavefunctions calculated in this
approach serve as the building block for downstream calculations of correlated
many-body excitations and related physical observables. Here, we use
variational autoencoders (VAE) for the unsupervised learning of
high-dimensional DFT wavefunctions and show that these wavefunctions lie in a
low-dimensional manifold within the latent space. Our model autonomously
determines the optimal representation of the electronic structure, avoiding
limitations due to manual feature engineering and selection in prior work. To
demonstrate the utility of the latent space representation of the DFT
wavefunction, we use it for the supervised training of neural networks (NN) for
downstream prediction of the quasiparticle bandstructures within the GW
formalism, which includes many-electron correlations beyond DFT. The GW
prediction achieves a low error of 0.11 eV for a combined test set of metals
and semiconductors drawn from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB),
suggesting that latent space representation captures key physical information
from the original data. Finally, we explore the interpretability of the VAE
representation and show that the successful representation learning and
downstream prediction by our model is derived from the smoothness of the VAE
latent space, which also enables the generation of wavefunctions on arbitrary
points in latent space. Our work provides a novel and general machine-learning
framework for investigating electronic structure and many-body physics.

<h3>Shapiro Steps and Stability of Skyrmions Interacting with Alternating  Anisotropy Under the Influence of ac and dc Drives</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14612" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14612</a>
<br>
</p><i>J. C. Bellizotti Souza, N. P. Vizarim, C. J. O. Reichhardt, C. Reichhardt, P. A. Venegas</i>
<p>We use atomistic simulations to examine the sliding dynamics of a skyrmion in
a two-dimensional system containing a periodic one-dimensional stripe pattern
of variations between low and high values of the perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy. The skyrmion changes in size as it crosses the interface between
two anisotropy regions. Upon applying combined dc and ac driving in either
parallel or perpendicular directions, we observe a wide variety of Shapiro
steps, Shapiro spikes, and phase-locking phenomena. The phase-locked orbits
have two-dimensional dynamics due to the gyrotropic or Magnus dynamics of the
skyrmions, and are distinct from the phase-locked orbits found for strictly
overdamped systems. Along a given Shapiro step when the ac drive is
perpendicular to the dc drive, the velocity parallel to the ac drive is locked
while the velocity in the perpendicular direction increases with increasing
drive to form Shapiro spikes. At the transition between adjacent Shapiro steps,
the parallel velocity jumps up to the next step value, and the perpendicular
velocity drops. The skyrmion Hall angle shows a series of spikes as a function
of increasing dc drive, where the jumps correspond to the transition between
different phase-locked steps. At high drives, the Shapiro steps and Shapiro
spikes are lost. When both the ac and dc drives are parallel to the stripe
periodicity direction, Shapiro steps appear, while if the dc drive is parallel
to the stripe periodicity direction and the ac drive is perpendicular to the
stripe periodicity, there are only two locked phases, and the skyrmion motion
consists of a combination of sliding along the interfaces between the two
anisotropy values and jumping across the interfaces.

<h3>Primitive chain network simulations for double peaks in shear stress  under fast flows of bidisperse entangled polymers</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14629" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14629</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yuichi Masubuchi</i>
<p>A few experiments have reported that the time development of shear stress
under fast start-up shear deformations exhibits double peaks before reaching
the steady state for bimodal blends of entangled linear polymers in specific
conditions. To analyze the molecular origin of this phenomenon, multi-chain
slip-link simulations based on the primitive chain network model were conducted
for the data of a bimodal polystyrene solution reported by Osaki et al. [J Pol
Sci B Pol Phys, 38, 2043 (2000)] Owing to the reasonable agreement with the
data and the simulation results, the stress was decomposed into contributions
from long and short-chain components and decoupled into segment number,
stretch, and orientation. The analysis revealed that the first and second peaks
correspond to the short-chain orientation and the long-chain stretch,
respectively. The results also imply that the peak positions are not affected
by the mixing of short and long chains, whereas the second peak intensity
depends on the mixing conditions in a complicated manner, dominating the
emergence of double peaks.

<h3>Probing the Spin-Momentum Locking in Rashba Surfaces via Spin Current</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14630" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14630</a>
<br>
</p><i>J. E. Abr√£o, E. Gomes da Silva, G. Rodrigues-Junior, J. B. S. Mendes, A. Azevedo</i>
<p>In this work, we explore the intriguing spin-momentum locking phenomenon
within the Rashba states of antimony (Sb) films. By combining spin pumping with
the flow of an external charge current, we reveal the topological properties of
surface states in Sb films. Taking advantage of the well-defined spin
polarization of both spin-momentum-locked charge currents and spin-pumped
currents, we demonstrate precise manipulation over the direction and magnitude
of the resulting charging current, generated through the inverse
Rashba-Edelstein effect. This fascinating phenomenon is attributed to the
dynamic interaction between the accumulation of out-of-equilibrium pumped spins
and the flowing spins, intrinsically locked perpendicular to the direction of
the charge current. The results show that Sb as a promising material for basic
and applied investigation of spintronics phenomena. We believe that the
nanostructures investigated here open the way for the development of low-power
logic gates operating in the range of a few tens of microamperes.

<h3>Creation and Manipulation of Higher-Order Topological States by  Altermagnets</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14645" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14645</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yu-Xuan Li, Yichen Liu, Cheng-Cheng Liu</i>
<p>We propose to implement tunable higher-order topological states in a
heterojunction consisting of a two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator and
the recently discovered altermagnets, whose unique spin-polarization in both
real and reciprocal space and null magnetization are in contrast to
conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Based on symmetry analysis and
effective edge theory, we show that the special spin splitting in altermagnets
with different symmetries, such as $d$-wave, can introduce Dirac mass terms
with opposite signs on the adjacent boundaries of the topological insulator,
resulting in the higher-order topological state with mass-domain bound corner
states. Moreover, by adjusting the direction of the N\'{e}el vector, we can
manipulate such topological corner states by moving their positions. By
first-principles calculations, taking a 2D topological insulator bismuthene
with a square lattice on an altermagnet MnF$_2$ as an example, we demonstrate
the feasibility of creating and manipulating the higher-order topological
states through altermagnets. Finally, we discuss the experimental
implementation and detection of the tunable topological corner states, as well
as the potential non-Abelian braiding of the Dirac corner fermions.

<h3>Reversal in Thermally Driven Rotation of Chiral Liquid Crystal Droplets</h3>

</p><i>Shunsuke Takano, Takuya Nakanishi, Kenta Nakagawa, Toru Asahi</i>
<p>For chiral liquid crystals that express topologically protected defects and
thermally driven mechanical rotation, the size- and temperature-driven reversal
of the rotational direction of their droplets was demonstrated even under a
fixed temperature gradient. This unconventional reversal indicates the
dependence of thermomechanical coupling on the molecular orientational order,
this dependence is justified through an examination of the size, temperature,
and molecular structure as well as by phenomenological arguments on the order
parameter.

<p>The cubic $\beta$-Mn-type alloy Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$ is a chiral helimagnet
that exhibits a peculiar temperature-dependent behavior in the spiral pitch,
which decreases from 130 nm at room temperature to 70 nm below 20 K. Notably,
this shortening is also accompanied by a structural transition of the
metastable skyrmion texture, transforming from a hexagonal lattice to a square
lattice of elongated skyrmions. The underlying mechanism of these
transformations remain unknown, with interactions potentially involved
including temperature-dependent Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction,
magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and exchange anisotropy. Here, x-ray resonant
magnetic small-angle scattering in vectorial magnetic fields was employed to
investigate the temperature dependence of the anisotropic properties of the
helical phase in Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$. Our results reveal quantitatively that the
magnitude of the anisotropic exchange interaction increases by a factor of 4 on
cooling from room temperature to 20 K, leading to a 5% variation in the helical
pitch within the (001) plane at 20 K. While anisotropic exchange interaction
contributes to the shortening of the spiral pitch, its magnitude is
insufficient to explain the variation in the spiral periodicity from room to
low temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that magnetocrystalline and exchange
anisotropies compete, favoring different orientations of the helical vector in
the ground state.

<h3>Experimental measurement of mean transition path velocities of colloidal  particles surmounting energy barriers</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14699" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14699</a>
<br>
</p><i>Brandon R. Ferrer, Juan Ruben Gomez-Solano</i>
<p>Transition paths are rare events occurring when a system, thanks to the
effect of fluctuations, crosses successfully from one stable state to another
by surmounting an energy barrier. Even though they are of great significance in
many mesoscale processes, their direct determination is often challenging due
to their short duration as compared to other relevant time-scales. Here, we
measure the local average velocity along transition paths of a colloidal bead
embedded in a glycerol/water mixture that hops over a barrier separating two
optical potential wells. Owing to the slow dynamics of the bead in this viscous
medium, we can spatially resolve the mean velocity profiles of the transition
paths for distinct potentials, which agree with theoretical predictions of a
model for the motion of a Brownian particle traversing a parabolic barrier.
This allows us to experimentally verify various expressions linking the
behavior of such mean velocities with equilibrium and transition path position
distributions, mean transition-path times and mean escape times from the wells.
We also show that artifacts in the mean velocity profiles arise when reducing
the experimental time resolution, thus highlighting the importance of the
sampling rate in the characterization of the transition path dynamics. Our
results confirm that mean transition path velocity establishes a fundamental
relationship between mean transition path times and equilibrium rates in
thermally activated processes of small-scaled systems.

<h3>An Exactly Solvable Dual Bus Route Model</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14708" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14708</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ngo Phuoc Nguyen Ngoc, Huynh Anh Thi, Nguyen Van Vinh</i>
<p>In 1998, O'Loan et al. introduced a simplified bus route model to illustrate
bus dynamics. However, due to fluctuations in passenger numbers, achieving an
exact solution for the model's stationary state remains challenging, as these
fluctuations can impact the buses' behavior. In this study, we present an
exactly solvable model for the dual bus route model whose dynamics expand upon
O'Loan et al.'s model. Using this dual model allows us to analyze bus route
dynamics comprehensively. However, our model introduces additional parameters
not previously considered by O'Loan et al. to account for neighboring effects,
which have the potential to influence the average stationary current and
velocity of buses. When the neighboring effect is weak, our model behaves
similarly to O'Loan et al.'s bus route model. However, in the presence of a
strong neighboring effect, our model exhibits intriguing characteristics.

<h3>Monte Carlo Studies on Geometrically Confined Skyrmions in Nanodots:  Stability and Morphology under Radial Stresses</h3>

<br>
</p><i>G. Diguet, B. Ducharne, S. El Hog, F. Kato, H. Koibuchi, T. Uchimoto, H. T. Diep</i>
<p>We numerically study the stability and morphology of geometrically confined
skyrmions in nanodots using Finsler geometry (FG) modeling technique. The FG
model dynamically implements anisotropies in ferromagnetic interaction,
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and magneto-elastic coupling in response to
mechanical stresses. Without the stresses, there exists a geometrically
confined effect originating from the surface effect of small nanodots, in which
skyrmions are stabilized under a low external magnetic field. This surface
effect is enhanced by radial stresses, which significantly reduce the surface
DMI compared to the bulk DMI. The radial stresses also alter the interactions
to be anisotropic. Owing to these position- and direction-dependent
interactions, incomplete skyrmions emerge at the center of the nanodots under
the tensile stress. In addition to the incomplete skyrmions, target skyrmions
are observed under the compressive stress. Our numerical results indicate that
the strain-enhanced surface effect and the strain-induced interaction
anisotropies suitably explain the skyrmion stability in nanodots with zero
magnetic field.

<p>Boron vacancy centre ($V_{\rm B}^-$) ensembles in hexagonal boron nitride
(hBN) have attracted recent interest for their potential as two-dimensional
solid-state quantum sensors. Irradiation is necessary for $V_{\rm B}^-$
creation, however, to date only limited attention has been given to optimising
the defect production process, especially in the case of bulk irradiation with
high-energy particles, which offers scalability through the potential for
creating ensembles in large volumes of material. Here we systematically
investigate the effect of electron irradiation by varying the dose delivered to
a range of hBN samples, which differ in their purity, and search for an optimum
in measurement sensitivity. We find that moderate electron irradiation doses
($\approx 5\times 10^{18}$~cm$^{-2}$) appear to offer the best sensitivity, and
also observe a dependence on the initial crystal purity. These results pave the
way for the scalable and cost-effective production of hBN quantum sensors, and
provide insight into the mechanisms limiting $V_{\rm B}^-$ spin properties.

<p>The levitation of a cylindrical permanent magnet over a high-temperature
superconductor cooled by liquid nitrogen can be accompanied by spontaneous
oscillations and rotation. The reason for spontaneous rotation of the magnet is
magnetization inhomogeneity induced by the temperature gradient. An experiment
was carried out on the levitation of Nd-Fe-B magnets over a composite
high-temperature superconductor. The experimental results confirm that the
rotation frequency depends on the difference in the magnetization values in the
upper and lower halves of the magnet. Methods for controlling the rotation
frequency of a levitating magnet are proposed.

</p><i>Andrea Crovetto</i>
<p>I propose a general quantitative framework to evaluate the quality, track the
historical development, and guide future optimization of photovoltaic (PV)
absorbers at any development level, including both experimentally synthesized
and computer-simulated materials. The framework is based on a PV figure of
merit designed to include efficiency limitations due to imperfect photocarrier
collection that are not included in classic detailed balance methods.
Figure-of-merit-driven efficiency limits including collection losses are
calculated for 28 experimentally synthesized PV absorbers and 9 PV absorbers
simulated by electronic structure methods. Among emerging absorbers for which
no working solar cells have yet been reported, there are very large differences
in their likelihood to achieve high PV efficiencies.

<p>In the classic realm of impact mitigation, targeting different impact
scenarios with a universally designed device still remains an unassailable
challenge. In this study, we delve into the untapped potential of
Resch-patterned origami for impact mitigation, specifically considering the
adaptively reconfigurable nature of the Resch origami structure. Our
unit-cell-level analyses reveal two distinctive modes of deformation, each
characterized by contrasting mechanical responses: the folding mode that
displays monostability coupled with strain-hardening, and the unfolding mode
that manifests bistability, facilitating energy absorption through snap-through
dynamics. Drop tests further unveil a novel dynamic bifurcation phenomenon,
where the origami switches between folding and unfolding depending on impact
speed, thereby showcasing its innate self-reconfigurability in a wide range of
dynamic events. The tessellated meter-scale Resch structure mimicking an
automotive bumper inherits this dynamically bifurcating behavior, demonstrating
the instantaneous morphing into favorable deformation mode to minimize the peak
acceleration upon impact. This suggests a self-adaptive and universally
applicable impact-absorbing nature of the Resch-patterned origami system. We
believe that our findings pave the way for developing smart, origami-inspired
impact mitigation devices capable of real-time response and adaptation to
external stimuli, offering insights into designing universally protective
structures with enhanced performance in response to various impact scenarios.

<p>Polariton condensation relies on the massive occupation of the lowest-energy
polariton state beyond a required critical density. The mechanisms driving both
the occupation and depopulation of the lowest-energy polariton state all rely
on multi-particle scattering, and its dynamics determine the extent to which
condensates can form spontaneously. To pinpoint many-body processes hindering
polariton condensation in two-dimensional metal-halide semiconductors, we
examine the exciton-polariton dynamics in a Fabry-P\'erot microcavity over
timescales involving the dynamics of multi-particle polariton ($\ll 1$\,ps) and
exciton scattering processes ($\gg 1$\,ps). We find evidence of enhanced
nonlinear exciton-exciton scattering in the microcavity compared to that in the
semiconductor, and that the exciton reservoir mediates polariton scattering. We
posit that the complex scattering landscape between the exciton reservoir and
polaritons limits the formation of polariton condensates in two-dimensional
metal-halide semiconductors, and we discuss the generality of our conclusions
for materials systems in which the lattice mediates strong multi-particle
correlations.

<p>Dynamical properties of homogeneous Fermi-Fermi mixtures of dipolar and
non-dipolar atoms are studied at zero temperature, where dipoles are polarized
by an external field. We calculate the density-density correlation functions in
a ring-diagram approximation and analyze the pole structure to obtain
eigenfrequencies of collective excitations. We first determine stability phase
diagrams for the mixtures available in experiments: $^{167}$Er-$^{173}$Yb,
$^{167}$Er-$^{6}$Li, $^{161}$Dy-$^{173}$Yb, and $^{161}$Dy-$^{6}$Li systems,
and show that the mixtures with larger mass imbalance tend to be more unstable.
We then investigate the parameter dependence of an undamped zero sound with an
anisotropic real dispersion relation in the stable phase for the
$^{161}$Dy-$^{173}$Yb mixture, and the speed of sound exhibits a critical angle
of possible propagation with respect to the dipole polarization direction,
above which the sound mode disappears in the particle-hole continuum. Since the
sound mode is a coherent superposition of density fluctuations of dipolar and
non-dipolar atoms, the existence of the sound mode, e.g., the value of the
critical angle, is significantly affected by the inter-particle interaction
through the density-density correlation between dipolar and non-dipolar atoms.
We have also observed such an effect of the inter-particle interaction in the
study of a linear response of density fluctuations to an external perturbation.

<p>In the present work, we report the synthesis of Pb-Bi alloy with enhanced Tc
up to 9K, which is higher than that of Pb. The alloy is synthesized via solid
state reaction route in vacuum encapsulated quartz tube at 700C in an automated
furnace. The synthesized sample is characterized by X-ray Diffraction for its
phase purity. Rietveld refinement of XRD reveals that the end product is
majority hexagonal Pb7Bi3, with minor rhombohedral Bi. The electronic transport
measurement shows metallic behavior with the Debye temperature of 108K and a
superconductivity transition temperature (Tc) at below 9K, which is maximum
till date for any reported Pb-Bi alloy, Pb or Bi at ambient pressure . It is
possible that partial substitution of Bi at the Pb site, modifies the free
density of electronic states within BCS model to attain the optimum Tc, which
is higher by around 2K from the reported Tc of Pb. The superconductor phase
diagram derived from magneto-transport measurements reveals that the
synthesized alloy is a conventional superconductor with upper critical field
(Hc) of 3.9Tesla, which lies well within the Pauli paramagnetic limit.

<p>We investigate a quantum perceptron implemented on a quantum circuit using a
repeat until method. We evaluate this from the perspective of capacity, one of
the performance evaluation measures for perceptions. We assess a Gardner
volume, defined as a volume of coefficients of the perceptron that can
correctly classify given training examples using the replica method. The model
is defined on the quantum circuit. Nevertheless, it is straightforward to
assess the capacity using the replica method, which is a standard method in
classical statistical mechanics. The reason why we can solve our model by the
replica method is the repeat until method, in which we focus on the output of
the measurements of the quantum circuit. We find that the capacity of a quantum
perceptron is larger than that of a classical perceptron since the quantum one
is simple but effectively falls into a highly nonlinear form of the activation
function.

<p>We present a high-resolution single crystal x-ray diffraction study of Kagome
superconductor \cvs, exploring its response to variations in pressure and
temperature. We discover that at low temperatures, the structural modulations
of the electronic superlattice, commonly associated with charge density wave
order, undergo a transformation around $p \sim$ 0.7 GPa from the familiar
$2\times2$ pattern to a long-range ordered modulation at wavevector $q=(0, 3/8,
1/2)$. Our observations align with inferred changes in the CDW pattern from
prior transport and nuclear magnetic resonance studies, providing new insights
into these transitions. Interestingly, the pressure-induced variations in the
electronic superlattice correlate with two peaks in the superconducting
transition temperature as pressure changes, hinting that fluctuations within
the electronic superlattice could be key to stabilizing superconductivity.
However, our findings contrast with the minimal pressure dependency anticipated
by ab initio calculations of the electronic structure. They also challenge
prevailing scenarios based on a Peierls-like nesting mechanism involving van

The uniformly mixed state of the spin-1 polar state and spin-2 biaxial nematic

<h3>2D Monolayer Molybdenum (IV) Telluride TMD: An Efficient Electrocatalyst  for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</h3>

</p><i>Vikash Kumar, Srimanta Pakhira</i>
<p>An electrocatalyst is needed to efficiently lower the reaction barriers to
produce hydrogen through the H2 evolution reaction (HER). Recently,
two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs), such as the pure 2D
monolayer MoTe2 TMD, have become attractive materials for HER. Using the first
principle-based hybrid DFT-D method, we have computationally designed a pure 2D
monolayer MoTe2 TMD and examined its structural and electronic properties and
electrocatalytic efficacy towards HER. A non-periodic finite molecular cluster
model Mo10Te21 system was employed to explore the feasibility of both the
Volmer-Heyrovsky and Volmer-Tafel reaction mechanisms for the HER. The
solvent-phase calculations of the HER on the 2D monolayer MoTe2 TMD demonstrate
that this material can effectively undergo either Volmer-Heyrovsky or
Volmer-Tafel reaction pathways. This conclusion is supported by our
determination of low reaction barriers for the H*-migration, Heyrovsky, and
Tafel transition states (TSs), which were found to be approximately 9.80,
12.55, and 5.29 kcal.mol-1, respectively. These results highlight the potential
utility of MoTe2 TMD as a promising electrocatalyst for HER. The unusual
electrocatalytic activity of the pure 2D monolayer MoTe2 TMD is evidenced by
its ability to significantly reduce reaction barriers, achieving impressive
turnover frequency during the Heyrovsky and Tafel reaction steps, respectively.
Additionally, it demonstrates a remarkably low Tafel slope of 29.58 mV.dec-1.
Further exploration of its potential applications in electrocatalysis is
warranted. The present work provides valuable insights into the atomic
modulation of active sites for enhanced electrocatalytic performance towards
HER, paving a way for designing advanced non-noble metal free electrocatalysts.

<p>Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP-NCs) embedded in polymer matrices
are gaining traction for next-generation radiation detectors. While progress
has been made on green-emitting CsPbBr3 NCs, scant attention has been given to
the scintillation properties of CsPbCl3 NCs, which emit size-tunable UV-blue
light matching the peak efficiency of ultrafast photodetectors. In this study,
we explore the scintillation characteristics of CsPbCl3 NCs produced through a
scalable method and treated with CdCl2. Spectroscopic, radiometric and
theoretical analysis on both untreated and treated NCs uncover deep hole trap
states due to surface undercoordinated chloride ions, eliminated by Pb to Cd
substitution. This yields near-perfect efficiency and resistance to
polyacrylate mass-polymerization. Radiation hardness tests demonstrate
stability to high gamma doses while time-resolved experiments reveal ultrafast
radioluminescence with an average lifetime as short as 210 ps. These findings
enhance our comprehension of LHP NCs' scintillation properties, positioning
CsPbCl3 as a promising alternative to conventional fast scintillators.

<p>Exerting a nonequilibrium drive on an otherwise equilibrium Langevin process
brings the dynamics out of equilibrium but can also speedup the approach to the
Boltzmann steady-state. Transverse forces are a minimal framework to achieve
dynamical acceleration of the Boltzmann sampling. We consider a simple liquid
in three space dimensions subjected to additional transverse pairwise forces,
and quantify the extent to which transverse forces accelerate the dynamics. We
first explore the dynamics of a tracer in a weak coupling regime describing
high temperatures. The resulting acceleration is correlated with a monotonous
increase of the magnitude of odd transport coefficients (mobility and
diffusivity) with the amplitude of the transverse drive. We then develop a
nonequilibrium version of the mode-coupling theory able to capture the effect
of transverse forces, and more generally of forces created by additional
degrees of freedom. Based on an analysis of transport coefficients, both odd
and longitudinal, both for the collective modes and for a tracer particle, we
find a systematic acceleration of the dynamics. Quantitatively, the gain, which
is guaranteed throughout the ergodic phase, turns out to be a decreasing
function of temperature beyond a temperature crossover, in particular as the
glass transition is approached. Our theoretical results are in good agreement
with available numerical results.

<p>The polarized dipolar Fermi gas shows exotic properties at low temperatures,
characterized by an axially-deformed Fermi surface and anisotropic
single-particle energy, due to the long-range and anisotropic nature of
dipole-dipole interaction. In cold-atom experiments such a system has been
realized, e.g., in degenerate gas of Er and Dy atoms. In the case that
non-dipolar impurity atoms are introduced in such system, they undergoes an
induced interaction mediated by the density fluctuations of the background
dipolar Fermi gas. We derive the induced interaction potential to the
single-loop order of fluctuations and show that it becomes indeed an
anisotropic Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida-type potential which preserves the
axial symmetry around the polarization axis. We then solve the two-body problem
of impurity atoms interacting via the anisotropic potential and figure out the
dependence of bound state and scattering properties on the parameters of
dipolar Fermi gas.

</p><i>Koyena Bose, Ajit C. Balram</i>
<p>Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluids host quasiparticle excitations that
carry a fraction of the electronic charge. Moreover, in contrast to bosons and
fermions that carry exchange statistics of $0$ and $\pi$ respectively, these
quasiparticles of FQH fluids, when braided around one another, can accumulate a
Berry phase, which is a fractional multiple of $\pi$. Deploying the spherical
geometry, we numerically demonstrate that composite fermion particle (CFP)
excitations in the Jain FQH states carry Abelian fractional statistics.
Previously, the exchange statistics of CFPs were studied in the disk geometry,
where the statistics get obscured due to a shift in the phase arising from the
addition of another CFP, making its determination cumbersome without prior
knowledge of the shift. We show that on the sphere this technical issue can be
circumvented and the statistics of CFPs can be obtained more transparently. The
ideas we present can be extended to determine the statistics of quasiparticles
arising in certain non-Abelian partonic FQH states.

<p>The relaxation behaviour of isolated quantum systems taken out of equilibrium
is among the most intriguing questions in many-body physics. Quantum systems
out of equilibrium typically relax to thermal equilibrium states by scrambling
local information and building up entanglement entropy. However, kinetic
constraints in the Hamiltonian can lead to a breakdown of this fundamental
paradigm due to a fragmentation of the underlying Hilbert space into
dynamically decoupled subsectors in which thermalisation can be strongly
suppressed. Here, we experimentally observe Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF)
in a two-dimensional tilted Bose-Hubbard model. Using quantum gas microscopy,
we engineer a wide variety of initial states and find a rich set of
manifestations of HSF involving bulk states, interfaces and defects, i.e., d =
2, 1 and 0 dimensional objects. Specifically, uniform initial states with equal
particle number and energy differ strikingly in their relaxation dynamics.
Inserting controlled defects on top of a global, non-thermalising chequerboard
state, we observe highly anisotropic, sub-dimensional dynamics, an immediate
signature of their fractonic nature. An interface between localized and
thermalising states in turn displays dynamics depending on its orientation. Our
results mark the first observation of HSF beyond one dimension, as well as the
concomitant direct observation of fractons, and pave the way for in-depth
studies of microscopic transport phenomena in constrained systems

<p>Initializing the ground state of a quantum bit (qubit) based on Majorana zero
modes is one of the most pressing issues for future topological quantum
computers. We explore a parity-to-magnetism protocol for initializing such
topological qubits based on magnet-superconductor hybrid networks by coupling
magnetic chains to a single molecule magnet. The coupling can be activated by
switching the spin state of the molecule, allowing the ground state parity of
the chain to be controlled. We demonstrate that initialization with either
parity for a Majorana qubit can be achieved. We then introduce the dressed
Majorana qubit, which includes the state of the molecule in the definition of
the logical qubit. Using this definition we can initialize a qubit without
high-precision timing.

</p><i>Vimalesh Kumar Vimal, Jorge Cayao</i>
<p>Majorana bound states emerge in topological superconductors as zero-energy
edge states exhibiting spatial nonlocality. Despite the enormous advances, the
detection of Majorana bound states is still challenging mainly because
topologically trivial Andreev bound states produce similar signatures. In this
work we consider a topological superconductor with Majorana bound states
coupled to quantum dots and investigate the dynamics of their quantum
correlations with the aim to explore their entanglement properties. In
particular, we characterize entanglement by using concurrence and discord,
which are also complemented by the entanglement dynamics and return
probability. We find that Majorana bound states at truly zero energy can
transform an initially entangled system into its classical state, while they
can create maximally entangled states at a finite energy overlap.
Interestingly, we show that the system can generate a maximally entangled state
between MBSs and a quantum dot by simply controlling the Majorana nonlocality.
We demonstrate that these results hold in the scenarios when the initial state
is either maximally entangled or separable, albeit in the latter maximally
entangled states are achieved in the long time dynamics. Furthermore, we
contrast our findings with those produced by a regular fermion and obtain very
distinct entanglement signatures. Our work offers an alternative approach to
characterize Majorana bound states, which can be also useful towards their
utilization for quantum information tasks.

<p>Spangolite (Cu$_6$Al(SO$_4$)(OH)$_{12}$Cl$\cdot$3H$_2$O) is a hydrated
layered copper sulfate mineral whose crystal structure is well described by a
depleted triangular lattice of Cu$^{2+}$ ions in each layer. Experimental
measurements reveal a non-magnetic ground state at $T \sim 8\, \text{K}$ with
magnetization properties dominated by dimerisation. We propose a concrete model
of Cu$^{2+}$ spin-$1/2$ degrees of freedom on this geometrically frustrated and
effectively two-dimensional maple-leaf lattice. The distorted geometry of the
depleted triangular lattice layers results in a spatially anisotropic
Heisenberg model featuring five symmetry inequivalent couplings with
ferromagnetic bonds on hexagons and antiferromagnetic triangular bonds. The
validity of the proposed Hamiltonian is demonstrated by state-of-the-art tensor
network calculations which can assess both the nature of the ground state as
well as low-temperature thermodynamics, including effects of a magnetic field.
We provide theoretical support for a dimerized ground state by calculating the
static spin structure factor as well as the magnetic susceptibility, the latter
is shown to be in good agreement with experiment. We further predict the
emergence of magnetisation plateaus at high values of an external magnetic
field and study their melting with increasing temperature.

<p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for the advanced
photocatalytic active materials. These porous crystalline compounds have large
active surface area and structural tunability, highly competitive with oxides,
the well-established material class for the photocatalysis. However, due to
their complex organic and coordination chemistry composition, photophysical
mechanisms involved in the photocatalytic process in MOFs are still not well
understood. Employing electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, we
investigate the fundamental processes of electron and hole generation, as well
as capture events that lead to the formation of various radical species in
UiO-66, an archetypical MOF photocatalyst. As a result, we detected a manifold
of photoinduced electron spin centers, which we subsequently analyzed and
identified with the help of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our
findings provide new insights into the photo-induced charge transfer processes,
which are the basis of photocatalytic activity in UiO-66. This sets the stage

<p>By implementing a charge pumping scheme for one-dimensional aperiodic chains,
we confirm the existence of topological phases in these systems whenever their
finite-size realizations admit inversion symmetry. These phases are usually
characterized by an anomalous edge response as a result of the bulk-boundary
correspondence. We show that these signatures are all present in various
chains, each representing a different class of structural aperiodicity: the
Fibonacci quasicrystal, the Tribonacci quasicrystal, and the Thue-Morse chain.
More specifically, we calculate three quantities: the Berry phase of the
crystalline approximation of the finite-size systems, the polarization response
to an inifintesimal static and constant electric field in systems with open
boundary conditions, and the degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum. We find
that all of them provide signatures of a topologically nontrivial phase.

of associated 3-dimensional problems to less complex 2D ones. This has been
applied to the actinide ceramic, uranium dioxide, to replicate structures
typical in nuclear fission fuel pellets, in order to investigate the oxidation
and subsequent transformation of cubic UO$_{2}$ to orthorhombic U$_{3}$O$_{8}$.
This article shows how this synthesis approach could be utilised to investigate
a range of phenomena, affected by grain morphology, and highlights some unusual
results in the oxidation behaviour of UO$_{2}$, regarding the phase transition
to U$_{3}$O$_{8}$.

<p>Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a class of two-dimensional (2D)
layered materials that exhibit a diverse range of electronic structures,
including charge density waves (CDWs) that can lead to insulating,
semiconducting, metallic, and even superconducting phases. While the formation
of CDWs in these systems has been recognized in early research [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 129, 156401 (2022); Nat. Phys. 11, 328 (2015)], the underlying mechanisms
driving the commensurate CDW (CCDW) phase remain largely unexplored. CCDWs
typically originate from factors such as perfect Fermi surface nesting and/or
electron-phonon coupling, causing the divergence of the chiral electronic
structure. However, in the case of layered 2D TMD materials with CCDW phases,
the significance of reconstructed electronic structures resulting from periodic
lattice distortions (PLD) and photoemission matrix element effects in the CCDW
instability needs to be visualized. This study focuses on computationally
accessible CCDW phases in 1T-Ta$S_2$, a prototypical TMD with a rich CDW phase
diagram, aiming to understand the origins of CCDW phases. The insights gained
from this investigation have the potential to advance the application of 2D
materials in next-generation electronics, quantum sensing and information
science.

<h3>A detailed first-principles study of the structural, elastic,  thermomechanical and optoelectronic properties of binary rare-earth  tritelluride NdTe3</h3>

</p><i>Tanbin Chowdhury, B. Rahman Rano, Ishtiaque M. Syed, S. H. Naqib</i>
<p>Rare-earth tritellurides (RTe3) are popular for their charge density wave
(CDW) phase, magnetotransport properties and pressure induced superconducting
state among other features. In this literature, Density functional theory has
been exploited to study various properties of NdTe3. The calculated elastic and
thermomechanical parameters, which were hitherto untouched for any RTe3,
uncover soft, ductile, highly machinable and damage tolerant characteristics,
as well as highly anisotropic mechanical behavior of this layered compound. Its
thermomechanical properties make it a prospective thermal barrier coating
material. Band structure, density of states, Fermi surfaces and various optical
functions of the material have been reported. The band structure demonstrates
highly directional metallic nature. The highly dispersive bands indicate very
low effective charge carrier mass for the in-plane directions. The Fermi
surfaces display symmetric pockets, including signs of nesting, bilayer
splitting among others, corroborating previous works. The optical spectra
expose high reflectivity across the visible region, while absorption is high in
the ultraviolet region. Two plasma frequencies are noticed in the optical loss
function. The optical conductivity, reflectivity and absorption reaffirm its
metallic properties. The electronic band structure manifests evidence of CDW
phase in the ground state.

<p>We present an in-depth analysis of a single-electron box (SEB) biased through
a floating node technique that is common in charge-coupled devices (CCDs). The
device is analyzed and characterized in the context of single-electron
charge-sensing techniques for integrated silicon quantum dots (QD). The unique
aspect of our SEB design is the incorporation of a metallic floating node,
strategically employed for sensing and precise injection of electrons into an
electrostatically formed QD. To analyse the SEB, we propose an extended
multi-orbital Anderson impurity model (MOAIM), adapted to our nanoscale SEB
system, that is used to predict theoretically the behaviour of the SEB in the
context of a charge-sensing application. The validation of the model and the
sensing technique has been carried out on a QD fabricated in a fully depleted
silicon on insulator (FDSOI) process on a 22-nm technological node. We
demonstrate the MOAIM's efficacy in predicting the observed electronic behavior
and elucidating the complex electron dynamics and correlations in the SEB. The
results of our study reinforce the versatility and precision of the model in
the realm of nanoelectronics and highlight the practical utility of the
metallic floating node as a mechanism for charge injection and detection in
integrated QDs. Finally, we identify the limitations of our model in capturing
higher-order effects observed in our measurements and propose future outlooks
to reconcile some of these discrepancies.

<p>A hitherto unexploited characteristic feature of emerging iontronic devices
for information processing is the intrinsic mobility of the medium (water) of
dissolved ions in aqueous electrolytes, which therefore not only respond to
voltage but also to pressure. Here we study a microfluidic memristor, in the
form of a conical channel, exposed to simultaneously applied time-dependent
voltage and pressure drops, through numerical solutions of the
Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Stokes equations for ion and fluid transport. We show
that the channel's memristive properties can be enhanced, reduced or
instantaneously reset by a suitable pressure, and we leverage this finding with
two examples of time series processing of simultaneously applied voltage and
pressure pulses. We not only show that the distinction between different
voltage time series can be improved by enhancing the conductance response with
corresponding pressure pulses, but also that the bandwidth of information
transfer through the channel can be doubled by letting the pressure pulses
represent a second independent time series.

<h3>Single-Spin Waved-Brim Flat-Top Hat in the Band Edge of GdIH Monolayer</h3>

</p><i>Ningning Jia, Zhao Yang, Jiangtao Cai, Zhiheng Lv, Yongting Shi, Tielei Song, Xin Cui, Zhifeng Liu</i>
<p>Exotic electronic bands, such as flat bands, linear crossing bands,
spontaneously valley- or spin-polarized bands, in two-dimensional materials
have been the hot topics in condensed matter physics. Herein, we first propose
a general dispersion model for possible hat-like electronic bands, and then
identify an intriguing single-spin \emph{waved-brim flat-top hat} in the
valence band edge of a stable ferromagnetic semiconducting electrene (i.e.,
Janus GdIH monolayer), which can be well described by a simplified two-bands
Hamiltonian model. Specifically, the hat-band has a waved brim with six valleys
along the boundary of the first Brillouin zone; meanwhile it holds a flat top
close to the Fermi level, resulting in the emergence of single-spin van Hove
singularities divergence and Lifshitz transitions. Owing to the breaking of
both time-reversal and space inversion symmetries, a sizable spontaneous valley
polarization is formed between the adjacent brim valleys, which provides the
opportunity to realize the high-temperature anomalous valley Hall effect.
Particularly, via modest strains and carriers doping, various conductive
bipolar-states (spin-up vs. spin-down, K valley vs. $-$K valley, and
ultra-low-speed vs. ultra-high-speed) can be modulated out from the distorted
waved-brim flat-top hat of GdIH ML.

<p>A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the
beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are
common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a
reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize
the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic
system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an
extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf
waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave
beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the
propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the
nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light
spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic
simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be
readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale,
which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and
magnonic devices.

<h3>Higher-magnesium-doping effects on the singlet ground state of the  Shastry-Sutherland SrCu2(BO3)2</h3>

<p>Doping of quantum antiferromagnets is an established approach to investigate
the robustness of their ground state against the competing phases. Predictions
of doping effects on the ground state of the Shastry-Sutherland dimer model are
here verified experimentally on Mg-doped SrCu2(BO3)2. A partial incorporation
of Mg2+ on the Cu2+-site in the SrCu2(BO3)2 structure leads to a subtle but
systematic lattice expansion with the increasing Mg-doping concentration, which
is accompanied by a concomitant decrease in the spin gap, the Curie-Weiss
temperature and the peak temperature of the susceptibility. These findings
indicate a doping-induced breaking of Cu2+ spin-1/2 dimers which is also
corroborated by X-band EPR spectroscopy that points to a systematic increase in
intensity of free Cu2+ sites with increasing Mg-doping concentration. Extending
the Mg-doping up to nominal x = 0.10 or SrCu1.9Mg0.1(BO3)2, in the
magnetisation measurements taken up to 35 T, a suppression of the pseudo-1/8
plateau is found along with a clear presence of an anomaly at an onset critical
field H'C0 ~ 9 T. The latter, absent in pure SrCu2(BO3)2, emerges due to the
coupling of liberated Cu2+ spin-1/2 entities in the vicinity of Mg-doping
induced impurities.

<h3>Asymmetric rectified electric fields for symmetric electrolytes</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15055" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15055</a>
<br>
</p><i>A. Barnaveli, R. van Roij</i>
<p>In this paper, building upon the discovery of asymmetric rectified electric
fields (AREF) in recent experiments [S.H. Hashemi et al., Physical Review
Letters 121, 185504 (2018)], we explore the generation of AREF by applying a
sawtooth-like voltage to 1:1 electrolytes with equal diffusion coefficients
confined between two planar blocking electrodes. This differs from an earlier
approach based on a sinusoidal AC voltage applied to 1:1 electrolytes with
unequal diffusion coefficients. By numerically solving the full
Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations, we demonstrate that AREF can be generated by a
slow rise and a fast drop of the potential (or vice versa), even for
electrolytes with equal diffusion coefficients of the cations and anions. We
employ an analytically constructed equivalent electric circuit to explain the
underlying physical mechanism. Importantly, we find that the strength of AREF
can be effectively tuned from zero to its maximal value by only manipulating
the time-dependence of the driving voltage, eliminating the necessity to modify
the electrolyte composition between experiments. This provides valuable
insights to control the manipulation of AREF, which facilitates enhanced
applications in diverse electrochemical systems.

<p>The Rashba spin-orbit coupling effect, primarily arising from
structural-inversion asymmetry in periodic crystals, has garnered considerable
attention due to its tunability and potential applications in spintronics. Its
capability to manipulate electron spin without an external magnetic field opens
new avenues for spintronic device design, particularly in semiconductor
technology. Within this framework, 2D Rashba materials hold special interest
due to their inherent characteristics, which facilitate miniaturization and
engineering capabilities. In this Perspective article, we provide an overview
of recent advancements in the research of 2D Rashba materials, aiming to offer
a comprehensive understanding of the diverse manifestations and multifaceted
implications of the Rashba effect in material science. Rather than merely
presenting a list of materials, our approach involves synthesizing various
viewpoints, assessing current trends, and addressing challenges within the
field. Our objective is to bridge the gap between fundamental research and
practical applications by correlating each material with the necessary
advancements required to translate theoretical concepts into tangible
technologies. Furthermore, we highlight promising avenues for future research
and development, drawing from insights gleaned from the current state of the

<h3>Successive Phase Transition in Higher-order Topological Anderson  Insulators</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15088" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15088</a>
<br>
</p><i>Aodong Li, Bingcong Xu, Biye Xie</i>
<p>Disorder, traditionally believed to hinder the propagation of waves. has
recently been shown to prompt the occurrence of topological phase transitions.
For example, when disorder strength continuously increases and surpasses
certain critical value, a phase transition from topologically trivial to
nontrivial insulating phases occurs. However, in the parameter domain of the
nontrivial phase, whether there exists a finer phase diagram that can be
further classified by different disorder strengths is still unclear. Here we
present a successive topological phase transition driven by the disorder
strength in a higher-order topological insulator with long-range couplings. As
the strength of the disorder gradually increases, the real-space topological
invariant of the system undergoes a consecutive change from 0 to 4, accompanied
by the stepped increase in the number of boundary-localized corner states. Our
work opens an avenue for utilizing disorder to induce phase transitions among
different higher-order topological insulators.

<h3>Geometric measures of uniaxial solids of revolution in  ${\mathbb{R}^{4}}$ and their relation to the second virial coefficient</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15092" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15092</a>
<br>
</p><i>Markus Kulossa, Joachim Wagner</i>
<p>We provide analytical expressions for the second virial coefficients of hard,
convex, monoaxial solids of revolution in ${\mathbb{R}^{4}}$. The excluded
volume per particle and thus the second virial coefficient is calculated using
quermassintegrals and rotationally invariant mixed volumes based on the
Brunn-Minkowski theorem. We derive analytical expressions for the mutual
excluded volume of four-dimensional hard solids of revolution in dependence on
their aspect ratio $\nu$ including the limits of infinitely thin oblate and
infinitely long prolate geometries. Using reduced second virial coefficients
$B_2^{\ast}=B_2/V_{\mathrm{P}}$ as size-independent quantities with
$V_{\mathrm{P}}$ denoting the $D$-dimensional particle volume, the influence of
the particle geometry to the mutual excluded volume is analyzed for various
shapes. Beyond the aspect ratio $\nu$, the detailed particle shape influences
the reduced second virial coefficients $B_2^{\ast}$. We prove that for
$D$-dimensional spherocylinders in arbitrary-dimensional Euclidean spaces
${\mathbb{R}^{D}}$ their excluded volume solely depends on at most three
intrinsic volumes, whereas for different convex geometries $D$ intrinsic
volumes are required. For $D$-dimensional ellipsoids of revolution, the general
parity $B_2^{\ast}(\nu)=B_2^{\ast}(\nu^{-1})$ is proven.

<h3>Designing athermal disordered solids with automatic differentiation</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15101" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15101</a>
<br>
</p><i>Mengjie Zu, Carl Goodrich</i>
<p>The ability to control forces between sub-micron-scale building blocks offers
considerable potential for designing new materials through self-assembly. A
typical paradigm is to first identify a particular (crystal) structure that has
some desired property, and then design building-block interactions so that this
structure assembles spontaneously. While significant theoretical and
experimental progress has been made in assembling complicated structures in a
variety of systems, this two-step paradigm fundamentally fails for structurally
disordered solids, which lack a well-defined structure to use as a target. Here
we show that disordered solids can still be treated from an inverse
self-assembly perspective by targeting material properties directly. Using the
Poisson's ratio, $\nu$, as a primary example, we show how differentiable
programming connects experimentally relevant interaction parameters with
emergent behavior, allowing us to iteratively "train" the system until we find
the set of interactions that leads to the Poisson's ratio we desire. Beyond the
Poisson's ratio, we also tune the pressure and a measure of local 8-fold
structural order, as well as multiple properties simultaneously, demonstrating
the potential for nontrivial design in disordered solids. This approach is
highly robust, transferable, and scalable, can handle a wide variety of model
systems, properties of interest, and preparation dynamics, and can optimize
over 100s or even 1000s of parameters. This result connects the fields of
disordered solids and inverse self-assembly, indicating that many of the tools
and ideas that have been developed to understand the assembly of crystals can
also be used to control the properties of disordered solids.

<h3>Overlapping plastic events as a mechanism for irreversible dynamics in  amorphous solids under oscillatory shear</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15106" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15106</a>
<br>
</p><i>Asaf Szulc, Ido Regev</i>
<p>The origin of the transition from asymptotically reversible to asymptotically
irreversible response in amorphous solids subject to oscillatory shear is still
unknown. It is known that the plastic events that result from shearing always
involve localized particle rearrangements, but it is unclear why some are
reversible while others are not. Here we show, using simulations and models,
that overlaps between particle rearrangements caused by straining the solid in
alternating directions can cause the response to become irreversible when they
occur frequently. As the forcing amplitude increases, plastic events become
more frequent, the number of such overlaps increases, and the probability of
the system returning to previous states diminishes.

<h3>Motion of 2D exciton in momentum space leads to pseudospin distribution  narrowing on the Bloch Sphere</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15120" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15120</a>
<br>
</p><i>Garima Gupta, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Kausik Majumdar</i>
<p>Motional narrowing implies narrowing induced by motion, for example, in
nuclear resonance, the thermally induced random motion of the nuclei in an
inhomogeneous environment leads to counter-intuitive narrowing of the resonance
line. Similarly, the excitons in monolayer semiconductors experience magnetic
inhomogeneity: the electron-hole spin-exchange interaction manifests as an
in-plane pseudo-magnetic field with a periodically varying orientation inside
the exciton band. The excitons undergo random momentum scattering and
pseudospin precession repeatedly in this inhomogeneous magnetic environment -
typically resulting in fast exciton depolarization. On the contrary, we show
that such magnetic inhomogeneity averages out at high scattering rate due to
motional narrowing. Physically, a faster exciton scattering leads to a narrower
pseudospin distribution on the Bloch sphere, implying a nontrivial improvement
in exciton polarization. The in-plane nature of the pseudo-magnetic field
enforces a contrasting scattering dependence between the circularly and
linearly polarized excitons - providing a spectroscopic way to gauge the sample
quality.

</p><i>Dario Baratella, Omar Abou El Kheir, Marco Bernasconi</i>
<p>A machine-learned interatomic potential for Ge-rich Ge$_x$Te alloys has been
developed aiming at uncovering the kinetics of phase separation and
crystallization in these materials. The results are of interest for the
operation of embedded phase change memories which exploits Ge-enrichment of
GeSbTe alloys to raise the crystallization temperature. The potential is
generated by fitting a large database of energies and forces computed within
Density Functional Theory with the neural network scheme implemented in the
DeePMD-kit package. The potential is highly accurate and suitable to describe
the structural and dynamical properties of the liquid, amorphous and
crystalline phases of the wide range of compositions from pure Ge and
stoichiometric GeTe to the Ge-rich Ge$_2$Te alloy. Large scale molecular
dynamics simulations revealed a crystallization mechanism which depends on
temperature. At 600 K, segregation of most of Ge in excess occurs on the ns
time scale followed by crystallization of nearly stoichiometric GeTe regions.
At 500 K, nucleation of crystalline GeTe occurs before phase separation,
followed by a slow crystal growth due to the concurrent expulsion of Ge in
excess.

<p>Spin-mechanical coupling is vital in diverse fields including spintronics,
sensing and quantum transduction. Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials
provide a unique platform for investigating spin-mechanical coupling,
attributed to their mechanical flexibility and novel spin orderings. However,
studying spin-mechanical coupling in 2D magnets presents challenges in probing
mechanical deformation and thermodynamic properties change at nanoscale. Here
we use nano opto-electro-mechanical interferometry to mechanically detect the
phase transition and magnetostriction effect in multilayer CrSBr, an air-stable
antiferromagnets with large magnon-exciton coupling. The transitions among
antiferromagnetism, spin-canted ferromagnetism and paramagnetism are visualized
by optomechanical frequency anomalies. Nontrivial magnetostriction coefficient
2.3x10^(-5) and magnetoelastic coupling strength on the order of 10^6 J/m^3
have been found. Moreover, we demonstrate the substantial tunability of the
magnetoelastic constant by nearly 50% via gate-induced strain. Our findings
demonstrate the strong spin-mechanical coupling in CrSBr and paves the way for
developing sensitive magnetic sensing and efficient quantum transduction at
atomically thin limit.

<p>We report a very large spin-orbit torque (SOT) capability of chromium-based
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) in their Janus forms CrXTe, with X=S,Se.
The structural inversion symmetry breaking, inherent to Janus structures is
responsible for a large SOT response generated by giant Rashba splitting,
equivalent to that obtained by applying a transverse electric field of $\sim
100 \,\text{V} \,\text{nm}^{-1}$ in non-Janus CrTe\textsubscript{2}, completely
out of experimental reach. By performing transport simulations on custom-made
Wannier tight-binding models, Janus systems are found to exhibit a SOT
performance comparable to the most efficient two-dimensional materials, while
allowing for field-free perpendicular magnetization switching owing to their
reduced in-plane symmetry. Altogether, our findings evidence that magnetic
Janus TMDs stand as suitable candidates for ultimate SOT-MRAM devices.

<h3>A general multi-wave quasi-resonance theory for lattice energy diffusion</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15147" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15147</a>
<br>
</p><i>Wei Lin, Weicheng Fu, Zhen Wang, Yong Zhang, Hong Zhao</i>
<p>In this letter, a multi-wave quasi-resonance framework is established to
analyze energy diffusion in classical lattices, uncovering that it is
fundamentally determined by the characteristics of eigenmodes. Namely, based on
the presence and the absence of extended modes, lattices fall into two
universality classes with qualitatively different thermalization behavior. In
particular, we find that while the one with extended modes can be thermalized
under arbitrarily weak perturbations in the thermodynamic limit, the other
class can be thermalized only when perturbations exceed a certain threshold,
revealing for the first time the possibility that a lattice cannot be
thermalized, violating the hypothesis of statistical mechanics. Our study
addresses conclusively the renowned Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou problem for large
systems under weak perturbations, underscoring the pivotal roles of both
extended and localized modes in facilitating energy diffusion and
thermalization processes.

<p>Recently, considerable efforts have been made on research and improvement for
Ni-rich lithium-ion batteries to meet the demand from vehicles and grid-level
large-scale energy storage. Development of next-generation high-performance
lithium-ion batteries requires a comprehensive understanding on the underlying
electrochemical mechanisms associated with its structural evolution. In this
work, advanced operando neutron diffraction and four-dimensional scanning
transmission electron microscopy techniques are applied to clarify the
structural evolution of electrodes in two distinct full cells with identical
LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode but different anode counterparts. It is found that
both of cathodes in two cells exhibit non-intrinsic two-phase-like behavior at
the early charge stage, indicating selective Li+ extraction from cathodes. But
the heterogeneous evolution of cathode is less serious with graphite-silicon
blended anode than that with graphite anode due to the different delithiation
rate. Moreover, it is revealed that the formation of heterogeneous structure is
led by the distribution of defects including Li/Ni disordering and microcracks,
which should be inhibited by assembling appropriate anode to avoid potential
threaten on cell performance. The present work unveils the origin of
inhomogeneity in Ni-rich lithium-ion batteries and highlights the significance
of kinetics control in electrodes for batteries with higher capacity and longer
life.

<p>Magnetic topological semimetals LnSbTe (Ln = Lanthanide) have attracted
intensive attention because of the presence of interplay between magnetism,
topological, and electron correlations depending on the choices of magnetic Ln
elements. Recently, varying Sb-Te composition has been found to effectively
control the electronic and magnetic states in LnSbxTe$_{2-x}$. With this
motivation, we report the evolution of magnetic properties with Sb-Te
substitution in NdSb$_x$Te$_{2-x+\delta}$. Our work reveals the interesting
non-monotonic change in magnetic ordering temperature with varying composition
stoichiometry. In addition, reducing the Sb content x drives the reorientation
of moments from in-plane (ab-plane) to out-of-plane (c-axis) direction that
results in the distinct magnetic structures for two end compounds NdTe$_2$ ($x
= 0$) and NdSbTe ($x = 1$). Furthermore, the moment orientation in
NdSb$_x$Te$_{2-x+\delta}$ is also found to be strongly tunable upon application
of weak magnetic field, leading to rich magnetic phases depending on the
composition stoichiometry, temperature, and magnetic field. Such strong tuning
of magnetism in this material establishes it as a promising platform for
investigating tunable topological states and correlated topological physics.

<p>Strong changes in bulk properties, such as modulus and viscosity, are
observed near the glass transition temperature, T_{g}, of amorphous materials.
For more than a century, intense efforts have been made to define a microscopic
origin for these macroscopic changes in properties. Using transition state
theory, we delve into the atomic/molecular level picture of how microscopic
localized relaxations, or "cage rattles," translate to macroscopic structural
relaxations above T_{g}. Unit motion is broken down into two populations: (1)
simultaneous rearrangement occurs among a critical number of units, n_{\alpha},
which ranges from 1 to 4, allowing a systematic classification of glasses that
is compared to fragility; (2) near T_{g}, adjacent units provide additional
free volume for rearrangement, not simultaneously, but within the "primitive"
lifetime, {\tau}_{1}, of one unit rattling in its cage. Relaxation maps
illustrate how Johari-Goldstein \{beta} relaxations stem from the rattle of
n_{\alpha} units. We analyzed a wide variety of glassy materials, and materials
with glassy response, using literature data. Our four-parameter equation fits
"strong" and "weak" glasses over the entire range of temperatures and also
extends to other glassy systems, such as ion-transporting polymers and
ferroelectric relaxors. The role of activation entropy in boosting
preexponential factors to high "unphysical" apparent frequencies is discussed.

<p>Ferroelectric hafnia exhibits promising robust polarization and silicon
compatibility for ferroelectric devices. Unfortunately, it suffers from
difficult polarization switching. Methods to enable easier polarization
switching are needed, and the underlying reason for this switching difficulty
is not understood. Here, we investigated the 180$^\circ$ domain walls of hafnia
and their motion through nucleation. We found that the domains of
multiple-order parameter hafnia possess complicated three-dimensional dipole
patterns and lead to domain walls of different symmetry. The most common domain
wall type is a complex domain wall involving reversal of both polarization and
tetragonality order parameters. This domain wall symmetry ensures a good
matching of the dipoles perpendicular to the domain wall, which leads to low
domain wall energy. However, this ensures a sharp, high energy, charged domain
wall on the edges of nuclei that results in difficult nucleation. Thus, this
domain wall is too stable to move, which explains the switching difficulty of
hafnia. By contrast, another simple domain wall, involving only polarization
reversal, has a poor matching of dipoles perpendicular to the domain wall. This
leads to higher domain wall energy and ensures a diffusive and low energy
charged domain wall that enables easier nucleation. This simple domain wall is
thus not too stable and easier to move. Our theory advances domain wall
nucleation theory from the field of conventional single-order parameter to
multiple-order parameters. We propose controlling the populations of different
domain wall types in hafnia as a way to enable fast polarization switching and
lower coercive fields.

<p>We theoretically propose a polymer-based nano-device consisting of a single
trans-polyacetylene (tPA) molecule capacitively coupled to external voltage
gates. We model the integrated device using a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)-like
Hamiltonian, and we demonstrate the emergence of localized domain walls (DWs)
with quantized charges (i.e., soliton excitations) localized at the gates.
Interestingly, by increasing the applied voltage, multiple discrete charges can
be accumulated, which may be useful for potential technological applications.
Exploiting the topological character of the solitonic excitations of tPA, this
device can be considered as an organic-based quantum dot with a very large and
robust quantized charge.
