<h3>Microhydrodynamics of an autophoretic particle near a plane interface</h3>

We study the autophoretic motion of a spherical active particle interacting
chemically and hydrodynamically with its fluctuating environment in the limit
of rapid diffusion and slow viscous flow. Then, the chemical and hydrodynamic
fields can be expressed in terms of integrals over boundaries. The resulting
boundary-domain integral equations provide a direct way of obtaining the
traction on the particle, requiring the solution of linear integral equations.
An exact solution for the chemical and hydrodynamic problems is obtained for a
particle in an unbounded domain. For motion near boundaries, we provide
corrections to the unbounded solutions in terms of chemical and hydrodynamic
Green's functions, preserving the dissipative nature of autophoresis in a
viscous fluid for all physical configurations. Using this, we give the fully
stochastic update equations for the Brownian trajectory of an autophoretic
particle in a complex environment. Finally, we demonstrate our method by
studying autophoresis near a plane interface of fixed viscosity ratio and
solute permeability. We provide explicit solutions to the chemical and
hydrodynamic problems with high accuracy for this system geometry. We apply our
theoretical results in numerical simulations of the dynamics of a bottom-heavy
Brownian Janus particle near a wall.

We study the transport dynamics of an interacting tilted (Stark) chain. We
show that the crossover between diffusive and subdiffusive dynamics is governed
by $F\sqrt{L}$, where $F$ is the strength of the field, and $L$ is the
wave-length of the excitation. While the subdiffusive dynamics persist for
large fields, the corresponding transport coefficient is exponentially
suppressed with $F$ so that the finite-time dynamics appear almost frozen. We
explain the crossover scale between the diffusive and subdiffusive transport by
bounding the dynamics of the dipole moment for arbitrary initial state. We also
prove its emergent conservation at infinite temperature. Consequently, the
studied chain is one of the simplest experimentally realizable models for which
numerical data are consistent with the hydrodynamics of fractons.

<h3>Collective excitations of a Bose-condensed gas: Fate of second sound in  the crossover regime between hydrodynamic and collisionless regimes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01988" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01988</a>
<br>
<i>Hoshu Hiyane, Shohei Watabe, Tetsuro Nikuni</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop the moment method for Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) at finite
temperatures that enable us to study collective sound modes from the
hydrodynamic to the collisionless regime. In particular, we investigate
collective excitations in a weakly interacting dilute Bose gas by applying the
moment method to the Zaremba-Nikuni-Griffin equation, which is the coupled
equation of the Boltzmann equation with the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii
equation. Utilizing the moment method, collective excitations in the crossover
regime between the hydrodynamic and collisionless regimes are investigated in
detail. In the crossover regime, the second sound mode loses the weight of the
density response function because of the significant coupling with incoherent
modes, whereas the first sound shows a distinct but broad peak structure. We
compare the result obtained by the moment method with that of the Landau
two-fluid equations and show that the collective mode predicted by the Landau
two-fluid equations well coincides with the result from the moment method even
far from the hydrodynamic regime, whereas clear distinction also emerges in the
relatively higher momentum regime.

A pedagogical formulation of Loschimidt's paradox and H-theorem is presented
with basic notation on occupancy on discrete states without invoking collision
operators. A conjecture, so called H- theorem do-conjecture, build via invoking
causal inference perspective on the dynamical evolution of classical
many-particle system on a statistical ensemble. A numerical simulation of
random walkers for deterministic diffusion demonstrate the causal effect of
interventional ensemble, showing a dynamical behaviour as a test of the
proposed conjecture. Moreover, the chosen game like dynamics provides an
accessible practical example, in order to demonstrate increase in entropy over
time, for students of statistical physics as a toy system.

<h3>Analytic solutions for irregular diffusion equations with concentration  dependent diffusion coefficients</h3>

<i>I.F. Barna, L. Matyas</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate diffusion equations which have concentration dependent
diffusion coefficients with physically two relevant Ans\"atze, the self-similar
and the traveling wave Ansatz. We found that for power-law concentration
dependence some of the results can be expressed with a general analytic
implicit formulas for both trial functions.
For the self-similar case some of the solutions can be given with a formula
containing the hypergeometric function. For the traveling wave case different
analytic formulas are given for different exponents.
For some physically reasonable parameter sets the direct solutions are given
and analyzed in details.

<h3>Reviving the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis Theorem in Open Quantum Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01475" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01475</a>
<br>
<i>Yi-Neng Zhou, Xingyu Li, Hui Zhai, Chengshu Li, Yingfei Gu</i>
<br>
<br>
In closed systems, the celebrated Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem states
that a one-dimensional locally interacting half-integer spin chain with
translation and spin rotation symmetry cannot have a non-degenerate gapped
ground state. However, the applicability of this theorem is diminished when the
system interacts with a bath and loses its energy conservation. In this letter,
we propose that the LSM theorem can be revived in the entanglement Hamiltonian
when the coupling to bath renders the system short-range correlated.
Specifically, we argue that the entanglement spectrum cannot have a
non-degenerate minimum, isolated by a gap from other states. We further support
the results with numerical examples where a spin-$1/2$ system is coupled to
another spin-$3/2$ chain serving as the bath. Compared with the original LSM
theorem which primarily addresses UV--IR correspondence, our findings unveil
that the UV data and topological constraints also have a pivotal role in
shaping the entanglement in open quantum many-body systems.

<h3>Resummation-based Quantum Monte Carlo for Entanglement Entropy  Computation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01490" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01490</a>
<br>
<i>Menghan Song Ting-Tung Wang, Zi Yang Meng</i>
<br>
<br>
Based on the recently developed resummation-based quantum Monte Carlo method
for the SU($N$) spin and loop-gas models, we develop a new algorithm, dubbed
ResumEE, to compute the entanglement entropy (EE) with greatly enhanced
efficiency. Our ResumEE converts the evaluation of the exponentially small
value of the $\langle e^{-S^{(2)}}\rangle$, where $S^{(2)}$ is the 2nd order
R\'enyi EE, to an important sampling process with polynomial accuracy such that
the $S^{(2)}$ for a generic 2D quantum SU($N$) spin models can be readily
computed without facing the exponential explosion of its variance. We benchmark
our algorithm with the previously proposed estimators of $S^{(2)}$ on 1D and 2D
SU($2$) Heisenberg spin systems to reveal its superior performance and then use
it to detect the entanglement scaling data of the N\'eel-to-VBS transition on
2D SU($N$) Heisenberg model with continuously varying $N$. Our ResumEE
algorithm solves the critical problem of precisely evaluating the quantum
entanglement in many-body systems and will have a significant impact on
reliable access to the conformal field theory data for the highly entangled
quantum matter.

<h3>Pseudogap phases, chiral anomaly and topological order with quantum loop  entanglement</h3>

A many-body quantum system whose topological defects are conserved, abundant
and mobile is a correlated quantum liquid. Since topological defects can be
classified by homotopy groups, each homotopy identifies a class of quantum
liquids. Here we explore the quantum liquids based on the $\pi_3(S^2)$ homotopy
group, i.e. Hopf fibration. Their topologically non-trivial dynamics emerges
from the interlinking between magnetic flux or skyrmion loops in the charge and
spin sectors respectively. We lay down a field theory foundation for analyzing
such states by naturally incorporating the well-known framing regularization
into the theory, and constructing the appropriate topological Lagrangian terms.
We show that at least two strongly correlated phases of interlinked loops can
exist in $d=3$ spatial dimensions at zero and low finite temperatures. These
phases are closely related to the chiral quantum anomaly and do not have an
obvious topological order, but they are distinguished from the trivial
disordered phase with a generalization of the Wilson loop operator. In $d=4$
spatial dimensions, interlinked loops are able to produce topological order at
zero temperature, featuring charge, angular momentum and braiding
fractionalization. We discuss some possible experimental signatures of loop
entanglement in the quantum noise of charge currents.

<h3>Hot electron diffusion, microwave noise, and piezoresistivity in Si from  first principles</h3>

Ab-initio calculations of charge transport properties in materials without
adjustable parameters have provided microscopic insights into electron-phonon
interactions which govern charge transport properties. Other transport
properties such as the diffusion coefficient provide additional microscopic
information and are readily accessible experimentally, but few ab-initio
calculations of these properties have been performed. Here, we report
first-principles calculations of the hot electron diffusion coefficient in Si
and its dependence on electric field over temperatures from 77 -- 300 K. While
qualitative agreement in trends such as anisotropy at high electric fields is
obtained, the quantitative agreement that is routinely achieved for low-field
mobility is lacking. We examine whether the discrepancy can be attributed to an
inaccurate description of f-type intervalley scattering by computing the
microwave-frequency noise spectrum and piezoresistivity. These calculations
indicate that any error in the strength of f-type scattering is insufficient to
explain the diffusion coefficient discrepancies. Our findings suggest that the
measured diffusion coefficient is influenced by factors such as space charge
effects which are not included in ab-initio calculations, impacting the
interpretation of this property in terms of charge transport processes.

<h3>Effect of Triangular Pre-Cracks on the Mechanical Behavior of 2D  MoTe$_2$: A Molecular Dynamics Study</h3>

Among two-dimensional (2D) materials, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)
stand out for their remarkable electronic, optical, and chemical properties. In
addition to being variable bandgap semiconductor materials, the atomic thinness
provides flexibility to TMDs. Therefore, understanding the physical properties
of TMDs for applications in flexible and wearable devices is crucial. Despite
the growing enthusiasm surrounding two-dimensional transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs), our understanding of the mechanical characteristics of
molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe$_2$) remains limited. The mechanical properties of
MoTe$_2$ deteriorate in the presence of pre-existing cracks or vacancy defects,
which are very common in grown TMDs. In this study, the fracture properties and
crack propagation of monolayer molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe$_2$) sheets
containing pre-existing triangular cracks with various vertex angles are
investigated by performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of uniaxial and
biaxial tensile loading. Due to pre-crack length, angle, and perimeter
variations, monolayer MoTe$_2$ with pre-existing cracks underwent considerable
changes in Young's modulus, tensile strength, fracture toughness, and fracture
strain values. We have found that the pre-cracked MoTe$_2$ is more brittle than
its pristine counterpart. Regulated alteration of pre-crack angle under
constant simulation conditions improved the uniaxial mechanical properties.
Similarly, regulated alteration of the perimeter of the pre-crack resulted in
improved biaxial mechanical properties. This study contributes to the
foundational knowledge for advanced design strategies involving strain
engineering in MoTe$_2$ and other similar transition metal dichalcogenides.

<h3>Mechanical Forces Quench Frontal Polymerization: Experiments and Theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01559" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01559</a>

Frontal polymerization is a promising energy-saving method for rapid
fabrication of polymer components with good mechanical properties. In these
systems, a small energy input is sufficient to convert monomers, from a liquid
or soft solid state, into a stiff polymer component. Once the reaction is
initiated, it propagates as a self-sustaining front that is driven by the heat
released from the reaction itself. While several studies have been proposed to
capture the coupling between thermodynamics and extreme chemical kinetics in
these systems, and can explain experimentally observed thermo-chemical
instabilities, only few have considered the potential influence of mechanical
forces that develop in these systems during fabrication. Nonetheless, some
experiments do indicate that local volume changes induced by the competing
effects of thermal expansion and chemical shrinkage, can lead to significant
deformation or even failure in the resulting component. In this work, we
present a unique experimental approach to elucidate the effect of mechanics on
the propagation. Our experiments reveal that residual stresses that arise in
frontal polymerization are not only a potential cause of undesired deformations
in polymer products, but can also quench the reaction front. This
thermo-chemo-mechanically coupled effect is captured by our theoretical model,
which explains the mechanical limitations on frontal polymerization and can
guide future fabrication. Overall, the findings of this work suggest that
mechanical coupling needs to be taken into consideration to enable industrial
applications of frontal polymerization at large scales.

We introduce and explore the magnetization behavior in a quantum spin system
on a cactus graph, deemed the Cactus Graph Model (CGM), featuring an exact
dimer singlet ground state. We analyze the singlet-triplet gap, interactions
among excited triplets, and correlated hopping under an external magnetic field
using a strong coupling expansion. Employing an effective hard-core boson
representation, we unveil density wave magnetization plateaus and supersolid
phases, revealing the intricate interplay between interactions and hopping
dynamics. Furthermore, we conjecture that correlated hopping gives rise to
multi-triplet bound states, and potentially engendering to the stabilization of
additional low-lying magnetization plateaus.

We discuss problems associated with the notion of pH in heterogeneous
systems. For homogeneous systems, standardization protocols lead to a well
defined quantity, which although different from S\o rensen's original idea of
pH, is well reproducible and has become accepted as the measure of the
``hydrogen potential". On the other hand, for heterogeneous systems, pH defined
in terms of the chemical part of the electrochemical activity is
thermodynamically inconsistent and runs afoul of the Gibbs-Guggenheim principle
that forbids splitting of the electrochemical potential into separate chemical
and electrostatic parts -- since only the sum of two has any thermodynamic
meaning. The problem is particularly relevant for modern simulation methods
which involve charge regulation of proteins, polyelectrolytes, nanoparticles,
colloidal suspensions etc. In this paper we show that titration isotherms
calculated using semi-grand canonical simulations can be very different from
the ones obtained using canonical reactive Monte Carlo simulations.

<h3>The distribution of shortest path lengths on trees of a given size in  subcritical Erdős-Rényi networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01591" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01591</a>
<br>
<i>Barak Budnick, Ofer Biham, Eytan Katzav</i>
<br>
<br>
In the subcritical regime Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) networks consist of finite
tree components, which are non-extensive in the network size. The distribution
of shortest path lengths (DSPL) of subcritical ER networks was recently
calculated using a topological expansion [E. Katzav, O. Biham and A.K.
Hartmann, Phys. Rev. E 98, 012301 (2018)]. The DSPL, which accounts for the
distance $\ell$ between any pair of nodes that reside on the same finite tree
component, was found to follow a geometric distribution of the form $P(L=\ell |
L < \infty) = (1-c) c^{\ell - 1}$, where $0 < c < 1$ is the mean degree of the
network. This result includes the contributions of trees of all possible sizes
and topologies. Here we calculate the distribution of shortest path lengths
$P(L=\ell | S=s)$ between random pairs of nodes that reside on the same tree
component of a given size $s$. It is found that $P(L=\ell | S=s) =
\frac{\ell+1}{s^{\ell}} \frac{(s-2)!}{(s-\ell-1)!}$. Surprisingly, this
distribution does not depend on the mean degree $c$ of the network from which
the tree components were extracted. This is due to the fact that the ensemble
of tree components of a given size $s$ in subcritical ER networks is sampled
uniformly from the set of labeled trees of size $s$ and thus does not depend on
$c$. The moments of the DSPL are also calculated. It is found that the mean
distance between random pairs of nodes on tree components of size $s$ satisfies
${\mathbb E}[L|S=s] \sim \sqrt{s}$, unlike small-world networks in which the
mean distance scales logarithmically with $s$.

The linear magnetoelectric effect (ME) is the phenomenon by which an electric
field produces a magnetization. Its observation requires both time-reversal and
space-inversion symmetries to be broken, as in multiferroics. While the ME
effect has only been studied in insulating materials, it can actually exist in
non-centrosymmetric conductors such as two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs)
with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. It is then coined the Edelstein effect (EE),
by which a bias voltage -- generating a charge current -- produces a transverse
spin density, i.e. a magnetization. Interestingly, 2D systems are sensitive to
voltage gating, which provides an extra handle to control the EE. Here, we show
that the sign of the EE in a SrTiO$_3$ 2DEG can be controlled by a gate
voltage. We propose various logic devices harnessing the dual control of the
spin density by current and gate voltages and discuss the potential of our
findings for gate-tunable non-reciprocal electronics.

<i>Gionni Marchetti</i>
<br>
<br>
We proposed a formally exact, first-principles probabilistic method to assess
the validity of the Thomas-Fermi approximation in condensed matter systems
where electron dynamics is constrained to the Fermi surface. Our method, which
relies on accurate solutions of the radial Schr\"odinger equation, yields the
probability density function for momentum transfer. This allows for the
computation of expectation values to be compared with unity. We applied this
method to three {\it n}-type direct-gap III-V model semiconductors (GaAs, InAs,
InSb) and found that the Thomas-Fermi approximation is certainly valid at high
electron densities. In these cases, the probability density function exhibits
the same profile, irrespective of the material under scrutiny. Furthermore, we
show that this approximation can lead to serious errors in the computation of
observables when applied to GaAs at zero temperature for most electron
densities under scrutiny.

We report the synthesis and magnetic characterization of stuffed rare earth
gallium garnets, RE3+xGa5-xO12 (RE=Lu, Yb, Er, Dy, Gd), for x up to 0.5. The
excess rare earth ions partly fill the octahedral sites normally fully occupied
by Ga3+, forming disordered pairs of corner-shared face-sharing magnetic
tetrahedra. The Curie-Weiss constants and observed effective moments per rare
earth are smaller than are seen for the unstuffed gallium garnets. No
significant change in the field-dependent magnetization is observed but missing
entropy is seen when integrating the low-temperature heat capacity to 0.5 K.

Group formation and coordination are fundamental characteristics of living
systems, essential for performing tasks and ensuring survival. Interactions
between individuals play a key role in group formation, and the impact of
resource distributions is a vibrant area of research. Using active particles in
a tuneable optical environment as a model system, we demonstrate that
heterogeneous energy source distributions result in smaller, more stable groups
with reduced individual exchange between clusters compared to homogeneous
conditions. Reduced group sizes can be beneficial to optimise resources in
heterogeneous environments and to control information flow within populations.
Devoid of biological complications, our system provides insights into the
importance of patchy landscapes in ecological dynamics and holds implications
for refining swarm intelligence algorithms and enhancing crowd control
techniques.

Controlling magnetic properties through the application of an electric field
is a significant challenge in modern nanomagnetism. In this study, we
investigate the magneto-ionic control of magnetic anisotropy in the topmost Co
layer in Ta/Pt/[Co/Al/Pt]$_n$/Co/Al/AlO$_\text{x}$ multilayer stacks comprising
$n +1$ Co layers and its impact on the magnetic properties of the multilayers.
We demonstrate that the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy can be reversibly
quenched through gate-driven oxidation of the intermediary Al layer between Co
and AlO$_\text{x}$, enabling dynamic control of the magnetic layers
contributing to the out-of-plane remanence - varying between $n$ and $n +1$.
For multilayer configurations with $n = 2$ and $n = 4$, we observe reversible
and non-volatile additions of 1/3 and 1/5, respectively, to the anomalous Hall
effect amplitude based on the applied gate voltage. Magnetic imaging reveals
that the gate-induced spin-reorientation transition occurs through the
propagation of a single 90$^{\circ}$ magnetic domain wall separating the
perpendicular and in-plane anisotropy states. In the 5-repetition multilayer,
the modification leads to a doubling of the period of the magnetic domains at
remanence. These results demonstrate that the magneto-ionic control of the
anisotropy of a single magnetic layer can be used to control the magnetic
properties of coupled multilayer systems, extending beyond the gating effects
on a single magnetic layer.

<h3>Stability and Dynamics of Atom-Molecule Superfluids Near a Narrow  Feshbach Resonance</h3>

The recent observations of a stable molecular condensate emerging from a
condensate of bosonic atoms and related ``super-chemical" dynamics have raised
an intriguing set of questions. Here we provide a microscopic understanding of
this unexpected stability and dynamics in atom-molecule superfluids; we show
one essential element behind these phenomena is an extremely narrow Feshbach
resonance in $^{133}$Cs at 19.849G. Comparing theory and experiment we
demonstrate how this narrow resonance enables the dynamical creation of a large
closed-channel molecular fraction superfluid, appearing in the vicinity of
unitarity. Theoretically the observed superchemistry (\textit{i.e.}, Bose
enhanced reactions of atoms and molecules), is found to be assisted by the
formation of Cooper pairs of bosonic atoms having opposite momenta.
Importantly, this narrow resonance opens the possibility to explore the quantum
critical point of a molecular Bose superfluid and related phenomena which would
not be possible near a more typically broad Feshbach resonance.

The GW approximation has been widely accepted as an ab initio tool for
calculating defect levels with many-electron effect included. However, the GW
simulation cost increases dramatically with the system size, and,
unfortunately, large supercells are often required to model low-density defects
that are experimentally relevant. In this work, we propose to accelerate GW
calculations of point defects by reducing the simulation cost of the
many-electron screening, which is the primary computational bottleneck. The
random-phase approximation of many-electron screening is divided into two
parts: one is the intrinsic screening, calculated using a unit cell of pristine
structures, and the other is the defect-induced screening, calculated using the
supercell within a small energy window. Depending on specific defects, one may
only need to consider the intrinsic screening or include the defect
contribution. This approach avoids the summation of many conductions states of
supercells and significantly reduces the simulation time. We have applied it to
calculating various point defects, including neutral and charged defects in
two-dimensional and bulk systems with small or large bandgaps. The results
consist with those from the direct GW simulations, and the agreements are
further improved at the dilute-defect limit, which is experimentally relevant
but extremely challenging for direct GW simulations. This defect-patched
screening approach not only clarifies the roles of defects in many-electron
screening but also paves the way to fast screen defect structures/materials for
novel applications, including single-photon sources, quantum qubits, and
quantum sensors.

<h3>Active motion of tangentially-driven polymers in periodic array of  obstacles</h3>

<br>
<br>
We computationally investigate the active transport of tangentially-driven
polymers with varying degrees of flexibility and activity in two-dimensional
square lattices of obstacles. Tight periodic confinement induces notable
conformational changes and distinct modes of transport for flexible and stiff
active filaments. It leads to localization and caging of flexible polymers
inside the inter-obstacle pores, while promoting more elongated conformations
and enhanced diffusion for stiff polymers at low to moderate activity levels.
The migration of flexible active polymers occurs via hopping events, where they
unfold to move from one cage to another. In contrast, stiff chains travel
mainly in straight paths within inter-obstacle channels, while occasionally
changing their direction of motion. Both the duration of caging and persistent
directed migration within the channels decrease with increasing the activity
level. As a consequence, at high active forces polymers overcome confinement
effects and transport within inter-obstacle pores as swiftly as those in free
space. We explain the center of mass dynamics of semiflexible polymers in terms
of active force and obstacle packing fraction by developing an approximate
analytical theory.

An artificial spin ice consisting of numerous ferromagnets has attracted
attention because of its applicability to practical devices. The ferromagnets
interact through their stray magnetic field and show various functionality. The
ferromagnetic element in the spin ice was recently made in elliptical-shape or
stadium-shape. The former has a narrow edge, expecting to generate a large
stray magnetic field. The latter has a large volume and is also expected to
generate a large stray magnetic field. Here, we estimate the stray magnetic
field by numerically integrating the solution of the Poisson equation. When
magnetization is parallel to an easy axis, the elliptical-shaped ferromagnet
generates a larger stray magnetic field than the stadium-shaped ferromagnet.
The stray magnetic fields from both ferromagnets for arbitrary magnetization
directions are also investigated.

<h3>Vortex in superconducting thin-film strips of arbitrary width</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01722" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01722</a>
<br>
<i>N. Nakagawa, V. G. Kogan</i>
<br>
<br>
The currents and field distributions of a vortex in a thin superconducting
strip of a width $W$ is considered. It is shown that unlike infinite films
where the vortex field crosses the film only in one direction (say, from the
half-space under the film to the half-space above it), in strips (as well as in
finite size film samples of any shape) the field lines go back to the lower
half-space not only out of the sample but also through certain strip parts. The
strip patches where the magnetic lines ``dive" back to the space under the
strip are situated mostly near the strip edges at the strip and out of it. The
magnetic flux through the strip associated with the vortex is shown to be less
than the flux quantum and depends on the vortex position. The suppression of
the vortex flux is strong in narrow strips with $W<<\Lambda=2\lambda^2/d$ where
$\lambda$ is the bulk London penetration depth and $d$ is the film thickness.
The vortex energy scales roughly with $W/\Lambda$ and depends on vortex
position.

<h3>Complex magnetic interactions and critical behavior analysis in  quaternary CoFeV$_{0.8}$Mn$_{0.2}$Si Heusler alloy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01790" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01790</a>
<br>
<i>Guru Dutt Gupt, P. D. Babu, R. S. Dhaka</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the magnetic behavior and critical exponents of quaternary
CoFeV$_{0.8}$Mn$_{0.2}$Si Heusler alloy to understand the interactions across
the Curie temperature ($T_{\rm C}$). The Rietveld refinement of the x-ray
diffraction pattern with the space group F$\bar{4}$3m confirms a single-phase
cubic Y-type crystal structure. The magnetic susceptibility $\chi (T)$ data
show a ferromagnetic nature with a second-order phase transition from
paramagnetic to ferromagnetic at $446\pm1$~K. The saturation magnetization at
5~K is determined to be 2.2~$\mu_B$/f.u., which found to be close to the
Slater--Pauling rule and indicates its half-metallic nature. The values of
asymptotic critical exponents ($\beta$, $\gamma$, and $\delta$) and the $T_{\rm
C}$ are extracted through detailed analytical analysis including the Modified
Arrott plot, the Kouvel-Fisher (K--F) method, and the Widom scaling relation.
Interestingly, the estimated values of $\beta$ = 0.369 and $\gamma$ = 1.445
closely approximate the theoretical values of the 3D Heisenberg model and
second-order thermodynamic phase transition across the $T_{\rm C}$. The
obtained exponents lead to the collapse of renormalized isotherms, represented
by the relationship between the magnetization (m) and the applied magnetic
field (h), into two distinct branches above and below the $T_{\rm C}$, which
validates the reliability of the analysis. Furthermore, these exponents suggest
that the spin interaction follows a decay pattern of $J(r) \sim r^{-4.99}$,
indicating a short-range magnetic ordering, akin to the itinerant-electron 3D
Heisenberg model.

<h3>Active Caustics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01829" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01829</a>
<br>
<i>Rahul Chajwa, Rajarshi, Sriram Ramaswamy, Rama Govindarajan</i>
<br>
<br>
When heavy particles in turbulent flow are centrifuged out of vortices they
cluster to form singular features in the number density [Phys Fluids 27, 033305
(2015)], termed caustics for their resemblance to focal surfaces in optics. We
show here that self-propelled particles (SPPs) with Reynolds number $Re= 0$ and
thus no mechanical inertia display similar behaviour, thanks to the persistence
of their motion in the direction of their intrinsic orientation. Using singular
perturbation analysis and numerical studies we establish that SPPs form
caustics at a critical distance from the origin of a point vortex. To capture
the dynamics in a generic vortical flow we study SPPs advected by Navier-Stokes
turbulence and find pronounced caustics in straining regions, for intermediate
values of a non-dimensional self-propulsion velocity. Our work offers a route
to singularly high local concentrations in a macroscopically dilute suspension
of zero-Re swimmers, with potentially game-changing implications for
communication and sexual reproduction. An intriguing open direction is whether
the active turbulence of a suspension of swimming microbes could serve to
generate caustics in its own concentration.

<h3>The influence of the magnetic field on the nucleation and properties of  0-degree domain boundaries in uniaxial films with inhomogeneous  magnetoelectric interaction</h3>

<br>
<i>Robert Vakhitov, Rostislav Solonetsky, Alina Ibragimova</i>
<br>
<br>
The paper investigates the behavior of 0 degree domain boundaries arising in
uniaxial magnetic films with flexomagnetoelectric effect in a magnetic field.
It is shown that at certain orientations of the magnetic field, it is possible
to significantly enhance (or weaken) the degree of manifestation of the
flexomagnetoelectric effect in the studied films. In addition, by varying the
magnitude and directions of the magnetic field, it is possible to significantly
lower (up to zero) the value of the critical electric field of the origin of
this inhomogeneity. It is also established that a 0 degree domain boundary of
non-Anelian type, in which induced bound charges do not create a resultant
field (field shielding), when a magnetic field directed perpendicular to the
plane of rotation of magnetic moments is applied, a flexomagnetoelectric effect
occurs, which increases with increasing magnitude of the magnetic field.

<h3>Pushing thermal conductivity to its lower limit in crystals with simple  structures</h3>

<br>
<br>
Materials with low thermal conductivity usually have complex crystal
structures. Herein we experimentally find that a simple crystal structure
material AgTlI2 (I4/mcm) owns an extremely low thermal conductivity of 0.25
W/mK at room temperature. To understand this anomaly, we perform in-depth
theoretical studies based on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and
anharmonic lattice dynamics. We find that the unique atomic arrangement and
weak chemical bonding provide a permissive environment for strong oscillations
of Ag atoms, leading to a considerable rattling behavior and giant lattice
anharmonicity. This feature is also verified by the experimental probability
density function refinement of single-crystal diffraction. The particularly
strong anharmonicity breaks down the conventional phonon gas model, giving rise
to non-negligible wavelike phonon behaviors in AgTlI2 at 300 K. Intriguingly,
unlike many strongly anharmonic materials where a small propagative thermal
conductivity is often accompanied by a large diffusive thermal conductivity, we
find an unusual coexistence of ultralow propagative and diffusive thermal
conductivities in AgTlI2 based on the thermal transport unified theory. This
study underscores the potential of simple crystal structures in achieving low
thermal conductivity and encourages further experimental research to enrich the
family of materials with ultralow thermal conductivity.

<h3>A unifying representation of path integrals for fractional Brownian  motions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01863" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01863</a>
<br>
<i>O. Benichou, G. Oshanin</i>
<br>
<br>
Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is an experimentally-relevant, non-Markovian
Gaussian stochastic process with long-ranged correlations between the
increments, parametrised by the so-called Hurst exponent $H$; depending on its
value the process can be sub-diffusive $(0 < H < 1/2)$, diffusive $(H = 1/2)$
or super-diffusive $(1/2 < H < 1)$. There exist three alternative equally often
used definitions of fBm -- due to L\'evy and due to Mandelbrot and van Ness
(MvN), which differ by the interval on which the time variable is formally
defined. Respectively, the covariance functions of these fBms have different
functional forms. Moreover, the MvN fBms have stationary increments, while for
the L\'evy fBm this is not the case. One may therefore be tempted to conclude
that these are, in fact, different processes which only accidentally bear the
same name. Recently determined explicit path integral representations also
appear to have very different functional forms, which only reinforces the
latter conclusion. Here we develope a unifying equivalent path integral
representation of all three fBms in terms of Riemann-Liouville fractional
integrals, which links the fBms and proves that they indeed belong to the same
family. We show that the action in such a representation involves the
fractional integral of the same form and order (dependent on whether $H < 1/2$
or $H > 1/2$) for all three cases, and differs only by the integration limits.

<h3>Size effects on dislocation starvation in Cu nanopillars : A molecular  dynamics simulations study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01873" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01873</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Size plays an important role on the deformation mechanism of nanopillars.
With decreasing size, many FCC nanopillars exhibit dislocation starvation state
which is responsible for their high strength. However, many details about the
dislocation starvation mechanism like how often it occurs, and how much is its
contribution to the total plastic strain, are still elusive. Similarly, the
size below which the dislocation starvation occurs in the nanopillars is not
clearly established. In this context, the atomistic simulations have been
performed on the compressive deformation of $<$110$>$ Cu nanopillars with size
(d) ranging from 5 to 21.5 nm. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results
indicate that the nanopillars deform by the slip of extended dislocations and
exhibit dislocation starvation mainly at small sizes ( $<$ 20 nm). The
frequency of the occurrence of dislocation starvation is highest in small size
nanowires and it decreases with increasing size. Above the nanopillar size of
20 nm, no dislocation starvation has been observed. Further, we define the
dislocation starvation strain and based on this, it has been shown that, the
contribution of dislocation starvation state to the total plastic strain
decreases from 70\% in small size nanopillars to below 5\% in large size
pillars. The present results suggest that the dislocation starvation is a
dominant phenomena in small size nanopillars.

Materials that are susceptible to pressure and external magnetic fields allow
the combined use of both for caloric processes. Here we report investigations

<h3>Microscopic Analysis of Lattice Distortion Effects in Rashba Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01891" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01891</a>
<br>
<i>Yuuki Ogawa, Takumi Funato, Hiroshi Kohno</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically study the effects of dynamical lattice distortion in a
three-dimensional Rashba system based on a tight-binding model. Considering an
$sp$-electron system on a tetragonal lattice with broken inversion symmetry,
lattice distortions are incorporated through hopping-integral and crystal-axis
modulations. The effective Hamiltonian for the $p_z$- or $s$-derived band is
found to have Rashba modulation terms, which induce various types of spin
currents, such as Rashba, quadrupolar, perpendicular, and helicity currents.
The results are compared with those obtained by the method of local coordinate
transformation.

<h3>Particle pinning as a method to manipulate marginal stability</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We study the critical behavior of low-frequency vibrations of packings with
pinned particles near the jamming point. Soft modes form a plateau in the
density of states and its frequency is controlled by the contact number as the
ordinary jamming transition. The spatial structure of these modes is not
largely affected by pins. Below the plateau, the non-Debye scaling predicted by
mean-field theories and quasi-localized modes breaks down depending on the
pinning procedures. We comprehensively explain these behaviors by the impact of
pinning operations on the marginal stability of the packings.

<i>Samy Lakhal, Laurent Ponson, Michael Benzaquen, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a powerful yet simple method that generates multifractal fields
with fully controlled scaling properties. Adopting the Multifractal Random Walk
(MRW) model of Bacry et al. (2001), synthetic multifractal fields are obtained
from the fractional integration of non-Gaussian fluctuations, built by a
non-linear transformation of log-correlated Gaussian fields. The resulting
fields are parameterized by their roughness exponent $H$, intermittency
$\lambda$ and multifractal range $\xi_\omega$. We retrieve all the salient
features of {the MRW, namely a quadratic scaling} exponent spectrum $\zeta_q$,
fat-tail statistics of fluctuations, and spatial correlations of local
volatility. {Such features can be finely tuned, allowing for the generation of
ideal multifractals mimicking real multi-affine fields.} The construction
procedure is then used the other way around to unwrap experimental data -- here
the roughness map of a fractured metallic alloy. Our {analysis evidences
subtle} differences with synthetic fields, namely anisotropic filamental
clusters reminiscent of dissipation structures found in fluid turbulence.

<h3>Flux-conserving directed percolation</h3>

<br>
<i>Barto Cucurull, Greg Huber, Kyle Kawagoe, Marc Pradas, Alain Pumir, Michael Wilkinson</i>
<br>
<br>
We discuss a model for directed percolation in which the flux of material
along each bond is a dynamical variable. The model includes a physically
significant limiting case where the total flux of material is conserved. We
show that the distribution of fluxes is asymptotic to a power law at small
fluxes. We give an implicit equation for the exponent, in terms of
probabilities characterising site occupations. In one dimension the site
occupations are exactly independent, and the model is exactly solvable. In two
dimensions, the independent-occupation assumption gives a good approximation.
We explore the relationship between this model and traditional models for
directed percolation.

Motivated by high-temperature superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we investigate the pair correlations in the two-orbital
Hubbard ladder, which consists of the nearly half-filled and nearly
quarter-filled orbitals. By employing the density matrix renormalization group
method, we demonstrate that the pair correlation exhibits a power-law decay
against the distance while the spin correlation decays exponentially. The decay
exponent of the pair correlation of the nearly half-filled orbital is
comparable to the exponent of the quasi-long-range superconducting correlation
in the doped single-orbital Hubbard ladder, which suggests the importance of
the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

<h3>Light polarons with electron-phonon coupling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01958" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01958</a>
<br>
<i>Chao Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
In most cases, as the strength of electron-phonon coupling increases, the
effective mass of polarons typically increases. However, in this paper, we
uncover a fascinating phenomenon: the presence of light polarons even within
the strong coupling regime, where electron-phonon coupling includes both
Holstein and bond types (electron-phonon coupling occurring on the hopping
bonds). To investigate this, we employ a novel Diagrammatic Monte Carlo method
based on the path-integral formulation of the particle sector and the
Fock-state representation of the phonon sector. Our study centers on analyzing
the impact of bond electron-phonon coupling on the Holstein polaron's essential
properties, including its effective mass, ground state energy, and the average
number of phonons. We examine two distinct scenarios: one where the phonon
frequency of both Holstein and bond types is the same, and another where the
phonon frequency of the Holstein type is twice as large as that of the bond
type. In both of these two cases, when the Holstein coupling falls within the
light mass regime, we observe minimal changes in the effective mass as a
function of bond coupling, compared to the case of the bare bond polaron.
However, the behavior of the effective mass undergoes a significant change in
the heavy mass regime. Most intriguingly, we discover a non-monotonic
dependence of the effective mass on the bond coupling $g_B$ when the Holstein
coupling $g_H$ falls within the heavy mass regime. This finding holds promise,
particularly in the context of bipolaron, where achieving a light effective
mass and a large binding energy to get the compact size, is crucial.

<br>
<br>
The ability to emit narrow exciton lines, preferably with a well-defined
polarization, is one of the key conditions for the use of nanostructures based
on III-VI monochalcogenides in nanophotonics and quantum technologies (for
single photon emitters). At present, the main method of their formation is the
exfoliation of layered crystals, supplemented by strain and defect engineering.
The factor limiting the use of epitaxy is the presence of different polytypes
and structural phases in the grown films. However, control over their formation
can make it possible to create structures with desired properties. In this
work, we propose a Ga$_2$Se$_3$/GaSe nanostructure fabricated by van der Waals
epitaxy with a high VI/III flux ratio as a source of strongly polarized narrow
lines of exciton emission. In fact, this nanostructure is formed from
allotropes: GaSe and Ga$_2$Se$_3$, which consist of the same atoms in different
arrangements. The energy position of the narrow lines is determined by the
quantum confinement in ultrathin Ga$_2$Se$_3$ inclusions of different sizes in
the GaSe matrix (barrier), and their linear polarization is due to the ordering
of Ga vacancies in a certain crystal direction in Ga$_2$Se$_3$. Using
transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and
micro-photoluminescence, the morphology of Ga$_2$Se$_3$/GaSe nanostructures,
the temperature and temporal behavior of the narrow lines have been
established. Our results open the way to the creation of allotropic
nanostructures capable, in particular, of providing narrow-line emission.

<h3>Triplet superconductivity in the Rashba$^4$ model</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Rashba$^4$ model is a lattice model of interacting fermions with a
tight-binding dispersion relation that exhibits four Rashba band crossing
points at the same energy. The fermions interact weakly, by an on-site
repulsion and an additional nearest-neighbour two-body interaction, which may
be attractive or repulsive. We study this model when the Fermi energy is at or
close to the band crossings, by a combination of renormalization group flow
equations and mean-field theory. We find that the scattering processes between
different Rashba points drive superconductivity of an unusual triplet type not
found in models with a single Rashba point.

<br>
<i>Francesco Lorenzi, Luca Salasnich</i>
<br>
<br>
We report systematic numerical simulations of the collision of a bright
matter-wave soliton made of Bose-condensed alkali-metal atoms through a narrow
potential barrier by using the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation. In
this way, we determine how the transmission coefficient depends on the soliton
impact velocity and the barrier height. Quite remarkably, we also obtain the
regions of parameters where there is the collapse of the bright soliton induced
by the collision. We compare these three-dimensional results with the ones
obtained by three different one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations.
We find that a specifically modified nonpolynomial Schr\"odinger equation is
able to capture all the main features of the three-dimensional findings. In
particular, this simplified but very effective one-dimensional model takes into
account the transverse width dynamics of the soliton with an ordinary
differential equation coupled to the partial differential equation of the axial
wavefunction of the Bose-Einstein condensate.

<h3>Berry's phase and quantum mechanical formulation of anomalous Hall  effect</h3>

<br>
<br>
The canonical commutation relations in quantum mechanics are not maintained
in the anomalous Hall effect described by Berry's phase in the presence of the
electromagnetic vector potential. To define quantum mechanical formulation, one
may avoid the electromagnetic vector potential but then the anomalous Nernst
effect induced by Berry's curvature is not described using a modified phase
space volume, although the anomalous Nernst effect by itself may be generated
by the adiabatic Berry's curvature. We also comment on the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation if it describes the anomalous Hall effect in the absence of the
electromagnetic vector potential in quantum mechanics. An alternative view of
the Bjorken-Johnson-Low prescription which is consistent with the principle of
quantum mechanics and the existing Berry's phase theory of the anomalous Hall
effect is also mentioned.

<br>
<br>
In this paper, polarized photoluminescence caused by exciton
quasi-equilibrium spin orientation on Zeeman sublevels in an ensemble of
quantum dots of different sizes is theoretically studied. It is found that: (i)
the splitting of the photoluminescence bands in a magnetic field in an ensemble
of quantum dots is several orders of magnitude larger than the Zeeman splitting
of exciton levels in a single dot, (ii) the sign of the circular polarization
of the photoluminescence changes along the contour of the bands, (iii) the
change of the sign of the polarization is associated with the change of the
sign of the exciton g-factor. A universal formula for the dependence of the
exciton g-factor on the quantum dot size is obtained. This dependence is valid
for both bulk material and nanostructures of different types and sizes.
Comparison of the results obtained with the experimentally measured data has
been carried out.

<h3>Magnetic phenomena in equiatomic ternary rare earth compounds</h3>

The chapter discusses the structural and magnetic properties of equiatomic
ternary RTX compounds, where R represents rare earth, T is transition metal,
and X belongs to the p block elements. RTX compounds exhibit a variety of
crystal structures, which leads to a range of magnetic phenomenon ranging from
long range antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic ordering, unconventional
superconductivity, magnetic frustration to spin ices. Coexistence of various
magnetic phenomenon result in many exotic properties, which make these
materials promising for next generation technological applications. In RTX
family of compounds, most transition metals, except manganese, Mn do not
contribute significantly to the magnetic moment and behave as non-magnetic. The
lack of magnetic behaviour in the transition metal sublattices of these ternary
compounds may be attributed to hybridization between p electron states of X
atom and d electron states of the transition metal, resulting in the filling of
the d band. The dominant interaction in these compounds is of Ruderman Kittel

earths. The magnetic transition temperature in these materials varies from
ultra-low to high temperatures, making them suitable for integration into
devices operating at room temperature. The RTX series discussed here
encompasses all rare earth elements, a range of transition metals, and various
p-block elements such as Al, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Sn, Sb, and Bi. Most of the
materials studied are arc melted polycrystalline materials with some in the

Permanent magnets are integral components in many of the modern technologies
that are critical for the transition to a sustainable society. However, most of
the high-performance (BHmax > 100 kJ/m3) permanent magnets that are currently
employed contain rare earth elements (REE), which have long been classified as
critical materials with a high supply risk and concerns regarding pollution in
their mining. Therefore, suitable REE-lean/free magnets must be developed in
order to ensure the sustainability of clean energy generation and electric
mobility. The REE-free hexagonal ferrites (or hexaferrites) are the most used
permanent magnets across all applications, with an 85 wt.% pie of the permanent
magnet market. They are the dominant lower-grade option (BHmax < 25 kJ/m3) due
to their relatively good hard magnetic properties, high Curie temperature (>700
K), low cost and good chemical stability. In recent years, the hexaferrites
have also emerged as candidates for substituting REE-based permanent magnets in
applications requiring intermediate magnetic performance (25-100 kJ/m3), due to
considerable performance improvements achieved through chemical tuning,
nanostructuring and compaction/sintering optimization. This chapter reviews the
state-of-the-art sintering strategies being investigated with the aim of
manufacturing hexaferrite magnets with optimized magnetic properties,
identifying key challenges and highlighting the natural future steps to be
followed.

<h3>Microscopic model realization of $\boldsymbol{d}$-wave pseudospin  current order in Sr$_{\boldsymbol{2}}$IrO$_{\boldsymbol{4}}$</h3>

The $d$-wave pseudospin current order ($d$PSCO) with staggered circulating
pseudospin current has been proposed as the hidden electronic order to describe
the unexpected breaking of spatial symmetries in stoichiometric
Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ and the unconventional pseudogap phenomena in electron doped
Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$. However, a microscopic model for the emergence of $d$PSCO is
still lacking. The nearest neighbor Coulomb repulsion $V$, which is expected to
be significant in Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ due to the large spatial extension of the
Ir $5d$ orbitals, is capable of driving $d$PSCO on the mean-field level, albeit
the latter is energetically degenerate to the staggered flux phase with
circulating charge current. We find the in-plane anisotropy $\Gamma_2$ in the
effective superexchange interaction between $J_\text{eff}={1\over 2}$
pseudospins, originating from the cooperative interplay between Hund's rule
coupling and spin-orbit coupling of Ir $5d$ electrons, is able to lift the
degeneracy and stabilize the pseudospin currents. The effective single-orbital
model of $J_\text{eff}={1\over 2}$ electrons, including onsite Coulomb
repulsion $U$, nearest neighbor Coulomb repulsion $V$, and the in-plane
anisotropy $\Gamma_2$, is then studied. We obtain the mean-field ground states,
analyze their properties, and determine the phase diagram of stoichiometric
Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ in the plane spanned by $U$ and $V$ at a fixed $\Gamma_2$. We
demonstrate the realization of $d$PSCO, and its competition and coexistence
with antiferromagnetism. Remarkably, we find the coexistence of $d$PSCO and
antiferromagnetism naturally leads to spin bond nematicity, with the spin
directions of these three orders forming nontrivial chirality. Furthermore, we
show that the emergence of the coexistent state and its chirality can be tuned
by carrier doping.

In this article, we explore the potential of artificial neural networks,
which are trained using an exceptionally simplified catalog of ideal
configurations encompassing both order and disorder. We explore the
generalisation power of these networks to classify phases in complex models
that are far from the simplified training context. As a paradigmatic case, we
analyse the order-disorder transition of the diluted Ising model on several
two-dimensional crystalline lattices, which does not have an exact solution and
presents challenges for most of the available analytical and numerical
techniques. Quantitative agreement is obtained in the determination of
transition temperatures and percolation densities, with comparatively much more
expensive methods. These findings highlight the potential of minimalist
training in neural networks to describe complex phenomena and have implications
beyond condensed matter physics.

Charge sensing is a sensitive technique for probing quantum devices, of
particular importance for spin qubit readout. To achieve good readout
sensitivities, the proximity of the charge sensor to the device to be measured
is a necessity. However, this proximity also means that the operation of the
device affects, in turn, the sensor tuning and ultimately the readout
sensitivity. We present an approach for compensating for this cross-talk effect
allowing for the gate voltages of the measured device to be swept in a 1 V x 1
V window while maintaining a sensor configuration chosen by a Bayesian
optimiser. Our algorithm is a key contribution to the suite of fully automated
solutions required for the operation of large quantum device architectures.

<h3>Tunneling magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions with a single  ferromagnetic electrode</h3>

Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are key components of spintronic devices,
such as magnetic random-access memories. Normally, MTJs consist of two
ferromagnetic (FM) electrodes separated by an insulating barrier layer. Their
key functional property is tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) that is a change
in MTJ's resistance when magnetization of the two electrodes alters from
parallel to antiparallel. Here, we demonstrate that TMR can occur in MTJs with
a single FM electrode, provided that the counter electrode is an
antiferromagnetic (AFM) metal that supports a spin-split band structure and/or
a N\'eel spin current. Using RuO$_{2}$ as a representative example of such
antiferromagnet and CrO$_{2}$ as a FM metal, we design all-rutile
RuO$_{2}$/TiO$_{2}$/CrO$_{2}$ MTJs to reveal a non-vanishing TMR. Our
first-principles calculations predict that magnetization reversal in CrO$_{2}$
significantly changes conductance of the MTJs stacked in the (110) or (001)
planes. The predicted giant TMR effect of about 1000% in the (110) oriented
MTJs stems from spin-dependent conduction channels in CrO$_{2}$ (110) and
RuO$_{2}$ (110), whose matching alters with CrO$_{2}$ magnetization
orientation, while TMR in the (001) oriented MTJs originates from the N\'eel
spin currents and different effective TiO$_{2}$ barrier thickness for the two
magnetic sublattices that can be engineered by the alternating deposition of
TiO$_{2}$ and CrO$_{2}$ monolayers. Our results demonstrate a possibility of a
sizable TMR in MTJs with a single FM electrode and offer a practical test for
using the altermagnet RuO$_{2}$ in functional spintronic devices.

The search for energy efficient materials is urged not only by the needs of
modern electronics but also by emerging applications in neuromorphic computing
and artificial intelligence. Currently, there exist two mechanisms for
achieving dissipationless transport: superconductivity and the quantum Hall
effect. Here we reveal that dissipationless transport is theoretically
achievable on a honeycomb lattice by rational design of chiral anomalies.
Breaking the usual assumption of commensurability leads to electronic modes
exhibiting chiral anomalies capable of dissipationless coherent transport in
the material bulk, rather than on the edge. The dissipationless transport
undergoes a pitchfork bifurcation marking the onset of a novel cubic dispersion
phase. These results open a new research avenue for the design of energy
efficient information processing and higher-order dispersion materials.

First passage times (FPTs) are often used to study timescales in physical,
chemical, and biological processes. FPTs generically describe the time it takes
a random "searcher" to find a "target." In many systems, the important
timescale is not the time it takes a single searcher to find a target, but
rather the time it takes the fastest searcher out of many searchers to find a
target. Such fastest FPTs or extreme FPTs result from many searchers competing
to find the target and differ markedly from FPTs of single searchers. In this
chapter, we review recent results on fastest FPTs. We show how fastest FPTs
depend on the mode of stochastic search (including search by diffusion,
subdiffusion, superdiffusion, and discrete jumps), the initial searcher
distribution, and properties of the spatial domain.

Nodal line semimetals feature topologically protected band crossings between
the bulk valence and conduction bands that extend along a finite dimension in
the form of a line or a loop. While ZrSiS and similar materials have attracted
extensive research as hosts for the nodal line semimetallic phase, an
alternative avenue has emerged in the form of isostructural rare-earth (RE)
based RESbTe materials. Such systems possess intriguing potentialities for
harboring elements of magnetic ordering and electronic correlations owing to
the presence of 4f electrons intrinsic to the RE elements. In this study, we
have carried out angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and
thermodynamic measurements in conjunction with first principles computations on
PrSbTe to elucidate its electronic structure and topological characteristics.
Magnetic and thermal characterizations indicate the presence of well-localized
4f states with the absence of any discernible phase transition down to 2 K. The
ARPES results reveal the presence of gapless Dirac crossings that correspond to
a nodal-line along the XR direction in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone.
Furthermore, Dirac crossing that makes up nodal line, which forms a
diamond-shaped nodal plane centered at the center of the Brillouin zone is also
identified within the experimental resolution. This study on the electronic
structure of PrSbTe contributes to the understanding of the pivotal role played
by spin-orbit coupling in the context of the RESbTe family of materials

Electrolyte design is critical for enabling next-generation batteries with
higher energy densities. Hydrofluoroether (HFE) solvents have drawn a lot of
attention as the electrolytes based on HFEs showed great promise to deliver
highly desired properties, including high oxidative stability, ionic
conductivity, as well as enhanced lithium metal compatibility. However, the
structure-dynamics-properties relationships and design principles for
high-performance HFE solvents are still poorly understood. Herein, we proposed
four novel asymmetric HFE designs by systematically varying polyether and
fluorocarbon structural building blocks. By leveraging molecular dynamics (MD)
modeling to analyze the solvation structures and predict the properties of the
corresponding 1 M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) solutions, we
downselected the most promising candidate based on high conductivity, solvation
species distribution, and oxidative stability for extensive electrochemical
characterizations. The formulated electrolyte demonstrated properties
consistent with the predictions from the simulations and showed much-improved
capacity retention as well as Coulombic efficiency compared to the baseline
electrolytes when cycled in lithium metal cells. This work exemplifies the
construction of candidate electrolytes from building block functional moieties
to engineer fundamental solvation structures for desired electrolyte properties
and guide the discovery and rational design of new solvent materials.

<h3>Electrically tuned topology and magnetism in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ at  $ν_h=1$</h3>

We present a theoretical study of an interaction-driven quantum phase diagram
of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ at hole filling factor $\nu_h=1$ as a function of
twist angle $\theta$ and layer potential difference $V_z$, where $V_z$ is
generated by an applied out-of-plane electric field. At $V_z=0$, the phase
diagram includes quantum anomalous Hall insulators in the intermediate $\theta$
regime and topologically trivial multiferroic states with coexisting
ferroelectricity and magnetism in both small and large $\theta$ regimes. There
can be two transitions from the quantum anomalous Hall insulator phase to
topologically trivial out-of-plane ferromagnetic phase, and finally to in-plane
120$^\circ$ antiferromagnetic phase as $|V_z|$ increases, or a single
transition without the intervening ferromagnetic phase. We show explicitly that
the spin vector chirality of various 120$^\circ$ antiferromagnetic states can
be electrically switched. We discuss the connection between the experimentally
measured Curie-Weiss temperature and the low-temperature magnetic order based
on an effective Heisenberg model with magnetic anisotropy.

We study the influence of spatial symmetries on the appearance and the number
of exact flat bands (FBs) in single and bilayer systems with Dirac or quadratic
band crossing points, and systematically classify all possible number of exact
flat bands in systems with different point group symmetries. We find that a
maximum of 6 FBs can be protected by symmetries, and show an example of 6 FBs
in a system with QBCP under periodic strain field of $\mathcal{C}_{6v}$ point
group symmetry. All known examples of exact FBs in single and bilayer systems
fall under this classification, including chiral twisted bilayer graphene, and
new examples of exact FBs are found. We show the construction of wavefunctions
for the highly degenerate FBs, and prove that any such set of FBs are
$\mathds{Z}_2$ nontrivial, where all WFs polarized on one sublattice together
have Chern number $C = 1$ and WFs polarized on the other sublattice together
have $C = -1$. These bands also satisfy ideal non-Abelian quantum geometry
condition. We further show that, just like in TBG, topological heavy fermion
description of the FBs with higher degeneracy is possible as long as the Berry
curvature distribution is peaked around a point in the BZ.
