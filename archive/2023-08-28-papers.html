<h3>Generalized equations of hydrodynamics in fractional derivatives</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14194" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14194</a>

We present a general approach for obtaining the generalized transport
equations with fractional derivatives using the Liouville equation with
fractional derivatives for a system of classical particles and the Zubarev
non-equilibrium statistical operator (NSO) method within the Gibbs statistics.
We obtain the non-Markov equations of hydrodynamics for the non-equilibrium
average values of densities of particle number, momentum and energy of liquid
in a spatially heterogeneous medium with a fractal structure. For isothermal
processes ($\beta=1/k_{B}T =const$), the non-Markov Navier-Stokes equation in
fractional derivatives is obtained. We consider models for the frequency
dependence of memory function (viscosity), which lead to the Navier-Stokes
equations in fractional derivatives in space and time.

<h3>Deep learning-based computational method for soft matter dynamics: Deep  Onsager-Machlup method</h3>

A deep learning-based computational method has been proposed for soft matter
dynamics -- the deep Onsager-Machlup method (DOMM), which combines the brute
forces of deep neural networks (DNNs) with the fundamental physics principle --
Onsager-Machlup variational principle (OMVP). In the DOMM, the trial solution
to the dynamics is constructed by DNNs that allow us to explore a rich and
complex set of admissible functions. It outperforms the Ritz-type variational
method where one has to impose carefully-chosen trial functions. This
capability endows the DOMM with the potential to solve rather complex problems
in soft matter dynamics that involve multiple physics with multiple slow
variables, multiple scales, and multiple dissipative processes. Actually, the
DOMM can be regarded as an extension of the deep Ritz method constructed using
variational formulations of physics models to solve static problems in physics
as discussed in our former work [Wang et al, Soft Matter, 2022, 18, 6015-6031].
In this work, as the first step, we focus on the validation of the DOMM as a
useful computational method by using it to solve several typical soft matter
dynamic problems: particle diffusion in dilute solutions, and two-phase
dynamics with and without hydrodynamics. The predicted results agree very well
with the analytical solution or numerical solution from traditional
computational methods. These results show the accuracy and convergence of DOMM
and justify it as an alternative computational method for solving soft matter
dynamics.

<h3>Time-delayed Duffing oscillator in an active bath</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13547" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13547</a>
<br>
<i>Antonio A. Valido, Mattia Coccolo, Miguel A.F. Sanju√°n</i>
<br>
<br>
During the last decades active particles have attracted an incipient
attention as they have been observed in a broad class of scenarios, ranging
from bacterial suspension in living systems to artificial swimmers in
nonequilibirum systems. The main feature of these particles is that they are
able to gain kinetic energy from the environment, which is widely modeled by a
stochastic process due to both (Gaussian) white and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noises.
In the present work, we study the nonlinear dynamics of the forced,
time-delayed Duffing oscillator subject to these noises, paying special
attention to their impact upon the maximum oscillations amplitude and
characteristic frequency of the steady state for different values of the time
delay and the driving force. Overall, our results indicate that the role of the
time delay is substantially modified with respect to the situation without
noise. For instance, we show that the oscillations amplitude grows with
increasing noise strength when the time delay acts as a damping term in absence
of noise, whereas the trajectories eventually become aperiodic when the
oscillations are sustained by the time delay. In short, the interplay among the
noises, forcing and time delay gives rise to a rich dynamics: a regular and
periodic motion is destroyed or restored owing to the competition between the
noise and the driving force depending on time delay values, whereas an erratic
motion insensitive to the driving force emerges when the time delay makes the
motion aperiodic.

<h3>Probabilistic description of dissipative chaotic scattering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13555" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13555</a>
<br>
<i>Lachlan Burton, Holger Dullin, Eduardo G. Altmann</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the extent to which the probabilistic properties of a chaotic
scattering system with dissipation can be understood from the properties of the
dissipation-free system. For large energies $E$, a fully chaotic scattering
leads to an exponential decay of the survival probability $P(t) \sim e^{-\kappa
t}$ with an escape rate $\kappa$ that decreases with $E$. Dissipation
$\gamma>0$ leads to the appearance of different finite-time regimes in $P(t)$.
We show how these different regimes can be understood for small $\gamma\ll 1$
and $t\gg 1/\kappa_0$ from the effective escape rate
$\kappa_\gamma(t)=\kappa_0(E(t))$ (including the non-hyperbolic regime) until
the energy reaches a critical value $E_c$ at which no escape is possible. More
generally, we argue that for small dissipation $\gamma$ and long times $t$ the
surviving trajectories in the dissipative system are distributed according to
the conditionally invariant measure of the conservative system at the
corresponding energy $E(t)<E(0)$. Quantitative predictions of our general
theory are compared with numerical simulations in the Henon-Heiles model.

<h3>Magnetic fluctuations in Pb$_9$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O</h3>

<br>
<br>
The hope that copper doped lead apatite Pb$_9$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O is a
room-temperature superconductor has largely been dashed by global research
efforts. Nevertheless, according to the current state of knowledge, the
material has interesting magnetic properties, and research groups around the
world have prepared high quality samples. We use a fluctuation exchange
approximation (FLEX) approach to study the magnetic tendencies in
Pb$_9$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O. We find ferromagnetic fluctuations very close to the
filling of the stoichiometric compound which can be understood from Fermi
surface nesting at the M point. This is similar to the one-band triangular
lattice Hamiltonian at three-quarter filling. Interestingly, the special kz
dependence of the Pb$_9$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O band structure makes it very sensitive
to doping. Only slight charge doping switches between antiferromagnetic and
ferromagnetic fluctuations. If the material could become superconducting, it
might be easily switchable between singlet and triplet superconductivity.

<h3>Thouless pumping in Josephson junction arrays</h3>

<i>Stavros Athanasiou, Ida E. Nielsen, Matteo M. Wauters, Michele Burrello</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent advancements in fabrication techniques have enabled unprecedented
clean interfaces and gate tunability in semiconductor-superconductor
heterostructures. Inspired by these developments, we propose protocols to
realize Thouless quantum pumping in electrically tunable Josephson junction
arrays. We analyze, in particular, the implementation of the Rice-Mele and the
Harper-Hofstadter pumping schemes, whose realization would validate these
systems as flexible platforms for quantum simulations. We investigate
numerically the long-time behavior of chains of controllable superconducting
islands in the Coulomb-blockaded regime. Our findings provide new insights into
the dynamics of periodically driven interacting systems and highlight the
robustness of Thouless pumping with respect to boundary effects typical of
superconducting circuits.

<h3>Nematic order in topological SYK models</h3>

<br>
<i>Andrew Hardy, Anjishnu Bose, Arun Paramekanti</i>
<br>
<br>
We study a class of multi-orbital models based on those proposed by
Venderbos, Hu, and Kane which exhibit an interplay of topology, interactions,
and fermion incoherence. In the non-interacting limit, these models exhibit
trivial and Chern insulator phases with Chern number $C \geq 1$ bands as
determined by the relative angular momentum of the participating orbitals.
These quantum anomalous Hall insulator phases are separated by topological
transitions protected by crystalline rotation symmetry, featuring Dirac or
quadratic band-touching points. Here we study the impact of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev
(SYK) type interactions on these lattice models. Given the random interactions,
these models display `average symmetries' upon disorder averaging, including a
charge conjugation symmetry, so they behave as interacting models in
topological class $\mathbf{D}$ enriched by crystalline rotation symmetry. The
phase diagram of this model features a non-Fermi liquid at high temperature and
an exciton condensate with nematic transport at low temperature. We present
results for the free-energy, spectral functions, and the anomalous Hall
resistivity as a function of temperature and tuning parameters. Our results are
broadly relevant to correlated topological matter in multiorbital systems, and
may also be viewed, with a suitable particle hole transformation, as an
exploration of strong interaction effects on mean-field topological
superconductors. \end{abstract}

Network science provides very powerful tools for extracting information from
interacting data. Although recently the unsupervised detection of phases of
matter using machine learning has raised significant interest, the full
prediction power of network science has not yet been systematically explored in
this context. Here we fill this gap by providing an in-depth statistical,
combinatorial, geometrical and topological characterization of 2D Ising
snapshot networks (IsingNets) extracted from Monte Carlo simulations of the 2D
Ising model at different temperatures, going across the phase transition. Our
analysis reveals the complex organization properties of IsingNets in both the
ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases and demonstrates the significant
deviations of the IsingNets with respect to randomized null models. In
particular percolation properties of the IsingNets reflect the existence of the
symmetry between configurations with opposite magnetization below the critical
temperature and the very compact nature of the two emerging giant clusters
revealed by our persistent homology analysis of the IsingNets. Moreover, the
IsingNets display a very broad degree distribution and significant
degree-degree correlations and weight-degree correlations demonstrating that
they encode relevant information present in the configuration space of the 2D
Ising model. The geometrical organization of the critical IsingNets is
reflected in their spectral properties deviating from the one of the null
model. This work reveals the important insights that network science can bring
to the characterization of phases of matter. The set of tools described hereby
can be applied as well to numerical and experimental data.

<h3>A path integral approach to sparse non-Hermitian random matrices</h3>

The theory of large random matrices has proved an invaluable tool for the
study of systems with disordered interactions in many quite disparate research
areas. Widely applicable results, such as the celebrated elliptic law for dense
random matrices, allow one to deduce the statistical properties of the
interactions in a complex dynamical system that permit stability. However, such
simple and universal results have so far proved difficult to come by in the
case of sparse random matrices. Here, we present a new approach, which maps the
hermitized resolvent of a random matrix onto the response functions of a linear
dynamical system. The response functions are then evaluated using a path
integral formalism, enabling one to construct Feynman diagrams and perform a
perturbative analysis. This approach provides simple closed-form expressions
for the eigenvalue spectrum, allowing one to derive modified versions of the
classic elliptic and semi-circle laws that take into account the sparse
correction. Additionally, in order to demonstrate the broad utility of the path
integral framework, we derive a non-Hermitian generalization of the
Marchenko-Pastur law, and we also show how one can handle non-negligible
higher-order statistics (i.e. non-Gaussian statistics) in dense ensembles.

Nanowires play a pivotal role across a spectrum of disciplines such as
nanoelectromechanical systems, nanoelectronics, and energy applications. As
nanowires continue to diminish in dimensions, their mechanical characteristics
are increasingly influenced by surface attributes. This research delves into
the elastic properties of silicon nanowires, which vary in dimensions and
crystal orientations, employing diverse nanomechanical models. Through
molecular dynamics simulations and the application of five models namely,
Heidelberg, Hudson, Zhan, SimpZP, and ExtZP, the analysis of force-deflection
responses reveals the intricate interplay among elastic properties, crystal
orientation, and the chosen model. To accurately account for unreconstructed
states, surface properties are examined for different silicon surface
orientations. Each crystal orientation exhibits distinct trends, with surface
properties showing a substantial influence on estimated elasticity. A thorough
grasp of surface effects and anisotropic properties is crucial for unraveling
nanowire mechanics. This study drives both the understanding of size-dependent
behaviors and the enhancement of insights into nanoscale surface
characteristics of silicon nanowires.

<h3>Tuning the Curie temperature of a 2D magnet/topological insulator  heterostructure to above room temperature by epitaxial growth</h3>

<br>
<br>
Heterostructures of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets and
topological insulators (TI) are of substantial interest as candidate materials
for efficient spin-torque switching, quantum anomalous Hall effect, and chiral
spin textures. However, since many of the vdW magnets have Curie temperatures
below room temperature, we want to understand how materials can be modified to
stabilize their magnetic ordering to higher temperatures. In this work, we
utilize molecular beam epitaxy to systematically tune the Curie temperature
($T_C$) in thin film Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/Bi$_2$Te$_3$ from bulk-like values
($\sim$220 K) to above room temperature by increasing the growth temperature
from 300 $^\circ$C to 375 $^\circ$C. For samples grown at 375 $^\circ$C,
cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) reveals the
spontaneous formation of different Fe$_m$Ge$_n$Te$_2$ compositions (e.g.
Fe$_5$Ge$_2$Te$_2$ and Fe$_7$Ge$_6$Te$_2$) as well as intercalation in the vdW
gaps, which are possible origins of the enhanced Curie temperature. This
observation paves the way for developing various Fe$_m$Ge$_n$Te$_2$/TI
heterostructures with novel properties.

<h3>Helical magnetic state in the vicinity of the pressure-induced  superconducting phase in MnP</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13634" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13634</a>

<br>
<br>
MnP is a metal that shows successive magnetic transitions from paramagnetic
to ferromagnetic and helical magnetic phases at ambient pressure with
decreasing temperature. With applied pressure, the magnetic transition
temperatures decrease and superconductivity appears around 8 GPa where the
magnetic order is fully suppressed and the quantum critical behavior is
observed. These results suggest that MnP is an unconventional superconductor in
which magnetic fluctuations may be relevant to the superconducting pairing
mechanism. In order to elucidate the magnetic ground state adjacent to the
superconducting phase first discovered in Mn-based materials, high-pressure
neutron diffraction measurements have been performed in hydrostatic pressure up
to 7.5 GPa. The helical magnetic structure with the propagation vector along
the $b$ axis, reported previously at 3.8 GPa, was found to be robust up to 7.5
GPa. First principles and classical Monte Carlo calculations have also been
performed to understand how the pressure-driven magnetic phase transitions are
coupled with change of the exchange interactions. The calculations, which
qualitatively reproduce the magnetic structures as a function of pressure,
suggest that the exchange interactions change drastically with applied pressure
and the further-neighbor interactions become more influential at high
pressures. Combining the experimental and theoretical results, we describe the
detail of exchange interactions in the vicinity of the superconducting phase
which is critical to understand the pairing mechanism of the unconventional
superconductivity in MnP.

<h3>Non-parametric learning critical behavior in Ising partition functions:  PCA entropy and intrinsic dimension</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13636" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13636</a>
<br>
<i>Rajat K. Panda, Roberto Verdel, Alex Rodriguez, Hanlin Sun, Ginestra Bianconi, Marcello Dalmonte</i>
<br>
<br>
We provide and critically analyze a framework to learn critical behavior in
classical partition functions through the application of non-parametric methods
to data sets of thermal configurations. We illustrate our approach in phase
transitions in 2D and 3D Ising models. First, we extend previous studies on the
intrinsic dimension of 2D partition function data sets, by exploring the effect
of volume in 3D Ising data. We find that as opposed to 2D systems for which
this quantity has been successfully used in unsupervised characterizations of
critical phenomena, in the 3D case its estimation is far more challenging. To
circumvent this limitation, we then use the principal component analysis (PCA)
entropy, a ``Shannon entropy'' of the normalized spectrum of the covariance
matrix. We find a striking qualitative similarity to the thermodynamic entropy,
which the PCA entropy approaches asymptotically. The latter allows us to
extract -- through a conventional finite-size scaling analysis with modest
lattice sizes -- the critical temperature with less than $1\%$ error for both
2D and 3D models while being computationally efficient. The PCA entropy can
readily be applied to characterize correlations and critical phenomena in a
huge variety of many-body problems and suggests a (direct) link between
easy-to-compute quantities and entropies.

<h3>Deformation Decomposition versus Energy Decomposition for Chemo- and  Poro- Mechanics</h3>

<br>
<br>
We briefly compare the structure of two classes of popular models used to
describe poro- and chemo- mechanics wherein a fluid phase is transported within
a solid phase. The multiplicative deformation decomposition has been
successfully used to model permanent inelastic shape change in plasticity,
solid-solid phase transformation, and thermal expansion, which has motivated
its application to poro- and chemo- mechanics. However, the energetic
decomposition provides a more transparent structure and advantages, such as to
couple to phase-field fracture, for models of poro- and chemo- mechanics.

<h3>On the combinatorics of Lotka-Volterra equations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13653" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13653</a>
<br>
<i>Francesco Caravelli, Yen Ting Lin</i>
<br>
<br>
We study an approach to obtaining the exact formal solution of the 2-species
Lotka-Volterra equation based on combinatorics and generating functions. By
employing a combination of Carleman linearization and Mori-Zwanzig reduction
techniques, we transform the nonlinear equations into a linear system, allowing
for the derivation of a formal solution. The Mori-Zwanzig reduction reduces to
an expansion which we show can be interpreted as a directed and weighted
lattice path walk, which we use to obtain a representation of the system
dynamics as walks of fixed length. The exact solution is then shown to be
dependent on the generator of weighted walks. We show that the generator can be
obtained by the solution of PDE which in turn is equivalent to a particular
Koopman evolution of nonlinear observables.

<h3>Interacting Two-Level Systems as a Source of 1/f Noise in Silicon  Quantum Dot Qubits</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13674" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13674</a>
<br>
<i>D. L. Mickelsen, Herve M. Carruzzo, Clare C. Yu</i>
<br>
<br>
Charge noise in silicon quantum dots has been observed to have a 1/f
spectrum. We propose a model in which a pair of quantum dots are coupled to a
2D bath of fluctuating two level systems (TLS) that have electric dipole
moments and that interact with each other, i.e., with the other fluctuators.
These interactions are primarily via the elastic strain field. We use a 2D
nearest-neighbor Ising spin glass to represent these elastic interactions and
to simulate the dynamics of the bath of electric dipole fluctuators in the
presence of a ground plane representing metal gates above the oxide layer
containing the fluctuators. The interactions between the TLS cause the energy
splitting of individual fluctuators to change with time. We calculate the
resulting fluctuations in the electric potential at the two quantum dots that
lie below the oxide layer. We find that 1/f electric potential noise spectra at
the quantum dots and cross correlation in the noise between the two quantum
dots are in qualitative agreement with experiment. Our simulations find that
the cross correlations decrease exponentially with increasing quantum dot
separation.

The perovskite BaBiO$_3$ crystallizes in a cubic structure and undergoes
structural transitions toward lower symmetry phases upon cooling. The two
low-temperature monoclinic phases are insulating, and the origin of this
unexpected non-metallic character has been under debate. Both monoclinic phases
exhibit tilting and breathing distortions, which are connected with the
insulating nature of this compound and may have important effects on phononic
heat conductivity. Here, we report the first thermal conductivity measurement,
$\kappa$(T), in pristine polycrystalline BaBiO$_3$ from 1.5 K to 310 K. At low
and intermediate temperatures, we observe features reminiscent of a glass-like
behavior, whereas at high-temperatures we find a downturn - typical of a
crystalline solid. We compare our findings with available data of other
recently investigated perovskite oxides displaying similar temperature
dependence.

We establish a general Langevin Dynamics model of interacting, single-domain
magnetic nanoparticles in liquid suspension at finite temperature. The model
couples the LLG equation for the moment dynamics with the mechanical rotation
and translation of the particles. Within this model, we derive expressions for
the instantaneous transfer of energy, linear and angular momentum between the
particles and with the environment. We demonstrate by numerical tests that all
conserved quantities are fully accounted for, thus validating the model and the
transfer expressions. The energy transfer expressions derived here are also
useful analysis tools to decompose the instantaneous, non-equilibrium power
loss at each MNP into different loss channels. To demonstrate the model
capabilities, we analyse simulations of MNP collisions and high-frequency
hysteresis in terms of power and energy contributions.

The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled a comprehensive
exploration of materials for various applications. However, AI models often
prioritize frequently encountered materials in the scientific literature,
limiting the selection of suitable candidates based on inherent physical and
chemical properties. To address this imbalance, we have generated a dataset of
1,494,017 natural language-material paragraphs based on combined OQMD,
Materials Project, JARVIS, COD and AFLOW2 databases, which are dominated by ab
initio calculations and tend to be much more evenly distributed on the periodic
table. The generated text narratives were then polled and scored by both human
experts and ChatGPT-4, based on three rubrics: technical accuracy, language and
structure, and relevance and depth of content, showing similar scores but with
human-scored depth of content being the most lagging. The merger of
multi-modality data sources and large language model (LLM) holds immense
potential for AI frameworks to help the exploration and discovery of
solid-state materials for specific applications.

Spin Hall effect plays a critical role in spintronics since it can convert
charge current to spin current. Using state-of-the-art ab initio calculations
including quadrupole and spin-orbit coupling, the charge and spin transports
have been investigated in pristine and doped two-dimensional III-V
semiconductors. Valence bands induce a strong scattering which limits charge
conductivity in the hole-doped system, where spin Hall conductivity is enhanced
by the spin-orbit splitting, yielding an ultrahigh spin Hall ratio
$\xi\approx0.9$ in GaAs monolayer at room temperature.

The material dependence of phonon-polariton based in-plane thermal
conductance is investigated by examining systems composed of air and several
wurtzite and zinc-blende crystals. Phonon-polariton based thermal conductance
varies by over an order of magnitude ($\sim 0.5-60$ nW/K), which is similar to
the variation observed in the materials corresponding bulk thermal
conductivity. Regardless of material, phonon-polaritons exhibit similar thermal
conductance to that of phonons when layers become ultrathin (< 100 nm)
suggesting the generality of the effect at these length-scales. A figure of
merit is proposed to explain the large variation of in-plane polariton thermal
conductance that is composed entirely of easily predicted and measured optical
phonon energies and lifetimes. Using this figure of merit, in-plane
phonon-polariton thermal conductance enlarges with increases in: (1) optical
phonon energies, (2) splitting between transverse and longitudinal mode pairs,
and (3) phonon lifetimes.

The possibility to directly measure, in a cold-atom quantum simulator, the
entanglement and mutual information between a site and its environment opens
new perspectives on the characterization of the Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator
transition, in the framework of quantum information theory. In this work we
provide an alternative view of the Mott transition in the two-dimensional
Hubbard model in terms of suitably defined quasilocal measures of entanglement
and correlation between two spatially separated electronic orbitals, with no
contribution from their environment.
A space-resolved analysis of Cluster Dynamical Mean-Field Theory results
elucidates the prominent role of the nearest-neighbor entanglement in probing
Mott localization: both its lower and upper bounds sharply increase at the
metal-insulator transition. The two-site entanglement beyond nearest neighbors
is shown to be quickly damped as the inter-site distance is increased.
These results ultimately resolve a conundrum of previous analyses based on
the single-site entanglement, which has been found to monotonically decrease
when the interaction is increased. The quasilocal two-site entanglement
recovers instead the distinctive character of Mott insulators as strongly
correlated quantum states, demonstrating the central role of this marker in the
two-dimensional Hubbard model.

<h3>Entropic Timescales of Dynamic Heterogeneity in Supercooled Liquid</h3>

Non-Gaussian displacement distributions are universal predictors of dynamic
heterogeneity in slowly varying environments. Here, we explore heterogeneous
dynamics in supercooled liquid using molecular dynamics simulations and show
the efficiency of the information-theoretic measure in quantifying dynamic
heterogeneity over the widely used moment-based quantifications of
nonGaussianity. Our analysis shows that the heterogeneity quantified by the
negentropy is significantly different from the one obtained using the
conventional approach that considers deviation from Gaussianity up to
lower-order moments. Further, we extract the timescales of dynamic
heterogeneity using the two methods and show that the differential changes
diverge as the system experiences strong intermittency near the glass
transition.

<br>
<br>
New highly oxygen-active materials may enhance many energy-related
technologies by enabling efficient oxygen-ion transport at lower temperatures,
e.g., below 400 Celsius. Interstitial oxygen conductors have the potential to
realize such performance but have received far less attention than
vacancy-mediated conductors. Here, we combine physically-motivated structure
and property descriptors, ab initio simulations, and experiments to demonstrate
an approach to discover new fast interstitial oxygen conductors. Multiple new
families were found which adopt completely different structures from known
oxygen conductors. From these families, we synthesized and studied oxygen
kinetics in La4Mn5Si4O22+d (LMS), a representative member of
perrierite/chevkinite family. We found LMS has higher oxygen ionic conductivity
than the widely used yttria-stabilized ZrO2, and among the highest surface
oxygen exchange rates at intermediate temperature of known materials. The fast
oxygen kinetics is the result of simultaneously active interstitial and
interstitialcy diffusion pathways. This work developed and demonstrated a
powerful approach for discovering new families of interstitial oxygen
conductors and suggests many more such materials remain to be discovered.

<h3>Fluctuation relation in continuous-time random walks driven by an  external field</h3>

<i>Kazuhiko Seki</i>
<br>
<br>
We study a fluctuation relation representing a nonequilibrium equality
indicating that the ratio between the distribution of trajectories obtained by
exchanging the initial and final positions is characterized by free energy
differences for the duration of the trajectories.We use a continuous-time
lattice random walk model under a general waiting-time distribution of
transitions to consider the fluctuation relation for noninteracting charge
carriers driven by an external electric field. The fluctuation relation is
obtained irrespective of the lattice structure factor, the form of the
waiting-time distribution, and the presence of a reflecting boundary. In free
space without boundary conditions, exchanging the initial and final positions
is equivalent to exchanging the field (or drift) directions. However, we show
that the exchanging field (or drift) directions are not relevant for studying
the fluctuation relation under the reflecting boundary condition. Because the
fluctuation relation should hold for continuous-time random walk models, it can
be used to ensure internal consistency in theoretical modeling.

<h3>In situ observation of chemistry in Rydberg molecules within a coherent  solvent</h3>

<br>

We often infer the state of systems in nature indirectly, for example in high
energy physics by recording the tracks particles leave behind in an ambient
medium. We adapt this principle to energies $9$ orders of magnitude smaller, to
classify the final state of exotic molecules after internal conversion of their
electronic state, through their interaction with an ambient quantum fluid,
a~Bose-Einstein condensate. The BEC is the ground-state of a million bosonic
atoms near zero temperature, and a single embedded ultra-long range Rydberg
molecule can coherently excite waves in this fluid, which carry tell-tale
signatures of its dynamics. Bond lengths exceeding a micrometer allow us to
observe the molecular fingerprint on the BEC in situ, via optical microscopy.
Interpreting images in comparison with simulations shows that the molecular
electronic state rapidly converts from the initially excited S- and D-orbitals
to a much more complex molecular state (called ``trilobite''), marked by a
maximally localized electron. This internal conversion liberates energy, such
that one expects final state particles to move rapidly through the medium,
which is however ruled out by comparing experiment and simulations. The
molecule thus must strongly decelerate in the medium, for which we propose a
plausible mechanism. Our experiment demonstrates a coherent medium that
facilitates and records an electronic state change of embedded exotic molecules
in ultra-cold chemistry, with sufficient sensitivity to constrain velocities of
final state particles.

<h3>Driving Mechanism and Dynamic Fluctuations of Charge Density Waves in  the Kagome Metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13796" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13796</a>

<br>
<br>
In a new family of V-based kagome metals RV$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = Sc, Y, La), only
ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ was observed to exhibit the unusual charge density wave (CDW)
with a $\sqrt{3}{\times}\sqrt{3}$ in-plane ordering and a tripling of the unit
cell along the $c$-axis. However, the driving mechanism of such a
$\sqrt{3}{\times}\sqrt{3}{\times}$3 CDW order is elusive. Here, using
first-principles density-functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that
the $\sqrt{3}{\times}\sqrt{3}{\times}$2 or $\sqrt{3}{\times}\sqrt{3}{\times}$3
CDW order is driven by a Jahn-Teller-like effect where the interlayer
dimerization of Sn atoms in kagome bilayers is accompanied by a charge
redistribution between such Sn atoms and its associated gap opening. It is
revealed that the free energy of the $\sqrt{3}{\times}\sqrt{3}{\times}$3 phase
becomes lower than that of the $\sqrt{3}{\times}\sqrt{3}{\times}$2 phase above
$T_{\rm CDW}$ mostly due to the emergence of a large configurational entropy.
Such a high-entropy phase shows dynamic fluctuations between its degenerate
configurations but, as the temperature lowers below $T_{\rm CDW}$, it can be
kinetically trapped to release a sizable entropy. Our findings not only
identify the driving mechanism and order-disorder transition of the CDW in
ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ but also provide an ideal platform for investigating strong CDW
fluctuations in V-based kagome metals.

<br>
<br>
The effect of composition on microstructure both at the length scale of the
secondary dendrite arm spacing and nano-sized dispersoids during homogenization
of Al-Zn-Cu-Mg-Zr alloys has been studied. A comprehensive model that can
predict the microstructure at both the length scales has been used for the
study. The microstructure predicted has been compared to that for two
homogenized samples from a directionally solidified AA7050 sample and a
reasonable match has been found. The initial as-cast microstructure for
different compositions is calculated using Scheil type solidification from
Thermo-Calc. The initial microstructure has a considerable influence on
microstructural evolution during homogenization. To take advantage of the
decreased solid solubility of Zr in {\alpha}-fcc, cooling rates during
solidification must be high enough to prevent precipitation of primary Al3Zr.
Under solidification with industrial cooling conditions solute rich alloys
leads to fewer dispersoids. Based on the study, an improved composition range
of 6-8%Zn, 1-2%Cu, 1-2%Mg and 0.1-0.15%Zr for 7XXX alloys has been proposed.

Defects in graphene are both a boon and a bane for device application - they
can induce uncontrollable effects but can also provide novel ways to manipulate
the properties of pristine graphene. For this report, we investigated graphene
with no defect, one and two mono-vacancies, and two di-vancancies using a
Molecular Dynamics procedure optimized for the purpose. The defects that are
deemed to be energetically stable are identified and their formation mechanisms
proposed. We also investigated interaction between two Stone-Wales 55-77
defects, and the formation energies of their linearly extended structures,
along the zigzag and armchair direction, and when they are placed in different
relative orientations.

Magnetic chains on superconductors hosting Majorna Zero Modes (MZMs)
attracted high interest due to their possible applications in fault-tolerant
quantum computing. However, this is hindered by the lack of a detailed,
quantitative understanding of these systems. As a significant step forward, we
present a first-principles computational approach based on a microscopic
relativistic theory of inhomogeneous superconductors applied to an iron chain
on the top of Au-covered Nb(110) to study the Shiba band structure and the
topological nature of the edge states. Contrary to contemporary considerations,
our method enables the introduction of quantities indicating band inversion
without fitting parameters in realistic experimental settings, holding thus the
power to determine the topological nature of zero energy edge states in an
accurate ab-initio based description of the experimental systems. We confirm
that ferromagnetic Fe chains on Au/Nb(110) surface do not support any separated
MZM; however, a broad range of spin-spirals can be identified with robust zero
energy edge states displaying signatures of MZMs. For these spirals, we explore
the structure of the superconducting order parameter shedding light on the
internally antisymmetric triplet pairing hosted by MZMs. We also reveal a
two-fold effect of spin-orbit coupling: although it tends to enlarge the
topological phase regarding spin spiraling angles, however, it also extends the
localization of MZMs. Due to the presented predictive power, our work fills a
big gap between the experimental efforts and theoretical models while paving
the way for engineering platforms for topological quantum computation.

The interplay among symmetry of lattices, electronic correlations, and Berry
phase of the Bloch states in solids has led to fascinating quantum phases of
matter. A prototypical system is the magnetic Weyl candidate SrRuO3, where
designing and creating electronic and topological properties on artificial
lattice geometry is highly demanded yet remains elusive. Here, we establish an
emergent trigonal structure of SrRuO3 by means of heteroepitaxial strain
engineering along the [111] crystallographic axis. Distinctive from bulk, the
trigonal SrRuO3 exhibits a peculiar XY-type ferromagnetic ground state, with
the coexistence of high-mobility holes likely from linear Weyl bands and
low-mobility electrons from normal quadratic bands as carriers. The presence of
Weyl nodes are further corroborated by capturing intrinsic anomalous Hall
effect, acting as momentum-space sources of Berry curvatures. The experimental
observations are consistent with our first-principles calculations, shedding
light on the detailed band topology of trigonal SrRuO3 with multiple pairs of
Weyl nodes near the Fermi level. Our findings signify the essence of magnetism
and Berry phase manipulation via lattice design and pave the way towards
unveiling nontrivial correlated topological phenomena.

Recent advances in electron spin resonance techniques have allowed the
manipulation of the spin of individual atoms, making magnetic atomic chains on
superconducting hosts one of the most promising platform where topological
superconductivity can be engineered. Motivated by this progress, we provide a
detailed, quantitative description of the effects of manipulating spins in
realistic nanowires by applying a first-principles-based computational approach
to a recent experiment: an iron chain deposited on top of Au/Nb
heterostructure. As a continuation of the first part of the paper
experimentally relevant computational experiments are performed in spin spiral
chains that shed light on several concerns about practical applications and add
new aspects to the interpretation of recent experiments. We explore the
stability of topological zero energy states, the formation and distinction of
topologically trivial and non-trivial zero energy edge states, the effect of
local changes in the exchange fields, the emergence of topological
fragmentation, and the shift of Majorana Zero Modes along the superconducting
nanowires opening avenues toward the implementation of a braiding operation.

<h3>Quantum Diffusion Induced by Small Quantum Chaos</h3>

<br>
<br>
It is demonstrated that quantum systems classically exhibiting strong and
homogeneous chaos in a bounded region of the phase space can induce a global
quantum diffusion. As an ideal model system, a small quantum chaos with finite
Hilbert space dimension $N$ weakly coupled with $M$ additional degrees of
freedom which is approximated by linear systems is proposed. By twinning the
system, the diffusion process in the additional modes can be numerically
investigated without taking the unbounded diffusion space into account
explicitly. Even though $N$ is not very large, diffusion occurs in the
additional modes as the coupling strength increases if $M \geq 3$. If $N$ is
large enough, a definite quantum transition to diffusion takes place through a
critical sub-diffusion characterized by an anomalous diffusion exponent.

Understanding the collective behavior of the quasiparticles in solid-state
systems underpins the field of non-volatile electronics, including the
opportunity to control many-body effects for well-desired physical phenomena
and their applications. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a wide energy bandgap
semiconductor, showing immense potential as a platform for low-dimensional
device heterostructures. It is an inert dielectric used for gated devices,
having a negligible orbital hybridization when placed in contact with other
systems. Despite its inertness, we discover a large electron mass enhancement
in few-layer hBN affecting the lifetime of the $\pi$-band states. We show that
the renormalization is phonon-mediated and consistent with both single- and
multiple-phonon scattering events. Our findings thus unveil a so-far unknown
many-body state in a wide-bandgap insulator, having important implications for
devices using hBN as one of their building blocks.

<br>
<br>
A key phenomenon that enables nanoscale spintronic devices is the efficient
inter-conversion between spin and charge degrees of freedom. Here, we
experimentally demonstrate a pathway to generate current-induced spin
polarization at the interface between an insulating ferromagnet and a
non-magnetic metal using interfacial exchange-field spin filtering. Measuring
current-in-plane giant magnetoresistance in Py$|$Cu$|$EuS trilayer Hall cross
devices, we induce a non-equilibrium spin polarization of
$P_\text{neq}^\text{Cu|EuS}$=0.6% at a low charge current density of
1.88$\times$10$^3$ A/cm$^2$. This efficiency is comparable to that of
conventional charge-to-spin conversion of spin-Hall or Rashba-Edelstein effects
enabled by relativistic spin-orbit coupling. Interfacial exchange field
filtering allows operation with largely reduced power consumption and magnetic
reconfigurability, opening new pathways to nanoscale low-power insulator
spintronics.

By means of Brownian dynamics simulations we study the steady-state dynamic

results show that the effective diffusion constant of the polymer $D_{\rm eff}$
gets significantly enhanced as activity increases, much like in active
particles. The simulation data are in agreement with a theoretically
constructed Rouse model of active polymer, demonstrating that irrespective of
the strength of activity, the long-time dynamics of the polymer chain is
characterized by a universal Rouse-like scaling $D_{\rm eff} \sim N^{-1}$,

The impact of thermally activated electrons on superconductivity within the

<h3>Exact current blockade maps of dsDNA bound motifs driven through a  solitary nanopore using electrokinetic Brownian dynamics</h3>

<i>Swarnadeep Seth, Aniket Bhattacharya</i>
<br>
<br>
We report current blockade (CB) characteristics of molecular motifs residing
on a model dsDNA using electrokinetic Brownian dynamics (EKBD) and study the
role of the valence of the counterions as the dsDNA translocates through a
solitary nanopore (NP) driven by an electric field. We explicitly incorporate
all the charges on the DNA backbone, co- and counter-ions, and investigate CB
characteristics of two charged sidechain motifs exactly. Our simulation brings
out the details of binding and unbinding of the counter-ions and the time
dependent counter-ion condensation on the translocating DNA for mono- and
di-valent salt conditions. An important and less intuitive finding is that the
drop in the conventional (positive) current through the pore is due to the
condensation of the counter-ions on the translocating DNA and not so much due
to drop in the co-ions passing through the pore. This finding aligns with
previous studies conducted by Tanaka et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 148103
(2005)], Cui [J. Phys. Chem B 114, 2015 (2010)], and Holm et al. [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 112, 018101 (2014)]. We further find that this condensation is larger for
the divalent ions leading to a slowing down of the translocation speed and
yielding a longer dwell time for the motifs. Finally, we use the exact CB
characteristics from the EKBD simulation to reconstruct the same CB
characteristics using a volumetric ansatz on the segment inside and in the
vicinity of the pore using on the ordinary BD model without the explicit
presence of co- and counter-ions. Refinement of this ansatz will allow us to
obtain the CB characteristics for longer genome fragments using low-cost
ordinary BD simulation.

<br>
<br>
The pursuit of room-temperature ambient-pressure superconductivity in novel
materials has sparked interest, with recent reports suggesting such properties
in Cu-substituted lead apatite, known as LK-99. However, these claims lack
comprehensive experimental and theoretical support. In this study, we address
this gap by conducting ab initio calculations to explore the impact of varying
doping concentrations (x = 0, 1, 2) on the stability and electronic properties
of five compounds in the LK-99 family. Our investigations unveil a distinct
feature within LK-99: isolated flat bands that intersect the Fermi level. In
contrast, the other four compounds exhibit insulating behavior with wide band
gaps. X-ray diffraction analyses confirm the presence of Cu substitution on
Pb(1) sites in the originally synthesized LK-99 sample, while an extra peak
suggests potential alternative phases like Pb$_8$Cu$_2$(PO$_4$)$_6$ due to
compositional variations. Furthermore, the LK-99 structure undergoes
substantial lattice constriction, resulting in a significant 5.5% reduction in
volume. Meanwhile, energy calculations reveal a marginal energy preference for
substituting Cu on Pb(2) sites over Pb(1) sites, with a difference of
approximately 0.010 eV per atom (roughly 1 kJ/mol). Intriguingly, at pressures
exceeding 73 GPa, stability shifts towards LK-99 containing Cu substitutions on
Pb(1) sites. Despite exhibiting higher electronic conductivity than parent
compounds, LK-99 falls short of the conductivity levels observed in metals or
advanced oxide conductors.

The compounds $Ln$AuAl$_4$Ge$_2$ ($Ln$ $=$ lanthanide) form in a structure
that features two-dimensional triangular lattices of $Ln$ ions that are stacked
along the crystalline $c$ axis. Together with crystal electric field effects,
magnetic anisotropy, and electron mediated spin exchange interactions, this
sets the stage for the emergence of strongly correlated spin and electron
phenomena. Here we investigate SmAuAl$_4$Ge$_2$, which exhibits weak
paramagnetism that strongly deviates from conventional Curie-Weiss behavior.
Complex antiferromagnetic ordering emerges at $T_{\rm{N1}}$ $=$ 13.2 K and
$T_{\rm{N2}}$ $=$ 7.4 K, where heat capacity measurements show that these
transitions are first and second order, respectively. These measurements also
reveal that the Sommerfeld coefficient is not enhanced compared to the
nonmagnetic analog YAuAl$_4$Ge$_2$, consistent with the charge carrier
quasiparticles exhibiting typical Fermi liquid behavior. The temperature
dependent electrical resistivity follows standard metallic behavior, but
anomalous linear magnetoresistance unexpectedly appears within the ordered
state. We compare these results to other $Ln$AuAl$_4$Ge$_2$ materials, which
have already been established as localized $f$-electron magnets that are hosts
for interesting magnetic and electronic phases. From this, SmAuAl$_4$Ge$_2$
emerges as a complex quantum spin metal, inviting further investigations into
its properties and the broader family of related materials.

We investigate the superfluid fraction of crystalline stationary states
within the framework of mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii theory. Our primary focus
is on a two-dimensional system with a non-local soft-core interaction, where
the superfluid fraction is described by a rank-2 tensor. We analyze and
establish connections between methods for calculating the superfluid tensor
derived from analysis of the nonclassical translational inertia and the
effective mass. We then apply these methods for crystalline states exhibiting
triangular, square, and stripe geometries across a broad range of interaction
parameters. Factors leading to an anisotropic superfluid fraction tensor are
also considered. We also refine the Leggett bounds for the superfluid fraction
to an accurate approach that involves a calculation using the density profile
over a single unit cell. We systematically compare these bounds to our full
numerical results, and other results in the literature. This work is of direct
relevance to other supersolid systems of current interest, such as supersolids
produced using dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates.

Next-generation touch panels are poised to benefit from the use of
stretchable and transparent soft ionic conductors, but these materials face
several challenges in practical application, including structural damage, loss
of functionality, and device stratification, particularly in extreme
environments. To address these challenges, in this work, a biocompatible,
transparent, self-adhesive gelatin-PAA-based organic hydrogel (PC-OH) was
developed, the gel can adhere to the skin in both air and underwater conditions
and also anti-freezing, anti-drying, fast self-healable (with a self-healing
time of less than 4s in air and underwater), long-term stable for up to 7 days
at a wide range of temperatures, highly stretchable, and conductive over a wide
temperature range. Using this organic hydrogel, an organic hydrogel-based
surface capacitive touch system has been developed that can detect finger touch
position in wet environments and over a wide temperature range, demonstrating
its ability to sense finger touch position. The wearable touch panel has been
successfully demonstrated through the ability to write text, draw figures, and
play electronic games, showcasing its potential use in various applications.
This breakthrough has significant implications for the development of
next-generation touch panels, particularly in the healthcare, sports, and
entertainment industries, where reliable and versatile human-machine interfaces
are essential.

<br>
Electron states with the spin-momentum-locked Dirac dispersion at the surface
of a three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator are known to lead to weak
antilocalization (WAL), i.e. low temperature and low-magnetic field quantum
interference-induced positive magnetoresistance (MR). In this work we report on
the MR measurements in (Bi,Sb)$_2$(Te,Se)$_3$ 3D topological insulator thin
films epitaxially grown on Si(111), demonstrating an anomalous WAL amplitude.
This anomalously high amplitude of WAL can not be explained by parabolic or
linear MR and indicates the existence of an additional, MR mechanism. Another
supporting observation is not linear in the classically weak magnetic field
Hall effect in the same films. The increase of the low-field Hall coefficient,
with respect to the higher-field value, reaches 10$\%$. We consistently explain
both transport features within a two-liquid model, where the mobility of one of
the components drops strongly in a weak magnetic field. We argue that this
dependence may arise from the Zeeman field induced gap opening mechanism.

<h3>Multi-plane denoising diffusion-based dimensionality expansion for  2D-to-3D reconstruction of microstructures with harmonized sampling</h3>

Acquiring reliable microstructure datasets is a pivotal step toward the
systematic design of materials with the aid of integrated computational
materials engineering (ICME) approaches. However, obtaining three-dimensional
(3D) microstructure datasets is often challenging due to high experimental
costs or technical limitations, while acquiring two-dimensional (2D)
micrographs is comparatively easier. To deal with this issue, this study
proposes a novel framework for 2D-to-3D reconstruction of microstructures
called Micro3Diff using diffusion-based generative models (DGMs). Specifically,
this approach solely requires pre-trained DGMs for the generation of 2D
samples, and dimensionality expansion (2D-to-3D) takes place only during the
generation process (i.e., reverse diffusion process). The proposed framework
incorporates a new concept referred to as multi-plane denoising diffusion,
which transforms noisy samples (i.e., latent variables) from different planes
into the data structure while maintaining spatial connectivity in 3D space.
Furthermore, a harmonized sampling process is developed to address possible
deviations from the reverse Markov chain of DGMs during the dimensionality
expansion. Combined, we demonstrate the feasibility of Micro3Diff in
reconstructing 3D samples with connected slices that maintain morphologically
equivalence to the original 2D images. To validate the performance of
Micro3Diff, various types of microstructures (synthetic and experimentally
observed) are reconstructed, and the quality of the generated samples is
assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The successful reconstruction
outcomes inspire the potential utilization of Micro3Diff in upcoming ICME
applications while achieving a breakthrough in comprehending and manipulating
the latent space of DGMs.

<h3>Tight-binding model subject to conditional resets at random times</h3>

We investigate the dynamics of a quantum system subjected to a time-dependent
and conditional resetting protocol. Namely, we ask: what happens when the
unitary evolution of the system is repeatedly interrupted at random time
instants with an instantaneous reset to a specified set of reset configurations
taking place with a probability that depends on the current configuration of
the system at the instant of reset? Analyzing the protocol in the framework of
the so-called tight-binding model describing the hopping of a quantum particle
to nearest-neighbour sites in a one-dimensional open lattice, we obtain
analytical results for the probability of finding the particle on the different
sites of the lattice. We explore a variety of dynamical scenarios, including
the one in which the resetting time intervals are sampled from an exponential
as well as from a power-law distribution, and a set-up that includes a
Floquet-type Hamiltonian involving an external periodic forcing. Under
exponential resetting, and in both presence and absence of the external
forcing, the system relaxes to a stationary state characterized by localization
of the particle around the reset sites. The choice of the reset sites plays a
defining role in dictating the relative probability of finding the particle at
the reset sites as well as in determining the overall spatial profile of the
site-occupation probability. Indeed, a simple choice can be engineered that
makes the spatial profile highly asymmetric even when the bare dynamics does
not involve the effect of any bias. Furthermore, analyzing the case of
power-law resetting serves to demonstrate that the attainment of the stationary
state in this quantum problem is not always evident and depends crucially on
whether the distribution of reset time intervals has a finite or an infinite
mean.

<h3>Viscoelastic active diffusion governed by nonequilibrium fractional  Langevin equations: underdamped dynamics and ergodicity breaking</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14041" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14041</a>
<br>
<i>Sungmin Joo, Jae-Hyung Jeon</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we investigate the active dynamics and ergodicity breaking of a
nonequilibrium fractional Langevin equation (FLE) with a power-law memory
kernel of the form $K(t)\sim t^{-(2-2H)}$, where $1/2<H<1$ represents the Hurst
exponent. The system is subjected to two distinct noises: a thermal noise
satisfying the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and an active noise
characterized by an active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with a propulsion memory
time $\tau_\mathrm{A}$. We provide analytic solutions for the underdamped
active fractional Langevin equation, performing both analytical and
computational investigations of dynamic observables such as velocity
autocorrelation, the two-time position correlation, ensemble- and time-averaged
mean-squared displacements (MSDs), and ergodicity-breaking parameters. Our
results reveal that the interplay between the active noise and long-time
viscoelastic memory effect leads to unusual and complex nonequilibrium dynamics
in the active FLE systems. Furthermore, the active FLE displays a new type of
discrepancy between ensemble- and time-averaged observables. The active
component of the system exhibits ultraweak ergodicity breaking where both
ensemble- and time-averaged MSDs have the same functional form with unequal
amplitudes. However, the combined dynamics of the active and thermal components
of the active FLE system are eventually ergodic in the infinite-time limit.
Intriguingly, the system has a long-standing ergodicity-breaking state before
recovering the ergodicity. This apparent ergodicity-breaking state becomes
exceptionally long-lived as $H\to1$, making it difficult to observe ergodicity
within practical measurement times. Our findings provide insight into related
problems, such as the transport dynamics for self-propelled particles in
crowded or polymeric media.

Surface diffusion on metal oxides is key in many areas of materials
technology, yet it has been scarcely explored at the atomic scale. This work
provides phenomenological insights from scanning tunneling microscopy on the
link between surface diffusion, surface atomic structure, and oxygen chemical
potential based on three model oxide surfaces: Fe$_2$O$_3(1\overline{1}02)$,
La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_3$(110), and In$_2$O$_3$(111). In all instances, changing
the oxygen chemical potential used for annealing stabilizes reconstructions of
different compositions while promoting the flattening of the surface morphology
-- a sign of enhanced surface diffusion. It is argued that thermodynamics,
rather than kinetics, rules surface diffusion under these conditions: The
composition change of the surface reconstructions formed at differently
oxidizing conditions drives mass transport across the surface.

<br>
<br>
Gate-all-around (GAA) nanowire (NW) field-effect transistor (FET) is a
promising device architecture due to its superior gate controllability than
that of the conventional FinFET architecture. The significantly higher electron
mobility of indium phosphide (InP) NW than silicon NW makes it particularly
well-suited for high-performance (HP) electronics applications. In this work,
we perform an ab initio quantum transport simulation to investigate the
performance limit of sub-5-nm gate length (Lg) GAA InP NW FETs. The GAA InP NW
FETs with Lg of 4 nm can meet the International Technology Roadmap for
Semiconductors (ITRS) requirements for HP devices from the perspective of
on-state current, delay time, and power dissipation. We also investigate the
impact of strain on 3-nm-Lg GAA InP NW FETs. The application of tensile strain
results in a remarkable increase of over 60% in the on-state current. These
results highlight the potential of GAA InP NW FETs for HP applications in the
sub-5-nm Lg region.

<h3>Relevance of long-range screening in Mott transition examined via a  hydrogen lattice</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Mott transition, a metal-insulator transition due to strong electronic
interaction, is observed in many materials without an accompanying change of
system symmetry. An important open question in Mott's proposal is the role of
long-range screening, whose drastic change across the quantum phase transition
may self-consistently make the transition more abrupt, toward a first-order
one. Here we investigate this effect in a model system of hydrogen atoms in a
cubic lattice, using charge self-consistent dynamical mean-field theory that
incorporates approximately the long-range interaction within the density
functional treatment. We found that the system is well within the
charge-transfer regime and that the charge-transfer gap intimately related to
the Mott transition closes smoothly instead. This indicates that within this
approximation, the long-range screening does not play an essential role in this
prototypical example. We explain this finding by demonstrating analytically
that the obtained insulating phase in this typical case is driven by
short-range physics of large energy scale, and the transition is controlled by
the charge-transfer gap closing, both insensitive to long-range screening.

<h3>Resolving the intrinsic short-range ordering of K$^+$ ions on cleaved  muscovite mica</h3>

<br>
Muscovite mica, KAl$_2$(Si$_3$Al)O$_{10}$(OH)$_2$, is a common layered
phyllosilicate with perfect cleavage planes. The atomically flat surfaces
obtained through cleaving lend themselves to scanning probe techniques with
atomic resolution and are ideal to model minerals and clays. Despite the
importance of the cleaved mica surfaces, several questions remain unresolved.
It is established that K$^+$ ions decorate the cleaved surface, but their
intrinsic ordering -- unaffected by the interaction with the environment -- is
not known. This work presents clear images of the K$^+$ distribution of cleaved
mica obtained with low-temperature non-contact atomic force microscopy (AFM)
under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. The data unveil the presence of
short-range ordering, contrasting previous assumptions of random or fully
ordered distributions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and Monte
Carlo simulations show that the substitutional subsurface Al$^{3+}$ ions have
an important role for the surface K$^+$ ion arrangement.

A topological phase can be engineered in quantum physics from the Bloch
sphere of a spin-1/2 showing an hedgehog structure as a result of a radial
magnetic field. We elaborate on a relation between the formation of an
entangled wavefunction at one pole, in a two-spins model, and an interesting
pair of one-half topological numbers. Similar to Cooper pairs in
superconductors, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair or Bell state produces a half
flux quantization, which here refers to the halved flux of the Berry curvature
on the surface. These 1/2-numbers also reveal the presence of a free Majorana
fermion at a pole. The topological responses can be measured when driving from
north to south and also from a circularly polarized field at the poles
revealing the quantized or half-quantized nature of the protected transverse
currents. We show applications of entangled wavefunctions in band structures,
introducing a local topological marker in momentum space, to characterize the
topological response of two-dimensional semimetals in bilayer geometries.

Recent years witnessed the development of powerful generative models based on
flows, diffusion or autoregressive neural networks, achieving remarkable
success in generating data from examples with applications in a broad range of
areas. A theoretical analysis of the performance and understanding of the
limitations of these methods remain, however, challenging. In this paper, we
undertake a step in this direction by analysing the efficiency of sampling by
these methods on a class of problems with a known probability distribution and
comparing it with the sampling performance of more traditional methods such as
the Monte Carlo Markov chain and Langevin dynamics. We focus on a class of
probability distribution widely studied in the statistical physics of
disordered systems that relate to spin glasses, statistical inference and
constraint satisfaction problems.
We leverage the fact that sampling via flow-based, diffusion-based or
autoregressive networks methods can be equivalently mapped to the analysis of a
Bayes optimal denoising of a modified probability measure. Our findings
demonstrate that these methods encounter difficulties in sampling stemming from
the presence of a first-order phase transition along the algorithm's denoising
path. Our conclusions go both ways: we identify regions of parameters where
these methods are unable to sample efficiently, while that is possible using
standard Monte Carlo or Langevin approaches. We also identify regions where the
opposite happens: standard approaches are inefficient while the discussed
generative methods work well.

<h3>The Two-Particle Self-Consistent Approach for Multiorbital models:  application to the Emery model</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Emery model, or three-band Hubbard model, is a Hamiltonian that is
thought to contain much of the physics of cuprate superconductors. This model
includes two noninteracting $p$ orbitals and one interacting $d$ orbital per
unit cell. Few methods that can solve multiorbital interacting Hamiltonians
reliably and efficiently exist. Here, we introduce an application of the two
particle self-consistent (TPSC) approach to the Emery model. We construct this
method within the framework of the TPSC+DMFT method, which can be seen as a way
to introduce nonlocal corrections to dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). We
show that interacting orbital densities, rather than the noninteracting ones,
must be used in the calculations. For the Emery model, we find that at constant
bare interaction $U$, the vertex for spin fluctuations, $U_{sp}$, decreases
rapidly with filling. This may be one of the factors that contributes to
electron-doped cuprates appearing less correlated than hole-doped ones. More
generally, our work opens the road to the application of the TPSC approach to
spin fluctuations in multiorbital models.

<h3>How to produce spin-splitting in antiferromagnetic materials</h3>

<br>
<br>
Antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials have potential advantages for spintronics
due to their robustness, ultrafast dynamics, and magnetotransport effects.
However, the missing spontaneous polarization and magnetization hinders the
efficient utilization of electronic spin in these AFM materials. Here, we
propose a simple way to produce spin-splitting in AFM materials by making the
magnetic atoms with opposite spin polarization locating in the different
environment (surrounding atomic arrangement), which does not necessarily
require the presence of spin-orbital coupling (SOC). We confirm our proposal by
four different types of two-dimensional (2D) AFM materials within the
first-principles calculations. Our works provide a intuitional design principle
to find or produce spin-splitting in AFM materials.

<br>
<i>Gionni Marchetti</i>
<br>
<br>
We argue that in the ensemble Monte Carlo approach, the spin decoherence
caused by electron-electron interactions in n-type bulk GaAs at room
temperature, according to Dyakonov-Perel theory, is mainly induced by the
electron density while electron-electron scattering itself does not directly
affect spin lifetime but instead influences it through any energy dependence of
other scattering mechanisms as typically expected in the case of the electron
mobility. Therefore, our analysis, which is strongly supported by Bayesian
Occam's razor, reconciles the semiclassical Monte Carlo approach with the novel
computational first-principles tool recently proposed by Xu, Habib,
Sundararaman and Ping.

Excitons, which represent a type of quasi-particles consisting of
electron-hole pairs bound by the mutual Coulomb interaction, were often
observed in lowly-doped semiconductors or insulators. However, realizing
excitons in the semiconductors or insulators with high charge carrier densities
is a challenging task. Here, we perform infrared spectroscopy, electrical
transport, ab initio calculation, and angle-resolved-photoemission spectroscopy
studies of a van der Waals degenerate-semiconductor Bi4O4SeCl2. A peak-like
feature (i.e., alpha peak) is present around ~ 125 meV in the optical
conductivity spectra at low temperature T = 8 K and room temperature. After
being excluded from the optical excitations of free carriers, interband
transitions, localized states and polarons, the alpha peak is assigned as the
exciton absorption. Moreover, assuming the existence of weakly-bound
excitons--Wannier-type excitons in this material violates the
Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation. Besides, the exciton binding energy of ~ 375
meV, which is about an order of magnitude larger than those of conventional
semiconductors, and the charge-carrier concentration of ~ 1.25 * 10^19 cm^-3,
which is higher than the Mott density, further indicate that the excitons in
this highly-doped system should be tightly bound. Our results pave the way for
developing the optoelectronic devices based on the tightly-bound and
room-temperature-stable excitons in highly-doped van der Waals degenerate
semiconductors.

<h3>Persistence of Monoclinic Crystal Structure in Three-Dimensional  Second-Order Topological Insulator Candidate 1T'-MoTe2 Thin Flake without  Structural Phase transition</h3>

<br>
<br>
A van der Waals material, MoTe2 with a monoclinic 1T' crystal structure is a
candidate for three-dimensional (3D) second-order topological insulators
(SOTIs) hosting gapless hinge states and insulating surface states. However,
due to the temperature-induced structural phase transition, the monoclinic 1T'
structure of MoTe2 would be transformed into the orthorhombic Td structure as
the temperature is lowered, which hinders the experimental verification and the
electronic applications of the predicted SOTI state at low temperatures. Here,
we present systematic Raman spectroscopy studies of the exfoliated MoTe2 thin
flakes with variable thicknesses at different temperatures. As a spectroscopic
signature of the orthorhombic Td structure of MoTe2, the out-of-plane vibration
mode D at ~ 125 cm-1 is always visible below a certain temperature in the
multilayer flakes thicker than ~ 27.7 nm, but vanishes in the temperature range
from 80 K to 320 K when the flake thickness becomes lower than ~ 19.5 nm. The
absence of the out-of-plane vibration mode D in the Raman spectra here
demonstrates not only the disappearance of the monoclinic-to-orthorhombic phase
transition but also the persistence of the monoclinic 1T' structure in the
MoTe2 thin flakes thinner than ~ 19.5 nm at low temperatures down to 80 K,
which may be caused by the high enough density of the holes introduced during
the gold-enhanced exfoliation process and exposure to air. The MoTe2 thin
flakes with the low-temperature monoclinic 1T' structure provide a material
platform for realizing SOTI states in van der Waals materials at low
temperatures, which paves the way for developing a new generation of electronic
devices based on SOTIs.

<br>
<br>
InSe is a promising material for a next-generation of two-dimensional
electronic and optical devices, characteristics of which are largely determined
by the type of band structure, direct or indirect. In general, different
methods can be sensitive to different peculiarities of the electronic structure
leading to different results. In this work, we will focus on the luminescent
properties of few-layer $\beta$-InSe with a thickness of 6 to 75 monolayers
(ML). Low-temperature micro-photoluminescence ($mu$-PL) studies show a sharp
increase in PL intensity in the range of thicknesses from 16 to 20 monolayers,
where, in addition, there is a singularity in the dependence of the work
function on the thickness. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPL)
reveals three characteristic PL decay times that differ from each other by
about an order of magnitude. We associate the processes underlying the two
faster decays with the recombination of electrons and holes between the band
extrema, either directly or through the interband relaxation of holes. Their
contributions to the total PL intensity increase significantly in the same
thickness range, 16-20 MLs. On the contrary, the slowest contribution, which we
attribute mainly to the defect-assisted recombination, prevails at a smaller
number of monolayers and then noticeably decreases. These results indicate the
indirect-to-direct bandgap transition near 16-20 MLs, which determines the
range of applicability of a few-layer $\beta$-InSe for efficient light
emitters.

Square net tellurides host an array of electronic ground states and commonly
exhibit charge-density-wave ordering. Here we report the epitaxy of
DyTe$_{2-\delta}$ on atomically flat MgO (001) using molecular beam epitaxy.
The films are single phase and highly oriented as evidenced by transmission
electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction measurements. Epitaxial strain is
evident in films and is relieved as the thickness increases up to a value of
approximately 20 unit cells. Diffraction features associated with a supercell
in the films are resolved which is coupled with Te-deficiency. First principles
calculations attribute the formation of this defect lattice to nesting
conditions in the Fermi surface, which produce a periodic occupancy of the
conducting Te square-net, and opens a band gap at the chemical potential. This
work establishes the groundwork for exploring the role of strain in tuning
electronic and structural phases of epitaxial square-net tellurides and related

<h3>Scaling regimes for wormlike chains confined to cylindrical surfaces  under tension</h3>

We compute the free energy of confinement ${\cal{F}}$ for a wormlike chain
(WLC), with persistence length $l_p$, that is confined to the surface of a
cylinder of radius $R$ under an external tension $f$ using a mean field
variational approach. For long chains, we analytically determine the behavior
of the chain in a variety of regimes, which are demarcated by the interplay of
$l_p$, the Odijk deflection length ($l_d=(R^2l_p)^{1/3}$), and the Pincus
length ($l_f = {k_BT}/{f}$, with $k_BT$ being the thermal energy). The theory
accurately reproduces the Odijk scaling for strongly confined chains at $f=0$,
with ${\cal{F}}\sim Ll_p^{-1/3}R^{-2/3}$. For moderate values of $f$, the Odijk
scaling is discernible only when ${l_p}\gg R$ for strongly confined chains.
Confinement does not significantly alter the scaling of the mean extension for
sufficiently high tension. The theory is used to estimate unwrapping forces for
DNA from nucleosomes.

We analyze modes in a dipole-dipole coupled quantum magnetic material, taking
into consideration domain structure and other shape effects present in any real
magnet. We find that the soft mode governing quantum criticality in a
non-ellipsoidal sample is an inhomogeneous magnetostatic mode which negates
dynamic, demagnetization-field effects. The demagnetization field is analyzed
from a microscopic perspective. Furthermore, we find a magnetostatic mode
originating from variations in the magnetization of the sample, caused by
domain structure and quantum or thermal fluctuations, will be lower in energy
than the soft mode governing quantum criticality in the bulk of the magnet.
Experimental evidence for these theoretical results is provided by analysis of
electronuclear modes in LiHoF$_4$, an archetypal dipolar quantum Ising
material, in a microwave resonator.

<h3>Diagnosing the possible chiral superconductivity in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and  beyond using supercurrent</h3>

One approach to probe the still controversial superconductivity in
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is to apply external perturbations that break the underlying
tetragonal crystalline symmetry. Chiral $p_x+ip_y$ and $d_{xz}+id_{yz}$ states
respond to such perturbations in ways that may help to distinguish them from
other superconducting pairings. However, past experimental efforts along this
line, using uniaxial strains and magnetic fields parallel to the RuO$_2$ plane,
have not been able to reach unambiguous conclusion. In this study, we propose
to diagnose the possible chiral superconducting order in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ using an
alternative tetragonal-symmetry-breaking perturbation -- in-plane supercurrent.
We study the superconducting phase diagram as a function of both temperature
and the applied supercurrent. Supercurrent generically splits the transition of
the two chiral order parameter components, and we show that the splitting can
give rise to visible specific heat anomalies. Furthermore, supercurrent
parallel and anti-parallel to the unidirectional propagation of the chiral edge
modes impact the edge states in different manner. This difference manifests in
tunneling spectrum, thereby providing an additional means to probe the
chirality even when the related spontaneous edge current is vanishingly small.
Finally, we discuss how supercurrent may help to identity other time-reversal
symmetry breaking superconducting states. Our proposal applies to other
candidate chiral superconductors.

Topological magnetic (anti)skrymions are robust string-like objects heralded
as potential components in next-generation topological spintronics devices due
to their manipulability via low-energy stimuli such as magnetic fields, heat,
and electric/thermal current. While these two-dimensional (2D) topological
objects are widely studied, intrinsically three-dimensional (3D) electron-spin
real-space topology remains less explored despite its prevalence in bulky
magnets. Here, we capture the 3D structure of antiskyrmions in a
single-crystal, precision-doped (Fe_{0.63}Ni_{0.3}Pd_{0.07})_{3}P lamellae
using holographic vector field electron tomography at room temperature and zero
field. Our measurements reveal hybrid string-like solitons composed of
skyrmions with topological number W = -1 on the lamellae's surfaces and an
antiskyrmion (W = +1) connecting them. High resolution images uncover a Bloch
point (BP) quadrupole (four magnetic (anti)monopoles) positioned along the
rectangular antiskyrmion's four corners (Bloch lines), which enable the
observed lengthwise topological transitions. Furthermore, we calculate and
compare the energy densities of hybrid strings with ideal (anti)skyrmion
strings using micromagnetic simulations, which suggest that this composite
(anti)BP structure stabilizes via the subtle interplay between the
magnetostatic interaction and anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.
The discovery of these hybrid spin textures enables topological tunabilty, a
tunable topological Hall effect, and the suppression of skyrmion Hall motion,
disrupting existing paradigms within spintronics.

<h3>Soft glassy materials with tunable extensibility</h3>

<br>
<br>
Extensibility is beyond the paradigm of classical soft glassy materials, and
more broadly, yield-stress fluids. Recently, model yield-stress fluids with
significant extensibility have been designed by adding polymeric phases to
classically viscoplastic dispersions [1, 2, 3]. However, fundamental questions
remain about the design of and coupling between the shear and extensional
rheology of such systems. In this work, we propose a model material, a mixture
of soft glassy microgels and solutions of high molecular weight linear
polymers. We establish systematic criteria for the design and thorough
rheological characterization of such systems, both in shear and in extension.
Using our material, we show that it is possible to dramatically change the
behavior in extension with minimal change in the shear yield stress and elastic
modulus, thus enabling applications that exploit orthogonal modulation of shear
and extensional material properties.

We theoretically investigate superconductivity under a spin-split band
structure owing to a collinear-type antiferromagnetic order in
quasi-two-dimensional organic compounds $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2X$. We find that
the magnetic order can induce a Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO)
state, where the Cooper pair possesses a finite center-of-mass momentum. We
show this from two types of analyses: (1) an effective model where simple
intraband attractive interactions are assumed, and (2) many-body calculations
of the repulsive Hubbard model based on the fluctuation-exchange approximation
and the linearized Eliashberg equation. Our results show the possibility of
realizing the FFLO state without applying an external magnetic field.

<h3>The Replica Symmetry Broken States of some Glass Models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14229" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14229</a>
<br>
<i>J. Yeo, M. A. Moore</i>
<br>
<br>
We have studied in detail the $M$-$p$ balanced spin glass model, which is a
candidate for being a model for structural glasses. Such models possess two
kinds of broken replica states; those with one-step replica symmetry breaking
(1RSB) and those with full replica symmetry breaking (FRSB). To determine which
arises requires studying the Landau expansion to quintic order. There are 9
quintic order coefficients, and 5 quartic order coefficients, whose values we
determine for this model. We show that it is only for $2 \leq M < 2.4714
\cdots$ that the transition at mean-field level is to a state with FRSB, while
for larger $M$ values there is either a continuous transition to a state with
1RSB (when $ M \leq 3$) or a discontinuous transition for $M > 3$. The Gardner
transition from a 1RSB state at low temperatures to a state with FRSB also
requires the Landau expansion to be taken to quintic order. Our result for the
form of FRSB in the Gardner phase is similar to that found when $2 \leq M <
2.4714\cdots$, but differs from that given in the early paper of Gross et al.
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 55, 304 (1985)]. Finally we discuss the effects of
fluctuations on our mean-field solutions using the scheme of H\"{o}ller and
Read [Phys. Rev. E 101, 042114 (2020)] and argue that such fluctuations will
remove the continuous 1RSB transition in dimension $d$ when $8 >d \geq 6$
leaving just the FRSB continuous transition (and possibly also the
discontinuous 1RSB transition). We suggest values for $M$ and $p$ which might
be used in simulations to resolve the outstanding question of whether
fluctuation corrections can remove the discontinuous 1RSB transition.

<br>
<br>
Despite their highly anisotropic complex-oxidic nature, certain delafossite
compounds (e.g., PdCoO2) are the most conductive oxides known, for reasons that
remain poorly understood. It is widely accepted that these materials are
somehow ultrapure, although the methods for their growth (which produce only
small crystals) are not typically capable of such. Here, we report a new
approach to PdCoO2 crystal growth, using chemical vapor transport to achieve
order-of-magnitude gains in size, the highest structural qualities reported,
and record residual resistivity ratios (>440). Nevertheless, the first detailed
mass spectrometry on these materials reveals that they are not ultrapure,
typically harboring 100s-of-parts-per-million impurity levels. For
crystal-chemical reasons that we elaborate in full, however, the majority of
these impurities must reside in Co-O octahedral layers, leaving the conductive
Pd sheets highly pure (~1 ppm). We thus conclude that a "sublattice
purification" mechanism is essential to the ultrahigh low-temperature
conductivity and mean-free-path of metallic delafossites.

<h3>Implications of the electron-phonon coupling in CuPb$_9$(PO$_4$)$_6$O  for high-temperature superconductivity: an \textit{ab initio} study</h3>

We report $ab~initio$ calculations of the electronic and vibrational
properties in CuPb$_9$(PO$_4$)$_6$O, including the electron-phonon coupling
strength via strong-coupling Migdal-Eliashberg theory. We verify the presence
of appealing flat electronic bands near the Fermi level, a strong hybridization
between the Cu $3d$ and O $2p$ states, and soft low-energy phonons, which can
suggest high-temperature superconducting behavior. However, the electron-phonon
coupling strength appears insufficient to overcome the Coulomb repulsion
between an electron pair and thus does does not support high-temperature
superconductivity in CuPb$_9$(PO$_4$)$_6$O via the conventional electron-phonon
Migdal-Eliashberg mechanism. Even neglecting Coulomb repulsion of the electron
pair we find this electron-phonon coupling suggests a superconducting
transition temperature less than 2~K.

Arranged patterns obtained by ultrafast laser processing on the surface of
Ti/Cu/Ti/Si and Ti/Zr/Ti/Si thin film systems are reported. Two differently
designed multilayer thin films, Ti/Cu/Ti/Si and Ti/Zr/Ti/Si, were deposited on
silicon by the ion sputtering method. The bioactive surfaces on these systems
involve the formation of laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) in
each of the laser-written lines of mesh patterns on 5x5 mm areas. The formation
of nano- and micro-patterns with an ultra-thin oxide film on the surfaces was
used to observe the effects of morphology and proliferation of the MRC-5 cell
culture line. To determine whether Ti-based thin films have a toxic effect on
living cells, an MTT assay was performed. The relative cytotoxic effect as a
percentage of surviving cells showed that there was no difference in cell
number between the Ti-based thin films and the control cells. There was also no
difference in the viability of the MRC-5 cells, except for the Ti/Cu/Ti/Si
system, where there was a slight 10% decrease in cell viability.

<h3>Defects and Oxygen Impurities in Ferroelectric Wurtzite  Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N Alloys</h3>

III-nitrides and related alloys are widely used for optoelectronics and as
acoustic resonators. Ferroelectric wurtzite nitrides are of particular interest
because of their potential for direct integration with Si and wide bandgap
semiconductors, and unique polarization switching characteristics; such
interest has taken off since the first report of ferroelectric
Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N alloys. However, the coercive fields needed to switch
polarization are on the order of MV/cm, which is 1-2 orders of magnitude larger
than oxide perovskite ferroelectrics. Atomic-scale point defects are known to
impact the dielectric properties, including breakdown fields and leakage
currents, as well as ferroelectric switching. However, very little is known
about the native defects and impurities in Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N, and their effect
on the dielectric properties. In this study, we use first-principles
calculations to determine the formation energetics of native defects and
unintentional oxygen incorporation in Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N. We find that nitrogen
vacancies are the dominant native defects, and that they introduce multiple
mid-gap states that can lead to premature dielectric breakdown in
ferroelectrics and carrier recombination in optoelectronics. Growth under
N-rich conditions will reduce the concentration of these deep defects. We also
investigate unintentional oxygen incorporation on the nitrogen site and find
that the substitutional defect is present in high concentrations, which can
contribute to increased temperature-activated leakage currents. Our findings
provide fundamental understanding of the defect physics in Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N
alloys, which is critical for future deployment of ferroelectric devices.

<h3>Three-dimensional flat Landau levels in an inhomogeneous acoustic  crystal</h3>

<br>
<br>
When electrons moving in two-dimensions (2D) are subjected to a strong
uniform magnetic field, they form flat bands called Landau levels, which are
the basis for the quantum Hall effect. Landau levels can also arise from
pseudomagnetic fields (PMFs) induced by lattice distortions; for example,
mechanically straining graphene causes its Dirac quasiparticles to form a
characteristic set of unequally-spaced Landau levels, including a zeroth Landau
level. In three-dimensional (3D) systems, there has thus far been no
experimental demonstration of Landau levels or any other type of flat band. For
instance, applying a uniform magnetic field to materials hosting Weyl
quasiparticles, the 3D generalizations of Dirac quasiparticles, yields bands
that are non-flat in the direction of the field. Here, we report on the
experimental realization of a flat 3D Landau level in an acoustic crystal.
Starting from a lattice whose bandstructure exhibits a nodal ring, we design an
inhomogeneous distortion corresponding to a specific pseudomagnetic vector
potential (PVP) that causes the nodal ring states to break up into Landau
levels, with a zeroth Landau level that is flat along all three directions.
These findings point to the possibility of using nodal ring materials to
generate 3D flat bands, to access strong interactions and other interesting
physical regimes in 3D.

As one of the fundamental magnonic devices, a magnonic splitter device has
been proposed and spin wave propagation in this device has been studied
numerically and experimentally. In the present work, we fabricated a T-shaped
magnonic splitter with 6 $\mu$m-wide three arms using a 100 nm-thick yttrium
iron garnet film and, using time-resolved magneto-optic Kerr microscopy,
observed that spin waves split into both, the vertical and the horizontal
direction at the junction. Analyzing the results, we found that spin wave modes
are converted into another during the splitting process and the splitting
efficiency is dominantly dependent on the 1st order of incoming spin waves.

Since the discovery of the fascinating properties in magic-angle graphene,
the exploration of moir\'e systems in other two-dimensional materials has
garnered significant attention and given rise to a field known as 'moir\'e
physics'. Within this realm, magnetic van der Waals heterostructure and the
magnetic proximity effect in moir\'e superlattices have also become subjects of
great interest. However, the spin-polarized transport property in this moir\'e
structures is still a problem to be explored. Here, we investigate the
spin-polarized transport properties in a moir\'e superlattices formed by a
two-dimensional ferromagnet CrI_3 stacked on a monolayer BAs, where the spin
degeneracy is lifted because of the magnetic proximity effect associated with
the moir\'e superlattices. We find that the conductance exhibits spin-resolved
miniband transport properties at a small twist angle because of the periodic
moir\'e superlattices. When the incident energy is in the spin-resolved
minigaps, the available states are spin polarized, thus providing a
spin-polarized current from the superlattice. Moreover, only a finite number of
moir\'e period is required to obtain a net spin polarization of 100\%. In
addition, the interlayer distance of the heterojunction is also moir\'e
modifiable, so a perpendicular electric field can be applied to modulate the
intensity and direction of the spin polarization. Our finding points to an
opportunity to realize spin functionalities in magnetic moir\'e superlattices.

<h3>Impact of disorder in the charge-density-wave state of Pd-intercalated  ErTe$_3$ revealed by the electrodynamic response</h3>

<br>
<br>
It is a general notion that disorder, introduced by either chemical
substitution or intercalation as well as by electron-irradiation, is
detrimental to the realisation of long-range charge-density-wave (CDW) order.
We study the disorder-induced suppression of the in-plane CDW orders in the
two-dimensional Pd-intercalated ErTe$_3$ compositions, by exploring the real
part of the optical conductivity with light polarised along the in-plane $a$
and $c$ axes. Our findings reveal an anisotropic charge dynamics with respect
to both incommensurate unidirectional CDW phases of ErTe$_3$, occurring within
the $ac$-plane. The anisotropic optical response gets substantially washed out
with Pd-intercalation, hand-in-hand with the suppression of both CDW orders.
The spectral weight analysis though advances the scenario, for which the CDW
phases evolve from a (partially) depleted Fermi surface already above their
critical onset temperatures. We therefore argue that the long-range CDW orders
of ErTe$_3$ tend to be progressively dwarfed by Pd-intercalation, which favours
the presence of short-range CDW segments for both crystallographic directions
persisting in a broad temperature ($T$) interval up to the normal state, and
being suggestive of precursor effects of the CDW orders as well as possibly
coexisting with superconductivity at low $T$.

<h3>Anisotropic and pressure tunable magnetism of titanium-based Kagome  ferromagnet SmTi3Bi4</h3>

<br>
<br>
Kagome magnets showing diverse topological quantum responses are crucial for
next-generation topological engineering. Here we report the physical properties
of a newly discovered titanium-based Kagome ferromagnet SmTi3Bi4, mainly
focusing on its anisotropy and high-pressure tunability of magnetism. The
crystal structure of SmTi3Bi4 belongs to the RETi3Bi4 (RE = Rare earth element)
prototype, featuring a distorted Ti Kagome lattice in TiBi layer and Sm-atomic
zig-zag chain along the c axis. By the temperature-dependent resistivity, heat
capacity, and magnetic susceptibility measurements, a ferromagnetic (FM)
ordering temperature Tc is determined to be 23.2 K, above which a T-linear
resistivity and quite large density of states near Fermi level are hinted to
exist. A large magnetic anisotropy was observed by rotating the in-plane
magnetic field, showing the b axis is the easy magnetizations axis. The
resistance under high pressure shows a suppression from 23.2 K to 8.5 K up to
23.5 GPa first and a following little enhancement up to 44.8 GPa. Considering
the large in-plane magnetization between stacked Kagome lattices and tunability
of FM order, possible topological phase transitions can be anticipated in
SmTi3Bi4, which should be a new promising platform to explore the complex
electronic and magnetic phases based on Kagome lattice.

<br>
<br>
The potential for low-threshold optical nonlinearity has received significant
attention in the fields of photonics and conceptual optical neuron networks.
Excitons in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are particularly promising in
this regard as reduced screening and dimensional confinement foster their
pronounced many-body interactions towards nonlinearity. However, experimental
determination of the interactions remains ambiguous, as optical pumping in
general creates a mixture of excitons and unbound carriers, where the impacts
of band gap renormalization and carrier screening on exciton energy counteract
each other. Here by comparing the influences on exciton ground and excited
states energies in the photoluminescence spectroscopy of monolayer MoSe$_2$, we
are able to identify separately the screening of Coulomb binding by the neutral
excitons and by charge carriers. The energy difference between exciton ground
state (A-1s) and excited state (A-2s) red-shifts by 5.5 meV when the neutral
exciton density increases from 0 to $4\times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$, in contrast to
the blue shifts with the increase of either electron or hole density. This
energy difference change is attributed to the mutual screening of Coulomb
binding of neutral excitons, from which we extract an exciton polarizability of
$\alpha_{2D}^{\rm exciton} = 2.55\times 10^{-17}$ eV(m/V)$^2$. Our finding
uncovers a new mechanism that dominates the repulsive part of many-body
interaction between neutral excitons.

<br>
We propose an approach for investigating the many body effects on phonon
spectrum in an electron-phonon coupled system by taking into account the
electron self-energy and vertex corrections which respect the Ward identity
representing the conservation of electronic charge. Our approach provides a
systematic diagrammatic expansion of the phonon self-energy
$\Pi(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ in powers of the electron-phonon scattering strength
$(g^2)$.
In this approach the many body corrections to phonon spectrum vanish
identically in the regime of long-wavelength excitations ($\mathbf{q}
\rightarrow 0$) due to an exact cancellation between the contributions arising
from electron self-energy and vertex corrections. Our results demonstrate that
the contributions of electron self-energy and vertex corrections are not only
comparable but they also tend to cancel each oher so that the phonon spectrum
remains nearly unaffected due to many body effects in the regime of
long-wavelength excitations ($\mathbf{q} \rightarrow 0$)

Potassium tantalate (KTaO$_{3}$) is a promising material for dielectric
applications at low temperature. However, dense and single-phase ceramics
cannot be obtained by conventional sintering because of the evaporation of
potassium that leads to secondary phases. Here, we demonstrate that spark
plasma sintering is a suitable method to obtain dense and single-phase
KTaO$_{3}$ ceramics, by optimizing three parameters: initial composition,
temperature, and pressure. A 2 mol% K-excess in the precursors leads to a large
grain growth and dense single-phase ceramics. Without K-excess, a small amount
of secondary phase (K$_{6}$Ta$_{10.8}$O$_{30}$) is observed at the surface but
can be removed by polishing. At 10 K, the dielectric permittivity is 4 times
higher in the ceramic from the 2 mol% K-excess powder, because of the larger
grain size. The thermal conductivity decreases with decreasing grain size and
stays above the thermal conductivity of KNbO$_{3}$ ceramics.

The excitation spread caused by Rydberg facilitation in a gas of laser driven
atoms is an interesting model system for studying epidemic dynamics. We derive
a mean-field approach to describe this facilitation process in the limits of
high and low temperatures, which takes into account Rydberg blockade and the
network character of excitation spreading in a low-temperature gas. As opposed
to previous mean-field models, our approach accurately predicts all stages of
the facilitation dynamics from the initial fast epidemic growth, an extended
saturation period, to the final relaxation phase.

<br>

Two-dimensional (2D) materials tend to have the preferably formation of
vacancies at the outer surface. Here, contrary to the normal notion, we reveal
a type of vacancy that thermodynamically initiates from the interior part of
the 2D backbone of germanium selenide ({\gamma}-GeSe). Interestingly, the
Ge-vacancy (VGe) in the interior part of {\gamma}-GeSe possesses the lowest
formation energy amongst the various types of defects considered. We also find
a low diffusion barrier (1.04 eV) of VGe which is a half of those of sulfur
vacancy in MoS2. The facile formation of mobile VGe is rooted in the
antibonding coupling of the lone-pair Ge 4s and Se 4p states near the valence
band maximum, which also exists in other gamma-phase MX (M=Sn, Ge; X=S, Te).
The VGe is accompanied by a shallow acceptor level in the band gap and induces
strong infrared light absorption and p-type conductivity. The VGe located in
the middle cationic Ge sublattice is well protected by the surface Se layers-a
feature that is absent in other atomically thin materials. Our work suggests
that the unique well-buried inner VGe, with the potential of forming
structurally protected ultrathin conducting filaments, may render the GeSe
layer an ideal platform for quantum emitting, memristive, and neuromorphic
applications.

An unexpected dichotomic long time aging behaviour is observed in a glassy
colloidal clay suspension investigated by X-Ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy
and Dynamic Light Scattering. In the long time aging regime the intensity
autocorrelations are non-exponential, following the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts
functional form with exponent bQ. We show that for spontaneously aged samples a
stretched behaviour (\beta_Q < 1) is always found. Surprisingly a compressed
exponent (\beta_Q > 1) appears only when the system is rejuvenated by
application of a shear field. In both cases the relaxation times scale as
Q^{-1}. These observations shed light on the origin of compressed exponential
behaviour and helps in classifying previous results in the literature on
anomalous dynamics.

Hydrogen as the cleanest energy carrier is a promising alternative renewable
resource to fossil fuels. There is an ever-increasing interest in exploring
efficient and cost-effective approaches of hydrogen production. Recent
experiments have shown that single platinum atom immobilized on the metal
vacancies of MXenes allows a high-efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).
Here using ab initio calculations, we design a series of substitutional
Pt-doped Tin+1CnTx (Tin+1CnTx-PtSA) with different thicknesses and terminations
(n = 1, 2 and 3, Tx = O, F and OH), and investigate the quantum-confinement
effect on the HER catalytic performance. Surprisingly, we reveal a strong
thickness effect of the MXene layer on the HER performance. Amongst the various
surface-terminated derivatives, Ti2CF2-PtSA and Ti2CH2O2-PtSA are found to be
the best HER catalysts with the change of Gibbs free energy {\Delta}G*H ~ 0 eV,
complying with the thermoneutral condition. The ab initio molecular dynamics
simulations reveal that Ti2CF2-PtSA and Ti2CH2O2-PtSA possess a good
thermodynamic stability. The present work shows that the HER catalytic activity
of the MXene is not solely governed by the local environment of the surface
such as Pt single atom. We point out the critical role of thickness control and
surface decoration of substrate in achieving a high-performance HER catalytical
activity.

<h3>High-throughput screening of heterogeneous transition metal dual-atom  catalysts by synergistic effect for nitrate reduction to ammonia</h3>

Nitrate reduction to ammonia has attracted much attention for nitrate (NO3-)
removal and ammonia (NH3) production. Identifying promising catalyst for active
nitrate electroreduction reaction (NO3RR) is critical to realize efficient
upscaling synthesis of NH3 under low-temperature condition. For this purpose,
by means of spin-polarized first-principles calculations, the NO3RR performance
on a series of graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) supported double-atom catalysts
(denoted as M1M2@g-CN) are systematically investigated. The synergistic effect
of heterogeneous dual-metal sites can bring out tunable activity and
selectivity for NO3RR. Amongst 21 candidates examined, FeMo@g-CN and CrMo@g-CN
possess a high performance with low limiting potentials of -0.34 and -0.39 V,
respectively. The activities can be attributed to a synergistic effect of the
M1M2 dimer d orbitals coupling with the anti-bonding orbital of NO3-. The
dissociation of deposited FeMo and CrMo dimers into two separated monomers is
proved to be difficult, ensuring the kinetic stability of M1M2@g-CN.
Furthermore, the dual-metal decorated on g-CN significantly reduces the bandgap
of g-CN and broadens the adsorption window of visible light, implying its great
promise for photocatalysis. This work opens a new avenue for future theoretical
and experimental design related to NO3RR photo-/electrocatalysts.

<h3>Structural and microscopic relaxations in a colloidal glass</h3>

<br>
<br>
The aging dynamics of a colloidal glass has been studied by multiangle
Dynamic Light Scattering, Neutron Spin Echo, X-ray Photon Correlation
Spectroscopy and Molecular Dynamics simulations. The two relaxation processes,
microscopic (fast) and structural (slow), have been investigated in an
unprecedentedly wide range of time and length scales covering both ergodic and
nonergodic regimes. The microscopic relaxation time remains diffusive at all
length scales across the glass transition scaling with wavevector Q as Q^{-2}.
The length-scale dependence of structural relaxation time changes from
diffusive, characterized by a Q^{-2}-dependence in the early stages of aging,
to Q^{-1}- dependence in the full aging regime which marks a discontinuous
hopping dynamics. Both regimes are associated with a stretched behaviour of the
correlation functions. We expect these findings to provide a general
description of both relaxations across the glass transition.

We investigate magnon magnon hybrid states using a non Hermitian two band
Hamiltonian and the concept of wavefunction hybridization. By comparing our
model with micromagnetic simulations conducted on a synthetic antiferromagnet
with strong magnon magnon coupling, we successfully reproduce not only the
resonance frequencies and linewidths but also the phases and amplitudes of the
magnon wavefunction. The hybridization effect influences the dissipation rate,
leading to the crossing of linewidths. Additionally, we quantify the magnon
hybridization within a magnonic Bloch sphere, which enhances the ability to
manipulate hybrid magnons for coherent information processing.

The localization length r_{loc} associated with a fast secondary relaxation
in glassy Laponite is determined by X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy
(XPCS) through a Debye-Waller fit of the non-ergodicity parameter. Quantitative
differences are observed between the time dependence (aging) of r_{loc} in
spontaneously aged and rejuvenated samples. This behavior is also reflected in
the calculated shear modulus which matches well with data obtained by
rheological measurements.

Quantifying irreversibility of a system using finite information constitutes
a major challenge in stochastic thermodynamics. We introduce an observable that
quantifies the time-reversal asymmetry between two states after a finite time
lag. Our central result is a bound on the time-reversal asymmetry in terms of
the total cycle affinity driving the system out of equilibrium. Our result
leads to further thermodynamic bounds on the asymmetry of directed fluxes; on
the asymmetry of finite-time cross-correlation; and on the cycle affinity of
coarse-grained dynamics.

<br>
<br>
Kagome materials have attracted a surge of research interest recently,
especially for the ones combining with magnetism, and the ones with weak
interlayer interactions which can fabricate thin devices. However, kagome
materials combining both characters of magnetism and weak interlayer
interactions are rare. Here we investigate a new family of titanium based
kagome materials RETi3Bi4 (RE = Eu, Gd and Sm). The flakes of nanometer
thickness of RETi3Bi4 can be obtained by exfoliation due to the weak interlayer
interactions. According to magnetic measurements, out-of-plane ferromagnetism,
out-of-plane anti-ferromagnetism, and in-plane ferromagnetism are formed for RE
= Eu, Gd, and Sm respectively. The magnetic orders are simple and the
saturation magnetizations can be relatively large since the rare earth elements
solely provide the magnetic moments. Further by angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) and first-principles calculations, the electronic
structures of RETi3Bi4 are investigated. The ARPES results are consistent with
the calculations, indicating the bands characteristic with kagome sublattice in
RETi3Bi4. We expect these materials to be promising candidates for observation
of the exotic magnetic topological phases and the related topological quantum
transport studies.

<h3>Spreading of a viscoelastic drop on a solid substrate</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the spreading of viscous and viscoelastic drops on solid substrates
with different wettability. In the early stages of spreading, we find that the
viscoelastic drop spreads with faster and a different power law than the
Newtonian drop (i.e. aqueous glycerine solution) for the same zero shear rate
viscosity. We argue that the effect of viscoelasticity is only observable for
experimental time scales in the order of the internal relaxation time of the
polymer solution or longer times. Near the contact line, the effective
viscosity is lower for the viscoelastic drop than for the Newtonian drop.
Together with its shear rate dependency, this difference in effective viscosity
can explain the different spreading dynamics. We support our experimental
findings with a simple perturbation model that qualitatively agrees with our
findings.

<h3>Topological marker approach to an interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</h3>

<br>
<br>
The topological properties of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model in the
presence of nearest-neighbor interaction are investigated by means of a
topological marker, generalized from a noninteracting one by utilizing the
single-particle Green's function of the many-body ground state. We find that
despite the marker not being perfectly quantized in the presence of
interactions, it always remains finite in the topologically nontrivial phase
while converging to zero in the trivial phase when approaching the
thermodynamic limit, and hence correctly judges the topological phases in the
presence of interactions. The marker also correctly captures the
interaction-driven, second-order phase transitions between a topological phase
and a Landau-ordered phase, which is a charge density wave order in our model
with a local order parameter, as confirmed by the calculation of entanglement
entropy and the many-body Zak phase. Our work thus points to the possibility of
generalizing topological markers to interacting systems through Green's
function, which may be feasible for topological insulators in any dimension and
symmetry class.

<h3>External magnetic fields enhance capture of magnetic nanoparticles  flowing through molded microfluidic channels by ferromagnetic nanostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14543" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14543</a>
<br>
<i>Reyne Dowling, Mikhail Kostylev</i>
<br>
<br>
Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have many applications which require MNPs to be
captured and immobilized for their manipulation and sensing. For example, MNP
sensors based on detecting changes to the ferromagnetic resonances of an
antidot nanostructure exhibit better performance when the nanoparticles are
captured within the antidot inclusions. This study investigates the influence
of microfluidics upon the capture of MNPs by four geometries of antidot array
nanostructures hollowed into 30 nm-thick Permalloy films. The nanostructures
were exposed to a dispersion of 130 nm MNP clusters which passed through PDMS
microfluidic channels with a 400 {\mu}m circular cross-section fabricated from
wire molds. With the microfluidic flow of MNPs, the capture efficiency - the
ratio between the number of nanoparticles captured inside of the antidot
inclusions to the number outside the inclusions - decreased for all four
geometries compared to previous results introducing the particles via droplets
on the film surface. This indicates that most MNPs were passing over the
nanostructures, since there were no significant magnetophoretic forces acting
upon the particles. However, when a static magnetic field is applied, the
magnetophoretic forces generated by the nanostructure are stronger and the
capture efficiencies are significantly higher than those obtained using
droplets. In particular, circular antidots demonstrated the highest capture
efficiency among the four geometries of almost 83.1% when the magnetic field is
parallel to the film plane. In a magnetic field perpendicular to the film, the
circle antidots again show the highest capture efficiency of about 77%. These
results suggest that the proportion of nanoparticles captured inside antidot
inclusions is highest under a parallel magnetic field. Clearly, the geometry of
the nanostructure has a strong influence on the capture of MNPs.

<h3>Formation of Domains within Lower-to-higher Symmetry Structural  Transition in CrI$_3$</h3>

<br>
CrI$_3$ represents one of the most important van der Waals systems on the
route to understanding two-dimensional magnetic phenomena. Being arranged in a
specific layered structure it also provides a unique opportunity to investigate
structural transformations in dimension-confined systems. CrI$_3$ is dimorphic
and possesses a higher symmetry low-temperature phase, which is quite uncommon.
It contrasts with vanadium trihalides which show a higher symmetry
high-temperature. An explanation of this distinct behavior together with a
large cycle-dependent transition hysteresis is still an open question. Our
low-temperature X-ray diffraction study conducted on CrI$_3$ single crystals
complemented by magnetization and specific heat measurements was focused mainly
on specific features of the structural transition during cooling. Our results
manifest that the structural transition during cooling relates to the formation
of structural domains despite the lower symmetry structure transforming to a
higher symmetry one. We propose that these domains could control the transition
temperature and also the size of thermal hysteresis.

<h3>Two-dimensional weak topological insulators and superconductors</h3>

The one-dimensional (1D) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model is central to band
topology in condensed matter physics, which allows us to understand and design
topological states. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model serves as a basis for
topological insulators and provides insights into various topological states.
In this letter, we find another mechanism to analogize the SSHmodel by
introducing intrinsic spin-orbital coupling (SOC) and in-plane Zeeman field
instead of relying on alternating hopping integrals. In our model, the bound
states are protected by a quantizedhidden polarization andcharacterized by a
weak Z2 index (0;01) due to the inversion symmetry I. When the I symmetry is
broken, charge pumping is achieved by tuning the polarization. Moreover, by
introducing the p + ip superconductor pairing potential, a new topological
phase called weak topological superconductor (TSC) is identified. The new TSC
is characterized by a weak Z2 index (0;01) and nonchiral bound states. More
interestingly, these nonchiral bound states give rise to a chiral nonlocal
conductance, which is different from the traditional chiral TSC. Our findings
not only innovate the SSH model, but also predict the existence of weak TSC,
providing an alternative avenue for further exploration of its transport
properties.

Natural minerals contain ions that become hydrated when they come into
contact with water in vapor and liquid forms. Muscovite mica -- a common
phyllosilicate with perfect cleavage planes -- is an ideal system to
investigate the details of ion hydration. The cleaved mica surface is decorated
by an array of K$^+$ ions that can be easily exchanged with other ions or
protons when immersed in an aqueous solution. Despite the vast interest in the
atomic-scale hydration processes of these K$^+$ ions, experimental data under
controlled conditions have remained elusive. Here, atomically resolved
non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) is combined with X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to investigate the cation hydration upon
dosing water vapor at 100 K in ultra-high vacuum (UHV). The cleaved surface is
further exposed to ultra-clean liquid water at room temperature, which promotes
ion mobility and partial ion-to-proton substitution. The results offer the
first direct experimental views of the interaction of water with muscovite mica
in UHV. The findings are in line with previous theoretical predictions.

We show that the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and cubic symmetry
breaking in SrTiO3 results in a highly anisotropic Zeeman effect, which can be
measured via electrically-driven, electrically-detected spin resonance enabled
by the momentum dependence of spin-orbit coupling effects that become
particularly effective if the inversion symmetry is broken. The proposed
effects are expected to provide a unique insight into the roles of spin-orbit
interaction and symmetry breaking in SrTiO3 and its heterostructures.

Thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) are block copolymeric materials composed of
plastomeric "hard" and elastomeric "soft" domains, by which they exhibit highly
resilient yet dissipative large deformation features depending on volume
fractions and microstructures of the two distinct domains. Here, we develop a
new methodology to address the microscopic deformation mechanisms in TPU
materials with highly disordered microstructures. We propose new
micromechanical models for randomly dispersed (or occluded) as well as randomly
continuous hard domains, each within a continuous soft structure as widely
found in representative TPU materials over a wide range of volume fractions,
v$_{\mathrm{hard}}$ = 26.9% to 52.2%. The micromechanical modeling results are
compared to experimental data on the macroscopic large strain behaviors
reported previously (Cho et al. 2017). We explore the role of the dispersed vs.
continuous nature of the geometric features of the random microstructures on
shape recovery and energy dissipation at the microstructural level in this
important class of phase-separated copolymeric materials.

Here we report a TiHfNbTa bulk medium-entropy alloy (MEA) superconductor
crystallized in the body-centered cubic structure, which is synthesized by an
arc melting method. Superconducting properties of the TiHfNbTa are studied by
employing magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, and specific heat measurements.
Experimental results show a bulk superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of
around 6.75 K. The lower and upper crit-ical fields for TiHfNbTa are 45.8 mT
and 10.46 T, respectively. First-principles calculations show that the d
electron of Ti, Hf, Nb, and Ta is the main contribution near the Fermi level.
Our results indicate that the superconductivity is a conven-tional s-wave type
with extremely strong coupling. The extremely strong coupling behavior in the
s-wave type TiHfNbTa MEA superconductor is unusual because it generally happens
in cuprates, pnictides, and other unconventional superconductors.

<h3>Impact of atomic reconstruction on optical spectra of twisted TMD  homobilayers</h3>

<br>
<br>
Twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have revealed a
rich exciton landscape including hybrid excitons and spatially trapped moir\'e
excitons that dominate the optical response of the material. Recent studies
have revealed that in the low-twist-angle regime, the lattice undergoes a
significant relaxation in order to minimize local stacking energies. Here,
large domains of low energy stacking configurations emerge, deforming the
crystal lattices via strain and consequently impacting the electronic band
structure. However, so far the direct impact of atomic reconstruction on the
exciton energy landscape and the optical properties has not been well
understood. Here, we apply a microscopic and material-specific approach and
predict a significant change in the potential depth for moir\'e excitons in a
reconstructed lattice, with the most drastic change occurring in TMD
homobilayers. We reveal the appearance of multiple flat bands and a significant
change in the position of trapping sites compared to the rigid lattice. Most
importantly, we predict a multi-peak structure emerging in optical absorption
of WSe$_2$ homobilayers - in stark contrast to the single peak that dominates
the rigid lattice. This finding can be exploited as an unambiguous signature of
atomic reconstruction in optical spectra of moir\'e excitons in twisted
homobilayers.

Motivated by unexpected reports of a 26 K superconducting transition in
elemental titanium at high pressure, we carry out an accurate ab-initio study
of its properties to understand the rationale for this observation. The
critical superconducting temperatures (Tc's) predicted under the assumption of
a phononic pairing mechanism are found to be significantly lower than those
experimentally observed. We argue that this disagreement cannot be explained by
an unconventional coupling, as previously suggested, or by the existence of
competing metastable structural phases. As a physically meaningful hypothesis
to reconcile experimental and theoretical results, we assume the presence of Ti
vacancies in the lattice. Our first-principles calculations indeed show that
lattice vacancies can cause pressure dependent phonon softening and
substantially increase the electron-phonon coupling at high pressure, yielding
computed Tc's in agreement with the experimental measurements over the full
pressure range from 150 to 300 GPa. We expect the proposed Tc enhancement
mechanism to occur on a general basis in simple high-symmetry metals for
various types of defects.

In the context of $\theta$ electrodynamics we find transverse electromagnetic
wave solutions forbidden in Maxwell electrodynamics. Our results attest to new
evidence of the topological magnetoelectric effect in topological insulators,
resulting from a polarization rotation of an external electromagnetic field.
Unlike Faraday and Kerr rotations, the effect does not rely on a longitudinal
magnetic field, the reflected field, or birefringence. The rotation occurs due
to transversal discontinuities of the topological magnetoelectric parameter in
cylindrical geometries. The dispersion relation is linear, and birefringence is
absent. One solution behaves as an optical fiber confining exact transverse
electromagnetic fields with omnidirectional reflectivity. These results may
open new possibilities in optics and photonics by utilizing topological
insulators to manipulate light.

The research on the properties of spin waves (SWs) in three-dimensional
nanosystems is an innovative idea in the field of magnonics. Mastering and
understanding the nature of magnetization dynamics and binding of SWs at
surfaces, edges, and in-volume parts of three-dimensional magnetic systems
enables the discovery of new phenomena and suggests new possibilities for their
use in magnonic and spintronic devices. In this work, we use numerical methods
to study the effect of geometry and external magnetic field manipulations on
the localization and dynamics of SWs in crescent-shaped (CS) waveguides. It is
shown that changing the magnetic field direction in these waveguides breaks the
symmetry and affects the localization of eigenmodes with respect to the static
demagnetizing field. This in turn has a direct effect on their frequency.
Furthermore, CS structures were found to be characterized by significant
saturation at certain field orientations, resulting in a cylindrical
magnetization distribution. Thus, we present chirality-based nonreciprocal
dispersion relations for high-frequency SWs, which can be controlled by the
field direction (shape symmetry) and its amplitude (saturation).

We measure the rheology of transient hydrogels comprised of a single type of
DNA nanostar that makes both strong and weak bonds. These gels exhibit
power-law frequency-dependence of their storage and loss moduli, with scaling
exponents that depend on the proportions of the two bonds. A diffusive
stress-relaxation model, in which the strong-bond sub-network relieves stress
by diffusing through an effective viscosity imposed by the weak bonds, explains
the scaling of their moduli. The model has implications for the fractal
dimensions of the strong-bond sub-network that are in good agreement with
measurements and makes testable predictions for the viscoelasticity of other
transient hydrogels. Overall, this work demonstrates the power of DNA
nanotechnology to decipher, and potentially rationally design, power-law
rheology.

Owing to its atomically thin thickness, layer-dependent tunable band gap,
flexibility, and CMOS compatibility, MoS$_2$ is a promising candidate for
photodetection. However, mono-layer MoS2-based photodetectors typically show
poor optoelectronic performances, mainly limited by their low optical
absorption. In this work, we hybridized CVD-grown monolayer MoS$_2$ with a gold
nanodisk (AuND) array to demonstrate a superior visible photodetector through a
synergetic effect. It is evident from our experimental results that there is a
strong light-matter interaction between AuNDs and monolayer MoS$_2$, which
results in better photodetection due to a surface trap state passivation with a
longer charge carrier lifetime compared to pristine MoS$_2$. In particular, the
AuND/MoS$_2$ system demonstrated a photoresponsivity of $8.7 \times 10^{4}$
A/W, specific detectivity of $6.9 \times 10^{13}$ Jones, and gain $1.7 \times
10^{5}$ at $31.84 \mu W/cm^{2}$ illumination power density of 632 nm wavelength
with an applied voltage of 4.0 V for an AuND/MoS$_2$-based photodetector. To
our knowledge, these optoelectronic responses are one order higher than
reported results for CVD MoS$_2$-based photodetector in the literature.

Artificial Kitaev chains, formed by quantum dots coupled via superconductors,
have emerged as a promising platform for realizing Majorana bound states. Even
a minimal Kitaev chain (a quantum dot--superconductor--quantum dot setup) can
host Majorana states at discrete sweet spots. However, unambiguously
identifying Majorana sweet spots in such a system is still challenging. In this
work, we propose an additional dot coupled to one side of the chain as a tool
to identify good sweet spots in minimal Kitaev chains. When the two Majorana
states in the chain overlap, the extra dot couples to both and thus splits an
even--odd ground-state degeneracy when its level is on resonance. In contrast,
a ground-state degeneracy will persist for well-separated Majorana states. This
difference can be used to identify points in parameter space with spatially
separated Majorana states, using tunneling spectroscopy measurements. We
perform a systematic analysis of different relevant situations. We show that
the additional dot can help distinguishing between Majorana sweet spots and
other trivial zero-energy crossings. We also characterize the different
conductance patterns, which can serve as a guide for future experiments aiming
to study Majorana states in minimal Kitaev chains.
