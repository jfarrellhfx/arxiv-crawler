<h3>A scalable method to model large suspensions of colloidal phoretic  particles with arbitrary shapes</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05337" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05337</a>
<br>
</p><i>Blaise Delmotte, Florencio Balboa Usabiaga</i>
<p>Phoretic colloids self-propel thanks to surface flows generated in response
to surface gradients (thermal, electrical, or chemical), that are self-induced
and/or generated by other particles. Here we present a scalable and versatile
framework to model chemical and hydrodynamic interactions in large suspensions
of arbitrarily shaped phoretic particles, accounting for thermal fluctuations
at all Damkholer numbers. Our approach, inspired by the Boundary Element Method
(BEM), employs second-layer formulations, regularised kernels and a grid
optimisation strategy to solve the coupled Laplace-Stokes equations with
reasonable accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost associated with
BEM. As demonstrated by our large-scale simulations, the capabilities of our
method enable the exploration of new physical phenomena that, to our knowledge,
have not been previously addressed by numerical simulations.

<h3>Simulating dynamics of ellipsoidal particles using lattice Boltzmann  method</h3>

<p>Anisotropic particles are often encountered in different fields of soft
matter and complex fluids. In this work, we present an implementation of the
coupled hydrodynamics of solid ellipsoidal particles and the surrounding fluid
using the lattice Boltzmann method. A standard link-based mechanism is used to
implement the solid-fluid boundary conditions. We develop an implicit method to
update the position and orientation of the ellipsoid. This exploits the
relations between the quaternion which describes the ellipsoid's orientation
and the ellipsoid's angular velocity to obtain a stable and robust dynamic
update. The proposed algorithm is validated by looking at four scenarios: (i)
the steady translational velocity of a spheroid subject to an external force in
different orientations, (ii) the drift of an inclined spheroid subject to an
imposed force, (iii) three-dimensional rotational motions in a simple shear
flow (Jeffrey's orbits), and (iv) developed fluid flows and self-propulsion
exhibited by a spheroidal microswimmer. In all cases the comparison of
numerical results showed good agreement with known analytical solutions,
irrespective of the choice of the fluid properties, geometrical parameters, and
lattice Boltzmann model, thus demonstrating the robustness of the proposed
algorithm.

<h3>A first-principles study and mesoscopic modeling of two-dimensional spin  and orbital fluctuations in FeSe</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04802" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04802</a>
<br>
</p><i>Abyay Ghosh, Piotr Chudzinski, Myrta Grüning</i>
<p>We calculated the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of FeSe
within density-functional theory at the generalized gradient approximation
level. First, we studied how the bandwidth of the d-bands at the Fermi energy
are renormalized by adding simple corrections: Hubbard U, Hunds J and by
introducing long-range magnetic orders. We found that introducing either a
striped or a staggered dimer antiferromagnetic order brings the bandwidths --
which are starkly overestimated at the generalized gradient approximation level
-- closer to those experimentally observed. Second, for the ferromagnetic, the
striped, checkerboard and the staggered dimer antiferromagnetic order, we
investigate the change in magnetic formation energy with local magnetic moment
of Fe at a pressure up to 6 GPa. The bilinear and biquadratic exchange energies
are derived from the Heisenberg model and noncollinear first-principles
calculations, respectively. We found a non-trivial behavior of the
spin-exchange parameters on the magnetization, and we put forward a
field-theory model that rationalizes these results in terms of two-dimensional
spin and orbital fluctuations. The character of these fluctuations can be
either that of a standard density wave or a topological vortex. Topological
vortexes can result in mesoscopic magnetization structures.

<h3>Stability of quasicrystalline ultracold fermions to dipolar interactions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04830" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04830</a>
<br>
</p><i>Paolo Molignini</i>
<p>Quasiperiodic potentials can be used to interpolate between localization and
delocalization in one dimension. However, little is known about the stability
of quasicrystalline phases to long-range interactions. In this work, we study
repulsive ultracold dipolar fermions in a quasiperiodic optical lattice to
characterize the behavior of interacting quasicrystals. We simulate the full
time evolution of the typical experimental protocols used to probe
quasicrystalline order and localization properties. We extract experimentally
measurable dynamical observables and correlation functions to characterize the
three phases observed in the noninteracting setting: localized, intermediate,
and extended. We then study the stability of such phases to repulsive dipolar
interactions. We find that dipolar interactions can completely alter the shape
of the phase diagram by stabilizing the intermediate phase, mostly at the
expense of the extended phase. Moreover, in the strongly interacting regime, a
resonance-like behavior characterized by density oscillations appears.
Remarkably, strong dipolar repulsions can also localize particles even in the
absence of quasiperiodicity if the primary lattice is sufficiently deep. Our
work shows that dipolar interactions in a quasiperiodic potential can give rise
to a complex, tuneable coexistence of localized and extended quantum states.

<h3>Quasiclassical theory of superconducting spin-splitter effects and  spin-filtering via altermagnets</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04851" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04851</a>
<br>
</p><i>Hans Gløckner Giil, Bjørnulf Brekke, Jacob Linder, Arne Brataas</i>
<p>Conducting altermagnets have recently emerged as intriguing materials
supporting strongly spin-polarized currents without magnetic stray fields. We
demonstrate that altermagnets enable three key functionalities, merging
superconductivity and spintronics. The first prediction is a controllable
supercurrent-induced edge magnetization, which acts like a dissipationless
spin-splitter effect. The second and third predictions are a Cooper pair
spin-splitter and a filtering effect, respectively. These effects allow for
spatial separation of triplet pairs with opposite spin-polarizations and
spin-selective tunneling of Cooper pairs. We derive a quasiclassical theory
with associated boundary conditions that describe these phenomena and explain
how they can be experimentally verified. Our results open a new path for
spatial control of spin signals via triplet Cooper pairs using hybrid
superconductor-altermagnet devices.

<h3>Thermodynamic properties of an electron gas in a two-dimensional quantum  dot: an approach using density of states</h3>

<p>Potential applications of quantum dots in the nanotechnology industry make
these systems an important field of study in various areas of physics. In
particular, thermodynamics has a significant role in technological innovations.
With this in mind, we studied some thermodynamic properties in quantum dots,
such as entropy and heat capacity, as a function of the magnetic field over a
wide range of temperatures. The density of states plays an important role in
our analyses. At low temperatures, the variation in the magnetic field induces
an oscillatory behavior in all thermodynamic properties. The depopulation of
subbands is the trigger for the appearance of the oscillations.

<h3>The magnetic structure of Ce$_3$TiBi$_5$ and its relation to  current-induced magnetization</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04896" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04896</a>
<br>
</p><i>Nicolas Gauthier, Romain Sibille, Vladimir Pomjakushin, Øystein S. Fjellvåg, James Fraser, Mathieu Desmarais, Andrea D. Bianchi, Jeffrey A. Quilliam</i>
<p>The control of magnetization using electric fields has been extensively
studied in magnetoelectric multiferroic insulator materials. Changes in
magnetization in bulk metals caused by electric currents have attracted less
attention. The recently discovered metallic magnet Ce$_3$TiBi$_5$ has been
reported to exhibit current-induced magnetization. Here we determined the
magnetic structure of Ce$_3$TiBi$_5$ using neutron diffraction, aiming to
understand the microscopic origin of this magnetoelectric phenomenon in a
metal. We established that the antiferromagnetic order emerging below $T_N=5$ K
is a cycloid order described by $P6_3/mcm.1'(0,0,g)00sss$ with small moment
sizes of $0.50(2)~\mu_B$ and propagation vector ${\bf k}=(0,0,0.386)$.
Surprisingly, the symmetry of this magnetic structure is inconsistent with the
presence of current-induced magnetization and potential origins of this
inconsistency with previous results are discussed. Additionally, our results
suggest that moments order along their hard magnetic direction in
Ce$_3$TiBi$_5$, a phenomenon which has been observed in other Kondo systems.

<h3>Antiferroelectric Nanodomains Stabilized by Chemical Disorder at  Anti-phase Boundaries</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Menglin Zhu, Michael Xu, Yu Yun, Liyan Wu, Or Shafir, Colin Gilgenbach, Lane W. Martin, Ilya Grinberg, Jonathan E. Spanier, James M. LeBeau</i>
<p>Antiferroelectric perovskite oxides exhibit exceptional dielectric properties
and high structural/chemical tunability, making them promising for a wide range
of applications from high energy-density capacitors to solid-state cooling.
However, tailoring the antiferroelectric phase stability through alloying is
hampered by the complex interplay between chemistry and the alignment of dipole
moments. In this study, correlations between chemical order and the stability
of the antiferroelectric phase are established at anti-phase boundaries in
\ce{Pb2MgWO6}. Using multislice ptychography, we reveal the three-dimensional
nature of chemical order at the boundaries and show that they exhibit a finite
width of chemical intermixing. Furthermore, regions at and adjacent to the
anti-phase boundary exhibit antiferroelectric displacements in contrast to the
overall paraelectric film. Combining spatial statistics and density functional
theory simulations, local antiferroelectric distortions are shown to be
confined to and stabilized by chemical disorder. Enabled by the
three-dimensional information of multislice ptychography, these results provide
insights into the interplay between chemical order and electronic properties to
engineer antiferroelectric material response.

<h3>Extreme anti-ohmic conductance enhancement in neutral diradical  acene-like molecular junctions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04906" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04906</a>
<br>
</p><i>Brent Lawson, Efrain Vidal, Michael M. Haley, Maria Kamenetska</i>
<p>We achieve, at room temperature, conductance enhancements over two orders of
magnitude in single molecule circuits formed with polycyclic benzoquinoidal
(BQn) diradicals upon increasing molecular length by ~0.5 nm. We find that this
extreme and atypical anti-ohmic conductance enhancement at longer molecular
lengths is due to the diradical character of the molecules, which can be
described as a topologically non-trivial electronic state. We adapt the 1D-SSH
model originally developed to examine electronic topological order in linear
carbon chains to the polycyclic systems studied here and find that it captures
the anti-ohmic trends in this molecular series. The mechanism of conductance
enhancement with length is revealed to be constructive quantum interference
(CQI) between the frontier orbitals with non-trivial topology, which is present
in acene-like, but not in linear, molecular systems. Importantly, we predict
computationally and measure experimentally that anti-ohmic trends can be
engineered through synthetic adjustments of the diradical character of the
acene-like molecules. Overall, we achieve an experimentally unprecedented
anti-ohmic enhancement and mechanistic insight into electronic transport in a
class of materials that we identify here as promising candidates for creating
highly conductive and tunable nanoscale wires.

<h3>Electric field of DNA in solution: who is in charge?</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04949" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04949</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jonathan G. Hedley, Kush Coshic, Aleksei Aksimentiev, Alexei A. Kornyshev</i>
<p>In solution, DNA is a highly charged macromolecule which bears a unit of
negative charge on each phosphate of its sugar-phosphate backbone. Although
partially compensated by counterions adsorbed at or condensed near it, DNA
still produces a substantial electric field in its vicinity, which is screened
by buffer electrolyte at longer distances from the DNA. Such field has been
explored so far predominantly within the scope of a primitive model of the
electrolytic solution, not considering more complicated structural effects of
the water solvent. In this paper we investigate the distribution of electric
field around DNA using linear response nonlocal electrostatic theory, applied
here for helix-specific charge distributions, and compare the predictions of
such theory with specially performed fully atomistic large scale molecular
dynamics simulations. The main finding of this study is that oscillations in
the electrostatic potential distribution are present around DNA, caused by the
overscreening effect of structured water. Surprisingly, electrolyte ions at
physiological concentrations do not strongly disrupt these oscillations, and
rather distribute according to these oscillating patterns, indicating that
water structural effects dominate the short-range electrostatics. We also show
that (i) structured water adsorbed in the grooves of DNA lead to a positive
electrostatic potential core, (ii) the Debye length some 10 {\AA} away from the
DNA is reduced, effectively renormalised by the helical pitch of the DNA, and
(iii) Lorentzian contributions to the nonlocal dielectric function of water,
effectively reducing the dielectric constant close to the DNA, enhances the
overall electric field. The impressive agreement between the atomistic
simulations and the developed theory substantiates the use of nonlocal
electrostatics when considering solvent effects in molecular processes in
biology.

<h3>Enhanced polarization switching characteristics of HfO2 ultrathin films  via acceptor-donor co-doping</h3>

<p>In the realm of ferroelectric memories, HfO2-based ferroelectrics stand out
because of their exceptional CMOS compatibility and scalability. Nevertheless,
their switchable polarization and switching speed are not on par with those of
perovskite ferroelectrics. It is widely acknowledged that defects play a
crucial role in stabilizing the metastable polar phase of HfO2. Simultaneously,
defects also pin the domain walls and impede the switching process, ultimately
rendering the sluggish switching of HfO2. Herein, we present an effective
strategy involving acceptor-donor co-doping to effectively tackle this dilemma.
Remarkably enhanced ferroelectricity and the fastest switching process ever
reported among HfO2 polar devices are observed in La3+-Ta5+ co-doped HfO2
ultrathin films. Moreover, robust macro-electrical characteristics of co-doped
films persist even at a thickness as low as 3 nm, expanding potential
applications of HfO2 in ultrathin devices. Our systematic investigations
further demonstrate that synergistic effects of uniform microstructure and
smaller switching barrier introduced by co-doping ensure the enhanced
ferroelectricity and shortened switching time. The co-doping strategy offers an
effective avenue to control the defect state and improve the ferroelectric
properties of HfO2 films.

<h3>A universal phase-field mixture representation of thermodynamics and  shock wave mechanics in porous soft biologic continua</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04995" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04995</a>
<br>
</p><i>John D. Clayton</i>
<p>A continuum mixture theory is formulated for large deformations, thermal
effects, phase interactions, and degradation of soft biologic tissues. Such
tissues consist of one or more solid and fluid phases and can demonstrate
nonlinear anisotropic elastic, viscoelastic, thermoelastic, and poroelastic
physics. Under extremely large or rapid deformations, for example impact or
shock loading, tissues may fracture, tear, or rupture. Mechanisms are
encompassed in a universal, thermodynamically consistent formulation that
combines the continuum theory of mixtures with phase-field mechanics of
fracture. A metric tensor of generalized Finsler space supplies geometric
insight on effects rearrangements of microstructure, for example degrading
collagen fibers. Governing equations are derived, and energy potentials and
kinetic laws posited, for generic soft porous tissues with solid and liquid or
gas phases. Shock waves are modeled as singular surfaces; Hugoniot states and
shock decay are studied analytically. Suitability of the framework for
representing blood, skeletal muscle, and liver is demonstrated. Insight into
physics presently unresolved by experiments is obtained.

<h3>Crystal structure, properties and pressure-induced insulator-metal  transition in layered kagome chalcogenides</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05001" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05001</a>
<br>
</p><i>Hong Du, Yu Zheng, Cuiying Pei, Chi-Ming Yim, Yanpeng Qi, Ruidan Zhong</i>
<p>Layered materials with kagome lattice have attracted a lot of attention due
to the presence of nontrivial topological bands and correlated electronic
states with tunability. In this work, we investigate a unique van der Waals
(vdW) material system, $A_{2}M_{3}X_{4}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs; $M$ = Ni, Pd; $X$ =
S, Se), where transition metal kagome lattices, chalcogen honeycomb lattices
and alkali metal triangular lattices coexist simultaneously. A notable feature
of this material is that each Ni/Pd atom is positioned in the center of four
chalcogen atoms, forming a local square-planar environment. This crystal field
environment results in a low spin state $S$ = 0 of Ni$^{2+}$/Pd$^{2+}$. A
systematic study of the crystal growth, crystal structure, magnetic and
transport properties of two representative compounds, Rb$_{2}$Ni$_{3}$S$_{4}$
and Cs$_{2}$Ni$_{3}$Se$_{4}$, has been carried out on powder and single crystal
samples. Both compounds exhibit nonmagnetic $p$-type semiconducting behavior,
closely related to the particular chemical environment of Ni$^{2+}$ ions and
the alkali metal intercalated vdW structure. Additionally,
Cs$_{2}$Ni$_{3}$Se$_{4}$ undergoes an insulator-metal transition (IMT) in
transport measurements under pressure up to 87.10 GPa without any structural
phase transition, while Rb$_{2}$Ni$_{3}$S$_{4}$ persists in its semiconducting
behavior.

<p>In addition to the pressurized high-temperature superconductivity, bilayer
and trilayer nickelate superconductors Lan+1NinO3n+1 (n = 2 and 3) exhibit many
intriguing properties at ambient pressure, such as orbital-dependent electronic
correlation, non-Fermi liquid behavior, and density-wave transitions. Here,
using ultrafast reflectivity measurement, we observe a drastic difference
between the ultrafast dynamics of the bilayer and trilayer nickelates at
ambient pressure. Firstly, we observe a coherent phonon mode in La4Ni3O10
involving the collective vibration of La, Ni, and O atoms, which is absent in
La3Ni2O7. Secondly, the temperature-dependent relaxation time diverges near the
density-wave transition temperature of La4Ni3O10, in drastic contrast to
kink-like changes in La3Ni2O7. Moreover, we estimate the electron-phonon
coupling constants to be 0.05~0.07 and 0.12~0.16 for La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10,
respectively, suggesting a relatively minor role of electron-phonon coupling in
the electronic properties of Lan+1NinO3n+1. Our work not only sheds light on
the relevant microscopic interaction but also establishes a foundation for
further studying the interplay between superconductivity and density-wave
transitions in nickelate superconductors.

<h3>Superconductivity in Two-Dimentional Systems with Unconventional Rashba  Bands</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05051" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05051</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ran Wang, Jiayang Li, Xinliang Huang, Rui Song, Ning Hao</i>
<p>In two-dimensional system with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, it is well-known
that superconductivity can have mixed spin-singlet and -triplet parity, and the
$\boldsymbol{d}$-vector of spin-tripet pairing is parallel to
$\boldsymbol{g}$-vector of Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Here, we propose a model
to describe a two-dimensional system with unconventional Rashba bands and study
its superconductivity. We show that the $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector of spin-tripet
pairing can be either parallel or perpendicular to $\boldsymbol{g}$-vector of
Rashba spin-orbit coupling depending on the different pairing interaction. We
also propose a junction to generate tunneling spin current depending on the
direction of $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector. It provides a detecable evidence to
distinguish these two different but very similar pairing channels. Furthermore,
we find this model can give arise to a subleading spin-singlet chiral $p$-wave
topological superconducting state. More significantly, we find that such
unconventional Rashba bands and unconventional superconudcting pairings can be
realized on surface of some superconducting topological materials, such as
trigonal layered PtBi$_{2}$.

<h3>The role of Rashba spin-orbit induced spin textures in the anomalous  Josephson effect</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05052" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05052</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ross D. Monaghan, Giuseppe C. Tettamanzi</i>
<p>This work reports the theoretical investigation into the mechanism
underpinning the anomalous Josephson effect. The prototypical system we study
is a ballistic two-dimensional junction containing a two-dimensional Rashba
spin-orbit interaction. In this paper we demonstrate how this two-dimensional
Rashba interaction mixes the spins of adjacent transverse subbands which leads
to significant spin-asymmetry within the junction. Under an external magnetic
field, applied perpendicular to both the axis of transport and the normal
vector of the junction, the sinusoidal Josephson current can then experience an
anomalous phase shift. The role of this spin mixing in the limit of a single
sub-band is initially explored by deriving an analytical expression for the
resulting anomalous phase shift. The analysis is then extended to systems with
multiple occupied sub-bands; in this later section, starting from a microscopic
model, we derive an analytic formula for the resulting anomalous phase shift
indicating it is linear in both magnetic field and spin-orbit strength. We then
verify and validate all findings by comparing them with numerical results
evaluated by a tight-binding model.

<h3>Impurity in a zero-temperature three-dimensional Fermi gas</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05057" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05057</a>
<br>
</p><i>P. L. Krapivsky</i>
<p>We consider an impurity in a sea of zero-temperature fermions uniformly
distributed throughout the space. The impurity scatters on fermions. On
average, the momentum of impurity decreases with time as $t^{-1/(d+1)}$ in $d$
dimensions, and the momentum distribution acquires a scaling form in the long
time limit. We solve the Lorentz-Boltzmann equation for the scaled momentum
distribution of the impurity in three dimensions. The solution is a combination
of confluent hypergeometric functions. In two spatial dimensions, the
Lorentz-Boltzmann equation is analytically intractable, so we merely extract a
few exact predictions about asymptotic behaviors when the scaled momentum of
the impurity is small or large.

<h3>Intrinsic anomalous Hall effect arising from antiferromagnetic structure  revealed by high-quality NbMnP</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05058" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05058</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yuki Arai, Junichi Hayashi, Keiki Takeda, Hideki Tou, Hitoshi Sugawara, Hisashi Kotegawa</i>
<p>The large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in antiferromagnetic (AF) materials
arises from symmetry breaking equivalent to a ferromagnetic (FM) state.
Consequently, this suggests that the observed AHE is induced by the intrinsic
mechanism of the band structure effect, which in turn induces dissipationless
transverse conductivity. Confirmation of impurity-insensitive anomalous Hall
conductivity (AHC) is crucial to conclude this interpretation; however,
experimental investigations in AF materials are limited by the lack of high
quality systems. In this study, we show that the AF material NbMnP, which
exhibits a large AHE, offers a high quality single crystal. Our findings
clearly revealed that the large AHC and the tiny net magnetization of
$\sim10^{-3} \mu_{\mathrm{B}}$/Mn are inherent in this material, irrespective
of disorder. NbMnP is a novel AF material that generates FM responses in the
regime where there is less impurity scattering.

<p>Skyrmion lattices (SkL) in centrosymmetric materials typically have a
magnetic period on the nanometer-scale, so that the coupling between magnetic
superstructures and the underlying crystal lattice cannot be neglected. Here,
we reveal the commensurate locking of a SkL to the atomic lattice in
Gd$_3$Ru$_4$Al$_{12}$ via high-resolution resonant elastic x-ray scattering
(REXS). Weak easy-plane magnetic anisotropy, demonstrated here by a combination
of ferromagnetic resonance and REXS, penalizes placing a skyrmion core on a
site of the atomic lattice. Under these conditions, a commensurate SkL, locked
to the crystal lattice, is stable at finite temperatures -- but gives way to a
competing incommensurate ground state upon cooling. We discuss the role of
Umklapp-terms in the Hamiltonian for the formation of this lattice-locked
state, its magnetic space group, the role of slight discommensurations, or
(line) defects in the magnetic texture, and contrast our findings with the case
of SkLs in noncentrosymmetric material platforms.

</p><i>Sanghoon Lee, Alexei Andreanov, Tigran Sedrakyan, Sergej Flach</i>
<p>We investigate 1D and 2D cross-stitch lattices with hard-core bosons and
analytically construct exact groundstates that feature macroscopic degeneracy.
The construction relies on the presence of a flatband in the single particle
spectrum and the orthogonality of the associated compact localized states
(CLS). Up to filling fraction $\nu=1/2$, the groundstate is constructed by
occupying the CLS. Exactly at $\nu=1/2$, the groundstate becomes a Wigner
crystal. For higher filling fractions, the groundstate is constructed by
filling the CLS sites completely one by one. Macroscopic degeneracy arises from
the multiple choices available when occupying or filling the CLS sites. An
occupied CLS acts as an impenetrable barrier for bosons both in 1D and 2D,
leading to Hilbert space fragmentation. A similar phenomenology also holds for
hard-core bosons on the diamond chain and its higher dimensional
generalizations. We also discuss the mapping of these hard-core models onto
spin models with quantum many-body scars.

<h3>Superconductivity of the New Medium-Entropy Alloy V4Ti2W with a  Body-Centered Cubic Structure</h3>

<p>Medium- and high-entropy alloy (MEA and HEA) superconductors have attracted
considerable interest since their discovery. This paper reports the
superconducting properties of ternary tungsten-containing MEA V4Ti2W for the
first time. V4Ti2W is a type II superconductor with a body-centered cubic (BCC)
structure. Experimental results of resistivity, magnetization, and heat
capacity indicate that the superconducting transition temperature of the MEA
V4Ti2W is roughly 5.0 K. The critical magnetic fields at the upper and lower
ends are 9.93(2) T and 40.7(3) mT, respectively. Interestingly, few BCC MEA
superconductors with VEC greater than 4.8 have been found. The addition of
tungsten leads to a VEC of 4.83 e/a for V4Ti2W, which is rarely higher than the
4.8 value. Adding tungsten element expands the variety of MEA alloys, which may
improve the microstructure and mechanical properties of materials and even
superconducting properties. This material could potentially offer a new
platform for the investigation of innovative MEA and HEA superconductors.

<h3>Estimation of Electronic Band Gap Energy From Material Properties Using  Machine Learning</h3>

</p><i>Sagar Prakash Barad, Sajag Kumar, Subhankar Mishra</i>
<p>Machine learning techniques are utilized to estimate the electronic band gap
energy and forecast the band gap category of materials based on experimentally
quantifiable properties. The determination of band gap energy is critical for
discerning various material properties, such as its metallic nature, and
potential applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices. While
numerical methods exist for computing band gap energy, they often entail high
computational costs and have limitations in accuracy and scalability. A machine
learning-driven model capable of swiftly predicting material band gap energy
using easily obtainable experimental properties would offer a superior
alternative to conventional density functional theory (DFT) methods. Our model
does not require any preliminary DFT-based calculation or knowledge of the
structure of the material. We present a scheme for improving the performance of
simple regression and classification models by partitioning the dataset into
multiple clusters. A new evaluation scheme for comparing the performance of
ML-based models in material sciences involving both regression and
classification tasks is introduced based on traditional evaluation metrics. It
is shown that on this new evaluation metric, our method of clustering the
dataset results in better performance.

<br>
</p><i>Chang-Yan Wang, Yan He</i>
<p>The Uhlmann phase is a generalization of the celebrated Berry phase, and can
characterize topological properties at finite temperature and for mixed states.
In this paper, we investigate the Uhlmann phase of Bose-Einstein Condensates at
finite temperature, which are quantum systems with rich and diverse phenomena.
Using the $SU(1,1)$ symmetry of Bogoliubov Hamiltonian, we derive a general
formula of Uhlmann phase for BEC and numerically show that it can differ from
the Berry phase in zero-temperature limit, in contrast to previous studies on
Uhlmann phase. We also find that the Uhlmann phase exhibits a winding behavior
as the temperature increases, and relate the total winding degree to the Berry
phase. This winding behavior indicates that the Uhlmann phase takes values in a
Riemann surface. We further propose a scheme to measure the Uhlmann phase of
BEC experimentally based on purification of the density matrix using an atomic
interferometer.

<p>The deliberate manipulation of ammonium persulfate, methylenebisacrylamide,
dimethyleacrylamide, and polyethylene oxide concentrations resulted in the
development of a hydrogel with an exceptional stretchability, capable of
extending up to 260 times its original length. This study aims to elucidate the
molecular architecture underlying this unique phenomenon by exploring potential
reaction mechanisms, facilitated by an artificial intelligence prediction
system. Artificial intelligence predictor introduces a novel approach to
interlinking two polymers, involving the formation of networks interconnected
with linear chains following random chain scission. This novel configuration
leads to the emergence of a distinct type of hydrogel, herein referred to as a
"Span Network." Additionally, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is
used to investigate functional groups that may be implicated in the proposed
mechanism, with ester formation confirmed among numerous hydroxyl end groups
obtained from chain scission of PEO and carboxyl groups formed on hydrogel

<p>Magnetic vortices are topological spin structures frequently found in
ferromagnets, yet novel to antiferromagnets. By combining experiment and
theory, we demonstrate that in a nanostructured antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic
NiO(111)-Fe(110) bilayer, a magnetic vortex is naturally stabilized by
magnetostatic interactions in the ferromagnet and is imprinted onto the
adjacent antiferromagnet via interface exchange coupling. We use micromagnetic
simulations to construct a corresponding phase diagram of the stability of the
imprinted antiferromagnetic vortex state. Our in depth analysis reveals that
the interplay between interface exchange coupling and the antiferromagnet
magnetic anisotropy plays a crucial role in locally reorienting the N\'eel
vector out-of-plane in the prototypical in-plane antiferromagnet NiO and
thereby stabilizing the vortices in the antiferromagnet.

<h3>Bending-Rotation coupling in the viscoelasticity of semi-flexible  polymers -- Rigorous perturbation analysis from the rod limit</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05173" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05173</a>
<br>
</p><i>Zhongqiang Xiong, Ryohei Seto, Masao Doi</i>
<p>Brownian motion and viscoelasticity of semi-flexible polymers is a subject
that has been studied for many years. Still, rigorous analysis has been
hindered due to the difficulty in handling the constraint that polymer chains
cannot be stretched along the contour. Here, we show a straightforward method
to solve the problem. We consider a stiff polymer that has a persistent length
$L_p$ much larger than the contour length $L$. We express the polymer
configuration using three types of variables: the position vector of the center
of mass $R_c$, the unit vector $n$ along the main axis, and the normal
coordinates $u_p$ for bending. Solving the Smoluchowski equation for the
distribution function of these variables, we calculate the equilibrium time
correlation function $ \langle P(t)\cdot P(0) \rangle$ of the end-to-end vector
$P$ and the complex modulus $G^*(\omega)$ of dilute solution. They include the
bending effect to the first order in $\theta \equiv L/L_p$ and reduce to the
exact results for the rigid rod in the limit of $\theta \to 0$. The rotational
diffusion coefficient increases slightly by the semi-flexibility because the
equilibrium length of the semi-flexible polymer is smaller than that of the
rigid rod with the same contour length. The storage modulus shows the same
asymptotic dependence $G'(\omega) \sim \omega^{3/4}$ predicted by Shankar,
Pasquali, and Morse [J. Rheol. 2002, 46, 1111--1154]. The high-frequency
viscosity is predicted to be dependent on the thickness of the semi-flexible
polymers.

<h3>Quantum-critical properties of the one- and two-dimensional random  transverse-field Ising model from large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations</h3>

<p>We study the ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model with quenched
disorder at $T = 0$ in one and two dimensions by means of stochastic series
expansion quantum Monte Carlo simulations using a rigorous zero-temperature
scheme. Using a sample-replication method and averaged Binder ratios, we
determine the critical shift and width exponents $\nu_\mathrm{s}$ and
$\nu_\mathrm{w}$ as well as unbiased critical points by finite-size scaling.
Further, scaling of the disorder-averaged magnetisation at the critical point
is used to determine the order-parameter critical exponent $\beta$ and the
critical exponent $\nu_{\mathrm{av}}$ of the average correlation length. The
dynamic scaling in the Griffiths phase is investigated by measuring the local
susceptibility in the disordered phase and the dynamic exponent $z'$ is
extracted. By applying various finite-size scaling protocols, we provide an
extensive and comprehensive comparison between the different approaches on
equal footing. The emphasis on effective zero-temperature simulations resolves
several inconsistencies in existing literature.

<p>We report the physical properties of ThRu$_3$Si$_2$ featured with distorted
Ru kagome lattice. The combined experiments of resistivity, magnetization and
specific heat reveal bulk superconductivity with $T_{\rm{c}}$ = 3.8 K. The
specific heat jump and calculated electron-phonon coupling indicate a moderate
coupled BCS superconductor. In comparison with LaRu$_3$Si$_2$, the calculated
electronic structure in ThRu$_3$Si$_2$ shows an electron-doping effect with
electron filling lifted from 100 meV below flat bands to 300 meV above it. This
explains the lower superconducting transition temperature and weaker electron
correlations observed in ThRu$_3$Si$_2$. Our work suggests the $T_{\rm{c}}$ and
electronic correlations in kagome superconductor could have intimate connection
with the flat bands.

<h3>Chemical Reactions regulated by Phase-Separated Condensates</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Sudarshana Laha, Jonathan Bauermann, Frank Jülicher, Thomas C.T. Michaels, Christoph A. Weber</i>
<p>Phase-separated liquid condensates can spatially organize and thereby
regulate chemical processes. However, the physicochemical mechanisms underlying
such regulation remain elusive as the intramolecular interactions responsible
for phase separation give rise to a coupling between diffusion and chemical
reactions at non-dilute conditions. Here, we derive a theoretical framework
that decouples the phase separation of scaffold molecules from the reaction
kinetics of diluted clients. As a result, phase volume and client partitioning
coefficients become control parameters, which enables us to dissect the impact
of phase-separated condensates on chemical reactions. We apply this framework
to two chemical processes and show how condensates affect the yield of
reversible chemical reactions and the initial rate of a simple assembly
process. In both cases, we find an optimal condensate volume at which the
respective chemical reaction property is maximal. Our work can be applied to
experimentally quantify how condensed phases alter chemical processes in
systems biology and unravel the mechanisms of how biomolecular condensates
regulate biochemistry in living cells.

<h3>Spin-1/2 string correlations and singlet-triplet gaps of frustrated  ladders with ferromagnetic (F) legs and alternate F and AF rungs</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05238" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05238</a>

<p>The frustrated ladder with alternate ferromagnetic(F) exchange $-J_F$ and AF
exchange $J_A$ to first neighbors and F exchange $-J_L$ to second neighbors is
studied by exact diagonalization (ED) and density matrix renormalization group
(DMRG) calculations in systems of $2N$ spins-1/2 with periodic boundary
conditions. The ground state is a singlet $(S = 0)$ and the singlet-triplet gap
$\varepsilon_T$ is finite for the exchanges considered. Spin-1/2 string
correlation functions $g_1(N)$ and $g_2(N)$ are defined for an even number $N$
of consecutive spins in systems with two spins per unit cell; the ladder has
string order $g_2(\infty)> 0$ and $g_1(\infty) = 0$. The minimum $N^*$ of
$g_2(N)$ is related to the range of ground-state spin correlations. Convergence
to $g_2(\infty)$ is from below, and $g_1(N)$ decreases exponentially for $N
\geq N^*$. Singlet valence bond (VB) diagrams account for the size
dependencies. The frustrated ladder at special values of $J_F$, $J_L$ and $J_A$
reduces to well-known models such as the spin-1 Heisenberg antiferromagnet and
the $J_1-J_2$ model, among others. Numerical analysis of ladders matches
previous results for spin-1 gaps or string correlation functions and extends
them to spin-1/2 systems. The nondegenerate singlet ground state of ladder is a
bond-order wave, a Kekul\'e VB diagrams at $J_L = J_F/2 \leq J_A$, that is
reversed on interchanging $-J_F$ and $J_A$. Inversion symmetry is spontaneously
broken in the dimer phase of the $J_1-J_2$ model where the Kekul\'e diagrams
are the doubly degenerate ground states at $J_2/J_1 = 1/2$.

<h3>Non-additivity in many-body interactions between membrane-deforming  spheres increases disorder</h3>

<p>Membrane-induced interactions have been predicted to be important for the
organization of membrane proteins. Measurements of the interactions between two
and three membrane deforming objects have revealed their non-additive nature.
They are thought to lead to complex many-body effects, however, experimental
evidence is lacking to date. We here present an experimental method to measure
many-body effects in membrane-mediated interactions using colloidal spheres
placed between a deflated giant unilamellar vesicles and a planar substrate.
The thus confined colloidal particles cause a large deformation of the membrane
while not being physochemically attached to it and interact through it. Two
particles are found to attract with a maximum force of 0.2~pN. For three
particles, we observe a preference for forming compact equilateral triangles
over a linear arrangement. We use numerical energy minimization to establish
that the attraction stems from a reduction in the membrane-deformation energy
caused by the particles. Confining up to 36 particles, we find a preference for
hexagonally close packed clusters. However, with increasing number of particles
the order of the confined particles decreases, while at the same time,
diffusivity of the particles increases. Our experiments for the first time show
that the non-additive nature of membrane-mediated interactions affects the
interactions and arrangements and ultimately leads to spherical aggregates with
liquid-like order of potential importance for cellular processes.

<h3>Closely piling up of multiple adhesive fronts in adhesive friction due  to re-attachment</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Puyu Cao, Meicheng Yao, Bin Chen</i>
<p>To understand why the adhesive frictional force was in linear proportion to
the real contact area in experiments, we investigate the adhesive friction
generated by sliding elastic solids adhered to a rigid surface via multiple
adhesive springs. Our results indicate that the shear-off force of the
interface increases with the energetically guided re-attachment rate of
adhesive springs, reaching saturation at high re-attachment rates. Remarkably,
this shear-off force can surpass the predictions made by the fracture theory.
By plotting the adhesive forces along the interface, we observe substantial
high adhesive forces distributed throughout the interface, based on which we
identify multiple adhesive fronts closely piling up along the interface. These
regions can exhibit similar force profiles, and their number appears to
increase with the size of the interface, leading to a linear increase in the
calculated shear-off force with the size of the interface. We then suggest that
multiple adhesive fronts closely pile up to back up each other in adhesive
friction due to re-attachments, which may provide profound insights into
understanding the observed phenomena associated with adhesive friction along an
interface.

<br>
</p><i>João S. Silva, Miguel Gonçalves, Eduardo V. Castro, Pedro Ribeiro, Miguel A. N. Araújo</i>
<p>Weyl nodal loop semimetals are gapless topological phases that, unlike their
insulator counterparts, may be unstable to small perturbations that respect
their topology-protecting symmetries. Here, we analyze a clean system perturbed
by chiral off-diagonal disorder using numerically exact methods. We establish
that the ballistic semimetallic phase is unstable towards the formation of an
unconventional topological diffusive metal hosting topological multifractal
surface states. Although, as in the clean case, surface states are
exponentially localized along the direction perpendicular to the nodal loop,
disorder induces a multifractal structure in the remaining directions.
Surprisingly, the number of these states also increases with a small amount of
disorder. Eventually, as disorder is further increased, the number of surface
states starts decreasing. In the strong disordered regime we predict that some
types of disorder induce an Anderson transition into an electrically-polarized
insulator whose signature may be detected experimentally.

<p>Nanoscale semiconductors with isolated spin impurities have been touted as
promising materials for their potential use at the intersection of quantum,
spin, and information technologies. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
studies of spins in semiconducting carbon nanotubes have overwhelmingly focused
on spins more strongly localized by $\rm sp^3$-type lattice defects. However,
the creation of such impurities is irreversible and requires specific reactions
to generate them. Shallow charge impurities, on the other hand, are more
readily and widely produced by simple redox chemistry, but have not yet been
investigated for their spin properties. Here we use EPR to study p-doped (6,5)
semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes (s-SWNTs) and elucidate the role of
impurity-impurity interactions in conjunction with exchange and correlation
effects for the spin behavior of this material. A quantitative comparison of
the EPR signals with phenomenological modeling combined with configuration
interaction electronic structure calculations of impurity pairs shows that
orbital overlap, combined with exchange and correlation effects, causes the EPR
signal to disappear due to spin entanglement for doping levels corresponding to
impurity spacings of $14\,\rm nm$ (at 30 K). This transition is predicted to
shift to higher doping levels with increasing temperature and to lower levels
with increasing screening, providing an opportunity for improved spin control
in doped s-SWNTs.

Here, the deformation and failure behavior of NiAl-Al$_2$O$_3$ interfaces and
their components, metal and ceramic, are analyzed in depth using molecular
statics calculations. A number of atomistic simulations of strength tests,
uniaxial tensile, uniaxial compressive and simple shear, have been performed in
order to obtain a set of stiffness tensors and strain-stress characteristics up
to failure for 30 different crystalline and amorphous systems. Characteristic
points on the strain-stress curves in the vicinity of failure are further
analyzed at the atomistic level, using local measures of lattice disorder.
Numerical results are discussed in the context of composite damage at upper
microscopic scale based on images of the fracture surface of NiAl-Al$_2$O$_3$

anisotropic crystal structures; examples include so different systems as a
few-layer black phoshphorus (phosphorene), beryllium nitride BeN$_4$, van der
Waals magnet CrSBr, rhenium dichalgogenides ReX$_2$. As a consequence, their
optical and electronic properties turn out to be highly anisotropic as well. In
some cases, the anisotropy results not just in a smooth renormalization of
observable properties in comparison with the isotropic case but in the
appearance of dramatically new physics. The examples are hyperbolic plasmons
and excitons, strongly anisotropic ordering of adatoms at the surface of
two-dimensional or van der Waals materials, essential change of transport and
superconducting properties. Here, we present a systematic review of electronic
structure, transport and optical properties of several representative groups of
anisotropic two-dimensional materials including semiconductors, anisotropic

<p>We study the effect of quasiperiodic and periodic onsite potentials in a
Hatano-Nelson model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping. By considering a
non-reciprocal next-nearest-neighbour hopping and a quasiperiodic onsite
potential under periodic boundary conditions, we show a breakdown of the
typical correspondence between the delocalization-localization and complex-real
transitions as a function of the potential strength. Moreover, we reveal that
in the delocalized regime, when the potential strength increases, the
eigenstates under OBC exhibit a bipolar non-Hermitian skin effect, i.e., they
tend to localize on both the edges instead of localizing on either of the
edges. However, when a periodic onsite potential is considered, the system not
only exhibits a bipolar skin effect, but also shows a complete direction
reversal of the skin effect as a function of the onsite periodic potential.

<p>The exchange bias phenomenon, inherent in exchange-coupled ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic systems, has intrigued researchers for decades. Van der Waals
materials, with their layered structure, provide an optimal platform for
probing such physical phenomena. However, achieving a facile and effective
means to manipulate exchange bias in pristine van der Waals heterostructures
remains challenging. In this study, we investigate the origin of exchange bias
in MnPS3/Fe3GeTe2 van der Waals heterostructures. Our work demonstrates a
method to modulate unidirectional exchange anisotropy, achieving an
unprecedented nearly 1000% variation through simple thermal cycling. Despite
the compensated interfacial spin configuration of MnPS3, magneto-transport
measurements reveal a huge 170 mT exchange bias at 5 K, the largest observed in
pristine van der Waals antiferromagnet-ferromagnet interfaces. This substantial
magnitude of the exchange bias is linked to an anomalous weak ferromagnetic
ordering in MnPS3 below 40 K. On the other hand, the tunability of exchange
bias during thermal cycling is ascribed to the modified arrangement of
interfacial atoms and changes in the vdW gap during field cooling. Our findings
highlight a robust and easily adjustable exchange bias in van der Waals
antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic heterostructures, presenting a straightforward
approach to enhance other interface related spintronic phenomena for practical
applications.

<p>Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) has become an important measurement tool
for characterizing the thermal properties of materials at the nanometer scale.
This technique requires a SThM probe that combines an Atomic Force Microscopy
(AFM) probe and a very sensitive resistive thermometry; the thermometer being
located at the apex of the probe tip allows the mapping of temperature or
thermal properties of nanostructured materials with very high spatial
resolution. The high interest of the SThM technique in the field of thermal
nanoscience currently suffers from a low temperature sensitivity despite its
high spatial resolution. To address this challenge, we developed a high
vacuum-based AFM system hosting a highly sensitive niobium nitride (NbN) SThM
probe to demonstrate its unique performance. As a proof of concept, we utilized
this custom-built system to carry out thermal measurements using the 3$\omega$
method. By measuring the $V_{3\omega}$ voltage on the NbN resistive thermometer
in vacuum conditions we were able to determine the SThM probe's thermal
conductance and thermal time constant. The performance of the probe is
demonstrated by doing thermal measurements in-contact with a sapphire sample.

<p>Using the initial-value formulation, a dynamic theory for systems evolving
according to a Generalized Langevin Equation is developed, providing more
restrictive conditions on the existence of equilibrium behavior and its
fluctuation-dissipation implications. For systems fulfilling the property of
local realizability,
that for all the practical purposes corresponds to the postulate of the
existence of a Markovian embedding, physical constraints, expressed in the form
of dissipative stability and stochastic realizability are derived. If these two
properties are met, Kubo theory is constructively recovered, while if one of
these conditions is violated a thermodynamic equilibrium behavior does not
exist (and this occurs also for `` well-behaved dissipative systems'' according
to the classical Kubo theory), with significant implications in the linear
response theory.

<h3>3d-oxide molecules to tailor large magnetic anisotropy energies on MgO  films</h3>

<p>Designing systems with large magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) is desirable
and critical for nanoscale magnetic devices. A recent breakthrough achieved the
theoretical limit of the MAE for 3$d$ transition metal atoms by placing a
single Co atom on a MgO(100) surface, a result not replicated by standard
first-principles simulations. Our study, incorporating Hubbard-$U$ correction
and spin-orbit coupling, successfully reproduces and explains the high MAE of a
Co adatom on a MgO (001) surface. We go further by exploring ways to enhance
MAE in 3d transition metal adatoms through different structural geometries of
3d--O molecules on MgO. One promising structure, with molecules perpendicular
to the surface, enhances MAE while reducing substrate interaction, minimizing
spin fluctuations, and boosting magnetic stability. Additionally, we
demonstrate significant control over MAE by precisely placing 3d--O molecules
on the substrate at the atomic level.

<h3>On the ergodicity breaking in well-behaved Generalized Langevin  Equations</h3>

<p>The phenomenon of ergodicity breaking of stochastic dynamics governed by
Generalized Langevin Equations (GLE) in the presence of well-behaved
exponentially decaying dissipative memory kernels, recently investigated by
many authors (Phys. Rev. E {\bf 83} 062102 2011; Phys. Rev. E {\bf 98} 062140
2018; Eur. Phys. J. B {\bf 93} 184 2020),
finds, in the dynamic theory of GLE, its simple and natural explanation,
related to the concept of dissipative stability. It is shown that the
occurrence of ergodicity breakdown for well-behaved dissipative kernels falls,
in general, ouside the region of stochastic realizability, and therefore it
cannot be observed in physical systems.

<h3>Chlorine and zinc co-doping effects on the electronic structure and  optical properties of γ-CuI</h3>

<p>The effects of chlorine (Cl) and zinc (Zn) co-doping on the electronic
structure and optical properties of the zinc blende ({\gamma}) phase of copper
iodide ({\gamma}-CuI) scintillator material are investigated by using
first-principles density functional theory calculations. The band structure,
density of states, dielectric function, absorption coefficients, and
reflectivity were analyzed before and after doping. Results show co-doping
significantly modifies the band structure, reduces the band gap, and generates
impurity energy levels. Cl doping enhances absorption in the high energy region
while reducing visible light absorption. Zn doping induces a redshift in
absorption and n-type conductivity at high concentrations. With suitable
co-doping ratios, the absorption coefficient and reflectivity of {\gamma}-CuI
can be optimized in the visible range to improve scintillation light yield. The
calculations provide guidance for co-doping {\gamma}-CuI scintillators to
achieve superior detection performance. The n-type conductivity also makes
doped {\gamma}-CuI promising for optoelectronic applications.

<h3>Observation of Topological Hall Effect and Skyrmions in Pt/Co/Ir/Co/Pt  System</h3>

</p><i>Shaktiranjan Mohanty, Brindaban Ojha, Minaxi Sharma, Subhankar Bedanta</i>
<p>The interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) between two ferromagnetic (FM) layers
separated by a non-magnetic (NM) spacer layer gives rise to different types of
coupling with the variation of spacer layer thickness. When the NM is metallic,
the IEC is attributed to the well known Ruderman Kittel Kasuya Yosida (RKKY)
interaction which shows an oscillatory decaying nature with increasing
thickness. Due to this, it is possible to tune the coupling between the two FM
to be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic. In this work we have studied a
Pt/Co/Ir/Co/Pt system where the Co thickness has been taken in the strong
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy regime which is much less than the spin
reorientation transition thickness. By tuning the Ir thickness to 2.0 nm, a
canted state of magnetization reversal in the system is observed which gives
rise to a possibility of nucleating topologically non trivial spin textures
like skyrmions. Further, with the combination of transport and magnetic force
microscopy (MFM) measurements, we have confirmed the presence of skyrmions in
our system. These findings may be useful for potential applications in emerging
spintronic and data storage technologies using skyrmions.

<h3>Quasiparticle band structure and excitonic optical response in V2O5 bulk  and monolayer</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05473" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05473</a>

</p><i>Claudio Garcia, Santosh Kumar Radha, Swagata Acharya, Walter R. L. Lambrecht</i>
<p>The electronic band structure of V$_2$O$_5$ is calculated using an
all-electron quasiparticle self-consistent (QS) $GW$ method, including
electron-hole ladder diagrams in the screening of $W$. The optical dielectric
function calculated with the Bethe-Salpeter equation exhibits excitons with
large binding energy, consistent with spectroscopic ellipsometry data and other
recent calculations. Sharp peaks in the direction perpendicular to the layers
at high energy are found to be an artifact of the truncation of the numbers of
bands included in the BSE calculation of the macroscopic dielectric function.
The $\varepsilon_1(\omega=0)$ gives indices of refraction in good agreement
with experiment. The excitons are charge transfer excitons with the hole
primarily on oxygen and electrons on vanadium, but depending on which exciton,
the distribution over different oxygens changes. The exciton wave functions
have a spread of about 5-15\AA, with asymmetric character for the electron
distribution around the hole depending on which oxygen the hole is fixed at.
The monolayer quasiparticle gap increases inversely proportional to interlayer
distance once the initial interlayer covalent couplings are removed which is
thanks to the long-range nature of the self-energy and the reduced screening in
a 2D system. The optical gap on the other hand is relatively independent of
interlayer spacing because of the compensation between the self-energy gap
shift and the exciton binding energy, both of which are proportional to the
screened Coulomb interaction $\hat{W}$. Recent experimental results on very
thin layer V$_2$O$_5$ obtained by chemical exfoliation provide experimental
support for an increase in gap.

<h3>Standard energy function for grain boundary orientation fundamental zone</h3>

<p>The success of grain boundary (GB) orientation fundamental zone (FZ) has
connected GB structures across multiple crystallographic characters with their
properties in a unique insight, but quantitative understandings of the
structure-property relationship in the FZ are still lacking yet. Here, a
theoretical derivation is proposed to transfer the well-known Read-Shockley
relationship to the 3D FZ to form a standard energy function, which is proven
to capture the simulated energy trends in a simple and accurate manner. The
theorization therefore provides a basis for the establishment of modern GB
energy functions.

<h3>Nonlinear Hall effect from long-lived valley-polarizing relaxons</h3>

</p><i>Jae-Mo Lihm, Cheol-Hwan Park</i>
<p>The nonlinear Hall effect has attracted much attention due to the famous,
widely adopted interpretation in terms of the Berry curvature dipole in
momentum space. Using \textit{ab initio} Boltzmann transport equations, we find
a 60\% enhancement in the nonlinear Hall effect of $n$-doped GeTe and its
noticeable frequency dependence, qualitatively different from the predictions
based on the Berry curvature dipole. The origin of these differences is
long-lived valley polarization in the electron distribution arising from
electron-phonon scattering. Our findings await immediate experimental
confirmation.

</p><i>Monirul Shaikh, Duo Wang, Saurabh Ghosh</i>
<p>Commencing from the centrosymmetric MnRMnSbO$_6$ compound, we explore the
realm of magnetic polar double-double perovskite oxides characterized by
significant ferroelectric polarization. Employing symmetry operations,
first-principles methodologies, and Monte Carlo simulations, our investigation
delves into the structural, magnetic, ferroelectric, and electronic attributes
of the polar LaFeMnNiO$_6$ and LaTiMnNiO$_6$ compounds. The structural analysis
uncovers that the paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition is intricately
linked to the Fe/Ti-displacement of square planar Fe/TiO$_4$. Notably, the
magnetic LaFeMnNiO$_6$ and LaTiMnNiO$_6$ compounds demonstrate robust
ferroelectric polarizations, measuring 20.0 $\mu$C/cm$^2$ and 21.8
$\mu$C/cm$^2$, respectively, accompanied by minimalist forbidden energy gaps of
1.40 eV and 1.18 eV using the GGA+U method. Furthermore, we pinpoint elevated
magnetic transition temperatures for these compounds. Additionally, our study
scrutinizes the energies associated with diverse spin configurations and
identifies potential minimum decomposition pathways into stable oxides. This
comprehensive analysis ensures the meticulous formation of the LaFeMnNiO$_6$
and LaTiMnNiO$_6$ compounds.

<h3>Bond Dipole Theory of Band Offset</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05509" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05509</a>
<br>
</p><i>Zeyu Jiang, Damien West, Shengbai Zhang</i>
<p>Understanding the band offset between materials is pivotal for electronic
device functionality. While traditional theories attribute this offset solely
to intrinsic properties of constituent materials, interfacial chemistry
introduces complexities, including charge transfer dipoles. We address this
challenge by defining a reference system based on Wigner-Seitz atoms, which is
a charge partitioning that tessellates space while retaining bulk crystal
symmetry. The interfacial dipole is then expressed entirely by localized
dipoles along interfacial bonds. Geometric analysis reveals that for isotropic
materials, both bulk and interfacial contributions to the band offset are
orientation independent. This finding is confirmed through first-principles
calculations and analysis of 28 distinct interfaces, which show very little (<
0.1 eV) dependence on orientation. Furthermore, the direction dependence of
anisotropic materials is well captured by the theory. This work provides
crucial insights into the geometric underpinnings of band offset, offering a
comprehensive understanding essential for advancing materials design in
electronic applications.

<p>First principle DFT simulations are employed to study structural and
mechanical properties of orthorhombic B12-based metal carbide-borides. The
simulations predict the existence of Ca- and Sr- based phases with the
structure similar to that of experimentally observed earlier compound
MeC$_2$B$_{12}$. Dynamical stability of both phases is demonstrated, and the
phase MeC$_2$B$_{12}$ is found to be thermodynamically stable. According to
simulations, Ca- and Sr- based phases have significantly enhanced mechanical
characteristics, which suggest their potential application as superhard
materials. Calculated shear and Young moduli of these phases are nearly 250 and
540 GPa, respectively, and estimated Vickers hardness is 45-55 GPa.

<h3>Anomalous Hall Crystals in Rhombohedral Multilayer Graphene II: General  Mechanism and a Minimal Model</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05522" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05522</a>
<br>
</p><i>Tomohiro Soejima, Junkai Dong, Taige Wang, Tianle Wang, Michael P. Zaletel, Ashvin Vishwanath, Daniel E. Parker</i>
<p>We propose a minimal "three-patch model" for the anomalous Hall crystal
(AHC), a topological electronic state that spontaneously breaks both
time-reversal symmetry and continuous translation symmetry. The proposal for
this state is inspired by the recently observed integer and fractional quantum
Hall states in rhombohedral multilayer graphene at zero magnetic field. There,
interaction effects appear to amplify the effects of a weak moir\'e potential,
leading to the formation of stable, isolated Chern bands. It has been further
shown that Chern bands are stabilized in mean field calculations even without a
moir\'e potential, enabling a realization of the AHC state. Our model is built
upon the dissection of the Brillouin zone into patches centered around high
symmetry points. Within this model, the wavefunctions at high symmetry points
fully determine the topology and energetics of the state. We extract two
quantum geometrical phases of the non-interacting wavefunctions that control
the stability of the topologically nontrivial AHC state. The model predicts
that the AHC state wins over the topological trivial Wigner crystal in a wide
range of parameters, and agrees very well with the results of full
self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations of the rhombohedral multilayer
graphene Hamiltonian.

<p>Spatially resolved relative phase measurement of two adjacent 1D Bose gases
is enabled by matter-wave interference upon free expansion. However,
longitudinal dynamics is typically ignored in the analysis of experimental
data. We provide an analytical formula showing a correction to the readout of
the relative phase due to longitudinal expansion and mixing with the common
phase. We numerically assess the error propagation to the estimation of the
gases' physical quantities such as correlation functions and temperature. Our
work characterizes the reliability and robustness of interferometric
measurements, directing us to the improvement of existing phase extraction
methods necessary to observe new physical phenomena in cold-atomic quantum
simulators.
