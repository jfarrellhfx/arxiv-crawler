<h3>New classical integrable systems from generalized  $T\Bar{T}$-deformations</h3>

<i>Benjamin Doyon, Friedrich Hübner, Takato Yoshimura</i>
<p>We introduce and study a novel class of classical integrable many-body
systems obtained by generalized $T\Bar{T}$-deformations of free particles.
Deformation terms are bilinears in densities and currents for the continuum of
charges counting asymptotic particles of different momenta. In these models,
which we dub ``semiclassical Bethe systems'' for their link with the dynamics
of Bethe ansatz wave packets, many-body scattering processes are factorised,
and two-body scattering shifts can be set to an almost arbitrary function of
momenta. The dynamics is local but inherently different from that of known
classical integrable systems. At short scales, the geometry of the deformation
is dynamically resolved: either particles are slowed down (more space
available), or accelerated via a novel classical particle-pair
creation/annihilation process (less space available). The thermodynamics both
at finite and infinite volumes is described by the equations of (or akin to)
the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, and at large scales generalized hydrodynamics
emerge.

<h3>Time & its analytical definition: overcoming inconsistencies of previous  results</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06299" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06299</a>
<br>
<i>Umberto Lucia</i>
<p>Recently, a thermodynamic definition of time has been introduced. This
definition is useful to find approach some open problems in physics. But, it
was obtained by a phenomenological approach and a logical inconsistency appears
in the definition. In particular, the definition was based on the ratio of two
quantities, the entropy production and its rate, linked one another just by the
definition of time. In this paper, this inconsistency is overcome, by using the
second law of thermodynamics and Barbour's mathematical methods, obtaining an
analytical result that brings to the same equation of the phenomenological
method, but without any logical inconsistency.

<h3>Crossover from dynamical percolation class to directed percolation class  on a two dimensional lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06306" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06306</a>
<br>
<i>M. Ali Saif</i>
<p>We study the crossover phenomena from the dynamical percolation class (DyP)
to the directed percolation class (DP) in the model of diseases spreading,
Susceptible-Infected-Refractory-Susceptible (SIRS) on a two-dimensional
lattice. In this model, agents of three species S, I, and R on a lattice react
as follows: $S+I\rightarrow I+I$ with probability $\lambda$, $I\rightarrow R$
after infection time $\tau_I$ and $R\rightarrow I$ after recovery time
$\tau_R$. Depending on the value of the parameter $\tau_R$, the SIRS model can
be reduced to the following two well-known special cases. On the one hand, when
$\tau_R \rightarrow 0$, the SIRS model reduces to the SIS model. On the other
hand, when $\tau_R \rightarrow \infty$ the model reduces to SIR model. It is
known that, whereas the SIS model belongs to the DP universality class, the SIR
model belongs to the DyP universality class. We can deduce from the model
dynamics that, SIRS will behave as an SIS model for any finite values of
$\tau_R$. SIRS will behave as SIR only when $\tau_R=\infty$. Using Monte Carlo
simulations we show that as far as the $\tau_R$ is finite the SIRS belongs to
the DP university class. We also study the phase diagram and analyze the
scaling behavior of this model along the critical line. By numerical simulation
and analytical argument, we find that the crossover from DyP to DP is described
by the crossover exponent $1/\phi=0.67(2)$.

<h3>Scale dependence of distributions of hotspots</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06308" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06308</a>
<br>
<i>Michael Wilkinson, Boris Veytsman</i>
<p>We consider a random field $\phi(\mathbf{r})$ in $d$ dimensions which is
largely concentrated around small `hotspots', with `weights', $w_i$. These
weights may have a very broad distribution, such that their mean does not
exist, or else is not a useful estimate. In such cases, the median $\overline
W$ of the total weight $W$ in a region of size $R$ is an informative
characterisation of the weights. We define the function $F$ by $\ln \overline
W=F(\ln R)$. If $F'(x)>d$, the distribution of hotspots is dominated by the
largest weights. In the case where $F'(x)-d$ approaches a constant positive
value when $R\to \infty$, the hotspots distribution has a type of
scale-invariance which is different from that of fractal sets, and which we
term \emph{ultradimensional}. The form of the function $F(x)$ is determined for
a model of diffusion in a random potential.

<i>S. A. Alavi</i>
<p>We calculate the corrections due to noncommutativity of space on the
Hamiltonian and then partition function of the canonical ensemble. We study
some basic features of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics including
equipartition and virial theorem and energy fluctuations: correspondence with
microcanonical ensemble, in the framework of non-commutative canonical
ensemble. The corrections imposed by noncommutativity of space are derived and
the results are discussed.

<h3>Relaxation to persistent currents in a Hubbard trimer coupled to  fermionic baths</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06331" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06331</a>
<br>
<i>Nikodem Szpak, Gernot Schaller, Ralf Schützhold, Jürgen König</i>
<p>We consider a ring of fermionic quantum sites, modeled by the Fermi-Hubbard
Hamiltonian, in which electrons can move and interact strongly via the Coulomb
repulsion. The system is coupled to fermionic cold baths which by the exchange
of particles and energy induce relaxation in the system. We eliminate the baths
and describe the system effectively by the Lindblad master equations in various
versions valid for different coupling parameter regimes. The early relaxation
phase proceeds in a universal way, irrespective of the relative couplings and
approximations. The system settles down to its low-energy sector and is
consecutively well approximated by the Heisenberg model. In the late
relaxation, different Lindblad approaches push the system towards different
final states with opposite, extreme spin orders, from ferromagenetic to
antiferromagnetic. Due to spin frustration in the trimer (a three site ring),
degenerate ground states are formed by spin waves (magnons). The system
described by the global coherent version of the Lindblad operators relaxes
towards the final states carrying directed persistent spin currents. We
numerically confirm these predictions.

<h3>Deconfined Quantum Criticality in the long-range, anisotropic Heisenberg  Chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06350" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06350</a>
<br>
<i>Anton Romen, Stefan Birnkammer, Michael Knap</i>
<p>Deconfined quantum criticality describes continuous phase transitions that
are not captured by the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. Here, we investigate
deconfined quantum critical points in the long-range, anisotropic Heisenberg
chain. With matrix product state simulations, we show that the model undergoes
a continuous phase transition from a valence bond solid to an antiferromagnet.
We extract the critical exponents of the transition and connect them to an
effective field theory obtained from bosonization techniques. We show that
beyond stabilizing the valance bond order, the long-range interactions are
irrelevant and the transition is well described by a double frequency
sine-Gordon model. We propose how to realize and probe deconfined quantum
criticality in our model with trapped-ion quantum simulators.

<h3>Spontaneous dipolar Bose-Einstein condensation on the surface of a  cylinder</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06370" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06370</a>
<br>
<i>Luis E. Young-S., S. K. Adhikari</i>
<p>We demonstrate the spontaneous formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
of strongly-bound harmonically-trapped dipolar $^{164}$Dy atoms on the outer
curved surface of an elliptical or a circular cylinder, with a distinct
topology, employing the numerical solution of an improved mean-field model
including a Lee-Huang-Yang-type interaction, meant to stop a collapse at high
atom density, the axis of the cylindrical-shell-shaped BEC being aligned along
the polarization direction of the dipolar atoms. These states are dynamically
stable and a Gaussian initial state leads to the cylindrical-shell-shaped state
in both imaginary-time and real-time propagation. The formation of the hollow
cylindrical BEC by a real-time simulation starting from a solid cylindrical
state demonstrate the possibility of the formation of such a condensate
experimentally.

<h3>Experimental investigation of Lord Kelvins isentropic cooling and  heating expression in tensile bars for two engineering alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06371" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06371</a>
<br>
<i>S. J. Burns, C. E. Pratt, J. Carrock, J-P Gagnon, A. B. Sefkow</i>
<p>Solids when rapidly and elastically stressed change temperature, the effect
proposed by Lord Kelvin is adiabatic thermo-elastic cooling or heating
depending on the sign of the stress. A fast sensitive IR camera has measured
temperature both decreasing and increasing. Temperature measurements made from
the reversible, elastic part of the stress-strain curve during fast uniaxial
tensile loading have been investigated. The isentropic temperature cooling from
the loading curve is recovered by heating after the specimen fractures when the
load is released. These measurements establish for the first time isentropic
thermal recovery in two engineering alloys. The materials tested are an AISI
4340 steel and an aluminum 2024 alloy. Measurements of the isentropic
thermo-elastic stress cooling are -0.61 K/GPa for steel and -1.7 K/GPa for
aluminum alloy. The isentropic thermo-elastic stress heating is -1.16 K/GPa for
steel and -1.6 K/GPa for aluminum alloy. The isentropic, elastic part of the
temperature is fully recoverable even after extensive plastic deformation upon
fracture.

<h3>Vibrational Properties of One-Dimensional Disordered Hyperuniform Atomic  Chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06389" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06389</a>
<br>
<i>Houlong Zhuang, Duyu Chen, Lei Liu, Ge Zhang, Yang Jiao</i>
<p>Disorder hyperuniformity (DHU) is a recently discovered exotic state of
many-body systems that possess a hidden order in between that of a perfect
crystal and a completely disordered system. Recently, this novel DHU state has
been observed in a number of quantum materials including amorphous 2D graphene
and silica, which are endowed with unexpected electronic transport properties.
Here, we numerically investigate 1D atomic chain models, including perfect
crystalline, disordered hyperuniform as well as randomly perturbed atom packing
configurations to obtain a quantitative understanding of how the unique DHU
disorder affects the vibrational properties of these low-dimensional materials.
We find that the DHU chains possess lower cohesive energies compared to the
randomly perturbed chains, implying their potential reliability in experiments.
Our inverse partition ratio (IPR) calculations indicate that the DHU chains can
support fully delocalized states just like perfect crystalline chains over a
wide range of frequencies, i.e., $\omega \in (0, 100)$ cm$^{-1}$, suggesting
superior phonon transport behaviors within these frequencies, which was
traditionally considered impossible in disordered systems. Interestingly, we
observe the emergence of a group of highly localized states associated with
$\omega \sim 200$ cm$^{-1}$, which is characterized by a significant peak in
the IPR and a peak in phonon density of states at the corresponding frequency,
and is potentially useful for decoupling electron and phonon degrees of
freedom. These unique properties of DHU chains have implications in the design
and engineering of novel DHU quantum materials for thermal and phononic
applications.

<h3>Construction of Multi-Dimensional Functions for Optimization of  Additive-Manufacturing Process Parameters</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06398" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06398</a>
<br>
<i>Baldur Steingrimsson, Ankur Agrawal, Xuesong Fan, Anand Kulkarni, Dan Thoma, Peter Liaw</i>
<p>The authors present a generic framework for parameter optimization of
additive manufacturing (AM) processes, one tailored to a high-throughput
experimental methodology (HTEM). Given the large number of parameters, which
impact the quality of AM-metallic components, the authors advocate for
partitioning the AM parameter set into stages (tiers), based on their relative
importance, modeling one tier at a time until successful, and then
systematically expanding the framework. The authors demonstrate how the
construction of multi-dimensional functions, based on neural networks (NN), can
be applied to successfully model relative densities and Rockwell hardness
obtained from HTEM testing of the Inconel 718 superalloy fabricated, using a
powder-bed approach. The authors analyze the input data set, assess its
suitability for predictions, and show how to optimize the framework for the
multi-dimensional functional construction, such as to obtain the highest degree
of fit with the input data. The novelty of the research work entails the
versatile and scalable NN framework presented, suitable for use in conjunction
with HTEM, for the AM parameter optimization of superalloys, and beyond.

<h3>Fitting multiple small-angle scattering datasets simultaneously: on the  optimal use of priors and weights</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06408" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06408</a>
<br>
<i>Andreas Haahr Larsen</i>
<p>Small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS and SANS) are powerful
techniques for elucidating the structure of diverse particles and materials.
This study address the challenge of effectively combining SAXS and SANS data
for accurate structural parameter determination. Surprisingly, our results
demonstrate that equally weighting all data points leads to the most accurate
parameter estimation, even when SAXS data significantly outnumber SANS data. We
compared this approach with weighting schemes normalized by the number of
points and by the derived information content. Furthermore, we assessed the
impact of prior knowledge by incorporating Gaussian priors for model
parameters. Our findings indicate that Gaussian priors improve the accuracy of
refined parameter values compared to uniform priors. When using a minimum and a
maximum values for model parameters, which is common practice, uniform priors
are implicitely applied. Finally, we show that utilizing information content
aids in determining the degrees of freedom, enabling accurate calculation of
the goodness of fit. In conclusion, this research provides valuable insights
into the optimal combination of SAXS and SANS data, emphasizing the importance
of weighting schemes and prior knowledge for enhanced accuracy in structural
parameter determination.

<h3>Acid-induced gelation of carboxymethylcellulose solutions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06410" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06410</a>
<br>
<i>Gauthier Legrand, Guilhem P. Baeza, Matteo Peyla, Lionel Porcar, Carlos Fernandez-de-Alba, Sébastien Manneville, Thibaut Divoux</i>
<p>The present work offers a comprehensive description of the acid-induced
gelation of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), a water-soluble derivative of
cellulose broadly used in numerous applications ranging from food packaging to
biomedical engineering. Linear viscoelastic properties measured at various pH
and CMC contents allow us to build a sol-gel phase diagram, and show that CMC
gels exhibit broad power-law viscoelastic spectra that can be rescaled onto a
master curve following a time-composition superposition principle. These
results demonstrate the microstructural self-similarity of CMC gels, and
inspire a mean-field model based on hydrophobic inter-chain association that
accounts for the sol-gel boundary over the entire range of CMC content under
study. Neutron scattering experiments further confirm this picture and suggest
that CMC gels comprise a fibrous network crosslinked by aggregates. Finally,
low-field NMR measurements offer an original signature of acid-induced gelation
from the solvent perspective. Altogether, these results open avenues for
precise manipulation and control of CMC-based hydrogels.

<h3>Structure of liquid--vapor interfaces: perspectives from liquid state  theory, large-scale simulations, and potential grazing-incidence X-ray  diffraction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06425" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06425</a>
<br>
<i>Felix Höfling, Siegfried Dietrich</i>
<p>Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) is a scattering technique which
allows one to characterize the structure of fluid interfaces down to the
molecular scale, including the measurement of the surface tension and of the
interface roughness. However, the corresponding standard data analysis at
non-zero wave numbers has been criticized as to be inconclusive because the
scattering intensity is polluted by the unavoidable scattering from the bulk.
Here we overcome this ambiguity by proposing a physically consistent model of
the bulk contribution which is based on a minimal set of assumptions of
experimental relevance. To this end, we derive an explicit integral expression
for the background scattering, which can be determined numerically from the
static structure factors of the coexisting bulk phases as independent input.
Concerning the interpretation of GIXRD data inferred from computer simulations,
we account also for the finite sizes of the bulk phases, which are unavoidable
in simulations. The corresponding leading-order correction beyond the dominant
contribution to the scattered intensity is revealed by asymptotic analysis,
which is characterized by the competition between the linear system size and
the X-ray penetration depth in the case of simulations. Specifically, we have
calculated the expected GIXRD intensity for scattering at the planar
liquid--vapor interface of Lennard-Jones fluids with truncated pair
interactions via extensive, high-precision simulations. The reported data cover
interfacial and bulk properties of fluid states along the whole liquid--vapor
coexistence line. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates the robustness of our
findings concerning the detailed definition of the mean interface position. We
conclude that previous claims of an enhanced surface tension at mesoscopic
scales are amenable to unambiguous tests via scattering experiments.

<h3>Orbital Hall Conductivity in Bilayer Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06447" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06447</a>
<br>
<i>Sovan Ghosh, Bheema Lingam Chittari</i>
<p>We investigate the orbital Hall conductivity in bilayer graphene (G/G), by
modifying one of the layer as Haldane type with the next nearest neighbour
(NNN) hopping strength and flux. The Haldane flux in one of the layer breaks
the time reversal symmetry in both the layers and induces the gap opening at
the Dirac points $K$ and $K'$ points. It is observed that the low energy
isolated bands show large orbital magnetization and induce the Hall potential
for opposite magnetic polarization under the external fields, thereby
contribute to the orbital Hall conductivity (OHC). The self-rotation of the
isolated electrons in their respective orbits leads to strong orbital angular
momentum, which is more fundamental in non-magnetic materials. The observed OHC
is similar to the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). Moreover, the orbital
magnetization with opposite sign among the occupied states adds up to the
higher OHC in the gap, whereas the AHC get vanishes. We further show the
results of bilayer graphene with both the layers as Haldane type ($\rm \tilde
G/ \tilde G$), and found that the OHC behaves similar to AHC which indicate
that, the OHC is strongly depends on the band dispersion. Similarly, we show
that in the heterobilayers with one of the layer is Haldane type generates the
orbital magnetization and induces the OHC. It is concluded that, the isolated
bands in Graphene bilayers with external stimuli are of orbital nature and show
orbital ferromagnetism in the valleys in BZ.

<h3>A Reduced Dimensional Monte Carlo Method: Preliminary Integrations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06478" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06478</a>
<br>
<i>Jarod Tall, Steven Tomsovic</i>
<p>A technique for reducing the number of integrals in a Monte Carlo calculation
is introduced. For integrations relying on classical or mean-field trajectories
with local weighting functions, it is possible to integrate analytically at
least half of the integration variables prior to setting up the particular
Monte Carlo calculation of interest, in some cases more. Proper accounting of
invariant phase space structures shows the system's dynamics is reducible into
composite stable and unstable degrees of freedom. Stable degrees of freedom
behave locally in the reduced dimensional phase space exactly as an analogous
integrable system would. Classification of the unstable degrees of freedom is
dependent upon the degree of chaos present in the dynamics. The techniques for
deriving the requisite canonical coordinate transformations are developed and
shown to block diagonalize the stability matrix into irreducible parts. In
doing so, it is demonstrated how to reduce the amount of sampling directions
necessary in a Monte Carlo simulation. The technique is illustrated by
calculating return probabilities and expectation values for different dynamical
regimes of a two-degree-of-freedom coupled quartic oscillator within a
classical Wigner method framework.

<h3>Classification of spin Hall effect in two-dimensional systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06494" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06494</a>
<br>
<i>Longjun Xiang, Fuming Xu, Luyang Wang, Jian Wang</i>
<p>Physical properties such as the conductivity are usually classified according
to the symmetry of the underlying system using Neumann's principle, which gives
an upper bound for the number of independent components of the corresponding
property tensor. However, for a given Hamiltonian, this global approach usually
can not give a definite answer on whether a physical effect such as spin Hall
effect (SHE) exists or not. It is found that the parity and types of spin-orbit
interactions (SOIs) are good indicators that can further reduce the number of
independent components of the spin Hall conductivity for a specific system. In
terms of the parity as well as various Rashba-like and Dresselhaus-like SOIs,
we propose a local approach to classify SHE in two-dimensional (2D) two-band
models, where sufficient conditions for identifying the existence or absence of
SHE in all 2D magnetic point groups are presented.

<h3>Angular-momentum modes in a bosonic condensate trapped in the  inverse-square potential</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06507" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06507</a>
<br>
<i>Hidetsugu Sakaguchi, Boris A. Malomed</i>
<p>In the mean-field approximation, the well-known effect of the critical
quantum collapse in a 3D gas of particles pulled to the center by potential
U(r) = -U_0/r^2 is suppressed by repulsive interparticle interactions, which
create the otherwise non-existing s-wave ground state. Here, we address excited
bound states carrying angular momentum, with the orbital and magnetic quantum
numbers, l and m. They exist above a threshold value of the potential's
strength, U_0 > l(l+1). The sectoral, tesseral, and zonal modes, which
correspond to m = l, 0 < m < l, and m = 0, respectively, are found in an
approximate analytical form for relatively small values of U_0 - l(l+1).
Explicit results are produced for the p- and d-wave states, with l = 1 and 2,
respectively. In the general form, the bound states are obtained numerically,
confirming the accuracy of the analytical approximation.

<h3>Tunable interfacial chemisorption with atomic-level precision in a  graphene WSe2 heterostructure</h3>

<br>
<i>Mo-Han Zhang, Fei Gao, Aleksander Bach Lorentzen, Ya-Ning Ren, Ruo-Han Zhang, Xiao-Feng Zhou, Rui Dong, Shi-Wu Gao, Mads Brandbyge, Lin He</i>
<p>It has long been an ultimate goal to introduce chemical doping at the atomic
level to precisely tune properties of materials. Two-dimensional materials have
natural advantage because of its highly-exposed surface atoms, however, it is
still a grand challenge to achieve this goal experimentally. Here, we
demonstrate the ability to introduce chemical doping in graphene with
atomic-level precision by controlling chemical adsorption of individual Se
atoms, which are extracted from the underneath WSe2, at the interface of
graphene-WSe2 heterostructures. Our scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
measurements, combined with first-principles calculations, reveal that
individual Se atoms can chemisorbed on three possible positions in graphene,
which generate distinct pseudospin-mediated atomic-scale vortices in graphene.
We demonstrate that the chemisorbed positions of individual Se atoms can be
manipulated by STM tip, which enables us to achieve atomic-scale controlling
quantum interference of the pseudospin-mediated vortices in graphene. This
result offers the promise of controlling properties of materials through
chemical doping with atomic-level precision.

<br>
<i>Enrico Masoero</i>
<p>The microstructure of materials evolves through chemical reactions and
mechanical stress, often strongly coupled in phenomena such as pressure
solution or crystallization pressure. This article presents MASKE: a simulator
to address the challenge of modelling coupled chemo-mechanical processes in
microstructures. MASKE represents solid phases as agglomerations of particles
whose off-lattice displacements generate mechanical stress through interaction
potentials. Particle precipitation and dissolution are sampled using Kinetic
Monte Carlo, with original reaction rate equations derived from Transition
State Theory and featuring contributions from mechanical interactions.
Molecules in solution around the solid are modelled implicitly, through
concentrations that change during microstructural evolution and define the
saturation indexes for user-defined chemical reactions. The structure and
implementation of the software are explained first. Then, two examples on a
nanocrystal of calcium hydroxide address its chemical equilibrium and its
mechanical response under a range of imposed strain rates, involving
stress-driven dissolution and recrystallization. These examples highlight
MASKE's distinctive ability to simulate strongly coupled chemo-mechanical
processes. MASKE is available, open-source, on GitHub.

striking properties in the fields of non-Hermitian physics. Unique physical
phenomena related to the NHSE have attracted a lot of interest, however, their
experimental realizations usually require nonreciprocal hopping, which faces a
great challenge in ultracold-atom systems. In this work, we propose to realize
the NHSE in a 1D optical lattice by periodically-driven ultracold atoms in the
presence of staggered atomic loss. By studying the effective Floquet
Hamiltonian in the high-frequency approximation, we reveal the underlying
mechanism for the periodic-driving-induced the NHSE. We found that the robust
NHSE can be tuned by driving phase, which is manifested by the dynamical
localization. Most remarkably, we uncover the periodic-driving-induced critical
skin effect for two coupled chains with different driving phases, accompanied
by the appearance of size-dependent topological in-gap modes. Our studies
provide a feasible way for observing the NHSE and exploring corresponding
unique physical phenomena due to the interplay of non-Hermiticity and many-body
statistics in ultracold-atom systems.

<h3>Guidelines for Material Design in Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells</h3>

<br>
<i>Karen Forberich, Alessandro Troisi, Chao Liu, Michael Wagner, Christoph J. Brabec, Hans-Joachim Egelhaaf</i>
<p>Organic solar cells (OSCs) are uniquely suited for semitransparent
applications due to their adjustable absorption spectrum. However, most
high-performance semitransparent cells reported to date are based on materials
that have shown high power conversion efficiency for opaque devices. We
therefore present a model to assess the optimum efficiency and transparency for
a specific donor and acceptor band gap. The absorption characteristics of both
donor and acceptor are modeled with spectral data of typical absorber materials
from the literature which are adjusted to achieve the desired band gap value.
The results show three distinct regions of high light utilization efficiency if
the photopic curve is employed as a weighting function (corresponding to window
applications), and a broad maximum for the plant action spectrum as a weighting
function (corresponding to greenhouse applications). When comparing these
findings to reported experimental values, it is evident that the band gaps of
the materials used for the experimental studies do not correspond to the maxima
identified by our simulation model. The analysis of the energy levels of
molecules recorded in the literature confirms that all band gaps and therefore
all LUE maxima are chemically feasible so that the performance of
semitransparent OSCs can be further improved by designing materials with
optimized absorption spectra.

<h3>Six-component pairing instability in the SU(4) $t$-$J$ chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06601" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06601</a>
<br>
<i>Jia-Cheng He, Jun-Hao Zhang, Jie Lou, Yan Chen</i>
<p>We use the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to study the
SU(4) $t$-$J$ chain. We find that, in addition to the conventional repulsive
Luttinger liquid phase and phase separation, there are two phases in the
attractive Luttinger liquid region dependent on whether the flavor gap is
opened or not. The first with the flavor gap is the molecular superfluid phase
(the SU(4) singlet instability) which is well-known in the attractive SU(4)
Hubbard model ($U<0$). The second without the flavor gap is the superconducting
phase (the six-component pairing instability). Furthermore, the molecular
superfluid instability cannot coexist with the superconducting instability.
This is general in SU($N$) models with $N>2$ and is well demonstrated by the
theoretical analysis based on the phenomenological bosonization results.

<h3>Evidence of Ordering in Cu-Ni Alloys from Experimental Electronic  Entropy Measurements</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06603" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06603</a>
<br>
<i>Jonathan Paras, Antoine Allanore</i>
<p>Phase diagrams exhibiting extended solid-solution and lens-like melting are
often reproduced using ideal solutions, where ideal mixing considers a fully
random configurational entropy of mixing. In the field of irreversible
thermodynamics, experimental measurements of the composition variation of
high-temperature electronic transport and molten-state properties suggest
however a strong role for short-range atomic ordering in these systems. Herein,
measurements of the thermopower and resistivity are reported for Cu-Ni
solid-solutions as a function of temperature and composition. The electronic
transport properties were interpreted with an irreversible thermodynamic
framework, revealing a large electronic contribution to the entropy of mixing.
Through appeal to a cluster model for the configurational entropy that uses the
electronic contribution to inform the existence of ordered associates, we
rationalize such contribution of the electronic entropy with the notion of an
ideal entropy of mixing commonly used to model such systems. These results
suggest that the short range order (S.R.O.) of the atoms plays a significant
role in both the solid and molten states, even when there are no dominant
intermetallic compounds in these alloys.

<i>Willie B. Beeson, Dinesh Bista, Huairuo Zhang, Sergiy Krylyuk, Albert Davydov, Gen Yin, Kai Liu</i>
<p>The vast high entropy alloy (HEA) composition space is promising for
discovery of new material phases with unique properties. We explore the
potential to achieve rare-earth-free high magnetic anisotropy materials in
single-phase HEA thin films. Thin films of FeCoNiMnCu sputtered on thermally
oxidized Si/SiO$_{2}$ substrates at room temperature are magnetically soft,
with a coercivity on the order of 10 Oe. After post-deposition rapid thermal
annealing (RTA), the films exhibit a single face-centered-cubic (fcc) phase,
with an almost 40-fold increase in coercivity. Inclusion of 50 at.% Pt in the
film leads to ordering of a single L1$_{0}$ high entropy intermetallic phase
after RTA, along with high magnetic anisotropy and a 3 orders of magnitude
coercivity increase. These results demonstrate a promising HEA approach to
achieve high magnetic anisotropy materials using RTA.

<h3>Formation of field-induced breakdown precursors on metallic electrode  surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06624" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06624</a>
<br>
<i>Soumendu Bagchi, Evgenya Simakov, Danny Perez</i>
<p>Understanding the underlying factors responsible for higher-than-anticipated
local field enhancements that trigger vacuum breakdown on pristine metal
surfaces is crucial for the development of devices capable of withstanding
intense operational fields. In this study, we investigate the behavior of
nominally flat copper electrode surfaces exposed to electric fields of hundreds
of MV/m. Our novel approach considers curvature-driven diffusion processes to
elucidate the formation of sharp breakdown precursors. To do so, we develop a
mesoscale finite element model that accounts for driving forces arising from
both electrostatic and surface-tension-induced contributions to the free
energy. Our findings reveal a dual influence: surface tension tends to mitigate
local curvature, while the electric field drives mass transport toward regions
of high local field density. This phenomenon triggers the growth of sharper
protrusions, ultimately leading to a rapid enhancement of local fields and,
consequently, system instability. Furthermore, we delineate supercritical and
subcritical regimes across a range of initial surface roughness. Our numerical
results align closely with experimentally reported data, predicting critical
precursor formation fields in the range of 200 MV/m to 500 MV/m.

<h3>Spin transfer exchange torque in ferromagnet/ferromagnet structures made  of half metals with large exchange gaps</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06626" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06626</a>
<br>
<i>V. Shablenko, Ya. B. Bazaliy</i>
<p>Spin torques in magnetic multilayers are produced by spin polarization $P$ of
ferromagnetic (F) layers, and increase with growing $P$. The latter, however,
cannot exceed the $P=1$ value found in half metals. We study the $P=1$ case to
find what other parameters still influence spin torques in this extreme limit.
It is found that the ratio of exchange gap to Fermi energy strongly affects the
properties of the torque. For large values of the gap the magnitude of exchange
spin torque exhibits a sharp peak at very small misalignment angles between
magnetizations. This behavior is found to be linked to a transition between
Ohmic and tunneling transport regimes through the F/F boundary.

<h3>Delays-induced Phase Transitions in Active Matter</h3>

<br>
<i>Fatemeh Pakpour, Tamás Vicsek</i>
<p>We consider the patterns of collective motion emerging when many aligning,
self-propelling units move in two dimensions while interacting through a
repulsive potential and are also subject to delays and random perturbations. In
this approach, delay plays the role analogous to reaction time so that a given
particle is influenced by the information about the velocity and the position
of the other particles in its vicinity with some time delay. To get insight
into the involved complex flows and the transitions between them we use a
simple model allowing, by fine-tuning of its few parameters, the observation
and analysis of behaviours that are less accessible by experiments or analytic
calculations and at the same time make the reproduction of experimental results
possible. We report for the first time about a transition from an ordered,
polarized collective motion to disorder as a function of the increasing time
delay. For a fixed intermediate value of the delay similar transition (from
order to disorder) is obtained as the repulsion radius is increased. Our
simulations show a transition from total polarization to two kinds of states:
fully disordered and a kind of state which is a mixture of patches of fully
disordered motion in the background of orderly moving other particles. The
transition occurs as the delay time is increased and is sharp, indicating that
the nature of this order-disorder transition is either of first-order or is
described by a sharply decreasing linear function. Our model is a simplified
version of a practical situation of quickly growing interest because time
delays are expected to play an increasingly important role when the traffic of
many, densely distributed autonomous drones will move around in a
quasi-two-dimensional air space.

<h3>A brief review of hybrid skin-topological effect</h3>

<br>
<i>Weiwei Zhu, Linhu Li</i>
<p>The finding of non-Hermitian skin effect has revolutionized our understanding
of non-Hermitian topological phases, where the usual bulk-boundary
correspondence is broken and new topological phases specific to non-Hermitian
system are uncovered. Hybrid skin-topological effect (HSTE) is a class of newly
discovered non-Hermitian topological states that simultaneously supports
skin-localized topological edge states and extended bulk states. Here we
provide a brief review of HSTE, starting from different mechanics that have
been used to realize HSTE, including non-reciprocal couplings, onsite
gain/loss, and non-Euclidean lattice geometries. We also review some
theoretical developments closely related to the HSTE, including the concept of
higher-order non-Hermitian skin effect, parity-time symmetry engineering, and
non-Hermitian chiral skin effect. Finally, we summarize recent experimental
exploration of HSTE, including its realization in electric circuits systems,
non-Hermitian photonic crystals, and active matter systems. We hope this review
can make the concept of hybrid-skin effect clearer and inspire new finding of
non-Hermitian topological states in higher dimensional systems.

<h3>Double-Free-Layer Stochastic Magnetic Tunnel Junctions with Synthetic  Antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06642" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06642</a>
<br>
<i>Kemal Selcuk, Shun Kanai, Rikuto Ota, Hideo Ohno, Shunsuke Fukami, Kerem Y. Camsari</i>
<p>Stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions (sMTJ) using low-barrier nanomagnets
have shown promise as fast, energy-efficient, and scalable building blocks for
probabilistic computing. Despite recent experimental and theoretical progress,
sMTJs exhibiting the ideal characteristics necessary for probabilistic bits
(p-bit) are still lacking. Ideally, the sMTJs should have (a) voltage bias
independence preventing read disturbance (b) uniform randomness in the
magnetization angle between the free layers, and (c) fast fluctuations without
requiring external magnetic fields while being robust to magnetic field
perturbations. Here, we propose a new design satisfying all of these
requirements, using double-free-layer sMTJs with synthetic antiferromagnets
(SAF). We evaluate the proposed sMTJ design with experimentally benchmarked
spin-circuit models accounting for transport physics, coupled with the
stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for magnetization dynamics. We find
that the use of low-barrier SAF layers reduces dipolar coupling, achieving
uncorrelated fluctuations at zero-magnetic field surviving up to diameters
exceeding ($D\approx 100$ nm) if the nanomagnets can be made thin enough
($\approx 1$-$2$ nm). The double-free-layer structure retains bias-independence
and the circular nature of the nanomagnets provides near-uniform randomness
with fast fluctuations. Combining our full sMTJ model with advanced transistor
models, we estimate the energy to generate a random bit as $\approx$ 3.6 fJ,
with fluctuation rates of $\approx$ 3.3 GHz per p-bit. Our results will guide
the experimental development of superior stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions
for large-scale and energy-efficient probabilistic computation for problems
relevant to machine learning and artificial intelligence.

<h3>Vortex depinning in a two-dimensional superfluid</h3>

<br>
<i>I-Kang Liu, Srivatsa B. Prasad, Andrew W. Baggaley, Carlo F. Barenghi, Toby S. Wood</i>
<p>We employ the Gross--Pitaevskii theory to model a quantized vortex depinning
from a small obstacle in a two-dimensional superfluid due to an imposed
background superfluid flow. We find that, when the flow's velocity exceeds a
critical value, the vortex drifts orthogonally to the flow before subsequently
moving parallel to it away from the pinning site. The motion of the vortex
around the pinning site is also accompanied by an emission of a spiral-shaped
sound pulse. Through simulations, we present a phase diagram of the critical
flow velocity for vortex depinning together with an empirical formula that
illustrates how the critical velocity increases with the height and width of
the pinning site. By employing a variety of choices of initial and boundary
conditions, we are able to obtain lower and upper bounds on the critical
velocity and demonstrate the robustness of these results.

<h3>First-principles pressure dependent investigation of the physical  properties of KB2H8: a prospective high-TC superconductor</h3>

<br>
<i>Md. Ashraful Alam, F. Parvin, S. H. Naqib</i>
<p>Using the density functional theory (DFT) based first-principles
investigation, the structural, mechanical, hardness, elastic anisotropy,
optoelectronic, and thermal properties of cubic KB2H8 have been studied within
the uniform pressure range of 0 - 24 GPa. The calculated structural parameters
are in good agreement with the previous theoretical work. The compound KB2H8 is
found to be structurally and thermodynamically stable in the pressure range
from 8 GPa to 24 GPa. Single crystal elastic constants Cij and bulk elastic
moduli (B, G and Y) increase systematically with pressure from 8 GPa to 24 GPa.
In the stable phase, KB2H8 is moderately elastically anisotropic and ductile in
nature. The compound is highly machinable and fracture resistant. The Debye
temperature, melting temperature and thermal conductivity increases with
pressure. The results of electronic band structure calculations and optical
parameters at different pressures are consistent with each other. The compound
is optically isotropic. The compound KB2H8 has potential to be used as a very
efficient solar energy reflector. The electronic energy density of states at
the Fermi level decreases systematically with increasing pressure. The same
trend is found for the repulsive Coulomb pseudopotential. Possible relevance of
the studied properties to superconductivity has also been discussed in this
paper.

<h3>Quantum Griffiths singularity in three-dimensional superconductor to  Anderson critical insulator transition</h3>

<i>Shichao Qi, Yi Liu, Ziqiao Wang, Fucong Chen, Qian Li, Haoran Ji, Rao Li, Yanan Li, Jingchao Fang, Haiwen Liu, Fa Wang, Kui Jin, X. C. Xie, Jian Wang</i>
<p>Disorder is ubiquitous in real materials and can have dramatic effects on
quantum phase transitions. Originating from the disorder enhanced quantum
fluctuation, quantum Griffiths singularity (QGS) has been revealed as a
universal phenomenon in quantum criticality of low-dimensional superconductors.
However, due to the weak fluctuation effect, QGS is very challenging to detect
experimentally in three-dimensional (3D) superconducting systems. Here we
report the discovery of QGS associated with the quantum phase transition from
3D superconductor to Anderson critical insulator in a spinel oxide MgTi2O4
(MTO). Under both perpendicular and parallel magnetic field, the dynamical
critical exponent diverges when approaching the quantum critical point,
demonstrating the existence of 3D QGS. Among 3D superconductors, MTO shows
relatively strong fluctuation effect featured as a wide superconducting
transition region. The enhanced fluctuation, which may arise from the mobility
edge of Anderson localization, finally leads to the occurrence of 3D quantum
phase transition and QGS. Our findings offer a new perspective to understand
quantum phase transitions in strongly disordered 3D systems.

<i>Chenrong Liu</i>
<p>Using the cluster Gutzwiller mean-field method, we numerically study the
ground-state phase diagram of the non-hard-core two-component interacting
bosons trapped in a two-leg ladder with and without an artificial magnetic
field. Interestingly, several loophole supercounterfluid (SCF) phases are
observed at a sufficiently small intra- to inter-leg hopping ratio when the
magnetic flux is absent. While if the ratio is not too small, the loophole SCF
phases can be induced by the effect of the magnetic flux as well. Additionally,
we also find that the presence of the magnetic flux leads to an enlargement of
the Mott insulator lobe and the conventional SCF lobe. We hope these results
can improve the understanding of the interplay between lattice gases, gauge
fields, and bosonic ladder systems.

<br>
<i>Marcus Lin, Philseok Kim, Sankara Arunachalam, Rifan Hardian, Solomon Adera, Joanna Aizenberg, Xi Yao, Dan Daniel</i>
<p>Recently, there is much interest in droplet condensation on soft or
liquid/liquid-like substrates. Droplets can deform soft and liquid interfaces
resulting in a wealth of phenomena not observed on hard, solid surfaces (e.g.,
increased nucleation, inter-droplet attraction). Here, we describe a unique
complex collective motion of condensate water droplets that emerges
spontaneously when a solid substrate is covered with a thin oil film. Droplets
move first in a serpentine, self-avoiding fashion before transitioning to
circular motions. We show that this self-propulsion (with speeds in the 0.1-1
mm/s range) is fuelled by the interfacial energy release upon merging with
newly condensed but much smaller droplets. The resultant collective motion
spans multiple length scales from submillimetre to several centimetres, with
potentially important heat-transfer and water-harvesting applications.

<br>
<i>Sumitava Kundu, Kaustav Chakraborty, Avisek Das</i>
<p>We report computational evidence of a new type of disordered phase in
crystals resulting from entropy driven self-assembly of hard convex polyhedra.
The disorder was reflected in the orientations of the anisotropic particles and
not in the positions of the centers of geometry. Despite the lack of order,
particle orientations were not random and exhibited strong correlations. The
correlations were manifested in terms of ``quantized'' rotational motions in a
fixed number of absolute orientations, while maintaining equal populations and
specific measure of pairwise angular differences among the discrete values.
This gave rise to a discretely mobile phase in the low density solid and a
quenched disordered state at high pressure. This finding can be interpreted as
the simplest example of correlated disorder in crystalline materials.

<i>Amin Ebrahimi, Mohammad Sattari, Aravind Babu, Arjun Sood, Gert-willem Römer, Marcel Hermans</i>
<p>Laser beam shaping offers remarkable possibilities to control and optimise
process stability and tailor material properties and structure in laser-based
welding and additive manufacturing. However, little is known about the
influence of laser beam shaping on the complex melt-pool behaviour, solidified
melt-track bead profile and microstructural grain morphology in laser material
processing. A simulation-based approach is utilised in the present work to
study the effects of laser beam intensity profile and angle of incidence on the
melt-pool behaviour in conduction-mode laser melting of stainless steel 316L
plates. The present high-fidelity physics-based computational model accounts
for crucial physical phenomena in laser material processing such as complex
laser-matter interaction, solidification and melting, heat and fluid flow
dynamics, and free-surface oscillations. Experiments were carried out using
different laser beam shapes and the validity of the numerical predictions is
demonstrated. The results indicate that for identical processing parameters,
reshaping the laser beam leads to notable changes in the thermal and fluid flow
fields in the melt pool, affecting the melt-track bead profile and
solidification microstructure. The columnar-to-equiaxed transition is discussed
for different laser-intensity profiles.

<i>Artem Litvinenko, Roman Khymyn, Roman Ovcharov, Johan Åkerman</i>
<p>Time-multiplexed Spinwave Ising Machines (SWIMs) have unveiled a route
towards miniaturized, low-cost, and low-power solvers of combinatorial
optimization problems. While the number of supported spins is limited by the
nonlinearity of the spinwave dispersion, other collective excitations, such as
surface acoustic waves (SAWs), offer a linear dispersion. Here, we demonstrate
an all-to-all, fully FPGA reprogrammable, 50-spin surface acoustic wave-based
Ising machine (SAWIM), using a 50-mm-long Lithium Niobate SAW delay line,
off-the-shelf microwave components, and a low-cost FPGA. The SAWIM can solve
any 50-spin MAX-CUT problem, with arbitrary coupling matrices, in less than 340
$\mu$s consuming only 0.62 mJ, corresponding to close to 3000 solutions per
second and a figure of merit of 1610 solutions/W/s. We compare the SAWIM
computational results with those of a 100-spin optical Coherent Ising machine
and find a higher probability of solution. Moreover, we demonstrate that there
is an optimum overall coupling strength between spins at which the probability
of the exact solution reaches 100%. The SAWIM illustrates the general merits of
solid state wave-based time-multiplexed Ising machines in the microwave domain
as versatile platforms for commercially feasible high-performance solvers of
combinatorial optimization problems.

<h3>Probing the superconducting pairing of the La$_{4}$Be$_{33}$Pt$_{16}$  alloy via muon-spin spectroscopy</h3>

<br>
<i>Tian Shang, Eteri Svanidze, Toni Shirok</i>
<p>We report a study of the superconducting pairing of the noncentrosymmetric
La$_{4}$Be$_{33}$Pt$_{16}$ alloy using muon-spin rotation and relaxation
({\textmu}SR) technique. Below $T_c = 2.4$ K, La$_{4}$Be$_{33}$Pt$_{16}$
exhibits bulk superconductivity (SC), here characterized by heat-capacity and
magnetic-susceptibility measurements. The temperature dependence of the
superfluid density $\rho_\mathrm{sc}(T)$, extracted from the transverse-field
{\textmu}SR measurements, reveals a nodeless SC in La$_{4}$Be$_{33}$Pt$_{16}$.
The best fit of $\rho_\mathrm{sc}(T)$ using an $s$-wave model yields a magnetic
penetration depth $\lambda_0 = 542$ nm and a superconducting gap $\Delta_0 =
0.37$ meV at zero Kelvin. The single-gapped superconducting state is further
evidenced by the temperature-dependent electronic specific heat
$C_\mathrm{e}(T)/T$ and the linear field-dependent electronic specific-heat
coefficient $\gamma_\mathrm{H}(H)$. The zero-field {\textmu}SR spectra
collected in the normal- and superconducting states of
La$_{4}$Be$_{33}$Pt$_{16}$ are almost identical, confirming the absence of an
additional field-related relaxation and, thus, of spontaneous magnetic fields
below $T_c$. The nodeless SC combined with a preserved time-reversal symmetry
in the superconducting state prove that the spin-singlet pairing is dominant in
La$_{4}$Be$_{33}$Pt$_{16}$. This material represents yet another example of a
complex system showing only a conventional behavior, in spite of a
noncentrosymmetric structure and a sizeable spin-orbit coupling.

<i>Eugene M. Chudnovsky, Dmitry A. Garanin</i>
<p>Magnetic order and microwave absorption in amorphous ferromagnets and
materials sintered from nanoscale ferromagnetic grains are investigated
analytically and numerically within the random-anisotropy model. We show that a
scaling argument specific to static randomness allows one to make conclusions
about the behavior of a large system with a weak disorder by studying a smaller
system with a strong disorder. The breakdown of the scaling on increasing the
strength of the magnetic anisotropy and/or the size of the grain separates two
distinct regimes in magnetic ordering and frequency dependence of the absorbed
microwave power. Analytical results are confirmed by numerical experiments on
spin lattices containing up to ten million spins. Our findings should help
design materials with desired magnetic and microwave properties. The method can
be extended to other systems with quenched randomness.

<h3>Adiabatically compressing chiral p-wave Bose-Einstein condensates into  the lowest landau level</h3>

<i>Xinyang Yu, Xingze Qiu, Xiaopeng Li</i>
<p>There has been much recent progress in controlling $p$-orbital degrees of
freedom in optical lattices, for example with lattice shaking, sublattice
swapping, and lattice potential programming. Here, we present a protocol of
preparing lowest Landau level (LLL) states of cold atoms by adiabatically
compressing $p$-orbital Bose-Einstein condensates confined in two-dimensional
optical lattices. The system starts from a chiral $p+ip$ Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) state, which acquires finite angular momentum by spontaneous
symmetry breaking. Such chiral BEC states have been achieved in recent optical
lattice experiments for cold atoms loaded in the $p$-bands. Through an
adiabatic adjustment of the lattice potential, we compress the
three-dimensional BEC into a two-dimensional system, in which the orbital
degrees of freedom continuously morph into LLL states. This process is enforced
by the discrete rotation symmetry of the lattice potential. The final quantum
state inherits large angular momentum from the original chiral $p+ip$ state,
with one quantized unit per particle. We investigate the quantum many-body
ground state of interacting bosons in the LLL considering contact repulsion.
This leads to an exotic gapped BEC state. Our theory can be readily tested in
experiments for the required techniques are all accessible to the current
optical lattice experiments.

<p>We study spin transport in a one-dimensional finite-length wire connected to
fermionic leads. The interacting wire is described by the sine-Gordon model
while the leads are either noninteracting or interacting Luttinger liquids. We
calculate the spin current driven by a spin bias by solving numerically the
classical equation of motion, and find that the cosine term in the sine-Gordon
model gives rise to an oscillating spin current when the spin bias exceeds its
critical value. We discuss the results in connection with transport experiments

virtualization of the chemical process is based on the concept of a chain
reaction that covers a set of elementary reactions (ERs) and is the most
suitable for quantum chemical treatment. The calculations were performed using
a semi-empirical version of the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation. Once
input in the chemical reactor, providing free-radical polymerization of NIPA,
the fullerene C60 inhibits capturing the formed monomer-radicals and terminates
the polymerization. The obtained virtual kinetic data, providing the appearance
of an induction period at the initial stage of the NIPA polymerization, are in
a full agreement with experimental reality.

<h3>Optimal mean first-passage time of a run-and-tumble particle in a  one-dimensional confining potential</h3>

<i>Mathis Gueneau, Satya N. Majumdar, Gregory Schehr</i>
<p>We consider a run-and-tumble particle (RTP), subjected to a telegraphic noise
with a constant rate $\gamma$, and in the presence of an external confining
potential $V(x) = \alpha |x|^p$ with $p \geq 1$. We compute the mean
first-passage time (MFPT) at the origin $\tau_\gamma(x_0)$ for an RTP starting
at $x_0$. We obtain a closed form expression for $\tau_\gamma(x_0)$ for all $p
\geq 1$, which becomes fully explicit in the case $p=1$, $p=2$ and in the limit
$p \to \infty$. For generic $p>1$ we find that there exists an optimal rate
$\gamma_{\rm opt}$ that minimizes the MFPT and we characterize in detail its
dependence on $x_0$. We find that $\gamma_{\rm opt} \propto 1/x_0$ as $x_0 \to
0$, while $\gamma_{\rm opt}$ converges to a nontrivial constant as $x_0 \to
\infty$. In contrast, for $p=1$, there is no finite optimum and $\gamma_{\rm
opt} \to \infty$ in this case. These analytical results are confirmed by our
numerical simulations.

<br>
<i>Samir F. Matar</i>
<p>Based on crystal engineering and density functional theory DFT calculations a
transformational pathway is proposed from qtz (quartz-based) topology
characterized by distorted tetrahedra to dia (diamond-like) regular tetrahedra
topology. The protocol consists of carbon insertions into orthorhombic (space
group P222, No. 16) within C5, C6, and C7, leading to ultimate C8 identified as
diamond-like. The induced structural and physical changes are assessed with
elastic properties pointing to ultra hardness, larger for qtz-C6 than dia-C8,
whilst intermediate C7 is compressible due to its diamond-defective structure.
The dynamic stability was shown from the phonons, and thermodynamic quantities
as the specific heat CV was addressed in comparison with diamond experimental
data. The electronic band structures reveal semi-conducting C6, metallic C7
characterized by diamond-defect structure, and insulating C8.

<p>Hafnia-based nanostructures and other high-k dielectrics are promising
wide-gap materials for developing new opto- and nanoelectronics devices. They
possess a unique combination of physical and chemical properties such as
insensitivity to electrical and optical degradation, radiation damage
stability, a high specific surface area, and an increased concentration of the
appropriate active electron-hole centers. The present paper aims to investigate
the structural, optical, and luminescent properties of anodized
non-stoichiometric $HfO_2$ nanotubes. As-grown amorphous hafnia nanotubes and
nanotubes annealed at 700{\deg}C with a monoclinic crystal lattice served as
samples. It has been shown that the bandgap $E_g$ for direct allowed
transitions amounts to $5.65\pm0.05$ eV for amorphous and $5.51\pm0.05$ eV for
monoclinic nanotubes. For the first time, we have studied the features of the
intrinsic cathodoluminescence and photoluminescence of the obtained nanotubular
$HfO_2$ structures with an atomic deficiency in the anion sublattice at
temperatures of 10 and 300 K. A broad emission band with a maximum of 2.3-2.4
eV has been revealed. We have also conducted an analysis of the kinetic
dependencies of the observed photoluminescence for synthesized $HfO_2$ samples
in the millisecond range at room temperature. It showed that there are several
types of optically active capture and emission centers based on vacancy states
in the $O_{3f}$ and $O_{4f}$ positions with different coordination numbers and
a varied number of localized charge carriers ($V^0$, $V^-$, and $V^{2-}$). The
uncovered regularities can be used to optimize the functional characteristics
of developed-surface luminescent media based on nanotubular and nanoporous
modifications of hafnia.

<h3>Hyperuniformity of Maximally Random Jammed Packings of Hyperspheres  Across Spatial Dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06970" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06970</a>
<br>
<i>Charles Emmett Maher, Yang Jiao, Salvatore Torquato</i>
<p>The maximally random jammed (MRJ) state is the most random configuration of
strictly jammed (mechanically rigid) nonoverlapping objects. MRJ packings are
hyperuniform, meaning their long-wavelength density fluctuations are
anomalously suppressed compared to typical disordered systems, i.e., their
structure factors $S(\mathbf{k})$ tend to zero as the wavenumber $|\mathbf{k}|$
tends to zero. Here, we show that generating high-quality strictly jammed
states for space dimensions $d = 3,4,$ and $5$ is of paramount importance in
ensuring hyperuniformity and extracting precise values of the hyperuniformity
exponent $\alpha > 0$ for MRJ states, defined by the power-law behavior of
$S(\mathbf{k})\sim|\mathbf{k}|^{\alpha}$ in the limit
$|\mathbf{k}|\rightarrow0$. Moreover, we show that for fixed $d$ it is more
difficult to ensure jamming as the particle number $N$ increases, which results
in packings that are nonhyperuniform. Free-volume theory arguments suggest that
the ideal MRJ state does not contain rattlers, which act as defects in
numerically generated packings. As $d$ increases, we find that the fraction of
rattlers decreases substantially. Our analysis of the largest truly jammed
packings suggests that the ideal MRJ packings for all dimensions $d\geq3$ are
hyperuniform with $\alpha = d - 2$, implying the packings become more
hyperuniform as $d$ increases. The differences in $\alpha$ between MRJ packings
and recently proposed Manna-class random close packed (RCP) states, which were
reported to have $\alpha = 0.25$ in $d=3$ and be nonhyperuniform ($\alpha = 0$)
for $d = 4$ and $d = 5$, demonstrate the vivid distinctions between the
large-scale structure of RCP and MRJ states in these dimensions. Our work
clarifies the importance of the link between true jamming and hyperuniformity
and motivates the development of an algorithm to produce rattler-free
three-dimensional MRJ packings.

magnetization data in the normal state of the topological crystalline

breaking previously reported in the superconducting state of this material is
not driven by strong electron correlations.

<h3>Maximum temperature of an ideal gas in thermal equilibrium</h3>

<br>
<i>Hyeong-Chan Kim</i>
<p>We explore thermodynamics of an ideal gas system with heat conduction,
incorporating a model that accommodates heat dependence. Our model is
constructed based on i) the first law of thermodynamics from action formulation
and ii) the existence condition of a (local) Lorentz boost between an Eckart
observer and a Landau-Lifschitz observer--a condition that extends the
stability criterion of thermal equilibrium. The implications of these
conditions include: 1) Heat contributes to the energy density through the
combination $q/n\Theta^2$ where $q$, $n$, and $\Theta$ represent heat, number
density, and temperature, respectively. 2) The energy density exhibits a unique
minumum at $q=0$ with respect to the contribution. 3) Our findings indicate an
upper limit on the temperature of the ideal gas in thermal equilibrium. The
upper limit is governed by the coefficient of the first non-vanishing
contribution of heat around equilibrium to the energy density.

<h3>Free-energy estimates from nonequilibrium trajectories under  varying-temperature protocols</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06997" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06997</a>
<br>
<i>Stephen Whitelam</i>
<p>The Jarzynski equality allows the calculation of free-energy differences
using values of work measured in nonequilibrium trajectories. The number of
trajectories required to accurately estimate free-energy differences in this
way grows sharply with the size of work fluctuations, motivating the search for
protocols that perform desired transformations with minimum work. However,
protocols of this nature can involve varying temperature, to which the
Jarzynski equality does not apply. We derive a variant of the Jarzynski
equality that applies to varying-temperature protocols, and show that it can
have better convergence properties than the standard version of the equality.
We derive this modified equality, and the associated fluctuation relation,
within the framework of Markovian stochastic dynamics, complementing related
derivations done within the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics.

<h3>Topologically Protected Metastable States in Classical Dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07017" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07017</a>
<br>
<i>Han-Qing Shi, Tian-Chi Ma, Hai-Qing Zhang</i>
<p>We propose that the domain walls formed in a classical Ginzburg-Landau model
can exhibit topologically stable but thermodynamically metastable states. This
proposal relies on Allen-Cahn's assertion that the velocity of domain wall at
some point is proportional to the mean curvature at that point. From this
assertion we speculate that domain wall resembles a rubber band that can winds
the background geometry in a nontrivial way and can exist permanently. We
numerically verify our proposal in two and three spatial dimensions by using
periodic boundary conditions as well as Neumann boundary conditions. We find
that there are always possibilities to form topologically stable domain walls
in the final equilibrium states. However, from the aspects of thermodynamics
these topologically nontrivial domain walls have higher free energies and are
thermodynamically metastable. These metastable states that are protected by
topology could potentially serve as storage media in the computer and
information technology industry.

<br>
<i>Zhijie Wang, Susheng Tan, M. Ravi Shankar</i>
<p>Purely mechanically induced mass transport between diamond and transition
metals are investigated using transition thin metal film-deposited AFM tip
scratching and in situ TEM scratching test. Due to the weak strength of the
transition metal-diamond joints and transition metal thin films, AFM scratching
rarely activated the mass transport interaction at the diamond-transition metal
thin film interfaces. In situ TEM scratching tests were performed by using a
Nanofactory STM holder. The interaction at diamond and tungsten interface was
successfully activated by nanoscale in-situ scratching under room temperature.
The lattice structure of diamond and tungsten were characterized by HRTEM. The
stress to activate the interaction was estimated by measuring the interplanar
spacing change of tungsten nanotips before scratching and at the frame that the
interaction was activated.

<h3>When Like Destabilizes Like: Inverted Solvent Effects in Apolar  Nanoparticle Dispersions</h3>

<i>Debora Monego, Thomas Kister, Nicholas Kirkwood, David Doblas, Paul Mulvaney, Tobias Kraus, Asaph Widmer-Cooper</i>
<p>We report on the colloidal stability of nanoparticles with alkanethiol shells
in apolar solvents. Small angle X-ray scattering and molecular dynamics
simulations were used to characterize the interaction between nanoparticles in
linear alkane solvents ranging from hexane to hexadecane, including
\SI{4}{\nano\meter} gold cores with hexadecanethiol shells and
\SI{6}{\nano\meter} cadmium selenide cores with octadecanethiol shells. We find
that the agglomeration is enthalpically driven and that, contrary to what one
would expect from classical colloid theory, the temperature at which the
particles agglomerate increases with increasing solvent chain length. We
demonstrate that the inverted trend correlates with the temperatures at which
the ligands order in the different solvents, and show that the inversion is due
to a combination of enthalpic and entropic effects that enhance the stability
of the ordered ligand state as the solvent length increases. We also explain
why cyclohexane is a better solvent than hexane, despite having very similar
solvation parameters to hexadecane.

<h3>A holistic review on fatigue properties of additively manufactured  metals</h3>

<br>
<i>Min Yi, Wei Tang, Yiqi Zhu, Chenguang Liang, Ziming Tang, Yan Yin, Weiwei He, Shen Sun</i>
<p>Additive manufacturing (AM) technology is undergoing rapid development and
emerging as an advanced technique that can fabricate complex near-net shaped
and light-weight metallic parts with acceptable strength and fatigue
performance. A number of studies have indicated that the strength or other
mechanical properties of AM metals are comparable or even superior to that of
conventionally manufactured metals, but the fatigue performance is still a
thorny problem that may hinder the replacement of currently used metallic
components by AM counterparts when the cyclic loading and thus fatigue failure
dominates. This article reviews the state-of-art published data on the fatigue
properties of AM metals, principally including $S$--$N$ data and fatigue crack
growth data. The AM techniques utilized to generate samples in this review
include powder bed fusion (e.g., EBM, SLM, DMLS) and directed energy deposition
(e.g., LENS, WAAM). Further, the fatigue properties of AM metallic materials
that involve titanium alloys, aluminum alloys, stainless steel, nickel-based
alloys, magnesium alloys, and high entropy alloys, are systematically
overviewed. In addition, summary figures or tables for the published data on
fatigue properties are presented for the above metals, the AM techniques, and
the influencing factors (manufacturing parameters, e.g., built orientation,
processing parameter, and post-processing). The effects of build direction,
particle, geometry, manufacturing parameters, post-processing, and
heat-treatment on fatigue properties, when available, are provided and
discussed. The fatigue performance and main factors affecting the fatigue
behavior of AM metals are finally compared and critically analyzed, thus
potentially providing valuable guidance for improving the fatigue performance
of AM metals.

<h3>Symmetry, topology, duality, chirality, and criticality in a spin-1/2  XXZ ladder with a four-spin interaction</h3>

<br>
<i>Mateo Fontaine, Koudai Sugimoto, Shunsuke Furukawa</i>
<p>We study the ground-state phase diagram of a spin-1/2 XXZ model with a
chirality-chirality interaction (CCI) on a two-leg ladder. This model offers a
minimal setup to study an interplay between spin and chirality degrees of
freedom. The spin-chirality duality transformation allows us to relate the
regimes of weak and strong CCIs. By applying the Abelian bosonization and the
duality, we obtain a rich phase diagram that contains distinct gapped
featureless and ordered phases. In particular, Neel and vector chiral orders
appear for easy-axis anisotropy, while two distinct symmetry protected
topological (SPT) phases appear for easy-plane anisotropy. The two SPT phases
can be viewed as twisted variants of the Haldane phase. We also present an
effective description in terms of (spinor) hard-core bosons, which reveals
critical behavior on the self-dual line in the easy-axis and easy-plane
regimes. We perform numerical simulations to confirm the predicted phase
structure and critical properties. We further demonstrate that the two SPT
phases and a trivial phase are distinguished by topological indices in the
presence of certain symmetries. A similar phase structure is expected in a
spin-1/2 XXZ ladder with four-spin ring exchange.

<p>Control over the optical properties of atomically thin two-dimensional (2D)
layers, including those of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), is needed
for future optoelectronic applications. Remarkable advances have been achieved
through alloying, chemical and electrical doping, and applied strain. However,
the integration of TMDs with other 2D materials in van der Waals
heterostructures (vdWHs) to tailor novel functionalities remains largely
unexplored. Here, the near-field coupling between TMDs and graphene/graphite is
used to engineer the exciton lineshape and charge state. Fano-like asymmetric
spectral features are produced in WS$_{2}$, MoSe$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ vdWHs
combined with graphene, graphite, or jointly with hexagonal boron nitride
(h-BN) as supporting or encapsulating layers. Furthermore, trion emission is
suppressed in h-BN encapsulated WSe$_{2}$/graphene with a neutral exciton
redshift (44 meV) and binding energy reduction (30 meV). The response of these
systems to electron-beam and light probes is well-described in terms of 2D
optical conductivities of the involved materials. Beyond fundamental insights
into the interaction of TMD excitons with structured environments, this study
opens an unexplored avenue toward shaping the spectral profile of narrow
optical modes for application in nanophotonic devices.

<p>We present a novel flipping transfer method for van der Waals
heterostructures, offering a significant advancement over previous techniques
by eliminating the need for polymers and solvents. Instead, we utilize
commercially available gel film and control its stickiness through oxygen
plasma and UV-Ozone treatment, also effectively removing residues from the gel
film surface. The cleanliness of the surface is verified through atomic force
microscopy. We investigate the quality of our fabricated devices using
magnetotransport measurements on graphene/hBN and graphene/{\alpha}-RuCl3
heterostructures. Remarkably,graphene/hBN devices produced with the flipping
method display quality similar to that of fully encapsulated devices. This is
evidenced by the presence of a symmetry-broken state at 1 T. Additionally,
features of the Hofstadter butterfly were also observed in the second devices.
In the case of graphene/{\alpha}-RuCl3, we observe quantum oscillations with a
beating mode and two-channel conduction, consistent with fully encapsulated
devices.

<i>Hong Sun, Yuanying Qiu, Jing Li, Jin Bai, Ming Peng</i>
<p>Machine learning as a data-driven solution has been widely applied in the
field of fatigue lifetime prediction. In this paper, three models for wideband
fatigue life prediction are built based on three machine learning models, i.e.
support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and artificial
neural network (ANN). The generalization ability of the models is enhanced by
employing numerous power spectra samples with different bandwidth parameters
and a variety of material properties related to fatigue life. Sufficient Monte
Carlo numerical simulations demonstrate that the newly developed machine
learning models are superior to the traditional frequency-domain models in
terms of life prediction accuracy and the ANN model has the best overall
performance among the three developed machine learning models.

the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. It is found that a
translational symmetry broken magnetization plateau possibly appears at the
half of the saturation magnetization, when the anisotropies compete with each

<p>Topological superconductors have long been sought for their potential use in
quantum computing. The type-II Weyl semimetal MoTe$_{2}$ is an obvious
candidate, exhibiting a superconducting state below 500 mK at ambient pressure,
but the question remains whether the pairing is conventional $s^{++}$ or
topological $s^{+-}$. The application of external pressure favors the
superconducting state in MoTe$_{2}$ and suppresses the structural transition
from $1T'$ to $T_{d}$. The competition between the two structures leads to a
mixed phase that strongly enhances the disorder present in the system,
remarkably without affecting the superconducting transition temperature, in
contrast to the expectation of $s^{+-}$ pairing superconductivity. Our thorough
analysis of the electrical and Hall resistivities as a function of pressure
yields the most accurate temperature-pressure phase diagram available to date
for MoTe$_{2}$ and a detailed view of the relationship between disorder and
superconductivity, supporting a conventional $s^{++}$ pairing symmetry.

research due to their exotic interlayer coupling. Here, we present a natural
heterojunction superconductor of 6R-TaS2 that demonstrates a double-dome of
superconductivity, in addition to, the reemergence of superconducting under
high pressures. Our first principles calculation shows that the first dome of
superconductivity in 6R-TaS2 can be attributed to changes in interlayer
coupling and charge transfer. The second superconducting dome and the
reemergence of superconductivity can be ascribed to changes in the density of
states resulting from Fermi surface reconstruction, in which the DOS of T-layer
and S p-orbitals play a crucial role. We have reported the first observation in
TMDs that non-metallic atoms playing a dominant role in the reemergence of

<p>Developing novel high-temperature van der Waals ferromagnetic semiconductor
materials and investigating their interface coupling effects with
two-dimensional topological semimetals are pivotal for advancing
next-generation spintronic and quantum devices. However, most van der Waals
ferromagnetic semiconductors exhibit ferromagnetism only at low temperatures,
limiting the proximity research on their interfaces with topological
semimetals. Here, we report an intrinsic, van der Waals layered
room-temperature ferromagnetic semiconductor crystal, FeCr0.5Ga1.5Se4 (FCGS),
with a Curie temperature as high as 370 K, setting a new record for van der
Waals ferromagnetic semiconductors. The saturation magnetization at low
temperature (2 K) and room temperature (300 K) reaches 8.2 emu/g and 2.7 emu/g,
respectively. Furthermore, FCGS possesses a bandgap of approximately 1.2 eV,
which is comparable to the widely used commercial silicon. The FCGS/graphene
heterostructure exhibits an impeccably smooth and gapless interface, thereby
inducing a robust magnetic proximity coupling effect between FCGS and graphene.
After the proximity coupling, graphene undergoes a charge carrier transition
from electrons to holes, accompanied by a transition from non-magnetic to
ferromagnetic transport behavior with robust anomalous Hall effect. Notably,
the anomalous Hall effect remains robust even temperatures up to 400 K.

<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07190" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07190</a>

<p>All-solid-state batteries are currently developed at high pace and show a
strong potential for market introduction within the next years. Though their
performance has improved considerably over the last years, investigation of
their sustainability and the development of suitable recycling strategies have
received less attention. However, their potential for efficient circular
processes must be accessed comprehensively. In this article, we investigate the
separation of the solid electrolyte beta-Li3PS4 from different lithium
transition metal oxide electrode materials (LiCoO2, LiMn2O4,
LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2, LiFePO4, LiNi0.85Co0.1Al0.05O2 and Li4Ti5O12) via an
approach based on the dissolution and subsequent recrystallization of the
thiophosphate using N-methylformamide as solvent. A combination of X-ray
diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, iodometric
titration and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy as well as electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy and electrochemical characterization was used to
characterize the electrolyte and electrode materials before and after
separation. We find that the presence of electrode materials in the dissolution
process can lead to significant chemical reactions. These interactions can (but
most not) lead to strong alteration of the electrochemical characteristics of
the individual compounds. Thus, we show that an efficient recovery of materials
will likely depend on the precise material combination within an
all-solid-state battery.

<h3>Multiple topological phase transitions in magnetic systems: role of  anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07201" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07201</a>
<br>
<i>Shreya Debnath, Saurabh Basu</i>
<p>In this work we study the topological properties of magnons in both
ferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically ordered systems on a
two-dimensional square lattice. While topological features emerge owing to the
violation of time reversal symmetry induced by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI), here we consider an anisotropic DMI and ascertain the role
of the anisotropy parameter on the topological phase transitions. In
particular, our phase plot for the ferromagnetic case demonstrates multiple
topological phase transitions, that is, from a topological phase to another
topological phase, and as well, from a topological phase to a trivial phase. In
the former, the topological invariant, namely the Chern number, discontinuously
changes from one finite value to another ($-1 \rightarrow +1$), while it
vanishes ($1 \rightarrow 0$) in the latter. Further, an extended trivial region
is observed where the DMI is non-zero, which is surprising since DMI is the
origin of the topological gap. The nature of the phases and the phase
transitions, therein are characterized by their band structure, presence (or
absence) of the chiral edge modes, computation of the topological Hall effect,
etc. In contrast, the antiferromagnetic case presents a more predictable
scenario, in the sense, it behaves as a trivial insulator in the absence of
DMI, although demonstrate a topological to trivial phase transition.

<h3>Configuration determination for chiral and polar crystals by anisotropic  NMR shift</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07207" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07207</a>
<br>
<i>Hiroaki Kusunose, Jun Kikuchi</i>
<p>We propose a method to perform a configuration determination for chiral
and/or polar crystals by utilizing anisotropy of NMR shift. The chirality
(handedness) or polarity of a crystal, that is characterized by its sign, can
be extracted from the asymmetric magnetic-field angle dependence of NMR shift
in the appropriate plane, as the configuration is reflected in the off-diagonal
components of the shift tensor. This method is applicable to the triclinic,
monoclinic, and trigonal crystal structures among 230 crystallographic space
groups, and the appropriate planes to extract the asymmetric field-angle
dependence are tabulated for all relevant space groups. We discuss how to
determine the appropriate plane, and to identify each contribution of twin
domains, and so on, by using the specific examples of Te, IrSn$_{4}$ and
RhSn$_{4}$, and the spontaneous symmetry-breaking phases of URhSn. We also
argue that an absolute-configuration determination is also possible in
accordance with the relation between chirality or polarity of crystal and the
sign of the relevant off-diagonal component of the shift tensor, provided by
theoretical evaluation of internal magnetic field from surrounding ions, and/or
by experimental input on the shape of the asymmetric etch pit on the cleaved
face of crystal.

<h3>Bound Bogoliubov quasiparticles in photon superfluids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07228" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07228</a>
<br>
<i>Marzena Ciszak, Francesco Marino</i>
<p>Bogoliubov's description of Bose gases relies on the linear dynamics of
noninteracting quasiparticles on top of a homogeneous condensate. Here, we
theoretically explore the weakly-nonlinear regime of a one-dimensional photon
superfluid in which phonon-like elementary excitations interact via their
backreaction on the background flow. The generalized dispersion relation
extracted from spatiotemporal intensity spectra reveals additional branches
that correspond to bound Bogoliubov quasiparticles -- phase-locked collective
excitations originating from nonresonant harmonic-generation and wave-mixing
processes. These mechanisms are inherent to fluctuation dynamics and highlight
non-trivial scattering channels other than resonant interactions that could be
relevant in the emergence of dissipative and turbulent phenomena in
superfluids.

<br>
<i>M. Pancaldi, P. Vavassori, S. Bonetti</i>
<p>We describe the design of two types of metamaterials aimed at enhancing
terahertz field pulses that can be used to control the magnetic state in
condensed matter systems. The first structure is a so-called "dragonfly"
antenna, able to realize a five-fold enhancement of the impinging terahertz
magnetic field, while preserving its broadband features. For currently
available state-of-the-art table top sources, this leads to peak magnetic
fields exceeding 1 T. The second structure is an octopole antenna aimed at
enhancing a circularly-polarized terahertz electric field, while preserving its
polarization state. We obtain a five-fold enhancement of the electric field,
hence expected to exceed the 1 MV/cm peak amplitude. Both our structures can be
readily fabricated on top of virtually any material.

<h3>Machine learning the Kondo entanglement cloud from local measurements</h3>

<br>
<i>Faluke Aikebaier, Teemu Ojanen, Jose L. Lado</i>
<p>A quantum coherent screening cloud around a magnetic impurity in metallic
systems is the hallmark of the antiferromagnetic Kondo effect. Despite the
central role of the Kondo effect in quantum materials, the structure of quantum
correlations of the screening cloud has defied direct observations. In this
work, we introduce a machine-learning algorithm that allows to spatially map
the entangled electronic modes in the vicinity of the impurity site from
experimentally accessible data. We demonstrate that local correlators allow
reconstructing the local many-body correlation entropy in real-space in a
double Kondo system with overlapping entanglement clouds. Our machine learning
methodology allows bypassing the typical requirement of measuring long-range
non-local correlators with conventional methods. We show that our machine
learning algorithm is transferable between different Kondo system sizes, and we
show its robustness in the presence of noisy correlators. Our work establishes
the potential machine learning methods to map many-body entanglement from
real-space measurements.

<h3>Origin of Incommensurate Magnetic Order in Rare-Earth Magnetic Weyl  Semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07256" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07256</a>
<br>
<i>Juba Bouaziz, Gustav Bihlmayer, Christopher E. Patrick, Julie B. Staunton, Stefan Blügel</i>
<p>We investigate rare-earth magnetic Weyl semimetals through first-principles
simulations, analyzing the connection between incommensurate magnetic order and
the presence of Weyl nodes in the electronic band structure. Focusing on
PrAlSi, NdAlSi, and SmAlSi, we demonstrate that the reported helical ordering
does not originate from the nesting of topological features at the Fermi
Surface or the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Instead, the helical order
arises from frustrated isotropic short-range superexchange between the 4f
moments facilitated by pd-hybridization with the main group elements. Employing
a spin Hamiltonian with isotropic exchange and single-ion anisotropy we
replicate the experimentally observed helical modulation.

<h3>High Rectification Ratio at Room Temperature in Rhenium(I) Compound</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07258" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07258</a>
<br>
<i>Subas Rajbangshi, Nila Pal, Robinur Rahman, Vladimir N. Nesterov, Lisa Roy, Shishir Ghosh, Prakash Chandra Mondal</i>
<p>Electrical current rectification is an interesting electronic feature,
popularly known as a diode. Achieving a high rectification ratio in a molecular
junction has been a long-standing goal in molecular electronics. The present
work describes mimicking electrical current rectification with pi-stacked
rhenium(I) compound sandwiched between two electrical contacts. Among the two
mononuclear rhenium compounds studied here, [Re(CO)4(PPh3){(N)-saccharinate}]
(1) and [Re(CO)3(phen){(N)-saccharinate}] (2), the latter show strong pi-pi
interactions-induced high rectification ratio of ~ 4000 at 2.0 V at room
temperature. Alternating current (AC)-based electrical measurements ensuring AC
to DC electrical signal conversion at a frequency f of 1 KHz showing 2 can act
as an excellent half-wave rectifier. Asymmetric charge injection barrier height
at the electrode/Re(I) interfaces of the devices with a stacking configuration
of p++-Si/Re compound31nm(2)/ITO originates the flow of electrical current
unidirectionally. The charge transport mechanism governed by thermally
activated hopping phenomena, and charge carrier propagation is explained
through an energy profile considering the Fermi levels of two electrodes, and
the energy of frontier molecular orbitals, HOMO, and LUMO, confirming
rectification is of a molecular origin. The present work paves the way to
combine different organometallic compounds as circuit elements in
nanoelectronic devices to achieve numerous exciting electronic features.

<h3>Stability and superconductivity of freestanding two-dimensional  transition metal boridene: M4/3B2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07262" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07262</a>
<br>
<i>Xiaoran Shi, Junfeng Gao, Shi Qiu, Yuan Chang, Luneng Zhao, Zhen-Guo Fu, Jijun Zhao, Ping Zhang</i>
<p>The small atomic mass of boron indicates strong electron-phonon coupling, so
it may have a brilliant performance in superconductivity. Recently, a new 2D
boride sheet with ordered metal vacancies and surface terminals (Mo4/3B2-x) was
realized in experiments (Science 2021, 373, 801). Here, the 2D monolayer
freestanding Mo4/3B2is evidenced to be thermodynamically stable. Through
electronic structure, phonon spectrum and electron-phonon coupling, monolayer
Mo4/3B2 is found to be an intrinsic phonon-mediated superconductor. The
superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is determined to be 4.06 K by the
McMillian-Allen-Dynes formula. Remarkably, the Tc of monolayer Mo4/3B2 can be
increased to 6.78 K with an appropriate biaxial tensile strain (+5%). Moreover,
we predict that other transition metal replacing Mo atoms is also stable and
retaining the superconductivity. Such as monolayer W4/3B2 is also a
superconductor with the Tc of 2.37 K. Our research results enrich the database
of 2D monolayer superconductors and boron-related formed materials science.

<h3>Sumanene monolayer of pure carbon: a two-dimensional Kagome-analogy  lattice with desirable band gap, ultrahigh carrier mobility and strong  exciton binding energy</h3>

<i>Xiaoran Shi, Weiwei Gao, Hongsheng Liu, Zhen-Guo Fu, Gang Zhang, Yong-Wei Zhang, Junfeng Gao, Jijun Zhao</i>
<p>Design and synthesis of novel two-dimensional (2D) materials that possess
robust structural stability and unusual physical properties may open up
enormous opportunities for device and engineering applications. Herein we
propose a 2D sumanene lattice that be regarded as a derivative of the
conventional Kagome lattice. Our tight-binding analysis demonstrates sumanene
lattice contains two sets of Dirac cones and two sets of flat bands near the
Fermi surface, distinctively different from the Kagome lattice. Using
first-principles calculations, we theoretically suggest two possible routines
for realization of stable 2D sumanene monolayers (named as a phase and b
phase), and a-sumanene monolayer can be experimentally synthesized with
chemical vapor deposition using C21H12 as a precursor. Small binding energies
on Au(111) surface signify the possibility of their peel-off after grown on the
noble metal substrate. Importantly, our GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation
calculations demonstrate both monolayers have moderate band gaps (1.94 eV for
a) and ultrahigh carrier mobilities (3.4*104 cm2/Vs for a). In particular,
a-sumanene monolayer possesses a strong exciton binding energy of 0.73 eV,
suggesting potential applications in optics.

<h3>Metallic conductivity on Na-deficient structural domain walls in the  spin-orbit Mott insulator Na$_2$IrO$_3$</h3>

<p>Honeycomb Na$_2$IrO$_3$ is a prototype spin-orbit Mott insulator and Kitaev
magnet. We report a combined structural and electrical resistivity study of
Na$_2$IrO$_3$ single crystals. Laue back-scattering diffraction indicates
twinning with $\pm 120^\circ$ rotation around the $c^*$-axis while scanning
electron microscopy displays nanothin lines parallel to all three b-axis
orientations of twin domains. Energy dispersive x-ray analysis line-scans
across such domain walls indicate no change of the Ir signal intensity, i.e.
intact honeycomb layers, while the Na intensity is reduced down to $\sim 2/3$
of its original value at the domain walls, implying significant hole doping.
Utilizing focused-ion-beam micro-sectioning, the temperature dependence of the
electrical resistance of individual domain walls is studied. It demonstrates
the tuning through the metal-insulator transition into a correlated-metal
ground state by increasing hole doping.

<h3>Microwave-to-Optical Quantum Transduction Utilizing the Topological  Faraday Effect of Topological Insulator Heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07293" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07293</a>
<br>
<i>Akihiko Sekine, Mari Ohfuchi, Yoshiyasu Doi</i>
<p>The quantum transduction between microwave and optical photons is essential
for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to
the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the
transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear
processes. So far, the transduction efficiency $\eta$ via the magneto-optic
Faraday effect (i.e., the light-magnon interaction) in the ferromagnet YIG has
been demonstrated to be small as $\eta\sim 10^{-8} \mathrm{-} 10^{-15}$ due to
the sample size limitation inside the cavity. Here, we take advantage of the
fact that three-dimensional topological insulator thin films exhibit a
topological Faraday effect that is independent of the sample thickness. This
leads to a large Faraday rotation angle and therefore enhanced light-magnon
interaction in the thin film limit. We show theoretically that the transduction
efficiency can be greatly improved to $\eta\sim10^{-4}$ by utilizing the
heterostructures consisting of topological insulator thin films such as
Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and ferromagnetic insulator thin films such as YIG.

<h3>Dynamics of stress propagation in anharmonic crystals: MD simulations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07304" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07304</a>
<br>
<i>Zbigniew Kozioł</i>
<p>Anharmonic inter-atomic potential x^n to power of n, n > 1, has been used in
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of stress dynamics of FCC oriented crystal.
The model of chain of masses and springs is found as a convenient and accurate
description of simulation results, with masses representing the
crystallographic planes. The period of oscillations of two planes is found
analytically to be given by Euler beta functions, and its scaling with
non-linearity parameter and amplitude of oscillations, or applied shear
pressure is discussed on examples of time dependencies of displacement,
velocities, and forces acting on masses (planes). The relationship between
physical quantities (displacement, velocities, pressure) is explained. The
dynamics of stress penetration from the sample surface towards its interior is
confirmed to be given exactly by a series of Bessel functions when n=2 (in
harmonic case). When n <> 2 the stress dynamics (wave propagation) in bulk
material remains qualitatively of the same nature as in the linear case. In
particular, results suggest that the quasi-linear relationship between
frequency and wave number is preserved. Speed of the transverse sound
component, dependent on sound wave amplitude, is found to be a strongly
decreasing function of n. The results are useful in the analysis of any MD
simulations under pressure, as they help to understand the dynamics of pressure
retarded effects, as well help design the proper methodology of performing MD
simulations, such as studies of dynamics of dislocations.

<h3>Role of crystal-field-splitting and longe-range-hoppings on  superconducting pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07316" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07316</a>
<br>
<i>Hongquan Liu, Chengliang Xia, Shengjie Zhou, Hanghui Chen</i>
<p>We study the bilayer two-orbital model for superconducting pairing symmetry
of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure. By combining density-functional-theory
(DFT), maximally-localized-Wannier-function, and linearized Eliashberg equation
with random-phase-approximation, we find that the superconducting pairing
symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is robustly $d_{xy}$ if its DFT band structure is
accurately reproduced in the downfolded model. We further show that fine-tuning
of crystal-field-splitting between two Ni-$e_g$ orbitals qualitatively affects
superconducting pairing symmetry of the bilayer two-orbital model, which
changes from $d_{xy}$ to $s_{\pm}$ as the crystal-field-splitting exceeds a
critical value. When the model only includes nearest-neighbor and
second-nearest-neighbor hoppings, the crystal-field-splitting obtained by
fitting to the DFT band structure is larger than the critical value and thus
leads to $s_{\pm}$ superconducting pairing symmetry. When all nonzero
long-range-hoppings are also included in the model, the fitted
crystal-field-splitting is reduced and smaller than the critical value, which
makes $d_{xy}$ superconducting pairing symmetry more favorable than $s_{\pm}$
symmetry. Our work demonstrates that in downfolded effective models, the
details of band structure can play a crucial role in determining pairing
symmetry in multi-orbital unconventional superconductors (such as
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$).

<h3>Magnetoresistive detection of perpendicular switching in a magnetic  insulator</h3>

<br>
<i>Silvia Damerio, Achintya Sunil, M. Mehraeen, Steven S.-L. Zhang, Can O. Avci</i>
<p>Spintronics offers promising routes for efficient memory, logic, and
computing technologies. The central challenge in spintronics is electrically
manipulating and detecting magnetic states in devices. The electrical control
of magnetization via spin-orbit torques is effective in both conducting and
insulating magnetic layers. However, the electrical readout of magnetization in
the latter is inherently difficult, limiting its use in practical applications.
Here, we demonstrate magnetoresistive detection of perpendicular magnetization
reversal in an electrically insulating ferrimagnet, terbium iron garnet (TbIG).
To do so, we use TbIG|Cu|TbCo, where TbCo is a conducting ferrimagnet and
serves as the reference layer, and Cu is a nonmagnetic spacer. Current
injection through Cu|TbCo allows us to detect the magnetization reversal of
TbIG with a simple resistance readout during an external magnetic field sweep.
By examining the effect of measurement temperature, TbCo composition, and Cu
thickness on the sign and amplitude of the magnetoresistance, we conclude that
the spin-dependent electron scattering at the TbIG|Cu interface is the
underlying cause. Technologically-feasible magnetoresistive detection of
perpendicular switching in a ferrimagnetic garnet is a breakthrough, as it
opens broad avenues for novel insulating spintronic devices and concepts.

<p>The pursuit of discovering new high-temperature superconductors that diverge
from the copper-based paradigm carries profound implications for elucidating
mechanisms behind superconductivity and may also enable new applications. Here,
our investigation reveals that application of pressure effectively suppresses
the spin and charge order in trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 single crystals,
leading to the emergence of superconductivity with a maximum critical
temperature (Tc) exceeding 30 K. In the normal state, we observe a "strange
metal" behavior, characterized by a linear temperature-dependent resistance
extending up to 300 K. These results could be interpreted as the pressure's
influence, inducing damping on the density-wave gap and spin order, while
promoting spin fluctuations and bringing the associated flat dz2 band into
close proximity with the Fermi surface. This, in turn, fosters strong
correlations and "strange metal" behavior, thus setting the stage for the
eventual emergence of superconductivity. Furthermore, the layer-dependent
superconductivity observed hints at a unique interlayer coupling mechanism
specific to nickelates, setting them apart from cuprates in this regard. Our
findings provide crucial insights into the fundamental mechanisms underpinning
superconductivity, while also introducing a new material platform to explore
the intricate interplay between the spin/charge order, flat band structures,
interlayer coupling, strange metal behavior and high-temperature
superconductivity.

<h3>Mid infrared near-field fingerprint spectroscopy of the 2D electron gas  in LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ at low temperatures</h3>

<br>
<i>Julian Barnett, Konstantin G. Wirth, Richard Hentrich, Yasin C. Durmaz, Marc-André Rose, Felix Gunkel, Thomas Taubner</i>
<p>Confined electron systems, such as 2D electron gases (2DEGs), 2D materials,
or topological insulators show great technological promise but their
susceptibility to defects often results in nanoscale inhomogeneities with
unclear origins. Scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy
(s-SNOM) is useful to investigate buried confined electron systems
non-destructively with nanoscale resolution, however, a clear separation of
carrier concentration and mobility was often impossible in s-SNOM. Here, we
predict a previously inaccessible characteristic "fingerprint" response of the
prototypical LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ 2DEG, and verify this using a state-of-the-art
tunable narrow-band laser in mid-infrared cryo-s-SNOM at 8 K. Our modelling
allows us to separate the influence of carrier concentration and mobility on
fingerprint spectra and to characterize 2DEG inhomogeneities on the nanoscale.
This spatially resolved information about the local electronic properties can
be used to identify the origin of inhomogeneities in confined electron systems,
making the s-SNOM fingerprint response a valuable tool for nanoelectronics and
quantum technology.

<br>
<i>Botond Osváth, Gergely Barcza, Örs Legeza, Balázs Dóra, László Oroszlány</i>
<p>Parafermions are anyons with the potential for realizing non-local qubits
that are resilient to local perturbations. Compared to Majorana zero modes,
braiding of parafermions implements an extended set of topologically protected
quantum gates. This, however, comes at the price that parafermionic zero modes
can not be realized in the absence of strong interactions whose theoretical
description is challenging. In the present work, we construct a simple lattice
model for interacting spinful electrons with parafermionic zero energy modes.
The explicit microscopic nature of the considered model highlights new
realization avenues for these exotic excitations in recently fabricated quantum
dot arrays. By density matrix renormalization group calculations, we identify a
broad range of parameters, with well-localized zero modes, whose parafermionic
nature is substantiated by their unique $8\pi$ periodic Josephson spectrum.

<i>Marko Znidaric</i>
<p>We study recently discussed XX spin chain with non-local dephasing
[arXiv:2310.03069] in a steady-state boundary-driven setting, confirming
superdiffusive magnetization transport in the thermodynamic limit. The
emergence of superdiffusion is rather interesting as the Lindblad operators
causing it are a coherent sum of two terms, each of which would separately
cause diffusion. One therefore has a quantum phenomenon where a coherent sum of
two diffusive terms results in superdiffusion. We also study perturbations of
the superdiffusive model, finding that breaking the exact form of dissipators,
as well as adding interactions to the XX chain, results in superdiffusion
changing into diffusion.

<h3>Impact of correlations on topology in Kane-Mele model decorated with  impurities</h3>

<br>
<i>Jan Skolimowski, Carmine Autieri</i>
<p>We propose an effective model for the study of the interplay between
correlation and topology by decorating the Kane-Mele model with a set of
localized interacting orbitals hybridized to just one sublattice, breaking the
inversion symmetry. We show that in the time-reversal symmetric case, the
interplay between interactions and hybridization extends the stability of the
topological phase and depending on the driving mechanism very different
behaviors are observed after the topological phase transition (TPT). We discuss
the fate of the TPT in presence of weak ferromagnetic order, by introducing a
weak local magnetic field at the localized orbitals, which splits the two band
inversion points. One of the platforms to apply this model to are ferrovalley
compounds, which are characterized by two independent band inversion points.
Understanding this family of materials is crucial for the development of the
valleytronics. An alternative to spintronics, which uses valley polarization as
opposed to spin degrees of freedom as the building block, promises great
opportunities for the development of information storage.

<h3>Translocation of a daughter vesicle in a model system of  self-reproducing vesicles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07401" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07401</a>
<br>
<i>Manit Klawtanong, Yuka Sakuma, Masayuki Imai, Toshihiro Kawakatsu, Petch Khunpetch</i>
<p>Translocation of a daughter vesicle from a mother vesicle through a pore is
experimentally studied by many groups using a model system of self-reproducing
vesicles. However, the theoretical formulation of the problem is not fully
understood. In the present study, we present a theoretical formulation of the
process based on our previous work [P. Khunpetch et al., Phys. Fluids 33,
077103 (2021)]. In our previous work, we considered the daughter vesicle as a
rigid body. In the present work, however, we allow the daughter vesicle to
deform during the expulsion process. We thus derive the free energy
constituting of the elastic moduli of both the mother and daughter vesicles,
and of pressure-driven contribution. The minimum energy path of the
translocation is searched by using the string method. Our improved model
successfully suggests the disappearance of the energy barrier where all the
elastic moduli are in agreement with the experimental reports, while the
previous work is unsuccessful to do so. The equations of motion of the daughter
vesicle have been derived within the framework of the Onsager principle. We
found that the translocation time of the daughter vesicle can be reduced when
the pressure inside the mother vesicle increases, or the initial size of the
daughter vesicle decreases.

accounted with the help of the random phase approximation. We observe that the
repulsion between charge carriers located in the same graphene layers is much
larger than that between the electrons moving in different layers (moreover,
under certain circumstances the inter-layer effective interaction becomes
attractive). At zero doping, the intra-layer Coulomb repulsion is responsible
for arising of the spin-density wave (SDW) state. The Neel temperature for this
phase is estimated to be about several tens K. The SDW is the dominating order
in undoped system, but it is destroyed completely by sufficiently strong
doping, allowing a superconducting phase to emerge. As for the superconducting
mechanism, we demonstrate that the effective inter-layer attraction can give
rise to superconductivity. However, the corresponding critical temperature is
negligibly small, and phonon-mediated attraction must be introduced into the
model to make the superconductivity observable. Strong intra-layer Coulomb
repulsion favors the order parameters that couple electrons in different
layers. In this case two different types of the superconducting phase can exist
in the system. The first type is a usual superconductivity with Copper pairs
having zero total momentum in the ground state. Such superconductivity exists
if the coupling between electrons with momenta near different Dirac cones
dominates. When the interaction between electrons near the same Dirac cones is
larger, the Cooper pairs have a non-zero momenta in the ground state.
Superconducting gap can increase or decrease with doping depending on the
relationship between intra-band and inter-band BCS interaction.

<p>Nickelates gained a great deal of attention due to their similar crystal and
electronic structures of cuprates over the past few decades. Recently,
superconductivity with transition temperature exceeding liquid-nitrogen
temperature is discovered in La3Ni2O7, which belong to the Ruddlesden-Popper
(RP) phases Lan+1NinO3n+1 with n = 2. In this work, we go further and find
pressure-induced superconductivity in another RP phase La4Ni3O10 (n = 3) single
crystals. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiment
suggest that the electronic structure of La4Ni3O10 is very similar to that of
La3Ni2O7. We find that the density-wave like anomaly in resistivity is
progressively suppressed with increasing pressure. A typical phase diagram is
obtained with the maximum Tc of 21 Kelvin. Our study sheds light on the
exploration of unconventional superconductivity in nickelates.

<h3>Quantum Phase Transition in $\rm CeCoIn_5$: Experimental Facts and  Theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07428" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07428</a>
<br>
<i>V.R. Shaginyan, A.Z. Msezane, M.V. Zverev, Y.S. Leevik</i>
<p>Condensed-matter community is involved in hot debate on the nature of quantum
critical points (QCP) governing the low-temperature properties of heavy fermion
metals. The smeared jump like behavior revealed both in the residual
resistivity $\rho_0$ and the Hall resistivity $R_H$, along with the violation
of the time invariance symmetry $\mathcal{T}$ and the charge invariance
$\mathcal{C}$, including the violation of quasiparticle-hole symmetry, and
providing vital clues on the origin of both the non-Fermi-liquid behavior and
QCP. For the first time, based on a number of important experimental data, we
show that these experimental observations point out unambiguously that QCP of
$\rm CeCoIn_5$ is accompanied by the symmetry violation, and QCP itself is
represented by the topological fermion-condensation quantum phase transition
(FCQPT) connecting two Fermi surfaces of different topological charges.

<h3>Scalar susceptibility of a diluted classical XY model</h3>

<br>
<i>Reece Beattie-Hauser, Thomas Vojta</i>
<p>We analyze the amplitude fluctuations in a diluted 3D classical XY model near
the magnetic phase transition, motivated by the unusual localization properties
of the amplitude (Higgs) mode recently found at the disordered superfluid-Mott
glass quantum phase transition. We calculate the amplitude correlation function
and the corresponding scalar susceptibility by means of Monte Carlo
simulations. In contrast to the quantum case, in which the scalar
susceptibility was found to violate naive scaling, we find that the scalar
susceptibility of the classical system fulfills naive scaling (employing the
clean critical exponents, as expected from the Harris criterion) as the
temperature is varied across the phase transition for several dilutions. We
discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy as well as the generality of our
findings.

<h3>Temperature effects in topological insulators of transition metal  dichalcogenide monolayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07473" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07473</a>
<br>
<i>Siyu Chen, Isaac J. Parker, Bartomeu Monserrat</i>
<p>We investigate the role of temperature on the topological insulating state of
metal dichalcogenide monolayers, 1T$^\prime$-MX$_2$ (M=W, Mo and X=S, Se).
Using first principles calculations based on density functional theory, we
consider three temperature-related contributions to the topological band gap:
electrons coupling with short-wavelength phonons, with long-wavelength phonons
\textit{via} Fr\"ohlich coupling, and thermal expansion. We find that
electron-phonon coupling promotes the topology of the electronic structures of
all 1T$^\prime$-MX$_2$ monolayers, while thermal expansion acts as a
counteracting effect. Additionally, we derive the band renormalization from
Fr\"ohlich coupling in the two-dimensional context and observe its relatively
modest contribution to 1T$^\prime$-MX$_2$ monolayers. Finally, we present a
simplified physical picture to understand the "inverse Varshni" effect driven
by band inversion in topological insulators. Our work reveals that, among the
four 1T$^\prime$-MX$_2$ studied monolayers, MoSe$_2$ is a promising candidate
for room temperature applications as its band gap displays remarkable
resilience against thermal expansion, while the topological order of WS$_2$ can
be tuned under the combined influence of strain and temperature. Both materials
represent novel examples of temperature promoted topological insulators.

<h3>Biaxial nematic order in fundamental measure theory</h3>

<br>
<i>Anouar El Moumane, Michael te Vrugt, Hartmut Löwen, René Wittmann</i>
<p>Liquid crystals consisting of biaxial particles can exhibit a much richer
phase behavior than their uniaxial counterparts. Usually, one has to rely on
simulation results to understand the phase diagram of these systems, since very
few analytical results exist. In this work, we apply fundamental measure
theory, which allows to derive free energy functionals for hard particles from
first principles and with quantitative accuracy, to systems of hard cylinders,
cones and spherotriangles. We provide a general recipe for incorporating
biaxial liquid crystal order parameters into fundamental measure theory and use
this framework to obtain the phase boundaries for the emergence of
orientational order in the considered systems. Our results provide insights
into the phase behavior of biaxial nematic liquid crystals, and in particular
into methods for their analytical investigation.

<h3>What can we learn from diffusion about Anderson localization of a  degenerate Fermi gas?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07505" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07505</a>
<br>
<i>Sian Barbosa, Maximilian Kiefer-Emmanouilidis, Felix Lang, Jennifer Koch, Artur Widera</i>
<p>Disorder can fundamentally modify the transport properties of a system. A
striking example is Anderson localization, suppressing transport due to
destructive interference of propagation paths. In inhomogeneous many-body
systems, not all particles are localized for finite-strength disorder, and the
system can become partially diffusive. Unravelling the intricate signatures of
localization from such observed diffusion is a long-standing problem. Here, we
experimentally study a degenerate, spin-polarized Fermi gas in a disorder
potential formed by an optical speckle pattern. We record the diffusion in the
disordered potential upon release from an external confining potential. We
compare different methods to analyze the resulting density distributions,
including a new method to capture particle dynamics by evaluating
absorption-image statistics. Using standard observables, such as diffusion
exponent and coefficient, localized fraction, or localization length, we find
that some show signatures for a transition to localization above a critical
disorder strength, while others show a smooth crossover to a modified diffusion
regime. In laterally displaced disorder, we spatially resolve different
transport regimes simultaneously which allows us to extract the subdiffusion
exponent expected for weak localization. Our work emphasizes that the
transition toward localization can be investigated by closely analyzing the
system's diffusion, offering ways of revealing localization effects beyond the
signature of exponentially decaying density distribution.

<h3>Dynamic mode decomposition of nonequilibrium electron-phonon dynamics:  accelerating the first-principles real-time Boltzmann equation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07520" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07520</a>
<br>
<i>Ivan Maliyov, Jia Yin, Jia Yao, Chao Yang, Marco Bernardi</i>
<p>Nonequilibrium dynamics governed by electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions plays
a key role in electronic devices and spectroscopies and is central to
understanding electronic excitations in materials. The real-time Boltzmann
transport equation (rt-BTE) with collision processes computed from first
principles can describe the coupled dynamics of electrons and atomic vibrations
(phonons). Yet, a bottleneck of these simulations is the calculation of e-ph
scattering integrals on dense momentum grids at each time step. Here we show a
data-driven approach based on dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) that can
accelerate the time propagation of the rt-BTE and identify dominant electronic
processes. We apply this approach to two case studies, high-field charge
transport and ultrafast excited electron relaxation. In both cases, simulating
only a short time window of ~10% of the dynamics suffices to predict the
dynamics from initial excitation to steady state using DMD extrapolation.
Analysis of the momentum-space modes extracted from DMD sheds light on the
microscopic mechanisms governing electron relaxation to steady state or
equilibrium. The combination of accuracy and efficiency makes our DMD-based
method a valuable tool for investigating ultrafast dynamics in a wide range of
materials.

<h3>Lattice relaxation, electronic structure and continuum model for twisted  bilayer MoTe$_2$</h3>

<br>
<i>Ning Mao, Cheng Xu, Jiangxu Li, Ting Bao, Peitao Liu, Yong Xu, Claudia Felser, Liang Fu, Yang Zhang</i>
<p>We investigate the lattice relaxation effect on moir\'e band structures in
twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ with two approaches: (a) large-scale plane-wave basis
first principle calculation down to $2.88^{\circ}$, (b) transfer learning
structure relaxation + local-basis first principles calculation down to
$1.1^{\circ}$. Two types of van der Waals corrections have been examined: the
D2 method of Grimme and the density-dependent energy correction. We note the
density-dependent energy correction yields a continuous evolution of bandwidth
with twist angles. Including second harmonic of intralayer potential/interlayer
tunneling and the strain induced gauge field, we develop a more complete
continuum model with a single set of parameters for a wide range of twist
angles, providing a useful starting point for many body simulation.

<h3>Non-affinity of liquid networks and bicontinuous mesophases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07544" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07544</a>
<br>
<i>Michael S. Dimitriyev, Xueyan Feng, Edwin L. Thomas, Gregory M. Grason</i>
<p>Amphiphiles self-assemble into a variety of bicontinuous mesophases whose
equilibrium structures take the form of high-symmetry cubic networks. Here, we
show that the symmetry-breaking distortions in these systems give rise to
anomalously large, non-affine collective deformations, which we argue to be a
generic consequence of mass equilibration within deformed networks. We propose
and study a minimal liquid network model of bicontinuous networks, in which
acubic distortions are modeled by the relaxation of residually-stressed
mechanical networks with constant-tension bonds. We show that non-affinity is
strongly dependent on the valency of the network as well as the degree of
strain-softening/stiffening force in the bonds. Taking diblock copolymer melts
as a model system, liquid network theory captures quantitative features of two
bicontinuous phases based on comparison with self-consistent field theory
predictions and direct experimental characterization of acubic distortions,
which are likely to be pronounced in soft amphiphilic systems more generally.

<h3>Optical manifestations of topological Euler class in electronic  materials</h3>

<br>
<i>Wojciech J. Jankowski, Arthur S. Morris, Adrien Bouhon, F. Nur Ünal, Robert-Jan Slager</i>
<p>We analyze quantum-geometric bounds on optical weights in topological phases
with pairs of bands hosting non-trivial Euler class, a multi-gap invariant
characterizing non-Abelian band topology. We show how the bounds constrain the
combined optical weights of the Euler bands at different dopings and further
restrict the size of the adjacent band gaps. In this process, we also consider
the associated interband contributions to DC conductivities in the flat-band
limit. We physically validate these results by recasting the bound in terms of
transition rates associated with the optical absorption of light, and
demonstrate how the Euler connections and curvatures can be determined through
the use of momentum and frequency-resolved optical measurements, allowing for a
direct measurement of this multi-band invariant. Additionally, we prove that
the bound holds beyond the degenerate limit of Euler bands, resulting in nodal
topology captured by the patch Euler class. In this context, we deduce optical
manifestations of Euler topology within $\vec{k} \cdot \vec{p}$ models, which
include AC conductivity, and third-order jerk photoconductivities in doped
Euler semimetals. We showcase our findings with numerical validation in
lattice-regularized models that benchmark effective theories for real materials
and are themselves directly realizable in metamaterials and optical lattices.

<h3>Universal signatures of Majorana zero modes in critical Kitaev chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07571" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07571</a>
<br>
<i>Nicolas Laflorencie</i>
<p>Many topological or critical aspects of the Kitaev chain are well known, with
several classic results. In contrast, the study of the critical behavior of the
strong Majorana zero modes (MZM) has been overlooked. Here we introduce two
topological markers which, surprisingly, exhibit non-trivial signatures over
the entire (1+1) Ising critical line. We first analytically compute the MZM
fidelity ${\cal{F}}_{\rm MZM}$--a measure of the MZM mapping between parity
sectors. It takes a universal value along the (1+1) Ising critical line,
${\cal{F}}_{\rm MZM}=\sqrt{8}/\pi$, independent of the energy. We also obtain
an exact analytical result for the critical MZM occupation number ${{\cal
N}}_{\rm MZM}$ which depends on the Catalan's constant ${\cal G}\approx
0.91596559$, for both the ground-state (${{\cal N}}_{\rm
MZM}=1/2-4{\cal{G}}/\pi^2\approx 0.12877$) and the first excited state (${{\cal
N}}_{\rm MZM}=1/2+(8-4{\cal{G}})/\pi^2\approx 0.93934$). We further compute
finite-size corrections which identically vanish for the special ratio
$\Delta/t=\sqrt{2}-1$ between pairing and hopping in the critical Kitaev chain.
