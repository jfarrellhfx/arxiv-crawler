<h3>High temperature deformation mechanisms in monolithic 3YTZP and 3YTZP  containing single wall carbon nanotubes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06651" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06651</a>
<br>
<i>Miguel Castillo-Rodríguez, Antonio Muñoz, Arturo Domínguez-Rodríguez</i>
<p>Monolithic 3YTZP and 3YTZP containing 2.5 vol.% of single-walled carbon
nanotubes (SWCNT) were fabricated by Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) at 1250 C.
Microstructural characterization of the as-fabricated 3YTZP/SWCNTs composite
shows a homogeneous CNTs dispersion throughout of ceramic matrix. The specimens
have been crept at temperatures between 1100 and 1200 C in order to investigate
the influence of the SWCNTs addition on high temperature deformation mechanisms
in zirconia. Slightly higher stress exponent values are found for 3YTZP/SWCNTs
nanocomposites (n~2.5) compared to monolithic 3YTZP (n~2.0). However, the
activation energy in 3YTZP (Q = 715 +- 60 kJ/mol) experiences a reduction of
about 25% by the addition of 2.5 vol.% of SWCNTs (Q = 540 +- 40 kJ/mol).
Scanning electron microscopy studies indicate that there is no microstructural
evolution in crept specimens, and Raman spectroscopy measurements show that
SWCNTs preserved their integrity during the creep tests. All these results seem
to indicate that the high temperature deformation mechanism is grain boundary
sliding (GBS) accommodated by grain-boundary diffusion, which is influenced by
yttrium segregation and the presence of SWCNTs at the grain boundary.

<h3>Origin of the low precipitation hardening in magnesium alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06652" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06652</a>
<br>
<i>C.M. Cepeda-Jiménez, M. Castillo-Rodríguez, M.T. Pérez-Prado</i>
<p>In this work electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD)-assisted slip trace
analysis and transmission electron microscopy have been utilized to investigate
the interaction of basal dislocations with precipitates in the Mg alloys
Mg-1%wt.Mn-0.7%wt.Nd (MN11) and Mg-9%wt.Al-1%wt.Zn (AZ91), with the ultimate
aim of determining the origin of their poor precipitation hardening.
Precipitates in these alloys have a plate-shaped morphology, with plates being,
respectively, perpendicular (MgxNdy) and parallel (Mg17Al12) to the basal plane
of the magnesium matrix. Mechanical tests were carried out in solid solution
and peak-aged samples, in tension and compression, both at RT and at moderate
temperature (250C). EBSD-assisted slip trace analysis revealed a clear
dominance of basal slip under a wide range of testing conditions in the
peak-aged MN11 and AZ91 alloys. At room temperature, the origin of the low
precipitation hardening observed lies at the easiness with which precipitates
are sheared by basal dislocations, due to the lattice matching at the interface
with the Mg matrix. At high temperature, dislocation-precipitate interactions
are highly dependent on the deformation mode. In tension, enhanced basal slip
localization gives rise to high stress concentrations at the intersection
between coarse slip traces and particle interfaces, leading to precipitate
fracture; in compression, a more homogenous distribution of basal slip leads to
the dominance of particle shearing. Our study demonstrates experimentally that
basal dislocations are able to shear, and even fracture, the MgxNdy and
Mg17Al12 plates when, for appropriate testing conditions, the local stress due
to dislocation accumulation at particle interfaces exceeds the precipitate
strength.

<h3>On reversible, endoreversible, and irreversible heat device cycles  versus Carnot cycle: A pedagogical approach to account for losses</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06679" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06679</a>
<br>
<i>J. Gonzalez-Ayala, F. Angulo-Brown, A. Calvo Hernández, S. Velasco</i>
<p>In this work we analyze the deviations of reversible cycles (for both heat
engines and refrigerators) from the corresponding Carnot cycle operating
between the same extreme temperatures and deviations of irreversible cycles
from its corresponding reversible realization while putting emphasis on the
corresponding losses. The endoreversible models fit in the proposed framework.
Two suitable loss factors, which don't need the explicit calculation of entropy
variations, are introduced. The behavior of these factors and their interplay
allow for a clear and pedagogical visualization of where external and internal
irreversibilities are located and their intensities in terms of the main
variables describing the cycle. The analysis could be used as a starting point
for more advanced studies on modeling and optimization of real devices and
installations.

<h3>High quantum yields generated by a multi-band quantum dot photocell</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06681" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06681</a>
<br>
<i>Shun-Cai Zhao, Qi-Xuan Wu</i>
<p>We perform the quantum yields in a multi-band quantum dot (QD) photocell via
doping an intermediate band (IB) between the conduction band (CB) and valence
band (VB). Under two different sub-band gap layouts, the output power has a
prominent enhancement than the single-band gap photocell and the achieved peak
photo-to-charge efficiency reaches to 74.9% as compared to the limit efficiency
of 63.2% via the IB approach in the theoretical solar cell prototype. The
achieved quantum yields reveal the potential to improve efficiency by some
effective theoretical approaches in the QD-IB photocell.

<h3>Quantum entropy evolution in the photovoltaic process of a quantum dot  photocell</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06685" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06685</a>
<br>
<i>Lin-Jie Chen, Shun-Cai Zhao, Ya-Fang Tian</i>
<p>For efficient photovoltaic conversion, it is important to understand how
quantum entropy-related quantities evolve during the photovoltaic process. In
this study, using a double quantum dot (DQD) photocell model, we explored the
dynamic quantum entropy-related parameters during the photovoltaic output. The
findings demonstrate that the dynamic photovoltaic performance is compatible
with quantum entropy-related parameters with varying tunneling coupling
strengths, but at varied ambient temperatures, an opposing relationship is
discovered between them. Hence, some thermodynamic criteria may be used to
evaluate the photovoltaic process in this proposed photocell model. This work's
merits include expanding our understanding of photoelectric conversion from a
thermodynamic perspective as well as perhaps suggesting a new thermodynamic
approach to efficient photoelectric conversion for DQD photocells.

<h3>Enhancing Shift Current via Virtual Multiband Transitions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06721" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06721</a>
<br>
<i>Sihan Chen, Swati Chaudhary, Gil Refael, Cyprian Lewandowski</i>
<p>Finding materials exhibiting substantial shift current holds the potential
for designing shift current-based photovoltaics that outperform conventional
solar cells. However, the myriad of factors governing shift current response
poses significant challenges in designing devices that showcase large shift
current. Here, we propose a general design principle that exploits
inter-orbital mixing to excite virtual multiband transitions in materials with
multiple flat bands to achieve enhanced shift current response. We further
explicitly relate this design principle to maximizing Wannier function spread
as expressed through the formalism of quantum geometry. We demonstrate the
viability of our design using a 1D stacked Rice-Mele model. Then, we consider a
concrete material realization - alternating angle twisted multilayer graphene
(TMG) - a natural platform to experimentally realize such an effect. We
identify a new set of twist angles at which the shift current response is
maximized via virtual transitions for each multilayer graphene and highlight
the importance of TMG as a promising material to achieve an enhanced shift
current response at terahertz frequencies. Our proposed mechanism also applies
to other 2D systems and can serve as a guiding principle for designing
multiband systems that exhibit enhanced shift current response.

<h3>Linear combinations of cluster mean-field states applied to spin systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06760" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06760</a>
<br>
<i>Athanasios Papastathopoulos-Katsaros, Thomas M. Henderson, Gustavo E. Scuseria</i>
<p>We present an innovative cluster-based method employing linear combinations
of diverse cluster mean-field (cMF) states, and apply it to describe the ground
state of strongly-correlated spin systems. In cluster mean-field theory, the
ground state wavefunction is expressed as a factorized tensor product of
optimized cluster states. While our prior work concentrated on a single cMF
tiling, this study removes that constraint by combining different tilings of
cMF states. Selection criteria, including translational symmetry and spatial
proximity, guide this process. We present benchmark calculations for the one-
and two-dimensional $J_1-J_2$ and $XXZ$ Heisenberg models. Our findings
highlight two key aspects. First, the method offers a semi-quantitative
description of the $0.4 \lessapprox J_2/J_1 \lessapprox 0.6$ regime of the
$J_1-J_2$ model - a particularly challenging regime for existing methods.
Second, our results demonstrate the capability of our method to provide
qualitative descriptions for all the models and regimes considered,
establishing it as a valuable reference. However, the inclusion of additional
(weak) correlations is necessary for quantitative agreement, and we explore
methods to incorporate these extra correlations.

<h3>Europium $c$-axis ferromagnetism in  Eu(Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$)$_{2-y}$As$_{2}$: A single-crystal neutron diffraction  study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06773" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06773</a>
<br>
<i>Tianxiong Han, Santanu Pakhira, N. S. Sangeetha, S. X. M. Riberolles, T. W. Heitmann, Yan Wu, D. C. Johnston, R. J. McQueeney, B. G. Ueland</i>
<p>We report neutron-diffraction results for the body-centered-tetragonal series
Eu(Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_{2-y}$As$_2$, $x=0.10$, $0.20$, $0.42$, and $0.82$,
$y\leq0.08$, that detail changes to the magnetic ordering with nominal hole
doping. We report the antiferromagnetic (AFM) propagation vectors, magnetic
transition temperatures, and values for the ordered magnetic moments. We find a
nonmonotonic change of the AFM propagation vector with $x$, with a minimum
occurring at the tetragonal to collapsed-tetragonal phase crossover. For
$x=0.10$ and $0.82$ we find $c$-axis-helix ordering of the Eu magnetic moments
(spins) similar to $x=0$ and $1$, with the spins oriented within the
$\mathbf{ab}$-plane. For $x=0.20$ and $0.42$ we find higher-temperature
$c$-axis-FM order and lower-temperature $c$-axis-cone order. Using the
extinction conditions for the space group, we discovered that the Eu spins are
ordered in the higher-temperature $c$-axis-FM phase for intermediate values of
$x$, contrary to a previous report suggesting only Co/Ni spin ordering.
Although we cannot directly confirm that the Co/Ni spins are also ordered, we
suggest that $c$-axis itinerant FM ordering of the Co/Ni spins could provide a
molecular field that drives parasitic FM ordering of the Eu spins, which in
turn provides the anisotropy for the lower-temperature $c$-axis-cone order.

<h3>The poker-chip experiments of synthetic elastomers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06785" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06785</a>
<br>
<i>Farhad Kamarei, Aditya Kumar, Oscar Lopez-Pamies</i>
<p>In a recent study, Kumar and Lopez-Pamies (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 150: 104359,
2021) have provided a complete quantitative explanation of the famed poker-chip
experiments of Gent and Lindley (Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. A 249: 195--205,
1959) on natural rubber. In a nutshell, making use of the fracture theory of
Kumar, Francfort, and Lopez-Pamies (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 112: 523--551, 2018),
they have shown that the nucleation of cracks in poker-chip experiments in
natural rubber is governed by the strength -- in particular, the hydrostatic
strength -- of the rubber, while the propagation of the nucleated cracks is
governed by the Griffith competition between the bulk elastic energy of the
rubber and its intrinsic fracture energy. The main objective of this paper is
to extend the theoretical study of the poker-chip experiment by Kumar and
Lopez-Pamies to synthetic elastomers that, as opposed to natural rubber: ($i$)
may feature a hydrostatic strength that is larger than their uniaxial and
biaxial tensile strengths and ($ii$) do not exhibit strain-induced
crystallization. A parametric study, together with direct comparisons with
recent poker-chip experiments on a silicone elastomer, show that these two
different material characteristics have a profound impact on where and when
cracks nucleate, as well as on where and when they propagate. In conjunction
with the results put forth earlier for natural rubber, the results presented in
this paper provide a complete description and explanation of the poker-chip
experiments of elastomers at large. As a second objective, this paper also
introduces a new fully explicit constitutive prescription for the driving force
that describes the material strength in the fracture theory of Kumar,
Francfort, and Lopez-Pamies.

<h3>Magnetic field-temperature phase diagram of spin-1/2 triangular lattice  antiferromagnet KYbSe$_2$</h3>

<p>A quantum spin liquid (QSL) is a state of matter characterized by
fractionalized quasiparticle excitations, quantum entanglement, and a lack of
long-range magnetic order. However, QSLs have evaded definitive experimental
observation. Several Yb$^{3+}$-based triangular lattice antiferromagnets with
effective $S$ = $\frac{1}{2}$ have been suggested to stabilize the QSL state as
the ground state. Here, we build a comprehensive magnetic temperature phase
diagram of a high-quality single crystalline KYbSe$_2$ via heat capacity and
magnetocaloric effect down to 30 mK with magnetic field applied along the
$a$-axis. At zero magnetic field, we observe the magnetic long-range order at
$T_N$ = 0.29 K entering 120 degrees ordered state in heat capacity, consistent
with neutron scattering studies. Analysis of the low-temperature ($T$) specific
heat ($C$) at zero magnetic field indicates linear $T$-dependence of $C/T$ and
a broad hump of $C/T$ in the proximate QSL region above $T_N$. By applying
magnetic field, we observe the up-up-down phase with 1/3 magnetization plateau
and oblique phases, in addition to two new phases. These observations strongly
indicate that while KYbSe$_2$ closely exhibits characteristics resembling an
ideal triangular lattice, deviations may exist, such as the effect of the
next-nearest-neighbor exchange interaction, calling for careful consideration
for spin Hamiltonian modeling. Further investigations into tuning parameters,
such as chemical pressure, could potentially induce an intriguing QSL phase in
the material.

<h3>Resonances involving integer magnons and spin-1/2 excitations in a  magnetism modulated two-dimensional electron gas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06792" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06792</a>
<br>
<i>Lin Zhang, Yi Wang, Shu-Yu Zheng, Li Lu, Chi Zhang</i>
<p>We conduct an experimental study of high-mobility two-dimensional electron
gas (2DEG) in GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells modulated by strong magnetism at an
in-plane magnetic field ($B$). The modulated $B$-fields are performed via the
single stripe and gratings which are made of the heavy rare earth metal Terbium
(Tb) thin films on the sample surface. The robust ferromagnetic resonances
(FMRs) persist to the temperature of 50-70 K in both the stripe and grating
samples, for the ferromagnetism (FM) phase of Tb exists at above 100 K. The
high-order (with integer numbers of $j \equiv \hbar\omega/g\mu_{B}B = 1,
2,$...) magnetic resonances can also be observed in the stripe structure via
the microwave (MW) photovoltaic detection and magnetoresistance under microwave
irradiation. In addition, the resonance features around $j = 1/2$ are robust in
the single-stripe modulated sample, which suggests the spinons with spin-1/2
collective excitations in a 1D Heisenberg model.

<h3>Ir-Sb Binary System: Unveiling Nodeless Unconventional Superconductivity  Proximate to Honeycomb-Vacancy Ordering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06796" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06796</a>
<br>
<i>V. Sazgari, Tianping Ying, J.N. Graham, C. Mielke III, D. Das, S.S. Islam, M. Bartkowiak, R. Khasanov, H. Luetkens, H. Hosono, Z. Guguchia</i>
<p>Vacancies play a crucial role in solid-state physics, but their impact on
materials with strong electron-electron correlations has been underexplored. A
recent study on the Ir-Sb binary system, Ir$_{16}$Sb$_{18}$ revealed a novel
extended buckled-honeycomb vacancy (BHV) order. Superconductivity is induced by
suppressing the BHV ordering through high-pressure growth with excess Ir atoms
or isovalent Rh substitution, although the nature of superconducting pairing
has remained unexplored. Here, we conduct muon spin rotation experiments
probing the temperature-dependence of the effective magnetic penetration depth
$\lambda_{eff}\left(T\right)$ in Ir$_{1-{\delta}}$Sb (synthesized at 5.5 GPa
with $T_{\rm c}$ = 4.2 K) and ambient pressure synthesized optimally Rh-doped
Ir$_{1-x}$Rh$_{x}$Sb ($x$=0.3, $T_{\rm c}$ = 2.7 K). The exponential
temperature dependence of the superfluid density $n_{\rm s}$/m$^{*}$ at low
temperatures indicates a fully gapped superconducting state in both samples.
Notably, the ratio of $T_{\rm c}$ to the superfluid density is comparable to
previously measured unconventional superconductors. A significant increase in
$n_{\rm s}$/m$^{*}$ in the high-pressure synthesized sample correlates with
$T_{\rm c}$, a hallmark feature of unconventional superconductivity. We further
demonstrate a similar effect induced by chemical pressure (Rh substitution) and
hydrostatic pressure in Ir$_{1-x}$Rh$_{x}$Sb, highlighting that the dome-shaped
phase diagram is a fundamental feature of the material. These findings
underscore the unconventional nature of the observed superconductivity, and
classifies IrSb as the first unconventional superconducting parent phase with
ordered vacancies.

<h3>Polarization Morphology and Electrocaloric Response of Strained  Ferroelectric Core-Shell Nanorods and Nanowires</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06797" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06797</a>
<br>
<i>Anna N. Morozovska, Eugene A. Eliseev, Olha A. Kovalenko, Dean R. Evans</i>
<p>Using Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) approach we proposed the analytical
description of the Vegard strains influence on the spontaneous polarization and
electrocaloric response in ferroelectric core-shell nanorods. The nanorod core
presents a defect-free single-crystalline ferroelectric material, and the
Vegard strains are induced by elastic defects in the ultra-thin shell. The
finite element modeling (FEM) based on the LGD approach reveals transitions of
domain structure morphology induced by the Vegard strains in the BaTiO3
nanorods. Namely, tensile Vegard strains induce and support the single-domain
state in the central part of the nanorod, while the curled domain structures
appear near the unscreened or partially screened ends of the rod. The
vortex-like domains propagate toward the central part of the rod and fill it
entirely, when the rod is covered by a shell with compressive Vegard strains
above some critical value. The critical value depends on the nanorod sizes,
aspect ratio, and screening conditions at its ends. Both analytical theory and
FEM predict that the tensile Vegard strains in the shell increase the nanorod
polarization, lattice tetragonality, and electrocaloric response well-above the
values corresponding to the bulk material. The physical reason of the increase
is the strong electrostriction coupling between the mismatch-type elastic
strains induced in the core by the Vegard strains in the shell. Comparison with
the earlier XRD data confirmed an increase of tetragonality ratio in tensiled
BaTiO3 nanorods compared to the bulk material. Obtained analytical expressions,
which are suitable for the description of strain-induced changes in a wide
class of multiaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanorods and nanowires, can be
useful for strain engineering of advanced ferroelectric nanomaterials for
electrocaloric applications and negative capacitance elements.

<h3>Capturing the slow relaxation time of superparamagnetic colloids in  time-varying fields</h3>

<p>Superparamagnetic colloids present interesting assembly dynamics and
propulsion in time-varying magnetic fields due to their magnetic relaxation.
However, little is known about the mechanisms governing this magnetic
relaxation, which is commonly attributed to the interactions and polydispersity
of the ferromagnetic nanoparticles distributed within the colloid. We measure
this relaxation from the effective potential between colloids subjected to
rotating magnetic fields. Remarkably, our results indicate the presence of
magnetic relaxation times much longer than what has been reported, which
furthers our understanding of the magnetization of colloids in complex magnetic
fields.

<h3>Restored quantum size effects of Pb overlayers at high coverages</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06816" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06816</a>
<br>
<i>A. Ayuela, E. Ogando, N. Zabala</i>
<p>Abnormally large stability of Pb nanostructures grown on metallic or
semiconductor substrates has been observed even for heights of about 30
monolayers. Using both density-functional theory calculations and analytical
models, we demonstrate that the stability at even higher coverages (N>30 ML) is
supported by an extra second quantum beat pattern in the energetics of the
metal film as a function of the number of atomic layers. This pattern is
triggered by the butterflylike shape of the Fermi surface of lead in the (111)
direction and supports the detection of stable magic islands of higher heights
than measured up to now.

<h3>All "roads" lead to rocksalt structure</h3>

<br>
<i>Matthew Jankousky, Helen Chen, Andrew Novick, Vladan Stevanović</i>
<p>Rocksalt is the most common crystal structure among binary compounds.
Moreover, no long-lived, metastable polymorphs are observed in compounds with
the rocksalt ground state. We investigate the absence of polymorphism and the
dominance of the rocksalt structure via first-principles random structure
sampling and transformation kinetics modeling of three rocksalt compounds: MgO,
TaC, and PbTe. Random structure sampling reveals that for all three systems the
rocksalt local minimum on the potential energy surface is far larger than any
other, making it statistically the most significant structure. The kinetics
modeling shows that virtually all other relevant structures, including most of
the 457 known A$_1$B$_1$ prototypes, transform rapidly to rocksalt, making it
the only option at ambient conditions. These results explain the absence of
polymorphism in binary rocksalts, answer why rocksalt is the structure of
choice for high-entropy ceramics and disordered ternary nitrides, and help
understand/predict metastable states in crystalline solids more generally.

<h3>A review of UTe$_2$ at high magnetic fields</h3>

<i>Sylvia K. Lewin, Corey E. Frank, Sheng Ran, Johnpierre Paglione, Nicholas P. Butch</i>
<p>Uranium ditelluride (UTe$_2$) is recognized as a host material to
unconventional spin-triplet superconductivity, but it also exhibits a wealth of
additional unusual behavior at high magnetic fields. One of the most prominent
signatures of the unconventional superconductivity is a large and anisotropic
upper critical field that exceeds the paramagnetic limit. This
superconductivity survives to 35 T and is bounded by a discontinuous magnetic
transition, which itself is also field-direction-dependent. A different,
reentrant superconducting phase emerges only on the high-field side of the
magnetic transition, in a range of angles between the crystallographic $b$ and
$c$ axes. This review discusses the current state of knowledge of these
high-field phases, the high-field behavior of the heavy fermion normal state,
and other phases that are stabilized by applied pressure.

<h3>A spin-torque nano-oscillator based on interlayer-coupled meron-skyrmion  pairs with a fixed orbit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06865" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06865</a>
<br>
<i>Qiyun Yi, Ting Han, Jinyi Jiang, Xiangjun Xing</i>
<p>In recent years, magnetic skyrmion-based spin-torque nano-oscillators (STNOs)
attract considerable interest for their prospect in future-generation
communication and spintronic technologies. However, some critical issues, which
hamper their practical applications, e.g., the long start-up time and variable
skyrmion gyration orbit, remain to be resolved. Here, we numerically
demonstrate a realization of a fixed-orbit STNO, which is based on an
interlayer-coupled meron-skyrmion (MS) pair other than a magnetic skyrmion. In
this STNO, the MS pair possesses a structurally defined, fixed orbit within a
broad range of driving current, even in the presence of random defects. The
output frequency range of the STNO based on an MS pair far exceeds that of the
STNO typically based on a single skyrmion. Moreover, the output frequency of
this STNO can be further elevated if more MS pairs are incorporated. Our
results reveal the nontrivial dynamics of the interlayer-coupled MS pair,
opening perspectives for the design and optimization of fundamental spintronic
devices.

<p>The temperature at which supercooled liquids turn into solid-like glasses
($T_g$) can change at the free surface, affecting the properties of
nanostructured glasses and their applications. However, inadequate experimental
resolution to determine the $T_g$ gradient and a longstanding debate over the
role of nonequilibrium effects have hindered fundamental understanding of this
phenomenon. Using spatially resolved $T_g$ measurements and molecular dynamics
simulations, we reveal a crossover from equilibrium behavior to a new regime of
near-surface nonequilibrium glass physics on cooling. This crossover causes the
form of the nonequilibrium $T_g$ gradient to change, highlighting the need to
include these physics for rational understanding of the properties of realistic
nanostructured glass-forming materials. They also potentially recast the
interpretation of decades of experimental data on nanoconfined glasses.

<h3>The linear viscoelastic fracture theory applies to soft solids better  when they are... viscoelastic</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06944" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06944</a>
<br>
<i>Etienne Barthel</i>
<p>Over the last half-century, linear viscoelastic models for crack growth in
soft solids have flourished but comparisons of these models to experiments have
remained scarce. In fact, most available models are either very approximate or
cast in forms which are quite unsuitable for the analysis of actual data. Here
we propose a version of the linear viscoelastic rupture theory which is quite
amenable to data analysis. We then apply this approach to four sets of data
documenting fracture in soft solids. For elastomers, the results reproduce the
known process zone size inconsistency. However, in two more viscoelastic
systems, the linear viscoelastic prediction was found to consistently match the
measured velocity dependence of the rupture energy with physically acceptable
process zone sizes. They even reasonably match the measured damage zone size.
Consequences for more insightful analyzes of rupture data in soft solids are
discussed.

<p>The properties of the one-dimensional $SU(3)$ population-imbalanced fermions
are discussed. The system is assumed to be in the two-body resonance where all
two-body scattering lengths diverge, and the only interaction between fermions
that is taken into account is the short-range three-body one. In particular, we
consider the situation when only one `flavor' of fermions is macroscopically
occupied, and there are exactly two atoms of two others. This system supports
the trimer and the medium-induced dimer states studied here in detail and shows
evidence of color superfluidity.

<h3>Lifetime of vertical giant soap films: role of the relative humidity and  film dimensions</h3>

<i>Marina Pasquet, François Boulogne, Frédéric Restagno, Emmanuelle Rio</i>
<p>We consider the lifetime of rectangular vertical soap films and we explore
the influence of relative humidity and both dimensions on the stability of
large soap films, reaching heights of up to 1.2 m. Using an automated rupture
detection system, we achieve a robust statistical measurement of their
lifetimes and we also measure the film thinning dynamics. We demonstrate that
drainage has a negligible impact on the film stability as opposed to
evaporation. To do so, we compare the measured lifetimes with predictions from
the Boulogne \& Dollet model \cite{BoulogneDollet2018}, originally designed to
describe the convective evaporation of hydrogels. Interestingly, we show that
this model can predict a maximum film lifetime for all sizes.

<h3>Impurities in graphehe and their influence on the Casimir interaction</h3>

<i>N. Khusnutdinov, D. Vassilevich</i>
<p>We study the influence of impurities in graphene described by a scattering
rate $\Gamma$ on the Casimir interaction between graphene and an ideal
conductor or between two identical sheets of graphene at zero temperature and
chemical potential. To this end, we compute the polarization tensor of
quasiparticles in graphene and corresponding conductivities for TE and TM
channels. The Casimir energy density is evaluated with the help of the Lifshitz
formula. We find that depending on the value of mass gap parameter the presence
of $\Gamma$ may lead to a slight damping or to a considerable enhancement of
the Casimir interaction.

<h3>Quantum size effects of Pb overlayers at high coverages</h3>

<i>A. Ayuela, E. Ogando, N. Zabala</i>
<p>We have studied Pb thin films as a function of the thickness up to 60
monolayers (MLs) using ab initio first principles and model calculations. Magic
heights corresponding to a modulated oscillatory pattern of the energy of
Pb(111) films have been measured up to about 30 MLs. We demonstrate that this
behaviour continues even for higher thickness due to an extra second modulation
pattern in the energetics of the metal film as a function of the number of
atomic layers. The origin of this second modulation is the nesting of two close
values of the Fermi wavelength in the (111) direction.

<h3>Superfluid transition of disordered dipolar Fermi gases in a 2D lattice</h3>

<i>V. Y. Pinchenkova, S. I. Matveenko, G. V. Shlyapnikov</i>
<p>We consider a superfluid transition in two-component dipolar Fermi gases in a
two-dimensional lattice with a weak on-site disorder. The momentum dependent
dipole-dipole interaction amplitude violates the Anderson theorem and in the
weakly interacting regime this leads to an increase of the superfluid
transition temperature. We find that in a sufficiently deep lattice
(tight-binding regime) and in the low momentum limit superfluid properties can
be considered in the same way as in free space replacing the mass of atoms by
an effective mass in the lattice. The disorder-induced increase of the critical
temperature can be significantly more pronounced than in free space.

<h3>Phase Separation Kinetics and Cluster Dynamics in Two-Dimensional Active  Dumbbell Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06998" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06998</a>
<br>
<i>C. B. Caporusso, L. F. Cugliandolo, P. Digregorio, G. Gonnella, A. Suma</i>
<p>Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to investigate the phase
separation process of a two-dimensional active Brownian dumbbell model. We
evaluated the time dependence of the typical size of the dense component using
the scaling properties of the structure factor, along with the averaged number
of clusters and their radii of gyration. The growth observed is faster than in
active particle (disk) models, and this effect is further enhanced under
stronger activity. Next, we focused on studying the hexatic order of the
clusters. The length associated to the orientational order grows algebraically
and faster than for active Brownian particles. Under weak active forces, most
clusters exhibit a uniform internal orientational order. However, under strong
forcing, large clusters consist of domains with different orientational orders.
We demonstrated that the latter configurations are not stable, and given
sufficient time to evolve, they eventually reach homogeneous configurations as
well. No gas bubbles are formed within the clusters, even when there are
patches of different hexatic order. Finally, attention was directed towards the
geometry and motion of the clusters themselves. By employing a tracking
algorithm, we showed that clusters smaller than the typical size at the
observation time exhibit regular shapes, while larger ones display fractal
characteristics. In between collisions or break-ups, the clusters behave as
solid bodies. Their centers of mass undergo circular motion, with radii
increasing with the cluster size. The center of mass angular velocity equals
that of the constituents with respect to their center of mass. These
observations were rationalised with a simple mechanical model.

<h3>Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Optimization of Battery-Grade Lithium  Carbonate Production</h3>

<br>
<i>S. Shayan Mousavi Masouleh, Corey A. Sanz, Ryan P. Jansonius, Samuel Shi, Maria J. Gendron Romero, Jason E. Hein, Jason Hattrick-Simpers</i>
<p>By 2035, the need for battery-grade lithium is expected to quadruple. About
half of this lithium is currently sourced from brines and must be converted
from a chloride into lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) through a process called
softening. Conventional softening methods using sodium or potassium salts
contribute to carbon emissions during reagent mining and battery manufacturing,
exacerbating global warming. This study introduces an alternative approach
using carbon dioxide (CO2(g)) as the carbonating reagent in the lithium
softening process, offering a carbon capture solution. We employed an active
learning-driven high-throughput method to rapidly capture CO2(g) and convert it
to lithium carbonate. The model was simplified by focusing on the elemental
concentrations of C, Li, and N for practical measurement and tracking, avoiding
the complexities of ion speciation equilibria. This approach led to an
optimized lithium carbonate process that capitalizes on CO2(g) capture and
improves the battery metal supply chain's carbon efficiency.

<h3>Boosting energy levels in graphene magnetic quantum dots through  magnetic flux and inhomogeneous gap</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07014" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07014</a>
<br>
<i>Mohammed El Azar, Ahmed Bouhlal, Ahmed Jellal</i>
<p>We investigate the effects of a magnetic flux and an inhomogeneous gap on the
energy spectrum of a graphene magnetic quantum dot (GMQD). We employ the Dirac
equation within the infinite mass framework to obtain analytical eigenspinor
expressions. Applying boundary conditions yields an energy spectrum equation in
terms of system parameters like radius, field, energy, flux, and gap. In the
infinite limit, we recover Landau levels for graphene in a magnetic field. We
demonstrate that the energy spectrum significantly increases in the presence of
flux and a gap inside the GMQD, which lengthens the lifetime of trapped
electron states. We show that higher flux also produces new Landau levels of
negative angular momentum. Meanwhile, we find that the gap widens the
separation between the electron and hole energy bands. Therefore, we conclude
that the flux and gap regulate electron mobility via influencing confinement
and extending quasi-bound state duration, as verified through studying radial
probability.

<h3>Effects of Strong Capacitive Coupling Between Meta-Atoms in rf SQUID  Metamaterials</h3>

<br>
<i>Jingnan Cai, Robin Cantor, Johanne Hizanidis, Nikos Lazarides, Steven M. Anlage</i>
<p>We consider, for the first time, the effects of strong capacitive and
inductive coupling between radio frequency Superconducting Quantum Interference
Devices (rf SQUIDs) in an overlapping metamaterial geometry when driven by rf
flux at and near their self-resonant frequencies. The equations of motion
containing the gauge-invariant phases on the Josephson junctions in each SQUID
are set up and solved which include the high-frequency displacement currents
through capacitive overlap between the wiring of SQUID loops. We begin by
modeling two overlapping SQUIDs and studying the response in both the linear
and nonlinear high-frequency driving limits. By exploring a sequence of more
and more complicated arrays, the formalism is eventually extended to the
$N\times N \times 2$ overlapping metamaterial array, where we develop an
understanding of the many ($8N^2-8N+3$) resulting resonant modes in terms of
three classes of resonances. The capacitive coupling gives rise to
qualitatively new self-resonant response of rf SQUID metamaterials, and is
demonstrated through analytical theory, numerical modeling, and experiment in
the 10-30 GHz range on capacitively and inductively coupled rf SQUID
metamaterials.

<h3>Cooperating Cracks in Two-Dimensional Crystals</h3>

<br>
<i>Shizhe Feng, Xiaodong Zheng, Pengjie Shi, Thuc Hue Ly, Jiong Zhao, Zhiping Xu</i>
<p>The pattern development of multiple cracks in extremely anisotropic solids
such as bilayer or multilayer two-dimensional (2D) crystals contains rich
physics, which, however, remains largely unexplored. We studied crack
interaction across neighboring 2D layers by transmission electron microscopy
and molecular dynamics simulations. Parallel and anti-parallel ('En-Passant')
cracks attract and repel each other in bilayer 2D crystals, respectively, in
stark contrast to the behaviors of co-planar cracks. We show that the misfit
between in-plane displacement fields around the crack tips results in
non-uniform interlayer shear, which modifies the crack driving forces by
creating an antisymmetric component of the stress intensity factor. The
cross-layer interaction between cracks directly leads to material toughening,
the strength of which increases with the shear stiffness and decreases with the
crack spacings. Backed by the experimental findings and simulation results, a
theory that marries the theory of linear elastic fracture mechanics and the
shear-lag model is presented, which guides the unconventional approach to
engineer fracture patterns and enhance material resistance to cracking.

<p>Characterising charge transport in a material is central to the understanding
of its electrical properties, and can usually only be inferred from bulk
measurements of derived quantities such as current flow. Establishing
connections between host material impurities and transport properties in
emerging electronics materials, such as wide bandgap semiconductors, demands
new diagnostic methods tailored to these unique systems, and the presence of
optically-active defect centers in these materials offers a non-perturbative,
in-situ characterisation system. Here, we combine charge-state sensitive
optical microscopy and photoelectric detection of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres
to directly image the flow of charge carriers inside a diamond optoelectronic
device, in 3D and with temporal resolution. We optically control the charge
state of background impurities inside the diamond on-demand, resulting in
drastically different current flow such as filamentary channels nucleating from
specific, defective regions of the device. We then optically engineered
conducting channels that control carrier flow, key steps towards optically
reconfigurable, wide bandgap designer optoelectronics. We anticipate our
approach might be extended to probe other wide-bandgap semiconductors (SiC,
GaN) relevant to present and emerging electronic technologies.

<h3>Statistical properties of probabilistic context-sensitive grammars</h3>

<br>
<i>Kai Nakaishi, Koji Hukushima</i>
<p>Probabilistic context-free grammars, commonly used to randomly generate
trees, have been well analyzed theoretically and have found applications in
various domains. Despite their utility, the distributions that the grammar can
express are limited to those in which the distribution of a subtree depends
only on its root and not on its context. This limitation becomes a challenge
for modeling various real-world phenomena such as natural language. To overcome
this limitation, a probabilistic context-sensitive grammar is introduced, where
a subtree's distribution depends on its context, and its statistical properties
are explored. Numerical analysis reveals that the distribution of a symbol does
not exhibit a qualitative difference from that in the context-free case, but
mutual information does. Furthermore, a metric is introduced to directly
quantify the breaking of this limitation. This metric is zero in the
context-free case, and is applicable to an arbitrary distribution of a tree.
Measuring this metric enables the detection of a distinct difference between
probabilistic context-free and context-sensitive grammars.

<h3>Interplay between cortical adhesion and membrane bending regulates  microparticle formation</h3>

<br>
<i>Arijit Mahapatra, Sage A. Malingen, Padmini Rangamani</i>
<p>The formation of microparticles requires the bending of the plasma membrane
away from the cytosol. The capcity of the cell membrane to form a
microparticle, and the rate of membrane deformation, are controlled by multiple
factors, including loss of lipid asymmetry (primarily the exposure of
phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet), detachment of the membrane from the
cortical cytoskeleton, and bleb expansion due to pressure. In this work, we
develop a biophysical model that accounts for the interaction between these
different factors. Our findings reveal that the linkage between the membrane
and cortex is a key determinant of outward budding. Ultimately, the rates and
mechanical parameters regulating cortical linkage interact with the kinetics of
phosphatidylserine flipping, laying out a mechanical phase space for regulating
the outward budding of the plasma membrane.

<h3>Quasiparticle scattering interference in cuprate superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07122" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07122</a>
<br>
<i>Minghuan Zeng, Xiang Li, Yongjun Wang, Shiping Feng</i>
<p>The quasiparticle scattering interference (QSI) is intimately related to the
nature of the quasiparticle and of its interplay with a variety of electronic
orders and superconductivity. Here starting from the microscopic octet
scattering model, the nature of QSI in cuprate superconductors is studied in
the $T$-matrix approach. In particular, a new method of the inversion of matrix
is developed to accurately derive the $T$-matrix for various kinds of
impurities, and then the obtained $T$-matrix is employed to calculate the local
density of states (LDOS). It is shown that the overall features of the LDOS
modulation can be described qualitatively by taking into account the
quasiparticle scattering from a single impurity on the kinetic-energy-driven
homogeneous superconducting-state, where the QSI scattering wave vectors ${\bf
q}_{i}$ and the related QSI peak dispersions are internally consistent within
the octet scattering model. However, the pronounced QSI peaks in the
momentum-space LDOS modulation pattern for a single impurity are smeared
heavily in the case for multiple impurities, and then the momentum-space LDOS
modulation for multiple impurities exhibits a speckle pattern. Moreover, the
momentum-space LDOS modulation for Gaussian-random-distribution of on-site
impurity at a relatively large deviation displays a similar behavior of the
LDOS modulation for multiple impurities. The theory also indicates that the
impurity weight linearly increases with the increase of the impurity-scattering
strength for the weak scattering strength and tends to saturate in the strong
scattering strength, while it decreases with the increase of the
impurity-scattering screening length for the short screening-length and
saturate in the long screening-length.

<h3>Intrinsic constraint on $T_c$ for unconventional superconductivity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07128" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07128</a>
<br>
<i>Qiong Qin, Yi-feng Yang</i>
<p>Can room temperature superconductivity be achieved in correlated materials
under ambient pressure? Our answer to this billion-dollar question is probably
no, at least for realistic models within the current theoretical framework.
This is shown by our systematic simulations on the pairing instability of some
effective models for two-dimensional superconductivity. For a square lattice
model with nearest-neighbour pairing, we find a plaquette state formed of
weakly-connected $2\times2$ blocks for sufficiently large pairing interaction.
The superconductivity is suppressed on both sides away from its melting quantum
critical point. Thus, the plaquette state constrains the magnitude of $T_c$ for
large pairing interactions and may be viewed as a strong-coupling parent state
of $d$-wave superconductivity, in resemblance of other competing orders. We
then extend our simulations to a variety of effective models covering
nearest-neighbour or onsite pairing, single layer or two-layer, intralayer or
interlayer pairing, and find an intrinsic maximum of the ratio $T_c/J\approx
0.04-0.07$, where $J$ is the onsite or nearest-neighbour pairing interaction.
Comparison with existing experiments supports this constraint in cuprate,
iron-based, nickelate, and heavy fermion superconductors, despite these
compounds are so complicated well beyond our simplified models. As a result,
the known families of unconventional superconductivity seem to almost exhaust
their potentials in reaching the maximal $T_c$ allowed by their spin exchange
interaction, while achieving room temperature superconductor would require a
much larger $J$ beyond 400-700 meV, which seems unrealistic and hence demands
novel pairing mechanisms.

<p>Signatures of superconductivity near 80 K were recently discovered in
crystals of La-Ni-O with the stoichiometry of 3:2:7 under high pressures.
Structural studies have shown conflicting results highlighting both the
expected bilayer (2222) structure and an unexpected alternating
monolayer-trilayer (1313) structure, both apparently showing superconductivity.
Here, we perform angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on crystals with the
1313 structure to elucidate the distinct electronic features compared to the
previously studied 2222 structure. Our measurements suggest that a flat band of
high electron density is much closer to the Fermi energy in the 1313 structure
compared to the 2222 structure. Furthermore, we observe an additional electron
pocket at the Brillouin zone center with Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbital character,
highlighting the importance of the out-of-plane orbital component. In
comparison to LDA+U band structure calculations, we find strong renormalization
of both the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ derived bands, suggesting strong
correlation effects beyond that of moderate Hubbard physics. These results
reveal important differences in the electronic structure brought about by the
distinct structural motifs with the same stoichiometry. Such differences may
contain the key to understanding superconductivity in the layered perovskite
nickelates.

<i>Martin S. Talla Noutack, Fabienne Amann, Sophie Nowak, Régis Poulain, Raphaëlle Guillou, Stéphanie Delannoy, Ivan Guillot, Frédéric Prima, Emmanuel Clouet</i>
<p>Variations with oxygen concentration of titanium lattice parameters are
obtained by means of ab initio calculations, considering the impact of oxygen
ordering. The quasiharmonic approximation is used to take into account the
thermal expansion at finite temperature. Results show that lattice parameters
depend mainly on oxygen concentration and, to a lesser extent, on the ordering
state. Knowing these theoretical variations, one can get insights into the
composition of ordered compounds existing in Ti-O binary alloys from their
lattice mismatch measured experimentally by x-ray diffraction. The approach is
used in a binary alloy containing 6000 ppm in weight of oxygen. It is concluded
that the ordered compounds, which are observed after a recrystallization heat
treatment, do not have the expected Ti6O stoichiometry but have a composition
close to the nominal concentration. Oxygen ordering proceeds, therefore, before
oxygen partitioning in titanium.

<i>Eric L. Buehler, Markus J. Buehler</i>
<p>We report a mixture of expert strategy to create fine-tuned large language
models using a deep layer-wise token-level approach based on low-rank
adaptation (LoRA). Starting with a set of pre-trained LoRA adapters, we propose
a gating strategy that uses the hidden states to dynamically mix adapted
layers, allowing the resulting X-LoRA model to draw upon different capabilities
and create never-before-used deep layer-wise combinations of adaptations are
established to solve specific tasks. The design is inspired by the biological
principles of universality and diversity, where neural network building blocks
are reused in different hierarchical manifestations. Hence, the X-LoRA model
can be easily implemented for any existing large language model (LLM) without a
need for modifications of the underlying structure. We develop a tailored
X-LoRA model that offers scientific capabilities including forward/inverse
analysis tasks and enhanced reasoning capability, focused on biomaterial
analysis, protein mechanics and design. The impact of this work include access
to readily expandable, adaptable and changeable models with strong domain
knowledge and the capability to integrate across areas of knowledge. With the
X-LoRA model featuring experts in biology, mathematics, reasoning, bio-inspired
materials, mechanics and materials, chemistry, and protein mechanics we conduct
a series of physics-focused case studies. We examine knowledge recall, protein
mechanics forward/inverse tasks, protein design, and adversarial agentic
modeling including ontological knowledge graphs. The model is capable not only
of making quantitative predictions of nanomechanical properties of proteins,
but also reasons over the results and correctly predicts likely mechanisms that
explain distinct molecular behaviors.

<p>Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) solar cell technology is a promising candidate to
help boost green energy production. However, impurities and structural defects
are major barriers to improving the solar power conversion efficiency. Grain
boundaries often act as aggregation sites for impurities, resulting in strain
localization in areas of high diffusion. In this study, we demonstrate the use
of scanning 3D X-ray diffraction microscopy to non-destructively make 3D maps
of the grains, their phase, orientation, and local strain within a CdTe solar
cell absorber layer with a resolution of 100 nm. We quantify twin boundaries
and suggest how they affect grain size and orientation distribution. Local
strain analysis reveals that strain is primarily associated with high
misorientation grain boundaries, whereas twin boundaries do not show high
strain values. We also observe that high-strain grain boundaries form a
continuous pathway connected to the CdS layer. Hence, this high-strain region
is believed to be associated with the diffusion of sulfur from the CdS layer
along grain boundaries. This hypothesis is supported by SEM EDS and X-ray
fluorescence experiments. The method and analysis demonstrated in this work can
be applied to different polycrystalline materials where the characterization of
grain boundary properties is essential to understand the microstructural
phenomena.

<h3>Extended $N$-centered ensemble density functional theory of double  electronic excitations</h3>

<br>
<i>Filip Cernatic, Emmanuel Fromager</i>
<p>A recent work [arXiv:2401.04685] has merged $N$-centered ensembles of neutral
and charged electronic ground states with ensembles of neutral ground and
excited states, thus providing a general and in-principle exact (so-called
extended $N$-centered) ensemble density functional theory of neutral and
charged electronic excitations. This formalism made it possible to revisit the
concept of density-functional derivative discontinuity, in the particular case
of single excitations from the highest occupied Kohn-Sham (KS) molecular
orbital, without invoking the usual "asymptotic behavior of the density"
argument. In this work, we address a broader class of excitations, with a
particular focus on double excitations. An exact implementation of the theory
is presented for the two-electron Hubbard dimer model. A thorough comparison of
the true physical ground- and excited-state electronic structures with that of
the fictitious ensemble density-functional KS system is also presented.
Depending on the choice of the density-functional ensemble as well as the
asymmetry of the dimer and the correlation strength, an inversion of states can
be observed. In some other cases, the strong mixture of KS states within the
true physical system makes the assignment "single excitation" or "double
excitation" irrelevant.

<h3>Quantum geometric bound for saturated ferromagnetism</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07171" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07171</a>
<br>
<i>Junha Kang, Taekoo Oh, Junhyun Lee, Bohm-Jung Yang</i>
<p>Despite its abundance in nature, predicting the occurrence of ferromagnetism
in the ground state is possible only under very limited conditions such as in a
flat band system with repulsive interaction or in a band with a single hole
under infinitely large Coulomb repulsion, etc. Here, we propose a general
condition to achieve saturated ferromagnetism based on the quantum geometry of
electronic wave functions in itinerant electron systems. By analyzing
multi-band repulsive Hubbard models with an integer band filling, relevant to
either ferromagnetic insulators or semimetals, we propose a rigorous quantum
geometric upper bound on the spin stiffness. By employing this geometric bound,
we establish that saturated ferromagnetism is prohibited in the absence of
interband coupling, even when the local Hubbard repulsion is infinitely large.
As a corollary, this shows that saturated ferromagnetism is forbidden in any
half-filled Hubbard model. We also derive the condition that the upper bound of
the spin stiffness can be completely characterized by the Abelian quantum
metric. We believe that our findings reveal a profound connection between
quantum geometry and ferromagnetism, which can be extended to various
symmetry-broken ground states in itinerant electronic systems.

<h3>A finite geometry, inertia assisted coarsening-to-complexity transition  in homogeneous frictional systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07178" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07178</a>
<br>
<i>Thibault Roch, Efim A. Brener, Jean-François Molinari, Eran Bouchbinder</i>
<p>The emergence of statistical complexity in frictional systems (where
nonlinearity and dissipation are confined to an interface), manifested in broad
distributions of various observables, is not yet understood. We study this
problem in velocity-driven, homogeneous (no quenched disorder) unstable
frictional systems of height $H$. For large $H$, such frictional systems were
recently shown to undergo continuous coarsening until settling into a spatially
periodic traveling solution. We show that when the system's height-to-length
ratio becomes small -- characteristic of various engineering and geophysical
systems -- , coarsening is less effective and the periodic solution is
dynamically avoided. Instead, and consistently with previous reports, the
system settles into a stochastic, statistically stationary state. The latter
features slip bursts, whose slip rate is larger than the driving velocity,
which are non-trivially distributed. The slip bursts are classified into two
types: predominantly non-propagating, accompanied by small total slip and
propagating, accompanied by large total slip. The statistical distributions
emerge from dynamically self-generated heterogeneity, where both the
non-equilibrium history of the interface and wave reflections from finite
boundaries, mediated by material inertia, play central roles. Specifically, the
dynamics and statistics of large bursts reveal a timescale $\sim\!H/c_{\rm s}$,
where $c_{\rm s}$ is the shear wave-speed.

<h3>Probing Magnetic and Triplet Correlations in Spin-Split Superconductors  with Magnetic Impurities</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07184" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07184</a>
<br>
<i>Chen-How Huang, Anastasiia Skurativska, F. Sebastian Bergeret, Miguel A. Cazalilla</i>
<p>A superconductor (SC) in proximity to a ferromagnetic insulator (FMI) is
predicted to exhibit mixed singlet and triplet pair correlations. The magnetic
proximity effect of FMI spin-splits the energy of Bogoliubov excitations and
leads to a spin polarization at the surface for superconducting films thinner
than the superconducting coherence length. In this work, we study
manifestations of these phenomena in the properties of a magnetic impurity
coupled via Kondo coupling to this FMI/SC system. Using the numerical
renormalization group (NRG) method, we compute the properties of the ground
state and low-lying excited states of a model that incorporates the Kondo
interaction and a Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)-like interaction with
the surface spin polarization. Our main finding is an energy splitting of the
lowest even fermion-parity states caused by the proximity to the FMI. As the
Kondo coupling increases, the splitting grows and saturates to a universal
value equal to twice the exchange field of the FMI. We introduce a two-site
model that can be solved analytically and provides a qualitative understanding
of this and other NRG results. In addition, using perturbation theory we
demonstrate that the mechanism behind the splitting involves the RKKY field and
the triplet correlations of the spin-split superconductor. A scaling analysis
combined with NRG shows that the splitting can be written as a single-parameter
scaling function of the ratio of the Kondo temperature and the superconducting
gap, which is also numerically obtained.

<h3>Trilayer multi-orbital models of $\mathrm{La_{4}Ni_{3}O_{10}}$</h3>

<i>Zhihui Luo, Cui-Qun Chen, Meng Wang, Wéi Wú, Dao-Xin Yao</i>
<p>Recently, the discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP)
$\mathrm{La_4Ni_3O_{10}}$ under pressure has further expanded the realm of
nickelate-based superconductor family. In this paper, we performed a
first-principle study of $\mathrm{La_4Ni_3O_{10}}$ for both $P2_1/a$ phase at
ambient pressure and $I4/mmm$ phase at high pressure, with $U$=0, 3.5 eV. Our
results confirmed the characteristic upward shift of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ bonding band
under pressure. Moreover, our analysis of electronic spectrum and orbital
occupancy unveil the dynamical mechanism of electronic reconstructions under
pressure, embedded in a critical dual effect. Based on our DFT results, we
further proposed a trilayer two-orbital model by performing Wannier downfolding
on Ni-$e_g$ orbitals. Our model reveals four Fermi surface sheets with
$\alpha,\beta,\beta^\prime,\gamma$ pockets, bearing resemblance to that of
bilayer $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$. According to the model, our calculated spin
susceptibility under random phase approximation predicts an analogous magnetic
signal at ${\rm q}=(\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})$, which is more associated
with nesting within $\beta,\beta^\prime$ pockets. Finally, a high energy
sixteen-orbital model with direct $dp,pp$ hoppings is proposed, which implies
that $\mathrm{La_4Ni_3O_{10}}$ also lies in charge-transfer picture within
Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen scheme. Our exposition of electronic reconstructions and
multi-orbital models shed light on theoretical electronic correlation study and
experimental exploration for lower pressure in RP series.

<p>We study Homogeneously Precessing Domain (HPD) in superfluid $^3$He-B in a
regular continuous-wave nuclear magnetic resonance (CW NMR) experiment. Using
Fourier analysis of CW NMR time traces, we identify several oscillation modes
with frequency monotonically increasing with the frequency shift of the HPD.
Some of these modes are localized near the cell walls, while others are
localized in bulk liquid and can be interpreted as oscillations of
$\vartheta$-solitons. We also observe chaotic motion of the HPD in a certain
range of temperatures and frequency shifts.

<h3>Ab initio simulations of the thermodynamic properties and phase  transition of Fermi systems based on fictitious identical particles and  physics-informed neural networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07231" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07231</a>
<br>
<i>Yunuo Xiong, Hongwei Xiong</i>
<p>Fictitious identical particle thermodynamics has emerged as a powerful tool
to overcome the fermion sign problem, enabling highly accurate simulations of
one thousand fermions in warm dense matter (T. Dornheim et al., J. Phys. Chem.
Lett. 15, 1305 (2024)). However, inferring the thermodynamic properties of
Fermi systems from a large number of exact numerical simulations of the bosonic
sector still poses subtle challenges, especially in the regime of high quantum
degeneracy and in the presence of phase transitions. In this work, we
demonstrate that physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), trained on data from
extensive and sign-problem-free numerical simulations of the bosonic sector,
offer a valuable means to infer the thermodynamic properties of Fermi systems.
PINNs can play a particularly crucial role in capturing phase transitions. To
illustrate the methodology of fictitious identical particles combined with
PINNs for simulating the thermodynamics of Fermi systems, we explore its
application in realistic scenarios, including ultracold Fermi gases in periodic
potentials, and phase transitions of pair condensation formed in the unitary
limit in a three-dimensional harmonic trap. For the spatially continuous
Fermi-Hubbard model, we efficiently and reliably simulated hundreds of fermions
here. For the Fermi gas in the unitary limit, based on the fictitious identical
particle combined with PINNs, our approach confirms the universal result of the
critical temperature with the increasing of the number of fermions, and is
consistent with the experimental observations.

<h3>Weakly interacting one-dimensional topological insulators: a  bosonization approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07239" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07239</a>
<br>
<i>Polina Matveeva, Dmitri Gutman, Sam T. Carr</i>
<p>We investigate the topological properties of one-dimensional weakly
interacting topological insulators using bosonization. To do that we study the
topological edge states that emerge at the edges of a model realized by a
strong impurity or at the boundary between topologically distinct phases. In
the bosonic model, the edge states are manifested as degenerate bosonic kinks
at the boundaries. We first illustrate this idea on the example of the
interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain. We compute the localization
length of the edge states as the width of an edge soliton that occurs in the
SSH model in the presence of a strong impurity. Next, we examine models of two
capacitively coupled SSH chains that can be either identical or in distinct
topological phases. We find that weak Hubbard interaction reduces the ground
state degeneracy in the topological phase of identical chains. We then prove
that similarly to the non-interacting model, the degeneracy of the edge states
in the interacting case is protected by chiral symmetry. We then study
topological insulators built from two SSH chains with inter-chain hopping, that
represent models of different chiral symmetric universality classes. We
demonstrate in bosonic language that the topological index of a weakly coupled
model is determined by the type of inter-chain coupling, invariant under one of
two possible chiral symmetry operators. Finally, we show that a general
one-dimensional model in a phase with topological index $\nu$ is equivalent at
low energies to a theory of at least $\nu$ SSH chains. We illustrate this idea
on the example of an SSH model with longer-range hopping.

<h3>Temperature dependence of the Raman spectrum of orthorhombic Bi2Se3</h3>

<p>Bismuth selenide, a benchmark topological insulator, grows in a trigonal
structure at ambient conditions and exhibits a number of enticing properties
related to the formation of Dirac surface states. Besides this polytype, a
metastable orthorhombic modification with Pnma space group has been produced by
electrodeposition and high-pressure high-temperature synthesis displaying upon
Sb doping significant thermoelectric properties in the midtemperature range.
However, very little experimental information is available on the fundamental
properties of this polytype, such as, e.g., the electronic band gap and the
lattice dynamics. We report here the temperature dependence of the Raman
spectra of orthorhombic Bi2Se3 between 10 K and 300 K, which displays an
anharmonic behavior of the optical phonons that can be modelled with a
two-phonon decay channel. In order to analyze the data we performed ab initio
calculations of the electronic bandstructure, the phonon frequencies at the
center of the Brillouin zone, and the phonon dispersion relations along the
main symmetry directions, examining the effect of spin-orbit coupling in both
phonon and electronic energies. Lastly, we report here cathodoluminescence
experiments at 83 K that set a lower limit to the electronic bandgap at 0.835
eV, pointing to an indirect nature, in agreement with our calculations. These
results shed light to essential properties of orthorhombic Bi2Se3 for further
understanding of the potential of this semiconductor for thermoelectrics and
new applications.

<h3>Volumetric glass modification with Gaussian and doughnut-shaped pulses:  From localized laser energy absorption to absorption delocalization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07257" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07257</a>
<br>
<i>Martin Zukerstein, Vladimir P. Zhukov, Yuri P. Meshcheryakov, Nadezhda M. Bulgakova</i>
<p>Volumetric modification of glass materials by ultrashort laser pulses is a
powerful technique enabling direct writing of three-dimensional structures for
fabrication of optical, photonic, and microfluidic devices. The level of
modification is determined by the locally absorbed energy density, which
depends on numerous factors. In this work, the effect of the spatial pulse
shape on the ultrashort laser excitation of fused silica was investigated
experimentally and theoretically for the volumetric modification regimes. We
focused on two shapes of laser pulses, Gaussian and doughnut-shaped (DS) ones.
It was found that, at relatively low pulse energies, in the range of 1-5
microjoules, the DS pulses are more efficient in volumetric structural changes
than Gaussian pulses. It is explained by the intensity clamping effect for the
Gaussian pulses, which leads to the delocalization of the laser energy
absorption. In the DS case, this effect is overcome due to the geometry of the
focused beam propagation, accompanied by the electron plasma formation, which
scatters light toward the beam axis. The thermoelastoplastic modeling performed
for the DS pulses revealed intriguing dynamics of the shock waves generated
because of tubular-like energy absorption. It is anticipated that such a double
shock wave structure can induce the formation of high-pressure polymorphs of
transparent materials that can be used for investigations of nonequilibrium
thermodynamics of warm dense matter. The DS laser pulses of low energies of the
order of 100 nanojoules which generate a gentle tubular-like modification can
be perspective for a miniature waveguide writing in glass.

<h3>Discrete Time Crystal Phase of Higher Dimensional Integrable Models</h3>

<p>This paper investigates the possibility of generating Floquet-time crystals
in higher dimensions ($d\geq 2$) through the time-periodic driving of
integrable free-fermionic models. The realization leads to rigid time-crystal
phases that are ideally resistant to thermalization and decoherence. By
utilizing spin-orbit coupling, we are able to realize a robust time-crystal
phase that can be detected using novel techniques. Moreover, we discuss the
significance of studying the highly persistent subharmonic responses and their
implementation in a Kitaev spin liquid, which contributes to our understanding
of time translational symmetry breaking and its practical implications.

<h3>Resonant soft X-ray scattering reveals hierarchical structure in a  multi-component vapor-deposited glass</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07280" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07280</a>
<br>
<i>Camille Bishop, Thomas J. Ferron, Marie E. Fiori, Connor G. Bischak, Eliot Gann, Cherno Jaye, Mark D. Ediger, Dean M. DeLongchamp</i>
<p>Multi-phase vapor-deposited glasses are an important class of materials for
organic electronics, particularly organic photovoltaics and thermoelectrics.
These blends are frequently regarded as molecular alloys and there have been
few studies of their structure at nanometer scales. Here we show that a
co-deposited system of TPD and Disperse Orange 37, two small molecule
glass-formers, separates into compositionally distinct phases with a domain
size and spacing that depends on substrate temperature during deposition.
Domains rich in one of the two components become larger and more pure at higher
deposition temperatures. We use resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS)
complemented with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and photo-induced force
microscopy (PiFM) to measure the phase separation, topography, and purity of
the deposited films. A forward-simulation approach to RSoXS analysis, the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) RSoXS Simulation Suite
(NRSS), is used with models developed from AFM images to evaluate the energy
dependence of scattering across multiple length scales and interpret the RSoXS
with respect to structure within the films. We find that the RSoXS is sensitive
to a hidden length scale of phase separation that is not apparent from the AFM
characterization alone. We demonstrate that vacuum scattering, which is often
ignored in RSoXS analysis, contributes significantly to the features and energy
dependence of the RSoXS pattern, and then illustrate how to properly account
for vacuum scattering to analyze films with significant roughness. We then use
this analysis framework to understand structure development mechanisms that
occur during vapor deposition of a TPD-DO37 co-deposited glass with results
that outline paths to tune morphology in multi-component materials.

<h3>The effects of interparticle cohesion on the collapse of granular  columns</h3>

<br>
<i>Ram Sudhir Sharma, Wladimir Sarlin, Langqi Xing, Cyprien Morize, Philippe Gondret, Alban Sauret</i>
<p>The presence of interparticle cohesion can drastically change the behavior of
granular materials. For instance, powders are challenging to handle, and one
can make a sandcastle using wet grains. In this study, we report experimental
results for columns of model cohesive grains collapsing under their own weight
in air and spreading on a rough horizontal surface. The effects of two
different sources of interparticle cohesion on two collapse geometries are
compared and rationalized in a common framework. Grains are made cohesive by
adding a small amount of water, such that they are in the pendular state, or by
applying a polymer coating. The effects of cohesion are reported for a
cylindrical column that spreads unconfined axisymmetrically and a confined
rectangular column that flows in a single direction. A dimensionless number,
comparing macroscopic cohesive strength to particle weight, is shown to capture
the effects of cohesion on the final morphology. To this end, a
characterization of the cohesive strength of the granular materials is
obtained, independent of the physical source of cohesion at the particle scale.
Such a framework allows for a common description of cohesive granular materials
with different sources of cohesion.

<h3>Virtual reassembling of 3D fragments for the data-driven analysis of  fracture mechanisms in composite materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07289" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07289</a>
<br>
<i>Thomas Wilhelm, Trang Thu Võ, Orkun Furat, Urs A. Peuker, Volker Schmidt</i>
<p>This paper introduces a novel method for characterizing fracture mechanisms
in composite materials using 3D image data gained by computed tomography (CT)
measurements. In mineral liberation, the understanding of these mechanisms is
crucial, particularly whether fractures occur along the boundaries of mineral
phases (intergranular fracture) and/or within mineral phases (transgranular
fracture). Conventional techniques for analyzing fracture mechanisms are
focused on globally comparing the surface exposure of mineral phases extracted
from image measurements before and after fracture. Instead, we present a
virtual reassembling algorithm based on image registration techniques, which is
applied to 3D data of composite materials before and after fracture in order to
determine and characterize the individual fracture surfaces. This enables us to
conduct a local quantitative analysis of fracture mechanisms by voxelwise
comparing adjacent regions at fracture surfaces. A quantitative analysis of
fracture mechanisms is especially important in the context of geometallurgical
recycling processes. As primary deposits are decreasing worldwide, the focus is
shifting to secondary raw materials containing low concentrations of valuable
elements such as lithium. To extract these elements, they can be enriched as
engineered artificial minerals in the slag phase of appropriately designed
cooling processes. The subsequent liberation through comminution processes,
such as crushing, is essential for the extraction of valuable minerals. A
better understanding of crushing processes, especially fracture mechanisms in
slags, is crucial for the success of recycling. The reassembling algorithm
presented in this paper is evaluated through a simulation study, followed by an
application to a naturally occurring ore and a slag resulting from a recycling
process.

<p>Results of spectroscopic studies at ambient and high pressures of a
LuAlO3:Ce3+ (LuAP:Ce) single crystalline film (SCF) as well as LuAP:Ce and
YAlO3:Ce (YAP:Ce) single crystals are reported. Room temperature absorption
measurements of the single crystals in the vacuum UV region allowed
establishing the bandgap energies of 7.63 eV for YAP and 7.86 eV for LuAP, with
an assumption of the direct band-gaps. Luminescence of Ce3+ in LuAP and YAP
bulk crystals was measured as a function of temperature from 6 K up to 873 K.
Temperature quenching of the Ce3+ luminescence in YAP:Ce was observed above 650
K, which is related to the location of the lowest Ce3+ 5d level at 1.27 eV
below the conduction band minimum. No temperature quenching occurred in LuAP:Ce
up to 873 K, mostly due to the lower energy of the 4f levels with respect to
the valence band maximum. The barycenter energies and splittings of Ce3+ 5d
states in YAP and LuAP at room temperature were precisely established.
Theoretical calculations of the Ce3+ 5d states energy structure under pressure
revealed a discrepancy between the obtained experimental results and the
prediction of Dorenbos' theoretical model. The discrepancy can be removed if
instead of the 5d state of the free Ce3+ ion the bandgap of the compound is
taken as reference energy for the red shift of the 5d level. This hypothesis
also allows us to take into account the pressure-induced increase of the
bandgap energy, expected for the studied compounds. Pressure dependences of
LuAP:Ce luminescence spectra suggest that a certain type of phase transition
occurs above 15 GPa.

<h3>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Polar Fluids</h3>

<br>
<i>Calum Gibb, Jordan Hobbs, Diana Nikolova, Tom Raistrick, Helen Gleeson, Richard Mandle</i>
<p>Spontaneous symmetry breaking and emergent polar order are each of
fundamental importance to a range of scientific disciplines, as well as
generating rich phase behaviour in liquid crystals (LCs). Here, we show the
union of these phenomena to lead to two previously undiscovered polar liquid
states of matter. Both phases have a lamellar structure with an inherent polar
ordering of their constituent molecules. The first of these phases is
characterised by polar order and a local tilted structure; the tilt direction
precesses about a helix orthogonal to the layer normal, the period of which is
such that we observe selective reflection of light. The second new phase type
is anti-ferroelectric, with the constituent molecules aligning orthogonally to
the layer normal. This has led us to term the phases the SmC_P^H and SmAAF
phases, respectively. Further to this, we obtain room temperature ferroelectric
nematic (NF) and SmC_P^Hphases via binary mixture formulation of the novel
materials described here with a standard NF compound (DIO), with the resultant
materials having melting points (and/or glass transitions) which are
significantly below ambient temperature.

<h3>A Qubit with Simultaneously Maximized Speed and Coherence</h3>

<p>To overcome the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computation, qubits have
to be protected from their noisy environment to attain the necessary high
fidelities. Recent experiments discovered sweet spots with strongly enhanced
coherence. However, decoupling a qubit from its surroundings also limits the
control over the qubit's state, typically leading to either coherent but slow
or fast but short-lived qubits. This trade-off appears to be a severe
fundamental limitation hampering the performance of qubits. Here, we show how
this can be circumvented by demonstrating a simultaneously fast and coherent
tunable regime in a hole spin qubit. In this regime, we can triple the
operation speed, while simultaneously quadrupling the coherence time when
tuning a local electric field, demonstrating that the qubit speed and coherence
scale together without compromise. This relies on strong, quasi 1D confinement
providing a local maximum in drive strength, where charge fluctuations are
decoupled and thus the coherence is enhanced, yet the drive speed is maximal. A
Ge/Si core/shell nanowire, operated at 1.5 K, provides the strong confinement.
The driving mechanism here is the strong and tunable direct Rashba spin-orbit
interaction, achieving a maximal strength at finite electrical field due to
gate-dependent heavy-hole light-hole mixing. Breaking the speed-coherence
trade-off makes it possible to boost fidelity and speed of one- and two-qubit
gates. This concept can be expanded to planar arrays of hole or electron spin
qubits as well. In this regime, the coupling to a microwave resonator is also
predicted to be both strong and coherent. Altogether, this is opening a new
path towards fault-tolerant quantum computation.

<p>High-entropy alloys have drawn recent interest for their promising mechanical
properties and irradiation resistance. Various properties, namely transport
properties, are controlled by point defect concentration, which must be known
before performing atomistic simulations to compute transport coefficients. In
this work, we present a general Langmuir-like model for impurity concentration
in an arbitrarily complex solid solution and apply this model to generate
expressions for concentrations of vacancies and small interstitial atoms. We
then calculate the vacancy concentration as a function of temperature in the
equiatomic CoNiCrFeMn and FeAl alloys with modified embedded-atom-method
potentials for various chemical orderings, showing there is no clear
correlation between vacancy thermodynamics and chemical ordering in the
CoNiCrFeMn alloy but clear systematic patterns for FeAl.

<h3>Chemical inhomogeneities in high-entropy alloys help mitigate the  strength-ductility trade-off</h3>

<br>
<i>Evan Ma, Chang Liu</i>
<p>Metallurgists have long been accustomed to a trade-off between yield strength
and tensile ductility. Extending previously known strain-hardening mechanisms,
the emerging multi-principal-element alloys (MPEAs) offer additional help in
promoting the strength-ductility synergy, towards gigapascal yield strength
simultaneously with pure-metal-like tensile ductility. The highly concentrated
chemical make-up in these 'high-entropy' alloys (HEAs) adds, at ultrafine
spatial scale from sub-nanometer to tens of nanometers, inherent chemical
inhomogeneities in local composition and local chemical order (LCO). These
institute a 'nano-cocktail' environment that exerts extra dragging forces,
rendering a much wavier motion of dislocation lines (in stick-slip mode)
different from dilute solutions. The variable fault energy landscape also makes
the dislocation movement sluggish, increasing their chances to hit one another
and react to increase entanglement. The accumulation of dislocations (plus
faults) dynamically stores obstacles against ensuing dislocation motion to
sustain an adequate strain-hardening rate at high flow stresses, delaying
plastic instability to enable large (uniform) elongation. The successes
summarized advocate MPEAs as an effective recipe towards ultrahigh strength at
little expense of tensile ductility. The insight gained also answers the
question as to what new mechanical behavior the HEAs have to offer, beyond what
has been well documented for traditional metals and solid solutions.

<h3>Magnetism and superconductivity in the $t-J$ model of $La_3Ni_2O_7$  under multiband Gutzwiller approximation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07449" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07449</a>
<br>
<i>Jie-Ran Xue, Fa Wang</i>
<p>The recent discovery of possible high temperature superconductivity in single
crystals of $La_3Ni_2O_7$ under pressure renews the interest in research on
nickelates. The DFT calculations reveal that both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$
orbitals are active, which suggests a minimal two-orbital model to capture the
low-energy physics of this system. In this work, we study a bilayer two-orbital
$t-J$ model within multiband Gutzwiller approximation, and discuss the
magnetism as well as the superconductivity over a wide range of the hole
doping. Owing to the inter-orbital super-exchange process between $d_{z^2}$ and
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, the induced ferromagnetic coupling within layers
competes with the conventional antiferromagnetic coupling, and leads to
complicated hole doping dependence for the magnetic properties in the system.
With increasing hole doping, the system transfers to A-AFM state from the
starting G-AFM state. We also find the inter-layer superconducting pairing of
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals dominates due to the large hopping parameter of
$d_{z^2}$ along the vertical inter-layer bonds and significant Hund's coupling
between $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Meanwhile, the G-AFM state and
superconductivity state can coexist in the low hole doping regime. To take
account of the pressure, we also analyze the impacts of inter-layer hopping
amplitude on the system properties.

<h3>Fermi arcs mediated transport in inversion symmetry-broken Weyl  semimetal nanowire and its hybrid junctions</h3>

<br>
<i>Amartya Pal, Paramita Dutta, Arijit Saha</i>
<p>The emergence of gapless surface states, known as Fermi arcs (FAs), is one of
the unique properties of the novel topological Weyl semimetal (WSM). However,
extracting the signatures of FAs from the bulk states has always been a
challenge as both of them are gapless in nature and connected to each other. We
capture the signatures of FAs via transport in an inversion symmetry
(IS)-broken WSM. We study the band structure and the properties of FAs like
shape, spin polarization considering slab and nanowire (NW) geometry, and then
compute the two-terminal conductance in WSM NW in terms of the scattering
coefficients within the Landauer formalism. We find the FA-mediated conductance
to be quantized in units of $2e^2/h$. We extend our study to the transport in
WSM/Weyl superconductor (WSC) NW hybrid junction using the
Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) formalism. We show that due to the intricate
spin textures, the signatures of the FAs can be captured via Andreev reflection
process. We also show that our results of conductance are robust against
delta-correlated quenched disorder and thus enhancing the experimental
feasibility.

phenomenological mean-field equation-of-motion approach to study the model. We
investigate several parameter regimes of the variables (magnetic field,
anisotropy, and the external drive frequency) that influence the anisotropic
$XY$ system. We identify four possible dynamical phases -- Ising-SBO,
Ising-SRO, $XY$-SBO and $XY$-SRO. Both techniques indicate that only three of
them (Ising-SRO, Ising-SBO, and $XY$-SRO) are stable dynamical phases in the
thermodynamic sense. Within the Monte Carlo framework, a finite size scaling
analysis shows that $XY$-SBO does not survive in the thermodynamic limit giving
way to either an Ising-SBO or a $XY$-SRO regime. The finite size scaling
analysis further shows that the transitions between the three remaining
dynamical phases either belong to the two-dimensional Ising universality class
or are first-order in nature. From the perspective of the mean-field
calculations, $XY$-SBO represents a transient dynamical feature that is
eventually lost to either Ising-SBO or $XY$-SRO.

<h3>Tuning proximity spin-orbit coupling in graphene/NbSe$_2$  heterostructures via twist angle</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07533" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07533</a>
<br>
<i>Thomas Naimer, Martin Gmitra, Jaroslav Fabian</i>
<p>We investigate the effect of the twist angle on the proximity spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) in graphene/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures from first principles. The
low-energy Dirac bands of several different commensurate twisted supercells are
fitted to a model Hamiltonian, allowing us to study the twist-angle dependency
of the SOC in detail. We predict that the magnitude of the Rashba SOC can
triple, when going from $\Theta=0^\circ$ to $\Theta=30^\circ$ twist angle.
Furthermore, at a twist angle of $\Theta\approx23^\circ$ the in-plane spin
texture acquires a large radial component, corresponding to a Rashba angle of
up to $\Phi=25^\circ$. The twist-angle dependence of the extracted proximity
SOC is explained by analyzing the orbital decomposition of the Dirac states to
reveal with which NbSe$_2$ bands they hybridize strongest. Finally, we employ a
Kubo formula to evaluate the efficiency of conventional and unconventional
charge-to-spin conversion in the studied heterostructures.

<h3>Uniaxial Compression based Recovery Analyses to Describe  Polymer-Specific and Universal Nanoindentation Deformation Phenomena</h3>

<br>
<i>Prakash Sarkar, Hemant Nanavati</i>
<p>Sharp tip nanoindentation of glassy polymers is a constrained, localized
viscoelastoplastic deformation. We interpret this complexity, in terms of the
well-understood uniaxial deformation. From the uniaxial compression data in the
literature, for PMMA, PC and crosslinked SU-8, we obtain their universal,
yield-normalized recovery curves, with eps*=eps/eps_y, being one measure of the
corresponding strain states (CSS). Nanoindentation recovery is determined from
the 2sec constant rate unloading h-P data, modeled by a generalized power-law
(variable power exponent). Comparing these data-sets, yields the correlation
coefficient between the notional nanoindentation strain rate epsdot_N and
strain and true strain rate and strain, c=epsdot_N/epsdot_t=eps_N/eps_t. The
equivalent strain, eps, and the c value for any polymer, are within a narrow
range, from the onset of indentation. Combining residual profiles via scanning
probe microscopy with mathematical modeling of the indenter tip, provides the
strain distribution beneath the tip. CSS measures examined here, indicate
polymer-specific regions to regions common to glassy polymers, which are
reached very early in the nanoindentation.

<i>Juan Daniel Torres Luna, A. Mert Bozkurt, Michael Wimmer, Chun-Xiao Liu</i>
<p>Connecting quantum dots through Andreev bound states in a
semiconductor-superconductor hybrid provides a platform to create a Kitaev
chain. Interestingly, in a double quantum dot, a pair of poor man's Majorana
zero modes can emerge when the system is fine-tuned to a sweet spot, where
superconducting and normal couplings are equal in magnitude. Control of the
Andreev bound states is crucial for achieving this, usually implemented by
varying its chemical potential. In this work, we propose using Andreev bound
states in a narrow Josephson junction to mediate both types of couplings, with
the ratio tunable by the phase difference across the junction. Now a minimal
Kitaev chain can be easily tuned into the strong coupling regime by varying the
phase and junction asymmetry, even without changing the dot-hybrid coupling
strength. Furthermore, we identify an optimal sweet spot at $\pi$ phase,
enhancing the excitation gap and robustness against phase fluctuations. Our
proposal introduces a new device platform and a new tuning method for realizing
quantum-dot-based Kitaev chains.

<p>Rhenium-based superconductors have recently attracted significant interest
due to their unconventional superconducting properties. In this work, we report
the synthesis and properties of new superconducting Re$_{7}$X$_{3}$ (X = Nb,
Ta, Ti, Zr, Hf) binary alloys which maintain a fixed composition of rhenium
while crystallizing in centrosymmetric to non-centrosymmetric crystal
structures, depending on the elements of the X site. Comprehensive structural
and superconducting properties were investigated using powder x-ray
diffraction, AC transport, magnetization, and specific heat measurements, and
on the basis of these measurements, the superconducting phase diagram was
constructed. The results suggest a complex interplay of crystal structure and
the Re/X ratio, which governs the strength of spin-orbital coupling and
controls the unconventional superconducting behavior in Re-based
superconductors.

<i>Rakesh Kumar Malakar, Asim Kumar Ghosh</i>
<p>Magnetic and topological properties along with quantum correlations in terms
of several entanglement measures have been investigated for an
antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 XY model in the presence of transverse magnetic
field and XZX$-$YZY type of three-spin interactions. Symmetries of the spin
Hamiltonian have been identified. Under the Jordan-Wigner transformation, the
spin Hamiltonian converted into spinless superconducting model with nearest
neighbor hopping and Cooper pairing terms in addition to next nearest neighbor
Cooper pairing potential. Long range antiferromagnetic order has been studied
in terms of staggered spin-spin correlation functions, while the topological
orders have been characterized by winding numbers. Magnetic and topological
phase diagrams have been prepared. Faithful coexistence of magnetic and
topological superconducting phases is found in the entire parameter regime.
Boundaries of various quantum phases have been marked and positions of
bicritical points have been identified.

<p>This paper presents the development of a superconducting nanowire
single-photon detector (SNSPD) integrated into a distributed Bragg reflector
(DBR) with a design center wavelength of 830 nm and a width of 200 nm. This
SNSPD is made of a superconducting niobium nitride (NbN) thin film that is
produced using plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD). The DBR is made
of 15 alternating layers of silicon nitride and silicon oxide that are produced
through plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The reflection
efficiency of the mirror is 90% at a wavelength of 830 nm. For sufficient
optical coupling, an optical micro-connector optimized for multimode or
single-mode optical fibers with a diameter of 128 {\mu}m was formed using
two-photon polymerization techniques. The niobium nitride film was deposited
onto the DBR surface in-situ in two separate reactors connected by a vacuum
transfer. The in-situ technique of deposition of a superconducting niobium
nitride film and a distributed Bragg reflector has allowed achieving a
detection efficiency of 90% at a wavelength of 830 nm and a dark count rate of
10 s-1 at a temperature of 2.5 K. Additionally, the detector jitter was 50 ps.

<i>Gurkirat Singh, Surajit Bera, Vijay B. Shenoy</i>
<p>We explore phases of free fermions on arenas that do not tessellate a
manifold. Specializing to arboreal arenas described by tree graphs which
possess a notion of translation symmetry, we study possible fermionic phases in
the BDI symmetry class on the $p$-coordinated Bethe lattice. We find that there
are $p$ distinct obstructed atomic insulating phases that are characterized by
distinct edge states, pattern of entanglement, and a winding characteristic
that we define here. These distinct insulting phases are always separated by a
metallic region in the parameter space rather than isolated quantum critical
points. The metallic region itself comprises several distinct metallic phases
that are distinguished by the winding characteristic and correlation functions.
The correlation functions of distinct subsystems display non-analytic behavior
at distinct points in the metallic region, signaling a cascade of subsystem
transitions. An intriguing feature of these arboreal metals is the presence of
truncated subsystems with zero energy boundary modes despite being gapless.
This work suggests new opportunities for synthetic quantum systems to realize
these novel phases.

<p>The emergence of correlated phenomena arising from the combination of
1$\mathrm{T}$ and 1$\mathrm{H}$ van der Waals layers is the focus of intense
research. Here, we synthesize a novel self-stacked 6$\mathrm{R}$ phase in
NbSeTe, showing a perfect alternating 1T and 1H layers that grow coherently
along the c-direction, as revealed by scanning transmission electron
microscopy. Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy shows a mixed
contribution of the trigonal and octahedral Nb bands to the Fermi level.
Diffuse scattering reveals temperature-independent short-range charge
fluctuations with propagation vector $\mathrm{q_{CO}}$=(0.25,0), derived from
the condensation of a longitudinal mode in the 1T layer. We observe that ligand
disorder quenches the formation of a charge density wave. Magnetization
measurements suggest the presence of an inhomogeneous, short-range magnetic
order, further supported by the absence of a clear phase transition in the
specific heat. These experimental analyses in combination with \textit{ab
initio} calculations indicate that the ground state of 6$\mathrm{R}$-NbSeTe is
described by a statistical distribution of short-range charge-modulated and
spin-correlated regions driven by ligand disorder. Our results devise a route
to synthesize 1$\mathrm{T}$-1$\mathrm{H}$ self-stacked bulk heterostructures to
study emergent phases of matter.

<i>Yaorui Tan, Maolin Bo</i>
<p>Despite the extensive applications of perovskite compounds, the precise
nature of non-Hermitian bonding in these materials remains poorly understood.
In this study, density functional theory calculations were performed to
determine the electronic structures of perovskite compounds. In particular, the
bandgaps of Ba$_2$ScNbO$_6$ and Ba$_2$LuNbO$_6$ were found to be 2.617 and
2.629 eV, respectively, and the deformation bond energies and non-Hermitian
bonding of these compounds were calculated. The relationship between the
non-Hermitian zeros of the O-Nb bond of Ba$_2$ScNbO$_6$ and the non-Hermitian
zeros of the Sc-O bond was found to be similar but with varying sizes. Further,
in-depth research on the non-Hermitian chemistry verified that precise control
of atomic bonding and electron states can be achieved, providing new insights
into the study of chemical bonds.

<p>In this study, novel flexible micro-scale humidity sensors were directly
fabricated in graphene oxide (GO) and polyimide (PI) using ion beam writing
without any further modifications, and then successfully tested in an
atmospheric chamber. Two low fluences of carbon ions with an energy of 5 MeV
were used, and structural changes in the irradiated materials were expected.
The shape and structure of prepared micro-sensors were studied using scanning
electron microscopy (SEM). The structural and compositional changes in the
irradiated area were characterized using micro-Raman spectroscopy, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Rutherford back-scattering spectroscopy
(RBS), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and elastic recoil detection
analysis (ERDA) spectroscopy. The sensing performance was tested at a relative
humidity (RH) ranging from 5 % to 60 %, where the electrical conductivity of PI
varied by three orders of magnitude, and the electrical capacitance of GO
varied in the order of pico-farads. In addition, the PI sensor has proven
long-term sensing stability in air. We demonstrated a novel method of ion
micro-beam writing to prepare flexible micro-sensors that function over a wide
range of humidity and have good sensitivity and great potential for widespread
applications.

<h3>Band engineering of phosphorene/graphene van der Waals nanoribbons  toward high-efficiency thermoelectric devices</h3>

<br>
<i>Maryam Mahdavifar, Farhad Khoeini, Francois M. Peeters</i>
<p>Vertical integration of dissimilar layered materials in a so-called van der
Waals (vdW) heterostructure (HS) has emerged as a useful tool to engineer band
alignments and interfaces. In this paper, we investigate thermoelectric
currents in a phosphorene/graphene vdW nanoribbon consisting of an armchair
graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) stacked on an armchair phosphorene nanoribbon
(APNR). We focus on the currents driven by a temperature difference between the
leads in a two-probe junction. In contrast to pristine AGNRs and APNRs, such an
armchair-edged HS can provide several nano-amperes of the current at room
temperature, without any external field. External electric fields modify the
electronic band structure and are able to induce a type-I to type-II band
alignment transition and a direct-to-indirect band gap transition. Biasing the
APNR/AGNR by an external electric field is found to strongly increase the
thermally induced current and also control the direction of current flow at
moderate temperatures. These results are important for potential applications
of the APNR/AGNR vdW HS in flexible electronics and thermoelectric devices.

<p>The expected shortage of Li due to the strong increase in electromobility is
an important issue for the recovery of Li from spent Li-ion batteries. One
approach is pyrometallurgical processing, during which ignoble elements such as
Li, Al and Mn enter the slag system. The Engineered Artificial Minerals (EnAM)
strategy aims to efficiently recover critical elements. This study focuses on
stabilizing Li-manganates in a synthetic slag and investigates the relationship
between Mn4+ and Mg and Al in relation to phase formation. Therefore, three
synthetic slags (Li, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Mn, O) were synthesized. In addition to
LiMn3+O2, Li2Mn4+O3 was also stabilized. Both phases crystallized in a
Ca-silicate-rich matrix. In the structure of Li2MnO3 and LiMnO2, Li and Mn can
substitute each other in certain proportions. As long as a mix of Mn2+ and Mn3+
is present in the slag, spinels form through the addition of Mg and/or Al.

<h3>Path Integral Monte Carlo Study of a Doubly-Dipolar Bose Gas</h3>

<br>
<i>Ratheejit Ghosh, Matteo Ciardi, Rejish Nath, Fabio Cinti</i>
<p>By combining first-principles path integral Monte Carlo methods and
mean-field techniques, we explore the properties of cylindrically trapped
doubly-dipolar Bose gases. We first verify the emergence of a pancake quantum
droplet at low temperatures, validating previously mean-field calculations. In
a regime of small doubly-dipolar interactions, first-principles calculations
agree with the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Such an accordance
disappears in a large interaction limit. Here the path integral Monte Carlo
estimates the strong doubly-dipolar regime with accuracy. On the contrary, the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation does not seize quantum fluctuations in full. We also
provide a complete description of the system's quantum behavior in a wide range
of parameters. When the system forms a droplet, the superfluid fraction
exhibits an anisotropic behavior if compared to the usual Bose gas regime.
Interestingly, we observe that the transition temperature from thermal gas to
droplet results higher than that of the thermal gas to a Bose-Einstein
condensate, indicating the robustness of the droplet against thermal
fluctuations. Further, we investigate the anisotropic behavior of the
superfluid fraction during the structural transition from a pancake to a
cigar-shaped droplet by varying the ratio between electric and magnetic dipole
interaction strengths. Our findings furnish evidence that the stability of
doubly-dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates can be detected in experiments by
means of dysprosium atoms.

<p>Continuum of spin excitations observed in inelastic neutron scattering
experiments are often considered as a strong evidence of quantum spin liquid
formation. When quantum spin liquid is indeed the ground state of a
disorder-free magnetic compound, the elementary excitation is no longer the
conventional spin waves (magnons). Instead, the magnons fractionalize into
spinons, leaving only a two-spinon continuum detectable in inelastic neutron
scattering experiments. For a clean ordered antiferromagnet, it was unclear if
we can observe a continuous spectrum similar to the ones in a quantum spin
liquid state. Here we show that the magnetically ordered state in
Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$ is able to host a spin excitation continuum induced by
strong quantum fluctuations. Thus, a second thought is necessary when
concluding such continuum as signature of quantum spin liquid in new material
explorations.

<p>Based on the magnetic Floquet-Bloch theory, we investigate topological
natures of Floquet magnons in a laser-irradiated kagome magnet exhibiting
Heisenberg, Kitaev and Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interactions in the presence of an
external magnetic field applied along directions of [111]. In a strong magnetic
field perpendicular to the lattice plane [111] direction, the system is in the
fully polarized paramagnetic phase and the magnon band carries an asymmetric
Chern number throughout the region of the phase diagram. Our results show that
periodically driven intrinsic topological magnetic materials can be manipulated
into different topological phases with different thermal conductivities and
Berry curvature signatures by adjusting the light intensity throughout the
phase diagram region.

<h3>Tuning Structural and Electronic Properties of Metal-Organic Framework 5  by Metal Substitution and Linker Functionalization</h3>

<i>Joshua Edzards, Holger-Dietrich Saßnick, Julia Santana Andreo, Caterina Cocchi</i>
<p>The chemical flexibility of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) offers an ideal
platform to tune structure and composition for specific applications, from gas
sensing to catalysis and from photoelectric conversion to energy storage. This
variability gives rise to a large configurational space that can be efficiently
explored using high-throughput computational methods. In this work, we
investigate from first principles the structural and electronic properties of
MOF-5 variants obtained by replacing Zn with Be, Mg, Cd, Ca, Sr, and Ba, and by
functionalizing the originally H-passivated linkers with CH$_3$, NO$_2$, Cl,
Br, NH$_2$, OH, and COOH groups. To build and analyze the resulting 56
structures, we employ density-functional theory calculations embedded in an
in-house developed library for automatized calculations. Our findings reveal
that structural properties are mainly defined by metal atoms and large
functional groups which distort the lattice and modify coordination. Stability
is largely influenced by functionalization and enhanced by COOH and OH groups
which promote the formation of hydrogen bonds. The charge distribution within
the linker is especially influenced by functional groups with
electron-withdrawing character while the metal nodes play a minor role.
Likewise, the band-gap size is crucially determined by ligand
functionalization. The smallest gaps are found with NH$_2$ and OH groups which
introduce localized orbitals at the top of the valence band. This
characteristic makes these functionalizations particularly promising for the
design of MOF-5 variants with enhanced gas uptake and sensing properties.

<br>
<i>Ruda Guo, Yue-Xin Huang, Xiaoxin Yang, Yi Liu, Cong Xiao, Zhe Yuan</i>
<p>Nonlinear spin polarization occurring in the second order of driving electric
current is the dominant source of nonequilibrium magnetization in
centrosymmetric or weakly noncentrosymmetric nonmagnetic materials, and induces
nonlinear spin-orbit torque in magnets. Up to now, only the intrinsic mechanism
based on anomalous spin polarizability dipole, which is the spin counterpart of
Berry curvature dipole, has been studied, while disorder induced mechanisms are
still missing. Here, we derive these contributions, which include not only the
anomalous distribution function due to skew scattering and coordinate shift,
but also interband coherence effects given by disorder induced spin shift and
electric field induced anomalous scattering amplitude. We demonstrate these
terms and show their importance in a minimal model. A scaling law for nonlinear
current-induced spin polarization is constructed, which may help analyze
experimental data in the future.

<i>Bernard Dieny, Olivier Fruchart, Ernesto E. Marinero</i>
<p>This paper delves into the origins and specificity of the unique stable spin
textures (360{\deg} closed loop domain walls and skyrmions) observed in
exchange-biased systems, with either in-plane or out-of-plane magnetic
anisotropy. In the case of skyrmions, which are nanometer-sized bubbles
consisting of closed-loop 180{\deg} walls in perpendicularly-magnetized media,
the stability of these spin textures arises from the existence of
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interactions (DMI). These interactions induce chirality
of the domain walls, yielding to some extent a so-called topological
protection. More complex structures such as skyrmoniums have been observed,
consisting of closed loop 360{\deg} walls. Recently, skyrmions formed in the
absence of an applied external magnetic field have been stabilized in exchange
biased out-of-plane magnetized systems. About two decades ago, another type of
stable spin-textures were observed in exchange biased systems, with in-plane
magnetization, in particular in the pinned reference layer of spin-valves.
These textures consist of 360{\deg}-domain-wall rings, the stability of which
arises from the easy-plane shape anisotropy of these layers. In this paper, we
compare these spin-textures and highlight the similarities and differences in
their formation, structure and origin of their stability.

<i>A. Varghese, M. Arana-Catania, S. Mori, A. Encinas-Oropesa, J. Sumner</i>
<p>Gas turbine superalloys experience hot corrosion, driven by factors including
corrosive deposit flux, temperature, gas composition, and component material.
The full mechanism still needs clarification and research often focuses on
laboratory work. As such, there is interest in causal discovery to confirm the
significance of factors and identify potential missing causal relationships or
co-dependencies between these factors. The causal discovery algorithm Fast
Causal Inference (FCI) has been trialled on a small set of laboratory data,
with the outputs evaluated for their significance to corrosion propagation, and
compared to existing mechanistic understanding. FCI identified the salt
deposition flux as the most influential corrosion variable for this limited
dataset. However, HCl was the second most influential for pitting regions,
compared to temperature for more uniformly corroding regions. Thus FCI
generated causal links aligned with literature from a randomised corrosion
dataset, while also identifying the presence of two different degradation modes
in operation.

<h3>First-Order Phase Transition in Perovskites  Pr$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ - Magneto-Caloric Properties -- Effect of  Multi-Spin Interaction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07820" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07820</a>
<br>
<i>Yethreb Essouda, Hung T. Diep, Mohamed Ellouze</i>
<p>We show by extensive Monte Carlo simulations that we need a multi-spin
interaction in addition to pairwise interactions in order to reproduce the
temperature dependence of the experimental magnetization observed in the
perovskite compound Pr$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$. The multi-spin interaction
is introduced in the Hamiltonian as follows: each spin interacts simultaneously
with its four nearest-neighbors. It does not have the reversal invariance as in
a pairwise interaction where reversing the directions of two spins leaves the
interaction energy invariant. As a consequence, it competes with the pairwise
interactions between magnetic ions. The multi-spin interaction allows the
sample magnetization $M$ to increase, to decrease or to have a plateau with
increasing $T$. In this paper we show that $M$ increases with increasing $T$
before making a vertical fall at the transition temperature $T_C$, in contrast
to the usual decrease of $M$ with increasing $T$ in most of magnetic systems.
This result is in an excellent agreement with the experimental data observed in
Pr$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$. Furthermore, we show by the energy histogram
taken at $T_C$ that the transition is clearly of first order. We also calculate
the magnetic entropy change $|\Delta S_m|$ and the Relative Cooling Power (RCP)
by using the set of curves of $M$ obtained under an applied magnetic field $H$
varying from 0 to 5 Tesla across the transition temperature region. We obtain a
good agreement with experiments on $|\Delta S_m|$ and the values of RCP. This
perovskite compound has a good potential in refrigeration application due to
its high RCP.

<i>Nathanael S. Schwindt, Mor Avidar, Razi Epsztein, Anthony P. Straub, Michael R. Shirts</i>
<p>Major efforts in recent years have been directed towards understanding
molecular transport in polymeric membranes. Transition-state theory is an
increasingly common approach to explore mechanisms of transmembrane permeation
with molecular details, but most applications treat all free energy barriers to
transport as equal. This assumption neglects the inherent structural and
chemical heterogeneity in polymeric membranes. In this work, we expand the
transition-state theory framework to include distributions of membrane free
energy barriers. We show that the highest free energy barriers along the most
permeable paths, rather than typical paths, provide the largest contributions
to the experimentally-observed effective free energy barrier. We show that even
moderate, random heterogeneity in molecular barriers will significantly impact
how we interpret the mechanisms of transport through membranes. Naive
interpretations of experimentally measured barriers can lead to incorrect
assumptions about the underlying mechanisms governing transport and miss the
mechanisms most relevant to the overall permeability.

<h3>Self-heating effects and switching dynamics in graphene multiterminal  Josephson junctions</h3>

<p>We experimentally investigate the electronic transport properties of a
three-terminal graphene Josephson junction. We find that self-heating effects
strongly influence the behaviour of this multiterminal Josephson junction
(MTJJ) system. We show that existing simulation methods based on resistively
and capacitively shunted Josephson junction networks can be significantly
improved by taking into account these heating effects. We also investigate the
phase dynamics in our MTJJ by measuring its switching current distribution and
find correlated switching events in different junctions. We show that the
switching dynamics is governed by phase diffusion at low temperatures.
Furthermore, we find that self-heating introduces additional damping which
results in overdamped I-V characteristics when normal and supercurrents coexist
in the device.

<h3>Phonon and defect mediated quantum anomalous Hall insulator to metal  transition in magnetically doped topological insulators</h3>

<p>Quantum Anomalous Hall (QAH) state in six quintuple layer
Cr$_{0.1}$(Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{0.8}$)$_{1.9}$Te$_3$ thin films were studied through
scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and electrical transport measurements.
While the surface state is gapless above the Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{C}
\approx 30$ K), scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) of the sample reveals a
topologically non-trivial gap with an average value of $\approx 13.5$ meV at
4.2 K below the ferromagnetic transition. Nonetheless, areal STS scans of the
magnetic topological insulator exhibit energy modulations on the order of
several meV's in the surface bands which result in the valence band maximum in
some regions becoming higher than the energy of the conduction band minimum of
some other regions that are spatially separated by no more than 3 nm. First
principle calculations demonstrate that the origin of the observed
inhomogeneous energy band alignment is an outcome of many-body interactions,
namely electron-defect interactions and electron-phonon interactions. Defects
play the role of locally modifying the energy landscape of surface bands while
electron-phonon interactions renormalize the surface bands such that the
surface gap becomes reduced by more than 1 meV as temperature is raised from 0
to 4.2 K. These many-body interactions at a finite temperature result in
substantial increase of electron tunneling across the spatially separated
conduction band pockets even for finite temperatures well below $T_\mathrm{C}$
, thus driving the magnetic topological insulator out of its QAH insulating
phase into a metallic phase at a relatively low temperature.

<h3>Hybrid acousto-optical swing-up preparation of exciton and biexciton  states in a quantum dot</h3>

<p>Recent years brought the idea of hybrid systems, in which quantum degrees of
freedom, due to controlled couplings, allow the transfer of quantum information
and may lead to the emergence of new generation devices. Due to the universal
coupling with all solid-state systems and compatibility with miniaturization,
acoustic fields will play an important role in interfacing such components.
Optically active quantum dots (QDs) are at the forefront of systems for
applications in quantum technologies and their multiple available interfaces
make them a great component of hybrid systems. QDs generate
polarization-entangled photon pairs, however deterministic and high-fidelity
preparation of the state is needed. All resonant schemes need filtering to
distinguish emitted photons from the excitation pulse, which limits the photon
yield significantly. Thus, non-resonant excitation methods are needed like the
recently proposed and successful swing-up scheme. Here, we propose a hybrid
acousto-optical version of this non-resonant scheme to prepare exciton and
biexciton states. We show that using acoustic modulation allows selectively
exciting either exciton or biexciton states with just one mode of vibration and
one optical pulse or vice versa: acoustic pulse during detuned optical driving.
Thus, either of the fields can act as a trigger controlling the evolution.
Further, we evaluate the impact of phonon decoherence at finite temperatures
for two types of application-relevant QDs, InAs/GaAs and GaAs/AlGaAs, and find
that for GaAs QDs exciton preparation can be almost decoherence-free even at
liquid nitrogen temperatures already with currently available acoustic
modulation frequencies. This approach may pave the way for generating
entanglement between an emitter and a quantum acoustic mode when using the
acoustic mode as a trigger for the transitions.

<h3>The $s^\pm$-Wave Superconductivity in the Pressurized  La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07902" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07902</a>

<i>Ming Zhang, Hongyi Sun, Yu-Bo Liu, Qihang Liu, Wei-Qiang Chen, Fan Yang</i>
<p>Recently, evidence of superconductivity (SC) has been reported in pressurized
La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Here we study the possible pairing mechanism and pairing
symmetry in this material. Through fitting the density-functional-theory band
structure, we provide a six-orbital tight-binding model. In comparison with the
band structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the additional non-bonding $d_{z^2}$ band
is importance to the pairing mechanism here. When the multi-orbital Hubbard
interactions are included, our random-phase-approximation based study yields an
$s^{\pm}$-wave pairing with $T_c$ significantly lower than that in pressurized
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$. The dominant FS nesting with nesting vector
$\mathbf{Q}_1\approx (\pi,\pi)$ is between the $M$-pocket contributed by the
bonding $d_{z^2}$ band top and the local bottom regime of the non-bonding
3$d_{z^2}$ band near the $\Gamma$-point, leading to the strongest pairing gap
amplitude and opposite gap signs within the two regimes. The dominant
real-space pairing is the interlayer pairing between the $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. We
have also studied the doping dependence of the pairing symmetry and $T_c$.
