</p><i>Yashraj M. Wani, Penelope Grace Kovakas, Arash Nikoubashman, Michael P. Howard</i>
<p>We determine the long-time self-diffusion coefficient and sedimentation
coefficient for suspensions of nanoparticles with anisotropic shapes
(octahedra, cubes, tetrahedra, and spherocylinders) as a function of
nanoparticle concentration using mesoscale simulations. We use a discrete
particle model for the nanoparticles, and we account for solvent-mediated
hydrodynamic interactions between nanoparticles using the multiparticle
collision dynamics method. Our simulations are compared to theoretical
predictions and experimental data from existing literature, demonstrating good
agreement in the majority of cases. Further, we find that the self-diffusion
coefficient of the regular polyhedral shapes can be estimated from that of a
sphere whose diameter is average of their inscribed and circumscribed sphere
diameters.

<h3>Two Ultracold Atoms in a Quasi-Two-Dimensional Box Confinement</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02349" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02349</a>
<br>
</p><i>Fan Yang, Ruijie Du, Ran Qi, Peng Zhang</i>
<p>We investigate the scattering and two-body bound states of two ultracold
atoms in a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) confinement, with the confinement
potential being an infinite square well (box potential) in the transverse
($z$-) direction, and the motion of the atoms in the $x$-$y$ plane being free.
Specifically, we calculate the effective 2D scattering length and 2D effective
range of the low-energy scattering, as well as the energy and the
transverse-excited-mode probability of the bound states. Comparing these
results with those obtained under a harmonic transverse confinement potential,
we find that in most of the cases the 2D effective range for the box
confinement is approximately 0.28 of the one for the harmonic confinement.
Moreover, the transverse-excited-mode probability of the bound states for the
box confinement is also much lower than the one for the harmonic confinement.
These results suggest that the transverse excitation in the box confinement is
notably weaker than the one in a harmonic confinement. Therefore, achieving
quasi-2D ultracold gases well-described by pure-2D effective models,
particularly those with 2D contact interaction, is more feasible through box
confinement. Our results are helpful for the quantum simulation of 2D many-body
physics with ultracold atoms, e.g., the suppression of 2D effective range may
lead to an enhancement of quantum anomaly in two-dimensional Fermi Gases.
Additionally, our calculation method is applicable to the two-body problems of
ultracold atoms in other types of quasi-2D confinements.

<h3>Order-by-disorder without quantum zero-point fluctuations in the  pyrochlore Heisenberg ferromagnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02391" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02391</a>
<br>
</p><i>Alexander Hickey, Daniel Lozano-Gómez, Michel J. P. Gingras</i>
<p>Order-by-disorder, whereby fluctuations lift an accidental classical ground
state degeneracy to stabilize a subset of ordered states, is a recurrent and
prominent theme in the field of frustrated magnetism where magnetic moments, or
spins, are subject to competing interactions. Thus far, such a phenomenon has
been discussed in systems where the quantum ground state is not a product
state. In this circumstance, both thermal and quantum fluctuations act to lift
the accidental classical degeneracy, begging the question whether one mechanism
of order-by-disorder is possible without the other. In this paper, we present
results exposing a novel route to order-by-disorder, without quantum zero-point
fluctuations, in a family of ferromagnetic Heisenberg materials with the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction as the leading perturbation. We prove
that any colinear ferromagnetic state is an exact eigenstate, even in the
presence of the anisotropic DM interaction, while thermal fluctuations give
rise to a preference in the magnetization direction. Here, we present in detail
an example of the pyrochlore Heisenberg ferromagnet with DM interactions. Using
both linear spin-wave theory and classical Monte Carlo simulations, we find
that the magnetization can spontaneously rotate at intermediate temperature(s)
within the colinear ferromagnetic phase when the DM interaction is large.
Additionally, we find that in the large DM regime, the ferromagnetic ground
state becomes unstable within the framework of non-linear spin-wave theory. Our
results show that thermal order-by-disorder is possible even in the absence of
quantum zero-point fluctuations.

<h3>Enhanced many-body quantum scars from the non-Hermitian Fock skin effect</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02395" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02395</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ruizhe Shen, Fang Qin, Jean-Yves Desaules, Zlatko Papić, Ching Hua Lee</i>
<p>In contrast with extended Bloch waves, a single particle can become spatially
localized due to the so-called skin effect originating from non-Hermitian
pumping. Here we show that in a wide class of kinetically constrained many-body
systems, the skin effect can instead manifest as dynamical amplification within
the Fock space, beyond the intuitively expected and previously studied particle
localization and clustering. We exemplify this non-Hermitian Fock skin effect
in an asymmetric version of the PXP model and show that it gives rise to
ergodicity-breaking eigenstates, the non-Hermitian analogs of quantum many-body
scars. A distinguishing feature of these non-Hermitian scars is their enhanced
robustness against external disorders. We propose an experimental realization
of the non-Hermitian scar enhancement in a tilted Bose-Hubbard optical lattice
with laser-induced loss. Our results show that the Fock skin effect provides a
powerful tool for creating robust non-ergodic states in generic open quantum
systems.

<h3>Tunable quantum criticality and pseudocriticality across the fixed-point  annihilation in the anisotropic spin-boson model</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02400" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02400</a>
<br>
</p><i>Manuel Weber</i>
<p>Spin-boson models are simple examples of quantum dissipative systems, but
also serve as effective models in quantum magnetism and exhibit nontrivial
quantum criticality. Recently, they have been established as a platform to
study the nontrivial renormalization-group (RG) scenario of fixed-point
annihilation, in which two intermediate-coupling RG fixed points collide and
generate an extremely slow RG flow near the collision. For the Bose Kondo
model, a single $S=1/2$ spin where each spin component couples to an
independent bosonic bath with power-law spectrum $\propto \omega^s$ via
dissipation strengths $\alpha_i$, $i\in\{x,y,z\}$, such phenomena occur
sequentially for the U(1)-symmetric model at $\alpha_z=0$ and the
SU(2)-symmetric case at $\alpha_z = \alpha_{xy}$, as the bath exponent $s<1$ is
tuned. Here we use an exact wormhole quantum Monte Carlo method to show how
fixed-point annihilations within symmetry-enhanced parameter manifolds affect
the anisotropy-driven criticality across them. We find a tunable transition
between two long-range-ordered localized phases that can be continuous or
strongly first-order, and even becomes weakly first-order in an extended regime
close to the fixed-point collision. We extract critical exponents at the
continuous transition, but also find scaling behavior at the symmetry-enhanced
first-order transition, for which the inverse correlation-length exponent is
given by the bath exponent $s$. In particular, we provide direct numerical
evidence for pseudocritical scaling on both sides of the fixed-point collision,
which manifests in an extremely slow drift of the correlation-length exponent.
In addition, we also study the crossover behavior away from the SU(2)-symmetric
case and determine the phase boundary of an extended U(1)-symmetric critical
phase for $\alpha_z < \alpha_{xy}$.

<h3>Percolation of nonequilibrium assemblies of colloidal particles in  active chiral liquids</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02423" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02423</a>
<br>
</p><i>Pragya Kushwaha, Sayan Maity, Anjaly S. Menon, Raghunath Chelakkot, Vijayakumar Chikkadi</i>
<p>The growing interest in the non-equilibrium assembly of colloidal particles
in active liquids is driven by the motivation to create novel structures
endowed with tunable properties unattainable within the confines of equilibrium
systems. Here, we present an experimental investigation of the structural
features of colloidal assemblies in active liquids of chiral E. coli. The
colloidal particles form dynamic clusters due to the effective interaction
mediated by active media. The activity and chirality of the swimmers strongly
influence the dynamics and local ordering of colloidal particles, resulting in
clusters with persistent rotation, whose structure differs significantly from
those in equilibrium systems with attractive interactions, such as
colloid-polymer mixtures. The colloid-bacteria mixture displays several
hallmark features of a percolation transition at a critical density, where the
clusters span the system size. However, a closer examination of the critical
exponents associated with cluster size distribution, average cluster size, and
correlation length in the vicinity of the critical density suggest strong
deviations from the prediction of the standard continuum percolation model.
Therefore, our experiments reveal a richer phase behavior of colloidal
assemblies in active liquids.

<h3>Charge and spin fluctuations in superconductors with intersublattice and  interorbital interactions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02453" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02453</a>
<br>
</p><i>Lauro B. Braz, George B. Martins, Luis G. G. V. Dias da Silva</i>
<p>Multiband superconductors have featured one of the main challenges to achieve
a comprehensive understanding of unconventional superconductivity. Here, the
multiband character is studied separately as orbital and sublattice degrees of
freedom, as they have different effects for the superconducting and magnetic or
charge orders. We build on the framework of the matrix random-phase
approximation (RPA), which accounts for the RPA Feynman diagrams and also
vertex corrections, to treat the electron-electron interactions in an off-site
degenerate Hubbard model. As a result, systems without a sublattice degree of
freedom tend to be dominated by spin fluctuations, while systems with multiple
sublattice sites and orbitals have the charge fluctuations favored. Finally, we
explicitly demonstrate that the known suppression of the superconducting
pairing strength $\lambda$ by spin fluctuations from repulsive interactions at
zero momentum transfer $\boldsymbol{q}$ is countered by the
finite-$\boldsymbol{q}$ pairing, which always improves $\lambda$.

<h3>Tuning charge density wave of kagome metal ScV6Sn6</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02463" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02463</a>
<br>
</p><i>Changjiang Yi, Xiaolong Feng, Nitesh Kumar, Claudia Felser, Chandra Shekhar</i>
<p>Compounds with a kagome lattice exhibit intriguing properties and the charge
density wave (CDW) adds an additional layer of interest to research on them. In
this study, we investigate the temperature and magnetic field dependent
electrical properties under a chemical substitution and hydrostatic pressure of
ScV6Sn6, a non-magnetic charge density wave (CDW) compound. Substituting 5 % Cr
at the V site or applying 1.5 GPa of pressure shifts the CDW to 50 K from 92 K.
This shift is attributed to the movement of the imaginary phonon band, as
revealed by the phonon dispersion relation. The longitudinal and Hall
resistivities respond differently under these stimuli. The magnetoresistance
(MR) maintains its quasilinear behavior under pressure, but it becomes
quadratic after Cr substitution. The anomalous Hall-like behavior of the parent
compound persists up to the respective CDW transition under pressure, after
which it sharply declines. In contrast, the longitudinal and Hall resistivities
of Cr substituted compounds follow a two-band model and originates from the
multi carrier effect. These results clearly highlight the role of phonon
contributions in the CDW transition and call for further investigation into the
origin of the anomalous Hall-like behavior in the parent compound.

<h3>Characterizing Dynamic Majorana Hybridization for Universal Quantum  Computing</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02481" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02481</a>
<br>
</p><i>Themba Hodge, Eric Mascot, Dan Crawford, Stephan Rachel</i>
<p>Qubits built out of Majorana zero modes have long been theorized as a
potential pathway toward fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Almost
unavoidable in these processes is Majorana wavefunction overlap, known as
hybridization, which arise throughout the process when Majorana modes get close
to each other. This breaks the ground state degeneracy, leading to qubit errors
in the braiding process. This work presents an accessible method to track
transitions within the low-energy subspace and predict the output of braids
with hybridized Majorana modes. As an application, we characterize Pauli
qubit-errors, as demonstrated on an X-gate, critical for the successful
operation of any quantum computer. Further, we perform numerical simulations to
demonstrate how to utilize the hybridization to implement arbitrary rotations,
along with a two-qubit controlled magic gate, thus providing a demonstration of
universal quantum computing.

<h3>Absorbing-state transitions in particulate systems under spatially  varying driving</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02487" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02487</a>
<br>
</p><i>Bhanu Prasad Bhowmik, Christopher Ness</i>
<p>We study the absorbing state transition in particulate systems under
spatially inhomogeneous driving using a modified random organization model. For
smoothly varying driving the steady state results map onto the homogeneous
absorbing state phase diagram, with the position of the boundary between
absorbing and diffusive states being insensitive to the driving wavelength.
Here the phenomenology is well-described by a one-dimensional continuum model
that we pose. For discontinuously varying driving the position of the absorbing
phase boundary and the exponent characterising the fraction of active particles
are altered relative to the homogeneous case.

<h3>Direct visualization of defect-controlled diffusion in van der Waals  gaps</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02494" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02494</a>
<br>
</p><i>Joachim Dahl Thomsen, Yaxian Wang, Henrik Flyvbjerg, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Prineha Narang, Frances M. Ross</i>
<p>Diffusion processes govern fundamental phenomena such as phase
transformations, doping, and intercalation in van der Waals (vdW) bonded
materials. Here, we quantify the diffusion dynamics of W atoms by visualizing
the motion of individual atoms at three different vdW interfaces, BN/vacuum,
BN/BN, and BN/WSe2, using scanning transmission electron microscopy movies.
Supported by density functional theory calculations, we infer that in all cases
diffusion is governed by intermittent trapping at electron beam-generated
defect sites. This leads to diffusion properties that depend strongly on the
number of defects. These results suggest that diffusion and intercalation
processes in vdW materials are highly tunable and sensitive to crystal quality.
Furthermore, the demonstration of atomic resolution imaging of materials inside
vdW heterostructures offers possibilities for direct visualization of diffusion
and atomic interactions, as well as for experiments exploring atomic
structures, their in-situ modification, and electrical property measurement.

<h3>On the onset of slip at adhesive elastic interfaces</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02510" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02510</a>
<br>
</p><i>Vineet Dawara, Koushik Viswanathan</i>
<p>The transition from static to dynamic friction when an elastic body is slid
over another is now known to result from the motion of interface rupture
fronts. These fronts may be either crack-like or pulse-like, with the latter
involving reattachment in the wake of the front. How and why these fronts occur
remains a subject of active theoretical and experimental investigation, given
its wide ranging implications for a range of problems in tribology. In this
work, we investigate this question using an elastic lattice-network
representation; bulk and interface bonds are simulated to deform and, in the
latter case, break and reform dynamically in response to an applied remote
displacement. We find that, contrary to the oft-cited rigid body scenario with
Coulomb-type friction laws, the type of rupture front observed depends
intimately on the location of the applied boundary condition. Depending on
whether the sliding solid is pulled, pushed or sheared -- all equivalent
applications in the rigid case -- distinct interface rupture modes can occur.
We quantify these rupture modes, evaluate the interface stresses that lead to
their formation, and and study their subsequent propagation dynamics. A strong
analogy between the sliding friction problem and mode II fracture emerges from
our results, with attendant wave speeds ranging from slow to Rayleigh. We
discuss how these fronts mediate interface motion and implications for the
general transition mechanism from static to dynamic friction.

<h3>Structural origin of relaxation in dense colloidal suspensions</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Ratimanasee Sahu, Mohit Sharma, Peter Schall, Sarika Maitra Bhattacharyya, Vijayakumar Chikkadi</i>
<p>Amorphous solids relax via slow molecular rearrangement induced by thermal
fluctuations or applied stress. Although microscopic structural signatures
predicting these structural relaxations have long been sought, a physically
motivated structural measure relevant to diverse systems remains elusive. Here,
we introduce a structural order parameter derived from the mean-field caging
potential experienced by the particles due to their neighbors, which reliably
predicts the occurrence of structural relaxations. The parameter, derived from
density functional theory, is a measure of susceptibility to particle
rearrangements that can effectively identify weak or defect-like regions in
disordered systems. Using experiments on dense colloidal suspensions, we
demonstrate a causal relationship between this order parameter and the
structural relaxations of the amorphous solid. In quiescent suspensions,
increasing the density leads to stronger correlations between the structure and
dynamics. Under applied shear, the mean structural order parameter increases
with increasing strain, signaling shear-induced softening, which is accompanied
by the proliferation of plastic events. In both cases, the order parameter
reliably identifies weak regions where the plastic rearrangements due to
thermal fluctuation or applied shear preferentially occur. Our study paves the
way to a structural understanding of the relaxation of a wide range of
amorphous solids, from suspensions to metallic glasses.

<h3>Layered-to-Spinel Phase Transformation in Li$_{0.5}$NiO$_2$ from First  Principles</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Cem Komurcuoglu, Alan C. West, Alexander Urban</i>
<p>The phase transition layered Li$_{0.5}$NiO$_2$ to spinel Li(NiO$_2$)$_2$ is a
potential degradation pathway in LiNiO$_2$-based lithium-ion battery cathodes.
We investigated the mechanism of this phase transformation from first
principles. Consistent with experimental observations reported in the
literature, our results indicate a high energy barrier for the transformation
due to high defect-formation energies, a complex charge-transfer mechanism, and
electronic frustration. Our results suggest that partially inverse spinel
phases are unlikely to form for Li$_{0.5}$NiO$_2$, a qualitative difference
from the chemically similar Li$_{0.5}$MnO$_2$, in which the transformation
occurs at room temperature. We show that Ni and Li atoms migrate concertedly
towards their respective spinel sites for the layered-to-spinel transformation
to occur. We investigated the charge ordering in layered phases along the
LiNiO$_2$-NiO$_2$ composition line, finding a pronounced impact of the symmetry
and space group on the layered-to-spinel transition in Li$_{0.5}$NiO$_2$.
Finally, we evaluated the relative stability of different spinel space groups,
finding that previously reported experimental observations are consistent with
a temperature-averaged structure rather than the 0 Kelvin ground-state
structure of Li(NiO$_2$)$_2$ spinel.

<p>Quantum critical phase boundaries (QCPBs) -- where a continuous phase
transition occurs at zero temperature -- have been found to nucleate novel
electronic states in a number of strongly correlated materials. Emergent
electronic phases, such as unconventional superconductivity, frequently occur
in close proximity to a QCPB. However, the antagonism between magnetic field
and superconductivity generally suppresses such superconductive phases to
modest magnetic field ranges, except in notable cases such as the
high-$T_\text{c}$ cuprates. Here we show that the heavy fermion Kondo-lattice
system UTe$_2$ possesses a QCPB at remarkably high magnetic fields $\sim$ 50 T,
underpinning an extremely high field superconducting state that persists to
fields $> \sim$ 70 T despite its relatively modest transition temperature of
$T_\text{c} \approx$ 2 K. Whereas previous studies found this superconducting
state to exist exclusively inside a field-polarised paramagnetic host-phase
accessed following a first-order metamagnetic transition, for magnetic field
tilt angles in the rotation plane connecting the reciprocal (010) and (101)
vectors, we find an extended region of this superconductivity outside the
field-polarised state. In this special rotation plane we also observe a
pronounced suppression of the metamagnetic transition towards zero temperature,
revealing that the metamagnetic transition surface ends at a QCPB. The
superconducting $T_\text{c}$ exhibits a strong angular dependence and is
enhanced close to the QCPB, where the onset of superconductivity is stretched
over a surprisingly large magnetic field range reaching as low as 30 T. We
model our data by a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory, and show how an
extended quantum critical line -- rather than a more conventional QCPB at a
singular point -- anchors the remarkable high magnetic field phase landscape of
UTe$_2$.

<p>Statistical mechanics has made significant contributions to the study of
biological neural systems by modeling them as recurrent networks of
interconnected units with adjustable interactions. Several algorithms have been
proposed to optimize the neural connections to enable network tasks such as
information storage (i.e. associative memory) and learning probability
distributions from data (i.e. generative modeling). Among these methods, the
Unlearning algorithm, aligned with emerging theories of synaptic plasticity,
was introduced by John Hopfield and collaborators. The primary objective of
this thesis is to understand the effectiveness of Unlearning in both
associative memory models and generative models. Initially, we demonstrate that
the Unlearning algorithm can be simplified to a linear perceptron model which
learns from noisy examples featuring specific internal correlations. The
selection of structured training data enables an associative memory model to
retrieve concepts as attractors of a neural dynamics with considerable basins
of attraction. Subsequently, a novel regularization technique for Boltzmann
Machines is presented, proving to outperform previously developed methods in
learning hidden probability distributions from data-sets. The Unlearning rule
is derived from this new regularized algorithm and is showed to be comparable,
in terms of inferential performance, to traditional Boltzmann-Machine learning.

<h3>Enhancing Magnetocaloric Material Discovery: A Machine Learning Approach  Using an Autogenerated Database by Large Language Models</h3>

</p><i>Jiaoyue Yuan, Runqing Yang, Lokanath Patra, Bolin Liao</i>
<p>Magnetic cooling based on the magnetocaloric effect is a promising
solid-state refrigeration technology for a wide range of applications in
different temperature ranges. Previous studies have mostly focused on near room
temperature (300 K) and cryogenic temperature (< 10 K) ranges, while important
applications such as hydrogen liquefaction call for efficient magnetic
refrigerants for the intermediate temperature 10K to 100 K. For efficient use
in this range, new magnetocaloric materials with matching Curie temperatures
need to be discovered, while conventional experimental approaches are typically
time-consuming and expensive. Here, we report a computational material
discovery pipeline based on a materials database containing more than 6000
entries auto-generated by extracting reported material properties from
literature using a large language model. We then use this database to train a
machine learning model that can efficiently predict magnetocaloric properties
of materials based on their chemical composition. We further verify the
magnetocaloric properties of predicted compounds using ab initio atomistic spin
dynamics simulations to close the loop for computational material discovery.
Using this approach, we identify 11 new promising magnetocaloric materials for
the target temperature range. Our work demonstrates the potential of combining
large language models, machine learning, and ab initio simulations to
efficiently discover new functional materials.

<p>EuCd_{2}As_{2} has attracted considerable interest as one of the few magnetic
Weyl semimetal candidate materials, although recently there have been emerging
reports that claim it to have a semiconducting electronic structure. To resolve
this debate, we established the growth of n-type EuCd_{2}As_{2} crystals, to
directly visualize the nature of the conduction band using angle resolve
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We show that La-doping leads to n-type
transport signatures in both the thermopower and Hall effect measurements, in
crystals with doping levels at 2 - 6 x 10^{17} e^{-} cm^{-3}. Both p-type and
n-type doped samples exhibit antiferromagnetic ordering at 9 K. ARPES
experiments at 6 K clearly show the presence of the conduction band minimum at
0.8 eV above the valence band maximum, which is further corroborated by the
observation of a 0.71 - 0.72 eV band gap in room temperature diffuse
reflectance absorbance measurements. Together these findings unambiguously show
that EuCd_{2}As_{2} is indeed a semiconductor with a substantial band gap and
not a topological semimetal.

<h3>Dynamics of magnetic self-propelled particles in a harmonic trap</h3>

</p><i>Pamela Muñoz Obreque, Oscar Garrido, Diego Romero, Hartmut Löwen, Francisca Guzmán-Lastra</i>
<p>Artificial active particles, exemplified by Hexbugs (HB), serve as valuable
tools for investigating the intricate dynamics of active matter systems.
Leveraging their stochastic motion, Hexbugs provides an excellent experimental
model. In this study, we utilize Hexbugs equipped with disk-like armor and
embedded magnetic dipoles, transforming them into Magnetic Self-Propelled
Particles (MSPP). We explore the emergence of collective and stationary states
numerically and experimentally by confining these MSPPs within a parabolic
domain acting as a harmonic potential. Our findings unveil a diverse range of
metastable configurations intricately linked to the complex dynamics inherent
in the system. We discern that particle number, activity, and the balance
between magnetic and harmonic potential strengths predominantly influence the
metastability of these structures. By employing these parameters as control
factors, we compare and contrast the behavior of MSPPs with disk-like magnetic
Active Brownian Particles (ABPs) in the overdamped limit of vanishing inertia.
Our numerical predictions reproduce most of the experimental observations,
highlighting the crucial role of magnetic dipole interactions in developing
novel configurations for active particles within parabolic domains. These
configurations include chains, clusters, and vortex formations characterized by
a specific pattern in the particle spatial distribution. Notably, we observe
that the influence of inertia is not fundamental in generating metastable
configurations in these confined systems. Instead, the particle's shape,
activity, and orientation are dominant factors. This comparative analysis
provides insights into the distinctive features and dynamics of MSPP within

<p>Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become essential tools for
accelerating accurate large-scale atomistic simulations and crystal structure
predictions. The polynomial MLPs, which are described by polynomial rotational
invariants, have been systematically developed for many elemental and alloy
systems. This study presents an efficient procedure for enumerating global
minimum and metastable structures using robust polynomial MLPs. To develop MLPs
that can handle the structure enumeration, performing random structure searches
and updating MLPs are iteratively repeated. The current procedure is
systematically applied to the elemental systems of As, Bi, Ga, In, La, P, Sb,
Sn, and Te, with many local minimum structures competing with the global
minimum structure in terms of energy. This procedure will significantly
accelerate global structure searches and expand their search space.

<h3>Topological protection revealed by real-time longitudinal and transverse  studies</h3>

</p><i>Anh Ho Hoai, Jian Huang, L. N. Pfeiffer, K. W. West</i>
<p>Topology provides an essential concept for achieving unchanged (or protected)
quantum properties in the presence of perturbations. A challenge facing
realistic applications is that the level of protection displayed in real
systems is subject to substantial variations. Some key differences stem from
mechanisms influencing the reconstruction behaviors of extended dissipationless
modes. Despite various insightful results on potential causes of
backscattering, the edge-state-based approach is limited because the bulk
states, as shown by breakdown tests, contribute indispensably. This study
investigates the influence of bulk reconstruction where dissipationless modes
are global objects instead of being restricted to the sample edge. An integer
quantum Hall effect (IQHE) hosted in a Corbino sample geometry is adopted and
brought continuously to the verge of a breakdown. A detection technique is
developed to include two independent setups capable of simultaneously capturing
the onset of dissipation in both longitudinal and transverse directions. The
real-time correspondence between orthogonal results confirms two facts. 1.
Dissipationless charge modes undergo frequent reconstruction in response to
electrochemical potential changes, causing dissipationless current paths to
expand transversely into the bulk while preserving chirality. A breakdown only
occurs when a backscattering emerges between reconfigured dissipationless
current paths bridging opposite edge contacts. 2. Impurity screening is vital
in enhancing protection, and topological protection is subject to an intriguing
interplay of disorder, electron-electron interaction, and topology. The
proposed reconstruction mechanism qualitatively explains the robustness
variations, beneficial for developing means for optimization.

<p>Kagome system usually attracts great interest in condensed matter physics due
to its unique structure hosting various exotic states such as superconductivity
(SC), charge density wave (CDW), and nontrivial topological states. Topological
semimetal RbTi3Bi5 consisting of the kagome layer of Ti shares a similar
crystal structure to topological correlated materials AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs)
but with the absence of CDW and SC. Systematic de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA)
oscillation measurements are performed on the single crystals of RbTi3Bi5 to
pursue nontrivial topological physics and exotic states. Combining with
theoretical calculations, detailed Fermi surface topology and band structure
are investigated. A two-dimensional (2D) Fermi pocket \b{eta} is revealed with
a light-effective mass in consistent with the semimetal predictions. Landau Fan
of RbTi3Bi5 reveals a zero Berry phase for the \b{eta} oscillation in contrast
to that of CsTi3Bi5. These results suggest the kagome RbTi3Bi5 is a good
candidate to explore nontrivial topological exotic states and topological
correlated physics.

<h3>Geometric Dynamics of Signal Propagation Predict Trainability of  Transformers</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02579" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02579</a>
<br>
</p><i>Aditya Cowsik, Tamra Nebabu, Xiao-Liang Qi, Surya Ganguli</i>
<p>We investigate forward signal propagation and gradient back propagation in
deep, randomly initialized transformers, yielding simple necessary and
sufficient conditions on initialization hyperparameters that ensure
trainability of deep transformers. Our approach treats the evolution of the
representations of $n$ tokens as they propagate through the transformer layers
in terms of a discrete time dynamical system of $n$ interacting particles. We
derive simple update equations for the evolving geometry of this particle
system, starting from a permutation symmetric simplex. Our update equations
show that without MLP layers, this system will collapse to a line, consistent
with prior work on rank collapse in transformers. However, unlike prior work,
our evolution equations can quantitatively track particle geometry in the
additional presence of nonlinear MLP layers, and it reveals an order-chaos
phase transition as a function of initialization hyperparameters, like the
strength of attentional and MLP residual connections and weight variances. In
the ordered phase the particles are attractive and collapse to a line, while in
the chaotic phase the particles are repulsive and converge to a regular
$n$-simplex. We analytically derive two Lyapunov exponents: an angle exponent
that governs departures from the edge of chaos in this particle system, and a
gradient exponent that governs the rate of exponential growth or decay of
backpropagated gradients. We show through experiments that, remarkably, the
final test loss at the end of training is well predicted just by these two
exponents at the beginning of training, and that the simultaneous vanishing of
these two exponents yields a simple necessary and sufficient condition to
achieve minimal test loss.

<h3>Periodic Cylindrical Bilayers Self-Assembled from Diblock Polymers</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02588" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02588</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yongshun Luo, Min Yang, Sirui Li, Yana Di, Yongqiang Cai</i>
<p>Amphiphilic polymers in aqueous solutions can self-assemble to form bilayer
membranes, and their elastic properties can be captured by the well-known
Helfrich model involving several elastic constants. In this paper, we employ
the self-consistent field model to simulate sinusoidal bilayers self-assembled
from diblock copolymers where a proper constraint term is introduced to
stabilize periodic bilayers with prescribed amplitudes. Then, we devise several
methods to extract the shape of these bilayers and examine the accuracy of the
free energy predicted by the Helfrich model. Numerical results show that when
the bilayer curvature is small, the Helfrich model predicts the excess free
energy more accurately. However, when the curvature is large, the accuracy
heavily depends on the method used to determine the shape of the bilayer. In
addition, the dependence of free energy on interaction strength, constraint
amplitude, and constraint period are systematically studied. Moreover, we
obtain certain periodic cylindrical bilayers that are equilibrium states of the
self-consistent field model, which agree with the theoretical predictions made
by the shape equations.

<h3>Novel Dipole-Lattice coupling in the Quantum-Spin-Liquid Material  $κ$-Cu-CN</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Jesse Liebman, Kazuya Miyagawa, Kazushi Kanoda, Natalia Drichko</i>
<p>A family of molecular Mott insulators on triangular lattice provided a few
S=1/2 triangular quantum spin liquid candidates, with
$\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ being the most studied material of this
group. The large number experimental work presented a conflicting set of
evidence, some suggesting spin liquid behavior, while other pointing on
deceased magnetization reminding of a valence bond solid with orphan spins. In
this work we use Raman scattering spectroscopy to probe both local charge on
molecular sites and lattice phonons as a function of temperature down to 6K.
Based on the analysis of the increasing width of Gaussian line shape of the
BEDT-TTF charge sensitive vibration $\nu_2$ on colling below 40 K we suggest a
development of disordered fluctuating charge disproportionation on
(BEDT-TTF)$_2$ dimers of amplitude as small as 0.06$e$. The lattice phonons
show strong anomalous broadening on cooling only in (c,c) scattering channel,
associated with the developing charge disproportionation. We suggest an
interpretation, where the coupling of disordered charge dipoles on dimers to
the lattice results in anisotropic modulation of charge transfer integrals
between dimer lattice sites. Such fluctuation would results in fluctuations of
magnetic coupling between spins which can produce short lived charge ordered
spin-singlet pairs.

<p>Quantum phases of matter such as superconducting, ferromagnetic and Wigner
crystal states are often driven by the two-dimensionality (2D) of correlated
systems. Meanwhile, spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is a fundamental element leading
to nontrivial topology which gives rise to quantum phenomena such as the large
anomalous Hall effect and nontrivial superconductivity. However, the search for
controllable platforms with both 2D and SOC has been relatively overlooked so
far. Here, we control and study the electronic ground states of iridate
ultrathin films having both 2D and SOC by angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) calculations. The
metallicity of SrIrO$_3$ ultrathin films is controlled down to a monolayer by
dimensional and strain manipulation. Our results suggest that the iridate
ultrathin films can be a controllable 2D SOC platform exhibiting a variety of
phenomena for future functional devices.

<h3>Emergence of biconnected clusters in explosive percolation</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02789" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02789</a>
<br>
</p><i>Liwenying Yang, Ming Li</i>
<p>By introducing a simple competition mechanism for the insertion of bonds in
random graphs, the explosive percolation demonstrates a sharped phase
transition with rich critical phenomena. In this paper, we study the high-order
connectivity in the explosive percolation by the event-based ensemble, focusing
on the biconnected cluster, in which any two sites are connected by at least
two independent paths. Although the biconnected clusters are formed only by
inserting intra-cluster bonds, we numerically confirm that the percolation
threshold of the biconnected cluster is independent of a special competition
mechanism for the intra-cluster bond, instead, it shares the same value with
the percolation of simply connected clusters. Moreover, it is very interesting
that the volume fractal dimension of the biconnected clusters $d_{f}'$ varies
when different competition mechanisms are applied to intra-cluster bonds. The
fit results suggest that $d_{f}'$ is much smaller than the volume fractal
dimension of the connected cluster $d_{f}$, indicating a non-explosive
transition of the biconnected cluster. The size distribution of biconnected
clusters shows a double-scaling behavior -- the size distribution of large
clusters is still governed by the standard Fisher exponent derived from the
hyperscaling relation $\tau'=1+1/d_{f}'$, while a modified Fisher exponent
$\tau_0\leq1$ is found for small clusters. The value of $\tau_0$, and the
crossover of the two scalings depends on the competition mechanism of
intra-cluster bonds. All these demonstrate that the high-order connectivity
also shows some unusual features by simply suppressing the growth of clusters
in the percolation model.

<h3>Nonlinear Thouless Pumping of Solitons Across an Impurity</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02800" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02800</a>
<br>
</p><i>Xunzhen Cao, Chunyu Jia, Ying Hu, Zhaoxin Liang</i>
<p>The nonlinear Thouless pumping is an exciting frontier of topological
physics. While recent works have revealed the quantized motion of solitons in
Thouless pumps, the interplay between the topology, nonlinearity and disorder
remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the nonlinear Thouless pumping
of solitons in the presence of an impurity in the context of a Bose-Einstein
condensate. Using both the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and Lagrangian variational
approach, we analyze the interaction between a moving soliton and an impurity.
Without the pump, the soliton can pass through a light impurity, but gets
trapped by the impurity with large mass. In marked contrast, we find the
soliton in Thouless pumps can always transit through the impurity, and its
motion is topologically quantized. Our result explicitly showcases the
robustness of topological soliton pumping against microscopic imperfections,
and opens a new perspective in the information processing with solitons.

<h3>Unraveling spin texture and spin-orbit coupling contributions in spin  triplet superconductivity</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02819" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02819</a>
<br>
</p><i>Pablo Tuero, César González-Ruano, Yuan Lu, Coriolan Tiusan, Farkhad G. Aliev</i>
<p>Over the past decade, it has been proposed theoretically and confirmed
experimentally that long-range spin triplet (LRT) superconductivity can be
generated in ferromagnet-superconductor hybrids either by the presence of spin
textures (ST-LRT) or thanks to spin-orbit coupling (SOC-LRT). Nevertheless,
there has been no theoretical or experimental investigation to date suggesting
that both contributions could simultaneously exist within an experimental
system. To disentangle these contributions, we present a comprehensive study of
superconducting quasiparticle interference effects taking place inside a
ferromagnetic layer interfacing a superconductor, through the investigation of
above-gap conductance anomalies (CAs) related to MacMillan-Rowell resonances.
The bias dependence of the CAs has been studied under a wide range of in-plane
(IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) magnetic fields in two types of epitaxial,
V/MgO/Fe-based ferromagnet-superconductor junctions with interfacial spin-orbit
coupling. We observe an anisotropy of the CAs amplitude under small IP and OOP
magnetic fields while remaining weakly affected by high fields, and implement
micromagnetic simulations to help us distinguish between the ST-LRT and SOC-LRT
contributions. Our findings suggest that further exploration of Fabry-P\'erot
type interference effects in electron transport could yield valuable insights
into the hybridization between superconductors and ferromagnets induced by
spin-orbit coupling and spin textures.

<h3>Numerical studies of triangulated vesicles with anisotropic membrane  inclusions</h3>

<p>In this study, we implement the deviatoric curvature model to examine
dynamically triangulated surfaces with anisotropic membrane inclusions. The
Monte-Carlo numerical scheme is devised to not only minimize the total bending
energy of the membrane but also the in-plane nematic order of the inclusions by
considering the mismatch between the curvature of the membrane and the
intrinsic curvature of the inclusion. Neighboring inclusions can either attract
with nearest-neighbor interaction or with a nematic interaction derived from
liquid crystal theory. Orientational order determines whether vesicles fully
covered with inclusions result in bulbs connected by necks or long tubes.
Remarkably, when inclusions on vesicles with no vacancies interact
non-nematically, a spontaneous local order can lead to a bulb transition which
may have implications in cell or organelle division. Furthermore we find that
average nematic order is inversely proportional to the number of thin necks
formed in the vesicles. Our method shows good convergence and is suitable for
further upgrades, for example to vesicles constrained by volume.

<p>Self-propelled particles that are subject to noise are a well-established
generic model system for active matter. A homogeneous alignment field can be
used to orient the direction of the self-propulsion velocity and to model
systems like phoretic Janus particles with a magnetic dipole moment or
magnetotactic bacteria in an external magnetic field. Computer simulations are
used to predict the phase behavior and dynamics of self-propelled Brownian
particles in a homogeneous alignment field in two dimensions. Phase boundaries
of the gas-liquid coexistence region are calculated for various P\'eclet
numbers, particle densities, and alignment field strengths. Critical points and
exponents are calculated and, in agreement with previous simulations, do not
seem to belong to the universality class of the 2D Ising model. Finally, the
dynamics of spinodal decomposition for quenching the system from the one-phase
to the two-phase coexistence region by increasing P\'eclet number is
characterized. Our results may help to identify parameters for optimal
transport of active matter in complex environments.

<p>L\'evy noise is a paradigmatic noise used to describe out-of-equilibrium
systems. Typically, properties of L\'evy noise driven systems are very
different from their Gaussian white noise driven counterparts. In particular,
under action of L\'evy noise, stationary states in single-well, super-harmonic,
potentials are no longer unimodal. Typically, they are bimodal however for
fine-tuned potentials the number of modes can be further increased. The
multimodality arises as a consequence of the competition between long
displacements induced by the non-equilibrium stochastic driving and action of
the deterministic force. Here, we explore robustness of bimodality in the
quartic potential under action of the L\'evy noise. We explore various
scenarios of bounding long jumps and assess their ability to weaken and
disassembly multimodality. In general, we demonstrate that despite its
robustness it is possible to destroy the bimodality by limiting the length of
noise-induced jumps.

<p>Nanolayered post-transition metal monochalcogenides (PTMMCs) stand out as
promising advanced two-dimensional (2D) materials. Beyond inheriting the
general advantages associated with traditional 2D materials, they exhibit
unique properties, including a wide bandgap range covering the ultraviolet to
the mid-infrared spectral ranges, thickness-dependent bandgap behaviors, good
nonlinear optical performance, high thermoelectric coefficients, and
ferroelectricity. Consequently, these materials hold significant potential in
diverse applications such as photodetectors, field effect transistors,
thermoelectrics, ferroelectrics, photovoltaics, and electrochemical devices,
especially in the manufacturing of nanoscale devices. However, there is still a
lack of systematic understanding of the PTMMC family. This study provides a
broad overview of the crystal structures, bandgap structures, synthesis
methods, physical properties, and state-of-the-art applications of PTMMC
materials with a motif of X-M-M-X (M=Ga, In, Ge, Sn; X=S, Se, Te). An outlook
for the development trends is emphasized at the end, underscoring the critical

</p><i>Yunuo Xiong, Hongwei Xiong</i>
<p>Chang and Bertsch [Phys. Rev. A 76, 021603(R) (2007)] proposed a simple
formula for the ground state energy of a unitary Fermi gas in a harmonic trap,
based on their Green's function Monte Carlo simulations of up to 22 fermions,
combined with general assumptions about the universal thermodynamic behavior of
the unitary Fermi gas. In this work, we perform the ab initio simulations of
the ground state energy of up to one hundred fermions using the fictitious
identical particle method to overcome the Fermion sign problem, and we find
that the formula proposed by Chang and Bertsch remains highly accurate. Since
the number of fermions we simulate is much larger than that simulated by Chang
and Bertsch when they proposed the formula, our work provides strong evidence
for the universal validity of the formula. Our work demonstrates that
fictitious identical particles provide a valuable tool for the ab initio
simulations of ultracold Fermi gases.

<p>Zintl phase EuIn$_{2}$As$_{2}$ has garnered growing attention as an axion
insulator candidate, triggered by the identification of a commensurate
double-${\mathbf Q}$ broken-helix state in previous studies, however, its
periodicity and symmetry remain subjects of debate. Here, we perform resonant
x-ray scattering experiments on EuIn$_{2}$As$_{2}$, revealing an incommensurate
nature of the broken-helix state, where both the wave number and the amplitude
of the helical modulation exhibit systematic sample dependence. Furthermore,
the application of an in-plane magnetic field brings about a broken-fanlike
state preserving the double-${\mathbf Q}$ nature, which could be attributed to
multiple-spin interactions in momentum space. We propose that the itinerant
character of EuIn$_{2}$As$_{2}$, possibly induced by Eu deficiency, gives rise
to the helical modulation and impedes the realization of a
theoretically-predicted axion state with the collinear antiferromagnetic order.

<p>Recent experiments on 2D superconductors allow the characterization of the
critical temperature and of the phase diagram across the BCS-BEC crossover as a
function of density. We obtain from these experiments the microscopic
parameters of the superconducting state at low temperatures by the BCS
mean-field approach. For Li$_x$ZrNCl, the extracted parameters are used to
evaluate the superconducting phase stiffness and the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) critical temperature throughout the
BCS-BEC crossover, by implementing the corresponding Renormalization Group (RG)
approach. In this way, we make a quantitative test of the predictive power of
the BKT theory for evaluating the critical temperature. The RG flow equations
turn out to give a sizable renormalization of the phase stiffness and of the
critical temperature, which is crucial to obtain a satisfactory agreement
between the BKT theory and the experiments, in particular in the BCS-BEC
crossover regime. We predict the temperature range where phase stiffness
renormalization can be measured in Li$_x$ZrNCl across the BCS-BEC crossover.
Contrary to other microscopic theories of superconductivity, we find that the
BKT theory can be exploited to evaluate quantitatively the critical temperature
of 2D superconductors in different pairing regimes.

coupling of interlayer flower-like \Gamma-centered Fermi surface formed by the
hybridization of Ca-3d and Si-3pz orbitals with low-energy out-of-plane

<p>Recent studies on topological insulators have expanded into the nonlinear
regime, while the bulk-edge correspondence in strongly nonlinear systems has
been unelucidated. Here, we reveal that nonlinear topological edge modes can
exhibit a transition to spatial chaos by increasing nonlinearity, which can be
a universal mechanism of the breakdown of the bulk-edge correspondence.
Specifically, we unveil the underlying dynamical system describing the spatial
distribution of zero modes and show the emergence of chaos. We also propose the
correspondence between the absolute value of the topological invariant and the
dimension of the stable manifold under sufficiently weak nonlinearity. Our
results provide a general guiding principle to investigate the nonlinear

experimental temperature-dependent viscosity data corresponding to twenty-five
glass-forming liquids and compare the fit parameters with those obtained using
the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT), Avramov-Milchev (AM), and
Mauro-Yue-Ellison-Gupta-Allan (MYEGA) models. The results demonstrate that the
NSM provides an effective fitting equation for modeling viscosity experimental

attention for developing novel orbitronic devices. Here we investigate the
orbital torque efficiency and demonstrate the switching of the perpendicularly
magnetized materials through the orbital Hall material (OHM), i.e., Zirconium
(Zr). The orbital torque efficiency of approximately 0.78 is achieved in the Zr
OHM with the perpendicularly magnetized [Co/Pt]3 sample, which significantly
surpasses that of the perpendicularly magnetized CoFeB/Gd/CoFeB sample
(approximately 0.04). Such notable difference is attributed to the different
spin-orbit correlation strength between the [Co/Pt]3 sample and the
CoFeB/Gd/CoFeB sample, which has been confirmed through the theoretical
calculations. Furthermore, the full magnetization switching of the [Co/Pt]3
sample with a switching current density of approximately 2.6x106 A/cm2 has been
realized through Zr, which even outperforms that of the W spin Hall material.
Our finding provides a guideline to understand orbital torque efficiency and
paves the way to develop energy-efficient orbitronic devices.

<h3>Internal consistency of multi-tier $GW$+EDMFT</h3>

<p>The multi-tier $GW$+EDMFT scheme is an ab-initio method for calculating the
electronic structure of correlated materials. While the approach is free from
ad-hoc parameters, it requires a selection of appropriate energy windows for
describing low-energy and strongly correlated physics. In this study, we test
the consistency of the multi-tier description by considering different
low-energy windows for a series of cubic SrXO$_3$ (X=V,Cr,Mn) perovskites.
Specifically, we compare the 3-orbital $t_{2g}$ model, the 5-orbital
$t_{2g}+e_g$ model, the 12-orbital $t_{2g}+O_p$ model, and (in the case of
SrVO$_3$) the 14-orbital $t_{2g}+e_g+O_p$ model and compare the results to
available photoemission and X-ray absorption measurements. The multi-tier
method yields consistent results for the $t_{2g}$ and $t_{2g}+e_g$ low-energy
windows, while the models with $O_p$ states produce stronger correlation
effects and mostly agree well with experiment, especially in the unoccupied
part of the spectrum.
We also discuss the consistency between the fermionic and bosonic spectral
functions and the physical origin of satellite features, and present
momentum-resolved charge susceptibilities.

<h3>Critical magnetic flux for Weyl points in the three-dimensional  Hofstadter model</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03047" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03047</a>
<br>
</p><i>Pierpaolo Fontana, Andrea Trombettoni</i>
<p>We investigate the band structure of the three-dimensional Hofstadter model
on cubic lattices, with an isotropic magnetic field oriented along the diagonal
of the cube with flux $\Phi=2 \pi \cdot m /n$, where $m,n$ are co-prime
integers. Using reduced exact diagonalization in momentum space, we show that,
at fixed $m$, there exists an integer $n(m)$ associated with a specific value
of the magnetic flux, that we denote by $\Phi_c(m) \equiv 2 \pi \cdot m/n(m)$,
separating two different regimes. The first one, for fluxes $\Phi<\Phi_c(m)$,
is characterized by complete band overlaps, while the second one, for
$\Phi>\Phi_c(m)$, features isolated band touching points in the density of
states and Weyl points between the $m$- and the $(m+1)$-th bands. In the
Hasegawa gauge, the minimum of the $(m+1)$-th band abruptly moves at the
critical flux $\Phi_c(m)$ from $k_z=0$ to $k_z=\pi$. We then argue that the
limit for large $m$ of $\Phi_c(m)$ exists and it is finite: $\lim_{m\to \infty}
\Phi_c(m) \equiv \Phi_c$. Our estimate is $\Phi_c/2\pi=0.1296(1)$. Based on the
values of $n(m)$ determined for integers $m\leq60$, we propose a mathematical
conjecture for the form of $\Phi_c(m)$ to be used in the large-$m$ limit. The
asymptotic critical flux obtained using this conjecture is $\Phi_c^{{\rm
(conj)}}/2\pi=7/54$.

<p>Most of normal proliferative epithelia of plants and metazoans are
topologically invariant and characterized by similar cell distributions
according to the number of cell neighbors (DCNs). Here we study peculiarities
of these distributions and explain why the DCN obtained from the location of
intercellular boundaries and that based on the Voronoi tessellation with nodes
located on cell nuclei may differ from each other. As we demonstrate, special
microdomains where four or more intercellular boundaries converge are
topologically charged. Using this fact, we deduce a new equation describing the
topological balance of the DCNs. The developed theory is applied for a series
of microphotographs of non-tumoral epithelial cells of the human cervix
(HCerEpiC) to improve the image processing near the edges of microphotographs
and reveal the topological invariance of the examined monolayers. Special
contact microdomains may be present in epithelia of various natures, however,
considering the well-known vertex model of epithelium, we show that such
contacts are absent in the usual solid-like state of the model and appear only
in the liquid-like cancer state. Also, we discuss a possible biological role of
special contacts in context of proliferative epithelium dynamics and tissue
morphogenesis.

<h3>Resolving chiral transitions in Rydberg arrays with quantum Kibble-Zurek  mechanism and finite-time scaling</h3>

<p>The experimental realization of the quantum Kibble-Zurek mechanism in arrays
of trapped Rydberg atoms has brought the problem of commensurate-incommensurate
transition back into the focus of active research. Relying on equilibrium
simulations of finite intervals, direct chiral transitions at the boundary of
the period-3 and period-4 phases have been predicted. Here, we study how these
chiral transitions can be diagnosed experimentally with critical dynamics. We
demonstrate that chiral transitions can be distinguished from the floating
phases by comparing Kibble-Zurek dynamics on arrays with different numbers of
atoms. Furthermore, by sweeping in the opposite direction and keeping track of
the order parameter, we identify the location of conformal points. Finally,
combining forward and backward sweeps, we extract all critical exponents
characterizing the transition.

<h3>Magnetothermopower of nodal line semimetals</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Poulomi Chakraborty, Aaron Hui, Grigory Bednik, Brian Skinner</i>
<p>The search for materials with large thermopower is of great practical
interest. Dirac and Weyl semimetals have recently proven to exhibit superior
thermoelectric properties, particularly when subjected to a quantizing magnetic
field. Here we consider whether a similar enhancement arises in nodal line
semimetals, for which the conduction and valence band meet at a line or ring in
momentum space. We compute the Seebeck and Nernst coefficients for arbitrary
temperature and magnetic field and we find a wealth of different scaling
regimes. Most strikingly, when a sufficiently strong magnetic field is applied
along the direction of the nodal line, the large degeneracy of states leads to
a large, linear-in-$B$ thermopower that is temperature-independent even at low
temperatures. Our results suggest that nodal line semimetals may offer
significant opportunity for efficient, low-temperature thermoelectrics.

<p>Conjugated polymer fibers can be used to manufacture various soft fibrous
optoelectronic devices, significantly advancing wearable devices and smart
textiles. Recently, conjugated polymer-based fibrous electronic devices have
been widely used in energy conversion, electrochemical sensing, and
human-machine interaction. However, the insufficient mechanical properties of
conjugated polymer fibers, the difficulty in solution processing semiconductors
with rigid main chains, and the challenges in large-scale continuous production
have limited their further development in the wearable field. We regulated the
pi - pi stacking interactions in conjugated polymer molecules below their
critical liquid crystal concentration by applying fluid shear stress. We
implemented secondary orientation, leading to the continuous fabrication of
anisotropic semiconductor fibers. This strategy enables conjugated polymers
with rigid backbones to synergistically enhance the mechanical and
semiconductor properties of fibers through liquid crystal spinning.
Furthermore, conjugated polymer fibers, exhibiting excellent electrochemical
performance and high mechanical strength (600 MPa) that essentially meet the
requirements for industrialized preparation, maintain stability under extreme
temperatures, radiation, and chemical reagents. Lastly, we have demonstrated
logic circuits using semiconductor fiber organic electrochemical transistors,
showcasing its application potential in the field of wearable fabric-style
logic processing. These findings confirm the importance of the liquid
crystalline state and solution control in optimizing the performance of
conjugated polymer fibers, thus paving the way for developing a new generation
of soft fiber semiconductor devices.

<p>The melting temperature is important for materials design because of its
relationship with thermal stability, synthesis, and processing conditions.
Current empirical and computational melting point estimation techniques are
limited in scope, computational feasibility, or interpretability. We report the
development of a machine learning methodology for predicting melting
temperatures of binary ionic solid materials. We evaluated different
machine-learning models trained on a data set of the melting points of 476
non-metallic crystalline binary compounds, using materials embeddings
constructed from elemental properties and density-functional theory
calculations as model inputs. A direct supervised-learning approach yields a
mean absolute error of around 180~K but suffers from low interpretability. We
find that the fidelity of predictions can further be improved by introducing an
additional unsupervised-learning step that first classifies the materials
before the melting-point regression. Not only does this two-step model exhibit
improved accuracy, but the approach also provides a level of interpretability
with insights into feature importance and different types of melting that
depend on the specific atomic bonding inside a material. Motivated by this
finding, we used a symbolic learning approach to find interpretable physical
models for the melting temperature, which recovered the best-performing
features from both prior models and provided additional interpretability.

<h3>Stretch-independent magnetization in incompressible magnetorheological  elastomers</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03096" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03096</a>
<br>
</p><i>Kostas Danas, Pedro M. Reis</i>
<p>In this study, we perform a critical examination of the phenomenon where the
magnetization is stretch-independent in incompressible hard-magnetic
magnetorheological elastomers (h-MREs), as observed in several recent
experimental and numerical investigations. We demonstrate that the fully
dissipative model proposed by Mukherjee et al. (2021) may be reduced, under
physically consistent assumptions, to that of Yan et al. (2023), but not that
of Zhao et al. (2019). In cases where the h-MRE solid undergoes non-negligible
stretching, the model of Zhao et al. (2019) provides predictions that are in
disagreement with experimental observations, given that, by construction, that
model produces a magnetization response that is not stretch-independent. By
contrast, the other two models are able to describe this important feature
present in h-MREs, as well as in incompressible magnetically soft s-MRES. Note
that in cases where stretching is negligible, such as for inextensible slender
structures under bending deformation, the Zhao et al. (2019) model provides
accurate predictions despite its underlying assumptions. Additionally, our
analysis reveals two key points about the magnetization vector in the context
of the more general, fully dissipative model. First, the magnetization can be
related to an internal variable in that theory. However, it cannot be formally
used as an internal variable except in the special case of an ideal magnet,
and, as such, it is subject to constitutive assumptions. Furthermore, we
clarify that the magnetization vector alone is insufficient to describe
entirely the magnetic response of an MRE solid; instead, the introduction of
one of the original Maxwell fields is always necessary for a complete
representation.

</p><i>Florian Lange, Gerhard Wellein, Holger Fehske</i>
<p>We use infinite matrix-product-state techniques to study the time evolution
of the charge-density-wave (CDW) order after a quench or a light pulse in a
fundamental fermion-boson model. The motion of fermions in the model is linked
to the creation of bosonic excitations, which counteracts the melting of the
CDW order. For low-energy quenches corresponding to a change of the boson
relaxation rate, we find behavior similar to that in an effective $t$-$V$
model. When the boson energy is quenched instead or a light pulse is applied to
the system, the transient dynamics are more complex, with the CDW order first
quickly decreasing to an intermediate value while the density-wave-like order
of the bosons rises. In the case of pulse irradiation, the subsequent
time-evolution of the CDW order depends strongly on the photon frequency. For
frequencies slightly below the boson energy, we observe a temporary increase of
the CDW order parameter. Our results reveal the complex physics of driven Mott
insulators in low-dimensional systems with strong correlations.

</p><i>Jacopo Vialetto, Shivaprakash N. Ramakrishna, Lucio Isa, Marco Laurati</i>
<p>Particle surface chemistry and internal softness are two fundamental
parameters in governing the mechanical properties of dense colloidal
suspensions, dictating structure and flow, therefore of interest from materials
fabrication to processing. Here, we modulate softness by tuning the crosslinker
content of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) microgels, and we adjust their surface
properties by co-polymerization with polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains,
controlling adhesion, friction and fuzziness. We investigate the distinct
effects of these parameters on the entire mechanical response from
restructuring to complete fluidization of jammed samples at varying packing
fractions under large-amplitude oscillatory shear experiments, and we
complement rheological data with colloidal-probe atomic force microscopy to
unravel variations in the particles' surface properties. We find that surface
properties play a fundamental role at smaller packings; decreasing adhesion and
friction at contact causes the samples to yield and fluidify in a lower
deformation range. Instead, increasing softness or fuzziness has a similar
effect at ultra-high densities, making suspensions able to better adapt to the
applied shear and reach complete fluidization over a larger deformation range.
These findings shed new light on the single-particle parameters governing the
mechanical response of dense suspensions subjected to deformation, offering
synthetic approaches to design materials with tailored mechanical properties.

<p>Thin films of co-doped (BiSb)$_2$Te$_3$ (0001) are grown via molecular beam
epitaxy on substrates of Al$_2$O$_3$ (0001), MgF$_2$ (110) and a thin film of
the antiferromagnetic insulator MnF$_2$ (110). Magnetoconductivity measurements
of these (BiSb)$_2$Te$_3$ films show weak antilocalization at low temperature
that is suppressed in (BiSb)$_2$Te$_3$ films grown on a MnF$_2$ layer, an
effect attributed either to enhanced magnetic scattering at the interface or a
proximity induced energy gap at the Dirac point. The (BiSb)$_2$Te$_3$ films are
fit to a model describing the magnetoconductivity corrections in the 2D Dirac
surface state of the topological insulator, from which the approximate value of
the Fermi velocity near the Dirac point is derived. The (BiSb)$_2$Te$_3$ -
MnF$_2$ bilayer samples are fit to a model describing the crossover from weak
antilocalization to weak localization due to magnetic doping, suggesting the
opening of an energy gap at the Dirac point in the (BiSb)$_2$Te$_3$ due to
proximity with the antiferromagnetic MnF$_2$.

<p>The effects of frustration on extended supersolid states is a largely
unexplored subject in the realm of cold-atom systems. In this work, we explore
the impact of quasicrystalline lattices on the supersolid phases of dipolar

variety of modulated phases, merging the inherent solid pattern with a
quasiperiodic decoration induced by the external potential. As the lattice
becomes stronger, we observe a super quasicrystal phase and a Bose glass phase.
Our results, supported by a detailed discussion on experimental feasibility
using dysprosium atoms and quasicrystalline optical lattice potentials, open a
new avenue in the exploration of long-range interacting quantum systems in
aperiodic environments. We provide a solid foundation for future experimental
investigations, potentially confirming our theoretical predictions and

<h3>Particle-hole asymmetric phases in doped twisted bilayer graphene</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Run Hou, Shouvik Sur, Lucas K. Wagner, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy</i>
<p>Despite much theoretical work, developing a comprehensive ab initio model for
twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has proven challenging due to the inherent
trade-off between accurately describing the band structure and incorporating
the interactions within the Hamiltonian, particularly given the topological
obstruction -- so-called fragile topology -- to the description of the model in
terms of localized symmetric Wannier functions within the flat band manifold.
Here, we circumvent this obstruction by using an extended 8-orbital model, for
which localized Wannier orbitals have been formulated by Carr et al. [1]. We
constructed an extended multi-orbital Hubbard model, and performed Hartree-Fock
(HF) calculations to explore its phase diagram across commensurate fillings
from -3 to 3. We found several nearly-degenerate insulating states at charge
neutrality, all of which exhibit orbital orders. Crucially, TBG near magic
angle is known to be particle-hole asymmetric, which is naturally captured by
the single-particle band structure of our model and is reflected in the
distinction between the symmetry broken states obtained at electron and hole
dopings away from the charge neutral point. At filling -1 and +2, quantum
anomalous hall states are obtained, while for the rest of the integer fillings
away from charge neutrality, we found the system to realize metallic states
with various orbital, valley and spin orderings. We also observed that most of
the Hartree--Fock ground states exhibit a generalized valley Hund's-like rule,
resulting in valley polarization. Importantly, we show that the incorporation
of the intra-valley and inter-valley exchange interactions is crucial to
properly stabilize the ordered symmetry-broken states. In agreement with
experiments, we find significant particle-hole asymmetry, which underscores the
importance of using particle-hole asymmetric models.

<br>
</p><i>Miguel Sánchez Sánchez, Israel Díaz, José González, Tobias Stauber</i>
<p>High hydrostatic pressures can be used to induce flat bands in twisted
bilayer graphene, at twist angles larger than those realizing the usual
magic-angle condition. Here, we characterize the emerging spin-degenerate
correlated insulator phases for a (magic) twist angle of $\theta=3.5^\circ$ at
even integer filling factors $\nu=0,\pm2$ by relying on an exact
self-consistent real-space Hartree-Fock approach that accounts for the screened
long-range Coulomb interaction $\epsilon$ as well as the on-site Hubbard
interaction $U$. We further present a novel algorithm that maps the full
real-space density matrix to a reduced density matrix based on a $SU(4)$
symmetry of sublattice and valley degree of freedom. At charge-neutrality, we
obtain a pure state of a Kramers intervalley coherent insulator localized on
the moir\'e unit cell with a trivial gap. For $\nu=\pm2$, we obtain a mixed
state, either valley polarized or valley coherent with Chern number $|C|=1$
pero spin-channel. In the weak coupling limit $\epsilon=54$ and $U=4$eV, this
leads to nematic Ising superconductivity for $\nu=-2.4$ and conventional
triplet superconductivity for $\nu=2.3$, that can experimentally be tested.

<p>Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) provides an ideal basis for
gate-controlled, and free of etching, electronic devices. Theoretical modeling
of realistic devices is an essential part of research, however, simulations of
large-scale BLG devices continue to be extremely challenging. Micrometer-sized
systems are predominantly beyond the reach of the commonly used atomistic
tight-binding method, while other numerical approaches based on the two
dimensional Dirac equation are not straightforward to conduct due to the
fermion doubling problem. Here we present an approach based on the continuum
model, unharmed by the fermion doubling. The discretization of the BLG
continuum Hamiltonian leads to an effective four-band model, with both valleys
built-in. We demonstrate its performance with realistic, large-scale systems,
and obtain results consistent with experiments and with the tight-binding
model, over a broad range of magnetic field.

<br>
</p><i>Gunjan Auti, Soumyadeep Paul, Shohei Chiashi, Hirofumi Daiguji</i>
<p>The phase transition of confined fluids in mesoporous materials deviates from
that of bulk fluids due to the former's interactions with the surrounding
heterogeneous structure. For example, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) create a
strong heterogeneous field, so adsorbed fluids in MOFs have atypical phase
characteristics such as capillary condensation and higher-order phase
transitions. These characteristics are modeled by decoupling the host-guest and
guest-guest interactions as a many-body problem in the presence of an external
nonuniform field. To solve the three-dimensional Ising model, we use mean-field
theory to approximate the guest-guest interactions and Mayer's (f)-functions to
describe the host-guest interactions in a unit cell. Later, using Hill's theory
of nanothermodynamics, we define differential and integral thermodynamic
functions to describe confined fluids. These integral properties are then used
to understand the phase transition in confined fluids. The investigation
reveals a distinct behavior where fluids confined in larger pores undergo a
discontinuous (first-order) phase transition, whereas those confined in smaller
pores undergo a continuous (higher-order) phase transition. Furthermore, the
results indicate that the free-energy barrier for phase transitions is lower in
confined fluids than in bulk fluids, which helps explain the lower condensation
pressure relative to the bulk saturation pressure. Finally, the integral
thermodynamic functions are succinctly presented in the form of a phase
diagram, marking an initial step toward a more practical approach for
understanding the phase behavior of confined fluids.

<p>The kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ hosts a variety of charge density
wave (CDW) phases, which play a fundamental role in the formation of other
exotic electronic instabilities. However, identifying the precise structure of
these CDW phases and their intricate relationships remain the subject of
intense debate, due to the lack of static probes that can distinguish the CDW
phases with identical spatial periodicity. Here, we unveil the competition
between two coexisting $2\times2\times2$ CDWs in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ harnessing
time-resolved X-ray diffraction. By analyzing the light-induced changes in the
intensity of CDW superlattice peaks, we demonstrate the presence of both
phases, each displaying a significantly different amount of melting upon
excitation. The anomalous light-induced sharpening of peak width further shows
that the phase that is more resistant to photo-excitation exhibits an increase
in domain size at the expense of the other, thereby showcasing a hallmark of
phase competition. Our results not only shed light on the interplay between the
multiple CDW phases in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, but also establish a non-equilibrium
framework for comprehending complex phase relationships that are challenging to
disentangle using static techniques.

</p><i>Keyu Zeng, Ziqiang Wang</i>
<p>Flat bands in electronic band structures are intriguing platforms for strong
correlation and topological physics, primarily due to the suppressed kinetic
energy of electrons. Various methods have been developed to create flat bands,
utilizing lattice geometry or finely tuned parameters. Despite this, the
investigation of orbital symmetry in multiorbital materials is a relatively new
area of focus. In this work, we propose a site symmetry based systematic
approach to emerging multiorbital flat bands in lattices made of
corner-connecting motifs such as the kagome and pyrochlore lattices. As a
conceptual advance, the one-orbital flat bands are shown to originate as mutual
eigenstates of isolated molecular motifs. Further developing the mutual
eigenstate method for multiorbitals transforming differently under the site
symmetries such as mirror and inversion, we derive multiorbital flat bands from
the skew-symmetric interorbital Hamiltonian and introduce an isolated molecule
enabled group-theoretic description of the flat band wavefunctions.
Realizations of the multiorbital flatbands in relevant materials are shown to
be possible under the Slater-Koster formalism. Our findings provide new
directions for exploring flatband electronic structures for novel correlated
and topological quantum states.

<p>The S = 1/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnet (TLAF) stands out as a
paradigmatic example of frustrated quantum magnetism. An ongoing challenge
involves understanding the influence of exchange anisotropy on the collective
behavior within such systems. Using inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and
advanced calculation techniques, we have studied the low and high temperature
spin dynamics of Ba2La2CoTe2O12 (BLCTO): a Co2+-based Jeff = 1/2 TLAF that
exhibits 120 deg order below TN = 3.26 K. The spin Hamiltonian was determined
by fitting the energy-resolved paramagnetic excitations measured at T > TN,
revealing an exceptionally strong easy-plane XXZ exchange anisotropy. Below TN,
the excitation spectrum exhibits a high energy continuum having a larger
spectral weight than the single-magnon modes. Combined with advanced
theoretical calculations of magnetic excitations based on magnons and spinons,
this observation suggests a scenario characterized by a spinon confinement
length that markedly exceeds the lattice spacing. We conjecture that this
phenomenon arises due to the proximity to a quantum melting point, which
persists even in the presence of strong easy-plane XXZ anisotropy. Finally, we
highlight characteristic flat features in the excitation spectrum, which are
connected to higher-order van Hove singularities in the magnon dispersion and
are directly induced by easy-plane XXZ anisotropy. Our results provide a rare
experimental insight into the nature of highly anisotropic S = 1/2 TLAFs
between the Heisenberg and XY limits.

<p>The out of time order correlator (OTOC) serves as a powerful tool for
investigating quantum information spreading and chaos in complex systems. We
present a method employing non-equilibrium dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT)
and coherent potential approximation (CPA) combined with diagrammatic
perturbation on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour to calculate the OTOC for
correlated fermionic systems subjected to both random disorder and electrons
interaction. Our key finding is that random disorder enhances the OTOC decay in
the Hubbard model for the metallic phase in the weak coupling limit. However,
the current limitation of our perturbative solver restricts the applicability
to weak interaction regimes.
