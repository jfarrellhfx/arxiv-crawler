<h3>Parameters of state in the global thermodynamics of binary ideal gas  mixtures in a stationary heat flow</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10094" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10094</a>
<br>
<i>Anna Maciolek, Robert Holyst, Karol Makuch, Konrad Giżynski, Pawel J. Żuk</i>
<p>We formulate the first law of global thermodynamics for stationary states of
the binary ideal gas mixture subjected to heat flow. We map the non-uniform
system onto the uniform one and show that the internal energy
$U(S^*,V,N_1,N_2,f_1^*,f_2^*)$ is the function of the following parameters of
state: a non-equilibrium entropy $S^*$, volume $V$, number of particles of the
first component, $N_1$, number of particles of the second component $N_2$ and
the renormalized degrees of freedom. The parameters $f_1^*,f_2^*$, $N_1, N_2$
satisfy the relation $x_1f_1^*/f_1+x_2f_2^*/f_2=1$ ($f_1$, where $x_i$ is the
fraction of $i$ component, and $f_2$ are the degrees of freedom for each
component respectively). Thus only 5 parameters of state describe the
non-equilibrium state of the binary mixture in the heat flow. We calculate the
non-equilibrium entropy $S^{*}$ and new thermodynamic parameters of state
$f_1^*, f_2^*$ explicitly. The latter are responsible for heat generation due
to the concentration gradients. The theory reduces to equilibrium
thermodynamics, when the heat flux goes to zero. As in equilibrium
thermodynamics, the steady-state fundamental equation also leads to the
thermodynamic Maxwell relations for measurable steady-state properties.

<p>Fractals are ubiquitous natural emergences that have gained increased
attention in engineering applications, thanks to recent technological
advancements enabling the fabrication of structures spanning across many
spatial scales. We show how the geometries of fractals can be exploited to
determine their important mechanical properties, such as the first and second
moments, which physically correspond to the center of mass and the moment of
inertia, using a family of complex fractals known as the dragons.

<h3>On the thermodynamics of DNA in the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model</h3>

<p>Based on the direct method of molecular dynamics, the temperature dependence
of energy, partition function, entropy and free energy, describing the
first-order phase transition, is calculated for the classical
Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model of the DNA molecule. It is shown that without
taking into account the quantum freezing of the degrees of freedom at low
temperatures, the relationship between these quantities is not determined. An
estimation was given for the number of bubbles in homogeneous DNA chains:
PolyA/PolyT and PolyG/PolyC.

<h3>Quantum Hall Effect on Dirac electrons in modulated graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10106" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10106</a>
<br>
<i>M Arsalan Ali</i>
<p>Theoretical investigation of Dirac electrons in electrically modulated
graphene under perpendicular magnetic field B is presented. We have carried out
a detailed study of modulation effect on Dirac electrons, which determine its
electrical transport properties. The periodic potential broadens the Landau
levels (LL), which oscillate with magnetic field B and a comparison made with
two-dimensional electron gas system (2DEGS). We have found the effect of Hall
conductivity on electronic conduction in this system. In addition, we find that
Hall conductivity exhibits Weiss oscillations and Shubnikov de Haas (SdH)
oscillations. The effect of temperature and the period of periodic potential on
these oscillations are studied in this work. Furthermore, an integral quantum
Hall effect in graphene is also discussed.

<h3>High-speed photoelastic tomography for axisymmetric stress fields in a  soft material: temporal evolution of all stress components</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10107" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10107</a>
<br>
<i>Yuto Yokoyama, Sayaka Ichihara, Yoshiyuki Tagawa</i>
<p>This study presents a novel approach for reconstructing all stress components
of the dynamic axisymmetric fields of a soft material using photoelastic
tomography (PT) and a high-speed polarization camera. This study focuses on
static and dynamic Hertzian contact as an example of transient stress field
reconstructions. For the static Hertzian contact (a solid sphere pressed
against a gel block), all stress components in the urethane gel, which has an
elastic modulus of 47.4 kPa, were reconstructed by PT using the measured
photoelastic parameters. The results were compared with theoretical solutions
and showed good agreement. For the dynamic Hertzian contact (a sphere impacting
gel), a high-speed polarization camera was used to reconstruct the transient
stress field within the gel. PT was used to quantitatively measure the shear
and axial stress waves and showed different propagation speeds on the
substrate. The technique allowed the simultaneous measurement of stress fields
ranging from $O(10^{-1})$ to $O(10^1)$ kPa during large deformations,
demonstrating its accuracy in capturing rapidly changing stress tensor
components in dynamic scenarios. The scaling laws of the calculated impact
force agreed with theoretical predictions, validating the accuracy of PT for
measuring dynamic axisymmetric stress fields in soft materials.

<h3>Configurational and Vibrational Entropy in Hydrogen-bonded Fluids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10109" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10109</a>
<br>
<i>Cillian Cockrell, Aleksandra Dragović</i>
<p>The thermodynamics of liquids and supercritical fluids is notorious for
eluding a general theory, as can be done for crystalline solids on the basis of
phonons and crystal symmetry. The extension of solid state notions such as
configurational entropy and phonons to the liquid state remains an intriguing
but challenging topic. This is particularly true for liquids like water whose
many structural anomalies give it unique properties. Here, for simple fluids,
we specify the thermodynamics across the liquid, supercritical, and gaseous
states using the spectrum of propagating phonons, thereby determining the
non-ideal entropy of the fluid using a single parameter arising from this
phonon spectrum. This identifies a marked distinction between these "simple"
fluids, and hydrogen bonded fluids whose non-ideal entropy cannot be determined
by the phonon spectrum alone. We relate this phonon theory of thermodynamics to
the previously observed excess entropy scaling in liquids and how the phonon
spectrum creates corresponding states across the fluid phase diagram. These
results provide important theoretical understanding to supercritical fluid,
whose properties are still poorly understood despite widespread deployment in
environmental and energy applications.

<h3>Comment on "Magnetoplasmons in a 2D electron fluid: Disk geometry"</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10120" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10120</a>
<br>
<i>M.V. Cheremisin</i>
<p>The main results of the commented article do not raise objections, but their
final processing seems doubtful. Namely, the spectra of zero-field plasmon with
a fixed angular momentum $l = 0.1..4$ was scaled using a certain reference
frequency and, then displayed as a function of a specific screening parameter.
Oddly enough, it turned out that the reference frequency includes the screening
parameter explicitly. Obviously, it is a trivial error in scaling procedure.
For this reason the physical meaning of the result becomes lost, especially for
zero value of screening parameter. The similar scaling method was performed for
magnetoplasmon spectra at fixed values $0;0.5;\infty$ of screening parameter.
Again, the case of zero screening parameter is doubtful. Both examples are
exactly the source of misunderstandings. The original data for the axisymmetric
plasmon $l=0$ were corrected and, then compared with the that followed from
so-called telegraph line model, showing a difference of only 5 percent. We
claim that the telegraph line model would be useful for describing disk-shaped
plasmon devices with/without ring gratings.

<h3>Amino acid chiral amplification using Monte Carlo dynamic</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10128" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10128</a>
<br>
<i>Romulo Cruz-Simbron, Gino Picasso, Jose Cerda-Hernandez</i>
<p>The present work focuses on the processes of chiral amplification that lead
to the rapid growth of the enantiomeric excess in a solution, utilizing a
lattice model and a suitable Glauber dynamics. The initial conditions stem from
a racemic mixture or points near the racemic state. The aim is to understand
the effect of some variables such as temperature, concentration and constants
that define the interaction energies in the equilibrium concentration after the
dynamic evolution of the system. Dynamic evolution involves a path towards
phase equilibrium in a D-L-S system, where D and L represent opposite chiral
molecules and S represents their poorly soluble solvent. Our results,
pertaining to the phase equilibrium of the D-L-S system employing amino acids,
faithfully reproduce several experimentally observed outcomes documented in the
literature. Through simulations, we may understand how the system evolved over
time, starting from a random configuration and moving toward an equilibrium
state with the lowest possible potential energy. We were able to recreate phase
diagrams that were strikingly close to those obtained experimentally by
specifying an appropriate Glauber dynamics for the system. Finally, we will
discuss some findings from the dynamics of the chiral amplification processes
that were modeled.

<h3>A Unified Interface Model for Dissipative Transport of Bosons and  Fermions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10138" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10138</a>
<br>
<i>Y. Minoguchi, J. Huber, L. Garbe, A. Gambassi, P. Rabl</i>
<p>We study the directed transport of bosons along a one dimensional lattice in
a dissipative setting, where the hopping is only facilitated by coupling to a
Markovian reservoir. By combining numerical simulations with a field-theoretic
analysis, we investigate the current fluctuations for this process and
determine its asymptotic behavior. These findings demonstrate that dissipative
bosonic transport belongs to the KPZ universality class and therefore, in spite
of the drastic difference in the underlying particle statistics, it features
the same coarse grained behavior as the corresponding asymmetric simple
exclusion process (ASEP) for fermions. However, crucial differences between the
two processes emerge when focusing on the full counting statistics of current
fluctuations. By mapping both models to the physics of fluctuating interfaces,
we find that dissipative transport of bosons and fermions can be understood as
surface growth and erosion processes, respectively. Within this unified
description, both the similarities and discrepancies between the full counting
statistics of the transport are reconciled. Beyond purely theoretical interest,
these findings are relevant for experiments with cold atoms or long-lived
quasi-particles in nanophotonic lattices, where such transport scenarios can be
realized.

<h3>Itinerant Magnetism in the Triangular Lattice Hubbard Model at  Half-doping: Application to Twisted Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10146" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10146</a>
<br>
<i>Yuchi He, Roman Rausch, Matthias Peschke, Christoph Karrasch, Philippe Corboz, Nick Bultinck, S.A. Parameswaran</i>
<p>We use unrestricted Hartree-Fock, density matrix renormalization group, and
variational projected entangled pair state calculations to investigate the
ground state phase diagram of the triangular lattice Hubbard model at "half
doping" relative to single occupancy, i.e. at a filling of $(1\pm \frac{1}{2})$
electrons per site. The electron-doped case has a nested Fermi surface in the
non-interacting limit, and hence a weak-coupling instability towards
density-wave orders whose wavevectors are determined by Fermi surface nesting
conditions. We find that at moderate to strong interaction strengths other
spatially-modulated orders arise, with wavevectors distinct from the nesting
vectors. In particular, we identify a series closely-competing itinerant
long-wavelength magnetically ordered states, yielding to uniform ferromagnetic
order at the largest interaction strengths. For half-hole doping and a similar
range of interaction strengths, our data indicate that magnetic orders are most
likely absent.

<h3>Robust non-ergodicity of ground state in the $β$ ensemble</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10150" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10150</a>
<br>
<i>Adway Kumar Das, Anandamohan Ghosh, Ivan M. Khaymovich</i>
<p>In various chaotic quantum many-body systems, the ground states show
non-trivial athermal behavior despite the bulk states exhibiting
thermalization. Such athermal states play a crucial role in quantum information
theory and its applications. Moreover, any generic quantum many-body system in
the Krylov basis is represented by a tridiagonal Lanczos Hamiltonian, which is
analogous to the matrices from the $\beta$ ensemble, a well-studied random
matrix model with level repulsion tunable via the parameter $\beta$. Motivated
by this, here we focus on the localization properties of the ground and
anti-ground states of the $\beta$ ensemble. Both analytically and numerically,
we show that both the edge states demonstrate non-ergodic (fractal) properties
for $\beta\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$ while the typical bulk states are ergodic.
Surprisingly, the fractal dimension of the edge states remain three time
smaller than that of the bulk states irrespective of the global phase of the
$\beta$ ensemble. In addition to the fractal dimensions, we also consider the
distribution of the localization centers of the spectral edge states, their
mutual separation, as well as the spatial and correlation properties of the
first excited states.

<h3>An analytical investigation into solute transport and sorption via  intra-particle diffusion in the dual-porosity limit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10161" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10161</a>
<br>
<i>Lucy C. Auton, Maria Aguareles, Abel Valverde, Timothy G. Myers, Marc Calvo-Schwarzwalder</i>
<p>We develop a mathematical model for adsorption based on averaging the flow
around, and diffusion inside, adsorbent particles in a column. The model
involves three coupled partial differential equations for the contaminant
concentration both in the carrier fluid and within the particle as well as the
adsorption rate. The adsorption rate is modelled using the Sips equation, which
is suitable for describing both physical and chemical adsorption mechanisms.
Non-dimensionalisation is used to determine the controlling parameter groups as
well as to determine negligible terms and so reduce the system complexity. The
inclusion of intra-particle diffusion introduces new dimensionless parameters
to those found in standard works, including a form of internal Damk\"ohler
number and a new characteristic time scale. We provide a numerical method for
the full model and show how in certain situations a travelling wave approach
can be utilized to find analytical solutions. The model is validated against
available experimental data for the removal of Mercury(II) and CO$_\text{2}$.
The results show excellent agreement with measurements of column outlet
contaminant concentration and provide insights into the underlying chemical
reactions.

<p>A key challenge in antiferromagnetic spintronics is the control of spin
configuration on nanometer scales applicable to solid-state technologies.
Bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) is a multiferroic material that exhibits both
ferroelectricity and canted antiferromagnetism at room temperature, making it a
unique candidate in the development of electric-field controllable magnetic
devices. The magnetic moments in BiFeO3 are arranged into a spin cycloid,
resulting in unique magnetic properties which are tied to the ferroelectric
order. Previous understanding of this coupling has relied on average, mesoscale
measurements to infer behavior. Using nitrogen vacancy-based diamond
magnetometry, we show that the spin cycloid can be deterministically controlled
with an electric field. The energy landscape of the cycloid is shaped by both
the ferroelectric degree of freedom and strain-induced anisotropy, restricting
the magnetization changes to specific ferroelectric switching events. This
study provides understanding of the antiferromagnetic texture in BiFeO3 and
paves new avenues for designing magnetic textures and spintronic devices.

<h3>Ultrafast all-optical toggle writing of magnetic bits without relying on  heat</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10173" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10173</a>
<br>
<i>T. Zalewski, A. Maziewski, A.V. Kimel, A. Stupakiewicz</i>
<p>While in accordance with Curie's principle, one would intuitively expect that
symmetry of the cause has to be found in the symmetry of the effect, ultrafast
excitation of matter is able to violate this principle. For instance, it is
believed that heating alone, obviously not having the symmetry of a magnetic
field, cannot result in a deterministic reversal of magnetization. However, if
the heating is induced by a femtosecond laser pulse and thus ultrafast, it does
facilitate toggle switching of magnetization between stable bit-states without
any magnetic field at all. Here we show that the regime of ultrafast toggle
switching beyond Curie's principle can be also realized via a mechanism without
relying on any heat. In particular, ultrafast laser excitation of iron-garnet
with linearly polarized light modifies magnetic anisotropy and thus causes
toggling magnetization between two stable bit states. In contrast to the
laser-heat-induced magnetization reversal, this new regime of 'cold' toggle
switching can be observed in ferrimagnets without the compensation point and in
an exceptionally broad temperature range. The control of magnetic anisotropy
required for the toggle switching is accompanied by lower dissipations, than in
the mechanism of laser-induced-heating, but the dissipations and the
switching-time are shown to be competing parameters.

<h3>Gate modulation of the hole singlet-triplet qubit frequency in germanium</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10188" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10188</a>
<br>
<i>John Rooney, Zhentao Luo, Lucas E. A. Stehouwer, Giordano Scappucci, Menno Veldhorst, Hong-Wen Jiang</i>
<p>Spin qubits in germanium gate-defined quantum dots have made considerable
progress within the last few years, partially due to their strong spin-orbit
coupling and site-dependent $g$-tensors. While this characteristic of the
$g$-factors removes the need for micromagnets and allows for the possibility of
all-electric qubit control, relying on these $g$-tensors necessitates the need
to understand their sensitivity to the confinement potential that defines the
quantum dots. Here, we demonstrate a $S-T\_$ qubit whose frequency is a strong
function of the voltage applied to the barrier gate shared by the quantum dots.
We find a $g$-factor that can be approximately increased by an order of
magnitude adjusting the barrier gate voltage only by 12 mV. We attribute the
strong dependence to a variable strain profile in our device. This work not
only reinforces previous findings that site-dependent $g$-tensors in germanium
can be utilized for qubit manipulation, but reveals the sensitivity and
tunability these $g$-tensors have to the electrostatic confinement of the
quantum dot.

<h3>A case study of multi-modal, multi-institutional data management for the  combinatorial materials science community</h3>

<i>Sarah I. Allec, Eric S. Muckley, Nathan S. Johnson, Andrew S. Lee, James E. Saal, Logan Ward, Apurva Mehta</i>
<p>Although the convergence of high-performance computing, automation, and
machine learning has significantly altered the materials design timeline,
transformative advances in functional materials and acceleration of their
design will require addressing the deficiencies that currently exist in
materials informatics, particularly a lack of standardized experimental data
management. The challenges associated with experimental data management are
especially true for combinatorial materials science, where advancements in
automation of experimental workflows have produced datasets that are often too
large and too complex for human reasoning. The data management challenge is
further compounded by the multi-modal and multi-institutional nature of these
datasets, as they tend to be distributed across multiple institutions and can
vary substantially in format, size, and content. To adequately map a materials
design space from such datasets, an ideal materials data infrastructure would
contain data and metadata describing i) synthesis and processing conditions,
ii) characterization results, and iii) property and performance measurements.
Here, we present a case study for the development of such a dashboard that
enables standardized organization, analysis, and visualization of a large data
lake consisting of combinatorial datasets of synthesis and processing
conditions, X-ray diffraction patterns, and materials property measurements.
While this dashboard was developed specifically for data-driven thermoelectric
materials discovery, we envision the adaptation of this prototype to other
materials applications, and, more ambitiously, future integration into an
all-encompassing materials data management infrastructure.

<h3>High-order Harmonic Generation in Thermotropic Liquid Crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10211" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10211</a>
<br>
<i>Andrea Annunziata, Luise Becker, Marta Luisa Murillo-Sánchez, Patrick Friebel, Salvatore Stagira, Davide Faccialà, Caterina Vozzi, Laura Cattaneo</i>
<p>Thermotropic liquid crystals are versatile optical materials that exhibit a
state of matter intermediate between liquids and solids. Their properties can
change significantly with temperature, pressure, or other external factors,
leading to different phases. The transport properties within these materials in
different phases are still largely unexplored and their understanding would
enable exciting prospects for innovative technological advancements. High-order
harmonic spectroscopy proved to be a powerful spectroscopic tool for
investigating the electronic and nuclear dynamics in matter. Here we report the
first experimental observation of high-order harmonic generation in
thermotropic liquid crystals in two different phase states, nematic and
isotropic. We found the harmonic emission in the nematic phase to be strongly
dependent on the relative orientation of the driving field polarization with
respect to the liquid crystal alignment. Specifically, the harmonic yield has a
maximum when the molecules are aligned perpendicularly to the polarization of
the incoming radiation. Our results establish the first step for applying
high-order harmonic spectroscopy as a tool for resolving ultrafast electron
dynamics in liquid crystals with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution.

<h3>Thermally stable p-wave repulsive Fermi polaron without a two-body bound  state</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10238" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10238</a>
<br>
<i>Hui Hu, Jia Wang, Xia-Ji Liu</i>
<p>We theoretically investigate the polaron physics of an impurity immersed in a
two-dimensional Fermi sea, interacting via a p-wave interaction at finite
temperature. In the unitary limit with a divergent scattering area, we find a
well-defined repulsive Fermi polaron at short interaction range, which shows a
remarkable thermal stability with increasing temperature. The appearance of
such a stable repulsive Fermi polaron in the resonantly interacting limit can
be attributed to the existence of a quasi-bound dressed molecule state hidden
in the two-particle continuum, although there is no bound state in the
two-particle limit. We show that the repulsive Fermi polaron disappears when
the interaction range increases or when the scattering area is tuned to the
weakly-interacting regime. The large interaction range and small scattering
area instead stabilize attractive Fermi polarons.

<h3>Liouvillian-gap analysis of open quantum many-body systems in the weak  dissipation limit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10304" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10304</a>
<br>
<i>Takashi Mori</i>
<p>Recent experiments have reported that novel physics emerge in open quantum
many-body systems due to an interplay of interactions and dissipation, which
stimulate theoretical studies of the many-body Lindblad equation. Although the
strong dissipation regime receives considerable interest in this context, this
work focuses on the weak bulk dissipation. By examining the spectral property
of the many-body Lindblad generator, we find that its spectral gap generically
shows singularity in the weak dissipation limit when the thermodynamic limit is
taken first. Such singular behavior is related to the concept of the
Ruelle-Pollicott resonance in chaos theory, which determines the timescale of
thermalization of an isolated system. Thus, the many-body Lindblad equation in
the weak dissipation regime contains nontrivial information on intrinsic
properties of a quantum many-body system.

to electrical transport, we report a new type of inter-moir\'e Hofstadter

quasicrystal length scales of the reconstructed moir\'e of moir\'e (MoM)
superlattice, shedding new light on emergent physics from competing atomic

<h3>Effective diffusion of a tracer in active bath: a path-integral approach</h3>

<br>
<i>Mengkai Feng, Zhonghuai Hou</i>
<p>We investigate the effective diffusion of a tracer immersed in an active
particle bath consisting of self-propelled particles. Utilising the Dean's
method developed for the equilibrium bath and extending it to the
nonequilibrium situation, we derive a generalized Langevin equation (GLE) for
the tracer particle. The complex interactions between the tracer and bath
particles are shown as a memory kernel term and two colored noise terms. To
obtain the effective diffusivity of the tracer, we use path integral technique
to calculate all necessary correlation functions. Calculations show the
effective diffusion decreases with the persistent time of active force, and has
rich behavior with number density of bath particles, depending on different
activity. All theoretical results regarding the dependence of such diffusivity
on bath parameters have been confirmed by direct computer simulation.

<h3>Observation of superconductivity and enhanced upper critical field of  $η$-carbide-type oxide Zr${_\mathrm{4}}$Pd$_{\mathrm{2}}$O</h3>

<p>We report the first observation of bulk superconductivity of a
${\eta}$-carbide-type oxide Zr$_{4}$Pd$_{2}$O. The crystal structure and the
superconducting properties were studied through synchrotron X-ray diffraction,
magnetization, electrical resistivity, and specific heat measurement. The
superconducting transition was observed at $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ = 2.73 K. Our
measurement revealed that the ${\eta}$-carbide-type oxide superconductor
Zr$_{4}$Pd$_{2}$O shows an enhanced upper critical field
${\mu_{\mathrm{0}}H_{\mathrm{c2}}\mathrm{(0)}}$ = 6.72 T, which violates the
Pauli-Clogston limit ${\mu_{\mathrm{0}}H_{\mathrm{P}}}$ = 5.29 T. On the other
hand, we found that the enhanced upper critical field is absent in a Rh
analogue Zr$_{4}$Rh$_{2}$O. The large
${\mu_{\mathrm{0}}H_{\mathrm{c2}}\mathrm{(0)}}$ of Zr$_{4}$Pd$_{2}$O would be
raised from strong spin-orbit coupling with Pd-4$d$ electrons. The discovery of
new superconducting properties for Zr$_{4}$Pd$_{2}$O would shed light on the
further development of ${\eta}$-carbide-type oxide superconductors.

<i>Alexey A. Kaverzin, Bart J. van Wees, Eiji Saitoh</i>
<p>Quality of the electrical contacts and interfaces in various
metal/semiconductor/insulator heterostructures is one of the pivotal aspects in
both applied and fundamental research areas. For instance, non-optimal contact
resistance can limit the overall efficiency of a certain developed technology
and thus considerably narrow the range or fully block its practical
application. On the other hand in fundamental research it is often the case
that the manifestation of targeted phenomenon crucially depends on the level of
contamination in the fabricated experimental samples. Here we offer a set of
recipes that are aimed at contamination-free and damage-free fabrication of the
devices, mostly developed for the two dimensional materials, but nevertheless
applicable for a wider range of the systems, where the quality of the
interfaces and/or non-invasiveness of the fabrication recipes are important.
Our recipes are based on the preparation of the flexible PMMA membranes, with
the help of which we can prepare residue-free or damage-free electrical
connections to the studied material.

<h3>A molecular dynamics simulation study of thermal conductivity of  plumbene</h3>

<br>
<i>Rafat Mohammadi, Behrad Karimi, John Kieffer, Daniel Hashemi</i>
<p>We investigate the thermal conductivity of plumbene using molecular dynamics
simulations, overcoming existing limitations by optimizing the parameters of
Tersoff and Stillinger-Weber potentials via artificial neural networks. Our
findings indicate that at room temperature, the thermal conductivity of a 1050
A* 300 A plumbene sheet is approximately 8 W/m.K, significantly lower (23%)
than that of bulk lead. Our analysis elucidates that thermal conductivity is
enhanced by increased sample length, while it is reduced by temperature.
Moreover, plumbene samples with zigzag edges display superior thermal
conductivity compared to those with armchair edges. In addition, the thermal
conductivity of plumbene exhibits an increase at low tensile strains, whereas
it decreases as the strains become larger. This investigation provides crucial
insights into the thermal conductivity behavior of plumbene under varying
conditions.

<br>
<i>Lucas Foppa, Matthias Scheffler</i>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) can accelerate the design of materials by
identifying correlations and complex patterns in data. However, AI methods
commonly attempt to describe the entire, immense materials space with a single
model, while it is typical that different mechanisms govern the materials
behaviors across the materials space. The subgroup-discovery (SGD) approach
identifies local rules describing exceptional subsets of data with respect to a
given target. Thus, SGD can focus on mechanisms leading to exceptional
performance. However, the identification of appropriate SG rules requires a
careful consideration of the generality-exceptionality tradeoff. Here, we
discuss challenges to advance the SGD approach in materials science and analyse
the tradeoff between exceptionality and generality based on a Pareto front of
SGD solutions.

<h3>A Bridge between Dynamical Systems and Machine Learning: Engineered  Ordinary Differential Equations as Classification Algorithm (EODECA)</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10387" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10387</a>
<br>
<i>Raffaele Marino, Lorenzo Giambagli, Lorenzo Chicchi, Lorenzo Buffoni, Duccio Fanelli</i>
<p>In a world increasingly reliant on machine learning, the interpretability of
these models remains a substantial challenge, with many equating their
functionality to an enigmatic black box. This study seeks to bridge machine
learning and dynamical systems. Recognizing the deep parallels between dense
neural networks and dynamical systems, particularly in the light of
non-linearities and successive transformations, this manuscript introduces the
Engineered Ordinary Differential Equations as Classification Algorithms
(EODECAs). Uniquely designed as neural networks underpinned by continuous
ordinary differential equations, EODECAs aim to capitalize on the
well-established toolkit of dynamical systems. Unlike traditional deep learning
models, which often suffer from opacity, EODECAs promise both high
classification performance and intrinsic interpretability. They are naturally
invertible, granting them an edge in understanding and transparency over their
counterparts. By bridging these domains, we hope to usher in a new era of
machine learning models where genuine comprehension of data processes
complements predictive prowess.

<h3>Interfacial instabilities in confined displacements involving  non-Newtonian fluids</h3>

<br>
<i>Vaibhav Raj Singh Parmar, Ranjini Bandyopadhyay</i>
<p>The growth of interfacial instabilities during fluid displacements can be
driven by gradients in pressure, viscosity and surface tension, and by applying
external fields. Since displacements of non-Newtonian fluids such as polymer
solutions, colloidal and granular slurries are ubiquitous in natural and
industrial processes, understanding the growth mechanisms and fully-developed
morphologies of interfacial patterns involving non-Newtonian fluids is
extremely important. In this perspective, we focus on {displacement
experiments} wherein competition{s} between capillary, viscous, elastic and
frictional forces drive the onset and growth of interfacial instabilities in
confined geometries. We conclude by highlighting several exciting open problems
in this research area.

<h3>Perspectives of running self-consistent DMFT calculations for strongly  correlated electron systems on noisy quantum computing hardware</h3>

<br>
<i>Jannis Ehrlich, Daniel Urban, Christian Elsässer</i>
<p>Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is one of the powerful computatioinal
approaches to study electron correlation effects in solid-state materials and
molecules. Its practical applicability is, however, limited by the exponential
growth of the many-particle Hilbert space with the number of considered
electronic orbitals. Here, the possibility of a one-to-one mapping between
electronic orbitals and the state of a qubit register suggests a significant
computational advantage for the use of a Quantum Computer (QC) for solving DMFT
models. In this work we present a QC approach to solve a two-site DMFT model
based on the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. We discuss the
challenges arising from stochastic errors and suggest a means to overcome
unphysical features in the self-energy. We thereby demonstrate the feasibility
to obtain self-consistent results of the two-site DMFT model based on VQE
simulations with a finite number of shots. We systematically compare results
obtained on simulators with calculations on the IBMQ Ehningen QC hardware.

<h3>Using multicomponent recycled electronic waste alloys to produce high  entropy alloys</h3>

<br>
<i>Jose M. Torralba, Diego Iriarte, Damien Tourret, Alberto Meza</i>
<p>The amount of electronic waste (e-waste) recycled worldwide is less than 20%
of the total amount produced. In a world where the need for critical and
strategic metals is increasing almost exponentially, it is unacceptable that
tons of these elements remain unrecycled. One of the causes of this low level
of recycling is that recycling is based on an expensive and complex selective
sorting of metals. Extracting all metals simultaneously is much simpler and if
this were done, it would significantly increase the recycling rate. Meanwhile,
it was demonstrated that high entropy alloys (HEAs), which are in great demand
in applications where very high performance is required, can be made from
mixtures of complex alloys, hence reducing their dependence on pure critical
metals. Here, we show that it is possible to obtain competitive HEAs from
complex alloy mixtures corresponding to typical electronic waste compositions,
combining two needs of high interest in our society, namely: to increase the
level of recycling of electronic waste and the possibility of developing
high-performance HEAs without the need of using critical and/or strategic
metals. To validate our hypothesis that e-waste can be used to produce
competitive HEAs, we propose an alloy design strategy combining computational
thermodynamics (CalPhaD) exploration of phase diagrams and phenomenological
criteria for HEA design based on thermodynamic and structural parameters. A
shortlist of selected compositions are then fabricated by arc melting ensuring
compositional homogeneity of such complex alloys and, finally, characterised
microstructurally, using electron microscopy and diffraction analysis, and
mechanically, using hardness testing.

<h3>General limit to thermodynamic annealing performance</h3>

<br>
<i>Yutong Luo, Yi-Zheng Zhen, Xiangjing Liu, Daniel Ebler, Oscar Dahlsten</i>
<p>Annealing has proven highly successful in finding minima in a cost landscape.
Yet, depending on the landscape, systems often converge towards local minima
rather than global ones. In this Letter, we analyse the conditions for which
annealing is approximately successful in finite time. We connect annealing to
stochastic thermodynamics to derive a general bound on the distance between the
system state at the end of the annealing and the ground state of the landscape.
This distance depends on the amount of state updates of the system and the
accumulation of non-equilibrium energy, two protocol and energy landscape
dependent quantities which we show are in a trade-off relation. We describe how
to bound the two quantities both analytically and physically. This offers a
general approach to assess the performance of annealing from accessible
parameters, both for simulated and physical implementations.

<br>
<i>Yutong Luo, Yi-Zheng Zhen, Xiangjing Liu, Daniel Ebler, Oscar Dahlsten</i>
<p>Annealing is the process of gradually lowering the temperature of a system to
guide it towards its lowest energy states. In an accompanying paper [Luo et al.
Phys. Rev. E 108, L052105 (2023)], we derived a general bound on annealing
performance by connecting annealing with stochastic thermodynamics tools,
including a speed-limit on state transformation from entropy production. We
here describe the derivation of the general bound in detail. In addition, we
analyze the case of simulated annealing with Glauber dynamics in depth. We show
how to bound the two case-specific quantities appearing in the bound, namely
the activity, a measure of the number of microstate jumps, and the change in
relative entropy between the state and the instantaneous thermal state, which
is due to temperature variation. We exemplify the arguments by numerical
simulations on the SK model of spin-glasses.

<h3>The influence of Gaussian pinning on the melting scenario of a  two-dimensional soft-disk system: First-Order versus Continuous Transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10444" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10444</a>
<br>
<i>Yu. D. Fomin, Eu. A. Gaiduk, E. N. Tsiok, V. N. Ryzhov</i>
<p>Two-dimensional systems are realized experimentally as thin layers on a
substrate. The substrate can have some imperfections (defects of the
crystalline structure, chemical impurities, etc.), which demonstrate stronger
interaction with the particles of the two-dimensional layer than the rest of
the system. Such randomly distributed centers of strong interactions are called
"pinning centers". The presence of random pinning can substantially change the
behavior of the system. It not only shifts the melting point of the system, but
can also change the melting scenario itself. In the present paper the influence
of Gaussian pinning on the melting scenario of a two-dimensional system of soft
disks is studied by means of molecular dynamics simulation. We randomly
introduce into the system of soft disks a set of "pinning centers" which
attract the particles via the Gauss potential. We observe that increasing the
depth of a Gaussian well leads to a change in the melting scenario of the
system. The results demonstrate that simple kind of quenched disorder can
significantly affect the melting scenario of two-dimensional systems, offering
the possibility of its introduction in complex experiments and studying its
influence on the self-assembly and phase diagram of two-dimensional systems in
rotating external fields.

<p>A spectroscopic imaging-scanning tunneling microscope (SI-STM) allows the
atomic scale visualization of surface electronic and magnetic structure of
novel quantum materials with high energy resolution. To achieve the optimal
performance, low vibration facility is required. Here, we describe the design
and the performance of an ultrahigh vacuum STM system supported by a hybrid
vibration isolation system that consists of a pneumatic passive and a
piezoelectric active vibration isolation stages. The STM system is equipped
with a 1K pot cryogenic insert and a 9 Tesla superconducting magnet, capable of
continuous SI-STM measurements for 7 days. A field ion microscopy system is
installed for in situ STM tip treatment. We present the detailed vibrational
noise analysis of the hybrid vibration isolation system and demonstrate the
performance of our STM system by taking high resolution spectroscopic maps and
topographic images on several quantum materials. Our results establish a new
strategy to achieve an effective vibration isolation system for high-resolution
STM and other scanning probe microscopy to investigate the nanoscale quantum
phenomena.

<h3>Enhancement of spin to charge conversion efficiency at the topological  surface state by inserting normal metal spacer layer in the topological  insulator based heterostructure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10460" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10460</a>
<br>
<i>Sayani Pal, Anuvab Nandi, Shambhu G. Nath, Pratap Kumar Pal, Kanav Sharma, Subhadip Manna, Anjan Barman, Chiranjib Mitra</i>
<p>We report efficient spin to charge conversion (SCC) in the topological
insulator (TI) based heterostructure ($BiSbTe_{1.5}Se_{1.5}/Cu/Ni_{80}Fe_{20}$)
by using spin-pumping technique where $BiSbTe_{1.5}Se_{1.5}$ is the TI and
$Ni_{80}Fe_{20}$ is the ferromagnetic layer. The SCC, characterized by inverse
Edelstein effect length ($\lambda_{IEE}$) in the TI material gets altered with
an intervening Copper (Cu) layer and it depends on the interlayer thickness.
The introduction of Cu layer at the interface of TI and ferromagnetic metal
(FM) provides a new degree of freedom for tuning the SCC efficiency of the
topological surface states. The significant enhancement of the measured
spin-pumping voltage and the linewidth of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR)
absorption spectra due to the insertion of Cu layer at the interface indicates
a reduction in spin memory loss at the interface that resulted from the
presence of exchange coupling between the surface states of TI and the local
moments of ferromagnetic metal. The temperature dependence (from 8K to 300K) of
the evaluated $\lambda_{IEE}$ data for all the trilayer systems, TI/Cu/FM with
different Cu thickness confirms the effect of exchange coupling between the TI
and FM layer on the spin to charge conversion efficiency of the topological
surface state.

<i>Josefine Enkner, Lorenzo Graziotto, Felice Appugliese, Vasil Rokaj, Jie Wang, Michael Ruggenthaler, Christian Reichl, Werner Wegscheider, Angel Rubio, Jérôme Faist</i>
<p>In light of recent developments demonstrating the impact of cavity vacuum
fields inducing the breakdown of topological protection in the integer quantum
Hall effect, a compelling question arises: what effects might cavity vacuum
fields have on fundamental constants in solid-state systems? In this work we
present an experiment that assesses the possibility of the von Klitzing
constant itself being modified. By employing a Wheatstone bridge, we precisely
measure the difference between the quantized Hall resistance of a
cavity-embedded Hall bar and the resistance standard, achieving an accuracy
down to 1 part in 105 for the lowest Landau level. While our results do not
suggest any deviation that could imply a modified Hall resistance, our work
represents pioneering efforts in exploring the fundamental implications of
vacuum fields in solid-state systems.

<h3>Interplay of phase segregation and chemical reaction: Crossover and  effect on growth laws</h3>

<br>
<i>Shubham Thwal, Suman Majumder</i>
<p>By combining the nonconserved spin-flip dynamics driving ferromagnetic
ordering with the conserved Kawasaki-exchange dynamics driving phase
segregation, we perform Monte Carlo simulations of the nearest neighbor Ising
model. Such a set up mimics a system consisting of a binary mixture of
\emph{isomers} which is simultaneously undergoing a segregation and an
\emph{interconversion} reaction among themselves . Here, we study such a system
following a quench from the high-temperature homogeneous phase to a temperature
below the demixing transition. We monitor the growth of domains of both the
\emph{winner}, the \emph{isomer} which survives as the majority and the
\emph{loser}, the \emph{isomer} that perishes. Our results show a strong
interplay of the two dynamics at early times leading to a growth of the average
domain size of both the \emph{winner} and \emph{loser} as $\sim t^{1/7}$,
slower than a purely phase-segregating system. At later times, eventually the
dynamics becomes reaction dominated, and the \emph{winner} exhibits a $\sim
t^{1/2}$ growth, expected for a system with purely nonconserved dynamics. On
the other hand, the \emph{loser} at first show a faster growth, albeit, slower
than the \emph{winner}, and then starts to decay before it almost vanishes.
Further, we estimate the time $\tau_s$ marking the crossover from the
early-time slow growth to the late-time reaction dominated faster growth. As a
function of the reaction probability $p_r$, we observe a power-law scaling
$\tau_s \sim p_r^{-x}$, where $x\approx 1.05$, irrespective of temperature. For
a fixed value of $p_r$ too, $\tau_s$ appears to be independent of temperature.

<p>We experimentally study the properties of a harmonically trapped photon gas
undergoing Bose-Einstein condensation along the dimensional crossover from one
to two dimensions. The photons are trapped inside a dye microcavity, where
polymer nanostructures provide a harmonic trapping potential for the photon
gas. By varying the aspect ratio of the trap we tune from an isotropic
two-dimensional confinement to an anisotropic, highly elongated one-dimensional
trapping potential. Along this transition, we determine caloric properties of
the photon gas, and find a softening of the second-order Bose-Einstein
condensation phase transition observed in two dimensions to a crossover
behaviour in one dimension.

<h3>Graphene-based thermopneumatic generator for on-board pressure supply of  soft robots</h3>

<br>
<i>Armin Reimers, Jannik Rank, Erik Greve, Morten Möller, Sören Kaps, Jörg Bahr, Rainer Adelung, Fabian Schütt</i>
<p>Various fields, including medical and human interaction robots, gain
advantages from the development of bioinspired soft actuators. Many recently
developed grippers are pneumatics that require external pressure supply
systems, thereby limiting the autonomy of these robots. This necessitates the
development of scalable and efficient on-board pressure generation systems.
While conventional air compression systems are hard to miniaturize,
thermopneumatic systems that joule-heat a transducer material to generate
pressure present a promising alternative. However, the transducer materials of
previously reported thermopneumatic systems demonstrate high heat capacities
and limited surface area resulting in long response times and low operation
frequencies. This study presents a thermopneumatic pressure generator using
aerographene, a highly porous (>99.99 %) network of interconnected graphene
microtubes, as lightweight and low heat capacity transducer material. An
aerographene pressurizer module (AGPM) can pressurize a reservoir of 4.2 cm3 to
about ~140 mbar in 50 ms. Periodic operation of the AGPM for 10 s at 0.66 Hz
can further increase the pressure in the reservoir to ~360 mbar. It is
demonstrated that multiple AGPMs can be operated parallelly or in series for
improved performance. For example, three parallelly operated AGPMs can generate
pressure pulses of ~215 mbar. Connecting AGPMs in series increases the maximum
pressure achievable by the system. It is shown that three AGPMs working in
series can pressurize the reservoir to ~2000 mbar in about 2.5 min. The AGPM's
minimalistic design can be easily adapted to circuit boards, making the concept
a promising fit for the on-board pressure supply of soft robots.

<i>Arturo Rodríguez-Sota, Vishesh Saxena, Jonas Spethmann, Roland Wiesendanger, Roberto Lo Conte, André Kubetzka, Kirsten von Bergmann</i>
<p>Clusters supported by solid substrates are prime candidates for heterogeneous
catalysis and can be prepared in various ways. While mass-selected soft-landing
methods are often used for the generation of monodisperse particles,
self-assembly typically leads to a range of different cluster sizes. Here we
show by scanning tunneling microscopy measurements that in the initial stages
of growth Mn forms trimers on a close-packed hexagonal Ir surface, providing a
route for self-organized monodisperse cluster formation on an isotropic
metallic surface. For an increasing amount of Mn, first a phase with
reconstructed monolayer islands is formed, until at full coverage a
pseudomorphic Mn phase evolves which is the most densely packed one of the
three different observed Mn phases on Ir(111). The magnetic state of both the
reconstructed islands and the pseudomorphic film is found to be the
prototypical antiferromagnetic N\'eel state with 120{\deg} spin rotation
between all nearest neighbors in the hexagonal layer.

<br>
<i>D. Krychowski, S. Lipiński</i>
<p>We investigate two equivalent capacitively and tunnel coupled quantum dots,
each coupled to its own pair of leads. Local Holstein type electron-phonon
coupling at the dots is assumed. To study many-body effects we use the finite-U
mean-field slave boson approach. For vanishing interdot interaction, weak e-ph
coupling and finite tunneling, molecular orbital spin Kondo effects occur for
single electron or single hole occupations. Phonons influence both correlations
and tunneling and additionally they shift the energies of the dots. Depending
on the dot energies and the strength of electron-phonon coupling, the system is
occupied by a different number of electrons that effectively interact with each
other repulsively or attractively leading to a number of different ground
states of DQD. Among them are Kondo-like states with spin, orbital or charge
correlations resulting from polaron cotunneling processes and states with
magnetic intersite correlations.

<p>Spinodal decomposition can improve a number of essential properties in
materials, especially hardness. Yet, the theoretical prediction of the onset of
this phenomenon (e.g., temperature) and its microstructure (e.g., wavelength)
often requires input parameters coming from costly and time-consuming
experimental efforts, hindering rational materials optimization. Here, we
present a procedure where such parameters are not derived from experiments.
First, we calculate the spinodal temperature by modeling nucleation in the
solid solution while approaching the spinode boundary. Then, we compute the
spinodal wavelength self-consistently using a few reasonable approximations.
Our results show remarkable agreement with experiments and, for NiRh, the
calculated yield strength due to spinodal microstructures surpasses even those
of Ni-based superalloys. We believe that this procedure will accelerate the
exploration of the complex materials experiencing spinodal decomposition,
critical for their macroscopic properties.

<p>The current density-voltage characteristic (JV) is a critical tool for
understanding the behaviour of solar cells. In this article, we present an
overview of the key aspects of JV analysis and introduce a user-friendly
flowchart that facilitates the swift identification of the most probable

light-intensity-dependent JV measurements. The flowchart was developed through
extensive drift-diffusion simulations and a rigorous review of the literature,
with a specific focus on perovskite and organic solar cells. Moreover, the
flowchart proposes supplementary experiments that can be conducted to obtain a
more precise prediction of the primary performance losses. It therefore serves
as an optimal starting point to analyse performance losses of solar cells.

<i>Urmimala Dey, Mark S. Senn, Nicholas C. Bristowe</i>
<p>Type-II multiferroics, in which the magnetic order breaks inversion symmetry,
are appealing for both fundamental and applied research due their intrinsic
coupling between magnetic and electrical orders. Using first-principles
calculations we study the ground state magnetic behaviour of
Ba$_7$Mn$_4$O$_{15}$ which has been classified as a type-II multiferroic in
recent experiments. Our constrained moment calculations with the proposed
experimental magnetic structure shows the spontaneous emergence of a polar mode
giving rise to an electrical polarisation comparable to other known type-II
multiferroics. When the constraints on the magnetic moments are removed, the
spins self-consistently relax into a canted antiferromagnetic ground state
configuration where two magnetic modes transforming as distinct irreducible
representations coexist. While the dominant magnetic mode matches well with the
previous experimental observations, the second mode is found to possess a
different character resulting in a non-polar ground state. Interestingly, the
non-polar magnetic ground state exhibits a significantly strong linear
magnetoelectric coupling comparable to the well-known multiferroic BiFeO$_3$,
suggesting strategies to design new linear magnetoelectrics.

<i>Kotaro Shimizu, Vinicius Yu Okubo, Rose Knight, Ziyuan Wang, Joseph Burton, Hae Yong Kim, Gia-Wei Chern, B. S. Shivaram</i>
<p>We present a comprehensive approach to characterizing labyrinthine structures
that often emerge as a final steady state in pattern forming systems. We employ
machine learning based pattern recognition techniques to identify the types and
locations of topological defects of the local stripe ordering to augment
conventional Fourier analysis. A pair distribution function analysis of the
topological defects reveals subtle differences between labyrinthine structures
which are beyond the conventional characterization methods. We utilize our
approach to highlight a clear morphological transition between two zero-field
labyrinthine structures in single crystal Bi substituted Yttrium Iron Garnet
films. An energy landscape picture is proposed to understand the athermal
dynamics that governs the observed morphological transition. Our work
demonstrates that machine learning based recognition techniques enable novel
studies of rich and complex labyrinthine type structures universal to many
pattern formation systems.

<h3>Fluctuation-induced currents in suspended graphene nanoribbons:  Adiabatic quantum pumping approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10560" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10560</a>
<br>
<i>Federico D. Ribetto, Silvina A. Elaskar, Hernán L. Calvo, Raúl A. Bustos-Marún</i>
<p>Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are thin strips of graphene with unique
properties due to their structure and nanometric dimensions. They stand out as
basic components for the construction of different types of
nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), including some very promising sensors and
pumps. However, various phenomena, such as unintended mechanical vibrations,
can induce undesired electrical currents in these devices. Here, we take a
quantum mechanical approach to analyze how currents induced by fluctuations
(either thermal or of some other kind) in suspended GNRs contribute to the
electric current. In particular, we study the pumping current induced by the
adiabatic variation of the Hamiltonian of the system when a transverse
vibration (flexural mode) of a GNR suspended over a gate is excited. Our
theoretical approach and results provide useful tools and rules of thumb to
understand and control the charge current induced by fluctuations in GNR-based
NEMS, which is important for their applications in nanoscale sensors, pumps,
and energy harvesting devices.

<h3>Kondo effect in the isotropic Heisenberg spin chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10569" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10569</a>
<br>
<i>Pradip Kattel, Parameshwar R. Pasnoori, J. H. Pixley, Patrick Azaria, Natan Andrei</i>
<p>We investigate the boundary effects that arise when spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
impurities interact with the edges of the antiferromagnetic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
Heisenberg chain through spin exchange interactions. We consider both cases
when the couplings are ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic. We find that in the
case of antiferromagnetic interaction, when the impurity coupling strength is
much weaker than that in the bulk, the impurity is screened in the ground state
via the Kondo effect. The Kondo phase is characterized by the Lorentzian
density of states and dynamically generated Kondo temperature $T_K$. As the
impurity coupling strength increases, $T_K$ increases until it reaches its
maximum value $T_0=2\pi J$ which is the maximum energy carried by a single
spinon. When the impurity coupling strength is increased further, we enter
another phase, the bound mode phase, where the impurity is screened in the
ground state by a single particle bound mode exponentially localized at the
edge to which the impurity is coupled. We find that the impurity can be
unscreened by removing the bound mode. There exists a boundary eigenstate phase
transition between the Kondo and the bound-mode phases, a transition which is
characterized by the change in the number of towers of the Hilbert space. The
transition also manifests itself in ground state quantities like local impurity
density of states and the local impurity magnetization. When the impurity
coupling is ferromagnetic, the impurity is unscreened in the ground state;
however, when the absolute value of the ratio of the impurity and bulk coupling
strengths is greater than $\frac{4}{5}$, the impurity can be screened by adding
a bound mode that costs energy greater than $T_0$. When two impurities are
considered, the phases exhibited by each impurity remain unchanged in the
thermodynamic limit, but nevertheless the system exhibits a rich phase diagram.

<h3>Searching for activated transitions in complex magnetic systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10584" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10584</a>
<br>
<i>H. Bocquet, P. M. Derlet</i>
<p>The process of finding activated transitions in localized spin systems with
continuous degrees of freedom is developed based on a magnetic variant of the
Activation-Relaxation Technique (mART). In addition to the description of the
method and the relevant local properties of the magnetic energy landscape, a
criterion to efficiently recognize failed attempts and an expression for the
step magnitude to control the convergence are proposed irrespective of the
physical system under study. The present implementation is validated on two
translational symmetric systems with isotropic exchange interactions. Then, in
one example, diffusion processes of a skyrmion vacancy and a skyrmion
interstitial are revealed for a skyrmion system on a square spin lattice. In
another example, the set of activation events about a metastable state of a 2D
dipolar spin glass is investigated and the corresponding energy barrier
distribution is found. Detailed inspection of the transition states reveals the
participation of nearest neighbour pairs affording a simplified analytical
understanding.

<h3>Towards quantitative Low Energy Ion Scattering on CaSiO$_3$ from  Comparison to Multiple-Scattering-Resolved Dynamical Binary Collision  Approximation Simulations</h3>

<i>Johannes Brötzner, Lukas Kalchgruber, Paul S. Szabo, Andreas Nenning, Andreas Mutzke, Hans Hofsäss, Markus Valtiner, Richard A. Wilhelm</i>
<p>We perform Low Energy Ion Scattering with 1\,keV He ions on CaSiO$_3$ using a
commercial electrostatic detector system and determine the charge fraction of
scattered ions from comparison with Binary Collision Approximation simulations.
The simulations take dynamical surface changes due to surface cleaning Ar
sputtering into account and scattered He particles are separated into single,
dual, and multiple scattering trajectories. We find that the charge fraction of
single and dual scattered He is about 10 times higher than the one for multiple
collisions. Our results show that quantitative concentration profiles can be
inferred from this method, if the charge fraction components are determined
first.

<h3>Revealing the Charge Density Wave Proximity Effect in Graphene on  1T-TaS$_2$</h3>

<i>Nikhil Tilak, Michael Altvater, Sheng-Hsiung Hung, Choong-Jae Won, Guohong Li, Taha Kaleem, Sang-Wook Cheong, Chung-Hou Chung, Horng-Tay Jeng, Eva Y. Andrei</i>
<p>The proximity-effect, a phenomenon whereby materials in close contact
appropriate each others electronic-properties, is widely used in nano-scale
devices to induce electron-correlations at heterostructure interfaces. Layered
group-V transition metal dichalcogenides host charge density waves and are
expected to induce CDWs in a thin proximal 2D metal such as graphene. Thus far,
however, the extremely large density of states of the TMDs compared to graphene
have precluded efforts to unambiguously prove such proximity induced charge
density waves (CDW). Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and
spectroscopy (STS), we report the first conclusive evidence of a CDW proximity
effect between graphene and the commensurate CDW in 1T-TaS$_2$ (TaS$_2$ for
brevity). We exploit the Mott gap of 1T-TaS$_2$ to scan the sample at bias
voltages wherein only the graphene layer contributes to the STM topography
scans. Furthermore, we observe that graphene modifies the band structure at the
surface of TaS$_2$, by providing mid-gap carriers and reducing the strength of
electron correlations there. We show that the mechanism underlying the
proximity induced CDW is well-described by short-range exchange interactions
that are distinctly different from previously observed proximity effects.

<h3>Bacterial diffusion in disordered media, by forgetting the media</h3>

<br>
<i>Henry H. Mattingly</i>
<p>We study bacterial diffusion in disordered porous media. Interactions with
obstacles, at unknown locations, make this problem challenging. We approach it
by abstracting the environment to cell states with memoryless transitions. With
this, we derive an effective diffusivity that agrees well with simulations in
explicit geometries. The diffusivity is non-monotonic, and we solve the optimal
run length. We also find a rescaling that causes all of the theory and
simulations to collapse. Our results indicate that a small set of microscopic
features captures bacterial diffusion in disordered media.

<h3>Discrete step walks reveal unconventional anomalous topology in  synthetic photonic lattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10619" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10619</a>
<br>
<i>Rabih El Sokhen, Álvaro Gómez-León, Albert F. Adiyatullin, Stéphane Randoux, Pierre Delplace, Alberto Amo</i>
<p>Anomalous topological phases, where edge states coexist with topologically
trivial Chern bands, can only appear in periodically driven lattices. When the
driving is smooth and continuous, the bulk-edge correspondence is guaranteed by
the existence of a bulk invariant known as the winding number. However, in
lattices subject to periodic time-step walks the existence of edge states does
not only depend on bulk invariants but also on the geometry of the boundary.
This is a consequence of the absence of an intrinsic time-dependence or
micromotion in discrete-step walks. We report the observation of edge states
and a simultaneous measurement of the bulk invariants in anomalous topological
phases in a two-dimensional discrete-step walk in a synthetic photonic lattice
made of two coupled fibre rings. The presence of edge states is inherent to the
periodic driving and depends on the geometry of the boundary in the implemented
two-band model with zero Chern number. We provide a suitable expression for the
topological invariants whose calculation does not rely on micromotion dynamics.

<h3>Magnon topological transition in skyrmion crystal</h3>

<br>
<i>V. E. Timofeev, Yu. V. Baramygina, D. N. Aristov</i>
<p>We study the magnon spectrum in skyrmion crystal formed in thin ferromagnetic
films with Dzyalosinskii-Moria interaction in presence of magnetic field.
Focusing on two low-lying observable magnon modes and employing stereographic
projection method, we develop a theory demonstrating a topological transition
in the spectrum. Upon the increase of magnetic field, the gap between two
magnon bands closes, with the ensuing change in the topological character of
both bands. This phenomenon of gap closing, if confirmed in magnetic resonance
experiments, may deserve further investigation by thermal Hall conductivity
experiments.

<h3>Quantum phases of hardcore bosons with repulsive dipolar density-density  interactions on two-dimensional lattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10632" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10632</a>
<br>
<i>J.A. Koziol, G. Morigi, K.P. Schmidt</i>
<p>We analyse the ground-state quantum phase diagram of hardcore Bosons
interacting with repulsive dipolar potentials. The bosons dynamics is described
by the extended-Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian on a two-dimensional lattice. The
ground state results from the interplay between the lattice geometry and the
long-range interactions, which we account for by means of a classical spin
mean-field approach limited by the size of the considered unit cells. This
extended classical spin mean-field theory accounts for the long-range
density-density interaction without truncation. We consider three different
lattice geometries: square, honeycomb, and triangular. In the limit of zero
hopping the ground state is always a devil's staircase of solid (gapped)
phases. Such crystalline phases with broken translational symmetry are robust
with respect to finite hopping amplitudes. At intermediate hopping amplitudes,
these gapped phases melt, giving rise to various lattice supersolid phases,
which can have exotic features with multiple sublattice densities. At
sufficiently large hoppings the ground state is a superfluid. The stability of
phases predicted by our approach is gauged by comparison to the known quantum
phase diagrams of the Bose-Hubbard model with nearest-neighbour interactions as
well as quantum Monte Carlo simulations for the dipolar case on the square
lattice. Our results are of immediate relevance for experimental realisations
of self-organised crystalline ordering patterns in analogue quantum simulators,
e.g., with ultracold dipolar atoms in an optical lattice.

<h3>Aging Dynamics of $d-$dimensional Locally Activated Random Walks</h3>

<br>
<i>Julien Brémont, Theresa Jakuszeit, Olivier Bénichou, Raphael Voituriez</i>
<p>Locally activated random walks are defined as random processes, whose
dynamical parameters are modified upon visits to given activation sites. Such
dynamics naturally emerge in living systems as varied as immune and cancer
cells interacting with spatial heterogeneities in tissues, or at larger scales
animals encountering local resources. At the theoretical level, these random
walks provide an explicit construction of strongly non Markovian, and aging
dynamics. We propose a general analytical framework to determine various
statistical properties characterizing the position and dynamical parameters of
the random walker on $d$-dimensional lattices. Our analysis applies in
particular to both passive (diffusive) and active (run and tumble) dynamics,
and quantifies the aging dynamics and potential trapping of the random walker;
it finally identifies clear signatures of activated dynamics for potential use
in experimental data.

<h3>Critical ultrasonic propagation in magnetic fields</h3>

<br>
<i>A. Pawlak</i>
<p>Effect of an external magnetic field on the critical sound attenuation and
velocity of the longitudinal wave is studied in ferromagnets. We derive a
parametric model that incorporates a crossover from the asymptotic critical
behavior to the Landau-Ginzburg regular behavior far away from the critical
point. The dynamics is based on the time dependent Ginzburg-Landau model with
non conserved order parameter (model A). The variations of the sound
attenuation coefficient and velocity have been obtained for arbitrary values of
the magnetic field and reduced temperature. The scaling functions are given
within the renormalization group formalism at one-loop order. Using MnP as an
example, we show that such parametric crossover model yields an accurate
description of ultrasonic data in a large region of temperatures and magnetic
fields around the critical point.

<p>Single crystals of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ were
grown by means of the floating-zone technique at oxygen pressure of 20~bar. Our
results reveal the effects of the annealing process under pressure on the
crystal structure. We present the requirements for crystal growth and show how
a reported ferromagnetic impurity phase can be avoided. The different growth
and post-annealing processes result in two distinct phases $P2_1/a$ and {\it
Bmab} in which the metal-to-metal transitions occur at 152~K and 136~K,
respectively.

<h3>Phononic dynamical axion in magnetic Dirac insulators</h3>

<br>
<i>M. Nabil Y. Lhachemi, Ion Garate</i>
<p>In cosmology, the axion is a hypothetical particle that is currently
considered as candidate for dark matter. In condensed matter, a counterpart of
the axion (the "axion quasiparticle") has been predicted to emerge in
magnetoelectric insulators with fluctuating magnetic order and in
charge-ordered Weyl semimetals. To date, both the cosmological and
condensed-matter axions remain experimentally elusive or unconfirmed. Here, we
show theoretically that ordinary lattice vibrations can form an axion
quasiparticle in Dirac insulators with broken time- and space-inversion
symmetries, even in the absence of magnetic fluctuations. The physical
manifestation of the phononic axion is a magnetic-field-induced phonon
effective charge, which can be probed in optical spectroscopy. By replacing
magnetic fluctuations with lattice vibrations, our theory widens the scope for
the observability of the axion quasiparticle in condensed matter.

<h3>Fate of the superconducting state in floating islands of hybrid nanowire  devices</h3>

<i>E.V. Shpagina, E.S. Tikhonov, D. Ruhstorfer, G. Koblmueller, V.S. Khrapai</i>
<p>We investigate the impact of transport current on the superconducting order
parameter in superconducting islands in full-shell epitaxial Al-InAs nanowires.
Depending on a device layout, the suppression of superconductivity occurs in
three fundamentally different ways -- by a critical current in the case of
superconducting reservoirs and by a critical voltage or by a critical Joule
power in the case of normal reservoirs. In the latter case, the collapse of the
superconducting state depends on the ratio of the dwell time and the
electron-phonon relaxation time of quasiparticles in the island. For low
resistive and high resistive coupling to the reservoirs, respectively, the
relaxation-free regime and the strong electron-phonon relaxation regime are
realized. Our results shed light on potential shortcomings of finite-bias
transport spectroscopy in floating islands.

<i>E. J. A. Santos, K. A. L. Lima, L. A. Ribeiro Junior</i>
<p>The class of 2D carbon allotropes has garnered significant attention due to
its exceptional optoelectronic and mechanical properties, crucial for diverse
device applications, such as energy storage. This study employs density
functional theory calculations, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and
classical reactive (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to introduce
TODD-Graphene, a novel 2D planar carbon allotrope with a porous structure
composed of 3-8-10-12 carbon rings. TODD-G exhibits intrinsic metallic
properties with low formation energy and demonstrates exceptional dynamic,
thermal, and mechanical stability. Calculations reveal a high theoretical
capacity for adsorbing Li atoms by showing a low average diffusion barrier of
0.83 eV and a metallic framework boasting excellent conductivity, emerging as a
promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries. We also calculated the
charge carrier mobility for electrons and holes in TOOD-G, and the values
surpassed the graphene ones. Classical reactive MD simulation results suggested
its structural integrity with no bond reconstructions at 1800 K.

<br>
<i>Julian Arnold, Niels Lörch, Flemming Holtorf, Frank Schäfer</i>
<p>Despite the widespread use and success of machine-learning techniques for
detecting phase transitions from data, their working principle and fundamental
limits remain elusive. Here, we explain the inner workings and identify
potential failure modes of these techniques by rooting popular machine-learning
indicators of phase transitions in information-theoretic concepts. Using tools
from information geometry, we prove that several machine-learning indicators of
phase transitions approximate the square root of the system's (quantum) Fisher
information from below -- a quantity that is known to indicate phase
transitions but is often difficult to compute from data. We numerically
demonstrate the quality of these bounds for phase transitions in classical and
quantum systems.
