<h3>Spatiotemporal patterning of extensile active stresses in  microtubule-based active fluids</h3>

<br>
Active stresses, which are collectively generated by the motion of
energy-consuming rod-like constituents, generate chaotic autonomous flows.
Controlling active stresses in space and time is an essential prerequisite for
controlling the intrinsically chaotic dynamics of extensile active fluids. We
design single-headed kinesin molecular motors that exhibit optically enhanced
clustering, and thus enable precise and repeatable spatial and temporal control
of extensile active stresses. Such motors enable rapid, reversible switching
between flowing and quiescent states. In turn, spatio-temporal patterning of
the active stress controls the evolution of the ubiquitous bend-instability of
extensile active fluids and determines its critical length dependence.
Combining optically controlled clusters with conventional kinesin motors
enables one-time switching from contractile to extensile active stresses. These
results open a path towards real-time control of the autonomous flows generated
by active fluids.

Quantum heat engines form an active field of research due to their potential
applications. There are several phenomena that are unique to the quantum
regime, some of which are known to give these engines an edge over their
classical counterparts. In this work, we focus on the study of one and
two-qubit finite-time Otto engines interacting with squeezed thermal baths, and
discuss their important distinctions as well as the advantage of using the
two-qubit engine. In particular, the two-qubit engine offers an interesting
study of the interplay between the degree of squeezing and that of the
coherence between the two qubits. We find that the two-qubit engine generally
yields higher power than its one-qubit counterpart. The effective temperature
of the squeezed baths can be calculated both for the one and two-qubit engines,
and they tend to show an exponential growth with increase in squeezing
parameters $r_h$ and $r_c$. It is also observed that by tuning the squeezing
parameters, the machine can be made to work either in the engine or in the
refrigerator mode. Additional effects due to the change in the inter-qubit
separation have been studied.

<h3>Moiré Engineering and Topological Flat Bands in Twisted Orbital-Active  Bilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06524" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06524</a>

<br>
Topological flat bands at the Fermi level offer a promising platform to study
a variety of intriguing correlated phase of matter. Here we present band
engineering in the twisted orbital-active bilayers with spin-orbit coupling.
The symmetry constraints on the interlayer coupling that determines the
effective potential for low-energy physics of moir\'e electrons are
exhaustively derived for two-dimensional point groups. We find the line graph
or biparticle sublattice of moir\'e pattern emerge with a minimal $C_3$
symmetry, which exhibit isolated electronic flat bands with nontrivial
topology. The band flatness is insensitive to the twist angle since they come
from the interference effect. Armed with this guiding principle, we predict
that twisted bilayers of 2H-PbS$_2$ and CdS realize the salient physics to
engineer two-dimensional topological quantum phases. At small twist angles,
PbS$_2$ heterostructures give rise to an emergent moir\'e Kagom\'e lattice,
while CdS heterostructures lead to an emergent moir\'e honeycomb lattice, and
both of them host moir\'e quantum spin Hall insulators with almost flat
topological bands. We further study superconductivity of these two systems with
local attractive interactions. The superfluid weight and
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature are determined by multiband
processes and quantum geometry of the band in the flat-band limit when the
pairing potential exceeds the band width. Our results demonstrate twisted
bilayers with multi-orbitals as a promising tunable platform to realize
correlated topological phases.

<br>
Connecting the large-scale emergent behaviors of active materials to the
microscopic properties of their constituents is a challenge due to a lack of
data on the multiscale dynamics and structure of such systems. We approach this
problem by studying the impact of polyethylene glycol, a crowding agent, on
bundles of microtubules and kinesin-14 molecular motors. Bundles assembled in
the presence of either low or high concentrations of polyethylene glycol
generate similar net extensile behaviors. However, as polyethylene glycol
concentration is increased, the motion of microtubules in the bundles
transition from bi-directional sliding with extension to pure extension with no
sliding. Small-angle X-ray scattering shows that the transition in microtubule
dynamics is concomitant with a rearrangement of microtubules in the bundles
from an open hexagonal to a compressed rectangular lattice. These results
demonstrate that bundles of microtubules and molecular motors can display
similar mesoscopic extensile behaviors despite having very different internal
structures and dynamics.

<h3>Flocking in One Dimension: Asters and Reversals</h3>

<br>
We study the one-dimensional active Ising model in which aligning particles
undergo diffusion biased by the signs of their spins. The phase diagram
obtained varying the density of particles, their hopping rate and the
temperature controlling the alignment shows a homogeneous disordered phase but
no homogeneous ordered one, as well as two phases with localized dense
structures. In the flocking phase, large ordered aggregates move ballistically
and stochastically reverse their direction of motion. In what we termed the
"aster" phase, dense immobile aggregates of opposite magnetization face each
other, exchanging particles, without any net motion of the aggregates. Using a
combination of numerical simulations and mean-field theory, we study the
evolution of the shapes of the flocks, the statistics of their reversal times,
and their coarsening dynamics. Solving exactly for the zero-temperature
dynamics of an aster allows us to understand their coarsening, which shows
extremal dynamics, while mean-field equations account for their shape.

<h3>Tuning magnetoelectricity in a mixed-anisotropy antiferromagnet</h3>

Sørensen, Sebastian Paeckel, Kasper S. Pedersen, Rasmus E. Hansen, Alexandre Pages, Kimmie K. Moerner, Giulia Meucci, Jian-Rui Soh, Alessandro Bombardi, David Vaknin, Henrik. M. Rønnow, Olav F. Syljuåsen, Niels B. Christensen, Rasmus Toft-Petersen</i>
<br>
Control of magnetization and electric polarization is attractive in relation
to tailoring materials for data storage and devices such as sensors or
antennae. In magnetoelectric materials, these degrees of freedom are closely
coupled, allowing polarization to be controlled by a magnetic field, and
magnetization by an electric field, but the magnitude of the effect remains a
challenge in the case of single-phase magnetoelectrics for application. We
demonstrate that the magnetoelectric properties of the mixed-anisotropy
antiferromagnet LiNi$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$PO$_4$ are profoundly affected by replacing a
fraction of the Ni$^{2+}$ ions with Fe$^{2+}$ on the transition metal site.
This introduces random site-dependent single-ion anisotropy energies and causes
a lowering of the magnetic symmetry of the system. In turn, magnetoelectric
couplings that are symmetry-forbidden in the parent compounds, LiNiPO$_4$ and
LiFePO$_4$, are unlocked and the dominant coupling is enhanced by two orders of
magnitude. Our results demonstrate the potential of mixed-anisotropy magnets
for tuning magnetoelectric properties.

<h3>Picosecond Time-Scale Resistive Switching Monitored in Real-Time</h3>

The resistance state of filamentary memristors can be tuned by relocating
only a few atoms at interatomic distances in the active region of a conducting
filament. Thereby the technology holds promise not only in its ultimate
downscaling potential and energy efficiency but also in unprecedented speed.
Yet, the breakthrough in high-frequency applications still requires the
clarification of the dominant mechanisms and inherent limitations of ultra-fast
resistive switching. Here we investigate bipolar, multilevel resistive
switchings in tantalum pentoxide based memristors with picosecond time
resolution. We experimentally demonstrate cyclic resistive switching operation
due to 20 ps long voltage pulses of alternating polarity. Through the analysis
of the real-time response of the memristor we find that the set switching can
take place at the picosecond time-scale where it is only compromised by the
bandwidth limitations of the experimental setup. In contrast, the completion of
the reset transitions significantly exceeds the duration of the ultra-short
voltage bias, demonstrating the dominant role of thermal diffusion and
underlining the importance of dedicated thermal engineering for future
high-frequency memristor circuit applications.

<h3>Field Induced Chiral Soliton Phase in the Kitaev Spin Chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06221" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06221</a>
<br>
<i>Erik S. Sørensen, Jacob Gordon, Jonathon Riddell, Tianyi Wang, Hae-Young Kee</i>
<br>
The bond-dependent Ising interaction present in the Kitaev model has
attracted considerable attention. The appearance of an unexpected intermediate
phase under a magnetic field is particularly intriguing, and one may wonder if
a similar phase occurs in the Kitaev spin chain with alternating $x$- and
$y$-bond Ising interactions. Previous studies have focused on a transverse
field, $h_z$, and reported a direct transition to the polarized state. Here, we
investigate phases with arbitrary angle of two longitudinal fields, $h_x$ and
$h_y$. For a magnetic field applied along the diagonal, $h_x$=$h_y$, the chain
remains gapless up to a critical field $h^{c_1}_{xy}$. Surprisingly, above
$h^{c1}_{xy}$ it enters an unusual intermediate phase before reaching the
polarized state at $h^{c_2}_{xy}$. This phase is characterized by a staggered
vector chirality and for periodic boundary conditions, a two-fold degeneracy
with a finite gap. For open boundary systems the ground-state exhibits a single
soliton, lowering the energy, and gapless excitations. However, the
corresponding anti-soliton raises the energy sufficiently that a gap appears
for soliton and anti-soliton pairs in periodic systems. An intuitive
variational picture is developed describing the soliton phase.

<h3>Emergence of mesoscale quantum phase transitions in a ferromagnet</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06224" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06224</a>
<br>
<i>Andreas Wendl, Heike Eisenlohr, Felix Rucker, Christopher Duvinage, Markus Kleinhans, Matthias Vojta, Christian Pfleiderer</i>
<br>
Mesoscale patterns as observed, e.g., in ferromagnets, ferroelectrics,
superconductors, mono-molecular films, or block-copolymers, reflect spatial
variations of a pertinent order parameter at length- and time-scales that may
be described classically. This raises the question for the relevance of
mesoscale patterns near zero temperature phase transitions, also known as
quantum phase transitions (QPTs). Here we report the magnetic susceptibility of
LiHoF$_4$ -- a dipolar Ising ferromagnet -- near a well-understood
transverse-field quantum critical point (TF-QCP). When tilting the magnetic
field away from the hard axis such that the Ising symmetry is always broken, a
line of well-defined phase transitions emerges from the TF-QCP characteristic
of an additional symmetry breaking, in stark contrast to a crossover expected
microscopically. We show that a continuous suppression of ferromagnetic
domains, representing a breaking of translation symmetry on mesoscopic scales
in an environment of broken magnetic Ising symmetry on microscopic scales, is
in excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement with the field- and
temperature dependence of the susceptibility and the magnetic phase diagram of
LiHoF$_4$ under tilted field. This identifies a new type of phase transition
that may be referred to as mesocale quantum criticality, which emanates from
the text-book example of a microscopic ferromagnetic TF-QCP. Our results
establish the surroundings of QPTs as a regime of mesoscale pattern formation,
where non-analytical quantum dynamics and materials properties without
classical analogue may be expected.

<h3>Thermal interferometry of anyons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06234" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06234</a>
<br>
<i>Zezhu Wei, Navketan Batra, V. F. Mitrović, D. E. Feldman</i>
<br>
Anyonic interferometry probes the braiding phases of excitations in
topologically ordered matter. This technique is well established for charged
quasiparticles in the fractional quantum Hall effect. We propose to extend it
to neutral anyons, such as Ising anyons in Kitaev magnets and quasiparticles in
other neutral spin liquids. We find that the thermal current through an
interferometer is sensitive to the statistics of tunneling quasiparticles. We
present a systematic investigation of signatures of various Abelian and
non-Abelian topological orders in Fabry-P\'erot and Mach-Zehnder
interferemeters. Furthermore, we identify another probe of topological order
that involves the scaling of the thermal current through a single tunneling
contact at low temperatures. The current shows a universal temperature
dependence, sensitive to the topological order in the system.

<h3>Design of Core-Shell Structured Magnetic Microwires with Desirable  Properties for Multifunctional Applications</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06238" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06238</a>

<br>
Amorphous Co-rich microwires with excellent soft magnetic and mechanical
properties produced by melt-extraction technique are emerging as a
multifunctional material for a variety of applications ranging from
ultrasensitive magnetic field sensors to structural health self-monitoring
composites. There is a pressing need for enhancing these properties to make the
microwires practical for integration into new technologies. Conventional heat
treatments at temperature below crystallization may improve the magnetic
softness of an as-quenched amorphous wire, but usually deteriorate the good
mechanical characteristic of the wire due to crystallization. To overcome this,
we propose a new approach that utilizes the advantages of a multi-step Joule
current annealing method to design novel (nanocrystal, amorphous)/amorphous
core/shell structures directly from as-quenched amorphous microwires. These
results show that the density and size of nanocrystals in the core can be
optimized by controlling the Joule current intensity, resulting in the large
enhancement of soft magnetic and giant magneto-impedance properties, while the
amorphous shell preserves the excellent mechanical strength of the microwire.
This study also provides a new pathway for the design of novel core/shell
structures directly from rapidly quenched amorphous magnetic materials that are
currently exploited in high frequency transformers, sensing and cooling
devices.

<h3>Critical and Topological Phases of Dimerized Kitaev Chain in Presence of  Quasiperiodic Potential</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06255" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06255</a>
<br>
<i>Shilpi Roy, Sk Noor Nabi, Saurabh Basu</i>
<br>
We investigate localization and topological properties of a dimerized Kitaev
chain with p-wave superconducting correlations and a quasiperiodically
modulated chemical potential. With regard to the localization studies, we
demonstrate the existence of distinct phases, such as, the extended phase, the
critical (intermediate) phase, and the localized phase that arise due to the
competition between the dimerization and the onsite quasiperiodic potential.
Most interestingly, the critical phase comprises of two different mobility
edges that are found to exist between the extended to the localized phase, and
between the critical (multifractal) and localized phases. We perform our
analysis employing the inverse and the normalized participation ratios, fractal
dimension, and the level spacing. Subsequently, a finite-size analysis is done
to provide support of our findings. Furthermore, we study the topological
properties of the zero-energy edge modes via computing the real-space winding
number and number of the Majorana zero modes present in the system. We
specifically illustrate that our model exhibits a phase transition from a
topologically trivial to a non-trivial phase (topological Anderson phase)
beyond a critical dimerization strength under the influence of the
quasiperiodic potential strength. Finally, in presence of a large potential, we
demonstrate that the system undergoes yet another transition from the
topologically non-trivial to an Anderson localized phase. Thus, we believe that
our results will aid exploration of fundamentally different physics pertaining
to the critical and the topological Anderson phases.

<h3>Simulations of Heat Transport in Single-Molecule Junctions:  Investigations of the Thermal Diode Effect</h3>

<br>
With the objective to understand microscopic principles governing thermal
energy flow in nanojunctions, we study phononic heat transport through
metal-molecule-metal junctions using classical molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations. Considering a single-molecule gold-alkanedithiol-gold junction, we
first focus on aspects of method development and compare two techniques for
calculating thermal conductance: (i) The Reverse Nonequilibrium MD (RNEMD)
method, where heat is inputted and extracted at a constant rate from opposite
metals. In this case, the thermal conductance is calculated from the
nonequilibrium temperature profile that is created on the junction. (ii) The
Approach-to-Equilibrium MD (AEMD) method, with the thermal conductance of the
junction obtained from the equilibration dynamics of the metals. In both
methods, simulations of alkane chains of growing size display an approximate
length-independence of the thermal conductance, with calculated values matching
computational and experimental studies. The RNEMD and AEMD methods offer
different insights on thermal transport, and we discuss their relative benefits
and shortcomings. Assessing the potential application of molecular junctions as
thermal diodes, the alkane junctions are made spatially asymmetric by modifying
their contact regions with the bulk, either by using distinct endgroups or by
replacing one of the Au contacts by Ag. Anharmonicity is built into the system
within the molecular force-field. Using the RNEMD method, we show that, while
the temperature profile strongly varies (compared to the
gold-alkanedithiol-gold junctions) due to these structural modifications, the
thermal diode effect is inconsequential in these systems -- unless one goes to
very large thermal biases. This finding suggests that one should seek molecules
with considerable internal anharmonic effects for developing nonlinear thermal
devices.

Emulsions often act as carriers for water-insoluble solutes that are
delivered to a specific target. The molecular transport of solutes in emulsions
can be facilitated by surfactants and is often limited by diffusion through the
continuous phase. We here investigate this transport on a molecular scale by
using a lipophilic molecular rotor as a proxy for solutes. Using fluorescence
lifetime microscopy we track the transport of these molecules from the
continuous phase towards the dispersed phase in polydisperse oil-in-water
emulsions. We show that this transport comprises two timescales, which vary
significantly with droplet size and surfactant concentration, and, depending on
the type of surfactant used, can be limited either by transport across the
oil-water interface, or by diffusion through the continuous phase. By studying
the time-resolved fluorescence of the fluorophore, accompanied by molecular
dynamics simulations, we demonstrate how the rate of transport observed on a
macroscopic scale can be explained in terms of the local environment that the
probe molecules are exposed to.

Explicit simulations of fluid mixtures of highly size-dispersed particles are
constrained by numerical challenges associated with identifying
pair-interaction neighbors. Recent algorithmic developments have ameliorated
these difficulties to an extent, permitting more efficient simulations of
systems with many large and small particles of disperse sizes. We leverage
these capabilities to perform molecular dynamics simulations of binary sphere
mixtures with elastically stiff particles approaching the hard sphere limit and
particle size ratios of up to 50, approaching the colloidal limit. The systems
considered consist of 500 large particles and up to nearly 3.6 million small
particles with total particle volume fractions up to 0.51. Our simulations
confirm qualitative predictions for correlations between large particles
previously obtained analytically and for simulations employing effective
depletion interactions, but also reveal additional insights into the
near-contact structure that result from the explicit treatment of the small
particle solvent. No spontaneous crystal nucleation was observed during the
simulations, suggesting that nucleation rates in the fluid-solid coexistence
region are too small to observe crystal nucleation for feasible simulation
system sizes and timescales.

Transient X-ray spectroscopies have become ubiquitous in studying
photoexcited dynamics in solar energy materials due to their sensitivity to
carrier occupations and local chemical or structural dynamics. The
interpretation of solid-state photoexcited dynamics, however, is complicated by
the core-hole perturbation and the resulting many-body dynamics. Here, an ab
initio, Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) approach is developed that can
incorporate photoexcited state effects for solid-state materials. The extreme
ultraviolet (XUV) absorption spectra for the ground, photoexcited, and
thermally expanded states of first row transition metal oxides - $TiO_2,
\alpha-Cr_2O_3, \beta-MnO_2, \alpha-Fe_2O_3, Co_3O_4, NiO, CuO, and ZnO$ - are
calculated to demonstrate the accuracy of this approach. The theory is used to
decompose the core-valence excitons into the separate components of the X-ray
transition Hamiltonian for each of the transition metal oxides investigated.
The decomposition provides a physical intuition about the origins of XUV
spectral features as well as how the spectra will change following
photoexcitation. The method is easily generalized to other K, L, M, and N edges
to provide a general approach for analyzing transient X-ray absorption or
reflection data.

Hermitian topological materials are characterized by the nontrivial relation
between topological numbers and edge modes, i.e. the bulk-boundary
correspondence. In non-Hermitian systems, the conventional correspondence
breaks down. Instead, in the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, the
non-Bloch bulk-boundary correspondence, which is the relation between the
non-Bloch winding number and the non-Hermitian skin effect, is proposed by S.
Yao and Z. Wang. We introduce the non-Bloch polarization as a topological
quantity to detect the non-Hermitian skin effect. Moreover, we also discuss the
non-Bloch bulk-boundary correspondence in two-dimensional systems using the
non-Bloch polarization with spiral boundary conditions.

<h3>A multi-fragment real-time extension of projected density matrix  embedding theory: Non-equilibrium electron dynamics in extended systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06368" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06368</a>
<br>
<i>D. Yehorova, Joshua S. Kretchmer</i>
<br>
In this work, we derive a multi-fragment real-time extension of projected
density matrix embedding theory (pDMET) designed to treat non-equilibrium
electron dynamics in strongly correlated systems. As in the previously
developed static pDMET, real time pDMET partitions the total system into many
fragments; the coupling between each fragment and the rest of the system is
treated through a compact representation of the environment in terms of a
quantum bath. Real-time pDMET involves simultaneously propagating the
wavefunctions for each separate fragment-bath embedding system along with an
auxiliary mean-field wavefunction of the total system. The equations of motion
are derived by \emph{(i)} projecting the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger
equation in the fragment and bath space associated with each separate fragment
and by \emph{(ii)} enforcing the pDMET matching conditions between the global
1-particle reduced density matrix (1-RDM) obtained from the fragment
calculations and the mean-field 1-RDM at all points in time. The accuracy of
the method is benchmarked through comparisons to time-dependent density-matrix
renormalization group (TD-DMRG) and time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory;
the methods were applied to a single-impurity Anderson model and multi-impurity
Anderson models with ordered and disordered distributions of the impurities.
The results demonstrate a large improvement over TDHF and rapid convergence to
the exact dynamics with an increase in fragment size. Our results demonstrate
that real-time pDMET is a promising and flexible method to simulate
non-equilibrium electron dynamics in heterogeneous systems of large size.

The recent discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates
generates tremendous research endeavors, but the ground state of their parent
compounds is still under debate. Here, we report experimental evidences for the
dominant role of Kondo scattering in the underdoped Nd1-xSrxNiO2 thin films. A
resistivity minimum associated with logarithmic temperature dependence in both
longitudinal and Hall resistivities are observed in the underdoped Nd1-xSrxNiO2
samples before the superconducting transition. A linear scaling behavior
$\sigma_{xy}^{AHE}\sim\sigma_{xx}$ between anomalous Hall conductivity
$\sigma_{xy}^{AHE}$ and conductivity $\sigma_{xx}$ is revealed, verifying the
dominant Kondo scattering at low temperature. The effect of weak
(anti-)localization is found to be secondary. Our experiments can help
clarifying the basic physics in the underdoped Nd1-xSrxNiO2 infinite-layer thin
films.

The present paper is dedicated to the structural study of crystallographic
peculiarities appearing in epitaxial films of metastable epsilon iron oxide
($\varepsilon$-Fe$_2$O$_3$) grown by pulsed laser deposition onto a
semiconductor GaN (0001) substrate. The columnar structure of the nanoscale
$\varepsilon$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ films has been for the first time investigated using
high resolution electron microscopy (HRTEM) direct space technique complemented
by reciprocal space methods of high-energy electron diffraction and
color-enhanced HRTEM image Fourier filtering. The study of
$\varepsilon$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ / GaN interface formation has been further expanded
by carrying out a depth resolved analysis of density and chemical composition
by neutron reflectometry and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The obtained
results shed light onto the properties and the origin of the enigmatic
few-nanometer thick low density transition layer residing at the
$\varepsilon$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ / GaN interface. A detailed knowledge of the
properties of this layer is believed to be highly important for the development
of $\varepsilon$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ / GaN heterostructures that can potentially become
part of the iron-oxide based ferroic-on-semiconductor devices with room

We theoretically study the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect in novel
(111)-oriented magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) with SrTiO$_{3}$ barriers,
Co/SrTiO$_{3}$/Co(111) and Ni/SrTiO$_{3}$/Ni(111). Our analysis combining the
first-principles calculation and the Landauer formula shows that the Co-based
MTJ has a high TMR ratio over 500%, while the Ni-based MTJ has a smaller value
(290%). Since the in-plane lattice periodicity of SrTiO$_{3}$ is about twice as
that of the primitive cell of fcc Co (Ni), the original bands of Co (Ni) are
folded in the $k_x$-$k_y$ plane corresponding to the $ab$-plane of the MTJ
supercell. We find that this band folding gives a half-metallic band structure
in the $\Lambda_1$ state of Co (Ni) and the coherent tunneling of such a
half-metallic $\Lambda_1$ state yields a high TMR ratio. We also reveal that
the difference in the TMR ratio between the Co- and Ni-based MTJs can be
understood by different $s$-orbital weights in the $\Lambda_1$ band at the
Fermi level.

<h3>Magnetization switching in polycrystalline Mn3Sn thin film induced by  self-generated spin-polarized current</h3>

<br>
Electrical manipulation of spins is essential to design state-of-the-art
spintronic devices and commonly relies on the spin current injected from a
second heavy-metal material. The fact that chiral antiferromagnets produce spin
current inspires us to explore the magnetization switching of chiral spins
using self-generated spin torque. Here, we demonstrate the electric switching
of noncollinear antiferromagnetic state in Mn3Sn by observing a crossover from
conventional spin-orbit torque to the self-generated spin torque when
increasing the MgO thickness in Ta/MgO/Mn3Sn polycrystalline films. The spin
current injection from the Ta layer can be controlled and even blocked by
varying the MgO thickness, but the switching sustains even at a large MgO
thickness. Furthermore, the switching polarity reverses when the MgO thickness
exceeds around 3 nm, which cannot be explained by the spin-orbit torque
scenario due to spin current injection from the Ta layer. Evident
current-induced switching is also observed in MgO/Mn3Sn and Ti/Mn3Sn bilayers,
where external injection of spin Hall current to Mn3Sn is negligible. The
inter-grain spin-transfer torque induced by spin-polarized current explains the
experimental observations. Our findings provide an alternative pathway for
electrical manipulation of non-collinear antiferromagnetic state without
resorting to the conventional bilayer structure.

<h3>Quantum critical behaviors and decoherence of weakly coupled quantum  Ising models within an isolated global system</h3>

<br>
We discuss the quantum dynamics of an isolated composite system consisting of
weakly interacting many-body subsystems. We focus on one of the subsystems, S,
and study the dependence of its quantum correlations and decoherence rate on
the state of the weakly-coupled complementary part E, which represents the
environment. As a theoretical laboratory, we consider a composite system made
of two stacked quantum Ising chains, locally and homogeneously weakly coupled.
One of the chains is identified with the subsystem S under scrutiny, and the
other one with the environment E. We investigate the behavior of S at
equilibrium, when the global system is in its ground state, and under
out-of-equilibrium conditions, when the global system evolves unitarily after a
soft quench of the coupling between S and E. When S develops quantum critical
correlations in the weak-coupling regime, the associated scaling behavior
crucially depends on the quantum state of E whether it is characterized by
short-range correlations (analogous to those characterizing disordered phases
in closed systems), algebraically decaying correlations (typical of critical
systems), or long-range correlations (typical of magnetized ordered phases). In
particular, different scaling behaviors, depending on the state of E, are
observed for the decoherence of the subsystem S, as demonstrated by the
different power-law divergences of the decoherence susceptibility that
quantifies the sensitivity of the coherence to the interaction with E.

Recording field ion microscope images under field evaporating conditions and
subsequently reconstructing the underlying atomic configuration, called
three-dimensional field ion microscopy (3D-FIM) is one of the few techniques
capable of resolving crystalline defects at an atomic scale. However, the
quantification of the observed vacancies and their origins are still a matter
of debate. It was suggested that high electric fields (1-5 V/\r{A}) used in
3D-FIM could introduce artefact vacancies. To investigate such effects, we used
density functional theory (DFT) simulations. Stepped Ni and Pt surfaces with
kinks were modelled in the repeated slab approach with a (971) surface
orientation. An electrostatic field of up to 4 V/\r{A} was introduced on one
side of the slab using the generalized dipole correction. Contrary to what was
proposed, we show that the formation of vacancies on the electrified metal
surface is more difficult compared to a field-free case. We also find that the
electric field can introduce kinetic barriers to a potential
vacancy-annihilation mechanism. We rationalize these findings by comparing to
insights from field evaporation models.

<br>
Unitary matrix integrals over symmetric polynomials play an important role in
a wide variety of applications, including random matrix theory, gauge theory,
number theory, and enumerative combinatorics. This paper derives novel results
on such integrals and applies these and other identities to correlation
functions of long-range random walk (LRRW) models. We demonstrate a duality
between distinct LRRW models, which we refer to as quasi-local particle-hole
duality. We then generalize an identity due to Diaconis and Shahshahani which
computes unitary matrix integrals over products of power sum symmetric
polynomials, and derive two novel expressions for unitary matrix integrals over
Schur polynomials which can be directly applied to LRRW correlation functions.
In passing, we demonstrate that going from any (particle-hole) configuration to
another configuration by consecutively moving particles by $n$ steps involves
hopping over either an even or an odd number of particles. In principle, all
results demonstrated in this work can be checked in experimental setups such as
trapped ion systems, where LRRW models appear as an effective description. We
further suggest specific correlation functions which may be applied to the
benchmarking of such experimental setups.

We proposed and theoretically studied a model of two separated spins coupled
to a common bosonic bath. In our SU(2)-symmetric model, the phase transition
point and the stable fixed point representing the nonclassical phase can be
continuously tuned by the distance between the two spins. Thus the fixed point
collision and annihilation (FPCAA) could be achieved by simply changing the
distance. Moreover, we studied in detail variation of the critical value when
the distance is changed. Finally, we also discussed several possible
generalizations of our model which may be worth further studying. Our work is
essential for realization of FPCAA in such systems and paves the way for
studying related physics such as deconfined criticality and quasiuniversality.

The development of fast magnonic information processing nanodevices requires
operating with short spin-wave pulses, but, the shorter the pulses, the more
affected they are by information loss due to broadening and dispersion. The
capability of engineering spin-wave pulses and controlling their propagation
could solve this problem. Here, we provide a method to generate linear
spin-wave pulses with a desired spatial-temporal profile in magnonic waveguides
based on inverse design. As relevant examples, we theoretically predict that
both rectangular and self-compressing spin-wave pulses can be generated in
state-of-the-art waveguides with fidelities >96% using narrow stripline
antennas. The method requires minimal computational overhead and is universal,
i.e., it applies to arbitrary targeted pulse shapes, type of waves (exchange or
dipolar), waveguide materials, and waveguide geometries. It can also be
extended to more complex magnonic structures. Our results could lead to the
utilization of large-scale magnonic circuits for classical and quantum
information processing.

<br>
The efficient control of a large number of qubits is one of most challenging
aspects for practical quantum computing. Current approaches in solid-state
quantum technology are based on brute-force methods, where each and every qubit
requires at least one unique control line, an approach that will become
unsustainable when scaling to the required millions of qubits. Here, inspired
by random access architectures in classical electronics, we introduce the
shared control of semiconductor quantum dots to efficiently operate a
two-dimensional crossbar array in planar germanium. We tune the entire array,
comprising 16 quantum dots, to the few-hole regime and, to isolate an unpaired
spin per dot, we confine an odd number of holes in each site. Moving forward,
we establish a method for the selective control of the quantum dots interdot
coupling and achieve a tunnel coupling tunability over more than 10 GHz. The
operation of a quantum electronic device with fewer control terminals than
tunable experimental parameters represents a compelling step forward in the
construction of scalable quantum technology.

<h3>Universal performance bounds of restart</h3>

<i>Dmitry Starkov, Sergey Belan</i>
<br>
It is widely known that the performance of a probabilistic algorithm
characterized by relatively large runtime fluctuations can be improved by
applying a restart, i.e., episodic interruption of a randomized computational
procedure followed by initialization of its new statistically independent
realization. A similar effect could potentially be possible in the context of
enzymatic reactions, where the dissociation of the enzyme-substrate
intermediate corresponds to restarting the catalytic step of the reaction. To
date, a significant number of analytical results have been obtained regarding
the effect of restart on the statistics of the completion time of stochastic
processes, however, the fundamental limits of restart efficiency remains
unknown. Here we derive statistical inequalities that offer constraints on the
effect that restart could impose on the mean completion time of a generic
stochastic process. The corresponding constraints are expressed via simple
statistical metrics of the original process such as harmonic mean, median value
and mode. We illustrate the analytical results by multiple numerical examples,
discuss implications arising from them and important avenues of future work.

<br>
We show that an ensemble of thermally weakly coupled geometrically frustrated
systems (GFSs), which are constraint to reside at negative Boltzmann
temperatures, is in equilibrium cooler than its constituents, and may even
exhibit positive temperatures at low energies. The challenge for the second law
of thermodynamics arising from potential heat flow related to the Boltzmann
temperature gradient between a GFS and its ensemble is resolved by considering
the energy fluctuations above the ground state, i.e. the most probable state of
a GFS. They are comprised in the canonical temperature, derived from
information theory. Whereas the Boltzmann temperature gradient reveals the
direction of the stochastic drift of the most probable state of a GFS within
its ensemble, canonical temperature gradients define that of heat flow.

<br>
The interface between two-dimensional topological Dirac states and an s-wave
superconductor is expected to support Majorana bound states that can be used
for quantum computing applications. Realizing these novel states of matter and
their applications requires control over superconductivity and spin-orbit
coupling to achieve spin-momentum locked topological surface states which are
simultaneously superconducting. While signatures of Majorana bound states have
been observed in the magnetic vortex cores of bulk FeTe0.55Se0.45,
inhomogeneity and disorder from doping makes these signatures unclear and
inconsistent between vortices. Here we report superconductivity in monolayer
FeTe1-ySey (Fe(Te,Se)) grown on Bi2Te3 by molecular beam epitaxy. Spin and
angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy directly resolve the interfacial spin
and electronic structure of Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 heterostructures. We find that for
y = 0.25 the Fe(Te,Se) electronic structure overlaps with the topological
Bi2Te3 interfacial states which disrupts the desired spin-momentum locking. In
contrast, for y = 0.1 a smaller Fe(Te,Se) Fermi surface allows for clear
spin-momentum locking observed in the topological states. Hence, we demonstrate
the Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 system is a highly tunable platform for realizing Majorana
bound states where reduced doping can improve characteristics important for
Majorana interrogation and potential applications.

<h3>Symmetry-dependent antiferromagnetic proximity effects on valley  splitting</h3>

<br>
Various physical phenomena have been discovered by tuning degrees of freedom,
among which there is the degree of freedom (DOF) -- "valley". The typical
valley materials are characterized by two degenerate valley states protected by
time-reversal symmetry (TS). These states indexed by valley DOF have been
measured and manipulated for emergent valley-contrasting physics with the
broken valley degeneracy. To achieve the valley splitting resulted from TS
breaking, previous studies mainly focused on magnetic proximity effect provided
by ferromagnetic (FM) layer. Nevertheless, the anti-ferromagnetic (AFM)
proximity effect on the valley degeneracy has never been investigated
systematically. In this work, we construct the composites consisting of a
transitionmetal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayer and a proximity layer with
specific intra-plane AFM configurations. We extend the three-band model to
describe the valley states of such systems. It is shown that either
"time-reversal + fractional translation" or "mirror" symmetry has been proved
to protect valley degeneracy. Additionally, first-principles calculations based
on density functional theory (DFT) have been performed to verify the results
obtained from the extended tight-binding (TB) model. The TB method introduced
in the present work can properly describe the low-energy physics of valley
materials that couple to the proximity with complex magnetic configurations.
The results expand the range of qualified proximity layers for valley
splitting, enabling more flexible manipulation of valley degree.

The Hofstadter model exemplifies a large class of physical systems
characterized by particles hopping on a lattice immersed in a gauge field.
Recent advancements on various synthetic platforms have enabled
highly-controllable simulations of such systems with tailored gauge fields
featuring complex spatial textures. These synthetic gauge fields could
introduce synthetic symmetries that do not appear in electronic materials.
Here, in an SU(2) non-Abelian Hofstadter model, we theoretically show the
emergence of multiple nonsymmorphic chiral symmetries, which combine an
internal unitary anti-symmetry with fractional spatial translation. Depending
on the values of the gauge fields, the nonsymmorphic chiral symmetries can
exhibit non-Abelian algebra and protect Kramer quartet states in the bulk band
structure, creating general four-fold degeneracy at all momenta. These
nonsymmorphic chiral symmetries protect double Dirac semimetals at zero energy,
which become gapped into quantum confined insulating phases upon introducing a
boundary. Moreover, the parity of the system size can determine whether the
resulting insulating phase is trivial or topological. Our work indicates a
pathway for creating topology via synthetic symmetries emergent from synthetic
gauge fields.

<br>
We consider finite ribbons of graphene with armchair orientation of their
edges to study in detail impurity effects on specific Dirac-like modes. In the
framework of Anderson hybrid model of impurity perturbation, a possibility for
Mott localization and for opening of a mobility gap under local impurity
perturbations is found and analyzed in function of this model parameters: the
impurity energy level, its hybridization with the host Dirac modes, and the
impurity concentration. Possible electronic phase states in such disordered
system and subsequent phase transitions between them are discussed.

<h3>Half-mirror for electrons on quantum Hall copropagating edge channels</h3>

<br>
A half-mirror that divides a spin-polarized electron into two parallel
copropagating spin-resolved quantum Hall edge channels one half each is
presented in this study. The partition process was coherent, as confirmed by
observing the Aharonov-Bohm oscillation at a high visibility of up to 60% in a
Mach-Zehnder interferometer, which comprised two such half-mirrors. The device
characteristics were highly stable, making the device promising in the
application of quantum information processing. The beam-splitting process is
theoretically modelled, and the numerical simulation successfully reproduces
the experimental observation. The partition of the electron accompanied by the
spin rotation is explained by the angular momentum transfer from the orbital to
the spin via spin-orbit interactions.

The band offsets and the chemical bonding at the interfaces between (-201)
$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and Al$_2$O$_3$ polymorphs are studied through hybrid
functional calculations. For alumina, we consider four representative phases,
i.e., $\alpha$, $\kappa$, $\theta$ and $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$. We generate
realistic slab models for the interfaces which satisfy electron counting rules.
The O atoms bridge the $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and Al$_2$O$_3$ slabs and all the
dangling bonds are saturated. The band offsets are obtained by applying an
alignment scheme which requires separate bulk and interface calculations. The
calculated band offsets are useful for the design of devices based on the
$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/Al$_2$O$_3$heterojunctions, particularly
$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistors.

<h3>Level occupation switching with density functional theory</h3>

<br>
<i>Nahual Sobrino, David Jacob, Stefan Kurth</i>
<br>
The charge transport properties of zero-temperature multi-orbital quantum dot
systems with one dot coupled to leads and the other dots coupled only
capacitatively are studied within density functional theory. It is shown that
the setup is equivalent to an effective single impurity Anderson model. This
allows to understand the level occupation switching effect as transitions
between ground states of different integer occupations in the uncoupled dots.
Level occupation switching is very sensitive to small energy differences and
therefore also to the details of the parametrized exchange-correlation
functionals. An existing functional already captures the effect on a
qualitative level but we also provide an improved parametrization which is very
accurate when compared to reference numerical renormalization group results.

<h3>Multi-band character revealed from Weak-antilocalization effect in  Platinum thin films</h3>

<br>
Platinum (Pt) has been very much used for spin-charge conversion in
spintronics research due to it's large intrinsic spin-orbit interaction.
Magnetoconductance originated from weak-antilocalization effect in quantum
interference regime is used as a powerful tool to obtain the microscopic
information of spin-orbit interaction and coherence phase breaking scattering
process among itinerant electrons. To acquire the knowledge of different types
of scattering processes, we have performed magnetoconductance study on Pt thin
films which manifests multi-band (multi-channel) conduction. An extensive
analysis of quantum interference originated weak-antilocalization effect
reveals the existence of strong (weak) inter-band scattering between two
similar (different) orbitals. Coherence phase breaking lengths ($l_{\phi}$) and
their temperature dependence are found to be significantly different for these
two conducting bands. The observed effects are consistent with theoretical
predication that there exist three Fermi-sheets with one $s$ and two $d$
orbital character. This study provides the evidence of two independent
non-similar conducting channels and presence of anisotropic spin-orbit
interaction along with $e$-$e$ correlation in Pt thin films.

<h3>Quantum Spin-Wave Theory for non-collinear Spin Structures, a Review</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06771" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06771</a>
<br>
<i>Hung T. Diep</i>
<br>
In this review, we trace the evolution of the quantum spin-wave theory
treating non-collinear spin configurations. Non-collinear spin configurations
are consequences of the frustration created by competing interactions. They
include simple chiral magnets due to competing nearest-neighbor (NN) and
next-NN interactions and systems with geometry frustration such as the
triangular antiferromagnet and the Kagom\'e lattice. We review here spin-wave
results of such systems and also systems with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction. Accent is put on these non-collinear ground states which have to
be calculated before applying any spin-wave theory to determine the spectrum of
the elementary excitations from the ground states. We mostly show results
obtained by the use of a Green's function method. These results include the
spin-wave dispersion relation and the magnetizations, layer by layer, as
functions of $T$ in 2D, 3D and thin films. Some new unpublished results are
also included. Technical details and discussion on the method are shown and
discussed.

<h3>Unravelling the edge spectra of non-Hermitian Chern insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06774" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06774</a>

<br>
Non-Hermitian Chern insulators differ from their Hermitian cousins in one key
aspect: their edge spectra are incredibly rich and confounding. For example,
even in the simple case where the bulk spectrum consists of two bands with
Chern number $\pm 1$, the edge spectrum in the slab geometry may have one or
two edge states on both edges, or only at one of the edges, depending on the
model parameters. This blatant violation of the familiar bulk-edge
correspondence casts doubt on whether the bulk Chern number can still be a
useful topological invariant, and demands a working theory that can predict and
explain the myriad of edge spectra from the bulk Hamiltonian to restore the
bulk-edge correspondence. We outline how such a theory can be set up to yield a
thorough understanding of the edge phase diagram based on the notion of the
generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) and the asymptotic properties of block
Toeplitz matrices. The procedure is illustrated by solving and comparing three
non-Hermitian generalizations of the Qi-Wu-Zhang model, a canonical example of
two-band Chern insulators. We find that, surprisingly, in many cases the phase
boundaries and the number and location of the edge states can be obtained
analytically. Our analysis also reveals a non-Hermitian semimetal phase whose
energy-momentum spectrum forms a continuous membrane with the edge modes
transversing the hole, or genus, of the membrane. Subtleties in defining the
Chern number over GBZ, which in general is not a smooth manifold and may have
singularities, are demonstrated using examples. The approach presented here can
be generalized to more complicated models of non-Hermitian insulators or
semimetals in two or three dimensions.

<h3>Measurement of directional atomic modulation direction using the  azimuthal variation of first order Laue zone electron diffraction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06787" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06787</a>
<br>
<i>Aurys Silinga, Christopher S. Allen, Juri Barthel, Colin Ophus, Ian MacLaren</i>
<br>
We show that diffraction intensity into the First Order Laue Zone (FOLZ) of a
crystal can have a strong azimuthal dependence, where this FOLZ ring appears
solely because of unidirectional atom position modulation. Such a modulation
was already known to cause the appearance of elliptical columns in atom
resolution images, but we show that measurement of the angle via 4-dimensional
Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (4DSTEM) is far more reliable and
allows the measurement of the modulation direction with a precision of about
1{\deg} and an accuracy of about 3{\deg}. This method could be very powerful in
characterising atomic structures in 3 dimensions by 4DSTEM, especially in cases
where the structure deviates from that found in bulk crystals.

<h3>Revealing the band structure of ZrTe$_5$ using Multicarrier Transport</h3>

<br>
The layered material ZrTe$_5$ appears to exhibit several exotic behaviors
which resulted in significant interest recently, although the exact properties
are still highly debated. Among these we find a Dirac/Weyl semimetallic
behavior, nontrivial spin textures revealed by low temperature transport, and a
potential weak or strong topological phase. The anomalous behavior of
resistivity has been recently elucidated as originating from band shifting in
the electronic structure. Our work examines magnetotransport behavior in
ZrTe$_5$ samples in the context of multicarrier transport. The results, in
conjunction with ab-initio band structure calculations, indicate that many of
the transport features of ZrTe$_5$ across the majority of the temperature range
can be adequately explained by the semiclassical multicarrier transport model
originating from a complex Fermi surface.

<h3>Analytic solution of the resolvent equations for heterogeneous random  graphs: spectral and localization properties</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06805" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06805</a>
<br>
<i>Jeferson D. Silva, Fernando L. Metz</i>
<br>
The spectral and localization properties of heterogeneous random graphs are
determined by the resolvent distributional equations, which have so far
resisted an analytic treatment. We solve analytically the resolvent equations
of random graphs with an arbitrary degree distribution in the high-connectivity
limit, from which we perform a thorough analysis of the impact of degree
fluctuations on the spectral density, the inverse participation ratio, and the
distribution of the local density of states. We show that all eigenvectors are
extended and that the spectral density exhibits a logarithmic or a power-law
divergence when the variance of the degree distribution is large enough. We
elucidate this singular behaviour by showing that the distribution of the local
density of states at the center of the spectrum displays a power-law tail
determined by the variance of the degree distribution. In the regime of weak
degree fluctuations the spectral density has a finite support, which promotes
the stability of large complex systems on random graphs.

<h3>Diamagnetic response and phase stiffness for interacting isolated narrow  bands</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06817" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06817</a>
<br>
<i>Dan Mao, Debanjan Chowdhury</i>
<br>
Superconductivity in electronic systems, where the non-interacting bandwidth
for a set of isolated bands is small compared to the scale of the interactions,
is a non-perturbative problem. Here we present a theoretical framework for
computing the electromagnetic response in the limit of zero frequency and
vanishing transverse momentum for the interacting problem, which controls the
superconducting phase stiffness, without resorting to any mean-field
approximation. Importantly, the contribution to the phase stiffness arises from
(I) "integrating-out" the remote bands that couple to the microscopic current
operator, and (ii) the density-density interactions projected on to the
isolated narrow bands. We also obtain the electromagnetic response in the limit
of an infinite gap to the remote bands, using the appropriate "projected"
gauge-transformations. These results can be used to obtain a conservative upper
bound on the phase stiffness, and relatedly the superconducting transition
temperature, with a few assumptions. In a companion article, we apply this
formalism to a host of topologically (non-)trivial "flat-band" systems,
including twisted bilayer graphene.
