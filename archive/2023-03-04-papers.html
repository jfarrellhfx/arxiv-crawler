<h3>Quantum Dynamics of Attractive and Repulsive Polarons in a Doped  MoSe$_2$ Monolayer</h3>

<br>
When mobile impurities are introduced and coupled to a Fermi sea, new
quasiparticles known as Fermi polarons are formed. There are two interesting,
yet drastically different regimes of the Fermi polaron problem: (I) the
attractive polaron (AP) branch, connected to pairing phenomena spanning the
crossover from BCS superfluidity to the Bose-Einstein condensation of
molecules; and (II) the repulsive branch (RP), which underlies the physics
responsible for Stoner's itinerant ferromagnetism. Here, we study Fermi
polarons in two dimensional systems, where many questions and debates regarding
their nature persist. The model system we investigate is a doped MoSe$_2$
monolayer. We find the observed AP-RP energy splitting and the quantum dynamics
of attractive polarons agree with the predictions of polaron theory. As the
doping density increases, the quantum dephasing of the attractive polarons
remains constant, indicative of stable quasiparticles, while the repulsive
polaron dephasing rate increases nearly quadratically. The dynamics of Fermi
polarons are of critical importance for understanding the pairing and magnetic
instabilities that lead to the formation of rich quantum phases found in a wide
range of physical systems including nuclei, cold atomic gases, and solids.

Microwave circuit electrodynamics of disordered superconductors is a very
active research topic spawning a wide range of experiments and applications.
For compact superconducting circuit elements, the transition to an insulating
state poses a limit to the maximum attainable kinetic inductance. It is
therefore vital to study the fundamental noise properties of thin films close
to this transition, particularly in situations where a good coherence and
temporal stability is required. In this paper, we present measurements on
superconducting granular aluminum microwave resonators with high normal state
resistances, where the influence of the superconductor to insulator phase
transition is visible. We trace fluctuations of the fundamental resonance
frequency and observe, in addition to a 1/f noise pattern, a distinct excess
noise, reminiscent of a random telegraph signal. The excess noise shows a
strong dependency on the resistivity of the films as well as the sample
temperature, but not on the applied microwave power.

The concept of topological energy bands and their manifestations have been
demonstrated in condensed matter systems as a fantastic paradigm toward
unprecedented physical phenomena and properties that are robust against
disorders. Recent years, this paradigm was extended to phononic metamaterials
(including mechanical and acoustic metamaterials), giving rise to the discovery
of remarkable phenomena that were not observed elsewhere thanks to the
extraordinary controllability and tunability of phononic metamaterials as well
as versatile measuring techniques. These phenomena include, but not limited to,
topological negative refraction, topological 'sasers' (i.e., the phonon analog
of lasers), higher-order topological insulating states, non-Abelian topological
phases, higher-order Weyl semimetal phases, Majorana-like modes in Dirac vortex
structures and fragile topological phases with spectral flows. Here we review
the developments in the field of topological phononic metamaterials from both
theoretical and experimental perspectives with emphasis on the underlying
physics principles. To give a broad view of topological phononics, we also
discuss the synergy with non-Hermitian effects and cover topics including
synthetic dimensions, artificial gauge fields, Floquet topological acoustics,
bulk topological transport, topological pumping, and topological active matters
as well as potential applications, materials fabrications and measurements of
topological phononic metamaterials. Finally, we discuss the challenges,
opportunities and future developments in this intriguing field and its
potential impact on physics and materials science.

<h3>A single-band model with enhanced pairing from DMRG-based downfolding of  the three-band Hubbard model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00756" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00756</a>
<br>
<i>Shengtao Jiang, Douglas J. Scalapino, Steven R. White</i>
<br>
<br>
Typical Wannier-function downfolding starts with a mean-field or density
functional set of bands to construct the Wannier functions. Here we carry out a
more controlled approach, using DMRG-computed natural orbital bands, to
downfold the three-band Hubbard model to an effective single band model,
computing all possible two-particle terms and retaining those with significant
magnitudes. The resulting single-band model includes two-site
occupancy-dependent hopping terms with significant magnitudes, $t_n \sim 0.6
t$. These terms lead to a reduction of the ratio $U/t_{\rm eff}$, and are
important in capturing the doping-asymmetric carrier mobility, as well as in
enhancing the pairing in a single-band model for the hole-doped cuprates. A
measurement of the superconducting phase stiffness reveals that a mean-field
treatment of the new terms is not nearly as effective in enhancing pairing as
the terms themselves.

<h3>General scatterings and electronic states in the quantum-wire network of  moir√© systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00759" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00759</a>
<br>
<i>Chen-Hsuan Hsu, Daniel Loss, Jelena Klinovaja</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate electronic states in a two-dimensional network consisting of
interacting quantum wires, a model adopted for twisted bilayer systems. We
construct general operators which describe various scattering processes in the
system. In a twisted bilayer structure, the moir\'e periodicity allows for
generalized umklapp scatterings, leading to a class of correlated states at
fractional fillings. We identify scattering processes which can lead to an
insulating bulk with gapless chiral edge modes at certain fractional fillings,
resembling the quantum anomalous Hall effect recently observed in twisted
bilayer graphene. Finally, we propose experimental setups to detect and
characterize the edge modes through spectroscopic and transport measurements.

<h3>Probing Li-Haldane conjecture with a perturbed boundary</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00772" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00772</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The famous Li-Haldane conjecture relates the energy and bi-partite
entanglement spectrum in many topological phases. This correspondence is
usually satisfied in chiral ordered states or systems with a symmetry-protected
gapless boundary. Although a lot of theoretical and numerical works have
confirmed the conjecture in topological states with bulk-boundary
correspondence, the cases with gapped boundary are widely unknown. Via newly
developed quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) scheme, we extract the large-scale
entanglement spectrum and study its relation with energy spectrum in the
Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) phase with a tunnable boundary on the
square-octagon lattice. We find the low-lying entanglement spectrum does not
always show similar behaviors as the energy spectrum on the tunnable boundary.
The breakdown of the correspondence originates from the perturbation in the
environment and the coupling between the subsystem and its environment. This
can be understood by the wormhole effect in the path integral representation of
reduced density matrix. Our study generalizes the established correspondence
between gapless/gapped boundary energy spectrum and entanglement spectrum, and
further demonstrates there exists a deep connection between physical and
entanglement degrees of freedom in quantum many-body systems.

<br>
Biological systems present a powerful, yet largely untapped, opportunity to
impart autonomous regulation to materials. Because these systems can function
robustly to regulate when and where chemical reactions occur, they have the
ability to bring complex, life-like behavior to synthetic materials. Here, we
achieve this design feat by using functionalized circadian clock proteins, KaiB
and KaiC, to engineer time-dependent crosslinking of colloids. The resulting
material self-assembles with programmable kinetics, producing macroscopic
changes in material properties, via molecular assembly of KaiB-KaiC complexes.
We show that colloid crosslinking depends strictly on the phosphorylation state
of KaiC, with kinetics that are synced with KaiB-KaiC complexing. Our
microscopic image analyses and computational models indicate that self-assembly
of colloidal super-structures requires multiple Kai complexes per colloid
connection, which then stabilizes the material against dissolution. This work
introduces the concept of harnessing biological timers to control synthetic
materials; and, more generally, opens the door to using protein-based reaction
networks to endow synthetic systems with life-like functional properties.

<h3>Solving the electronic structure problem for over 100,000 atoms in  real-space</h3>

Using a real-space high order finite-difference approach, we investigate the
electronic structure of large spherical silicon nanoclusters. Within Kohn-Sham
density functional theory and using pseudopotentials, we report the
self-consistent field convergence of a system with over 100,000 atoms: a
Si(107,641)H(9,084) nanocluster with a diameter of 16 nm. Our approach uses
Chebyshev-filtered subspace iteration to speed-up the convergence of the
eigenspace, and blockwise Hilbert space filling curves to speed-up sparse
matrix-vector multiplications, all of which is implemented in the PARSEC code.
For the largest system, we utilized 2048 nodes (114,688 processors) on the
Frontera machine in the Texas Advanced Computing Center. Our quantitative
analysis of the electronic structure shows how it gradually approaches its bulk
counterpart as a function of the nanocluster size. The band gap is enlarged due
to quantum confinement in nanoclusters, but decreases as the system size
increases, as expected. Our work serves as a proof-of-concept for the capacity
of the real-space approach in efficiently parallelizing very large calculations
using high performance computer platforms, which can straightforwardly be
replicated in other systems with more than $10^5$ atoms.

<h3>Rayleigh-Taylor instability in a phase-separated three-component  Bose-Einstein condensate</h3>

We investigate the Rayleigh-Taylor instability at the two interfaces in a
phase-separated three-component Bose-Einstein condensate in the mean-field
framework. The subsequent dynamics in the immiscible three-component condensate
has been studied in detail for different cases of instigating the instability
in the system. The rotational symmetry of the system breaks when the atom-atom
interaction is tuned in such a way that the interface between the components
becomes unstable giving rise to non-linear patterns of mushroom shapes which
grow exponentially with time. We also identify these non-linear patterns as the
solutions of the angular Mathieu equation, representing the normal modes.

<h3>The "Sign problem" of the 3rd order anomalous Hall effect in topological  magnetic materials</h3>

The anomalous Hall effect (AHE), which provides a bridgeway between the
geometry of quantum wavefunctions and transport measurements, has been a key
focus of intensive studies. In addition to the well-studied linear AHE,
governed by the electronic Berry curvature, nonlinear AHE originated from
higher-order Berry-curvature multipoles has also been observed in recent
studies. Inspired by the 3rd order AHE and its room temperature sign switching
in kagome antiferromagnet FeSn [S. Sankar, R. Liu, X. Gao, et al, to be
published (2023)], we investigate the generic sign structure of Berry-curvature
induced 3rd order AHE in topological magnetic material. We find that in
contrast to the linear Hall coefficient, whose sign is determined by the broken
time-reversal symmetry, the sign of the 3rd order Hall coefficient is dictated
by the interplay between time-reversal symmetry breaking, magnetic order, and
spin-orbit couplings. Our calculations give a possible solution for the ``sign
problem" of the 3rd order AHE response in the phase space spanned by the in-
and out-of-plane magnetization, the spin-orbital coupling strength and chemical
potential. We further propose realistic experiment setups to systematically
reveal the sign structure in the 3rd order AHE response via continuously
rotating the magnetic field directions.

<h3>Proton-fluence dependent magnetic properties of exfoliable quasi-2D van  der Waals Cr2Si2Te6 magnet</h3>

<br>
<br>
The discovery of long-range magnetic ordering in atomically thin materials
catapulted the van der Waals (vdW) family of compounds into an unprecedented
popularity. In particular, with a current push in space exploration, it is
beneficial to study how the properties of such materials evolve under proton
irradiation. Owing to their robust intra-layer stability and sensitivity to
external perturbations, these materials provide excellent opportunities for
studying proton irradiation as a non-destructive tool for controlling their
magnetic properties. Specifically, the exfoliable Cr2Si2Te6 (CST) is a
ferromagnetic semiconductor with the Curie temperature (TC) of ~32 K. Here, we
have investigated the magnetic properties of CST upon proton irradiation as a
function of fluence (1 x 1015, 5 x 1015, 1 x 1016, 5 x 1016, and 1 x 1018
H+/cm2) by employing variable-temperature, variable-field magnetization
measurements coupled with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy
and detail how the magnetization, magnetic anisotropy and EPR spectral
parameters vary as a function of proton fluence across the magnetic phase
transition. While the TC remains constant as a function of proton fluence, we
observed that the saturation magnetization and magnetic anisotropy diverge at
the proton fluence of 5 x 1016 H+/cm2, which is prominent in the ferromagnetic
phase, in particular. This work demonstrates that proton irradiation is a
feasible method for modifying the magnetic properties and local magnetic
interactions of vdWs crystals, which represents a significant step forward in
the design of future spintronic and magneto-electronic applications.

<h3>Disordered hyperuniform vortex matter with rhombic distortions in FeSe  at low fields</h3>

<br>
<br>
In the current quest to synthesize hyperuniform materials with interesting
applications, addressing the coupling of the objects composing the system to
the physical properties of the host medium is crucial. With this aim we study a
model system: vortices in the FeSe superconductor subject to a considerable
magneto-elastic coupling with the host sample. We reveal that the low-field
FeSe vortex structure is of the weakest hyperuniform type possibly due to the
relevance of the anisotropic and long-ranged interaction term introduced by the
magneto-elastic coupling. This work indicates that it is possible to tailor the
hyperuniformity class of material systems by tuning the coupling of interacting
objects with elastic properties of the host medium.

<h3>Nodeless electron pairing in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$-derived kagome  superconductors</h3>

<br>
The newly discovered kagome superconductors represent a promising platform
for investigating the interplay between band topology, electronic order, and
lattice geometry. Despite extensive research efforts on this system, the nature
of the superconducting ground state remains elusive. In particular, consensus
on the electron pairing symmetry has not been achieved so far, in part owing to
the lack of a momentum-resolved measurement of the superconducting gap
structure. Here we report the direct observation of a nodeless, nearly
isotropic, and orbital-independent superconducting gap in the momentum space of
two exemplary CsV$_3$Sb$_5$-derived kagome superconductors --
Cs(V$_{0.93}$Nb$_{0.07}$)$_3$Sb$_5$ and Cs(V$_{0.86}$Ta$_{0.14}$)$_3$Sb$_5$,
using ultrahigh resolution and low-temperature angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES). Remarkably, such a gap structure is robust to the
appearance or absence of charge order in the normal state, tuned by isovalent
Nb/Ta substitutions of V. Moreover, we observe a signature of the time-reversal
symmetry (TRS) breaking inside the superconducting state, which extends the
previous observation of TRS-breaking CDW in the kagome lattice. Our
comprehensive characterizations of the superconducting state provide
indispensable information on the electron pairing of kagome superconductors,
and advance our understanding of unconventional superconductivity and
intertwined electronic orders.

<h3>Subgap spectroscopy along hybrid nanowires by nm-thick tunnel barriers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00903" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00903</a>

<br>
<br>
Tunneling spectroscopy is widely used to examine the subgap spectra in
semiconductor-superconductor nanostructures when searching for Majorana zero
modes (MZMs). Typically, semiconductor sections controlled by local gates at
the ends of hybrids serve as tunnel barriers. Besides detecting states only at
the hybrid ends, such gate-defined tunnel probes can cause the formation of
non-topological subgap states that mimic MZMs. Here, we develop an alternative
type of tunnel probes to overcome these limitations. After the growth of an
InSb-Al hybrid nanowire, a precisely controlled in-situ oxidation of the Al
shell is performed to yield a nm-thick Al oxide layer. In such thin isolating
layer, tunnel probes can be arbitrarily defined at any position along the
hybrid nanowire by shadow-wall angle-deposition of metallic leads. This allows
us to make multiple tunnel probes along single nanowire hybrids and to
successfully identify Andreev bound states (ABSs) of various spatial extension
residing along the hybrids.

<h3>Friedel oscillation in non-Fermi liquid: Lesson from exactly solvable  Hatsugai-Kohmoto model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00926" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00926</a>
<br>
<i>Miaomiao Zhao, Hong-Gang Luo, Yin Zhong</i>
<br>
<br>
When non-magnetic impurity immerses in Fermi sea, a regular modulation of
charge density around impurity will appear and such phenomena is called Friedel
oscillation (FO). Although both Luttinger liquid and Landau Fermi liquid show
such characteristic oscillation, FO in generic non-Fermi liquid (NFL) phase is
still largely unknown. Here, we show that FO indeed exists in NFL state of an
exact solvable model, i.e. the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. Interestingly, if two
interaction-induced quasiparticles bands in NFL are partially occupied, FO in
this situation is determined by a novel structure in momentum space, i.e. the
'average Fermi surface' (average over two quasiparticle Fermi surface), which
highlights the inter-band particle-hole excitation. We hope our study here
provides a counterintuitive example in which FO with Fermi surface coexists
with NFL quasi-particle, and it may be useful to detect hidden 'average Fermi
surface' structure in other correlated electron systems.

<h3>Stoichiometric growth of SrTiO3 films via Bayesian optimization with  adaptive prior mean</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00929" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00929</a>
<br>
<i>Yuki K. Wakabayashi, Takuma Otsuka, Yoshiharu Krockenberger, Hiroshi Sawada, Yoshitaka Taniyasu, Hideki Yamamoto</i>
<br>
<br>
Perovskite insulator SrTiO3 is expected to be applied to the next generation
of electronic and photonic devices as high-k capacitors and photocatalysts.
However, reproducible growth of highly insulating stoichiometric SrTiO3 films
remains challenging due to the difficulty of the precise stoichiometry control
in perovskite oxide films. Here, to grow stoichiometric SrTiO3 thin films by
fine-tuning multiple growth conditions, we developed a new Bayesian
optimization (BO)-based machine learning method that encourages the exploration
of the search space by varying the prior mean to get out of suboptimal growth
condition parameters. Using simulated data, we demonstrate the efficacy of the
new BO method, which reproducibly reaches the global best conditions. With the
BO method implemented in machine-learning-assisted molecular beam epitaxy
(ML-MBE), highly insulating stoichiometric SrTiO3 film with no absorption in
the band gap was developed in only 44 MBE growth runs. The proposed algorithm
provides an efficient experimental design platform that is not as dependent on
the experience of individual researchers and will accelerate not only oxide
electronics but also various material syntheses.

<h3>Unidirectional Microwave Transduction with Chirality Selected  Short-Wavelength Magnon Excitations</h3>

<br>
<br>
Nonreciprocal magnon propagation has recently become a highly potential
approach of developing chip-embedded microwave isolators for advanced
information processing. However, it is challenging to achieve large
nonreciprocity in miniaturized magnetic thin-film devices because of the
difficulty of distinguishing propagating surface spin waves along the opposite
directions when the film thickness is small. In this work, we experimentally
realize unidirectional microwave transduction with sub-micron-wavelength
propagating magnons in a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film delay line. We
achieve a non-decaying isolation of 30 dB with a broad field-tunable band-pass
frequency range up to 14 GHz. The large isolation is due to the selection of
chiral magnetostatic surface spin waves with the Oersted field generated from
the coplanar waveguide antenna. Increasing the geometry ratio between the
antenna width and YIG thickness drastically reduces the nonreciprocity and
introduces additional magnon transmission bands. Our results pave the way for
on-chip microwave isolation and tunable delay line with short-wavelength
magnonic excitations.

<br>
<br>
Single crystals of a new layered compound, Cr1.21Te2, was synthesized via a
vapor transport method. The crystal structure and physical properties were
characterized by single crystal and powder x-ray diffraction, temperature- and
field-dependent magnetization, zero-field heat capacity and angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy. Cr1.21Te2, containing two Cr sites, crystalizes in
a trigonal structure with a space group P-3 (No. 147). The Cr site in the
interstitial layer is partially occupied. Physical property characterizations
indicate that Cr1.21Te2 is metallic with hole pockets at the Fermi energy and
undergoes a ferromagnetic phase transition at ~173 K. The magnetic moments
align along the c-axis in the ferromagnetic state. Based on low temperature
magnetization, the spin stiffness constant D and spin excitation gap $\Delta$
were estimated according to Bloch's law to be D = 99 $\pm$ 24 meV $\r{A}^2$ and
$\Delta$ = 0.46 $\pm$ 0.33 meV, suggesting its possible application as a low
dimensional ferromagnet.

<h3>Detecting Fermi Surface Nesting Effect for Fermionic Dicke Transition by  Trap Induced Localization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00965" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00965</a>
<br>
<i>Shi Chen, Yu Chen</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, the statistical effect of fermionic superradiance is approved by
series of experiments both in free space and in a cavity. The Pauli blocking
effect can be visualized by a 1/2 scaling of Dicke transition critical pumping
strength against particle number Nat for fermions in a trap. However, the Fermi
surface nesting effect, which manifests the enhancement of superradiance by
Fermi statistics is still very hard to be identified. Here we studied the
influence of localized fermions on the trap edge when both pumping optical
lattice and the trap are presented. We find due to localization, the
statistical effect in superradiant transition is enhanced. Two new scalings of
critical pumping strength are observed as 4/3, and 2/3 for mediate particle
number, and the Pauli blocking scaling 1/3 (2d case) in large particle number
limit is unaffected. Further, we find the 4/3 scaling is subject to a power law
increasing with rising ratio between recoil energy and trap frequency in
pumping laser direction. The divergence of this scaling of critical pumping
strength against $N_{\rm at}$ in $E_R/\omega_x\rightarrow+\infty$ limit can be
identified as the Fermi surface nesting effect. Thus we find a practical
experimental scheme for visualizing the long-desired Fermi surface nesting
effect with the help of trap induced localization in a two-dimensional Fermi
gas in a cavity.

Ferromagnetism and superconductivity are two key ingredients to create
non-Abelian quasiparticle excitations that are expected as building blocks to
construct topological quantum computers. Adversely, ferromagnetism and
superconductivity are typically also two hostile orderings competing to align
spins in different configurations, making the material design and experimental
implementation extremely challenging. Recently, iron-based superconductor
Fe(Te,Se) has emerged as a connate topological superconductor (TSC), which
differentiates itself from other hybrid TSCs by self-proximitizing its Dirac
surface states with bulk superconductivity. So far, the efforts to search for
Majorana states in this material are prevalently focused on spectroscopy
techniques. In this paper, we present the global transport signature of
interfacial magnetism coexisting with superconductivity. Time-reversal symmetry
breaking superconducting states are confirmed through device level transport
measurements for the first time in a van der Waals (vdW) Josephson junction
structure. Magnetic hysteresis is observed in this device scheme, which only
appears below the superconducting critical temperature, leading to potential
Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconducting pairing mechanisms. The 0-{\pi} phase mixing
in the Fraunhofer patterns pinpoints the ferromagnetic state dwelling on the
surface. Furthermore, a stochastic field-free superconducting diode effect also
confirms the spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking which reflects the
behavior of the ferromagnetism. Our work paves a new way to explore topological
superconductivity in iron-based superconductors for future high Tc
fault-tolerant qubit implementations from a device perspective.

Molecular dynamics using atomistic modeling is frequently used to unravel the
mechanisms of macroion release from electrosprayed droplets. However, atomistic
modeling is currently feasible for only the smallest window of droplet sizes
appearing at the end of a disintegrating droplet's lifetime. The relevance of
the observations made to the actual droplet evolution, which is much longer
that the simulated sizes, has not been addressed. Here, we perform a systematic
study of desolvation mechanisms of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), protonated
peptides of different compositions and proteins in order to (a) examine whether
atomistic modeling can establish the extrusion mechanism of proteins from
droplets and (b) obtain insight for the charging mechanism in larger droplets
than those simulated. Atomistic modeling of PEG charging shows that above a
critical droplet size charging occurs transiently by transfer of ions from the
solvent to the macroion, while below the critical size, the capture of the ion
from PEG has a lifetime sufficiently long for extrusion of the charged PEG from
an aqueous droplet. This is the first report of the role of droplet curvature
in the conformations and charging of macroions. Simulations with highly
hydrophobic peptides show that partial extrusion of a peptide from the droplet
surface is rare relative to desolvation by drying-out. Differently from what
has been presented in the literature we argue that atomistic simulations have
not sufficiently established extrusion mechanism of proteins from droplets and
their charging mechanism. Moreover, we argue that release of highly charged
proteins can occur at an earlier stage of a droplet's lifetime than predicted
by atomistic modeling. In this earlier stage, we emphasize the key role of jets
emanating from a droplet at the point of charge-induced instability in the
release of proteins.

The physics related to Berry curvature is now a central research topic in
condensed matter physics. The Berry curvature dipole (BCD) is a significant and
intriguing condensed matter phenomenon that involves inversion symmetry
breaking. However, the creation and controllability of BCDs have so far been
limited to far below room temperature (RT) and non-volatile (i.e., ferroic)
BCDs have not yet been discovered, hindering further progress in topological
physics. In this work, we demonstrate a switchable and non-volatile BCD effect
at RT in a topological crystalline insulator, Pb1-xSnxTe (PST), which is
attributed to ferroic distortion. Surprisingly, the magnitude of the ferroic
BCD is several orders of magnitude greater than that of the non-ferroic BCDs
that appear, for example, in transition metal dichalcogenides. The discovery of
this ferroic and extraordinarily large BCD in PST could pave the way for
further progress in topological material science and the engineering of novel
topological devices.

<h3>Regulating Anderson Localization with Structural Defect Disorder</h3>

<br>
<br>
Localization due to disorder has been one of the most intriguing theoretical
concepts evolved in condensed matter. Here, we expand the theory of
localization by considering two types of disorder at the same time, namely the
original Anderson's disorder and the structural defect disorder, which has been
suggested to be a key component in recently discovered two-dimensional
amorphous materials. While increasing the degree of both disorders could induce
localization of wavefunction in real space, we find that a small degree of
structural defect disorder can significantly enhance the localization. As the
degree of structural defect disorder increases, localized states quickly appear
within the extended phase to enter a broad crossover region with mixed phases.
Full localization occurs when structural defect disorder reaches about 10
percent, even without considering the Anderson type disorder. Our theoretical
model provides a comprehensive understanding of localization in two-dimensional
amorphous materials and highlights the promising tunability of their transport
properties.

An ability of various interatomic potentials to reproduce the properties of

properties of the flat (FS), low-buckled (LBS), trigonal dumbbell (TDS),
honeycomb dumbbell (HDS) and large honeycomb dumbbell (LHDS) single-layer
silicon (silicene) phases, were obtained using density functional theory (DFT)

The $K$-core of a graph is the unique maximum subgraph within which each
vertex connects to at least $K$ other vertices. The $K$-core optimal attack
problem asks to construct a minimum-sized set of vertices whose removal results
in the complete collapse of the $K$-core. In this paper, we construct a
hierarchical cycle-tree packing model which converts a long-range correlated
$K$-core pruning process into static patterns and analyze this model through
the replica-symmetric (RS) cavity method of statistical physics. The cycle-tree
guided attack (CTGA) message-passing algorithm exhibits superior performance on
random regular and Erdos-Renyi graphs. It provides new upper bounds on the
minimal cardinality of the $K$-core attack set. The model of this work may be
extended to construct optimal initial conditions for other irreversible
dynamical processes.

Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) provides unique capabilities to control spin by
moving electrons around or turn electron trajectories by rotating spin.
Recently, van der Waals interactions with transition metal dichalcogenides was
shown to induce strong SOCs in graphene, offering great promises to combine
large experimental flexibility of graphene with unique tuning capabilities of
the SOC. Here, we investigate both SOC-driven band splitting and electron
dynamics in monolayer graphene on WSe$_2$ by measuring ballistic transverse
magnetic focusing (TMF) effect. We found the splitting in the first focusing
peak whose evolution in charge density and magnetic field is well reproduced by
calculations using the SOC strength of ~13 meV and its absence in the second
peak due to interband scattering at the edge. Temperature dependence
measurement shows the possible suppression of the electron-electron scattering
in the system. Further, we found that Shubnikov-de-Hass oscillations exhibit
SOC strength of ~3.4 meV, suggesting that it probes different electron
dynamics, calling for new theory. In addition to providing spectroscopic
evidence of the spin-orbit-coupled bands, our study demonstrates the
possibility to exploit various ballistic transport effects in graphene, such as
TMF, Veselago lensing, and Fabry-P\'erot interference, to control or detect
spin by turning ballistic electron motion.

The phase diagram of a para-H2 monolayer absorbed on a experimentally
syntetized amorphous carbon sheet was calculated using a diffusion Monte Carlo
technique. We found that the ground state of that system changed drastically
from a perfectly flat substrate to a situation in which the carbon atoms were
allowed a certain degree of disorder in the $z$ direction. In the first case,
at zero pressure we have a glass of density 0.056 $\pm$ 0.003 \AA$^{-2}$ in
equilibrium with an incommensurate solid of 0.068 $\pm$ 0.002 \AA$^{-2}$. At
the equilibrium density, the glass was found to have a tiny, but non-negligible
superfluid faction of less than 1 \% (0.44 $\pm$ 0.05 \%). In the
$z$-disordered substrate, we observe a significant enhancement of the
superfluid fraction in the glass phase as well as a smaller but not zero value
in the incommensurate crystal.

<br>
<br>
Superconductivity is one of most intriguing quantum phenomena, and the quest
for elemental superconductors with high critical temperature (Tc) holds great
scientific significance due to their relatively simple material composition and
underlying mechanism. Here, we report an experimental discovery of densely
compressed scandium (Sc) becoming the first elemental superconductor with Tc
breaking into 30 K range, which is comparable to Tc values of the classic
La-Ba-Cu-O or LaFeAsO superconductors. Our results show that Tconset of Sc
increases monotonically from ~3 K at 43 GPa to ~32 K at 283 GPa (Tczero ~ 31
K), which is well above liquid Neon temperature. Interestingly, measured Tc
shows no sign of saturation up to the maximum pressure of 283 GPa achieved in
our experiments, indicating that Tc may go higher at further rising pressures.
The lift of the 3d orbitals by pressure close to the Fermi energy contributes
to enhanced electron-phonon coupling, leading to dramatic rise of Tc. This work
demonstrates an effective strategy to produce high-Tc superconductivity via
rational pressure induced electronic orbital engineering that may work in
diverse materials.

<h3>Evolution of complex magnetic phases and metal-insulator transition  through Nb substitution in La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$Co$_{1-x}$Nb$_x$O$_3$</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report the evolution of structural, magnetic, transport, and electronic
properties of bulk polycrystalline La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$Co$_{1-x}$Nb$_x$O$_3$
($x =$ 0.025--0.25) samples. The Rietveld refinement of the x-ray diffraction
patterns with R$\bar3$c space group reveals that the lattice parameters and
rhombohedral distortion monotonously increase with the Nb$^{5+}$(4$d^0$)
substitution ($x$). The magnetic susceptibility exhibits a decrease in the
magnetic ordering temperature and net magnetization with $x$, which manifests
that the Nb substitution dilutes the ferromagnetic (FM) double exchange
interaction and enhances the antiferromagnetic (AFM) super-exchange
interaction. Interestingly, for the $x>$ 0.1 samples the FM order is completely
suppressed and the emergence of a glassy state is clearly evident. Moreover,
the decrease in the coercivity (H$\rm_{C}$) and remanence (M$\rm_{r}$) with $x$
in the magnetic isotherms measured at 5~K further confirms the dominance of AFM
interactions and reduction of FM volume fraction for the $x>$ 0.1 samples. More
interestingly, we observe resistivity minima for the $x=$ 0.025 and 0.05
samples, which are analyzed using the quantum corrections in the conductivity,
and found that the weak localization effect dominates over the renormalized
electron-electron interactions in the 3D limit. Further, a semiconducting
resistivity behavior is obtained for $x>$ 0.05, which follows the Arrhenius law
at high temperatures ($\sim$160--320~K), and the 3D-variable range hopping
prevails in the low-temperature region ($<$160~K). The core-level photoemission
spectra confirm the valence state of constituent elements and the absence of
Co$^{2+}$ is discernible.

<br>
A serial triple quantum dot (TQD) integrated with a quantum dot (QD) charge
sensor is realized from an InAs nanowire via a fine finger-gate technique. The
complex charge states and intriguing properties of the device are studied in
the few-electron regime by direct transport measurements and by charge-sensor
detection measurements. The measurements of the charge stability diagram for a
capacitively coupled, parallel double-QD formed from a QD in the TQD and the
sensor QD show a visible capacitance coupling between the TQD and the sensor
QD, indicating a good sensitivity of the charge sensor. The charge stability
diagrams of the TQD are measured by the charge sensor and the global features
seen in the measured charge stability diagrams are well reproduced by the
simultaneous measurements of the direct transport current through the TQD and
by the simulation made based on an effective capacitance network model. The
complex charge stability diagrams of the TQD are measured in detail with the
integrated charge sensor in an energetically degenerate region, where all the
three QDs are on or nearly on resonance, and the formations of quadruple points
and of all possible eight charge states are observed. In addition, the
operation of the TQD as a quantum cellular automata is demonstrated and
discussed.

<br>
<br>
We analyze the correspondence between two formalisms describing an
interacting Bose gas, namely the standard Feynman diagrammatic expansion on the
one hand, and the hierarchy equations for the imaginary-time Green functions on
the other hand. We show that the Hartree-Fock approximation, as well as its
first corrections at low density derived by Baym et al. [Eur. Phys. J. B, 24,
pp. 107-124 (2001)], can be equivalently formulated in both formalisms. Within
the hierarchy approach, the two-body correlations ${\mathcal G}^{(2,\rm T)}$
are expressed at lowest order in the interactions in terms of the full one-body
Green function. This sheds light on the physical content of the corrections to
the Hartree-Fock theory. Moreover, this representation of ${\mathcal G}^{(2,\rm
T)}$ can be extended to higher orders, opening the way to systematic
calculations of further corrections to the ideal critical temperature when the
density increases.

We report an experimental demonstration of the magnetoelectrocaloric effect
(MECE) in multiferroic $\mathrm{GdFeO_3}$. The temperature of the magnetic
material changes when an external electric field is suddenly changed. MECE is
the largest below the ordering temperature of Gd moments and modifiable by a
magnetic field, suggesting that the ferroelectric transition affects MECE. The
observed MECE shows a higher energy efficiency than typical magnetocaloric
effects and adiabatic nuclear demagnetization. The present findings provide a
proof of concept of MECE in multiferroics.

Fracture phenomena in soft materials span multiple length- and timescales.
This poses a major challenge in computational modeling and predictive materials
design. To pass quantitatively from molecular- to continuum scales, a precise
representation of the material response at the molecular level is vital. Here,
we derive the nonlinear elastic response and fracture characteristics of
individual siloxane molecules using molecular dynamics (MD) studies. For short
chains, we find deviations from classical scalings for both the effective
stiffness and mean chain rupture times. A simple model of a non-uniform chain
of Kuhn segments captures the observed effect and agrees well with MD data. We
find that the dominating fracture mechanism depends on the applied force scale
in a non-monotonic fashion. This analysis suggests that common
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) networks fail at crosslinking points. Our results
can be readily lumped into coarse-grained models. Although focusing on PDMS as
a model system, our study presents a general procedure to pass beyond the
window of accessible rupture times in MD studies employing mean first passage
time theory, which can be exploited for arbitrary molecular systems.

Dense packing of particles has provided important models to study the
structure of matter in various systems such as liquid, glassy and crystalline
phase, etc. The simplest sphere packing models are able to represent and
capture salient properties of the building blocks for covalent, metallic and
ionic crystals; it however becomes insufficient to reflect the broken symmetry
of the commonly anisotropic molecules in complex molecular crystals. Here we
develop spheroid models with the minimal degree of anisotropy, which serve as a
simple geometrical representation for a rich spectrum of molecules--including
both isotropic and anisotropic, convex and concave ones--in crystalline phases.
Our models are determined via an inverse packing approach: given a molecular
crystal, an optimal spheroid model is constructed using a contact diagram,
which depicts packing relationship between neighboring molecules within the
crystal. The spheroid models are capable of accurately capturing the broken
symmetry and characterizing the equivalent volume of molecules in the
crystalline phases. Our model also allows to retrieve such molecular
information from poor-quality crystal X-ray diffraction data that otherwise
would be simply discarded.

Vibrating wires are common temperature probes in $^3$He experiments. By
measuring mechanical resonance of a wire driven by AC current in magnetic field
one can directly obtain temperature-dependent viscous damping. This is easy to
do in a linear regime where wire velocity is small enough and damping force is
proportional to velocity. At lowest temperatures in superfluid $^3$He-B a
strong non-linear damping appears and linear regime shrinks to a very small
velocity range. Expanding measurements to the non-linear area can significantly
improve sensitivity. In this note I describe some technical details useful for
analyzing such temperature measurements.

<br>
Magnetic insulators in reduced dimension are the ideal model systems to study
spin-crossover(SCO) induced cooperative behavior under pressure. Similar to the
external perturbations like light illumination or temperature, external
pressure may provide new pathway to accelerate giant lattice collapse,and
subsequently Mott transition in van der Waals (vdW) materials with diminishing
effect of the third dimension. Here, we investigate room-temperature
layer-dependent SCO and insulator-metal transition in vdW magnet,FePS3, under
high pressure using micro-Raman scattering.Experimentally obtained spectra, in
agreement with the computed Raman modes, indicates evidence of IMT of FePS3
started off with a spin-state transition from a high (S=2) to low spin state
(S=0) with a thickness dependent critical pressure (P_c) which reduces to 1.45
GPa in 3-layer flakes compared to 10.8 GPa for the bulk counterpart.
Additionally, a broad Raman mode (P*) emerges between 310 cm^{-1} and 370
cm^{-1} at elevated pressure for three different thicknesses of FePS3 flakes
(3-100 layers), also corroborated with computational results which suggests the
pressure dependent decrease of metal-ligand bond distance(Fe-S) with lowering
of magnetic moment in FePS3. Phenomenologically, our results in few-layer
flakes with strong structural anisotropy which enhances the in-plane strain
with applied pressure can be understood by adopting Hubbard model and
considering the spectral-range (bandwidth W) as a function of layer numbers and
pressure with a power-law scaling. Reduction of the critical pressure for phase
transition in few-layer vdW magnets to 1-2 GPa marks the possibility of using
nano-enclosure fit for use in device electronics where the pressure is induced
due to interfacial adhesion, like in vdW heterostructure or molecules trapped
between layers,and thereby,avoiding the conventional use of diamond anvil cell.

We present simulation results of the ground state structure and dynamics of
quantum droplets in one-dimensional spin-orbit coupled binary Bose-Einstein
condensates. We have considered two cases for this analysis, such as (i) the
mean-field term has a vanishingly small contribution utilizing the equal and
opposite inter- and intraspecies interaction and (ii) unequal inter- and
intraspecies interaction. For both cases, it shows remarkably different natures
of the quantum droplet. In the former case, it exhibits bright sech-like
droplet nature, while in the latter case, we find the flattened sech-like shape
of the droplet. Further, we analyze the effect of velocity perturbation on the
dynamics in both cases. For the first case, we find a systematic change from
the solitonic droplet nature to the breathing droplet which finally has a
moving droplet feature upon increasing the velocity. However, the second case
shows similar dynamics except having more dynamically stable features than the
first. Finally, we present various dynamics that ensued in the quantum droplet
due to the quenching of the interaction parameters, coupling parameters or
allowing the droplet to undergo collisions.

Clarifying the interplay between charge density waves (CDWs) and
superconductivity is important in the kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, and pressure
($P$) can play a crucial role. Here, we present $^{121/123}$Sb nuclear
quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements under hydrostatic pressures up to 2.43
GPa in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ single crystals. We demonstrate that the CDW gradually
changes from a commensurate modulation with a star-of-David (SoD) pattern to an
incommensurate one with a superimposed SoD and Tri-hexagonal (TrH) pattern
stacking along the $c$-axis. Moreover, the linewidth $\delta\nu$ of
$^{121/123}$Sb-NQR spectra increases with cooling down to $T_{\rm CDW}$,
indicating the appearance of a short-range CDW order due to CDW fluctuations
pinned by quenched disorders. The $\delta\nu$ shows a Curie-Weiss temperature
dependence and tends to diverge at $P_{\rm c} \sim$ 1.9 GPa, suggesting that a
CDW quantum critical point (QCP) exists at $P_{\rm c}$ where $T_{\rm c}$ shows
the maximum. For $P > P_{\rm c}$, spin fluctuations are enhanced when the CDW
is suppressed. Our results suggest that the maximal $T_{\rm c}$ at $P_{\rm c}
\sim$ 1.9 GPa is related to the CDW QCP and the presence of spin fluctuations
prevent the $T_{\rm c}$ from a rapid decrease otherwise after the CDW is
completely suppressed.

<br>
The discovery of correlated insulating states in moir\'e heterostructures has
renewed the interest in strongly-coupled electron systems where spin and valley
(or layer) degrees of freedom are intertwined. In the strong-coupling limit,
such systems can be effectively described by SU(4) spin-valley models akin to
Kugel-Khomskii models long studied in the context of spin-orbit coupled
materials. However, typical moir\'e heterostructures also exhibit interactions
that break the SU(4) symmetry down to
SU(2)${}_{\mathrm{spin}}\otimes$U(1)${}_{\mathrm{valley}}$. Here we investigate
the impact of such symmetry-breaking couplings on the magnetic phase diagram
for triangular superlattices considering a filling of two electrons (or holes)
per moir\'e unit cell. We explore a broad regime of couplings -- including XXZ
anisotropies, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange and on-site Hund's couplings --
using semi-classical Monte Carlo simulations. We find a multitude of
classically ordered phases, including (anti-)ferromagnetic, incommensurate, and
stripe order, manifesting in different sectors of the spin-valley model's
parameter space. Zooming in on the regimes where quantum fluctuations are
likely to have an effect, we employ pseudo-fermion functional renormalization
group (pf-FRG) calculations to resolve quantum disordered ground states such as
spin-valley liquids, which we indeed find for certain parameter regimes. As a
concrete example, we discuss the case of trilayer graphene aligned with
hexagonal boron nitride using material-specific parameters.

The effect of spin-orbit (and Darwin) interaction on a 2D electron gas
subject to a radial symmetric, inhomogeneous $1/r$-magnetic field is discussed
analytically in a perturbative and non-perturbative manner. For this purpose,
we investigate the radial Hall conductivity that emerges from an additional
homogeneous electric field perturbation perpendicular to the 2D electron gas,
which solely interacts via spin-orbit coupling. Numerical calculation of the
absorptive spin-orbit spectra show for an ideal InSb electron gas a behaviour
that is dominated by the localized (atomic) part of the distorted Landau
levels. In contrast, however, we also find analytically that a (non-local)
divergent static response emerges for Fermi energies close to the ionization
energy in the thermodynamic limit. The divergent linear response implies that
the external electric field is entirely absorbed by induced radial spin-orbit
currents, where the induced flow direction depends on the effective
$g^*$-factor of the material. In more detail, the divergent currents show a
critical behaviour at $g^*_c=2$, where it abruptly switches direction. The
observed diverging spin-orbit absorption relies on the presence of degenerate
energies with allowed selection rules that are imposed by the radial symmetry
of our inhomogeneous setup. We show analytically the emergence of a discrete
Rydberg-like band structure that obeys these symmetry properties. In a last
step, we investigate the robustness of the spectra with respect to slow
variations of the applied magnetic field, by solving analytically the Dirac
equation expanded up to order $1/(mc)^2$. We find that the spin-orbit
interaction from the time-dependent field variations cannot lift the static
degeneracies, i.e., the degenerate states are protected with respect to slow
changes of the $1/r$-magnetic field.

<br>
<br>
We explore the electronic structure of paramagnetic CrSBr by comparative
first principles calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We
theoretically approximate the paramagnetic phase using a supercell hosting spin
configurations with broken long-range order and applying quasiparticle
self-consistent $GW$ theory, without and with the inclusion of excitonic vertex
corrections to the screened Coulomb interaction (QS$GW$ and QS$G\hat{W}$,
respectively). Comparing the quasi-particle band structure calculations to
angle-resolved photoemission data collected at 200 K results in excellent
agreement. This allows us to qualitatively explain the significant broadening
of some bands as arising from the broken magnetic long-range order and/or
electronic dispersion perpendicular to the quasi two-dimensional layers of the
crystal structure. The experimental band gap at 200 K is found to be at least
1.51 eV at 200 K. At lower temperature, no photoemission data can be collected
as a result of charging effects, pointing towards a significantly larger gap,
which is consistent with the calculated band gap of $\approx$ 2.1 eV.

We consider few-body systems in which only a certain subset of the
particle-particle interactions is resonant. We characterize each subset by a
{\it unitary graph} in which the vertices represent distinguishable particles
and the edges resonant 2-body interactions. Few-body systems whose unitary
graph is connected will collapse unless a repulsive 3-body interaction is
included. We find two categories of graphs, distinguished by the kind of 3-body
repulsion necessary to stabilize the associated system. Each category is
characterized by whether the graph contains a loop or not: for tree-like graphs
(graphs containing a loop) the 3-body force renormalizing them is the same as
in the 3-body system with two (three) resonant interactions. We show
numerically that this conjecture is correct for the 4-body case as well as for
a few 5-body configurations. We explain this result in the 4-body sector
qualitatively by imposing Bethe-Peierls boundary conditions on the pertinent
Faddeev-Yakubovsky~decomposition of the wave function.

PbTaSe2 is a non-centrosymmetric topological semimetal. In this work we have
explored the structural, elastic, mechanical, bonding, electronic, acoustic,
thermal, and optical properties of PbTaSe2. The electronic bond structure
calculations confirm semi-metallic character. Fermi surface topology shows both
electron and hole sheets. The single crystal elastic constants reveal that
PbTaSe2 is elastically stable. The compound is soft, brittle, and highly
machinable at the same time. It also possesses very high level of dry
lubricity. Various anisotropy indicators suggest that PbTaSe2 is elastically
anisotropic with layered character. The phonon dynamics has been investigated.
Phonon dispersion plot shows that the compound is dynamically stable with a
clear frequency gap between the acoustic and optical branches. The Debye
temperature, phonon thermal conductivity, and melting temperature of PbTaSe2 is
low. The compound has medium Gr\"uneisen parameter. The bonding character is
mainly dominated by ionic bonding with some metallic contribution. The optical
parameters have been studied in detail. The optical spectra reveal metallic
features. The compound reflects visible light very efficiently (reflectance
above 60%). It is also an efficient absorber of the ultraviolet light. The
compound exhibits significant optical anisotropy with respect to the
polarization directions of the incident electric field.

Layered metal-rich subsulfides have become a promising area for exploring
intriguing properties such as superconductivity, nontrivial topology, and
charge density waves; however, despite their extraordinary potential, they have
remained largely unexplored. We report a comprehensive analysis of a van der
Waals layered metal-rich subsulfide, Nb$_{1.7}$Ta$_{3.3}$S$_2$, using a range
of measuring techniques, including AC transport, magnetization, and specific
heat. Our measurements confirm the occurrence of a type-II superconducting
transition at a temperature of approximately $T_c$ = 3.64(1) K. Furthermore,
specific heat measurements suggest weakly coupled, nodeless superconductivity.

<br>
<br>
We theoretically study spin pumping from a ferromagnetic insulator (FI) into
a carbon nanotube (CNT). By employing the bosonization method, we formulate the
Gilbert damping induced by the FI/CNT junction, which can be measured by
ferromagnetic resonance. We show that the increase in the Gilbert damping has a
temperature dependence characteristic of a Luttinger liquid and is highly
sensitive to the Luttinger parameter of the spin sector for a clean interface.
We also discuss the experimental relevance of our findings based on numerical
estimates, using realistic parameters.

<br>
<br>
The fluctuations of the electromagnetic field are at the origin of the
near-field radiative heat transfer between nanostructures, as well as the
Casimir forces and torques that they exert on each other. Here, working within
the formalism of fluctuational electrodynamics, we investigate the simultaneous
transfer of energy and angular momentum in a pair of rotating nanostructures.
We demonstrate that, due to the rotation of the nanostructures, the radiative
heat transfer between them can be increased, decreased, or even reversed with
respect to the transfer that occurs in absence of rotation, which is solely
determined by the difference in the temperature of the nanostructures. This
work unravels the unintuitive phenomena arising from the simultaneous transfer
of energy and angular momentum in pairs of rotating nanostructures.

The multi-terminal generalization of the steady-state density functional
theory for the description of electronic and thermal transport (iq-DFT) is
presented. The linear response regime of the framework is developed leading to
exact expressions for the many-body transport coefficients and thermoelectric
efficiency purely in terms of quantities accessible to the framework. The
theory is applied to a multi-terminal interacting quantum dot in the Coulomb
blockade regime for which accurate parametrizations of the exchange-correlation
kernel matrix are given. The thermoelectric efficiency and output power of the
multi-terminal system are studied. Surprisingly, the strong-interaction limit
of these quantities can be understood in terms of the non-interacting one.

<h3>Multi player Parrondo games with rigid coupling</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
In a Parrondo game, a single player combines two losing strategies to a
winning strategy. In this paper we investigate the question what happens, if
two or more players play Parrondo games in a coordinated way. We introduce a
strong coupling between the player such that the gain or loss of all players in
one round is the same. We investigate two possible realizations of such a
coupling. For both we show that the coupling increases the gain per player. The
dependency of the gain on the various parameters of the games is determined.
The coupling can not only lead to a larger gain, but it can also dominate the
driving mechanism of the uncoupled games. Which driving mechanism dominates,
depends on the type of coupling. Both couplings are set side by side and the
main similarities and differences are emphasised.

<h3>Chemical disorder induced electronic orders in correlated metals</h3>

<br>
<i>Jinning Hou, Yuting Tan, Wei Ku</i>
<br>
<br>
In strongly correlated metals, long-range magnetic order is sometimes found
only upon introduction of a minute amount of $disordered$ non-magnetic
impurities to the unordered clean samples. To explain such anti-intuitive
behavior, we propose a scenario of inducing electronic (magnetic, orbital, or
charge) order via chemical disorder in systems with coexisting local moments
and itinerant carriers. By disrupting the damaging long-range quantum
fluctuation originating from the itinerant carriers, the electronic order
preferred by the local moment can be re-established. We demonstrate this
mechanism using a realistic spin-fermion model and show that the magnetic order
can indeed be recovered as a result of enhanced disorder once the length scale
of phase coherence of the itinerant carriers becomes shorter than a critical
value. The proposed simple idea has a general applicability to strongly
correlated metals, and it showcases the rich physics resulting from the
interplay between mechanisms of multiple length scales.

Key experimental results on unveiling and studying properties of a multiphase
state that arises in two-dimensional electron systems due to the interplay of
interelectron interactions and disorder are reviewed. The review focuses on the
experimental results obtained with high mobility Si-field effects structures
(Si-MOS), in which the interaction effects at low carrier concentrations are
most pronounced due to the strong e-e interactions, multi-valley spectrum, and
the short-range character of the random potential. The reviewed effects of
phase separation include features in transport, magnetotransport and
thermodynamics. Consideration of a number of experimental results is
supplemented with a brief review of their theoretical interpretation.

<br>
<br>
Liquid crystals can self-organize into a layered smectic phase. While in bulk
the smectic layers are typically straight forming a lamellar pattern, external
confinement may drastically distort the layers due to the boundary conditions
imposed on the orientational director field. Resolving this distortion leads to
complex structures with topological defects. Here, we explore the
configurations adopted by two-dimensional smectic liquid crystals of rod-like
particles in complex confinements characterized by a button-like structure with
two internal boundaries (inclusions): a two-holed disk and a double annulus.
The topology of the confinement generates new structures which we classify as
generalized laminar and generalized Shubnikov states. To explore these
configurations, we combine particle-resolved experiments on colloidal rods with
three complementary theoretical approaches: Monte-Carlo simulation,
first-principles density functional theory and phenomenological
$\mathbf{Q}$-tensor modeling. This yields a consistent and comprehensive
description of the structural details. In particular, we characterize a
nontrivial tilt angle between the direction of the layers and symmetry axes of
the confinement.

<h3>Vascular adaptation model]{Vascular adaptation model from force balance:  \textit{Physarum polycephalum} as a case study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01439" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01439</a>
<br>
<i>Sophie Marbach, Noah Ziethen, Karen Alim</i>
<br>
<br>
Understanding vascular adaptation, namely what drives veins to shrink or
grow, is key for the self-organization of flow networks and their optimization.
From the top-down principle of minimizing flow dissipation at a fixed metabolic
cost within flow networks, flow shear rate resulting from the flows pervading
veins is hypothesized to drive vein adaptation. Yet, there is no bottom-up
derivation of how flow forces impact vein dynamics. From the physical principle
of force balance, shear rate acts parallel to vein walls, and hence, naively
shear rate could only stretch veins and not dilate or shrink them. We, here,
resolve this paradox by theoretically investigating force balance on a vein
wall in the context of the vascular network of the model organism Physarum
polycephalum. We propose, based on previous mechanical studies of cross-linked
gels, that shear induces a nonlinear, anisotropic response of the actomyosin
gel, making up vein walls that can indeed drive vein dilatation. Furthermore,
our force balance approach allows us to identify that shear feedback occurs
with a typical timescale and with a typical target shear rate that are not
universal properties of the material but instead depend smoothly on the
location of the vein within the network. In particular, the target shear rate
is related to the vein's hydrostatic pressure, which highlights the role of
pressure in vascular adaptation. Finally, since our derivation is based on
force balance and fluid mechanics, we believe our approach can be extended to
vascular adaptation in other organisms.

<h3>Competition between superconductivity and molecularization in quantum  nuclear behavior of Lanthanum Hydride</h3>

<br>
<i>Sebastiaan van de Bund, Graeme J. Ackland</i>
<br>
<br>
Lanthanum hydride is the superconductor with the highest known critical
temperature. It is believed that the superconductivity is of standard BCS-type,
with electrons forming Cooper pairs and opening the superconducting band gap.
Here we show that the BCS electron pairing is in competition with an
alternative pairing: covalent bonding. We show that the covalent pairing is
favored at lower pressures, the superconducting cubic phase becomes unstable as
pressure is reduced. Previous calculations based on static relaxation neglect
three factors, all of which are important in stabilizing the cubic phase.
Finite temperature plays a role, and two quantum effects are also important -
the nuclear wavefunction contributes to destablizing the H$_2$ molecules, and
the zero-point pressure means that calculated pressures are significantly
overestimated by standard methods. We demonstrate these phenomena using
Born-Oppenheimer and path-integral molecular dynamics: these give the same
qualitative picture, with nuclear quantum effects (NQE) increasing the
transition pressure significantly. This competition between molecularization
and superconducting gap formation is the fundamental reason why hydride
superconductors have so far been found only at high pressure.

<br>
Coupling together distinct correlated and topologically non-trivial
electronic phases of matter can potentially induce novel electronic orders and
phase transitions among them. Transition metal dichalcogenide compounds serve
as a bedrock for exploration of such hybrid systems. They host a variety of
exotic electronic phases and their Van der Waals nature enables to admix them,
either by exfoliation and stacking or by stoichiometric growth, and thereby
induce novel correlated complexes. Here we investigate the compound 4Hb-TaS$_2$
that interleaves the Mott-insulating state of 1T-TaS$_2$ and the putative spin
liquid it hosts together with the metallic state of 2H-TaS$_2$ and the low
temperature superconducting phase it harbors. We reveal a thermodynamic phase
diagram that hosts a first order quantum phase transition between a correlated
Kondo cluster state and a flat band state in which the Kondo cluster becomes
depleted. We demonstrate that this intrinsic transition can be induced by an
electric field and temperature as well as by manipulation of the interlayer
coupling with the probe tip, hence allowing to reversibly toggle between the
Kondo cluster and the flat band states. The phase transition is manifested by a
discontinuous change of the complete electronic spectrum accompanied by
hysteresis and low frequency noise. We find that the shape of the transition
line in the phase diagram is determined by the local compressibility and the
entropy of the two electronic states. Our findings set such heterogeneous
structures as an exciting platform for systematic investigation and
manipulation of Mott-metal transitions and strongly correlated phases and
quantum phase transitions therein.

We introduce and classify nonequivalent commensurate stackings for bilayer
dice or $\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice. For each of the four possible stackings, an
effective low-energy model is derived. Although the energy spectrum remains
always gapless with three bands interesting at the same point, depending on the
stacking, different types of quasiparticle spectra arise. They include those
with flat, tilted, anisotropic semi-Dirac, and three-fold-corrugated energy
bands. We use the derived models to calculate the density of states and the
spectral function. The corresponding results reveal drastic redistribution of
the spectral weight due to the inter-layer coupling that is unique for each of
the stackings.

<br>
<i>Kirill Alpin, Moritz M. Hirschmann, Niclas Heinsdorf, Andreas Leonhardt, Wan Yee Yau, Xianxin Wu, Andreas P. Schnyder</i>
<br>
<br>
We derive two fundamental laws of chiral band crossings: (i) a local
constraint relating the Chern number to phase jumps of rotation eigenvalues;
and (ii) a global constraint determining the number of chiral crossings on
rotation axes. Together with the fermion doubling theorem, these laws describe
all conditions that a network of chiral band crossing must satisfy. We apply
the fundamental laws to prove the existence of enforced double Weyl points,
nodal planes, and generic Weyl points, among others. In addition, we show that
chiral space-group symmetries cannot stabilize nodal lines with finite Chern
numbers. Combining the local constraint with explicit low-energy models, we
determine the generic topological phase diagrams of all multi-fold crossings.
Remarkably, we find a four-fold crossing with Chern number 5, which exceeds the
previously conceived maximum Chern number of 4. We identify BaAsPt as a
suitable material with this four-fold crossing exhibiting Chern number 5 near
the Fermi energy.
