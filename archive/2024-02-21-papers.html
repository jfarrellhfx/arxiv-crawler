<h3>A Classical Luttinger liquid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13283" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13283</a>
<br>
<i>Riccardo Fantoni</i>
<p>We propose a binary nonadditive Asakura-Oosawa-like mixture as an example for
the classical limit of a Luttinger liquid. We determine the equation of state
and structure of this mixture and discuss the paradoxical situation that one
faces when working with a quantum liquid without a ground state. We then
propose a new class of one dimensional classical fluids.

<h3>Photovoltaic performances in a cavity-coupled double quantum dots  photocell</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13300" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13300</a>
<br>
<i>Sheng-Qiang Zhong, Shun-Cai Zhao, Sheng-Nan Zhu</i>
<p>Revealing the quantum regime of photovoltaics is crucial to enhancing the
internal quantum efficiency of a double quantum dots (DQDs) photocell housed in
a cavity. In this study, the performance of a quantum photovoltaic is evaluated
based on the current-voltage and power-voltage characteristics in a
cavity-coupled DQDs photocell. The results show that the cavity-DQDs coupling
coefficient plays a dissipative role in the photovoltaic performance, and the
cavity has a limited size for the photovoltaic performance. Additionally, more
low-energy photons are easily absorbed by this cavity-coupled DQDs photocell
compared with the case without cavity. These results may provide some
strategies for improving the photoelectric conversion efficiency and internal
quantum efficiency of cavity-coupled DQDs photocells.

<h3>Identification of asbestos fibres from soil sediments in the Pilsen  region of the Czech Republic and the impact of these minerals on the health  of the local population</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13345" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13345</a>
<br>
<i>Štěpánka Jansová, Zdeněk Jansa, Lucie Nedvědová, Ján Minár</i>
<p>Asbestos is the term for silicate minerals with a typical fibrous structure
and crystallise as separable fibres that can be released into the environment
as a result of natural processes and anthropogenic activities. There is a need
to intensify geo-environmental monitoring of the occurrence of natural asbestos
on a global scale. The study of this material is important to clarify the
impact of asbestos on public health and to have an accurate knowledge of the
requirements for asbestos replacement materials. At present, the technical as
well as the ecological reasons for switching to these fibres are difficult, as
asbestos replacement materials are subject to considerable technological and
economic demands, as well as demands for their biological safety. The aim of
this paper is to summarize the current knowledge regarding the vast issue of
asbestos occurrence, to seek to establish an appropriate methodology for
detecting the presence of asbestos in soil sediments, to identify the exact
types of asbestos from a series of samples, to highlight its impact on public
health, and to emphasize the need for deliberate mapping of the natural
occurrence of asbestos and its inclusion in the laws and decrees of the
Ministry of the Environment. Samples were analysed by electron microscopy and
X-ray diffraction and compared with standards or available literature. The
measurements demonstrated the presence of asbestos in the site sediments and
identified specific types of asbestos. The conclusion of this work is the
confirmation of the presence of asbestos in all samples, including its most
dangerous types, which can cause very serious diseases. In this context, the
mechanism of asbestos-related diseases will be further addressed, which is
linked to the size and shape of the individual fibres, the chemical composition
of the asbestos types and the links between their basic structural units.

<h3>Low frequency resistance fluctuations in an ionic liquid gated channel  probed by cross-correlation noise spectroscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13363" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13363</a>
<br>
<i>Bikash C. Barik, Himadri Chakraborti, Aditya K. Jain, Buddhadeb Pal, H.E. Beere, D.A. Ritchie, K. Das Gupta</i>
<p>A system in equilibrium keeps ``exploring" nearby states in the phase space
and consequently, fluctuations can contain information, that the mean value
does not. However, such measurements involve a fairly complex interplay of
effects arising in the device and measurement electronics, that are non-trivial
to disentangle. In this paper, we briefly analyse some of these issues and show
the relevance of a two-amplifier cross-correlation technique for semiconductors
and thin films commonly encountered. We show that by using home-built
amplifiers costing less than $10$ USD/piece one can measure spectral densities
as low as $\sim 10^{-18}-10^{-19}~ {\rm {V^2}{Hz^{-1}}}$. We apply this method
to an ionic liquid gated Ga:ZnO channel and show that the glass transition of
the ionic liquid brings about a change in the exponent of the low frequency
resistance fluctuations. Our analysis suggests that a log-normal distribution
of the Debye relaxation times of the fluctuations and an increased weight of
the long timescale relaxations can give a semi-quantitative explanation of the
observed change in the exponent.

<h3>Induced supersolidity and hypersonic flow of a dipolar Bose-Einstein  Condensate in a rotating bubble trap</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13422" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13422</a>
<br>
<i>Hari Sadhan Ghosh, Soumyadeep Halder, Subrata Das, Sonjoy Majumder</i>
<p>Motivated by the recent realization of space-borne Bose-Einstein Condensate
(BEC) under micro-gravity conditions, we extend the understanding of ultracold
dipolar bosonic gases by exploring their behavior in a novel trapping
configuration known as the ``bubble trap" topology. Utilizing the
three-dimensional numerical simulations within the extended Gross-Pitaevskii
framework, we unveil diverse ground state phases in such a static curved
topology. Subsequently, we investigate the influence of rotation on a dipolar
BEC confined to the surface of a spherical bubble. Our findings reveal that the
rotation of a bubble trap with certain rotation frequencies can modify the
effective local dipole-dipole interaction strength, leading to the induction of
supersolidity and the formation of quantum droplets. In addition, we
demonstrate that a bubble trap can sustain high circulation and the flow also
persists for a longer time. Significantly, adjusting the rf detuning parameter
allows the condensate to achieve hypersonic velocity. Finally, we explore the
impact of drastic change in the topological nature of the trap on the rotating
dipolar BEC, transitioning from a filled shell trap to a bubble trap and vice
versa.

<h3>Magnetotransport Signatures of the Radial Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling in  Proximitized Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13424" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13424</a>
<br>
<i>Wun-Hao Kang, Michael Barth, Aitor Garcia-Ruiz, Alina Mreńca-Kolasińska, Ming-Hao Liu, Denis Kochan</i>
<p>Graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures take advantage of tailoring
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the graphene layer by proximity effect. At
long-wavelength -- saddled by the electronic states near the Dirac points --
the proximitized features can be effectively modelled by the Hamiltonian
involving novel SOC terms and allow for an admixture of the tangential and
radial spin textures -- by the so-called Rashba angle $\theta_{\text{R}}$.
Taking such effective models we perform realistic large-scale magneto-transport
calculations -- transverse magnetic focusing and Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation
-- and show that there are unique qualitative and quantitative features
allowing for an unbiased experimental disentanglement of the conventional
Rashba SOC from its novel radial counterpart, called here the radial Rashba
SOC. Along with that, we propose a scheme for a direct estimation of the Rashba
angle by exploring the magneto-response symmetries when swapping an in-plane
magnetic field. To complete the story, we analyze the magneto-transport
signatures in the presence of an emergent Dresselhaus SOC and also provide some
generic ramifications about possible scenarios of the radial superconducting
diode effect.

<h3>Universal equation describes the shape of air bubbles trapped in ice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13456" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13456</a>
<br>
<i>Virgile Thiévenaz, Alban Sauret</i>
<p>Water usually contains dissolved gases, and because freezing is a purifying
process these gases must be expelled for ice to form. Bubbles appear at the
freezing front and are trapped into ice, making pores. These pores come in a
range of sizes from microns to millimeters and their shapes are peculiar; never
spherical but elongated, and usually fore-aft asymmetric. We show that these
remarkable shapes result of a delicate balance between freezing, capillarity
and mass diffusion. A highly non-linear ordinary differential equation suffices
to describe the bubbles, with only two non-dimensional parameters representing
the supersaturation and the freezing rate. Our experiments provide us with a
large variety of pictures of bubble shapes. We show that all of them have their
rounded tip well described by an asymptotic regime of the differential
equation, and that most of them can have their full shape quantitatively
matched by a full solution. This enables the measurement of the freezing
conditions of ice samples, and the design of freeze-cast porous materials.
Furthermore, the equation exhibits a bifurcation that explains why some bubbles
grow indefinitely and make long cylindrical ``ice worms''.

<h3>Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with  wavelength-tunable pump and extreme ultraviolet probe enabled by twin  synchronized amplifiers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13460" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13460</a>
<br>
<i>Takeshi Suzuki, Yigui Zhong, Kecheng Liu, Teruto Kanai, Jiro Itatani, Kozo Okazaki</i>
<p>We describe a setup for time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
with wavelength-tunable excitation and extreme ultraviolet probe. It is enabled
by using the 10 kHz twin Ti:sapphire amplifiers seeded by the common
Ti:sapphire oscillator. The typical probe energy is 21.7 eV, and the wavelength
of the pump excitation is tuned between 2400 and 1200 nm by using the optical
parametric amplifier. The total energy resolution of 133 meV is achieved, and
the time resolution is dependent on the wavelength for the pump, typically
better than 100 fs. This system enables the pump energy to be matched with a
specific interband transition and to probe a wider energy-momentum space. We
present the results for the prototypical materials of highly oriented pyrolytic
graphite and Bi2Se3 to show the performance of our system.

<h3>Thermal transport in a 2D amorphous material</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13471" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13471</a>
<br>
<i>Yuxi Wang, Xingxing Zhang, Wujuan Yan, Nianjie Liang, Haiyu He, Xinwei Tao, Ang Li, Fuwei Yang, Buxuan Li, Te-Huan Liu, Jia Zhu, Wu Zhou, Wei Wang, Lin Zhou, Bai Song</i>
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) crystals proved revolutionary soon after graphene was
discovered in 2004. However, 2D amorphous materials only became accessible in
2020 and remain largely unexplored. In particular, the thermophysical
properties of amorphous materials are of great interest upon transition from 3D
to 2D. Here, we probe thermal transport in 2D amorphous carbon. A cross-plane
thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) down to 0.079 $\rm{Wm}^{-1}K^{-1}$ is measured
for van der Waals stacked multilayers at room temperature, which is among the
lowest reported to date. Meanwhile, an unexpectedly high in-plane $\kappa$ is
obtained for freestanding monolayers which is a few times larger than what is
predicted by conventional wisdom for 3D amorphous carbon with similar
$\rm{sp}^{2}$ fraction. Our molecular dynamics simulations reveal the role of
disorder and highlight the impact of dimensionality. Amorphous materials at the
2D limit open up new avenues for understanding and manipulating heat at the
atomic scale.

<h3>Field-induced electric polarization and elastic softening caused by  parity-mixed $d$-$p$ hybridized states with electric multipoles in  Ba$_2$CuGe$_2$O$_7$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13504" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13504</a>
<br>
<i>R. Kurihara, Y. Sato, A. Miyake, M. Akaki, K. Mitsumoto, M. Hagiwara, H. Kuwahara, M. Tokunaga</i>
<p>We performed high-magnetic-field magnetization, polarization, and ultrasonic
measurements in Ba$_2$CuGe$_2$O$_7$ to investigate field-induced multiferroic
properties arising from a cross-correlation between electric dipoles and
electric quadrupoles in addition to cross-correlation between magnetic dipoles
and electric dipoles. Magnetization $M$ shows saturation behavior above 20 T
for several magnetic field directions, however, electric polarization $P_c$
exhibits an increase, and elastic constants show a softening above 20 T. Based
on quantum states with a crystalline electric field for the $D_{2d}$ point
group and $d$-$p$ hybridization between Cu-$3d$ and O-$2p$ electrons, we
confirmed that the matrix of an electric dipole $P_z$ was proportional to that
of an electric quadrupole $O_{xy}$. Furthermore, considering the spin-orbit
coupling of $3d$ electrons and the Zeeman effect, we showed that $P_z$ and
$O_{xy}$ simultaneously exhibited field-induced responses. These findings
indicate that the orbital degrees of freedom, in addition to the spin degrees
of freedom, contribute to the high-field multiferroicity in
Ba$_2$CuGe$_2$O$_7$.

<h3>Spin-selective transport in a correlated double quantum dot-Majorana  wire system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13515" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13515</a>
<br>
<i>Piotr Majek, Ireneusz Weymann</i>
<p>In this work we investigate the spin-dependent transport through a double
quantum dot embedded in a ferromagnetic tunnel junction and side attached to a
topological superconducting nanowire hosting Majorana zero-energy modes. We
focus on the transport regime when the Majorana mode leaks into the double
quantum dot competing with the two-stage Kondo effect and the
ferromagnetic-contact-induced exchange field. In particular, we determine the
system's spectral properties and analyze the temperature dependence of the
spin-resolved linear conductance by means of the numerical renormalization
group method. Our study reveals unique signatures of the interplay between the
spin-resolved tunneling, the Kondo effect and the Majorana modes, which are
visible in the transport characteristics. In particular, we uncover a competing
character of the coupling to topological superconductor and that to
ferromagnetic leads, which can be observed already for very low spin
polarization of the electrodes. This is signaled by an almost complete
quenching of the conductance in one of the spin channels which is revealed
through perfect conductance spin polarization. Moreover, we show that the
conductance spin polarization can change sign depending on the magnitude of
spin imbalance in the leads and strength of interaction with topological wire.
Thus, our work demonstrates that even minuscule spin polarization of tunneling
processes can have large impact on the transport properties of the system.

<h3>High-temperature stability of ambient-cured one-part alkali-activated  materials incorporating graphene for thermal energy storage</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13543" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13543</a>
<br>
<i>Nghia Tran, Tuan Nguyen, Jay Black, Tuan Ngo</i>
<p>In this research, the ambient cured one part alkali activated material (AAM)
containing graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), fly ash, slag and silica fume has
been investigated after high temperature exposure to 200 to 800oC. Their
compressive strength, thermal properties, microstructure, pore structure were
characterised through visual observation, isothermal calorimetry, TGA, XRD,
SEM-EDS and X-ray CT. The research findings indicated high strength
characteristics of the developed AAM (80 MPa) at ambient condition, which could
further reach to approx. 100 MPa after being heated up to 400oC. GNPs provided
nucleation effects for promoting geopolymerisation and crystallisation. As
observed from X-ray CT, a high extent of severe cracks initiated from the core
and propagated towards the surface. From SEM-EDS analysis, high Na-Al and Na-Si
ratios or low Si-Al and Ca-Si ratios highly correlated to thermal stability.
Overall, the research outcomes implied the promising use of the nano-engineered
AAMs for thermal energy storage (TES) at 400 to 600oC.

<br>
<i>X. Yu, J.-C. Weeber, L. Markey, J. Arocas, A. Bouhelier, A. Leray, G. Colas des Francs</i>
<p>Integrated quantum photonic circuits require the efficient coupling of photon
sources to photonic waveguides. Hybrid plasmonic/photonic platforms are a
promising approach, taking advantage of both plasmon modal confinement for
efficient coupling to a nearby emitter and photonic circuitry for optical data
transfer and processing. In this work, we established directional quantum dot
(QD) emission coupling to a planar TiO$_2$ waveguide assisted by a Yagi-Uda
antenna. Antenna on waveguide is first designed by scaling radio frequency
dimensions to nano-optics, taking into account the hybrid plasmonic/photonic
platform. Design is then optimized by full numerical simulations. We fabricate
the antenna on a TiO$_2$ planar waveguide and deposit a few QDs close to the
Yagi-Uda antenna. The optical characterization shows clear directional coupling
originating from antenna effect. We estimate the coupling efficiency and
directivity of the light emitted into the waveguide.

<h3>Mutual information scrambling in Ising spin chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13558" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13558</a>
<br>
<i>Surbhi Khetrapal, Emil Tore Mærsk Pedersen</i>
<p>We consider a chain of spin-half particles of a finite length, evolved with
the mixed-field Ising Hamiltonian and impose open boundary condition. We
simulate the time evolution of entanglement entropy and mutual information
following quench from the N\'eel state in this system using tensor networks. We
find that the entanglement entropy for non-integrable systems saturates to a
constant value at late times, however it continues to oscillate for integrable
systems. We also find that mutual information peaks as a function of distance
between intervals decay faster for non-integrable systems compared to
integrable systems, in agreement with the conclusion of \cite{Alba:2019ybw} for
XXZ chains. We compare the oscillations in entanglement entropy evolution
obtained from simulations in the integrable case with analytic results from
quasi-particle picture and find agreement.

<h3>Fabrication of high electron mobility and high photoluminescence quantum  yield nanoscrolled monolayer MoS2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13564" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13564</a>
<br>
<i>C. Abinash Bhuyan, Kishore K. Madapu, K. Prabakar, K. Ganesan, A. Pandian, Sandip Dhara</i>
<p>We fabricated the 1D nanoscrolled monolayer MoS2 (1L-MoS2) with superior
characteristics from 1L-MoS2 film in a facile route, using a suitable organic
solvent with optimum surface tension, evaporation rate and dielectric constant,
which facilitates the controlled scroll formation. These nanoscrolls behave as
multilayers in morphology and monolayer electronically. The nanoscrolls
exhibited a direct optical gap with enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield
stemming from the weak interlayer coupling among constituent layers and were
corroborated by low-frequency Raman measurements and Kelvin probe force
microscopy measurements. Furthermore, enhanced photoluminescence emission after
annealing uncovers the thermal stability of nanoscrolls. In addition,
conducting atomic force microscopy results exhibit a significantly higher
photocurrent in the nanoscrolled 1L-MoS2 compared to the 1L-MoS2. We also
realized significantly improved field effect transistor device parameters in
nanoscrolled 1L-MoS2 devices. In nanoscrolled devices, we report the highest
mobility value of 2400 cm2V-1s-1 reported in any form of 1L-MoS2.

<h3>Tunable topological phases in nanographene-based spin-1/2  alternating-exchange Heisenberg chains</h3>

<br>
<i>Chenxiao Zhao, Gonçalo Catarina, Jin-Jiang Zhang, João C. G. Henriques, Lin Yang, Ji Ma, Xinliang Feng, Oliver Gröning, Pascal Ruffieux, Joaquín Fernández-Rossier, Roman Fasel</i>
<p>Unlocking the potential of topological order within many-body spin systems
has long been a central pursuit in the realm of quantum materials. Despite
extensive efforts, the quest for a versatile platform enabling site-selective
spin manipulation, essential for tuning and probing diverse topological phases,
has persisted. Here, we utilize on-surface synthesis to construct spin-1/2
alternating-exchange Heisenberg (AH) chains[1] with antiferromagnetic couplings
$J_1$ and $J_2$ by covalently linking Clar's goblets -- nanographenes each
hosting two antiferromagnetically-coupled unpaired electrons[2]. Utilizing
scanning tunneling microscopy, we exert atomic-scale control over the spin
chain lengths, parities and exchange-coupling terminations, and probe their
magnetic response by means of inelastic tunneling spectroscopy. Our
investigation confirms the gapped nature of bulk excitations in the chains,
known as triplons[3]. Besides, the triplon dispersion relation is successfully
extracted from the spatial variation of tunneling spectral amplitudes.
Furthermore, depending on the parity and termination of chains, we observe
varying numbers of in-gap $S=1/2$ edge spins, enabling the determination of the
degeneracy of distinct topological ground states in the thermodynamic
limit-either 1, 2, or 4. By monitoring interactions between these edge spins,
we identify the exponential decay of spin correlations. Our experimental
findings, corroborated by theoretical calculations, present a phase-controlled
many-body platform, opening promising avenues toward the development of
spin-based quantum devices.

<h3>Convergence Acceleration of Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based Gradient  Descent by Deep Unfolding</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13608" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13608</a>
<br>
<i>Ryo Hagiwara, Satoshi Takabe</i>
<p>This study proposes a trainable sampling-based solver for combinatorial
optimization problems (COPs) using a deep-learning technique called deep
unfolding. The proposed solver is based on the Ohzeki method that combines
Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) and gradient descent, and its step sizes are
trained by minimizing a loss function. In the training process, we propose a
sampling-based gradient estimation that substitutes auto-differentiation with a
variance estimation, thereby circumventing the failure of back propagation due
to the non-differentiability of MCMC. The numerical results for a few COPs
demonstrated that the proposed solver significantly accelerated the convergence
speed compared with the original Ohzeki method.

<h3>Quantification of chirality based on electric toroidal monopole</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13611" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13611</a>
<br>
<i>Akane Inda, Rikuto Oiwa, Satoru Hayami, Hiroshi M Yamamoto, Hiroaki Kusunose</i>
<p>Chirality ubiquitously appears in nature, however, its quantification remains
obscure owing to the lack of microscopic description at the quantum-mechanical
level. We propose a way of evaluating chirality in terms of electric toroidal
monopole, a practical entity of time-reversal even pseudoscalar (parity-odd)
object reflecting relevant electronic wave functions. For this purpose, we
analyze a twisted methane at the quantum-mechanical level, showing that the
electric toroidal monopoles become a quantitative indicator for chirality. In
the twisted methane, we clarify that the handedness of chirality corresponds to
the sign of the expectation value of the electric toroidal monopole, and that
the most important ingredient is the modulation of the spin-dependent imaginary
hopping between the hydrogen atoms, while the relativistic spin-orbit coupling
within the carbon atom is irrelevant for chirality.

<h3>Sliding-mediated ferroelectric phase transition in CuInP2S6 under  pressure</h3>

<p>Interlayer stacking order has recently emerged as a unique degree of freedom
to control crystal symmetry and physical properties in two-dimensional van der
Waals (vdW) materials and heterostructures. By tuning the layer stacking
pattern, symmetry-breaking and electric polarization can be created in
otherwise non-polar crystals, whose polarization reversal depends on the
interlayer sliding motion. Herein, we demonstrate that in a vdW layered
ferroelectric, its existing polarization is closely coupled to the interlayer
sliding driven by hydrostatic pressure. Through combined structural,
electrical, vibrational characterizations, and theoretical calculations, we
clearly map out the structural evolution of CuInP2S6 under pressure. A tendency
towards a high polarization state is observed in the low-pressure region,
followed by an interlayer-sliding-mediated phase transition from a monoclinic
to a trigonal phase. Along the transformation pathway, the displacive-instable
Cu ion serves as a pivot point that regulates the interlayer interaction in
response to external pressure. The rich phase diagram of CuInP2S6, which is
enabled by stacking orders, sheds light on the physics of vdW ferroelectricity
and opens an alternative route to tailoring long-range order in vdW layered
crystals.

<p>A time crystal is an exotic phase of matter where time-translational symmetry
is broken; this phase differs from the spatial symmetry breaking induced in
crystals in space. Lots of experiments report the transition from a thermal
equilibrium phase to time crystal phase. However, there is no experimental
method to probe the bifurcation effect of distinct time crystals in quantum
many-body systems. Here, in a driven and dissipative many-body Rydberg atom
system, we observe multiple continuous dissipative time crystals and emergence
of more complex temporal symmetries beyond the single time crystal phase.
Bifurcation of time crystals in strongly interacting Rydberg atoms is observed;
the process manifests as a transition from a time crystal state of long
temporal order to one of short temporal order, or vice versa. By manipulating
the driving field parameters, we observe the time crystal's bistability and a
hysteresis loop. These investigations indicate new possibilities for control
and manipulation of the temporal symmetries of non-equilibrium systems.

<p>Higher-order and fractional discrete time crystals (DTCs) are exotic phases
of matter where the discrete time translation symmetry is broken into
higher-order and non-integer category. Generation of these unique DTCs has been
widely studied theoretically in different systems. However, no current
experimental methods can probe these higher-order and fractional DTCs in any
quantum many-body systems. We demonstrate an experimental approach to observe
higher-order and fractional DTCs in Floquet-driven Rydberg atomic gases. We
have discovered multiple $n$-DTCs with integer values of $n$ = 2, 3, and 4, and
others ranging up to 14, along with fractional $n$-DTCs with $n$ values beyond
the integers. The system response can transition between adjacent integer DTCs,
during which the fractional DTCs are investigated. Study of higher-order and
fractional DTCs expands fundamental knowledge of non-equilibrium dynamics and
is promising for discovery of more complex temporal symmetries beyond the
single discrete time translation symmetry.

<i>Jacopo D'Alberto, Lorenzo Cardarelli, Davide Emilio Galli, Gianluca Bertaina, Pierbiagio Pieri</i>
<p>We derive analytically the leading beyond-mean field contributions to the
zero-temperature equation of state and to the fermionic quasi-particle residue
and effective mass of a dilute Bose-Fermi mixture in two dimensions. In the
repulsive case, we perform quantum Monte Carlo simulations for two
representative bosonic concentrations and equal masses, extending a method for
correcting finite-size effects in fermionic gases to Bose-Fermi mixtures. We
find good agreement between analytic expressions and numerical results for weak
interactions, while significant discrepancies appear in the regime close to
mechanical instability, above which we provide evidence of phase separation of
the bosonic component.

<p>The influence of the channel shape in a junctionless silicon-on-insulator
finned field-effect transistor (JL SOI FinFET) on the amplitude of random
telegraph noise (RTN) induced by single interface trapped charge has been
simulated for the transistors with rectangular, trapezoidal, and triangular fin
cross sections. The simulation of the RTN amplitude distribution along the
channel induced by a single charge trapped at interface defect located at the
fin top and at sidewall of JL SOI FinFETs with channels of different shapes is
considered. It is established that at trapping the single charge at sidewall
surface of the channel, the lowest RTN amplitude is seen for the triangular
cross-section and the highest for the rectangular and trapezoidal
cross-sections. At the single charge trapping at the top surface of the
channel, the RTN amplitude is higher for the rectangle than for the trapezoidal
cross-section.

<h3>Reentrant condensation of sparsely charged polyelectrolytes induced by  multivalent salts: Interplay between electrostatic and non-electrostatic  interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13686" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13686</a>
<br>
<i>Huaisong Yong, Bilin Zhuang, Sissi de Beer</i>
<p>We study the reentrant condensation of sparsely charged polyelectrolytes in
dilute solutions of multivalent ions, whose phase-transition mechanism remains
under debate. We propose a mean-field model by recasting the concept of a
"physical crosslinking" effect, which can predict the essential features of the
reentrant condensation including the phase diagram of sparsely charged
polyelectrolyte. The model unveils that the strong adsorption between the ionic
monomers and multivalent ions can be at the origin of the peculiar phenomenon
that rather low concentrations of multivalent salts trigger both collapse and
re-entry transitions. The analytical solution of the model indicates that a
minimum of coupling energy due to sharing multivalent salt ions between ionic
monomers is essential for a phase transition to occur, which can explain the
enigmatic observation that the sparsely charged polyelectrolytes can only show
phase transition in a dilute solution of salts with selective multivalency. Our
analytical calculations also show that the incompatibility of the uncharged
moieties of the polyelectrolytes with solvent (water) is critical to regulate
phase behaviors of sparsely charged polyelectrolytes in aqueous solutions. This
is in agreement with recent experimental investigations on solution properties
of amphiphilic proteins. We envisage that this work will shed light on the
understanding of reentrant condensation in biological processes where the
multivalent ions bound to biopolymers (such as RNAs and proteins) plays an
essential role, which remains understood poorly.

<h3>Totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with local resetting and  open boundary conditions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13698" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13698</a>
<br>
<i>Alessandro Pelizzola, Marco Pretti</i>
<p>We study a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with open boundary
conditions and local resetting at the injection node. We investigate the
stationary state of the model, using both mean-field approximation and kinetic
Monte Carlo simulations, and identify three regimes, depending on the way the
resetting rate scales with the lattice size. The most interesting regime is the
intermediate resetting one, as in the case of periodic boundary conditions. In
this regime we find pure phases and phase separation phenomena, including a
low-density/high-density phase separation, which was not possible with periodic
boundary conditions. We discuss density profiles, characterizing bulk regions
and boundary layers, and nearest-neighbour covariances, finding a remarkable
agreement between mean-field and simulation results. The stationary state phase
diagram is mapped out analytically at the mean-field level, but we conjecture
that it may be exact in the thermodynamic limit. We also briefly discuss the
large resetting regime, which exhibits an inverse characteristic length scale
diverging logarithmically with the lattice size.

<h3>Laplace's first law of errors applied to diffusive motion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13733" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13733</a>
<br>
<i>Omer Hamdi, Stanislav Burov, Eli Barkai</i>
<p>In biological, glassy, and active systems, various tracers exhibit
Laplace-like, i.e., exponential, spreading of the diffusing packet of
particles. The limitations of the central limit theorem in fully capturing the
behaviors of such diffusive processes, especially in the tails, have been
studied using the continuous time random walk model. For cases when the jump
length distribution is super-exponential, e.g., a Gaussian, we use large
deviations theory and relate it to the appearance of exponential tails. When
the jump length distribution is sub-exponential the packet of spreading
particles is described by the big jump principle. We demonstrate the
applicability of our approach for finite time, indicating that rare events and
the asymptotics of the large deviations rate function can be sampled for large
length scales within a reasonably short measurement time.

<h3>Testing Outlier Detection Algorithms for Identifying Early-Stage Solute  Clusters in Atom Probe Tomography</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13734" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13734</a>
<br>
<i>R S. Stroud, A. Al-Saffar, M. Carter, M P. Moody, S. Pedrazzini, M R. Wenman</i>
<p>Atom probe tomography is commonly used to study solute clustering and
precipitation in materials. However, standard techniques, such as the density
based spatial clustering applications with noise (DBSCAN) perform poorly with
respect to small clusters of less than 25 atoms. This is a fundamental
limitation of density-based clustering techniques due to the usage of Nmin, an
arbitrary lower limit placed on cluster sizes. Therefore, this paper attempts
to consider atom probe clustering as an outlier detection problem of which KNN,
LOF, LUNAR algorithms were tested against a simulated dataset and compared to
the standard method, for a range of cluster sizes. The decision score output of
the algorithms was then auto thresholded by the Karcher mean to remove human
bias. Each of the major models tested outperforms DBSCAN for cluster sizes of
less than 25 atoms but underperforms for sizes greater than 30 atoms. However,
the new combined kNN and DBSCAN method presented was able to perform well at
all cluster sizes. The combined kNN and DBSCAN method is presented as a
possible new standard approach to identifying solute clusters in atom probe
tomography.

<h3>Multi-step topological transitions among meron and skyrmion crystals in  a centrosymmetric magnet</h3>

<i>H. Yoshimochi, R. Takagi, J. Ju, N. D. Khanh, H. Saito, H. Sagayama, H. Nakao, S. Itoh, Y. Tokura, T. Arima, S. Hayami, T. Nakajima, S. Seki</i>
<p>Topological swirling spin textures, such as skyrmions and merons, have
recently attracted much attention as a unique building block for high-density
magnetic information devices. The controlled transformation among different
types of such quasi-particles is an important challenge, while it was
previously achieved only in a few non-centrosymmetric systems characterized by
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Here, we report an experimental discovery of
multi-step topological transitions among a variety of meron and skyrmion
crystal states in a centrosymmetric magnet GdRu$_2$Ge$_2$. By performing the
detailed magnetic structure analysis based on resonant X-ray and neutron
scattering experiments as well as electron transport measurements, we have
found that this compound hosts periodic lattice of elliptic skyrmions,
meron/anti-meron pairs, and circular skyrmions as a function of external
magnetic field. The diameter of these objects is as small as 2.7 nm, which is
almost two orders of magnitude smaller than typical non-centrosymmetric
magnets. Such an intricate manner of topological magnetic transitions are well
reproduced by a theoretical model considering the competition between RKKY
interactions at inequivalent wave vectors. The present findings demonstrate
that even a simple centrosymmetric magnet with competing interactions can be a
promising material platform to realize a richer variety of nanometric magnetic
quasi-particles with distinctive symmetry and topology, whose stability may be
tunable by various external stimuli.

<h3>Critical Behavior and Collective Modes at the Superfluid Transition in  Amorphous Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13757" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13757</a>
<br>
<i>Vishnu Pulloor Kuttanikkad, Martin Puschmann, Rajesh Narayanan, Thomas Vojta</i>
<p>We investigate the critical behavior and the dynamics of the amplitude
(Higgs) mode close to the superfluid-insulator quantum phase transition in an
amorphous system (i.e., a system subject to topological randomness). In
particular, we map the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian defined on a
random Voronoi-Delaunay lattice onto a (2+1)-dimensional layered classical XY
model with correlated topological disorder. We study the resulting model by
laying recourse to classical Monte Carlo simulations. We specifically focus on
the scalar susceptibility of the order parameter to study the dynamics of the
amplitude mode. To do so, we harness the maximum entropy method to perform the
analytic continuation of the scalar susceptibility to real frequencies. Our
analysis shows that the amplitude mode remains delocalized in the presence of
such topological disorder, quite at odds with its behavior in generic
disordered systems, where the randomness localizes the Higgs mode. Furthermore,
we show that the critical behavior of the topologically disordered system is
identical to that of its translationally invariant counterpart, consistent with
a modified Harris criterion. This suggests that the localization of the
collective excitations in the presence of disorder is tied to the critical
behavior of the quantum phase transition rather than a simple
Anderson-localization-type interference mechanism.

<h3>Coupled exciton internal and center-of-mass motions in two-dimensional  semiconductors by a periodic electrostatic potential</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13759" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13759</a>
<br>
<i>Fujia Lu, Hongyi Yu</i>
<p>We theoretically investigated the coupling between the exciton internal and
center-of-mass motions in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides subjected
to a periodic electrostatic potential. The coupling leads to the emergence of
multiple absorption peaks in the exciton spectrum which are the hybridizations
of 1s, 2s and 2p$\pm$ Rydberg states with different center-of-mass momentums.
The energies and wave functions of hybrid states can be strongly modulated by
varying the profile of the periodic electrostatic potential, which well
reproduces the recent experimental observations. Combined with the
electron-hole exchange interaction, non-degenerate valley-coherent bright
excitons can be realized by applying an in-plane electric field, with the
valley coherence determined by the field direction.

<h3>Room-temperature sub-100 nm Néel-type skyrmions in non-stoichiometric  van der Waals ferromagnet $\rm Fe_{3-x}GaTe_{2}$ with ultrafast laser  writability</h3>

<p>Realizing room-temperature magnetic skyrmions in two-dimensional van der
Waals ferromagnets offers unparalleled prospects for future spintronic
applications. However, due to the intrinsic spin fluctuations that suppress
atomic long-range magnetic order and the inherent inversion crystal symmetry
that excludes the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, achieving
room-temperature skyrmions in 2D magnets remains a formidable challenge. In
this study, we target room-temperature 2D magnet $\rm Fe_3GaTe_2$ and unveil
that the introduction of iron-deficient into this compound enables spatial
inversion symmetry breaking, thus inducing a significant Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction that brings about room-temperature N\'eel-type skyrmions with
unprecedentedly small size. To further enhance the practical applications of
this finding, we employ a homemade in-situ optical Lorentz transmission
electron microscopy to demonstrate ultrafast writing of skyrmions in $\rm
Fe_{3-x}GaTe_2$ using a single femtosecond laser pulse. Our results manifest
the $\rm Fe_{3-x}GaTe_2$ as a promising building block for realizing
skyrmion-based magneto-optical functionalities.

<h3>State-dependent stiffness enhances wave propagation along elastic  filaments</h3>

<p>We study an elastic filament beating in a viscous fluid with
curvature-dependent bending stiffness. Our numerical and experimental
investigations reveal that such differential stiffness can sustain planar
bending waves far along flexible filaments. In particular, basal actuation is a
viable, parsimonious mechanism for generating high-amplitude planar bending
waves, in stark contrast to the uniform-stiffness case. Further, the resulting
beat patterns closely resemble the power-and-recovery strokes of propulsive
biological filaments, suggesting applications in robotic and engineered
systems.

<h3>Repulsive Casimir force from a Majorana zero-mode</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13862" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13862</a>
<br>
<i>C.W.J. Beenakker</i>
<p>Fu and Kane have taught us that a Majorana zero-mode appears on the quantum
spin Hall edge at the interface with a superconductor. If a magnetic scatterer
is placed on the edge, the zero-point energy of massless edge excitations
exerts a force on the scatterer. This is the fermionic analogue of the
electromagnetic Casimir effect. We show that the Majorana zero-mode produces a
repulsive Casimir force, pushing the scatterer away from the superconductor.
Unlike some other signatures of Majorana zero-modes, the repulsive Casimir
force is directly tied to the topological invariant of the system (the sign of
the determinant of the reflection matrix from the superconductor).

<h3>Emergent Phenomena with Broken Parity-Time Symmetry: Odd-order vs.  Even-order Effects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13875" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13875</a>
<br>
<i>Sang-Wook Cheong, Fei-Ting Huang</i>
<p>Symmetry often governs the laws of nature, and breaking symmetry accompanies
a new order parameter and emergent observable phenomena. Herein, we focus on
broken Parity (P)-Time (T) symmetry, which lifts the Kramers' degeneracy, and
thus, guarantees non-trivial spin textures in excitation spectra. To attain
non-zero measurables, we use the concept of symmetry operational similarity
(SOS), which consider the symmetry relationship between a specimen and an
experimental setup, rather than the symmetry of specific coupling terms. Even
without specific coupling terms, this SOS approach can tell if the relevant
phenomenon is a zero, non-zero odd-order or non-zero even-order effect. We
discuss systematically numerous steady-state physical phenomena, in which
breaking P-T symmetry is a necessary condition. These phenomena include
Odd-order or Even-order Anomalous Hall Effect, Optical activities, Directional
nonreciprocity in transverse magnetic field, Diagonal or Off-diagonal
current-induced magnetization (current can be associated with electrons,
phonons, or light), Diagonal or Off-diagonal piezomagnetism and
piezoelectricity. Some of these phenomena turn out to be conjugate to each
other through P to T. Our findings unveil numerous new non-traditional
candidate materials for various exotic physical phenomena, many of which have
never been realized in the standard coupling term/tensorial approaches, and are
a transformative and unconventional avenue for symmetry-guided materials
designs and discoveries.

<p>Phase winding effects in hollow semiconductor nanowires with superconducting
shells have been proposed as a route to engineer topological superconducting
states. We investigate GaAs/InAs core/shell nanowires with half-shells of
epitaxial aluminium as a potential platform for such devices, where the thin
InAs shell confines the electron wave function around the GaAs core. With
normal contacts we observed pronounced $h/e$ flux periodic oscillations in the
magnetoconductance, indicating the presence of a tubular conductive channel in
the InAs shell. Conversely, the switching current in Josephson junctions
oscillates with approximately half that period, i.e. $h/2e$, indicating
transport via Andreev transport processes in the junction enclosing threading
magnetic flux. On these structures, we systematically studied the gate-,
field-, and temperature-dependent evolution of the supercurrent. Results
indicate that Andreev transport processes can occur about the wire
circumference indicating full proximitization of the InAs shell from the
half-shell superconducting contacts.

<h3>Multigap superconductivity in lithium intercalated bilayer Mo$_2$C</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13886" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13886</a>
<br>
<i>Can Hong, Danhong Wu, Xi-Bo Li, Feipeng Zheng</i>
<p>Interlayer coupling can significantly influence the physical properties of
layered transition metal compounds. The superconductivity in layered Mo$_2$C
systems, belonging to the emergent family of MXene, has garnered considerable
attention. However, the impact of interlayer coupling on superconductivity, and
the anisotropic superconducting properties in these systems are not yet clear.
By performing first-principles calculations of electron-phonon coupling and
anisotropic superconducting properties, we show that the interlayer coupling in
bilayer 1$T$-Mo$_2$C suppresses superconductivity, resulting in a significant
drop in superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) from 4.2 $K$
in its monolayer form to nearly 0 $K$. By introducing lithium atoms into the
interlayer space of the bilayer, the interlayer coupling can be effectively
weakened, transforming the system into a two-gap superconductor with a
$T_{\mathrm{c}}$ above 10 $K$. A 3\% tensile strain can further transform the
system into a three-gap superconductor with a significantly enhanced
$T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of approximately 24.7 $K$, which is very high in the Mo$_2$C
related systems. The enhancement of the superconductivity induced by the strain
is mainly due to the downshift of an energy band with a flat dispersion to the
energy near the Fermi level. The in-plane vibrations of Mo atoms and the
$d$-orbital electrons of Mo atoms are most important for the formation of the
superconductivity. Our method can also be applied to multilayer Mo$_2$C
systems. Given the successful synthesis of layered Mo$_2$C systems and the
experimental realization of alkaline metal atom depositions, our work presents
a practically feasible strategy for achieving high $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ and
multigap superconductivity in layered Mo$_2$C.

<i>Willem Gispen, Jorge R. Espinosa, Eduardo Sanz, Carlos Vega, Marjolein Dijkstra</i>
<p>In this work, we introduce Variational Umbrella Seeding, a novel technique
for computing nucleation barriers. This new method, a refinement of the
original seeding approach, is independent on the choice of order parameter for
measuring the size of a nucleus. Consequently, it surpasses seeding in
accuracy, and Umbrella Sampling in computational speed. We test the method
extensively and demonstrate excellent accuracy for crystal nucleation of nearly
hard spheres and of two distinct models of water: mW and TIP4P/ICE. This method
can easily be extended to calculate nucleation barriers for homogeneous
melting, condensation, and cavitation.

<br>
<i>Jordan L. Hobbs, Calum J. Gibb, Ewan Cruickshank, Rebecca Walker, Richard J. Mandle</i>
<p>We present an approach for rapid conformational analysis of semi-flexible
liquid crystals. We use a simple graphical user interface (GUI) tool that
leverages rules-based methods for efficient generation of bend-angle
distributions, offering a significant improvement over traditional
single-conformer analysis. Our methods demonstrated proficiency in
approximating molecular shapes comparable to those obtained from molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations, albeit with notable deviations in the under sampling
of hairpin conformations and oversampling of extended configurations.
Re-evaluation of existing data revealed an apparent weak correlation between
NTB transition temperatures and bend angles, underscoring the complexity of
molecular shapes beyond mere geometry. Furthermore, we integrated this
conformational analysis into a pipeline of algorithmic molecular design,
utilizing a fragment-based genetic algorithm to generate novel
cyanobiphenyl-containing materials. This integration opens new avenues for the
exploration of liquid crystalline materials, particularly in systems where
systematic conformer searches are impractical, such as large oligomeric
systems. Our findings highlight the potential and growing importance of
computational approaches in accelerating the design and synthesis of
next-generation liquid crystalline materials.

<br>
<i>Valeriy A. Buryachenko</i>
<p>We consider a static peridynamic (proposed by Silling, see J. Mech. Phys.
Solids 2000; 48:175--209) composite materials (CMs) of both the random and
periodic structures. In the framework of the second background of
micromechanics (also called computational analytical micromechanics, CAM), one
proved that local micromechanics (LM) and peridynamic micromechanics (PM) are
formally similar to each other for CM of both random and periodic structures.
It allows straightforward generalization of LM methods to their PM
counterparts. It turns out that a plurality of micromechanics phenomena [e.g.
statistically homogeneous and inhomogeneous media, inhomogeneous loading
(inhomogeneous body force is included), nonlinear and nonlocal constitutive
laws of phases, and coupled physical phenomena] can be analyzed by one
universal tool (called CAM), which is sufficiently flexible and based on
physically clear hypotheses that can be modified and improved if necessary (up
to abandonment of these hypotheses) in the framework of a unique scheme for
analyses of a wide class of mentioned problems. The schemes of these approaches
are considered in the current paper.

<h3>Quantum spin Hall effect protected by spin U(1) quasi-symmetry</h3>

<br>
<i>Lu Liu, Yuntian Liu, Jiayu Li, Hua Wu, Qihang Liu</i>
<p>Quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, where electrons with opposite spin channels
are deflected to opposite sides of a two-dimensional system with a quantized
conductance, was believed to be characterized by a nontrivial topological index
$Z_{2}$. However, spin mixing effects in realistic materials often lead to
deviation of the spin Hall conductance from exact quantization. In this Letter,
we present a universal symmetry indicator for diagnosing QSH effect in
realistic materials, termed spin $U$(1) quasi-symmetry. Such a symmetry
eliminates the first-order spin-mixing perturbation and thus protects the
near-quantization of SHC, applicable to time-reversal-preserved cases with
either $Z_{2}=1$ or $Z_{2}=0$, as well as time-reversal-broken scenarios. We
propose that spin $U$(1) quasi-symmetry is hidden in the subspace spanned by
the doublets with unquenched orbital momentum and emerges when SOC is present,
which can be realized in 19 crystallographic point groups. Particularly, we
identify a previous overlooked even spin Chern phase with a trivial $Z_{2}$
index as an ideal platform for achieving a near-double-quantized SHC, as
exemplified by twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides and monolayer
RuBr$_{3}$. Our work offers a new perspective for understanding QSH effect and
significantly expands the material pool for the screening of exemplary material
candidates.

<h3>A General Theory of Static Response for Markov Jump Processes</h3>

<br>
<i>Timur Aslyamov, Massimiliano Esposito</i>
<p>We consider Markov jump processes on a graph described by a rate matrix that
depends on various control parameters. We derive explicit expressions for the
static responses of edge currents and steady-state probabilities. We show that
they are constrained by the graph topology (i.e. the incidence matrix) by
deriving response relations (i.e. linear constraints linking the different
responses) and topology-dependent bounds. For unicyclic networks, all scaled
current sensitivities are between zero and one and must sum to one. Applying
these results to stochastic thermodynamics, we derive explicit expressions for
the static response of fundamental currents (which carry the full dissipation)
to fundamental thermodynamic forces (which drive the system away from
equilibrium).

<i>Keenan E. Avers, Yun Suk Eo, Hyeok Yoon, Jarryd A. Horn, Shanta R. Saha, Alonso Suarez, Peter Zavalij, Johnpierre Paglione</i>
<p>FeSi is a curious example of a $d$-electron system that manifests many of the
same phenomena associated with $f$-electron Kondo insulators, including
conducting surface states with potentially non-trivial topology. Here we
investigate the magnetization and magnetotransport of these surface states and
how a 2D ferromagnetic state at the surface of FeSi influences the surface
conductivity. We confirm the 2D ferromagnetism via a systematic study of
magnetization on groups of filtered fragments with increasing surface
area-to-volume ratios, identifying characteristic temperatures and magnetic
fields associated with the ordered state. The paramagnetic to ferromagnetic
transition appears broadened, suggesting disorder, which allows spin
fluctuations to manifest up to at least 9 T at 2 K. This highlights the need to
understand the relation between the disorder of the 2D ferromagnetism and the
surface conductivity in FeSi.
