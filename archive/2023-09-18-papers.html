<h3>Surface directed spinodal decomposition of fluids confined in  cylindrical pore</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09511" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09511</a>

The surface directed spinodal decomposition of a binary liquid confined
inside cylindrical pore is investigated using molecular dynamics simulation.
One component of the liquid wets the pore surface while the other remains
neutral. A variety of wetting conditions are studied. For the partial wetting
case, after an initial period of phase separation, the domains organize
themselves into plug-like structure and the system enters into a metastable
state. Therefore, a complete phase separation is never achieved. Analysis of
domain growth and the structure factor suggests an one-dimensional growth
dynamics for partial wetting case. As the wetting interaction is increased
beyond a critical value, a transition from the plug-like to tube-like domain
formation is observed which corresponds to the full wetting morphology. Thus, a
complete phase separation is achieved as the wetting species moves towards the
pore surface and forms layers enclosing the non wetting species residing around
the axis of the cylinder. The coarsening dynamics of both the species are
studied separately. The wetting species is found to follow a two-dimensional
domain growth dynamics with a growth exponent 1/2 in the viscous hydrodynamic
regime. This was substantiated by the Porod tail of the structure factor. On
the other hand, the domain grows linearly with time for the non wetting
species. This suggests that the non wetting species behaves akin to a
three-dimensional bulk system. An appropriate reasoning is presented to justify
the given observations.

<h3>Interface stabilization in adhesion caused by elastohydrodynamic  deformation</h3>

Interfacial instabilities are common phenomena observed during adhesion
measurements involving viscoelastic polymers or fluids. Typical probe-tack
adhesion measurements with soft adhesives are conducted with rigid probes.
However, in many settings, such as for medical applications, adhesives make and
break contact from soft surfaces such as skin. Here we study how detachment
from soft probes alters the debonding mechanism of a model viscoelastic polymer
film. We demonstrate that detachment from a soft probe suppresses
Saffman-Taylor instabilities commonly encountered in adhesion. We suggest the
mechanism for interface stabilization is elastohydrodynamic deformation of the
probe and propose a scaling for the onset of stabilization.

Symmetry properties of the order parameter are among the most fundamental
characteristics of a superconductor. The pairing symmetry of recently
discovered heavy fermion superconductor UTe2 featuring an exceedingly large
upper critical field has attracted a great deal of attention. Even though it is
widely believed that UTe2 possesses an odd-parity, spin-triplet pairing
symmetry, direct evidence for it is lacking, especially at zero or low magnetic
fields. We report here the selection-rule results of Josephson coupling between
In, an s-wave superconductor, and UTe2. The orientation dependence of the
Josephson coupling suggests very strongly that UTe2 possess an odd-parity
pairing state of B_1u in zero magnetic fields. We also report the formation of
Andreev surface bound states on the (1-10) surface of UTe2.

<h3>Designing Moiré Patterns by Strain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08671" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08671</a>
<br>
<i>Federico Escudero, Andreas Sinner, Zhen Zhan, Pierre A. Pantaleón, Francisco Guinea</i>
<br>
<br>
Experiments conducted on two-dimensional twisted materials have revealed a
plethora of moir\'e patterns with different forms and shapes. The formation of
these patterns is usually attributed to the presence of small strains in the
samples, which typically arise during their fabrication. In this work we find
that the superlattice structure of such systems actually depends crucially on
the interplay between twist and strain. For systems composed of honeycomb
lattices, we show that this can lead to the formation of practically any
moir\'e geometry, even if each lattice is only slightly distorted. As a result,
we show that under strain the moir\'e Brillouin zone is not a stretched
irregular hexagon, but rather a primitive cell that changes according to the
geometry of the strained moir\'e vectors. We identify the conditions for the
formation of hexagonal moir\'e patterns arising solely due to shear or biaxial
strain, thus opening the possibility of engineering moir\'e patterns solely by
strain. Moreover, we study the electronic properties in such moir\'e patterns
and find that the strain tends to suppress the formation of the flat moir\'e
bands, even in the strain-induced hexagonal patterns analogous to those
obtained by the twist only.

<h3>A collinear-spin machine learned interatomic potential for  Fe\textsubscript{7}Cr\textsubscript{2}Ni alloy</h3>

<br>
<i>Lakshmi Shenoy, Christopher D. Woodgate, Julie B. Staunton, Albert P. Bartók, Charlotte S. Becquart, Christophe Domain, James R. Kermode</i>
<br>
<br>
We have developed a new machine learned interatomic potential for the
prototypical austenitic steel Fe$_{7}$Cr$_{2}$Ni, using the Gaussian
approximation potential (GAP) framework. This new GAP can model the alloy's
properties with higher accuracy than classical interatomic potentials like
embedded atom models (EAM), while also allowing us to collect much more
statistics than expensive first-principles methods like density functional
theory (DFT). We also extended the GAP input descriptors to approximate the
effects of collinear spins (Spin GAP), and demonstrate how this extended model
successfully predicts low temperature structural distortions due to the
antiferromagnetic spin state. We demonstrate the application of the Spin GAP
model for bulk properties and vacancies and validate against DFT. These results
are a step towards modelling ageing in austenitic steels with close to DFT
accuracy but at a fraction of its cost.

<h3>Antiferromagnetic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological metal near the  metal-insulator transition in MnS$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08712" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08712</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Antiferromagnetic (AFM) semiconductor MnS$_2$ possesses both high-spin and
low-spin magnetic phases that can be reversibly switched by applying pressure.
With increasing pressure, the high-spin state undergoes pressure-induced
metalization before transforming into a low-spin configuration, which is then
closely followed by a volume collapse and structural transition. We show that
the pressure driven band inversion is in fact topological, resulting in an
antiferromagnetic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological metal (Z2AFTM) phase with a small
gap and a Weyl metal phase at higher pressures, both of which precede the
spin-state crossover and volume collapse. In the Z2AFTM phase, the magnetic
order results in a doubling of the periodic unit cell, and the resulting
folding of the Brillouin zone leads to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant
protected by the persisting combined time-reversal and half-translation
symmetries. Such a topological phase was proposed theoretically by Mong, Essin,
and Moore in 2010 for a system with AFM order on a face-centered cubic (FCC)
lattice, which until now has not been found in the pool of real materials.
MnS$_2$ represents a realization of this original proposal through AFM order on
the Mn FCC sublattice. A rich phase diagram of topological and magnetic phases
tunable by pressure, establishes MnS$_2$ as a candidate material for exploring
magnetic topological phase transitions and for potential applications in AFM
spintronics.

<h3>Surface barrier effect as evidence of chiral soliton lattice formation  in chiral dichalcogenide CrTa$_{3}$S$_{6}$ crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08750" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08750</a>

<br>
<br>
The formation of chiral magnetic soliton lattice (CSL) is investigated in
monoaxial chiral dichalcogenide CrTa$_{3}$S$_{6}$ crystals in terms of a
surface barrier, which prevents a penetration of chiral solitons into the
system and is an intrinsic origin of hysteresis for the continuous phase
transition of nucleation-type, as discussed in the system of quantized vortices
in type-II superconductors. The magnetoresistance (MR) was examined with
microfabricated platelet samples in different dimensions with regard to the
$c$-axis direction of the crystal. The CSL formation was confirmed by the
discrete MR changes, reflecting the number of chiral solitons, as well as by
the presence of surface barrier, recognized as a fixed ratio of critical
magnetic fields during the hysteresis field cycle. We also argue the influence
of the surface barrier in the bulk CrTa$_{3}$S$_{6}$ crystals.

<h3>Physics of the Majorana-superconducting qubit hybrids</h3>

<br>
Manipulation of decoupled Majorana zero modes (MZMs) could enable
topologically-protected quantum computing. However, the practical realization
of a large number of perfectly decoupled MZMs needed to perform nontrivial
quantum computation has proven to be challenging so far. Fortunately, even a
small number of imperfect MZMs can be used to qualitatively extend the behavior
of standard superconducting qubits, allowing for new approaches for noise
suppression, qubit manipulation and read-out. Such hybrid devices take
advantage of interplay of Cooper pair tunneling, coherent single electron
tunneling, and Majorana hybridization. Here we provide a qualitative
understanding of this system, give analytical results for its ground state
energy spanning full parameter range, and describe potential sensing
applications enabled by the interplay between Majorana and Cooper pair
tunneling.

<h3>Topological spin Hall effect in antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08763" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08763</a>
<br>
<i>Amir N. Zarezad, Józef Barnaś, Anna Dyrdał, Alireza Qaiumzadeh</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate topological Hall effects in a metallic antiferromagnetic (AFM)
thin film and/or at the interface of an AFM insulator-normal metal bilayer with
a single skyrmion in the diffusive regime. To determine the spin and charge
Hall currents, we employed a Boltzmann kinetic equation with both
spin-dependent and spin-flip scatterings. The interaction between conduction
electrons and static skyrmions is included in the Boltzmann equation via the
corresponding emergent magnetic field arising from the skyrmion texture. We
compute intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to the topological spin Hall
effect and spin accumulation, induced by an AFM skyrmion. We show that although
the spin Hall current vanishes rapidly outside the skyrmion, the spin
accumulation can be finite at the edges far from the skyrmion, provided the
spin diffusion length is longer than the skyrmion radius. In addition, We show
that in the presence of a spin-dependent relaxation time, the topological
charge Hall effect is finite and we determine the corresponding Hall voltage.
Our results may help to explore antiferromagnetic skyrmions by electrical means
in real materials.

<h3>Scaling regimes and fluctuations of observables in computer glasses  approaching the unjamming transition</h3>

<br>
Under decompression, disordered solids undergo an unjamming transition where
they become under-coordinated and lose their structural rigidity. The
mechanical and vibrational properties of these materials have been an object of
theoretical, numerical, and experimental research for decades. In the study of
low-coordination solids, understanding the behavior and physical interpretation
of observables that diverge near the transition is of particular importance.
Several such quantities are length scales ($\xi$ or $l$) that characterize the
size of excitations, the decay of spatial correlations, the response to
perturbations, or the effect of physical constraints in the boundary or bulk of
the material. Additionally, the spatial and sample-to-sample fluctuations
($\chi$) of macroscopic observables such as coordination number or elastic
moduli diverge approaching unjamming. Here, we discuss important connections
between all of these quantities, and present numerical results that
characterize the scaling properties of sample-to-sample standard deviations
$\chi$ in ensembles of low-coordination disordered sphere packings and spring
networks. Overall, we highlight three distinct scaling regimes and two
crossovers in $\chi_Z$ and $\chi_\mu$ ($\chi$ measured for the excess
coordination $\delta z$ and the shear modulus $\mu$ respectively) as a function
of system size $N$ and proximity to unjamming $\delta z$. Importantly,
$\chi_\mu$ has been linked to experimentally accessible quantities that relate
to sound attenuation and the density of vibrational states in glasses. We
investigate similarities and differences in the behavior of $\chi_Z$ and
$\chi_\mu$ near the transition and discuss the implications of our findings on
current literature, unifying findings in previous studies.

<h3>BioinspiredLLM: Conversational Large Language Model for the Mechanics of  Biological and Bio-inspired Materials</h3>

<br>
<br>
The study of biological materials and bio-inspired materials science is well
established; however, surprisingly little knowledge has been systematically
translated to engineering solutions. To accelerate discovery and guide
insights, an open-source autoregressive transformer large language model,
BioinspiredLLM, is reported. The model was finetuned with a corpus of over a
thousand peer-reviewed articles in the field of structural biological and
bio-inspired materials and can be prompted to actively and interactively recall
information, assist with research tasks, and function as an engine for
creativity. The model has proven by example that it is not only able to
accurately recall information about biological materials when queried but also
formulate biomaterials questions and answers that can evaluate its own
performance. BioinspiredLLM also has been shown to develop sound hypotheses
regarding biological materials design and remarkably so for materials that have
never been explicitly studied before. Lastly, the model showed impressive
promise in collaborating with other generative artificial intelligence models
in a workflow that can reshape the traditional materials design process. This
collaborative generative artificial intelligence method can stimulate and
enhance bio-inspired materials design workflows. Biological materials is at a
critical intersection of multiple scientific fields and models like
BioinspiredLLM help to connect knowledge domains.

<h3>Breakdown of sound in superfluid helium</h3>

Like elementary particles carry energy and momentum in the Universe,
quasiparticles are the elementary carriers of energy and momentum quanta in
condensed matter. And, like elementary particles, under certain conditions
quasiparticles can be unstable and decay, emitting pairs of less energetic
ones. Pitaevskii proposed that such processes exist in superfluid helium, a
quantum fluid where the very concept of quasiparticles was borne, and which
provided the first spectacular triumph of that concept. Pitaevskii's decays
have important consequences, including possible breakdown of a quasiparticle.
Here, we present neutron scattering experiments, which provide evidence that
such decays explain the collapsing lifetime (strong damping) of higher-energy
phonon-roton sound-wave quasiparticles in superfluid helium. This damping
develops when helium is pressurized towards crystallization or warmed towards
approaching the superfluid transition. Our results resolve a number of puzzles
posed by previous experiments and reveal the ubiquity of quasiparticle decays
and their importance for understanding quantum matter.

<h3>Exploring orbital-charge conversion mediated by interfaces with copper  through spin-orbital pumping</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigated how different materials affect the orbital-charge conversion
in heterostructures with the naturally oxidized cooper capping layer. When we
added a thin layer of $CuOx(3nm)$ onto yttrium iron garnet $(YIG)/W$ stacks, we
observed a significant reduction in the charge current signal measured by means
the spin pumping effect technique. This finding contrasts with the results of a
prior study conducted on YIG/Pt/CuOx, which reported the opposite effect. On
the other hand, when we added the same $CuOx(3nm)$ layer to $YIG/Ti(4nm)$
structures, there was not much change in the spin pumping signal. This occurred
because Ti does not generate much orbital current at the $Ti/CuOx$ interface,
unlike Pt, due to its weaker spin-orbit coupling. Interestingly, when we added
the $CuOx(3nm)$ layer to $SiO_{2}/Py(5nm)/Pt(4nm)$ structures, the spin pumping
signal increased. However, in $SiO_{2}/CuOx(3nm)/Pt(4nm)/Py(5nm)$ structures,
the signal decreased. Finally, we delve into a theoretical analysis of the spin
(orbital) Hall effect in YIG/Heavy-metal systems. These findings have the
potential to advance research in the innovative field of orbitronics and
contribute to the development of new technologies based on spin-orbital
conversion.

Magnetoelastic effects in antiferromagnetic CuMnAs are investigated by
applying dynamic strain in the 0.01% range through surface acoustic waves in
the GaAs substrate. The magnetic state of the CuMnAs/GaAs is characterized by a
multitude of submicron-sized domains which we image by x-ray magnetic linear
dichroism combined with photoemission electron microscopy. Within the explored
strain range, CuMnAs shows magnetoelastic effects in the form of N\'eel vector
waves with micrometer wavelength, which corresponds to an averaged overall
spin-axis rotation up to 2.4 deg driven by the time-dependent strain from the
surface acoustic wave. Measurements at different temperatures indicate a
reduction of the wave amplitude when lowering the temperature. However, no
domain wall motion has been detected on the nanosecond timescale

<h3>Investigation of the Anomalous and Topological Hall Effects in Layered  Monoclinic Ferromagnet Cr$_{2.76}$Te$_4$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08898" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08898</a>

<br>
<br>
We studied the electrical transport, Hall effect, and magnetic properties of
monoclinic layered ferromagnet Cr$_{2.76}$Te$_4$. Our studies demonstrate
Cr$_{2.76}$Te$_4$ to be a soft ferromagnet with strong magnetocrystalline
anisotropy. Below 50 K, the system shows an antiferromagnetic-like transition.
Interestingly, between 50 and 150 K, we observe fluctuating magnetic moments
between in-plane and out-of-plane orientations, leading to non-coplanar spin
structure. On the other hand, the electrical resistivity data suggest it to be
metallic throughout the measured temperature range, except a $kink$ at around
50 K due to AFM ordering. The Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratio
$\frac{\mu_{eff}}{\mu_{s}}=1.89 (>1)$ calculated from our magnetic studies
confirms that Cr$_{2.76}$Te$_4$ is an itinerant ferromagnet. Large anomalous
Hall effect has been observed due to the skew-scattering of impurities and the
topological Hall effect has been observed due to non-coplanar spin-structure in
the presence of strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy. We examined the mechanism
of anomalous Hall effect by employing the first principles calculations.

<h3>Electrical transport in epitaxially grown undoped and Si-doped  degenerate GaN films</h3>

<br>
<br>
Undoped and Si-doped GaN films were grown epitaxially on sapphire by reactive
rf sputtering of GaAs (and Si) in Ar-N2 mixture. The resistivity of undoped GaN
film grown at 100% N2 was ~2 x 105 {\Omega} cm, which reduced to ~1 {\Omega} cm
in Si-doped film, revealing the effect of Si doping. With decrease of N2 from
100% to 75%, the carrier concentration of Si-doped films increased from ~7 x
1018 cm-3 to ~2 x 1019 cm-3, but remained practically unchanged as N2 was
decreased to 20%, which is explained by effects due to saturation of Si doping
and increase of Ga interstitials as well as compensation by N interstitials and
Ga vacancies. Undoped and Si-doped films grown below 20% N2 displayed similar
carrier concentrations (~1020 cm-3), due to dominance of Ga interstitials. Both
undoped and Si-doped films were degenerate and displayed increase of mobility
with carrier concentration and temperature, which was analyzed by the combined
effect of ionized impurity and dislocation scattering, using compensation ratio
as fitting parameter. At carrier concentrations below 1019 cm-3, the mobility
was governed by both ionized impurity and dislocation scattering, while at
higher carrier concentrations, ionized impurity scattering was found to
dominate, limited by compensation due to acceptors. In spite of the degenerate
character, the films displayed a small decrease of carrier concentration with
temperature, along with a nearly linear decrease of mobility, which are
explained by a marginal increase of compensation ratio with decrease of
temperature, taking into account the band edge fluctuation effects.

<h3>Diminishing Mott gap by doping electrons through depositing one  monolayer thin film of Rb on Ca$_{2}$CuO$_{2}$Cl$_{2}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Understanding the doping evolution from a Mott insulator to a superconductor
probably holds the key for resolving the mystery of unconventional
superconductivity in copper oxides. To elucidate the evolution of the
electronic state starting from the Mott insulator, we dose the surface of the
parent phase Ca$_{2}$CuO$_{2}$Cl$_{2}$ by depositing one monolayer thin film of
Rb atoms which are supposed to donate electrons to the CuO$_{2}$ planes
underneath. We successfully achieved the Rb thin films with periodic
structures, and the scanning tunneling microscopy or spectroscopy (STM or STS)
measurements on the surface show that the Fermi energy is pinned within the
Mott gap but more close to the edge of the charge transfer band (CTB). However,
the electron doping does not reduce the spectra weight of the upper Hubbard
band (UHB) for the double occupancy as expected from the rigid model, but
instead increase it; meanwhile, further doping will create a new wide spread in
gap states derivative from the UHB, and the Mott gap will be significantly
diminished. Our results provide new clues to understand the strong correlation
effect of parent Mott insulators for cuprates and shed new light on the origin
of high-temperature superconductivity.

<h3>Active Jamming at Criticality</h3>

<br>
<br>
Jamming is ubiquitous in disordered systems, but the critical behavior of
jammed solids subjected to active forces or thermal fluctuations remains
elusive. In particular, while passive athermal jamming remains mean-field-like
in two and three dimensions, diverse active matter systems exhibit anomalous
scaling behavior in all physical dimensions. It is therefore natural to ask
whether activity leads to anomalous scaling in jammed systems. Here, we use
numerical and analytical methods to study systems of active, soft, frictionless
spheres in two dimensions, and elucidate the universal scaling behavior that
relates the excess coordination, active forces or temperature, and pressure
close to the athermal jammed point. We show that active forces and thermal
effects around the critical jammed state can again be captured by a mean-field
picture, thus highlighting the distinct and crucial role of amorphous structure
in active matter systems.

Electronic correlations in two-dimensional materials play a crucial role in
stabilising emergent phases of matter. The realisation of correlation-driven
phenomena in graphene has remained a longstanding goal, primarily due to the
absence of strong electron-electron interactions within its low-energy bands.
In this context, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene has recently emerged as a
novel platform featuring correlated phases favoured by the low-energy flat
bands of the underlying moir\'e superlattice. Notably, the observation of
correlated insulators and superconductivity has garnered significant attention,
leading to substantial progress in theoretical and experimental studies aiming
to elucidate the origin and interplay between these two phases. A wealth of
correlated phases with unprecedented tunability was discovered subsequently,
including orbital ferromagnetism, Chern insulators, strange metallicity,
density waves, and nematicity. However, a comprehensive understanding of these
closely competing phases remains elusive. The ability to controllably twist and
stack multiple graphene layers has enabled the creation of a whole new family
of moir\'e superlattices with myriad properties being discovered at a fast
pace. Here, we review the progress and development achieved so far,
encompassing the rich phase diagrams offered by these graphene-based moir\'e
systems. Additionally, we discuss multiple phases recently observed in
non-moir\'e multilayer graphene systems. Finally, we outline future
opportunities and challenges for the exploration of hidden phases in this new
generation of moir\'e materials.

We study the accuracy of the theory of Stroobants, Lekkerkerker and Odijk,
called SLO theory (Macromolecules 19 (1986) 2232-2238), to describe the
thermodynamic properties of an isotropic fluid of charged rods. By
incorporation of the effective diameter of the rods according to SLO theory
into scaled particle theory (SPT) we obtain an expression for the rod
concentration-dependent free volume fraction and the osmotic pressure of a
collection of charged hard spherocylinders. The results are compared to Monte
Carlo simulations. We find close agreement between the simulation results and
the SLO-SPT predictions for not too large values of the Debye length and for
high rod charge densities. The deviations increase with rod density,
particularly at concentrations above which isotropic-nematic phase transitions
are expected.

We provide numerical evidence for the existence of phase transitions with
respect to the temperature in the one-dimensional Riesz gases with non-singular
pair interaction, that is particles on the line interacting via the potential
$-|r|^{-s}$, where $s \in (-1, 0)$. Our numerics hint for the existence of two
distinct phase transitions whose critical temperatures depend on $s$, namely a
first transition which separates between a fluid and a quasisolid phase
reminiscent of the Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, and a

phase. We determine the phase diagram with respect to $s$ and the temperature
$T$, which we find to be consistent with the known (or expected) results on the
1D Coulomb gas ($s = -1$), known to be a solid at all temperature, and the
Dyson log--gas ($s = 0$) which exhibits a BKT transition at $T = 1/2$ and which
is believed to be a fluid at all positive temperature.

<br>
<br>
At ambient conditions SrAl$_4$ adopts the BaAl$_4$ structure type with space
group $I4/mmm$. It undergoes a charge-density-wave (CDW) transition at
$T_{CDW}$ = 243 K, followed by a structural transition at $T_{S}$ = 87 K.
Temperature-dependent single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD) leads to the
observation of incommensurate superlattice reflections at $\mathbf{q} =
\sigma\,\mathbf{c}^{*}$ with $\sigma = 0.1116$ at 200 K. The CDW has
orthorhombic symmetry with the superspace group $Fmmm(0\,0\,\sigma)s00$, where
$Fmmm$ is a subgroup of $I4/mmm$ of index 2. Atomic displacements represent a
transverse wave, and they are mainly along one of the diagonal directions of
the $I$-centered unit cell. The breaking of fourfold rotational symmetry is
indicative of the presence of nematic order in the material. The orthorhombic
phase realized in SrAl$_4$ is analogous to that found in EuAl$_4$, albeit with
the presence of higher order satellite reflections (up to $m = 3$) and a
shorter modulation wave vector. A possible non-trivial band topology has
prevented the determination by density functional theory (DFT) of the mechanism
of CDW formation. However, DFT reveals that Al atoms dominate the density of
states near the Fermi level, thus, corroborating the SXRD measurements.
SrAl$_4$ remains incommensurately modulated at the structural transition, where
the symmetry lowers from orthorhombic to $\mathbf{b}$-unique monoclinic. We
have identified a simple criterion, that correlates the presence of a phase
transition with the interatomic distances. Only those compounds
$X$Al$_{4-x}$Ga$_x$ ($X$ = Ba, Eu, Sr, Ca; $0 < x <4$) undergo phase
transitions, for which the ratio $c/a$ falls within the narrow range $2.51 <
c/a < 2.54$.

<h3>Insights into electronic and transport properties of phosphorene  nanorings in two perpendicular directions: Effects of circular and elliptical  external potentials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08970" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08970</a>
<br>
<i>MohammadAmir Bazrafshan, Farhad Khoeini, Bartlomiej Szafran</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we study the electronic and transport properties of phosphorene
nanorings in two perpendicular directions (zigzag and armchair directions) in
the presence of zigzag metallic source and drain leads. Our results are based
on the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method and a five-parameter
tight-binding (TB) approach. We investigate how system parameters affect the
electronic transport. These parameters include the radius of the rings, the
width of the leads and the external potential. Our results show that for all
configurations studied, a transport energy gap exists whose width can be tuned
by the width of the leads and the radius of the nanoring. The transmission
function of wider leads shows more sensitivity to the variation of the inner
radius due to higher electronic states that can respond to smaller changes in
the scattering region. In addition, the transport along the armchair direction
is more susceptible to tuning than the transport along the zigzag direction.
The effects of external potentials on the conductance are more pronounced than
the geometrical parameters. In particular the circular potential of the
amplitude of 0.1 eV can widen the transport gap by about ~0.35 eV.

<br>
<br>
Linear magnetoelectric effect is an attractive phenomenon in condensed
matters and provides indispensable technological functionalities. Here a
colossal linear magnetoelectric effect with diagonal component alfa_33 reaching
up to ~480 ps/m is reported in a polar magnet Fe2Mo3O8, and this effect can
persist in a broad range of magnetic field (~20 T) and is orders of magnitude
larger than reported values in literature. Such an exceptional experimental
observation can be well reproduced by a theoretical model affirmatively
unveiling the vital contributions from the exchange striction, while the sign
difference of magnetocrystalline anisotropy can also be reasonably figured out.

<h3>Strain tuned magnetotransport of Jeff=1/2 antiferromagnetic Sr2IrO4 thin  films</h3>

<i>N. Hu, Y. K. Weng, K. Chen, B. You, Y. Liu, Y. T. Chang, R. Xiong, S. Dong, C. L. Lu</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we report observation of strain effect on physical properties
of Sr2IrO4 thin films grown on SrTiO3 (001) and LaAlO3 (001) substrates. It is
found that the film on LaAlO3 with compressive strain has a lower
antiferromagnetic transition temperature (TN~210 K) than the film on SrTiO3
(TN~230 K) with tensile strain, which is probably caused by modified interlayer
coupling. Interestingly, magnetoresistance due to pseudospin-flip of the film
on LaAlO3 is much larger than that of tensile-strained film on SrTiO3, and
robust anisotropic magnetoresistance is observed in the former, but H-driven
reversal behavior is seen in the latter. By performing first principles
calculations, it is revealed that epitaxial strain plays an efficient role in
tuning the canting angle of Jeff=1/2 moments and thus net moment at every IrO2
layer, responsible for the difference in magnetoresistance between the films.
The reversal of anisotropic magnetoresistance in the thin film on SrTiO3 can be
ascribed to stabilization of a metastable stable with smaller bandgap as the
Jeff=1/2 moments are aligned along the diagonal of basal plane by H. However,
theoretical calculations reveal much higher magnetocrystalline anisotropy
energy in the film on LaAlO3. This causes difficulties to drive the Jeff=1/2
moments to reach the diagonal and thereby the metastable state, explaining the
distinct anisotropic magnetoresistance between two samples in a qualitative
sense. Our findings indicate that strain can be a highly efficient mean to
engineer the functionalities of Jeff=1/2 antiferromagnet Sr2IrO4.

<h3>Structural origin of the Jeff=1/2 antiferromagnetic phase in Ga-doped  Sr2IrO4</h3>

<br>
<br>
Sr2IrO4 hosts a novel Jeff =1/2 Mott state and quasi-two-dimensional
antiferromagnetic order, providing a unique avenue of exploring emergent states
of matter and functions that are extraordinarily sensitive to any structural
variations. While the correlation between the physical property and lattice
structure in Sr2IrO4 has been a focused issue in the past decade, a common
perception assumes that the magnetic ordering is essentially determined by the
Ir-O-Ir bond angle. Therefore, a delicate modulation of this angle and
consequently a major modulation of the magnetic ordering, by chemical doping
such as Ga at Ir site, has been extensively investigated and well believed. In
this work, however, we present a whole package of structure and magnetism data
on a series of single crystal and polycrystalline Sr2Ir1-xGaxO4 samples,
revealing the substantial difference in the N\'eel temperature TN between the
two types of samples, and the TN value for the polycrystalline sample x = 0.09
is even 64 K higher than that of the single crystal sample x = 0.09 (deltaTN ~
64 K at x = 0.09). Our systematic investigations demonstrate the crucial role
of the c/a ratio in tuning the interlayer coupling and thereby the Neel point
TN, i.e. a higher TN can be achieved as c/a is reduced. The notable differences
in structural parameters between the two groups of samples are probably caused
by additional strain due to the massive grain boundaries in polycrystalline
samples. The present work suggests an additional ingredient of physics that is
essential in modulating the emergent properties in Sr2IrO4 and probably other
iridates.

<h3>Antiferromagnetic to Ferrimagnetic Phase Transition and Possible Phase  Coexistence in Polar Magnets (Fe$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$)$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$</h3>

<br>
<br>
In the present work, magnetic properties of single crystal
(Fe$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$)$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$ ($0<x<1$) have been studied by performing
extensive measurements. A detailed magnetic phase diagram is built up, in which
antiferromagnetic state dominates for $x<0.25$ and ferrimagnetic phase arises
for $x>0.3$. Meanwhile, sizeable electric polarization of spin origin is
commonly observed in all samples, no matter what the magnetic state is. For the
samples hosting a ferrimagnetic state, square-like magnetic hysteresis loops
are revealed, while the remnant magnetization and coercive field can be tuned
drastically by simply varying the Mn-content or temperature. Possible
coexistence of the antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic phases is proposed to be
responsible for the remarkable modulation of magnetic properties in the
samples.

<br>
We theoretically investigate the Seebeck and Peltier effect across an
interacting quantum dot(QD) coupled between a normal metal and a
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductor within the Coulomb blockade regime.
Our results demonstrate that the thermoelectric conversion efficiency at
optimal power output (optimized with respect to QD energy level and external
serial load) in NQDS nanodevice can reach up to $58\%\eta_C$, where $\eta_C$ is
Carnot efficiency, with output power $P_{max}\approx 35fW$ for temperature
below the superconducting transition temperature. Further, the Peltier cooling
effect is observed for a wide range of parameter regimes, which can be
optimized by varying the background thermal energy, QD level energy,
QD-reservoir tunneling strength, and bias voltage. The results presented in
this study are within the scope of existing experimental capabilities for
designing miniature hybrid devices that operate at cryogenic temperatures.

<h3>Electronic and Topological Properties of a Topological Insulator Thin  Film Sandwiched between Ferromagnetic Insulators</h3>

<i>Piotr Pigoń, Anna Dyrdał</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider a thin film of a topological insulator (TI) sandwiched between
two ferromagnetic (FM) layers. The system is additionally under an external
gate voltage. The surface electron states of TI are magnetized due to the
magnetic proximity effect to the ferromagnetic layers. The magnetization of
ferromagnetic layers can be changed by applying an external magnetic field or
by varying thickness of the topological insulator (owing to the interlayer
exchange coupling). The change in the magnetic configuration of the system
affects the transport properties of the surface electronic states. Using the
Green function formalism, we calculate spin polarization, anomalous Hall
effect, and magnetoresistance of the system. We show, among others, that by
tuning the gate voltage and magnetizations of the top and bottom FM layers, one
can observe the topological transition to the anomalous quantum Hall state.

<br>
<br>
The high cooling rate needed for preparing the metallic glass (MG) makes the
nonequilibrium nature of glass formation more prominent and requires a better
quenching technique than ever before. Here, we formulate the cooling process in
an analytical way and figure out the determinants for cooling rate, and analyze
the crystallization time with consideration of phase diagram. Based on the
reduced glass transition temperature, Trg, for measuring the glass-forming
ability (GFA), a more reasonable {\Delta}Trg is proposed. Glass transition,
especially in ever glass whose ground state is of glass, is discussed in terms
of thermodynamics for phase transition. A fundamental law concerning the
changing rate of entropy in a closed system is supposed to underlie the physics
for glass formation. These results may help understand the glass formation
principally and develop new and robust MGs technically.

<h3>The connection between polymer collapse and the onset of jamming</h3>

Previous studies have shown that the interiors of proteins are densely
packed, reaching packing fractions that are as large as those found for static
packings of individual amino-acid-shaped particles. How can the interiors of
proteins take on such high packing fractions given that amino acids are
connected by peptide bonds and many amino acids are hydrophobic with attractive
interactions? We investigate this question by comparing the structural and
mechanical properties of collapsed attractive disk-shaped bead-spring polymers
to those of three reference systems: static packings of repulsive disks, of
attractive disks, and of repulsive disk-shaped bead-spring polymers. We show
that attractive systems quenched to temperatures below the glass transition $T
\ll T_g$ and static packings of both repulsive disks and bead-spring polymers
possess similar interior packing fractions. Previous studies have shown that
static packings of repulsive disks are isostatic at jamming onset, i.e. the
number of contacts $N_c$ matches the number of degrees of freedom, which
strongly influences their mechanical properties. We find that repulsive
polymers are hypostatic at jamming onset, but effectively isostatic when
including quartic modes. While attractive disk and polymer packings are
hyperstatic, we identify a definition for interparticle contacts for which they
can also be considered as effectively isostatic. As a result, we show that the
mechanical properties (e.g. scaling of the potential energy with excess contact
number and low-frequency contribution to the density of vibrational modes) of
weakly attractive disk and polymer packings are similar to those of ${\it
isostatic}$ repulsive disk and polymer packings. Our results demonstrate that
static packings generated via attractive collapse or compression of repulsive
particles possess similar structural and mechanical properties.

Ultrafast electron-phonon relaxation dynamics in graphene hides many distinct
phenomena, such as hot phonon generation, dynamical Kohn anomalies, and phonon
decoupling, yet still remains largely unexplored. Here, we unravel intricate
mechanisms governing the vibrational relaxation and phonon dressing in graphene
at a highly non-equilibrium state by means of first-principles techniques. We
calculate dynamical phonon spectral functions and momentum-resolved linewidths
for various stages of electron relaxation and find photo-induced phonon
hardening, overall increase of relaxation rate and nonadiabaticity as well as
phonon gain. Namely, the initial stage of photo-excitation is found to be
governed by strong phonon anomalies of finite-momentum optical modes along with
incoherent phonon production. Population inversion state, on the other hand,
allows production of coherent and strongly-coupled phonon modes. Our research
provides vital insights into the electron-phonon coupling phenomena in
graphene, and serves as a foundation for exploring non-equilibrium phonon
dressing in materials where ordered states and phase transitions can be induced
by photo-excitation.

The temperature-dependent behavior of magnetic domains plays an essential
role in the magnetic properties of materials, leading to widespread
applications. However, experimental methods to access the three-dimensional
(3D) magnetic domain structures are very limited, especially for
antiferromagnets. Over the past decades, the spin-orbit Mott insulator iridate
$Sr_2IrO_4$ has attracted particular attention because of its interesting
magnetic structure and analogy to superconducting cuprates. Here, we apply
resonant x-ray magnetic Bragg coherent diffraction imaging to track the
real-space 3D evolution of antiferromagnetic ordering inside a $Sr_2IrO_4$
single crystal as a function of temperature, finding that the antiferromagnetic
domain shows anisotropic changes. The anisotropy of the domain shape reveals
the underlying anisotropy of the antiferromagnetic coupling strength within
$Sr_2IrO_4$. These results demonstrate the high potential significance of 3D
domain imaging in magnetism research.

<br>
A combination of the X-ray diffraction, Raman and infrared spectroscopies and
magnetic measurements was used to explore the correlated changes of the
structure, lattice dynamics and magnetic properties of the LuFeO$_3$
nanopowders, which appear in dependence on their sintering temperature. We
revealed a gradual substitution of the hexagonal phase by the orthorhombic
phase in the nanoparticles, which sintering temperatures increases from
700$^\circ$C to 1100$^\circ$C. The origin and stability of the hexagonal phase
in the LuFeO$_3$ nanoparticles is of the special interest, because the
nanoparticle in the phase can be a room-temperature multiferroic with a weak
ferromagnetic and ferroelectric properties, while the antiferromagnetic and
nonpolar orthorhombic phase is more stable in the bulk LuFeO$_3$. To define the
ranges of the hexagonal phase stability, we determine the bulk and interface
energy densities of different phases from the comparison of the Gibbs model
with experimental results. Analysis of the obtained results shows that the
combination of the X-ray diffraction, Raman and infrared spectroscopy, magnetic
measurements and theoretical modelling allows to establish the physical origin
of possible correlations between the phase composition, lattice dynamics and
ferroic properties of the LuFeO$_3$ nanoparticles prepared in different
conditions.

<h3>Probing the Viscoelastic Properties of Aqueous Protein Solutions using  Molecular Dynamics Simulations</h3>

<br>
We performed molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the viscoelastic
properties of aqueous protein solutions containing an antifreeze protein, a
toxin protein, and bovine serum albumin. These simulations covered a
temperature range from 280 K to 340 K. Our findings demonstrate that lower
temperatures are associated with higher viscosity as well as a lower bulk
modulus and speed of sound for all the systems studied. Furthermore, we observe
an increase in the bulk modulus and speed of sound as the temperature increases
up to a weak maximum while the viscosity decreases. Moreover, we analyzed the
influence of protein concentration on the viscoelastic properties of the
antifreeze protein solution. We observed a consistent increase in the bulk
modulus, speed of sound, and viscosity as the protein concentration increased.
Remarkably, our molecular dynamics simulations results closely resemble the
trends observed in Brillouin scattering experiments on aqueous protein
solutions. The similarity thus validates the use of simulations in studying the
viscoelastic properties of protein water solutions. Ultimately, this work
provides motivation for the integration of computer simulations with
experimental data and holds potential for advancing our understanding of both
simple and complex systems.

<h3>Generalized Finsler geometry and the anisotropic tearing of skin</h3>

<i>John D. Clayton</i>
<br>
<br>
A continuum mechanical theory with foundations in generalized Finsler
geometry describes the complex anisotropic behavior of skin. A fiber bundle
approach, encompassing total spaces with assigned linear and nonlinear
connections, geometrically characterizes evolving configurations of a
deformable body with microstructure. An internal state vector is introduced on
each configuration, describing subscale physics. A generalized Finsler metric
depends on position and the state vector, where the latter dependence allows
for both direction (i.e., as in Finsler geometry) as well as magnitude.
Equilibrium equations are derived using a variational method, extending
concepts of finite-strain hyperelasticity coupled to phase-field mechanics to
generalized Finsler space. For application to skin tearing, state vector
components represent microscopic damage processes (e.g., fiber rearrangements
and ruptures) in different directions with respect to intrinsic orientations
(e.g., parallel or perpendicular to Langer's lines). Nonlinear potentials,
motivated from soft-tissue mechanics and phase-field fracture theories, are
assigned with orthotropic material symmetry pertinent to properties of skin.
Governing equations are derived for one- and two-dimensional base manifolds.
Analytical solutions capture experimental force-stretch data, toughness, and
observations on evolving microstructure, in a more geometrically and physically
descriptive way than prior phenomenological models.

We explain the steering of slow degrees of freedom by coupling them to driven

present the strategy and main principle that make that sort of navigation
feasible. For illustration, nonlinear limit cycles (as in the van der Pol
oscillator) and strange attractors (as in the Lorenz dynamics) are seen to
emerge when the driving in the nonequilibrium medium is kept fixed while the
frenesy is tuned to produce the required forces. We imagine that such frenetic

biological functioning.

I will review the Gardner's approach based on replica method and the derivation
of the SAT/UNSAT transition in the storage setting. Then, I discuss some recent
works that unveiled how the zero training error configurations are
geometrically arranged, and how this arrangement changes as the size of the
training set increases. I also illustrate how different regions of solution
space can be explored analytically and how the landscape in the vicinity of a
solution can be characterized. I give evidence how, in binary weight models,
algorithmic hardness is a consequence of the disappearance of a clustered
region of solutions that extends to very large distances. Finally, I
demonstrate how the study of linear mode connectivity between solutions can
give insights into the average shape of the solution manifold.

This paper investigates the statistical behavior of two-dimensional grain
microstructures during grain growth under anisotropic grain boundary
characters. We employ the threshold-dynamics method, which allows for
unparalleled computational speed, to simulate the full-field curvature motion
of grain boundaries in a large polycrystal ensemble. Two sets of numerical
experiments are performed to explore the effect of grain boundary anisotropy on
the evolution of microstructure features. In the first experiment, we focus on
abnormal grain growth and find that grain boundary anisotropy introduces a
statistical preference for certain grain orientations. This leads to changes in
the overall grain size distribution from the isotropic case. In the second
experiment, we examine the texture development and growth of twin grain
boundaries at different initial microstructures. We find that both phenomena
are more pronounced when the initial microstructure has a dominant fraction of
high-angle grain boundaries. Our results suggest effective grain boundary
engineering strategies for improving material properties.

The kagome lattice is an intriguing and rich platform for discovering, tuning
and understanding the diverse phases of quantum matter, which is a necessary
premise for utilizing quantum materials in all areas of modern and future
electronics in a controlled and optimal way. The system LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$ was
shown to exhibit typical kagome band structure features near the Fermi energy
formed by the Ru-$dz^{2}$ orbitals and the highest superconducting transition
temperature $T_{\rm c}$ ${\simeq}$ 7K among the kagome-lattice materials.
However, the effect of electronic correlations on the normal state properties
remains elusive. Here, we report the discovery of charge order in
La(Ru$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$)$_{3}$Si$_{2}$ ($x$ = 0, 0.01, 0.05) beyond
room-temperature. Namely, single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals charge order
with a propagation vector of ($\frac{1}{4}$,0,0) below $T_{\rm CO-I}$
${\simeq}$ 400K in all three compounds. At lower temperatures, we see the
appearance of a second set of charge order peaks with a propagation vector of
($\frac{1}{6}$,0,0). The introduction of Fe, which is known to quickly suppress
superconductivity, does not drastically alter the onset temperature for charge
order. Instead, it broadens the scattered intensity such that diffuse
scattering appears at the same onset temperature, however does not coalesce
into sharp Bragg diffraction peaks until much lower in temperature. Our results
present the first example of a charge ordered state at or above room
temperature in the correlated kagome lattice with bulk superconductivity.

The parent compound of cuprates is a charge-transfer-type Mott insulator with
strong hybridization between the Cu $3d_{\mathrm x^2-y^2}$ and O $2p$ orbitals.
A key question concerning the pairing mechanism is the behavior of doped holes
in the antiferromagnetic (AF) Mott insulator background, which is a
prototypical quantum many-body problem. It was proposed that doped hole on the
O site tends to form a singlet, known as Zhang-Rice singlet (ZRS), with the
unpaired Cu spin. But experimentally little is known about the properties of a
single hole and the interplay between them that leads to superconductivity.
Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy to visualize the electronic states in
hole-doped $\mathrm{Ca_2CuO_2Cl_2}$, aiming to establish the atomic-scale local
basis for pair formation. A single doped hole is shown to have an in-gap state
and a clover-shaped spatial distribution that can be attributed to a localized
ZRS. When the dopants are close enough, they develop delocalized molecular
orbitals with characteristic stripe- and ladder-shaped patterns, accompanied by
the opening of a small gap around the Fermi level ($E_{\mathrm F}$). With
increasing doping, the molecular orbitals proliferate in space and gradually
form densely packed plaquettes, but the stripe and ladder patterns remain
nearly the same. The low-energy electronic states of the molecular orbitals are
intimately related to the local pairing properties, thus play a vitally
important role in the emergence of superconductivity. We propose that the
Cooper pair is formed by two holes occupying the stripe-like molecular orbital,
while the attractive interaction is mediated by the AF spin background.

Tailoring microstructures represents a daunting goal in materials science.
Here, an innovative proposition is to utilize grain boundary (GB) complexions
(a.k.a. interfacial phases) to manipulate microstructural evolution, which is
challenging to control via only temperature and doping. Herein, we use ZnO as a
model system to tailor microstructures using applied electric fields as a new
knob to control GB structures locally via field-driven stoichiometry (defects)
polarization. Specifically, continuously graded microstructures are created
under applied electric fields. By employing aberration-corrected scanning
transmission electron microscopy (AC STEM) in conjunction with density
functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), we discover
cation-deficient, oxygen-rich GBs near the anode with enhanced GB
diffusivities. In addition, the field-driven redistribution of cation vacancies
is deduced from a defect chemistry model, and subsequently verified by
spatially resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. This bulk stoichiometry
polarization leads to preferential formation of cation-deficient (oxidized) GBs
near the anode to gradually promote grain growth towards the anode. This
mechanism can be utilized to create continuously graded microstructures without
abnormal grain growth typically observed in prior studies. This study
exemplifies a case of tailoring microstructural evolution via altering GB
complexions locally with applied electric fields, and it enriches fundamental
GB science.

<h3>Relativistic Douglas-Kroll-Hess Calculations of Hyperfine Interactions  within First Principles Multireference Methods</h3>

<br>
<br>
Relativistic magnetic hyperfine interaction Hamiltonian based on the
Douglas-Kroll-Hess (DKH) theory up to the second order is implemented within
the ab initio multireference methods including spin-orbit coupling in the
Molcas/OpenMolcas package. This implementation is applied to calculate
relativistic hyperfine coupling (HFC) parameters for atomic systems and
diatomic radicals with valence s or d orbitals by systematically varying active
space size in the restricted active space self-consistent field (RASSCF)
formalism with restricted active space state interaction (RASSI) for spin-orbit
coupling. The DKH relativistic treatment of the hyperfine interaction reduces
the Fermi contact contribution to the HFC due to the presence of kinetic
factors that regularize the singularity of the Dirac delta function in the
nonrelativitic Fermi contact operator. This effect is more prominent for
heavier nuclei. As the active space size increases, the relativistic correction
of the Fermi contact contribution converges well to the experimental data for
light and moderately heavy nuclei. The relativistic correction, however, does
not significantly affect the spin-dipole contribution to the hyperfine
interaction. In addition to the atomic and molecular systems, the
implementation is applied to calculate the relativistic HFC parameters for
large trivalent and divalent Tb-based single-molecule magnets (SMMs) such as
Tb(III)Pc$_2$ and Tb(II)(Cp$^\text{iPr5}$)$_2$ without ligand truncation using
well-converged basis sets. In particular, for the divalent SMM which has an
unpaired valence 6s/5d hybrid orbital, the relativistic treatment of HFC is
crucial for a proper description of the Fermi contact contribution. Even with
the relativistic hyperfine Hamiltonian, the divalent SMM is shown to exhibit
strong tunability of HFC via an external electric field (i.e., strong hyperfine
Stark effect).

<h3>Many-body interactions between contracting living cells</h3>

<br>
<i>Roman Golkov, Yair Shokef</i>
<br>
<br>
The organization of live cells into tissues and their subsequent biological
function involves inter-cell mechanical interactions, which are mediated by
their elastic environment. To model this interaction, we consider cells as
spherical active force dipoles surrounded by an unbounded elastic matrix. Even
though we assume that this elastic medium responds linearly, each cell's
regulation of its mechanical activity leads to nonlinearities in the emergent
interactions between cells. We study the many-body nature of these interactions
by considering several geometries that include three or more cells. We show
that for different regulatory behaviors of the cells' activity, the total
elastic energy stored in the medium differs from the superposition of all
two-body interactions between pairs of cells within the system. Specifically,
we find that the many-body interaction energy between cells that regulate their
position is smaller than the sum of interactions between all pairs of cells in
the system, while for cells that do not regulate their position, the many-body
interaction is larger than the superposition prediction. Thus, such
higher-order interactions should be considered when studying the mechanics of
multiple cells in proximity.

We rigorously prove that the local conserved quantities in the

the freedom to add lower-order ones. From this, we can conclude that the local

<h3>Hysteresis resulting from Lennard-Jones interactions</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The fundamental mechanism of hysteresis in the quasistatic limit of
multi-stable systems is associated with transitions of the system from one
local minimum of the potential energy to another. In this scenario, as system
parameters are (quasistatically) varied, the transition is prompted when a
saddle-node bifurcation eliminates the minimum where the system resides in. The
objective of the present work is to specify this generic mechanism for systems
of interacting particles assuming a natural single-well (Lennard-Jones)
interaction potential for each pair of particles. We show multi-stability and
present details of hysteresis scenarios with the associated bifurcations and
transitions in a case study of constrained four-degrees-of-freedom four
particle systems on the plane.

<br>
Encapsulated atomic hydrogen in cube-shaped octa-silsesquioxane (POSS) cages
of the Si$_8$O$_{12}$R$_8$ type (where R is an organic group) is the simplest
alternative stable system to paramagnetic endohedral fullerenes (N@C$_{60}$ or
P@C$_{60}$) that have been regarded as key elements of spin-based quantum
technologies. Apart from common sources of decoherence like nuclear spin and
spectral diffusion, all H@POSS species studied so far suffer from additional
shortening of $T_2$ at low temperatures due to methyl group rotations. Here we
eliminate this factor for the first time by studying the relaxation properties
of the smallest methyl-free derivative of this family with R=H, namely
H@T$_8$H$_8$. We suppress nuclear spin diffusion by applying dynamical
decoupling methods and we measure electron spin coherence times $T_2$ up to 280
$\pm$ 76 $\mu$s at $T=90$ K. We observe a linear dependence of the decoherence
rate $1/T_2$ on trapped hydrogen concentrations ranging between 9$\times
10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$ and 5$\times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ which we attribute to the
spin dephasing mechanism of instantaneous diffusion and a nonuniform spatial
distribution of encapsulated H atoms.

Exploring the topology of electronic bands is a way to realize new states of
matter with possible implications for information technology. Because bands
cannot always be observed directly, a central question is how to tell that a
topological regime has been achieved. Experiments are often guided by a
prediction of a unique signal or a pattern, called "the smoking gun". Examples
include peaks in conductivity, microwave resonances, and shifts in interference
fringes. However, many condensed matter experiments are performed on relatively
small, micron or nanometer-scale, specimens. These structures are in the
so-called mesoscopic regime, between atomic and macroscopic physics, where
phenomenology is particularly rich. In this paper, we demonstrate that the
trivial effects of quantum confinement, quantum interference and charge
dynamics in nanostructures can reproduce accepted smoking gun signatures of
triplet supercurrents, Majorana modes, topological Josephson junctions and
fractionalized particles. The examples we use correspond to milestones of
topological quantum computing: qubit spectroscopy, fusion and braiding. None of
the samples we use are in the topological regime. The smoking gun patterns are
achieved by fine-tuning during data acquisition and by subsequent data
selection to pick non-representative examples out of a fluid multitude of
similar patterns that do not generally fit the "smoking gun" designation.
Building on this insight, we discuss ways that experimentalists can rigorously
delineate between topological and non-topological effects, and the effects of
fine-tuning by deeper analysis of larger volumes of data.

The analog electronic computers are a type of circuitry used to calculate
specific problems using the physical relationships between the voltages and
currents following classical laws of physics. One specific class of these
circuits are computers based on the interactions between passive circuit
elements. Models presented by G.Kron in 1945 are the example of using such
passive elements to construct a solver for the problem of free quantum
particles confined by rectangular potential. Numerical validation of Kron
second model is conducted for different shapes of particle confining potential.
Model introduced by Kron is generalized by introduction of non-linear resistive
elements what implies deformation of Schr\"odinger equation solution into
Ginzburg-Landau form.

<br>
<br>
We study the possibility of superconductivity in a trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper
nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure both theoretically and
experimentally, making comparison with the recently discovered high $T_c$
superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, a bilayer nickelate. Through DFT
calculations, we find that a structural phase transition from monoclinic to
tetragonal takes place around 20--40 GPa. Using the crystal structure obtained
at 40 GPa, we theoretically investigate the possibility of superconductivity,
where a combination of fluctuation exchange approximation and linearized
Eliashberg equation is applied to a six-orbital model constructed from first
principles band calculation. The obtained results suggests that
La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ may also become superconducting under high pressure with
$T_c$ comparable to some cuprates, although it is not as high as
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We also perform experimental studies using our
polycrystalline samples of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7.12}$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{9.99}$.
The superconducting transition of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7.12}$, with a maximum onset
$T_c$ of 78.4 K at a pressure of 26.1 GPa, is confirmed by a drop in the
electrical resistance, as well as the magnetic field dependence of the
resistance. Quite interestingly, similar temperature and magnetic field
dependences of the resistance are observed also for La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{9.99}$,
where a drop in the resistance is observed at lower temperatures compared to
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7.12}$, under pressures of 32.8 GPa and above. Given the
theoretical expectation, the reduction in the resistance can most likely be
attributed to the occurrence of superconductivity in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{9.99}$.

This paper presents a large-scale $ab$ $initio$ simulation study of amorphous
silicon hydride ($a$-Si$_{\text{1-x}}$H$_{\text{x}}$) with an emphasis on the
structure and properties of the material across a range of hydrogen
concentration by combining accelerated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with
first-principles density-functional calculations. The accelerated MD scheme
relied on classical metadynamics, which enabled the development of 2600+
high-quality structural models of $a$-Si$_{\text{1-x}}$H$_{\text{x}}$, with
system sizes ranging from 150 to 6,000 atoms and hydrogen concentrations vary
from 6 to 20 at. %H. The resulting amorphous networks were found to be
completely free from any coordination defects and that they all exhibited a
pristine band-gap in their electronic spectrum. The microstructural properties
of hydrogen distributions were examined with great emphasis on the presence of
isolated and clustered environments of hydrogen atoms. The results were
compared with a suite of experimental data obtained from x-ray diffraction,
infrared spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry and nuclear magnetic
resonance studies.

<h3>Thermodynamics of imbibition in capillaries of double conical  structures-Hourglass, diamond, and sawtooth shaped capillaries-</h3>

<i>Masao Iwamatsu</i>
<br>
<br>
Thermodynamics of imbibition (intrusion and extrusion) in capillaries of
double conical structures is theoretically studied using the classical
capillary model. By extending the knowledge of the thermodynamics of a single
conical capillary, not only the nature of spontaneous imbibition but that of
forced imbibition under applied external pressure are clarified. Spontaneous
imbibition in capillaries of double conical structure can be predicted from the
Laplace pressure in a single conical capillary. To understand the forced
imbibition process, the free energy landscape along the imbibition pathway is
calculated. This landscape shows either a maximum or a minimum. The former acts
as the energy barrier and the latter acts as the trap for the liquid-vapor
meniscus so that the imbibition process can be either abrupt with a pressure
hysteresis or gradual and continuous. The landscape also predicts a completely
filled, a half-filled and a completely empty state as the thermodynamically
stable state. Furthermore, it also predicts a completely filled and a
half-filled state of metastable liquid which can be prepared by the combination
of the intrusion and the extrusion process. Our study could be useful for
understanding various natural fluidic systems and for designing functional
fluidic devices such as a diode, a switch etc.

<h3>Terahertz magnon frequency comb</h3>

Magnon frequency comb (MFC), the spin-wave spectra composing of equidistant
coherent peaks, is attracting much attention in magnonics. A terahertz (THz)
MFC, combining the advantages of the THz and MFC technologies, is highly
desired because it would significantly advance the MFC applications in
ultrafast magnonic metrology, sensing, and communications. Here, we show that
the THz MFC can be generated by nonlinear interactions between spin waves and
skyrmions in antiferromagnets [Z. Jin \emph{et al}.,
\href{https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2301.03211}{arXiv:2301.03211}]. It is
found that the strength of the three-wave mixing between propagating magnons
and breathing skyrmions follows a linear dependence on the driving frequency
and the MFC signal can be observed over a broad driving frequency range. Our
results extend the working frequency of MFC to the THz regime, which would have
potential applications in ultrafast spintronic devices and promote the
development of nonlinear magnonics in antiferromagnets.

X-ray powder diffraction, electrical resistivity, magnetization, and
thermodynamic measurements were conducted to investigate the structure and
superconducting properties of TiHfNbTaMo, a novel high-entropy alloy possessing
a valence electron count (VEC) of 4.8. The TiHfNbTaMo HEA was discovered to
have a body-centered cubic structure and a microscopically homogeneous
distribution of the constituent elements. This material shows type-II
superconductivity with Tc = 3.42 K, lower critical field with 22.8 mT, and
upper critical field with 3.95 T. Low-temperature specific heat measurements
show that the alloy is a conventional s-wave type with a moderately coupled
superconductor. First-principles calculations show that the density of states
(DOS) of the TiHfNbTaMo alloy is dominated by hybrid d orbitals of these five
metal elements. Additionally, the TiHfNbTaMo HEA exhibits three van Hove
singularities. Furthermore, the VEC and the composition of the elements
(especially the Nb elemental content) affect the Tc of the bcc-type HEA.

<br>
<br>
Topological properties in quantum materials are often governed by symmetry
and tuned by crystal structure and external fields, and hence
symmetry-sensitive nonlinear optical measurements in a magnetic field are a
valuable probe. Here we report nonlinear magneto-optical second harmonic
generation (SHG) studies of non-magnetic topological materials including
bilayer WTe2, monolayer WSe2 and bulk TaAs. The polarization-resolved patterns
of optical SHG under magnetic field show nonlinear Kerr rotation in these
time-reversal symmetric materials. For materials with three-fold rotational
symmetric lattice structure, the SHG polarization pattern rotates just slightly
in a magnetic field, whereas in those with mirror or two-fold rotational
symmetry the SHG polarization pattern rotates greatly and distorts. These
different magneto-SHG characters can be understood by considering the
superposition of the magnetic field-induced time-noninvariant nonlinear optical
tensor and the crystal-structure-based time-invariant counterpart. The
situation is further clarified by scrutinizing the Faraday rotation, whose
subtle interplay with crystal symmetry accounts for the diverse behavior of the
extrinsic nonlinear Kerr rotation in different materials. Our work illustrates
the application of magneto-SHG techniques to directly probe nontrivial
topological properties, and underlines the importance of minimizing extrinsic
nonlinear Kerr rotation in polarization-resolved magneto-optical studies.

Emerging altermagnetic materials with vanishing net magnetizations and unique
band structures have been envisioned as an ideal electrode to design
antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions. Their momentum-resolved spin splitting in
band structures defines a spin-polarized Fermi surface, which allows
altermagnetic materials to polarize current as a ferromagnet, when the current
flows along specific directions relevant to their altermagnetism. Here, we
design an Altermagnet/Insulator barrier/Ferromagnet junction, renamed as
altermagnetic tunnel junction (ATMTJ), using RuO$_2$/TiO$_2$/CrO$_2$ as a
prototype. Through first-principles calculations, we investigate the tunneling
properties of the ATMTJ along the [001] and [110] directions, which shows that
the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) is almost zero when the current flows
along the [001] direction, while it can reach as high as 6100% with current
flows along the [110] direction. The spin-resolved conduction channels of the
altermagnetic RuO$_2$ electrode are found responsible for this
momentum-dependent (or transport-direction-dependent) TMR effect. Furthermore,
this ATMTJ can also be used to readout the N\'{e}el vector of the altermagnetic
electrode RuO$_2$. Our work promotes the understanding toward the altermagnetic
materials and provides an alternative way to design magnetic tunnel junctions
with ultrahigh TMR ratios and robustness of the altermagnetic electrode against
external disturbance, which broadens the application avenue for
antiferromagnetic spintronics devices.

<br>

In this paper, we have investigated, using finite element calculations, the
effect of initial texture on the formation of multiple necking patterns in
ductile metallic rings subjected to rapid radial expansion. The mechanical
behavior of the material has been modeled with the elasto-viscoplastic single
crystal constitutive model developed by \citet{marin2006}. The polycrystalline
microstructure of the ring has been generated using random Voronoi seeds. Both
$5000$ grain and $15000$ grain aggregates have been investigated, and for each
polycrystalline aggregate three different spatial distributions of grains have
been considered. The calculations have been performed within a wide range of
strain rates varying from $1.66 \cdot 10^4 ~ \text{s}^{-1}$ to $3.33 \cdot 10^5
~ \text{s}^{-1}$, and the rings have been modeled with four different initial
textures: isotropic texture, $\left\langle 001\right\rangle\parallel\Theta$
Goss texture, $\left\langle 001\right\rangle\parallel$ R Goss texture and
$\left\langle 111\right\rangle\parallel$ Z fiber texture. The finite element
results show that: (i) the spatial distribution of grains affects the location
of the necks, (ii) the decrease of the grain size delays the formation of the
necking pattern and increases the number of necks, (iii) the initial texture
affects the number of necks, the location of the necks, and the necking time,
(iv) the development of the necks is accompanied by a local increase of the
slip activity. This work provides new insights into the effect of
crystallographic microstructure on dynamic plastic localization and guidelines
to tailor the initial texture in order to delay dynamic necking formation and,
thus, to improve the energy absorption capacity of ductile metallic materials
at high strain rates.

<h3>How Bromine Stabilizes CsPbI$_{3}$: Atomistic Insights from Reactive  Molecular Dynamics Simulations</h3>

All-inorganic halide perovskites have received a lot of attention as
attractive alternatives to overcome the stability issues of hybrid halide
perovskites that are commonly associated with organic cations. To find a
compromise between the optoelectronic properties of CsPbI$_{3}$ and
CsPbBr$_{3}$, perovskites with CsPb(Br$_{\rm{x}}$I$_{\rm{1-x}}$)$_{3}$ mixed
compositions are commonly used. An additional benefit is that, without
sacrificing the optoelectronic properties for applications such as solar cells
or LEDs, small amounts of Br in CsPbI$_{3}$ can prevent the inorganic
perovskite from degrading to a photoinactive nonperovskite yellow phase.
Despite indications that strain in the perovskite lattice plays a role in the
stabilization of the material, the complete stabilization mechanism remains
unclear. Here we develop a reactive force field (ReaxFF) for perovskites
starting from our previous work for CsPbI$_{3}$, we extend this force field to
CsPbBr$_{3}$ and mixed CsPb(Br$_{\rm{x}}$I$_{\rm{1-x}}$)$_{3}$ compounds. This
force field is used in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to study
perovskite phase transitions and the internal ion dynamics associated with the
phase transitions. We find that an increase of the Br content lowers the
temperature at which the perovskite reaches a cubic structure, an indication of
the stabilizing effect of halide mixing. Specifically, by substituting Br for
I, the smaller ionic radius of Br induces a strain in the lattice that changes
the internal dynamics of the octahedra. Importantly, this effect propagates
through the perovskite lattice ranging up to distances of 2 nm, explaining why
small concentrations of Br in CsPb(Br$_{\rm{x}}$I$_{\rm{1-x}}$)$_{3}$ (x $\leq$
1/4) are sufficient to stabilize mixed halide perovskites.

Semiconductor spin qubits combine excellent quantum performance with the
prospect of manufacturing quantum devices using industry-standard
metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) processes. This applies also to ion-implanted
donor spins, which further afford exceptional coherence times and large Hilbert
space dimension in their nuclear spin. Here we demonstrate and integrate
multiple strategies to manufacture scale-up donor-based quantum computers. We
use $^{31}$PF$_{2}$ molecule implants to triple the placement certainty
compared to $^{31}$P ions, while attaining 99.99$\,$% confidence in detecting
the implant. Similar confidence is retained by implanting heavier atoms such as
$^{123}$Sb and $^{209}$Bi, which represent high-dimensional qudits for quantum
information processing, while Sb$_2$ molecules enable deterministic formation
of closely-spaced qudits. We demonstrate the deterministic formation of regular
arrays of donor atoms with 300$\,$nm spacing, using step-and-repeat
implantation through a nano aperture. These methods cover the full gamut of
technological requirements for the construction of donor-based quantum
computers in silicon.

Pulse distortion, as one of the coherent error sources, hinders the
characterization and control of qubits. In the semiconductor quantum dot
system, the distortions on measurement pulses and control pulses disturb the
experimental results, while no effective calibration procedure has yet been
reported. Here, we demonstrate two different calibration methods to calibrate
and correct the distortion using the two-qubit system as a detector. The two
calibration methods have different correction accuracy and complexity. One is
the coarse predistortion (CPD) method, with which the distortion is partly
relieved. The other method is the all predistortion (APD) method, with which we
measure the transfer function and significantly improve the exchange
oscillation homogeneity. The two methods use the exchange oscillation
homogeneity as the metric and are appropriate for any qubit that oscillates
with a diabatic pulse. With the APD procedure, an arbitrary control waveform
can be accurately delivered to the device, which is essential for
characterizing qubits and improving gate fidelity.

$\beta$-$\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$ has gained intensive interests of
research and application as an ultrawide bandgap semiconductor. Epitaxial
growth technique of the $\beta$-$\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$ thin film
possesses a fundamental and vital role in the
$\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$-based device fabrication. In this work,
epitaxial growth mechanisms of $\beta$-$\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$ with
four low Miller-index facets, namely (100), (010), (001), and
($\overline{2}$01), are systematically explored using large-scale
machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations at the atomic scale. The
simulations reveal that the migration of the face-centered cubic stacking O
sublattice plays a predominant role in rationalizing the different growth
mechanisms between (100)/(010)/(001) and ($\overline{2}$01) orientations. The
resultant complex combinations of the stacking faults and twin boundaries are
carefully identified, and shows a good agreement with the experimental
observation and ab initio calculation. Our results provide useful insights into
the gas-phase epitaxial growth of the $\beta$-$\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$
thin films and suggest possible ways to tailor its properties for specific
applications.

<h3>Phase transitions in the anisotropic XY ferromagnet with quenched  nonmagnetic impurity</h3>

The three dimensional anisotropic XY ferromagnet has been studied by Monte
Carlo simulation. The ferro-para phase transition has been observed to take
place at a lower temperature for impure anisotropic XY ferromagnet. The
pseudocritical temperature ($T_c^*$) has been found to decrease as the system
gets more and more impure (impurity concentration $p$ increases). In the case
of bilinear exchange type of anisotropy ($\lambda$), the pseudocritical
temperature ($T_c^*$) increases linearly with $\lambda$ for any given
concentration of nonmagnetic impurity ($p$). The slope of this linear function
has been found to depend on the impurity concentration ($p$). The slope
decreases linearly with the impurity concentration ($p$). In the case of the
single site anisotropy ($D$), the pseudocritical temperature ($T_c^*$) has been
found to decrease linearly with $p$ for fixed $D$. The critical temperature
(for a fixed set of parameter values) has been estimated from the temperature
variation of fourth order Binder cumulants ($U_L$) for different system sizes
($L$). The critical magnetisation ($M(T_c)$) and the maximum value of the
susceptibility ($\chi_p$) are calculated for different system sizes ($L$). The
critical exponents for the assumed scaling laws $M(T_c) \sim L^{-{{\beta} \over
{\nu}}}$ and $\chi_p \sim L^{{{\gamma} \over {\nu}}}$ are estimated through the
finite size analysis. We have estimated, ${{\beta} \over {\nu}}$, equals to
$0.48\pm0.05$ and $0.37\pm0.04$ for bilinear exchange and single site
anisotropy respectively. We have also estimated, ${{\gamma} \over {\nu}}$
equals to $1.78\pm0.05$ and $1.81\pm0.05$ for bilinear exchange and single site
anisotropy respectively.

Nanomechanical resonances of two-dimensional (2D) materials are sensitive
probes for condensed-matter physics, offering new insights into magnetic and
electronic phase transitions. Despite extensive research, the influence of the
spin dynamics near a second-order phase transition on the nonlinear dynamics of
2D membranes has remained largely unexplored. Here, we investigate nonlinear
magneto-mechanical coupling to antiferromagnetic order in suspended
FePS$_3$-based heterostructure membranes. By monitoring the motion of these
membranes as a function of temperature, we observe characteristic features in
both nonlinear stiffness and damping close to the N\'{e}el temperature
$T_{\rm{N}}$. We account for these experimental observations with an analytical
magnetostriction model in which these nonlinearities emerge from a coupling
between mechanical and magnetic oscillations, demonstrating that
magneto-elasticity can lead to nonlinear damping. Our findings thus provide
insights into the thermodynamics and magneto-mechanical energy dissipation
mechanisms in nanomechanical resonators due to the material's phase change and
magnetic order relaxation.

<h3>Strong Coupling of Two-Dimensional Excitons and Plasmonic Photonic  Crystals: Microscopic Theory Reveals Triplet Spectra</h3>

<br>
<br>
Monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) are direct-gap
semiconductors with strong light-matter interactions featuring tightly bound
excitons, while plasmonic crystals (PCs), consisting of metal nanoparticles
that act as meta-atoms, exhibit collective plasmon modes and allow one to
tailor electric fields on the nanoscale. Recent experiments show that TMDC-PC
hybrids can reach the strong-coupling limit between excitons and plasmons
forming new quasiparticles, so-called plexcitons. To describe this coupling
theoretically, we develop a self-consistent Maxwell-Bloch theory for TMDC-PC
hybrid structures, which allows us to compute the scattered light in the near-
and far-field explicitly and provide guidance for experimental studies. Our
calculations reveal a spectral splitting signature of strong coupling of more
than $100\,$meV in gold-MoSe$_2$ structures with $30\,$nm nanoparticles,
manifesting in a hybridization of exciton and plasmon into two effective
plexcitonic bands. In addition to the hybridized states, we find a remaining
excitonic mode with significantly smaller coupling to the plasmonic near-field,
emitting directly into the far-field. Thus, hybrid spectra in the strong
coupling regime can contain three emission peaks.

<h3>Quantum Computed Green's Functions using a Cumulant Expansion of the  Lanczos Method</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this paper, we present a quantum computational method to calculate the
many-body Green's function matrix in a spin orbital basis. We apply our
approach to finite-sized fermionic Hubbard models and related impurity models
within Dynamical Mean Field Theory, and demonstrate the calculation of Green's
functions on Quantinuum's H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer. Our approach
involves a cumulant expansion of the Lanczos method, using Hamiltonian moments
as measurable expectation values. This bypasses the need for a large overhead
in the number of measurements due to repeated applications of the variational
quantum eigensolver (VQE), and instead measures the expectation value of the
moments with one set of measurement circuits. From the measured moments, the
tridiagonalised Hamiltonian matrix can be computed, which in turn yields the
Green's function via continued fractions. While we use a variational algorithm
to prepare the ground state in this work, we note that the modularity of our
implementation allows for other (non-variational) approaches to be used for the
ground state.

<h3>Stationary particle currents in sedimenting active matter wetting a wall</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09714" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09714</a>
<br>
<i>Matthieu Mangeat, Shauri Chakraborty, Adam Wysocki, Heiko Rieger</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently it was predicted, on the basis of a lattice gas model, that scalar
active matter in a gravitational field would rise against gravity up a
confining wall or inside a thin capillary - in spite of repulsive particle-wall
interactions [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 048001 (2020)]. In this paper we confirm
this prediction with sedimenting active Brownian particles (ABPs) in a box and
elucidate the mechanism leading to the formation of a meniscus rising above the
bulk of the sedimentation region. The height of the meniscus increases with the
activity of the system, algebraically with the P\'eclet number. The formation
of the meniscus is determined by a stationary circular particle current, a
vortex, centered at the base of the meniscus, whose size and strength increases
with the ABP activity. The origin of these vortices can be traced back to the
confinement of the ABPs in a box: already the stationary state of ideal
(non-interacting) ABPs without gravitation displays circular currents that
arrange in a highly symmetric way in the eight octants of the box. Gravitation
distorts this vortex configuration downward, leaving two major vortices at the
two side walls, with a strong downward flow along the walls. Repulsive
interactions between the ABPs change this situation only as soon as motility
induced phase separation (MIPS) sets in and forms a dense, sedimented liquid
region at the bottom, which pushes the center of the vortex upwards towards the
liquid-gas interface. Self-propelled particles therefore represent an
impressive realization of scalar active matter that forms stationary particle
currents being able to perform visible work against gravity or any other
external field, which we predict to be observable experimentally in active
colloids under gravitation.

<h3>Singlet-triplet-state readout in silicon-metal-oxide-semiconductor  double quantum dots</h3>

<br>
<br>
High-fidelity singlet-triplet state readout is essential for large-scale
quantum computing. However, the widely used threshold method of comparing a
mean value with the fixed threshold will limit the judgment accuracy,
especially for the relaxed triplet state, under the restriction of relaxation
time and signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we achieve an enhanced latching readout
based on Pauli spin blockade in a Si-MOS double quantum dot device and
demonstrate an average singlet-triplet state readout fidelity of 97.59% by the
threshold method. We reveal the inherent deficiency of the threshold method for
the relaxed triplet state classification and introduce machine learning as a
relaxation-independent readout method to reduce the misjudgment. The readout
fidelity for classifying the simulated single-shot traces can be improved to
99.67% by machine learning method, better than the threshold method of 97.54%
which is consistent with the experimental result. This work indicates that
machine learning method can be a strong potential candidate for alleviating the
restrictions of stably achieving high-fidelity and high-accuracy
singlet-triplet state readout in large-scale quantum computing.

The dimensionality of quantum materials strongly affects their physical
properties. Although many emergent phenomena, such as charge-density wave and
Luttinger liquid behavior, are well understood in one-dimensional (1D) systems,
the generalization to explore them in higher dimensional systems is still a
challenging task. In this study, we aim to bridge this gap by systematically
investigating the crystal and electronic structures of molybdenum-oxide family
compounds, where the contexture of 1D chains facilitates rich emergent
properties. While the quasi-1D chains in these materials share general
similarities, such as the motifs made up of MoO6 octahedrons, they exhibit vast
complexity and remarkable tunability. We disassemble the 1D chains in
molybdenum oxides with different dimensions and construct effective models to
excellently fit their low-energy electronic structures obtained by ab initio
calculations. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of such chains on other
physical properties of the materials and the practical significance of the
effective models. Our work establishes the molybdenum oxides as simple and
tunable model systems for studying and manipulating the dimensionality in
quantum systems.

We consider sample to sample fluctuations of the waiting time between the
detection of two consecutive electrons in quasi-one-dimensional disordered
conductors at zero temperature. We compute the full distribution of the mean
waiting time along the crossover from ballistic to localised transport in the
framework of the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar theory for an arbitrary number of
conduction channels. In particular we show that its variance, with respect to
disorder, displays universal fluctuations similar to the universal conductance
fluctuations in the metallic regime. We then discuss the statistical properties
of the jitter associated to quantum fluctuations of the waiting time.

<h3>Computational Exploration of Magnetic Saturation and Anisotropy Energy  for Nonstoichiometric Ferrite Compositions</h3>

<br>
<br>
A grand challenge in materials research is identifying the relationship
between composition and performance. Herein, we explore this relationship for
magnetic properties, specifically magnetic saturation (M$_s$) and magnetic
anisotropy energy (MAE) of ferrites. Ferrites are materials derived from
magnetite (which has the chemical formulae Fe$_3$O$_4$) that comprise metallic
elements in some combination such as Fe, Mn, Ni, Co, Cu and Zn. They are used
in a variety of applications such as electromagnetism, magnetic hyperthermia,
and magnetic imaging. Experimentally, synthesis and characterization of
magnetic materials is time consuming. In order to create insight to help guide
synthesis, we compute the relationship between ferrite composition and magnetic
properties using density functional theory (DFT). Specifically, we compute
M$_s$ and MAE for 571 ferrite structures with the formulae
M1$_x$M2$_y$Fe$_{3-x-y}$O$_4$, where M1 and M2 can be Mn, Ni, Co, Cu and/or Zn
and 0 $\le$ x $\le$ 1 and y = 1 - x. By varying composition, we were able to
vary calculated values of M$_s$ and MAE by up to 9.6$\times$10$^5$ A m$^{-1}$
and 14.1$\times$10$^5$ J m$^{-3}$, respectively. Our results suggest that
composition can be used to optimize magnetic properties for applications in
heating, imaging, and recording. This is mainly achieved by varying M$_s$, as
these applications are more sensitive to variation in M$_s$ than MAE.

We report temperature-dependent spectroscopy on the layered (n=4)
two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite (BA)(MA)PbI.
Helicity-resolved steady-state photoluminescence (PL) reveals no optical degree
of polarization. Time-resolved PL shows a photocarrier lifetime on the order of
nanoseconds. From simultaneaously recorded time-resolved differential
reflectivity (TR$\Delta$R) and time-resolved Kerr ellipticity (TRKE), a
photocarrier lifetime of a few nanoseconds and a spin dephasing time on the
order of picoseconds was found. This stark contrast in lifetimes clearly
explains the lack of spin polarization in steady-state PL. While we observe
clear temperature-dependent effects on the PL dynamics that can be related to
structural dynamics, the spin dephasing is nearly T-independent. Our results
highlight that spin dephasing in 2D (BA)(MA)PbI occurs at time scales faster
than the exciton recombination time, which poses a bottleneck for applications
aimingto utilize this degree of freedom.

<h3>Universal responses in nonmagnetic polar metals</h3>

<br>
<i>Fabian Jäger, Nicola A. Spaldin, Sayantika Bhowal</i>
<br>
<br>
We demonstrate that two phenomena, the kinetic magneto-electric effect and
the non-linear Hall effect, are universal to polar metals, as a consequence of
their coexisting and contraindicated polarization and metallicity. We show that
measurement of the effects provides a complete characterization of the nature
of the polar metal, in that the non-zero response components indicate the
direction of the polar axis, and the coefficients change sign on polarization
reversal and become zero in the non-polar phase. We illustrate our findings for
the case of electron-doped PbTiO$_3$ using a combination of density functional
theory and model Hamiltonian-based calculations. Our model Hamiltonian analysis
provides crucial insight into the microscopic origin of the effects, showing
that they originate from inversion-symmetry-breaking-induced inter-orbital
hoppings, which cause an asymmetric charge density quantified by odd-parity
charge multipoles. Our work both heightens the relevance of the kinetic
magneto-electric and non-linear Hall effects, and broadens the platform for
investigating and detecting odd-parity charge multipoles in metals.

Individual phases are commonly considered as the building blocks of
materials. However, the accurate theoretical prediction of properties of
individual phases remains elusive. The top-down approach by decoding genomic
building blocks of individual phases from experimental observations is
non-unique. The density functional theory (DFT), as the state-of-the-art
solution of quantum mechanics, prescribes the existence of a ground-state
configuration at zero K for a given system. It is self-evident that the
ground-state configuration alone is insufficient to describe a phase at finite
temperatures as symmetry-breaking non-ground-state configurations are excited
statistically at temperatures above zero K. Our multi-scale entropy approach
(recently terms as Zentropy theory) postulates that the entropy of a phase is
composed of the sum of the entropy of each configuration weighted by its
probability plus the configurational entropy among all configurations.
Consequently, the partition function of each configuration in statistical
mechanics needs to be evaluated by its free energy rather than total energy.
The combination of the ground- and non-ground-state configurations represents
the building blocks of materials and can quantitively predict free energy of
individual phases with the free energies of ground- and non-ground-state
configurations predicted from DFT, plus all properties derived from free energy
of individual phases.

The combined law of thermodynamics derived by Gibbs laid the foundation of
thermodynamics though only applicable to systems without internal processes.
Gibbs further derived the classical statistical thermodynamics in terms of the
probability of configurations in a system, which was extended to quantum
mechanics-based statistical thermodynamics by Landau, while the irreversible
thermodynamics was systemized by Onsager and expanded to chemical reactions by
Prigogine. The development of density function theory (DFT) by Kohn enabled the
quantitative prediction of properties of the ground-state configuration of a
system from quantum mechanics. Here, we will present our theories that
integrate quantum, statistical, and irreversible thermodynamics in a coherent
framework by utilizing the predicative capability of DFT to revise the
statistical thermodynamics (zentropy theory) and by keeping the entropy
production due to irreversible processes in the combine law of thermodynamics
to derive flux equations (theory of cross phenomena). The zentropy theory is
shown capable of predicting the free energy landscape including singularity and
instability at critical point and emergent positive or negative divergences of
properties. The theory of cross phenomena can predict the coefficients of
internal processes between conjugate variables (direct phenomena) and
non-conjugate variables (cross phenomena) in the combined law of
thermodynamics. Both are with inputs from DFT-based calculations only and
without fitting parameters.

We reconsider the phase diagram of a three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$
topological insulator in the presence of short-ranged potential disorder with
the insight that non-perturbative rare states destabilize the noninteracting
Dirac semimetal critical point separating different topological phases. Based
on our numerical data on the density of states, conductivity, and
wavefunctions, we argue that the putative Dirac semimetal line is destabilized
into a diffusive metal phase of finite extent due to non-perturbative effects
of rare regions. We discuss the implications of these results for past and
current experiments on doped topological insulators.

Topological materials hosting metallic edges characterized by integer
quantized conductivity in an insulating bulk have revolutionized our
understanding of transport in matter. The topological protection of these edge
states is based on symmetries and dimensionality. However, only
integer-dimensional models have been classified, and the interplay of topology
and fractals, which may have a non-integer dimension, remained largely
unexplored. Quantum fractals have recently been engineered in metamaterials,
but up to present no topological states were unveiled in fractals realized in
real materials. Here, we show theoretically and experimentally that topological
edge and corner modes arise in fractals formed upon depositing thin layers of
bismuth on an indium antimonide substrate. Scanning tunneling microscopy
reveals the appearance of (nearly) zero-energy modes at the corners of
Sierpi\'nski triangles, as well as the formation of outer and inner edge modes
at higher energies. Unexpectedly, a robust and sharp depleted mode appears at
the outer and inner edges of the samples at negative bias voltages. The
experimental findings are corroborated by theoretical calculations in the
framework of a continuum muffin-tin and a lattice tight-binding model. The
stability of the topological features to the introduction of a Rashba
spin-orbit coupling and disorder is discussed. This work opens the perspective
to novel electronics in real materials at non-integer dimensions with robust
and protected topological states.

Ultrafast X-ray diffraction by the LCLS free-electron laser has been used to
probe Charge Density Wave (CDW) systems under applied external currents. At
sufficiently low currents, CDW wavefronts bend in the direction transverse to
the 2k$_F$ wave vector. We show that this shear effect has the ability to focus
or defocus hard X-ray beams, depending of the current direction, making it an
electronic lens of a new kind, tunable at will from the Fraunhofer to the
Fresnel regime. The effect is interpreted using the fractional Fourier
transform showing how the macroscopic curvature of a nanometric modulation can
be beneficially used to modify the propagation of X-ray beams.

<br>
Superconducting (SC) tips for scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) can enhance
a wide range of surface science studies because they offer exquisite energy
resolution, allow the study of Josephson tunneling, or provide spatial contrast
based on the local interaction of the SC tip with the sample. The appeal of a
SC tip is also practical. An SC gap can be used to characterize and optimize
the noise of a low-temperature apparatus. Unlike typical samples, SC tips can
be made with less ordered materials, such as from SC polycrystalline wires or
by coating a normal metal tip with a superconductor. Those recipes either
require additional laboratory infrastructure or are carried out in ambient
conditions, leaving an oxidized tip behind. Here, we revisit the vacuum
cleaving of an Nb wire to prepare fully gapped tips in an accessible one-step
procedure. To show their utility, we measure the SC gap of Nb on Au(111) to
determine the base temperature of our microscope and to optimize its RF
filtering. The deliberate coating of the Nb tip with Au fully suppresses the SC
gap and we show how sputtering with Ar$^{+}$ ions can be used to gradually
recover the gap, promising tunability for tailored SC gaps sizes.

We study the effects of compressive and tensile biaxial strain on direct and
phonon-assisted Auger-Meitner recombination (AMR) in silicon using
first-principles calculations. We find that the application of strain has a
non-trivial effect on the AMR rate. For most AMR processes, the application of
strain increases the AMR rate. However, the recombination rate for the AMR
process involving two holes and one electron is suppressed by 38% under tensile
strain. We further analyze the specific phonon contributions that mediate the
phonon-assisted AMR mechanism, demonstrating the increased anisotropy under
strain. Our results indicate that the application of tensile strain increases
the lifetime of minority electron carriers in p-type silicon, and can be
leveraged to improve the efficiency of silicon devices.

Oxygen self-diffusion is key to understanding stoichiometry and defect
structures in oxide nuclear fuels. Experimentally, low activation-barrier
oxygen migration was found in ThO$_2$, a candidate nuclear fuel, possibly due
to short-circuit diffusion mechanisms. Here, we perform extensive molecular
dynamics simulations to show that various types of extended defects can enhance
oxygen self-diffusion with a much-reduced activation barrier in ThO$_2$. In
this work, we consider extended defects including 1D (dislocation), 2D (grain
boundary), and 3D (void) defects. Due to the distinct characteristics of each
type of extended defect, the modulation of oxygen diffusion varies. These
results provide a quantitative description of oxygen transport, which is
significantly enhanced within a close distance (nanometer scale) from the
extended defects. Among all these defects, grain boundary, particularly the
$\Sigma 3$ twin boundary with a low formation energy, exhibits the strongest
effect on increasing oxygen transport.

Soft x-ray microscopy plays an important role in modern spintronics. However,
the achievable resolution of most x-ray magnetic imaging experiments is above
10 nm, limiting access to fundamental and technologically relevant length
scales. Here, we demonstrate x-ray magnetic microscopy with 5 nm resolution by
combining holography-assisted coherent diffractive imaging with heterodyne
amplification of the weak magnetic signal. The gain in resolution and contrast
allows direct access to key magnetic properties, including domain wall profiles
and the position of pinning sites. The ability to detect and map such
properties with photons opens new horizons for element-specific, time-resolved,
and in-operando research on magnetic materials and beyond.

We show how to perform exact diagonalizations of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$
Fermi-Hubbard models on L-sites clusters separately in each irreducible
representation ({\it irrep}) of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$. Using the representation
theory of the unitary group $\mathrm{U}(L)$, we demonstrate that a convenient
orthonormal basis, on which matrix elements of the Hamiltonian are very simple,
is given by the set of {\it semi-standard Young tableaux} (or equivalently the
Gel'fand-Tsetlin patterns) corresponding to the targeted irrep. \,As an
application, we study the robustness of some $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ phases predicted
in the Heisenberg limit upon decreasing the on-site interaction on various
lattices of size $L \leq 12$ and for $2 \leq N \leq 6$. In particular, we show
that a long range color ordered phase emerges for moderate U for N=4 at filling
$1/4$ on the triangular lattice.
