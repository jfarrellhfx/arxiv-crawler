<h3>Comparing numerical methods for hydrodynamics in a 1D lattice model</h3>

In ergodic quantum spin chains, locally conserved quantities such as energy
or particle number generically evolve according to hydrodynamic equations as
they relax to equilibrium. We investigate the complexity of simulating
hydrodynamics at infinite temperature with multiple methods: time evolving
block decimation (TEBD), TEBD with density matrix truncation (DMT), the
recursion method with a universal operator growth hypothesis (R-UOG), and
operator-size truncated (OST) dynamics. Density matrix truncation and the OST
dynamics give consistent dynamical correlations to $t = 60/J$; and diffusion
constants agreeing within 1%. TEBD only converges for $t\lesssim 20$, but still
produces diffusion coefficients accurate within 1%. The universal operator
growth hypothesis fails to converge and only matches other methods on short
times. We see no evidence of long-time tails in either DMT or OST dynamics
simulations. At finite wavelength, we observe a crossover from purely
diffusive, overdamped decay of the energy density, to underdamped oscillatory
behavior similar to that of cold atom experiments. We dub this behavior "hot
band second sound", and offer a microscopically-motivated toy model.

<h3>On modelling and stabilizability of current-controlled piezoelectric  material</h3>

This paper presents a new modelling approach to fully dynamic electromagnetic
current-controlled piezoelectric composite models that require a combined
Lagrangian. To model the mechanical domains, we consider two different beam
theories, i.e. the Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories. We show that
both derived piezoelectric composite models are well-posed. Furthermore, we
show through analysis and simulations that both current-controlled
piezoelectric composites are asymptotically stabilizable through simple
electric feedback, which renders the system passive in a classical way for
certain system parameters. In this work, we also review several related
piezoelectric beams, actuators, and composite models.

<h3>DeepCrysTet: A Deep Learning Approach Using Tetrahedral Mesh for  Predicting Properties of Crystalline Materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06852" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06852</a>

Machine learning (ML) is becoming increasingly popular for predicting
material properties to accelerate materials discovery. Because material
properties are strongly affected by its crystal structure, a key issue is
converting the crystal structure into the features for input to the ML model.
Currently, the most common method is to convert the crystal structure into a
graph and predicting its properties using a graph neural network (GNN). Some
GNN models, such as crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) and
atomistic line graph neural network (ALIGNN), have achieved highly accurate
predictions of material properties. Despite these successes, using a graph to
represent a crystal structure has the notable limitation of losing the crystal
structure's three-dimensional (3D) information. In this work, we propose
DeepCrysTet, a novel deep learning approach for predicting material properties,
which uses crystal structures represented as a 3D tetrahedral mesh generated by
Delaunay tetrahedralization. DeepCrysTet provides a useful framework that
includes a 3D mesh generation method, mesh-based feature design, and neural
network design. The experimental results using the Materials Project dataset
show that DeepCrysTet significantly outperforms existing GNN models in
classifying crystal structures and achieves state-of-the-art performance in
predicting elastic properties.

<h3>Manipulating Vortices with Domain Walls in Superconductor-Ferromagnet  Heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06866" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06866</a>

Vortices are point-like topological defects in superconductors whose motion
dictates superconducting properties and controls device performance. In
superconductor-ferromagnet heterostructures, vortices interact with topological
defects in the ferromagnet such as line-like domain walls. While in previous
heterostructure generations, vortex-domain wall interactions were mediated by
stray fields; in new heterostructure families, more important become exchange
fields and spin-orbit coupling. However, spin-orbit coupling's role in
vortex-domain wall interactions remains unexplored. Here we uncover, via
numerical simulations and Ginzburg-Landau theory, that Rashba spin-orbit
coupling induces magnetoelectric interactions between vortices and domain walls
that crucially depend on the wall's winding direction$-$its helicity. The
wall's helicity controls whether vortices are pushed or dragged by N\'eel
walls, and their gliding direction along Bloch walls. Our work capitalizes on
interactions between topological defects from different order parameters and of
different dimensionality to engineer enhanced functionality.

<h3>Flux trapping in hydrides not yet confirmed</h3>

In Ref. [1], Minkov et al reported the time dependence of magnetic moment of
hydride materials under high pressure in a diamond anvil cell. Here we point
out that the straight lines interpolated with the measurement results give the
misleading impression that thermal flux creep in superconductors decays
linearly with time. To dispel this misconception, we correctly interpolated
logarithmic decay curves. Then, it has become apparent that there is no reason
to assume that the measured magnetic moment originates from flux trapping,
i.e., there is no reason to believe that persistent currents are circulating in
hydride materials under high pressure and that they are superconductors.

<h3>Dynamics of vacancy-induced modes in the non-Abelian Kitaev spin liquid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06891" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06891</a>
<br>
<i>Wen-Han Kao, Gábor B. Halász, Natalia B. Perkins</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the dynamical response of vacancy-induced quasiparticle excitations
in the site-diluted Kitaev spin liquid with a magnetic field. Due to the
flux-binding effect and the emergence of dangling Majorana fermions around each
spin vacancy, the low-energy physics is governed by a set of vacancy-induced
quasi-zero-energy modes. These localized modes result in unique characteristics
of the dynamical spin correlation functions, which intriguingly mimic the
single-quasiparticle density of states and further exhibit a
quasi-zero-frequency peak. By recognizing the potential observability of these
local correlation functions via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we show
how the STM response is sensitive to the local flux configuration, the magnetic
field strength, and the vacancy concentration. Constructing a simple model of
the localized modes, we also elucidate how the local correlation functions can
be interpreted in terms of the hybridization between these modes.

<h3>Field theory for the dynamics of the open $O(N)$ model</h3>

A field theory approach for the nonequilibrium relaxation dynamics in open
systems at late times is developed. In the absence of conservation laws, all
excitations are subject to dissipation. Nevertheless, ordered stationary states
satisfy Goldstone's theorem. It implies a vanishing damping rate at small
momenta, which in turn allows for competition between environment-induced
dissipation and thermalization due to collisions. We derive the dynamic theory
in the symmetry-broken phase of an $O(N)$-symmetric field theory based on an
expansion of the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action to
next-to-leading order in $1/N$ and highlight the analogies and differences to
the corresponding theory for closed systems. A central result of this approach
is the systematic derivation of an \emph{open-system Boltzmann equation}, which
takes a very different form from its closed-system counterpart due to the
absence of well-defined quasiparticles. As a consequence of the general
structure of its derivation, it applies to open, gapless field theories that
satisfy certain testable conditions, which we identify here. Specifically for
the $O(N)$ model, we use scaling analysis and numerical simulations to show
that interactions are screened efficiently at small momenta and, therefore, the
late-time evolution is effectively collisionless. This implies that
fluctuations induced by a quench dissipate into the environment before they
thermalize. Goldstone's theorem also constrains the dynamics far from
equilibrium, which is used to show that the order parameter equilibrates more
quickly for quenches preserving the $O(N)$ symmetry than those breaking it
explicitly.

<h3>RuO$_2$: a puzzle to be solved</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06909" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06909</a>

<br>
Altermagnetism is a topic that has lately been gaining attention and the
RuO$_2$ compound is among one of the most studied altermagnetic candidates.
However, the survey of available literature on RuO$_2$ properties suggests that
there is no consensus about the magnetism of this material. By performing
density functional theory calculations, we show that the electronic properties
of stoichiometric RuO$_2$ are described in terms of a smaller Hubbard $U$
within DFT+$U$ than the value required to have magnetism. We further argue that
Ru vacancies can actually aid the formation of a magnetic state in RuO$_2$.
This in turn suggests that a characterization of the amount of Ru vacancies in
experimental samples might help the resolution of the controversy between the
different experimental results.

<h3>Spectral effects on the energy harvesting efficiency of 2- and  4-terminal tandem photovoltaics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06914" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06914</a>
<br>
<i>Robert Witteck, John. F. Geisz, Emily. L. Warren, William. E. McMahon</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we investigate how a varying spectral irradiance and top cell
bandgap affect the energy yield of 2T and 4T perovskite//silicon tandem solar
cells under outdoor operating conditions. For the comparison, we first validate
an optoelectronic model employing a 1-year outdoor data set for a 4T mechanical
stacked GaAs on Silicon tandem device. We then use our verified model to
simulate perovskite//silicon tandem devices with a varying perovskite top cell
bandgap for a location in Golden, Colorado, USA. We introduce a spectral
binning method to efficiently reduce and improve the visualization of the
1-min-resolved environmental data while maintaining the simulation accuracy.
Our findings reveal that, for a device that is current-matched under standard
testing conditions, the annual spectral deviation reduces the energy harvesting
efficiency by only 2%$_\mathrm{rel}$. When additional realistic losses for the
4T are taken into account, 2T devices are shown to have an energy-harvesting
efficiency that is at parity or higher. Deviations in the top cell bandgap of
more than 0.1 eV from current matching result in a reduced energy-harvesting
efficiency of more than 5%$_\mathrm{rel}$ for the 2T tandem device.

<h3>In-plane magnetic field-driven conductance modulations in topological  insulator kinks</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present low-temperature magnetoconductance measurements on
Bi$_{1.5}$Sb$_{0.5}$Te$_{1.8}$Se$_{1.2}$ kinks with ribbon-shaped legs. The
conductance displays a clear dependence on the in-plane magnetic field
orientation. The conductance modulation is consistent with orbital
effect-driven trapping of the topological surface states on different side
facets of the legs of the kink, which affects their transmission across the
kink. This magnetic field-driven trapping and conductance pattern can be
explained with a semiclassical picture and is supported by quantum transport
simulations. The interpretation is corroborated by varying the angle of the
kink and analyzing the temperature dependence of the observed
magnetoconductance pattern, indicating the importance of phase coherence along
the cross section perimeter of the kink legs.

<h3>Ab initio description of bcc iron with correlation matrix  renormalization theory</h3>

We applied the ab initio spin-polarized Correlation Matrix Renormalization
Theory (CMRT) to the ferromagnetic state of the bulk BCC iron. We showed that
it was capable of reproducing the equilibrium physical properties and the
pressure-volume curve in good comparison with experiments. We then focused on
the analysis of its local electronic correlations. By exploiting different
local fluctuation-related physical quantities as measures of electronic
correlation within target orbits, we elucidated the different roles of $t_{2g}$
and $e_g$ states in both spin channels and presented compelling evidence to
showcase this distinction in their electronic correlation.

<h3>Electronic properties of c-BN/diamond heterostructures for  high-frequency high-power applications</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06955" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06955</a>
<br>
<i>Jeffrey T. Mullen, James A. Boulton, Minghao Pan, Ki Wook Kim</i>
<br>
<br>
Using first principles calculations, this work investigates the suitability
of diamond/c-BN heterojunctions for high frequency, high power device
applications. The key quantities of band offsets and interface charge
polarization are examined for different crystallographic orientations [(110),
(111), or (100)], bond terminations (C-B or C-N), and substrates (diamond or
c-BN). The results indicate that both the (111) and (100) structures with polar
interfaces are likely to be a type-I alignment with the diamond conduction and
valence band extrema nested within the c-BN bandgap, whereas the non-polar
(110) counterpart may form type II as the valence band of c-BN is shifted down
substantially lower. The (111) and (100) structures also show net charge
polarization in a narrow region at the interface. The electron-deficient and
electron-rich nature of the C-B and C-N bonding are found to induce charge
redistribution leading to an essentially 2D sheet of negative and positive
polarization. With the predicted band alignments suitable for carrier
confinement as well as the possibility of the modulation and polarization
doping, the diamond/c-BN heterostructures are a promising candidate for
high-performance electronic devices with a highly conductive 2D channel. Both
p-type and n-type devices appear possible with a judicious choice of the
heterojunction configuration.

<h3>Jaynes Machine: The universal microstructure of deep neural networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06960" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06960</a>
<br>
<i>Venkat Venkatasubramanian, N. Sanjeevrajan, Manasi Khandekar</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a novel theory of the microstructure of deep neural networks.
Using a theoretical framework called statistical teleodynamics, which is a
conceptual synthesis of statistical thermodynamics and potential game theory,
we predict that all highly connected layers of deep neural networks have a
universal microstructure of connection strengths that is distributed
lognormally ($LN({\mu}, {\sigma})$). Furthermore, under ideal conditions, the
theory predicts that ${\mu}$ and ${\sigma}$ are the same for all layers in all
networks. This is shown to be the result of an arbitrage equilibrium where all
connections compete and contribute the same effective utility towards the
minimization of the overall loss function. These surprising predictions are
shown to be supported by empirical data from six large-scale deep neural
networks in real life. We also discuss how these results can be exploited to
reduce the amount of data, time, and computational resources needed to train
large deep neural networks.

<h3>Modulating Resonant Electronic Coupling of Tungsten Diselenide  Monolayers with Vanadyl Phthalocyanine for Spin-Valley Polarization Control</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06979" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06979</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Combining the synthetic tunability of molecular compounds with the optical
selection rules of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) that derive from
spin-valley coupling could provide interesting opportunities for the readout of
quantum information. However, little is known about the electronic and spin
interactions at such interfaces and the influence on spin-valley relaxation. In
this work we investigate various heterojunctions of vanadyl phthalocyanine
(VOPc) thermally evaporated on WSe$_2$ and find that local ordering of the
molecular layer plays an important role in the electronic perturbation of
WSe$_2$, which in turn directly influences the spin-valley polarization
lifetime. A thin molecular layer results in a hybrid state which destroys the
spin-valley polarization almost instantaneously, whereas a thicker molecular
layer with well-defined local ordering shows minimal electronic perturbation
and results in longer-lived spin-valley polarization than the WSe$_2$ monolayer
alone.

<h3>Universal and nonuniversal probability laws in Markovian open quantum  dynamics subject to generalized reset processes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06981" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06981</a>
<br>
<i>Federico Carollo, Igor Lesanovsky, Juan P. Garrahan</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider quantum jump trajectories of Markovian open quantum systems
subject to stochastic in time resets of their state to an initial
configuration. The reset events provide a partitioning of quantum trajectories
into consecutive time intervals, defining sequences of random variables from
the values of a trajectory observable within each of the intervals. For
observables related to functions of the quantum state, we show that the
probability of certain orderings in the sequences obeys a universal law. This
law does not depend on the chosen observable and, in case of Poissonian reset
processes, not even on the details of the dynamics. When considering (discrete)
observables associated with the counting of quantum jumps, the probabilities in
general lose their universal character. Universality is only recovered in cases
when the probability of observing equal outcomes in a same sequence is
vanishingly small, which we can achieve in a weak reset rate limit. Our results
extend previous findings on classical stochastic processes [N.~R.~Smith et al.,
EPL {\bf 142}, 51002 (2023)] to the quantum domain and to state-dependent reset
processes, shedding light on relevant aspects for the emergence of universal
probability laws.

<h3>Accelerated Modelling of Interfaces for Electronic Devices using Graph  Neural Networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06995" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06995</a>

Modern microelectronic devices are composed of interfaces between a large
number of materials, many of which are in amorphous or polycrystalline phases.
Modeling such non-crystalline materials using first-principles methods such as
density functional theory is often numerically intractable. Recently, graph
neural networks (GNNs) have shown potential to achieve linear complexity with
accuracies comparable to ab-initio methods. Here, we demonstrate the
applicability of GNNs to accelerate the atomistic computational pipeline for
predicting macroscopic transistor transport characteristics via learning
microscopic physical properties. We generate amorphous heterostructures,
specifically the HfO$_{2}$-SiO$_{2}$-Si semiconductor-dielectric transistor
gate stack, via GNN predicted atomic forces, and show excellent accuracy in
predicting transport characteristics including injection velocity for nanoslab
silicon channels. This work paves the way for faster and more scalable methods
to model modern advanced electronic devices via GNNs.

<h3>Local strain inhomogeneities during the electrical triggering of a  metal-insulator transition revealed by the x-ray microscopy</h3>

<br>
<br>
Electrical triggering of a metal-insulator transition (MIT) often results in
the formation of characteristic spatial patterns such as a metallic filament
percolating through an insulating matrix or an insulating barrier splitting a
conducting matrix. When the MIT triggering is driven by electrothermal effects,
the temperature of the filament or barrier can be substantially higher than the
rest of material. Using x-ray microdiffraction and dark-field x-ray microscopy,
we show that electrothermal MIT triggering leads to the development of an
inhomogeneous strain profile across the switching device, even when the
material does not undergo a 1st order structural phase transition coinciding
with the MIT. Diffraction measurements further reveal evidence of lattice
distortions and twinning occurring within the MIT switching device,
highlighting a qualitative distinction between the electrothermal process and
equilibrium thermal lattice expansion in nonlinear electrical systems.
Electrically induced strain development, lattice distortions, and twinning
could have important contributions in the MIT triggering process and could
drive the material into non-equilibrium states, providing an unconventional
pathway to explore the phase space of strongly correlated electronic systems.

<h3>Magnetic Field Effects and Transverse Ratchets in Charge Lattices  Coupled to Asymmetric Substrates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07004" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07004</a>
<br>
<i>C.J.O. Reichhardt, C. Reichhardt</i>
<br>
<br>
We examine a charge lattice coupled to a one-dimensional asymmetric potential
in the presence of an applied magnetic field, which induces gyrotropic effects
in the charge motion. This system could be realized for Wigner crystals in
nanostructured samples, dusty plasmas, or other classical charge-ordered states
where gyrotropic motion and damping can arise. For zero magnetic field, an
applied external ac drive can produce a ratchet effect in which the particles
move along the easy flow direction of the substrate asymmetry. The zero field
ratchet effect can only occur when the ac drive is aligned with the substrate
asymmetry direction; however, when a magnetic field is added, the gyrotropic
forces generate a Hall effect that leads to a variety of new behaviors,
including a transverse ratchet motion that occurs when the ac drive is
perpendicular to the substrate asymmetry direction. We show that this system
exhibits commensuration effects as well as reversals in the ratchet effect and
the Hall angle of the motion. The magnetic field also produces a nonmonotonic
ratchet efficiency when the particles become localized at high fields.

<h3>Stochastic 3D modeling of nanostructured NVP/C active material particles  for sodium-ion batteries</h3>

A data-driven modeling approach is presented to quantify the influence of
morphology on effective properties in nanostructured sodium vanadium phosphate
$\mathrm{Na}_3\mathrm{V}_2(\mathrm{PO}_4)_3$/ carbon composites (NVP/C), which
are used as cathode material in sodium-ion batteries. This approach is based on
the combination of advanced imaging techniques, experimental nanostructure
characterization and stochastic modeling of the 3D nanostructure consisting of
NVP, carbon and pores. By 3D imaging and subsequent post-processing involving
image segmentation, the spatial distribution of NVP is resolved in 3D, and the
spatial distribution of carbon and pores is resolved in 2D. Based on this
information, a parametric stochastic model, specifically a Pluri-Gaussian
model, is calibrated to the 3D morphology of the nanostructured NVP/C
particles. Model validation is performed by comparing the nanostructure of
simulated NVP/C composites with image data in terms of morphological
descriptors which have not been used for model calibration. Finally, the
stochastic model is used for predictive simulation to quantify the effect of
varying the amount of carbon while keeping the amount of NVP constant. The
presented methodology opens new possibilities for a ressource-efficient
optimization of the morphology of NVP/C particles by modeling and simulation.

The traditional picture of solid-solid phase transformations assumes an
ordered parent phase transforms to an ordered daughter phase via a single
unique pathway. This picture explains many fundamental pressure-induced
displacive phase transitions in basic elements like carbon (1), silicon (2),
copper (3), and iron (4). Zirconium and its prototypical phase transition from
hexagonal closed-pack (hcp) to simple hexagonal structure has generated
considerable controversy over several decades regarding which mechanism
mediates the transformation. However, a lack of in-situ measurements over the
relevant atomistic timescales has hindered our ability to identify the true
mechanism. In this study, we exploit femtosecond X-ray diffraction coupled with
nanosecond laser compression to give unprecedented insights into the
complexities of how materials transform at the lattice level. We observe
single-crystal zirconium transforming from hcp to simple hexagonal structure
via not one but three competing pathways simultaneously, the third of which has
never been detected before. Concurrently, during the transition, we also
observe a broad diffuse background underlying the sharp Bragg's diffraction. We
corroborate our observation of the diffuse signal with multimillion-atom
molecular dynamics simulations using a machine-learned interatomic potential.
Our integrated experimental-computational approach lays bare the complex
dynamics unfolding in zirconium over nanosecond timescales. Our study
demonstrates that the traditional mechanistic view of transitions may fail for
even an elemental metal and that the mechanisms by which materials transform
are far more intricate than generally thought.

The integration of machine learning techniques in materials discovery has
become prominent in materials science research and has been accompanied by an
increasing trend towards open-source data and tools to propel the field.
Despite the increasing usefulness and capabilities of these tools, developers
neglecting to follow reproducible practices creates a significant barrier for
researchers looking to use or build upon their work. In this study, we
investigate the challenges encountered while attempting to reproduce a section
of the results presented in "A general-purpose machine learning framework for
predicting properties of inorganic materials." Our analysis identifies four
major categories of challenges: (1) reporting computational dependencies, (2)

${\lambda}$-RhO$_2$, a prototype 4d transition metal oxide, has been prepared
by oxidative delithiation of spinel LiRh$_2$O$_4$ using ceric ammonium nitrate.
Average-structure studies of this RhO$_2$ polytype, including synchrotron
powder X-ray diffraction and electron diffraction, indicate the room
temperature structure to be tetragonal, in the space group I41/amd, with a
first-order structural transition to cubic Fd-3m at T = 345 K on warming.
Synchrotron X-ray pair distribution function analysis and $^7$Li solid state
nuclear magnetic resonance measurements suggest that the room temperature
structure displays local Rh-Rh bonding. The formation of these local dimers
appears to be associated with a metal-to insulator transition with a
non-magnetic ground state, as also supported by density functional theory-based
electronic structure calculations. This contribution demonstrates the power of
soft chemistry to kinetically stabilize a surprisingly simple binary oxide
compound.

In the realm of quantum-effect devices and materials, two-dimensional
electron gases (2DEGs) stand as fundamental structures that promise
transformative technologies. However, the presence of impurities and defects in
2DEGs poses substantial challenges, impacting carrier mobility, conductivity,
and quantum coherence time. To address this, we harness the power of scanning
gate microscopy (SGM) and employ three distinct machine learning techniques to
estimate the background potential of 2DEGs from SGM data: image-to-image
translation using generative adversarial neural networks, cellular neural
network, and evolutionary search. Our findings, despite data constraints,
highlight the effectiveness of an evolutionary search algorithm in this
context, offering a novel approach for defect analysis. This work not only
advances our understanding of 2DEGs but also underscores the potential of
machine learning in probing quantum materials, with implications for quantum
computing and nanoelectronics.

The realization of topological insulators induced by correlation effects is
one of the main issues of modern condensed matter physics. An intriguing
example of the correlated topological insulators is a magnetic Chern insulator
induced by a noncoplanar multiple-Q magnetic order. Although the realization of
the magnetic Chern insulator has been studied in the classical limit of the
Kondo lattice model, research on the magnetic Chern insulator in the original
Kondo lattice model is limited. Here, we investigate the possibility of the
many-body Chern insulator with the noncoplanar triple-Q magnetic order in the
Kondo lattice model on a triangular lattice. Using the many-variable
variational Monte Carlo method, we reveal that the triple-Q magnetic order
becomes a ground state at quarter filling in an intermediate Kondo coupling
region. We also show that the many-body Chern number is quantized to one in the
triple-Q magnetic ordered phase utilizing the polarization operators. Our
results provide a pathway for the realization of the many-body Chern insulator
in correlated electron systems.

<h3>Absence of topological Hall effect in Fe$_x$Rh$_{100-x}$ epitaxial  films: revisiting their phase diagram</h3>

A series of Fe$_x$Rh$_{100-x}$ ($30 \leq x \leq 57$) films were epitaxially
grown using magnetron sputtering, and were systematically studied by
magnetization-, electrical resistivity-, and Hall resistivity measurements.
After optimizing the growth conditions, phase-pure Fe$_{x}$Rh$_{100-x}$ films
were obtained, and their magnetic phase diagram was revisited. The
ferromagnetic (FM) to antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition is limited at narrow
Fe-contents with $48 \leq x \leq 54$ in the bulk Fe$_x$Rh$_{100-x}$ alloys. By
contrast, the FM-AFM transition in the Fe$_x$Rh$_{100-x}$ films is extended to
cover a much wider $x$ range between 33 % and 53 %, whose critical temperature
slightly decreases as increasing the Fe-content. The resistivity jump and
magnetization drop at the FM-AFM transition are much more significant in the
Fe$_x$Rh$_{100-x}$ films with $\sim$50 % Fe-content than in the Fe-deficient
films, the latter have a large amount of paramagnetic phase. The
magnetoresistivity (MR) is rather weak and positive in the AFM state, while it
becomes negative when the FM phase shows up, and a giant MR appears in the
mixed FM- and AFM states. The Hall resistivity is dominated by the ordinary
Hall effect in the AFM state, while in the mixed state or high-temperature FM
state, the anomalous Hall effect takes over. The absence of topological Hall
resistivity in Fe$_{x}$Rh$_{100-x}$ films with various Fe-contents implies that
the previously observed topological Hall effect is most likely extrinsic. We
propose that the anomalous Hall effect caused by the FM iron moments at the
interfaces nicely explains the hump-like anomaly in the Hall resistivity. Our
systematic investigations may offer valuable insights into the spintronics
based on iron-rhodium alloys.

The prediction of chemical synthesis pathways plays a pivotal role in
materials science research. Challenges, such as the complexity of synthesis
pathways and the lack of comprehensive datasets, currently hinder our ability
to predict these chemical processes accurately. However, recent advancements in
generative artificial intelligence (GAI), including automated text generation
and question-answering systems, coupled with fine-tuning techniques, have
facilitated the deployment of large-scale AI models tailored to specific
domains. In this study, we harness the power of the LLaMA2-7B model and enhance
it through a learning process that incorporates 13,878 pieces of structured
material knowledge data. This specialized AI model, named MatChat, focuses on
predicting inorganic material synthesis pathways. MatChat exhibits remarkable
proficiency in generating and reasoning with knowledge in materials science.
Although MatChat requires further refinement to meet the diverse material
design needs, this research undeniably highlights its impressive reasoning
capabilities and innovative potential in the field of materials science.
MatChat is now accessible online and open for use, with both the model and its
application framework available as open source. This study establishes a robust
foundation for collaborative innovation in the integration of generative AI in

We have observed a new optical transition in the photoreflectance spectra of
indirect-gap BiOCl thin films, which were grown on SrTiO$_3$ substrates. The
position of this transition is close in energy to its bulk critical point
energy. Moreover, these are significantly lower than a higher-lying direct-type
critical point from an energetic point of view. The spectral line shape
analysis for our observed signal suggests the presence of an excitonic effect
of this compound. We determined its dependence of the optical anomaly on
temperature ranging from 80 K to room temperature. We adopted the Varshni model
for this analysis. At last, we compared phononic properties of BiOCl with those
of an element and binary semiconductors.

Zirconium pentatelluride (ZrTe$_{5}$), a system with a Dirac linear band
across the Fermi level and anomalous transport features, has attracted
considerable research interest for it is predicted to be located at the
boundary between strong and weak topological insulators separated by a
topological semimetal phase. However, the experimental verification of the
topological phase transition and the topological ground state in ZrTe$_{5}$ is
full of controversies, mostly due to the difficulty of precisely capturing the
small gap evolution with single-particle band structure measurements.
Alternatively, the collective excitations of electric charges, known as
plasmons, in Dirac systems exhibiting unique behavior, can well reflect the
topological nature of the band structure. Here, using reflective
high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), we investigate the
temperature-dependent collective excitations of ZrTe$_{5}$, and discover that
the plasmon energy in ZrTe$_{5}$ is proportional to the $1/3$ power of the
carrier density $n$, which is a unique feature of plasmons in three-dimensional
Dirac systems \lyxadded{51189}{Wed Sep 13 06:29:07 2023}{or hyperbolic

resistivity anomaly of ZrTe$_{5}$ can be attributed to the

<h3>Paste Rheology and Surface Charge of Calcined Kaolinite</h3>

Partial substitution of the clinker in the cement by a supplementary
cementitious material (SCM) is one of the main solutions to reduce the carbon
footprint. Calcined kaolinite is a good candidate due to its availability and
relatively high reactivity compared to other SCMs. The main issue with these
calcined clay types of cements is the high-water demand at low clinker factors,
a problem which remains not well understood. In this proceeding, we will show
the role played by electrostatic interactions in the paste stiffening using as
a model system pure calcined kaolinite paste prepared at various pH as well as
salt types and concentrations. The study combines dynamic rheometry
measurements in strain-sweep modes, surface charge characterization using
potentiometric titration and electrophoretic measurements as well as
calculations of inter-particle interactions using Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations
in the framework of the primitive model. The calcined kaolinite is found to
possess a negative permanent charge, presumably due to the Si(IV)/Al(III)
substitution, and a titratable charge (as due to ionization of silanol and
aluminol surface groups) with a point of zero proton charge at pH 4.65. In
conditions relevant for cement paste, the calcined clay bear a strong negative
charge ~ 300 mC/m2. The rheological measurements reveal that the paste
stiffening is highly dependent on the pH, salt concentration and type as
expected for systems controlled by electrostatic interactions. The stiffness
increases with the salt concentration at natural pH and is the largest in
solutions buffered with Ca(OH)2, that is at high Ca2+ concentrations and pH
where the negative charge of the calcined clay is the strongest. The MC
simulations of the inter-particle interactions are found to qualitatively
explain the observed variation in the paste stiffness.

<br>
The spin-dependent band structure of CoS$_2$ which is a candidate for a
half-metallic ferromagnet was investigated by both spin- and angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, in order to reappraise
the half-metallicity and electronic correlations. We determined the
three-dimensional Fermi surface and the spin-dependent band structure. As a
result, we found that a part of the minority spin bands is on the occupied side
in the vicinity of the Fermi level, providing spectroscopic evidence that
CoS$_2$ is not but very close to a half-metal. Band calculations using density
functional theory with generalized gradient approximation showed a good
agreement with the observed majority spin $e_g$ bands, while it could not
explain the observed band width of the minority-spin eg bands. On the other
hand, theoretical calculations using dynamical mean field theory could better
reproduce the strong mass renormalization in the minority-spin $e_g$ bands. All
those results strongly suggest the presence of anomalously enhanced
spin-dependent electron correlation effects on the electronic structure in the
vicinity of the half-metallic state. We also report the temperature dependence
of the electronic structure across the Curie temperature and discuss the
mechanism of the thermal demagnetization. Our discovery of the anomalously
large spin-dependent electronic correlations not only demonstrates a key factor
in understanding the electronic structure of half-metals but also provides a
motivation to improve theoretical calculations on spin-polarized strongly
correlated systems.

Fabric softeners are formulated to enhance textile softness and impart a
pleasant scent. One of the most efficient technologies for controlled fragrance
delivery onto fabrics involves encapsulating scent molecules in polymer
capsules. Here, we investigate the adsorption of anionic fragrance cap-sules on
cotton fabrics with the goal of reducing the reliance on palm-oil-derived
surfactants. First, we employ 200 nm-cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) as a reliable
model for cotton fibers. CNC enables us to explore interactions among various
softener components, including surfactants, guar biopolymers, and fragrances,
using physical chemistry techniques applied to bulk dispersions. The primary
objec-tive is to elucidate the role of surfactant vesicles, the primary
ingredient in textile conditioners, in the association between fragrance
capsules and cotton. Secondly, we examine the influence of bi-opolymers present
in a newly developed, environmentally friendly softener on this association.
Our findings demonstrate that anionic fragrance capsules are deposited onto
cotton microfibers in the presence of either cationic surfactants or guar
biopolymers, driven by electrostatic interactions. Scanning electron microscopy
confirms capsule adsorption on textile fibers when these cationic in-gredients
are present. Understanding the interaction mechanisms between fragrance
capsules and cotton fabrics, as well as the roles played by other softener
components, can facilitate the design of more efficient and sustainable
formulations.

<h3>Ultimate sharpness of the tunneling resonance in vertical  heterostructures</h3>

Heterostructures comprised of two two-dimensional electron systems (2DES)
separated by a dielectric exhibit resonant tunneling when the band structures
of both systems are aligned. It is commonly assumed that the height and width
of the resonant peak in the tunneling current is determined by electron
scattering and rotational misalignment of crystal structures of the 2DES. We
identify two fundamental factors limiting the maximum height and steepness of
the resonance: coupling to contacts and tunnel splitting of energy levels. The
upper limit of the tunneling current is the number of electrons available for
tunneling times half the tunnel coupling between the 2DES. As a result of a
tradeoff between the contact-induced level broadening and contact resistance,
the maximum current is only achievable when the coupling to contacts equals the
tunnel level splitting. According to our model calculations, the limiting
behavior can be observed in double-gated graphene/few-layer hexagonal boron
nitride/graphene heterostructures.

Controlling the magnetic state of two-dimensional (2D) materials is crucial
for spintronic applications. By employing data-mining and autonomous density
functional theory calculations, we demonstrate the switching of magnetic
properties of 2D non-van der Waals materials upon hydrogen passivation. The
magnetic configurations are tuned to states with flipped and enhanced moments.
For 2D CdTiO$_3$ - a nonmagnetic compound in the pristine case - we observe an
onset of ferromagnetism upon hydrogenation. Further investigation of the
magnetization density of the pristine and passivated systems provides a
detailed analysis of modified local spin symmetries and the emergence of
ferromagnetism. Our results indicate that selective surface passivation is a
powerful tool for tailoring magnetic properties of nanomaterials such as
non-vdW 2D compounds.

<h3>Mobility and diffusion of intruders in granular suspensions. Einstein  relation</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Enskog kinetic equation is considered to determine the mobility $\lambda$
and diffusion $D$ transport coefficients of intruders immersed in a granular
gas of inelastic hard spheres (grains). Intruders and grains are in contact
with a thermal bath, which plays the role of a background gas. As usual, the
influence of the latter on the dynamics of intruders and grains is accounted
for via a viscous drag force plus a stochastic Langevin-like term proportional
to the background temperature $T_\text{b}$. The transport coefficients
$\lambda$ and $D$ are determined by solving the kinetic equation by means of
the Chapman--Enskog method adapted to dissipative dynamics. Both transport
coefficients are given in terms of the solutions of two integral equations
which are approximately solved up to the second order in a Sonine polynomial
expansion. Theoretical results are compared against numerical solutions of the
inelastic Enskog equation by means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)
method. Good agreement between theory and simulations is in general found,
specially in the case of the second Sonine approximation. The knowledge of the
coefficients $\lambda$ and $D$ allow us to assess the departure of the Einstein
relation $\epsilon=D/(T_{\text{b}}\lambda)$ from 1. As expected from previous
results for driven granular gases, it is shown that the origin of the deviation
of $\epsilon$ from 1 is only due to the non-Maxwellian behavior of reference
state of intruders (measured by the cumulant $c_0$) when the bath temperature
$T_\text{b}$ is replaced by the intruder temperature $T_0$ in the Einstein
relation. Since the magnitude of $c_0$ is in general very small, deviations of
the (modified) Einstein relation $\epsilon_0=D/(T_0\lambda)$ from 1 cannot be
detected in computer simulations of dilute granular gases. This conclusion
agrees well with previous computer simulation results.

The statistical properties of turbulent flows are fundamentally different
from those of systems at equilibrium due to the presence of an energy flux from
the scales of injection to those where energy is dissipated by the viscous
forces: a scenario dubbed "direct energy cascade". From a statistical mechanics
point of view, the cascade picture prevents the existence of detailed balance,
which holds at equilibrium, e.g. in the inviscid and unforced case. Here, we
aim at characterizing the non-equilibrium properties of turbulent cascades in a
shell model of turbulence by studying an asymmetric time-correlation function
and the relaxation behavior of an energy perturbation, measured at scales
smaller or larger than the perturbed one. We shall contrast the behavior of
these two observables in both non-equilibrium (forced and dissipated) and
equilibrium (inviscid and unforced) cases. Finally, we shall show that
equilibrium and non-equilibrium physics coexist in the same system, namely at
scales larger and smaller, respectively, of the forcing scale.

<h3>Superfluidity meets the solid-state: frictionless mass-transport through  a (5,5) carbon-nanotube</h3>

<br>
<br>
Superfluidity is a well-characterized quantum phenomenon which entails
frictionless-motion of mesoscopic particles through a superfluid, such as
$^4$He or dilute atomic-gases at very low temperatures. As shown by Landau, the
incompatibility between energy- and momentum-conservation, which ultimately
stems from the spectrum of the elementary excitations of the superfluid,
forbids quantum-scattering between the superfluid and the moving mesoscopic
particle, below a critical speed-threshold. Here we predict that
frictionless-motion can also occur in the absence of a standard superfluid,
i.e. when a He atom travels through a narrow (5,5) carbon-nanotube (CNT). Due
to the quasi-linear dispersion of the plasmon and phonon modes that could
interact with He, the (5,5) CNT embodies a solid-state analog of the
superfluid, thereby enabling straightforward transfer of Landau's criterion of
superfluidity. As a result, Landau's equations acquire broader generality, and
may be applicable to other nanoscale friction phenomena, whose description has
been so far purely classical.

Quantum annealers are commercial devices aiming to solve very hard
computational problems named spin glasses. Just like in metallurgic annealing
one slowly cools a ferrous metal, quantum annealers seek good solutions by
slowly removing the transverse magnetic field at the lowest possible
temperature. The field removal diminishes quantum fluctuations but forces the
system to traverse the critical point that separates the disordered phase (at
large fields) from the spin-glass phase (at small fields). A full understanding
of this phase transition is still missing. A debated, crucial question regards
the closing of the energy gap separating the ground state from the first
excited state. All hopes of achieving an exponential speed-up, as compared to
classical computers, rest on the assumption that the gap will close
algebraically with the number of qspins, but renormalization group calculations
predict that the closing will be instead exponential. Here we solve this debate
through extreme-scale numerical simulations, finding that both parties grasped
parts of the truth. While the closing of the gap at the critical point is
indeed super-algebraic, it remains algebraic if one restricts the symmetry of
possible excitations. Since this symmetry restriction is experimentally
achievable (at least nominally), there is still hope for the Quantum Annealing
paradigm.

<h3>Entanglement asymmetry and quantum Mpemba effect in the XY spin chain</h3>

Entanglement asymmetry is a quantity recently introduced to measure how much
a symmetry is broken in a part of an extended quantum system. It has been
employed to analyze the non-equilibrium dynamics of a broken symmetry after a
global quantum quench with a Hamiltonian that preserves it. In this work, we
carry out a comprehensive analysis of the entanglement asymmetry at equilibrium
taking the ground state of the XY spin chain, which breaks the $U(1)$ particle
number symmetry, and provide a physical interpretation of it in terms of
superconducting Cooper pairs. We also consider quenches from this ground state
to the XX spin chain, which preserves the broken $U(1)$ symmetry. In this case,
the entanglement asymmetry reveals that the more the symmetry is initially
broken, the faster it may be restored in a subsystem, a surprising and
counter-intuitive phenomenon that is a type of a quantum Mpemba effect. We
obtain a quasi-particle picture for the entanglement asymmetry in terms of
Cooper pairs, from which we derive the microscopic conditions to observe the
quantum Mpemba effect in this system, giving further support to the criteria
recently proposed for arbitrary integrable quantum systems. In addition, we
find that the power law governing symmetry restoration depends discontinuously
on whether the initial state is critical or not, leading to new forms of strong
and weak Mpemba effects.

In this article, we systematically explore several key properties of
electronic states in helical materials systems, including the inheritance of
orbital angular momentum (OAM) from local atomic orbitals to the entire helical
structure, the conservation of helical momentum, and the emergence of
helical-induced spin-orbit coupling (hSOC). We then apply this comprehensive
theoretical framework to elucidate the electronic structure of one-dimensional
(1D) helical crystal InSeI. Our analysis reveals the influence of hSOC, evident
in spin-mixing energy gaps within the electronic band structure, as calculated
through density functional theory. Utilizing a combination of tight-binding
modeling and first-principles calculations, we ascertain the spin-polarized
electric response and the chiral-switchable second-order photocurrent response
of InSeI, characterized as the Landauer-Buttiker ballistic transport and shift
current response. The results highlight the potential of 1D InSeI for
applications in spintronics and optoelectronics. The overarching theoretical
framework established in this work will prove invaluable for the investigation
of other helical electronic systems.

We study wetting droplets formed of active Brownian particles in contact with
a repulsive potential barrier, in a wedge geometry. Our numerical results
demonstrate a transition between partially wet and completely wet states, as a
function of the barrier height, analogous to the corresponding surface phase
transition in passive fluids. We analyse partially wet configurations
characterised by a nonzero contact angle $\theta$ between the droplet surface
and the barrier, including the average density profile and its fluctuations.
These findings are compared with two equilibrium systems: a Lennard-Jones fluid
and a simple contour model for a liquid-vapour interface. We locate the wetting
transition where $\cos(\theta)=1$, and the neutral state where
$\cos(\theta)=0$. We discuss the implications of these results for possible
definitions of surface tensions in active fluids.

Metals can undergo geometric quantum phase transitions where the local
curvature of the Fermi surface changes sign without a change in symmetry or
topology. At the inflection points on the Fermi surface, the local curvature
vanishes, leading to an anomalous dynamics of quasiparticles. In this paper, we
study geometric quantum critical metals that support inflection points in two
dimensions, and show that the decay rate of quasiparticles goes as $E^{\alpha}$
with $1<\alpha<2$ as a function of quasiparticle energy $E$ at the inflection
points.

However, boiling can spontaneously occur on a heating surface in He II when the
heat flux exceeds a threshold value $q^*$, referred to as the peak heat flux.
While the parameter $q^*$ holds paramount importance in the design of He II
based cooling systems, extensive research has primarily focused on its behavior
in steady homogeneous heat transfer from a flat heating surface. For
inhomogeneous heat transfer from curved surfaces, $q^*$ exhibits intricate
dependance on parameters such as the He II bath temperature $T_b$, the
immersion depth $h$, and the curvature radius $R_0$ of the heating surface. A
comprehensive understanding on how $q^*$ depends on these parameters remains
elusive. In this paper, we report our systematic study on $q^*$ for steady heat
transfer from cylindrical and spherical heaters in He II. We compute $q^*$ for
a wide range of parameter combinations $(T_b, h, R_0)$ by solving the He II
two-fluid equations of motion. The generated data have allowed us to develop a
robust correlation that accurately reproduces $q^*$ for all the parameter
combinations we explored. Our findings, particularly the establishment of the
correlation, carry valuable implications for emergent applications that involve
steady inhomogeneous heat transfer in He II systems.

Entropy estimation is a fundamental problem in information theory that has
applications in various fields, including physics, biology, and computer
science. Estimating the entropy of discrete sequences can be challenging due to
limited data and the lack of unbiased estimators. Most existing entropy
estimators are designed for sequences of independent events and their
performance vary depending on the system being studied and the available data
size. In this work we compare different entropy estimators and their
performance when applied to Markovian sequences. Specifically, we analyze both
binary Markovian sequences and Markovian systems in the undersampled regime. We
calculate the bias, standard deviation and mean squared error for some of the
most widely employed estimators. We discuss the limitations of entropy
estimation as a function of the transition probabilities of the Markov
processes and the sample size. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive
comparison of entropy estimators and their performance in estimating entropy
for systems with memory, which can be useful for researchers and practitioners
in various fields.

<h3>Feasible route to high-temperature ambient-pressure hydride  superconductivity</h3>

A key challenge in materials discovery is to find a viable high temperature
superconductor. Hydrogen and hydride materials have long been considered
promising materials displaying conventional phonon-mediated superconductivity.
However, the high pressures required to stabilise these materials have
restricted their application. Here, we present results from high-throughput
computation, considering a wide range of high-symmetry ternary hydrides from
across the periodic table at ambient-pressure. This large composition space is
then reduced by considerations of thermodynamic, dynamic and magnetic
stability, before direct estimations of the superconducting critical
temperature. This approach, combined with first-principles structure prediction
has revealed a metastable ambient-pressure hydride superconductor,
Mg$_2$IrH$_6$, with a predicted critical temperature of 160K, comparable to the
highest temperature superconducting cuprates. We propose a synthesis route via
a structurally related insulator, Mg$_2$IrH$_7$, which is thermodynamically
stable above 15GPa and discuss the potential challenges in doing so. This
supports a long-held hypothesis that, hydrogen, in the right chemical
environment, can promote high-temperature superconductivity at ambient
pressure.

Although coveted in applications, few materials expand when subject to
compression or contract under decompression, i.e., exhibit negative
compressibility transition. A key step to achieve such counterintuitive
behaviour is the destabilizations of (meta)stable equilibria of the
constituents. Here, we propose a simple strategy to obtain negative
compressibility exploiting capillary forces both to precompress the elastic
material and to release such precompression by a threshold phenomenon -- the
reversible intrusion of a liquid into a lyophobic flexible cavity. The
metastable elastocapillary system we designed according to these principles
achieved the largest mechanical negative compressibility ever reported.
Experiments demonstrate that the concept is effective all the way from
hydrophobic subnanometre porous materials to millimetre-sized metamaterials and
is relevant for diverse fields, including materials science and biology,
providing a simple, cross-scale, and flexible platform to endow materials with
negative compressibility for technological and biomedical applications.

<br>
In this study, novel achiral mesogens containing 4,4'-biphenyl central core
connected on both sides through an ester function to
1-(4-(alkyloxy)phenyl)-1H-[1,2,3]-triazolyl group have been synthesized and
characterized. Different mesophases have been identified, with the appearance
of both a periodic striped pattern and propeller-patterned droplets close to
the transition between the nematic and the smectic-C phases. This periodic
texture has been found to be independent of the geometry of the sample cell.
These observations suggest a spontaneous symmetry breaking which can result
either from an intrinsic enantioselective self-sorting process with a chirality
synchronization mechanism, or from an extrinsic surface mechanism at the
interface between the two phases.

<h3>Viscoelastic increase of detachment stress of a rigid punch from  adhesive soft viscoelastic layers</h3>

<br>
<br>
The problem of the detachment of a sufficiently large flat indenter from a
plane adhesive viscoelastic strip of thickness "b" is studied. For any given
retraction speed, three different detachment regimes are found: (i) for very
small "b" the detachment stress is constant and equal to the theoretical
strength of the interface, (ii) for intermediate values of "b" the detachment
stress decays approximately as b^(-1/2), (iii) for thick layers a constant
detachment stress is obtained corresponding to case the punch is detaching from
a halfplane. By using the boundary element method a comprehensive numerical
study is performed which assumes a linear viscoelastic material with a single
relaxation time and a Lennard-Jones force-separation law. Pull-off stress is
found to consistently and monotonically increase with unloading rate, but to be
almost insensitive to the history of the contact. Due to viscoelasticity,
unloading at high enough retraction velocity may allow punches of macroscopic
size to reach the theoretical strength of the interface. Finally, a corrective
term in Greenwood or Persson theories considering finite size effects is
proposed. Theoretical and numerical results are found in very good agreement.

<h3>Many-body entanglement and spectral clusters in the extended hard-core  bosonic Hatano-Nelson model</h3>

<i>Chao-Ze Lu, Gaoyong Sun</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the many-body entanglement and spectra of the extended bosonic
Hatano-Nelson model in the hard-core limit. We first show the quantum
entanglement entropy can describe phase transitions for both the ground state
and the first excited state. The phase transition of the ground state is
second-order with the central charge $c=1$. While the phase transition of the
first excited state is the first-order $\mathcal{PT}$ transition associated
with a sudden change of the entanglement entropy. Secondly, we show that all
energy spectral clusters would form ellipses in strong nearest-neighbor
interactions, for which we establish a universal scaling law. The lengths of
the major and minor axes are shown to obey power laws with respect to the
nearest-neighbor interaction. Finally, we derive exact expressions for the
numbers of energy levels on the outermost elliptic ring of each clusters.

<h3>Surface segregation in high-entropy alloys from alchemical machine  learning</h3>

High-entropy alloys (HEAs), containing several metallic elements in
near-equimolar proportions, have long been of interest for their unique bulk
properties. More recently, they have emerged as a promising platform for the
development of novel heterogeneous catalysts, because of the large design
space, and the synergistic effects between their components. In this work we
use a machine-learning potential that can model simultaneously up to 25
transition metals to study the tendency of different elements to segregate at
the surface of a HEA. We show that, thanks to the physically-inspired
functional form of the model, a small amount of data is sufficient to extend a
potential that was previously developed using exclusively crystalline bulk
phases, so that it can also accurately model defective configurations and
surfaces. We then present several computational studies of surface segregation,
including both a simulation of a 25-element alloy, that provides a rough
estimate of the relative surface propensity of the various elements, and
targeted studies of CoCrFeMnNi and IrFeCoNiCu, which provide further validation
of the model, and insights to guide the modeling and design of alloys for
heterogeneous catalysis.

<h3>Latent Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models</h3>

The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain is the reference model of a
one-dimensional topological insulator. Its topological nature can be explained
by the quantization of the Zak phase, due to reflection symmetry of the unit
cell, or of the winding number, due to chiral symmetry. Here, we harness recent
graph-theoretical results to construct families of setups whose unit cell
features neither of these symmetries, but instead a so-called latent or hidden
reflection symmetry. This causes the isospectral reduction -- akin to an
effective Hamiltonian -- of the resulting lattice to have the form of an SSH
model. As we show, these latent SSH models exhibit features such as multiple
topological transitions and edge states, as well as a quantized Zak phase.
Relying on a generally applicable discrete framework, we experimentally
validate our findings using electric circuits.

<h3>Fountains of Flat Bands through Moiré Engineering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07647" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07647</a>
<br>

Moir\'e Engineering offers an exceptional foundation for creating
controllable systems that display strongly correlated physics. The central
focus is on isolated flat bands near the Fermi level, stemming from the
pseudo-Landau levels of the massless or massive Dirac fermions. Unlike spin-1/2
fermions, both the Lieb and Dice lattices host triply degenerate spin-1
fermions as the low-energy effective quasi-particles. In this letter, we
propose Moir\'e structures, respectively, of the twisted bilayer Lieb and Dice
lattices, which exhibit tunable numbers of isolated flat bands near the Fermi
level. The quantity of isolated flat bands directly relates to the size of the
Moir\'e supercell, for they originate from the flat bands of the bipartite Lieb
or Dice lattice. These flat bands remain isolated from the high-energy bands
even with small higher-order term and chiral-symmetry breaking interlayer
tunneling considered. At a small twist angle, thousands of isolated flat bands
can be generated by the Moir\'e pattern, which significantly amplifies the flat
band physics. The dramatic change in the number of flat bands in the Moir\'e
Brillouin zone as the twist angle varies gives rise to a new platform to
effectively manipulate the strongly correlated physics. Moreover, via the
investigation of the systems, we have demonstrated that these isolated flat
bands exhibit considerable quantum weight, indicating a notable superfluid
weight upon adding BCS-type pairing potential. Further, the density-of-state
around the Fermi level as a function of the twisted angle contributed by these
flat bands implies a tunable critical temperature for BCS superconductivity.
Most importantly, through twisted bilayer Lieb lattice and twisted Dice
lattice, we demonstrate that the Moir\'e engineering of bipartite lattices
creates a brand new path toward the engineering of the flat-band generation.

<h3>Thermal rectification in mass-asymmetric one-dimensional anharmonic  oscillator lattices with and without a ballistic spacer</h3>

<br>
<i>M Romero-Bastida, Brandon Armando Martínez-Torres</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work we perform a systematic analysis of various structural
parameters that have influence on the thermal rectification effect, i.e.
asymmetrical heat flow, and the negative differential thermal resistance --
reduction of the heat flux as the applied thermal bias is increased -- present
in a one-dimensional, segmented mass-graded system consisting of a coupled
nearest-neighbor harmonic oscillator lattice (ballistic spacer) and two
diffusive leads (modeled by a substrate potential) attached to the lattice at
both boundaries. At variance with previous works, we consider the size of the
spacer as smaller than that of the leads. Also considered is the case where the
leads are connected along the whole length of the oscillator lattice; that is,
in the absence of the ballistic spacer. Upon variation of the system's
parameters it was determined that the performance of the device, as quantified
by the spectral properties, is largely enhanced in the absence of the ballistic
spacer for the small system-size limit herein considered.

<h3>Biased dynamics of the miscible-immiscible quantum phase transition in a  binary Bose-Einstein condensate</h3>

A quantum phase transition from the miscible to the immiscible phase of a
quasi-1D binary Bose-Einstein condensate is driven by ramping down the coupling
amplitude of its two hyperfine states. It results in a random pattern of
spatial domains where the symmetry is broken separated by defects. In
distinction to previous studies [J. Sabbatini et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 107,
230402 (2011), New J. Phys. 14 095030], we include non-zero detuning between
the light field and the energy difference of the states which provides a bias
towards one of the states. Using the truncated Wigner method, we test the
biased version of the quantum Kibble-Zurek mechanism [M. Rams et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. 123, 130603 (2019)] and observe a crossover to the adiabatic regime
when the quench is sufficiently fast to dominate the effect of the bias. We
verify a universal power law for the population imbalance in the non-adiabatic
regime both at the critical point and by the end of the ramp. Shrinking and
annihilation of domains of the unfavourable phase after the ramp -- that is,
already in the broken symmetry phase -- enlarges the defect-free sections by
the end of the ramp. The consequences of this phase ordering effect can be
captured by a phenomenological power law.

<h3>Planar thermal Hall effect in cuprates: electrons and phonons</h3>

<br>
<br>
A surprising "planar" thermal Hall effect, whereby the field is parallel to
the current, has recently been observed in a few magnetic insulators, and this
has been attributed to exotic excitations such as Majorana fermions or chiral
magnons. Here we investigate the possibility of a planar thermal Hall effect in
three different cuprate materials, in which the conventional thermal Hall
conductivity $\kappa_{\rm {xy}}$ (with an out-of-plane field perpendicular to
the current) is dominated by either electrons or phonons. Our measurements show
that the planar $\kappa_{\rm {xy}}$ from electrons in cuprates is zero, as
expected from the absence of a Lorentz force in the planar configuration. By
contrast, we observe a sizable planar $\kappa_{\rm {xy}}$ in those samples
where the thermal Hall response is due to phonons, even though it should in
principle be forbidden by the high crystal symmetry. Our findings call for a
careful re-examination of the mechanisms responsible for the phonon thermal
Hall effect in insulators.

<h3>Interplay between electron correlations, magnetic state, and structural  confinement in LaNiO3 ultrathin films</h3>

We report a theoretical study of the effects of electron correlations and
structural confinement on the electronic properties and magnetic state of
LaNiO3 (LNO) thin films epitaxially deposited on the (001) LaAlO3 (LAO)
substrate. Using the DFT+U method we compute the electronic band structure,
magnetic properties, and phase stability of the 1.5 unit-cell-thick
NiO2-terminated LNO thin films. Our results reveal complex diversity of the
electronic states caused by the effects of structural confinement, interfacial
charge transfer and electronic correlations. Our calculations suggest the
appearance of in-plane (110) charge disproportionation of the Ni ions in the
interface NiO2 layer of the antiferromagnetically ordered LNO thin films.
Moreover, the electronic states of both the AFM and FM LNO/LAO show a large
orbital polarization of the Ni ions in the surface NiO2 layers. We propose the
crucial importance of oxygen defects to explain the metal-to-insulator phase
transition experimentally observed in a few-unit-cell-thick LNO/LAO thin films.
