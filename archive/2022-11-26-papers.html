<h3>Entanglement and Absorbing-State Transitions in Interactive Quantum  Dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12526" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12526</a>

Monitored quantum system with measurements can undergo dynamical phase
transitions in the entanglement properties of quantum trajectories conditional
on measurement outcomes. These entanglement transitions are challenging to see
in experiment, as they are invisible to traditional observables like
expectation values (without exponential post-selection overhead). We explore a
modified class of dynamics in which one attempts to (locally) use measurement
outcomes to apply corrective unitaries to steer the system toward a target
state, and study the resulting phase diagram as a function of the measurement
and feedback rates. Steering succeeds when the measurement and feedback rates
exceed a threshold, yielding an observable absorbing-state transition in the
trajectory-averaged density matrix. We argue that the absorbing-state
transition generally occurs at different critical parameters from the
entanglement transition in individual trajectories, and has distinct critical
properties. We study a paradigmatic model targeting a simple product polarized
state. In this model, while the entanglement and absorbing-state transitions
numerically occur at indistinguishable measurement rates (for strong feedback),
we find that the absorbing-state transition is nevertheless in a distinct
directed-percolation universality class -- results we expect to hold generally
in local models targeting short-range correlated states in the absence of
additional symmetries. We also study steering to an entangled cluster state
with SPT order. With parity-symmetry-respecting dynamics, defects can only be
corrected in pairs which requires non-local classical communication. This
limits the efficacy of local feedback and yields widely separated entanglement
and absorbing-state transitions, with the latter now belonging to the
parity-conserving universality class.

<h3>Mechanical Theory of Nonequilibrium Coexistence and Motility-Induced  Phase Separation</h3>

Nonequilibrium phase transitions are routinely observed in both natural and
synthetic systems. The ubiquity of these transitions highlights the conspicuous
absence of a general theory of phase coexistence that is broadly applicable to
both nonequilibrium and equilibrium systems. Here, we present a general
mechanical theory for phase separation rooted in ideas explored nearly a
half-century ago in the study of inhomogeneous fluids. The core idea is that
the mechanical forces within the interface separating two coexisting phases
uniquely determine coexistence criteria, regardless of whether a system is in
equilibrium or not. We demonstrate the power and utility of this theory by
applying it to active Brownian particles, predicting a quantitative phase
diagram for motility-induced phase separation in both two and three dimensions.
This formulation additionally allows for the prediction of novel interfacial
phenomena, such as an increasing interface width while moving deeper into the
two-phase region, a uniquely nonequilibrium effect confirmed by computer
simulations. The self-consistent determination of bulk phase behavior and
interfacial phenomena offered by this mechanical perspective provide a concrete
path forward towards a general theory for nonequilibrium phase transitions.

<h3>Temporal sequence of deformation twinning in CoCrNi under tribological  load</h3>

<br>
<br>
Microstructural evolution under tribological load is known to change the
friction and wear response of the entire tribological system. It is however not
yet fully understood, how these changes take place on an elementary,
mechanistic level. Revealing the temporal sequence of deformation mechanisms
under a tribological load by experiments is scarce. The discrete strain release
in the case of deformation twinning allows the identification of their temporal
sequence. Therefore, a medium stacking fault energy material, namely CoCrNi,
was investigated due to the significant contribution of deformation twinning to
the overall deformation at room temperature. The investigated grain showed
three activated twin systems. The evolution sequence of these is discussed
critically based on several twin intersection mechanisms. The experimental
analysis decodes the temporal sequence of the active twinning systems of
highest resolved shear stresses for the first time. This approach gives
experimental indications for the stress field under a tribological load.

<h3>Multi-terminal Josephson junctions: a road to topological flux networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12524" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12524</a>

<i>Lucila Peralta Gavensky, Gonzalo Usaj, C. A. Balseiro</i>
<br>
<br>
Multi-terminal Josephson junctions were recently proposed as a versatile and
tunable platform to emulate topological Bloch-like Hamiltonians in arbitrary
dimensions. In this perspective article, we will give a brief overview of the
subject and recognize these mesoscopic devices as realizations of topological
flux networks as the ones envisioned by J. E. Avron and coworkers in their
seminal works on the early days of the quantum Hall effect. We summarize the
current state-of-the-art theoretical and experimental research regarding these
Josephson devices, highlighting recent developments and giving an outlook on
current trends.

<h3>Relating non-Hermitian and Hermitian quantum systems at criticality</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12525" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12525</a>
<br>
<i>Chang-Tse Hsieh, Po-Yao Chang</i>
<br>
<br>
We demonstrate three types of transformations that relate Hermitian and
non-Hermitian quantum systems at criticality which can be described by
conformal field theories (CFTs). For the transformation preserving both the
physical spectrum (PS) and the entanglement spectrum (ES), the corresponding
central charges extracted from the logarithmic scaling of the entanglement
entropy are identical for both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems. The second
transformation preserves the PS but not the ES. The entanglement entropy
scalings are different and lead to different central charges. We demonstrate
this transformation by the dilation method for the free fermion cases, where
the non-Hermitian system with central charge $c=-2$ can be mapped to the
Hermitian system with $c=1$. Lastly, we study the Galois conjugation in the
Fibonacci model with parameter $\phi \to -1/\phi$, in which the transformation
does not preserve both PS and ES. We demonstrate the Fibonacci model and its
Galois conjugation relate the tricritical Ising model/3-state Potts model and
the Lee-Yang model with negative central charges from the scaling property of
the entanglement entropy.

<h3>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis, Luttinger, and 't Hooft -- anomaly matching in  lattice systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12543" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12543</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We analyze lattice Hamiltonian systems whose global symmetries have 't Hooft
anomalies. As is common in the study of anomalies, they are probed by coupling
the system to classical background gauge fields. For flat fields (vanishing
field strength), the nonzero spatial components of the gauge fields can be
thought of as twisted boundary conditions, or equivalently, as topological
defects. The symmetries of the twisted Hilbert space and their representations
capture the anomalies. We demonstrate this approach with a number of examples.
In some of them, the anomalous symmetries are internal symmetries of the
lattice system, but they do not act on-site. (We clarify the notion of "on-site
action.") In other cases, the anomalous symmetries involve lattice
translations. Using this approach we frame many known and new results in a
unified fashion. In this work, we limit ourselves to 1+1d systems with a
spatial lattice. In particular, we present a lattice system that flows to the
$c=1$ compact boson system with any radius (no BKT transition) with the full
internal symmetry of the continuum theory, with its anomalies and its
T-duality. As another application, we analyze various spin chain models and
phrase their Lieb-Shultz-Mattis theorem as an 't Hooft anomaly matching
condition. We also show in what sense filling constraints like Luttinger
theorem can and cannot be viewed as reflecting an anomaly. As a by-product, our
understanding allows us to use information from the continuum theory to derive
some exact results in lattice model of interest, such as the lattice momenta of
the low-energy states.

<h3>Superfluid transition of the second layer of He-4 on graphite: does  substrate corrugation matter?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12554" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12554</a>
<br>
<i>Massimo Boninsegni, Saverio Moroni</i>
<br>
<br>
The second layer of He-4 adsorbed on a graphite substrate is studied by
Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We make use of a microscopic model of the
substrate fully accounting for its corrugation, and compare the results to
those obtained with a smooth substrate. The only effect of corrugation is a
~20% reduction of the value of the superfluid fraction of the top layer, in the
limit of zero temperature. No evidence of any commensurate (7/12) crystalline
and/or "supersolid" phase is found; the superfluid transition temperature is
estimated to be ~ 0.75 K. We discuss the implication of these findings on the
interpretation of recent experiments.

<h3>Application of Convolutional Neural Network to TSOM Images for  Classification of 6 nm Node Patterned Defects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12596" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12596</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
With the rapid growth in the semiconductor industry, it is becoming critical
to detect and classify increasingly smaller patterned defects. Recently machine
learning, including deep learning, has come to aid in this endeavor in a big
way. However, the literature shows that it is challenging to successfully
classify defect types at the 6 nm node with 100% accuracy using low-cost and
high-volume-manufacturing compatible optical imaging methods. Here we combine a
convolutional neural network (CNN) with that of an optical imaging method
called through-focus scanning optical microscopy (TSOM) to successfully
classify patterned defects for the 6 nm node targets using simulated optical
images at the 193 nm illumination wavelength. We demonstrate the successful
classification of eight variations of the defects, including the 3 nm
difference in the defect size in one dimension, which is over 50 times smaller
than the illumination wavelength used.

<h3>Persistent spin textures in halide perovskites induced by uniaxial  stress</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12605" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12605</a>
<br>
<i>Ravi Kashikar, Abduljelili Popoola, Sergey Lisenkov, A. Stroppa, I. Ponomareva</i>
<br>
<br>
Persistent spin textures are highly desirable for applications in spintronics
as they may allow for long carrier spin lifetimes. However, they are also rare
as only four point groups can host such textures, and even for these four
groups, the emergence of persistent spin textures requires a delicate balance
between coupling parameters, which control the strength of spin-momentum
interactions. We use first-principles density functional simulations to predict
the possibility of achieving these desirable spin textures through the
application of uniaxial stress. Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite MPSnBr$_3$
(MP = CH$_3$PH$_3$) is a ferroelectric semiconductor which exhibits persistent
spin textures in the near to its conduction band minimum and mostly Rashba type
in the vicinity of its valence band maximum. Application of uniaxial stress
leads to the gradual evolution of the valence bands spin textures from mostly
Rashba type to persistent ones under tensile load and to pure Rashba or
persistent ones under compressive load. We also report that the material
exhibits flexibility, rubber-like response, and both positive and negative
piezoelectric constants. Combination of such properties may create
opportunities for a flexible/rubbery spintronic devices.

<h3>Structural Evolution and Onset of the Density Wave Transition in the CDW  Superconductor LaPt$_2$Si$_2$ Clarified with Synchrotron XRD</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12617" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12617</a>

<br>
<br>
The quasi-2D Pt-based rare earth intermetallic material LaPt$_2$Si$_2$ has
attracted attention as it exhibits strong interplay between charge density wave
(CDW) and and superconductivity (SC). However, the most of the results reported
on this material come from theoretical calculations, preliminary bulk
investigations and powder samples, which makes it difficult to uniquely
determine the temperature evolution of its crystal structure and, consequently,
of its CDW transition. Therefore, the published literature around
LaPt$_2$Si$_2$ is often controversial. In this paper, we clarify the complex
evolution of the crystal structure, and the temperature dependence of the
development of density wave transitions, in good quality LaPt$_2$Si$_2$ single
crystals, with high resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction data. According to
our findings, on cooling from room temperature LaPt$_2$Si$_2$ undergoes a
series of subtle structural transitions which can be summarised as follows:
second order commensurate tetragonal ($P4/nmm$)-to-incommensurate structure
followed by a first order incommensurate-to-commensurate orthorhombic ($Pmmn$)
transition and then a first order commensurate orthorhombic
($Pmmn$)-to-commensurate tetragonal ($P4/nmm$). The structural transitions are
accompanied by both incommensurate and commensurate superstructural distortions
of the lattice. The observed behavior is compatible with discommensuration of
the CDW in this material.

<h3>Effect of topology on the collapse transition and the instantaneous  shape of a model heteropolymer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12665" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12665</a>
<br>
<i>Thoudam Vilip Singh, Lenin S. Shagolsem</i>
<br>
<br>
The effect of topology on the collapse transition and instantaneous shape of
an energy polydisperse polymer (a model heteropolymer) is studied by means of
computer simulations. In particular, we consider three different chain
topology, namely, linear (L), ring (R) and trefoil knot (T). The heteropolymer
is modeled by assigning each monomer an interaction parameter, $\varepsilon_i$,
drawn randomly from a Gaussian distribution. Through chain size scaling the
transition temperature, $\theta$, is located and compared among the chains of
different topogies. The influence of topology is reflected in the value of
$\theta$ and observed that $\theta(\text{L}) > \theta(\text{R}) >
\theta(\text{T})$ in a similar fashion to that of the homopolymer counterpart.
Also studied chain size distributions, and the shape changes across the
transition temperature characterised through shape parameters based on the
eigenvalues of the gyration tensor. It is observed that, for the model
heteropolymer, in addition to chain topology the $\theta$-temperature also
depends on energy polydispersity.

<h3>Classical analogue to the Kitaev model and Majorana-like topological  bound states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12690" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12690</a>
<br>
<i>Ting-Wei Liu, Fabio Semperlotti</i>
<br>
<br>
This study explores the possibility and presents a methodology to synthesize
a classical mechanical analogue to the quantum mechanical 1D Kitaev model.
While being fundamentally different, we will identify significant conceptual
similarities between the two models that culminate in the occurrence, in the
classical analogue system, of topologically non-trivial bound states that are
akin to Majorana zero modes. By reformulating the Hamiltonian of the classical
system in a form reminiscent of second quantization, we show that a 1D
staggered classical mechanical chain can exhibit dynamic characteristics
analogous to the Kitaev's 1D superconducting model as well as its
characteristic bound states. The non-trivial topological nature of the bound
states is further confirmed by the topological band structure analysis that
allows the computation of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant. While the non-Abelian
nature of these states remains an open question, these results allow
envisioning the possibility to achieve topological braiding in classical
mechanical systems.

<h3>Higher order exchange driven noncoplanar magnetic state and large  anomalous Hall effects in electron doped kagome magnet Mn$_3$Sn</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12722" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12722</a>
<br>
<i>Charanpreet Singh, Sk Jamaluddin, Ashis K. Nandy, Masashi Tokunaga, Maxim Avdeev, Ajaya K. Nayak</i>
<br>
<br>
Owing to the geometrical frustration, Mn$_3 $Sn exhibits a 120$^{\circ}$
in-plane triangular antiferromagnetic (AFM) order with a large anomalous Hall
effect (AHE). Here, we present a combined theoretical and experimental study to
demonstrate that the in-plane AFM structure in Mn$_3 $Sn can be significantly
modified to a tunable noncoplanar magnetic state by suitable electron doping.
With the help of Density Functional Theory calculations we show that the
presence of higher-order exchange interactions in the system leads to the
stabilization of the noncoplanar magnetic ground state, which is further
established by neutron diffraction study in the Fe-doped Mn$_3 $Sn sample.
Interestingly, we find a large scalar spin chirality (SSC) induced topological
AHE that can be significantly tuned with the degree of non-coplanarity. We
carry out 60~T magnetic and Hall resistivity measurements to demonstrate the
contribution of SSC to the observed AHE. We also illustrate a simultaneous
manipulation of dual order in the system, where the AHE arising from the
in-plane 120$^{\circ}$ triangular AFM order can switch its sign without
affecting the AHE generated by the SSC. The present study opens up a new
direction to explore novel quantum phenomena associated with the coexistence of
multiple orders.

<h3>Hysteretic wavelength selection in isometric, unsupported radial  wrinkling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12736" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12736</a>
<br>
<i>Anshuman S. Pal</i>
<br>
<br>
In [Pal et al., arXiv:2206.03552], the authors discuss how an unsupported
flat annulus contracted at its inner boundary by a factor $\Delta$, buckles
into a radial wrinkling pattern that is fully isometric and tension-free. What
selects the wavelength in such a pure-bending configuration, in the absence of
any competing sources of work? In this paper, with the support of numerical
simulations, we argue that competition between stretching and bending energies
at local, mesoscopic scales leads to the selection of a wavelength scale
$\lambda^*$ sensitive to both the width $w$ and thickness $t$ of the sheet:
$\lambda^* \sim w^{2/3} t^{1/3} \Delta^{-1/6}$. This scale $\lambda^*$
corresponds to an arrest criterion for wrinkle coarsening starting from any
wavelength $\lambda \lesssim \lambda^*$, which can be interpreted in terms of
both size and energetic barriers to further coarsening. However, the sheet can
support coarser wavelengths: $\lambda \gtrsim \lambda^*$, since there is no
penalty to their existence. Since this wavelength selection mechanism depends
on the value of $\lambda$ itself, it is hysteretic.

<h3>Configurational forces on elastic structures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12811" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12811</a>
<br>
<i>Davide Bigoni, Federico Bosi, Francesco Dal Corso, Diego Misseroni</i>
<br>
<br>
The discovery of configurational forces acting on elastic structures and its
initial applications are reviewed. Configurational forces are related to the
possibility that an elastic structure can change its configuration, thus
inducing a variation in the potential energy. This concept has already led to
several applications (the elastica arm scale, the dripping of an elastic rod,
and the torsional actuator), has been shown to strongly affect stability, and
to be related to limbless locomotion. It is believed that these results will
open a new research territory in mechanics.

<h3>Jamming and metastability in one dimension: from the kinetically  constrained Ising chain to the Riviera model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12815" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12815</a>
<br>
<i>P. L. Krapivsky, J. M. Luck</i>
<br>
<br>
The Ising chain with kinetic constraints provides many examples of totally
irreversible zero-temperature dynamics leading to metastability with an
exponentially large number of attractors. In most cases, the constrained
zero-temperature dynamics can be mapped onto a model of random sequential
adsorption. We provide a brief didactic review, based on the example of the
constrained Glauber-Ising chain, of the exact results on the dynamics of these
models and on their attractors that have been obtained by means of the above
mapping. The Riviera model introduced recently by Puljiz et al. behaves
similarly to the kinetically constrained Ising chains. This totally
irreversible deposition model however does not enjoy the shielding property
characterising models of random sequential adsorption. It can therefore neither
be mapped onto such a model nor (in all likelihood) be solved by analytical
means. We present a range of novel results on the attractors of the Riviera
model, obtained by means of an exhaustive enumeration for smaller systems and
of extensive simulations for larger ones, and put these results in perspective
with the exact ones which are available for kinetically constrained Ising
chains.

<h3>Geometry-enhanced graph neural network for glassy dynamics prediction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12832" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12832</a>
<br>
<i>Xiao Jiang, Zean Tian, Kenli Li</i>
<br>
<br>
Understanding the dynamic processes of the glassy system continues to be
challenging. Recent advances have shown the power of graph neural networks
(GNNs) for determining the correlation between structure and dynamics in the
glassy system. These methods treat the glassy system as a topological graph.
However, the inherent "smoothness" property of the dynamics on the graph
(variation of dynamics over the graph) is ignored, resulting in a deteriorated
performance of GNN for dynamic predictions over various time scales. In this
paper, we first present an experimental investigation assessing the smoothness
patterns of particle dynamics from the graph perspective. The results indicate
that the long-time dynamics exhibit a smoother property on the graph, while the
short-time dynamics reveal a distinctly non-smooth pattern. To establish the
relationship between the static structure and dynamics with different
smoothness patterns, we propose a novel geometry-enhanced graph neural network
(Geo-GNN) model. The Geo-GNN architecture consists of a geometry feature
encoder that incorporates rotation-invariant distances and angles to enhance
geometric feature learning and a geometry-enhanced aggregation block that can
adaptively learn the underlying smoothness patterns during message passing.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method is able to capture the
inherent smoothness pattern of particles and outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines in predicting the dynamics across all time scales. A subsequent study
has revealed that geometric features are critical for the model to accurately
capture smoothness patterns in dynamics. Our research not only refines the
method for predicting glassy dynamics but also provides a new lens through
which to investigate the issue of causality regarding dynamical heterogeneity
in glasses.

<h3>Magnetic-field driven delocalization of in-gap-state BdG quasiparticles  in a quasi-two-dimensional Fe-based superconductor</h3>

<br>
<br>
Role of order-parameter fluctuations in Anderson transition of quasiparticles
is a central question in revealing the microscopic mechanism of Anderson
localization in the presence of spontaneous symmetry breaking. However, even
correlations between the statistical information of such collective-mode
fluctuations and that of (single) quasiparticle excitations have not been
addressed well both experimentally and theoretically. Based on scanning
tunneling microscopic (STM) measurements, we investigate how Bogoliubov-de
Gennes (BdG) quasiparticles become Anderson-delocalized as a function of
applied magnetic fields in a quasi-two dimensional disordered Fe-based
superconductor. Two types of anomalous multifractal spectra from multiple
moments of both local pairing gaps and local coherent peaks suggest that
superconducting fluctuations play an essential role in delocalization of
in-gap-state BdG quasiparticles. All these experiments are explained by
real-space Hartree-Fock-BCS-Anderson simulations for superconductors under
external magnetic fields in addition to our renormalization group analysis with
superconducting random fluctuations. The present study not only proposes a
novel measure to investigate Anderson transition of quasiparticles with
symmetry breaking but also suggests a novel mechanism for delocalization of
quasiparticle excitations in quasi-two dimensions beyond previously discussed
well-known mechanisms.

<h3>Stability of vector model: four-loop $\varepsilon$ expansion study</h3>

The stability of $O(n)$-symmetric fixed point regarding the presence of
vector-field term ($\sim h p_{\alpha}p_{\beta}$) in the $\varphi^4$ field
theory is analyzed. For this purpose, the four-loop renormalization group
expansions in $d=4-2\varepsilon$ within Minimal Subtraction (MS) scheme are
obtained. This frequently neglected term in the action requires a detailed and
accurate study on the issue of existing of new fixed points and their
stability, that can lead to the possible change of the corresponding
universality class. We found that within lower order of perturbation theory the
only $O(n)$-symmetric fixed point $(g_{\text{H}},h=0)$ exists but the
corresponding positive value of stability exponent $\omega_h$ is tiny. This led
us to analyze this constant in higher orders of perturbation theory by
calculating the 4-loop contributions to the $\varepsilon$ expansion for
$\omega_h$, that should be enough to infer positivity or negativity of this
exponent. The value turned out to be undoubtedly positive, although still small
even in higher loops: $0.0156(3)$. These results cause that the corresponding
vector term should be neglected in the action when analyzing the critical
behaviour of $O(n)$-symmetric model. At the same time, the small value of the
$\omega_h$ shows that the corresponding corrections to the critical scaling are
significant in a wide range.

<h3>Twin boundary reversibility characteristics in α-Fe</h3>

Understanding the grain boundary deformation dynamics is very crucial to
designing materials with stable microstructures. With this quest, the
deformation behavior of coherent twin boundary under cyclic shear loading has
been studied in {\alpha}-Fe using molecular dynamics simulations to understand
the influence of strain amplitude and temperature. Twin boundary exhibited
shear coupled migration along with cyclic irreversibility character at lower
temperatures and gained almost perfect reversibility at higher temperatures of
around 1500 K. TB exhibited more sliding than migration with an increase in
temperature. The stress associated with the migration of twins was observed to
fluctuate around its average value. This was caused by layer by layer
propagation of twin boundary through the activity of 1/6 <111> = 1/12 <111> +
1/12 <111> type edge partial dislocations on "\{"112"\}" twin plane. Complete
twin reversibility and complex TB migration were noticed in the presence of

size nanowires with a proper combination of boundary conditions and strain
rates; otherwise, it was absent. The influence of shear strain amplitude in
offsetting the twin boundary was found to be minimal.

<h3>Itinerant Ferromagnetism in SU(N)-Symmetric Fermi Gases at Finite  Temperature: First Order Phase Transitions and Time-Reversal Symmetry</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12882" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12882</a>

<i>Chen-How Huang, Miguel A. Cazalilla</i>
<br>
<br>
At temperatures well below the Fermi temperature $T_F$ , the coupling of
magnetic fluctuations to soft particle-hole excitations in a two-component
Fermi gas makes the phase transition to itinerant ferromagnetism first order.
This effect is not described by the paradigm of Landau's theory of phase
transitions, which assumes the free energy is an analytic function of the order
parameter and predicts a second order phase transition. On the other hand,
despite that larger symmetry often introduces larger degeneracies in spectrum
of low-lying states, here we show that for a Fermi gas with SU($N >
2$)-symmetry the ferromangetic phase transition is first order in agreement
with the predictions of Landau's theory [M. A. Cazalilla \emph{et al}. New J.
of Phys. {\bf 11} 103033 (2009)]. By performing unrestricted Hartree-Fock
calculations for an SU($N > 2$)-symmetric Fermi gas with short range
interactions in three space dimensions, we find the order parameter undergoes a
finite jump across the transition. In addition, we find no evidence of a
tri-critical point up to temperatures $T \simeq 0.5\: T_F$, for which the
thermal smearing of the Fermi surface is substantial. Going beyond mean-field,
we find that the coupling of magnetic fluctuations to soft particle-hole
excitations makes the transition more abrupt and further enhances the tendency
of the gas to become fully polarized for smaller values of $N$ and the gas
parameter $k_F a_s$. In our study, we also clarify the role of time reversal
symmetry in the microscopic Hamiltonian and obtain the temperature dependence
of Tan's contact. For the latter, the presence of the tri-critical point for $N
= 2$ leads to a more pronounced temperature dependence around the transition
than for SU($N > 2$)-symmetric gases.

The dynamics of a magnetic moment or spin are of high interest to
applications in technology. Dissipation in these systems is therefore of
importance for improvement of efficiency of devices, such as the ones proposed
in spintronics. A large spin in a magnetic field is widely assumed to be
described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, which includes a
phenomenological Gilbert damping. Here, we couple a large spin to a bath and
derive a generic (non-)Ohmic damping term for the low-frequency range using a
Caldeira-Leggett model. This leads to a fractional LLG equation, where the
first-order derivative Gilbert damping is replaced by a fractional derivative
of order $s \ge 0$. We show that the parameter $s$ can be determined from a
ferromagnetic resonance experiment, where the resonance frequency and linewidth
no longer scale linearly with the effective field strength.

<h3>Uncovering Multiple Intrinsic Chiral Phases in (PEA)2PbI4 halide  Perovskites</h3>

Two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites offer a unique platform to
investigate the ground-state of materials possessing significant anharmonicity.
In contrast to three-dimensional perovskites, their 2D counterparts offer
substantially fewer degrees of freedom, resulting in multiple well-defined
crystal structures. In this work, we thoroughly investigate the anharmonic
ground-state of the benchmark (PEA)2PbI4 compound, using complementary
information from low-temperature x-ray diffraction (XRD) and photoluminescence
spectroscopy, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We
extrapolate four crystallographic configurations from the low-temperature XRD.
These configurations imply that the ground-state has an intrinsic disorder
stemming from two coexisting chiral sub-lattices, each with a bi-oriented
organic spacer molecule. We further show evidence that these chiral structures
form unevenly populated ground-states, portraying uneven anharmonicity, where
the state population may be tuned by surface effects. Our results uncover a
disordered ground-state that may induce intrinsic grain boundaries, which
cannot be ignored in practical applications.

<h3>An ultra-low field SQUID magnetometer for measuring antiferromagnetic  and weakly remanent magnetic materials at low temperatures</h3>

<br>
A novel setup for the measurement of magnetic fields external to certain
antiferromagnets and generally weakly remanent magnetic materials is presented.
The setup features a highly sensitive Super Conducting Quantum Interference
Device (SQUID) magnetometer with a magnetic field resolution of approx. 10 fT,
non-electric thermalization of the sample space for a temperature range of 1.5
- 65 K with a non-electric sample movement drive and optical position encoding.
To minimize magnetic susceptibility effects, the setup components are degaussed
and realized with plastic materials in sample proximity. Running the setup in
magnetically shielded rooms allows for a well-defined ultra low magnetic
background field well below 150 nT in situ. The setup enables studies of
inherently weak magnetic materials which cannot be measured with high field
susceptibility setups, optical methods or neutron scattering techniques, giving
new opportunities for the research on e.g. spin-spiral multiferroics, skyrmion
materials and spin ices.

<h3>Confinement-induced fractionation and liquid-liquid phase separation of  polymer mixtures</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The formation of (bio)molecular condensates via liquid-liquid phase
separation in cells has received increasing attention, as these coacervates
play important functional and regulatory roles within biological systems.
However, the majority of studies focused on the behavior of pure systems in
bulk solutions, thus neglecting confinement effects and the interplay between
the numerous molecules present in cells. To advance our knowledge, we perform
simulations of binary polymer mixtures in droplets, considering both
monodisperse and polydisperse molecular weight distributions for the longer
polymer species. We find that confinement induces a spatial separation of the
polymers by length, with the shorter ones moving to the droplet surface. This
partitioning causes a distinct increase of the local polymer concentration in
the droplet center, which is more pronounced in polydisperse systems.
Consequently, the systems exhibit liquid-liquid phase separation at average
polymer concentrations where bulk systems are still in the one-phase regime.

Magnetic excitations in layered magnetic materials that can be thinned down
the two-dimensional (2D) monolayer limit are of high interest from a
fundamental point of view and for applications perspectives. Raman scattering
has played a crucial role in exploring the properties of magnetic layered
materials and, even-though it is essentially a probe of lattice vibrations, it
can reflect magnetic ordering in solids through the spin-phonon interaction or
through the observation of magnon excitations. In bulk CrSBr, a layered A type
antiferromagnet (AF), we show that the magnetic ordering can be directly
observed in the temperature dependence of the Raman scattering response i)
through the variations of the scattered intensities, ii) through the activation
of new phonon lines reflecting the change of symmetry with the appearance of
the additional magnetic periodicity, and iii) through the observation, below
the Neel temperature (TN) of second order Raman scattering processes. We
additionally show that the three different magnetic phases encountered in
CrSBr, including the recently identified low temperature phase, have a
particular Raman scattering signature. This work demonstrates that magnetic
ordering can be observed directly in the Raman scattering response of bulk
CrSBr with in-plane magnetization, and that it can provide a unique insight
into the magnetic phases encountered in magnetic layered materials.

<h3>An entropic approach to analyze phase transitions in the q = 3 Potts  model</h3>

<br>
<br>
Boltzmann's microcanonical entropy is the link between statistical physics
and thermodynamics, forasmuch as the behavior of any thermodynamic quantity is
directly related to the number of microscopic configurations. Accordingly, in
this work, we investigate the behavior of the logarithm of the density of
states of the three-state Potts model with an external field applied to one of
the states using joint entropic simulations based on the Wang-Landau algorithm.
Our analysis reveals that the microcanonical entropy curve is detachable, and
each resulting path is related to the formation of clusters. Such a description
is consistent with the energy-entropy argument related to the inception of a
phase transition. When the external field is reversed and strong, the observed
phase transition is from an ordered configuration to cluster formations. The
behavior of the microcanonical inverse temperature indicates both first and
second-order phase transitions occurring at different temperatures for high
values of the external field.

<h3>Anatomy of spin wave driven magnetic texture motion via magnonic torques</h3>

<br>

The interplay between spin wave and magnetic texture represents the
information exchange between the fast and slow dynamical parts of magnetic
systems. Here we formulate a set of magnonic torques acting on background
magnetic texture, by extracting time-invariant information from the fast
precessing spin waves. Under the frame of magnonic torques, we use theoretical
formulations and micromagnetic simulations to investigate the spin wave driven
domain wall motion in two typical symmetry-breaking situations: the rotational
symmetry broken by the Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya interaction, and the translational
symmetry broken by magnetic damping. The torque-based microscopic analyses
provide compact yet quantitative tools to reinterpret the magnetic texture
dynamics induced by spin wave, beyond the conventional framework of global
momentum conservation.

<h3>Automatic, high-order, and adaptive algorithms for Brillouin zone  integration</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We present efficient methods for Brillouin zone integration with a non-zero
but possibly very small broadening factor $\eta$, focusing on cases in which
downfolded Hamiltonians can be evaluated efficiently using Wannier
interpolation. We describe robust, high-order accurate algorithms automating
convergence to a user-specified error tolerance $\varepsilon$, emphasizing an
efficient computational scaling with respect to $\eta$. After analyzing the
standard equispaced integration method, applicable in the case of large
broadening, we describe a simple iterated adaptive integration algorithm
effective in the small $\eta$ regime. Its computational cost scales as
$\mathcal{O}(\log^3(\eta^{-1}))$ as $\eta \to 0^+$ in three dimensions, as
opposed to $\mathcal{O}(\eta^{-3})$ for equispaced integration. We argue that,
by contrast, tree-based adaptive integration methods scale only as
$\mathcal{O}(\log(\eta^{-1})/\eta^{2})$ for typical Brillouin zone integrals.
In addition to its favorable scaling, the iterated adaptive algorithm is
straightforward to implement, particularly for integration on the irreducible
Brillouin zone, for which it avoids the tetrahedral meshes required for
tree-based schemes. We illustrate the algorithms by calculating the spectral
function of SrVO$_3$ with broadening on the meV scale.

<h3>Sensor sensitivity based on synthetic magnetism exceptional point</h3>

<br>
<br>
An efficient mass sensor based on exceptional points (EPs), engineered under
synthetic magnetism requirement, is proposed. The benchmark system consists of
an electromechanical (optomechanical) system where an electric (optical) field
is driving two mechanical resonators which are mechanically coupled through a
phase-dependent phonon-hopping. This phase induces series of EPs once it
matches the condition of $\frac{\pi}{2}(2n +1)$. For any perturbation of the
system, the phase-matched condition is no longer satisfied and this lifts the
EP-degeneracies leading to a frequency splitting that scales as the square root
of the perturbation strength, resulting in a giant sensitivity-factor
enhancement. Owing to the set of EPs, our proposal allows multiple sensing
scheme and performs better than its anti-PT-symmetric sensor counterpart. This
work sheds light on new platforms that can be used for mass sensing purposes,
opening up new opportunities in nanoparticles or pollutants detection, and to
water treatment.

<h3>Revealing the co-action of viscous and multistability hysteresis in an  adhesive, nominally flat punch: A combined numerical and experimental study</h3>

<br>
<i>Christian Müller, Manar Samri, René Hensel, Eduard Arzt, Martin H. Müser</i>
<br>
<br>
Viscoelasticity is well known to cause a significant hysteresis of crack
closure and opening when an elastomer is brought in and out of contact with a
flat, rigid counterface. In contrast, the idea that adhesive hysteresis can
also result under quasi-static driving due to small-scale, elastic
multistability is relatively new. Here, we study a system in which both
mechanisms act concurrently. Specifically, we compare the simulated and
experimentally measured time evolution of the interfacial force and the real
contact area between a soft elastomer and a rigid, flat punch, to which
small-scale, single-sinusoidal roughness is added. To this end, we further the
Green's function molecular dynamics method and extend recently developed
imaging techniques to elucidate the rate- and preload-dependence of the
pull-off process. Our results reveal that hysteresis is much enhanced when the
saddle points of the topography come into contact, which, however, is impeded
by viscoelastic forces and may require sufficiently large preloads. A similar
coaction of viscous- and multistability effects is expected to occur in
macroscopic polymer contacts and be relevant, e.g., for pressure-sensitive
adhesives and modern adhesive gripping devices.

<br>
<br>
The recently discovered chirality-induced spin selectivity has opened a new
strategy for enantioselective processes that exploits the interaction between
molecular handedness and electron spin. Despite successful experimental reports
of enantiospecific adsorption of chiral molecules on ferromagnetic substrates,
comprehensive and quantitative theoretical models are still lacking. This is
mainly due to the complex experimental conditions, which include adsorption
from solution, protective Au layers on the ferromagnetic surface to avoid
oxidation, and detection schemes that address ensembles of molecules. Here, we
report enantioselective adsorption of chiral molecules on uncoated
single-crystalline perpendicularly magnetized Co nanoislands by sublimation
under ultra-high vacuum. Detection of the handedness of each molecule and the
magnetization direction of the underlying island by spin-polarized scanning
tunneling microscopy provides unequivocal evidence for enantioselective
adsorption. Analysis of more than 740 molecules yields an enantiomeric
adsorption energy difference of (9 $\pm$ 2) meV. Due to the well-defined
experimental conditions, our results are readily accessible for theoretical
modeling.

<h3>Competing Lengthscales in Colloidal Gelation with Non-Sticky Particles</h3>

<br>
<i>Yujie Jiang, Ryohei Seto</i>
<br>
<br>
Colloidal gels are widely applied in industry due to their rheological
character -- no flow takes place below the yield stress. Such property enables
gels to maintain uniform distribution in practical formulations; otherwise,
solid components may quickly sediment without the support of gel matrix.
Compared with pure gels of sticky colloids, therefore, the composites of gel
and non-sticky inclusions are more commonly encountered in reality. Through
numerical simulations, we investigate the gelation process in such binary
composites. We find that the non-sticky particles not only confine gelation in
the form of an effective volume fraction, but also introduce another
lengthscale that competes with the size of growing clusters in gel. The ratio
of two key lengthscales in general controls the two effects. Using different
gel models, we verify such scenario within a wide range of parameter space,
suggesting a potential universality in all classes of colloidal composites.

Adiabatic transport in a many-electron system is expressed in terms of the
appropriate Berry curvature, owing to the Niu-Thouless theory [J. Phys A {\bf

address here three paradigmatic adiabatic response tensors -- -the atomic polar
tensor, the atomic axial tensor, and the rotational $g$ factor -- and I show
that, for all of them, the known formulas do not need an independent proof.
They are just case studies of the general expression, for different choices the

<br>
<br>
By means of single-crystal X-ray diffraction we have revealed the breaking of
centrosymmetry when lowering the temperature under T$_s$ = 200 K concomitantly
with the setting of a commensurate superstructure in the small A-site quadruple
perovskite YMn$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$. This results is in agreement with all data
already reported for this compounds and solve the previous inconsistency about
the Yttrium position. The superstructure is characterized by the appearing of
satellite reflections in the single crystal pattern, consistent with an
I-centered pseudo-orthorhombic commensurate supercell with $a \approx
\sqrt{a_F} = 10.4352(7)$ \AA, $b \approx 2b_F = 14.6049(9)$ \AA, $c \approx
\sqrt{c_F} = 10.6961(7)$ \AA and $\beta = 90.110(3)^\circ$, where F stands for
the "fundamental" high-temperature cell ($a_F \approx c_F \approx 7.45$ \AA,
$b_F \approx 7.34$ \AA, and $\beta \approx 90^\circ$). The space-group was
unequivocally found to be Ia, which is non polar, thus allowing for a non-zero
polarization in the material. We then have investigated in detail the
pyrocurrent, transport, dielectric and the DC and AC magnetic properties of
polycrystalline sample of YMn$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$ over a wide temperature range.
These measurements clearly highlight several critical temperatures in the
material and correlation between the different orders: i) the centrosymmetry is
broken at high temperature (T$_S$ = 200K), ii) then the long-range magnetic
order of B-sites occurs at T$_{N,B}$ = 108 K and at this same temperature the
compound enters in an insulating dielectric state. iii) Finally, a remnant
polarization is stabilized concomitantly with a magnetic anomaly at T* = 70 K.
We propose that YMn$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$ is a peculiar magnetic ferroelectric in
which the polar state is driven by short-range magnetic order.

Parity is a ubiquitous notion in science and serves as a fundamental
principle for describing a physical system. Nanometer-scale metal objects are
predicted to show dramatic differences in physical properties depending on the
electron-number parity. However, the identification of the electron-number
parity effects in real metal nanoparticles has remained elusive because of the
variations in various features of nanoparticles. Here we report the nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) detection of the dynamic effect of the electron-number
parity in silver nanoparticles. With theoretical modeling of the NMR relaxation
in silver nanoparticles, the measured nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate is
found to be proportional to the electron-number-parity-dependent susceptibility
and to the temperature. This observation demonstrates the
electron-number-parity-governed spin dynamics in silver nanoparticles.

<br>
<br>
Evaluating the completion time of a random algorithm or a running stochastic
process is a valuable tip not only from a purely theoretical, but also
pragmatic point of view. In the formal sense, this kind of a task is specified
in terms of the first-passage time statistics. Although first-passage
properties of diffusive processes, usually modeled by different types of the
linear differential equations, are permanently explored with unflagging
intensity, there still exists noticeable niche in this subject concerning the
study of the non-linear diffusive processes. Therefore, the objective of the
present paper is to fill this gap, at least to some extent. Here, we consider
the non-linear diffusion equation in which a diffusivity is power-law dependent
on the concentration/probability density, and analyse its properties from the
viewpoint of the first-passage time statistics. Depending on the value of the
power-law exponent, we demonstrate the exact and approximate expressions for
the survival probability and the first-passage time distribution along with its
asymptotic representation. These results refer to the freely and harmonically
trapped diffusing particle. While in the former case the mean first-passage
time is divergent, even though the first-passage time distribution is
normalized to unity, it is finite in the latter. To support this result, we
derive the exact formula for the mean first-passage time to the target
prescribed in the minimum of the harmonic potential.

To prolong lifetime and reduce energy consumption, a thorough understanding
of abrasive wear is essential. The potentially crucial influence of surface
topography intricacies on tribological behavior have been obscured, since
roughness and waviness are often considered simple scalar quantities. Here, the
complete waviness profile of the sliding track was used to shed light on the
influence of surface topography on abrasive wear. Bearing steel pins and disks
were tribologically tested with Al2O3-based slurries as interfacial medium. It
was found that even small surface deviations (albeit minimized and controlled
for) can significantly increase the friction coefficient - up to 91 %. Not only
are frictional fluctuations strongly correlated with the disks' initial
waviness profile, these small fluctuations correlate with unevenly-distributed
high wear.

We use a combination of numerical matrix product states (MPS) and analytical
approaches to investigate the phase diagram of the two-leg $t$-$J$ ladder in
the region of low to intermediate fillings. We choose the same coupling
strength along the leg- and rung-directions, but study the effect of adding a
nearest-neighbor repulsion $V$. We observe a rich phase diagram and
analytically identify a Lifshitz-like band filling transition, which can be
associated to a numerically observed crossover from s-wave to d-wave like
superconducting quasi-long range order (QLRO). Due to the strong interactions,
the Lifshitz transition is smeared into a crossover region which separates two
distinct Luttinger theories with unequal physical meaning of the Luttinger
parameter. Our numerically exact MPS results spotlight deviations from standard
Luttinger theory in this crossover region and is consistent with Luttinger
theory sufficiently far away from the Lifshitz transition. At very low
fillings, studying the Friedel-like oscillations of the local density
identifies a precursor region to a Wigner crystal at small values of the
magnetic exchange interaction $J/t$. We discuss analytically how tuning
parameters at these fillings modifies the phase diagram, and find good
agreement with MPS results.

A general method is presented for modeling high entropy alloys as ensembles
of randomly sampled, ordered configurations on a given lattice. Statistical
mechanics is applied post hoc to derive the ensemble properties as a function
of composition and temperature, including the free energy of mixing and local
structure. Random sampling is employed to address the high computational costs
needed to model alloys with a large number of components. Doing so also
provides rigorous convergence criteria, including the quantification of noise
due to random sampling, and an estimation of the number of additional samples
required to lower this noise to the needed/desired levels. This method is
well-suited for a variety of cases: i) high entropy alloys, where standard
lattice models are costly; ii) "medium" entropy alloys, where both the entropy
and enthalpy play significant roles; and iii) alloys with residual short-range
order. Binary to 5-component alloys of the group-IV chalcogenides are used as
case examples, for which the predicted miscibility shows excellent agreement
with experiment.

We theoretically show that zero-point electromagnetic fluctuations can
strongly impact solids' electrical conductivity in the one-dimensional
localization regime. On a model example of a tight-binding chain in a
single-mode cavity, we reveal the physical processes responsible for the
modification of the localization length: (1) electron/hole transport mediated
by virtual photon emission, traversing along resonant levels, and photon
re-absorption (2) shaking of potential relief via electromagnetic fluctuations
seem by the electron as effective band narrowing and (3) polaron-type mass
enhancement. The first process, leading to conduction enhancement, is possible
only at temperatures comparable with cavity photon energy. The last two
processes suppress the conduction and are possible at arbitrary temperatures.
Due to the exponential scaling of 1d conductivity with length, the predicted
effects are observable at realistic light-matter coupling strength.

<br>
We present an algorithm to solve very large one-dimensional disordered and
interacting few-particle systems. Our approach exploits the localized nature of
the eigenfunctions in real space to achieve a linear scaling with the total
system size $L$. This allows us to solve for all eigenfunctions of
single-particle systems with different types of disorder up to one billion
sites. Based on this technology we collect very detailed histograms of
properties of eigenfunctions, such as the localization length or the
participation ratio as a function of their energy. These histograms reveal
surprisingly rich fine structures, whose origins we discuss. We also apply the
algorithm to single particle problems where not all eigenfunctions are
localized and show how this is diagnosed. Finally we extend the algorithm to
interacting two-particle problems in the presence of disorder and demonstrate
that our algorithm is well suited to analyze the effect of interactions on
wavefunctions.

The microscopic origin of the electric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
(eDMI) is unveiled and discussed by analytical analysis and first-principles
based calculations. As similar to the magnetic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (mDMI), eDMI also originates from electron-mediated effect and more
specifically from certain electron hoppings that are being activated due to
certain local inversion symmetry breaking. However, the eDMI energy is found to
be at least a third-order interaction in atomic displacements instead of
bilinear in magnetic dipole moments for mDMI. Furthermore, the eDMI energy form
is presented, and we find that novel electrical topological defects (namely,
chiral electric bobbers) can arise from this eDMI. Thus unraveling the
microscopic origin of eDMI has the potential to lead to, and explain, the
discovery of novel polar topological phases.

The search for topological superconductivity has motivated investigations
into materials that combine topological and superconducting properties. The
half-Heusler compound YPtBi appears to be such a material, however experiments
have thus far been limited to bulk single crystals, drastically limiting the
scope of available experiments. This has made it impossible to investigate the
potential topological nature of the superconductivity in this material.
Experiments to access details about the superconducting state require
sophisticated lithographic structures, typically based on thin films. Here we
report on the establishment of high crystalline quality epitaxial thin films of
YPtBi(111), grown using molecular beam epitaxy on Al2O3(0001) substrates. A
robust superconducting state is observed, with both critical temperature and
critical field consistent with that previously reported for bulk crystals.
Moreover we find that AlOx capping sufficiently protects the sample surface
from degradation to allow for proper lithography. Our results pave a path
towards the development of advanced lithographic structures, that will allow
the exploration of the potentially topological nature of superconductivity in
YPtBi.

Today solid-state cooling technologies below liquid nitrogen boiling
temperature (77 K), crucial to quantum information technology and probing
quantum state of matter, are greatly limited due to the lack of good
thermoelectric and/or thermomagnetic materials. Here, we report the discovery
of colossal Nernst power factor of 3800$\times$10$^{-4}$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$
under 5 T at 25 K and high Nernst figure-of-merit of 71$\times$10$^{-4}$
K$^{-1}$ under 5 T at 20 K in topological semimetal NbSb$_2$ single crystals.
The observed high thermomagnetic performance is attributed to large Nernst
thermopower and longitudinal electrical conductivity, and relatively low
transverse thermal conductivity. The large and unsaturated Nernst thermopower
is the result of the combination of highly desirable electronic structures of
NbSb$_2$ having compensated high mobility electrons and holes near Fermi level
and strong phonon-drag effect. This discovery opens an avenue for exploring
material option for the solid-state heat pumping below liquid nitrogen
temperature.

The silicon-vacancy (SiV) center in diamond is typically found in three
stable charge states, SiV0, SiV- and SiV2-, but studying the processes leading
to their formation is challenging, especially at room temperature, due to their
starkly different photo-luminescence rates. Here, we use confocal fluorescence
microscopy to activate and probe charge interconversion between all three
charge states under ambient conditions. In particular, we witness the formation
of SiV0 via the two-step capture of diffusing, photo-generated holes, a process
we expose both through direct SiV0 fluorescence measurements at low
temperatures and confocal microscopy observations in the presence of externally
applied electric fields. Further, we show that continuous red illumination
induces the converse process, first transforming SiV0 into SiV-, then into
SiV2-. Our results shed light on the charge dynamics of SiV and promise
opportunities for nanoscale sensing and quantum information processing.

The development of nanocomposites relies on structure-property relations,
which necessitate multiscale modeling approaches. This study presents a
modelling framework based on mesoscopic models to predict the thermal and
mechanical properties of nanocomposites starting from their molecular
structure. Mesoscopic models of polypropylene (PP) and graphene based
nanofillers (Graphene (Gr), Graphene Oxide (GO) and reduced Graphene Oxide
(rGO)) were analyzed and compared against experiments. The developed mesoscopic
model has been validated with the experimental characterization of the thermal
and mechanical properties of PP/Gr nanocomposite samples, showing better
prediction capabilities with respect to traditional continuum models. Results
demonstrate that with the modest addition of nanofillers (up to 2 wt.%), the
Young's modulus and thermal conductivity show up to 35% and 25% enhancement,
respectively, while the Poisson's ratio slightly decreases. Among the different
combinations tested, PP/Gr nanocomposite shows the best mechanical properties,
whereas PP/rGO the best thermal conductivity. This mesoscopic model validated
by experiments will contribute to the development of smart materials with
enhanced mechanical and thermal properties based on polypropylene, especially
for mechanical, energy storage, and sensing applications.

In this work we present systematic set of measurements carried out by muon
spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu^+$SR) and neutron powder diffraction (NPD) on
the solid solution Na$_{\rm x}$Ca$_{1- \rm x}$Cr$_2$O$_4$. This study
investigates Na-ion dynamics in the quasi-1D (Q1D) diffusion channels created
by the honeycomb-like arrangement of CrO$_6$ octahedra, in the presence of
defects introduced by Ca doping. With increasing Ca content, the size of the
diffusion channels is enlarged, however, this effect does not enhance the Na
ion mobility. Instead the overall diffusivity is hampered by the local defects
and the Na hopping probability is lowered. The diffusion mechanism in Na$_{\rm
x}$Ca$_{1- \rm x}$Cr$_2$O$_4$ was found to be interstitial and the activation
energy as well as diffusion coefficient were determined for all the members of
the solid solution.

<h3>Long-range order in the XY model on the honeycomb lattice</h3>

Using the reflection positivity method we provide the rigorous proof of the
existence of long range magnetic order for the XY model on the honeycomb
lattice for large spins $S\ge 3$. This stays in contrast with the result
obtained using the {\it same} method but on the square lattice -- which gives a
stable long-range order for spins $S \ge 1$. We suggest that the difference
between these two cases stems from the enhanced quantum spin fluctuations on
the honeycomb lattice. Using linear spin wave theory we show that the enhanced
fluctuations are due to the overall much higher kinetic energy of the spin
waves on the honeycomb lattice (with Dirac points) than on the square lattice
(with good nesting properties).

Solid-liquid phase transitions are fundamental physical processes, but
atomically-resolved microscopy has yet to capture both the solid and liquid
dynamics for such a transition. We have developed a new technique for
controlling the melting and freezing of 2D molecular layers on a graphene
field-effect transistor (FET) that allows us to image phase transition dynamics
via atomically-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy. Back-gate voltages
applied to a F4TCNQ-decorated graphene FET induce reversible transitions
between a charge-neutral solid phase and a negatively charged liquid phase.
Nonequilibrium molecular melting dynamics are visualized by rapidly heating the
graphene surface with electrical current and imaging the resulting evolution
toward new equilibrium states. An analytical model has been developed that
explains the observed equilibrium mixed-state phases based on spectroscopic
measurement of both solid and liquid molecular energy levels. Observed
non-equilibrium melting dynamics are consistent with Monte Carlo simulations.

We consider two-dimensional (2d) quantum many-body systems with long-range
orders, where the only gapless excitations in the spectrum are Goldstone modes
of spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. To understand the interplay
between classical long-range order of local order parameters and quantum order
of long-range entanglement in the ground states, we study the topological point
defects and textures of order parameters in such systems. We show that the
universal properties of point defects and textures are determined by the
remnant symmetry enriched topological order in the symmetry-breaking ground
states with a non-fluctuating order parameter, and provide a classification for
their properties based on the inflation-restriction exact sequence. We
highlight a few phenomena revealed by our theory framework. First, in the
absence of intrinsic topological orders, we show a connection between the
symmetry properties of point defects and textures to deconfined quantum
criticality. Second, when the symmetry-breaking ground state have intrinsic
topological orders, we show that the point defects can permute different anyons
when braided around. They can also obey projective fusion rules in the sense
that multiple vortices can fuse into an Abelian anyon, a phenomena for which we
coin "defect fractionalization". Finally, we provide a formula to compute the
fractional statistics and fractional quantum numbers carried by textures
(skyrmions) in Abelian topological orders.
