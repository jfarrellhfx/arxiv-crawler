<h3>Contractility-induced phase separation in active solids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09995" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09995</a>

A combination of cellular contractility and active phase separation in
cell-matrix composites is thought to be an enabler of spatiotemporal patterning
in multicellular tissues across scales, from somitogenesis to cartilage
condensation. To characterize these phenomena, we provide a general theory that
incorporates active cellular contractility into the classical
Cahn--Hilliard-Larch{\'e} model for phase separation in passive viscoelastic
solids. We investigate the dynamics of phase separation in this model and show
how a homogeneous mixture can be destabilized by activity via either a
pitchfork or Hopf bifurcation, resulting in stable phase separation and/or
traveling waves. Numerical simulations of the full equations allow us to track
the evolution of the resulting self-organized patterns, in both periodic and
mechanically constrained domains, and in different geometries. Altogether, our
study underscores the importance of integrating both cellular activity and
mechanical phase separation in understanding patterning in soft, active
biosolids, and might explain previous experimental observations of cartilage
condensation in both in-vivo and in-vitro settings.

<h3>Acceptor-based qubit in silicon with tunable strain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10019" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10019</a>

Long coherence time and compatibility with semiconductor fabrication make
spin qubits in silicon an attractive platform for quantum computing. In recent
years, hole spin qubits are being developed as they have the advantages of weak
coupling to nuclear spin noise and strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), in
constructing high-fidelity quantum gates. However, there are relatively few
studies on the hole spin qubits in a single acceptor, which requires only low
density of the metallic gates. In particular, the investigation of flexible
tunability using controllable strain for fault-tolerant quantum gates of
acceptor-based qubits is still lacking. Here, we study the tunability of
electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) of acceptor-based hole spin qubits with
controllable strain. The flexible tunability of LH-HH splitting and spin-hole
coupling (SHC) with the two kinds of strain can avoid high electric field at
the "sweet spot", and the operation performance of the acceptor qubits could be
optimized. Longer relaxation time or stronger EDSR coupling at low electric
field can be obtained. Moreover, with asymmetric strain, two "sweet spots" are
induced and may merge together, and form a second-order "sweet spot". As a
result, the quality factor $Q$ can reach $10^{4}$ for single-qubit operation,
with high tolerance for the electric field variation. Furthermore, the
two-qubit operation of acceptor qubits based on dipole-dipole interaction is
discussed for high-fidelity two-qubit gates. The tunability of spin qubit
properties in acceptor via strain could provide promising routes for spin-based
quantum computing.

<h3>Energetics of Cytoskeletal Gel Contraction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10021" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10021</a>

<br>
<br>
Cytoskeletal gels are prototyped to reproduce the mechanical contraction of
the cytoskeleton in-vitro. They are composed of a polymer network (backbone),
swollen by the presence of a liquid solvent, and active molecules (molecular
motors, MMs) that transduce chemical energy into the mechanical work of
contraction. These motors attach to the polymer chains to shorten them and/or
act as dynamic crosslinks, thereby constraining the thermal fluctuation of the
chains. We describe both mechanisms thermodynamically as a microstructural
reconfiguration, where the backbone stiffens to motivate solvent (out)flow and
accommodate contraction. Via simple steady-state energetic analysis, under the
simplest case of isotropic contraction, we quantify the mechanical energy
required to achieve contraction as a function of polymer chain density and
molecular motor density. We identify two limit cases, (fm) fast MM activation
for which MMs provide all the available mechanical energy instantaneously and
leave the polymer in a stiffened state, i.e. their activity occurs at a time
scale that is much smaller than solvent diffusion, and (sm) slow MM activation
for which the MM activation timescale is much longer. To achieve the same final
contracted state, fm requires the largest amount of work per unit reference
volume, while sm requires the least. For all intermediate cases where the
timescale of MM activation is comparable with that of solvent flow, the
required work ranges between the two cases. We provide all these quantities as
a function of chain density and MM density. Finally, we compare our results
with experiments and observe good agreement.

<h3>A Novel Method to Probe the Pronounced Growth of Correlation Lengths in  an Active Glass-forming Liquids using Elongated Probe</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10064" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10064</a>
<br>
<i>Anoop Mutneja, Smarajit Karmakar</i>
<br>
<br>
The growth of correlation lengths in equilibrium glass-forming liquids near
the glass transition is considered a critical finding in the quest to
understand the physics of glass formation. These understandings helped us
understand various dynamical phenomena observed in supercooled liquids. It is
known that at least two different length scales exist - one is of thermodynamic
origin, while the other is dynamical in nature. Recent observations of glassy
dynamics in biological and synthetic systems where the external or internal
driving source controls the dynamics, apart from the usual thermal noise, led
to the emergence of the field of active matter. A question of whether the
physics of glass formation in these active systems is also accompanied by
growing dynamic and static lengths is indeed timely. In this article, we probe
the growth of dynamic and static lengths in a model active glass system using
rod-like elongated probe particles, an experimentally viable method. We show
that the dynamic and static lengths in these non-equilibrium systems grow much
more rapidly than their passive counterparts. We then offer an understanding of
the violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation and Stokes-Einstein-Debye
relation using these lengths via a scaling theory.

<h3>Accuracy of quantum simulators with ultracold dipolar molecules: a  quantitative comparison between continuum and lattice descriptions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09821" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09821</a>
<br>
<i>Michael Hughes, Axel U. J. Lode, Dieter Jaksch, Paolo Molignini</i>
<br>
<br>
With rapid progress in control and manipulation of ultracold magnetic atoms
and dipolar molecules, the quantum simulation of lattice models with strongly
interacting dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) and high densities is now within
experimental reach. This rapid development raises the issue about the validity
of quantum simulation in such regimes. In this study, we address this question
by performing a full quantitative comparison between the continuum description
of a one-dimensional gas of dipolar bosons in an optical lattice, and the
single-band Bose-Hubbard lattice model that it quantum simulates. By comparing
energies and density distributions, and by calculating direct overlaps between
the continuum and lattice many-body wavefunctions, we demonstrate that in
regimes of strong DDI and high densities the continuum system fails to recreate
the desired lattice model. Two-band Hubbard models become necessary to reduce
the discrepancy observed between continuum and lattice descriptions, but
appreciable deviations in the density profile still remain. Our study
elucidates the role of strong DDI in generating physics beyond lowest-band
descriptions and should offer a guideline for the calibration of near-term
dipolar quantum simulators.

<h3>Complex phase-fluctuation effects correlated with granularity in  superconducting NbN nanofilms</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09836" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09836</a>
<br>
<i>Meenakshi Sharma, Manju Singh, Rajib K. Rakshit, Surinder P. Singh, Matteo Fretto, Natascia De Leo, Andrea Perali, Nicola Pinto</i>
<br>
<br>
Superconducting nanofilms are tunable systems that can host a 3D-2D
dimensional crossover, leading to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)
superconducting transition approaching the 2D regime. Reducing further the
dimensionality, from 2D to quasi-1D, superconducting nanostructures with
disorder can generate quantum and thermal phase slips (PS) of the order
parameter. Both BKT and PS are complex phase fluctuation phenomena of difficult
experimental detection. Here, we have characterized superconducting NbN
nanofilms thinner than 15 nm, on different substrates, by temperature dependent
resistivity and current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. Our measurements have
evidenced clear features related to the emergence of BKT transition and PS
events. The contemporary observation in the same system of BKT transition and
PS events and their tunable evolution in temperature and thickness, has been
explained as due to the nano-conducting paths forming in a granular NbN system.
In one of the investigated samples we have been able to trace and characterize
the continuous evolution in temperature from quantum to thermal PS. Our
analysis has established that the detected complex phase phenomena are strongly
related to the interplay between the typical size of the nano-conductive paths
and the superconducting coherence length.

<h3>Elastic stripes formation at electronic transitions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09837" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09837</a>
<br>
<i>Giuliano Chiriacò, Andrew J. Millis</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the possibility of a striped inhomoegenous phase occurring as
an electronic system with an order parameter linearly coupled to the elastic
degrees of freedom is tuned through the electronic phase transition. We find
that in finite systems where boundary conditions create an eleastic
incompatibility, a stripe pattern may emerge in the vicinity of the electronic
transition. Stripes are stabilized when the gained elastic energy overcomes the
typical electronic and domain wall energy costs. In thin film geometries, the
stripes are found to extend across the entire depth of the system. We also
study the behavior of the phase fraction across the spinodal region of a first
order phase transition. The orientation of stripes and the possibility of more
complicated patterns is also discussed.

<h3>Spectroscopy of the frustrated quantum antiferromagnet Cs$_2$CuCl$_4$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09841" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09841</a>
<br>
<i>Adolfo O. Fumega, D. Wong, C. Schulz, F. Rodríguez, S. Blanco-Canosa</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the electronic structure of Cs$_2$CuCl$_4$, a material
discussed in the framework of a frustrated quantum antiferromagnet, by means of
resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) and Density Functional Theory (DFT).
From the non-dispersive highly localized dd excitations, we resolve the crystal
field splitting of the Cu$^{2+}$ ions in a strongly distorted tetrahedral
coordination. This allows us to model the RIXS spectrum within the Crystal
Field Theory (CFT), assign the dd orbital excitations and retrieve
experimentally the values of the crystal field splitting parameters D$_q$,
D$_s$ and D$_{\tau}$. The electronic structure obtained ab-initio agrees with
the RIXS spectrum and modelled by CFT, highlighting the potential of combined
spectroscopic, cluster and DFT calculations to determine the electronic ground
state of complex materials.

<h3>Optical Activity of Solids from First Principles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09845" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09845</a>
<br>
<i>Xiaoming Wang, Yanfa Yan</i>
<br>
<br>
Within the framework of independent particle approximation, the optical
activity tensor of solids is formulated as from different contributions: the
magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and band dispersion terms. The first two
terms have similar counterparts in the theory of finite systems, while the last
term is unique for crystals. The magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole
transition moments are calculated with a sum-over-states formulation. We apply
the formulation to calculate and analyze the optical rotation of elemental
tellurium and the circular dichroism of $(6,4)$ carbon nanotube. Decomposed
optical activity into different contributions are discussed. The calculated
spectra agree well with experiments. As a showcase of achiral crystals, we
calculate the optical activity of wurtzite GaN.

<h3>Pair Density Waves from Local Band Geometry</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09846" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09846</a>
<br>
<i>Guodong Jiang, Yafis Barlas</i>
<br>
<br>
A band-projection formalism is developed for calculating the superfluid
weight in two-dimensional multi-orbital superconductors with an
orbital-dependent pairing. It is discovered that, in this case, the band
geometric superfluid stiffness tensor can be locally non-positive-definite in
some regions of the Brillouin zone. When these regions are large enough or
include nodal singularities, the total superfluid weight becomes
non-positive-definite due to pairing fluctuations, resulting in the transition
of a BCS state to a pair-density wave (PDW). This geometric BCS-PDW transition
is studied in the context of two-orbital superconductors, and proof of the
existence of a geometric BCS-PDW transition in a generic topological flat band
is established.

<h3>Perspectives on Novel Refractory Amorphous High-Entropy Alloys in  Extreme Environments</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09853" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09853</a>
<br>
<i>Matheus A. Tunes, Hi T. Vo, Jon K.S. Baldwin, Tarik A. Saleh, Saryu J. Fensin, Osman El-Atwani</i>
<br>
<br>
Two new refractory amorphous high-entropy alloys (RAHEAs) within the
W--Ta--Cr--V and W--Ta--Cr--V--Hf systems were herein synthesized using
magnetron-sputtering and tested under high-temperature annealing and displacing
irradiation using \textit{in situ} Transmission Electron Microscopy. While the
WTaCrV RAHEA was found to be unstable under such tests, additions of Hf in this
system composing a new quinary WTaCrVHf RAHEA was found to be a route to
achieve stability both under annealing and irradiation. A new effect of
nanoprecipitate reassembling observed to take place within the WTaCrVHf RAHEA
under irradiation indicates that a duplex microstructure composed of an
amorphous matrix with crystalline nanometer-sized precipitates enhances the
radiation response of the system. It is demonstrated that tunable chemical
complexity arises as a new alloy design strategy to foster the use of novel
RAHEAs within extreme environments. New perspectives for the alloy design and
application of chemically-complex amorphous metallic alloys in extreme
environments are presented with focus on their thermodynamic phase stability
when subjected to high-temperature annealing and displacing irradiation.

<h3>Theory and simulations of the angular momentum transfer from swift  electrons to spherical nanoparticles in STEM</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09883" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09883</a>
<br>
<i>José Ángel Castellanos-Reyes, Jesús Castrejón-Figueroa, Alejandro Reyes-Coronado</i>
<br>
<br>
Electron beams in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) exert
forces and torques on study samples, with magnitudes that allow the controlled
manipulation of nanoparticles (a technique called electron tweezers). Related
theoretical research has mostly focused on the study of forces and linear
momentum transfers from swift electrons (like those used in STEM) to
nanoparticles. However, theoretical research on the rotational aspects of the
interaction would benefit not only the development of electron tweezers, but
also other fields within electron microscopy such as electron vortices.
Starting from a classical-electrodynamics description, we present a theoretical
model, alongside an efficient numerical methodology, to calculate the angular
momentum transfer from a STEM swift electron to a spherical nanoparticle. We
show simulations of angular momentum transfers to aluminum, gold, and bismuth
nanoparticles of different sizes. We found that the transferred angular
momentum is always perpendicular to the system's plane of symmetry, displaying
a constant direction for all the cases considered. In the simulations, the
angular momentum transfer increased with the radius of the nanoparticle, but
decreased as the speed of the electron or the impact parameter increased. Also,
the electric contribution to the angular momentum transfer dominated over the
magnetic one, being comparable only for high electron's speeds (greater than
90% of the speed of light). Additionally, for nanoparticles with 1 nm radius of
the studied materials, we found validity criteria for the small-particle
approximation (in which the nanoparticle is modeled as an electric point
dipole). We believe that these findings contribute to the understanding of
rotational aspects present in STEM experiments, and might be useful for further
developments in electron tweezers and other electron microscopy related
techniques.

<h3>Fractional quantum Hall valley ferromagnetism in the extreme quantum  limit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09910" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09910</a>
<br>
<i>Md. Shafayat Hossain, M. K. Ma, Y. J. Chung, S. K. Singh, A. Gupta, L. N. Pfeiffer, K. W. West, K. W. Baldwin, R. Winkler, M. Shayegan</i>
<br>
<br>
Electrons' multiple quantum degrees of freedom can lead to rich physics,
including a competition between various exotic ground states, as well as novel
applications such as spintronics and valleytronics. Here we report
magneto-transport experiments demonstrating how the valley degree of freedom
impacts the fractional quantum states (FQHSs), and the related
magnetic-flux-electron composite fermions (CFs), at very high magnetic fields
in the extreme quantum limit when only the lowest Landau level is occupied.
Unlike in other multivalley two-dimensional electron systems such as Si or
monolayer graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides, in our AlAs sample we
can continuously tune the valley polarization via the application of in-situ
strain. We find that the FQHSs remain exceptionally strong even as they make
valley polarization transitions, revealing a surprisingly robust ferromagnetism
of the FQHSs and the underlying CFs. Our observation implies that the CFs are
strongly interacting in our system. We are also able to obtain a phase diagram
for the FQHS and CF valley polarization in the extreme quantum limit as we
monitor transitions of the FHQSs with different valley polarizations.

<h3>Short-range order and compositional phase stability in refractory  high-entropy alloys via first principles theory and atomistic modelling:  NbMoTa, NbMoTaW and VNbMoTaW</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09911" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09911</a>
<br>
<i>Christopher D. Woodgate, Julie B. Staunton</i>
<br>
<br>
Using an all-electron, first principles, Landau-type theory, we study the
nature of short-range order and compositional phase stability in equiatomic
refractory high entropy alloys, NbMoTa, NbMoTaW, and VNbMoTaW. We also
investigate selected binary subsystems to provide insight into the physical
mechanisms driving order. Our approach examines the short-range order of the
solid solutions directly, infers disorder/order transitions, and also extracts
parameters suitable for atomistic modelling of diffusional phase
transformations. We find a hierarchy of relationships between the chemical
species in these materials which promote ordering tendencies. The most dominant
is a relative atomic size difference between the 3d element, V, and the other
4d and 5d elements which drives a B32-like order. For systems where V is not
present, ordering is dominated by the difference in filling of valence states;
pairs of elements which are isoelectronic remain weakly correlated to low
temperatures, while pairs with a valence difference present B2-like order. Our
estimated order-disorder transition temperature in VNbMoTaW is sufficiently
high for us to suggest that SRO in this material may be experimentally
observable.

<h3>Uncovering hidden spin polarization of energy bands in antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09921" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09921</a>
<br>
<i>Lin-Ding Yuan, Xiuwen Zhang, Carlos Mera, Alex Zunger</i>
<br>
<br>
Many textbook physical effects in crystals are enabled by some specific
symmetries. In contrast to such "apparent effects", "hidden effect X" refers to
the general condition where the nominal global system symmetry would disallow
the effect X, whereas the symmetry of local sectors within the crystal would
enable effect X. Known examples include the hidden Rashba and/or hidden
Dresselhaus spin polarization that require spin orbit coupling, but (unlike the
apparent Rashba and Dresselhaus counterparts) can exist even in
inversion-symmetric non-magnetic crystals. Here we point out that the spin
splitting effect that does not require spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can have a
hidden spin polarization counterpart in antiferromagnets. We show that such
hidden, SOC-independent effects reflect intrinsic properties of the perfect
crystal rather than an effect due to imperfections, opening the possibility for
experimental realization, and offering a potential way to switch
antiferromagnetic ordering.

<h3>Orientational wetting and topological transitions in confined solutions  of semi-flexible polymers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09926" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09926</a>
<br>
<i>Maxime M. C. Tortora, Daniel Jost</i>
<br>
<br>
Despite their considerable practical and biological applications, the link
between molecular properties, assembly conditions and self-organized structure
in confined polymer solutions remains elusive. Here, we explore the lyotropic
nematic ordering of semi-flexible chains in spherical confinement for multiple
contour lengths across a wide regime of concentrations. We uncover an original
crossover from two distinct quadrupolar states to longitudinal or latitudinal
bipolar structures with increasing densities. These transitions are attributed
to the combination of orientational wetting with subtle variations in their
liquid-crystal (LC) elastic anisotropies. Our molecular simulations are
corroborated by density functional calculations, and evidence the extent to
which the folding of macromolecules and the self-assembly of
low-molecular-weight LCs may be guided by the same, universal principles.

<h3>Inertial Force Transmission in Dense Granular Flows</h3>

<i>Matthew Macaulay, Pierre Rognon</i>
<br>
<br>
Dense granular flows are well described by several continuum models, however,
their internal dynamics remain elusive. This study explores the contact force
distributions in simulated steady and homogenous shear flows. Results
demonstrate the existence of high magnitude contact forces in faster flows with
stiffer grains. A proposed physical mechanism explains this rate-dependent
force transmission. This analysis establishes a relation between contact forces
and grain velocities, providing an entry point to unify a range of continuum
models derived from either contact forces or grain velocity.

<h3>Discrete Choice Models, Market Shares, and Density Functional Theory:  Application to Monolayer Nanomaterials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09952" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09952</a>

Despite possessing unique and often superior physical properties,
nanomaterials rarely attract attention beyond academic circles. In order for
nanomaterials to attract investment for large-scale production, it is necessary
to clarify how physical properties relate to consumer demand. In this paper, we
show how density functional theory (DFT), a technique from computational
physics, can be integrated into econometrics to develop models for nanomaterial
market shares. Concretely, we study a simple discrete-choice model in which
consumers select one of two firms from which to purchase platinum catalyst
materials for hydrogen fuel cells. One of these firms produces an ordinary
material catalyst (platinum) and the other produces a nanomaterial catalyst
(monolayer platinum). Consumers make their selections according to hedonic
utility expressions, which depend upon the physical characteristics of the
materials in question. In turn, these physical characteristics can be
calculated using the DFT technique. As an application of our model, we show how
marginal production costs necessary for the nanomaterial catalyst to achieve a
particular market share can be inferred, thereby providing a means for
entrepreneurs to formulate cost targets for large-scale nanomaterial
production. Our model, which can be generalised beyond the situation considered
here, represents the first step towards the unification of econometrics and
computational physics, an intellectual advancement which may facilitate future
efforts at nanomaterial commercialisation.

<h3>Relaxation exponents of OTOCs and overlap with local Hamiltonians</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09965" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09965</a>
<br>
<i>Vinitha Balachandran, Dario Poletti</i>
<br>
<br>
OTOC has been used to characterize the information scrambling in quantum
systems. Recent studies showed that local conserved quantities play a crucial
role in governing the relaxation dynamics of OTOC in non-integrable systems. In
particular, slow scrambling of OTOC is seen for observables that has an overlap
with local conserved quantities. However, an observable may not overlap with
the Hamiltonian, but with the Hamiltonian elevated to an exponent larger than
one. Here, we show that higher exponents correspond to faster relaxation,
although still algebraic, and with exponents that can increase indefinitely.
Our analytical results are supported by numerical experiments.

<h3>Ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity induces high-performance  thermoelectricity in Janus group-VIA binary monolayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09971" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09971</a>
<br>
<i>Shao-Bo Chen, San-Dong Guo, Bing Lv, Mei Xu, Xiang-Rong Chen, Hua-Yun Geng</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, the electrical transport, thermal transport, and
thermoelectric properties of three new Janus STe$_{2}$, SeTe$_{2}$, and
Se$_{2}$Te monolayers are systematically studied by first-principles
calculations, as well as the comparative with available literature's results
using different methods. It is found that the Seebeck coefficient and
conductivity have opposite dependence on temperature, and we illustrate this
phenomenon in detail. The decrease of the thermoelectric power factor (PF) with
temperature originates from the decrease in conductivity. To obtain accurate
and convergent lattice thermal conductivity, the root mean square (RMS) is
calculated to obtain a reasonable cutoff radius for the calculation of
third-order forces. Janus STe$_{2}$, SeTe$_{2}$, and Se$_{2}$Te monolayers
exhibit ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.2, 0.133, and
4.81$\times10^{-4}$ W/mK at 300 K, which result from the strong coupling effect
between the acoustic mode and the low-frequency optical branch, low phonon
group velocity, small phonon lifetime, and large anharmonicity. Consequently,
ultra-high $\textit{ZT}$ values of 2.11 (2.09), 3.28 (4.24), and 3.40 (6.51)
for n-type(p-type) carrier doping of STe$_{2}$, SeTe$_{2}$, and Se$_{2}$Te are
obtained, indicating that they are promising thermoelectric materials.

<h3>Metastable Carbon at Extreme Conditions</h3>

Carbon at extreme conditions is the focus of intensive scientific inquiry due
to its importance for applications in inertial confinement fusion experiments
and for understanding the interior structure of carbon-rich exoplanets. The
extreme metastability of diamond at very high pressures has been discovered in
recent dynamic compression experiments. This work addresses an important
question about the existence of other competitive metastable carbon phases that
might be observed in shock experiments. It was found that diamond polytypes,
carbon crystals with mixed cubic and hexagonal diamond stacking planes, are the
only metastable carbon crystal phases energetically competitive with cubic
diamond at pressures between 100 and 1,000 GPa. Above 1 TPa, no metastable
phases are found to be energetically competitive with thermodynamically stable
BC8 and simple cubic phases. The existence of low enthalpy diamond polytypes

<h3>Topological Anderson Transitions in Chiral Symmetry Classes</h3>

We study quantum phase transitions of three-dimensional disordered systems in
the chiral classes (AIII and BDI) with and without weak topological indices.
From our extensive numerical study, we show that the systems with a non-trivial
weak topological index universally exhibit an emergent thermodynamic phase
where wave functions are delocalized along one spatial direction but
exponentially localized in the other two spatial directions, which we call the
quasi-localized phase. This quasi-localized phase is distinct from the
conventional metallic and Anderson-localized phases, where wave functions are
delocalized and localized along all directions, respectively. We obtain the
critical exponents of two different disorder-induced phase transitions, one
between the metallic and quasi-localized phases and the other between the
quasi-localized and Anderson-localized phases. These critical exponents are
different from the critical exponent with no weak topological indices in the
same symmetry classes, which signals the new universality classes induced by
topology.

Predicting the mechanical response of the soft gel materials under external
deformation is of paramount importance in many areas, such as foods,
pharmaceuticals, solid-liquid separations, cosmetics, aerogels and drug
delivery. Most of the understanding of the elasticity of gel materials is based
on the concept of fractal scaling with very little microscopic insights.
Previous experimental observations strongly suggest that the gel material loses
the fractal correlations upon deformation and the range of packing fraction up
to which the fractal scaling can be applied is very limited. Also, correctly
implementing the fractal modeling requires identifying the elastic backbone,
which is a formidable task. So far, there is no clear understanding of the gel
elasticity at high packing fraction and the correct length scale that governs
its mechanical response. In this work, we undertake extensive numerical
simulations to elucidate the different aspects of stress transmission in the
gel materials. We observe the existence of two percolating networks of
compressive and tensile normal forces close to the gel point. We also find that
the probability distribution for the compressive and tensile part normalized by
their respective mean shows universal behavior irrespective of varied
interaction potential, thermal energy and particle size distribution.
Interestingly, there are also large number of contacts with zero normal force,
and consequently, a peak in the normal force distribution is observed at
$f_n\approx0$ even at higher pressure. We also identify the critical internal
state parameters such as mean normal force, force anisotropies and the average
coordination number and propose simple constitutive relations that relate the
different components of the stress to the internal state parameters. The
agreement between our model prediction and the simulation observation is
excellent.

<br>
High-density structures of sub-surface phosphorus dopants in silicon continue
to garner interest as a silicon-based quantum computer platform, however, a
much-needed confirmation of their dopant arrangement has been lacking. In this
work, we take advantage of the chemical specificity of X-ray photoelectron
diffraction to obtain the precise structural configuration of P dopants in
sub-surface Si:P $\delta$-layers. The growth of $\delta$-layer systems with
different levels of doping is carefully studied and verified using X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy and low-energy electron diffraction. Subsequent XPD
measurements reveal that in all cases, the dopants primarily substitute with Si
atoms from the host material. Furthermore, no signs of free carrier-inhibiting
P$-$P dimerization can be observed. Our observations not only settle a nearly
decade-long debate about the dopant arrangement but also demonstrate that XPD
is well suited to study sub-surface dopant structures. This work thus provides
valuable input for an updated understanding of the behavior of Si:P
$\delta$-layers and the modeling of their derived quantum devices.

<br>
<br>
We introduce a two-dimensional Chern insulator in proximity to a $d$-wave
pseudogap state of the high-T$_c$ superconducting material as an effective
platform to realize the higher order topological system. The proximity-induced
$d$-density-wave (DDW) order in the Chern insulator layer serves as an
effective mass. The edge states will be fully gapped by this DDW order. In the
real space, the sign of the DDW order parameter changes at the system corners
due to the $d$-wave factor, leading to the gapless corner states, indicating
that this system may be in a higher order topological state. The higher order
topology in this coupled system is confirmed based on the calculation of the
edge polarization and the quadrupole moment. In the superconducting state where
the superconducting order and the DDW order coexist, the Majorana corner states
emerge.

We report on an experimental investigation of the combined effect of
nonequilibrium quasiparticle injection and supercurrent in superconducting
aluminum wires. At low temperature, we observe the supercurrent-induced
coupling of energy and charge imbalance with spectral resolution. At high

been recently predicted theoretically.

<h3>Electronic structure of folded hexagonal boron nitride</h3>

<br>
<br>
Folded regions are commonly encountered in a number of hexagonal boron
nitride (h-BN) based bulk and nanostructured materials. Two types of structural
modifications occur in folded h-BN layers: local curvature at the folded edges
and interlayer shear of the layers which changes the stacking of the
overlapping flat regions. In this work we discuss, via density functional
theory simulations, the impact of these structural modifications on the ground
state electronic structure of the pristine monolayer. We show that, depending
on the fold orientation, the overlapping region might present different
stacking configurations with subsequent variations of the fundamental band gap;
further gap changes occur at the folded regions. The overall electronic
structure of a BN folded monolayer can finally be described as a type-II
junction between two wide gap semiconductors located at the curved and flat
overlapping zones.

Elastic interactions play an important role in controlling irradiation damage
evolution, but remain largely unexplored experimentally. Using transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution on-axis transmission Kikuchi
diffraction (HR-TKD), we correlate the evolution of irradiation-induced damage
structures and the associated lattice strains in self-ion irradiated pure
tungsten. TEM reveals different dislocation loop structures as a function of
sample thickness, suggesting that free surfaces limit the formation of extended
defect structures found in thicker samples. HR-TKD strain analysis shows the
formation of crystallographically-orientated long-range strain fluctuation
above 0.01 dpa and a decrease of total elastic energy above 0.1 dpa.

<h3>Skew scattering by magnetic monopoles and anomalous Hall effect in  spin-orbit coupled systems</h3>

<br>
<br>
Magnetic textures like skyrmions and domain walls coupled to itinerant
electrons give rise to rich transport phenomena such as anomalous Hall effect
and nonreciprocal current. An interesting case is when the transport
coefficient is related to the global (or topological) property of the magnetic
texture, e.g., skyrmion and domain wall numbers. Such phenomena are also
interesting from applications, in which the transport phenomena are potential
probes for electrically detecting magnetic textures in nano-scale devices.
Here, we show that an anomalous Hall effect proportional to the net magnetic
monopole charge occurs from skew scattering when the magnetic texture couples
to itinerant electrons in a non-centrosymmetric system with spin-orbit
interaction. This mechanism gives rise to a finite anomalous Hall effect in a
ferromagnetic domain wall whose spins rotate in the $xy$ plane, despite no
out-of-plane magnetic moment. We also discuss the relation between the magnetic
texture contributing to the anomalous Hall effect and the crystal symmetry. The
results demonstrate rich features arising from the interplay of spin-orbit
interaction and magnetic textures and their potential for detecting various
magnetic textures in nanoscale devices.

<h3>Multipole theory of optical spatial dispersion in crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10183" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10183</a>
<br>
<i>Óscar Pozo, Ivo Souza</i>
<br>
<br>
Natural optical activity is the paradigmatic example of an effect originating
in the weak spatial inhomogeneity of the electromagnetic field on the atomic
scale. Such effects are well described in molecules by the multipole theory of
electromagnetism, where the coupling to light is treated semiclassically beyond
the electric-dipole approximation. That theory has two shortcomings: it is
limited to bounded systems, and its building blocks - the multipole transition
moments - are origin dependent. In this work, we recast the multipole theory in
a translationally-invariant form that remains valid for periodic crystals.
Working in the independent-particle approximation, we introduce ''intrinsic''
multipole transition moments that are origin independent and transform
covariantly under gauge transformations of the Bloch states. Electric-dipole
transitions are given by the interband Berry connection, while magnetic-dipole
and electric-quadrupole transitions are described by matrix generalizations of
the intrinsic magnetic moment and quantum metric. In addition to multipolar
terms, the response of crystals at first order in the wavevector of light
contains band-dispersion terms that have no counterpart in molecular theories.
The rotatory-strength sum rule for crystals is found to be equivalent to the
topological constraint for a vanishing chiral magnetic effect in equilibrium,
and the formalism is validated by numerical calculations on a tight-binding
model.

<h3>Thermodynamics of a charged relativistic ideal Boltzmann gas</h3>

<br>

This paper presents a toy model of a charged relativistic classical gas in
flat spacetime of arbitrary number of dimensions equipped with some ``pair
production'' mechanism. Working with the microcanonical ensemble, charge is
taken to be conserved in contrast with the total number of ``particles'' plus
``antiparticles'' which varies with temperature $T$. Thermodynamics of the
classical gas is detailed studied in the nonrelativistic ($Mc^{2}\gg kT$) as
well as in the ultrarelativistic ($Mc^{2}\ll kT$) regimes. It is shown that,
although we are dealing with classical distributions, at the ultrarelativistic
regime the behavior of the gas is Planckian. We also compare the thermodynamics
of the toy model with that of quantum gases.

<br>

The temperature dependence of mesoscopic spin-model parameters is derived in
two-sublattice antiferromagnetically aligned systems based on Green's function
theory. It is found that transversal spin correlations decrease the anisotropy
terms while increasing the Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinsky--Moriya exchange
interactions and the latter's contribution to the anisotropy. The obtained
temperature dependences show quantitative agreement with the results for
ferromagnets, and they also agree well with numerical atomistic simulations
which treat the spin correlations without approximations. Possible applications
of the results in multiscale modelling are discussed.

Nonempirical modeling of hydrated single-layer graphene oxide (GO) fragments
revealed that the probable origin of the acidity of aqueous GO solutions is the
dissociation in closely grouped hydroxyls. The process is further promoted by
the adjacent $\pi$-conjugated carbon subsystem at the edges of GO flakes or
their inner defects. The apparent $pK_a$ values of the groups fall in a range
of ca. 2.0 to 5.3.

<h3>Unusual magneto-transport induced by anomalous Hall effect</h3>

<br>
<br>
In a magnetic metal, the Hall resistance is generally taken to be the sum of
the ordinary Hall resistance and the anomalous Hall resistance. Here it is
shown that this empirical relation is no longer valid when either the ordinary
Hall angle or the anomalous Hall angle is not small. Using the proper
conductivity relation, we reveal an unexpected magnetoresistance (MR) induced
by the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). A $B$-linear MR arises and the sign of the
slope depends on the sign of the anomalous Hall angle, giving rise to a
characteristic bow-tie shape. The Hall resistance in a single-band system can
exhibit a nonlinearity which is usually considered as a characteristic of a
two-band system. A $B$-symmetric component appears in the Hall. These effects
reflect the fundamental difference between the ordinary Hall effect (OHE) and
the AHE. Furthermore, we experimentally reproduce the unusual MR and Hall
reported before in Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ and show that these observations can be
well explained by the proposed mechanism. MR often observed in quantum
anomalous Hall insulators provides further confirmation of the picture. The
effect may also account for the large MR observed in non-magnetic
three-dimensional (3D) topological Dirac semimetals.

<br>
<br>
The recent discovery of a zero-resistance state in nickel-based compounds has
generated a re-excitement about the long-standing problem in condensed matter
of high-critical-temperature superconductivity, in light of the analogies
between infinite-layer nickelates and cuprates. However, despite some formal
valence and crystal symmetry analogies, the electronic properties of
infinite-layer nickelates are remarkably original accounting, among other
properties, of a unique Nd5d-Ni3d hybridization. This designates infinite-layer
nickelates as a new class of oxide superconductors which should be considered
on their own. Here we report about Nd1-xSrxNiO2 (x = 0, 0.05 and 0.2) thin
films synthesized with and without a SrTiO3 capping-layer, showing very smooth
and step-terraced surface morphologies. Angle-dependent anisotropic
magnetoresistance measurements performed with a magnetic field rotating
in-plane or out-of-plane with respect to the sample surface, rendered important
information about the magnetic properties of undoped SrTiO3-capped and uncapped
samples. The results point at a key role of the capping-layer in controlling
the magnitude and the anisotropy of the anisotropic magnetoresistance
properties. We discuss this control in terms of a combined effect between the
Nd-Ni hybridization and an intra-atomic exchange coupling between the Nd-4f and
Nd-5d states, the latter essentially contributing to the (magneto)transport.
Further studies foresee the influence of the capping layer on infinite-layer
nickelates with no magnetic rare-earth.

<h3>Investigation of the SiO2-SiC interface using low energy muon spin  rotation spectroscopy</h3>

Using positive muons as local probes implanted at low energy enables
gathering information about the material of interest with nanometer depth
resolution (low energy muon spin rotation spectroscopy (LE-$\mu$SR). In this
work, we leverage the capabilities of LE-$\mu$SR to perform an investigation of
the SiO$_\text{2}$-SiC interface. Thermally oxidized samples are investigated
before and after annealing in nitric oxide (NO) and argon (Ar) ambience.
Thermal oxidation is found to result in structural changes both in the SiC
crystal close to the interface and at the interface itself. Annealing in NO
environment is known to passivate the defects leading to a reduction of the
density of interface traps (D$_{it}$); LE-$\mu$SR further reveals that the NO
annealing results in a thin layer of high carrier concentration in SiC,
extending to more than 50 nm depending on the annealing conditions. We also see
indications of Si vacancy (V$_{Si}$) formation in SiC after thermal oxidation.
Following NO annealing, nitrogen occupies the V$_{Si}$ sites, leading to the
reduction in D$_{it}$ and at the same time, creating a charge-carrier-rich
region near the interface. By comparing the LE-$\mu$SR data from a sample with
known doping density, we perform a high-resolution quantification of the free
carrier concentration near the interface after NO annealing and discuss the
origin of observed near-surface variations. Finally, the depletion of carriers
in a MOS capacitor in the region below the interface is shown using LE-$\mu$SR.
The NO annealed sample shows the narrowest depletion region, likely due to the
reduced D$_{it}$ and charge-carrier-rich region near the interface. Our
findings demonstrate the many benefits of utilizing LE-$\mu$SR to study
critical regions of semiconductor devices that have been inaccessible with
other techniques while retaining nanoscale depth resolution and a
non-destructive approach.

<br>
<br>
The electronic transport properties of a highly hydrogen-substituted
1111-type SmFeAsO epitaxial film with high critical-temperature (Tc = 45 K)
were investigated under high magnetic fields. By using a single-turn magnet
generating up to 130 T, we clarified that the upper critical field ({\mu}0Hc2)
of SmFeAsO0.65H0.35 is 120 T at the nearly low-temperature limit of 2.2 K for
{\mu}0H || ab. The angular dependence of {\mu}0Hc2 revealed that the
anisotropic parameter ({\gamma}) around Tc is ~2, which is comparable with that
of a practical candidate 122-type BaFe2As2 with lower Tc and much smaller than
that of F-substituted SmFeAsO. The small {\gamma} mainly originates from the
high hydrogen incorporation. The extremely high {\mu}0Hc2 and small {\gamma},
together with the high Tc and high critical current density, suggest that
SmFeAsO1-xHx has high potential for the superconducting electromagnets and
cables.

We introduce an efficient method to simulate dynamics of an interacting
quantum impurity coupled to non-interacting fermionic reservoirs. Viewing the
impurity as an open quantum system, we describe the reservoirs by their
Feynman-Vernon influence functionals (IF). The IF are represented as
matrix-product states in the temporal domain, which enables an efficient
computation of dynamics for arbitrary interactions. We apply our method to
study quantum quenches and transport in an Anderson impurity model, including
highly non-equilibrium setups, and find favorable performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The computational resources required for an accurate
computation of dynamics scale polynomially with evolution time, indicating that
a broad class of out-of-equilibrium quantum impurity problems are efficiently
solvable. This approach will provide new insights into dynamical properties of
mesoscopic devices and correlated materials.

<br>
<br>
Topological insulators host gapless boundary states that are protected by
time-reversal symmetry against local perturbations. When incorporated into a
Josephson junction, the system is predicted to demonstrate the fractional
Josephson effect with a 4$\pi$-periodic current-phase relation. Here, we use an
asymmetric SQUID device to study the current-phase relation of a Josephson
junction formed by the higher-order topological insulator WTe$_2$. The measured
critical current seems to demonstrate a 4$\pi$ periodic current-phase relation.
A closer inspection, however, reveals that the data is strongly affected by
inductance effects that give rise to a multivalued critical current. Further,
we model our data by maximizing the supercurrent in the SQUID loop and find the
1.5 $\mu$m long junction is best described in the short ballistic limit. Our
results highlight the complexity of inductance effects that can give rise to
misleading topological signatures in transport measurements.

Porous materials possess numerous useful functions because of their high
surface area and ability to modulate the transport of heat, mass, fluids, and
electromagnetic waves. Unlike highly ordered structures, disordered porous
structures offer the advantages of ease of fabrication and high fault
tolerance. Bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels (bijels) are
kinetically trapped disordered biphasic materials that can be converted to
porous materials with tunable features. Current methods of bijel fabrication
result in domains that are micrometers or larger, and non-uniform in size,
limiting their surface area, mechanical strength, and interaction with
electromagnetic waves. In this work, scalable synthesis of bijels with uniform
and sub-micrometer domains is achieved via a two-step solvent removal process.
The resulting bijels are characterized quantitatively to verify the uniformity
and sub-micrometer scale of the domains. Moreover, these bijels have structures
that resemble the microstructure of the scale of the white beetle Cyphochilus.
We find that such bijel films with relatively small thicknesses (< 150 um)
exhibit strong solar reflectance as well as high brightness and whiteness in
the visible range. Considering their scalability in manufacturing, we believe
that VIPS-STRIPS bijels have great potential in large-scale applications
including passive cooling, solar cells, and light emitting diodes (LEDs).

Recently, the hexagonal phase of ternary transition metal pnictides TT'X (T =
Zr, Hf; T'= Ru; X = P, As), which are well-known noncentrosymmetric
superconductors, were predicted to host nontrivial bulk topology. In this work,
we systematically investigate the electronic responses of ZrRuAs to external
pressure. At ambient pressure, ZrRuAs show superconductivity with Tc ~ 7.74 K,
while a large upper critical field ~ 13.03 T is obtained for ZrRuAs, which is
comparable to the weak-coupling Pauli limit. The resistivity of ZrRuAs exhibits
a non-monotonic evolution with increasing pressure. The superconducting
transition temperature Tc increases with applied pressure and reaches a maximum
value of 7.93 K at 2.1 GPa, followed by a decrease. The nontrivial topology is
robust and persists up to the high-pressure regime. Considering both robust
superconductivity and intriguing topology in this material, our results could
contribute to studies of the interplay between topological electronic states
and superconductivity.

The quasi-one-dimensional material PdTeI exhibits unusual electronic
transport properties at ambient pressure. Here, we systematically investigate
both the structural and electronic responses of PdTeI to external pressure,
through a combination of electrical transport, synchrotron x-ray diffraction
(XRD), and Raman spectroscopy measurements. The charge density wave (CDW) order
in PdTeI is fragile and the transition temperature TCDW decreases rapidly with
the application of external pressure. The resistivity hump is indiscernible
when the pressure is increased to 1 GPa. Upon further compression, zero
resistance is established above 20 GPa, suggesting the occurrence of
superconductivity. Combined XRD and Raman data evidence that the emergence of
superconductivity is accompanied by a pressure-induced amorphization of PdTeI.

We present an exactly solvable effective model of a double quantum dot
coupled to superconducting leads. This model is a generalization of the
well-known superconducting atomic limit approximation of the paradigmatic
superconducting impurity Anderson model. However, in contrast to the standard
atomic limit, and other effective models, it gives quantitatively correct
predictions for the quantum phase transition boundaries, subgap bound states as
well as Josephson supercurrent in a broad range of parameters including
experimentally relevant regimes. The model allows fast and reliable parameter
scans important for preparation and analysis of experiments which are otherwise
inaccessible by more precise but computational heavy methods such as quantum
Monte Carlo or the numerical renormalization group. The scans also allowed us
to identify and investigate new previously unnoticed phase diagram regimes. We
provide a thorough analysis of the strengths and limitations of the effective
model and benchmark its predictions against numerical renormalization group
results.

We study the blast generated by sudden localized release of energy in a cold
gas. Specifically, we consider one-dimensional hard-rod gas and two-dimensional
hard disc gas. For this problem, the Taylor- von Neumann-Sedov (TvNS) solution
of Euler equations has a self-similar form. The shock wave remains infinitely
strong for the zero-temperature gas, so the solution applies indefinitely. The
TvNS solution ignores dissipation, however. We show that this is erroneous in
the core region expanding as $t^{2/5}$ in two dimensions; the shock wave
propagates as $t^{1/2}$ in 2D. A new self-similar solution depending on the
scaling variable $r/t^{2/5}$ describes the core, while the TvNS solution
describes the bulk. We demonstrate this from a numerical solution of the
Navier-Stokes (NS) equations and from molecular dynamics simulations. The shock
front position predicted by NS equations for 2D hard discs does not agree with
that predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. The NS equations also fail to
describe the near-core behavior. Surprisingly, for hard rods the shock front
predicted by the NS solution matches with that predicted by molecular dynamics.

We introduce a method for global optimization of the structure of atomic
systems that uses additional atoms with fractional existence. The method allows
for movement of atoms over long distances bypassing energy barriers encountered
in the conventional position space. The method is based on Gaussian processes,
where the extrapolation to fractional existence is performed with a vectorial
fingerprint. The method is applied to clusters and two-dimensional systems,
where the fractional existence variables are optimized while keeping the atomic
positions fixed on a lattice. Simultaneous optimization of atomic coordinates
and existence variables is demonstrated on copper clusters of varying size. The
existence variables are shown to speed up the global optimization of large and
particularly difficult-to-optimize clusters.

<h3>Orbital-ordered ferromagnetic insulating state in tensile-strained  SrCoO$_{3}$ thin films</h3>

At ambient pressure, bulk SrCoO$_{3}$ is a ferromagnetic (FM) metal in cubic
perovskite structure. By contrast, magnetic properties of epitaxial SrCoO$_{3}$
thin films, especially at high tensile strain ($\varepsilon \gtrsim 3$\%),
remain unclear: Previous calculations had predicted antiferromagnetic (AFM)
states more energetically favorable in this regime, but recent experiments
indicated a FM insulating state. In this work, using first-principles
calculations, we perform an extensive search for the structural, spin,
magnetic, and orbital states of SrCoO$_{3}$ thin films. Our calculations
indicate that at $0 < \varepsilon \lesssim 2.5$\%, SrCoO$_{3}$ favors a FM
half-metallic state with intermediate-spin ($t_{2g}^{5}e_{g}^{1}$-like) Co
exhibiting $d^{6}\underline L$ character. At $\varepsilon \gtrsim 2.5$\%, a FM
insulating state with high-spin ($t_{2g}^{4}e_{g}^{2}$-like) Co dominates. This
FM insulating state is achieved via complicated orbital ordering, cooperative
Jahn--Teller distortion, and octahedral tilting about all three crystal axes.

We demonstrate a combination of computational tools and experimental 4D-STEM
methods to image the local magnetic moment in antiferromagnetic Fe$_2$As with 6
angstrom spatial resolution. Our techniques utilize magnetic diffraction peaks,
common in antiferromagnetic materials, to create imaging modes that directly
visualize the magnetic lattice. Using this approach, we show that
center-of-mass analysis can determine the local magnetization component in the
plane perpendicular to the path of the electron beam. Moreover, we develop
Magnstem, a quantum mechanical electron scattering simulation code, to model
electron scattering of an angstrom-scale probe from magnetic materials. Using
these tools, we identify optimal experimental conditions for separating weak
magnetic signals from the much stronger interactions of an angstrom-scale probe
with electrostatic potentials. Our techniques should be useful for
characterizing the local magnetic order in systems such in thin films,
interfaces, and domain boundaries of antiferromagnetic materials, which are
difficult to probe with existing methods.

The exposure to intense electromagnetic radiation can induce distortions and
symmetry breaking in the crystal structure of solids, providing a route for the
all-optical control of their properties. In this manuscript, we formulate a
unified theoretical approach to describe the coherent lattice dynamics in
presence of external driving fields, electron-phonon and phonon-phonon
interactions, and quantum nuclear effects. The main mechanisms for the
excitation of coherent phonons - including infrared absorption, displacive
excitation, inelastic stimulated Raman scattering, and ionic Raman scattering -
can be seamlessly accounted for. We apply this formalism to a model consisting
of two coupled phonon modes, where we illustrate the influence of quantum
nuclei on structural distortions induced by ionic Raman scattering. Besides
validating the widely-employed classical models for the coherent lattice
dynamics, our work provides a versatile approach to methodically explore the
emergence of quantum nuclear effects in the structural response of crystal
lattice to strong fields.

Protected surface states arising from non-trivial bandstructure topology in
semimetals can potentially enable new device functionalities in compute,
memory, interconnect, sensing, and communication. This necessitates a
fundamental understanding of surface-state transport in nanoscale topological
semimetals. Here, we investigate quantum transport in a prototypical
topological semimetal NbAs to evaluate the potential of this class of materials
for beyond-Cu interconnects in highly-scaled integrated circuits. Using density
functional theory (DFT) coupled with non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF)
calculations, we shows that the resistance-area $RA$ product in NbAs films
decreases with decreasing thickness at the nanometer scale, in contrast to a
nearly constant $RA$ product in ideal Cu films. This anomalous scaling
originates from the disproportionately large number of surface conduction
states which dominate the ballistic conductance by up to 70$\%$ in NbAs thin
films. We also show that this favorable $RA$ scaling persists even in the
presence of surface defects, in contrast to $RA$ sharply increasing with
reducing thickness for films of conventional metals, such as Cu, in the
presence of surface defects. These results underscore the promise of
topological semimetals like NbAs as future back-end-of-line (BEOL) interconnect
metals.

<h3>Real time evolution of Anderson impurity models via tensor network  influence functionals</h3>

In this work we present and analyze two tensor network-based influence
functional approaches for simulating the real-time dynamics of quantum impurity
models such as the Anderson model. Via comparison with recent numerically exact
simulations, we show that such methods accurately capture the long-time
non-equilibrium quench dynamics. The two parameters that must be controlled in
these tensor network influence functional approaches are a time discretization
(Trotter) error and a bond dimension (tensor network truncation) error. We show
that the actual numerical uncertainties are controlled by an intricate
interplay of these two approximations which we demonstrate in different
regimes. Our work opens the door to using these tensor network influence
functional methods as general impurity solvers.
