<i>Wen-Bin Pan, Ya-Wen Sun</i>
<p>We show that a reference frame transformation could turn a topologically
trivial Dirac fermion into a topologically nontrivial Weyl semimetal. This is
elucidated by the transformation of the Dirac equation into the equation for
Weyl semimetals through specific infinitesimal local Lorentz transformations of
the orthonormal basis. This kind of transformation, interpreted as a change of
reference frame, could induce an observational effect that an axial gauge field
and/or a vector U(1) gauge field appears effectively, which are in fact
inertial forces in the non-inertial frame.The precise local Lorentz
transformations and the movement of observers needed to realize the two
additional fields are provided respectively. This novel effect can be viewed as
a generalization of the effect found in relativistic hydrodynamics that
topologically trivial modes in an inertial frame could become topologically
nontrivial observed by a special non-inertial observer.

<h3>Monte Carlo solver and renormalization of Migdal-Eliashberg spin chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12094" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12094</a>
<br>
<i>Yang-Zhi Chou, Zhentao Wang, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<p>Motivated by the recently developed classical spin model for
Migdal-Eliashberg theory, we develop new numerical and analytical methods based
on this spin-chain representation and apply these methods to the
Bogoliuov-Tomachov-Morel-Anderson pairing potential, which incorporates the
phonon-mediated attraction and Coulomb repulsion. We show that the Monte Carlo
method with heat bath updates can efficiently obtain the gap functions even for
the situations challenging for the iterative solvers, suggesting an
unprecedented robust approach for solving the full nonlinear Migdal-Eliashberg
theory. Moreover, we derive the renormalization of all the couplings by tracing
out the high-frequency spins in the partition function. The derived analytical
renormalization equations produce the well-known $\mu^*$ effect for the
Bogoliuov-Tomachov-Morel-Anderson pairing potential and can be generalized to
other superconductivity problems. We further point out that several interesting
features (e.g., sign changing in the frequency-dependent gap function) can be
intuitively understood using the classical spin-chain representation for
Migdal-Eliasherg theory. Our results show the advantage of using the spin-chain
representation for solving Migdal-Eliashberg theory and provide new ways for
tackling general superconductivity problems.

<h3>Emergent Ashkin-Teller criticality in a constrained boson model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12107" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12107</a>
<br>
<i>Anirudha Menon, Anwesha Chattopadhyay, K. Sengupta, Arnab Sen</i>
<p>We show, via explicit computation on a constrained bosonic model, that the
presence of subsystem symmetries can lead to a quantum phase transition where
the critical point exhibits an emergent enhanced symmetry. Such a transition
separates a unique gapped ground state from a gapless one; the latter phase
exhibits a broken $Z_2$ symmetry which we tie to the presence of the subsystem
symmetries in the model. The intermediate critical point separating these
phases exhibits an additional emergent $Z_2$ symmetry which we identify; this
emergence leads to a critical theory in the Ashkin-Teller, instead of the
expected Ising, universality class . We verify this scenario via explicit
exact-diagonalization computations, provide an effective Landau-Ginzburg theory
for such a transition, and discuss the connection of our model to the PXP model
describing Rydberg atom arrays.

<h3>Non-conservation of the orbital moment of Bloch electrons in an electric  field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12108" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12108</a>
<br>
<i>Rhonald Burgos Atencia, Dimitrie Culcer</i>
<p>The orbital moment (OM) of Bloch electrons has witnessed a surge in interest
in out-of--equilibrium systems. Here, by developing a quantum kinetic theory,
we show that the OM is in general not conserved in an electric field. The force
moment produces a torque on the OM, which is determined by the quantum
geometric tensor and the group velocities of Bloch bands. The torque vanishes
in two-band systems with particle-hole symmetry, but is nonzero otherwise. For
tilted massive Dirac fermions the torque is determined by the magnitude and
direction of the tilt.

<h3>Interface probe for antiferromagnets using geometric curvature</h3>

<br>
<i>Tancredi Salamone, Magnus Skj√¶rpe, Henning G. Hugdal, Morten Amundsen, Sol H. Jacobsen</i>
<p>We propose that geometric curvature and torsion may be used to probe the
quality of an uncompensated antiferromagnetic interface, using the proximity
effect. We study a helix of antiferromagnetic wire coupled to a conventional
superconductor, and show that a density of states measurement can give
information about the quality of an uncompensated interface, crucial for many
recently predicted antiferromagnetic proximity effects. Furthermore, we show
that geometric curvature alone can result in long-ranged superconducting
triplet correlations in the antiferromagnet, and we discuss the impact
curvature and torsion can have on the future development of superconducting
spintronic devices.

<h3>Non-volatile electrical polarization switching via domain wall release  in 3R-MoS$_2$ bilayer</h3>

<i>Dongyang Yang, Jing Liang, Jingda Wu, Yunhuan Xiao, Jerry I. Dadap, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ziliang Ye</i>
<p>Understanding the nature of sliding ferroelectricity is of fundamental
importance for the discovery and application of two-dimensional ferroelectric
materials. In this work, we investigate the phenomenon of switchable
polarization in a bilayer MoS$_2$ with a natural rhombohedral stacking, where
the spontaneous polarization is coupled with excitonic effects through an
asymmetric interlayer coupling. Using optical spectroscopy and imaging
techniques, we observe how a released domain wall switches the polarization of
a large single domain. Our results highlight the importance of domain walls in
the polarization switching of non-twisted rhombohedral transition metal
dichalcogenides and open new opportunities for the non-volatile control of
their optical response.

<h3>First principles residual resistivity using locally self-consistent  multiple scattering method</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12134" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12134</a>
<br>
<i>Vishnu Raghuraman, Markus Eisenbach, Michael Widom, Yang Wang</i>
<p>The locally self-consistent multiple scattering (LSMS) method can perform
efficient first-principles calculations of systems with large number of atoms.
In this work, we combine the Kubo-Greenwood equation with LSMS, enabling us to
calculate first-principles residual resistivity of large systems. This has been
implemented in the open-source code lsms. We apply this method to selected pure
elements and binary random alloys. The results compare well with experiment,
and with values obtained from a first-principles effective medium technique
(KKR-CPA). We discuss future applications of this method to complex systems
where other methods are not applicable.

<h3>A One-Dimensional Electron Gas Coupled to Light</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12160" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12160</a>
<br>
<i>Victor Bradley, Kamal Sharma, Mohammad Hafezi, Wade DeGottardi</i>
<p>The prospect of using light to probe or manipulate quantum materials has
become an active area of interest. Here, we investigate a quantum wire --
treated as a finite-sized one-dimensional electron gas -- that is coupled to a
single photonic mode. This work focuses on the radiative properties of the wire
when it is prepared in some excited state. One of our key results addresses the
photon cascade initiated by the creation of a single electron-hole pair.
Repeated photon emission leads to the generation of entanglement between the
electron and hole and the emission rates exhibit Dicke-like superradiance. In
general, the radiation is characterized by a competition between superradiance
and Pauli blocking. We find that the one-dimensional electron gas represents an
ideal system for investigating quantum coherent phenomena and quantum
entanglement. This work has direct relevance to applications in quantum
computation and quantum transduction.

<p>Topological protection ensures stability of information and particle
transport against perturbations. We explore experimentally and computationally
the topologically protected transport of magnetic colloids above spatially
inhomogeneous magnetic patterns, revealing that transport complexity can be
encoded in both the driving loop and the pattern. Complex patterns support
intricate transport modes when the microparticles are subjected to simple
time-periodic loops of a uniform magnetic field. We design a pattern featuring
a topological defect that functions as an attractor or a repeller of
microparticles, as well as a pattern that directs microparticles along a
prescribed complex trajectory. Using simple patterns and complex loops, we
simultaneously and independently control the motion of several identical
microparticles differing only in their positions above the pattern. Combining
complex patterns and complex loops we transport microparticles from unknown
locations to predefined positions and then force them to follow arbitrarily
complex trajectories concurrently. Our findings pave the way for new avenues in
transport control and dynamic self-assembly in colloidal science.

<h3>Materials for Fusion Energy: Key Challenges and Guiding Principles for  Developing Under High Design Uncertainty</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12187" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12187</a>
<br>
<i>David Cohen-Tanugi, Myles G. Stapelberg, Michael P. Short, Sara E. Ferry, Dennis G. Whyte, Zachary S. Hartwig, Tonio Buonassisi</i>
<p>Fusion energy is at an important inflection point in its development:
multiple government agencies and private companies are now planning fusion
pilot plants to deliver electricity to the grid in the next decade. However,
realizing fusion as a technically and economically viable energy source depends
on developing and qualifying materials that can withstand the extreme
environment inside a fusion power plant. This Perspective seeks to engage the
materials science community in this effort. We first outline the principal
materials challenges and research opportunities for fusion. Next, we argue that
fusion is distinct from other energy applications with respect to materials,
not just in the magnitude and complexity of the technical challenges but also
in the present level of uncertainty in materials design requirements. To
address this, we finally propose a research framework based on an iterative
co-evolution of materials science and fusion power plant design requirements.

<h3>Correlation Effects in a Trapped Bose-Fermi Mixture: Exact Results</h3>

<i>Ofir E. Alon, Lorenz S. Cederbaum</i>
<p>Many-body properties of a fermionic impurity embedded in a Bose-Einstein
condensate are analyzed analytically using a solvable model, the
harmonic-interaction model for Bose-Fermi mixtures. The one-particle and
two-particle densities, reduced density matrices, and correlation functions of
the fermions and bosons, both in position and momentum spaces, are prescribed
in closed form. The various coherence lengths are analyzed. We show that the
first-order coherence lengths in position and momentum spaces are equal whereas
the second-order quantities can differ substantially. Illustrative examples
where the sole interaction is between the impurity and the condensate are
presented. Implications are briefly discussed.

<h3>Hydrogen-induced tunable remanent polarization in a perovskite nickelate</h3>

<p>Materials with field-tunable polarization are of broad interest to condensed
matter sciences and solid-state device technologies. Here, using hydrogen (H)
donor doping, we modify the room temperature metallic phase of a perovskite
nickelate NdNiO3 into an insulating phase with both metastable dipolar
polarization and space-charge polarization. We then demonstrate transient
negative differential capacitance in thin film capacitors. The space-charge
polarization caused by long-range movement and trapping of protons dominates
when the electric field exceeds the threshold value. First-principles
calculations suggest the polarization originates from the polar structure
created by H doping. We find that polarization decays within ~1 second which is
an interesting temporal regime for neuromorphic computing hardware design, and
we implement the transient characteristics in a neural network to demonstrate
unsupervised learning. These discoveries open new avenues for designing novel
ferroelectric materials and electrets using light-ion doping.

<h3>Revealing the three-state nematicity in atomically-thin  antiferromagnetic NiPS3 via magneto-optical effect</h3>

<i>Qishuo Tan, Connor A. Occhialini, Hongze Gao, Jiaruo Li, Hikari Kitadai, Riccardo Comin, Xi Ling</i>
<p>Nickel phosphorus trisulfide (NiPS3), a van der Waals (vdW) 2D
antiferromagnet, has captivated enormous attention for its intriguing physics
in recent years. However, despite the fundamental importance of magnetic
domains for applications such as antiferromagnetic spintronics, the study of
magnetic domains in NiPS3 down to atomically thin samples is still lacking.
Here, we report the layer-dependent magnetic characteristics and magnetic
domains within antiferromagnetic NiPS3 by employing linear dichroism (LD)
combined with polarized microscopy, spin-correlated photoluminescence (PL), and
Raman spectroscopy. Our observations reveal that the
paramagnetic-to-antiferromagnetic phase transition is evident from bilayer to
bulk NiPS3 samples, whereas it is absent in the monolayer. Furthermore, our
study identifies three distinct antiferromagnetic domains and delves into the
domain evolution within atomically-thin NiPS3. Our discovery provides crucial
insights for the development of antiferromagnetic spintronics and related
technologies.

<h3>Bulk photovoltaic effect in antiferromagnet: Role of collective spin  dynamics</h3>

<br>
<i>Junta Iguchi, Hikaru Watanabe, Yuta Murakami, Takuya Nomoto, Ryotaro Arita</i>
<p>Inspired by recent advancements in the bulk photovoltaic effect which can
extend beyond the independent particle approximation (IPA), this study delves
into the influence of collective spin dynamics in an antiferromagnetic on
photocurrent generation using a time domain calculation. In the linear and
photocurrent conductivity spectra, we observe peaks below the bandgap regime,
attributed to the resonant contributions of collective modes, alongside
broadband modifications resulting from off-resonant spin dynamics. Notably, the
emergence of spin dynamics allows various types of photocurrent, which are
absent in the IPA framework. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of energy
scale proximity between electronic and spin degrees of freedom in enabling
efficient feedback between them. These findings offer new avenues for efficient
energy harvesting and optoelectronic applications.

<h3>Spinon heat transport in the three-dimensional quantum magnet  PbCuTe$_2$O$_6$</h3>

<br>
<i>Xiaochen Hong, Matthias Gillig, Abanoub R. N. Hanna, Shravani Chillal, A. T. M. Nazmul Islam, Bella Lake, Bernd B√ºchner, Christian Hess</i>
<p>Quantum spin liquids (QSL) are novel phases of matter which remain quantum
disordered even at the lowest temperature. They are characterized by emergent
gauge fields and fractionalized quasiparticles. Here we show that the
sub-Kelvin thermal transport of the three-dimensional $S=1/2$ hyper-hyperkagome
quantum magnet PbCuTe$_2$O$_6$ is governed by a sizeable charge-neutral
fermionic contribution which is compatible with the itinerant fractionalized
excitations of a spinon Fermi surface. We demonstrate that this hallmark
feature of the QSL state is remarkably robust against sample crystallinity,
large magnetic field, and field-induced magnetic order, ruling out the
imitation of QSL features by extrinsic effects. Our findings thus reveal the
characteristic low-energy features of PbCuTe$_2$O$_6$ which qualify this
compound as a true QSL material.

<h3>Electron irradiation reveals robust fully gapped superconductivity in  LaNiGa$_{2}$</h3>

<p>The effects of 2.5 MeV electron irradiation were studied in the
superconducting phase of single crystals of LaNiGa$_2$, using measurements of
electrical transport and radio-frequency magnetic susceptibility. The London
penetration depth is found to vary exponentially with temperature, suggesting a
fully gapped Fermi surface. The inferred superfluid density is close to that of
a single-gap weak-coupling isotropic $s-$wave superconductor. Superconductivity
is extremely robust against nonmagnetic point-like disorder induced by electron
irradiation. Our results place strong constraints on the previously proposed
triplet pairing state by requiring fine-tuned impurity scattering amplitudes
and are most naturally explained by a sign-preserving, weak-coupling, and
approximately momentum independent singlet superconducting state in LaNiGa$_2$,
which does not break time-reversal symmetry. We discuss how our findings could
be reconciled with previous measurements indicating magnetic moments in the
superconducting phase.

<h3>Crystal Nucleation in an AlNiZr Metallic Liquid: Within and Beyond  Classical Nucleation Theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12237" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12237</a>
<br>
<i>Fangzheng Chen, Kian Cole Dahlberg, Zohar Nussinov, K. F. Kelton</i>
<p>The Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT) has played a key role in crystal
nucleation studies since the 19th century and has significantly advanced the
understanding of nucleation. However, certain key assumptions of CNT, such as a
compact and spherical nucleating cluster and the concept of individual
diffusive jumps are questionable. The results of molecular dynamics (MD)
studies of crystal nucleation in a Al20Ni60Zr20 metallic liquid demonstrate
that the nucleating cluster is neither spherical nor compact. The seeding
method was employed to determine the critical cluster size and nucleation
parameters from CNT, which were then compared to those derived from the Mean
First Passage Time (MFPT) method. While the CNT-based nucleation rate aligns
well with experimental data from similar metallic liquids, the MFPT rate
differs significantly. Further, contrary to the assumption of individual jumps
for atoms to join the nucleating cluster, a cooperative mechanism of attachment
or detachment is observed. This is accompanied by synchronized changes in the
local potential energy. Similar cooperative motion also appeared in a
non-classical nucleation process, particularly during the coalescence of
nuclei.

<br>
<i>M. Dahlenburg, G. Pagnini</i>
<p>We derive a Sturm-Liouville system of equations for the exact calculation of
the survival probability in first-passage time problems. This system is the one
associated with the Wiener-Hopf integral equation obtained from the theory of
random walks. The derived approach is an alternative to the existing literature
and we tested it against direct calculations from both discrete- and
continuous-time random walks in a manageable, but meaningful, example. Within
this framework, the Sparre Andersen theorem results to be a boundary condition
for the system.

<p>Effective control and readout of qubits form the technical foundation of
next-generation, transformative quantum information sciences and technologies.
The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, an intrinsic three-level spin system, is
naturally relevant in this context due to its excellent quantum coherence, high
fidelity of operations, and remarkable functionality over a broad range of
experimental conditions. It is an active contender for the development and
implementation of cutting-edge quantum technologies. Here, we report magnetic
domain wall motion driven local control and measurements of NV spin properties.
By engineering the local magnetic field environment of an NV center via
nanoscale reconfigurable domain wall motions, we show that NV
photoluminescence, spin level energies, and coherence time can be reliably
controlled and correlated to the magneto-transport response of a magnetic
device. Our results highlight the electrically tunable dipole interaction
between NV centers and nanoscale magnetic structures, providing an attractive
platform to realize interactive information transfer between spin qubits and
non-volatile magnetic memory in hybrid quantum spintronic systems.

<h3>Approximating Maximally Localized Wannier Functions with Position  Scaling-Eigenfunction</h3>

<i>Yuji Hamai, Katsunori Wakabayashi</i>
<p>Position scaling-eigenfunctions are generated by transforming compactly
supported orthonormal scaling functions and utilized for faster alternatives to
maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs). The position
scaling-eigenfunctions are first applied to numerical procedures solving
Schr\"odinger and Maxwell's equations, and the solutions well agree with
preceding results. Subsequently, by projecting the position
scaling-eigenfunctions onto the space spanned by the Bloch functions,
approximated MLWFs are obtained. They show good agreements with preceding
results using MLWFs. In addition, analytical explanations of the agreements and
an estimate of the error associated with the approximation are provided.

<h3>Geometric Characterization of Many Body Localization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12280" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12280</a>
<br>
<i>W. N. Faugno, Tomoki Ozawa</i>
<p>Many body localization (MBL) represents a unique physical phenomenon,
providing a testing ground for exploring thermalization, or more precisely its
failure. Here we characterize the MBL phase geometrically by the many-body
quantum metric (MBQM), defined in the parameter space of twist boundary. We
find that MBQM scales linearly as a function of the inverse system length in
the MBL phase, and grows faster in the ergodic phase. We validate our theory
using the disordered hardcore Bose-Hubbard model, and characterize the ergodic
to MBL phase transition via the localization length scale defined from the
MBQM. MBQM provides an intuitive and experimentally accessible method to
characterize MBL phases.

<h3>Electronic Structure of Ta$_2$O$_5$ Polymorphs: Variation Trend of Band  Gap and the Role of Oxygen Vacancies</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12285" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12285</a>
<br>
<i>Hui-Min Tang, Yong Yang</i>
<p>We provide a systematic study on the electronic structure of a series of
Ta$_2$O$_5$ polymorphs using standard density functional theory (DFT)
calculations as well as the more accurate many-body perturbation theory within
the GW approximation. For the defect-free polymorphs, the variation trend of
band gap can be microscopically related to the strength of orbital
hybridization, and to the macroscopic bulk formation energy. The presence of
oxygen vacancies is found to have profound effects on the electronic properties
near the Fermi level, notably the reduction of band gap and gap closure
(insulator-to-metal transition). Furthermore, depending on the vacancy sites,
the band gap of some defective system may be enlarged with comparison to its
defect-free counterpart. Such an anomalous behavior originates from the
unexpected formation of Ta-Ta bonds.

<h3>Detecting subtle macroscopic changes in a finite temperature classical  scalar field with machine learning</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12303" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12303</a>
<br>
<i>Jiming Yang, Yutong Zheng, Jiahong Zhou, Huiyu Li, Jun Yin</i>
<p>The ability to detect macroscopic changes is important for probing the
behaviors of experimental many-body systems from the classical to the quantum
realm. Although abrupt changes near phase boundaries can easily be detected,
subtle macroscopic changes are much more difficult to detect as the changes can
be obscured by noise. In this study, as a toy model for detecting subtle
macroscopic changes in many-body systems, we try to differentiate scalar field
samples at varying temperatures. We compare different methods for making such
differentiations, from physics method, statistics method, to AI method. Our
finding suggests that the AI method outperforms both the statistical method and
the physics method in its sensitivity. Our result provides a proof-of-concept
that AI can potentially detect macroscopic changes in many-body systems that
elude physical measures.

<h3>Deciphering Non-Gaussianity of Diffusion Based on the Evolution of  Diffusivity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12317" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12317</a>
<br>
<i>Haolan Xu, Xu Zheng, Xinghua Shi</i>
<p>Non-Gaussianity indicates complex dynamics related to extreme events or
significant outliers. However, the correlation between non-Gaussianity and the
dynamics of heterogeneous environments in anomalous diffusion remains
uncertain. Inspired by a recent study by Alexandre et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett.
130, 077101 (2023)], we demonstrate that non-Gaussianity can be deciphered
through the spatiotemporal evolution of heterogeneity-dependent diffusivity.
Using diffusion experiments in a linear temperature field and Brownian dynamics
simulations, we found that short- and long-time non-Gaussianity can be
predicted based on diffusivity distribution. Non-Gaussianity variation is
determined by an effective P\'eclet number (a ratio of the varying rate of
diffusivity to the diffusivity of diffusivity), which clarifies whether the
tail distribution expands or contracts. The tail is more Gaussian than
exponential over long times, with exceptions significantly dependent on the

<p>Commensurability phenomena abound in nature and are typically associated with
mismatched lengths, as can occur in quasiperiodic systems. However, not all
commensuration effects are spatial in nature. In finite-sized Dirac systems, an
intriguing example arises in tilted or warped Dirac cones wherein the
degeneracy in the speed of right- and left-moving electrons within a given
Dirac cone or valley is lifted. Bound states can be purely fast-moving or
purely slow-moving, giving rise to incommensurate energy level spacings and a
vernier spectrum. In this work, we present evidence for this vernier spectrum
in Coulomb blockade measurements of ultraclean suspended carbon nanotube
quantum dots. The addition-energy spectrum of the quantum dots reveals an
energy-level structure that oscillates between aligned and misaligned energy
levels. Our data suggest that the fast- and slow-moving bound states hybridize
at certain gate voltages. Thus, gate-voltage tuning can select states with
varying degrees of hybridization, suggesting numerous applications based on
accessing this isospin-like degree of freedom.

<p>We study extremely nonequilibrium transport in correlated kagome magnet
Mn$_3$Sn by time-resolved terahertz Faraday rotation spectroscopy. When the
photoinjected carrier density exceeds $\sim$10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$, a cyclotron
resonance is clearly observed, signifying the emergence of unusual carriers
with 2000-times higher mobility than those in equilibrium. The result can be
attributed to a drastic change in the band structure owing to screening of the
electron correlation, highlighting the significant role of many-body effects in
this kagome compound in equilibrium. Our study opens up a new phase of
transport properties in correlated kagome materials under highly nonequilibrium

<h3>Enhanced sensitivity of partial O-terminated H-diamond for H2S detection  at room temperature</h3>

<i>N. Mohasin Sulthana, K. Ganesan, P.K. Ajikumar</i>
<p>The p-type surface conductivity of H-terminated diamond (HD) has opened new
path ways to develop diamond based electronic devices, photo-catalysts,
chemical and bio-sensors. Herein, we report on the room temperature H2S
detection behaviour of pristine HD and the surface modified HD films with
partial O-termination (OHD) through ozonation. The response of the pristine HD
and partial OHD devices that are ozonated for 30, 60 and 90 s, is found to be ~
55, 1420, 810 and 95 % respectively, for exposing 900 ppb of H2S under ambient
atmosphere at room temperature. Here, the optimally partial OHD sensor displays
an enhanced sensitivity by about an order of magnitude due to the catalytic
activity of the sparsely populated O-functional groups on HD surface. Moreover,
the gas sensor response is found to be higher in wet background atmospheres
such as N2 and synthetic air as compared to their respective dry atmospheres.
Also, the response curve of these sensors exhibits a peculiar decrease in
resistance immediately after exposure to H2S under wet background atmosphere
while such oxidative behaviour is absent under dry atmospheres. Based on these
observations, the plausible sensing mechanism of these H-diamond based sensors
is proposed with the concept of humidity induced H2S hydrolyzation.

<br>
<i>Ma Luo</i>
<p>We theoretically studied the Floquet state of gated bilayer graphene, which
is irradiated by normally incident focused Gaussian beam with orbital angular
momentum (OAM). According to the Floquet theory, in-plane and out-of-plane
electric field of the OAM beam periodically perturbs the intralayer and
interlayer hopping, which are equivalent to the presence of effective staggered
sublattice potential and next-nearest neighboring interlayer hopping within the
light spot region, respectively. The combination of the effective terms and the
gated voltage form an effective trapping potential, which hosts localized
quantum states with energy level being within the energy gap of the
non-irradiated gated bilayer graphene. The energy spectrum can be tuned by the
amplitude of the optical beam and additional static magnetic field. By
engineering the parameters, valley-polarized two-fold degenerated zero energy
Floquet states can be induced.

<p>Since the discoveries of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprate
superconductors, the attempts to understand their superconducting mechanism and
search for new high-temperature superconducting families have never been paused
in over three decades. Recently, the signatures of superconductivity near 80 K
have been discovered in the single crystal of La3Ni2O7 under pressure, which
makes it a new candidate of the high-temperature superconductors dominated by
3d transition elements after the cuprate and iron-pnictide superconductors, and
has attracted significant attention. However, the superconductivity,
characterized by the zero resistance and the Meissner effect, is anomalously
irreproducible in La3Ni2O7. In this study, we report the experimental results
obtained from highly sensitive ac susceptibility measurements, which reveal
that the maximum superconducting volume fraction in the La3Ni2O7 sample is
approximately 1%. In tandem with the observation of the zero-resistance state
only in some of the samples, we suggest that the superconductivity in this
nickelate is filamentary-like. Furthermore, from the high-pressure Hall
coefficient (RH) measurements, we find that RH remains positive under pressure
up to 28.8 GPa but displays a significant change in RH(P) at the critical
pressure of about 10 GPa, where the superconductivity emerges, highlighting the
crucial role of hole-carrier enhancement in boosting the superconductivity in
La3Ni2O7. Our results provide new insights into understanding the puzzling
questions of the high-Tc superconductivity emerging from this complex system
and a clue for exploring new high-Tc superconducting materials in 3d transition
metal compounds.

<h3>Spin-valley Hall effects and pseudospin-1 system in transition-metal  dichalcogenides: three band model approach</h3>

<br>
<i>Phusit Nualpijit, Kitakorn Jatiyanon, Bumned Soodchomshom</i>
<p>The energy spectra of transition metal dichalcogenides are primarily
influenced by the and orbitals. This results in a three-band model
characterized by strong spin-orbit interaction. Investigating these bands using
a projection into a two-band model is adequate for exploring electronic and
optical properties. The topological phases, spin-valley Hall effect, derived
from spin-valley Chern numbers, are also examined. The inclusion of spin-orbit
interaction breaks inversion symmetry while maintaining time-reversal symmetry.
This leads to the non-zero spin-valley dependent Hall conductivities, pivotal
for both the spin Hall and valley Hall effects. These phenomena could have
applications beyond traditional electronics, potentially encoding quantum bits.
In particular, electrons at high-symmetry points, namely the K and K' points,
might behave as if they are in a pseudospin-1 system with spin angular momentum
of and , leading to triplet energy states. Such predictions could encourage
super-Klein tunneling, which might offer insights into Majorana fermions,
relevant for topological quantum computation.

<h3>Photothermoelectric and resistive self-mixing response contributions in  graphene field-effect transistor THz detectors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12382" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12382</a>
<br>
<i>Florian Ludwig, Andrey Generalov, Jakob Holstein, Anton Murros, Klaara Viisanen, Mika Prunnila, Hartmut G. Roskos</i>
<p>THz field-effect-transistor (TeraFET) devices are antenna coupled
photodetectors being actively developed for THz frequency range ({\S}\sim{\S}
100 GHz - 10 THz). In comparison to the ones build from elemental
semiconductors, graphene TeraFETs (G-TeraFETs) show some unique features in
their photoresponse. For example, there has been evidence that G-TeraFET THz
response consists of two components: the so-called resistive self-mixing (RSM)
and photothermoelectric effect (PTE) components arising from the THz field
induced charge density modulation and charge carrier heating, respectively. We
demonstrate explicitly that the response can be treated as a combination of RSM
and PTE and that the PTE response can become the dominant mechanism at high
frequencies. In our CVD G-TeraFETs asymmetrically coupled to the THz antenna
the PTE response starts to dominate over RSM above 100 GHz photon field
frequencies. By electromagnetic wave simulations, we show that this behavior is
a consequence of the relative change of the total dissipated THz power between
the gated and ungated area in the G-TeraFET. We also identify a new PTE
contribution that can be attributed to the Fermi level gradient due to the
graphene - metal contacts. Our detectors achieve a minimum optical
noise-equivalent power of 101 (114) pW/{\S}\sqrt{Hz}{\S} for asymmetric
(symmetric) THz antenna coupling conditions at 400 GHz. Our work shows how the
PTE response can be utilized in optimizing the THz responsivity of G-TeraFETs.

<p>Spin transport phenomena at strongly-correlated interfaces play central roles
in fundamental physics as well as spintronic applications. To anatomize
spin-transport carriers, we propose the detection of the spin current noise in
interacting itinerant fermions. The Fano factor given by the ratio between the
spin current and its noise reflects elementary carriers of spin transport at
the interface of spin-polarized Fermi gases realized in ultracold atoms. The
change of the Fano factor microscopically evinces a crossover from the
quasiparticle transport to magnon transport in itinerant fermionic systems.

<h3>Light bipolarons in a system of electrons coupled to dispersive optical  phonons</h3>

<br>
<i>K. Kovaƒç, J. Bonƒça</i>
<p>We investigate the ground state properties of the bipolaron coupled to
quantum dispersive optical phonons in the one-dimensional Holstein-Hubbard
model. We concentrate on the interplay between the phonon dispersion and the
Coulomb repulsion and their mutual effect on the bipolaron effective mass, the
binding energy, and the phase diagram. Most surprisingly, the sign of the
curvature of the optical phonon dispersion plays a decisive role on the
bipolaron binding energy in the presence of the Coulomb repulsion $U$. In
particular, when the sign of the phonon dispersion curvature matches the sign
of the electron dispersion curvature, the bipolaron remains bound in the strong
coupling limit even when $U\to \infty$ and the binding emanates from the
exchange of phonons between two electrons residing on adjacent sites. At
moderate electron-phonon coupling a light bipolaron exists up to large values
of $U$. Finally, an intuitive explanation of the role of the phonon dispersion
on the bipolaron binding energy is derived using the strong coupling limit
where the binding emanates from the exchange of phonons between two electrons
residing on adjacent sites which leads to enhanced stability of bipolarons at
elevated Coulomb repulsion.

<i>Eiji Shikoh, Yuichiro Onishi, Yoshio Teki</i>
<p>The spin relaxation time (tau) on the spin transport in thermally evaporated
thin films of a naphthyl diamine derivative: N, N'-Bis(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,
N'-bis(phenyl)-2,2'-dimethylbenzidine (a-NPD) was evaluated with the
spin-pump-induced spin transport properties and the electrical current-voltage
properties in a-NPD films. The zero-bias mobility and the diffusion constant of
charges in a-NPD films were obtained to be about 1.2*10-3 cm2/Vs and about
3.0*10-5 cm2/s, respectively. Using these values and the previously evaluated
spin diffusion length in a-NPD films of about 62 nm, the tau in a-NPD films was
estimated to be about 1.9 micro-second at room temperature, under an assumption
of diffusive transport of the spin current in a-NPD films. This estimated tau
in a-NPD films is long enough for practical use as a spintronic molecular
material.

<h3>Local resetting in non-conserving zero-range processes with extensive  rates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12414" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12414</a>
<br>
<i>Pascal Grange</i>
<p>We subject a non-conserving zero-range process with extensive creation,
annihilation and hopping rates to local resetting. The model is formulated on a
large, fully-connected network of states. The states are equipped with a
fitness level: particles are added to each state at a rate proportional to the
fitness level of the state. The fitness is bounded. Moreover, particles are
annihilated at a constant rate, and hop at a fixed rate to a uniformly-drawn
state in the network. This model has been interpreted in terms of population
dynamics: the fitness is the reproductive fitness in a haploid population, and
the hopping process models mutation. It has also been interpreted as a model of
network growth with a fixed set of nodes. If particles occupying a state are
interpreted as links pointing to this state, the fitness is the rate of
acquisition of links by states, and the hopping rate is the rewiring rate of
the network. In the absence of resetting, the model reaches a steady state,
which in a certain limit may exhibit a condensate at maximum fitness: this
behavior is a feature of the Kingman model in population dynamics and of the
Bianconi--Barab\'asi model of growing networks. The occupation numbers of each
state are reset to zero at independent random times. These times are
distributed according to a Poisson process whose rate (the resetting rate)
depends on the fitness. We derive the evolution equation satisfied by the
probability law of the occupation numbers, and calculate their average value in
the steady state. The existence of a condensate is found to depend on the local
behavior of the resetting rate at maximum fitness: if the resetting rate
vanishes at least linearly at high fitness, a condensate appears at maximum
fitness in the limit where the sum of the annihilation and hopping rates is
equal to the maximum fitness.

<h3>Autoencoder-assisted study of directed percolation with spatial  long-range interactions</h3>

<i>Yanyang Wang, Yuxiang Yang, Wei Li</i>
<p>Spatial L{\'{e}}vy-like flights are introduced as a way to absorbing phase
transitions to produce non-local interactions. We utilize the autoencoder, an
unsupervised learning method, to predict the critical points for $(1+1)$-d
directed percolation with such spatial long-range interactions. After making a
global coverage of the reaction-diffusion distance and taking a series of
different values for the parameter \;${\beta}$\; in the distribution
\;$P(r){\sim}1/r^{\beta}$\;, the critical points $P_c$ that can be continuously
varied are obtained. And the dynamic decay of the particle density under the
critical points was counted as a way to determine the critical exponent
\;${\delta}$\; of the survival rate. We also investigate the active behavior of
the system's particles under the critical point with increasing time steps,
which allows us to determine the characteristic time $t_f$ of the finite-scale
systems. And the dynamic exponents \;$z$\; are obtained using the scaling
relation \;$t_f{\sim}L^{z}$\;. We find that the autoencoder can well identify
this characteristic evolutionary behavior of particles. Finally, we discuss the
compliance of the scaling form \;$1/{\delta}-({\beta}-2)/{\delta}z=2$\; in
different \;${\beta}$\; intervals as well as a method to introduce a global
scaling mechanism by generating a random walking step using the L{\'{e}}vy
distribution.

<p>Antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics provides a route towards energy-efficient

(AVHE) in AFM monolayers is thus of considerable interest for both fundamental
condensed matter physics and device enginering. Here we propose a route to
achieve AVHE in A-type AFM insulator composed of vertically-stacked monolayer
quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI) with strain and electric field
modulations. Uniaxial strain and electric field generate valley polarization
and spin splitting, respectively. Using first-principles calculations,
$\mathrm{Fe_2BrMgP}$ monolayer is predicted to be a prototype A-type AFM
hosting \emph{valley-polarized quantum spin Hall insulator} (VQSHI) in which
AVHE and quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) are synergized in a single system. Our
findings reveal a route to achieve multiple Hall effects in 2D tetragonal AFM

<p>Laser irradiation of materials is most commonly modeled with the

Here, we calculate the electronic heat conductivity at elevated electron

the electron-phonon contribution to the electronic heat conductivity, and the
linear response theory (in the single-pole Ritchie-Howie loss function

on $m$-plane $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$(10$\bar{1}$0) by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)
and metal-oxide-catalyzed epitaxy (MOCATAXY) is investigated. By systematically
exploring the parameter space accessed by MBE and MOCATAXY, phase-pure
$\alpha$-Ga$_2$O$_3$(10$\bar{1}$0) and
$\alpha$-(In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$(10$\bar{1}$0) thin films are realized. The
presence of In on the $\alpha$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ growth surface remarkably expands
its growth window far into the metal-rich flux regime and to higher growth
temperatures. With increasing O-to-Ga flux ratio ($R_{\text{O}}$), In
incorporates into $\alpha$-(In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ up to $x \leq 0.08$.
Upon a critical thickness, $\beta$-(In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ nucleates and
subsequently heteroepitaxially grows on top of
$\alpha$-(In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ facets. Metal-rich MOCATAXY growth
conditions, where $\alpha$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ would not conventionally stabilize, lead
to single-crystalline $\alpha$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ with negligible In incorporation and
improved surface morphology. Higher $T_{\text{G}}$ further results in
single-crystalline $\alpha$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ with well-defined terraces and step
edges at their surfaces. For $R_{\text{O}} \leq 0.53$, In acts as a surfactant
on the $\alpha$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ growth surface by favoring step edges, while for
$R_{\text{O}} \geq 0.8$, In incorporates and leads to a-plane
$\alpha$-(In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ faceting and the subsequent ($\bar{2}$01)
$\beta$-(In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ growth on top. Thin film analysis by STEM

<p>We analyze, using first-principles calculations and the method of invariants,
the spin-orbit proximity effects in trilayer heterostructures comprising
phosphorene and encapsulating WSe$_2$ monolayers. We focus on four different
configurations, in which the top/bottom WSe$_2$ monolayer is twisted by 0 or 60
degrees with respect to phosphorene, and analyze the spin splitting of
phosphorene hole bands around the $\Gamma$ point. Our results show that the
spin texture of phosphorene hole bands can be dramatically modified by
different encapsulations of phosphorene monolayer. For a symmetrically
encapsulated phosphorene, the momentum-dependent spin-orbit field has the
out-of-plane component only, simulating the spin texture of phosphorene-like
group-IV monochalcogenide ferroelectrics. Furthermore, we reveal that the
direction of the out-of-plane spin-orbit field can be controlled by switching
the twist angle from 0 to 60 degrees. Finally, we show that the spin texture in
asymmetrically encapsulated phosphorene has the dominant in-plane component of
the spin-orbit field, comparable to the Rashba effect in phosphorene with an
applied sizable external electric field. Our results confirm that the
significant modification and control of the spin texture is possible in low
common-symmetry heterostructures, paving the way for using different substrates
to modify spin properties in materials important for spintronics.

<p>The formation of energetically favourable and metastable mineral phases
within the Fe-H2O system controls the long-term mobility of iron complexes as
well as other aqueous phase constituents in natural aquifers, soils and other
environmentally and industrially relevant systems. The fundamental mechanism
controlling the formation of these solid phases has remained enigmatic. Here,
we develop a general state-of-the-art partial equilibrium model and succeed in
predicting the rate of amorphous 2-line ferrihydrite precipitation, dissolution
and overall transformation to crystalline goethite at alkaline pH. All
mechanistic steps constituting the transformation mechanism accurately predict
the experimentally measured solid and aqueous phase composition over time,
involving only a single kinetic rate constant each. It is found that the
precipitation of goethite (i) occurs from solution and (ii) is limited by the
comparatively slow dissolution of the first forming amorphous phase 2-line
ferrihydrite. A generalised transformation mechanism applicable to near-neutral
and mildly acidic pH further illustrates that differences in the kinetics of
Fe(III) precipitation are controlled by the coordination environment of the
predominant Fe(III) hydrolysis product. Findings provide a framework for the
modelling of other iron(bearing) phases across a broad range of aqueous phase
compositions.

<p>The critical behaviour of laser-induced changes in magnetic ordering is
studied experimentally in two-dimensional zigzag antiferromagnets $XY$-like
NiPS$_3$ and Ising-like FePS$_3$. To examine laser-induced dynamics in flakes
of these compounds, we employ time-resolved exchange linear dichroism effect
sensitive to zigzag magnetic ordering and independent of the orientation of the
antiferromagnetic vector. In both compounds laser excitation in the vicinity of
the absorption edge induces partial quenching of the antiferromagnetic ordering
manifested by exchange linear dichroism reduction. The amplitude of the effect
varies with temperature as the derivative of the antiferromagnetic vector and
exhibits a critical behaviour with the exponents corresponding to $XY$- and
Ising-models for NiPS$_3$ and FePS$_3$, respectively. Critical slowing down of
the demagnetization in the vicinity of N\'eel temperature is found, however,
only in FePS$_3$. In contrast, the increase of the demagnetization time near
the ordering temperature in NiPS$_3$ is minor. We show that the difference in
the demagnetization times correlates well with the spin specific heat in both
compounds. Beyond the range of slowing down, the demagnetization times in
NiPS$_3$ and FePS$_3$ are comparable, about 5 - 10 ps, and are longer than
those reported earlier for CoPS$_3$ and considerably shorter than for MnPS$_3$.
This points to the importance of the unquenched angular momentum of
transition-metal ions in laser-induced demagnetization process.

<p>Quantum devices such as spin qubits have been extensively investigated in
electrostatically confined quantum dots using high-quality semiconductor
heterostructures like GaAs and Si. Here, we present the first demonstration of
electrostatically forming the quantum dots in ZnO heterostructures. Through the
transport measurement, we uncover the distinctive signature of the Kondo effect
independent of the even-odd electron number parity, which contrasts with the
typical behavior of the Kondo effect in GaAs. By analyzing temperature and
magnetic field dependences, we find that the absence of the even-odd parity in
the Kondo effect is not straightforwardly interpreted by the considerations
developed for conventional semiconductors. We propose that, based on the unique
parameters of ZnO, electron correlation likely plays a fundamental role in this
observation. Our study not only clarifies the physics of correlated electrons
in the quantum dot but also holds promise for applications in quantum devices,
leveraging the unique features of ZnO.

<i>Carlos P. Herrero, Rafael Ramirez</i>
<p>Graphene has become in last decades a paradigmatic example of two-dimensional
and so-called van-der-Waals layered materials, showing large anisotropy in
their physical properties. Here we study the elastic properties and mechanical
stability of graphene bilayers in a wide temperature range by molecular
dynamics simulations. We concentrate on in-plane elastic constants and
compression modulus, as well as on the atomic motion in the out-of-plane
direction. Special emphasis is placed upon the influence of anharmonicity of
the vibrational modes on the physical properties of bilayer graphene. We
consider the excess area appearing in the presence of ripples in graphene
sheets at finite temperatures. The in-plane compression modulus of bilayer
graphene is found to decrease for rising temperature, and results to be higher
than for monolayer graphene. We analyze the mechanical instability of the
bilayer caused by an in-plane compressive stress. This defines a spinodal
pressure for the metastability limit of the material, which depends on the
system size. Finite-size effects are described by power laws for the
out-of-plane mean-square fluctuation, compression modulus, and spinodal
pressure. Further insight into the significance of our results for bilayer
graphene is gained from a comparison with data for monolayer graphene and
graphite.

<p>The absence of screening of the non-local Coulomb interaction in Dirac
systems at charge neutrality leads to the breakdown of the Fermi liquid and
divergence of the Fermi velocity. On the other hand, Mott Hubbard physics and
the concomitant formation of local moments is dominated by the local effective
Hubbard interaction. Using quantum Monte Carlo methods combined with stochastic
analytical continuation, we compute the single particle spectral function of
fermions on the honeycomb lattice for a realistic interaction that includes
both the Hubbard interaction and long-ranged Coulomb repulsion. To a first
approximation, we find that the generic high-energy features such as the
formation of the upper Hubbard band are independent of the long-ranged Coulomb
repulsion and determined mostly by the local effective Hubbard interaction. The
sub-leading effects of adding the long-range interaction include an enhancement
of the bandwidth and a decrease of the spin-polaron quasi-particle weight and
lifetime.

<i>A. V. Korotchenkov, N. S. Averkiev</i>
<p>We demonstrate the possibility of the optical orientation of excitons in the
near field of the metal grating that covers a semiconductor nanostructure.
Excitons generated this way have the wave vector greater than the wave vector
of the incident radiation. We suggest that optical orientation method is
applicable to study the fine structure and kinetics of the hot excitons in
semiconductor quantum well.

<h3>Thermal Hall conductivity of a valence bond solid phase in the square  lattice $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnet Heisenberg model with a  Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12563" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12563</a>
<br>
<i>Lucas S. Buzo, R. L. Doretto</i>
<p>We calculate the thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$ for the columnar
valence-bond solid phase of a two-dimensional frustrated antiferromagnet. In
particular, we consider the square lattice spin-$1/2$ $J_1$-$J_2$
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with an additional Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction between the spins and in the presence of an external magnetic
field. We concentrate on the intermediate parameter region of the $J_1$-$J_2$
model, where a quantum paramagnetic phase is stable, and consider a
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vector pattern associated with the couplings between the
spins in the CuO$_2$ planes of the YBCO compound. We describe the columnar
valence-bond solid phase within the bond-operator formalism, which allows us to
map the Heisenberg model into an effective interacting boson model written in
terms of triplet operators. The effective boson model is studied within the
harmonic approximation and the triplon excitation bands of the columnar
valence-bond solid phase is determined. We then calculate the Berry curvature
and the Chern numbers of the triplon excitation bands and, finally, determine
the thermal Hall conductivity due to triplons as a function of the temperature.
We find that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction yields a finite Berry
curvature for the triplon bands, but the corresponding Chern numbers vanish.
Although the triplon excitations are topologically trivial, the thermal Hall
conductivity of the columnar valence-bond solid phase in the square lattice
antiferromagnet is finite at low temperatures. We comment on the relations of
our results with a {\sl no-go} condition for a thermal Hall effect previously
derived for ordered magnets.

<h3>Probing of Excitonic Transitions in All Inorganic Perovskite Quantum  Dots (CsPbX$_3$: X= Cl, Br, I) by Magnetic Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12567" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12567</a>
<br>
<i>Prasenjit Mandal, Ranjani Viswanatha</i>
<p>Higher-order electronic transitions of all inorganic lead halide perovskite
quantum dots (QDs) (CsPbX$_3$: X = Cl, Br, I) are hardly detected by
traditional spectroscopic techniques due to the condensed electronic level of
QDs. This work assigned the various excitonic transitions in undoped CsPbX$_3$
QDs through a high-resolution absorption spectroscopic technique - magnetic
circular dichroism (MCD). Moreover, we investigated the nature of these
transitions through sensitive Zeeman responses to the electronic states, likely
involving the interaction of spins with the applied external magnetic field.
The study unveiled multiple excitonic transitions in the QDs, showing unusual
temperature dependence and shedding light on the role of spin-orbit
interactions in the presence of a magnetic field. This study offers a
comprehensive insight into excitonic transitions, and the potential
manipulation of their spin through thermal means holds the promise of advancing
electronic and photonic devices based on these materials.

<h3>Ab initio framework for deciphering trade-off relationships in  multi-component alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12642" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12642</a>
<br>
<i>Franco Moitzi, Lorenz Romaner, Max Hodapp, Andrei V. Ruban, Oleg E. Peil</i>
<p>While first-principles methods have been successfully applied to characterize
individual properties of multi-principal element alloys (MPEA), their use to
search for optimal trade-offs between competing properties is hampered by high
computational demands. In this work, we present a novel framework to explore
Pareto-optimal compositions by integrating advanced ab-initio-based techniques
into a Bayesian multi-objective optimization method. We benchmark the framework
by applying it to solid solution strengthening and ductility of refractory
MPEAs, with the parameters of the strengthening and ductility models being
efficiently computed using a combination of the coherent-potential
approximation method, accounting for finite-temperature effects, and
actively-learned moment-tensor potentials parameterized with ab initio data.
Additionally, we introduce an analytical model that captures the concentration
dependence of all relevant material properties, relying on a few
element-specific parameters and universal functions that describe bonding
between elements. Our findings offer new crucial insights into the traditional
strength-vs-ductility dilemma of refractory MPEAs. The proposed framework is
versatile and can be extended to other materials and properties of interest,
enabling a predictive and tractable high-throughput screening of Pareto-optimal
MPEAs over the entire composition space.

<h3>Ab initio self-trapped excitons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12662" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12662</a>
<br>
<i>Yunfei Bai, Yaxian Wang, Sheng Meng</i>
<p>We propose a new formalism and an effective computational framework to study
self-trapped excitons (STE) in insulators and semiconductors from first
principles. Using the many-body Bethe-Salpeter equation in combination with
perturbation theory, we are able to obtain the mode- and momentum-resolved
exciton-phonon coupling matrix element in a perturbative scheme, and explicitly
solve the real space localization of the electron (hole), as well as the
lattice distortion. Further, this method allows to compute the STE potential
energy surface and evaluate the STE formation energy and Stokes shift. We
demonstrate our approach using two-dimensional magnetic semiconductor chromium
trihalides and a wide-gap insulator BeO, the latter of which features dark
excitons, and make predictions of their Stokes shift and coherent phonon
generation which we hope to spark future experiments such as photoluminescence
and transient absorption studies.

<h3>Particularities of polaron formation in the extended Holstein model with  next nearest neighbor transfer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12677" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12677</a>
<br>
<i>Monodeep Chakraborty, Jayita Chatterjee, Holger Fehske</i>
<p>Employing a largely unbiased variational exact diagonalization technique, we
analyze the consequences of longer-ranged electron hopping and electron-phonon
interaction on polaron formation in one dimension. Having at our disposal the
accurate ground state energy and wavefunction, we calculate and discuss various
physical quantities, such as the renormalized band structure, effective mass,
wave-function renormalization factor, phonon dressing and Drude weight,
characterizing the properties of the polaronic quasiparticle. We demonstrate
that the electron-phonon coupling affects the relative strength of the
nearest-neigbor (NN) and next-nearest-neigbor (NNN) hopping processes in a
dynamic way. Most notably we observe that the minimum of the polaron band,
occurring at a finite momentum for large negative ratio between NN and NNN
transfer, jumps to zero momentum as the electron-phonon coupling exceeds a
critical one, thereby causing a rather sharp polaron transition in the
one-dimensional extended Holstein model. The signatures of this transition are
seen in the effective mass and polaron mobility, and therefore should be easily
detectable by transport measurements.

<h3>Virtual potential created by a feedback loop: taming the feedback demon  to explore stochastic thermodynamics of underdamped systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12687" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12687</a>
<br>
<i>Salamb√¥ Dago, Nicolas Barros, Jorge Pereda, Sergio Ciliberto, Ludovic Bellon</i>
<p>Virtual potentials are an elegant, precise and flexible tool to manipulate
small systems and explore fundamental questions in stochastic thermodynamics.
In particular double-well potentials have applications in information
processing, such as the demonstration of Landauer's principle. In this chapter,
we detail the implementation of a feedback loop for an underdamped system, in
order to build a tunable virtual double-well potential. This feedback behaves
as a demon acting on the system depending on the outcome of a continuously
running measurement. It can thus modify the energy exchanges with the
thermostat and create an out-of-equilibrium state. To create a bi-stable
potential, the feedback consists only in switching an external force between
two steady values when the measured position crosses a threshold. We show that
a small delay of the feedback loop in the switches between the two wells
results in a modified velocity distribution. The latter can be interpreted as a
cooling of the kinetic temperature of the system. Using a fast digital
feedback, we successfully address all experimental issues to create a virtual
potential that is statistically indistinguishable from a physical one, with a
tunable barrier height and energy step between the two wells.

<h3>Human perceptual decision making of nonequilibrium fluctuations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12692" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12692</a>
<br>
<i>Ayb√ºke Durmaz, Yonathan Sarmiento, Gianfranco Fortunato, Debraj Das, Mathew Ernst Diamond, Domenica Bueti, √âdgar Rold√°n</i>
<p>Perceptual decision-making frequently requires making rapid, reliable choices
upon encountering noisy sensory inputs. To better define the statistical
processes underlying perceptual decision-making, here we characterize the
choices of human participants visualizing a system of nonequilibrium stationary
physical dynamics and compare such choices to the performance of an optimal
agent computing Wald's sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). Participants
viewed movies of a particle endowed with drifted Brownian dynamics and had to
judge the motion as leftward or rightward. Overall, the results uncovered
fundamental performance limits, consistent with recently established
thermodynamic trade-offs involving speed, accuracy, and dissipation.
Specifically, decision times are sensitive to entropy production rates.
Moreover, to achieve a given level of observed accuracy, participants require
more time than predicted by SPRT, indicating suboptimal integration of
available information. In view of such suboptimality, we develop an alternative
account based on evidence integration with a memory time constant. Setting the
time constant proportionately to the deviation from equilibrium in the stimuli
significantly improved trial-by-trial predictions of decision metrics with
respect to SPRT. This study shows that perceptual psychophysics using stimuli
rooted in nonequilibrium physical processes provides a robust platform for
understanding how the brain takes decisions on stochastic information inputs.

<h3>Weyl orbits as probe of chiral separation effect in magnetic Weyl  semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12712" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12712</a>
<br>
<i>M.A.Zubkov</i>
<p>We consider magnetic Weyl semimetals. First of all we review relation of
intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity, band contribution to intrinsic magnetic
moment, and the conductivity of chiral separation effect (CSE) to the
topological invariants written in terms of the Wigner transformed Green
functions (with effects of interaction and disorder taken into account). Next,
we concentrate on the CSE. The corresponding bulk axial current would result in
accumulation of particles and holes of opposite chiralities at the surface of
the sample. However, this accumulation is compensated by the flow of the states
in momentum space along the Fermi arcs. Together with the bulk CSE current this
flow forms closed Weyl orbits. Their detection can be considered as
experimental discovery of chiral separation effect. Previously it was proposed
to detect Weyl orbits through the observation of quantum oscillations
\cite{Potter_2014} . We propose the alternative (and more direct) way to detect
existence of Weyl orbits through the observation of their contributions to
sample magnetization and to Hall current.

<h3>Adiabatic observables and Berry curvatures in insulators and metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12729" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12729</a>
<br>
<i>Raffaele Resta</i>
<p>A sharp definition of what "adiabatic" means is given; it is then shown that
the time-dependent expectation value of a quantum-mechanical observable in the
adiabatic limit can be expressed -- in many cases -- by means of the
appropriate Berry curvature. Condensed-matter observables belonging to this
class include: Born effective charges in insulators and in metals, quantized
Faraday charges in electrolytes, and linear dc conductivities (longitudinal and
transverse). Remarkably, the adiabatic limit is well defined even in metals,
despite the absence of a spectral gap therein. For all of the above observables
the explicit Berry-curvature expressions are derived in a general many-body
setting, which also allows for compact and very transparent notations and
formulas. Their conversion into band-structure formulas in the
independent-electron crystalline case is straightforward.

<h3>Group theory on quasi-symmetry and protected near degeneracy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12738" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12738</a>
<br>
<i>Jiayu Li, Ao Zhang, Yuntian Liu, Qihang Liu</i>
<p>In solid state systems, group representation theory is powerful in
characterizing the behavior of quasiparticles, notably the energy degeneracy.
While conventional group theory is effective in answering yes-or-no questions
related to symmetry breaking, its application to determining the magnitude of
energy splitting resulting from symmetry lowering is limited. Here, we propose
a theory on quasi-symmetry and near degeneracy, thereby expanding the
applicability of group theory to address questions regarding large-or-small
energy splitting. Defined within the degenerate subspace of an unperturbed
Hamiltonian, quasi-symmetries form an enlarged symmetry group eliminating the
first-order splitting. This framework ensures that the magnitude of splitting
arises as a second-order effect of symmetry-lowering perturbations, such as
external fields and spin-orbit coupling. We systematically tabulate the
subspaces supporting crystallographic quasi-symmetry groups and demonstrate
that $Z_{n}$, $U(1)$, and $D_{\infty}$ can serve as the quotient group of
unitary quasi-symmetry group in doubly degenerate subspace. Applying our theory
to the realistic material AgLa, we predict a "quasi-Dirac semimetal" phase
characterized by two tiny-gap band anticrossings. Our research not only
broadens the scope of group theory but also opens new avenues for material
design, particularly in the realm of superior Berry curvature-related
properties.

<h3>Atomistic theory of moir√© Hofstadter's butterfly in magic-angle  graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12740" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12740</a>
<br>
<i>Alina Wania Rodrigues, Maciej Bieniek, Pawe≈Ç Potasz, Daniel Miravet, Ronny Thomale, Marek Korkusi≈Ñski, Pawe≈Ç Hawrylak</i>
<p>We present here a Hofstadter's butterfly spectrum for the magic angle twisted
bilayer graphene obtained using an ab initio based multi-million atom
tight-binding model. We incorporate a hexagonal boron nitride substrate and
out-of-plane atomic relaxation. The effects of a magnetic field are introduced
via the Peierls modification of the long-range tight-binding matrix elements
and the Zeeman spin splitting effects. A nanoribbon geometry is studied, and
the quantum size effects for the sample widths up to 1 $\mu$m are analyzed both
for a large energy window and for the flatband around the Fermi level. For
sufficiently wide ribbons, where the role of the finite geometry is minimized,
we obtain and plot the Hofstadter spectrum and identify the in-gap Chern
numbers by counting the total number of chiral edge states crossing these gaps.
Subsequently, we examine the Wannier diagrams to identify the insulating states
at charge neutrality. We establish the presence of three types of electronic
states: moir\'e, mixed, and conventional. These states describe both the bulk
Landau levels and the edge states crossing gaps in the spectrum. The evolution
of the bulk moir\'e flatband wavefunctions in the magnetic field is
investigated, predicting a decay of the electronic density from the moir\'e
centers as the magnetic flux increases. Furthermore, the spatial properties of
the three types of edge states are studied, illustrating the evolution of their
localization as a function of the nanoribbon momentum.

<h3>Effects of substrate corrugation during helium adsorption on graphene in  the grand canonical ensemble</h3>

<br>
<i>Gage Erwin, Adrian Del Maestro</i>
<p>Adsorption of 4He on atomically flat substrates such as graphene provides a
route towards the engineering of low dimensional quantum phases including
superfluids and strongly interacting insulators. In this study, we explore the
effects of graphene corrugation on the helium adsorption process via quantum
Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. We utilize an
empirical adsorption potential based on the superposition of individual
helium-carbon interactions and systematically control corrugation, from a
smooth membrane to the fully rough potential, via the implementation of a
cutoff in reciprocal space. The results highlight the importance of using a
fully corrugated potential to understand the plethora of commensurate and
incommensurate phases in the first adsorbed layer. Surprisingly, some residual
effects of corrugation are still present before and during the promotion and
onset of a second adsorbed layer, where a smooth adsorption can lead to
enhanced particle fluctuations in a helium-interaction dominated regime.

<h3>Influence of interlayer exchange coupling on ultrafast laser-induced  magnetization reversal in ferromagnetic spin valves</h3>

<br>
<i>Junta Igarashi, Yann Le-Guen, Julius Hohlfeld, Stephane Mangin, Jon Gorchon, Michel Hehn, Gregory Malinowski</i>
<p>In this study, we explore the influence of interlayer exchange coupling on
magnetization reversal triggered by femtosecond laser pulses in ferromagnetic
spin valves. Our experiments, focused on femtosecond laser-induced
magnetization reversal, methodically vary the thickness of the copper (Cu)
spacer layer. We identify a critical Cu thickness threshold at 2.32 nm. Above
this threshold, a stable reversed magnetic domain is consistently generated
upon exposure to a single laser pulse. Conversely, with a Cu spacer thinner
than 2.32 nm, the observed magnetization reversal from parallel (P) to
anti-parallel (AP) states occurs only under continuous laser irradiation. Once
the laser is stopped, the magnetic configuration relaxes back to its initial P
state, influenced by ferromagnetic exchange coupling. This research enhances
our understanding of the mechanisms driving optically induced ultrafast
magnetization reversal in ferromagnetic spin valves.

<br>
<i>Samuel Duffield, Maxwell Aifer, Gavin Crooks, Thomas Ahle, Patrick J. Coles</i>
<p>Thermodynamic computing exploits fluctuations and dissipation in physical
systems to efficiently solve various mathematical problems. For example, it was
recently shown that certain linear algebra problems can be solved
thermodynamically, leading to an asymptotic speedup scaling with the matrix
dimension. The origin of this "thermodynamic advantage" has not yet been fully
explained, and it is not clear what other problems might benefit from it. Here
we provide a new thermodynamic algorithm for exponentiating a real matrix, with
applications in simulating linear dynamical systems. We describe a simple
electrical circuit involving coupled oscillators, whose thermal equilibration
can implement our algorithm. We also show that this algorithm also provides an
asymptotic speedup that is linear in the dimension. Finally, we introduce the
concept of thermodynamic parallelism to explain this speedup, stating that
thermodynamic noise provides a resource leading to effective parallelization of
computations, and we hypothesize this as a mechanism to explain thermodynamic
advantage more generally.

<h3>Roles of Hund's Rule and Hybridization in the Two-orbital Model for  High-$T_c$ Superconductivity in the Bilayer Nickelate</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12769" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12769</a>
<br>
<i>Xing-Zhou Qu, Dai-Wei Qu, Wei Li, Gang Su</i>
<p>The intriguing interplay between the two $e_g$ orbitals in the high-$T_c$
nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is studied via the density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) and finite-$T$ thermal tensor-network
calculations. We consider a bilayer $t$-$J$ model that incorporates both
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals, as well as inter-orbital hybridization
and ferromagnetic Hund's rule coupling. Our DMRG calculations reveal that both
orbitals exhibit algebraic superconductive (SC) pairing correlations in the
ground state, with the former being stronger than the latter. To confirm the
dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$-orbital SC order, we compute the pairing susceptibility
$\chi_{\rm SC}$, and find a power-law divergence of $\chi_{\rm SC}$ below
$T_c^* \simeq 0.03 t_c$, with $t_c$ being the intralayer hopping of the
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. Regarding the $d_{z^2}$ orbitals, their finite-$T$
$\chi_{\rm SC}$ results show weaker divergence and suggest lower $T_c^*$. We
delve deeper into the intricate interplay between Hund's rule coupling and
inter-orbital hybridization by tuning the two parameters, and reveal two
distinct SC phases dominated by Hund's rule and hybridization, respectively,
separated by a non-SC regime. Our results treat the two $e_g$ orbitals in a
bilayer model on an equal footing, and clarify the essential roles of Hund's
rule and hybridization in the formation of SC order in the pressurized
nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

<br>
<i>Xiao-Wei Zhang, Chong Wang, Xiaoyu Liu, Yueyao Fan, Ting Cao, Di Xiao</i>
<p>Motivated by recent experimental observations of opposite Chern numbers in
$R$-type twisted MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ homobilayers, we perform large-scale
density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations with machine learning force fields
to investigate moir\'e band topology from large to small twist angels in both
materials. We find that the Chern numbers of the moir\'e frontier bands change
sign as a function of twist angle, and this change is driven by the competition
between the in-plane piezoelectricity and the out-of-plane ferroelectricity.
Our large-scale calculations, enabled by machine learning methods, reveal
crucial insights into interactions across different scales in twisted bilayer
systems. The interplay between atomic-level relaxation effects and
moir\'e-scale electrostatic potential variation opens new avenues for the
design of intertwined topological and correlated states.

<p>The ultimate spatial limit to establish a Josephson coupling between two
superconducting electrodes is an atomic-scale vacuum tunneling junction. The
Josephson effect in such ultrasmall junctions has been widely used to study
superconducting materials, providing a powerful probe of the spatial variations
of the superfluid density. Furthermore, studies of the supercurrent and
charging effects unveiled new, frequency dependent, switching dynamics and
thermal processes emerging due to the small size of the junctions. However, the
Cooper pair current magnitude was considerably reduced by thermal fluctuations.
Here we show that a feedback element induces a time-dependent bistable regime
which periodically restores the zero voltage state. We find that the
time-averaged current within the bistable regime is independent of thermal
smearing, opening new avenues to study superconducting phenomena at the
nanoscale.

<h3>On the emergence of memory in equilibrium versus non-equilibrium systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12788" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12788</a>
<br>
<i>Xizhu Zhao, David Hartich, Alja≈æ Godec</i>
<p>Experiments often probe observables that correspond to low-dimensional
projections of highdimensional dynamics. In such situations distinct
microscopic configurations become lumped into the same observable state. It is
well known that correlations between the observable and the hidden degrees of
freedom give rise to memory effects. However, how and under which conditions
these correlations emerge remains poorly understood. Here we shed light on two
fundamentally different scenarios of the emergence of memory in minimal
stationary systems, where observed and hidden degrees of freedom evolve either
cooperatively or are coupled by a hidden non-equilibrium current. In the
reversible setting strongest memory manifests when the time-scales of hidden
and observed dynamics overlap, whereas, strikingly, in the driven setting
maximal memory emerges under a clear time-scale separation. Our results hint at
the possibility of fundamental differences in the way memory emerges in
equilibrium versus driven systems that may be utilized as a "diagnostic" of the
underlying hidden transport mechanism.

<h3>Tilted Dirac superconductor at quantum criticality: Restoration of  Lorentz symmetry</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12797" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12797</a>
<br>
<i>Pablo Reiser, Vladimir Juricic</i>
<p>Lorentz symmetry appears as a quite robust feature of the strongly
interacting Dirac materials even though the lattice interactions break such a
symmetry. We here demonstrate that the Lorentz symmetry is restored at the
quantum-critical point (QCP) separating the tilted Dirac semimetal, breaking
this symmetry already at the noninteracting level, from a gapped $s-$wave
superconducting instability. To this end, we employ a one-loop
$\epsilon=(3-D)-$expansion close to the $D=3$ upper critical dimension of the
corresponding Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory. In particular, we show that the
tilt parameter is marginally irrelevant and ultimately vanishes at the QCP
separating the two phases. In fact, as we argue here, such a Lorentz symmetry
restoration may be generic for the strongly interacting tilted Dirac
semimetals, irrespective of whether they feature mirror-symmetric or
mirror-asymmetric tilting, and is also insensitive to whether the instability
represents an insulator or a gapped superconductor. The proposed scenario can
be tested in the quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the interacting tilted
Dirac fermion lattice models.
