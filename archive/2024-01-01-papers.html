<h3>Fluctuation Theorem on Riemannian Manifold</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00046" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00046</a>
<br>
<i>Yifan Cai, Tao Wang, Liu Zhao</i>
<p>Based on the covariant underdamped and overdamped Langevin equations with
Stratonovich coupling to multiplicative noises and the associated Fokker-Planck
equations on Riemannian manifold, we present the first law of stochastic
thermodynamics on the trajectory level. The corresponding fluctuation theorems
are also established, with the total entropy production of the Brownian
particle and the heat reservoir playing the role of dissipation function.

<h3>Many-body higher-order topological invariant for $C_n$-symmetric  insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00050" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00050</a>
<br>
<i>Ammar Jahin, Yuan-Ming Lu, Yuxuan Wang</i>
<p>Higher-order topological insulators in two spatial dimensions display
fractional corner charges. While fractional charges in one dimension are known
to be captured by a many-body bulk invariant, computed by the Resta formula, a
many-body bulk invariant for higher-order topology and the corresponding
fractional corner charges remains elusive despite several attempts. Inspired by
recent work by Tada and Oshikawa, we propose a well-defined many-body bulk
invariant for $C_n$ symmetric higher-order topological insulators, which is
valid for both non-interacting and interacting systems. Instead of relating
them to the bulk quadrupole moment as was previously done, we show that in the
presence of $C_n$ rotational symmetry, this bulk invariant can be directly
identified with quantized fractional corner charges. In particular, we prove
that the corner charge is quantized as $e/n$ with $C_n$ symmetry, leading to a
$\mathbb{Z}_n$ classification for higher-order topological insulators in two
dimensions.

<h3>Transmission of waves and particles through the interface: reversibility  and coherence</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00059" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00059</a>
<br>
<i>A.P. Meilakhs</i>
<p>We examine the transmission of quantum particles (phonons, electrons, and
photons) across interfaces, identifying universal patterns in diverse physical
scenarios. Starting with classical wave equations, we quantize them and derive
kinetic equations. Those are matching conditions for the distribution functions
of particles at the interface. We note the time irreversibility of the derived
kinetic equations -- an essential feature for accurately describing
irreversible processes like heat transport. We identify the juncture in our
derivation where the time symmetry of wave equations is disrupted, it is the
assumption of the non-coherence of incident waves. Consequently, we infer that
non-coherent transmission through the interface exhibits time irreversibility.
We propose an experiment to validate this hypothesis.

<h3>Accelerating Process Development for 3D Printing of New Metal Alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00065" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00065</a>
<br>
<i>David Guirguis, Conrad Tucker, Jack Beuth</i>
<p>Addressing the uncertainty and variability in the quality of 3D printed
metals can further the wide spread use of this technology. Process mapping for
new alloys is crucial for determining optimal process parameters that
consistently produce acceptable printing quality. Process mapping is typically
performed by conventional methods and is used for the design of experiments and
ex situ characterization of printed parts. On the other hand, in situ
approaches are limited because their observable features are limited and they
require complex high-cost setups to obtain temperature measurements to boost
accuracy. Our method relaxes these limitations by incorporating the temporal
features of molten metal dynamics during laser-metal interactions using video
vision transformers and high-speed imaging. Our approach can be used in
existing commercial machines and can provide in situ process maps for efficient
defect and variability quantification. The generalizability of the approach is
demonstrated by performing cross-dataset evaluations on alloys with different
compositions and intrinsic thermofluid properties.

<h3>Machine-learned models for magnetic materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00072" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00072</a>
<br>
<i>Paweł Leszczyński, Kamil Kutorasiński, Marcin Szewczyk, Jarosław Pawłowski</i>
<p>We present a general framework for modeling materials using deep neural
networks. Material represented by multidimensional characteristics (that mimic
measurements) is used to train the neural autoencoder model in an unsupervised
manner. The encoder is trying to predict the material parameters of a
theoretical model, which is then used in a decoder part. The decoder, using the
predicted parameters, reconstructs the input characteristics. The neural model
is trained to capture a synthetically generated set of characteristics that can
cover a broad range of material behaviors, leading to a model that can
generalize on the underlying physics rather than just optimize the model
parameters for a single measurement. After setting up the model we prove its
usefulness in the complex problem of modeling magnetic materials in the
frequency and current (out-of-linear range) domains simultaneously.

<h3>A DFT + U Study of Absorption Spectra and Localized Surface Plasmon  Resonances of few electrons in Doped ZnO Quantum Dots</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00074" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00074</a>
<br>
<i>D Dada, M D Mochena</i>
<p>Quantum plasmonics of few electrons that was reported a few years ago in
photodoping experiments has received little or no attention in doped
nanomaterials both theoretically and experimentally. There are no studies of
quantum plasmonics of large quantum dots of the size of Bohr excitonic radius
or less that take electronic and geometric structure of the quantum dots. In
this work, we studied extensively the absorption spectra of a protype quantum
dot of sizeable ZnO of approximately 3.0 nm in diameter doped with Ga, and Al
in diluted limit with density functional theory (DFT) plus Hubbard corrections
(U). The localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) were then determined from
the real part of the dielectric function by correlating the negative portion of
it to resonant spectral lines. Our results show the sensitivity of the spectral
lines to distribution of the dopants, the electronic structure of the dopants,
the polarization of the electric field, and size of the quantum dots. Even
though our findings are based on stoichiometrically simple ZnO, it shows that
the DFT + U method with numerical atomic basis can be used at reasonable
computational cost to study quantum plasmonics of few electrons taking into
account electronic and geometric structures, which is missing currently. The
method can be extended to study magneto-optics of diluted magnetic
semiconductor QDs.

<h3>Superconductivity in CH4 and BH4- Containing Compounds Derived from the  High-Pressure Superhydrides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00088" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00088</a>
<br>
<i>Nisha Geng, Katerina P. Hilleke, Francesco Belli, Pratik Kumar Das, Eva Zurek</i>
<p>Inspired by the synthesis of the high-pressure Fm-3m LaH10 superconducting
superhydride, systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations are
performed to study ternaries that could be derived from it by replacing two of
the hydrogen atoms with boron or carbon and varying the identity of the
electropositive element. Though many of the resulting alkali-metal and
alkaline-earth MC2H8 phases are predicted to be dynamically stable at mild
pressures, their superconducting critical temperatures (Tcs) are low because
their metallicity results from the filling of an electride-like band.
Substitution with a trivalent element leads to phases with substantial metal
d-character at the Fermi level whose Tcs are typically above 40 K. Among the
MB2H8 phases examined, KB2H8, RbB2H8 and CsB2H8 are predicted to be dynamically
stable at very mild pressures, and their stability is rationalized by a
DFT-Chemical Pressure analysis that elucidates the role of the M atom size.
Quantum anharmonic effects strongly affect the properties of KB2H8, the highest
predicted Tc compound, near 10 GPa, but molecular dynamics simulations reveal
it would decompose below its Tc at this pressure. Nonetheless, at ca. 50 GPa
KB2H8 is predicted to be thermally stable with a superconducting figure of
merit surpassing that of the recently synthesized LaBeH8.

<h3>Universality of critical dynamics on a complex network</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00092" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00092</a>
<br>
<i>Mrinal Sarkar, Tilman Enss, Nicolò Defenu</i>
<p>We investigate the role of the spectral dimension $d_s$ in determining the
universality of phase transitions on a complex network. Due to its structural
heterogeneity, a complex network generally acts as a disordered system.
Specifically, we study the synchronization and entrainment transitions in the
nonequilibrium dynamics of the Kuramoto model and the phase transition of the
equilibrium dynamics of the classical $XY$ model, thereby covering a broad
spectrum from nonlinear dynamics to statistical and condensed matter physics.
Using linear theory, we obtain a general relationship between the dynamics
occurring on the network and the underlying network properties. This yields the
lower critical spectral dimension of the phase synchronization and entrainment
transitions in the Kuramoto model as $d_s=4$ and $d_s=2$ respectively, whereas
for the phase transition in the $XY$ model it is $d_s=2$. To test our
theoretical hypotheses, we employ a network where any two nodes on the network
are connected with a probability proportional to a power law of the distance
between the nodes; this realizes any desired $d_s\in [1, \infty)$. Our detailed
numerical study agrees well with the prediction of linear theory for the phase
synchronization transition in the Kuramoto model. However, it shows a clear
entrainment transition in the Kuramoto model and phase transition in the $XY$
model at $d_s \gtrsim 3$, not $d_s=2$ as predicted by linear theory. Our study
indicates that network disorder in the region $2 \leq d_s \lesssim 3$ seems to
be relevant and have a profound effect on the dynamics.

<h3>Strong ultrafast demagnetization due to the intraband transitions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00099" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00099</a>
<br>
<i>Mitsuko Murakami, G. P. Zhang</i>
<p>Demagnetization in ferromagnetic transition metals driven by a femtosecond
laser pulse is a fundamental problem in solid state physics, and its
understanding is essential to the development of spintronics devices. Ab initio
calculation of time-dependent magnetic moment in the velocity gauge so far has
not been successful in reproducing the large amount of demagnetization observed
in experiments. In this work, we propose a method to incorporate intraband
transitions within the velocity gauge through a convective derivative in the
crystal momentum space. Our results for transition-element bulk crystals (bcc
Fe, hcp Co and fcc Ni) based on the time-dependent quantum Liouville equation
show a dramatic enhancement in the amount of demagnetization after the
inclusion of an intraband term, in agreement with experiments. We also find
that the effect of intraband transitions to each ferromagnetic material is
distinctly different because of their band structure and spin property
differences. Our finding has a far-reaching impact on understanding of
ultrafast demagnetization.

<h3>Designer Pair Statistics of Disordered Many-Particle Systems with Novel  Properties</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00101" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00101</a>
<br>
<i>Haina Wang, Salvatore Torquato</i>
<p>Knowledge of exact analytical functional forms for the pair correlation
function $g_2(r)$ and its corresponding structure factor $S(k)$ of disordered
many-particle systems is limited. For fundamental and practical reasons, it is
highly desirable to add to the existing data base of analytical functional
forms for such pair statistics. Here, we design a plethora of such pair
functions in direct and Fourier spaces across the first three Euclidean space
dimensions that are realizable by diverse many-particle systems with varying
degrees of correlated disorder across length scales, spanning a wide spectrum
of hyperuniform, typical nonhyperuniform and antihyperuniform ones. This is
accomplished by utilizing an efficient inverse algorithm that determines
equilibrium states with up to pair interactions at positive temperature that
precisely match targeted forms for both $g_2(r)$ and $S(k)$. Among other
results, we realize an example with the strongest hyperuniform property among
known positive-temperature equilibrium states, critical-point systems (implying
unusual 1D systems with phase transitions) that are not in the Ising
universality class, systems that attain self-similar pair statistics under
Fourier transformation, and an experimentally feasible polymer model. We show
that our pair functions enable one to achieve systems with a wide range of
translational order and self-diffusion coefficients $\cal D$, which are
inversely related to one another. One can design other realizable pair
statistics via linear combinations of our functions or by applying our inverse
procedure to other desirable functional forms. Our approach facilitates the
inverse design of materials with desirable physical and chemical properties by
tuning their pair statistics.

<h3>Electric Double Layer from Phase Demixing Reinforced by Strong Coupling  Electrostatics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00116" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00116</a>
<br>
<i>YeongKyu Lee, JunBeom Cho, Yongkyu Lee, Won Bo Lee, YongSeok Jho</i>
<p>Ionic liquids (ILs) are appealing electrolytes for their favorable
physicochemical properties. However, despite their longstanding use,
understanding the capacitive behavior of ILs remains challenging. This is
largely due to the formation of a non-conventional electric double layer (EDL)
at the electrode-electrolyte interface. This study shows that the short-range
Yukawa interactions, representing the large anisotropically charged ILs, demix
IL to create a spontaneous surface charge separation, which is reinforced by
the strongly coupled charge interaction. The properties of the condensed layer,
the onset of charge separation, and the rise of overscreening and crowding
critically depend on the asymmetry of Yukawa interactions.

<h3>The optical conductivity of the 2D $t-J$ model and the origin of  electron incoherence in the high-T$_{c}$ cuprate superconductors: a  variational study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00118" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00118</a>
<br>
<i>Jianhua Yang, Tao Li</i>
<p>Understanding the origin of electron incoherence is the first step toward a
theoretical description of the non-Fermi liquid behavior of the high-T$_{c}$
cuprate superconductors. Such electron incoherence manifests itself most
evidently in the non-Drude behavior of the optical response of the system and
the anomalous density fluctuation behavior in the long wave length limit. The
spectral weight transfer related to such dissipative response, which is absent
in conventional Fermi liquid metal, has direct consequence on the dc transport
property of the system in the normal state and the superfluid stiffness in the
superconducting state. It is found that such electron incoherence remains
significant even in the clean limit and at low temperature and thus must be
attributed to the strong electron correlation effect in the cuprate
superconductors. Here we study such an intrinsic effect in the 2D $t-J$ model
through the variational calculation of its optical conductivity
$\sigma(\omega)$. We assume a resonating valence bond ground state as our
starting point and find that a significant portion of the total optical
spectral weight remains incoherent throughout the phase diagram. The optical
absorption is found to extend all the way to an energy of the order of the bare
band width. We find that both the total optical weight $\bar{K}$ and the
integrated incoherent optical weight $I$ increase monotonically with doping,
with their ratio $R_{incoh}=I/\bar{K}$ decreasing monotonically with doping.
Our results indicate that the majority part of electron incoherence in the 2D
$t-J$ model can be attributed to the electron fractionalization mechanism
assumed in such a treatment. We also find that the Drude weight deduced from
$D=\bar{K}-I$ scales linearly with hole doping, without any sign of a
non-monotonic behavior in the overdoped regime.

<h3>Revisiting stress propagation in a two-dimensional elastic circular disk  under diametric loading</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00126" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00126</a>
<br>
<i>Yosuke Sato, Haruto Ishikawa, Satoshi Takada</i>
<p>In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of stress propagation
in a two-dimensional elastic circular disk. To accurately describe the
displacements and stress fields within the disk, we employ a scalar and vector
potential approach, representing them as sums of Bessel functions. The
determination of the coefficients for these expansions is accomplished in the
Laplace space, where we compare the boundary conditions. By converting the
inverse Laplace transforms into complex integrals using residue calculus, we
successfully derive explicit expressions for the displacements and stress
fields. Notably, these expressions encompass primary, secondary, and surface
waves, providing a thorough characterization of the stress propagation
phenomena within the disk. Our findings contribute to the understanding of
mechanical behavior in disk-shaped components and can be valuable in the design
and optimization of such structures across various engineering disciplines.

<h3>Absence of Weyl nodes in EuCd$_2$As$_2$ revealed by the carrier density  dependence of the anomalous Hall effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00138" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00138</a>
<br>
<i>Yue Shi, Zhaoyu Liu, Logan A. Burnett, Seokhyeong Lee, Chaowei Hu, Qianni Jiang, Jiaqi Cai, Xiaodong Xu, Cheng-Chien Chen, Jiun-Haw Chu</i>
<p>The antiferromagnetic layered compound EuCd$_2$As$_2$ is widely considered as
a leading candidate of ideal Weyl semimetal, featuring a single pair of Weyl
nodes in its field-induced ferromagnetic (FM) state. Nevertheless, this view
has recently been challenged by an optical spectroscopy study, which suggests
that it is a magnetic semiconductor. In this study, we have successfully
synthesized highly insulating EuCd$_2$As$_2$ crystals with carrier density
reaching as low as $2\times 10^{15}$ $\text{cm}^{-3}$. The magneto-transport
measurements revealed a progressive decrease of the anomalous Hall conductivity
(AHC) by several orders of magnitude as the carrier density decreases. This
behavior contradicts with what is expected from the intrinsic AHC generated by
the Weyl points, which is independent of carrier density as the Fermi level
approaches the charge neutrality point. In contrast, the scaling relationship
between AHC and longitudinal conductivity aligns with the characteristics of
variable range hopping insulators. Our results suggest that EuCd$_2$As$_2$ is a
magnetic semiconductor rather than a topological Weyl semimetal.

<h3>Spin current generation due to differential rotation</h3>

<i>Takumi Funato, Shunichiro Kinoshita, Norihiro Tanahashi, Shin Nakamura, Mamoru Matsuo</i>
<p>We study nonequilibrium spin dynamics in differentially rotating systems,
deriving an effective Hamiltonian for conduction electrons in the comoving
frame. In contrast to conventional spin current generation mechanisms that
require vorticity, our theory describes spins and spin currents arising from
differentially rotating systems regardless of vorticity. We demonstrate the
generation of spin currents in differentially rotating systems, such as liquid
metals with Taylor-Couette flow. Our alternative mechanism will be important in
the development of nanomechanical spin devices.

<h3>Coarsening of topological defects in 2D polar active matter</h3>

<br>
<i>Soumyadeep Mondal, Pankaj Popli, Sumantra Sarkar</i>
<p>We numerically study the coarsening of topological defects in 2D polar active
matter and make several interesting observations and predictions. (i) The long
time state is characterized by nonzero density of defects, in stark contrast to
theoretical expectations. (ii) The kinetics of defect coarsening shows power
law decay to steady state, as opposed to exponential decay in thermal
equilibrium. (iii) Observations (i) and (ii) together suggest emergent
screening of topological charges due to activity. (iv) Nontrivial defect
coarsening in the active model leads to nontrivial steady state patterns. We
investigate, characterize, and validate these patterns and discuss their
biological significance.

<h3>On the Ground State Quantum Droplet for Large Chemical Potentials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00213" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00213</a>
<br>
<i>J. Holmer, K.Z. Zhang, P.G. Kevrekidis</i>
<p>In the present work we revisit the problem of the quantum droplet in atomic
Bose-Einstein condensates with an eye towards describing its ground state in
the large density, so-called Thomas-Fermi limit. We consider the problem as
being separable into 3 distinct regions: an inner one, where the Thomas-Fermi
approximation is valid, a sharp transition region where the density abruptly
drops towards the (vanishing) background value and an outer region which
asymptotes to the background value. We analyze the spatial extent of each of
these regions, and develop a systematic effective description of the rapid
intermediate transition region. Accordingly, we derive a uniformly valid
description of the ground state that is found to very accurately match our
numerical computations. As an additional application of our considerations, we
show that this formulations allows for an analytical approximation of excited
states such as the (trapped) dark soliton in the large density limit.

<h3>Edge and bulk states in Weyl-orbit quantum Hall effect as studied by  Corbino measurements</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00224" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00224</a>
<br>
<i>Yusuke Nakazawa, Ryosuke Kurihara, Masatoshi Miyazawa, Shinichi Nishihaya, Markus Kriener, Masashi Tokunaga, Masashi Kawasaki, Masaki Uchida</i>
<p>We investigate edge and bulk states in Weyl-orbit based quantum Hall effect
by measuring a Corbino-type device fabricated from a topological Dirac
semimetal (Cd1-xZnx)3As2 film. Clear quantum Hall plateaus are observed when
measuring one-sided terminals of the Corbino-type device. This indicates that
edge states of the Weyl-orbit quantum Hall effect form closed trajectories
consisting of Fermi arcs and chiral zero modes independently on inner and outer
sides. On the other hand, the bulk resistance does not diverge at fields where
the quantum Hall plateau appears, suggesting that the Weyl orbits in the bulk
region are not completely localized when applying electric current through the
bulk region.

<h3>Strain induced electronic and magnetic transition in S = 3/2  antiferromagnetic spin chain compound LaCrS3</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00239" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00239</a>
<br>
<i>Kuldeep Kargeti, Aadit Sen, S. K. Panda</i>
<p>Exploring the physics of low-dimensional spin systems and their
pressure-driven electronic and magnetic transitions are thriving research field
in modern condensed matter physics. In this context, recently antiferromagnetic
Cr-based compounds such as CrI3, CrBr3, CrGeTe3 have been investigated
experimentally and theoretically for their possible spintronics applications.
Motivated by the fundamental and industrial importance of these materials, we
theoretically studied the electronic and magnetic properties of a relatively
less explored Cr-based chalcogenide, namely LaCrS3 where 2D layers of magnetic
Cr3+ ions form a rectangular lattice. We employed density functional theory +
Hubbard U approach in conjunction with constrained random-phase approximation
(cRPA) where the later was used to estimate the strength of U. Our findings at
ambient pressure show that the system exhibits semiconducting antiferromagnetic
ground state with a gap of 0.5 eV and large Cr moments that corresponds to
nominal S=3/2 spin-state. The 1st nearest neighbor (NN) interatomic exchange
coupling (J1) is found to be strongly antiferromagnetic (AFM), while 2nd NN
couplings are relatively weaker ferromagnetic (FM), making this system a
candidate for 1D non-frustrated antiferromagnetic spin-chain family of
materials. Based on orbital resolved interactions, we demonstrated the reason
behind two different types of interactions among 1st and 2nd NN despite their
very similar bond lengths. We observe a significant spin-orbit coupling effect,
giving rise to a finite magneto crystalline anisotropy, and
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. Further, we found that by applying
uniaxial tensile strain along crystallographic a and b-axis, LaCrS3 exhibits a
magnetic transition to a semi-conducting FM ground state, while compression
gives rise to the realization of novel gapless semiconducting antiferromagnetic
ground state.

<h3>Phase diagram and critical behavior of Hubbard model on the  square-hexagon-octagon lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00258" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00258</a>
<br>
<i>Xinwei Jia, Dao-Xin Yao, Han-Qing Wu</i>
<p>Employing the projective formalism of determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC)
simulations, we meticulously explore the ground-state phase diagram and
critical behavior of the half-filled Hubbard model on a square-hexagon-octagon
(SHO) lattice. This lattice, a two-dimensional (2D) structure comprising
squares, hexagons, and octagons, is representative of the biphenylene network
(BPN). Our findings reveal an intriguing ground-state phase diagram, featuring
an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulating phase enveloped by three
valence-bond solid-like (VBS-like) insulating phases. Analyzing the
single-particle gap, spin gap, and single-particle spectral function, we
observe that the metallic state in the noninteracting case becomes unstable
under the influence of Hubbard U. This interaction drives the system into a
hexagon insulating phase before transitioning into an AFM Mott insulating
phase. To quantify the critical exponents, we use finite-size scaling
techniques. The critical exponents of quantum critical points between the AFM
Mott insulating phase and two insulating phases, plaquette insulator and
ethylene insulator, closely align with the 3D O(3) universality class. However,
the critical exponents of quantum critical points between the hexagon
insulating phase and the AFM Mott insulating phase deviate from the 3D O(3)
universality class. This deviation is a finite-size effect and can be
attributed to the coupling between the fluctuations of magnetic order parameter
and very low-energy fermionic excitations. Our comprehensive study not only
advances the understanding of correlation effects on the SHO lattice but also
sheds light on the less-explored critical exponents in weakly insulating
quantum critical point.

<h3>An unconventional platform for two-dimensional Kagome flat bands on  semiconductor surfaces</h3>

<br>
<i>Jae Hyuck Lee, GwanWoo Kim, Inkyung Song, Yejin Kim, Yeonjae Lee, Sung Jong Yoo, Deok-Yong Cho, Jun-Won Rhim, Jongkeun Jung, Gunn Kim, Changyoung Kim</i>
<p>In condensed matter physics, the Kagome lattice and its inherent flat bands
have attracted considerable attention for their potential to host a variety of
exotic physical phenomena. Despite extensive efforts to fabricate thin films of
Kagome materials aimed at modulating the flat bands through electrostatic
gating or strain manipulation, progress has been limited. Here, we report the
observation of a novel $d$-orbital hybridized Kagome-derived flat band in
Ag/Si(111) $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ as revealed by angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy. Our findings indicate that silver atoms on a silicon substrate
form a Kagome-like structure, where a delicate balance in the hopping
parameters of the in-plane $d$-orbitals leads to destructive interference,
resulting in a flat band. These results not only introduce a new platform for
Kagome physics but also illuminate the potential for integrating
metal-semiconductor interfaces into Kagome-related research, thereby opening a
new avenue for exploring ideal two-dimensional Kagome systems.

<h3>Quadratic scaling path integral molecular dynamics for fictitious  identical particles and its application to fermion systems</h3>

<i>Yunuo Xiong, Shujuan Liu, Hongwei Xiong</i>
<p>Recently, fictitious identical particles have provided a promising way to
overcome the fermion sign problem and have been used in path integral Monte
Carlo (PIMC) to accurately simulate warm dense matter with up to 1000 electrons
(T. Dornheim et al., arXiv:2311.08098 (2023)). The inclusion of fictitious
identical particles in path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) can provide
another way to simulate fermion systems. In a recent paper (J. Chem. Phys. 159,
154107 (2023)), Feldman and Hirshberg improved the recursive formula for PIMD
of N identical bosons, significantly reducing the computational complexity from
$O(PN^3)$ to $O(N^2+PN)$. In this paper, we extend this latest recursive
formula for bosons to PIMD of fictitious identical particles to improve the
efficiency of simulating fermion systems. We also provide the virial estimator
for calculating energy by using the recursive technique. As an example, we use
the quadratic scaling PIMD for fictitious identical particles to study the
simulation of hundreds of fermions in a two-dimensional periodic potential, in
the hope of providing a simulation tool for two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model
and other strongly correlated fermion systems, such as the simulation of
ultracold fermionic gases in optical lattices.

<p>The collective behavior of the shortest DNA oligomers in high concentration
aqueous solutions is an unexplored frontier of DNA science and technology. Here
we broaden the realm of DNA nanoscience by demonstrating that single-component
aqueous solutions of the DNA 4-base oligomer GCCG can spontaneously organize
into three-dimensional (3D) periodic mesoscale frameworks. This oligomer can
form B-type double helices by Watson-Crick (WC) pairing, into tiled
brickwork-like duplex strands, which arrange into mutually parallel arrays and
form the nematic and columnar liquid crystal phases, as is typical for long WC
chains. However, at DNA concentrations above 400mg/mL, these solutions nucleate
and grow an additional mesoscale framework phase, comprising a periodic network
on a three dimensional body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice. This lattice is an
array of nodes (valence-8, each formed by a pair of quadruplexes of GCCG
terminal Gs), connected with a separation of 6.6 nm by struts (6-GCCG-long WC
duplexes). This 3D-ordered DNA framework is of low density (DNA volume fraction
~0.2), but, due to its 3D crystal structure, is osmotically incompressible over
its phase range. Atomistic simulations confirm the stability of such
structures, which promise to form the basis of novel families of simply and
inexpensively made nanoscale frameworks for templating and selection
applications.

<h3>Pairing Symmetry and Fermion Projective Symmetry Groups</h3>

<p>The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory is very successful in describing the pairing
symmetry, a fundamental characterization of the broken symmetries in a paired
superfluid or superconductor. However, GL theory does not describe fermionic
excitations such as Bogoliubov quasiparticles or Andreev bound states that are
directly related to topological properties of the superconductor. In this work,
we show that the symmetries of the fermionic excitations are captured by a
Projective Symmetry Group (PSG), which is a group extension of the bosonic
symmetry group in the superconducting state. We further establish a
correspondence between the pairing symmetry and the fermion PSG. When the
normal and superconducting states share the same spin rotational symmetry,
there is a simpler correspondence between the pairing symmetry and the fermion
PSG, which we enumerate for all 32 crystalline point groups. We also discuss
the general framework for computing PSGs when the spin rotational symmetry is
spontaneously broken in the superconducting state. This PSG formalism leads to
experimental consequences, and as an example, we show how a given pairing
symmetry dictates the classification of topological superconductivity.

<h3>Direct observation of split-mode exciton-polaritons in a single MoS$_2$  nanotube</h3>

<p>A single nanotube synthesized from a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC)
exhibits strong exciton resonances and, in addition, can support optical
whispering gallery modes. This combination is promising for observing
exciton-polaritons without an external cavity. However, traditional
energy-momentum-resolved detection methods are unsuitable for this tiny object.
Instead, we propose to use split optical modes in a twisted nanotube with the
flattened cross-section, where a gradually decreasing gap between the opposite
walls leads to a change in mode energy, similar to the effect of the barrier
width on the eigenenergies in the double-well potential. Using
micro-reflectance spectroscopy, we investigated the rich pattern of polariton
branches in single MoS$_2$ tubes with both variable and constant gaps. Observed
Rabi splitting in the 40 - 60 meV range is comparable to that for a MoS$_2$
monolayer in a microcavity. Our results, based on the polariton dispersion
measurements and polariton dynamics analysis, present a single TMDC nanotube as
a perfect polaritonic structure for nanophotonics.

<h3>From Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall Smectics to Polar Smectic Metals:  Nontrivial Interplay Between Electronic Liquid Crystal Order and Topological  Order in Correlated Topological Flat Bands</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00363" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00363</a>
<br>
<i>Hongyu Lu, Han-Qing Wu, Bin-Bin Chen, Kai Sun, Zi Yang Meng</i>
<p>Integer or fractional quantum Hall crystals, states postulating the
coexistence of charge order with integer or fractional quantum Hall effect,
have long been proposed in theoretical studies in Landau levels. Inspired by
recent experiments on integer or fractional quantum anomalous Hall (IQAH/FQAH)
states in MoTe2 and rhombohedral multilayer graphene, this work examines the
archetypal correlated flat band model on a checkerboard lattice at filling
{\nu} = 2/3. Interestingly, at this filling level, we find that this
topological flatband does not stabilize conventional FQAH states. Instead, the
unique interplay between smectic charge order and topological order gives rise
to two intriguing quantum states. As the interaction strength increases, the
system first transitions from a Fermi liquid into FQAH smectic (FQAHS) states,
where FQAH topological order coexists cooperatively with smectic charge order.
With a further increase in interaction strength, the system undergoes another
quantum phase transition and evolves into a polar smectic metal. Contrary to
conventional smectic order and FQAHS states, this gapless state spontaneously
breaks the two-fold rotational symmetry, resulting in a nonzero electric dipole
moment and ferroelectric order. In addition to identifying the ground states,
large-scale numerical simulations are also used to study low-energy excitations
and thermodynamic characteristics. We find that FQAHS states exhibit two
distinct temperature scales: the onset of charge order and the onset of the
fractional Hall plateau, respectively. Interestingly, the latter is dictated by
charge-neutral low-energy excitations with finite momenta, known as
magnetorotons. Our studies suggest that these nontrivial phenomena could, in
principle, be accessed in future experiments with moir\'e systems.

<h3>Quenched dynamics and pattern formation in clean and disordered  Bogoliubov-de Gennes superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00372" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00372</a>
<br>
<i>Bo Fan, Antonio M. García-García</i>
<p>We study the quench dynamics of a two dimensional superconductor in a lattice
of size up to $200\times 200$ employing the self-consistent time dependent
Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism. In the clean limit, the dynamics of the
order parameter for short times, characterized by a fast exponential growth and
an oscillatory pattern, agrees with the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)
prediction. However, unlike BCS, we observe for longer times an universal
exponential decay of these time oscillations that we show explicitly to be
induced by the full emergence of spatial inhomogeneities of the order
parameter, even in the clean limit, characterized by the exponential growth of
its variance. The addition of a weak disorder does not alter these results
qualitatively. In this region, the spatial inhomogeneities rapidly develops
into an intricate spatial structure consisting of ordered fragmented stripes in
perpendicular directions where the order parameter is heavily suppressed
especially in the central region. As the disorder strength increases, the
fragmented stripes gradually turn into a square lattice of approximately
circular spatial regions where the condensate is heavily suppressed. A further
increase of disorder leads to the deformation and ultimate destruction of this
lattice. We explore suitable settings for the experimental confirmation of
these findings.

<h3>Magnon, doublon and quarton excitations in 2D trimerized Heisenberg  models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00376" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00376</a>
<br>
<i>Yue-Yue Chang, Jun-Qing Cheng, Hui Shao, Dao-Xin Yao, Han-Qing Wu</i>
<p>We investigate the magnetic excitations of the trimerized Heisenberg models
with intra-trimer interaction $J_1$ and inter-trimer interaction $J_2$ on four
different two-dimensional lattices using a combination of stochastic series
expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE QMC) and stochastic analytic continuation
methods (SAC), complemented by cluster perturbation theory (CPT). These models
exhibit quasi-particle-like excitations when $g=J_2/J_1$ is small,
characterized by low-energy magnons, intermediate-energy doublons, and
high-energy quartons. The low-energy magnons are associated with the magnetic
ground states. They can be described by the linear spin wave theory (LSWT) of
the effective block spin model and the original spin model. Doublons and
quartons emerge from the corresponding internal excitations of the trimers with
distinct energy levels, which can be effectively analyzed using perturbation
theory when the ratio of exchange interactions $g$ is small. In this small $g$
regime, we observe a clear separation between the magnon and higher-energy
spectra. However, as $g$ increases, these three spectra gradually merge into
the magnon modes or continua. Nevertheless, the LSWT fails to provide
quantitative descriptions of the higher-energy excitation bands due to
significant quantum fluctuations. Notably, in the Collinear II and trimerized
hexagon lattice, a broad continuum emerges above the single-magnon spectrum,
originating from the quasi-1D physics due to the dilute connections between
chains. Our numerical analysis of these 2D trimers yields valuable theoretical
predictions and explanations for the inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectra
of 2D magnetic materials featuring trimerized lattices.

<h3>Magnetic Anisotropy of Quantum Critical Fluctuation in  YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ at High Magnetic Fields of up to 100 T</h3>

<p>The investigation of high-temperature superconductors under high magnetic
fields is one of the most important topics in condensed matter physics. For
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO), the measurements of magnetoresistance under a high
magnetic field are technically challenging because the required magnetic field
($B$) is 100 T class. The low temperature (from 52 to 150 K) magnetoresistance
is measured in optimally-doped YBCO thin films under the condition
$B$$\parallel$CuO$_2$-plane up to 103 T by employing the single-turn coil
technique and a radio frequency reflection method. The electrical resistivity
$\rho$ exhibits $B$-linear behavior in the normal phase in the high magnetic
field region. The field slope coefficient $\beta$ (=$d\rho/dB$) becomes
converged at low temperatures. The convergency of $\beta$ below $T_c$ indicates
the field-induced strange metal phase, which is determined by the quantum
critical fluctuation at high magnetic fields. The $\beta$ value difference
under the different directions of the magnetic field suggests the strong
anisotropy in quantum critical fluctuations in the strange metal phase of YBCO.

<h3>Electrical and thermal transport properties of kagome metals AV3Sb5  (A=K, Rb, Cs)</h3>

<i>Xinrun Mi, Kunya Yang, Yuhan Gan, Long Zhang, Aifeng Wang, Yisheng Chai, Xiaoyuan Zhou, Mingquan He</i>
<p>The interplay between lattice geometry, band topology and electronic
correlations in the newly discovered kagome compounds AV3Sb5 (A=K, Rb, Cs)
makes this family a novel playground to investigate emergent quantum phenomena,
such as unconventional superconductivity, chiral charge density wave and
electronic nematicity. These exotic quantum phases naturally leave nontrivial
fingerprints in transport properties of AV3Sb5, both in electrical and thermal
channels, which are prominent probes to uncover the underlying mechanisms. In
this brief review, we highlight the unusual electrical and thermal transport
properties observed in the unconventional charge ordered state of AV3Sb5,
including giant anomalous Hall, anomalous Nernst, ambipolar Nernst and
anomalous thermal Hall effects. Connections of these anomalous transport
properties to time-reversal symmetry breaking, topological and multiband
fermiology, as well as electronic nematicity, are also discussed. Finally, a
perspective together with challenges of this rapid growing field are given.

<h3>Toward the theoretically observable limit of electron density  distribution by single-crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction: The case of  orbitally ordered Ti-3d^1 in YTiO_3</h3>

<p>The theoretically observable limit of electron density distribution by
single-crystal X-ray diffraction is discussed. When F_{orb} and {\delta}F are
defined as, respectively, the partial structure factor for an orbital and the
deviation of the observed F from the true F, the accuracy of the experimentally
observed electron density distribution is chiefly determined by the number of
reflections satisfying the condition F_{orb}/F > {\delta}F/F. Since F_{orb}/F,
which is generally small for crystals with large F(0,0,0), is constant under a
given set of experimental conditions, {\delta}F/F reduction is a unique
approach to increasing the number of reflections satisfying F_{orb}/F >
{\delta}F/F. The present paper demonstrates how to reduce {\delta}F
mathematically and experimentally, and the following topics are covered: the
Poisson statistics, accumulation of errors in the total measurement system,
multiple diffraction, conversion error from F^2 to F in refinements on
quantities in F^2-space, weighting of reflections, and tips. For demonstration,
observation of the electron density of the Ti-3d^1 orbital in YTiO_3 by
synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction is presented.

<h3>Magnetic order and strongly-correlated effects in the one-dimensional  Ising-Kondo lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00432" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00432</a>
<br>
<i>Xiaofan Zhou, Jingtao Fan, Suotang Jia</i>
<p>We investigate the magnetic order and related strongly-correlated effects in
an one-dimensional Ising-Kondo lattice with transverse field. This model is the
anisotropic limit of the conventional isotropic Kondo lattice model, in the
sense that the itinerant electrons interact with the localized magnetic moments
via only longitudinal Kondo exchange. Adopting the numerical
density-matrix-renormalization group method, we map out the ground-state phase
diagram in various parameter spaces. Depending on the Kondo coupling and
filling number, three distinct phases, including a metallic paramagnetic, a
metallic ferromagnetic, and a gapped spin-density wave phase, are obtained. The
spin-density wave is characterized by an ordering wave vector which coincides
with the nesting wave vector of the Fermi surface. This makes the corresponding
magnetic transition a spin analog of the Peierls transition occurring in the
one-dimensional metal. Moreover, by analyzing the momentum distribution
function and charge correlation function, the conduction electrons are shown to
behave like free spinless fermions in the ferromagnetic phase. We finally
discuss the effect of the repulsive Hubbard interaction between conduction
electrons. Our work enriches the Kondo physics and deepens the current
understanding of the heavy fermion compounds.

<br>
<i>Esita Pandey, Shaktiranjan Mohanty, Abhisek Mishra, Bhuvneshwari Sharma, Subhankar Bedanta</i>
<p>The successful commercialization of flexible spintronic devices requires a
complete understanding of the impact of external strain on the structural,
electronic, and magnetic properties of a system. The impact of bending-induced
strain on flexible films is studied quite well. However, little is known about
the effect of other modes of flexibility, e.g., wrinkling, twisting, peeling,
and stretching on the functional properties of flexible films. In this context,
perpendicular magnetic anisotropic Co/Pt and Co/Pd thin films are prepared on
flexible Kapton substrates, and the impact of the peeling mode is studied in
detail. The peeling method generates numerous cracks, and buckling in the thin
film, along with localized blister formation imaged by scanning electron
microscopy. Further, the resistivity measurement confirms a significant
enhancement in sample resistance owing to the severe damage of the films. The
structural discontinuities strongly affect the magnetization reversal phenomena
as measured by the magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE)-based microscopy. The
bubble domains got converted to elongated-shaped domains due to several
hindrances to the wall motion after strain application. Further, the relaxation
measurements reveal that the thermal energy is insufficient to switch the
magnetization at a few areas due to their high pinning potential associated
with the damages. In contrast to bending-induced strain, here, all the
modifications in the functional properties are found to be irreversible in
nature.

<h3>Magnetic properties at various fillings of the quasiflat band in a  fermionic two-leg ladder model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00483" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00483</a>
<br>
<i>Paban Kumar Patra, Yixuan Huang, Hridis K. Pal</i>
<p>A recent study has demonstrated that a fermionic two-leg ladder model,
threaded by a flux and characterized by a spatially varying interleg hopping
term, gives rise to a quasiflat low-energy band. This band exhibits an unusual
ground state at half filling in the presence of interaction -- a ferromagnetic
Mott insulator. In this paper, we extend the study of this model to other
fillings of the quasiflat band and explore the magnetic properties of the
ground state at these fillings. In particular, we study four fillings:
one-quarter, three-quarters, slightly above half filling (half filling plus two
electrons), and slightly below half-filling (half filling minus two electrons).
Incorporating interaction within the Hubbard model and using the Density Matrix
Renormalization Group method to find the ground states, we find that the
spin-spin correlation is ferromagnetic at fillings less than half, similar to
that observed at half filling, but is antiferromagnetic beyond half filling.
Interestingly, these results hold only when mixing between the lowest quasiflat
band and the next-to-lowest dispersive band is negligible; once mixing between
the two bands is facilitated by increasing the interaction strength, the
correlation becomes ferromagnetic above half filling as well. Additionally, by
reducing the strength of the interaction in comparison to the bandwidth, a
transition from the ferromagnetic to the antiferromagnetic state is observed in
all the cases.

<h3>Molecular Hybridization Induced Antidamping and Sizable Enhanced  Spin-to-Charge Conversion in Co20Fe60B20/$β$-W/C60 Heterostructures</h3>

<i>Antarjami Sahoo, Aritra Mukhopadhyaya, Swayang Priya Mahanta, Md. Ehesan Ali, Subhankar Bedanta</i>
<p>Development of power efficient spintronics devices has been the compelling
need in the post-CMOS technology era. The effective tunability of
spin-orbit-coupling (SOC) in bulk and at the interfaces of hybrid materials
stacking is a prerequisite for scaling down the dimension and power consumption
of these devices. In this work, we demonstrate the strong chemisorption of C60
molecules when grown on the high SOC $\beta$-W layer. The parent CFB/$\beta$-W
bilayer exhibits large spin-to-charge interconversion efficiency, which can be
ascribed to the interfacial SOC observed at the Ferromagnet/Heavy metal
interface. Further, the adsorption of C60 molecules on $\beta$-W reduces the
effective Gilbert damping by $\sim$15% in the CFB/$\beta$-W/C60
heterostructures. The anti-damping is accompanied by a gigantic $\sim$115%
enhancement in the spin-pumping induced output voltage owing to the molecular
hybridization. The non-collinear Density Functional Theory calculations confirm
the long-range enhancement of SOC of $\beta$-W upon the chemisorption of C60
molecules, which in turn can also enhance the SOC at the CFB/$\beta$-W
interface in CFB/$\beta$-W/C60 heterostructures. The combined amplification of
bulk as well interfacial SOC upon molecular hybridization stabilizes the
anti-damping and enhanced spin-to-charge conversion, which can pave the way for
the fabrication of power efficient spintronics devices.

<i>Swayang Priya Mahanta, Antarjami Sahoo, Sagarika Nayak, T. P. A. Hase, Del Atkinson, Subhankar Bedanta</i>
<p>Organic semiconductors (OSCs) are suitable materials for spintronics
applications as they form a spinterface when placed next to a ferromagnet,
which in turn leads to novel functionalities. The evolution of spinterface can
tune the global magnetic anisotropy, magnetization reversal, magnetization
dynamics, etc. Planar tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum (Alq3) OSC has shown
tremendous potential for spintronics applications, thanks to its efficient
spin-polarized current transport ability. Here, we establish the spinterface
when the Alq3 molecules are deposited on amorphous ferromagnet
Co20Fe60B20(CFB). The $\pi$-d hybridization in CFB/Alq3 enhances the coercive
field and significantly modifies the shape and size of the magnetic domains. A
$\sim$100% increase in uniaxial anisotropic energies and a reduction in
magnetic damping are also evident owing to the strong interfacial
hybridization.

<p>By virtue of being atomically thin, the electronic properties of
heterostructures built from two-dimensional materials are strongly influenced
by atomic relaxation where the atomic layers should be thought of as membranes
rather than rigid 2D crystals. We develop an analytical treatment of lattice
relaxation for twisted 2D moir\'e materials obtaining semi-analytical results
for lattice displacements, real and momentum space moir\'e potentials,
pseudomagnetic fields and electronic band structures. We benchmark our results
for twisted bilayer graphene and twisted homobilayers of tungsten diselenide
using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations finding that our theory is
valid for magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (angles $\gtrsim 1^\circ$), and
for twisted TMDs for twist angles $\gtrsim$ 7 degrees.

<h3>Higher-Order Cellular Automata Generated Symmetry-Protected Topological  Phases and Detection Through Multi-Point Strange Correlators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00505" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00505</a>
<br>
<i>Jie-Yu Zhang, Meng-Yuan Li, Peng Ye</i>
<p>Higher-order cellular automata (HOCA) are a type of cellular automata that
evolve over multiple time steps. These HOCA generate intricate patterns within
the spacetime lattice, which can be utilized to create symmetry-protected
topological (SPT) phases. The symmetries of these phases are not global, but
act on lower-dimensional subsystems of the lattice, such as lines or fractals.
These are referred to as HOCA generated SPT (HGSPT) phases. These phases
naturally encompass previously studied phases with subsystem symmetries,
including symmetry-protected topological phases protected by symmetries
supported on regular (e.g., line-like, membrane-like) and fractal subsystems.
Moreover, these phases include models with subsystem symmetries that extend
beyond previously studied phases. They include mixed-subsystem SPT (MSPT) that
possess two types of subsystem symmetries simultaneously (for example, fractal
and line-like subsystem symmetries or two different fractal symmetries), and
chaotic SPT (CSPT) that have chaos-like symmetries, beyond the classification
of fractal or regular subsystems. We propose that each HOCA pattern with a
finite initial condition can be represented by a mathematical object $X=(d,M)$,
and HOCA rules $\mathbf{f}$ can be categorized into different classes
$[\mathbf{f}]$ based on the pattern that the rule can generate. The class of
the HOCA rule of a given HGSPT can be identified by what we dub as the
multi-point strange correlator, as a generalization of the strange correlator.
We have raised a general procedure to construct multi-point strange correlators
to detect the nontrivial SPT orders in the gapped ground states of HGSPT models
and the their classes.

<i>Ipsita Mandal</i>
<p>We consider a Josephson junction built with the two-dimensional semi-Dirac
semimetal, which features a hybrid of linear and quadratic dispersion around a
nodal point. We model the weak link between the two superconducting regions by
a Dirac delta potential because it mimics the thin-barrier limit of a
superconductor-barrier-superconductor configuration. Assuming a homogeneous
pairing in each region, we set up the BdG formalism for electronlike and
holelike quasiparticles propagating along the quadratic-in-momentum dispersion
direction. This allows us to compute the discrete bound-state energy spectrum
$\varepsilon $ of the subgap Andreev states localized at the junction. In
contrast with the Josephson effect investigated for propagation along linearly
dispersing directions, we find a pair of doubly degenerate Andreev bound
states. Using the dependence of $\varepsilon $ on the superconducting phase
difference $\phi$, we compute the variation of Josephson current as a function
of $\phi$.

<br>
<i>Hangyu Zhou, Manuel dos Santos Dias, Youguang Zhang, Weisheng Zhao, Samir Lounis</i>
<p>The kagome lattice is an exciting solid state physics platform for the
emergence of nontrivial quantum states driven by electronic correlations:
topological effects, unconventional superconductivity, charge and spin density
waves, and unusual magnetic states such as quantum spin liquids. While kagome
lattices have been realized in complex multi-atomic bulk compounds, here we
demonstrate from first-principles a process that we dub kagomerization, in
which we fabricate a two-dimensional kagome lattice in monolayers of transition
metals utilizing a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) overlayer. Surprisingly, h-BN
induces a large rearrangement of the transition metal atoms supported on a
fcc(111) heavy-metal surface. This reconstruction is found to be rather generic
for this type of heterostructures and has a profound impact on the underlying
magnetic properties, ultimately stabilizing various topological magnetic
solitons such as skyrmions and bimerons. Our findings call for a
reconsideration of h-BN as merely a passive capping layer, showing its
potential for not only reconstructing the atomic structure of the underlying
material, e.g. through the kagomerization of magnetic films, but also enabling
electronic and magnetic phases that are highly sought for the next generation
of device technologies.

<h3>Proximal quantum control of spin and spin ensemble with highly localized  control field from skyrmions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00573" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00573</a>
<br>
<i>Md Fahim F Chowdhury, Mohamad Niknam, Md Mahadi Rajib, Louis S. Bouchard, Jayasimha Atulasimha</i>
<p>Selective control of individual spin qubits is needed for scalable quantum
computing based on spin states. Achieving high-fidelity in both single and
two-qubit gates, essential components of universal quantum computers,
necessitates highly localized control fields. These fields must be capable of
addressing specific spin qubits while minimizing gate errors and cross-talk in
adjacent qubits. Overcoming the challenge of generating a localized
radio-frequency magnetic field, in the absence of elementary magnetic
monopoles, we introduce a technique that combines divergent and convergent
nanoscale magnetic skyrmions. This approach produces a precise control field
that manipulates spin qubits with high fidelity. We propose the use of 2D
skyrmions, which are 2D analogues of 3D hedgehog structures. The latter are
emergent magnetic monopoles, but difficult to fabricate. The 2D skyrmions, on
the other hand, can be fabricated using standard semiconductor foundry
processes. Our comparative analysis of the density matrix evolution and gate
fidelities in scenarios involving proximal skyrmions and nanomagnets indicates
potential gate fidelities surpassing 99.95% for {\pi}/2-gates and 99.90% for
{\pi}-gates. Notably, the skyrmion configuration generates a significantly
lower field on neighboring spin qubits, i.e. 15 times smaller field on a
neighboring qubit compared to nanomagnets that produces the same field at the
controlled qubit, making it a more suitable candidate for scalable quantum
control architectures by reducing disturbances in adjacent qubits.

<p>We present measurements and theoretical modeling demonstrating the capability
of Doppler Broadened annihilation gamma Spectroscopy (DBS) to provide
element-specific information from the topmost atomic layer of surfaces that are
either clean or covered with adsorbates or thin films. Our measurements show
that the energy spectra of Doppler-shifted annihilation gamma photons emitted
following the annihilation of positrons from the topmost atomic layers of clean
gold (Au) and copper (Cu) differ significantly. With the aid of the positron
annihilation-induced Auger electron spectroscopy (PAES) performed
simultaneously with DBS, we show that measurable differences between the
Doppler broadened gamma spectra from Au and Cu surfaces in the high energy
region of the gamma spectra can be used for the quantification of surface
chemical composition. Modeling the measured Doppler spectra from clean Au and
Cu surfaces using gamma spectra obtained from ab initio calculations after
considering the detector energy resolution and surface positronium formation
pointed to an increase in the relative contribution of gamma from positron
annihilation with valence shell electrons. The fit result also suggests that
the surface-trapped positrons predominantly annihilated with the delocalized
valence shell (s and p) electrons that extended into the vacuum as compared to
the highly localized d electrons. Simultaneous DBS and PAES measurements from
adsorbate (sulfur, oxygen, carbon) or thin film (selenium (Se), graphene)
covered Cu surface showed that it is possible to distinguish and quantify the
surface adsorbate and thin-film composition just based on DBS. DBS of elemental
surfaces presents a promising avenue for developing a characterization tool
that can be used to probe external and internal surfaces that are inaccessible
by conventional surface science techniques.

<h3>High magnetic field phase diagram and weak FM breaking in  (Ni0.93Co0.07)3V2O8</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00646" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00646</a>

<i>Jiating Wu, Minjie Zhang, Ke Shi, Huxin Yin, Yuyan Han, Lansheng Ling, Wei Tong, Chuanying Xi, Li Pi, Zhaosheng Wang</i>
<p>We present magnetostriction and thermal expansion measurements on
multiferroic (Ni0.93Co0.07)3V2O8. The high field phase diagrams up to 33 T
along the a, b and c directions are built. For H//a, as the magnetic field
increases, two intermediate phases appear between the incommensurate phase and
the paramagnetic phase at about 7 K, and then a magnetically induced phase
appears above the paramagnetic phase. For H//b,thermal expansion measurement
indicates a mutation in the spin lattice coupling of the high field phases. The
interlaced phase boundary suggests a mixed state in the optical high field
phase. For H//c, an intermediate phase between the commensurate phase and the
incommensurate phase is detected. A nonlinear boundary between the intermediate
phase and the low temperature incommensurate phase, and a clear boundary
between the commensurate phase and the paramagnetic phase are found. These
results indicate that doping Co2+ breaks the weak ferromagnetic moment of the
commensurate phase, which exists in the parent compound Ni3V2O8 and
(Ni0.9Co0.1)3V2O8. This nonlinear influence reflects complicated spin
modulation in Ni3V2O8 by doping Co2+.

<h3>Tuning Thermal Conductivity of Hybrid Perovskites through Halide  Alloying</h3>

<br>
<i>Guang Wang, Hongzhao Fan, Zhongwei Chen, Yufei Gao, Zuankai Wang, Zhigang Li, Haipeng Lu, Yanguang Zhou</i>
<p>Tuning the thermal transport properties of hybrid halide perovskites is
critical for their applications in optoelectronics, thermoelectrics, and
photovoltaics. Here, we demonstrate an effective strategy to modulate the
thermal transport property of hybrid perovskites by halide alloying. A highly
tunable thermal conductivity of mixed-halide hybrid perovskites is achieved due
to halide-alloying and structural distortion. Our experimental measurements
show that the room temperature thermal conductivity of MAPb(BrxI1-x)3 (x = 0-1)
can be largely modulated from 0.27 W/mK (x = 0.5) to 0.47 W/mK (x = 1).
Molecular dynamics simulations further demonstrate that the thermal
conductivity reduction of hybrid halide perovskites results from the
suppression of the mean free paths of the low-frequency acoustic and optical
phonons. It is found that halide alloying and the induced structural distortion
can largely increase the scatterings of optical and acoustic phonons,
respectively. The confined diffusion of MA+ cations in the octahedra cage is
found to act as an additional thermal transport channel in hybrid perovskites
and can contribute around 10-20% of the total thermal conductivity. Our
findings provide a strategy for tailoring the thermal transport in hybrid
halide perovskites which may largely benefit their related applications.

<h3>Biphenylene Nanoribbon as Promising Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen  Evolution</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00674" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00674</a>
<br>
<i>Radha N Somaiya, Zicong Marvin Wong, Brahmananda Chakraborty, Teck Leong Tan, Aftab Alam</i>
<p>Designing efficient, metal free, and in-expensive catalyst for
electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is crucial for large scale
clean and green energy production. Recently synthesized 1D Biphenylene
nanoribbons (BPRs) display few exciting properties originating from the unique
co-existence of 4, 6 and 8 coordinated carbon rings. Here, we present a first
principles calculation of the electronic structure and electrocatalytic
activity of various sized N-BPRs (N indicates the width). The electrocatalytic
performance is evaluated based on several descriptors including electronic
property, carrier mobility, Gibbs free energy ($\Delta$G$_{HER}$), exchange
current density etc. The electronic properties are crucially sensitive to the
width (N) of BPRs transiting it from semiconducting to metallic nature at N=18.
The p$_z$ orbitals of C-atoms from the central tetragonal rings are mainly
responsible for the decrease in band gap with increasing width. The room
temperature electron mobility is found to be as high as $\sim6.3\times$10$^4$
cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, while hole mobility is relatively lower in magnitude.
Gibbs free energy also depends sensitively on the width of BPRs as evident from
the p-band center analysis. We propose 15-BPR as the most promising candidate
for electrocatalytic activity with extremely small overpotential
($\approx$0.005 V) and a high exchange current density, much better than the
state-of-the-art Pt(111). A close inspection of the elementary reactions of HER
(Volmer, Heyrovsky and Tafel) confirms Volmer-Tafel mechanism to be most
dominant on 15-BPR with Tafel as the rate-determining step with a barrier of
0.56 eV. The present study provides a deeper insight into the excellent HER
catalytic activity of a newly synthesized BPR which is inexpensive and is
expected to hasten experimental validation towards H$_2$ production.

<h3>Nonlinear charge transport induced by gate voltage oscillation in  few-layer MnBi2Te4</h3>

<br>
<i>Liangcai Xu, Zichen Lian, Yongchao Wang, Xinlei Hao, Shuai Yang, Chang Liu, Yang Feng, Yayu Wang, Jinsong Zhang</i>
<p>Nonlinear charge transport, including nonreciprocal longitudinal resistance
and nonlinear Hall effect, has garnered significant attention due to its
ability to explore inherent symmetries and topological properties of novel
materials. An exciting recent progress along this direction is the discovery of
significant nonreciprocal longitudinal resistance and nonlinear Hall effect in
the intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 induced by the quantum
metric dipole. Given the importance of this finding, the inconsistent response
with charge density, and conflicting requirement of C3z symmetry, it is
imperative to elucidate every detail that may impact the nonlinear transport
measurement. In this study, we reveal an intriguing experimental factor that
inevitably gives rise to sizable nonlinear transport signal in MnBi2Te4. We
demonstrate that this effect stems from the gate voltage oscillation caused by
the application of a large alternating current to the sample. Furthermore, we
propose a methodology to significantly suppress this effect by individually
grounding the voltage electrodes during the second-harmonic measurements. Our
investigation emphasizes the critical importance of thoroughly assessing the
impact of gate voltage oscillation before determining the intrinsic nature of
nonlinear transport in all 2D material devices with an electrically connected
operative gate electrode.

<h3>A Temporal Filter to Extract Doped Conducting Polymer Information  Features from an Electronic Nose</h3>

<i>Wiem Haj Ammar, Aicha Boujnah, Antoine Baron, Aimen Boubaker, Adel Kalboussi, Kamal Lmimouni, Sebastien Pecqueur</i>
<p>Identifying relevant machine-learning features for multi-sensing platforms is
both an applicative limitation to recognize environments and a necessity to
interpret the physical relevance of transducers' complementarity in their
information processing. Particularly for long acquisitions, feature extraction
must be fully automatized without human intervention and resilient to
perturbations without increasing significantly the computational cost of a
classifier. In this study, we investigate on the relative resistance and
current modulation of a 24-dimensional conductimetric electronic nose, which
uses the exponential moving average as a floating reference in a low-cost
information descriptor for environment recognition. In particular, we
identified that depending on the structure of a linear classifier, the 'modema'
descriptor is optimized for different material sensing elements' contributions
to classify information patterns. The low-pass filtering optimization leads to
opposite behaviors between unsupervised and supervised learning: the latter one
favors longer integration of the reference, allowing to recognize five
different classes over 90%, while the first one prefers using the latest events
as its reference to clusterize patterns by environment nature. Its electronic
implementation shall greatly diminish the computational requirements of
conductimetric electronic noses for on-board environment recognition without
human supervision.

<h3>Steering of vortices by magnetic-field tilting in superconductor  nanotubes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00712" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00712</a>
<br>
<i>Igor Bogush, Oleksandr V. Dobrovolskiy, Vladimir M. Fomin</i>
<p>In planar superconductor thin films, the places of nucleation and
arrangements of moving vortices are determined by structural defects. However,
various applications of superconductors require reconfigurable steering of
fluxons, which is hard to realize with geometrically predefined vortex pinning
landscapes. Here, on the basis of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation,
we present an approach for steering of vortex chains and vortex jets in
superconductor nanotubes containing a slit. The idea is based on tilting of the
magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ at an angle $\alpha$ in the plane perpendicular to
the axis of a nanotube carrying an azimuthal transport current. Namely, while
at $\alpha=0^\circ$ vortices move paraxially in opposite directions within each
half-tube, an increase of $\alpha$ displaces the areas with the
close-to-maximum normal component $|B_\mathrm{n}|$ to the
close(opposite)-to-slit regions, giving rise to descending (ascending) branches
in the induced-voltage frequency spectrum $f_\mathrm{U}(\alpha)$. At lower $B$,
upon reaching the critical angle $\alpha_\mathrm{c}$, close-to-slit vortex
chains disappear, yielding $f_\mathrm{U}$ of the $nf_1$-type ($n\geq1$: an
integer; $f_1$: vortex nucleation frequency). At higher $B$, $f_\mathrm{U}$ is
largely blurry because of multifurcations of vortex trajectories, leading to
the coexistence of a vortex jet with two vortex chains at $\alpha=90^\circ$. In
addition to prospects for tuning of GHz-frequency spectra and steering of
vortices as information bits, our findings lay foundations for on-demand tuning
of vortex arrangements in 3D superconductor membranes in tilted magnetic
fields.

<h3>Calculation of Gilbert damping and magnetic moment of inertia using  torque-torque correlation model within ab initio Wannier framework</h3>

<br>
<i>Robin Bajaj, Seung-Cheol Lee, H. R. Krishnamurthy, Satadeep Bhattacharjee, Manish Jain</i>
<p>Magnetization dynamics in magnetic materials are well described by the
modified semiclassical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, which includes
the magnetic damping $\alpha$ and the magnetic moment of inertia $\mathrm{I}$
tensors as key parameters. Both parameters are material-specific and physically
represent the time scales of damping of precession and nutation in
magnetization dynamics. $\alpha$ and $\mathrm{I}$ can be calculated quantum
mechanically within the framework of the torque-torque correlation model. The
quantities required for the calculation are torque matrix elements, the real
and imaginary parts of the Green's function and its derivatives. Here, we
calculate these parameters for the elemental magnets such as Fe, Co and Ni in
an ab initio framework using density functional theory and Wannier functions.
We also propose a method to calculate the torque matrix elements within the
Wannier framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by comparing
it with the experiments and the previous ab initio and empirical studies and
show its potential to improve our understanding of spin dynamics and to
facilitate the design of spintronic devices.

<i>Di Zhou, Dmitrii V. Semenok, Michele Galasso, Frederico Gil Alabarse, Denis A. Sannikov, Ivan A. Troyan, Yuki Nakamoto, Katsuya Shimizu, Artem R. Oganov</i>
<p>We proposed a new method for synthesis of metal polyhydrides via
high-pressure thermal decomposition of corresponding amidoboranes in diamond
anvil cells. Within this approach, we synthesized molecular semiconducting
cesium ($\textit P4/nmm$-CsH$_7$, $\textit P$1-CsH$_{15+x}$) and rubidium
(RbH$_{9-x}$) polyhydrides with a very high hydrogen content reaching 93 at%.
Preservation of CsH$_7$ at near ambient conditions, confirmed both
experimentally and theoretically, represents a significant advance in the
stabilization of hydrogen-rich compounds. In addition, we synthesized two
crystal modifications of RbH$_{9-x}$ with pseudo hexagonal and pseudo
tetragonal structures identified by synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman
measurements. Both phases are stable at 8-10 GPa. This is an unprecedented low
stabilization pressure for polyhydrides. These discoveries open up
possibilities for modifying existing hydrogen storage materials to increase
their efficiency.

<h3>Nematic Superconductivity and Its Critical Vestigial Phases in the  Quasi-crystal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00750" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00750</a>
<br>
<i>Yu-Bo Liu, Jing Zhou, Fan Yang</i>
<p>We propose a general mechanism to realize nematic superconductivity (SC) and
reveal its exotic vestigial phases in the quasi-crystal (QC). Starting from a
Penrose Hubbard model, our microscopic studies suggest that the Kohn-Luttinger
mechanism driven SC in the QC is usually gapless due to violation of Anderson's
theorem, rendering that both chiral and nematic SCs are common. The nematic SC
in the QC can support novel vestigial phases driven by pairing phase
fluctuations above its $T_c$. Our combined renormalization group and
Monte-Carlo studies provide a phase diagram in which, besides the conventional
charge-4e SC, two critical vestigial phases emerge, i.e. the quasi-nematic
(Q-N) SC and Q-N metal. In the two Q-N phases, the discrete lattice rotation
symmetry is counter-intuitively ``quasi-broken'' with power-law decaying
orientation correlations. They separate the phase diagram into various phases
connected via Brezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions. These
remarkable critical vestigial phases, which resemble the intermediate BKT phase
in the $q$-state ($q\ge 5$) clock model, are consequence of the five- (or
higher-) fold anisotropy field brought about by the unique QC symmetry, which
are absent in conventional crystalline materials.

<h3>Magnon Damping Minimum and Logarithmic Scaling in a Kondo-Heisenberg  Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00758" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00758</a>
<br>
<i>Yuan Gao, Junsen Wang, Qiaoyi Li, Qing-Bo Yan, Tao Shi, Wei Li</i>
<p>Recently, an anomalous temperature evolution of spin wave excitations has
been observed in a van der Waals metallic ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ (FGT) [S.
Bao, et al., Phys. Rev. X 12, 011022 (2022)], whose theoretical understanding
yet remains elusive. Here we study the spin dynamics of a ferromagnetic
Kondo-Heisenberg lattice model at finite temperature, and propose a mechanism
of magnon damping that explains the intriguing experimental results. In
particular, we find the magnon damping rate $\gamma(T)$ firstly decreases as
temperature lowers, due to the reduced magnon-magnon scatterings. It then
reaches a minimum at $T_{\rm d}^*$, and rises up again following a logarithmic
scaling $\gamma(T) \sim \ln{(T_0/T)}$ (with $T_0$ a constant) for $T < T_{\rm
d}^*$, which can be attributed to electron-magnon scatterings of spin-flip
type. Moreover, we obtain the phase diagram containing the ferromagnetic and
Kondo insulator phases by varying the Kondo coupling, which may be relevant for
experiments on pressured FGT. The presence of a magnon damping minimum and
logarithmic scaling at low temperature indicates the emergence of the Kondo
effect reflected in the collective excitations of local moments in a Kondo
lattice system.

<h3>Debye temperature, electron-phonon coupling constant, and  microcrystalline strain in highly-compressed La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-δ}$</h3>

<i>E.F. Talantsev, V.V. Chistyakov</i>
<p>Recently Sun et al (Nature 621, 493 (2023)) reported on the discovery of
high-temperature superconductivity in highly-compressed
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. In addition to ongoing studies of the phase
structural transition, pairing mechanism, and other properties/parameters in
this highly-pressurized nickelate, here explore a possibility for the
electron-phonon pairing mechanism in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. To do
this, we analyzed experimental data on temperature dependent resistance,
$R(T)$, and extracted pressure dependent Debye temperature, $\Theta_D$, for the
$Fmmm$-phase (high-pressure phase). Derived ballpark value is $\Theta_D(P = 25
GPa) = 550$ $K$. We also estimated the electron-phonon coupling constant,
$\lambda_{e-ph}(P=22.4 GPa) = 1.75$, for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ sample
exhibited zero-resistance transition. Performed analysis of XRD data showed
that the crystal lattice strain, $\epsilon(P)$, is higher in the $Fmmm$-phase
in comparison with the $Amam$-phase (low-pressure phase). Based on performed
$\epsilon(P)$ analysis, we proposed possible reason for the presence/absence of
the zero-resistance state in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$.

<h3>A Dyson Brownian motion model for weak measurements in chaotic quantum  systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Federico Gerbino, Pierre Le Doussal, Guido Giachetti, Andrea De Luca</i>
<p>We consider a toy model for the study of monitored dynamics in a many-body
quantum systems. We study the stochastic Schrodinger equation resulting from
the continuous monitoring with a rate $\Gamma$ of a random hermitian operator
chosen at every time from the gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE). Due to
invariance by unitary transformations, the dynamics of the eigenvalues
$\{\lambda_\alpha\}_{\alpha=1}^n$ of the density matrix can be decoupled from
that of the eigenvectors. Thus, stochastic equations are derived that exactly
describe the dynamics of $\lambda$'s. We consider two regimes: in the presence
of an extra dephasing term, which can be generated by imperfect quantum
measurements, the density matrix has a stationary distribution, and we show
that in the limit of large sizes the distribution of $\lambda$'s is described
by an inverse Marchenko Pastur distribution. In the case of perfect
measurements instead, purification eventually occurs and we focus on
finite-time dynamics. In this case, remarkably, we find an exact solution for
the joint probability distribution of $\lambda$'s at each time $t$ and for each
size $n$. Two relevant regimes emerge: at small times $t\Gamma= O(1)$, the
spectrum is in a Coulomb gas regime, with a well-defined continuous spectral
distribution in the limit of $n\to\infty$. In that case, all moments of the
density matrix become self-averaging and it is possible to characterize the
entanglement spectrum exactly. In the limit of large times $t \Gamma = O(n)$
one enters instead a regime in which the eigenvalues are exponentially
separated $\log(\lambda_\alpha/\lambda_\beta) = O(\Gamma t/n)$, but
fluctuations $\sim O(\sqrt{\Gamma t/n})$ play an essential role. We are still
able to characterize the asymptotic behaviors of entanglement entropy in this
regime.

<i>E.F. Talantsev</i>
<p>Experimental discovery of near-room-temperature superconductivity in highly
compressed hydrogen sulfate started a new era in superconductivity. To date,
researchers have made the discovery of dozens of superconducting hydride phases
with transition temperatures above LN2. While the primary focus of the research
in this field is to determine fundamental superconducting parameters of these
superconductors, here we revealed primary applied property of these
superconductors which is the field dependence of transport critical current,
$I_{c}(B,T)$. We analyzed reported $V(I)$ curves for a highly compressed
CeH$_9$ sample with $T_c = 70$ $K$, and showed that this hydride exhibits
practically identical $I_{c}(B,T)$ to HTS 1G-wire
(Bi,Pb)$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{11}$. Additionally, we demonstrated that the
$n$-value in CeH$_9$ superhydride follows a nearly identical dependence on
critical current, as observed in in Nb$_3$Sn conductors.
