<h3>Optical properties of defects in solids via quantum embedding with good  active space orbitals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09668" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09668</a>

<br>
The study of isolated defects in solids is a natural target for classical or
quantum embedding methods that treat the defect at a high level of theory and
the rest of the solid at a lower level of theory. Here, in the context of
active-space-based quantum embeddings, we study the performance of three
active-space orbital selection schemes based on canonical (energy-ordered)
orbitals, local orbitals defined in the spirit of density matrix embedding
theory, and approximate natural transition orbitals. Using equation-of-motion
coupled-cluster theory with single and double excitations (CCSD), we apply
these active space selection schemes to the calculation of the vertical singlet
excitation energy of a substitutional carbon dimer defect in hexagonal boron
nitride, an oxygen vacancy in magnesium oxide, and a carbon vacancy in diamond.
Especially when used in combination with a simple composite correction, we find
that the best performing schemes can predict the excitation energy to about
0.1-0.2 eV of its converged value using only a few hundred orbitals, even when
the full supercell has thousands of orbitals, which amounts to
many-orders-of-magnitude computational savings when using correlated electronic
structure theories. When compared to assigned experimental spectra and
accounting for vibrational corrections, we find that CCSD predicts excitation
energies that are accurate to about 0.1-0.3 eV, which is comparable to its
performance in molecules and bulk solids.

<h3>Renormalization flow of a weak extended backscattering Hamiltonian in a  non-chiral Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10033" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10033</a>
<br>
<i>A. Popoff, A. V. Lebedev, L. Raymond, T. Jonckheere, J. Rech, T. Martin</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider a non-chiral Luttinger liquid in the presence of a backscattering
Hamiltonian which has an extended range. Right/left moving fermions at a given
location can thus be converted as left/right moving fermions at a different
location, within a specific range. We perform a momentum shell renormalization
group treatment which gives the evolution of the relative degrees of freedom of
this Hamiltonian contribution under the renormalization flow, and we study a
few realistic examples of this extended backscattering Hamiltonian. We find
that, for repulsive Coulomb interaction in the Luttinger liquid, any such
Hamiltonian contribution evolves into a delta-like scalar potential upon
renormalization to a zero temperature cutoff. On the opposite, for attractive
couplings, the amplitude of this kinetic Hamiltonian is suppressed, rendering
the junction fully transparent. As the renormalization procedure may have to be
stopped because of experimental constraints such as finite temperature, we
predict the actual spatial shape of the kinetic Hamiltonian at different stages
of the renormalization procedure, as a function of the position and the
Luttinger interaction parameter, and show that it undergoes structural changes.
This renormalized kinetic Hamiltonian has thus to be used as an input for the
perturbative calculation of the current, for which we provide analytic
expressions in imaginary time. We discuss the experimental relevance of this
work by looking at one-dimensional systems consisting of carbon nanotubes or
semiconductor nanowires.

<h3>Pressure-induced nontrivial $Z_2$ band topology and superconductivity in  transition metal chalcogenide $\mathrm{Ta}_2 \mathrm{Ni}_3 \mathrm{Te}_5$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09641" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09641</a>
<br>
<i>Haiyang Yang, Yonghui Zhou, Shuyang Wang, Jing Wang, Xuliang Chen, Lili Zhang, Chenchao Xu, Zhaorong Yang</i>
<br>
<br>
The unique electronic and crystal structures driven by external pressure in
transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) can host emergent quantum states. Here we
report pressure-induced metallization, nontrivial $Z_2$ band topology and
superconductivity in TMC $\mathrm{Ta}_2 \mathrm{Ni}_3 \mathrm{Te}_5$. Our
electrical transport measurements show that the metallization emerges at 3.3
GPa, followed by appearance of the superconductivity at $P_{\mathrm{c}}$ = 21.3
GPa with $T_{\mathrm{c}} \sim$ 0.4 K. Room-temperature synchrotron x-ray
diffraction experiments demonstrate the stability of the pristine orthorhombic
structure upon compression. Our first-principles calculations further reveal a
topological phase transition (from $Z_2=0$ to $Z_2=1$), which occurs after
$\mathrm{Ta}_2 \mathrm{Ni}_3 \mathrm{Te}_5$ is turned into an electron-hole
compensated semimetal by pressure. The pressure-induced superconductivity at
$P_{\mathrm{c}}$ could be attributed to the abruptly enhanced density of states
at the Fermi level. These findings demonstrate that $\mathrm{Ta}_2
\mathrm{Ni}_3 \mathrm{Te}_5$ is a new platform for realizing exotic quantum
phenomena in TMCs, as well as exploring the interplay between topological
property and superconductivity.

<h3>On parametric amplification in Josephson transmission line</h3>

<br>
We consider the series-connected lossy Josephson transmission line (JTL),
constructed basically from Josephson junctions (JJs), capacitors and resistors.
We derive the continuum approximation equation describing the JTL. From the
latter we derive equations describing pump, signal, and idler interaction and
calculate the threshold for the parametric amplification.

<h3>Apparent Kondo effect in Moir√© TMD bilayers: Heavy fermions or  disorder?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09658" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09658</a>
<br>
<i>Prathyush P. Poduval, Katharina Laubscher, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<br>
<br>
A recent work by Zhao et al. [1] reports the realization of a synthetic Kondo
lattice in a gate-tunable Moir\'e TMD bilayer system. The observation of a
Kondo lattice is supported by a plateau (or dip, depending on filling) in the
temperature dependence of the resistivity $\rho(T)$ around $T^*\sim 40~$K,
which is interpreted as the Kondo temperature scale, and an apparent
enhancement of carrier mass extracted from the low-temperature resistivity
data, indicating the emergence of `heavy fermions'. The latter observation is
crucially based on the assumption that the primary resistive scattering
mechanism is Umklapp electron-electron scattering in the underlying Fermi
liquid. In this work, we analyze the experimental data under the assumption
that the primary resistive scattering mechanism is not electron-electron
scattering, but Coulomb scattering by random quenched charged impurities and
phonon scattering. We show that a combination of impurity and phonon scattering
is a plausible alternative explanation for the observed resistivity that can
describe the key features of the experimental data, even if no Kondo lattice
has formed, indicating that further theoretical and experimental work is needed
to conclusively verify the formation of a Kondo lattice in Ref. [1].

<h3>Derivation of field theory for the classical dimer model using  bosonization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09665" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09665</a>
<br>
<i>Neil Wilkins, Stephen Powell</i>
<br>
<br>
We derive a field theory for the two-dimensional classical dimer model by
applying bosonization to Lieb's (fermionic) transfer-matrix solution. Our
constructive approach gives results that are consistent with the well-known
height theory, previously justified based on symmetry considerations, but also
fixes coefficients appearing in the effective theory and the relationship
between microscopic observables and operators in the field theory. In addition,
we show how interactions can be included in the field theory perturbatively,
treating the case of the double dimer model with interactions within and
between the two replicas. Using a renormalization-group analysis, we determine
the shape of the phase boundary near the noninteracting point, in agreement
with results of Monte Carlo simulations.

<h3>Zero-field microwave-free magnetometry with ensembles of  nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09666" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09666</a>
<br>
<i>Omkar Dhungel, Till Lenz, Muhib Omar, Joseph Shaji Rebeirro, Viktor Ivady, Adam Gali, Arne Wickenbrock, Dmitry Budker</i>
<br>
<br>
We study cross-relaxation features near zero magnetic field with ensembles of
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond and examine their properties in
samples with a range (0.9 ppm - 16.0 ppm) of NV concentrations. The observed
NV-NV cross-relaxation features between differently oriented NV centers in
high-NV-density samples hold promise for a variety of magnetometry applications
where microwave fields (or any bias field) disturb the system under study. We
theoretically determine the values of the bias magnetic fields corresponding to
cross-relaxations between different axes and experimentally validate them. The
behavior of zero-field cross-relaxation features as a function of temperature
is also investigated. The sensitivity of magnetometry based on this method is
determined to be in the 10 nT/sqrt(Hz) range.

<h3>Superconductivity in the Face Centered Cubic $\rm  W_{n-x}Mo_{x}RhIrPt_{2}$ High Entropy Alloy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09678" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09678</a>
<br>
<i>Denver Strong, R. J. Cava</i>
<br>
<br>
We report single phase superconducting face centered cubic (FCC) high entropy
alloys (HEAs) synthesized via splat cooling. The single phase materials fall at
electron counts in the HEA superconductor alloy family where structural
stability and optimal superconducting electron counts clash. The materials'
superconducting properties follow the general trends published for metallic
alloys. Many of the superconducting characteristics are summarized. Insights
are provided as to why an FCC structure may be stable.

<h3>Impact of chemical short-range order on radiation damage in Fe-Ni-Cr  alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09719" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09719</a>
<br>
<i>Hamdy Arkoub, Miaomiao Jin</i>
<br>
<br>
Chemical short-range order (CSRO), a form of nanoscale special atom
arrangement, has been found to significantly alter material properties such as
dislocation motion and defect dynamics in various alloys. Here, we use Fe-Ni-Cr
alloys to demonstrate how CSRO affects defect properties and radiation
behavior, based on extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Statistically
significant results are obtained regarding radiation-induced defect propensity,
defect clustering, and chemical mixing as a function of dose for three CSRO
levels. The perfect random solution as an energetically unfavorable state
(negative stacking fault energy) shows the strongest tendency to enable
diffusion, while a high CSRO degree scenario generally reduces the effective
defect diffusivity due to trapping effects, leading to distinct defect
dynamics. Notably, in the high-CSRO scenario, interstitial clusters are Cr-rich
and interstitial loops preferentially reside in/near the Cr-rich CSRO domains.
It is also identified that CSRO is dynamically evolving in a decreasing or
increasing manner upon continuous irradiation, reaching a steady-state value.
These new understandings suggest the importance of incorporating the effect of
CSRO in investigating radiation-driven microstructural evolution.

<h3>Physics-informed machine learning in asymptotic homogenization of  elliptic equations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09725" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09725</a>
<br>
<i>Celal Soyarslan, Marc Pradas</i>
<br>
<br>
We apply physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to first-order two-scale
periodic asymptotic homogenization of the property tensor in a generic elliptic
equation. The problem of lack of differentiability of property tensors at the
sharp phase interfaces is circumvented by making use of diffuse interface
formulation. Periodic boundary conditions are incorporated strictly, through
the introduction of an input-transfer layer (Fourier feature mapping), in which
the sine and cosine of the inner product of position vectors and reciprocal
lattice vectors are considered. This, together with the absence of Dirichlet
boundary conditions, results in a lossless boundary condition application. The
only loss terms are then due to the differential equation itself, which removes
the necessity of scaling the loss entries. In demonstrating the formulation's
versatility based on the reciprocal lattice vectors, crystalline arrangements
defined with Bravais lattices are used. We also show that considering integer
multiples of the reciprocal basis in the Fourier mapping leads to improved
convergence of high-frequency functions. We consider applications in one, two,
and three dimensions. Periodic composites, composed of embeddings of
monodisperse inclusions in the form of disks/spheres in the
two-/three-dimensional matrix, are considered. For demonstration purposes,
stochastic monodisperse disk arrangements are also considered.

<h3>Explosive Percolation Obeys Standard Finite-size Scaling in Event-based  Ensemble</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09774" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09774</a>
<br>
<i>Ming Li, Junfeng Wang, Youjin Deng</i>
<br>
<br>
Explosive percolation (EP) in the Achlioptas process, which has attracted
much research attention, is known to exhibit a rich variety of critical
phenomena that are anomalous from the perspective of continuous phase
transitions. Hereby, we show that, in an event-based ensemble, the critical
behaviors in EP are rather clean and obey the standard finite-size scaling
theory, except the large fluctuation of pseudo-critical points. In the
fluctuation window, multiple fractal structures emerge and the values can be
derived from a crossover scaling theory. Further, their mixing effects account
well for the previously observed anomalous phenomena. Making use of the clean
scaling in the event-based ensemble, we determine with a high precision the
critical points and exponents for a number of bond-insertion rules, and clarify
ambiguities about their universalities. Our findings hold true for any spatial
dimensions.

<h3>Design and Fabrication of PERC-Like CdTe Solar Cells Using  Micropatterned Al2O3 Layer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09787" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09787</a>
<br>
<i>Etee Kawna Roy, Kaden Powell, Chungho Lee, Gang Xiong, Heayoung Yoon</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent studies have investigated novel strategies to further improve the
limited Voc of CdTe solar cells via increased carrier lifetime and doping
density of CdTe thin films. Among various metal oxides, aluminum oxide (Al2O3)
is a promising passivation candidate, where the negatively charged Al2O3 layer
repels the minority carrier in CdTe and Al2O3 provides a chemically passivating
interface, increasing the carrier lifetime. Despite the continuing efforts, an
optimized back-contact architecture to improve the Voc while maintaining high
Jsc and FF is still under development. In this work, we report the design,
fabrication, and characterization of PERC-like CdTe solar cells, where an Al2O3
passivation layer is patterned using laser-beam lithography. Our process
enables reproducible patterning on a rough surface CdTe while maintaining the
size of the array in the design. Analysis of CdTe PERC devices (As-doped) shows
a notably different Voc trend compared to FF and Jsc, independent of the
patterned array structures used in this study. The subsurface electronic
structure of CdTe and the interplay between carrier selectivity and collection
of the patterned Al2O3 could be responsible for the observed PV
characteristics.

<h3>Relation between the noise correlations and the spin structure factor  for Mott-insulating states in SU$(N)$ Hubbard models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09807" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09807</a>
<br>
<i>Mathias Mikkelsen, Ippei Danshita</i>
<br>
<br>
It is well established that the noise correlations measured by time-of-flight
imaging in cold-atom experiments, which correspond to the density-density
correlations in the momentum space of trapped atomic gases, can probe the spin
structure factor deep in the Mott-insulating regime of SU(2) Hubbard models. We
explicitly derive the mathematical relation between the noise correlations and
the spin structure factor in the strong-interaction limit of SU$(N)$ Hubbard
models at any integer filling $\rho$. By calculating the ground states of
one-dimensional SU$(N)$ Fermi-Hubbard models for $2\leq N\leq 6$ with use of
the density matrix renormalization group method, we confirm the relation
numerically in the regime of strong interactions $U \gg t$, where $U$ and $t$
denote the onsite interaction and the hopping energy. We show that the
deviation between the actual noise correlations and those obtained from the
spin structure factor scales as approximately $(t/U)^2$ for $\rho=1$ at
intermediate and large lattice sizes on the basis of numeric and semi-analytic
arguments.

<h3>Ferromagnetic Resonance in Two-dimensional van der Waals Magnets: A  Probe for Spin Dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09822" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09822</a>

<i>Chunli Tang, Laith Alahmed, Muntasir Mahdi, Yuzan Xiong, Jerad Inman, Nathan J. McLaughlin, Christoph Zollitsch, Tae Hee Kim, Chunhui Rita Du, Hidekazu Kurebayashi, Elton J. G. Santos, Wei Zhang, Peng Li, Wencan Jin</i>
<br>
<br>
The discovery of atomic monolayer magnetic materials has stimulated intense
research activities in the two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials
community. The field is growing rapidly and there has been a large class of 2D
vdW magnetic compounds with unique properties, which provides an ideal platform
to study magnetism in the atomically thin limit. In parallel, based on
tunneling magnetoresistance and magneto-optical effect in 2D vdW magnets and
their heterostructures, emerging concepts of spintronic and optoelectronic
applications such as spin tunnel field-effect transistors and spin-filtering
devices are explored. While the magnetic ground state has been extensively
investigated, reliable characterization and control of spin dynamics play a
crucial role in designing ultrafast spintronic devices. Ferromagnetic resonance
(FMR) allows direct measurements of magnetic excitations, which provides
insight into the key parameters of magnetic properties such as exchange
interaction, magnetic anisotropy, gyromagnetic ratio, spin-orbit coupling,
damping rate, and domain structure. In this review article, we present an
overview of the essential progress in probing spin dynamics of 2D vdW magnets
using FMR techniques. Given the dynamic nature of this field, we focus mainly
on the broadband FMR, optical FMR, and spin-torque FMR, and their applications
in studying prototypical 2D vdW magnets including CrX3 (X = Cl, Br, I),
Fe5GeTe2, and Cr2Ge2Te6. We conclude with the recent advances in laboratory-
and synchrotron-based FMR techniques and their opportunities to broaden the
horizon of research pathways into atomically thin magnets.

<h3>Material-based analysis of spin-orbital Mott insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09824" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09824</a>
<br>
<i>Ryuta Iwazaki, Hiroshi Shinaoka, Shintaro Hoshino</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a framework for analyzing Mott insulators using a material-based
tight-binding model. We start with a realistic multiorbital Hubbard model and
derive an effective model for the localized electrons through the second-order
perturbation theory with respect to intersite hopping. This effective model,
known as the Kugel-Khomskii model, is described by SU($N$) generators, where
$N$ is the number of localized states. We solve this model by the mean-field
theory that takes local correlations into account and reveal spin-orbital
ordered states. To include spatial correlations, we apply the classical Monte
Carlo based on the path-integral approach with SU($N$) coherent states, and
also derive the equation of motion for spin-orbital degrees of freedom. Our
approach is applicable to any Mott insulator with reasonable computational
cost. The $5d$-pyrochlore oxide is used here as demonstration.

<h3>Role of Topology in Relaxation of One-dimensional Stochastic Processes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09832" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09832</a>
<br>
<i>Taro Sawada, Kazuki Sone, Yuto Ashida, Takahiro Sagawa</i>
<br>
<br>
Stochastic processes are commonly used models to describe dynamics of a wide
variety of nonequilibrium phenomena ranging from electrical transport to
biological motion. The transition matrix describing a stochastic process can be
regarded as a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Unlike general non-Hermitian systems,
the conservation of probability imposes additional constraints on the
transition matrix, which can induce unique topological phenomena. Here, we
reveal the role of topology in relaxation phenomena of classical stochastic
processes. Specifically, we define a winding number that is related to topology
of stochastic processes and show that it predicts the existence of a spectral
gap that characterizes the relaxation time. Then, we numerically confirm that
the winding number corresponds to the system-size dependence of the relaxation
time and the unconventional transient behavior. One can experimentally realize
such topological phenomena in magnetotactic bacteria and cell adhesions.

<h3>Microwave heating as a universal method to transform confined molecules  into armchair graphene nanoribbons</h3>

<br>
<br>
Armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs) with sub-nanometer width are potential
materials for fabrication of novel nanodevices thanks to their moderate direct
band gaps. AGNRs are usually synthesized by polymerizing precursor molecules on
substrate surface. However, it is time-consuming and not suitable for
large-scale production. AGNRs can also be grown by transforming precursor
molecules inside single-walled carbon nanotubes via furnace annealing, but the
obtained AGNRs are normally twisted. In this work, microwave heating is applied
for transforming precursor molecules into AGNRs. The fast heating process
allows synthesizing the AGNRs in seconds. Several different molecules were
successfully transformed into AGNRs, suggesting that it is a universal method.
More importantly, as demonstrated by Raman spectroscopy, aberration-corrected
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and theoretical calculations,
less twisted AGNRs are synthesized by the microwave heating than the furnace
annealing. Our results reveal a route for rapid production of AGNRs in large
scale, which would benefit future applications in novel AGNRs-based
semiconductor devices.

<h3>Quantum spin Hall insulator on the honeycomb lattice induced by  ferromagnetic exchange interaction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09838" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09838</a>
<br>
<i>Ye-Un An, Song-Jin O, Kwang-Il Ryom, Il-Gwang Son</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the many-body instabilities of correlated electrons on the
half-filled honeycomb lattice with enhanced exchange coupling. The system is
described by an extended Hubbard model including the next-nearest-neighbor
Coulomb repulsion ($V_2$) and the nearest-neighbor exchange interaction ($J$).
We use the truncated unity functional renormalization group approach to
determine a schematic ground-state phase diagram with higher resolution in the
parameter space of $V_2$ and $J$. In the absence of the on-site repulsion and
presence of sizable next-nearest-neighbor repulsion and enhanced
nearest-neighbor exchange interaction, we encounter the quantum spin Hall
phase, the spin-Kekul\'{e} phase, and the three-sublattice and the
incommensurate charge-density-wave phases. We propose a scheme for combining
consistently the truncated unity functional renormalization group and the
mean-field approximation, which is distinct from the conventional one that
directly uses the renormalization-group results as an input for the mean-field
calculation. This scheme is used to study in detail the quantum spin Hall
phase, presenting some characteristics like the bulk gap, the Chern number and
the helical edge states.

<h3>Theory of electric, magnetic, and toroidal polarizations in crystalline  solids with applications to hexagonal lonsdaleite and cubic diamond</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09842" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09842</a>

<br>
<br>
Multipolar order in bulk crystalline solids is characterized by multipole
densities -- denoted as polarizations in this work -- that cannot be cleanly
defined using the concepts of classical electromagnetism. Here we use group
theory to overcome this difficulty and present a systematic study of electric,
magnetic and toroidal multipolar order in crystalline solids. Based on our
symmetry analysis, we identify five categories of polarized matter, each of
which is characterized by distinct features in the electronic band structure.
For example, Rashba spin splitting in electropolar bulk materials like wurtzite
represents the electric dipolarization in these materials. We also develop a
general formalism of indicators for individual multipole densities that provide
a physical interpretation and quantification of multipolar order. Our work
clarifies the relation between patterns of localized multipoles and macroscopic
multipole densities they give rise to. To illustrate the general theory, we
discuss its application to polarized variants of hexagonal lonsdaleite and
cubic diamond structures. Our work provides a general framework for classifying
and expanding current understanding of multipolar order in complex materials.

<h3>Ab initio Prediction of Mechanical, Electronic, Magnetic and Transport  Properties of Bulk and Heterostructure of a Novel Fe-Cr based Full Heusler  Chalcogenide</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09843" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09843</a>
<br>
<i>Joydipto Bhattacharya, Rajeev Dutt, Aparna Chakrabarti</i>
<br>
<br>
Using electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory,
we predict and study the structural, mechanical, electronic, magnetic and
transport properties of a new full Heusler chalcogenide, namely, Fe$_2$CrTe,
both in bulk and heterostructure form. The system shows a ferromagnetic and
half-metallic(HM) like behavior, with a very high (about 95%) spin polarization
at the Fermi level, in its cubic phase. Interestingly, under tetragonal
distortion, a clear minimum (with almost the same energy as the cubic phase)
has also been found, at a c/a value of 1.26, which, however, shows a
ferrimagnetic and fully metallic nature. The compound has been found to be
dynamically stable in both the phases against the lattice vibration. The
elastic properties indicate that the compound is mechanically stable in both
the phases, following the stability criteria of the cubic and tetragonal
phases. The elastic parameters unveil the mechanically anisotropic and ductile
nature of the alloy system. Due to the HM-like behavior of the cubic phase and
keeping in mind the practical aspects, we probe the effect of strain as well as
substrate on various physical properties of this alloy. Transmission profile of
the Fe$_2$CrTe/MgO/Fe$_2$CrTe heterojunction has been calculated to probe it as
a magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) material in both the cubic and tetragonal
phases. Considerably large tunneling magnetoresistance ratio (TMR) of 1000% is
observed for the tetragonal phase, which is found to be one order of magnitude
larger than that of the cubic phase.

We present a minimal model of charge transport in hybrid perovskites, which
provides an intuitive explanation for the recently proposed formation of
ferroelectric large polarons. We demonstrate that short-ranged charge--rotor
interactions lead to long-range ferroelectic ordering of rotors, which strongly
affects the carrier mobility. In the nonperturbative regime, where our theory
cannot be reduced to any of the earlier models, we predict polaron properties
in good agreement with experiment. This shows the potential of simple models to
reveal electronic properties of molecular materials.

The Seebeck-driven transverse thermoelectric generation in
magnetic/thermoelectric hybrid materials (STTG) has been investigated in
all-bulk hybrid materials. The transverse thermopower in a ferromagnetic
Co$_2$MnGa/thermoelectric $n$-type Si hybrid bulk material with the adjusted
dimensions reaches 16.0 $\mu$V/K at room temperature with the aid of the STTG
contribution, which is much larger than the anomalous Nernst coefficient of the
Co$_2$MnGa slab (6.8 $\mu$V/K). Although this transverse thermopower is smaller
than the value for previously reported thin-film-based hybrid materials, the
hybrid bulk materials exhibit much larger electrical power owing to their small
internal resistance. This demonstration confirms the validity of STTG in bulk
materials and clarifies its potential as a thermal energy harvester.

Predicting the phase diagram of interacting quantum many-body systems is a
central problem in condensed matter physics and related fields. A variety of
quantum many-body systems, ranging from unconventional superconductors to spin
liquids, exhibit complex competing phases whose theoretical description has
been the focus of intense efforts. Here, we show that neural network quantum
states can be combined with a Lee-Yang theory of quantum phase transitions to
predict the critical points of strongly-correlated spin lattices. Specifically,
we implement our approach for quantum phase transitions in the transverse-field
Ising model on different lattice geometries in one, two, and three dimensions.
We show that the Lee-Yang theory combined with neural network quantum states
yields predictions of the critical field, which are consistent with large-scale
quantum many-body methods. As such, our results provide a starting point for
determining the phase diagram of more complex quantum many-body systems,
including frustrated Heisenberg and Hubbard models.

In this study we investigate the effect of random point disorder on the
surface states of a topological insulator with out-of-plane magnetization. We
consider the disorder within a high order Born approximation. The Born series
converges to the one branch of the self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA)
solution at low disorder. As the disorder strength increases, the Born series
converges to another SCBA solution with the finite density of states within the
magnetization induced gap. Further increase of the disorder strength leads to a
divergence of the Born series, showing the limits of the applicability of the
Born approximation. We find that the convergence properties of this Born series
are closely related to the properties of the logistic map, which is known as a
prototypical model of chaos. We also calculate the longitudinal and Hall
conductivities within the Kubo formulas at zero temperature with the vertex
corrections for the velocity operator. Vertex corrections are important for
describing transport properties in the strong disorder regime. In the case of
strong disorder, the longitudinal conductivity is weakly dependent on the
disorder strength, while the Hall conductivity decreases with increasing
disorder.

Quantum magnets provide a powerful platform to explore complex quantum
many-body phenomena. One example is triplon excitations, exotic many-body modes
emerging from deconfined singlet-triplet transitions with no single particle
analog. Triplons are challenging to observe in conventional materials, as the
energy scales of singlet-triplet transitions are associated with Hund's energy
and are dramatically larger than the typical bandwidth of spin fluctuations. We
engineer a minimal quantum magnet from organic molecules and demonstrate the
emergence of dispersive triplon modes in one- and two-dimensional assemblies
probed with scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We show the
variable bandwidth of triplon excitations in these two different geometries.
Our results provide the first demonstration of dispersive triplon excitations
from a real-space measurement, suggesting their potential engineering to
realize exotic many-body phenomena in quantum magnets without breaking
time-reversal symmetry.

<h3>Approximate Hofstadter- and Kapit-Mueller-like parent Hamiltonians for  Laughlin states on fractals</h3>

Recently, it was shown that fractional quantum Hall states can be defined on
fractal lattices. Proposed exact parent Hamiltonians for these states are
nonlocal and contain three-site terms. In this work, we look for simpler,
approximate parent Hamiltonians for bosonic Laughlin states at half filling,
which contain only onsite potentials and two-site hopping with the interaction
generated implicitly by hardcore constraints (as in the Hofstadter and
Kapit-Mueller models on periodic lattices). We use an ``inverse method'' to
determine such Hamiltonians on finite-generation Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet and
triangle lattices. The ground states of some of the resulting models display
relatively high overlap with the model states if up to third neighbor hopping
terms are considered, and by increasing the maximum hopping distance one can
achieve nearly perfect overlaps. When the number of particles is reduced and
additional potentials are introduced to trap quasiholes, the overlap with a
model quasihole wavefunction is also high in some cases, especially for the
nonlocal Hamiltonians. We also study how the small system size affects the
braiding properties for the model quasihole wavefunctions and perform analogous
computations for Hamiltonian models.

<h3>Photo-assisted current in the fractional quantum Hall effect as a probe  of the quasiparticle operator scaling dimension</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study photo-assisted transport for the edge states of a two dimensional
electron gas in the fractional quantum Hall regime, pinched by a single quantum
point contact. We provide a general expression of the photo-assisted current
using a Keldysh-Floquet approach, when the AC drive is applied either directly
to the edge states, or when it modulates the tunneling amplitude at the quantum
point contact. Strikingly, for a simple cosine modulation of the tunneling
amplitude, the phase shift of the second harmonic of the photoassisted current
is directly related to the scaling dimension of the quasiparticle operators
describing the fractional excitations. As the scaling dimension is intimately
related to the statistics, our proposal of a gate modulation of the
backscattered current provides a diagnosis of the statistics of Laughlin
quasiparticles using a simple quantum point contact geometry.

<h3>Flexible Colloidal Molecules with Directional Bonds and Controlled  Flexibility</h3>

<br>
<br>
Colloidal molecules are ideal model systems for mimicking real molecules and
can serve as versatile building blocks for the bottom-up self-assembly of
flexible and smart materials. While most colloidal molecules are rigid objects,
the development of colloidal joints has made it possible to also include
conformational flexibility into colloidal molecules. However, their
unrestricted range of motion does not capture the restricted motion range and
bond directionality that is typical of real molecules.
In this work, we create flexible colloidal molecules with an in situ
controllable motion range and bond directionality by assembling spherical
particles onto cubes functionalized with complementary surface-mobile DNA. We
assemble colloidal molecules with different coordination number of spheres by
varying the size ratio and find that they feature a constrained range of motion
above a critical size ratio. Using theory and simulations, we show that the
particle shape together with the multivalent bonds create an effective
free-energy landscape for the motion of the sphere on the surface of the cube.
We quantify the confinement of the spheres on the surface of the cube and the
probability to change facet. We find that temperature can be used as an extra
control parameter to switch in situ between full and constrained flexibility of
these colloidal molecules. These flexible colloidal molecules with temperature
switching motion range can be used to investigate the effect of directional,
yet flexible bonds in determining their self-assembly and phase behavior, and
may be employed as constructional units in microrobotics and novel smart
materials

<h3>Interrogating Quantum Nonlocal Effects in Nanoplasmonics through  Electron-Beam Spectroscopies</h3>

<br>
<br>
A rigorous account of quantum nonlocal effects is paramount for understanding
the optical response of metal nanostructures and for designing plasmonic
devices operating at the nanoscale. Here, we present a scheme for retrieving
the quantum surface response of metals encapsulated in the Feibelman
$d$-parameters from electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and
cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements. We theoretically demonstrate that
quantum nonlocal effects have a dramatic impact on EELS and CL spectra, in the
guise of spectral shifts and nonlocal damping, when either the system size or
the inverse wave vector in extended structures approach the nanometer scale.
Our concept capitalizes on the unparalleled ability of free-electrons to supply
tailored, deeply subwavelength near-fields and, thus, probe the optical
response of metals at length scales in which quantum-mechanical effects are
apparent. These results pave the way for a widespread use of the $d$-parameter
formalism, thereby facilitating a rigorous yet practical inclusion of
nonclassical effects in nanoplasmonics studies.

CsSnI3 is a promising eco-friendly solution for energy harvesting
technologies. It exists at room temperature in either a black perovskite
polymorph or a yellow 1D double-chain, which irreversibly deteriorates in the
air. In this work, we unveil the relative thermodynamic stability between the
two structures with a first-principles sampling of the CsSnI3
finite-temperature phase diagram, discovering how it is driven by anomalously
large quantum and anharmonic ionic fluctuations. Thanks to a comprehensive
treatment of anharmonicity, the simulations deliver a remarkable agreement with
known experimental data for the transition temperatures of the orthorhombic,
rhombohedral, and cubic perovskite structures and the thermal expansion
coefficient. We disclose how the perovskite polymorphs are the ground state
above \SI{270}{\kelvin} and discover an abnormal decrease in heat capacity upon
heating in the cubic black perovskite. Our results also significantly downplay
the Cs+ rattling modes' contribution to mechanical instability. The remarkable
agreement with experiments validates our methodology, which can be
systematically applied to all metal halides.

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a branch of two-dimensional
materials which in addition to having an easy-to-exfoliate layered structure,
also host semiconducting, metallic, superconducting, and topological properties
in various polymorphs with potential applications. MoTe$_2$ is an example of
such a TMD, which shows semiconducting (in 2H phase), metallic (in 1T' phase),
topological Weyl semimetallic and superconducting behavior (in Td phase).
Consequently, an extensive amount of research has been done on MoTe$_2$,
particularly on the topological phase transition between the metallic-type 1T'
phase and the topological Td phase. This phase transition has been reviewed and
its association with the crystal structure, charge transport, and electronic
band structure is elaborately discussed. Also, the effect of various stimuli
like reduced dimensionality, pressure, charge doping, and chemical
substitution, which affect the structural transition as well as the
superconducting transition temperatures is reviewed; thereby, suggesting
certain correlations between the apparently unrelated structural and
superconducting phase transitions. The review also brings out some open
questions which are likely to interest the community to address the physics
associated with the phase transition and its potential applications.

<h3>Orbital antiferroelectricity and higher dimensional magnetoelectric  order in the spin-$1/2$ XX chain extended with three-spin interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10138" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10138</a>

<i>Pradeep Thakur, P. Durganandini</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the spin-1/2 XX model extended with three-spin interactions of the
XZX+YZY and XZY-YZX types. We solve the model exactly and obtain the ground
state phase diagram as a function of the two three-spin coupling strengths. We
show that even in absence of external electric and magnetic fields there is a
phase which exhibits spontaneous magnetoelectric order when both XZX+YZY and
XZY-YZX interactions are present. Specifically, in this regime, we show that
there exists not only a non-zero magnetization and a scalar chirality but also
a vector chiral order. Further, we show the existence of a plaquette vector
chirality, or circulating chiral spin current loops, in the plaquettes n, n+1,
n+2 with the sense of the current being opposite in adjacent plaquettes.
Analogous to charge current loops giving rise to orbital magnetic dipole
moments, the circulating spin current loops give rise to orbital electric
dipole moments - a novel orbital antiferroelectricity. We characterize this
phase by a higher-dimensional scalar and vector toroidal order. Such a novel
phase with higher dimensional order arises because of the non-trivial
topological connectivity resulting from the presence of both the three-spin
interactions. We also study the combined effect of both types of three-spin
interactions on the entanglement entropy.

Biological neuronal networks are characterized by nonlinear interactions and
complex connectivity. Given the growing impetus to build neuromorphic
computers, understanding physical devices that exhibit structures and
functionalities similar to biological neural networks is an important step
toward this goal. Self-organizing circuits of nanodevices are at the forefront
of the research in neuromorphic computing, as their behavior mimics synaptic
plasticity features of biological neuronal circuits. However, an effective
theory to describe their behavior is lacking. This study provides for the first
time an effective mean field theory for the emergent voltage-induced
polymorphism of \textit{circuits} of a nanowire connectome, showing that the
behavior of these circuits can be explained by a low-dimensional dynamical
equation. The equation can be derived from the microscopic dynamics of a single
memristive junction in analytical form. We test our effective model on
experiments of nanowire networks and show that it fits both the potentiation
and depression of these synapse-mimicking circuits. We show that our theory
applies beyond the case of nanowire networks by formulating a general
mean-field theory of conductance transitions in self-organizing memristive
connectomes.

The cubic Heusler alloy Ru$_{2-x}$Mn$_{1+x}$Al is grown in thin film form on
MgO and MgAl$_2$O$_4$ substrates. It is a highly spin-polarised ferrimagnetic
metal, with weak magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Although structurally and
chemically similar to $\text{Mn}_2\text{Ru}_x\text{Ga}$, it does not exhibit
ferrimagnetic compensation, or large magneto galvanic effects. The differences
are attributed to a combination of atomic order and the hybridisation with the
group 13 element Al or Ga. The spin polarisation is around 50 to 60 %. There is
a gap in the density of states just above the Fermi level in fully ordered
compounds.

<br>
<br>
At the core of the semiconducting spin qubits success is the ability to
manipulate them electrically, enabled by the spin-orbit interactions. However,
most implementations require external magnetic fields to define the spin qubit,
which in turn activate various charge noise mechanisms. Here we study spin
qubits confined in quantum dots at zero magnetic fields, that are driven
periodically by electrical fields and are coupled to a microwave resonator.
Using Floquet theory, we identify a well-defined Floquet spin-qubit originating
from the lowest degenerate spin states in the absence of driving. We find both
transverse and longitudinal couplings between the Floquet spin qubit and the
resonator, which can be selectively activated by modifying the driving
frequency. We show how these couplings can facilitate fast qubit readout and
the implementation of a two-qubit CPHASE gate. Finally, we use adiabatic
perturbation theory to demonstrate that the spin-photon couplings originate
from the non-Abelian geometry of states endowed by the spin-orbit interactions,
rendering these findings general and applicable to a wide range of solid-state
spin qubits.

<br>

Scrutiny of an established monoclinic magnetic space group for NdFeO3 reveals
hitherto unknown properties of the orthoferrite. Future experiments using
neutron and x-ray diffraction techniques can verify them. Neodymium ions
possess Dirac multipoles, both time-odd (magnetic) and parity-odd (polar), that
come with unique diffraction conditions. Non-magnetic polar Nd multipoles are
permitted even though the monoclinic space group is centrosymmetric. Dirac
multipoles are forbidden by symmetry at sites occupied by ferric ions.
Available diffraction patterns have not been analysed for Dirac multipoles. Nor
all permitted components of the axial dipoles and quadrupoles. In the case of
neutron diffraction, magnetic quadrupoles are correlations between anapole and
orbital degrees of freedom. We give conditions for the observation of
Templeton-Templeton scattering of x-rays, created by angular anisotropy in the
electronic charge distribution. Axial multipoles are the sole providers of
dichroic signals.

Intelligent transport of molecular species across different barriers is
critical for various biological functions and is achieved through the unique
properties of biological membranes. An essential feature of intelligent
transport is the ability to adapt to different external and internal conditions
and also the ability to memorise the previous state. In biological systems, the
most common form of such intelligence is expressed as hysteresis. Despite
numerous advances made over previous decades on smart membranes, it is still a
challenge for a synthetic membrane to display stable hysteretic behaviour for
molecular transport. Here we show the memory effects and stimuli regulated
transport of molecules through an intelligent phase changing MoS$_2$ membrane
in response to external pH. We show that water and ion permeation through 1T'
MoS$_2$ membranes follows a pH dependent hysteresis with a permeation rate that
switches by a few orders of magnitude. We demonstrate that this phenomenon is
unique to the 1T' phase of MoS$_2$ due to the presence of surface charge and
exchangeable ions on the surface. We further demonstrate the potential
application of this phenomenon in autonomous wound infection monitoring and
pH-dependent nanofiltration. Our work significantly deepens understanding of
the mechanism of water transport at the nanoscale and opens an avenue for
developing neuromorphic applications, smart drug delivery systems,
point-of-care diagnostics, smart sensors, and intelligent filtration devices.

We introduce carbon Kagome nanotubes (CKNTs) -- a new allotrope of carbon
formed by rolling up sheets of Kagome graphene, and investigate the properties
of this material using first principles calculations. Based on the direction of
rolling, we identify two principal varieties of CKNTs -- armchair and zigzag,
and find that the bending stiffness associated with rolling Kagome graphene
into either type of CKNT is about a third of that associated with rolling
conventional graphene into carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Ab initio molecular
dynamics simulations indicate that both types of CKNTs are likely to exist as
stable structures at room temperature. Each CKNT explored here is metallic and
features dispersionless states (i.e., flat bands) throughout its Brillouin
zone, along with an associated singular peak in the electronic density of
states, close to the Fermi level. We calculate the mechanical and electronic
response of CKNTs to torsional and axial strains and compare against
conventional CNTs. We show in particular, that upon twisting, degenerate
dispersionless electronic states in CKNTs split, Dirac points and partially
flat bands emerge from the quadratic band crossing point at the Fermi level,
and that these features can be explained using a relatively simple
tight-binding model.
Overall, CKNTs appear to be unique and striking examples of realistic
elemental quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials that can potentially display
fascinating collective material properties arising from the presence of
strongly correlated electrons. Additionally, distorted CKNTs may provide an
interesting material platform where flat band physics and chirality induced
anomalous transport effects may be studied together.
