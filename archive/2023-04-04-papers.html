<h3>Collective behaviors of isotropic phoretic microswimmers: from  crystalline solids to active turbulence</h3>

Chemically phoretic microswimmers including Janus colloids and isotropic
active droplets have recently shown great potential for self-organizing into
active materials. However, the fascinating self-organization of these swimmers
remains enigmatic owing to an incomplete understanding of their collective
dynamics. We investigate a paradigmatic suspension of phoretic swimmers
represented by isotropic phoretic disks. By varying the activity and area
fraction of disks, we observe their diverse collective phenomena: formation of
crystalline solids resembling Wigner crystals, melting, gas-like dynamic
chaining, active transition and turbulence. Notably, altering the activity
alone leads to solid-fluid phase transition and subsequently the fluid's
laminar-turbulent transition. Our observations are based on large-scale
simulations explicitly resolving the many-body, long-range hydrochemical
interactions among the phoretic agents. We reproduce independent experimental
phenomena that have not been collectively captured by a single model,
emphasizing the importance of incorporating full physicochemical hydrodynamics.
We develop a predictive scaling delineating the solid-liquid transition and
further dissect it as a defect-mediated two-step melting scenario via a hexatic
phase. We demonstrate that the fluid phase exhibits oscillatory instability
with waves, transition due to wave-breaking clusters, and active turbulence
manifesting vortices. These progressive scenarios evidence a closer
phenomenological resemblance between active and classical fluids in their
laminar-turbulent transition than previously demonstrated. Our findings
elucidate the collective dynamics of phoretic agents, potentially facilitating
the design of active material systems by harnessing non-equilibrium phoretic
collectives.

<h3>Lateral transport of domains in anionic lipid bilayer membranes under DC  electric fields: A coarse-grained molecular dynamics study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01679" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01679</a>

<br>
Dynamic lateral transport of lipids, proteins, and self-assembled structures
in biomembranes plays crucial roles in diverse cellular processes. In this
study, we perform a coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation on a vesicle
composed of a binary mixture of neutral and anionic lipids to investigate the
lateral transport of individual lipid molecules as well as the self-assembled
lipid domains themselves upon an applied direct current (DC) electric field.
Under the potential force of the electric field, a phase-separated domain rich
in the anionic lipids emerges in the opposite direction of that of the electric
field. The subsequent reversal of the electric field induces the unidirectional
domain motion. During the domain motion, the domain size remains constant, but
a considerable amount of the anionic lipids are exchanged between the
anionic-lipid-rich domain and the neutral-lipid-rich bulk. The mean velocity
field of the lipids surrounding the domain displays a two-dimensional (2D)
source dipole. We revealed that the balance between the potential force of the
applied electric field and the quasi-2D hydrodynamic frictional force well
explains the dependence of the domain motions on the electric-field strengths.
The present results provide insight into the hierarchical dynamic responses of
self-assembled lipid domains to the applied electric field and contribute to
controlling the lateral transportation of membrane inclusions.

<h3>Ideal Chern bands are Landau levels in curved space</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01251" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01251</a>
<br>
<i>B. Estienne, N. Regnault, V. Crépel</i>

<br>
We prove that all the criteria proposed in the literature to identify Chern
bands hosting fractional Chern insulating ground states, in fact, describe an
equivalence with lowest Landau levels defined in curved space under a
non-uniform magnetic field. In addition, we design an operational test for the
most general instance of lowest Landau level mapping, which only relies on the
computationally inexpensive evaluation of Bloch wavefunctions' derivatives. Our
work clarifies the common origin of various Chern-idealness criteria, proves
that these criteria exhaust all possible lowest Landau levels, and hints at
classes of Chern bands that may posses interesting phases beyond Landau level
physics.

<h3>Giant energy oscillations mediated by a quasiperiodically driven qubit</h3>

A qubit driven by two incommensurate frequencies can mediate a quantised
average energy current in the adiabatic limit. We show that non-adiabatic
processes result in reversals of the energy current and corresponding
oscillations in the net energy transferred between the drives. The oscillations
are bounded but giant -- much larger than the qubit energy splitting. A
Landau-Zener analysis predicts that the timescale of the oscillations is
exponentially large in the period of the drives. However, numerical analysis
reveals that this timescale is not a monotonic function of the period, and has
increasing sub-structure as the adiabatic limit is approached. We show that
this non-monotonicity arises from interference effects between subsequent
Landau-Zener transitions. Giant energy oscillations should be observable in
near-term experiments with nitrogen-vacancy centers.

<h3>Anomalies of $(1+1)D$ categorical symmetries</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present a general approach for detecting when a fusion category symmetry
is anomalous, based on the existence of a special kind of Lagrangian algebra of
the corresponding Drinfeld center. The Drinfeld center of a fusion category
$\mathcal{A}$ describes a $(2+1)D$ topological order whose gapped boundaries
enumerate all $(1+1)D$ gapped phases with the fusion category symmetry, which
may be spontaneously broken. There always exists a gapped boundary, given by
the \emph{electric} Lagrangian algebra, that describes a phase with
$\mathcal{A}$ fully spontaneously broken. The symmetry defects of this boundary
can be identified with the objects in $\mathcal{A}$. We observe that if there
exists a different gapped boundary, given by a \emph{magnetic} Lagrangian
algebra, then there exists a gapped phase where $\mathcal{A}$ is not
spontaneously broken at all, which means that $\mathcal{A}$ is not anomalous.
In certain cases, we show that requiring the existence of such a magnetic
Lagrangian algebra leads to highly computable obstructions to $\mathcal{A}$
being anomaly-free. As an application, we consider the Drinfeld centers of
$\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N$ Tambara-Yamagami fusion categories and recover
known results from the study of fiber functors.

<h3>Magnetic resonance in the quasi-2D square lattice easy-plane  antiferromagnet Ba$_2$MnGe$_2$O$_7$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01280" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01280</a>
<br>
<i>V. N. Glazkov, Yu. V. Krasnikova, I. K. Rodygina, H.-A. Krug von Nidda, T. Masuda</i>
<br>
<br>
We report results of a multi-frequency (0.8-60 GHz) electron spin resonance
study of the spin dynamics in the quasi-2D square lattice antiferromagnet
Ba$_2$MnGe$_2$O$_7$ both in antiferromagnetically ordered and paramagnetic
phases. We directly observe two zero-field gaps in the excitation spectrum of
the ordered phase, the larger one being due to easy-plane anisotropy, and the
smaller one indicates the presence of fourth-order in-plane anisotropy probably
related to the multiferroic properties of this compound. We observe effects of
hyperfine interaction on the electron spin resonance spectra in the
antiferromagnetically ordered state, which turns out to be comparable with
in-plane anisotropy. The hyperfine field strength is found from the observed
low-temperature electron spin resonance data. The spin dynamics of the
paramagnetic phase is characterized by strong broadening of the ESR absorption
line, which can be ascribed to the vortex dynamics of a 2D magnet.

<h3>Twisting instabilities in elastic ribbons with inhomogeneous pre-stress:  a macroscopic analog of thermodynamic phase transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01291" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01291</a>
<br>
<i>Michael Gomez, Pedro M. Reis, Basile Audoly</i>
<br>
<br>
We study elastic ribbons subject to large, tensile pre-stress confined to a
central region within the cross-section. These ribbons can buckle spontaneously
to form helical shapes, featuring regions of alternating chirality (phases)
that are separated by so-called perversions (phase boundaries). This
instability cannot be described by classical rod theory, which incorporates
pre-stress through effective natural curvature and twist; these are both zero
due to the mirror symmetry of the pre-stress. Using dimension reduction, we
derive a one-dimensional (1D) 'rod-like' model from a plate theory, which
accounts for inhomogeneous pre-stress as well as finite rotations. The 1D model
successfully captures the qualitative features of torsional buckling under a
prescribed end-to-end displacement and rotation, including the co-existence of
buckled phases possessing opposite twist, and is in good quantitative agreement
with the results of numerical (finite-element) simulations and model
experiments on elastomeric samples. Our model system provides a macroscopic
analog of phase separation and pressure-volume-temperature state diagrams, as
described by the classical thermodynamic theory of phase transitions.

<h3>Polymer networks which locally rotate to accommodate stresses, torques,  and deformation</h3>

Polymer network models construct the constitutive relationships of a broader
polymer network from the behavior of a single polymer chain (e.g. viscoelastic
response to applied forces, applied electromagnetic fields, etc.). Network
models have been used for multiscale phenomena in a variety of contexts such as
rubber elasticity, soft multifunctional materials, biological materials, and
even the curing of polymers. For decades, a myriad of polymer network models
have been developed with differing numbers of chains, arranged in different
ways, and with differing symmetries. To complicate matters further, there are
also competing assumptions for how macroscopic variables (e.g. deformation) are
related to individual chains within the network model. In this work, we propose
a simple, intuitive assumption for how the network locally rotates relative to
applied loading (e.g. stresses, external fields) and show that this assumption
unifies many of the disparate polymer network models--while also recovering one
of the most successful models for rubber elasticity, the Arruda-Boyce $8$-chain
model. The new assumption is then shown to make more intuitive predictions
(than prior models) for stimuli-responsive networks with orientational energies
(e.g. electroactive polymers), which is significant for shape morphing and
designing high degree of freedom actuators (e.g. for soft robotics). Lastly, we
unveil some surprising consequences of the new model for the phases of
multistable biopolymer and semi-crystalline networks.

<h3>Constraints on short-range gravity with self-gravitating Bose-Einstein  condensates</h3>

<br>

In this work, we study low-lying collective excitations of a Bose-Einstein
condensate with Newtonian and Yukawa-like two-particle interaction and derive
boundaries for both Yukawa parameters. Using a variational approach, we
explicitly show for spherical condensate that the corresponding frequencies
depend on the gravitational interaction strength. The acquired results are
presented in contour plots and compared to experimentally verified data from
other tests. Furthermore, we discuss experimental requirements to test our
theoretical model as well as possibilities to improve the boundaries. In
addition, we consider axisymmetric condensates, where it turns out that
disk-shaped BECs lead to better constraints. We also show that in theory we can
determine the values for both Yukawa parameters independently by a measurement
of at least two collective frequencies.

While machine-learned interatomic potentials have become a mainstay for
modeling materials, designing training sets that lead to robust potentials is
challenging. Automated methods, such as active learning and on-the-fly
learning, allow for the construction of reliable training sets, but these
processes can be very resource-intensive when training a potential for use in
large-scale simulations. Current training approaches often use density
functional theory (DFT) calculations that have the same cell size as the
simulations that use the potential. Here, we demonstrate an easy-to-implement
small-cell structures training protocol and use it to train a potential for
zirconium and hydrides. This training leads to a convex hull in good agreement
with DFT when applied to known stable phases. Compared to traditional active
learning, small-cell training decreased the training time of a potential able
to capture the {\alpha}-\b{eta} zirconium phase transition by approximately 20
times. The potential describes the phase transition with a degree of accuracy
similar to that of the large-cell training method.

<h3>Charting the Topography of the Neural Network Landscape with  Thermal-Like Noise</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01335" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01335</a>
<br>
<i>Theo Jules, Gal Brener, Tal Kachman, Noam Levi, Yohai Bar-Sinai</i>
<br>
<br>
The training of neural networks is a complex, high-dimensional, non-convex
and noisy optimization problem whose theoretical understanding is interesting
both from an applicative perspective and for fundamental reasons. A core
challenge is to understand the geometry and topography of the landscape that
guides the optimization. In this work, we employ standard Statistical Mechanics
methods, namely, phase-space exploration using Langevin dynamics, to study this
landscape for an over-parameterized fully connected network performing a
classification task on random data. Analyzing the fluctuation statistics, in
analogy to thermal dynamics at a constant temperature, we infer a clear
geometric description of the low-loss region. We find that it is a
low-dimensional manifold whose dimension can be readily obtained from the
fluctuations. Furthermore, this dimension is controlled by the number of data
points that reside near the classification decision boundary. Importantly, we
find that a quadratic approximation of the loss near the minimum is
fundamentally inadequate due to the exponential nature of the decision boundary
and the flatness of the low-loss region. This causes the dynamics to sample
regions with higher curvature at higher temperatures, while producing
quadratic-like statistics at any given temperature. We explain this behavior by
a simplified loss model which is analytically tractable and reproduces the
observed fluctuation statistics.

<h3>Three-Dimensional Structure of Hybrid Magnetic Skyrmions Determined by  Neutron Scattering</h3>

<br>
<br>
Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected chiral spin textures which
present opportunities for next-generation magnetic data storage and logic
information technologies. The topology of these structures originates in the
geometric configuration of the magnetic spins - more generally described as the
structure. While the skyrmion structure is most often depicted using a 2D
projection of the three-dimensional structure, recent works have emphasized the
role of all three dimensions in determining the topology and their response to
external stimuli. In this work, grazing-incidence small-angle neutron
scattering and polarized neutron reflectometry are used to determine the
three-dimensional structure of hybrid skyrmions. The structure of the hybrid
skyrmions, which includes a combination of N\'eel-like and Bloch-like
components along their length, is expected to significantly contribute to their
notable stability, which includes ambient conditions. To interpret the neutron
scattering data, micromagnetic simulations of the hybrid skyrmions were
performed, and the corresponding diffraction patterns were determined using a
Born approximation transformation. The converged magnetic profile reveals the
magnetic structure along with the skyrmion depth profile, including the
thickness of the Bloch and N\'eel segments and the diameter of the core.

<h3>Effect of Moisture Absorption on Curing of Wind Blades during Repair</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01375" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01375</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Efficient structural repair of wind turbine blades is essential to limiting
global warming and reducing the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). Repairs
carried out up-tower are sensitive to environmental conditions whose effect on
the material properties during processing needs to be accounted for to
accurately predict the repair outcome. This study investigates the effect of
moisture content from environmental exposure on the cure kinetics of an
infusion resin system used in wind turbine blade manufacturing and repair and
provides an experimentally validated finite element tool for the analysis of
cure cycle repairs as a function of repair geometry and moisture content.
Moisture absorption tests on the two-part infusion system reported up to 12%
moisture uptake by the curing agent under high temperature and relative
humidity conditions. Differential scanning calorimetric measurements of resin
in the presence of moisture revealed an accelerated cure behavior. Numerical
predictions of a repair model agreed very well with the corresponding lab-scale
repair and revealed a substantial temperature lag within the repair patch which
resulted in thermal gradients and spatial distribution of the degree of cure.
It was shown that the repair geometry and the accelerated-cure kinetics greatly
influenced the temperature and cure distribution within the repair. The
proposed approach can be used to reduce turbine downtime by minimizing the
curing time.

<h3>A physically realizable molecular motor driven by the Landauer blowtorch  effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01408" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01408</a>
<br>
<i>Riley J. Preston, Daniel S. Kosov</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a model for a molecular motor in a molecular electronic junction
driven by a natural manifestation of Landauer's blowtorch effect. The effect
emerges via the interplay of the electronic viscosity and diffusion
coefficients, each calculated quantum mechanically using nonequilibrium Green's
functions, within a semi-classical Langevin description of the rotational
dynamics. The motor functionality is analysed through numerical simulations
where the rotations exhibit a directional preference according to the intrinsic
geometry of the molecular configuration. The proposed mechanism for motor
function is expected to be ubiquitous for a range of molecular geometries
beyond the one examined here.

<h3>Characterizing multi-mode nonlinear dynamics of nanomechanical  resonators</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Mechanical nonlinearities dominate the motion of nanoresonators already at
relatively small oscillation amplitudes. Although single and coupled
two-degrees-of-freedom models have been used to account for experimentally
observed nonlinear effects, it is shown that these models quickly deviate from
experimental findings when multiple modes influence the nonlinear response.
Here, we present a nonlinear reduced-order modelling methodology based on FEM
simulations for capturing the global nonlinear dynamics of nanomechanical
resonators. Our physics-based approach obtains the quadratic and cubic
nonlinearities of resonators over a wide frequency range that spans 70 MHz. To
qualitatively validate our approach, we perform experiments on a graphene
nanodrum driven opto-thermally and show that the model can replicate diverse
ranges of nonlinear phenomena, including multi-stability, parametric resonance,
and different internal resonances without considering any empirical nonlinear
fitting parameters. By providing a direct link between microscopic geometry,
material parameters, and nonlinear dynamic response, we clarify the physical
significance of nonlinear parameters that are obtained from fitting the
dynamics of nanomechanical systems, and provide a route for designing devices
with desired nonlinear behaviour.

<h3>Interrelationships between nematicity, antiferromagnetic spin  fluctuations and superconductivity: Role of hotspots in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$  revealed by high pressure $^{77}$Se NMR study</h3>

<br>
<br>
The sulfur-substituted FeSe, FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x} $, is one of the unique
systems that provides an independent tunability of nematicity,
antiferromagnetism and superconductivity under pressure ($p$). Recently Rana et
al. [Phys. Rev. B 101, 180503(R) (2020)] reported, from $^{77}$Se nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on FeSe$_{0.91}$S$_{0.09}$ under
pressure, that there exists a clear role of nematicity on the relationship
between antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuations and superconducting
transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) where the AFM spin fluctuations are more
effective in enhancing $T_{\rm c}$ in the absence of nematicity than with
nematicity. Motivated by the work, we carried out $^{77}$Se NMR measurements on
FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ with $x$= 0.15 and 0.29 under pressure up to 2.10 GPa to
investigate the relationship in a wide range of $x$ in the FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$
system. Based on the new results together with the previously reported data for
$x$=0 [P. Wiecki et al., Phys. Rev. B 96, 180502(R) (2017)] and 0.09 [K. Rana
et al. Phys. Rev. B 101, 180503(R) (2020)], we established a $p$ - $x$ -
temperature ($T$) phase diagram exhibiting the evolution of AFM spin
fluctuations. From the systematic analysis of the NMR data, we found that the
superconducting (SC) state in nematic state arises from a non Fermi liquid
state with strong stripe-type AFM spin fluctuations while the SC state without
nematicity comes from a Fermi liquid state with mild stripe-type AFM spin
fluctuations. Furthermore, we show that the previously reported impact of
nematicity on the relationship between AFM fluctuations and superconductivity
holds throughout the wide range of $x$ from $x$ = 0 to 0.29 in
FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ under pressure. We discuss the origin of the role of
nematicity in terms of the different numbers of hotspots on Fermi surfaces with
and without nematicity.

Some d-electron superconductors, such as cuprates and iron arsenides, exhibit
various unique superconductivities that have attracted attention in condensed
matter physics. However, they are not ubiquitous. Exotic superconductivity in
d-electron systems usually appears in materials with specific combinations of
transition-metal elements and crystal structure, which precludes a full
understanding thereof. Here we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity
in Sc6MTe2 with seven kinds of transition-metal elements M. The critical
temperatures for M = 3d were higher than those for M = 4d and 5d and varied
systematically, reaching the highest Tc = 4.7 K for M = Fe. The upper critical
fields for M = Os and Ir were significantly enhanced by the strong spin-orbit
coupling. These results showed Sc6MTe2 to constitute a unique family of
d-electron superconductors displaying superconductivity in all 3d, 4d, and 5d
cases, in which the electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling of d electrons
played roles.

Recently, effective one-dimensional configuration coordinate diagrams have
been utilized to calculate the line shapes of luminescence spectra and
non-radiative carrier capture coefficients via point defects. Their
calculations necessitate accurate calculations of total energies as a function
of configuration coordinates. Although supercells under periodic boundary
conditions are commonly employed, the spurious cell size effects have not been
previously considered. In this study, we have proposed a correction energy
formalism and verified its effectiveness by applying it to a nitrogen vacancy

<h3>Laplacian dynamics of convergent and divergent swarm behaviors</h3>

Swarming phenomena are ubiquitous in various physical, biological, and social
systems, where simple local interactions between individual units lead to
complex global patterns. A common feature of diverse swarming phenomena is that
the units exhibit either convergent or divergent evolution in their behaviors,
i.e., becoming increasingly similar or distinct, respectively. The associated
dynamics changes across time, leading to complex consequences on a global
scale. In this study, we propose a generalized Laplacian dynamics model to
describe both convergent and divergent swarm behaviors, where the trends of
convergence and divergence compete with each other and jointly determine the
evolution of global patterns. We empirically observe non-trivial
phase-transition-like phenomena between the convergent and divergent evolution
phases, which are controlled by local interaction properties. We also propose a
conjecture regarding the underlying phase transition mechanisms and outline the
main theoretical difficulties for testing this conjecture. Overall, our
framework may serve as a minimal model of swarm behaviors and their intricate
phase transition dynamics.

Antiferromagnetic states with no stray magnetic fields can enable
high-density ultra-fast spintronic technologies. However, the detection and
control of antiferromagnetic Neel vectors remain challenging. Linear
magnetoelectric antiferromagnets (LMAs) may provide new pathways, but applying
simultaneous electric and magnetic fields, necessary to control Neel vectors in
LMAs, is cumbersome and impractical for most applications. Herein, we show that
Cr2O3, a prototypical room-temperature LMA, carries a topologically-protected
surface magnetism in all surfaces, which stems from intrinsic surface electric
fields due to band bending, combined with the bulk linear magnetoelectricity.
Consequently, bulk Neel vectors with zero bulk magnetization can be simply
tuned by magnetic fields through controlling the magnetizations associated with
the surface magnetism. Our results imply that the surface magnetizations
discovered in Cr2O3 should be also present in all LMAs.

<h3>Transport properties of a non-Hermitian Weyl semimetal</h3>

In recent years, non-Hermitian (NH) topological semimetals have garnered
significant attention due to their unconventional properties. In this work, we
explore the transport properties of a three-dimensional dissipative Weyl
semi-metal formed as a result of the stacking of two-dimensional Chern
insulators. We find that unlike Hermitian systems where the Hall conductance is
quantized, in presence of non-Hermiticity, the quantized Hall conductance
starts to deviate from its usual nature. We show that the non-quantized nature
of the Hall conductance in such NH topological systems is intimately connected
to the presence of exceptional points (EPs). We find that in the case of open
boundary conditions, the transition from a topologically trivial regime to a
non-trivial topological regime takes place at a different value of the momentum
than that of the periodic boundary spectra. This discrepancy is solved by
considering the non-Bloch case and the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ).
Finally, we present the Hall conductance evaluated over the GBZ and connect it
to the separation between the Weyl nodes, within the non-Bloch theory.

<h3>Irregularity of polymer domain boundaries in two dimensional polymer  solution</h3>

<br>
<br>
Polymer chains comprising a polymer solution in strict two dimensions (2D)
are characterized with irregular domain boundaries, and their fractal dimension
($\mathcal{D}^{\partial}$) varies with the area fraction of the solution and
the solvent quality. We find that $\mathcal{D}^{\partial}$ in good solvents
changes non-monotonically from $\mathcal{D}^{\partial}=4/3$ in dilute phase to
$\mathcal{D}^{\partial}=5/4$ in dense phase, maximizing to
$\mathcal{D}^{\partial}\approx 3/2$ at a critical area fraction, whereas for
polymers in $\Theta$ solvents $\mathcal{D}^{\partial}$ remains constant at
$\mathcal{D}^{\partial}=4/3$ from dilute to semi-dilute phase. Using polymer
physics arguments, we rationalize these values. We find that the maximum
irregularity of $\mathcal{D}^\partial\approx 3/2$ results from "fjord"-like
corrugations formed along the domain boundaries which also maximize at the same
critical area fraction. According to the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE), the
outer-boundary of the $SLE_{\kappa}$ curves with $\kappa=4$, which lies at a
crossover point between simple non-intersecting curves and those with
self-intersection, has the fractal dimension of $\mathcal{D}^\partial=3/2$, and
this is in fact the upper bound of $\mathcal{D}^{\partial}$ that $SLE_\kappa$
can have.

<h3>Superglitter and squarodiamond, novel C12 (sp2/sp3) and C16 (sp3)  allotropes from first principles</h3>

Original carbon allotropes C12 and C16 called superglitter and squarodiamond
from relationships with literature glitter and squaroglitter respectively are
shown through DFT-based geometry to be cohesive with energy dependent
properties as hardness from the elastic constants, the phonon band structures,
and thermal behavior related to diamond. Like C6 glitter, C12 superglitter
exhibiting mixed sp2-sp3 carbon hybridization shows metallic behavior and
moderate hardness and metallic behavior arising from trigonal C(sp2) forming
C=C pairs connecting tetrahedra. Oppositely, C16 showing square C4 motifs as in
squaroglitter characterized by both sp2-sp3 carbons, is characterized by edge
and corner sharing tetrahedra with only sp3 carbons resulting in insulating
behavior and shear modulus and Vickers hardness H(V) larger than 100 GPa as
well as heat capacity alike diamond, whence its labeling as squarodiamond. The
novel carbon allotropes are proposed as an opportunity to enrich the carbon
database and the materials science with potentials of applications as abrasives
and in electronic devices.

<h3>Direct in situ determination of the surface area and structure of  deposited metallic lithium within lithium metal batteries using ultra small  and small angle neutron scattering</h3>

<br>
<br>
Despite being the major cause of battery safety issues and detrimental
performance, a comprehensive growth mechanism for metallic lithium deposited at
electrode surfaces in lithium metal batteries remains elusive. While lithium
surface morphology is often derived indirectly, here, detailed information is
directly obtained using in situ small and ultra-small angle neutron scattering,
in bulk and non-destructively. Features of 1-10 um and 100-300 nm are
identified; the latter contribute to most of the surface area and their size
inversely correlates to applied current density. Surface area per unit volume
increases continuously during charging from 1-4 h at 2 mA/cm2 but more slowly
during discharge. Comparatively higher values are reached after just 1 h at 20
mA/cm2 which remain constant in subsequent cycles. Such quantitative insight
into the processes of metallic lithium growth within batteries may enable the
development of safer high performance lithium metal batteries.

<h3>Controlling particle current in a many-body quantum system by external  driving</h3>

<br>
<br>
We propose a method to control the particle current of a one-dimensional
quantum system by resonating two many-body states through an external driving
field. We consider the Bose-Hubbard and spinless Fermi-Hubbard models with the
Peierls phase which induces net particle currents in the many-body eigenstates.
A driving field couples the ground state with one of the excited states having
large net currents, enabling us to control the system's current via Rabi
oscillation. Employing the Floquet analysis, we find that the resonate excited
states are determined by the symmetry of the driving field, which allows us to
selectively excite only certain states among the dense spectrum of a many-body
quantum system.

Gold selenide (AuSe) is a multilayer compound yet to be thoroughly studied.
The colloidal synthesis and characterization of gold selenide nanoparticles are
described, emphasizing the effect of different gold-to-selenium precursor
ratios and temperatures on the crystal structure and form. The structural
characterization is done using an X-ray diffraction pattern. The coexistence of
the {\alpha}- and {\beta}-AuSe phases is observed in all synthesized samples.
The morphologies of the mainly {\alpha}-AuSe sample are nanobelts, whereas the
primarily {\beta}-AuSe phase sample has a nanoplate-like structure, according
to the TEM and SEM data. All of the samples had Raman vibrational modes with
mixed phases. The effect of high pressure on as-prepared AuSe samples has been
studied in this work. The introduction of external pressure and temperature
allows both phases to transition. Pressure lowers the existence of other phase
modes, and the corresponding dominating sample modes are entirely significant
in our sample. The phase transition pressure was observed using Raman
scattering. Our findings show that 2D AuSe has a lot of promise for
multifunctional applications, encouraging more research on these systems.

<h3>Enhanced Spin-polarization via Partial Ge1-dimerization as the Driving  Force of the 2$\times$2$\times$2 CDW in FeGe</h3>

<i>Yilin Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
A $2\times2\times2$ charge density wave (CDW) was recently observed deep
inside the antiferromagnetic phase of a Kagome metal FeGe. A key question is
whether the CDW in FeGe is driven by its electronic correlation and magnetism.
Here, we address this problem using density functional theory and its
combination with $U$ as well as dynamical mean-field theory. Our calculations
show that large dimerization ($\sim 1.3 \overset{\lower.5em\circ}{\mathrm{A}}$)
of Ge1-sites along $c$-axis will enhance electronic correlation of the Fe-$3d$
orbitals and, as a result, it enhances the spin-polarization and saves more
magnetic exchange energies. We find that the balance between magnetic energy
saving and structural energy cost via partially dimerizing Ge1-sites in an
enlarged superstructure, could induce a new local minimum in total energies.
The response to the large partial Ge1-dimerization will induce additional small
modulations ($<0.05 \overset{\lower.5em\circ}{\mathrm{A}}$) of other sites in
the Kagome and honeycomb layers, which further reduces the total energy and
leads to a stable $2\times 2\times 2$ CDW ground state in FeGe. Our results are
in good agreement with the existing experiments and reveal a novel CDW
mechanism driven by the interplay of structure, electronic correlation and
magnetism.

<h3>Geometric symmetry breaking and nonlinearity can increase thermoelectric  power</h3>

<br>
<br>
Direct thermal-to-electric energy converters typically operate in the linear
regime, where the ratio of actual maximum power relative to the ideal maximum
power, the so-called fill factor (FF), is 0.25. By increasing the FF one can
potentially increase maximum power by up to four times, but this is only
possible in the nonlinear regime of transport and has previously rarely been
considered. Here we show, based on fundamental symmetry considerations, that
the leading order non-linear terms that can increase the FF require devices
with broken spatial symmetry. To experimentally demonstrate such a system, we
study nonlinear, thermoelectric transport across an asymmetric energy barrier
epitaxially defined in a single semiconductor nanowire. We find in both
experiment and theory that we can increase the FF above the linear-response
limit of 0.25, accompanied by a drastic increase in short circuit current,
open-circuit voltage and maximum power. Our results show that geometric
symmetry breaking combined with the design of nonlinear behaviour represent a
design strategy for increasing the performance of thermal-to-electric energy
converters such as in hot-carrier photovoltaics, thermophotovoltaics or in
anisotropic thermoelectric materials.

<h3>Topological superconductivity in doped magnetic moiré semiconductors</h3>

<br>
<i>Valentin Crépel, Daniele Guerci, Jennifer Cano, J. H. Pixley, Andrew Millis</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that topological superconductivity may emerge upon doping of
transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers above an integer-filling
magnetic state of the topmost valence moir\'e band. The effective attraction
between charge carriers is generated by an electric p-wave Feshbach resonance
arising from interlayer excitonic physics and has a tuanble strength, which may
be large. Together with the low moir\'e carrier densities reachable by gating,
this robust attraction enables access to the long-sought p-wave BEC-BCS
transition. The topological protection arises from an emergent time reversal
symmetry occurring when the magnetic order and long wavelength magnetic
fluctuations do not couple different valleys. The resulting topological
superconductor features helical Majorana edge modes, leading to half-integer
quantized spin-thermal Hall conductivity and to charge currents induced by
circularly polarized light or other time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields.

<br>
<br>
This work is about uniform, plane, singly connected, strictly regular
Hall-plates with an arbitrary number of peripheral contacts exposed to a
uniform magnetic field of arbitrary strength. The strictly regular symmetry is
the highest possible degree of symmetry, and it is found in commercial
Hall-plates for magnetic field sensors or circulators. It means that all
contacts and contact spacings are equally large, if the Hall-plate is mapped
conformally to the unit disk. The indefinite conductance matrices of such
Hall-plates are circulant matrices, whose complex eigenvalues can be computed
in closed form. It is shown how to express the conductance and resistance
matrices of these Hall-plates, how to compute their equivalent resistor
circuit, their Hall-output voltages or currents, their signal-to-thermal noise
ratio, and their power as functions of the eigenvalues. It is also proven that
the noise efficiency of strictly regular Hall-plates with many contacts can be
up to 112% better than for conventional Hall-plates with four contacts, and it
is explained why their optimal biasing uses patterns of supply voltages or
currents, which vary sinusoidally along their boundary.

Open-shell benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, known as magnetic
nanographenes, exhibit unconventional p-magnetism arising from topological
frustration or strong electronic-electron (e-e) interaction. Imprinting
multiple strongly entangled spins into polyradical nanographenes creates a
major paradigm shift in realizing non-trivial collective quantum behaviors and
exotic quantum phases in organic quantum materials. However, conventional
design approaches are limited by a single magnetic origin, which can restrict
the number of correlated spins or the type of magnetic ordering in open-shell
nanographenes. Here, we present a novel design strategy combing topological
frustration and e-e interactions to fabricate the largest fully-fused
open-shell nanographene reported to date, a 'butterfly'-shaped tetraradical on
Au(111). We employed bond-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and spin
excitation spectroscopy to unambiguously resolve the molecular backbone and
reveal the strongly correlated open-shell character, respectively. This
nanographene contains four unpaired electrons with both ferromagnetic and
anti-ferromagnetic interactions, harboring a many-body singlet ground state and
strong multi-spin entanglement, which can be well described by many-body
calculations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the nickelocene magnetic probe
can sense highly-correlated spin states in nanographene. The ability to imprint
and characterize many-body strongly correlated spins in polyradical
nanographenes not only presents exciting opportunities for realizing
non-trivial quantum magnetism and phases in organic materials but also paves
the way toward high-density ultrafast spintronic devices and quantum
information technologies.

We investigate how a symmetric, porous object immersed in an active fluid
becomes motile due to a negative drag acting in the direction of its velocity.
Previous research has suggested that this phenomenon is restricted to active
fluids that possess polar or nematic order. However, using mean-field analysis,
we demonstrate that such motility can occur even in active fluids without any
preexisting order. The emergence of object motility is characterized by both
continuous and discontinuous transitions associated with the symmetry-breaking
bifurcation of the object's steady-state velocity. Furthermore, we also discuss
the relevance of the transitions to the nonmonotonic particle-size dependence
of the object's diffusion coefficient.

<h3>Constructing and evaluating machine-learned interatomic potentials for  Li-based disordered rocksalts</h3>

<br>
<i>Vijay Choyal, Nidhish Sagar, Gopalakrishnan Sai Gautam</i>
<br>
<br>
Lithium-based disordered rocksalts (LDRs), which are an important class of
cathodes for advanced Li-ion batteries, represent a complex chemical and
configurational space for conventional density functional theory (DFT)-based
high-throughput screening approaches. Notably, atom-centered machine-learned
interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are a promising pathway to accurately model the
potential energy surface of highly-disordered systems, such as LDRs, where the
performance of such MLIPs have not been rigorously explored yet. Here, we
represent a comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy, transferability, and ease
of training of five MLIPs in modelling LDRs, including artificial neural
network potential developed by the atomic energy network (AENET), Gaussian
approximation potential (GAP), spectral neighbor analysis potential (SNAP) and
its quadratic extension (qSNAP), and moment tensor potential (MTP).
Specifically, we generate a DFT-calculated dataset of 10842 disordered
LiTMO$_2$ and TMO$_2$ configurations, where TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni,
and/or Cu. Importantly, we find AENET to be the best in terms of accuracy and
transferability for energy predictions, while MTP is the best for atomic
forces. While AENET is the fastest to train at low number of epochs, the
training time increases significantly as epochs increase, with a corresponding
reduction in training errors. Note that AENET and GAP tend to overfit in small
datasets, with the extent of overfitting reducing with larger datasets.
Finally, we observe AENET to provide reasonable predictions of average
Li-intercalation voltages in layered, single-TM LiTMO$_2$ frameworks, compared
to DFT ($\sim$10% error on average). Our study should pave the way both for
discovering novel LDR electrodes and for modelling other configurationally
complex systems, such as high-entropy ceramics and alloys.

The quantum Fisher information (QFI) associated with a particular process
applied to a many-body quantum system has been suggested as a diagnostic for
the nature of the system's quantum state, e.g., a thermal density matrix vs. a
pure state in a system that obeys the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis
(ETH). We compute the QFI for both an energy eigenstate and a thermal density
matrix for a variety of processes in a system obeying ETH, including a change
in the hamiltonian that is either sudden (a quench), slow (adiabatic), or
followed by contact with a heat bath. We compare our results with earlier
results for a local unitary transformation.

A new nonlinear magnetothermal effect, namely unidirectional Seebeck
effect(USE), has been recently reported in magnetic/nonmagnetic topological
insulator (TI) heterostructure and is ascribed to the asymmetry magnon
scattering. Here, we show a new mechanism to generate USE in the Rashba two
dimensional electron gas (2DEG), in which the magnetism or magnetic order is
completely absent. It's found that the USE has a quantum origin from the
spin-momentum locking generated from Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We find that
the USE exhibits a sine dependence on the orientation of the magnetic field
with respect to the direction of the temperature gradient and is dominant from
the states above the Lifshitz point. The USE in the semiconductor Ge(111)

<br>
<br>
Here, using the topological quantum chemistry theory, we present a strategy
to reach two-dimensional (2D) quasi-particles, which is benefiting from
featured floating surface states (FSSs) of a three-dimensional (3D) obstructed
atomic insulator (OAI). Symmetry of obstructed Wannier charge centers
guarantees that such FSSs degenerate at high symmetry points or invariant lines
in the surface Brillouin zone. Based on symmetry analysis and first-principles
calculations, we identify that a carbon allotrope with a 20-atom body-centered
tetragonal (bct) unit cell (\textit{i.e.}, termed bct-C$_{20}$), where the OAI
phase is verified, is an ideal candidate to achieve our strategy. There are
four in-gap FSSs, which simultaneously form two kinds of surface Dirac cones,
\textit{i.e.}, topological Dirac cones with linear dispersion and
symmetry-enforced quadratic Dirac cones. The band topology of surface Dirac
cone is depicted by the effective surface Hamiltonian and the emergence of a
hinge state. Our work would absolutely inspire interest in research concerning
revealing more 2D topological states and related practical applications.

Many important properties of nonequilibrium steady states depend on the
spectrum of the rate matrix, including autocorrelation functions, speed of

<br>
This letter presents our findings on the recursive band gap engineering of
chiral fermions in bilayer graphene doubly aligned with hBN. By utilizing two
interfering moir\'{e} potentials, we generate a supermoir\'{e} pattern which
renormalizes the electronic bands of the pristine bilayer graphene, resulting
in higher-order fractal gaps even at very low energies. These Bragg gaps can be
mapped using a unique linear combination of periodic areas within the system.
To validate our findings, we used electronic transport measurements to identify
the position of these gaps as functions of the carrier density and establish
their agreement with the predicted carrier densities and corresponding quantum
numbers obtained using the continuum model. Our work provides direct
experimental evidence of the quantization of the area of quasi-Brillouin zones
in supermoir\'{e} systems. It fills essential gaps in understanding the band
structure engineering of Dirac fermions by a recursive doubly periodic
superlattice potential.

The Kagome material $A{\mathrm{V}}_3{\mathrm{Sb}}_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) with
geometry frustration hosts non-trivial topological electronic structures,
electronic nematicity, charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity,
providing an ideal platform to study the interplay between these phases.
Specifically, in pressurized- or substituted-${\mathrm{CsV}}_3{\mathrm{Sb}}_5$,
the relationship between CDW and superconductivity is unusual and remains to be
fully understood. Recently, coexisting and competing 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 4
and 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 CDW phases were discovered in
${\mathrm{CsV}}_3{\mathrm{Sb}}_5$. To investigate the evolution of the CDW
phases with the substitution of V atoms, we performed x-ray diffraction (XRD)
experiments on
${\mathrm{Cs(V}}_{1-x}{\mathrm{Ta}}_{x}{\mathrm{)}}_3{\mathrm{Sb}}_5$ and
${\mathrm{Cs(V}}_{1-x}{\mathrm{Nb}}_{x}{\mathrm{)}}_3{\mathrm{Sb}}_5$. Our
results indicate that in all substituted samples, the discrete CDW reflection
points in pristine ${\mathrm{CsV}}_3{\mathrm{Sb}}_5$ change to rod-like
structures along the $c^\star$ direction. This suggests that the long-ranged
three-dimensional CDW becomes quasi-two-dimensional by the substitution of V by
Ta/Nb. Moreover, our temperature-dependent measurements show that there is no
hysteresis behavior of CDW signals, indicating that the 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 4
CDW phase is easily suppressed by even a slight substitution of V with Nb/Ta.
These findings uncover the CDW evolution upon substitution of V atoms in
CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, providing insights into the microscopic mechanism of CDW and
helping to understand the interplay between intertwined phases and
superconductivity.

<h3>Route to stabilize cubic gauche polynitrogen to ambient conditions via  surface-saturation by hydrogen</h3>

Cubic gauche polynitrogen (cg-N) is an attractive high-energy density
material. However, high-pressure synthesized cg-N will decompose at
low-pressure and cannot exist at ambient conditions. Here, the stabilities of
cg-N surfaces with and without saturations at different pressures and
temperatures are investigated systematically. Pristine surfaces at 0 GPa are
very brittle and will decompose at 300 K, especially (1 1 0) surface will
collapse completely just after structural relaxation, whereas the
decompositions of surfaces can be suppressed by applying pressure, indicating
that surface instability causes the cg-N decomposition at low-pressure. Due to
the saturation of dangling bonds and transferring electrons to the surfaces,
saturation with H can stabilize surfaces at ambient conditions, while OH
saturation cannot because of getting electrons from the surfaces. An acidic
environment or surface saturation with less electronegative adsorbates is more
favorable for the stability of polymerized nitrogen.

We report on the synthesis of LiCrTe$_2$ single crystals and on their
anisotropic magnetic properties. We have obtained these single crystals by
employing a Te/Li-flux synthesis method. We find LiCrTe$_2$ to crystallize in a
TlCdS$_2$ -type structure with cell parameters of $a$ = 3.9512(5) \r{A} and $c$
= 6.6196(7) \r{A} at $T$ = 175 K. The content of lithium in these crystals was
determined to be near stoichiometric by means of neutron diffraction. We find a
pronounced magnetic transition at $T^{\rm ab}_{\rm N}$ = 144 K and $T^{\rm
c}_{\rm N}$ = 148 K, respectively. These transition temperatures are
substantially higher than earlier reports on polycrystalline samples. We have
performed neutron powder diffraction measurements that reveal that the
long-range low-temperature magnetic structure of single crystalline LiCrTe$_2$
is an A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure. Our DFT calculations are in
good agreement with these experimental observations. We find the system to be
easy axis with moments oriented along the $c$-direction experimentally as well
as in our calculations. Thereby, the magnetic Hamiltonian can be written as $H
= H_{\rm Heisenberg} + \sum_i K_c (S_i^z)^2$ with $K_c=-0.34K$ (where
$|S^z|=\frac{3}{2}$). We find LiCrTe$_2$ to be highly anisotropic, with a
pronounced metamagnetic transition for $H \perp ab$ with a critical field of
$\mu H_{MM}$(5 K) $\approx$ 2.5 T. Using detailed orientation-dependent
magnetization measurements, we have determined the magnetic phase diagram of
this material. Our findings suggest that LiCrTe$_2$ is a promising material for
exploring the interplay between crystal structure and magnetism, and could have
potential applications in spin-based 2D devices.

Spin systems are a powerful tool for modeling a wide range of physical
systems. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for modeling spin systems
using differentiable programming. Our approach enables us to efficiently
simulate spin systems, making it possible to model complex systems at scale.
Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique by applying it
to three different spin systems: the Ising model, the Potts model, and the
Cellular Potts model. Our simulations show that our framework offers
significant speedup compared to traditional simulation methods, thanks to its
ability to execute code efficiently across different hardware architectures,
including Graphical Processing Units and Tensor Processing Units.

<h3>Charge Regulation of Polyelectrolyte Gels: Swelling Transition</h3>

We study the effects of charge-regulated acid/base equilibrium on the
swelling of polyelectrolyte gels, by considering a combination of the
Poisson-Boltzmann theory and a two-site charge-regulation model based on the
Langmuir adsorption isotherm. By exploring the volume change as a function of
salt concentration for both nano-gels and micro-gels, we identify conditions
where the gel volume exhibits a discontinuous swelling transition. This
transition is driven exclusively by the charge-regulation mechanism and is
characterized by a closed-loop phase diagram. Our predictions can be tested
experimentally for polypeptide gels.

We compute the $E_2$ pages of the momentum-space and real-space
Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS) for topological crystalline
insulators and superconductors up to three spatial dimensions, considering the
cell decomposition in which if a group action fixes a cell setwise then its
group action fixes the same cell pointwise. We provide a detailed description
of the implementation for computing the $E_2$ pages of AHSS. Under a physically
reasonable assumption, we enumerate all possible $K$-groups that are compatible
with the $E_2$ pages for both momentum and real-space AHSS. As a result, we
determine the $K$-groups for approximately 59\% of symmetry settings in three
spatial dimensions. All the results can be found at this http

<h3>Quantum quenches in driven-dissipative quadratic fermionic systems with  parity-time symmetry</h3>

We study the quench dynamics of noninteracting fermionic quantum many-body
systems that are subjected to Markovian drive and dissipation and are described
by a quadratic Liouvillian which has parity-time (PT) symmetry. In recent work,
we have shown that such systems relax locally to a maximum entropy ensemble
that we have dubbed the PT-symmetric generalized Gibbs ensemble (PTGGE), in
analogy to the generalized Gibbs ensemble that describes the steady state of
isolated integrable quantum many-body systems after a quench. Here, using
driven-dissipative versions of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and the
Kitaev chain as paradigmatic model systems, we corroborate and substantially
expand upon our previous results. In particular, we confirm the validity of a
dissipative quasiparticle picture at finite dissipation by demonstrating light
cone spreading of correlations and the linear growth and saturation to the
PTGGE prediction of the quasiparticle-pair contribution to the subsystem
entropy in the PT-symmetric phase. Further, we introduce the concept of
directional pumping phases, which is related to the non-Hermitian topology of
the Liouvillian and based upon qualitatively different dynamics of the dual
string order parameter and the subsystem fermion parity in the SSH model and
the Kitaev chain, respectively: Depending on the postquench parameters, there
can be pumping of string order and fermion parity through both ends of a
subsystem corresponding to a finite segment of the one-dimensional lattice,
through only one end, or there can be no pumping at all. We show that
transitions between dynamical pumping phases give rise to a new and independent
type of dynamical critical behavior of the rates of directional pumping, which
are determined by the soft modes of the PTGGE.

<h3>A regular Hamiltonian halting ratchet for matter wave transport</h3>

We report on the design of a Hamiltonian ratchet exploiting periodically at
rest integrable trajectories in the phase space of a modulated periodic
potential, leading to the linear non-diffusive transport of particles. Using
Bose-Einstein condensates in a modulated one-dimensional optical lattice, we
make the first observations of this new spatial ratchet transport. In the
semiclassical regime, the quantum transport strongly depends on the effective
Planck constant due to Floquet state mixing. We also demonstrate the interest
of quantum optimal control for efficient initial state preparation into the
transporting Floquet states to enhance the transport periodicity.

<h3>Distinguishing thermodynamics and spectroscopy for octupolar U(1) spin  liquid of Ce-pyrochlores</h3>

Inspired by the progress on the spin liquid candidates Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ and
Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ where the Ce ions carry the dipole-octupole doublets, we
analyze the distinction between the thermodynamic and spectroscopic
measurements for the octupolar U(1) spin liquid. Due to the peculiar properties
of octupolar U(1) spin liquid and the selective Zeeman coupling, both uniform
susceptibility and the spectroscopic measurements only probe the spinon
excitations, while the specific heat measures all excitations. After clarifying
the contents in each measurement, we observe that, thermodynamics carries the
information of single spinon, while the spectroscopy is associated with spinon
pairs. Such distinction immediately leads to the multiplicity relation of the
excitation gaps from different measurements that include the uniform
susceptibility, Knight shift and $1/T_1$ spin lattice relaxation of NMR and
$\mu$SR, and the inelastic neutron scattering measurements. We hope this little
work provides a useful recipe for the identification of fractionalization in
the octupolar U(1) spin liquid and other spin liquids.

Magnon, as elementary excitation in magnetic systems, can carry and transfer
angular momentum. Due to the absence of Joule heat during magnon transport,
researches on magnon transport have gained considerable interests over the past
decade. Recently, a full quantum theory has been employed to investigate magnon
transport in ferromagnetic insulators (FMIs). However, the most commonly used
magnetic insulating material in experiments, yttrium iron garnet (YIG), is a
ferrimagnetic insulator (FIMI). Therefore, a full quantum theory for magnon
transport in FIMI needs to be established. Here, we propose a Green's function
formalism to compute the magnon bulk and interface current in both FIMIs and
antiferromagnetic insulators (AFMIs). We investigate the spatial distribution
and temperature dependence of magnon current in FIMIs and AFMIs generated by
temperature or spin chemical potential step. In AFMIs, magnon currents
generated by temperature step in the two sublattices cancel each other out.
Subsequently, we numerically simulate the magnon junction effect using the
Green's function formalism, and result shows near 100\% magnon junction ratio.
This study demonstrates the potential for investigating magnon transport in
specific magnonic devices using a full quantum theory.

<h3>ARPES signatures of few-layer twistronic graphenes</h3>

<br>
Diverse emergent correlated electron phenomena have been observed in twisted
graphene layers due to electronic interactions with the moir\'e superlattice
potential. Many electronic structure predictions have been reported exploring
this new field, but with few momentum-resolved electronic structure
measurements to test them. Here we use angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) to study the twist-dependent ($1^\circ < \theta <
8^\circ$) electronic band structure of few-layer graphenes, including twisted
bilayer, monolayer-on-bilayer, and double-bilayer graphene (tDBG). Direct
comparison is made between experiment and theory, using a hybrid
$\textbf{k}\cdot\textbf{p}$ model for interlayer coupling and implementing
photon-energy-dependent phase shifts for photo-electrons from consecutive
layers to simulate ARPES spectra. Quantitative agreement between experiment and
theory is found across twist angles, stacking geometries, and back-gate
voltages, validating the models and revealing displacement field induced gap
openings in twisted graphenes. However, for tDBG at $\theta=1.5\pm0.2^\circ$,
close to the predicted magic-angle of $\theta=1.3^\circ$, a flat band is found
near the Fermi-level with measured bandwidth of $E_w = 31\pm5$ meV. Analysis of
the gap between the flat band and the next valence band shows significant
deviations between experiment ($\Delta_h=46\pm5$meV) and the theoretical model
($\Delta_h=5$meV), indicative of the importance of lattice relaxation in this
regime.

<h3>The effect of off-diagonal density matrix in DFT+DMFT for Li$_2$MnO$_3$</h3>

Li$_2$MnO$_3$ has garnered much attention as one of the new-generation
battery material, due to the high capacity and low cost. In the present work,
we performed density functional theory (DFT)+$U$ and dynamical mean field
theory (DMFT) calculations with continuous time quantum Monte Carlo impurity
solver to study the electronic properties of Li$_2$MnO$_3$. Due to the nature
of monoclinic $C2/m$ symmetry, the off-diagonal terms in the $d$-orbital block
Hamiltonian (and $d$-orbital density matrix) are large, which results the large
suppression of the energy gap due to the underestimation of the crystal-field
splitting. We diagonalize the Mn $d$ block in the full $p-d$ Hamiltonian by
applying unitary rotation matrix, and obtained an energy gap of 0.8eV, although
it is still smaller than the experimental gap of 2.1 eV even with the large
$U$. In the $p$-$d$ model, a small double counting energy is essential to
reduce the $p$-$d$ hybridization, thus to obtain the experimental gap. We show
that the low-energy ($d$-only basis) model is efficient to study the electronic
structure of Li$_2$MnO$_3$, since the Wannier basis is the hybridized state of
Mn $d$ and O $p$ orbitals. These results suggest the correct way to investigate
the low-symmetry materials using DFT+ DMFT method and to our knowledge, there
is no systematic study of the effect of the off-diagonal terms so far. We also
find that the antiferromagnetic ground state $\Gamma_{2u}$ is stable with $U
\leq 2$ within DFT+$U$, which is much smaller than widely used $U$=5 eV.

Intercalation is a process of inserting chemical species into the
heterointerfaces of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials. While much research
has focused on intercalating metals and small gas molecules into graphene, the
intercalation of larger molecules through the basal plane of graphene remains
highly unexplored. In this work, we present a new mechanism for intercalating
large molecules through monolayer graphene to form confined oxide materials at
the graphene-substrate heterointerface. We investigate the intercalation of
phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) molecules directly from the vapor phase and confirm
the formation of confined P2O5 at the graphene heterointerface using various
techniques. Density functional theory (DFT) corroborate the experimental
results and reveal the intercalation mechanism, whereby P2O5 dissociates into
small fragments catalyzed by defects in the graphene that then permeates
through lattice defects and reacts at the heterointerface to form P2O5. This
process can also be used to form new confined metal phosphates (e.g., 2D
InPO4). While the focus of this study is on P2O5 intercalation, the possibility
of intercalation from pre-dissociated molecules catalyzed by defects in
graphene may exist for other types of molecules as well. This study is a
significant milestone in advancing our understanding of intercalation routes of
large molecules via the basal plane of graphene, as well as heterointerface
chemical reactions leading to the formation of distinctive confined complex
oxide compounds.

<h3>Dispersion and Orientation patterns in nanorod-infused polymer melts</h3>

Introducing nanorods into a polymeric matrix can enhance the physical and
mechanical properties of the resulting material. In this paper, we focus on
understanding the dispersion and orientation patterns of nanorods in an
unentangled polymer melt, particularly as a function of nanorod concentration,
using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The system is comprised of flexible
polymer chains and multi-thread nanorods that are equilibrated in the NPT
ensemble. All interactions are purely repulsive except for those between
polymers and rods. Results with attractive versus repulsive polymer-rod
interactions are compared and contrasted. The concentration of rods has a
direct impact on the phase behaviour of the system. At lower concentrations
rods phase separate into nematic clusters, while at higher concentrations more
isotropic and less structured rod configurations are observed. A detailed
examination of the conformation of the polymer chains near the rod surface
shows extension of the chains along the director of the rods (especially within
clusters). The dispersion and orientation of the nanorods is a result of the
competition between depletion entropic forces responsible for the formation of
rod clusters, the enthalpic effects that improve mixing of rods and polymer,
and entropic losses of polymers interpenetrating rod clusters.

Conventional topological insulators exhibit exotic gapless edge or surface
states, as a result of non-trivial bulk topological properties. In
periodically-driven systems the bulk-boundary correspondence is fundamentally
modified and knowledge about conventional bulk topological invariants is
insufficient. While ultracold atoms provide excellent settings for clean
realizations of Floquet protocols, the observation of real-space edge modes has
so far remained elusive. Here we demonstrate an experimental protocol for
realizing chiral edge modes in optical lattices, by creating a topological
interface using a potential step that is generated with a programmable optical
potential. We show how to efficiently prepare particles in these edge modes in
three distinct Floquet topological regimes that are realized in a
periodically-driven honeycomb lattice. Controlling the height and sharpness of
the potential step, we study how edge modes emerge at the interface and how the
group velocity of the particles is modified as the sharpness of the potential
step is varied.

<h3>Obstructions in trivial metals as topological insulator zero-modes</h3>

<br>
<br>
Metals and topological insulators have in common that they cannot be
described by exponentially localized wave-functions. Here we establish a
relationship between these two seemingly unrelated observations. The connection
is explicit in the low-lying states of the spectral localizer of trivial
metals, an operator that measures the obstruction to finding localized
eigenstates. The low-lying spectrum of the spectral localizer of metals is
determined by the zero-mode solutions of Dirac fermions with a varying mass
parameter. We use this observation, valid in any dimension, to determine the
difference between the localizer spectrum of trivial and topological metals,
and conjecture the spectrum of the localizer for fractional quantum Hall edges.
Because the localizer is a local real-space operator, it may be used as a tool
to differentiate between non-crystalline topological and trivial metals, and to
characterize strongly correlated systems, for which local topological markers
are scarce.
