<h3>Driven tracer in the Symmetric Exclusion Process: linear response and beyond</h3>

Tracer dynamics in the Symmetric Exclusion Process (SEP), where hardcore
particles diffuse on an infinite one-dimensional lattice, is a paradigmatic
model of anomalous diffusion. While the equilibrium situation has received a
lot of attention, the case where the tracer is driven by some external force,
which provides a minimal model of nonequilibrium transport in confined crowded
environments, remains largely unexplored. Indeed, the only available analytical
results concern the means of both the position of the tracer and the lattice
occupation numbers in its frame of reference, and higher-order moments but only
in the high-density limit. Here, we provide a general hydrodynamic framework
that allows us to determine the first cumulants of bath-tracer correlations and
of the tracer position at linear order in the driving and at arbitrary density.
We also go beyond linear response by determining the second cumulant and the
corresponding density profile at quadratic order in the driving

<h3>Rectification of the spin Seebeck current in noncollinear antiferromagnets</h3>

In the absence of an external magnetic field and a spin-polarized charge
current, an antiferromagnetic system supports two degenerate magnon modes. An
applied thermal bias activates the magnetic dynamics, leading to a magnon flow
from the hot to the cold edge (magnonic spin Seebeck current). Both degenerate
bands contribute to the magnon current but the orientations of the magnetic
moments underlying the magnons are opposite in different bands. Therefore,
while the magnon current is nonzero, the net spin current is zero.
