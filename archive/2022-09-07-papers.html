<h3>Hydrodynamic magnetoresistance in graphene Corbino devices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02710" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02710</a>
<br>
<i>Alex Levchenko, Songci Li, A. V. Andreev</i>
<br>
We study hydrodynamic electron magnetotransport in graphene devices. We show
that in these systems a distinct mechanism of magnetoresistance appears, which
is absent in systems with Galilean-invariant electron liquid. The resulting
magnetoresistance depends on the intrinsic conductivity and viscosity of the
electron liquid, and becomes especially pronounced near charge neutrality. We
obtain analytic expressions for magnetoransport coefficients of Corbino
devices, and obtain estimates for the electrical and thermal magnetoresistances
for monolayer and bilayer systems at charge neutrality. Magnetoresistance
becomes strong (of order 100%) at relatively weak fields, at which the kinetic
coefficients of the electron liquid are practically unaffected by the magnetic
field.

<h3>The Jamming Transition and the Marginally Stable Solid</h3>

<br>
<i>Francesco Arceri, Eric I. Corwin, Corey S. O'Hern</i>
<br>
We review the physics of jamming from the theoretical, experimental and
numerical perspectives. We summarize the mean-field theory of jamming and the
marginally stable solid phase, with particular emphasis on the connection with
the Replica Symmetry Breaking theory of glasses. We report validations of the
mean-field theory of jamming from experimental and numerical studies of
critical behaviors near the transition. In particular, we describe the physics
of jamming of frictionless, spherical particles, as well as more recent work on
jamming of frictionless, non-spherical particles and frictional, nearly
spherical particles. We also present current efforts in expanding the
mean-field theory to systems that more closely resemble externally driven
granular media, cell aggregates, and active colloidal suspensions.

<h3>Entropy production and its large deviations in an active lattice gas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03000" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03000</a>
<br>
<i>Tal Agranov, Michael E. Cates, Robert L. Jack</i>
<br>
Active systems are characterized by a continuous production of entropy at
steady state. We study the statistics of entropy production within a
lattice-based model of interacting active particles that is capable of
motility-induced phase separation. Exploiting a recent formulation of the exact
fluctuating hydrodynamics for this model, we provide analytical results for its
entropy production statistics in both typical and atypical (biased) regimes.
This complements previous studies of the large deviation statistics of entropy
production in off-lattice active particle models that could only be addressed
numerically. Our analysis uncovers an unexpectedly intricate phase diagram,
with five different phases arising (under bias) within the parameter regime
where the unbiased system is in its homogeneous state. Notably, we find the
concurrence of first order and second order nonequilibrium phase transition
curves at a bias-induced tricritical point, a feature not yet reported in
previous studies of active systems.

<h3>Surface melting of a colloidal glass</h3>

<br>
<i>Li Tian, Clemens Bechinger</i>
<br>
Despite their technological relevance, a full microscopic understanding of
glasses is still lacking. This applies even more to their surfaces whose
properties largely differ from that of the bulk material. Here, we
experimentally investigate the surface of a two-dimensional glass as a function
of the effective temperature. To yield a free surface, we use an attractive
colloidal suspension of micron-sized particles interacting via tunable critical
Casimir forces. Similar to crystals, we observe surface melting of the glass,
i.e., the formation of a liquid film at the surface well below the glass
temperature. Underneath, however, we find an unexpected region with bulk
density but much faster particle dynamics. It results from connected clusters
of highly mobile particles which are formed near the surface and deeply
percolate into the underlying material. Because its thickness can reach several
tens of particle diameters, this layer may elucidate the poorly understood
properties of thin glassy films which find use in many technical applications

<h3>Average Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02723" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02723</a>
<br>
<i>Ruochen Ma, Chong Wang</i>
<br>
Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases are many-body quantum states that
are topologically nontrivial as long as the relevant symmetries are unbroken.
In this work we show that SPT phases are also well defined for average
symmetries, where quenched disorders locally break the symmetries, but restore
the symmetries upon disorder averaging. An example would be crystalline SPT
phases with imperfect lattices. Specifically, we define the notion of average
SPT for disordered ensembles of quantum states. We then classify and
characterize a large class of average SPT phases using a decorated domain wall
approach, in which domain walls (and more general defects) of the average
symmetries are decorated with lower dimensional topological states. We then
show that if the decorated domain walls have dimension higher than $(0+1)d$,
then the boundary states of such average SPT will almost certainly be
long-range entangled, with probability approaching $1$ as the system size
approaches infinity. This generalizes the notion of t'Hooft anomaly to average
symmetries, which we dub "average anomaly". The average anomaly can also
manifest as constraints on lattice systems similar to the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis
(LSM) theorems, but with only average lattice symmetries. We also generalize
our problem to "quantum disorders" that can admit short-range entanglement on
their own, and develop a theory of such generalized average SPTs purely based
on density matrices and quantum channels. Our results indicate that topological
quantum phenomena associated with average symmetries can be at least as rich as
those with ordinary exact symmetries.

<h3>Optical conductivity as a probe of the interaction-driven metal in  rhombohedral trilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02732" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02732</a>
<br>
<i>Vladimir Juričić, Enrique Muñoz, Rodrigo Soto-Garrido</i>
<br>
Study of the strongly correlated states in van der Waals heterostructures is
one of the central topics in modern condensed matter physics. Among these, the
rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG) occupies a prominent place since it hosts
a variety of interaction-driven phases, with the metallic ones yielding exotic
superconducting orders upon doping [H. Zhou {\it et al.}, Nature {\bf 598}, 429
(2021); {\it ibid.} {\bf 598}, 434 (2021)]. Motivated by these experimental
findings, we show within the framework of the low-energy Dirac theory that the
optical conductivity can distinguish different candidates for a paramagnetic
metallic ground state in this system. In particular, this observable shows a
single peak in the fully gapped valence-bond state. On the other hand, the
bond-current state features two pronounced peaks in the optical conductivity as
the probing frequency increases. Finally, the rotational symmetry breaking
charge-density wave exhibits a minimal conductivity with the value independent
of the amplitude of the order parameter, which corresponds precisely to the
splitting of the two cubic nodal points at the two valleys into two triplets of
the band touching points featuring linearly dispersing quasiparticles. These
features represent "smoking gun" signatures of different candidate
order-parameters for the paramagnetic metallic ground state, which should
motivate further experimental studies of the RTG.

<h3>A theory of criticality for quantum ferroelectric metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02733" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02733</a>
<br>
<i>Avraham Klein, Vladyslav Kozii, Jonathan Ruhman, Rafael M. Fernandes</i>
<br>
A variety of compounds, for example doped paraelectrics and polar metals,
exhibit both ferroelectricity and strongly correlated electron physics such as
low-density superconductivity and anomalous transport. Characterizing such
properties is tied to understanding the quantum dynamics of inversion symmetry
breaking in the presence of itinerant electrons. We present a comprehensive
analysis of the normal state properties of a metal near a quantum critical
transition to a ferroelectric state, in both two and three dimensions. Starting
from a minimal model of electrons coupled to a transverse polar phonon via a
Rashba-type spin-orbital interaction, we compute the system dynamical response
and find that the system can evince both Fermi and non-Fermi liquid phases, as
well as enhanced pairing with both s-wave and p-wave instabilities.
Furthermore, we systematically compute corrections to one-loop theory and find
a tendency to quantum order-by-disorder, leading to a phase diagram that can
include second order, first order, and finite-momentum phase transitions.
Finally, we show that the entire phase diagram can be controlled via
application of external strain, either compressive or volume-preserving. Our
results provide a map of the dynamical and thermodynamical phase space of
quantum ferroelectic metals, which can serve in characterizing existing
materials and in seeking applications for quantum technologies.

<h3>Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg criticality from $2+\boldsymbolε$  expansion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02734" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02734</a>
<br>
<i>Konstantinos Ladovrechis, Shouryya Ray, Tobias Meng, Lukas Janssen</i>
<br>
The Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality class describes a continuous quantum
phase transition between a Dirac semimetal and an antiferromagnetic insulator.
Such quantum critical points have originally been discussed in the context of
Hubbard models on $\pi$-flux and honeycomb lattices, but more recently also in
Bernal-stacked bilayer models, of potential relevance for bilayer graphene.
Here, we demonstrate how the critical behavior of this fermionic universality
class can be computed within an $\epsilon$ expansion around the lower critical
space-time dimension of two. This approach is complementary to the previously
studied expansion around the upper critical dimension of four. The crucial
technical novelty near the lower critical dimension is the presence of
different four-fermion interaction channels at the critical point, which we
take into account in a Fierz-complete way. By interpolating between the lower
and upper critical dimensions, we obtain improved estimates for the critical
exponents in 2+1 space-time dimensions. For the situation relevant to
single-layer graphene, we find an unusually small leading-correction-to-scaling
exponent, arising from the competition between different interaction channels.
This suggests that corrections to scaling may need to be taken into account
when comparing analytical estimates with numerical data from finite-size
extrapolations.

<h3>Hierarchy of quasi-symmetries and degeneracies in chiral crystal  materials CoSi</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02745" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02745</a>
<br>
<i>Lun-Hui Hu, Chunyu Guo, Yan Sun, Claudia Felser, Luis Elcoro, Philip J. W. Moll, Chao-Xing Liu, B. Andrei Bernevig</i>
<br>
In materials, certain approximated symmetry operations can exist in a
lower-order approximation of the effective model but are good enough to
influence the physical responses of the system, and these approximated
symmetries were recently dubbed "quasi-symmetries" \cite{guo_arxiv_2021}. In
this work, we reveal a hierarchy structure of the quasi-symmetries and the
corresponding nodal structures that they enforce via two different approaches
of the perturbation expansions for the effective model in the chiral crystal
material CoSi. In the first approach, we treat the spin-independent linear
momentum (k) term as the zero-order Hamiltonian. Its energy bands are four-fold
degenerate due to an SU(2)$\times$SU(2) quasi-symmetry. We next consider both
the k-independent spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and full quadratic-k terms as the
perturbation terms and find that the first-order perturbation leads to a model
described by a self-commuting "stabilizer code" Hamiltonian with a U(1)
quasi-symmetry that can protect nodal planes. In the second approach, we treat
the SOC-free linear-k term and k-independent SOC term as the zero-order. They
exhibit an SU(2) quasi-symmetry, which can be reduced to U(1) quasi-symmetry by
a choice of quadratic terms. Correspondingly, a two-fold degeneracy for all the
bands due to the SU(2) quasi-symmetry is reduced to two-fold nodal planes that
are protected by the U(1) quasi-symmetry. For both approaches, including
higher-order perturbation will break the U(1) quasi-symmetry and induce a small
gap $\sim$ 1 meV for the nodal planes. These quasi-symmetry protected near
degeneracies play an essential role in understanding recent quantum oscillation
experiments in CoSi.

<h3>Electrically-driven insulator-to-metal transition in a correlated  insulator: electronic mechanism and thermal description</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02758" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02758</a>
<br>
<i>Manuel I. Díaz, Jong E. Han, Camille Aron</i>
<br>
Motivated by the resistive switchings in transition-metal oxides (TMOs)
induced by a voltage bias, we study the far-from-equilibrium dynamics of an
electric-field-driven strongly-correlated model featuring a first-order
insulator-to-metal transition at equilibrium, namely the dimer-Hubbard model.
We use a non-equilibrium implementation of the dynamical cluster approximation
to access the steady-state spectral and transport properties. We show that the
electric field can drive both metal-to-insulator and insulator-to-metal
transitions. While they proceed by quite distinct mechanisms, specifically
simple heating of the metal vs. non-equilibrium effects in the correlated
charge gap, we show that both these non-equilibrium transitions can be unified
in a single framework once the excitations are accounted for in terms of an
effective temperature. This conceptual advance brings together the two sides of
the long-lasting debate over the origins of the electrically-driven resistive
switching in TMOs.

<h3>Dynamic coupling and spin-wave dispersions in a magnetic hybrid system  made of an artificial spin-ice structure and an extended NiFe underlayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02783" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02783</a>
<br>
<i>R. Negrello, F. Montoncello, M. T. Kaffash, M. B. Jungfleisch, G. Gubbiotti</i>
<br>
We present a combined experimental and numerical study of the spin-wave
dispersion in NiFe artificial spin-ice (ASI) system consisting of an array of
stadium-shaped nanoislands deposited on the top of a continuous NiFe film with
nonmagnetic spacer layers of varying thickness. The spin-wave dispersion,
measured by wavevector resolved Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy in the
Damon-Eshbach configuration, consists of a rich number of modes, with either
stationary or propagating character. We find that the lowest frequency mode
displays a bandwidth of approximately 0.5 GHz, which is independent of the
presence of the film underneath. On the contrary, the BLS intensity of some of
the detected modes strongly depends on the presence of the extended thin-film
underlayer. Micromagnetic simulations unveil the details of the dynamic
coupling between ASI lattice and film underlayer. Interestingly, the ASI
lattice facilitates dynamics of the film either specific wavelengths or
intensity modulation peculiar to the modes of the ASI elements imprinted in the
film. Our results demonstrate that propagating spin waves can be modulated at
the nanometer length scale by harnessing the dynamic mode coupling in the
vertical, i.e., the out-of-plane direction of suitably designed magnonic
structures.

<h3>Effect of nonhydrostatic pressure on the superconducting kagome metal  CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02794" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02794</a>
<br>
<i>Alexander A. Tsirlin, Brenden R. Ortiz, Martin Dressel, Stephen D. Wilson, Stephan Winnerl, Ece Uykur</i>
<br>
High-pressure single-crystal x-ray diffraction experiments reveal that the
superconducting kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ transforms from hexagonal ($P6/mmm$)
to monoclinic ($C2/m$) symmetry above 10 GPa if nonhydrostatic pressure
conditions are created in a diamond anvil cell with silicon oil as
pressure-transmitting medium. This is contrary to the behavior of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$
under quasi-hydrostatic conditions in neon, with the hexagonal symmetry
retained up to at least 20 GPa. Monoclinic distortion leaves the kagome planes
almost unchanged but deforms honeycomb nets of the Sb atoms. Using ab initio
density-functional calculations, we show that this distortion facilitates the
pressure-induced shift of van Hove singularities away from the Fermi level and
assists in the Fermi surface reconstruction caused by the formation of
interlayer Sb-Sb bonds, thus adding a structural transition component to the
reentrant behavior of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.

<br>
A general theory for the melting of two dimensional solids explaining the
variety of scenarios observed in different kind of models is up to date an open
problem. Although the celebrated KTHNY theory have been able to predict the
critical properties of the melting transition in a variety cases, it is already
known that it is not able to capture the occurrence of first order transitions
observed in certain systems. Moreover the analytical determination of
non-universal quantities like the melting temperature within this theory
remains widely open. In the present work we have developed a method that
combines Self Consistent Variational Approximation with the Renormalization
Group in order to deal simultaneously with the phonon fluctuations and the
topological defects present in the melting process of two dimensional crystals.
The method was applied with impressive success to the study of the phase
diagram of the Gaussian-core model, capturing not only the reentrant feature of
its 2D solid phase, but also the related critical temperatures as a function of
the density in quantitative detail. The developed method can be directly
applied to study the melting of any hexagonal simple crystal formed by
particles interacting through any finite pairwise interaction potential.
Additionally, it has the potential to explain the occurrence of first order
transitions in the melting process of two dimensional crystals.

<br>
We report the on-wafer characterization of $S$-parameters and microwave noise
temperature ($T_{50}$) of discrete metamorphic GaAs high electron mobility
transistors (HEMTs) at 40 K and 300 K over a range of drain-source voltages
($V_{DS}$). From these data, we extract a small-signal model and the drain
noise temperature ($T_{d}$) at each bias and temperature. We find that $T_d$
follows a superlinear trend with $V_{DS}$ at both temperatures. These trends
are interpreted by attributing drain noise to a thermal component associated
with the channel resistance and a component due to real-space transfer (RST) of
electrons from the channel to the barrier [1]. In the present devices at the
minimum $T_{50}$, RST contributes $\sim 10$% of the drain noise at cryogenic
temperatures. At 300 K, the contribution increases to over $\sim 60$% of the
total drain noise. This finding indicates that improving the confinement of
electrons in the quantum well could enable room-temperature receivers with up
to $\sim 50$% lower noise temperatures by decreasing the contribution of RST to
drain noise.

<h3>Semiclassical spin transport in LaO/STO system in the presence of  multiple Rashba spin orbit couplings</h3>

<br>
The interaction between the linear and cubic spin-orbit coupling with
magnetic moments and mobile spin-polarized carriers in the LaO/STO system
provides new avenues for spin transport applications. We study the interplay
between linear and cubic Rashba spin orbit coupling (RSOC) on in-plane magnetic
moments in the LaO/STO system using the Boltzmann transport theory based on the
relaxation time approximation (RTA) and the more refined Schliemann-Loss (SL)
delta-potential scattering model. In general, both methods yield a linear
(quadratic) relationship between the spin accumulation (spin current) when one
of the three RSOC strengths is varied and the other two fixed. The simultaneous
presence of multiple types of RSOC with distinct angular dependences is a key
ingredient in breaking the k-space symmetry of the Fermi surface, thus ensuring
a finite spin accumulation upon integration over the entire Fermi surface.
While the oft-used RTA method is sufficiently accurate for spin accumulation
calculations, the more refined SL model is required for spin current
calculations because the RTA method neglects the anisotropy of the Fermi
contour arising from the cubic RSOC terms. Based on the refined SL model and
under optimal tuning of the RSOC parameters, the spin charge conversion values
in LaO/STO is predicted to reach a remarkable efficiency of 30.

Topological metals are special conducting materials with gapless band
structures and nontrivial edge-localized resonances, whose discovery has proved
elusive because the traditional topological classification methods do not apply
in this context. Inspired by recent theoretical developments that leveraged
techniques from the field of $C^*$-algebras to identify topological metals
\cite{cerjan_local_2021}, here, we directly observe topological phenomena in
gapless acoustic crystals and provide a general experimental technique to
demonstrate their topology. Specifically, we not only observe robust
boundary-localized states in a topological acoustic metal, but also
re-interpret a composite operator, mathematically derived from the K-theory of
the problem, as a new Hamiltonian, whose physical implementation allows us to
directly observe a topological spectral flow and measure the topological
invariants. Our observations and experimental protocols may offer insights for
discovering topological behavior across a wide array of artificial and natural
materials that lack bulk band gaps.

<h3>Higher-order topological insulators in hyperbolic lattices</h3>

<br>

<br>
To explore the non-Euclidean generalization of higher-order topological
phenomena, we construct a higher-order topological insulator model in
hyperbolic lattices by breaking the time-reversal symmetry (TRS) of quantum
spin Hall insulators. We investigate three kinds of hyperbolic lattices, i.e.,
hyperbolic {4,5}, {8,3} and {12,3} lattices, respectively. The non-Euclidean
higher-order topological behavior is characterized by zero-energy effective
corner states appearing in hyperbolic lattices. By adjusting the variation
period of TRS breaking term, we obtain four, eight and twelve zero-energy
effective corner states in these three different hyperbolic lattices,
respectively. It is found that the number of zero-energy effective corner
states of a hyperbolic lattice depends on the variation period of TRS breaking
term. Via symmetry analysis, it is confirmed that the hyperbolic zero-energy
effective corner states are protected by both the particle-hole symmetry $P$
and the effective chiral symmetry $S_{\rm eff}$, where $S_{\rm eff}$ is a
combination of chiral symmetry $S$ and mirror symmetry $m_{z}$. The hyperbolic
zero-energy effective corner states remain stable unless both the particle-hole
symmetry and the effective chiral symmetry are broken simultaneously. The
topological nature of hyperbolic zero-energy effective corner states is further
confirmed by checking the robustness of the zero modes in the hyperbolic
lattices in the presence of disorder. Our work provides a route for the
research on hyperbolic higher-order topological insulator in the non-Euclidean
geometric systems.

<br>
<i>A. P. Garrido, A. R. Plastino, M. L. Ladrón de Guevara, V. M. Apel</i>
<br>
We investigate a variant of the SSH model consisting of an SSH chain with an
embedded Aharonov-Bohm quantum ring. The embedded ring gives rise to domain
wall states whose energy levels are in the band gap. The dependence of some of
the states on the ring's magnetic flux provides a mechanism to control the
entanglement between the two SSH edge fermion modes. The concurrence between
the edge modes depends periodically on the magnetic flux. In the deep
topological zone, for appropriate values of the flux, the concurrence reaches
the extreme values of $0$ and $1$, corresponding to vanishing entanglement and
to maximum entanglement. Therefore, the QR-SSH system offers a tuning mechanism
that can be used either as an entanglement modulator or as an entanglement
switch.

An optical absorption spectrum constitutes one of the most fundamental
material characteristics, with relevant applications ranging from material
identification to energy harvesting and optoelectronics. However, the database
of both experimental and computational spectra is currently lacking. In this
study, we designed a computational workflow for the optical absorption spectrum
and integrated the simulated spectra into the Materials Project. Using
density-functional theory, we computed the frequency-dependent dielectric
function and the corresponding absorption coefficient for more than 1000 solid
compounds of varying crystal structure and chemistry. The computed spectra show
excellent agreement, as quantified by a high value of the Pearson correlation,
with experimental results when applying the band gap correction from the HSE
functional. The demonstrated calculated accuracy in the spectra suggests that
the workflow can be applied in screening studies for materials with specific
optical properties.

Shapes of colloids matter at liquid interfaces. We explore the interactions
between rough-surfaced nanocolloids at the air--water interface through the
compaction of monolayers experimentally and numerically. Sufficiently rough
systems exhibit a non-trivial intermediate state between a gas-like state and a
close-packed jamming state due to roughness-induced capillary attraction. We
also find that roughness-induced friction lowers the jamming point, and the
tangential contact force owing to surface asperities can cause a gradual
off-plane collapse of the compressed monolayer.

<h3>Topology of vibrational modes predict plastic events in glasses</h3>

<br>

<br>
The plastic deformation of crystalline materials can be understood by
considering their structural defects such as disclinations and dislocations.
Although glasses are also solids, their structure resembles closely the one of
a liquid and hence the concept of structural defects becomes ill-defined. As a
consequence it is very challenging to rationalize on a microscopic level the
mechanical properties of glasses close to the yielding point and to relate
plastic events with structural properties. Here we investigate the topological
characteristics of the eigenvector field of the vibrational excitations of a
two-dimensional glass model, notably the geometric arrangement of the
topological defects as a function of vibrational frequency. We find that if the
system is subjected to a quasistatic shear, the location of the resulting
plastic events correlate strongly with the topological defects that have a
negative charge. Our results provide thus a direct link between the structure
of glasses prior their deformation and the plastic events during deformation.

<h3>Master equation approach to magnon relaxation and dephasing</h3>

<br>
There has been a recent upsurge of interest in the quantum properties of
magnons for quantum information processing. An important issue is to examine
the stability of quantum states of magnons against various relaxation and
dephasing channels. Since the interaction of magnons in magnetic systems may
fall in the ultra-strong and even deep-strong coupling regimes, the relaxation
process of magnon states is quite different from the more common quantum
optical systems. Here we study the relaxation and dephasing of magnons based on
the Lindblad formalism and derive a generalized master equation that describes
the quantum dynamics of magnons. Employing this master equation, we identify
two distinct dissipation channels for squeezed magnons, i.e., the local
dissipation and collective dissipation, which play a role for both ferromagnets
and antiferromagnets. The local dissipation is caused by the independent
exchange of angular momentum between the magnonic system and the environment,
while the collective dissipation is dressed by the parametric interactions of
magnons and it enhances the quantumness and thermal stability of squeezed
magnons. Further, we show how this formalism can be applied to study the pure
dephasing of magnons caused by four-magnon scattering and magnon-phonon
interactions. Our results provide the theoretical tools to study the
decoherence of magnons within a full quantum-mechanical framework and further
benefit the use of quantum states of magnons for information processing.

Nanoelectronic hybrid devices combining superconductors and a one-dimensional
nanowire are promising platforms to realize topological superconductivity and
its resulting exotic excitations. The bulk of experimental studies in this
context are transport measurements where conductance peaks allow to perform a
spectroscopy of the low lying electronic states and potentially to identify
signatures of the aforementioned excitations. The complexity of the
experimental landscape calls for a benchmark in an elemental situation. The
present work tackles such a task using an ultra-clean carbon nanotube circuit.
Specifically, we show that the combination of magnetic field, weak disorder and
superconductivity can lead to states clustering at low energy, as predicted by
the random matrix theory predictions. Such a phenomenology is very general and
should apply to most platforms trying to realize topological superconductivity
in 1D systems, thus calling for alternative probes to reveal it.

Spin waves are studied intensively for their intriguing properties and
potential use in future technology platforms for the transfer and processing of
information and microwave signals. The development of devices and materials for
spin-wave systems requires a lot of measurement time and effort, and thus
increasing the measurement throughput by extending the instrumentation
capabilities is of the essence. In this letter, we report on a new and
straightforward approach to increase the measurement throughput by fully
exploiting the wideband detection nature of the Brillouin light scattering
technique in single-shot experiments using a white-noise RF generator.

As the length scales of the smallest technology continue to advance beyond
the micron scale it becomes increasingly important to equip robotic components
with the means for intelligent and autonomous decision making with limited
information. With the help of a tabular Q-learning algorithm, we design a model
for training a microswimmer, to navigate quickly through an environment given
by various different scalar motility fields, while receiving a limited amount
of local information. We compare the performances of the microswimmer, defined
via time of first passage to a target, with performances of suitable reference
cases. We show that the strategy obtained with our reinforcement learning model
indeed represents an efficient navigation strategy, that outperforms the
reference cases. By confronting the swimmer with a variety of unfamiliar
environments after the finalised training, we show that the obtained strategy
generalises to different classes of random fields.

Chiral magnetic insulators manifest novel phases of matter where the sense of
rotation of the magnetization is associated with exotic transport phenomena.
Effective control of such phases and their dynamical evolution points to the
search and study of chiral fields like the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.
Here we combine experiments, numerics, and theory to study a zig-zag dipolar
lattice as a model of an interface between magnetic in-plane layers with
perpendicular magnetization. The zig-zag lattice comprises two parallel
sublattices of dipoles with perpendicular easy plane of rotation. The dipolar
energy of the system is exactly separable into a sum of symmetric and
antisymmetric long-range exchange interactions between dipoles, where the
antisymmetric coupling generates a nonlocal Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya field which
stabilizes winding textures with the form of chiral solitons. The
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction acts as a vector potential or gauge field of
the magnetic current and gives rise to emergent magnetic and electric fields
that allow the manifestation of the magnetoelectric effect in the system.

Condensed matter realization of a single Dirac cone of fermions in two
dimensions is a long-standing issue. Here we report the discovery of a single
gapless Dirac cone of half-quantized Hall conductance in a magnetically-doped
topological insulator heterostructure. It demonstrates that the Hall
conductance is half-quantized in the unit e^{2}/h when the parity symmetry is
invariant near the Fermi surface. The gapless Dirac point is stable and
protected by the local parity symmetry and the topologically nontrivial band
structure of the topological insulator. The one-half Hall conductance observed
in a recent experiment [Mogi et al, Nat. Phys. 18, 390 (2022)] is attributed to
the existence of the gapless Dirac cone. The results suggest a condensed matter
realization of a topological phase with a one-half topological invariant.

<br>
Exceptional points play a pivotal role in the topology of non-Hermitian
systems, and significant advances have been made in classifying exceptional
points and exploring the associated phenomena. Exceptional surfaces, which are
hypersurfaces of exceptional degeneracies in parameter space, can support
hypersurface singularities, such as cusps, intersections and swallowtail
catastrophes. Here we topologically classify the intersection singularity of
exceptional surfaces for a generic pseudo-Hermitian system with parity-time
symmetry. By constructing the quotient space under equivalence relations of
eigenstates, we reveal that the topology of such gapless structures can be
described by a non-Abelian free group on three generators. Importantly, the
classification predicts a new kind of non-Hermitian gapless topological phase
and can systematically explain how the exceptional surfaces and their
intersections evolve under perturbations with symmetries preserved. Our work
opens a new pathway for designing systems with robust topological phases, and
provides inspiration for applications such as sensing and lasing which can
utilize the special properties inherent in exceptional surfaces and
intersections.

<h3>First-principles predictions of tunable half metallicity in zigzag GaN  nanoribbons with possible applications in CO detection and spintronics</h3>

<br>
Based on systematic first-principles density-functional theory (DFT)
simulations, we predict that the zigzag GaN nanoribbons (ZGaNNR) can be used
both as highly efficient CO detectors as well as spin filters. Our calculations
performed both on infinitely long nanoribbons, and also on finite strands,
suggest that: (a) CO binds strongly at the edges of ZGaNNRs, and (b) that
several of the resultant configurations exhibit half-metallic behavior. We
considered various edge-passivation sites and found that all the resultant
structures are thermodynamically stable. The metallic, half-metallic, and
semiconducting configurations are observed as a function of CO passivation
coverage. We also compute the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of various
structures using the Landauer formalism and find that the devices made up of
half-metallic configurations act as highly-efficient spin filters. The effect
of CO concentration is also investigated which suggests a viable way to not
just tune the electronic band gap of ZGaNNRs, but also their half metallicity.
Our simulations thus suggest a new direction of research for possible device
applications of III-V heterostructures.

Photocatalytic nitrogen fixation is an important pathway for carbon
neutralization and sustainable development. Inspired by nitrogenase, the
participation of molybdenum can effectively activate nitrogen. A novel Ti/Mo
composites photocatalyst is designed by sintering the molybdenum
acetylacetonate precursor with TiO$_{2}$. The special carbon-coated hexagonal
photocatalyst is obtained which photocatalytic nitrogen fixation performance is
enhanced 16 times compared to pure TiO$_{2}$ at room temperature and ambient
pressure. The abundant surface defects in this composite were confirmed to be
the key factor for nitrogen fixation. The $^{15}$N$_{2}$ isotope labeling
experiment was used to demonstrate the feasibility of nitrogen to ammonia
conversion. Also, modelling on the interactions between light and the
synthesized photocatalyst particle was examined for the light absorption. The
optimum nitrogen fixation conditions have been examined, and the nitrogen
fixation performance can reach up to 432
${\mu}$g$\cdot$g$_{\text{cat}}^{-1}\cdot$h$^{-1}$. Numerical simulations via
the field-only surface integral method were also carried out to study the
interactions between light and the photocatalytic particles to further confirm
that it can be a useful material for photocatalyst. This newly developed Ti/Mo
composites provide a simple and effective strategy for photocatalytic nitrogen
fixation from air directly under ambient conditions.

<h3>Atypical magnetic behavior in the incommensurate  $[CH_3NH_3][Ni(HCOO)_3]$ hybrid perovskite</h3>

<br>
A plethora of temperature induced phase transitions have been observed in
$[CH_3NH_3][M(HCOO)_3]$ compounds, where M is Co(II) or Ni(II). Among them, the
nickel compound exhibits a combination of magnetic and nuclear
incommensurabil-ity below N\'eel temperature. Despite the fact that the
zero-field behavior has been previously addressed, here we study in depth the
macroscopic magnetic behavior of this compound to unveil the origin of the
atypical magnetic response found in it and in its parent family of formate
perovskites. In particular, they show a puzzling magnetization reversal in the
curves measured starting from low temperatures, after cooling under zero field.
The first atypical phenomena is the im-possibility of reaching zero
magnetization, even by nullifying the applied external field and even
compensating it for the influence earth's magnetic field. Relatively large
magnetic fields are needed to switch the magnetization from negative to
positive values or vice versa, which is compatible with a soft-ferromagnetic
system. The atypical path found in its first magnetization curve and hysteresis
loop at low temperatures is the most noticeable feature. The magnetization
curve switches from more than 1200 Oe from the first magnetization loop to the
subsequent magnetization loops. A feature that cannot be explained using a
model based on unbalanced pair of domains. As a result, we decipher this
behavior in light of the incommensurate structure of this material. We propose,
in particular, that the applied magnetic field induces a mag-netic phase
transition from a magnetically incommensurate structure to a magnetically
commensurate structure.

Finding stimuli capable of driving an imbalance of spin-polarised electrons
within a solid is the central challenge in the development of spintronic
devices. However, without the aid of magnetism, routes towards this goal are
highly constrained with only a few suitable pairings of compounds and driving
mechanisms found to date. Here, through spin- and angle-resolved photoemission
along with density functional theory, we establish how the $p$-derived bulk
valence bands of semiconducting 1T-HfSe$_2$ possess a local, ground-state spin
texture spatially confined within each Se-sublayer due to strong
sublayer-localised electric dipoles orientated along the $c$-axis. This hidden
spin-polarisation manifests in a `coupled spin-orbital texture' with
in-equivalent contributions from the constituent $p$-orbitals. While the
overall spin-orbital texture for each Se sublayer is in strict adherence to
time-reversal symmetry (TRS), spin-orbital mixing terms with net polarisations
at time-reversal invariant momenta are locally maintained. These apparent
TRS-breaking contributions dominate, and can be selectively tuned between with
a choice of linear light polarisation, facilitating the observation of
pronounced spin-polarisations at the Brillouin zone centre for all $k_z$. We
discuss the implications for the generation of spin-polarised populations from
1T-structured transition metal dichalcogenides using a fixed energy, linearly
polarised light source.

Systematic electrical transport characterizations were performed on
high-quality Bi2O2Se nanowires to illustrate its great transport properties and
further application potentials in spintronics. Bi2O2Se nanowires synthesized by
chemical vapor deposition method presented a high field-effect mobility up to
1.34*104 cm2V-1s-1, and exhibited ballistic transport in the low back-gate
voltage (Vg) regime where conductance plateaus were observed. When further
increasing the electron density by increasing Vg, we entered the phase coherent
regime and weak antilocalization (WAL) was observed. The spin relaxation length
extracted from the WAL was found to be gate tunable, ranging from ~100 nm to
~250 nm and reaching a stronger spin-obit coupling (SOC) than the
two-dimensional counterpart (flakes). We attribute the strong SOC and the gate
tunability to the presence of a surface accumulation layer which induces a
strong inversion asymmetry on the surface. Such scenario was supported by the
observation of two Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation frequencies that correspond to
two types of carriers, one on the surface, and the other in the bulk. The
high-quality Bi2O2Se nanowires with a high mobility and a strong SOC can act as
a very prospective material in future spintronics.

door to fascinating many-particle phenomena including the formation of
exciton-polaritons. These are hybrid quasi-particles inheriting properties of
both the constituent photons and excitons. In this work, we investigate the
so-far overlooked impact of dark excitons on the momentum-resolved absorption
spectra of hBN-encapsulated WSe$_2$ and MoSe$_2$ monolayers in the
strong-coupling regime. In particular, thanks to the efficient phonon-mediated
scattering of polaritons into energetically lower dark exciton states, the
absorption of the lower polariton branch in WSe$_2$ is much higher than in
MoSe$_2$. It shows unique step-like increases in the momentum-resolved profile
indicating opening of specific scattering channels. We study how different
externally accessible quantities, such as temperature or mirror reflectance,
change the optical response of polaritons. Our study contributes to an improved
microscopic understanding of exciton-polaritons and their interaction with
phonons, potentially suggesting experiments that could determine the energy of
dark exciton states via momentum-resolved polariton absorption.

High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted extensive interest due to their
exceptional mechanical properties and the vast compositional space for new
HEAs. However, understanding their novel physical mechanisms and then using
these mechanisms to design new HEAs are confronted with their high-dimensional
chemical complexity, which presents unique challenges to (i) the theoretical
modeling that needs accurate atomic interactions for atomistic simulations and
(ii) constructing reliable macro-scale models for high-throughput screening of
vast amounts of candidate alloys. Machine learning (ML) sheds light on these
problems with its capability to represent extremely complex relations. This
review highlights the success and promising future of utilizing ML to overcome
these challenges. We first introduce the basics of ML algorithms and
application scenarios. We then summarize the state-of-the-art ML models
describing atomic interactions and atomistic simulations of thermodynamic and
mechanical properties. Special attention is paid to phase predictions,
planar-defect calculations, and plastic deformation simulations. Next, we
review ML models for macro-scale properties, such as lattice structures, phase
formations, and mechanical properties. Examples of machine-learned
phase-formation rules and order parameters are used to illustrate the workflow.
Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and present an outlook of research
directions, including uncertainty quantification and ML-guided inverse
materials design.

<br>
Recently, compounds with noncentrosymmetric crystal structure have attracted
much attention for providing a rich playground in search for unconventional
superconductivity. NbIr$_2$B$_2$ is a new member to this class of materials
harboring superconductivity below $T_{\rm c} = 7.3(2)$~K and very high upper
critical field that exceeds Pauli limit. Here we report on muon spin rotation
($\mu$SR) experiments probing the temperature and field dependence of effective
magnetic penetration depth in this compound. Our transverse-field -$\mu$SR
results suggest a fully gaped $s$-wave superconductvity. Further, the estimated
high value of upper critical field is also supplemented by high field transport
measurements. Remarkably, the ratio $T_{\rm c}$/$\lambda^{-2}(0)$ obtained for
NbIr$_2$B$_2$ ($\sim$2) is comparable to those of unconventional
superconductors. Zero-field $\mu$SR data reveals no significant change in the
muon spin relaxation rate above and below $T_{\rm c}$, evincing that
time-reversal symmetry is preserved in the superconducting state. The presented
results will stimulate theoretical investigations to obtain a microscopic
understanding of the origin of superconductivity with preserved time reversal
symmetry in this unique noncentrosymmetric system.

<br>
Using the Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation, the magnetic and thermodynamic
behaviours of a spin-1/2, trilayered ferrimagnetic system on triangular
monolayers with quenched non-magnetic impurity are studied. Two different
theoretical atoms, A and B, make up the ABA and AAB types of distinct
configurations. Like atoms (A-A and B-B) interact ferromagnetically, while
unlike atoms (A-B) interact antiferromagnetically. Only the A-layers are
randomly site-diluted with dilution percentages ranging from 5% to 45%. Such
diluted magnetic thin systems exhibit compensation phenomenon which depends
sensitively on the concentration of impurities. The phase diagram in the
Hamiltonian parameter space related to the occurrence of magnetic compensation
phenomenon and the effect of site dilution is discussed in detail. Special
attention is given to the mathematical dependencies of compensation temperature
on the concentration of non-magnetic impurities. Depending upon the
concentration of site dilution, the compensation and critical points shift with
equilibrium magnetic behaviours changing between distinct types of
ferrimagnetic behaviours. For each combination of the coupling strengths, we
find after a threshold concentration of site-dilution, compensation starts to
appear where previously compensation was absent. Possible mathematical forms of
dependencies of threshold concentration on Hamiltonian parameters are also
proposed.

<h3>Automatic structural optimization of tree tensor networks</h3>

<i>Toshiya Hikihara, Hiroshi Ueda, Kouichi Okunishi, Kenji Harada, Tomotoshi Nishino</i>
<br>
Tree tensor network (TTN) provides an essential theoretical framework for the
practical simulation of quantum many-body systems, where the network structure
defined by the connectivity of the isometry tensors plays a crucial role in
improving its approximation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a TTN algorithm
that enables us to automatically optimize the network structure by local
reconnections of isometries to suppress the bipartite entanglement entropy on
their legs. The algorithm can be seamlessly implemented to such a conventional
TTN approach as density-matrix renormalization group. We apply the algorithm to
the inhomogeneous antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chain having a hierarchical
spatial distribution of the interactions. We then demonstrate that the
entanglement structure embedded in the ground-state of the system can be
efficiently visualized as a perfect binary tree in the optimized TTN. Possible
improvements and applications of the algorithm are also discussed.

<h3>Transport evidence for the surface state and spin-phonon interaction in  FeTe$_{0.5}$Se$_{0.5}$</h3>

<br>
The iron chalcogenides have been proved to be intrinsic topological
superconductors to implement quantum computation because of their unique
electronic structures. The topologically nontrivial surface states of
FeTe$_{0.5}$Se$_{0.5}$ have been predicted by several calculations and then
confirmed by high-resolution photoemission and scanning tunneling experiments.
However, so far, the shreds of the electrical transport evidence for
topological surface states are still in absence. By carrying out electrical
transport experiments, we observe a topological transition with a nonlinear
Hall conductivity and simultaneous linear magnetoresistance near the
superconducting transition temperature. Furthermore, we observe a sign reversal
of the Hall coefficient accompanied by a concurrently softening of the
${A}_{1g}$ phonon mode at about 40 K, indicating a nematic transition. The
synchronized phonon softening with nematicity manifests an enhanced fluctuation
state through spin-phonon interaction. Our results solidly corroborate the
topological surface states of FeTe$_{0.5}$Se$_{0.5}$ and provide an
understanding of the mechanism of the superconductivity in iron chalcogenides.

We present the theory and numerical evaluations of the backscattering rate
determined by acceptor holes or Mn spins in HgTe and (Hg,Mn)Te quantum wells in
the quantum spin Hall regime. The role of anisotropic s-p and sp-d exchange
interactions, Kondo coupling, Luttinger liquid effects, precessional dephasing,

<h3>Floquet Hofstadter butterfly in trilayer graphene with a twisted top  layer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03295" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03295</a>
<br>
<i>Nadia Benlakhouy, Ahmed Jellal, Hocine Bahlouli</i>
<br>
The magnetic field generated Hofstadter butterfly in twisted trilayer
graphene (TTLG) is investigated using circularly polarized light (CPL) and
longitudinal light emanating from a waveguide. We show that TTLG has two
distinct chiral limits in the equilibrium state, and the central branch of the
butterfly splits into two precisely degenerate components. The Hofstadter
butterfly appears to be more discernible. We also discovered that CPL causes a
large gap opening at the central branch of the Hofstadter butterfly energy
spectrum and between the Landau levels (LLs), with a clear asymmetry
corresponding to energy $E = 0$. We point out that for right-handed CPL, the
central band shifts downward, in stark contrast to left-handed CPL, where the
central band shifts upward. Finally, we investigated the effect of
longitudinally polarized light, which originates from a waveguide.
Interestingly, we observed that the chiral symmetries of the Hofstadter
butterfly energy spectrum are broken for small driving strengths and get
restored at large ones, contrary to what was observed in twisted bilayer
graphene (TBLG).

One-dimensional (1D) van der Waals (vdW) materials offers nearly defect-free
strands as channel material in the field-effect transistor (FET) devices and
probably, a better interconnect than conventional copper with higher current
density and resistance to electro-migration with sustainable down-scaling. We
report a new halide based "truly" 1D few-chain atomic thread, PdBr$_2$,
isolable from its bulk which crystallizes in a monoclinic space group C2/c.
Liquid phase exfoliated nanowires with mean length (20$\pm$1)$\mu$m transferred
onto SiO$_2$/Si wafer with a maximum aspect ratio of $\approx 5000$ confirms
the lower cleavage energy perpendicular to chain direction. Gate-dependent
electrical transport measurement of a single wire bridged between source-drain
electrodes confirms the out-of-the-common p-type FET characteristics with the
highest mobility of 6850 cm$^\mathrm{2}$V$^\mathrm{-1}$s$^\mathrm{-1}$ and a
maximum ON/OFF ratio of $10^4$. Moreover, an isolated nanowire can also sustain
current density of 200 MA/cm$^\mathrm{2}$ which is atleast one-order higher
than typical copper interconnects. However, local transport measurement via
conducting atomic force microscopy (CAFM) tip along the cross direction of the
single chain records a much lower current density due to the anisotropic
electronic band structure. While 1D nature of the nanoobject can be linked with
non-trivial collective quantum behavior, vdW nature could be beneficial for the
new pathways in interconnect fabrication strategy with better control of
placement in an integrated circuit (IC).

<h3>Entanglement evolution after a global quench across a conformal defect</h3>

<br>
<i>Luca Capizzi, Viktor Eisler</i>
<br>
We study the evolution of entanglement after a global quench in a
one-dimensional quantum system with a localized impurity. For systems described
by a conformal field theory, the entanglement entropy between the two regions
separated by the defect grows linearly in time. Introducing the notion of
boundary twist fields, we show how the slope of this growth can be related to
the effective central charge that emerges in the study of ground-state entropy
in the presence of the defect. On the other hand, we also consider a particular
lattice realization of the quench in a free-fermion chain with a conformal
defect. Starting from a gapped initial state, we obtain the slope via a
quasiparticle ansatz and observe small discrepancies between the field theory
and lattice results, which persist even in the limit of a vanishing gap.

<h3>Water dimer driven DNA base superstructure with mismatched  hydrogen-bonding</h3>

<br>
The existence of water dimers in equilibrium water vapor at room temperature
and their anomalous properties revealed by recent studies suggest the benchmark
role of water dimer in both experiment and theory. However, there has been a
limited observation of individual water dimers due to the challenge of water
separation and generation at the single-molecule level. Here, we achieve
real-space imaging of individual confined water dimers embedded inside
self-assembled layer of a DNA base, adenine, on Ag(111). The hydration of the
adenine layers by these water dimers causes a local surface chiral inversion in
a way that the neighboring homochiral adenine molecules become heterochiral
after hydration, resulting in a mismatched hydrogen-bond pattern between
neighboring adenine molecules. Furthermore, the mutual influence between the
adenine superstructure and these dynamic confined water dimers is corroborated
by theoretical simulation and calculations. The observation of single confined
water dimers offers an unprecedented approach to studying the fundamental forms
of water clusters and their interaction with the local chemical environment.

With the ever-growing interest in quantum computing, understanding the
behaviour of excitons in monolayer quantum dots has become a topic of great
relevance. In this paper, we consider a Wannier exciton confined in a
triangular quantum dot of hexagonal Boron Nitride. We begin by outlining the
adequate basis functions to describe a particle in a triangular enclosure,
analyzing their degeneracy and symmetries. Afterwards, we discuss the excitonic
hamiltonian inside the quantum dot and study the influence of the quantum dot
dimensions on the excitonic states.

<h3>New experimental evidence for Podkletnov effect</h3>

Podkletnov effect [Physica C (1992)] consists in a decrease in weight (up to
2 wt. %) of arbitrary samples placed over a massive YBa2Cu3O6+d (YBCO) disk,
which is in the superconducting state and under the influence of an alternating
magnetic field. It has been pointed out that the partial weight loss may be a
result of energy state existing in the superconducting disk at low
temperatures. There are known unsuccessful attempts to reproduce the effect in
other laboratories. It has been noted that the most problem was the
manufacturing of a needed massive superconducting disk with a two-layer
specific structure. Our paper presents experimental results that we believe may
be related to the sought effect - similar inexplicable changes in weight have
been obtained for YBCO samples after they had been exposed to an alternating
magnetic field. The results, however, have been obtained in a different
experimental realization. Changes in weight are observed for the YBCO material
itself, which is in a non-superconducting state at room temperature but
exhibits slight diamagnetic properties. Instead of the complexly formed disc,
our material represents partially hydrated powder. In our case, values of the
inexplicable weight changes, which are well reproducible from sample to sample,
are about 0.01 wt. %.

<h3>Condensate formation in a dark state of a driven atom-cavity system</h3>

<br>
We demonstrate condensate formation in a dark state in an ultracold quantum
gas coupled to a high-finesse cavity and pumped by a shaken optical lattice. We
show experimentally and theoretically that the atoms in the dark state display
a strong suppression of the coupling to the cavity. On the theory side, this is
supported by solving the dynamics of a minimal three-level model and of the
full atom-cavity system. The symmetry of the condensate wave function is
anti-symmetric with respect to the potential minima of the pump lattice, and
displays a staggered sign along the cavity direction. This symmetry decouples
the dark state from the cavity, and is preserved when the pump intensity is
switched off.

<h3>Dynamical Signatures of Symmetry Broken and Liquid Phases in an $S=1/2$  Heisenberg Antiferromagnet on the Triangular Lattice</h3>

<br>
We present the dynamical spin structure factor of the antiferromagnetic
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice obtained
from large-scale matrix-product state simulations. The high frustration due to
the combination of antiferromagnetic nearest and next-to-nearest neighbour
interactions yields a rich phase diagram. We resolve the low-energy excitations
both in the $120^{\circ}$-ordered phase and in the putative spin liquid phase
at $J_2/J_1 = 0.125$. In the ordered phase, we observe an avoided decay of the
lowest magnon-branch, demonstrating the robustness of this phenomenon in the
presence of gapless excitations. Our findings in the spin-liquid phase chime
with the field-theoretical predictions for a gapless Dirac spin liquid, in
particular the picture of low-lying monopole excitations at the corners of the
Brillouin zone. We comment on possible practical difficulties of distinguishing
proximate liquid and solid phases based on the dynamical structure factor.
