<h3>Dynamic Scaling of Two-Dimensional Polar Flocks</h3>

<p>We propose a hydrodynamic description of the homogeneous ordered phase of
polar flocks. Starting from symmetry principles, we construct the appropriate
equation for the dynamics of the Goldstone mode associated with the broken
rotational symmetry. We then focus on the two-dimensional case considering both
"Malthusian flocks" for which the density field is a fast variable that does
not enter the hydrodynamic description and "Vicsek flocks" for which it does.
In both cases, we argue in favor of scaling relations that allow to compute
exactly the scaling exponents, which are found in excellent agreement with
previous simulations of the Vicsek model and with the numerical integration of
our hydrodynamic equations.

<h3>Interaction-driven Roton Condensation in C = 2/3 Fractional Quantum  Anomalous Hall State</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03258" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03258</a>

</p><i>Hongyu Lu, Han-Qing Wu, Bin-Bin Chen, Kai Sun, Zi Yang Meng</i>
<p>The interplay of topological order and charge order exhibits rich physics.
Recent experiments that succesfully realized the frational quantum anomalous
Hall (FQAH) effect in twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers and rhombohedral multilayer
graphene without external magnetic field further call for deeper understanding
of the relation between topological order and charge order in quantum moir\'e
materials. In the archetypal correlated flat-band model on checkerboard
lattice, a FQAH smectic state with coexistent topological order and smectic
charge order has been numerically discovered at filling $\nu$ = 2/3. In this
work, we explore the global ground-state phase diagram of the model with
competing interactions and find a C = 2/3 FQAH phase surrounded by four
different charge density wave (CDW) phases. In particular, we identify a
FQAH-CDW transition triggered by roton condensation, in that, the minimal roton
gap continues to decrease at the same finite momentum, along with the diverging
density flucuations at the transition point, after which the system enters into
a CDW metal phase with the same ordered wavevector. Our discovery points out
that the charge-neutral roton modes can play a significant role in a transition
from FQAH topological order to CDW symmetry-breaking order, discussed in FQH
literature while severely neglected in FQAH systems.

<p>Precipitates in Nickel-based superalloys form during heat treatment on a time
scale inaccessible to direct molecular dynamics simulation, but could be
studied using kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). This requires reliable values for the
barrier energies separating distinct configurations over the trajectory of the
system. In this study, we validate vacancy migration barriers found with the
Activation-Relaxation Technique nouveau (ARTn) method in partially ordered
Ni$_{75}$Al$_{25}$ with a monovacancy using published potentials for the atomic
interactions against first-principles methods. In a first step, we confirm that
the ARTn barrier energies agree with those determined with the nudged elastic
band (NEB) method. As the number of atoms used in those calculations is too
great for direct ab initio calculations, we then cut the cell size to 255
atoms, thus controlling finite size effects. We then use the plane-wave density
functional theory (DFT) code CASTEP and its inbuilt NEB method in the smaller
cells. This provides us with a continuous validation chain from first
principles to kinetic Monte Carlo simulations with interatomic potentials. We
then evaluate the barrier energies of five further interatomic potentials with
NEB, demonstrating that none yields these with sufficient reliability for KMC
simulations, with some of them failing completely. This is a first step towards
quantifying the errors incurred in KMC simulations of precipitate formation and
evolution.

<h3>Understanding the Interlayer Coupling in 1T/1H-NbSe$_2$ Hetero-Bilayers</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03302" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03302</a>

</p><i>Roman Pico, Paula Abufager, Ignacio Hamad, Roberto Robles, Nicolas Lorente</i>
<p>The properties of 2D materials are strongly influenced by their substrate,
leading to a variety of "proximity effects" like screening, charge transfer,
and hybridization. Surprisingly, there is a dearth of theoretical studies on
these effects. Particularly, previous theoretical research on the Star of David
(SOD) structure in 1T-NbSe$_2$ has focused on single-layer configurations or
stacking with the same 1T phase without any real substrate. Here, we depart
from these approaches and explore how these proximity effects shape the
electronic and magnetic properties of the 1T-NbSe$_2$ phase when it is grown on
the metallic 1H-NbSe$_2$ substrate. Using Density Functional Calculations, we
establish a common framework to define the key characteristics of both
free-standning 1T-NbSe$_2$ and 1H-NbSe$_2$. We then identify the optimal
stacking arrangement for these two layers, revealing a transfer from the 1T to
the 1H phase and a reorganization of charge within each layer. Our findings
indicate that the magnetic moment of the SOD structure is still robust;
however, is diminished due to a reduction in the on-site Coulomb interaction of
the Hubbard bands. Additionally, the interlayer coupling induces metallicity in
the 1T phase and increases the decoupling of the lower Hubbard band from the
valence band.

<h3>Temporal relaxation of disordered many-body quantum systems under  driving and dissipation</h3>

<p>Strong disorder inhibits thermalization in isolated quantum systems and may
lead to many-body localization (MBL). In realistic situations, however, the
observation of MBL is hindered by residual couplings of the system to an
environment, which acts as a bath and pushes the system to thermal equilibrium.
This paper is concerned with the transient dynamics prior to thermalization and
studies how the relaxation of a disordered system is altered under the
influence of external driving and dissipation. We consider a scenario where a
disordered quantum spin chain is placed into a strong magnetic field that
polarizes the system. By suddenly removing the external field, a nonequilibrium
situation is induced and the decay of magnetization probes the degree of
localization. We show that by driving the system with light, one can
distinguish between different dynamical regimes as the spins are more or less
susceptible to the drive depending on the strength of the disorder. We provide
evidence that some of these signatures remain observable at intermediate time
scales even when the spin chain is subject to noise due to coupling to an
environment. From a numerical point of view, we demonstrate that the
open-system dynamics starting from a class of experimentally relevant mixed
initial states can be efficiently simulated by combining dynamical quantum
typicality with stochastic unraveling of Lindblad master equations.

<h3>Observation of Chiral Surface State in Superconducting NbGe$_2$</h3>

<p>The interplay between topology and superconductivity in quantum materials
harbors rich physics ripe for discovery. In this study, we investigate the
topological properties and superconductivity of the nonsymmorphic chiral
superconductor NbGe$_2$ using high-resolution angle-resolved pho-toemission
spectroscopy (ARPES), transport measurements, and ab initio calculations. The
ARPES data revealed exotic chiral surface states on the (100) surface
originating from the inherent chiral crystal structure. Supporting calculations
indicate that NbGe$_2$ likely hosts elusive Weyl fermions in its bulk
electronic structure. Furthermore, we uncovered the signatures of van Hove
singularities that can enhance many-body interactions. Additionally, transport
measurements demonstrated that NbGe$_2$ exhibits superconductivity below 2K.
Overall, our comprehensive results provide the first concrete evidence that
NbGe$_2$ is a promising platform for investigating the interplay between
non-trivial band topology, possible Weyl fermions, van Hove singularities, and
superconductivity in chiral quantum materials.

<h3>Relating the Hall conductivity to the many-body Chern number using  Fermi's Golden rule and Kramers-Kronig relations</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03340" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03340</a>

</p><i>Nathan Goldman, Tomoki Ozawa</i>
<p>This pedagogical piece provides a surprisingly simple demonstration that the
quantized Hall conductivity of correlated insulators is given by the many-body
Chern number, a topological invariant defined in the space of twisted boundary
conditions. In contrast to conventional proofs, generally based on the Kubo
formula, our approach entirely relies on combining Kramers-Kronig relations and
Fermi's golden rule within a circular-dichroism framework. This pedagogical
derivation illustrates how the Hall conductivity of correlated insulators can
be determined by monitoring single-particle excitations upon a circular drive,
a conceptually simple picture with direct implications for quantum-engineered
systems, where excitation rates can be directly monitored.

<h3>Magnon kinetic theory of the antiferromagnetic Hanle effect</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03358" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03358</a>
<br>
</p><i>Eric Kleinherbers, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak</i>
<p>Motivated by the recently discovered magnonic Hanle effect in an insulating
antiferromagnet [Wimmer et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 247204 (2020)], we
develop a spin transport theory based on low-energy waves of antiferromagnetic
N\'eel order. These waves have two polarizations, which we describe in analogy
to optics using the Stokes vector on the Poincar\'e sphere. We find that the
polarization, which encodes the magnon spin angular momentum, changes
periodically with a frequency that is nonlinear in the magnetic field. This
explains the observed asymmetry in the Hanle signal as a function of the
magnetic field, along with other salient experimental features. By providing an
energy-resolved description of the spin injection, our theory combines the
kinetic transport of magnons with the coherent dynamics of their polarization
in an intuitive way. This opens a general perspective on a coherent control of
magnonic spin density in collinear antiferromagnets.

<p>Liquid crystals are the prototype of the so-called soft condensed matter. In
simple terms they are "structured liquids" that historically have received a
lot of interest because they help to generate new concepts and knowledge in
Physics, and possess important electro--optical applications, e. g., in
displays of mobile computers and telephones. More recently, it has been
discovered that liquid crystals could be applied in fabrication of
metamaterials and in biomedicine where they are potentially useful for tissue
identification, controlled drug delivery and detection of bacteria and viruses.
However, in Mexico, liquid crystals courses are included only in a few
undergraduate programs on Physics being elective in most of the cases.
Therefore, literature for teaching about liquid crystals in Spanish is scarce.
In this paper we will discuss about elementary Physics of liquid crystals and
the mathematical tools that permit to analyze them. We will explain, mainly,
how to analytically characterize the symmetry and order of static uniaxial
nematic liquid crystals, the most simple of all liquid crystal phases. We will
conduct this explanation in basic terms, suitable for science and engineering
students at intermediate undergraduate level, with knowledge about linear
algebra and vector calculus, willing to approach for the first time to this
subject. Our goal is to support the Latin American scientific community in
preparing human resources in this field. The article is written in Spanish to
contribute to the establishment and communication of concepts that only exist
in other languages in the specialized literature.

<h3>Two-dimensional Kagome-in-Honeycomb materials (MN$_4$)$_3$C$_{32}$ (M=Pt  or Mn)</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Jingping Dong, Miao Gao, Xun-Wang Yan, Fengjie Ma, Zhong-Yi Lu</i>
<p>We propose two novel two-dimensional (2D) topological materials,
(PtN$_4$)$_3$C$_{32}$ and (MnN$_4$)$_3$C$_{32}$, with a special geometry that
we named as kagome-in-honeycomb (KIH) lattice structure, to illustrate the
coexistence of the paradigmatic states of kagome physics, Dirac fermions and
flat bands, that are difficult to be simultaneously observed in
three-dimensional realistic systems. In such system, MN$_4$(M=Pt or Mn)
moieties are embedded in honeycomb graphene sheet according to kagome lattice
structure, thereby resulting in a KIH lattice. Using the first-principles
calculations, we have systemically studied the structural, electronic, and
topological properties of these two materials. In the absence of spin-orbit
coupling (SOC), they both exhibit the coexistence of Dirac/quadratic-crossing
cone and flat band near the Fermi level. When SOC is included, a sizable
topological gap is opened at the Dirac/quadratic-crossing nodal point. For
nonmagnetic (PtN$_4$)$_3$C$_{32}$, the system is converted into a
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological quantum spin Hall insulator defined on a curved
Fermi level, while for ferromagnetic (MnN$_4$)$_3$C$_{32}$, the material is
changed from a half-semi-metal to a quantum anomalous Hall insulator with
nonzero Chern number and nontrivial chiral edge states. Our findings not only
predict a new family of 2D quantum materials, but also provide an
experimentally feasible platform to explore the emergent kagome physics,
topological quantum Hall physics, strongly correlated phenomena, and theirs
fascinating applications.

<h3>Competing magnetic correlations and uniaxial anisotropy in  (Fe$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$)$_2$AlB$_2$ single crystals</h3>

<p>We have succeeded for the first time in synthesizing single crystals of
nanolaminated borides (Fe$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$)$_2$AlB$_2$ in the entire Fe-Mn
composition range using the Al self-flux method, and have established $T$-$x$,
$H$-$T$ and three-dimensional $H$-$T$-$x$ magnetic phase diagrams from the
results of magnetization measurements. The ferromagnetic correlation of
Fe$_2$AlB$_2$ is weakened with the Mn substitution, whereas the
antiferromagnetic correlation of Mn$_2$AlB$_2$ is enhanced with the Fe up to
$x=0.65$. The spin direction in the magnetic ordered states changes from the
$a$ to the $b$ axis with increasing Mn concentration and temperature. At $x$ =
0.31-0.46, there are three magnetic phases; ferromagnetic, antiferromganetic,
and intermediate phases in between. At $x$ = 0.65 and 0.74, a spin-flop-like
metamagnetic transition was observed at a finite field parallel to the spin
direction. These observations indicate that in (Fe$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$)$_2$AlB$_2$
the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic correlations coexist and the uniaxial
magnetic anisotropy competes between the $a$ and $b$ axes.

<br>
</p><i>Jun-Yi Shan, Nathaniel Morrison, Su-Di Chen, Feng Wang, Eric Y. Ma</i>
<p>Microwave impedance microscopy (MIM) is an emerging scanning probe technique
for nanoscale complex permittivity mapping and has made significant impacts in
diverse fields from semiconductors to quantum materials. To date, the most
significant hurdles that limit its widespread use are the requirements of
specialized microwave probes and high-precision cancellation circuits. Here we
show that forgoing both elements not only is feasible but actually enhances MIM
performance. Using monolithic silicon cantilever probes and a cancellation-free
architecture, we demonstrate thermal Johnson-noise-limited, drift-free MIM
operation with 15 nm spatial resolution, minimal topography crosstalk, and an
unprecedented sensitivity of 0.26 zF/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$. We accomplish this by
taking advantage of the high mechanical resonant frequency and spatial
resolution of silicon probes, the inherent common-mode phase noise rejection of
self-referenced homodyne detection, and the exceptional stability of the
streamlined architecture. Our approach makes MIM drastically more accessible
and paves the way for more advanced operation modes and integration with
complementary techniques.

<p>Capillary-driven flow of fluids occurs frequently in nature and has a wide
range of technological applications in the fields of industry, agriculture,
medicine, biotechnology, and microfluidics. By using the Onsager variational
principle, we propose a model to systematically study the capillary imbibition
in titled tubes, and find different laws of time-dependent capillary invasion
length for liquid-liquid displacement system other than Lucas-Washburn type
under different circumstances. The good agreement between our model and
experimental results shows that the imbibition dynamics in a capillary tube
with a prefilled liquid slug can be well captured by the dynamic equation
derived in this paper. Our results bear important implications for macroscopic
descriptions of multiphase flows in microfluidic systems and porous media.

<h3>Systematic Improvement of DMC Calculations in Transition Metal Oxides:  sCI-Driven Wavefunction Optimization for Reliable Band Gaps predictions</h3>

</p><i>Hyeondeok Shin, Kevin Gasperich, Tomas Rojas, Anh T. Ngo, Jaron T. Krogel, Anouar Benali</i>
<p>Accurate determination of electronic properties of correlated oxides remains
a significant challenge for computational theory. Traditional Hubbard-corrected
density functional theory (DFT+U) frequently encounters limitations in
precisely capturing electron correlation, particularly when predicting band
gaps. We introduce a systematic methodology to enhance the accuracy of
diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) simulations for both ground and excited states,
focusing on LiCoO$_2$ as a case study. By employing a selected CI (sCI)
approach, we demonstrate the capability to optimize wavefunctions beyond the
constraints of single-reference DFT+U trial wavefunctions. We show that the sCI
framework enables accurate prediction of band gaps in LiCoO$_2$, closely
aligning with experimental values and substantially improving upon traditional
computational methods. The study uncovers a nuanced mixed state of $t_{2g}$ a
$e_g$ orbitals at the band edges that is not captured by conventional
single-reference methods, further elucidating the limitations of PBE+U in
describing $d$-$d$ excitations. Our findings advocate for the adoption of
beyond-DFT methodologies, such as sCI, to capture the essential physics of
excited state wavefunctions in strongly correlated materials. The improved
accuracy in band gap predictions and the ability to generate more reliable
trial wavefunctions for DMC calculations underscore the potential of this
approach for broader applications in the study of correlated oxides. This work
not only provides a pathway for more accurate simulations of electronic
structures in complex materials but also suggests a framework for future
investigations into the excited states of other challenging systems.

<p>The counterflow superfluidity (CSF) was predicted two decades ago.
Counterintuitively, while both components in the CSF have fluidity, their
correlated counterflow currents cancel out leading the overall system to an
incompressible Mott insulator. However, realizing and identifying the CSF
remain challenging due to the request on extreme experimental capabilities in a
single setup. Here, we observe the CSF in a binary Bose mixture in optical
lattices. We prepare a low-entropy spin-Mott state by conveying and merging two
spin-1/2 bosonic atoms at every site and drive it adiabatically to the CSF at
$\sim$ 1 nK. Antipair correlations of the CSF are probed though a site- and
spin-resolved quantum gas microscope in both real and momentum spaces. These
techniques and observations provide accessibility to the symmetry-protected
topological quantum matters.

<h3>Impurities, or dopants, that is the question</h3>

</p><i>Baptiste Gault, Leonardo Shoji Aota, Mathias Kr√§mer, Se-Ho Kim</i>
<p>The numerous stories around LK-99 as a possible room-temperature
superconductor over the summer of 2023 epitomise that materials are more than a
bulk crystallographic structure or an expected composition. Like all materials,
those at the core of technologies for the energy generation transition,
including batteries, catalysts or quantum materials draw their properties from
a hierarchy of microstructural features where impurities can dramatically
influence the outcomes. As we move towards a circular economy, the recycling of
materials will inevitably create fluxes of increasingly impure materials,
generating new challenges for fabricating materials with controlled properties.
Here, we provide our perspective on how high-end microscopy and microanalysis
have helped us to understand relationships between synthesis, processing and
microstructure, avoiding imprecise or even erroneous interpretations on the
origins of the properties from a range of materials. We highlight examples of
how unexpected impurities and their spatial distribution on the nanoscale can
be turned into an advantage to define pathways for synthesis of materials with
new and novel sets of physical properties.

<p>Cavity optomechanics implements a unique platform where moving objects can be
probed by quantum fields, either laser light or microwave signals. With a pump
tone driving at a frequency above the cavity resonance, self-sustained
oscillations can be triggered at large injected powers. These limit cycle
dynamics are particularly rich, presenting hysteretic behaviours, broad comb
signals and especially large motion amplitudes. All of these features can be
exploited for both fundamental quantum research and engineering. Here we
present low temperature microwave experiments performed on a high-Q cavity
resonance capacitively coupled to the flexure of a beam resonator. We study the
limit cycle dynamics phase space as a function of pump parameters (detuning,
power). Unexpectedly, we find that in a region of this phase space the
microwave resonance is irremediably destroyed: only a dramatic power-reset can
restore the dynamics to its original state. The phenomenon can be understood as
an optical instability linked to the Kerr nonlinearity of the cavity. A theory
supporting this claim is presented, reproducing almost quantitatively the
measurement. This remarkable feature might be further optimized and represents
a new resource for quantum microwave circuits.

<p>The identification of materials with exceptional properties is an essential
objective to enable technological progress. We propose the application of
\textit{Quality-Diversity} algorithms to the field of crystal structure
prediction. The objective of these algorithms is to identify a diverse set of
high-performing solutions, which has been successful in a range of fields such
as robotics, architecture and aeronautical engineering. As these methods rely
on a high number of evaluations, we employ machine-learning surrogate models to
compute the interatomic potential and material properties that are used to
guide optimisation. Consequently, we also show the value of using neural
networks to model crystal properties and enable the identification of novel
composition--structure combinations. In this work, we specifically study the
application of the MAP-Elites algorithm to predict polymorphs of TiO$_2$. We
rediscover the known ground state, in addition to a set of other polymorphs
with distinct properties. We validate our method for C, SiO$_2$ and SiC
systems, where we show that the algorithm can uncover multiple local minima
with distinct electronic and mechanical properties.

<p>Penta-NiN2, a novel pentagonal 2D sheet with potential nanoelectronic
applications, is investigated in terms of its lattice thermal conductivity,
stability, and mechanical behavior. A deep learning interatomic potential (DLP)
is firstly generated from ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) data and then
utilized for classical molecular dynamics simulations. The DLP's accuracy is
verified, showing strong agreement with AIMD results. The dependence of thermal
conductivity on size, temperature, and tensile strain, reveals important
insights into the material's thermal properties. Additionally, the mechanical
response of penta-NiN2 under uniaxial loading is examined, yielding a Young's
modulus of approximately 368 GPa. The influence of vacancy defects on
mechanical properties is analyzed, demonstrating significant reduction in
modulus, fracture stress, and ultimate strength. This study also investigates
the influence of strain on phonon dispersion relations and phonon group
velocity in penta-NiN2, shedding light on how alterations in the atomic lattice
affect the phonon dynamics and, consequently, impact the thermal conductivity.
This investigation showcases the ability of deep learning based interatomic
potentials in studying the properties of 2D Penta-NiN2.

<p>Ferromagnetic resonance is used to reveal features of the buried electronic
band structure at interfaces between ferromagnetic metals and topological
insulators. By monitoring the evolution of magnetic damping, the application of
this method to a hybrid structure consisting of a ferromagnetic layer and a 3D
topological insulator reveals a clear fingerprint of the Dirac point and
exhibits additional features of the interfacial band structure not otherwise
observable. The underlying spin-pumping mechanism is discussed in the framework
of dissipation of angular momentum by topological surface states (TSSs). Tuning
of the Fermi level within the TSS was verified both by varying the
stoichiometry of the topological insulator layer and by electrostatic
backgating and the damping values obtained in both cases show a remarkable
agreement. The high energy resolution of this method additionally allows us to
resolve the energetic shift of the local Dirac points generated by local
variations of the electrostatic potential. Calculations based on the chiral
tunneling process naturally occurring in TSS agree well with the experimental
results.

<p>The simulation of inelastic effects in flexible slender technical devices has
become of increasing interest in the past years. Different approaches have been
considered depending on the effects relevant for the specific application.
Recently, a mixed stress strain driven computational homogenisation has been
proposed to model the dissipative nonlinear bending response of spiral strands
subjected to axial force. In this study, we propose two different approaches,
namely a rheological model and a databased greybox model, to predict the cyclic
response of these strands using only their monotonic response. In the first
approach, a system of so-called bending springs and sliders is used to model
different contributions to the bending stiffness of the strands. The data-based
approach makes use of mathematical tools called hysteresis operators. The
Prandtl-Ishlinskii operator plays a relevant role in modelling the input-output
relation in phenomena showing hysteretic behaviour and can be expressed as a
weighted superposition of elementary stop operators. Comparing the two
approaches leads to a better understanding and an explicit physical
interpretation of the parameters of a specific class of hysteresis operator
models.

<h3>High-harmonic generation in graphene under the application of a DC  electric current: From perturbative to non-perturbative regimes</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03523" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03523</a>

</p><i>Minoru Kanega, Masahiro Sato</i>
<p>We theoretically investigate high-harmonic generation (HHG) in
honeycomb-lattice graphene models when subjected to a DC electric field. By
integrating the quantum master equation with the Boltzmann equation, we develop
a numerical method to compute laser-driven dynamics in many-electron lattice
systems under DC electric current. The method enables us to treat both the
weak-laser (perturbative) and intense-laser (non-perturbative) regimes in a
unified way, accounting for the experimentally inevitable dissipation effects.
From it, we obtain the HHG spectra and analyze their dependence on laser
frequency, laser intensity, laser-field direction, and DC current strength. We
show that the dynamical and static symmetries are partially broken by a DC
current or staggered potential term, and such symmetry breakings drastically
change the shape of the HHG spectra, especially in terms of the presence or
absence of $(2n+1)$-th, $2n$-th, or $3n$-th order harmonics ($n\in \mathbb Z$).
The laser intensity, frequency, and polarization are also shown to affect the
shape of the HHG spectra. Our findings indicate that HHG spectra in conducting
electron systems can be quantitatively or qualitatively controlled by tuning
various external parameters, and DC electric current is used as such an
efficient parameter.

<h3>Data based constitutive modelling of rate independent inelastic effects  in composite cables using Preisach hysteresis operators</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03531" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03531</a>
<br>
</p><i>Davide Manfredo, Vanessa D√∂rlich, Joachim Linn, Martin Arnold</i>
<p>This contribution aims at introducing first steps to develop hysteresis
operator type inelastic constitutive laws for Cosserat rods for the simulation
of cables composed of complex interior components. Motivated by the basic
elements of Cosserat rod theory, we develop a specific approach to constitutive
modelling adapted for this application. Afterwards, we describe the
hysteretical behaviour arising from cyclic bending experiments on cables by
means of the Preisach operator. As shown in pure bending experiments, slender
structures such as electric cables behave inelastically, and open hysteresis
loops arise with noticeable difference between the first load cycle and the
following ones. The Preisach operator plays an important role in describing the
input-output relation in hysteresis behaviours, and it can be expressed as a
superposition of relay operators. Hence, a mathematical formulation of the
problem is introduced, and a first attempt is made to determine the hysteresis
behaviour that describes the relation between curvature and bending moment.
Therefore, a suitable kernel function is identified in a way that its
integration over the Preisach plane results in the bending moment of the
specimen, and a comparison between different kernel functions is performed.

<h3>Virtual walks and phase transitions in two dimensional BChS model with  extreme switches</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03556" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03556</a>
<br>
</p><i>Kathakali Biswas, Parongama Sen</i>
<p>We have studied a walk in a one-dimensional virtual space corresponding to an
extended version of the three-state BChS model of opinion formation, originally
proposed in Physica A {\bf 391}, 3257 (2012), in which the agents are located
on a two dimensional lattice. The opinions are designated by the values $\pm1$
and zero. Here we also consider switches between the extreme states $\pm 1$.
The model involves two noise parameters representing the fraction of negative
interactions $p$ and the probability of extreme switch denoted by $q$. The
study shows that the nature of the walks changes drastically as the noise
parameters exceed certain threshold values. The order-disorder phase
transitions are independently obtained using the finite size scaling method
showing that these threshold values are indeed consistent with those values of
the parameters where a phase transition exists. The criticality is found to be
Ising-like even when extreme switches are allowed. A new critical exponent
associated with the probability distribution of the displacement is also
obtained independent of the values of the critical parameters. The nature of
the walks is compared to similar virtual walks studied earlier.

<p>In a recent publication [2D Materials, 8, 045033 (2021), arXiv:2103.11403],
it was reported that the growth of a monolayer PdTe$_2$ in ultra-high vacuum
could be achieved by deposition of tellurium on a palladium (111) crystal
surface and subsequent thermal annealing. By means of low-energy electron
diffraction intensity (LEED-IV) structural analysis, we show that the obtained

fact a TePd$_2$ surface alloy. Attempts to produce a PdTe$_2$ layer in
ultra-high vacuum by increasing the Te content on the surface were not

<h3>Anisotropic power diagrams for polycrystal modelling: efficient  generation of curved grains via optimal transport</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Maciej Buze, Jean Feydy, Steven M. Roper, Karo Sedighiani, David P. Bourne</i>
<p>The microstructure of metals and foams can be effectively modelled with
anisotropic power diagrams (APDs), which provide control over the shape of
individual grains. One major obstacle to the wider adoption of APDs is the
computational cost that is associated with their generation. We propose a novel
approach to generate APDs with prescribed statistical properties, including
fine control over the size of individual grains. To this end, we rely on fast
optimal transport algorithms that stream well on Graphics Processing Units
(GPU) and handle non-uniform, anisotropic distance functions. This allows us to
find APDs that best fit experimental data in (tens of) seconds, which unlocks
their use for computational homogenisation. This is especially relevant to
machine learning methods that require the generation of large collections of
representative microstructures as training data. The paper is accompanied by a

<h3>Projector-based efficient estimation of force constants</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Atsuto Seko, Atsushi Togo</i>
<p>Estimating force constants for crystal structures is a fundamental aspect of
calculating various phonon-related properties. However, it can be a challenging
task, particularly when dealing with a large number of atoms or when third and
higher-order force constants are needed. In this study, we propose an efficient
approach that involves constructing a complete orthonormal basis set of the
force constants. We formulate this approach using projector matrices and their
eigenvectors corresponding to the requirements for the force constants. This
basis set allows us to infer the force constants from displacement-force
datasets precisely. Our efficient algorithms for the basis-set construction and
force constant estimation from a displacement-force dataset are implemented in
the symfc code. Furthermore, several applications are demonstrated in this
study, indicating that the current approach helps to obtain force constants
efficiently and precisely.

<br>
</p><i>M. Nashaat, E. Kovalenko, Yu. M. Shukrinov</i>
<p>The dynamics of magnetization and current-voltage characteristics of the
superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor $\varphi_0$ Josephson junction in the
presence of external electromagnetic radiation have been studied. Effects of
radiation magnetic component are investigated in the frameworks of one- and
two-signal models. The implementation of two types of dynamical states of
magnetization is demonstrated. These states have a phase shift of $\pi$ in the
synchronization region of magnetic precession and Josephson oscillations and
differ in the nature of their time dependence. Transitions between these states
with increasing and decreasing bias current show hysteresis, which is reflected
in the bifurcation diagram and the current-voltage characteristics. We also
provide an experimental way to test the obtained results by measuring the phase
shift in voltage temporal dependence at fixed current value for both sweeping
directions. The results obtained can find application in various fields of
superconducting spintronics and quantum computing.

<h3>Weyl points and anomalous transport effects tuned by the Fe doping in  Mn$_3$Ge Weyl semimetal</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03626" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03626</a>
<br>
</p><i>Venus Rai, Subhadip Jana, J√∂rg Per√üon, Shibabrata Nandi</i>
<p>The discovery of a significantly large anomalous Hall effect in the chiral
antiferromagnetic system - Mn$_3$Ge - indicates that the Weyl points are widely
separated in phase space and positioned near the Fermi surface. In order to
examine the effects of Fe substitution in Mn$_3$Ge on the presence and location
of the Weyl points, we synthesized (Mn$_{1-\alpha}$Fe$_{\alpha})$$_3$Ge
($\alpha=0-0.30$) compounds. The anomalous Hall effect was observed in
compounds up to $\alpha=0.22$, but only within the temperature range where the
magnetic structure remains the same as the Mn$_3$Ge. Additionally, positive
longitudinal magnetoconductance and planar Hall effect were detected within the
same temperature and doping range. These findings strongly suggest the
existence of Weyl points in (Mn$_{1-\alpha}$Fe$_{\alpha})$$_3$Ge
($\alpha=0-0.22$) compounds. Further, we observed that with an increase in Fe
doping fraction, there is a significant reduction in the magnitude of anomalous
Hall conductivity, planar Hall effect, and positive longitudinal
magnetoconductance, indicating that the Weyl points move further away from the
Fermi surface. Consequently, it can be concluded that suitable dopants in the
parent Weyl semimetals have the potential to tune the properties of Weyl points
and the resulting anomalous electrical transport effects.

<h3>Crystal, ferromagnetism, and magnetoresistance with sign reversal in a  EuAgP semiconductor</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03650" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03650</a>
<br>
</p><i>Qian Zhao, Kaitong Sun, Si Wu, Hai-Feng Li</i>
<p>We synthesized the ferromagnetic EuAgP semiconductor and conducted a
comprehensive study of its crystalline, magnetic, heat capacity, band gap, and
magnetoresistance properties. Our investigation utilized a combination of X-ray
diffraction, optical, and PPMS DynaCool measurements. EuAgP adopts a hexagonal
structure with the $P6_3/mmc$ space group. As the temperature decreases, it
undergoes a magnetic phase transition from high-temperature paramagnetism to
low-temperature ferromagnetism. We determined the ferromagnetic transition
temperature to be $T_{\textrm{C}} =$ 16.45(1) K by fitting the measured
magnetic susceptibility using a Curie-Weiss law. Heat capacity analysis of
EuAgP considered contributions from electrons, phonons, and magnons, revealing
$\eta$ = 0.03 J/mol/$\textrm{K}^\textrm{2}$, indicative of semiconducting
behavior. Additionally, we calculated a band gap of $\sim$ 1.324(4) eV based on
absorption spectrum measurements. The resistivity versus temperature of EuAgP
measured in the absence of an applied magnetic field shows a pronounced peak
around $T_{\textrm{C}}$, which diminishes rapidly with increasing applied
magnetic fields, ranging from 1 to 14 T. An intriguing phenomenon emerges in
the form of a distinct magnetoresistance transition, shifting from positive
(e.g., 1.95\% at 300 K and 14 T) to negative (e.g., -30.73\% at 14.25 K and 14
T) as the temperature decreases. This behavior could be attributed to
spin-disordered scattering.

<h3>Revisiting phonon thermal transport in two-dimensional gallium nitride:  higher-order phonon-phonon and phonon-electron scattering</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03673" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03673</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jianshi Sun, Xiangjun Liu, Yucheng Xiong, Yuhang Yao, Xiaolong Yang, Cheng Shao, Shouhang Li</i>
<p>Two-dimensional gallium nitride (2D-GaN) has great potential in power
electronics and optoelectronics. Heat dissipation is a critical issue for these
applications of 2D-GaN. Previous studies showed that higher-order phonon-phonon
scattering has extremely strong effects on the lattice thermal conductivity of
2D-GaN, which exhibits noticeable discrepancies with lattice thermal
conductivity calculated from molecular dynamics. In this work, it is found that
the fourth-order interatomic force constants (4th-IFCs) of 2D-GaN are quite
sensitive to atomic displacement in the finite different method. The effects of
the four-phonon scattering can be severely overestimated with non-convergent
4th-IFCs. The lattice thermal conductivity from three-phonon scattering is
reduced by 65.6% due to four-phonon scattering. The reflection symmetry allows
significantly more four-phonon processes than three-phonon processes. It was
previously thought the electron-phonon interactions have significant effects on
the lattice thermal conductivity of two-dimensional materials. However, the
effects of phonon-electron interactions on the lattice thermal conductivity of
both n-type and p-type 2D-GaN at high charge carrier concentrations can be
neglected due to the few phonon-electron scattering channels and the relatively
strong four-phonon scattering.

<p>Subwavelength arrays of quantum emitters have emerged as an interesting
platform displaying prominent collective effects. Here we study such arrays
under coherent driving, realizing an open quantum many-body problem in a
strongly non-linear regime. We show that the combination of dipolar
interactions and regular geometry have a dramatic effect on the spectrum of
emitted light: the famous Mollow triplet characterizing the emission of a
single atom develops a structured broadening with flat sidebands, with a
bandwidth determined by the dipolar interactions. This emission spectrum
characterizes atomic arrays and distinguishes them from disordered ensembles as
well as non-interacting emitters. Our predictions are based on a novel
dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) approach to the problem, paving the way for
further studies of these systems.

<h3>SU($\pmb N$) Kondo-Heisenberg chain: Phase diagram, Ising criticality,  and the coexistence of heavy quasiparticles and valence bond solid order</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03694" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03694</a>
<br>
</p><i>Marcin Raczkowski, Fakher F. Assaad</i>
<p>We map out the ground state phase diagram of a one-dimensional SU($N$)
Kondo-Heisenberg lattice model at half filling and in the fully antisymmetric
self-adjoint representation as a function of $\tfrac {1}{N}$ and Kondo coupling
$J_k/t$. On the basis of auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations
with even $N$ up to 8, we show that the enlarged SU($N\ge 4$) symmetry realizes
a quantum phase transition separating a valence bond solid (VBS) phase
occupying a weak coupling part of the phase diagram and the Kondo insulator
(KI) state dominating in the strong $J_k/t$ limit. Along the phase boundary we
always observe critical exponents that belong to a two-dimensional classical
Ising universality class. We next trace the evolution of the composite fermion
and spin spectral functions across the phase boundary and conclude that VBS
order triggers a bond order wave state of conduction electrons, both coexisting
with Kondo screening. Upon further reducing $J_k/t$ we observe that composite
quasiparticles lose their spectral weight indicating that VBS order gradually
liberates localized $f$ spins from forming Kondo singlets with conduction
electron spins. We contrast the QMC results with a static large-$N$
approximation and show that in the limit of infinite degeneracy $N\to\infty$
the order-disorder transition becomes of first order and is accompanied by a
full decoupling of conduction electrons and localized $f$ spins. We complete
our analysis by considering the limit of a vanishing Heisenberg coupling
$J_h=0$ and provide evidence that the enlarged SU($N$) symmetry and low
dimensionality of the RKKY exchange interaction are not sufficient to induce
VBS order in the conventional SU($N$) Kondo chain which hosts solely a KI
phase.

<p>By constructing an exactly solvable spin model, we investigate the critical
behaviors of transverse field Ising chains interpolated with cluster
interactions, which exhibit various types of topologically distinct Ising
critical points. Using fidelity susceptibility as an indicator, we establish
the global phase diagram, including ferromagnetic, trivial paramagnetic, and
symmetry-protected topological phases. Different types of critical points exist
between these phases, encompassing both topologically trivial and non-trivial
Ising critical points, as well as Gaussian critical points. Importantly, we
demonstrate the existence of a Lifshitz transition between these topologically
distinct Ising critical points, with central charge and critical exponents
determined through finite-size scaling. This work serves as a valuable
reference for further research on phase transitions within the gapless quantum
phase of matter.

<p>The macroscopic electromagnetic properties of type II superconductors are
primarily influenced by the behavior of microscopic superconducting flux

elegant and powerful tool for describing and examining both the statics and

replicating and elucidating numerous experimental results over the past
decades.This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the progress in TDGL
simulations, focusing on three key aspects of superconductor applications. The
initial section delves into vortex rectification in superconductors described
within the TDGL framework. We specifically highlight the superconducting diode
effect achieved through asymmetric pinning landscapes and the reversible
manipulation of vortex ratchets with dynamic pinning landscapes. The subsequent
section reviews the achievements of TDGL simulations concerning the critical
current density of superconductors, emphasizing the optimization of pinning
sites, particularly vortex pinning and dynamics in polycrystalline Nb$_3$Sn
with grain boundaries. The third part concentrates on numerical modeling of
vortex penetration and dynamics in superconducting radio frequency (SRF)
cavities, including a discussion of superconductor insulator superconductor
multilayer structures. In the last section, we present key findings, insights,
and perspectives derived from the discussed simulations.

<p>Layered magnets are stand-out materials because of their range of functional
properties that can be controlled by external stimuli. Regretfully, the class
of such compounds is rather narrow, prompting the search for new members.
Graphitization - stabilization of layered graphitic structures in the 2D limit
- is being discussed for cubic materials. We suggest the phenomenon to extend
beyond cubic structures; it can be employed as a viable route to a variety of
layered materials. Here, the idea of graphitization is put into practice to
produce a new layered magnet, GdAlSi. The honeycomb material, based on
graphene-like layers AlSi, is studied both experimentally and theoretically.
Epitaxial films of GdAlSi are synthesized on silicon; the critical thickness
for the stability of the layered polymorph is around 20 monolayers. Notably,
the layered polymorph of GdAlSi demonstrates ferromagnetism stemming from the
open 4f-shells of Gd, in contrast to the non-layered, tetragonal polymorph. The
ferromagnetism is further supported by electron transport measurements
revealing negative magnetoresistance and the anomalous Hall effect. The results
show that graphitization can be a powerful tool in the design of functional
layered materials.

<p>The interplay of lattice, electronic, and spin degrees of freedom at
epitaxial complex oxide interfaces provides a route to tune their magnetic
ground states. Unraveling the competing contributions is critical for tuning
their functional properties. We investigate the relationship between magnetic
ordering and magnetic anisotropy and the lattice symmetry, oxygen content, and
film thickness in compressively strained LaMnO$_3$/LaCrO$_3$ superlattices.
Mn-O-Cr antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions across the heterointerface
resulting in a net ferrimagnetic magnetic structure. Bulk magnetometry
measurements reveal isotropic in-plane magnetism for as-grown oxygen-deficient
thinner thin samples due to equal fractions of orthorhombic a+a-c-, and a-a+c-
twin domains. As the superlattice thickness is increased, in-plane magnetic
anisotropy emerges as the fraction of the a+a-c- domain increases. On annealing
in oxygen, the suppression of oxygen vacancies results in a contraction of the
lattice volume, and an orthorhombic to rhombohedral transition leads to
isotropic magnetism independent of the film thickness. The complex interactions
are investigated using high-resolution synchrotron diffraction and X-ray
absorption spectroscopy. These results highlight the role of the evolution of
structural domains with film thickness, interfacial spin interactions, and
oxygen-vacancy-induced structural phase transitions in tuning the magnetic
properties of complex oxide heterostructures.

</p><i>Sunit Das, Suvankar Chakraverty, Amit Agarwal</i>
<p>Quantum oscillations offer a powerful probe for the geometry and topology of
the Fermi surface in metals. Onsager's semiclassical quantization relation
governs these periodic oscillations in 1/B, leading to a linear Landau fan
diagram. However, higher-order magnetic susceptibility-induced corrections give
rise to a generalized Onsager's relation, manifesting in experiments as a
nonlinear Landau fan diagram and aperiodic quantum oscillations. Here, we
explore the generalized Onsager's relation to three-dimensional (3D) systems to
capture the B-induced corrections in the free energy and the Fermi surface. We
unravel the manifestation of these corrections in the nonlinear Landau fan
diagrams and aperiodic quantum oscillations by deriving the B-dependent
oscillation frequency and the generalized Lifshitz-Kosevich equation,
respectively. Our theory explains the necessary conditions to observe these
fascinating effects and predicts the magnetic field dependence of the cyclotron
mass. As a concrete example, we elucidate these effects in a 3D spin-orbit
coupled system and extract zero-field magnetic response functions from
analytically obtained Landau levels. Our comprehensive study deepens and
advances our understanding of aperiodic quantum oscillations.

<p>A two dimensional system with extra degrees of freedom, such as spin and
valley, is of great interest in the study of quantum phase transitions. The
critical condition when a transition between different multicomponent
fractional quantum Hall states appears is one of the very few junctions for
many body problems between theoretical calculations and experiments. In this
work, we present that uniaxial strain induces pseudospin transitions of
composite fermions in a two-dimensional hole gas. Determined from transport
behavior, strain along <111> effectively changes pseudospin energy levels. We
deduce that diagonal strain dominates these variations. Our experiment provides
a wedge for manipulating two dimensional interacting systems mechanically.

spectrum in planar Josephson junctions (JJs) defined in Ge high mobility
two-dimensional hole gases contacted by superconducting PtSiGe. The JJs and
readout circuitry are located on separate chips and inductively coupled via
flip-chip bonding. For a device with $350~\mathrm{nm}$ junction length,
spectroscopic signatures were consistent with the short-junction limit, with an
induced superconducting gap $\Delta^{*}\approx48~\mathrm{\mu eV}$ and
transmission $\tau \approx 0.94$. The interaction between the
highest-transmission ABS and the resonator was well described by a
Jaynes-Cummings model with a vacuum Rabi splitting of approximately
$6~\mathrm{MHz}$. A device with junction length of $1~\mu m$ showed an ABS
spectrum consistent with a long junction model. Time-resolved monitoring of the
readout resonator in the dispersive regime revealed gate-voltage tunable
junction parity fluctuations on the timescale of seconds. Our work indicates a

<p>Current-biased Josephson junctions can act as detectors of electromagnetic
radiation. At optimal conditions, their sensitivity is limited by fluctuations
causing stochastic switching from the superconducting to the resistive state.
This work provides a quantitative description of a stochastic switching current
detector, based on an underdamped Josephson junction. It is shown that
activation of a Josephson plasma resonance can greatly enhance the detector
responsivity in proportion to the quality factor of the junction. The ways of
tuning the detector for achieving optimal operation are discussed. For
realistic parameters of Nb/AlOx/Nb tunnel junctions, the sensitivity and
noise-equivalent power can reach values of $S\simeq 2\times10^{13}$ (V/W) and
$NEP\simeq 5\times10^{-24}$ (WHz$^{-1/2}$), respectively. These outstanding
characteristics facilitate both bolometric and single-photon detection in
microwave and terahertz ranges.

<p>Complex materials encompassing different phases of matter can display new
photoinduced metastable states differing from those attainable under
equilibrium conditions. These states can be realized when energy is injected in
the material following a non-equilibrium pathway, unbalancing the unperturbed
energy landscape of the material. Guided by the fact that photoemission
experiments allow for detailed insights in the electronic band structure of
ordered systems, here we study bulk 1$T$-VSe$_2$ in its metallic and
charge-density-wave phase by time- and angle-resolved photoelectron
spectroscopy. After near-infrared optical excitation, the system shows a net
increase of the density of states in the energy range of the valence bands, in
the vicinity of the Fermi level, lasting for several picoseconds. We discuss
possible origins as band shifts or correlation effects on the basis of a band
structure analysis. Our results uncover the possibility of altering the
electronic band structure of bulk 1$T$-VSe$_2$ for low excitation fluences,
contributing to the understanding of light-induced electronic states.

<h3>Disorder-to-order transition of long fibers contained in evaporating  sessile drops</h3>

<p>A liquid drop containing a long fiber is a complex system whose configuration
is determined by an interplay of elastic stresses in the fiber and capillary
forces due to the liquid. We study the morphological evolution of fibers that
are much longer than the drop diameter in evaporating sessile drops. After
insertion, the fibers are either found in an ordered or disordered state, with
increasing disorder for increasing fiber length. Upon evaporation, the order
increases, in such a way that the final configuration deposited on the solid
surface is either a circle, an ellipse, or 8-shaped. The morphology of the
deposit depends on the fiber length and the elastocapillary length, both
non-dimensionalized with the characteristic drop size, which we classify in a
morphology regime map. The disorder-to-order transition allows depositing
ordered fiber structures on solid surfaces even in cases of a strongly
disordered state after fiber insertion. Combined with technologies such as
inkjet printing, this process could open new avenues to decorate surfaces with
filamental structures whose morphology can be controlled by varying the fiber
length.

<p>Kagome metals offer a unique platform for investigating robust
electron-correlation effects because of their lattice geometry, flat bands and
multi-orbital nature. In the cases with active flat bands, recent theoretical
studies have pointed to a rich phase diagram that contains not only electronic
orders but also quantum criticality. $\rm CsCr_3Sb_5$ has emerged as a strong
candidate for exploring such new physics. Here, using effective tight-binding
models obtained from ab initio calculations, we study the effects of electronic
correlations and symmetries on the electronic structure of $\rm CsCr_3 Sb_5$.
The effective tight-binding model and Fermi surface comprise multiple Cr-$d$
orbitals and Sb-$p$ orbitals. The introduction of Hubbard-Kanamori interactions
leads to orbital-selective band renormalization dominated by the $d_{xz}$ band,
concurrently producing emergent flat bands very close to the Fermi level. Our
analysis sets the stage for further investigations into the electronic
properties of $\rm CsCr_3Sb_5$, including electronic orders, quantum
criticality and unconventional superconductivity, which promise to shed much
new light into the electronic materials with frustrated lattices and bring
about new connections with the correlation physics of a variety of strongly
correlated systems.

<h3>Effect of Uncorrelated On-site Scalar Potential, and Mass Disorder on  Transport of Two-Dimensional Dirac Fermions</h3>

<p>We investigate the transport properties of massive Dirac fermions subjected
to uncorrelated scalar potential disorder, and mass disorder. Using a finite
difference method, the conductance is calculated for a wide variety of
combinations of these two disorder strengths. By calculating the scaling of
conductivity with system size we find that, depending on the combination, the
system can have an insulating, scale invariant, and metallic behavior. We
identify the critical values of these disorder strengths where the phase
transitions occur. We study both the zero and nonzero average mass cases to
examine the effect of scalar potential disorder on band gap. Our results
suggest a suppression of the band gap by the scalar potential disorder.

<h3>Collision Cascade-Driven Evolution of Vacancy Defects in Ni-Based  Concentrated Solid-Solution Alloys</h3>

<p>Concentrated solid--solution alloys (CSAs) in single--phase form have
recently garnered considerable attention owing to their potential for
exceptional irradiation resistance. This computational study delves into the
intricate interplay of alloying elements on the generation, recombination, and
evolution of irradiation-induced defects. Molecular dynamics simulations were
conducted for collision cascades at room temperature, spanning a range of
primary knock-on atom energies from 1 to 10 keV. The investigation encompasses
a series of model crystals, progressing from pure Ni to binary CSAs such as
NiFe$_{20}$, NiFe, NiCr$_{20}$, and culminating in the more intricate
NiFeCr$_{20}$ CSA. We observe that materials rich in chromium actively
facilitate dislocation emissions and induce the nucleation of stacking fault
tetrahedra in the proximity of nanovoids, owing to Shockley partial
interactions. This result is validated by molecular static simulations, which
calculate the surface, vacancy, and defect formation energies. Among various
shapes considered, the spherical void proves to be the most stable, followed by
the truncated octahedron and octahedron shapes. On the other hand, the
tetrahedron cubic shape is identified as the most unstable, and stacking fault
tetrahedra exhibit the highest formation energy. Notably, among the materials
studied, NiCr$_{20}$ and NiFeCr$_{20}$ CSAs stood out as the sole alloys
capable of manifesting this mechanism, mainly observed at high impact energies.

<h3>Permutation Symmetry Restoration in Disordered Materials</h3>

<p>A disordered solid, such as an athermal jammed packing of soft spheres exists
in a rugged potential-energy landscape in which there are a myriad of stable
configurations that defy easy enumeration and characterization. Nevertheless,
in three-dimensional monodisperse particle packings, we find an astonishing
regularity in the distribution of basin volumes, $V_{Nd}$, as measured by their
frequency of occurrence in a random sampling algorithm. Ordering the basins
according to their size, from the largest at $n=1$, to the smallest, we find
approximately that $V_{Nd} \propto n^{-1}$. This statistical regularity
persists up to the largest systems for which we can collect sufficient data. In
monodisperse packings there is "permutation symmetry" since identical particles
can always be interchanged without affecting the system or its properties.
Introducing any polydispersity breaks this symmetry and leads to a
proliferation of distinct configurations. We present an algorithm that
partially restores permutation symmetry to such polydisperse packings.

<h3>Pressure-enhanced $f$-electron orbital weighting in UTe2 mapped by  quantum interferometry</h3>

<p>The phase landscape of UTe$_2$ features a remarkable diversity of
superconducting phases under applied pressure and magnetic field. Recent
quantum oscillation studies at ambient pressure have revealed the quasi-2D
Fermi surface of this material. However, the pressure-dependence of the Fermi
surface remains an open question. Here we track the evolution of the UTe$_2$
Fermi surface as a function of pressure up to 19.5 kbar by measuring quantum
interference oscillations. We find that in sufficient magnetic field to
suppress both superconductivity at low pressures and incommensurate
antiferromagnetism at higher pressures, the quasi-2D Fermi surface found at
ambient pressure smoothly connects to that at 19.5 kbar, with no signs of a
reconstruction over this pressure interval. The warping of the cylindrical
Fermi sheets continuously increases with pressure, which is consistent with
increased $f$-orbital contribution at the Fermi level, up to and beyond the
critical pressure at which superconductivity is truncated. These findings
highlight the value of high pressure quantum interference measurements as a new
probe of the electronic structure in heavy fermion materials.

<h3>Decoupling the electronic gap from the spin Chern number in disordered  higher-order topological insulators</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03957" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03957</a>

</p><i>Alexander C. Tyner, Cormac Grindall, J. H. Pixley</i>
<p>In two-dimensional topological insulators, a disorder induced topological
phase transition is typically identified with an Anderson localization
transition at the Fermi energy. However, in higher-order, spin-resolved
topological insulators it is the spectral gap of the spin-spectrum, in addition
to the bulk mobility gap, which protects the non-trivial topology of the ground
state. In this work, we show that these two gaps, the bulk electronic and spin
gap, evolve distinctly upon introduction of disorder. This decoupling leads to
a unique situation in which an Anderson localization transition occurs below
the Fermi energy at the topological transition. Furthermore, in the clean limit
the bulk-boundary correspondence of such higher-order insulators is dictated by
crystalline protected topology, coexisting with the spin-resolved topology. By
removing the crystalline symmetry, disorder allows for isolated study of the
bulk-boundary correspondence of spin-resolved topology for which we demonstrate
the absence of protected edge and corner modes in the Hamiltonian and yet the
edge modes in the eigenstates of the projected spin operator survive. Our work
shows that a non-zero spin-Chern number, in the absence of a non-trivial
$\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ index, does not dictate the existence of protected edge modes,
resolving a fundamental question posed in 2009.
