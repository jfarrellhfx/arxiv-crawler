<h3>Quarter Magnetization Plateau of Triplet Spin Dimers in the Shastry-Sutherland Lattice</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02795v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02795v1</a>
<br>
<i>Madalynn Marshall, Brianna R. Billingsley, Xiaojian Bai, Tai Kong, Huibo Cao</i>
<br>
<br>
The Shastry-Sutherland lattice, 2-dimensional orthogonal arrangement of the
spin dimers, has been realized in the magnetic semiconductor, BaNd2ZnS5. A
signature feature of Shastry-Sutherland lattice materials is fractional
magnetization plateaus, which often indicate novel quantum phases. Here we
report the quarter magnetization plateau from a single crystal of BaNd2ZnS5 by
neutron diffraction. A 2-Q antiferromagnetic order of the triplet spin dimers
was determined at zero-field, which can be understood by the local Ising
magnetic anisotropy of Nd spins that was revealed by local magnetic
susceptibility method through polarized neutron diffraction. The quantized
magnetization plateau was measured under field along (1-10). The two magnetic
sublattices connected to each propagation vector of 2-Q respond to the field
differently, the stripe phase with q1 = (0.5, 0.5, 0) disappears at ~1.7 T
entering the quarter magnetization plateau. The other stripe phase with q2=
(-0.5, 0.5, 0) remains nearly intact up to 6 T. Furthermore, microscopic
magnetic model was used to provide insight into the formation of quarter
magnetization plateau, that is unexpected in gapless dimer triplet system,
contrast to the well-known dimer-singlet Shastry-Sutherland lattice.

The performance of superconducting qubits is degraded by a poorly
characterized set of energy sources breaking the Cooper pairs responsible for
superconductivity, creating a condition often called "quasiparticle poisoning."
Recently, a superconductor with one of the lowest average quasiparticle
densities ever measured exhibited quasiparticles primarily produced in bursts
which decreased in rate with time after cooldown. Similarly, several cryogenic
calorimeters used to search for dark matter have also observed an unknown
source of low-energy phonon bursts that decrease in rate with time after
cooldown. Here, we show that a silicon crystal glued to its holder exhibits a
rate of low-energy phonon events that is more than two orders of magnitude
larger than in a functionally identical crystal suspended from its holder in a
low-stress state. The excess phonon event rate in the glued crystal decreases
with time since cooldown, consistent with a source of phonon bursts which
contributes to quasiparticle poisoning in quantum circuits and the low-energy
events observed in cryogenic calorimeters. We argue that relaxation of
thermally induced stress between the glue and crystal is the source of these
events, and conclude that stress relaxation contributes to quasiparticle
poisoning in superconducting qubits and the athermal phonon background in a
broad class of rare-event searches.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02784v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02784v1</a>

<br>
<br>
The increasing resistance of Cu interconnects for decreasing dimensions is a
major challenge in continued downscaling of integrated circuits beyond the 7-nm
technology node as it leads to unacceptable signal delays and power consumption
in computing. The resistivity of Cu increases due to electron scattering at
surfaces and grain boundaries of the interconnects at the nanoscale.
Topological semimetals, owing to their topologically protected surface states
and suppressed electron backscattering, are promising material candidates to
potentially replace current Cu interconnects as low-resistance interconnects.
Here, we report the attractive resistivity scaling of topological metal MoP
nanowires and show that the resistivity values are comparable to those of Cu
interconnects below 500 nm$^2$ cross-section areas. More importantly, we
demonstrate that the dimensional scaling of MoP nanowires, in terms of line
resistance versus total cross-sectional area, is superior to those of effective
Cu and barrier-less Ru interconnects, suggesting MoP is an attractive solution
to the current scaling challenge of Cu interconnects.

<i>Shifeng Zhu, Baruch Feldman, Scott Dunham</i>
<br>
<br>
We extend the highly-parallelizable open-source electronic transport code
TRANSEC to perform real-space atomic-scale electronic transport calculations
with periodic boundary conditions in the lateral dimensions. We demonstrate the
use of TRANSEC in periodic Cu and Rh bulk structures and in large periodic Rh
point contacts, in preparation to perform calculations of reflection
probability across Rh grain boundaries.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02780v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02780v1</a>
<br>
<i>Elisabeth Lemaitre, Igor M. Sokolov, Ralf Metzler, Aleksei V. Chechkin</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the effect of randomly distributed diffusivities and speeds in two
models for active particle dynamics with active and passive fluctuations. We
demonstrate how non-Gaussian displacement distributions emerge in these models
in the long time limit, including Cauchy-type and exponential (Laplace) shapes.
Notably the resulting shapes of the displacement distributions with distributed
diffusivities for the active models considered here are in striking contrast to
passive diffusion models. For the active motion models our discussion points
out the differences between active- and passive-noise. Specifically, we
demonstrate that the case with active-noise is in nice agreement with measured
data for the displacement distribution of social amoeba.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02775v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02775v1</a>
<br>
<i>Soumi Ghosh, Sparsh Gupta, Manas Kulkarni</i>
<br>
<br>
Non-hermitian systems have gained a lot of interest in recent years. However,
notions of chaos and localization in such systems have not reached the same
level of maturity as in the Hermitian systems. Here, we consider non-hermitian
interacting disordered Hamiltonians and attempt to analyze their chaotic
behavior or lack of it through the lens of the recently introduced
non-hermitian analog of the spectral form factor and the complex spacing ratio.
We consider three widely relevant non-hermitian models which are unique in
their ways and serve as excellent platforms for such investigations. Two of the
models considered are short-ranged and have different symmetries. The third
model is long-ranged, whose hermitian counterpart has itself become a subject
of growing interest. All these models exhibit a deep connection with the
non-hermitian Random Matrix Theory of corresponding symmetry classes at
relatively weak disorder. At relatively strong disorder, the models show the
absence of complex eigenvalue correlation, thereby, corresponding to Poisson
statistics. Our thorough analysis is expected to play a crucial role in
understanding disordered open quantum systems in general.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02757v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02757v1</a>
<br>
<i>Chi-Ming Chang, Jin Chen, Ken Kikuchi, Fengjun Xu</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider topological defect lines (TDLs) in two-dimensional fermionic
conformal field theories (CFTs). Besides inheriting all the properties of TDLs
in bosonic CFTs, TDLs in fermionic CFTs could host fermionic defect operators
at their endpoints and junctions. Furthermore, there is a new type of TDLs,
called q-type TDLs, that have no analog in bosonic CFTs. Their distinguishing
feature is an extra one-dimensional Majorana fermion living on the worldline of
the TDLs. The properties of TDLs in fermionic CFTs are captured in the
mathematical language of the super fusion category. We propose a classification
of the rank-2 super fusion categories and explicitly construct all the
nontrivial ones. We derive the corresponding spin selection rules that
constrain the spectrum of the defect operators. Finally, we discuss a
constraint on the renormalization group flow that preserves a q-type TDL.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02749v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02749v1</a>
<br>
<i>kos Nagy, Steven Rayan</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by recent theoretical and experimental developments in the physics
of hyperbolic crystals, we study the noncommutative Bloch transform of Fuchsian
groups that we call the hyperbolic Bloch transform.
  First, we prove that the hyperbolic Bloch transform is injective and
"asymptotically unitary" already in the simplest case, that is when the Hilbert
space is the regular representation of the Fuchsian group, $\Gamma$. Second,
when $\Gamma \subset \mathrm{PSU} (1, 1)$ acts isometrically on the hyperbolic
plane, $\mathbb{H}$, and the Hilbert space is $L^2 \left( \mathbb{H} \right)$,
then we define a modified, geometric Bloch transform, that sends wave functions
to sections of stable, flat bundles over $\Sigma = \mathbb{H} / \Gamma$ and
transforms the hyperbolic Laplacian into the covariant Laplacian.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02739v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02739v1</a>
<br>
<i>Giacomo Mazza, Marco Schir</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the dissipative dynamics of a fermionic superfluid in presence of
two-body losses. We use a variational approach for the Lindblad dynamics and
obtain dynamical equations for Anderson's pseudo-spins where dissipation enters
as a complex pairing interaction as well as effective, density-dependent,
single particle losses which break the conservation of the pseudo-spin norm. We
show that this latter has key consequences on the dynamical behavior of the
system. In the case of a sudden switching of the two-body losses we show that
the superfluid order parameter decays much faster than then particle density at
short times and eventually slows-down, setting into a power-law decay at longer
time scales driven by the depletion of the system. We then consider a quench of
pairing interaction, leading to coherent oscillations in the unitary case,
followed by the switching of the dissipation. We show that losses wash away the
dynamical BCS synchronization by introducing not only damping but also a
renormalization of the frequency of coherent oscillations, which depends
strongly from the rate of two-body losses.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02731v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02731v1</a>
<br>
<i>Michele Grossi, Oriel Kiss, Francesco De Luca, Carlo Zollo, Ian Gremese, Antonio Mandarino</i>
<br>
<br>
The emergence of a collective behavior in a many-body system is responsible
of the quantum criticality separating different phases of matter. Interacting
spin systems in a magnetic field offer a tantalizing opportunity to test
different approaches to study quantum phase transitions. In this work, we
exploit the new resources offered by quantum algorithms to detect the quantum
critical behaviour of fully connected spin$-1/2$ models. We define a suitable
Hamiltonian depending on an internal anisotropy parameter $\gamma,$ that allows
us to examine three paradigmatic examples of spin models, whose lattice is a
fully connected graph. We propose a method based on variational algorithms run
on superconducting transmon qubits to detect the critical behavior for systems
of finite size. We evaluate the energy gap between the first excited state and
the ground state, the magnetization along the easy-axis of the system, and the
spin-spin correlations. We finally report a discussion about the feasibility of
scaling such approach on a real quantum device for a system having a dimension
such that classical simulations start requiring significant resources.

</body><h3>Anisotropic Magnetodielectric Coupling in Layered Antiferromagnetic FePS$_3$</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02729v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02729v1</a>
<br>
<i>Anudeepa Ghosh, Magdalena Birowska, Pradeepta Kumar Ghose, Miosz Rybak, Sujan Maity, Somsubhra Ghosh, Bikash Das, Satyabrata Bera, Suresh Bhardwaj, Shibabrata Nandi, Subhadeep Datta</i>
<br>
<br>
We report anisotropic magnetodielectric (MD) coupling in layered van der
Waals (vdW) antiferromagnetic (AFM) FePS$_3$ (N\'eel temperature
$T_{\mathrm{N}}$ $\sim$ 120K) with perpendicular anisotropy. Above
$T_{\mathrm{N}}$, while dielectric response function along $c$-axis shows
frequency dependent relaxations, in-plane data is frequency independent and
reveals a deviation from phonon-anharmonicity in the ordered state, thereby
implying a connection to spin-phonon coupling known to be indicative of onset
of magnetic ordering. Significant positive out-of-plane magnetocapacitance
below $T_{\mathrm{N}}$, in contrast to a negative in-plane one, can be
attributed to the anisotropic spin-texture of FePS$_3$. At low temperature
(below 40 K), atypical anomaly in the dielectric constant is corroborated with
temperature dependent DC and AC susceptibility. This has been explained in
terms of the coexistence of different AFM orders, AFM-zigzag (AFM-z) and
AFM-N\'eel (AFM-N), as confirmed by $ab-initio$ calculations. Controlling
relative strength of magnetodielectric coupling with magnetic anisotropy opens
up a strategy for tailoring the magnetic ground state with potential
application to spintronic technologies.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02620v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02620v1</a>
<br>
<i>Jyong-Hao Chen, Vadim Cheianov</i>
<br>
<br>
We study why in quantum many-body systems the adiabatic fidelity and the
overlap between the initial state and instantaneous ground states have nearly
the same values in many cases. We elaborate on how the problem may be explained
by an interplay between the two intrinsic limits of many-body systems: the
limit of small values of evolution parameter and the limit of large system
size. In the former case, conventional perturbation theory provides a natural
explanation. In the latter case, a crucial observation is that pairs of vectors
lying in the complementary Hilbert space of the initial state are almost
orthogonal. Our general findings are illustrated with a driven Rice-Mele model,
a paradigmatic model of driven many-body systems.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02619v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02619v1</a>
<br>
<i>Nicolas Rougerie</i>
<br>
<br>
The fractional quantum Hall effect in 2D electron gases submitted to large
magnetic fields remains one of the most striking phenomena in condensed matter
physics. Historically, the first observed signature is a Hall resistance
quantized to the value (2m+1) when the filling factor (electron density divided
by magnetic flux quantum density) of a 2D electron gas is in the vicinity of an
inverse odd integer 1/(2m +1). This was one of the first observation of
fractional quantum numbers. A large part of our basic theoretical understanding
of this effect (and descendants) originates from Laughlin's theory of 1983,
reviewed here from a mathematical physics perspective. We explain in which
sense Laughlin's proposed ground and excited states for the system are
rigid/incompressible liquids, and why this is crucial for the explanation of
the effect.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02605v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02605v1</a>
<br>
<i>Masataka Matsumoto</i>
<br>
<br>
We study critical phenomena at a tricritical point associated with a chiral
phase transition which emerges in the D3/D7 model in the presence of a finite
baryon number density and an external magnetic field. We numerically determine
critical exponents related to the thermodynamic quantities and correlation
functions. We find that the values of the critical exponents agree with the
mean-field values. The scaling relations between the critical exponents are
satisfied, implying that the scaling hypothesis for the free energy and the
correlation functions hold. Our results indicate that the critical phenomena at
the tricritical point in the D3/D7 model are well described in the Landau
theory.

High entropy materials (HEMs) are of great interest for their mechanical,
chemical and electronic properties. In this paper we analyse (TaNbHfTiZr)C, a
carbide type of HEM, both in crystalline and amorphous phases, using density
functional theory (DFT). We find that the relaxed lattice volume of the
amorphous phase is larger, while its bulk modulus is lower, than that of its
crystalline counterpart. Both phases are metallic with all the transition
metals contributing similarly to the density of states (DOS) close to the Fermi
level, with Ti and Nb giving the proportionally largest contribution of states.
We confirm that despite its great structural complexity, 2x2x2 supercells are
large enough for reliable simulation of the presented mechanical and electronic
properties by DFT.

Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscopes are widely used, e.g. in
modern automotive and consumer applications, and require signal stability and
accuracy in rather harsh environmental conditions. In many use cases, device
reliability must be guaranteed under large external loads at high frequencies.
The sensitivity of the sensor to such external loads depends strongly on the
damping, or rather quality factor, of the high frequency mechanical modes of
the structure. In this paper, we investigate the influence of thermoelastic
damping on several high frequency modes by comparing finite element simulations
with measurements of the quality factor in an application-relevant temperature
range. We measure the quality factors over different temperatures in vacuum, to
extract the relevant thermoelastic material parameters of the polycrystalline
MEMS device. Our simulation results show a good agreement with the measured
quantities, therefore proving the applicability of our method for predictive
purposes in the MEMS design process. Overall, we are able to uniquely identify
the thermoelastic effects and show their significance for the damping of the
high frequency modes of an industrial MEMS gyroscope. Our approach is generic
and therefore easily applicable to any mechanical structure with many possible
applications in nano- and micromechanical systems.

The Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction mediates collinear
magnetic interactions via the conduction electrons of a non-magnetic spacer,
resulting in a ferro- or antiferromagnetic magnetization in magnetic
multilayers. The resulting spin-polarized charge transport effects have found
numerous applications. Recently it has been discovered that heavy non-magnetic
spacers are able to mediate an indirect magnetic coupling that is non-collinear
and chiral. This Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-enhanced RKKY (DME-RKKY) interaction
causes the emergence of a variety of interesting magnetic structures, such as
skyrmions and spin spirals. Applications using these magnetic quasi-particles
require a thorough understanding and fine-tuning of the balance between the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and other magnetic interactions, e.g., the
exchange interaction and magnetic anisotropy contributions. Here, we show by
spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy that the spin structure of
manganese oxide chains on Ir(001) can reproducibly be switched from chiral to
collinear antiferromagnetic interchain interactions by increasing the oxidation
state of MnO$_2$ while the reverse process can be induced by thermal reduction.
The underlying structural change is revealed by low-energy electron diffraction
intensity data (LEED-IV) analysis. Density functional theory calculations
suggest that the magnetic transition may be caused by a significant increase of
the Heisenberg exchange upon oxidation.

In this paper, we propose a compact integrated hybrid plasmonic-photonic
device for optical reading of nanoscale magnetic bits with perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy in a magnetic racetrack on top of a photonic waveguide on
the indium phosphide membrane on silicon platform. The hybrid device is
constructed by coupling a doublet of V-shaped gold plasmonic nanoantennas on
top of the indium phosphide waveguide. By taking advantage of the localized
surface plasmons, our hybrid device can enable detection of the magnetization
state in magnetic bits beyond the diffraction limit of light and enhance the
polar magneto-optical Kerr effect (PMOKE). We further illustrate how combining
the hybrid device with a plasmonic polarization rotator provides
magneto-optical read-out by transforming the PMOKE-induced polarization change
into an intensity variation of the waveguide mode. According to the simulation
results based on a three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method, the
hybrid device can detect the magnetization states in targeted bits in a
magnetic racetrack medium down to ~ 100x100 nm2, regardless of the
magnetization state of the rest of the racetrack with a relative intensity
contrast of greater than 0.5% for a ~ 200x100 nm2 magnetic bit. We believe our
hybrid device can be an enabling technology that can connect integrated
photonics with nanoscale spintronics, paving the way toward ultrafast and
energy efficient advanced on-chip applications.

The macroscopic hydrodynamic equations are derived for many-body systems in
the local-equilibrium approach, using the Schr\"odinger picture of quantum
mechanics. In this approach, statistical operators are defined in terms of
microscopic densities associated with the fundamentally conserved quantities
and other slow modes possibly emerging from continuous symmetry breaking, as
well as macrofields conjugated to these densities. Functional identities can be
deduced, allowing us to identify the reversible and dissipative parts of the
mean current densities, to obtain general equations for the time evolution of
the conjugate macrofields, and to establish the relationship to
projection-operator methods. The entropy production is shown to be nonnegative
by applying the Peierls-Bogoliubov inequality to a quantum integral fluctuation
theorem. Using the expansion in the gradients of the conjugate macrofields, the
transport coefficients are given by Green-Kubo formulas and the entropy
production rate can be expressed in terms of quantum Einstein-Helfand formulas,
implying its nonnegativity in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.
The results apply to multicomponent fluids and can be extended to condensed
matter phases with broken continuous symmetries.

The chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect gives rise to strongly
spin-dependent transport through many organic molecules and structures. Its
discovery raises fascinating fundamental questions as well as the prospect of
possible applications. The basic phenomenology, a strongly asymmetric
magnetoresistance despite the absence of magnetism, is now understood to result
from the combination of spin-orbit coupling and chiral geometry. However,
experimental signatures of electronic helicity were observed at room
temperature, i.e., at an energy scale that exceeds the typical spin-orbit
coupling in organic systems by several orders of magnitude. This work shows
that a new energy scale for CISS emerges for currents carried by polarons,
i.e., in the presence of strong electron-phonon coupling. In particular, we
found that polaron fluctuations play a crucial role in the two manifestations
of CISS in transport measurements -- the spin-dependent transmission
probability through the system and asymmetric magnetoresistance.

We study the properties of charge transport in a novel holographic QPT
(quantum phase transition) model, which has two different metallic phases: the
normal metallic phase and the novel metallic one. We numerically work out the
scaling behaviors of DC (direct current) resistivity at low temperatures in
both different metallic phases. The numerical results are solidly in agreement
with the analytical ones determined by the near horizon geometry. Then, we
mainly explore the properties of the low-frequency AC (alternating current)
conductivity. A remarkable characteristic is that the normal metallic phase is
a coherent system with vanishing intrinsic conductivity $\sigma_Q$, which is
independent of the strength of the momentum dissipation. This result is in
contrast with the common belief that with the strength of the momentum
dissipation increasing, the system changes from a coherent phase to an
incoherent one. But the novel metallic phase is an incoherent system with
non-vanishing $\sigma_Q$. Away from the QCP (quantum critical point),
$\sigma_Q$ increases, which indicates that the incoherent behavior becomes
stronger.

Easy axis antiferromagnets are robust against external magnetic fields of
moderate strength. Spin reorientations in strong fields can provide an insight
into more subtle properties of antiferromagnetic materials, which are often
hidden by their high ground state symmetry. Here, we investigate theoretically
effects of curvature in ring-shaped antiferromagnetic achiral anisotropic spin
chains in strong magnetic fields. We identify the geometry-governed
helimagnetic phase transition above the spin-flop field between vortex and
onion states. The curvature-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction results
in the spin-flop transition being of first- or second-order depending on the
ring curvature. Spatial inhomogeneity of the N\'eel vector in the spin-flop
phase generates weak ferromagnetic response in the plane perpendicular to the
applied magnetic field. Our work contributes to the understanding of the
physics of curvilinear antiferromagnets in magnetic fields and guides
prospective experimental studies of geometrical effects relying on
spin-chain-based nanomagnets.

Consider a discrete one-dimensional random surface whose height at a point
grows as a function of the heights at neighboring points plus an independent
random noise. Assuming that this function is equivariant under constant shifts,
symmetric in its arguments, and at least six times continuously differentiable
in a neighborhood of the origin, we show that as the variance of the noise goes
to zero, any such process converges to the Cole-Hopf solution of the 1D KPZ
equation under a suitable scaling of space and time. This proves an invariance
principle for the 1D KPZ equation, in the spirit of Donsker's invariance
principle for Brownian motion.

Graphene can be turned into a semimetal with broken time-reversal symmetry by
adding a valley-dependent pseudo-scalar potential that shifts the Dirac point
energies in opposite directions, as in the modified Haldane model. We consider
a bilayer obtained by stacking two time-reversed copies of the modified Haldane
model, where conduction and valence bands cross to give rise to a nodal line in
each valleys. In the AB stacking, the interlayer hopping lifts the degeneracy
of the nodal lines and induces a band repulsion, leading surprisingly to a
chiral insulator with a Chern number $C=\pm2$. As a consequence a pair of
chiral edge states appears at the boundaries of the ribbon bilayer geometry. In
contrast, the AA stacking does not show nontrivial topological phases. We
discuss possible experimental implementations of our results.

<br>
<i>R. Nishino, T. C. Fujita, M. Kawasaki</i>
<br>
<br>
We demonstrate an electric field control of anomalous Hall effect emerging in
CaIrO$_3$/CaMnO$_3$ heterostructures. We fabricate both electron-type and
hole-type carrier samples by tuning epitaxial strain and then control the
carrier density in CaIrO$_3$ layer via electric double layer gating technique.
As the Fermi energy of CaIrO$_3$ is tuned close to the Dirac line node,
anomalous Hall conductivity is enlarged in both carrier-type samples. This
result reveals that the anomalous Hall effect comes from the intrinsic origin
reflecting the Dirac like dispersion in CaIrO$_3$. We propose that band
splitting induced by the interface ferromagnetism yields several band crossing
points near the Dirac line node. These points play as a source of the Berry
curvature and contribute to the anomalous Hall effect.
