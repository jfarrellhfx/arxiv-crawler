<h3>Spectral response of disorder-free localized lattice gauge theories</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14328" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14328</a>
<br>
<i>Nilotpal Chakraborty, Markus Heyl, Petr Karpov, Roderich Moessner</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that certain lattice gauge theories exhibiting disorder-free
localization have a characteristic response in spatially averaged spectral
functions: a few sharp peaks combined with vanishing response in the zero
frequency limit. This reflects the discrete spectra of small clusters of
kinetically active regions formed in such gauge theories when they fragment
into spatially finite clusters in the localized phase due to the presence of
static charges. We obtain the transverse component of the dynamic structure
factor, which is probed by neutron scattering experiments, deep in this phase
from a combination of analytical estimates and a numerical cluster expansion.
We also show that local spectral functions of large finite clusters host
discrete peaks whose positions agree with our analytical estimates. Further,
information spreading, diagnosed by an unequal time commutator, halts due to
real space fragmentation. Our results can be used to distinguish the
disorder-free localized phase from conventional paramagnetic counterparts in
those frustrated magnets which might realize such an emergent gauge theory.

<h3>Kinetic theory of two-dimensional point vortices and  fluctuation-dissipation theorem</h3>

We complete the kinetic theory of two-dimensional (2D) point vortices
initiated in previous works. We use a simpler and more physical formalism. We
consider a system of 2D point vortices submitted to a small external stochastic
perturbation and determine the response of the system to the perturbation. We
derive the diffusion coefficient and the drift by polarization of a test
vortex. We introduce a general Fokker-Planck equation involving a diffusion
term and a drift term. When the drift by polarization can be neglected, we
obtain a secular dressed diffusion (SDD) equation sourced by the external
noise. When the external perturbation is created by a discrete collection of
$N$ point vortices, we obtain a Lenard-Balescu-like kinetic equation reducing
to a Landau-like kinetic equation when collective effects are neglected. We
consider a multi-species system of point vortices. We discuss the process of
kinetic blocking in the single and multi-species cases. When the field vortices
are at statistical equilibrium (thermal bath), we establish the proper
expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for 2D point vortices
relating the power spectrum of the fluctuations to the response function of the
system. In that case, the drift coefficient and the diffusion coefficient
satisfy an Einstein-like relation and the Fokker Planck equation reduces to a
Smoluchowski-like equation. We mention the analogy between 2D point vortices
and stellar systems. In particular, the drift of a point vortex in 2D
hydrodynamics is the counterpart of the Chandrasekhar dynamical friction in
astrophysics. We also consider a gas of 2D Brownian point vortices described by
$N$ coupled stochastic Langevin equations and determine its mean and mesoscopic
evolution. In the present paper, we treat the case of unidirectional flows but
our results can be straightforwardly generalized to axisymmetric flows.

<h3>Topological transitions, turbulent-like motion and long-time-tails  driven by cell division in biological tissues</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14410" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14410</a>
<br>
<i>Xin Li, Sumit Sinha, T. R. Kirkpatrick, D. Thirumalai</i>
<br>
<br>
The complex spatiotemporal flow patterns in living tissues, driven by active
forces, have many of the characteristics associated with inertial turbulence
even though the Reynolds number is extremely low. Analyses of experimental data
from two-dimensional epithelial monolayers in combination with agent-based
simulations show that cell division and apoptosis lead to directed cell motion
for hours, resulting in rapid topological transitions in neighboring cells.
These transitions in turn generate both long ranged and long lived clockwise
and anticlockwise vortices, which gives rise to turbulent-like flows. Both
experiments and simulations show that at long wavelengths the wave vector ($k$)
dependent energy spectrum $E(k) \approx k^{-5/3}$, coinciding with the
Kolmogorov scaling in fully developed inertial turbulence. Using theoretical
arguments and simulations, we show that long-lived vortices lead to long-time
tails in the velocity auto-correlation function, $C_v(t) \sim t^{-1/2}$, which
has the same structure as in classical 2D fluids but with a different scaling
exponent.

<h3>Hydration structure of diamondoids from reactive force fields</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14514" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14514</a>
<br>

Diamondoids are promising materials for applications in catalysis and
nanotechnology. Since many of their applications are in aqueous environments,
to understand their function it is essential to know the structure and dynamics
of the water molecules in their first hydration shells. In this study, we
develop an improved reactive force field (ReaxFF) parameter set for
atomistically resolved molecular dynamics simulations of hydrated diamondoids
to characterize their interfacial water structure. We parameterize the force
field and validate the water structure against geometry-optimized structures
from density functional theory. We compare the results to water structures
around diamondoids with all partial charges set to zero, and around charged
smooth spheres, and find qualitatively similar water structuring in all cases.
However, the response of the water molecules is most sensitive to the partial
charges in the atomistically resolved diamondoids. From the systematic
exclusion of atomistic detail we can draw generic conclusions about the nature
of the hydrophobic effect at nanoparticle interfaces and link it to the
interfacial water structure. The interactions between discrete partial charges
on short length scales affect the hydration structures strongly but the
hydrophobic effect seems to be stable against these short scale surface
perturbations. Our methods and the workflow we present are transferable to
other hydrocarbons and interfacial systems.

<h3>Discontinuous shear thickening in biological tissue rheology</h3>

<br>
During embryonic morphogenesis, tissues undergo dramatic deformations in
order to form functional organs. Similarly, in adult animals, living cells and
tissues are continually subjected to forces and deformations. Therefore, the
success of embryonic development and the proper maintenance of physiological
functions rely on the ability of cells to withstand mechanical stresses as well
as their ability flow in a collective manner. During these events, mechanical
perturbations can originate from active processes at the single cell, competing
with external stresses exerted by surrounding tissues and organs. However, the
study of tissue mechanics has been somewhat limited to either the response to
external forces or to intrinsic ones. In this work, we study theoretically the
interplay of external deformations that are applied globally to a tissue as a
whole with internal active stresses that arise locally at the cellular level
due to cell motility. We elucidate in particular the way in which this
interplay between globally external and locally internal active driving
determines the emergent mechanical properties of the tissue as a whole. For a
tissue in the vicinity of a solid-fluid jamming/unjamming transition, we
uncover a host of fascinating rheological phenomena, including yielding, shear
thinning, continuous shear thickening (CST) and discontinuous shear thickening
(DST). These model predictions provide a framework for understanding the
recently observed nonlinear rheological behaviors {\it in vivo}.

<h3>Phase engineering in tantalum sulfide monolayers on Au(111)</h3>

<br>
<br>
We prepare monolayers of tantalum sulfide on Au(111) by evaporation of Ta in
a reactive background of H$_2$S. Under sulfur-rich conditions, monolayers of
2H-TaS$_2$ develop, whereas under sulfur-poor conditions TaS forms, a structure
that can be derived from 2H-TaS$_2$ by removal of the bottom S layer. We
analyse the alignment of the layers with respect to the substrate and the
relation with the domains in the Au(111) herringbone reconstruction using
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). With the help of density functional theory
(DFT) calculations we can determine the registry of the two phases with the
substrate. We develop a growth process that allows preparation of uniquely
oriented 2H-TaS$_2$ on Au(111). 2H-TaS$_2$ and TaS have a remarkably similar
in-plane lattice structure and we observe the formation of lateral
2H-TaS$_2$-TaS heterostructures with atomically well-defined and defect-free
boundaries. We observe mirror twin boundaries within 2H-TaS$_2$ along the S-
and Ta-edge.

<h3>Amorphous ultra-wide bandgap ZnOx thin films deposited at cryogenic  temperatures</h3>

Crystalline wurtzite zinc oxide (w-ZnO) can be used as a wide band gap
semiconductor for light emitting devices and for transparent or high
temperature electronics. The use of amorphous zinc oxide (a-ZnO) can be an
advantage in these applications. In this paper we report on X-ray amorphous
a-ZnOx thin films (~500 nm) deposited at cryogenic temperatures by reactive
magnetron sputtering. The substrates were cooled by a nitrogen flow through the
copper substrate holder during the deposition. The films were characterized by
X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, infrared, UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopies, and
ellipsometry. The a-ZnOx films on glass and Ti substrates were obtained at the
substrate holder temperature of approximately -100 oC. New vibration bands at
201, 372, and 473 cm-1 as well as O-H stretch and bend absorption bands in the
a-ZnOx films were detected by FTIR spectroscopy. Raman spectra showed
characteristic ZnO2 peaks at 386 and 858 cm-1 attributed to the peroxide ion
O22- stretching and libration modes, respectively. In addition, the films
contain neutral and ionized O2 and O2- species. The a-ZnOx films are highly
transparent in the visible light range (approx. 87%) and exhibit a refractive
index of 1.68 at 2.25 eV (550 nm). An optical band gaps is 4.65 eV with an
additional band edge absorption feature at 3.50 eV. It has been shown that the
deposition on actively cooled substrates can be a suitable technique to obtain
low temperature phases that cannot be deposited at room temperature.

<h3>Improvement of both performance and stability of photovoltaic devices by  in situ formation of a sulfur-based 2D perovskite</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15236" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15236</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with superior performance have been recognized
as a potential candidate in photovoltaic technologies. However, the defects in
active perovskite layer induce non-radiative recombination which restricts the
performance and stability of the PSCs. The construction of thiophene-based 2D
structure is one of the significant approaches for surface passivation of
hybrid PSCs that may combine the benefits of the stability of 2D perovskite
with the high performance of 3D perovskite. Here, a sulfur-rich spacer cation
2-thiopheneethylamine iodide (TEAI) is synthesized as a passivation agent for
the construction of three-dimensional/two-dimensional (3D/2D) perovskite
bilayer structure. TEAI-treated PSCs possess a much higher efficiency (20.06%)
compared to the 3D perovskite (MAFAPbI3) devices (17.42%). Time-resolved
photoluminescence (TRPL) and femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy
are employed to investigate the effect of surface passivation on the charge
carrier dynamics of the 3D perovskite. Additionally, the stability test of
TEAI-treated perovskite devices reveals significant improvement in humid (RH ~
56%) and thermal stability as the sulfur-based 2D (TEA)2PbI4 material
self-assembles on the 3D surface making the perovskite surface hydrophobic. Our
findings provide a reliable approach to improve device stability and
performance successively, paving the way for industrialization of PSCs.

<h3>Orbital selective coupling in CeRh$_3$B$_2$: co-existence of high Curie  and high Kondo temperature</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigated the electronic structure of the enigmatic CeRh$_3$B$_2$ using
resonant inelastic scattering and x-ray absorption spectroscopy in combination
with $ab$ $initio$ density functional calculations. We find that the Rh 4$d$
states are irrelevant for the high-temperature ferromagnetism and the Kondo
effect. We also find that the Ce 4$f$ crystal-field strength is too small to
explain the strong reduction of the Ce magnetic moment. The data reveal instead
the presence of two different active Ce 4$f$ orbitals, with each coupling
selectively to different bands in CeRh$_3$B$_2$. The inter-site hybridization
of the |J=5/2,Jz=+/-1/2> crystal-field state and Ce 5$d$ band combined with the
intra-site Ce 4$f$-5$d$ exchange creates the strong ferromagnetism, while
hybridization between the |J=5/2,Jz=+/-5/2> and the B $sp$ in the $ab$-plane
contributes to the Kondo interaction which causes the moment reduction. This
orbital selective coupling explains the unique and seemingly contradictory
properties of CeRh$_3$B$_2$.

<h3>Evolution of an attractive polarized Fermi gas: From a Fermi liquid of  polarons to a non-Fermi liquid at the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov  quantum critical point</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15529" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15529</a>
<br>
<i>Michele Pini, Pierbiagio Pieri, Giancarlo Calvanese Strinati</i>
<br>
<br>
The evolution of an attractive polarized two-component Fermi gas at zero
temperature is analyzed as its polarization is progressively decreased, from
full polarization (corresponding to the polaronic limit) down to a critical
polarization when superfluidity sets in. This critical polarization and the
nature of the associated superfluid instability are determined within a fully
self-consistent $t$-matrix approach implemented exactly at zero temperature. In
this way, the polarization-vs-coupling phase diagram at zero temperature is
constructed throughout the whole BCS-BEC crossover. Depending on the coupling
strength of the inter-particle interaction between the two components, the
superfluid instability can be either toward a Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov
(FFLO) phase or toward a standard polarized BCS phase. The evolution with
polarization of the quasi-particle parameters in the normal Fermi gas turns out
to be notably different in the two cases. When the instability is toward a
polarized BCS superfluid, quasi-particles in the proximity of the two Fermi
surfaces remain well defined for all polarizations. When the instability is
instead toward an FFLO superfluid, precursor effects become apparent upon
approaching the FFLO quantum critical point (QCP), where the quasi-particle
residues vanish and the effective masses diverge. This behavior leads to a
complete breakdown of the quasi-particle picture characteristic of a Fermi
liquid, similarly to what occurs in heavy-fermion materials at an
antiferromagnetic QCP. At unitarity, the system is further investigated at
finite temperature, making it possible to identify a non-Fermi liquid region in
the temperature-vs-polarization phase diagram associated with the underlying
FFLO QCP.

<h3>Non-linear Transport Phenomena and Current-induced Hydrodynamics in  Ultra-high Mobility Two-dimensional Electron Gas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15551" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15551</a>
<br>
<i>Zitong Wang, Michael Hilke, Norm Fong, Guy Austing, Sergei Studenikin, Ken West, Loren Pfeiffer</i>
<br>
<br>
We report on non-linear transport phenomena at high filling factor and DC
current-induced electronic hydrodynamics in an ultra-high mobility (mu=20x10^6
cm^2/Vs) two-dimensional electron gas in a narrow (15 micron wide) GaAs/AlGaAs
Hall bar for DC current densities reaching 0.67 A/m. The various phenomena and
the boundaries between the phenomena are captured together in a two-dimensional
differential resistivity map as a function of magnetic field (up to 250 mT) and
DC current. This map, which resembles a phase diagram, demarcate distinct
regions dominated by Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations (and phase inversion
of these oscillations) around zero DC current; negative magnetoresistance and a
double-peak feature (both ballistic in origin) around zero field; and Hall
field-induced resistance oscillations (HIROs) radiating out from the origin.
From a detailed analysis of the data near zero field, we show that increasing
the DC current suppresses the electron-electron scattering length that drives a
growing hydrodynamic contribution to both the differential longitudinal and
transverse (Hall) resistivities. Our approach to induce hydrodynamics with DC
current differs from the more usual approach of changing the temperature. We
also find a significant (factor of two to four) difference between the quantum
lifetime extracted from SdH oscillations, and the quantum lifetime extracted
from HIROs. In addition to observing HIRO peaks up to the seventh order, we
observe an unexpected HIRO-like feature close to mid-way between the
first-order and the second-order HIRO maxima at high DC current.

A new high field spectrometer has been built to extend the capabilities of
the $\beta$-detected nuclear magnetic resonance ($\beta$-NMR) facility at
TRIUMF. This new beamline extension allows $\beta$-NMR spectroscopy to be
performed with fields up to 200 mT parallel to a sample's surface
(perpendicular to the ion beam), allowing depth-resolved studies of local
electromagnetic fields with spin polarized probes at a much higher applied
magnetic field than previously available in this configuration. The primary
motivation and application is to allow studies of superconducting radio
frequency (SRF) materials, close to the critical fields of Nb metal, which is
extensively used to fabricate SRF cavities. The details of the design
considerations and implementation of the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) system, ion
optics, beam diagnostics are presented here. Commissioning of the beamline and
spectrometer with radioactive ions are also reported here. Future capabilities
and applications in other areas are also described.

<h3>Two Dimensional Isometric Tensor Networks on an Infinite Strip</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14337" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14337</a>

The exact contraction of a generic two-dimensional (2D) tensor network state
(TNS) is known to be exponentially hard, making simulation of 2D systems
difficult. The recently introduced class of isometric TNS (isoTNS) represents a
subset of TNS that allows for efficient simulation of such systems on finite
square lattices. The isoTNS ansatz requires the identification of an
"orthogonality column" of tensors, within which one-dimensional matrix product
state (MPS) methods can be used for calculation of observables and optimization
of tensors. Here we extend isoTNS to infinitely long strip geometries and
introduce an infinite version of the Moses Move algorithm for moving the
orthogonality column around the network. Using this algorithm, we iteratively
transform an infinite MPS representation of a 2D quantum state into a strip
isoTNS and investigate the entanglement properties of the resulting state. In
addition, we demonstrate that the local observables can be evaluated
efficiently. Finally, we introduce an infinite time-evolving block decimation
algorithm (iTEBD\textsuperscript{2}) and use it to approximate the ground state
of the 2D transverse field Ising model on lattices of infinite strip geometry.

<h3>A Theoretical Study on Band-Gap Engineering of CsCaI3 by Si Doping for  Photo Voltaic Applications</h3>

Density functional theory based First Principles calculations were used to
study the effect of Silicon (Si) doping on the structural, electronic and
optical properties of CsCaI3. From our calculations, we predict that CsCaI3 can
form stable perovskite structure. It is also observed that after substitutional
doping of Si in CsCaI3, the material still can stay in perovskite form. Band
structure studies showed that with Si doping, the band gap can be varied from
4.76eV for un-doped CsCaI3 to 0.639eV for 75 percent Si doped CsCaI3. The
optical absorption spectra of the materials showed that Si doping can induce
light absorption in the visible region in CsCaI3. Electron Localization
Function (ELF) and effective mass calculations show that Si doping can improve
the electronic conduction in this material to meet the requirements of photo
Voltaic applications.

<h3>Dissipative Symmetry-Protected Topological Order</h3>

<i>Luan M. Veríssimo, Marcelo L. Lyra, Román Orús</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we investigate the interplay between dissipation and
symmetry-protected topological order. We considered the one-dimensional Spin-1
Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model interacting with an environment where the
dissipative dynamics are described by the Lindladian master equation. The
Markovian dynamics is solved by the implementation of a tensor-network
algorithm for mixed states in the thermodynamic limit. We observe that, for
time-reversal symmetric dissipation, the resulting steady state has topological
signatures even if being a mixed state. This is seen in finite string-order
parameters as well as in the degeneracy pattern of singular values in the
tensor network decomposition of the reduced density matrix. We also show that
such features do not appear for non-symmetric dissipation. Our work opens the
way toward a generalized and more practical definition of symmetry-protected
topological order for mixed states induced by dissipation.

Light-weight alloys are essential pillars of transportation technologies.
They also play a crucial role to achieve a more green and cost-effective
aerospace technologies. Magnesium-lithium-aluminum (Mg-Li-Al) alloys are
auspicious candidates due to their promising mechanical strengths at low
densities. We herein present a systematic first-principles investigation of the
Mg-Li-Al-based alloys to provide insights for designing ultra-strong
light-weight alloys. Initial analysis indicates that the Mg-Li-Al mixtures are
not thermally stabilized into random-solid solutions. Following this hint, the
base-centered cubic (BCC)-based intermetallics of Mg, Li and Al are
investigated for their thermal and elastic stabilities.Three simple figures of
merits are used to further assess their mechanical strengths. The
most-frequently observed intermetallics are used to predict the yield strength
of the hetero-structures from the recent experimental works. The rule of mixing
works reasonable well to predict the mechanical properties of complex
structures starting from isolated intermetallics.

<h3>Realistic Spin Model for Multiferroic NiI$_2$</h3>

<br>
A realistic first-principle-based spin Hamiltonian is constructed for the
type-II multiferroic NiI$_2$, using symmetry-adapted cluster expansion method.
Besides single ion anisotropy and isotropic Heisenberg terms, the model further
includes the Kitaev interaction and the biquadratic term. Such model can well
reproduce the experimental helical ground state, in terms of, e.g., the proper
screw state, canting of rotation plane, propagation direction and period.
Combining the model and a phase diagram, it is demonstrated that, (i) the
in-plane propagation direction of $\langle1\bar10\rangle$ is determined by the
Kitaev interaction, instead of the long-believed exchange frustrations; (ii)
the canting of rotation plane is also dominantly determined by Kitaev
interaction, rather than interlayer couplings. Monte Carlo simulations reveal
three equivalent domains and different topological defects. The present
realistic model for NiI$_2$ thus not only demonstrates the role of Kitaev
interaction in stabilizing noncollinear spin textures, but also paves the way
to better study the multiferroicity of NiI$_2$.

<h3>Varied competition among three multiferroic phases of NiI$_{2}$ from the  bulk to the monolayer limit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14423" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14423</a>

<br>
<br>
The monolayer (ML) of NiI$_{2}$ was recently suggested to be a type-II
multiferroic material, based on a presumed magnetic configuration and a
supposed origin of the enhanced second harmonic generation (SHG) signal. Here,
we found that such an assumption is flawed at the monolayer limit where a
freestanding ML NiI$_{2}$ showing broken $C_{3}$ symmetry prefers to a striped
antiferromagnetic order (AABB-AFM) along with an intralayer antiferroelectric
(AFE) order. However, the $C_{3}$ symmetry of the monolayer may preserve under
a substrate confinement, which leads to a spiral magnetic order (Spiral-Y), a
different spiral order from that of the bulk counterpart (Spiral-B). The
Spiral-Y order persists up to 4L thickness and shows ferroelectricity (FE)
ascribed to an inversed Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (D-M) interaction. Thus, those
three type-II multiferroic phases, namely Spiral-B+FE, Spiral-Y+FE and
AABB-AFM+AFE, emerge for NiI$_{2}$ with different layer numbers and structural
symmetries. Such a magnetic groundstate variation from the bulk to ML NiI$_{2}$
originates from the competition among thickness dependent D-M, Kitaev and
Heisenberg spin-exchange interactions, as well as single-ion magnetic
anisotropy. These theoretical results not only clarify the multiferroics of
NiI$_{2}$, but also enlighten us the role of layer-stacking induced change of
noncollinear spin-exchange interactions and magnetic anisotropy in
thickness-dependent magnetic transitions of two-dimensional magnets.

<br>
<br>
Electronic phase separation (EPS) originates from an incomplete
transformation between electronic phases, causing the inhomogeneous spatial
distribution of electronic properties. In the system of two-dimensional
electron gas (2DEG), the EPS is usually identified based on a percolative
metal-to-superconductor transition. Here, we report a metal-insulator
transition (MIT) in KTaO3-based 2DEG with the width of conductive channel
decreasing into micrometer scale. Hysteretic resistance-temperature relations
are observed due to the competition between metallic and insulating phases,
which is tunable by magnetic field. Such a size-dependent MIT effect is
attributed to the coexistence and separation of metallic and insulating phases.
Combining density functional theory calculation, we propose a theoretical model
to simulate the dynamic process of the EPS using the percolation theory,
demonstrating the mechanism of size-dependent MIT. Our work suggests a clear
and simple 2DEG platform to achieve the spatial coexistence of metallic and
insulating phases.

<br>
<br>
Layered transition metal hydroxides (LTMHs) with transition metal centers
sandwiched between layers of coordinating hydroxide anions have attracted
considerable interest for their potential in developing clean energy sources
and storage technologies. However, two dimensional (2D) LTMHs remain largely
unstudied in terms of their physical properties and the applications in
electronic devices. Here, directed by the relationship of the spin state of 3d
transition metal (TM) ions such as Ni, Co, Cu, and the corresponding geometry
of the crystal field, we discover that Ni2+ with perfect Oh symmetry is ideal
for intraplanar growth, leading to the achievement of >20 {\mu}m
{\alpha}-Ni(OH)2 2D crystals with high yield, which are the largest 2D domains
reported so far. We also report the successful synthesis of 2D Co(OH)2 crystals
(>40 {\mu}m) with less yield due to the slight geometry distortion resulted
from uneven number of electrons. Moreover, the detailed structural
characterization of synthesized {\alpha}-Ni(OH)2 are performed; the optical
band gap energy is extrapolated as 2.54 eV from optical absorption measurements
and is measured as 2.50 eV from reflected electrons energy loss spectroscopy
(REELS), suggesting the potential as insulating 2D dielectric material for
electronic devices. Furthermore, key parameters of the hydrothermal reaction
including soaking temperature, starting pH and cooling rate, are systematically
tuned to understand their effects on morphological and crystallographic
perspectives, allowing the establishment of a 2D growth mechanism. This work
demonstrates a scalable pathway to synthesize large 2D LTMHs from simple
methods, paving the way for the study of fundamental physical properties and
device applications of 2D LTMHs.

<h3>Full Temperature-Dependent Potential and Anharmonicity in Metallic  Hydrogen: Colossal NQE and the Consequences</h3>

<br>
<i>Hua Y. Geng</i>
<br>
<br>
The temperature-dependent effective potential (TDEP) method for anharmonic
phonon dispersion is generalized to the full potential case by combining with
path integral formalism. This extension naturally resolves the intrinsic
difficulty in the original TDEP at low temperature. The new method is applied
to solid metallic hydrogen at high pressure. A colossal nuclear quantum effect
(NQE) and subsequent anharmonicity are discovered, which not only leads to
unexpectedly large drift of protons, but also slows down the convergence rate
substantially when computing the phonon dispersions. By employing direct ab
initio path integral molecular dynamics simulations as the benchmark, a
possible breakdown of phonon picture in metallic hydrogen due to colossal NQE
is indicated, implying novel lattice dynamical phenomena might exist. Inspired
by this observation, a general theoretical formalism for quantum lattice
dynamics beyond phonon is sketched, with the main features being discussed.

<h3>Residual Entropy of a Two-dimensional Ising Model with Crossing and  Four-spin Interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14483" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14483</a>
<br>
<i>De-Zhang Li, Yu-Jun Zhao, Yao Yao, Xiao-Bao Yang</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the residual entropy of a two-dimensional Ising model with crossing
and four-spin interactions, both for the case that in zero magnetic field and
that in an imaginary magnetic field i({\pi}/2)kT. The spin configurations of
this Ising model can be mapped into the hydrogen configurations of square ice
with the defined standard direction of the hydrogen bonds. Making use of the
equivalence of this Ising system with the exactly solved eight-vertex model and
taking the low temperature limit, we obtain the residual entropy. Two soluble
cases in zero field and one soluble case in imaginary field are examined. In
the case that the free-fermion condition holds in zero field, we find the
ground states in low temperature limit include the configurations disobeying
the ice rules. In another case in zero field that the four-spin interactions
are -{\infty}, and the case in imaginary field that the four-spin interactions
are 0, the residual entropy exactly agrees with the result of square ice
determined by Lieb in 1967. In the solutions of the latter two cases, we have
shown alternative approaches to the residual entropy problem of square ice.

<h3>Investigating the effect of electronic correlation on transport  properties and phononic states of Vanadium</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14504" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14504</a>
<br>
<i>Prakash Pandey, Vivek Pandey, Sudhir K. Pandey</i>
<br>
<br>
In the present work, we have tried to investigate the importance of
electronic correlation on transport properties and phononic states of Vanadium
(V). The temperature-dependent electrical resistivity ($\rho$) and electronic
part of thermal conductivity ($\kappa_e$) due to electron-electron interactions
(EEIs) and electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) are computed. The values of
$\rho$ due to EEIs are found to be extremely small in comparison to $\rho$ due
to EPIs. For instance, at 300 K, the calculated value of $\rho$ due to EEIs
(EPIs) is $\sim$ 0.859$\times10^{-3}$ ($\sim$ 0.20) $\mu\Omega$m. The
magnitudes of $\kappa_e$ due to EPIs are found to be in good agreement with the
experimental results. These observations indicate the negligible importance of
EEIs to these quantities for V. However, at 300 K, the value of Seebeck
coefficient ($S$) at DFT+DMFT level ($\sim$ -0.547 $\mu$VK$^{-1}$) is found to
be entirely different than at DFT level ($\sim 7.401$ $\mu$VK$^{-1}$). Also,
the DFT+DMFT value of $S$ at 300 K is in good match with the available
experimental data (-1.06 $\mu$VK$^{-1}$, 1.0 $\mu$VK$^{-1}$). Apart from this,
the study of phononic states at DFT and DFT+DMFT level is performed. The
obtained phononic band structure and phonon DOS at DFT+DMFT differ to a good
extent from that at DFT. The maximum energy of phononic state obtained at DFT
(DFT+DMFT) is $\sim$ 33.83 ($\sim$ 35.15) meV, where the result of DFT+DMFT is
obtained more closer to the experimental data (35.15, 36.98 & 41.77 meV). These
results highlight the importance of electronic correlation on $S$ & phononic
states of simple correlated V metal.

The equation for the size strain plot methods reported by A. Khorsand Zak et
al. (Solid State Sci. 13 (2011), 251) does not follow the dimensional
homogeneity, consequently leading to an inaccurate estimation of the
crystallite size and strain values of the materials under investigation and the
dimensions of the obtained parameters. We also perceived an error in the values
of crystallite size and strain reported by the authors using the size-strain
plot method. We will discuss the importance of dimensional analysis and its
repercussions on the estimated values and the units of parameters.

<h3>Temperature dependence of the energy band gap in ZrTe$_5$: implications  for the topological phase</h3>

<br>
<br>
Using Landau level spectroscopy, we determine the temperature dependence of
the energy band gap in zirconium pentatelluride (ZrTe$_5$). We find that the
band gap reaches $E_g=(5 \pm 1)$ meV at low temperatures and increases
monotonously when the temperature is raised. This implies that ZrTe$_5$ is a
weak topological insulator, with non-inverted ordering of electronic bands in
the center of the Brillouin zone. Our magneto-transport experiments performed
in parallel show that the resistivity anomaly in ZrTe$_5$ is not connected with
the temperature dependence of the band gap.

<h3>Spontaneous superconducting diode effect in non-magnetic  Nb/Ru/Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ topological junctions</h3>

<br>
<br>
Non-reciprocal electronic transport in a material occurs if both time
reversal and inversion symmetries are broken. The superconducting diode effect
(SDE) is an exotic manifestation of this type of behavior where the critical
current for positive and negative currents are mismatched, as recently observed
in some non-centrosymmetric superconductors with a magnetic field. Here, we
demonstrate a SDE in non-magnetic Nb/Ru/Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ Josephson junctions
without applying an external magnetic field. The cooling history dependence of
the SDE suggests that time-reversal symmetry is intrinsically broken by the
superconducting phase of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Applied magnetic fields modify the SDE
dynamically by randomly changing the sign of the non-reciprocity. We propose a
model for such a topological junction with a conventional superconductor
surrounded by a chiral superconductor with broken time reversal symmetry.

<h3>A benchmark of first-principles methods for accurate prediction of  semiconductor band gaps</h3>

<br>
<br>
The band gap is an important parameter of semiconductor materials that
influences several functional properties, in particular optical properties.
However, a fast and reliable first-principles prediction of band gaps remains a
challenging problem. Standard DFT approximations tend to strongly underestimate
band gaps, while the more accurate $GW$ and hybrid functionals are much more
computationally demanding and unsuitable for high-throughput screening. In this
work, we have performed an extensive benchmark of several approximations with
different computational complexity ($G_{0}W_{0}$@PBEsol, HSE06, PBEsol, mBJ,
PBEsol$-1/2$, and ACBN0) to evaluate and compare their performance in
predicting the band gap of semiconductors. The benchmark is based on 114 binary
semiconductors of different compositions and crystal structures, where about
half of them have experimental band gaps. We find that, as expected,
$G_{0}W_{0}$@PBEsol performs well relative to the experiment, with a noticeable
underestimation of the band gaps by about 14% on average. Surprisingly,
$G_{0}W_{0}$@PBEsol is followed closely by the much computationally cheaper
pseudo-hybrid ACBN0 functional, showing an excellent performance with respect
to experimental data. The meta-GGA mBJ functional also performs well relative
to the experiment, even slightly better than $G_{0}W_{0}$@PBEsol in terms of
mean absolute (percentage) error. The HSE06 and PBEsol$-1/2$ schemes perform
overall worse than ACBN0 and mBJ schemes but much better than PBEsol. Comparing
the calculated band gaps on the whole data set (including the samples with no
experimental band gap), we find that HSE06 and mBJ have excellent agreement
with respect to the reference $G_{0}W_{0}$@PBEsol band gaps. Thus, we propose
the mBJ band gaps as economic descriptors when developing artificial
intelligence models for high-throughput screening of semiconductor band gaps.

Deep neural networks (NN) suffer from scaling issues when considering a large
number of neurons, in turn limiting also the accessible number of layers. To
overcome this, here we propose the integration of tensor networks (TN) into
NNs, in combination with variational DMRG-like optimization. This results in a
scalable tensor neural network (TNN) architecture that can be efficiently
trained for a large number of neurons and layers. The variational algorithm
relies on a local gradient-descent technique, with tensor gradients being
computable either manually or by automatic differentiation, in turn allowing
for hybrid TNN models combining dense and tensor layers. Our training algorithm
provides insight into the entanglement structure of the tensorized trainable
weights, as well as clarify the expressive power as a quantum neural state. We
benchmark the accuracy and efficiency of our algorithm by designing TNN models
for regression and classification on different datasets. In addition, we also
discuss the expressive power of our algorithm based on the entanglement
structure of the neural network.

<h3>The role of boundaries for displacements and motion in two-dimensional  fluid or elastic films and membranes</h3>

<br>
<br>
Thin fluid or elastic films and membranes are found in nature and technology,
for instance, as confinements of living cells or in loudspeakers. When applying
a net force, resulting flows in an unbounded two-dimensional incompressible
low-Reynolds-number fluid or displacements in a two-dimensional linearly
elastic solid seem to diverge logarithmically with the distance from the force
center, which has led to some debate. Recently, we have demonstrated that such
divergences cancel when the total (net) force vanishes. Here, we illustrate
that, if a net force is present, the boundaries play a prominent role. Already
a single no-slip boundary regulates the flow and displacement fields and leads
to their decay to leading order inversely in distance from a force center and
the boundary. In other words, it is the boundary that stabilizes the system in
this situation, unlike the three-dimensional case, where an unbounded medium by
itself is able to absorb a net force. We quantify the mobility and
displaceability of an inclusion as a function of the distance from the
boundary, as well as interactions between different inclusions. In the case of
free-slip boundary conditions, a kinked boundary is necessary to achieve
stabilization.

Since the problem of the residual entropy of square ice was exactly solved,
exact solutions for two-dimensional realistic ice models have been of interest.
In this paper, we study the exact residual entropy of ice hexagonal monolayer
in two cases. In the case that the external electric field along the z-axis
exists, we map the hydrogen configurations into the spin configurations of the
Ising model on the Kagom\'e lattice. By taking the low temperature limit of the
Ising model, we derive the exact residual entropy, which agrees with the result
determined previously from the dimer model on the honeycomb lattice. In another
case that the ice hexagonal monolayer is under the periodic boundary conditions
in the cubic ice lattice, we employ the six-vertex model on the square lattice
to represent the hydrogen configurations obeying the ice rules. The exact
residual entropy in this case is obtained from the solution of the equivalent
six-vertex model. Our work provides more examples of the exactly soluble
two-dimensional models.

We propose a scheme to fabricate the cobalt nitride CoN4 monolayer, a

are in a plane. Under the pressure above 40 GPa, the bulk CoN4 is stabilized in
a triclinic phase. With the pressure decreasing, the triclinic phase of CoN4 is
transformed into an orthorhombic phase, and the latter is a layered compound
with large interlayer spacing. At ambient condition, the weak interlayer
couplings are so small that single CoN4 layer can be exfoliated by the
mechanical method.

Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials have attracted tremendous research
interest because of the promising application in the next-generation
microelectronic devices. Here, by the first-principles calculations, we propose
a two-dimensional ferromagnetic material with high Curie temperature, manganese
tetranitride MnN$_4$ monolayer, which is a square-planar lattice made up of
only one layer of atoms. The structure is demonstrated to be stable by the
phonon spectra and the molecular dynamic simulations, and the stability is
ascribed to the $\pi$-d conjugation between $\pi$ orbital of N=N bond and Mn
$d$ orbital. More interestingly, the MnN$_4$ monolayer displays robust 2D
ferromagnetism, which originates from the strong exchange couplings between Mn
atoms due to the $\pi$-d conjugation. The high critical temperature of 247 K is
determined by solving the Heisenberg model with the Monte Carlo method.

Transition metal nitrides (TMNs) exhibit fascinating physical properties that
hold great potential in future device applications. To stack two-dimensional
TMNs with other functional materials that have dissimilar orientations and
symmetries requires to separate epitaxial TMNs from the growth substrates.
However, the lattice constants of TMNs are not compatible with those of most
sacrificial layers, leading to a great challenge to fabricate high-quality
single crystalline TMN membranes. In this letter, we report the application of
a water-soluble BaO sacrificial layer as a general approach to create
freestanding TMN membranes. Taken CrN as an example, the relatively small
lattice mismatch and identical cubic structure between BaO and CrN ensure the
growth of heterostructures. Millimeter-size CrN membrane allows us to directly
observe the planar-view of atomic structure and to correlate its electronic
state with intrinsic transport properties. Our work provides the opportunity to
fabricate freestanding TMN membranes and the ability to transfer them to
arbitrary substrates. The integration of TMN membranes with other materials
will stimulate further studies in the emergent phenomena at heterointerfaces.

Recently, the Josephson diode effect (JDE), in which the superconducting
critical current magnitudes differ when the currents flow in opposite
directions, has attracted great interest. In particular, it was demonstrated
that gate-defined Josephson junctions based on magic angle twisted bilayer
graphene showed a strong nonreciprocal effect when the weak-link region is
gated to a correlated insulating state at half-filling (two holes per moir\'e
cell). However, the mechanism behind such a phenomenon is not yet understood.
In this work, we show that the interaction-driven valley polarization, together
with the trigonal warping of the Fermi surface, induce the JDE. The valley
polarization, which lifts the degeneracy of the states in the two valleys,
induces a relative phase difference between the first and the second harmonics
of supercurrent and result in the JDE. We further show that the nontrivial
current phase relation, which is responsible for the JDE, also generates the
asymmetric Shapiro steps. Importantly, our theory of JDE can be generalized to
provide an alternative explanation of JDEs observed in the recent experiments.

The Moore's law in the semiconducting industry has faltered as the
three-dimensional (3D) Si-based transistors has approached their physical limit
with the downscaling. The carrier mobility $\rm \mu $, critical to the device's
performance, will be degraded when the thickness of Si is scaled into several
nanometers. In contrast to the bulk counterpart, two-dimensional (2D)
semiconductors can be scaled into atomic-layer thickness without dangling
bonds, maintaining its intrinsic carrier mobility and going beyond the limits
of Si-based electronics. Hence, the development of novel 2D semiconducting
materials with high carrier mobility is the market demand as well as the
scientific challenge. Here, we successfully designed 2D $\rm
{Be_{3}B_{2}C_{3}}$ with planar hypercoordinate motif. It possesses the perfect
planar skeleton with both pentacoordinate carbon and hexacoordinate boron
moieties, which is the first reported material with such multi-hypercoordinate

as well as mechanical properties. Further investigations reveal that the $\rm

\times 10^{5} m/s$), suitable direct bandgap (1.97 eV), and high optical
absorption coefficient ($\rm 10^{5}$). As a result, an unprecedented ultrahigh
room-temperature carrier mobility ($\rm 8.1 \times 10^{5} cm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}$)
with strong anisotropy is discovered, making $\rm {Be_{3}B_{2}C_{3}}$ monolayer

The nanocrystalline-amorphous textures are commonly observed in the coatings
synthesized by energetic deposition. We report a binary phase separation
towards Cu-C nanocrystalline-amorphous composites by the FCVA deposition. The
experimental results highlight that the average size of Cu nanocrystallines
mainly depends on the C2H2 content. By performing a MD simulation using the
LAMMPS, we theoretically explained how the initial reagent concentration
fundamentally determines Cu nanocrystalline's final morphology and size during
phase separation. This finding may give insight into the formation of
nanocrystalline-amorphous structures by energetic deposition.

We study the collective motion of self-propelled particles affected by the
spatial-dependent noise based on the Vicsek rules. Only the particles inside
the special region will affected by noise. The consideration of the
spatial-dependent noise is closer to reality because of the complexity of the
environment. Interestingly, we find that there exists an optimal amplitude of
noise to adjust the average motional direction of the system. Particular
orientation of the noisy region makes the motional direction of the system
parallel to the orientation of the noisy region. The adjustment of the motional
direction of the system also depends on the shape, the proportion and the
spatial distribution of the noisy region. Our findings may inspire the capture
of the key features of collective motion underlying various phenomena.

<h3>Universal singularities of anomalous diffusion in the Richardson class</h3>

Inhomogeneous environments are rather ubiquitous in nature, often implying
anomalies resulting in deviation from Gaussianity of diffusion processes. While
sub- and superdiffusion are usually due to conversing environmental features
(hindering or favoring the motion, respectively), they are both observed in
systems ranging from the micro- to the cosmological scale. Here we show how a
model encompassing sub- and superdiffusion in an inhomogeneous environment
exhibits a critical singularity in the normalized generator of the cumulants.
The singularity originates directly from the asymptotics of the non-Gaussian
scaling function of displacement, which we prove to be independent of other
details and hence to retain a universal character. Our analysis, based on the
method first applied in [A. L. Stella et al., arXiv:2209.02042 (2022)], further
allows to establish a relation between the asympototics and diffusion exponents
characteristic of processes in the Richardson class. Extensive numerical tests
fully confirm the results.

<br>
<br>
By using modular functions on the upper complex half-plane, we study a class
of strain energies for crystalline materials whose global invariance originates
from the full symmetry group of the underlying lattice. This follows Ericksen's
suggestion which aimed at extending the Landau-type theories to encompass the
behavior of crystals undergoing structural phase transformation, with twinning,
microstructure formation, and possibly associated plasticity effects. Here we
investigate such Ericksen-Landau strain energies for the modelling of
reconstructive transformations, focusing on the prototypical case of the
square-hexagonal phase change in 2D crystals. We study the bifurcation and
valley-floor network of these potentials, and use one in the simulation of a
quasi-static shearing test. We observe typical effects associated with the
micro-mechanics of phase transformation in crystals, in particular, the bursty
progression of the structural phase change, characterized by intermittent
stress-relaxation through microstructure formation, mediated, in this
reconstructive case, by defect nucleation and movement in the lattice.

<h3>Sequencing the Entangled DNA of Fractional Quantum Hall Fluids</h3>

<br>
<br>
We introduce and prove the "root theorem", which establishes a condition for
families of operators to annihilate all root states associated with zero modes
of a given positive semi-definite $k$-body Hamiltonian chosen from a large
class. This class is motivated by fractional quantum Hall and related problems,
and features generally long-ranged, one-dimensional, dipole-conserving terms.
Our theorem streamlines analysis of zero-modes in contexts where "generalized"
or "entangled" Pauli principles apply. One major application of the theorem is
to parent Hamiltonians for mixed Landau-level wave functions, such as
unprojected composite fermion or parton-like states that were recently
discussed in the literature, where it is difficult to rigorously establish a
complete set of zero modes with traditional polynomial techniques. As a simple
application we show that a modified $V_1$ pseudo-potential, obtained via
retention of only half the terms, stabilizes the $\nu=1/2$ Tao-Thouless state
as the unique densest ground state.

<h3>Harnessing dislocation motion using an electric field</h3>

Dislocations, line defects in crystalline materials, play an essential role
in the mechanical[1,2], electrical[3], optical[4], thermal[5], and phase
transition[6] properties of these materials. Dislocation motion, an important
mechanism underlying crystal plasticity, is critical for the hardening,
processing, and application of a wide range of structural and functional
materials[1,7,8]. For decades, the movement of dislocations has been widely
observed in crystalline solids under mechanical loading[9-11]. However, the
goal of manipulating dislocation motion via a non-mechanical field alone
remains elusive. Here, we present real-time observations of dislocation motion
controlled solely by an external electric field in single-crystalline zinc
sulfide (ZnS). We find that 30{\deg} partial dislocations can move back and
forth depending on the direction of the electric field, while 90{\deg} partial
dislocations are motionless. We reveal the nonstoichiometric nature of
dislocation cores using atomistic imaging and determine their charge
characteristics by density functional theory calculations. The glide barriers
of charged 30{\deg} partial dislocations, which are lower than those of
90{\deg} partial dislocations, further decrease under an electric field,
explaining the experimental observations. This study provides direct evidence
of dislocation dynamics under a non-mechanical stimulus and opens up the
possibility of modulating dislocation-related properties.

<h3>Homogeneous nucleation of dislocations as a pattern formation phenomenon</h3>

Dislocation nucleation in homogeneous crystals initially unfolds as a linear
symmetry-breaking elastic instability. In the absence of explicit nucleation
centers, such instability develops simultaneously all over the crystal and due
to the dominance of long range elastic interactions it advances into the
nonlinear stage as a collective phenomenon through pattern formation. In this
paper we use a novel mesoscopic tensorial model (MTM) of crystal plasticity to
study the delicate role of crystallographic symmetry in the development of the
dislocation nucleation patterns in defect free crystals loaded in a hard
device. The model is formulated in 2D and we systematically compare lattices
with square and triangular symmetry. To avoid the prevalence of the
conventional plastic mechanisms, we consider the loading paths represented by
pure shears applied on the boundary of the otherwise unloaded body. These
loading protocols can be qualified as exploiting the 'softest' and the
'hardest' directions and we show that the associated dislocation patterns are
strikingly different.

Thermoelectric transport, i.e., charge current driven by a temperature
gradient (Seebeck effect) and heat current driven by an electric current
(Peltier effect), provides fundamental insights on microscopic thermodynamics
and kinetics of materials and enables devices that convert between heat and
electrical work. The ionic Seebeck effect in ionic thermoelectric materials was
reported more than one century ago while the reciprocal phenomenon, the ionic
Peltier effect, remains unexplored due to experimental challenges. This work
reports experimental observations and quantitative measurements of the ionic
Peltier effect by an ultrasensitive temperature difference metrology (UTDM)
with an extremely high temperature difference resolution up to 4 uK. UTDM
enables the probing of sub-mK-level temperature responses of ionic Peltier
effect even in the presence of parasitic Joule heat. We observe high ionic
Peltier coefficients (up to 450 mV) in liquid electrolytes commonly used in
Li-ion batteries. These high Peltier coefficients are approximately one order
of magnitude greater than the Peltier coefficients of well-optimized electronic
thermoelectric materials and comparable to Peltier coefficients of lightly
doped silicon. Our work provides a platform to study the microscopic physics of
ionic Peltier effect and understanding the thermodynamics and kinetics of ion
transport in Li-ion batteries.

As various property studies continue to emerge on high entropy and

across the phase boundary between \enquote{high-entropy} and
\enquote{entropy-stabilized}. The thermal and mechanical properties of bulk
ceramic entropy stabilized oxide composition
Mg$_{0.2}$Co$_{0.2}$Ni$_{0.2}$Cu$_{0.2}$Zn$_{0.2}$O are investigated across
this critical transition temperature via the transient plane-source method,
temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction, and nano-indentation. Thermal
conductivity remains constant within uncertainty across the multi-to-single
phase transition at a value of ~2.5 W/mK, while the linear coefficient of
thermal expansion increases nearly 24 % from 10.8 to 14.1 x 10$^{-6}$ K$^{-1}$.
Mechanical softening is also observed across the transition.

<h3>Helical topological superconductivity in intrinsic quantum Hall  superconductors</h3>

<br>
<i>Jonathan Schirmer, J. K. Jain, C. -X. Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
One of the approaches to engineering topological superconductivity in a two
dimensional electron gas with spin-orbit coupling is to proximity-couple it to
an s-wave type-II superconductor with a non-standard Abrikosov flux lattice
that is neither triangular or square but has an even number of superconducting
flux quanta per unit cell. Here we ask whether exposing an intrinsic
two-dimensional superconductor with spin orbit coupling to a perpendicular
magnetic field -- an intrinsic quantum Hall superconductor -- can give rise to
topological superconductivity. We investigate this question in a mean-field
theory and obtain, in a self-consistent fashion, the real space configuration
of the superconducting order parameter, which encodes information about the
topology of the superconductivity as well as the nature of the Abrikosov
lattice. We find small regions of topological superconductivity in the
parameter space, which can be greatly enlarged by the addition of a
superlattice potential. Topological superconductivity is seen to be correlated
with the presence of either a distorted Abrikosov lattice or an Abrikosov
lattice of giant vortices which carry two superconducting flux quanta. To
identify the lowest energy solution, it is essential to employ helical order
parameters. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of this proposal.

The ground state energy is great importance for studying the properties of a
material. In this study, we computed both the Hartree-Fock approximation and
the random phase approximation of the ground state energy. Considering the
effect of the electrostatic shielding potential, we utilized the Thomas-Fermi
dielectric function to obtain the Thomas-Fermi formula for the total potential
energy. We subsequently calculated the total potential energy of the metallic
and non-metallic elements in the periodic table using Wigner correlation energy
and Hedin-Lundqvist correlation energy, considering the changes in the
correlation energies after considering electrostatic shielding effects.The
exchange correlation potential including electrostatic shielding effect can be
used in the measurement of SIM experiments.

A crystal symmetry search is crucial for computational crystallography and
materials science. Although algorithms and implementations for the crystal
symmetry search have been developed, their extension to magnetic space groups
(MSGs) remains limited. In this paper, algorithms for determining magnetic
symmetry operations of magnetic crystal structures, identifying magnetic
space-group types of given MSGs, and symmetrizing the magnetic crystal
structures using the MSGs are presented. The determination of magnetic symmetry
operations is numerically stable and is implemented with minimal modifications
from the existing crystal symmetry search. Magnetic space-group types are
identified by combining space-group type identification and the use of affine
normalizers. Point coordinates and magnetic moments of the magnetic crystal
structures are symmetrized by projection operators for the MSGs. An

<h3>Towards Relating Fragile-To-Strong Transition to Fragile Glass</h3>

Glass formers are in general classified as strong or fragile depending on
whether their relaxation rates follow Arrhenius or super-Arrhenius temperature
dependence. There are however notable exceptions such as water, which exhibit a
fragile-to-strong (FTS) transition and behave as fragile and strong
respectively at high and low temperatures. In this work, the FTS transition is
studied using a distinguishable-particle lattice model previously demonstrated
to be capable of simulating both strong and fragile glasses [Phys. Rev. Lett.
125, 265703 (2020)]. Starting with a bimodal pair-interaction distribution
appropriate for fragile glasses, we show that by narrowing down the energy
dispersion in the low-energy component of the distribution, a FTS transition is
observed. The transition occurs at a temperature at which the stretching
exponent of the relaxation is minimized, in agreement with previous molecular
dynamics simulations.

<h3>Bulk--Boundary Correspondence and Boundary Zero Modes in a Non-Hermitian  Kitaev Chain Model</h3>

<br>
<i>Tetsuro Sakaguchi, Hiroto Nishijima, Yositake Takane</i>
<br>
<br>
We study a non-Hermitian Kitaev chain model that contains three sources of
non-Hermiticity: a constant imaginary potential, asymmetry between hopping
amplitudes $t_{\rm R}$ and $t_{\rm L}$ in the right and left directions, and
imbalance in pair potentials $\Delta_{\rm c}$ and $\Delta_{\rm a}$ for pair
creation and annihilation, respectively. We show that bulk--boundary
correspondence holds in this system; two topological invariants defined in bulk
geometry under a modified periodic boundary condition correctly describe the
presence or absence of a pair of boundary zero modes in boundary geometry under
an open boundary condition. One topological invariant characterizes a
topologically nontrivial phase with a line gap and the other characterizes that
with a point gap. The latter appears only in the asymmetric hopping case of
$t_{\rm R} \neq t_{\rm L}$. These two nontrivial phases are essentially
equivalent except for their gap structures. Indeed, the boundary zero modes do
not disappear across the boundary between them. We also show that the boundary
zero modes do not satisfy the Majorana condition if $\Delta_{\rm c} \neq
\Delta_{\rm a}$ and/or $t_{\rm R} \neq t_{\rm L}$.

FeO is a crucial phase of the Earth's core, and its thermodynamic properties
are essential to developing more accurate core models. It is also a notorious
correlated insulator in the NaCl-type (B1) phase at ambient conditions. It
undergoes two polymorphic transitions at 300 K before it becomes metallic in
the NiAs-type (B8) structure at $\sim$100 GPa. Although its phase diagram is
not fully mapped, it is well established that the B8 phase transforms to the
CsCl-type (B2) phase at core pressures and temperatures. Here we report a
successful \textit{ab initio} calculation of the B8$\leftrightarrow$B2 phase
boundary in FeO at Earth's core pressures. We show that fully anharmonic free
energies computed with the PBE-GGA + Mermin functional reproduce the
experimental phase boundary within uncertainties at $P > 240$ GPa, including
the largely negative Clapeyron slope of $-52 \pm 5$ MPa/K. This study validates
the applicability of a standard DFT functional to FeO under Earth's core
conditions and demonstrates the theoretical framework that enables complex
predictive studies of this region.

Controlling the connectivity and rigidity of kirigami, i.e. the process of
cutting paper to deploy it into an articulated system, is critical in the
manifestations of kirigami in art, science and technology, as it provides the
resulting metamaterial with a range of mechanical and geometric properties.
Here we combine deterministic and stochastic approaches for the control of
rigidity in kirigami using the power of $k$ choices, an approach borrowed from
the statistical mechanics of explosive percolation transitions. We show that
several methods for rigidifying a kirigami system by incrementally changing
either the connectivity or the rigidity of individual components allow us to
control the nature of the explosive transition by a choice of selection rules.
Our results suggest simple lessons for the design and control of mechanical
metamaterials.

<br>
<br>
The anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) is one of the most intriguing
thermoelectric phenomena which has attracted growing interest both for its
underlying physics and potential applications. Typically, a large ANE response
is observed in magnets with pronounced magnetizations or nontrivial Berry
curvature. Here, we report a significant ANE signal in compensated
ferrimagnetic CoxGd1-x alloy films, which exhibit vanishingly small
magnetization. In particular, we found that the polarity of ANE signal is
dominated by the magnetization orientation of the transition metal Co
sublattices, rather than the net magnetization of CoxGd1-x films. This
observation is not expected from the conventional understanding of ANE but is
analogous to the anomalous Hall effect in compensated ferrimagnets. We
attribute the origin of ANE and its Co-dominant property to the Co-dominant
Berry curvature. Our work could trigger a more comprehensive understanding of
ANE and may be useful for building energy-harvesting devices by employing ANE
in compensated ferrimagnets.

We performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with micro-focused
beam on a topological line-nodal compound CaSb2 which undergoes a
superconducting transition at the onset Tc~1.8 K, to clarify the Fermi-surface
topology relevant to the occurrence of superconductivity. We found that a
three-dimensional hole pocket at the G point is commonly seen for two types of
single-crystalline samples fabricated by different growth conditions. On the
other hand, the carrier-doping level estimated from the position of the
chemical potential was found to be sensitive to the sample fabrication
condition. The cylindrical electron pocket at the Y(C) point predicted by the
calculations is absent in one of the two samples, despite the fact that both
samples commonly show superconductivity with similar Ts's. This suggests a key
role of the three-dimensional hole pocket to the occurrence of
superconductivity, and further points to an intriguing possibility to control
the topological nature of superconductivity by carrier tuning in CaSb2.

<br>
<br>
The existing proposals for superfluid-like spin transport have been based on
easy-plane magnets where the U(1) spin-rotational symmetry is spontaneously
broken in equilibrium, and this has been limiting material choices for
realizing superfluid-like spin transport to restricted class of magnets. In
this work, we lift this limitation by showing that superfluid-like spin
transport can also be realized based on easy-axis magnets, where the U(1)
spin-rotational symmetry is intact in equilibrium but can be broken in
non-equilibrium. Specifically, we find the condition to engender a
non-equilibrium easy-cone state by applying a spin torque to easy-axis magnets,
which dynamically induces the spontaneous breaking of the U(1) spin-rotational
symmetry and thereby can support superfluid-like spin transport. By exploiting
this dynamic easy-cone state, we show theoretically that superfluid-like spin
transport can be achieved in easy-axis magnets under suitable conditions and
confirmed the prediction by micromagnetic simulations. We envision that our
work broadens material library for realizing superfluid-like spin transport,
showing the potential utility of dynamic states of magnets as venue to look for
spin-transport phenomena that do not occur in static magnetic backgrounds.

<br>
The recent discovery of superconductivity (SC) and charge density wave (CDW)
in kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) provides an ideal playground for the
study of emergent electronic orders. Application of moderate pressure leads to
a two-dome-shaped SC phase regime in CsV3Sb5 accompanied by the destabilizing
of CDW phase; such unconventional evolution of SC may involve the
pressure-induced formation of a new stripe-like CDW order resembling that in
La-214 cuprate superconductors. Nonetheless, the nature of this pressure-tuned
SC state and its interplay with the stripe order are yet to be explored. Here,
we perform soft point-contact spectroscopy (SPCS) measurements in CsV3Sb5 to
investigate the evolution of superconducting order parameter with pressure.
Surprisingly, we find that the superconducting gap is significantly enhanced
between the two SC domes, at which the zero-resistance temperature is
suppressed and the transition is remarkably broadened. Moreover, the
temperature dependence of the SC gap in this pressure range severely deviates
from the conventional BCS behavior, evidencing for strong Cooper pair phase
fluctuations. These findings reveal the complex intertwining of the stripe-like
CDW with SC in the compressed CsV3Sb5, suggesting striking parallel to the
cuprate superconductor La2-xBaxCuO4. Our results point to the essential role of
charge degree of freedom in the development of intertwining electronic orders,
thus provides new constraints for theories.

We report on the theoretical derivation of macroscopic thermal properties
(specific heat, thermal conductivity) of an electrically insulating rod
connected to two reservoirs, from the linear superposition of its mechanical
mode Brownian motions. The calculation is performed for a weak thermal
gradient, in the classical limit (high temperature). The development is kept
basic as far as geometry and experimental conditions are concerned, enabling an
almost fully analytic treatment. In the modeling, each of the modes is subject
to a specific Langevin force, which enables to produce the required temperature
profile along the rod. The theory is predictive: the temperature gradient (and
therefore energy transport) is linked to motion amplitude cross-correlations
between nearby mechanical modes. This arises because energy transport is
actually mediated by mixing between the modal waves, and not by the modes
themselves. This result can be tested on experiments, and shall extend the
concepts underlying equipartition and fluctuation-dissipation theorems. The
theory links intimately the macroscopic size of the clamping region where the
mixing occurs to the microscopic lengthscale of the problem at hand: the phonon
mean-free-path. We believe that our work should impact the domain of thermal
transport in nanostructures, with future developments of the theory toward the
quantum regime.

Femtosecond laser-induced photoexcitation of ferromagnet (FM)/heavy metal
(HM) heterostructures have attracted attention by emitting broadband terahertz
frequencies. The phenomenon relies on the formation of ultrafast spin current,
which is largely attributed to the direct photoexcitation of the FM layer.
However, we reveal that during the process, the FM layer also experiences a
secondary excitation led by the hot electrons from the HM layer that travel
across the FM/HM interface and transfer additional energy in the FM. Thus, the
generated secondary spins enhance the total spin current formation and lead to
amplified spintronic terahertz emission. The results also emphasize the
significance of the secondary spin current, which even exceeds the primary spin
currents when FM/HM heterostructures with thicker HM are used. An analytical
model is developed to provide deeper insights into the microscopic processes
within the individual layers, underlining the generalized ultrafast
superdiffusive spin-transport mechanism.

reminiscent of a dipolar spin ice. This is strikingly different from previous
neutron diffraction on powder samples grown from solid-state synthesis, which
found diffuse scattering at high scattering vectors associated with magnetic
octupoles. This raises the question about subtle crystalline structural
differences and in particular the potential role of disorder that is present in
the different samples. We quantify any differences through complementary
neutron structure refinement and atomic PDF measurements but detect no
oxidation or other crystallographic disorder in the hydrothermally-grown
samples. To interpret the new diffuse scattering, we characterize the exchange
interaction parameters in the near-neighbor XYZ model Hamiltonian associated
with DO pyrochlores by fitting quantum numerical linked cluster expansions
(NLCE) to heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility measurements, and classical
Monte Carlo calculations to the diffuse neutron diffraction of the newly
synthesized Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ samples. This places Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$'s ground
state within the ordered dipolar all-in-all-out (AIAO) N\'{e}el phase with
quantum Monte-Carlo calculations showing a transition to long-range order at
temperatures below those accessed experimentally. We conclude that new
hydrothermally-grown Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ samples host a finite-temperature
proximate dipolar spin ice phase, above the expected transition to AIAO
N\'{e}el order.

Identifying dynamical signatures of excited state quantum phase transitions
(ESQPTs) in experimentally realizable quantum many-body systems is helpful for
understanding the dynamical effects of ESQPTs. In such systems, the highly
controllable spinor Bose-Einstein condenstes (BECs) offer an exceptional
platform to study ESQPTs. In this work, we investigate the dynamical
characteristics of the ESQPT in spin-$1$ BEC by means of the Loschmidt echo
spectrum. The Loschmidt echo spectrum is an extension of the well-known
Loschmidt echo and definded as the overlaps between the evolved state and the
excited states of the initial Hamiltonian. We show that both the time evolved
and long time averaged Loschmidt echo spectrum undergo a remarkable change as
the system passes through the critical point of the ESQPT. Moreover, the
particular behavior exhibited by the Loschmidt echo spectrum at the critical
point stand as a dynamical detector for probing the ESQPT. We further
demonstrate how to capture the features of the ESQPT by using the energy
distribution associated with the Loschmidt echo spectrum for time evolved and
long time averaged cases, respectrively.
Our findings contribute to a further verification of the usefulness of the
Loschmidt echo spectrum
for witnessing various quantum phase transitions in many-body systems and
provide a new way to experimentally examine the dynamical consequences of
ESQPTs.

Linear spin wave theory (LSWT) is the standard technique to compute the
spectra of magnetic excitations in quantum materials. In this paper, we show
that LSWT, even under ordinary circumstances, may fail to implement the
symmetries of the underlying ordered magnetic Hamiltonian leading to spurious
degeneracies. In common with pseudo-Goldstone modes in cases of quantum
order-by-disorder these degeneracies tend to be lifted by magnon-magnon
interactions. We show how, instead, the correct symmetries may be restored at
the level of LSWT. In the process we give examples, supported by
nonperturbative matrix product based time evolution calculations, where
symmetries dictate that there should be a topological magnon gap but where LSWT
fails to open up this gap. We also comment on possible spin split magnons in
MnF$_2$ and similar rutiles by analogy to recently proposed altermagnets.

Crystalline interfaces are of highly importance in many practical
applications. To conduct effective simulation and analysis for coincident site
lattice (CSL) interfaces, effective programmes are of high demand in building
their CSL bicrystal models to apply periodic boundary condition. The existing
reported programmes capable suffer from problems including limitation of
available lattice, poor capability for making heterogeneous interfaces and
requirement of none-intuitive input parameters which cannot be directly
obtained from an experimental observation result for an interface. This work
presents a python programme to construct bicrystal model of interfaces
consisting of any two lattices, including tilt, twist, mixed, and hetero
interfaces and surfaces, which will support in effective simulation and
analysis of crystalline interfaces.

<h3>A Comprehensive Model of Nitrogen-Free Ordered Carbon Quantum Dots</h3>

<br>
<br>
We propose and demonstrate a novel range of models to accurately determine
the optical properties of nitrogen-free carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with ordered
graphene layered structures. We confirm the results of our models against the
full range of experimental results for CQDs available from an extensive review
of the literature. The models can be equally applied to CQDs with varied sizes
and with different oxygen content in the basal planes of the constituent
graphenic sheets. We demonstrate that the experimentally observed blue
fluorescent emission of nitrogen-free CQDs can be associated with either small
oxidised areas on the periphery of the graphenic sheets, or with sub-nanometre
non-functionalised islands of sp2-hybridised carbon with high symmetry confined
in the centres of oxidised graphene sheets. Larger and/or less symmetric
non-functionalised regions in the centre of functionalised graphene sheet are
found to be sources of green and even red fluorescent emission from
nitrogen-free CQDs. We also demonstrate an approach to simplify the modelling
of the discussed sp2-islands by substitution with equivalent strained
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Additionally, we show that the bandgaps (and
photoluminescence) of CQDs are not dependent on either out-of-plane corrugation
of the graphene sheet or the spacing between sp2-islands. Advantageously, our
proposed models show that there is no need to involve light-emitting polycyclic
aromatic molecules (nanographenes) with arbitrary structures grafted to the
particle periphery to explain the plethora of optical phenomena observed for
CQDs across the full range of experimental works.

<h3>Moiré Magnetic Exchange Interactions in Twisted Magnets</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Besides moir\'e superlattice, twisting can also generate moir\'e magnetic
exchange interactions (MMEIs) in van der Waals magnets. However, due to the
extreme complexity and twist-angle-dependent sensitivity, all existing models
fail to capture the MMEIs, preventing the understanding of MMEIs-induced new
physics. Here, we develop a microscopic moir\'e spin Hamiltonian that enables
the effective description of MMEIs via a sliding-mapping approach in twisted
magnets, as demonstrated in twisted bilayer CrI3. Unexpectedly, we discover
that the emergence of MMEIs can create an unprecedented magnetic skyrmion
bubble (SkB) with non-conversed helicity, named as moir\'e-type SkB,
representing a unique spin texture solely generated by MMEIs and ready to be
detected under the current experimental conditions. Importantly, the size and
population of SkBs can be finely controlled by twist angle, a key step for
skyrmion-based quantum computing and information storage. Furthermore, we
reveal that the MMEIs can be effectively manipulated by the substrate-induced
interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, modulating the
twist-angle-dependent magnetic phase diagram, which solves the outstanding
disagreements between prior theories and experiments and verifies our theory.

<h3>Orbital-selective Mott phase and spin nematicity in Ni-substituted  FeTe$_{0.65}$Se$_{0.35}$ single crystals</h3>

<br>
<br>
The normal state in iron chalcogenides is metallic but highly unusual, with
orbital and spin degrees of freedom partially itinerant or localized depending
on temperature, leading to many unusual features. In this work, we report on
the observations of two of such features, the orbital selective Mott phase
(OSMP) and spin nematicity, evidenced in magnetization and magnetotransport
[resistivity, Hall effect, angular magnetoresistance (AMR)] of Ni-substituted
FeTe$_{0.65}$Se$_{0.35}$ single crystals. Two series of single crystals
Fe$_{1+{\delta}-y}$Ni$_y$Te$_{0.65}$Se$_{0.35}$ were prepared, with $0 < y <
0.2$, and $\delta$ either positive (S crystals) or negative (F crystals),
depending on the crystallization rate. The S crystals, with single, tetragonal
phase exhibit superconducting (SC) properties inferior to F crystals, which
contain Fe vacancy-rich monoclinic inclusions. Substitution of Ni dopes both
types of crystals with electrons, what eliminates some of the hole pockets from
Fermi level, leaving only one, originating from $d_{xy}$ orbital. We show that
electron-dominated transport, observed at low $T$ at large $y$, is replaced by
hole-dominated transport at $T > 180$ K, suggesting direct link with the
appearance of the $d_{z^2}$ hole pockets at X points of the Brillouin zone in
the OSMP phase, as recently reported by angular resolved photoemission
experiments (Commun. Phys. 5, 29 (2022)). The AMR of S crystals shows the $C_4$
rotational symmetry of in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy at small $y$,
replaced by $C_2$ symmetry at intermediate $y$, indicating development of Ni
doping-induced spin nematicity. The $C_4$ symmetry is preserved in F crystals
due to microstructural disorder related to vacancy-rich inclusions. The
tendency towards nematicity, induced by Ni doping, appears to be the most
important factor producing inferior superconducting properties of S crystals.

<h3>Expansion and correlation dynamics of interacting bosons released from a  harmonic trap</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15190" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15190</a>
<br>
<i>Rhombik Roy, Barnali Chakrabarti, Arnaldo Gammal</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the expansion dynamics of one-dimensional strongly interacting
bosons released from a harmonic trap from the first principle. We utilize the
multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB) to solve
the many-body Schr\"odinger equation at high level of accuracy as the MCTDHB
basis sets are explicitly time dependent and optimised by variational
principle. We probe the expansion dynamics for very strong interaction but not
in Tonks-Girardeau (TG) limit and thus integrability breaks down. We
characterize the dynamics by measure of expansion radius and expansion
velocity. We find that for an wide range of strong interaction strength, the
expansion dynamics is trimodal. We present three different time-scales of
expansion -- inner-core, outer-core and the whole cloud; whereas for
non-interacting case, it is unimodal. We also report the dynamics of
higher-body densities and correlations and observe the antibunching effect. The
two- and three-body densities are characterized by the appearance of
correlation hole along the diagonal due to very strong interaction that mimics
the Pauli principle. With the expansion of bosons the correlation hole also
spread. We also report the expansion dynamics of 1D dipolar bosons released
from the trap. When very strong contact interaction leads to fermionization
limit, for strongly interacting dipolar bosons lead to crystal phase. The
expansion dynamics of dipolar bosons is again trimodal as before, but the
expansion velocity is much larger and diverging unlike the case of contact
interaction where the expansion velocity is converged. The diverging expansion
dynamics is further supported by the unbounded energy for long range
interaction.

Spherical nanoclusters and nanoparticles are rising materials whose
functional design provides many useful applications ranging from catalysis,
molecular sensing, gas storage to drug targeting and delivery. Here, we develop
phenomenological crystallization theory of such spherical structures with
octahedral symmetries O and O_h. Within the developed theory, we propose a
method, which is based on constructing irreducible octahedral density functions
and allows to predict the positions of structural units in the spherical
nanoobjects. The proposed theory explains the structures of the simplest known
metal nanoclusters, some metal-organic polyhedra and membrane protein
polyhedral nanoparticles, and also predicts more complex chiral spherical
structures and achiral assemblies characterized by the geometry of semiregular
polyhedra. A relationship between the constructed irreducible octahedral
functions and spherical lattices, obtained by mapping a plane hexagonal order
onto a spherical surface through an octahedron net, is discussed as well.

<br>
<br>
The embrittlement of metallic alloys by liquid metals leads to catastrophic
material failure and severely impacts their structural integrity. The weakening
of grain boundaries by the ingress of liquid metal and preceding segregation in
the solid are thought to promote early fracture. However, the potential of
balancing between the segregation of cohesion-enhancing interstitial solutes
and embrittling elements inducing grain boundary decohesion is not understood.
Here, we unveil the mechanisms of how boron segregation mitigates the
detrimental effects of the prime embrittler, zinc, in a $\Sigma 5\,[0\,0\,1]$
tilt grain boundary in $\alpha-$Fe ($4~at.\%$ Al). Zinc forms nanoscale
segregation patterns inducing structurally and compositionally complex grain
boundary states. Ab-initio simulations reveal that boron hinders zinc
segregation and compensates for the zinc induced loss in grain boundary
cohesion. Our work sheds new light on how interstitial solutes intimately
modify grain boundaries, thereby opening pathways to use them as dopants for
preventing disastrous material failure.

We study the breakup of a liquid thread inside another liquid at different
surface tensions. In general, the pinch-off of a liquid thread is governed by
the dynamics of fluid flow. However, when the interfacial tension is ultralow
(2 to 3 orders lower than normal liquids), we find that the pinch-off dynamics
can be governed by bulk diffusion. By studying the velocity and the profile of
the pinch-off, we explain why the diffusion-dominated pinch-off takes over the
conventional breakup at ultralow surface tensions.

<h3>Hyperchaos, intermittency, noise and disorder in modified semiconductor  superlattices</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Weakly coupled semiconductor superlattices under dc voltage bias are
nonlinear systems with many degrees of freedom whose nonlinearity is due to
sequential tunneling of electrons. They may exhibit spontaneous chaos at room
temperature and act as fast physical random number generator devices. Here we
present a general sequential transport model with different voltage drops at
quantum wells and barriers that includes noise and fluctuations due to the
superlattice epitaxial growth. Excitability and oscillations of the current in
superlattices with identical periods are due to nucleation and motion of charge
dipole waves that form at the emitter contact when the current drops below a
critical value. Insertion of wider wells increases superlattice excitability by
allowing wave nucleation at the modified wells and more complex dynamics. Then
hyperchaos and different types of intermittent chaos are possible on extended
dc voltage ranges. Intrinsic shot and thermal noises and external noises
produce minor effects on chaotic attractors. However, random disorder due to
growth fluctuations may suppress any regular or chaotic current oscillations.
Numerical simulations show that more than 70\% of samples remain chaotic when
the standard deviation of their fluctuations due to epitaxial growth is below
0.024 nm (10\% of a single monolayer) whereas for 0.015 nm disorder suppresses
chaos.

Machine learning with neural networks is now becoming a more and more
powerful tool for various tasks, such as natural language processing, image
recognition, winning the game, and even for the issues of physics. Although
there are many studies on the application of machine learning to numerical
calculation and the assistance of experimental detection, the methods of
applying machine learning to find the analytical method are poorly studied. In
this letter, we propose methods to use machine learning to find the analytical
methods. We demonstrate that the recurrent neural networks can ``derive'' the
Floquet-Magnus expansion just by inputting the time-periodic Hamiltonian to the
neural networks, and derive the appropriate rotating frame in the
periodically-driven system. We also argue that this method is also applicable
to finding other theoretical frameworks in other systems.

<br>
Among condensed matter systems, Mott insulators exhibit diverse properties
that emerge from electronic correlations. In itinerant metals, correlations are
usually weak, but can also be enhanced via geometrical confinement of
electrons, that manifest as `flat' dispersionless electronic bands. In the fast
developing field of topological materials, which includes Dirac and Weyl
semimetals, flat bands are one of the important components that can result in
unusual magnetic and transport behaviour. To date, characterisation of flat
bands and their magnetism is scarce, hindering the design of novel materials.
Here, we investigate the ferromagnetic Kagom\'{e} semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$
using resonant inelastic X-ray scattering. Remarkably, nearly non-dispersive
Stoner spin excitation peaks are observed, sharply contrasting with the
featureless Stoner continuum expected in conventional ferromagnetic metals. Our
band structure and dynamic spin susceptibility calculations, and thermal
evolution of the excitations, confirm the nearly non-dispersive Stoner
excitations as unique signatures of correlations and spin-polarized electronic
flat bands in Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$. These observations serve as a cornerstone for
further exploration of band-induced symmetry-breaking orders in topological
materials.

Tunnel spectroscopy data for the detection of Majorana bound states (MBS) is
often criticized for its proneness to misinterpretation of genuine MBS with
low-lying Andreev bound states. Here, we suggest a protocol removing this
ambiguity by extending single shot measurements to sequences performed at
varying system parameters. We demonstrate how such sampling, which we argue
requires only moderate effort for current experimental platforms, resolves the
statistics of Andreev side lobes, thus providing compelling evidence for the
presence or absence of a Majorana center peak.

The unified form of longitudinal optical conductivities (LOCs) for tilted
Weyl fermions in arbitrary spatial dimensionality is analytically calculated
and expressed in terms of the joint density of state. The results are valid for
both undoped and doped cases, both parallel and perpendicular components with
respect to the tilting direction, and all the tilted phases. In addition, they
automatically reproduce the analytical results of previous works for
one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional tilted Weyl systems.
Our work provides not only a once-for-all method prior to the one-by-one
calculation of LOCs but also deep insights into the impacts of spatial
dimensionality in the tilted Weyl fermions.

Stochastic systems that undergo random restarts to their initial state have
been widely investigated in recent years, both theoretically and in
experiments. Oftentimes, however, resetting to a fixed state is impossible due
to thermal noise or other limitations. As a result, the system configuration
after a resetting event is random. Here, we consider such a resetting protocol
for an overdamped Brownian particle in a confining potential $V(x)$. We assume
that the position of the particle is reset at a constant rate to a random
location $x$, drawn from a distribution $p_R(x)$. To investigate the
thermodynamic cost of resetting, we study the stochastic entropy production
$S_{\rm Total}$. We derive a general expression for the average entropy
production for any $V(x)$, and the full distribution $P(S_{\rm Total}|t)$ of
the entropy production for $V(x)=0$. At late times, we show that this
distribution assumes the large-deviation form $P(S_{\rm Total}|t)\sim
\exp\left[-t^{2\alpha-1}\phi\left(\left(S_{\rm Total}-\langle S_{\rm
Total}\rangle\right)/t^{\alpha}\right)\right]$, with $1/2<\alpha\leq 1$. We
compute the rate function $\phi(z)$ and the exponent $\alpha$ for exponential
and Gaussian resetting distributions. In the latter case, we find the anomalous
exponent $\alpha=2/3$ and show that $\phi(z)$ has a first-order singularity at
a critical value of $z$, corresponding to a real-space condensation transition.

Distinct from the phononic valley pseudo-spin, the real physical spin of
elastic waves adds a novel tool-kit capable of envisaging the valley-spin
physics of topological valley phononic crystals from a local viewpoint. Here,
we report the observation of local elastic valley spin as well as the hidden
elastic spin-valley locking mechanism overlooked before. We demonstrate that
the selective one-way routing of valley phonon states along the topological
interface can be reversed by imposing the elastic spin meta-source at different
interface locations with opposite valley-spin correspondence. We unveil the
physical mechanism of selective directionality as the elastic spin controlled
chiral coupling of valley phonon states, through both analytical theory and
experimental measurement of the opposite local elastic spin density at
different interface locations for different transport directions. The elastic
spin of valley topological edge phonons can be extended to other topological
states and offers new tool to explore topological metamaterials.

<h3>Flat bands in Network Superstructures of Atomic Chains</h3>

We investigate the origin of the ubiquitous existence of flat bands in the
network superstructures of atomic chains, where one-dimensional(1D) atomic
chains array periodically. While there can be many ways to connect those
chains, we consider two representative ways of linking them, the dot-type and
triangle-type links. Then, we construct a variety of superstructures, such as
the square, rectangular, and honeycomb network superstructures with dot-type
links and the honeycomb superstructure with triangle-type links. These links
provide the wavefunctions with an opportunity to have destructive interference,
which stabilizes the compact localized state(CLS). The CLS is a localized
eigenstate whose amplitudes are finite only inside a finite region and
guarantees the existence of a flat band. In the network superstructures, there
exist multiple flat bands proportional to the number of atoms of each chain,
and the corresponding eigenenergies can be found from the stability condition
of the compact localized state. Finally, we demonstrate that the finite
bandwidth of the nearly flat bands of the network superstructures arising from
the next-nearest-neighbor hopping processes can be suppressed by increasing the
length of the chains consisting of the superstructures.

Novel nanoscale probes are opening new venues for understanding
unconventional electronic and magnetic functionalities driven by multiscale
lattice complexity in doped high temperature superconducting perovskites. In
this work we focus on the multiscale texture at supramolecular level of atomic
oxygen interstitials (O-i) stripes in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$ at optimal doping for
the highest superconducting critical temperature $T_C$=94K. We report
compelling evidence for the nematic phase of oxygen-interstitial O-i atomic
wires with fractal-like spatial distribution over multiple scales by using
scanning micro and nano X-ray-diffraction. The scale free distribution of O-i
atomic wires at optimum doping extending from micron scale down to nanoscale
has been associated with the intricate filamentary network of hole rich
metallic wires in the CuO$_2$ plane. The observed critical opalescence provides
evidence for the proximity to a critical point controlling the emergence of
high temperature superconductivity at optimum doping

Organic semiconductors are promising materials for cheap, scalable and
sustainable electronics, light-emitting diodes and photovoltaics. For organic
photovoltaic cells, it is a challenge to find compounds with suitable
properties in the vast chemical compound space. For example, the ionization
energy should fit to the optical spectrum of sun light, and the energy levels
must allow efficient charge transport. Here, a machine-learning model is
developed for rapidly and accurately estimating the HOMO and LUMO energies of a
given molecular structure. It is build upon the SchNet model (Sch\"utt et al.
(2018)) and augmented with a `Set2Set' readout module (Vinyals et al. (2016)).
The Set2Set module has more expressive power than sum and average aggregation
and is more suitable for the complex quantities under consideration. Most
previous models have been trained and evaluated on rather small molecules.
Therefore, the second contribution is extending the scope of machine-learning
methods by adding also larger molecules from other sources and establishing a
consistent train/validation/test split. As a third contribution, we make a
multitask ansatz to resolve the problem of different sources coming at
different levels of theory. All three contributions in conjunction bring the
accuracy of the model close to chemical accuracy.

Supervised learning with deep models has tremendous potential for
applications in materials science. Recently, graph neural networks have been
used in this context, drawing direct inspiration from models for molecules.
However, materials are typically much more structured than molecules, which is
a feature that these models do not leverage. In this work, we introduce a class
of models that are equivariant with respect to crystalline symmetry groups. We
do this by defining a generalization of the message passing operations that can
be used with more general permutation groups, or that can alternatively be seen
as defining an expressive convolution operation on the crystal graph.
Empirically, these models achieve competitive results with state-of-the-art on
property prediction tasks.

Material identification is critical for understanding the relationship
between mechanical properties and the associated mechanical functions. However,
material identification is a challenging task, especially when the
characteristic of the material is highly nonlinear in nature, as is common in
biological tissue. In this work, we identify unknown material properties in
continuum solid mechanics via physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To
improve the accuracy and efficiency of PINNs, we developed efficient strategies
to nonuniformly sample observational data. We also investigated different
approaches to enforce Dirichlet boundary conditions as soft or hard
constraints. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to a diverse set of
time-dependent and time-independent solid mechanic examples that span linear
elastic and hyperelastic material space. The estimated material parameters
achieve relative errors of less than 1%. As such, this work is relevant to
diverse applications, including optimizing structural integrity and developing
novel materials.

We investigate the topological properties of a Josephson junction obtained by
constraining a two-dimensional electron gas at oxide interface to form a
quasi-1D conductor. We reveal an anomalous critical current behaviour with a
magnetic field applied perpendicular to the Rashba spin-orbit one. We relate
the observed critical current enhancement at small magnetic fields with a
non-trivial topology, accompanied by Majorana bound states (MBSs) pinned at the
edges of the superconducting leads. Signatures of MBSs also include a sawtooth
profile in the current-phase relation. Our findings allow to recognize
fingerprints of topological superconductivity in non-centrosymmetric materials
and confined systems with Rashba spin-orbit interaction, and to explain recent
experimental observations for which a microscopic description is still lacking.

We consider the quench dynamics of non-interacting fermions in one dimension
in the presence of a finite-size impurity at the origin. This impurity is
characterized by general momentum-dependent reflection and transmission
coefficients which are changed from ${\sf r}_0(k), {\sf t}_0(k)$ to ${\sf
r}(k), {\sf t}(k)$ at time $t=0$. The initial state is at equilibrium with
${\sf t}_0(k)=0$ such that the system is cut in two independent halves with
${\sf r}_0^R(k)$, ${\sf r}_0^L(k)$ respectively to the right and to the left of
the impurity. We obtain the exact large time limit of the multi-time
correlations. These correlations become time translationally invariant, and are
non-zero in two different regimes: (i) for $x=O(1)$ where the system reaches a
non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) (ii) for $x \sim t$, i.e., the ray-regime.
For a repulsive impurity these correlations are independent of ${\sf
r}_0^R(k)$, ${\sf r}_0^L(k)$, while in the presence of bound states they
oscillate and memory effects persist. We show that these nontrivial
relaxational properties can be retrieved in a simple manner from the large time
behaviour of the single particle wave functions.

<h3>How nanoporous silicon-polypyrrole hybrids flex their muscles in aqueous  electrolytes: In operando high-resolution x-ray diffraction and electron  tomography-based micromechanical computer simulations</h3>

Macroscopic strain experiments revealed that Si crystals traversed by
parallel, channel-like nanopores functionalized with the muscle polymer
polypyrrole exhibit large and reversible electrochemo-mechanical actuation in
aqueous electrolytes. On the microscopical level this system still bears open
questions, as to how the electrochemical expansion and contraction of PPy acts
on to np-Si pore walls and how the collective motorics of the pore array
emerges from the single-nanopore behavior. An analysis of in operando X-ray
diffraction experiments with micromechanical finite element simulations, based
on a 3D reconstruction of the nanoporous medium by TEM tomography, shows that
the in-plane mechanical response is dominantly isotropic despite the
anisotropic elasticity of the single crystalline host matrix. However, the
structural anisotropy originating from the parallel alignment of the nanopores
lead to significant differences between the in- and out-of-plane
electromechanical response. This response is not describable by a simple 2D
arrangement of parallel cylindrical channels. Rather, the simulations highlight
that the dendritic shape of the Si pore walls, including pore connections
between the main channels, cause complex, inhomogeneous stress-strain fields in
the crystalline host. Time-dependent X-ray scattering on the dynamics of the
actuator properties hint towards the importance of diffusion limitations,
plastic deformation and creep in the nanoconfined polymer upon (counter-)ion
adsorption and desorption, the very pore-scale processes causing the
macroscopic electroactuation. From a more general perspective, our study
demonstrates that the combination of TEM tomography-based micromechanical
modeling with high-resolution X-ray scattering experiments provides a powerful
approach for in operando analysis of nanoporous composites from the
single-nanopore up to the porous-medium scale.

<h3>Synchronization transition of the second-order Kuramoto model on  lattices</h3>

<br>
<br>
The second-order Kuramoto equation describes synchronization of coupled
oscillators with inertia, which occur in power grids for example. Contrary to
the first-order Kuramoto equation it's synchronization transition behavior is
much less known. In case of Gaussian self-frequencies it is discontinuous, in
contrast to the continuous transition for the first-order Kuramoto equation.
Here we investigate this transition on large 2d and 3d lattices and provide
numerical evidence of hybrid phase transitions, that the oscillator phases
$\theta_i$, exhibit a crossover, while the frequency spread a real phase
transition in 3d. Thus a lower critical dimension $d_l^O=2$ is expected for the
frequencies and $d_l^R=4$ for the phases like in the massless case. We provide
numerical estimates for the critical exponents, finding that the frequency
spread decays as $\sim t^{-d/2}$ in case of aligned initial state of the phases
in agreement with the linear approximation. However in 3d, in the case of
initially random distribution of $\theta_i$, we find a faster decay,
characterized by $\sim t^{-1.8(1)}$ as the consequence of enhanced
nonlinearities which appear by the random phase fluctuations.

<h3>Intrinsic anomalous Hall effect across the magnetic phase transition of  a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study theoretically the zero temperature intrinsic anomalous Hall effect
in an experimentally realized 2D spin-orbit coupled Bose gas. For anisotropic
atomic interactions and as the spin-orbit coupling strength increases, the
system undergoes a ground state phase transition from states exhibiting a total
in-plane magnetization to those with a perpendicular magnetization along the
$z$ direction. We show that finite frequency, or ac, Hall responses exist in
both phases in the absence of an artificial magnetic field, as a result of
finite inter-band transitions. However, the characteristics of the anomalous
Hall responses are drastically different in these two phases because of the
different symmetries preserved by the corresponding ground states. In
particular, we find a finite dc Hall conductivity in one phase but not the
other. The underlying physical reasons for this are analyzed further by
exploring relations of the dc Hall conductivity to the system's chirality and
Berry curvatures of the Bloch bands. Finally, we discuss an experimental method
of probing the anomalous Hall effect in trapped systems.

<br>
<br>
The electrochemical growth of Au nanowires in a template of nano-porous
anodic aluminum oxide was investigated in situ by means of grazing-incidence
transmission small- and wide-angle x-ray scattering (GTSAXS and GTWAXS), x-ray
fluorescence (XRF) and 2-dimensional surface optical reflectance (2D-SOR). The
XRF and the overall intensity of the GTWAXS patterns as a function of time were
used to monitor the progress of the electrodeposition. Furthermore, we
extracted powder diffraction patterns in the direction of growth and in the
direction of confinement to follow the evolution of the direction-dependent
strain. Quite rapidly after the beginning of the electrodeposition, the strain
became tensile in the vertical direction and compressive in the horizontal
direction, which showed that the lattice deformation of the nanostructures can
be artificially varied by an appropriate choice of the deposition time. By
alternating sequences of electrodeposition to sequences of rest, we observed
fluctuations of the lattice parameter in the direction of growth, attributed to
stress caused by electromigration.. Furthermore, the porous domain size
calculated from the GTSAXS patterns was used to monitor how homogeneously the
pores were filled.

<h3>Magnetic interactions and possible structural distortion in kagome FeGe  from first-principles study and symmetry analysis</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15545" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15545</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Based on density functional theory and symmetry analysis, we present a
comprehensive investigation of electronic structure, magnetic properties and
possible structural distortion of magnetic kagome metal FeGe. We estimate the
magnetic parameters including Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)
interactions, and find that the ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor $J_{1}$
dominates over the others, while the magnetic interactions between nearest
kagome layers favors antiferromagnetic. The N\'{e}el temperature $T_{N}$ and
Curie-Weiss temperature $\theta _{CW}$ are successfully reproduced, and the
calculated magnetic anisotropy energy is also in consistent with the
experiment. However, these reasonable Heisenberg interactions and magnetic
anisotropy cannot explain the double cone magnetic transition, and the DM
interactions, which even exist in the centrosymmetric materials, can result in
this small magnetic cone angle. Unfortunately, due to the crystal symmetry of
the high-temperature structure, the net contribution of DM interactions to
double cone magnetic structure is absent. Based on the experimental $2\times
2\times 2$ supercell, we thus explore the subgroups of the parent phase. Group
theoretical analysis reveals that there are 68 different distortions, and only
four of them (space group $P622$ or $P6_{3}22$) without inversion and mirror
symmetry thus can explain the low-temperature magnetic structure. Furthermore,
we suggest that these four proposed CDW phases can be identified by using Raman
spectroscopy. Since DM interactions are very sensitive to small atomic
displacements and symmetry restrictions, we believe that symmetry analysis is
an effective method to reveal the interplay of delicate structural distortions
and complex magnetic configurations.

<br>
<br>
We present the results of a muon-spin relaxation ($\mu^{+}$SR) investigation
of the crystalline organic radical compound
4-(2-benzimidazolyl)-1,2,3,5-dithiadiazolyl (HbimDTDA), in which we demonstrate
the hysteretic magnetic switching of the system that takes place at $T = 274
\pm 11\,\mathrm{K}$ caused by a structural phase transition. Muon-site analysis
using electronic structure calculations suggests a range of candidate muon
stopping sites. The sites are numerous and similar in energy but,
significantly, differ between the two structural phases of the material.
Despite the difference in the sites, the muon remains a faithful probe of the
transition, revealing a dynamically-fluctuating magnetically disordered state
in the low-temperature structural phase. In contrast, in the high temperature
phase the relaxation is caused by static nuclear moments, with rapid electronic
dynamics being motionally narrowed from the muon spectra.

<h3>Insulating band gaps both below and above the Néel temperature in  d-electron LaTiO3, SrMnO3, and LaMnO3 perovskites as a symmetry-breaking  event</h3>

Compounds having an odd number of electrons with the same orbital character
in occupied and unoccupied band edge states would be expected to have band
degeneracy at the Fermi energy, making such reference system metals. Yet, many
ABO3 oxide perovskites with a magnetic 3d B-atom are, in fact, insulators both
below and above the Neel temperature. These inconsistencies between
experimental observation and expectation have been traditionally resolved by
invoking degeneracy-breaking physics based largely on high-order electron
effects, such as strong interelectronic correlation (the Mott mechanism). Such
explanations generally utilize the highest symmetry structure, considering
microscopic degrees of freedom (m-DOF) as largely passive spectators. Yet, it
has long been known that ABO3 perovskites can manifest an arrangement of m-DOFs
in the form of octahedral tilting, bond dimerization, Jahn-Teller distortions,
and ordering of local magnetic moments as part of the stabilizing intrinsic
symmetry. Such m-DOFs are seen both by local experimental probes and
theoretically in total energy minimization of its Born-Oppenheimer state. While
such local structural and magnetic symmetry breaking motifs were often
considered to be the reason for gapping of the reference system below the
transition into Para phases, it was also often thought that above the
transition those local motifs might vanish, requiring a different mechanism for
gapping - such as strong correlation. Here we examine if such intrinsic
structural and magnetic symmetry breaking might systematically explain the
formation of insulating band gaps both below and above the magnetic transition
and account at the same time for specific and non-accidental exceptions of the
absence of gaping in some compounds, such as SrVO3.

<h3>Non-perturbative indirect exchange in spin-valley coupled 2D crystals</h3>

<br>

We study indirect exchange interactions between localized spins of magnetic
impurities in spin-valley coupled systems described with the Kane-Mele model.
Our model captures the main ingredients of the energy bands of 1H transition
metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) monolayers, such as 1H-MoS$_2$ and 1H-NbSe$_2$. To
obtain the effective interactions, we use the exact diagonalization of the
Hamiltonian, avoiding momentum cut-offs. We start by comparing the standard
perturbation expansion in terms of the Kondo exchange with the exact
calculation of the interaction, treating the local spins classically. We find
that perturbation theory works well even beyond the regime where the relevant
figure of merit, the ratio between the exchange $J$ and the hopping $t$, is
small. We verify that the effective indirect exchange Hamiltonian derived from
perturbation theory also works in the non-perturbative regime. Additionally, we
analyse the interplay between the symmetry of the different terms of the
interaction (Heisenberg, Ising, and Dzyaloshinskii$-$Moriya (DM)), the
Fermi-surface topology, and the crystallographic direction in which the
impurities are placed. We show that the indirect exchange along the armchair
direction is actually Heisenberg-like, due to the reflection symmetry of the
crystal structure around this direction. Finally, we explore the exploitation
of indirect exchange, combined with atomic manipulation, to engineer the
Majumdar-Ghosh Model. Our results show that TMDs provide an extremely versatile
platform to engineer indirect exchange interactions.

<h3>Topological and quantum critical properties of the interacting Majorana  chain model</h3>

We study Majorana chain with the shortest possible interaction term and in
the presence of hoping alternation. When formulated in terms of spins the model
corresponds to the transverse field Ising model with nearest-neighbor
transverse and next-nearest-neighbor longitudinal repulsion. The phase diagram
obtained with extensive DMRG simulations is very rich and contains six phases.
Four gapped phases include paramagnetic, period-2 with broken translation
symmetry, $\mathbb{Z}_2$ with broken parity symmetry and the $\mathbb{Z}_2$
period-2 phase with both symmetries broken. In addition there are two floating
phases: gapless and critical Luttinger liquid with incommensurate correlations,
and with an additional spontaneously broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in one of
them. By analyzing an extended phase diagram we demonstrate that, in contrast
with a common belief, the Luttinger liquid phase along the self-dual critical
line terminates at a weaker interaction strength than the end point of the
Ising critical line that we find to be in the tri-critical Ising universality
class. We also show that none of these two points is a Lifshitz point
terminating the incommensurability. In addition, we analyzed topological
properties through Majorana zero modes emergent in the two topological phases,
with and without incommensurability. In the weak interaction regime, a
self-consistent mean-field treatment provides a remarkable accuracy for the
description of the spectral pairing and the parity switches induced by the
interaction.

Moir\'e patterns formed by stacking atomically-thin van der Waals crystals
with a relative twist angle can give rise to dramatic new physical properties.
The study of moir\'e materials has so far been limited to structures comprising
no more than a few vdW sheets, since a moir\'e pattern localized to a single
two-dimensional interface is generally assumed to be incapable of appreciably
modifying the properties of a bulk three-dimensional crystal. Layered
semimetals such as graphite offer a unique platform to challenge this paradigm,
owing to distinctive properties arising from their nearly-compensated electron
and hole bulk doping. Here, we perform transport measurements of dual-gated
devices constructed by slightly rotating a monolayer graphene sheet atop a thin
bulk graphite crystal. We find that the moir\'e potential transforms the
electronic properties of the entire bulk graphitic thin film. At zero and small
magnetic fields, transport is mediated by a combination of gate-tunable moir\'e
and graphite surface states, as well as coexisting semimetallic bulk states
that do not respond to gating. At high field, the moir\'e potential hybridizes
with the graphitic bulk states owing to the unique properties of the two lowest
Landau bands of graphite. These Landau bands facilitate the formation of a
single quasi-two-dimensional hybrid structure in which the moir\'e and bulk
graphite states are inextricably mixed. Our results establish twisted
graphene-graphite as the first in a new class of mixed-dimensional moir\'e
materials.

We discuss the recently proposed description of Kuramoto model in terms of
hyperbolic space and relate it to the information geometry. In particular the
dynamical equation in Kuramoto all-to-all model is identified with the gradient
flow of the Kullback-Leibner divergence on the statistical manifold. The Fisher
information metric is evaluated for the Kuramoto and Kuramoto-Shakagichi
models. We argue that the components of Fisher metric diverge at the critical
point hence it can be used as an alternative order parameter for the
synchronization phase transition.

<i>R. Tuovinen, Y. Pavlyukh, E. Perfetto, G. Stefanucci</i>

We present a time-linear scaling method to simulate open and correlated
quantum systems. The method inherits from many-body perturbation theory the
possibility to choose selectively the most relevant scattering processes in the
dynamics, thereby paving the way to the real-time characterization of
correlated ultrafast phenomena in quantum transport. The open system dynamics
is described in terms of an embedding correlator from which the time-dependent
current can be calculated using the Meir-Wingreen formula. We show how to
efficently implement the method through a simple grafting into recently
proposed time-linear Green's function schemes for closed systems.
Electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions can be treated on equal
footing while preserving all fundametal conservation laws.
