<h3>Viscous damping in weltering motion of trapped hydrodynamic dipolar  Fermi gases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00250" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00250</a>

<i>Reuben R. W. Wang, John L. Bohn</i>

We consider collective motion and damping of dipolar Fermi gases in the
hydrodynamic regime. We investigate the trajectories of collective oscillations
-- here dubbed ``weltering'' motions -- in cross-dimensional rethermalization
experiments via Monte Carlo simulations, where we find stark differences from
the dilute regime. These observations are interpreted within a semi-empirical
theory of viscous hydrodynamics for gases confined to anisotropic harmonic
potentials. The derived equations of motion provide a simple effective theory
that show favorable agreement with full numerical solutions. To do so, the
theory must carefully account for the size and shape of the effective volume
within which the gas' behavior is hydrodynamic. Although formulated for dipolar
molecules, our theoretical framework retains a flexibility to accommodate
arbitrary elastic cross sections.

In this work, we develop a twist-dependent electrochemical activity map,
combining a tight-binding electronic structure model with modified
Marcus-Hush-Chidsey kinetics in trilayer graphene. We identify a
counterintuitive rate enhancement region spanning the magic angle curve and
incommensurate twists of the system geometry. We find a broad activity peak
with a ruthenium hexamine redox couple in regions corresponding to both magic
angles and incommensurate angles, a result qualitatively distinct from the
twisted bilayer case. Flat bands and incommensurability offer new avenues for
reaction rate enhancements in electrochemical transformations.

<h3>Multiphoton Spectroscopy of a Dynamical Axion Insulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00064" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00064</a>

The unusual magnetoelectric transport present in Weyl semimetals can be
compactly understood as manifestations of an underlying axion field, which
itself is determined by the microscopic band structure. The axion couples
nonlinearly to electric and magnetic fields and possesses a signature
topological magnetoelectric response, leading to a modified form of Maxwell's
equations known as axion electrodynamics. Axions are naturally present in Weyl
semimetals relating to the separation of the Weyl nodes in energy and in
crystal momentum. In the presence of strong interactions, charge density-wave
(CDW) order may develop which serves to gap the Weyl nodes and introduces
corresponding collective excitations. When the inherent chiral symmetry of Weyl
semimetals is spontaneously broken by the formation of CDW order, the resultant
chiral condensate is endowed with intrinsic dynamics which yields a dynamical
contribution to the axion field. However, unambiguous identification of this
dynamical axion mode is challenging due to its inherent nonlinear coupling to
electromagnetic fields. Therefore, we propose an all-optical protocol for
verifying and characterizing dynamical axion collective modes in Weyl
semimetals with CDW order. First, we show that axion collective mode can be
excited using two-photon excitation schemes. Following excitation, the
collective axion oscillations are then diagnosed by measuring the time-resolved
Kerr rotation. Our results demonstrate a pathway towards utilizing multi-photon
and entangled pair spectroscopies to identify new correlated phases in quantum
matter.

<h3>On the detection of collective modes in unconventional superconductors  using tunneling spectroscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00072" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00072</a>
<br>
<i>Patrick A. Lee</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose using a scanning tunnel microscope (STM) with a superconducting
tip to probe the collective modes of unconventional superconductors. The modes
are predicted to appear as peaks in $dI/dV$ at voltages given by $eV=\omega_i
/2$ where $\omega_i$ denote the mode frequencies. If successful this will be a
powerful tool to sort out the pairing symmetry of unconventional
superconductors. The coupling to the collective mode is fourth order in the
single particle tunneling matrix element. Therefor the tunneling conductance of
the STM must not be too small compared with the quantum conductance $e^2/h$.
There is a further requirement that thermal de-phasing of the Josephson
coupling must not be too large, leading to the condition that the Josephson
energy $E_J$ must be larger than $kT$. The combined requirement of large
conductance and low temperature is challenging, and may explain why collective
modes have not been detected up to now. We discuss a number of examples where
the search for this effect may be promising. We also discuss the case of planar
tunnel junctions.

<h3>Coherence Properties of the Repulsive Anyon-Hubbard Dimer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00073" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00073</a>
<br>
<i>Martin Bonkhoff, Simon B. JÃ¤ger, Imke Schneider, Axel Pelster, Sebastian Eggert</i>
<br>
<br>
One-dimensional anyonic models of the Hubbard type show intriguing
ground-state properties, effectively transmuting between Bose-Einstein and
Fermi-Dirac statistics. The simplest model that one can investigate is an
anyonic version of the bosonic Josephson junction, the repulsive anyon-Hubbard
dimer. In the following we find an exact duality relation to the Bethe-solvable
Bose-Hubbard dimer, which is well known from quantum optics and information
theory and has interesting connections to spin squeezing and entangled coherent
states. Conversely, we show that the anyonic Hubbard dimer has non-trivial
coherence properties for large particle numbers, which can potentially be
probed by cold atom experiments. We find that the statistical interactions act
as excitation-selective filters or amplifiers for large particle numbers $N$,
determining the fate of multi-body coherences depending on their
commensurability with respect to the exchange parameter $\theta$.

<h3>Quantum geometry, optical absorption and topological gap bound</h3>

<br>
<i>Yugo Onishi, Liang Fu</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a generalized sum rule for optical absorption and magnetic
circular dichroism in insulators, and derive a general tight bound on the
energy gap of topological insulators. The two findings are shown to be
intimately related through quantum geometry. Our theory is applied to infrared
absorption near topological band inversion, and to topological gap in moir\'e
materials.

<h3>Pressure evolution of electronic structure and magnetism in the layered  van der Waals ferromagnet CrGeTe$_3$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00081" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00081</a>
<br>
<i>Han-Xiang Xu, Makoto Shimizu, Daniel Guterding, Junya Otsuki, Harald O. Jeschke</i>
<br>
<br>
Layered van der Waals ferromagnets, which preserve their magnetic properties
down to exfoliated monolayers, are fueling a bonanza of fundamental research
and nanoscale device demonstration. CrGeTe$_3$ is a prime example for this
class of materials. Its temperature-pressure phase diagram features an
insulator-to-metal transition and a significant increase of ferromagnetic
Curie-Weiss temperatures upon entering the metallic state. We use density
functional theory to understand the magnetic exchange interactions in
CrGeTe$_3$ at ambient and elevated pressure. We calculate Heisenberg exchange
couplings, which provide the correct ferromagnetic ground state and explain the
experimentally observed pressure dependence of magnetism in CrGeTe$_3$.
Furthermore, we combine density functional theory with dynamical mean field
theory to investigate the effects of electronic correlations and the nature of
the high pressure metallic state in CrGeTe$_3$.

<h3>Thermodynamic, Kinetic and Mechanical Modeling to Evaluate CO2-induced  Corrosion via Oxidation and Carburization in Fe, Ni alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00106" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00106</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
A computational framework integrating thermodynamics, kinetics, and
mechanical stress calculations is developed to study supercritical CO2 induced
corrosion in model Fe-based MA956 and Ni-based H214 alloys. Empirical models
parametrized using experimental data show surface oxidation and sub-surface
carburization for a wide range of thermodynamic conditions (800-1200 {\deg}C,
1-250 bar). CALPHAD simulations based on empirical models demonstrate higher
carburization resistance in H214 compared to MA956 below 900 {\deg}C and
through-thickness carburization in both alloys at higher temperatures. Finite
element modeling reveals enhanced volumetric misfit induced stresses at oxide
and carbide interfaces, and its critical dependence on the carbide chemistry
and concentration.

Quantum devices based on InSb nanowires (NWs) are a prime candidate system
for realizing and exploring topologically-protected quantum states and for
electrically-controlled spin-based qubits. The influence of disorder on
achieving reliable topological regimes has been studied theoretically,
highlighting the importance of optimizing both growth and nanofabrication. In
this work we investigate both aspects. We developed InSb nanowires with
ultra-thin diameters, as well as a new gating approach, involving few-layer
graphene (FLG) and Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD)-grown AlOx. Low-temperature
electronic transport measurements of these devices reveal conductance plateaus
and Fabry-P\'erot interference, evidencing phase-coherent transport in the
regime of few quantum modes. The approaches developed in this work could help
mitigate the role of material and fabrication-induced disorder in
semiconductor-based quantum devices.

<h3>Optical creation and annihilation of skyrmion patches in a bulk chiral  magnet</h3>

<br>
<br>
A key challenge for the realization of future skyrmion devices comprises the
controlled creation, annihilation and detection of these topologically
non-trivial magnetic spin textures. In this study, we report an all-optical
approach for writing, deleting, and reading skyrmions in the cubic chiral
magnet Fe$_{0.25}$Co$_{0.75}$Si based on thermal quenching. Using focused
femtosecond laser pulses, patches of a skyrmion state are created and
annihilated locally, demonstrating unprecedented control of thermally
metastable skyrmions in a bulk compound. The skyrmion state is read-out by
analyzing the microwave spin excitations in time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr
effect measurements. Extracting the magnetic field and laser fluence
dependence, we find well-separated magnetic field regimes and different laser
fluence thresholds for the laser-induced creation and annihilation of
metastable skyrmions. The all-optical skyrmion control, as established in this
study for a model system, represents a promising and energy-efficient approach
for the realization of skyrmions as magnetic bits in future storage devices,
reminiscent of magneto-optical storage devices in the past.

<h3>Supercurrent through a single transverse mode in nanowire Josephson  junctions</h3>

Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor materials are fueling research in
mesoscopic physics and quantum technology. Recently demonstrated smooth
$\beta$-Sn superconductor shells, due to the increased induced gap, are
expanding the available parameter space to new regimes. Fabricated on
quasiballistic InSb nanowires, with careful control over the hybrid interface,
Sn shells yield critical current-normal resistance products exceeding
temperature by at least an order of magnitude even when nanowire resistance is
of order 10k$\Omega$. In this regime Cooper pairs travel through a purely 1D
quantum wire for at least part of their trajectory. Here, we focus on the
evolution of supercurrent in magnetic field parallel to the nanowire. Long
decay up to fields of 1T is observed. At the same time, the decay for higher
occupied subbands is notably faster in some devices but not in others. We
analyze this using a tight-binding numerical model that includes the Zeeman,
orbital and spin-orbit effects. When the first subband is spin polarized, we
observe a dramatic suppression of supercurrent, which is also confirmed by the
model and suggests an absence of significant triplet supercurrent generation.

<h3>Strain Anisotropy Driven Spontaneous Formation of Nanoscrolls from  Two-Dimensional Janus Layers</h3>

Two-dimensional Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted
attention due to their emergent properties arising from broken mirror symmetry
and self-driven polarisation fields. While it has been proposed that their vdW
superlattices hold the key to achieving superior properties in piezoelectricity
and photovoltiacs, available synthesis has ultimately limited their
realisation. Here, we report the first packed vdW nanoscrolls made from Janus
TMDs through a simple one-drop solution technique. Our results, including
ab-initio simulations, show that the Bohr radius difference between the top
sulphur and the bottom selenium atoms within Janus M_Se^S (M=Mo, W) results in
a permanent compressive surface strain that acts as a nanoscroll formation
catalyst after small liquid interaction. Unlike classical 2D layers, the
surface strain in Janus TMDs can be engineered from compressive to tensile by
placing larger Bohr radius atoms on top (M_S^Se) to yield inverted C scrolls.
Detailed microscopy studies offer the first insights into their morphology and
readily formed Moir\'e lattices. In contrast, spectroscopy and FETs studies
establish their excitonic and device properties and highlight significant
differences compared to 2D flat Janus TMDs. These results introduce the first
polar Janus TMD nanoscrolls and introduce inherent strain-driven scrolling
dynamics as a catalyst to create superlattices.

<h3>Magnetization dynamics in a three-dimensional interconnected nanowire  array</h3>

Three-dimensional magnetic nanostructures have recently emerged as artificial
magnetic material types with unique properties bearing potential for
applications, including magnonic devices. Interconnected magnetic nanowires are
a sub-category within this class of materials that is attracting particular
interest. We investigate the high-frequency magnetization dynamics in a cubic
array of cylindrical magnetic nanowires through micromagnetic simulations based
on a frequency-domain formulation of the linearized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
equation. The small-angle high-frequency magnetization dynamics excited by an
external oscillatory field displays clear resonances at distinct frequencies.
These resonances are identified as oscillations connected to specific geometric
features and micromagnetic configurations. The geometry- and
configuration-dependence of the nanowire array's absorption spectrum
demonstrates the potential of such magnetic systems for tuneable and
reprogrammable magnonic applications.

<h3>Sign reversal diode effect in superconducting Dayem nanobridges</h3>

Supercurrent diodes are nonreciprocal electronic elements whose switching
current depends on their flow direction. Recently, a variety of composite
systems combining different materials and engineered asymmetric superconducting
devices have been proposed. Yet, ease of fabrication and tunable sign of
supercurrent rectification joined to large efficiency have not been assessed in
a single platform so far. Here, we demonstrate that all-metallic
superconducting Dayem nanobridges naturally exhibit nonreciprocal supercurrents
in the presence of an external magnetic field, with a rectification efficiency
up to $\sim 27\%$. Our niobium nanostructures are tailored so that the diode
polarity can be tuned by varying the amplitude of an out-of-plane magnetic
field or the temperature in a regime without magnetic screening. We show that
sign reversal of the diode effect may arise from the high-harmonic content of
the current phase relation of the nanoconstriction in combination with vortex
phase windings present in the bridge or an anomalous phase shift compatible
with anisotropic spin-orbit interactions.

<h3>Kinetic Friction of Structurally Superlubric 2D Material Interfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00205" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00205</a>

<br>
<br>
The ultra-low kinetic friction F_k of 2D structurally superlubric interfaces,
connected with the fast motion of the incommensurate moir\'e pattern, is often
invoked for its linear increase with velocity v_0 and area A, but never
seriously addressed and calculated so far. Here we do that, exemplifying with a
twisted graphene layer sliding on top of bulk graphite -- a demonstration case
that could easily be generalized to other systems. Neglecting quantum effects
and assuming a classical Langevin dynamics, we derive friction expressions
valid in two temperature regimes. At low temperatures the nonzero sliding
friction velocity derivative dF_k/dv_0 is shown by Adelman-Doll-Kantorovich
type approximations to be equivalent to that of a bilayer whose substrate is
affected by an analytically derived effective damping parameter, replacing the
semi-infinite substrate. At high temperatures, friction grows proportional to
temperature as analytically required by fluctuation-dissipation. The theory is
validated by non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations with different
contact areas, velocities, twist angles and temperatures. Using
6^{\circ}-twisted graphene on Bernal graphite as a prototype we find a shear
stress of measurable magnitude, from 25 kPa at low temperature to 260 kPa at
room temperature, yet only at high sliding velocities such as 100 m/s. However,
it will linearly drop many orders of magnitude below measurable values at
common experimental velocities such as 1 {\mu}m/s, a factor 10^{-8} lower. The
low but not ultra-low "engineering superlubric" friction measured in existing
experiments should therefore be attributed to defects and/or edges, whose
contribution surpasses by far the negligible moir\'e contribution.

<h3>Active surface flows accelerate the coarsening of lipid membrane domains</h3>

Phase separation of multicomponent lipid membranes is characterized by the
nucleation and coarsening of circular membrane domains that grow slowly in time
as $\sim t^{1/3}$, following classical theories of coalescence and Ostwald
ripening. In this work, we study the coarsening kinetics of phase-separating
lipid membranes subjected to nonequilibrium forces and flows transmitted by
motor-driven gliding actin filaments. We experimentally observe that the
activity-induced surface flows trigger rapid coarsening of non-circular
membrane domains that grow as $\sim t^{2/3}$, a 2$\times$ acceleration in the
growth exponent compared to passive coalescence and Ostwald ripening. We
analyze these results by developing analytical theories based on the
Smoluchowski coagulation model and the phase field model to predict the domain
growth in the presence of active flows. Our work demonstrates that active
matter forces may be used to control the growth and morphology of membrane
domains driven out of equilibrium.

<h3>Ground state stability, symmetry, and degeneracy in Mott insulators with  long range interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00221" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00221</a>

Recently, models with long-range interactions -- known as Hatsugai-Kohmoto
(HK) models -- have emerged as a promising tool to study the emergence of
superconductivity and topology in strongly correlated systems. Two obstacles,
however, have made it difficult to understand the applicability of these
models, especially to topological features: they have thermodynamically large
ground state degeneracies, and they tacitly assume spin conservation. We show
that neither are essential to HK models and that both can be avoided by
introducing interactions between tight-binding states in the orbital basis,
rather than between energy eigenstates. To solve these "orbital" models, we
introduce a general technique for solving HK models and show that previous
models appear as special cases. We illustrate our method by exactly solving
graphene and the Kane-Mele model with HK interactions. Both realize Mott
insulating phases with finite magnetic susceptibility; the graphene model has a
fourfold degenerate ground state while the Kane-Mele model has a nondegenerate
ground state in the presence of interactions. Our technique then allows us to
study the effect of strong interactions on symmetry-enforced degeneracy in
spin-orbit coupled double-Dirac semimetals. We show that adding HK interactions
to a double Dirac semi-metal leads to a Mott insulating, spin liquid phase. We
then use a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation to express the low-energy
Hamiltonian in terms of the spin degrees of freedom, making the spin-charge
separation explicit. Finally, we enumerate a broader class of
symmetry-preserving HK interactions and show how they can violate insulating
filling constraints derived from space group symmetries. This suggests that new
approaches are needed to study topological order in the presence of long-range
interactions of the HK type.

<h3>Disorder-dependent slopes of the upper critical field in nodal and  nodeless superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00259" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00259</a>
<br>
<i>V. G. Kogan, R. Prozorov</i>

We study the slopes of the upper critical field
$\partial_{T}H_{c2}|_{T_{c}}\equiv\partial H_{_{c2}}/\partial T$ at $T_{c}$ in
anisotropic superconductors with transport (non-magnetic) scattering employing
the Ginzburg-Landau theory, developed for this situation by S. Pokrovsky and V.
Pokrovsky, Phys. Rev. B 54, 13275 (1996). We found unexpected behavior of the
slopes for a $d-$wave superconductor and in a more general case of materials
with line nodes in the order parameter. Specifically, the presence of line
nodes causes $\partial_{T}H_{c2}|_{T_{c}}$ to decrease with increasing
non-magnetic scattering parameter $P$, unlike the nodeless case where the slope
increases. In a pure $d-$wave case, the slope $\partial H_{c2}|_{T_{c}}$
changes from decreasing to increasing when scattering parameter approaches
$P\approx0.91\,P_{{\rm crit}}$, where $P_{{\rm crit}}\approx0.2807$ at which
$T_{c}\to0$ that implies the the existence of a gapless state in $d-$wave
superconductors with transport scattering in the interval, $0.91\,P_{{\rm
{crit}}}<P<P_{{\rm crit}}$. Furthermore, we have considered the mixed $s+d$
order parameter that has 4 nodes on a cylindrical Fermi surface when a $d-$part
is dominant, or no nodes at all when an $s-$phase is the major one. We find
that presence of nodes causes the slope $\partial_{T}H_{c2}|_{T_{c}},$ to
decrease initially with increasing $P$, whereas in the nodeless state,
$\partial_{T}H_{c2}|_{T_{c}}$ monotonically increases. Therefore, fairly
straightforward experiments make it possible to decide whether or not the order
parameter of a superconductor has nodes by measuring the disorder-dependence of
the slope of $H_{c2}$ at $T_{c}$.

Unconventional superconductivity has long been believed to arise from a
lab-grown correlated electronic system. Here we report compelling evidence of
unconventional nodal superconductivity in a mineral superconductor \rhs. We
investigated the temperature-dependent London penetration depth
$\Delta\lambda(T)$ and disorder evolution of the critical temperature $T_c$ and
upper critical field $H_{c2}(T)$ in synthetic miassite \rhs. We found a
power-law behavior of $\Delta\lambda(T)\sim T^n$ with $n\approx 1.1$ at low
temperatures below $0.3T_c$ ($T_c$ = 5.4 K), which is consistent with the
presence of lines of the node in the superconducting gap of \rhs. The nodal
character of the superconducting state in \rhs~was supported by the observed
pairbreaking effect in $T_c$ and $H_{c2}(T)$ in samples with the controlled
disorder that was introduced by low-temperature electron irradiation. We
propose a nodal sign-changing superconducting gap in the $A_{1g}$ irreducible
representation, which preserves the cubic symmetry of the crystal and is in
excellent agreement with the superfluid density, $\lambda^2(0)/\lambda^2(T)$.

Infinite-component Chern-Simons-Maxwell theories with a periodic $K$ matrix
provide abundant examples of gapped and gapless, foliated and non-foliated
fracton orders. In this paper, we study the ground state degeneracy of these
theories. We show that the ground state degeneracy exhibit various patterns as
a function of the linear system size -- the size of the $K$ matrix. It can grow
exponentially or polynomially, cycle over finitely many values, or fluctuate
erratically inside an exponential envelope. We relate these different patterns
of the ground state degeneracy with the roots of the ``determinant
polynomial'', a Laurent polynomial, associated to the periodic $K$ matrix.
These roots also determine whether the theory is gapped or gapless. Based on
the ground state degeneracy, we formulate a necessary condition for a gapped
theory to be a foliated fracton order.

<h3>Structure and Dynamics of Hybrid Colloid-Polyelectrolyte Coacervates:  Insights from Molecular Simulations</h3>

Electrostatic interactions in polymeric systems are responsible for a wide
range of liquid-liquid phase transitions that are of importance for biology and
materials science. Such transitions are referred to as complex coacervation,
and recent studies have sought to understand the underlying physics and
chemistry. Most theoretical and simulation efforts to date have focused on
oppositely charged linear polyelectrolytes, which adopt nearly ideal-coil
conformations in the condensed phase. However, when one of the coacervate
components is a globular protein, a better model of complexation should replace
one of the species with a spherical charged particle or colloid. In this work,
we perform coarse-grained simulations of colloid-polyelectrolyte coacervation
using a spherical model for the colloid. Simulation results indicate that the
electroneutral cell of the resulting (hybrid) coacervates consists of a
polyelectrolyte layer adsorbed on the colloid. Power laws for the structure and
the density of the condensed phase, which are extracted from simulations, are
found to be consistent with the adsorption-based scaling theory of
coacervation. The coacervates remain amorphous (disordered) at a moderate
colloid charge, $Q$, while an intra-coacervate colloidal crystal is formed
above a certain threshold, at $Q > Q^{*}$. In the disordered coacervate, if $Q$
is sufficiently low, colloids diffuse as neutral non-sticky nanoparticles in
the semidilute polymer solution. For higher $Q$, adsorption is strong and
colloids become effectively sticky. Our findings are relevant for the
coacervation of polyelectrolytes with proteins, spherical micelles of ionic
surfactants, and solid organic or inorganic nanoparticles.

<br>
<br>
The ultrafast electronic structures of the charge density wave material
1T-TiSe$_2$ were investigated by high-resolution time- and angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy. We found that the quasiparticle populations drove
ultrafast electronic phase transitions in 1T-TiSe$_2$ within 100 fs after
photoexcitation, and a metastable metallic state, which was significantly
different from the equilibrium normal phase, was evidenced far below the charge
density wave transition temperature. Detailed time- and pump-fluence-dependent
experiments revealed that the photoinduced metastable metallic state was a
result of the halted motion of the atoms through the coherent electron-phonon
coupling process, and the lifetime of this state was prolonged to picoseconds
with the highest pump fluence used in this study. Ultrafast electronic dynamics
were well captured by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model. Our work
demonstrates a mechanism for realizing novel electronic states by photoinducing
coherent motion of atoms in the lattice.

The new technology of energy conversion must be developed to ensure energy
sustainability. Thermoelectric (TE) materials provide an effective means to
solve the energy crisis. As a potential TE candidate, the TE properties of
perovskite have received extensively attention. We here investigate the TE
transport properties of the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) BaSnO3 by
first-principles calculations. We find that the BaSnO3 perovskite exhibits
outstanding dynamic and thermal stabilities, which provide excellent electronic
and thermal transport properties simultaneously. These properties contribute to
the remarkable Seebeck coefficient and power factor, which gives rise to the ZT
of n-1.03 and p-3.64 at 900 K. Additionally, doping and nanostructure open
prospects for effectively improving the TE properties of BaSnO3. Our work
provides a basis for further optimizing the TE transport properties of cubic
BaSnO3 and may have worthwhile practical significance for applying cubic
perovskite to the high-temperature thermoelectric field.

Dynamic fluctuations in hydrogen-bond network of water occur from femto- to
nano-second timescale and provides insights into structural/dynamical aspects
of water at ion-water interfaces. Employing terahertz spectroscopy assisted
with molecular dynamics simulations, we study aqueous chloride solutions of
five monovalent cations, namely, Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs. We show that ions modify
the behavior of surrounding water molecules and form interfacial layers of
water around them with physical properties distinct from that of bulk water.
Small cations with high charge densities influence the kinetics of water well
beyond the first solvation shell. At terahertz frequencies, we observe an
emergence of fast relaxation processes of water with their magnitude following
the ionic order Cs>Rb>K>Na>Li, revealing an enhanced population density of
weakly coordinated water at ion-water interface. The results shed light on the
structure breaking tendency of monovalent cations and provide insights into the
properties of ionic solutions at the molecular level.

<br>

We investigate thermodynamics of general nonequilibrium processes stopped at
stochastic times. We propose a systematic strategy for constructing
fluctuation-theorem-like martingales for each thermodynamic functional,
yielding a family of stopping-time fluctuation theorems. We derive
second-law-like thermodynamic inequalities for the mean thermodynamic
functional at stochastic stopping times, the bounds of which are stronger than
the thermodynamic inequalities resulting from the traditional fluctuation
theorems when the stopping time is reduced to a deterministic one. Numerical
verification is carried out for three well-known thermodynamic functionals,
namely, entropy production, free energy dissipation and dissipative work. These
universal equalities and inequalities are valid for arbitrary stopping
strategies, and thus provide a comprehensive framework with new insights into
the fundamental principles governing nonequilibrium systems.

In this work, we review two different generalizations of a quantum geometric
tensor (QGT) in two-band non-Hermitian systems and apply the formalism to the
system of microcavity exciton polaritons. In particular, we extend the existing
method of measuring the QGT that uses the pseudospins in photonic and
polaritonic systems. We find that both forms of the generalized QGT can be
expressed in terms of the exciton-polariton pseudospin components, which can be
experimentally measured. We then present the generalized QGT components, i.e.
the quantum metric and Berry curvature, for an exemplar non-Hermitian
exciton-polariton system. Our simulations of the wave packet dynamics in this
exciton-polariton system show that the right-right Berry curvature gives a more
accurate description of the anomalous Hall drift.

Renewal process is a point process where an inter-event time between
successive renewals is an independent and identically distributed random
variable. Alternating renewal process is a dichotomous process and a slight
generalization of the renewal process, where the inter-event time distribution
alternates between two distributions. We investigate statistical properties of
the number of renewals and occupation times for one of the two states in
alternating renewal processes. When both means of the inter-event times are
finite, the alternating renewal process can reach an equilibrium. On the other
hand, an alternating renewal process shows aging when one of the means
diverges. We provide analytical calculations for the moments of the number of
renewals, occupation time statistics, and the correlation function for several
case studies in the inter-event-time distributions. We show anomalous
fluctuations for the number of renewals and occupation times when the second
moment of inter-event time diverges. When the mean inter-event time diverges,
distributional limit theorems for the number of events and occupation times are
shown analytically. These are known as the Mittag-Leffler distribution and the
generalized arcsine law in probability theory.

<br>
In organic proton-transfer ferroelectrics (OPTFe), molecules are linked
together in a hydrogen-bonded network and proton transfer (PT) between
molecules is the dominant mechanism of ferroelectric switching. Their fast
switching frequencies make them attractive alternatives to conventional ceramic
ferroelectrics, which contain rare and/or toxic elements, and require high
processing temperatures. In this study, we mined the Cambridge Structural
Database for potential OPTFes, uncovering all previously reported compounds,
both tautomers and co-crystals, in addition to seven new candidate tautomers.
The mining was based on identifying polar crystal structures with pseudo
center-of-symmetry and viable PT paths. The spontaneous polarization and PT
barriers were assessed using density functional theory.

<h3>Impact of magnetic anisotropy on the magnon Hanle effect in  $Î±$-Fe$_2$O$_3$</h3>

<br>
<br>
In easy-plane antiferromagnets, the nature of the elementary excitations of
the spin system is captured by the precession of the magnon pseudospin around
its equilibrium pseudofield, manifesting itself in the magnon Hanle effect.
Here, we investigate the impact of growth-induced changes in the magnetic
anisotropy on this effect in the antiferromagnetic insulator
$\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ (hematite). To this end, we compare the structural,
magnetic, and magnon-based spin transport properties of $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$
films with different thicknesses grown by pulsed laser deposition in molecular
and atomic oxygen atmospheres. While in films grown with molecular oxygen a
spin-reorientation transition (Morin transition) is absent down to $10\,$K, we
observe a Morin transition for those grown by atomic-oxygen-assisted
deposition, indicating a change in magnetic anisotropy. Interestingly, even for
a $19\,$nm thin $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ film grown with atomic oxygen we still
detect a Morin transition at $125\,$K. We characterize the magnon Hanle effect
in these $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ films via all-electrical magnon transport
measurements. The films grown with atomic oxygen show a markedly different
magnon spin signal from those grown in molecular oxygen atmospheres. Most
importantly, the maximum magnon Hanle signal is significantly enhanced and the
Hanle peak is shifted to lower magnetic field values for films grown with
atomic oxygen. These observations suggest a change of magnetic anisotropy for
$\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ films fabricated by atomic-oxygen-assisted deposition
resulting in an increased oxygen content in these films. Our findings provide
new insights into the possibility to fine-tune the magnetic anisotropy in
$\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ and thereby to engineer the magnon Hanle effect.

<br>
<br>
UTe$_{2}$ is a strong candidate for a topological spin-triplet
superconductor, and it is considered that the interplay of magnetic fluctuation
and superconductivity is essential for the origin of the superconductivity.
Despite various experiments suggesting ferromagnetic criticality, neutron
scattering measurements observed only antiferromagnetic fluctuation and called
for theories of spin-triplet superconductivity near the antiferromagnetic
quantum critical point. We construct a periodic Anderson model with
one-dimensional conduction electrons and two- or three-dimensional
$f$-electrons, reminiscent of the band structure of UTe$_2$, and show that
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic fluctuations are reproduced depending on
the Fermi surface of $f$ electrons. These magnetic fluctuations cooperatively
stabilize spin-triplet $p$-wave superconductivity. We also study hybridization
dependence as a possible origin of pressure-induced superconducting phases and
find that moderately large hybridization drastically changes the
antiferromagnetic wave vector and stabilizes $d$-wave superconductivity.

<h3>Thermodynamic constraints on the power spectral density in and out of  equilibrium</h3>

<i>Andreas Dechant</i>
<br>
<br>
The power spectral density of an observable quantifies the amount of
fluctuations at a given frequency and can reveal the influence of different
timescales on the observable's dynamics. Here, we show that the spectral
density in a continuous-time Markov process can be both lower and upper bounded
by an expression involving two constants that depend on the observable and the
properties of the system. In equilibrium, we identify these constants with the
low- and high-frequency limit of the spectral density, respectively; thus, the
spectrum at arbitrary frequency is bounded by the short- and long-time behavior
of the observable. Out of equilibrium, on the other hand, the constants can no
longer be identified with the limiting behavior of the spectrum, allowing for
peaks that correspond to oscillations in the dynamics. We show that the height
of these peaks is related to dissipation, allowing to infer the degree to which
the system is out of equilibrium from the measured spectrum.

We study a one-dimensional mixture of active (run-and-tumble) particles and
passive (Brownian) particles, with single-file constraint, in a sawtooth
potential. The active particles experience a ratchet effect: this generates a
current, which can push passive particles against an applied load. The
resulting system operates as an active engine. Using numerical simulations, we
analyse the efficiency of this engine, and we discuss how it can be optimised.
Efficient operation occurs when the active particles self-organise into teams,
which can push the passive ones against large loads by leveraging collective
behaviour. We discuss how the particle arrangement, conserved under the
single-file constraint, affects the engine efficiency. We also show that
relaxing this constraint still allows the engine to operate effectively.

The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals magnetic materials and
their heterostructures provided an exciting platform for emerging phenomena
with intriguing implications in information technology. Here, based on a
multiscale modelling approach that combines first-principles calculations and a
Heisenberg model, we demonstrate that interfacing a CrTe$_2$ layer with various
Te-based layers enables the control of the magnetic exchange and
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions as well as the magnetic anisotropy energy of
the whole heterobilayer, and thereby the emergence of topological magnetic
phases such as skyrmions and antiferromagnetic Neel merons. The latter are
novel particles in the world of topological magnetism since they arise in a
frustrated Neel magnetic environment and manifest as multiples of intertwined
hexamer-textures. Our findings pave a promising road for proximity-induced
engineering of both ferromagnetic and long-sought antiferromagnetic chiral
objects in the very same 2D material, which is appealing for new information
technology devices employing quantum materials.

<br>
<br>
The interplay between thermodynamics and information theory has a long
history, but its quantitative manifestations are still being explored. We
import tools from expected utility theory from economics into stochastic
thermodynamics. We prove that, in a process obeying Crooks' fluctuation
relations, every $\alpha$ R\'enyi divergence between the forward process and
its reverse has the operational meaning of the ``certainty equivalent'' of
dissipated work (or, more generally, of entropy production) for a player with
risk aversion $r=\alpha-1$. The two known cases $\alpha=1$ and $\alpha=\infty$
are recovered and receive the new interpretation of being associated to a
risk-neutral and an extreme risk-averse player respectively. Among the new
results, the condition for $\alpha=0$ describes the behavior of a risk-seeking
player willing to bet on the transient violations of the second law. Our
approach further leads to a generalized Jarzynski equality, and generalizes to
a broader class of statistical divergences.

We study the statistics of a one-dimensional randomly advected field with
diffusion. The motivation for this setup comes from a straightforward
interpretation as advection of particles in one-dimensional turbulence, but it
is also related to a problem of synchronization of dynamical systems driven by
common noise. A general class of lattice models describing the joint effect of
random advection and diffusion for an ensemble of particles is introduced. It
consists of a general microscopic random update rule and encompasses as
specific cases, some models studied in the literature, like the Kang-Redner,
Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti, Takatasu-Taguchi etc. For finite lattices, we study
both the coagulation of an initially spread field (interpreted as roughening),
and the statistical steady-state properties. We distinguish two main
size-dependent regimes, depending on the strength of the advection term and on
the lattice size. Using numerical simulations and mean-field approach, we study
the statistics of the field. For weak diffusion, we unveil a characteristic
hierarchical structure of the field. We also connect the model and the iterated
function systems concept

<br>
<br>
In superlattices of twisted semiconductor monolayers, tunable moir\'e
potentials emerge, trapping excitons into periodic arrays. In particular,
spatially separated interlayer excitons are subject to a deep potential
landscape and they exhibit a permanent dipole providing a unique opportunity to
study interacting bosonic lattices. Recent experiments have demonstrated
density-dependent transport properties of moir\'e excitons, which could play a
key role for technological applications. However, the intriguing interplay
between exciton-exciton interactions and moir\'e trapping has not been well
understood yet. In this work, we develop a microscopic theory of interacting
excitons in external potentials allowing us to tackle this highly challenging
problem. We find that interactions between moir\'e excitons lead to a
delocalization at intermediate densities and we show how this transition can be
tuned via twist angle and temperature. The delocalization is accompanied by a
modification of optical moir\'e resonances, which gradually merge into a single
free exciton peak. The predicted density-tunability of the supercell hopping
can be utilized to control the energy transport in moir\'e materials.

The high-frequency shear modulus of five Zr-, Pd-, Cu-based conventional and
two high-entropy bulk metallic glasses was measured in a wide temperature range
up to the beginning of crystallization. Using these data and general
thermodynamic relations, the "fluctuation" heat capacity $\Delta C_f$
determined by local structural fluctuations in the defect regions is introduced
and calculated. It is found that $\Delta C_f$ temperature dependence for all
metallic glasses has a large peak located slightly below or above the glass
transition temperature but clearly lower than the crystallization onset
temperature. The form of this peak resembles the characteristic $\lambda$-peak
typical for order-disorder phase transitions. It is suggested that this $\Delta
C_f$-peak reflects certain underlying critical phenomenon. The critical
temperature $T_0$ (peak temperature) and corresponding critical index $\alpha$
are determined. Averaged over all seven metallic glasses under investigation in
the initial and relaxed states, the critical index $\alpha=0.26$. The results
obtained indicate that the fluctuations of thermal energy near the glass
transition bear the marks of a continuous phase transition. However, the
derived critical index is between those corresponding to a second-order phase
transition ($\alpha\approx 0.1$) and a critical transition characterized by a
tricritical point ($\alpha \approx 0.5$).

<br>
<br>
The formation of groups of interacting individuals improves performance and
fitness in many decentralised systems, from micro-organisms to social insects,
from robotic swarms to artificial intelligence algorithms. Often, group
formation and high-level coordination in these systems emerge from individuals
with limited information-processing capabilities implementing low-level rules
of communication to signal to each other. Here, we show that, even in a
community of clueless individuals incapable of processing information and
communicating, a dynamic environment can coordinate group formation by
transiently storing memory of the earlier passage of individuals. Our results
identify a new mechanism of indirect coordination via shared memory that is
primarily promoted and reinforced by dynamic environmental factors, thus
overshadowing the need for any form of explicit signalling between individuals.
We expect this pathway to group formation to be relevant for understanding and
controlling self-organisation and collective decision making in both living and
artificial active matter in real-life environments.

Topological insulators and superconductors have attracted considerable
attention, and many different theoretical tools have been used to gain insight
into their properties. Here we investigate how perturbations can spread through
exemplary one-dimensional topological insulators and superconductors using
out-of-time ordered correlators. Out-of-time ordered correlators are often used
to consider how information becomes scrambled during quantum dynamics. The
wavefront of the out-of-time ordered correlator can be ballistic regardless of
the underlying system dynamics, and here we confirm that for topological free
fermion systems the wavefront spreads linearly at a characteristic butterfly
velocity. We pay special attention to the topologically protected edge states,
finding that "information" can become trapped in the edge states and
essentially decoupled from the bulk, surviving for relatively long times. We
consider different models with multiple possible edge states coexisting on a
single edge.

We study the Andreev and normal reflection processes -- retro as well as
specular -- in a bilayer graphene-superconductor junction where equal and
opposite displacement fields are applied for the top and bottom layers to
induce a band gap. By employing the Dirac-Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation for the
gapped bilayer graphene-superconductor junction, we calculate the reflections
probabilities within the scattering theory approach. The subgap conductance,
calculated in the framework of Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism, shows the
contribution from the Andreev retro-reflection (specular-reflection) when the
applied bias voltage is below (above) the Fermi energy. Notably, both retro and
specular reflections are modified in the presence of the displacement field,
and the retro-to-specular crossover gets amplified when the displacement field
is relatively small. They can be further tuned to either specular or retro
Andreev reflection by adjusting the Fermi energy. Furthermore, our study
reveals the simultaneous existence of double Andreev reflections and double
normal reflections when the displacement field becomes comparable to the
interlayer coupling strength. The existence of the normal retro-reflection
process in a bilayer graphene-superconductor junction is a new finding which
shows a distinctive feature in the conductance that can be experimentally
verified.

The challenging task of scaling-down the size of the power saving electronic
devices can be accomplished by exploiting the spin degree of freedom of the
conduction electrons in van der Waals (vdW) spintronic architectures built with
2D materials. One of the key components of such a device is a near-room
temperature 2D ferromagnet with good metallicity that can generate a highly
spin-polarized electronic transport current. However, most of the known 2D
ferromagnets have either a very low temperature ordering, poor conductivity, or
low spin polarization. In this context, the Fe$_n$GeTe$_2$ (with $n\geq3$)
family of ferromagnets stand out due to their near-room temperature
ferromagnetism and good metallicity. We have performed spin-resolved Andreev
reflection spectroscopy on Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ ($T_{Curie} \sim$ 273 K) and
demonstrated that the ferromagnet is capable of generating a very high
transport spin polarization, exceeding 50$\%$. This makes Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ a
strong candidate for application in all-vdW power-saving spintronic devices.

Many complex and disordered systems fail to reach equilibrium after they have
been quenched or perturbed. Instead, they sluggishly relax toward equilibrium
at an ever-slowing, history-dependent rate, a process termed physical aging.
The microscopic processes underlying the dynamic slow-down during aging and the
reason for its similar occurrence in different systems remain poorly
understood. Here, through experiments in crumpled sheets and simulations of a
minimal mechanical model - a disordered network of bi-stable elastic elements -
we reveal the structural mechanism underlying logarithmic aging in this system.
We show that under load, the system self-organizes to a metastable state poised
on the verge of an instability, where it can remain for long, but finite times.
The system's relaxation is intermittent, advancing via rapid sequences of
instabilities, grouped into self-similar, aging avalanches. Crucially, the
quiescent dwell times between avalanches grow in proportion to the system's
age, due to a slow increase of the lowest effective energy barrier. This
slow-down leads to an overall logarithmic aging process.

<br>
<br>
The very existence of a phase transition for spin glasses in an external
magnetic field is controversial, even in high dimensions. We carry out massive
simulations of the Ising spin-glass in a field, in six dimensions (which,
according to classical, but not generally accepted, field-theoretical studies,
is the upper critical dimension). We find a phase transition and compute the
critical exponents, that are found to be compatible with their mean-field
values. We also find that the replica-symmetric Hamiltonian describes the
scaling of the renormalized couplings near the phase transition.

<h3>Discrete control of capacitance in quantum circuits</h3>

Precise in-situ control of system parameters is indispensable for all quantum
hardware applications. The capacitance in a circuit, however, is usually a
simple consequence of electrostatics, and thus quite literally cast in stone.
We here propose a way to control the charging energy of a given island by
exploiting recently predicted Chern insulator physics in common Cooper-pair
transistors, where the capacitance switches between discrete values given by
the Chern number. We identify conditions for which the discrete control
benefits from exponentially reduced noise sensitivity to implement protected
tunable qubits.

<br>
<br>
The kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K,Rb,Cs) present an ideal sandbox to study
the interrelation between multiple coexisting correlated phases such as charge
order and superconductivity. So far, no consensus on the microscopic nature of
these states has been reached as the proposals struggle to explain all their
exotic physical properties. Among these, field-switchable electric
magneto-chiral anisotropy (eMChA) in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ provides intriguing evidence
for a rewindable electronic chirality, yet the other family members have not
been likewise investigated. Here, we present a comparative study of
magneto-chiral transport between CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and KV$_3$Sb$_5$. Despite their
similar electronic structure, KV$_3$Sb$_5$ displays negligible eMChA, if any,
and with no field switchability. This is in stark contrast to the
non-saturating eMChA in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ even in high fields up to 35 T. In light
of their similar band structures, the stark difference in eMChA suggests its
origin in the correlated states. Clearly, the V kagome nets alone are not
sufficient to describe the physics and the interactions with their environment
are crucial in determining the nature of their low-temperature state.

<h3>Phonon-mediated superconductivity in ternary silicides $X_4$CoSi ($X=$  Nb, Ta)</h3>

<i>Jonas Bekaert</i>
<br>
<br>
The superconducting properties of two recently synthesized ternary silicides
with unit formula $X_4$CoSi ($X=$ Nb, Ta) are investigated through \textit{ab
initio} calculations combined with Eliashberg theory. Interestingly, their
crystal structure comprises interlocking honeycomb networks of Nb/Ta atoms.
Nb$_4$CoSi is found to harbor better conditions for phonon-mediated
superconductivity, as it possesses a higher density of states at the Fermi
level, fostering stronger electron-phonon coupling. The superconducting
critical temperatures ($T_c$) follow the same trend, with Nb$_4$CoSi having a
twice higher value than Ta$_4$CoSi. Furthermore, the calculated $T_c$ values
(6.0 K vs. 3.2 K) agree excellently with the experimentally obtained ones,
establishing superconductivity in this new materials class as mediated by the
electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, our calculations show that the
superconducting properties of these compounds do not simply correlate with the
parameters of their honeycomb networks, contrary to proposals raised in the
literature. Rather, their complete fermiology and phonon spectrum should be
taken into account in order to explain their respective superconducting
properties.

<h3>Turning catalytically active pores into active pumps</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00664" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00664</a>
<br>
<i>G. C. Antunes, P. Malgaretti, J. Harting</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a semi-analytical model of self-diffusioosmotic transport in
active pores, which includes advective transport and the inverse chemical
reaction which consumes solute. In previous work (Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 188003,
2022), we have demonstrated the existence of a spontaneous symmetry breaking in
fore-aft symmetric pores that enables them to function as a micropump. We now
show that this pumping transition is controlled by three timescales. Two
timescales characterize advective and diffusive transport. The third timescale
corresponds to how long a solute molecule resides in the pore before being
consumed. Introducing asymmetry to the pore (either via the shape or the
catalytic coating) reveals a second type of advection-enabled transitions. In
asymmetric pores, the flow rate exhibits discontinuous jumps and hysteresis
loops upon tuning the parameters that control the asymmetry. This work
demonstrates the interconnected roles of shape and catalytic patterning in the
dynamics of active pores, and shows how to design a pump for optimum
performance.

<h3>Heat-transfer fingerprint of Josephson breathers</h3>

<br>
<br>
A sine-Gordon breather enhances the heat transfer in a thermally biased long
Josephson junction. This solitonic channel allows for the tailoring of the
local temperature throughout the system. Furthermore, the phenomenon implies a
clear thermal fingerprint for the breather, and thus a 'non-destructive'
breather detection strategy is proposed here. Distinct breathing frequencies
result in morphologically different local temperature peaks, which can be
identified in an experiment.

<br>
Superconducting resonators and parametric amplifiers are important components
in scientific systems such as kinetic inductance detector arrays,
frequency-domain multiplexers for other superconducting bolometers,
spin-ensemble based memories, and circuit quantum electrodynamics
demonstrators. In this paper, we report microwave measurements of
superconducting Ti, Nb, and NbN resonators and their use as parametric
amplifiers. These half-wave resonators were fabricated under near identical
sputtering and lithographic conditions to ensure a like-for-like comparison of
material properties. We report a wide range of properties and behaviours in
terms of transition temperatures, resistivities, rate-limiting nonlinear
response times, nonlinear dissipation, signs of the nonlinear inductances and
their dependences on temperature and resonance harmonic. We have successfully
operated Nb and NbN resonators as high gain parametric amplifiers, achieving
greater than $20\,\mathrm{dB}$ of power amplification. We have shown that for a
half-wave resonator, amplification can be realised not only in the fundamental
resonance but also in any of the higher harmonic resonances. Further, for
materials with high transition temperatures, e.g. Nb and NbN, amplification can
be achieved at $\sim4\,\mathrm{K}$, i.e. a temperature maintained by a pulse
tube cooler. Finally, in materials systems that have very fast response times,
e.g. NbN, we have found that a cross-harmonic type of amplification can be
achieved by placing pump tone in a different resonant mode as the signal and
the idler. This wide range of observations will have important implications on
the design and application of superconducting parametric amplifiers.

<h3>Quantum many-body scars in spin-1 Kitaev chain with uniaxial single-ion  anisotropy</h3>

<br>
<i>Wen-Yi Zhang, Ya-Nan Wang, Dongchang Liu, Jie Ren, Jia Li, Ning Wu, Andrzej M. OleÅ, Wen-Long You</i>
<br>
<br>
To establish a solid-state-based framework for the coexistence of quantum
many-body scars and quantum criticality, we investigate the spin-1 Kitaev chain
with uniaxial single-ion anisotropy (SIA). In the subspace with uniform
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge fields, this model can be exactly mapped to the spin-1/2
effective detuned PXP Hamiltonian, where the SIA plays a role of static
detuning term. The quench dynamics starting from the product states are
symmetric between the positive and negative values of the SIA, while a quantum
phase transition from the Kitaev spin liquid to the dimer phase only occurs at
the critical point with a negative $D_c$, implies the spontaneous breaking of
the translational symmetry. We find that the coherent oscillations of quantum
fidelity and certain local observables are sustained against small SIA
perturbations in a quantum quench from special initial states. While the
oscillation amplitudes of these observables decay with time as the SIA strength
is increased, the system completely thermalizes upon approaching the critical
point. In contrast, the initial polarized state, which shows an absence of
revivals of quantum fidelity, will exhibit long revivals for $D<D_c$. We also
consider the perturbation of Heisenberg interactions which spoil the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge fields. A complete phase diagram is given by the infinite
time evolving block decimation method and the ground state properties of each
phase are accurately captured by miscellaneous spin correlations. Our work
opens the door to understanding surprising connections between many-body scars
and quantum criticality in systems with a higher value of spin.

<h3>Singular travelling waves in soft viscoelastic solids of rate type</h3>

<br>
<i>Harold Berjamin, Michel Destrade, Giuseppe Saccomandi</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider shear wave propagation in soft viscoelastic solids of rate type.
Based on objective stress rates, the constitutive model accounts for finite
strain, incompressibility, as well as stress- and strain-rate viscoelasticity.
The theory generalises the standard linear solid model to three-dimensional
volume-preserving motions of large amplitude in a physically-consistent way.
The nonlinear equations governing shear motion take the form of a
one-dimensional hyperbolic system with relaxation. For specific objective rates
of Cauchy stress (lower- and upper-convected derivatives), we study the
propagation of acceleration waves and shock waves. Then we show that both
smooth and discontinuous travelling wave solutions can be obtained
analytically. We observe that the amplitude and velocity of steady shocks are
very sensitive to variations of the stress relaxation time. Furthermore, the
existence of steady shocks is conditional. Extension of these results to the
case of the Jaumann stress rate is attempted. Although the latter has more
satisfactory mathematical properties, the analysis of simple shearing motions
is more involved in this case.

<h3>Shape Transitions in Network Model of Active Elastic Shells</h3>

<br>
<br>
Morphogenesis involves the transformation of initially simple shapes, such as
multicellular spheroids, into more complex $3D$ shapes. These shape changes are
governed by mechanical forces including molecular motor-generated forces as
well as hydrostatic fluid pressure, both of which are actively regulated in
living matter through mechano-chemical feedback. Inspired by autonomous,
biophysical shape change, such as occurring in the model organism hydra, we
introduce a minimal, active, elastic model featuring a network of springs in a
globe-like spherical shell geometry. In this model there is coupling between
activity and the shape of the shell: if the local curvature of a filament
represented by a spring falls below a critical value, its elastic constant is
actively changed. This results in deformation of the springs that changes the
shape of the shell. By combining excitation of springs and pressure regulation,
we show that the shell undergoes a transition from spheroidal to either
elongated ellipsoidal or a different spheroidal shape, depending on pressure.
There exists a critical pressure at which there is an abrupt change from
ellipsoids to spheroids, showing that pressure is potentially a sensitive
switch for material shape. More complex shapes, involving loss of cylindrical
symmetry, can arise when springs are excited both above (spring constants
increase) and below (spring constants decrease) the curvature threshold. We
thus offer biologically inspired design principles for autonomous shape
transitions in active elastic shells.

Black phosphorus (BP) stands out among two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors
because of its high mobility and thickness dependent direct band gap. However,
the quasiparticle band structure of ultrathin BP has remained inaccessible to
experiment thus far. Here we use a recently developed laser-based micro-focus
angle resolved photoemission ($\mu$-ARPES) system to establish the electronic
structure of 2-9 layer BP from experiment. Our measurements unveil ladders of
anisotropic, quantized subbands at energies that deviate from the scaling
observed in conventional semiconductor quantum wells. We quantify the
anisotropy of the effective masses and determine universal tight-binding
parameters which provide an accurate description of the electronic structure
for all thicknesses.

<h3>Microstructure quality control of steels using deep learning</h3>

<br>
In quality control, microstructures are investigated rigorously to ensure
structural integrity, exclude the presence of critical volume defects, and
validate the formation of the target microstructure. For quenched,
hierarchically-structured steels, the morphology of the bainitic and
martensitic microstructures are of major concern to guarantee the reliability
of the material under service conditions. Therefore, industries conduct small
sample-size inspections of materials cross-sections through metallographers to
validate the needle morphology of such microstructures. We demonstrate
round-robin test results revealing that this visual grading is afflicted by
pronounced subjectivity despite the thorough training of personnel. Instead, we
propose a deep learning image classification approach that distinguishes steels
based on their microstructure type and classifies their needle length alluding
to the ISO 643 grain size assessment standard. This classification approach
facilitates the reliable, objective, and automated classification of
hierarchically structured steels. Specifically, an accuracy of 96% and roughly
91% is attained for the distinction of martensite/bainite subtypes and needle
length, respectively. This is achieved on an image dataset that contains
significant variance and labeling noise as it is acquired over more than ten
years from multiple plants, alloys, etchant applications, and light optical
microscopes by many metallographers (raters). Interpretability analysis gives
insights into the decision-making of these models and allows for estimating
their generalization capability.

<h3>Electron-phonon coupling and superconductivity in $Î±$-MoB$_2$ as a  function of pressure</h3>

<br>
<br>
We have studied the lattice dynamics, electron-phonon coupling, and
superconducting properties of $\alpha$-MoB$_2$, as a function of applied
pressure, within the framework of density functional perturbation theory using
a mixed-basis pseudopotential method. We found that phonon modes located along
the A$-$H, H$-$L, and L$-$A high-symmetry paths exhibit large phonon linewidths
and contribute significantly to the electron-phonon coupling constant. Although
linewidths are particularly large for the highest-frequency optical phonon
modes (dominated by B vibrations), their contribution to the electron-phonon
coupling constant is marginal. The latter is largely controlled by the acoustic
low-frequency modes of predominantly Mo character. It was observed that at a
pressure of $90$~GPa, where $\alpha$-MoB$_2$ forms, the phonon-mediated pairing
falls into the strong-coupling regime, and the estimate for the superconducting
critical temperature $T_c$ agrees well with experimental observations. When
further increasing the applied pressure, a reduction of $T_c$ is predicted,
which correlates with a hardening of the acoustic low-frequency phonon modes
and a decrease of the electron-phonon coupling parameter.

<br>
<br>
We present an inelastic neutron scattering study of the crystal electric
field levels in the intermetallic ferrimagnets RECo$_{5}$ (RE = Nd and Y). In
NdCo$_{5}$, measurements at $5~$K reveal two levels at approximately 28.9 and
52.9 meV. Crystal field calculations including the exchange field
$B_{\textrm{exc}}$ from the Co sites account for both of these, as well as the
spectrum at temperatures above the spin-reorientation transition at $\sim
280$~K. In particular, it is found that both a large hexagonal crystal field
parameter $A_{6}^6\langle r^6 \rangle$ and $B_{\textrm{exc}}$ are required to
reproduce the data, with the latter having a much larger value than that
deduced from previous computational and experimental studies. Our study sheds
light on the delicate interplay of terms in the rare-earth Hamiltonian of
RECo$_5$ systems, and is therefore expected to stimulate further experimental
and computational work on the broader family of rare-earth permanent magnets.

<br>
<br>
The composite particle duality extends the notions of both flux attachment
and statistical transmutation in spacetime dimensions beyond 2+1D. It
constitutes an exact correspondence that can be understood both as a framework
and as a physical mechanism. The immediate implication of the duality is that
an interacting quantum system in arbitrary dimensions can experience a
modification of its statistical properties if coupled to a certain gauge field.
In other words, commutation relations of quantum fields can be effectively
modified by a dynamical physical process. For instance, an originally bosonic
quantum fluid in $d$ spatial dimensions can feature composite fermionic (or
anyonic) excitations when coupled to a statistical gauge field. We compute the
explicit form of the aforementioned synthetic gauge fields in $\text{D}\le
3+1$. This opens the door to a new realm of topological phases both in lattice
and continuum and across dimensions.

<h3>Bulk conducting states of intrinsically doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$</h3>

<br>
<br>
With a large band gap and a single Dirac cone responsible for the topological
surface states, Bi2Se3 is widely regarded as a prototypical 3D topological
insulator. Further applications of the bulk material has, however, been
hindered by inherent structural defects that donate electrons and make the bulk
conductive. Consequently, controlling these defects is of great interest for
future technological applications, and while past literature has focused on
adding external doping elements to the mixture, a complete study on undoped
Bi2Se3 was still lacking. In this work, we use the self-flux method to obtain
high-quality Bi2Se3 single-crystals in the entire concentration range available
on the phase-diagram for the technique. By combining basic structural
characterization with measurements of the resistivity, Hall effect and
Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) quantum oscillations, the effects of these impurities
on the bulk transport are investigated in samples with electron densities
ranging from 10^17 cm^-3 to 10^19 cm^-3, from Se-rich to Bi-rich mixtures,
respectively, evidencing the transition into a degenerate semiconductor regime.
We find that electron-donor impurities, likely Se vacancies, unavoidably shift
the Fermi level up to 200 meV inside the conduction band. Other impurities,
like interstitial Bi and Se, are shown to play a significant role as scattering
centres, specially at low temperatures and in the decoherence of the SdH
oscillations. Previous open questions on Bi2Se3, such as the upturn in
resistivity below 30 K, the different scattering times in transport and quantum
oscillations, and the presence of additional low mobility bands, are addressed.
The results outlined here provide a concise picture on the bulk conducting
states in flux-grown Bi2Se3 single crystals, enabling better control of the
structural defects and electronic properties.

<br>
<br>
We consider a general system of two run-and-tumble particles interacting by
hardcore jamming on the unidimensional torus. RTP are a paradigmatic active
matter model, typically modeling the evolution of bacteria. By directly
modeling the system at the continuous-space and -time level thanks to piecewise
deterministic Markov processes (PDMP), we derive the conservation conditions
which sets the invariant distribution and explicitly construct the two
universality classes for the steady state, the detailed-jamming and the
global-jamming classes. They respectively identify with the preservation or not
of a detailed symmetry at the level of the dynamical internal states between
probability flows entering and exiting jamming configurations. Thanks to a
spectral analysis of the tumble kernel, we give explicit expressions for the
invariant measure in the general case. The non-equilibrium features exhibited
by the steady state includes positive mass for the jammed configurations and,
for the global-jamming class, exponential decay and growth terms, potentially
modulated by polynomial terms. Interestingly, we find that the invariant
measure follows, away from jamming configurations, a catenary-like constraint,
which results from the interplay between probability conservation and the
dynamical skewness introduced by the jamming interactions, seen now as a
boundary constraint. This work shows the powerful analytical approach PDMP
provide for the study of the stationary behaviors of RTP sytems and motivates
their future applications to larger systems, with the goal to derive
microscopic conditions for motility-induced phase transitions.

<br>
<br>
Nanoscale fluid transport is typically pictured in terms of atomic-scale
dynamics, as is natural in the real-space framework of molecular simulations.
An alternative Fourier-space picture, that involves the collective charge
fluctuation modes of both the liquid and the confining wall, has recently been
successful at predicting new nanofluidic phenomena such as quantum friction and
near-field heat transfer, that rely on the coupling of those fluctuations.
Here, we study the charge fluctuation modes of a two-dimensional (planar)
nanofluidic channel. Introducing confined response functions that generalize
the notion of surface response function, we show that the channel walls exhibit
coupled plasmon modes as soon as the confinement is comparable to the plasmon
wavelength. Conversely, the water fluctuations remain remarkably bulk-like,
with significant confinement effects arising only when the wall spacing is
reduced to 7 A. We apply the confined response formalism to predict the
dependence of the solid-water quantum friction and thermal boundary conductance
on channel width for model channel wall materials. Our results provide a
general framework for Coulomb interactions of fluctuating matter in nanoscale
confinement.

Moir\'e superlattices provide a highly tunable and versatile platform to
explore novel quantum phases and exotic excited states ranging from correlated
insulators1-17 to moir\'e excitons7-10,18. Scanning tunneling microscopy has
played a key role in probing microscopic behaviors of the moir\'e correlated
ground states at the atomic scale1,11-15,19. Atomic-resolution imaging of
quantum excited state in moir\'e heterostructures, however, has been an
outstanding experimental challenge. Here we develop a novel photocurrent
tunneling microscopy by combining laser excitation and scanning tunneling
spectroscopy (laser-STM) to directly visualize the electron and hole
distribution within the photoexcited moir\'e exciton in a twisted bilayer WS2
(t-WS2). We observe that the tunneling photocurrent alternates between positive
and negative polarities at different locations within a single moir\'e unit
cell. This alternating photocurrent originates from the exotic in-plane
charge-transfer (ICT) moir\'e exciton in the t-WS2 that emerges from the
competition between the electron-hole Coulomb interaction and the moir\'e
potential landscape. Our photocurrent maps are in excellent agreement with our
GW-BSE calculations for excitonic states in t-WS2. The photocurrent tunneling
microscopy creates new opportunities for exploring photoexcited non-equilibrium
moir\'e phenomena at the atomic scale.

We perform switching current measurements of planar Josephson junctions (JJs)
coupled by a common superconducting electrode, with independent control over
the two superconducting phase differences. We observe an anomalous phase shift
in the current--phase relation of a JJ as a function of gate voltage or phase
difference in the second JJ. This demonstrates a nonlocal Josephson effect, and
the implementation of a $\varphi_0$-junction which is tunable both
electrostatically and magnetically. The anomalous phase shift was larger for
shorter distances between the JJs and vanished for distances much longer than
the superconducting coherence length. Results are consistent with the
hybridization of ABSs, leading to the formation of an Andreev molecule. Our
devices constitute a realization of a tunable superconducting phase source, and
could enable new coupling schemes for hybrid quantum devices.

Geometric frustration is a fundamental concept in various areas of physics,
and its role in self-assembly processes has recently been recognized as a
source of intricate self-limited structures. Here we present an analytic theory
of the geometrically frustrated self-assembly of regular icosahedral
nanoparticle based on the non-Euclidean crystal {3, 5, 3} formed by icosahedra
in hyperbolic space. By considering the minimization of elastic and repulsion
energies, we characterize prestressed morphologies in this self-assembly
system. Notably, the morphology exhibits a transition that is controlled by the
size of the assembled cluster, leading to the spontaneous breaking of
rotational symmetry.

Synthetic dimensions, wherein dynamics occurs in a set of internal states,
have found great success in recent years in exploring topological effects in
cold atoms and photonics. However, the phenomena thus far explored have largely
been restricted to the non-interacting or weakly interacting regimes. Here, we
extend the synthetic dimensions playbook to strongly interacting systems of
Rydberg atoms prepared in optical tweezer arrays. We use precise control over
driving microwave fields to introduce a tunable $U(1)$ flux in a four-site
lattice of coupled Rydberg levels. We find highly coherent dynamics, in good
agreement with theory. Single atoms show oscillatory dynamics controllable by
the gauge field. Small arrays of interacting atoms exhibit behavior suggestive
of the emergence of ergodic and arrested dynamics in the regimes of
intermediate and strong interactions, respectively. These demonstrations pave
the way for future explorations of strongly interacting dynamics and many-body
phases in Rydberg synthetic lattices.

In quantum mechanical many-body systems, long-range and anisotropic
interactions promote rich spatial structure and can lead to quantum
frustration, giving rise to a wealth of complex, strongly correlated quantum
phases. Long-range interactions play an important role in nature; however,
quantum simulations of lattice systems have largely not been able to realize
such interactions. A wide range of efforts are underway to explore long-range
interacting lattice systems using polar molecules, Rydberg atoms, optical
cavities, and magnetic atoms. Here, we realize novel quantum phases in a
strongly correlated lattice system with long-range dipolar interactions using
ultracold magnetic erbium atoms. As we tune the dipolar interaction to be the
dominant energy scale in our system, we observe quantum phase transitions from
a superfluid into dipolar quantum solids, which we directly detect using
quantum gas microscopy. Controlling the interaction anisotropy by orienting the
dipoles enables us to realize a variety of stripe ordered states. Furthermore,
by transitioning non-adiabatically through the strongly correlated regime, we
observe the emergence of a range of metastable stripe-ordered states. This work
demonstrates that novel strongly correlated quantum phases can be realized
using long-range dipolar interaction in optical lattices, opening the door to
quantum simulations of a wide range of lattice models with long-range and
anisotropic interactions.

The activity of metal catalysts depends sensitively on dynamic structural
changes that occur during operating conditions. The mechanistic understanding
underlying such transformations in small Pt nanoparticles (NPs) of $\sim1-5$ nm
in diameter, commonly used in hydrogenation reactions, is currently far from
complete. In this study, we investigate the structural evolution of Pt NPs in
the presence of hydrogen using reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and
X-ray spectroscopy measurements. To gain atomistic insights into
adsorbate-induced structural transformation phenomena, we employ a combination
of MD based on first-principles machine-learned force fields with extended
X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements. Simulations and
experiments provide complementary information, mutual validation, and
interpretation. We obtain atomic-level mechanistic insights into
`order-disorder' structural transformations exhibited by highly dispersed
heterogeneous Pt catalysts upon exposure to hydrogen. We report the emergence
of previously unknown candidate structures in the small Pt NP limit, where
exposure to hydrogen leads to the appearance of a `quasi-icosahedral'
intermediate symmetry, followed by the formation of `rosettes' on the NP
surface. Hydrogen adsorption is found to catalyze these shape transitions by
lowering their temperatures and increasing the apparent rates, revealing the
dual catalytic and dynamic nature of interaction between nanoparticle and
adsorbate. Our study also offers a new pathway for deciphering the reversible
evolution of catalyst structure resulting from the chemisorption of reactive
species, enabling the determination of active sites and improved interpretation
of experimental results with atomic resolution.

We show that macroscopic irreversible thermodynamics for viscous fluids can
be derived from exact information-theoretic thermodynamic identities valid at
the microscale. Entropy production in particular is a measure of the loss of
many-particle correlations in the same way in which it measures the loss of
system-reservoirs correlations in stochastic thermodynamics (ST). More
specifically, we first show that boundary conditions at the macroscopic level
define a natural decomposition of the entropy production rate (EPR) in terms of
thermodynamic forces multiplying their conjugated currents, as well as a change
in suitable nonequilibrium potential that acts as a Lyapunov function in
absence of forces. At the microscale, for isolated Hamiltonian systems, we
identify the exact identities at the origin of these dissipative contributions.
Indeed, the molecular chaos hypothesis, which gives rise to the Boltzmann
equation at the mesoscale, leads to a positive rate of loss of many-particle
correlations which we identify with the Boltzmann entropy production rate. By
generalizing the Boltzmann equation to account for boundaries with nonuniform
temperature and nonzero velocity, and resorting to the Chapman--Enskog
expansion, we reproduce the macroscopic theory we started from. We also show
that an equivalent mesoscale description in terms of a linearized Boltzmann
equation obeys local detailed balance (LDB) and thus reproduces a ST theory.
Our work unambiguously demonstrates the information-theoretical origin of
thermodynamic notions of entropy and dissipation in macroscale irreversible
thermodynamics.

<h3>AC response of Chklovskii-Halperin quantum Hall step-up transformer</h3>

Chklovskii and Halperin theoretically predicted that a QPC between filling
fractions $\nu=1$ and $1/3$ could act as a DC step-up transformer with an
amplification factor of 3/2 which was observed recently in experiments. We
revisit this problem in the context of AC transport in a bilayer quantum Hall
(QH) setting. We show that the AC amplification is bounded by the DC limit of
3/2 in the presence of intra-layer electron-electron interactions alone,
however, the possibility of having interlayer interactions open up a new avenue
for amplification beyond the DC limit. This amplification can be understood in
terms of displacement current due to the presence of ambient gate electrodes.
We further show that AC conductance depicts resonances and anti-resonances
resulting purely from interlayer interactions at certain magic frequencies.

This contribution will be published in '50 years of the renormalization
group', dedicated to the memory of Michael E. Fisher, edited by Amnon Aharony,
Ora Entin-Wohlman, David Huse, and Leo Radzihovsky, World Scientific. These
personal remembrances come in three parts. The first contains a brief personal
perspective on Michael E. Fisher's contributions to science. The second tells
how I came to work with Michael and describes events while I was under his
supervision during my graduate years at Cornell University. The third part
summarizes recent work, done in collaboration with Suraj Shankar, on
thermalized buckling of isotopically compressed thin (perhaps atomically thin)
sheets of materials such as graphene or MoS$_2$. These investigations were
inspired by Michael's beautiful work on the effect of constraints at critical
points, with fluctuations at all length scales, which leads to 'Fisher
renormalization' of critical exponents. [1] Thin fluctuating sheets embedded in
three dimensions, when they are tensionless as in a cantilever or 'diving
board' geometry, are automatically at a critical point everywhere in a low
temperature flat phase. However, when we consider thin sheets supported on
multiple sides in various ways, Fisher's ideas lead to the inequivalence of
isotensional and isometric thermodynamic ensembles, which triggers dramatic
differences in some of the critical exponents associated with the two types of
boundary conditions. [2] Readers not interested in my experiences while a
student at Cornell University may only want to read parts I and III. There are
also some concluding remarks.

<h3>Topological enhancement of exciton-polariton coherence with  non-Hermitian morphing</h3>

The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has been intensely investigated over the
past few years and has unveiled new topological phases, which have no
counterparts in Hermitian systems. Here we consider the hybridization between
the NHSE in an exciton-polariton waveguide and a localized defect mode. By
tuning the non-Hermiticity, we find that the resulting ground-state of the
system is both spatially extended and energetically separated from other modes
in the system. When polariton lasing occurs in the system, we find an enhanced
spatial coherence compared to regular waveguides, which is robust in the
presence of disorder.

Ultracold polyatomic molecules offer intriguing new opportunities in cold
chemistry, precision measurements, and quantum information processing, thanks
to their rich internal structure. However, their increased complexity compared
to diatomic molecules presents a formidable challenge to employ conventional
cooling techniques. Here, we demonstrate a new approach to create ultracold
polyatomic molecules by electroassociation in a degenerate Fermi gas of
microwave-dressed polar molecules through a field-linked resonance. Starting
from ground state NaK molecules, we create around $1.1\times 10^3$ tetratomic
(NaK)$_2$ molecules, with a phase space density of $0.040(3)$ at a temperature
of $134(3)\,\text{nK}$, more than $3000$ times colder than previously realized
tetratomic molecules. We observe a maximum tetramer lifetime of
$8(2)\,\text{ms}$ in free space without a notable change in the presence of an
optical dipole trap, indicating these tetramers are collisionally stable. The
measured binding energy and lifetime agree well with parameter-free
calculations, which outlines pathways to further increase the lifetime of the
tetramers. Moreover, we directly image the dissociated tetramers through
microwave-field modulation to probe the anisotropy of their wave function in
momentum space. Our result demonstrates a universal tool for assembling
ultracold polyatomic molecules from smaller polar molecules, which is a crucial
step towards Bose--Einstein condensation (BEC) of polyatomic molecules and
towards a new crossover from a dipolar Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)
superfluid to a BEC of tetramers. Additionally, the long-lived FL state
provides an ideal starting point for deterministic optical transfer to deeply
bound tetramer states.

<h3>Improving the reliability of machine learned potentials for modeling  inhomogenous liquids</h3>

The atomic-scale response of inhomogeneous fluids at interfaces and
surrounding solute particles plays a critical role in governing chemical,
electrochemical and biological processes at such interfaces. Classical
molecular dynamics simulations have been applied extensively to simulate the
response of inhomogeneous fluids directly, and as inputs to classical density
functional theory, but are limited by the accuracy of the underlying empirical
force fields. Here, we deploy neural network potentials (NNPs) trained to
\emph{ab initio} simulations to accurately predict the inhomogeneous response
of two widely different fluids: liquid water and molten NaCl. Although the
advantages of NNPs is that they can be readily trained to model complex
systems, one limitation in modeling the inhomogeneous response of liquids is
the need for including the correct configurations of the system in the training
data. Therefore, first we establish protocols, based on molecular dynamics
simulations in external atomic potentials, to sufficiently sample the correct
configurations of inhomogeneous fluids. We show that NNPs trained to
inhomogeneous fluid configurations can predict several properties such as the
density response, surface tension and size-dependent cavitation free energies
in water and molten NaCl corresponding to \emph{ab initio} interactions, more
accurately than with empirical force fields. This work therefore provides a
first demonstration and framework for extracting the response of inhomogeneous
fluids from first principles for classical density-functional treatment of
fluids free from empirical potentials.
