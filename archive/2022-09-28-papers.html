<h3>Active Brownian particles can mimic the pattern of the substrate</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13898" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13898</a>

<br>
Active Brownian particles (ABPs) are termed out to be a successful way of
modeling the moving microorganism on the substrate. In recent studies it is
shown that such organism can sense the characteristics of substrate. Motivated
with such work we studied the dynamics and the steady state of ABP moving on a
substrate with space dependent activity. On the substrate some regions are
marked as high in activity and other regions are such that, particles behave as
passive Brownian particle. The system is studied in one and two dimensions with
Gaussian and uniform distribution of activity profile on the substrate.
Although the microscopic dynamics of ABPs does not involve any alignment
interaction but inhomogeneous activity lead to formation of ordered structure
and current along the interface of the activity profile. The whole interface of
the activity profile is divided symmetrically in two regions. The two regions
have current in two opposite directions in one-dimensional system and two
vortices of opposite helicity in two-dimensions. This lead to the flow of
particles from the active region to the passive region. The final steady state
of particle density profile very much follow the struture of the inhomogeneous
activity. Further we check the steady state density profile for various
different shapes and structure on two-dimensional substrate. Hence the
collection of ABPs on inhomogeneous substrate can mimic the inomogeneity of the
substrate.

<h3>Temperature Dependent Zero-Field Splittings in Graphene</h3>

<br>
Graphene is a quantum spin Hall insulator with a 45 $\mu$eV wide non-trivial
topological gap induced by the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. Even though this
zero-field spin splitting is weak, it makes graphene an attractive candidate
for applications in quantum technologies, given the resulting long spin
relaxation time. On the other side, the staggered sub-lattice potential,
resulting from the coupling of graphene with its boron nitride substrate,
compensates intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and decreases the non-trivial
topological gap, which may lead to the phase transition into trivial band
insulator state. In this work, we present extensive experimental studies of the
zero-field splittings in monolayer and bilayer graphene in a temperature range
2K-12K by means of sub-Terahertz photoconductivity-based electron spin
resonance technique. Surprisingly, we observe a decrease of the spin splittings
with increasing temperature. We discuss the origin of this phenomenon by
considering possible physical mechanisms likely to induce a temperature
dependence of the spin-orbit coupling. These include the difference in the
expansion coefficients between the graphene and the boron nitride substrate or
the metal contacts, the electron-phonon interactions, and the presence of a
magnetic order at low temperature. Our experimental observation expands
knowledge about the non-trivial topological gap in graphene.

<h3>Entanglement negativity in a fermionic chain with dissipative defects:  Exact results</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14164" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14164</a>
<br>
<i>Fabio Caceffo, Vincenzo Alba</i>
<br>
We investigate the dynamics of the fermionic logarithmic negativity in a
free-fermion chain with a localized loss, which acts as a dissipative impurity.
The chain is initially prepared in a generic Fermi sea. In the standard
hydrodynamic limit of large subsystems and long times, with their ratio fixed,
the negativity between two subsystems is described by a simple formula, which
depends only on the effective absorption coefficient of the impurity. The
negativity grows linearly at short times, then saturating to a volume-law
scaling. Physically, this reflects the continuous production with time of
entangling pairs of excitations at the impurity site. Interestingly, the
negativity is not the same as the R\'enyi mutual information with R\'enyi index
$1/2$, in contrast with the case of unitary dynamics. This reflects the
interplay between dissipative and unitary processes. The negativity content of
the entangling pairs is obtained in terms of an effective two-state mixed
density matrix for the subsystems. Criticality in the initial Fermi sea is
reflected in the presence of logarithmic corrections. The prefactor of the
logarithmic scaling depends on the loss rate, suggesting a nontrivial interplay
between dissipation and criticality.

<h3>Efficiency versus effort: a better way to compare best photovoltaic  research cell efficiencies?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13614" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13614</a>
<br>
<i>Phillip J. Dale, Michael A. Scarpulla</i>
<br>
Frequently, trends in record AM1.5 power-conversion efficiencies versus time
are used to analyze relative merits of different photovoltaic material
technologies. However, this approach belies the effort expended in achieving
these levels of performance. We introduce cumulative publications as a proxy
for total R&D efforts and find surprisingly that silicon, Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe),
CdTe, and halide perovskite technologies have each followed essentially the
same learning curve of 20-24% efficiency within 10,000 publications and a
consistent marginal rate of 5% efficiency per factor of 10 in publications.
While learning spillover from non-PV technologies, cross-pollination from other
PV technologies, and hidden commercial effort are not accounted for by this
metric, this analysis still yields useful and novel insights into PV technology
trajectories. Trajectories below this learning curve have required more total
effort per performance and plateaus of efficiency stagnation at large numbers
of publications may indicate (but do not guarantee) the existence of
fundamental barriers to commercially-relevant performance. Lastly, examples to
watch are identified for technologies currently exhibiting higher marginal
slopes, including some that appeared dormant by this metric in past years.

<h3>Spin Berry curvature of the Haldane model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13629" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13629</a>
<br>
<i>Simon Michel, Michael Potthoff</i>
<br>
The feedback of the geometrical Berry phase, accumulated in an electron
system, on the slow dynamics of classical degrees of freedom is governed by the
Berry curvature. Here, we study local magnetic moments, modelled as classical
spins, which are locally exchange coupled to the (spinful) Haldane model for a
Chern insulator. In the emergent equations of motion for the slow
classical-spin dynamics there is a an additional anomalous geometrical spin
torque, which originates from the corresponding spin-Berry curvature. Due to
the explicitly broken time-reversal symmetry, this is nonzero but usually small
in a condensed-matter system. We develop the general theory and compute the
spin-Berry curvature, mainly in the limit of weak exchange coupling, in various
parameter regimes of the Haldane model, particularly close to a topological
phase transition and for spins coupled to sites at the zigzag edge of the model
in a ribbon geometry. The spatial structure of the spin-Berry curvature tensor,
its symmetry properties, the distance dependence of its nonlocal elements and
further properties are discussed in detail. For the case of two classical
spins, the effect of the geometrical spin torque leads to an anomalous
non-Hamiltonian spin dynamics. It is demonstrated that the magnitude of the
spin-Berry curvature is decisively controlled by the size of the insulating
gap, the system size and the strength of local exchange coupling.

<h3>Magnetic Structure and Spin Fluctuation in Colossal Magnetoresistance  Ferrimagnet Mn3Si2Te6</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13664" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13664</a>
<br>
<i>Feng Ye, Masaaki Matsuda, Zachary Morgan, Todd Sherline, Yifei Ni, Hengdi Zhao, G. Cao</i>
<br>
The ferrimagnetic insulator Mn3Si2Te6, which features a Curie temperature Tc
at 78 K and a delicate yet consequential magnetic frustration, exhibits
colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) when the magnetic field is applied along the
magnetic hard axis, surprisingly inconsistent with existing precedents [1].
This discovery motivates a thorough single-crystal neutron diffraction study in
order to gain insights into the magnetic structure and its hidden correlation
with the new type of CMR. Here we report a noncollinear magnetic structure
below the Tc where the moments lie predominantly within the basal plane but
tilt toward the c axis by ~ 10o at ambient conditions. A strong magnetic
diffuse scattering decays slowly and persists well above the Tc, with which the
electrical resistivity is strongly correlated. Application of magnetic field
along the c axis, renders a swift occurrence CMR but only a slow tilting of the
magnetic moments toward the c axis. The unparalleled changes indicate a
non-consequential role of magnetic polarization.

<h3>Thermo-induced motional Stark effect on magnetoexciton energy spectra in  monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13682" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13682</a>
<br>
<i>Duy-Nhat Ly, Dai-Nam Le, Ngoc-Hung Phan, Van-Hoang Le</i>
<br>
Although energy spectra of an exciton in monolayer transition-metal
dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with a magnetic field were measured at different
temperatures, the theoretical calculations have been performed, neglecting the
temperature effect till now. In the present work, we suggest a new mechanism
that allows the thermal motion of the exciton's center of mass to affect the
exciton energies. We first recall that the center of mass (c.m.) of a two-body
system in a magnetic field is no longer free and then use a non-trivial scheme
for its separation. The obtained equation for the relative motion contains a
specific term (related to the motional Stark effect) proportional to the c.m.
pseudomomentum, whose average, in turn, is related to the temperature of the
exciton gas. By solving the Schrodinger equation without omitting the motional
Stark potential, we show that the thermo-induced effect on the exciton energies
is significant enough for experimental detection. The symmetry breaking of the
system due to the additional term and the thermo-induced effect on the exciton
radius and diamagnetic coefficient are also discussed by examining the wave
functions. Some consequences are studied, especially the enhancement of exciton
lifetime and the appearance of new peaks in the absorption spectra besides
those of the s-states. This study could fill the gap between the present
theoretical calculations and experimental measurements on energy spectra of
magnetoexciton in monolayer TMDCs at finite temperatures.

<h3>The Fate of the Upper Polariton: Breakdown of the Quasiparticle Picture  in the Continuum</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13698" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13698</a>
<br>
<i>Yesenia A. García Jomaso, Brenda Vargas, David Ley Dominguez, César L. Ordoñez-Romero, Hugo A. Lara-García, Arturo Camacho-Guardian, Giuseppe Pirruccio</i>
<br>
Organic polaritons resulting from the strong hybridisation between photons
and matter excitations have arisen as a suitable platform to device
light-matter technological interfaces at room temperature. Despite their
inherent complexity, organic polaritons are commonly regarded as coherent
light-matter excitations that can be described in terms of Landau's
quasiparticle approach. Here, we experimentally unveil the role of incoherent
matter excitations on the polaritons by exploring the relevant energy-momentum
parameter space. We demonstrate the emergence of a well-defined lower polariton
branch and an intriguing fading of the upper polariton at its entrance to a
continuum of matter excitations. This marks the breakdown of the simplistic
quasiparticle picture for this branch and the formation of a more complex
quantum state. Our experimental results are sustained by a general theoretical
framework that allows understanding the light-matter hybridisation beyond the
quasiparticle approach. Our work expands the understanding of organic
polaritons in all their complexity and increases their technological
significance.

<h3>A data driven approach for cross-slip modelling in continuum dislocation  dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13700" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13700</a>
<br>
<i>Vignesh Vivekanandan, Ben Anglin, Anter El-Azab</i>
<br>
Cross-slip is a thermally activated process by which screw dislocation
changes its glide plane to another slip plane sharing the same Burgers vector.
The rate at which this process happens is determined by a Boltzmann type
expression that is a function of the screw segment length and the stress acting
on the dislocation. In continuum dislocation dynamics (CDD), the information
regarding the length of the screw dislocation segment and local stress state on
dislocations are lost due to the coarse-grained representation of the density.
In this work, a data driven approach to characterize the lost information by
analyzing the discrete dislocation configurations is proposed to enable
cross-slip modeling in the CDD framework in terms of the coarse-grained
dislocation density and stress fields. The analysis showed that the screw
segment length follows an exponential distribution, and the stress
fluctuations, defined as the difference between the stress on the dislocations
and the mean field stress in CDD, follows a Lorentzian distribution. A novel
approach for cross slip implementation in CDD employing the screw segment
length and stress fluctuation statistics was proposed and rigorously tested by
comparing the CDD cross-slip rates with discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD)
rates. This approach has been applied in conjunction with three cross-slip
models used in DDD simulations differing mainly in the functional form of cross
slip activation energy. It was found that different cross-slip activation
energy formulations yielded different cross-slip rates, yet the effect on
mechanical stress-strain response and dislocation density evolution was minimal
for the [001] type loading.

<h3>Enhanced thermalization of exciton-polaritons in optically generated  potentials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13703" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13703</a>
<br>
<i>Yoseob Yoon, Jude Deschamps, Mark Steger, Ken W. West, David W. Snoke, Keith A. Nelson</i>
<br>
Equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation of exciton-polaritons, demonstrated
with a long-lifetime microcavity [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 016602 (2017)], has
proven that driven-dissipative systems can undergo thermodynamic phase
transitions in the limit where the quasiparticle lifetime exceeds the
thermalization time. Here, we identify the role of dimensionality and polariton
interactions in determining the degree of thermalization in optically generated
traps. To distinguish the effect of trapping from interactions and lifetimes,
we measured the polariton distribution under four nonresonant Gaussian pumps in
a square geometry and compared it with polariton distributions measured with
each pump individually. We found that significant redistribution of polaritons
arises by trapping and modification of the density of states. Surprisingly
efficient polariton-polariton scattering below the condensation threshold is
evidenced by the depletion of the inflection-point polaritons. Our work
provides a deeper understanding of polariton distributions and their
interactions under various geometries of optically generated potentials.

<h3>Stochastic model for barrier crossings and fluctuations in local  timescale</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13721" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13721</a>
<br>
<i>Rajeev Bhaskaran, Vijay Ganesh Sadhasivam</i>
<br>
The problem of computing the rate of diffusion-aided activated barrier
crossings between metastable states is one of broad relevance in physical
sciences. The transition path formalism aims to compute the rate of these
events by analysing the statistical properties of the transition path between
the two metastable regions concerned. In this paper, we show that the
transition path process is a unique solution to an associated stochastic
differential equation (SDE), with a discontinuous and singular drift term. The
singularity arises from a local time contribution, which accounts for the
fluctuations at the boundaries of the metastable regions. The presence of
fluctuations at the local time scale calls for an excursion theoretic
consideration of barrier crossing events. We show that the rate of such events,
as computed from excursion theory, factorizes into a local time term and an
excursion measure term, which bears empirical similarity to the transition
state theory rate expression. Since excursion theory makes no assumption about
the presence of a transition state in the potential energy landscape, the
mathematical structure underlying this factorization ought to be general. We
hence expect excursion theory (and local times) to provide some physical and
mathematical insights in generic barrier crossing problems.

<h3>Carbon-based single photon emitters in hexagonal boron nitride with  triplet ground state</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13735" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13735</a>
<br>
<i>Fernanda Pinilla, Nicolas Vasquez, Jerónimo R. Maze, Carlos Cárdenas, Francisco Munoz</i>
<br>
Most single photon emitters in hexagonal boron nitride has been identified as
carbon-based defects. These defects, when forming a donor-acceptor pair have
spin $S\leq \frac{1}{2}$. By means of density functional calculations, we show
that two non-adjacent carbon substitutional defects of the same type (i.e.
C$_\mathrm{B}$-C$_\mathrm{B}$, and C$_\mathrm{N}$-C$_\mathrm{N}$), can have a
triplet ground state. In particular, one of such defects has a zero phonon line
energy of 2.5 eV, and its triplet state is nearly 0.5 eV more stable than its
singlet.

<h3>Tunable Exciton-Hybridized Magnon Interactions in a Layered  Semiconductor</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13744" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13744</a>
<br>
<i>Geoffrey M. Diederich, John Cenker, Yafei Ren, Jordan Fonseca, Daniel G. Chica, Youn Jue Bae, Xiaoyang Zhu, Xavier Roy, Ting Cao, Di Xiao, Xiaodong Xu</i>
<br>
The interaction between distinct excitations in solids is of both fundamental
interest and technological importance. One example of such interactions is
coupling between an exciton, a Coulomb bound electron-hole pair, and a magnon,
a collective spin excitation. The recent emergence of van der Waals magnetic
semiconductors provides a powerful platform for exploring these exciton-magnon
interactions and their fundamental properties, such as strong correlation, as
well as their photo-spintronic and quantum transduction applications. Here we
demonstrate precise control of coherent exciton-magnon interactions in the
layered magnetic semiconductor CrSBr. We show that by controlling the direction
of applied magnetic fields relative to the crystal axes, and thus the
rotational symmetry of the magnetic system, we can tune not only the exciton
coupling to the bright magnon, but also to an optically dark mode via magnon
hybridization. The exciton-magnon coupling and associated magnon dispersion
curves can be further modulated by applying a uniaxial strain. At the critical
strain, a dispersionless dark magnon band emerges. Our results demonstrate
unprecedented control of the opto-mechanical-magnonic coupling, and a step
towards the predictable and controllable implementation of hybrid quantum
magnonics.

<h3>Frustrated superconductivity and "charge-6e" ordering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13745" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13745</a>
<br>
<i>Zhiming Pan, Chen Lu, Fan Yang, Congjun Wu</i>

We propose a mechanism of charge-6e superconductivity (SC) via fluctuation of
chiral pair density wave (PDW) order, characterized by a spatial modulation of
superconducting pairing order parameter. Due to time-reversal symmetry
breaking, an Ising-type variable can be defined to describe the ground-state
degeneracy, known as chirality. The distribution of the chiral pairing order
parameter forms a vortex-antivortex kagome lattice in the real space. This
lattice can be mapped into a three-color model on the honeycomb lattice, where
the superconducting pairing phases defined on the lattice sites are coupled
with the discrete gauge field of color variables defined on the bonds. The
classical ground state manifold of this model has a macroscopic degeneracy for
the configurations of the color variables, resulting in an extensive entropy.
The resultant color-variable fluctuations kill the PDW order but keep the
charge-6e superconducting order above the Tc of the PDW. Consequently, the
1/3-fractional fluxes emerge, due to the mismatch in the color-variable
configuration caused by its fluctuations, which can be compensated by the
external magnetic fluxes to lower the free energy. This result is related to
the recent Little-Parks experiment done on the CsV3Sb5 superconductor.

We study the equilibrium density profile of particles in two one-dimensional
classical integrable models, namely hard rods and the hyperbolic Calogero
model, placed in confining potentials. For both of these models the
inter-particle repulsion is strong enough to prevent particle trajectories from
intersecting. We use field theoretic techniques to compute the density profile
and their scaling with system size and temperature, and compare them with
results from Monte-Carlo simulations. In both cases we find good agreement
between the field theory and simulations. We also consider the case of the Toda
model in which inter-particle repulsion is weak and particle trajectories can
cross. In this case, we find that a field theoretic description is ill-suited
due to the lack of a thermodynamic length scale. The density profiles for the
Toda model obtained from Monte-Carlo simulations can be understood by studying
the analytically tractable harmonic chain model (Hessian approximation of the
Toda model). For the harmonic chain model one can derive an exact expression
for the density that shines light on some of the qualitative features of the
Toda model in a quadratic trap. Our work provides an analytical approach
towards understanding the equilibrium properties for interacting integrable
systems in confining traps.

<h3>Unusual electric polarization behavior in elemental quasi-2D allotropes  of selenium</h3>

<br>
<i>Dan Liu, Lin Han, Ran Wei, Shixin Song, Jie Guan, Shuai Dong, David Tomanek</i>
<br>
We investigate tunable electric polarization and electronic structure of
quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) allotropes of selenium, which are formed from
their constituent one-dimensional (1D) structures through an inter-chain
interaction facilitated by the multi-valence nature of Se. Our em ab initio
calculations reveal that different quasi-2D Se allotropes display different
types of electric polarization, including ferroelectric (FE) polarization
normal to the chain direction in alpha and delta allotropes, non-collinear
ferrielectric (FiE) polarization along the chain axis in tau-Se, and
anti-ferroelectric (AFE) polarization in eta-Se. The magnitude and direction of
the polarization can be changed by a previously unexplored rotation of the
constituent chains. In that case, an in-plane polarization direction may change
to out-of-plane in alpha-Se and delta-Se, flip its direction, and even
disappear in tau-Se. Also, the band gap may be reduced and changed from
indirect to direct by rotating the constituent chains about their axes in these
quasi-2D Se allotropes.

<h3>Tunneling magnetoresistance and spin-valley polarization of aperiodic  magnetic silicene superlattices</h3>

<br>
Magnetic silicene superlattices (MSSLs) are versatile structures with
spin-valley polarization and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) capabilities.
However, the oscillating transport properties related to the superlattice
periodicity impede stable spin-valley polarization states reachable by
reversing the magnetization direction. Here, we show that aperiodicity can be
used to improve the spin-valley polarization and TMR by reducing the
characteristic conductance oscillations of periodic MSSLs (P-MSSLs). Using the
Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism and the transfer matrix method, we investigate
the spin-valley polarization and the TMR of Fibonacci (F-) and Thue-Morse (TM-)
MSSLs as typical aperiodic superlattices. Our findings indicate that aperiodic
superlattices with higher disorder provide better spin-valley polarization and
TMR values. In particular, TM-MSSLs reduce considerably the conductance
oscillations giving rise to two well-defined spin-valley polarization states
and a better TMR than F- and P-MSSLs. F-MSSLs also improve the spin-valley
polarization and TMR, however they depend strongly on the parity of the
superlattice generation.

<i>Xiaohui Wang, Li Liang, Xiao Li</i>
<br>
To date, a number of valley materials have been discovered with the
spin-valley or valley-layer couplings. It is highly desirable to realize the
interplay of more electronic degrees of freedom in a valley material. Based on
the first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the valley and spin
degeneracy liftings in the band structure of a TiSiCO monolayer, with the help
of the selective expression of the layer pseudospin via atomic adsorption. The
introduction of the transition-metal adatoms provides an effective electric
field and magnetic proximity effect, giving rise to the valley and spin
splittings. These splittings can be further tuned by applying an external
electric field. According to the modified band structure, various interlayer
excitons with different combinations of spins and electric dipoles are
selectively created, under the optical field of appropriate frequencies. The
tunable spin and valley splittings in atom adsorbed TiSiCO monolayer offer
opportunities for exploring the interactions between spin, valley and layer
pseudospin, and designing advanced optoelectronic devices.

<i>Byungmin Sohn, Changyoung Kim</i>
<br>
Transition metal perovskite oxides display a variety of emergent phenomena
which are tunable by tailoring the oxygen octahedral rotation. SrRuO$_3$, a
ferromagnetic perovskite oxide, is well-known to have various atomic structures
and octahedral rotations when grown as thin films. However, how the electronic
structure changes with the film thickness has been hardly studied. Here, by
using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and electron diffraction
techniques, we study the electronic structure of SrRuO$_3$ thin films as a
function of the film thickness. Different reconstructed electronic structures
and spectral weights are observed for films with various thicknesses. We
suggest that octahedral rotations on the surface can be qualitatively estimated
via comparison of intensities of different bands. Our observation and
methodology shed light on how structural variation and transition may be
understood in terms of photoemission spectroscopy data.

Machine learning potentials (MLPs) developed from extensive datasets

<br>
Distribution of write error rate (WER) of spin-transfer-torque
magnetoreistive random access memory (STT MRAM) caused by a distribution of
resistance area product and anisotropy constant is theoretically studied.
Assuming that WER is much smaller than unity, and junction parameters obey a
normal distribution, we show that the WER obeys a logarithmic normal
distribution. We derive analytical expressions for the probability density
function and statistical measures. We find that the coefficient of variation of
WER can be reduced by decreasing the pulse width. We also perform numerical
simulations based on the Fokker-Planck equation and confirm the validity of the
analytical expressions. The results are useful for designing reliable STT
MRAMs.

<br>
A gap exists in microscopic understanding the dynamic properties of the
rotational organic cation (ROC) in the inorganic framework of the metal halide
perovskites (MHP) to date. Herein, we develop a microscopic theory of Raman
scattering for the ROC in MHP based on the angular momentum of a ROC exchanging
with that of the photon and phonon. We systematically present the selection
rules for the angular momentum transfer among three lowest rotational levels.
We find that the phonon angular momentum that arising from the inorganic
framework and its specific values could be directly manifested by Stokes (or
anti-Stokes) shift. Moreover, the initial orientation of the ROC and its
preferentially rotational directions could be judged in Raman spectra. This
study lays the theoretical foundation for the high-precision resolution and
manipulation of molecular rotation immersed in many-body environment by Raman
technique.

<br>
The crystal structure of solid-state materials with unique lattices is
considered one of the main factors determining physical properties, including
superconductivity. Materials with honeycomb lattices have inspired intense
research interest for their novel properties. A previously unknown compound,
Ta4CoSi, are discussed herein and its crystal structure and superconducting
properties. It crystallizes in a CuAl2-type structure (space group P4/mcm, No.
124) with the lattice parameters a = b = 6.17755(7){\AA} and c = 4.98443(8)
{\AA}, featuring honeycomb networks of Ta-Ta in (110) plane. Superconductivity
is observed below the critical temperature of 2.45 K, while lower and upper
critical magnetic fields are 9.86 mT and 0.84 T, respectively. Experiments and
theoretical calculations show that the honeycomb lattices significantly
influence the superconducting properties. This material may thus provide a new
platform for investigating the exotic superconductivity of honeycomb networks.

The $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the floret-pentagonal lattice with
two kinds of interaction strength is studied by the numerical-diagonalization
method. It is known that, near the five-ninth of the saturation magnetization,
this system shows a magnetization jump that is not accompanied by magnetization
plateaux. We focus our attention on the behavior of this system around the
five-ninth of the saturation magnetization; the changes of the magnetization
jump and plateau at and around this magnetization are clarified from the
diagonalization data for finite-size systems up to 45 sites.

<h3>Slow and fast particles in shear-driven jamming: critical behavior</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13895" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13895</a>
<br>
<i>Peter Olsson</i>
<br>
We do extensive simulations of a simple model of shear-driven jamming in two
dimensions to analyze the velocity distribution at different densities $\phi$
around the jamming density $\phi_J$ and at different low shear strain rates,
$\dot\gamma$. We then find that the velocity distribution is made up of two
parts which are related to two different physical processes which we call the
slow process and the fast process as they are dominated by the slower and the
faster particles, respectively. Earlier scaling analyses have shown that the
shear viscosity $\eta$, which diverges as the jamming density is approached
from below, consists of two different terms and we present strong evidence that
these terms are related to the two different processes: the leading divergence
is due to the fast process whereas the correction-to-scaling term is due to the
slow process. The analysis of the slow process is possible thanks to the
observation that the velocity distribution for different $\dot\gamma$ and
$\phi$ at and around the shear-driven jamming transition, has a peak at low
velocities and that the distribution has a constant shape up to and slightly
above this peak. We then find that it is possible to express the contribution
to the shear viscosity due to the slow process in terms of height and position
of the peak in the velocity distribution and find that this contribution
matches the correction-to-scaling term, determined through a standard critical
scaling analysis. A further observation is that the collective particle motion
is dominated by the slow process. In contrast to the usual picture in critical
phenomena with a direct link between the diverging correlation length and a
diverging order parameter, we find that correlations and shear viscosity
decouple since they are controlled by different sets of particles and that
shear-driven jamming is thus an unusual kind of critical phenomenon.

demonstrate the ability to generate nonlinear surface acoustic waves (SAWs) in
Nb:SrTiO3 substrates, at typically 1 kHz repetition rate, with associated
strains in the percent range. This study paves the way for the investigation of
a host of high-strength SAW-induced phenomena, including phase transitions,

wavefunction takes a similar structure to the BCS wavefunction for charge 2$e$
superconductors. The mean-field Hamiltonian and the Green's functions of charge
4$e$ are constructed. The physical properties including the density of states,
gauge invariance, flux quantization and Josephson effects are systematically
studied. All these results form a microscopic description of the charge 4$e$ SC
and can be served as the hallmarks for experimental verifications.

Three-parametric Lenard-Jones and Morse interatomic potentials are the
simplest ones, which that can be used to obtain thermophysical properties of
the liquid and solid substances. Upon adjusting the model parameters to real
substance properties, the interatomic potentials can be used to describe simple
mono-component substance with good accuracy. Usually, these tree parameters can
be found from the cohesion energy, bulk moduli and the molar volume data or the
lattice parameters, obtained experimentally for pure chemically crystalline
materials. In our paper, in case of chemically different atoms, for both the
Lenard-Jones potential type and the Morse ones, or any other three-parametric
potential type, we propose some convenient model relationships expressing the
corresponding three parameters through the previously found ones for pure
chemical elements.

<br>
We report a high throughput computational search for two-dimensional
ferroelectric materials. The starting point is 252 pyroelectric materials from
the computational 2D materials database (C2DB) and from these we identify 64
ferroelectric materials by explicitly constructing adiabatic paths connecting
states of reversed polarization. In particular we find 49 materials with
in-plane polarization, 8 materials with out-of-plane polarization and 6
materials with coupled in-plane and out-of-plane polarization. Most of the
known 2D ferroelectrics are recovered by the screening and the far majority of
the new predicted ferroelectrics are known as bulk van der Waals bonded
compounds, which implies that these could be experimentally accessible by
direct exfoliation. For roughly 25{\%} of the materials we find a metastable
state in the non-polar structure, which could have important consequences for
the thermodynamical properties and may imply a first order transition to the
polar phase. Finally, we list the magnetic pyroelectrics extracted from the
C2DB and focus on the case of VAgP$_2$Se$_6$, which exhibits a three-state
switchable polarization vector that is strongly coupled to the magnetic
excitation spectrum.

Physical reservoir computing is a computational paradigm that enables
spatio-temporal pattern recognition to be performed directly in matter. The use
of physical matter leads the way towards energy-efficient devices capable of
solving machine learning problems without having to build a system of millions
of interconnected neurons. We propose a high performance "skyrmion mixture
reservoir" that implements the reservoir computing model with multi-dimensional
inputs. We show that our implementation solves spoken digit classification
tasks at the nanosecond timescale, with an overall model accuracy of 97.4% and
a less that 1% word error rate; the best performance ever reported for
in-materio reservoir computers. Due to the quality of the results and the low
power properties of magnetic texture reservoirs, we argue that skyrmion fabrics
are a compelling candidate for reservoir computing.

Surface acoustic waves at frequencies beyond a few GHz are promising
components for quantum technology applications. Applying scanning X-ray
diffraction microcopy we directly map the locally resolved components of the
three-dimensional strain field generated by a standing surface acoustic wave on
GaAs with wavelength $\lambda\simeq500\,$nm corresponding to frequencies near 6
GHz. We find that the lattice distortions perpendicular to the surface are
phase-shifted compared to those in propagation direction. Model calculations
based on Rayleigh waves confirm our measurements. Our results represent a break

Solid state batteries can be built based on thiophosphate electrolytes such
as beta-Li3PS4. For the preparation of these electrolytes, various
solvent-based routes have been reported. For recycling of end-of-life solid
state batteries based on such thiophosphates, we consider the development of
dissolution and recrystallization strategies for the recovery of the model
compound beta-Li3PS4. We show that recrystallization can only be performed in
polar, slightly protic solvents such as N-methylformamide (NMF). The
recrystallization is comprehensively studied, showing that it proceeds via an
intermediate phase with composition Li3PS4*2NMF, which is structurally
characterized. This phase has a high resistivity for the transport of lithium
ions and must be removed in order to obtain a recrystallized product with a
conductivity similar to the pristine material. Moreover, the recrystallization
from solution results in an increase of the amorphous phase fraction next to
crystalline beta-Li3PS4, which results in a decrease of the activation energy
to 0.2 eV compared to 0.38 eV for the pristine phase.

Crystallization is one of the most important physicochemical processes which
has relevance in material science, biology, and the environment. Decades of
experimental and theoretical efforts have been made to understand this
fundamental symmetry-breaking transition. While experiments provide equilibrium
structures and shapes of crystals, they are limited to unraveling how molecules
aggregate to form crystal nuclei that subsequently transform into bulk
crystals. Computer simulations, mainly molecular dynamics (MD), can provide
such microscopic details during the early stage of a crystallization event.
Crystallization is a rare event that takes place in timescales much longer than
a typical equilibrium MD simulation can sample. This inadequate sampling of the
MD method can be easily circumvented by the use of enhanced sampling (ES)
simulations. An ES method enhances the fluctuations of a system's slow degrees
of freedom, called collective variables (CVs), by applying a bias potential,
and thereby transforms the system from one state to the other within a short
timescale. The most crucial part of an ES method is to find suitable CVs which
often needs intuition and several trial-and-error optimization steps. Over the
years, a plethora of CVs has been developed and applied in the study of
crystallization. In this review, we provide a brief overview of CVs that have
been developed and used in ES simulations to study crystallization from melt or
solution. These CVs can be categorized mainly into four types: (i) spherical
particle-based, (ii) molecular template-based, (iii) physical property-based,
and (iv) CVs obtained from dimensionality reduction techniques. We present the
context-based evolution of CVs, discuss the current challenges, and propose
future directions to further develop effective CVs for the study of
crystallization of complex systems.

Cylindrical magnetic nanowires are promising systems for the development of
three-dimensional spintronic devices. Here, we simulate the evolution of
magnetic states during fabrication of strongly-coupled cylindrical nanowires
with varying degrees of overlap. By varying the separation between wires, the
relative strength of exchange and magnetostatic coupling can be tuned. Hence
leading to the formation of six fundamental states as a function of both
inter-wire separation and wire height. In particular, two complex
three-dimensional magnetic states, a 3D Landau Pattern and a Helical Domain
wall, are observed to emerge for intermediate overlap. The competition of
magnetic interactions and the parallel growth scheme we follow (growing both
wires at the same time) favours the formation of these anti-parallel metastable
states. This works shows how the engineering of strongly coupled 3D
nanostructures with competing interactions can be used to create complex spin
textures.

<i>Pavel Buividovich, Johann Ostmeyer</i>
<br>
We put the Density-of-States (DoS) approach to Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations
under a stress test by applying it to a physical problem with the worst
possible sign problem: the real time evolution of a non-integrable quantum spin
chain. Benchmarks against numerical exact diagonalisation and stochastic
reweighting are presented. Both MC methods, the DoS approach and reweighting,
allow for simulations of spin chains as long as $L=40$, far beyond exact
diagonalisability, though only for short evolution times $t\lesssim 1$. We
identify discontinuities of the density of states as one of the key problems in
the MC simulations and propose to calculate some of the dominant contributions
analytically, increasing the precision of our simulations by several orders of
magnitude. Even after these improvements the density of states is found highly
non-smooth and therefore the DoS approach cannot outperform reweighting. We
prove this implication theoretically and provide numerical evidence, concluding
that the DoS approach is not well suited for quantum real time simulations with
discrete degrees of freedom.

We study the transport properties of a diffusive Josephson junction between
two spin-split superconductors made of superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator
bilayers (FIS) on top of a 3D topological insulator (TI). We derive the
corresponding Usadel equation describing the quasiclassical Green's functions
in these systems and first solve the equation analytically in the
weak-proximity case. We demonstrate the appearance of an anomalous phase in the
absence of an external magnetic field. We also explore non-reciprocal
electronic transport. Specifically, we calculate the junction's diode
efficiency $\eta$ by solving the Usadel equation. We obtain a sizable diode
effect even at zero applied magnetic field. We discuss how the diode efficiency
$\eta$ depends on the different parameters and find a non-monotonic behavior of
$\eta$ with temperature.

resistivity and magnetic susceptibility in a spin-1/2 (BEDT-TTF)$^{\bullet +}$
monomer Mott insulator (BEDT-TTF)Cu[N(CN)$_2$]$_2$. The band calculations
indicate a Dirac semimetal state with nodal lines at the Fermi level. The
resistivity and the magnetic susceptibility as functions of temperature are
well interpreted in terms of the monomer Mott insulating state instead of the
expected semimetal state probably owing to strong electron correlation. In
addition, we find that an Arrhenius-type steep reduction of the paramagnetic
susceptibility appears below approximately 25 K, which indicates a spin-singlet
ground state.

<h3>Strong Majorana evidence of a vortex from scanning tunneling microscopy  with a dissipative environment</h3>

<br>
It is predicted that a vortex in a topological superconductor contains a
Majorana zero mode (MZM). The confirmative Majorana signature, i.e., the
$2e^2/h$ quantized conductance, however is easily sabotaged by unavoidable
interruptions, e.g. instrument broadening, non-Majorana signal, and extra
particle channels. We propose to avoid the signal interruption by introducing
disorder-induced dissipation that couples to the tip-sample tunneling. With
dissipation involved, we highlight three features, each of which alone can
provide a strong evidence to identify MZM. Firstly, dissipation suppresses a
finite-energy Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) conductance peak into a valley,
while it does not split MZM zero-bias conductance peak. Secondly, we predict a
dissipation-dependent scaling feature of the zero-bias conductance peak.
Thirdly, the introduced dissipation manifests the MZM signal by suppressing
non-topological CdGM modes. Importantly, the observation of these features does
not require a quantized conductance value $2e^2/h$.

The off-normal ion irradiation of semiconductor materials is seen to induce
nanopatterning effects. Different theories are suggested to explain the
self-reorganization of the surface. One of the prominent ones associates
formation of nanopatterning with the changes of sputtering characteristics
caused by changes in surface morphology. At ultra-low energy, when sputtering
is negligible, the Si surface has still been seen to re-organize forming
surface ripples with the wave vector either aligned with the ion beam direction
or perpendicular to it.
Recent molecular dynamics simulations have explained formation of parallel
mode ripples on Si surface under 30 eV Ar ion irradiation, however, the cause
of ripple formation in perpendicular mode under grazing incidence has not been
elucidated yet. In this work,we investigate the formation of perpendicular-mode
ripples using molecular dynamics, obtaining insights of the process and a good
agreement with experiments.

<h3>Trajectory dependence of electronic energy-loss straggling at keV ion  energies</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14027" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14027</a>
<br>
<i>Svenja Lohmann, Radek Holeňák, Pedro L. Grande, Daniel Primetzhofer</i>
<br>
We measured the electronic energy-loss straggling of protons, helium, boron
and silicon ions in silicon using a time-of-flight approach. Ions with
velocities 0.25 - 1.6 times the Bohr velocity were transmitted through
single-crystalline Si(100) nanomembranes in either channelling or random
geometry to study the trajectory dependence of energy-loss straggling. Nuclear
and path length contributions were determined with the help of Monte Carlo
simulations. Our results exhibit an increase in straggling with increasing ion
velocity for channelled trajectories for all projectiles as well as for protons
and helium in random geometry. For heavier ions, electronic straggling at low
velocities does not decrease further but plateaus and even seems to increase
again. A satisfying agreement between experiment and transport cross section
calculations for helium shows that energy deposition of light ions is dominated
by electron-hole pair excitations. No agreement is found for boron and silicon
indicating that local electron-promotion and charge-exchange events
significantly contribute to energy loss at low velocities.

<br>
When metal surfaces are exposed to hydrogen ion irradiation, the light ions
are expected to penetrate deep into the material and dissolve in the matrix.
However, these atoms are seen to cause significant modification of surfaces,
indicating that they accumulate in vicinity of the surface. The process known
as blistering may reduces the vacuum dielectric strength above the metal
surface, which shows a dense population of surface blisters. In this paper, we
investigate how a bubble can grow under the pressure exerted by hydrogen atoms
on the walls of the bubble and how this affect to the surface of Cu, whether an
external electric field is applied or not.

<h3>Two-dimensional coherent spectrum of interacting spinons from  matrix-product states</h3>

<br>
We compute numerically the second and third order nonlinear magnetic
susceptibilities of an Ising ladder model in the context of two-dimensional
coherent spectroscopy by using the infinite time-evolving block decimation
method. The Ising ladder model couples a quantum Ising chain to a bath of
polarized spins, thereby effecting the decay of spinon excitations. We show
that its third order susceptibility contains a robust spinon echo signal in the
weak coupling regime, which appears in the two-dimensional coherent spectrum as
a highly anisotropic peak in the frequency plane. The spinon echo peak reveals
the dynamical properties of the spinons. In particular, the spectral peak
corresponding to the high energy spinons, which couple to the bath, is
suppressed with increasing coupling, whereas those do not show no significant
changes.

<h3>Spatial characterization of the edge barrier in wide superconducting  films</h3>

<i>A. G. Sivakov, O. G. Turutanov, A. E. Kolinko, A. S. Pokhila</i>
<br>
The current-induced destruction of superconductivity is discussed in wide
superconducting thin film strips, whose width is greater than the magnetic
field penetration depth, in weak magnetic fields. Particular attention is paid
to the role of the edge potential barrier (the Bean-Livingston barrier) in
critical state formation and detection of the edge responsible for this
critical state with different mutual orientations of external perpendicular
magnetic field and transport current. Critical and resistive states of the thin
film strip were visualized using the space-resolving low-temperature laser
scanning microscopy (LTLSM) method, which enables detection of critical
current-determining areas on the thin film edges. Based on these observations,
a simple technique was developed for investigation of the critical state
separately at each film edge, and for the estimation of residual magnetic
fields in cryostats. The proposed method only requires recording of the
current-voltage characteristics of the thin film in a weak magnetic field, thus
circumventing the need for complex LTLSM techniques. Information thus obtained
is particularly important for interpretation of studies of superconducting thin
film single-photon light emission detectors.

<h3>Reinforcement Learning with Tensor Networks: Application to Dynamical  Large Deviations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14089" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14089</a>
<br>
<i>Edward Gillman, Dominic C. Rose, Juan P. Garrahan</i>
<br>
We present a framework to integrate tensor network (TN) methods with
reinforcement learning (RL) for solving dynamical optimisation tasks. We
consider the RL actor-critic method, a model-free approach for solving RL
problems, and introduce TNs as the approximators for its policy and value
functions. Our "actor-critic with tensor networks" (ACTeN) method is especially
well suited to problems with large and factorisable state and action spaces. As
an illustration of the applicability of ACTeN we solve the exponentially hard
task of sampling rare trajectories in two paradigmatic stochastic models, the
East model of glasses and the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), the
latter being particularly challenging to other methods due to the absence of
detailed balance. With substantial potential for further integration with the
vast array of existing RL methods, the approach introduced here is promising
both for applications in physics and to multi-agent RL problems more generally.

<h3>First Principles Study of the Electronic Structure of the  Ni$_2$MnIn/InAs and Ti$_2$MnIn/InSb interfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14101" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14101</a>
<br>
<i>Brett Heischmidt, Maituo Yu, Derek Dardzinski, James Etheridge, Saeed Moayedpour, Vlad S. Pribiag, Paul A. Crowell, Noa Marom</i>
<br>
We present a first-principles study of the electronic and magnetic properties
of epitaxial interfaces between the Heusler compounds Ti$_2$MnIn and Ni$_2$MnIn
and the III-V semiconductors, InSb and InAs, respectively. We use density
functional theory (DFT) with a machine-learned Hubbard $U$ correction
determined by Bayesian optimization. We evaluate these interfaces for
prospective applications in Majorana-based quantum computing and spintronics.
In both interfaces, states from the Heusler penetrate into the gap of the
semiconductor, decaying within a few atomic layers. The magnetic interactions
at the interface are weak and local in space and energy. Magnetic moments of
less than 0.1 $\mu_B$ are induced in the two atomic layers closest to the
interface. The induced spin polarization around the Fermi level of the
semiconductor also decays within a few atomic layers. The decisive factor for
the induced spin polarization around the Fermi level of the semiconductor is
the spin polarization around the Fermi level in the Heusler, rather than the
overall magnetic moment. As a result, the ferrimagnetic narrow-gap
semiconductor Ti$_2$MnIn induces a more significant spin polarization in the
InSb than the ferromagnetic metal Ni$_2$MnIn induces in the InAs. This is
explained by the position of the transition metal $d$ states in the Heusler
with respect to the Fermi level. Based on our results, these interfaces are
unlikely to be useful for Majorana devices but could be of interest for
spintronics.

<h3>Quasi-bound States and Resonant Skew Scattering in Two-Dimensional  Materials with a Mexican-Hat Dispersion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14112" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14112</a>
<br>
<i>Vladimir A. Sablikov, Aleksei A. Sukhanov</i>
<br>
Mexican-hat dispersion of band electrons in two-dimensional materials
attracts a lot of interest, mainly due to the Van Hove singularity of the
density of states near the band edge. In this paper, we show that there is one
more feature of such a dispersion, which also leads to nontrivial effects. It
consists in the fact that the sign of the effective mass in the momentum space
near the central extremum is opposite to the sign of the mass outside this
region. For this reason, any localized potential that repels quasiparticles in
the outer region attracts quasiparticles in the central region and thereby
creates quasi-bound states. We study these states in the case when the
Mexican-hat dispersion is formed due to the hybridization of the inverted
electron and hole bands, and the potential is created by a point defect. The
energy and width of the resonance of the local density of states corresponding
to a quasi-bound state are found, and it is shown that, under certain
conditions, a quasi-bound state can transform into a bound state in a continuum
of band states. The presence of quasi-bound states leads to nontrivial effects
in the spin-dependent scattering of electrons. Due to the quasi-bound state,
the skew scattering is strongly enhanced for electrons with energy near the
resonance, and the skewness angle varies over a wide range depending on the
energy. In addition, in a certain energy range, a nontrivial effect of
scattering suppression appears in the direction opposite to the skewness angle.

<h3>Tunable nonlinear damping in parametric regime</h3>

<br>
<i>Parmeshwar Prasad, Nishta Arora, A. K. Naik</i>
<br>
Nonlinear damping plays a significant role in several area of physics and it
is becoming increasingly important to understand its underlying mechanism.
However, microscopic origin of nonlinear damping is still a debatable topic.
Here, we probe and report nonlinear damping in a highly tunable MoS2 nano
mechanical drum resonator using electrical homodyne actuation and detection
technique. In our experiment, we achieve 2:1 internal resonance by tuning
resonance frequency and observe enhanced non-linear damping. We probe the
effect of non-linear damping by characterizing parametric gain. Geometry and
tunability of the device allow us to reduce the effect of other prominent
Duffing non-linearity to probe the non-linear damping effectively. The enhanced
non-linear damping in the vicinity of internal resonance is also observed in
direct drive, supporting possible origin of non-linear damping. Our experiment
demonstrates, a highly tunable 2D material based nanoresonator offers an
excellent platform to study the nonlinear physics and exploit nonlinear damping
in parametric regime.

Photoexcitation of planar Wannier excitons by twisted photons in thin
semiconductor films is investigated. The explicit general formulas for
transition probabilities between exciton states are derived. The selection
rules for the projection of the total angular momentum are obtained. As
examples, the Coulomb and Rytova-Keldysh electron-hole interaction potentials
are considered. The use of planar excitons as a pure on-chip source of twisted
photons is discussed. The formulas obtained also describe photoexcitation of
states of electrons and holes bound to charged impurities in planar
semiconductors.

<h3>Spin and Valley Hall effects induced by asymmetric interparticle  scattering</h3>

<br>
<i>M. M. Glazov, L. E. Golub</i>
<br>
We develop the theory of the spin and valley Hall effects in two-dimensional
systems caused by asymmetric -- skew -- scattering of the quasiparticles. The
collision integral is derived in the third order in the particle-particle
interaction with account for the spin-orbit coupling both for bosons and
fermions. It is shown that the scattering asymmetry appears only in the
processes where the interaction between the particles in the initial and
intermediate state is present. We show that for degenerate electrons or
nondegenerate particles the spin and valley currents induced by interparticle
collisions are suppressed with their steady-state values being proportional to
the squared temperature or density, respectively. Our results imply non-Fermi
liquid properties of electrons in the presence of electron-electron skew
scattering. Strong deviations from conventional picture of interparticle
scattering are also demonstrated for the skew scattering of two-dimensional
degenerate bosons, e.g. excitons or exciton polaritons: The spin or valley
current of degenerate bosons contains the enhancement factor exponentially
growing with increase in the particle density.

<h3>Solving multiorbital dynamical mean-field theory using natural orbitals  renormalization group</h3>

<br>
<i>Jia-Ming Wang, Yin Chen, Yi-Heng Tian, Rong-Qiang He, Zhong-Yi Lu</i>
<br>
The natural orbitals renormalization group (NORG) has previously been
proposed as an efficient numerical method for solving zero-temperature
properties of multisite and multiorbital quantum impurity systems. Here, we
implement the NORG as an impurity solver for dynamical mean-field theory
(DMFT). In comparison with the exact diagonalization method, the NORG method
can treat much more bath sites in an impurity model to which the DMFT maps a
lattice model and can find accurate zero-temperature Matsubara and
low-frequency retarded Green's functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
this method on a two-orbital Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice and find
successfully the orbital selective Mott transition with a Kondo resonance peak
in the wide band and two holon-doublon bound state excitation peaks in the
narrow band.

<h3>Unidirectional magnetic coupling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14179" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14179</a>
<br>
<i>H. Y. Yuan, R. Lavrijsen, R. A. Duine</i>
<br>
We show that interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in combination with
non-local Gilbert damping gives rise to unidirectional magnetic coupling. That
is, the coupling between two magnetic layers -- say the left and right layer --
is such that dynamics of the left layer leads to dynamics of the right layer,
but not vice versa. We discuss the implications of this result for the magnetic
susceptibility of a magnetic bilayer, electrically-actuated spin-current
transmission, and unidirectional spin-wave packet generation and propagation.
Our results may enable a route towards spin-current and spin-wave diodes and
further pave the way to design spintronic devices via reservoir engineering.

<br>
Heat engines convert thermal energy into mechanical work both in the
classical and quantum regimes. However, quantum theory offers genuine
nonclassical forms of energy, different from heat, which so far have not been
exploited in cyclic engines to produce useful work. We here experimentally
realize a novel quantum many-body engine fuelled by the energy difference
between fermionic and bosonic ensembles of ultracold particles that follows
from the Pauli exclusion principle. We employ a harmonically trapped superfluid
gas of $^6$Li atoms close to a magnetic Feshbach resonance which allows us to
effectively change the quantum statistics from Bose-Einstein to Fermi-Dirac. We
replace the traditional heating and cooling strokes of a quantum Otto cycle by
tuning the gas between a Bose- Einstein condensate of bosonic molecules and a
unitary Fermi gas (and back) through a magnetic field. The quantum nature of
such a Pauli engine is revealed by contrasting it to a classical thermal engine
and to a purely interaction-driven device. We obtain a work output of several
$10^6$ vibrational quanta per cycle with an efficiency of up to $25\%$. Our
findings establish quantum statistics as a useful thermodynamic resource for
work production, shifting the paradigm of energy-conversion devices to a new
class of emergent quantum engines.

The unitary correspondence between Quantum Hall states in higher Landau
levels and states in the lowest Landau level is discussed together with the

potentials. This correspondence leads in particular to a representation of
states in arbitrary Landau levels in terms of holomorphic functions. Some
important special Quantum Hall states in higher Landau levels are also briefly
discussed.

<br>
<i>Mohamed Hendy, Mauricio Ponga</i>
<br>
This work presents a multiscale and multiphysics framework to investigate the
radiation-induced damage in nano-crystalline materials. The framework combines
two methodologies, including molecular dynamics simulations with electronic
effects and long-term atomistic diffusion simulations in nano-crystalline
materials. Using this framework, we investigated nano-crystalline materials'
self-healing behavior under radiation events. We found that the number of
defects generated in nano-crystals during the cascade simulations was less than
in single crystals. This behavior was due to the fast absorption of
interstitial atoms in the grain boundary network during the cascade
simulations, while vacancies migrated to the boundaries in a much longer time
scale than interstitial atoms. Thus, nano-crystalline materials showed a
self-healing behavior where the number and size of the defects are drastically
reduced with time. We found that the self-healing behavior of nano-crystalline
materials is limited, and about 50% of vacancies survived. This effect resulted
from clusters of vacancies' collective behavior, which are much more stable
than individual vacancies.

<h3>Universality in the tripartite information after global quenches</h3>

<i>Vanja Marić, Maurizio Fagotti</i>
<br>
We consider macroscopically large 3-partitions $(A,B,C)$ of connected
subsystems $A\cup B \cup C$ in infinite spin chains and study the
R\'enyi-$\alpha$ tripartite information $I_3^{(\alpha)}(A,B,C)$. At equilibrium
in clean 1D systems with local Hamiltonians it generally vanishes. A notable
exception is the ground state of conformal critical systems, in which
$I_3^{(\alpha)}(A,B,C)$ is known to be a universal function of the cross ratio
$x=|A||C|/[(|A|+|B|)(|C|+|B|)]$, where $|A|$ denotes $A$'s length. We identify
three classes of states for which time evolution under translationally
invariant Hamiltonians can build up (R\'enyi) tripartite information with a
universal dependency on $x$. We report a numerical study of $I_3^{(\alpha)}$ in
systems that are dual to free fermions, propose a field-theory description, and
conjecture their asymptotic behaviour for $\alpha=2$ in general and for generic
$\alpha$ in a subclass of systems. This allows us to infer the value of
$I_3^{(\alpha)}$ in the scaling limit $x\rightarrow 1^-$, which we call
"residual tripartite information". If nonzero, our analysis points to a
universal residual value $-\log 2$ independently of the R\'enyi index $\alpha$,
and hence applies also to the genuine (von Neumann) tripartite information.

<br>
It is a well known phenomenon in optics that spectroscopic resolution of a
diffraction grating is much better compared to an interference device having
just two slits, as in the Young's famous double-slit experiment. On the other
hand, it is well known that a classical superconducting quantum interference
device (SQUID) is analogous to the optical double-slit experiment. Here we
report experiments and present a model describing a superconducting analogue to
the diffraction grating, namely an array of superconducting islands positioned
on a topological insulator (TI) film Bi0.8Sb1.2Te3. In the limit of extremely
weak field, of the order of one vortex per the entire array, such devices
exhibit a critical current peak that is much sharper than the analogous peak of
an ordinary SQUID. Because of this, such arrays can be used as sensitive
absolute magnetic field sensors. An important finding is that, due to the
inherent asymmetry of such arrays, the device also acts as a superconducting
diode.

<h3>Accurate analytical approximation formulae for large deviation analysis  of rain formation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14270" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14270</a>
<br>
<i>Christian P. H. Salas</i>
<br>
A 2016 paper by M Wilkinson in Physical Review Letters suggests that
large-deviation theory is a suitable framework for studying unexpectedly rapid
rain formation in collector-drop collision processes. Wilkinson derives
asymptotic approximation formulae for a set of exact large-deviation functions,
such as the cumulant generating function and the entropy function. The
asymptotic approach assumes a large number of water droplet collisions and is
motivated by the fact that the exact large-deviation functions are
prohibitively difficult to deal with directly. Wilkinson uses his asymptotic
formulae to obtain further results and also provides numerical work which
suggests that a certain log-density function for the collector-drop model
(which is a function of his asymptotic approximation formulae) is itself
approximated satisfactorily. However, the numerical work does not test the
accuracy of the individual asymptotic approximation formulae directly against
their exact large-deviation theory counterparts. When these direct checks are
carried out, they reveal that the asymptotic formulae are, in fact, rather
inaccurate, even for very large numbers of collisions. Their individual
inaccuracy is masked by their incorporation into log-density functions in
Wilkinson's numerical work. Their inaccuracy, as well as some assumptions
underlying their derivation, severely limit their applicability. The present
note points out that it is quite possible to develop accurate analytical (i.e.,
non-asymptotic) approximation formulae for the large-deviation theory functions
in the collector-drop model which also preserve the forms of the leading order
power terms in Wilkinson's asymptotic formulae. An analytical approximation
approach can be developed based on a Euler-Maclaurin formula. The resulting
analytical formulae are extremely accurate and valid for all relevant numbers
of collisions and time scales.

<h3>Global Speed Limit for Finite-Time Dynamical Phase Transition in  Nonequilibrium Relaxation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14287" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14287</a>
<br>
<i>Kristian Blom, Aljaž Godec</i>
<br>
Recent works unraveled an intriguing finite-time dynamical phase transition
in the thermal relaxation of the mean field Curie-Weiss model. The phase
transition reflects a sudden switch in the dynamics. Its existence in systems
with a finite range of interaction, however, remained unclear. Employing the
Bethe-Guggenheim approximation, which is exact on Bethe lattices, we here
demonstrate the finite-time dynamical phase transition in nearest-neighbor
Ising systems for arbitrary quenches, including those within the two-phase
region. Strikingly, for any given initial condition we prove and explain the
existence of non-trivial speed limits for the dynamical phase transition and
the relaxation of magnetization, which are absent in the mean field setting.
Pair correlations, which are neglected in mean field theory and trivial in the
Curie-Weiss model, account for kinetic constraints due to frustrated local
configurations that give rise to a global speed limit.

<h3>Observation of Gapped Topological Surface States and Isolated Surface  Resonances in PdTe$_2$ Ultrathin Films</h3>

<br>
The superconductor PdTe$_2$ is known to host bulk Dirac bands and topological
surface states. The coexistence of superconductivity and topological surface
states makes PdTe$_2$ a promising platform for exploring topological
superconductivity and Majorana bound states. In this work, we report the
layer-by-layer molecular beam epitaxy growth and spectroscopic characterization
of high quality PdTe$_2$ films with thickness down to 3 monolayers (ML). In the
3 ML PdTe$_2$ film, we observed spin-polarized surface resonance states, which
are isolated from the bulk bands due to the quantum size effects. In addition,
the hybridization of surface states on opposite faces leads to a
thickness-dependent gap in the topological surface Dirac bands. Our
photoemission results show clearly that the size of the hybridization gap
increases as the film thickness is reduced. The success in growing high quality
PdTe$_2$ films by state-of-art molecular beam epitaxy technique and the
observation of surface resonances and gaped topological surface states sheds
light on the applications of PdTe$_2$ quantum films in spintronics and
topological computation.
