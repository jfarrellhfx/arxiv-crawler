This study proposed a new numerical scheme for vortex lattice formation in a
rotating Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) using smoothed particle hydrodynamics
(SPH) with an explicit real-time integration scheme. Specifically, the
Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation was described as a complex representation to
obtain a pair of time-dependent equations, which were then solved
simultaneously following discretization based on SPH particle approximation. We
adopt the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method for time evolution. We performed
simulations of a rotating Bose gas trapped in a harmonic potential, showing
results that qualitatively agreed with previously reported experiments and
simulations. The geometric patterns of formed lattices were successfully
reproduced for several cases, for example, the pentagonal lattice observed in
the experiments of rotating BECs. Consequently, it was confirmed that the
simulation began with the periodic oscillation of the condensate, which
attenuated and maintained a stable rotation with slanted elliptical shapes;
however, the surface was excited to be unstable and generated ripples, which
grew into vortices and then penetrated the inside the condensate, forming a
lattice. We confirmed that each branch point of the phase of wavefunctions
corresponds to each vortex. These results demonstrate our approach at a certain
degree of accuracy. In conclusion, we successfully developed a new SPH scheme
for the simulations of vortex lattice formation in rotating BECs.

<h3>Pattern Formation and Transport for Externally Driven Active Matter on  Periodic Substrates</h3>

We investigate the transport of interacting active run-and-tumble particles
moving under an external drift force through a periodic array of obstacles for
increasing drive amplitudes. For high activity where the system forms a
motility induced phase separated state, there are several distinct dynamic
phases including a low drive pinned cluster phase, an intermediate uniform
fluid, and a higher drive stripe crystal state. The transitions between the
phases are correlated with signatures in the transport curves, differential
mobility, and power spectra of the velocity fluctuations. In contrast, in the
low activity regime the transport curves and power spectra undergo little
change as a function of drive. We argue that in the high activity limit, the
behavior is similar to that of driven solids on periodic substrates, while in
the low activity limit the system behaves like a driven fluid.

<h3>Caustics in the sine-Gordon model from quenches in coupled 1D Bose gases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08410" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08410</a>
<br>
<i>Aman Agarwal, Manas Kulkarni, D. H. J. O'Dell</i>
<br>
<br>
Caustics are singularities that occur naturally in optical, hydrodynamic and
quantum waves, giving rise to high amplitude patterns that can be described
using catastrophe theory. In this paper we study caustics in a statistical
field theory setting in the form of the sine-Gordon model that describes a
variety of physical systems including coupled 1D superfluids. Specifically, we
use classical field simulations to study the dynamics of two ultracold 1D Bose
gases (quasi-condensates) that are suddenly coupled to each other and find that
the resulting non-equilibrium dynamics are dominated by caustics. Thermal noise
is included by sampling the initial states from a Boltzmann distribution for
phononic excitations. We find that caustics pile up over time in both the
number and phase difference observables leading to a characteristic non-thermal
`circus tent' shaped probability distribution at long times.

<h3>$η$-pairing on bipartite and non-bipartite lattices</h3>

<i>Yutaro Misu, Shun Tamura, Yukio Tanaka, Shintaro Hoshino</i>
<br>
<br>
The $\eta$-pairing is a type of Cooper pairing state in which the phase of
the superconducting order parameter is aligned in a staggered manner, in
contrast to the usual BCS superconductors with a spatially uniform phase. In
this study, we search for a characteristic $\eta$-pairing state in a triangular
lattice where a simple staggered alignment of the phase is not possible. As an
example, we consider the attractive Hubbard model on both the square and
triangular lattices under strong external Zeeman field. Using the mean-field
approximation, we have identified several $\eta$-pairing states. Additionally,
we have examined the electromagnetic stability of the pairing state by
calculating the Meissner kernel. Odd-frequency pairing plays a crucial role in
achieving diamagnetic response if the electrons experience a staggered
superconducting phase during the propagation of current.

<h3>Quantum Scattering States in a Nonlinear Coherent Medium</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08472" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08472</a>
<br>
<i>Allison Brattley, Hongyi Huang, Kunal K. Das</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a comprehensive study of stationary states in a coherent medium
with a quadratic or Kerr nonlinearity in the presence of localized potentials
in one dimension (1D) for both positive and negative signs of the nonlinear
term, as well as for barriers and wells. The description is in terms of the
nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) and hence applicable to a variety of
systems, including interacting ultracold atoms in the mean field regime and
light propagation in optical fibers. We determine the full landscape of
solutions, in terms of a potential step and build solutions for rectangular
barrier and well potentials. It is shown that all the solutions can be
expressed in terms of a Jacobi elliptic function with the inclusion of a
complex-valued phase shift. Our solution method relies on the roots of a cubic
polynomial associated with a hydrodynamic picture, which provides a simple
classification of all the solutions, both bounded and unbounded, while the
boundary conditions are intuitively visualized as intersections of phase space
curves. We compare solutions for open boundary conditions with those for a
barrier potential on a ring, and also show that numerically computed solutions
for smooth barriers agree qualitatively with analytical solutions for
rectangular barriers. A stability analysis of solutions based on the Bogoliubov
equations for fluctuations show that persistent instabilities are localized at
sharp boundaries, and are predicated by the relation of the mean density change
across the boundary to the value of the derivative of the density at the edge.
We examine the scattering of a wavepacket by a barrier potential and show that
at any instant the scattered states are well described by the stationary
solutions we obtain, indicating applications of our results and methods to
nonlinear scattering problems.

<h3>Wigner Gaussian dynamics: simulating the anharmonic and quantum ionic  motion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08628" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08628</a>
<br>
<i>Antonio Siciliano, Lorenzo Monacelli, Giovanni Caldarelli, Francesco Mauri</i>
<br>
<br>
The atomic motion controls important features of materials, such as thermal
transport, phase transitions, and vibrational spectra. However, the simulation
of ionic dynamics is exceptionally challenging when quantum fluctuations are
relevant (e.g., at low temperatures or with light atoms) and the energy
landscape is anharmonic. In this work, we formulate the Time-Dependent
Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (TDSCHA) in the Wigner framework, paving
the way for the efficient computation of the nuclear motion in systems with
sizable quantum and thermal anharmonic fluctuations. Besides the improved
numerical efficiency, the Wigner formalism unveils the classical limit of
TDSCHA and provides a link with the many-body perturbation theory of Feynman
diagrams.
We further extend the method to account for the non-linear couplings between
phonons and photons, responsible, e.g., for a nonvanishing Raman signal in
high-symmetry Raman inactive crystals, firstly discussed by Rasetti and Fermi.
We benchmark the method in phase III of high-pressure hydrogen ab initio. The
nonlinear photon-phonon coupling reshapes the IR spectra and explains the
high-frequency shoulder of the H2 vibron observed in experiments.
The Wigner TDSCHA is computationally cheap and derived from first principles:
it is unbiased by assumptions on the phonon-phonon and phonon-photon scattering
and does not depend on empirical parameters. Therefore, the method can be
adopted in unsupervised high-throughput calculations.

<h3>An efficient and low-cost method to create high-density nitrogen-vacancy  centers in CVD diamond for sensing applications</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08712" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08712</a>

<br>
<br>
The negatively charged Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV-) center in diamond is one of the
most versatile and robust quantum sensors suitable for quantum technologies,
including magnetic field and temperature sensors. For precision sensing
applications, densely packed NV- centers within a small volume are preferable
due to benefiting from 1/N^1/2 sensitivity enhancement (N is the number of
sensing NV centers) and efficient excitation of NV centers. However, methods
for quickly and efficiently forming high concentrations of NV- centers are in
development stage. We report an efficient, low-cost method for creating
high-density NV- centers production from a relatively low nitrogen
concentration based on high-energy photons from Ar+ plasma. This study was done
on type-IIa, single crystal, CVD-grown diamond substrates with an as-grown
nitrogen concentration of 1 ppm. We estimate an NV- density of ~ 0.57 ppm (57%)
distributed homogeneously over 200 um deep from the diamond surface facing the
plasma source based on optically detected magnetic resonance and fluorescence
confocal microscopy measurements. The created NV-s have a spin-lattice
relaxation time (T1) of 5 ms and a spin-spin coherence time (T2) of 4 us. We
measure a DC magnetic field sensitivity of ~ 104 nT Hz^-1/2, an AC magnetic
field sensitivity of ~ 0.12 pT Hz^-1/2, and demonstrate real-time magnetic
field sensing at a rate over 10 mT s-1 using an active sample volume of 0.2
um3.

<h3>Critical Slowing Down at the Abrupt Mott Transition: When the  First-Order Phase Transition Becomes Zeroth-Order and Looks Like Second-Order</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08254" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08254</a>
<br>
<i>Satyaki Kundu, Tapas Bar, Rajesh Kumble Nayak, Bhavtosh Bansal</i>
<br>
<br>
We report that the thermally-induced Mott transition in vanadium sesquioxide
shows critical-slowing-down and enhanced variance ('critical opalescence') of
the order parameter fluctuations measured through low-frequency
resistance-noise spectroscopy. Coupled with the observed increase of also the
phase-ordering time, these features suggest that the strong abrupt transition
is controlled by a critical-like singularity in the hysteretic metastable
phase. The singularity is identified with the spinodal point and is a likely
consequence of the strain-induced long-range interaction.

<h3>Maple Leaf Antiferromagnet in a Magnetic Field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08264" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08264</a>
<br>
<i>Pratyay Ghosh, Jannis Seufert, Tobias Müller, Frédéric Mila, Ronny Thomale</i>
<br>
<br>
We analyze the quantum antiferromagnet on the maple leaf lattice in the
presence of a magnetic field. Starting from its exact dimer ground state and
for a magnetic field strength of the order of the local dimer spin exchange
coupling, we perform a strong coupling expansion and extract an effective
hardcore boson model. The interplay of effective many-body interactions,
suppressed single-particle dynamics, and correlated hopping gives way to an
intriguing series of superfluid to insulator transitions which correspond to
magnetization plateaux in terms of the maple leaf spin degrees of freedom.
While we find plateaux at intermediate magnetization to be dominated by bosonic
density wave order, we conjecture plateau formation from multi-boson bound
states due to correlated hopping for lower magnetization.

<h3>Nonlocality and entanglement in measured critical quantum Ising chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08268" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08268</a>
<br>
<i>Zack Weinstein, Rohith Sajith, Ehud Altman, Samuel J. Garratt</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the effect of measurements, performed with a finite density in
space, on the ground state of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model
(TFIM) at criticality. Local degrees of freedom in critical states exhibit
long-range entanglement and, as a result, local measurements can have highly
nonlocal effects. Our analytical investigation of correlations and entanglement
in the ensemble of measured states is based on properties of the Ising
conformal field theory (CFT), where measurements appear as (1+0)-dimensional
defects in the (1+1)-dimensional Euclidean spacetime. So that we can verify our
predictions using large-scale free-fermion numerics, we restrict ourselves to
parity-symmetric measurements. To describe their averaged effect analytically
we use a replica approach, and we show that the defect arising in the replica
theory is an irrelevant perturbation to the Ising CFT. Strikingly, the
asymptotic scaling of averaged correlations and entanglement entropy are
therefore unchanged relative to the ground state. In contrast, the defect
generated by postselecting on the most likely measurement outcomes is exactly
marginal. We then find that the exponent governing post-measurement order
parameter correlations, as well as the ''effective central charge'' governing
the scaling of entanglement entropy, vary continuously with the density of
measurements in space. Our work establishes new connections between the effects
of measurements on many-body quantum states and of physical defects on
low-energy equilibrium properties.

<h3>Raman Scattering Spectra of Boron Imidazolate Frameworks Containing  Paramagnetic Ions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08287" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08287</a>
<br>
<i>Jackson Davis, Soumyodip Banerjee, Pilar Beccar-Varela, V. Sara Thoi, Natalia Drichko</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a Raman scattering spectroscopic study of boron imidazolate
metal-organic frameworks (BIFs) with a number of paramagnetic ions in a wide
frequency range from 25 to 1700 cm$^{-1}$, which covers local vibrations of the
linkers and well as collective lattice vibrations. We show that the spectral
region above 800 cm$^{-1}$ belongs to the local vibrations of the linkers,
which have the same frequencies for the studied BIFs without any dependence on
the structure of the BIFs, and are easily interpreted based on the spectra of
imidazolate linkers. In contrast, collective lattice vibrations, observed below
100 cm$^{-1}$, show a distinction between cage and two-dimensional BIFs
structures, with a weak dependence on the metal node. We identify the range of
vibrations around 200 cm$^{-1}$, which are distinct for each MOF, depending on
a metal node. Our work demonstrates the energy hierarchy in the vibrational
response of BIFs.

<h3>Ab initio comparison of spin-transport properties in MgO-spaced  ferrimagnetic tunnel junctions based on Mn$_3$Ga and Mn$_3$Al</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08300" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08300</a>
<br>
<i>Maria Stamenova, Plamen Stamenov, Nadjib Baadji</i>
<br>
<br>
We report on first-principles spin-polarised quantum transport calculations
(from NEGF+DFT) in MgO-spaced magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) based on two
different Mn-based Heusler ferrimagnetic metals, namely Mn$_3$Al and Mn$_3$Ga
in their tetragonal DO$_{22}$ phase. The former is a fully compensated
half-metallic ferrimagnet, while the latter is a low-moment
high-spin-polarisation ferrimagnet, both with a small lattice mismatch from
MgO. In identical symmetric and asymmetric interface reconstructions across a
3-monolayer thick MgO barrier for both ferrimagets, the linear response
(low-voltage) spin-transfer torque (STT) and tunneling magneto-resistance (TMR)
effects are evaluated. A larger staggered in-plane STT is found in the Mn$_3$Ga
case, while the STT in Mn$_3$Al vanishes quickly away from the interface
(similarly to STT in ferromagnetic MTJs). The roles are reversed for the TMR,
which is practically 100\% in the half-metallic Mn$_3$Al-based MTJs (using the
conservative definition) as opposed to 60\% in the Mn$_3$Ga case. The weak
dependence on the exact interface reconstruction would suggest
Mn$_3$Ga-Mn$_3$Al solid solutions as a possible route towards optimal trade-off
of STT and TMR in the low-bias, low-temperature transport regime.

<h3>A note on the constant characteristic time of failure incubation  processes under various high-rate loads</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08313" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08313</a>
<br>
<i>Ivan Smirnov</i>
<br>
<br>
The research reveals the existence of a constant characteristic time of
preparatory micro-structural processes before the onset of macro-failure at
various high loading rates of brittle and quasi-brittle materials. The presence
of this characteristic is analysed based on available data in the literature
from dynamic tests for uniaxial compression and splitting. It is shown that the
characteristic time can be determined experimentally and used to calculate the
strain rate dependencies of either critical failure stresses or time to
failure, at least in the case of linearly growing loads. In addition, it is
discussed that the presence of this constant parameter opens up a prospective
opportunity for research and development of new methods for assessing the
structural-temporal and scale characteristics of the strength and failure of
materials under dynamic loads.

<h3>Spiraling Defect Cores in Chromonic Hedgehogs</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08323" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08323</a>
<br>
<i>Silvia Paparini, Epifanio G. Virga</i>
<br>
<br>
An elastic quartic twist theory has recently been proposed for chromonic
liquid crystals, intended to overcome the paradoxical conclusions encountered
by the classical Oseen-Frank theory when applied to droplets submerged in an
isotropic fluid environment. However, available experimental data for
chromonics confined to cylindrical cavities with degenerate planar anchoring on
their lateral boundary can be explained equally well by both competing
theories. This paper identifies a means to differentiate these theories both
qualitatively and quantitatively. They are shown to predict quite different
core defects for the twisted hedgehogs that chromonics generate when confined
to a fixed spherical cavity with homeotropic anchoring. In the quartic twist
theory, the defect core is estimated to be nearly one order of magnitude larger
(tens of microns) than in the other and, correspondingly, the director field
lines describe Archimedean spirals instead of logarithmic ones.

<h3>RIXS observation of bond-directional nearest-neighbor excitations in the  Kitaev material Na$_2$IrO$_3$</h3>

Spin-orbit coupling locks spin direction and spatial orientation and
generates, in semi-classical magnets, a local spin easy-axis and associated
ordering. Quantum spin-1/2's defy this fate: rather than spins becoming locally
anisotropic, the spin-spin interactions do. Consequently interactions become
dependent on the spatial orientation of bonds between spins, prime theoretical
examples of which are Kitaev magnets. Bond-directional interactions imply the
existence of bond-directional magnetic modes, predicted spin excitations that
render crystallographically equivalent bonds magnetically inequivalent, which
yet have remained elusive experimentally. Here we show that resonant inelastic
x-ray scattering allows us to explicitly probe the bond-directional character
of magnetic excitations. To do so, we use a scattering plane spanned by one
bond and the corresponding spin component and scan a range of momentum transfer
that encompasses multiple Brillouin zones. Applying this approach to
Na$_2$IrO$_3$ we establish the different bond-directional characters of
magnetic excitations at 10 meV and 45 meV. Combined with the observation of
spin-spin correlations that are confined to a single bond, this experimentally
validates the Kitaev character of exchange interactions long proposed for this
material.

<br>
Topological insulators are insulators in the bulk but feature chiral energy
propagation along the boundary. This property is topological in nature and
therefore robust to disorder. Originally discovered in electronic materials,
topologically protected boundary transport has since been observed in many
other physical systems. Thus, it is natural to ask whether this phenomenon
finds relevance in a broader context. We choreograph a dance in which a group
of humans, arranged on a square grid, behave as a topological insulator. The
dance features unidirectional flow of movement through dancers on the lattice
edge. This effect persists when people are removed from the dance floor. Our
work extends the applicability of wave physics to the performance arts.

<h3>Occupational Disorder as the Origin of Flattening of the Acoustic Phonon  Branches in the Clathrate Ba$_{8}$Ga$_{16}$Ge$_{30}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
In the search for high-performance thermoelectrics, materials such as
clathrates have drawn attention due to having both glass-like low phonon
thermal conductivity and crystal-like high electrical conductivity.
Ba$_{8}$Ga$_{16}$Ge$_{30}$ (BGG) has a loosely bound guest Ba atom trapped
inside rigid Ga/Ge cage structures. Avoided crossings between acoustic phonons
and the flat guest atom branches have been proposed to be the source of the low
lattice thermal conductivity of BGG. Ga/Ge site disorder with Ga and Ge
exchanging places in different unit cells has also been reported. We used
time-of-flight neutron scattering to measure the complete phonon spectrum in a
large single crystal of BGG and compared these results with predictions of
density functional theory to elucidate the effect of the disorder on
heat-carrying phonons. Experimental results agreed much better with the
calculation assuming the disorder than with the calculation assuming the
ordered configuration. Although atomic masses of Ga and Ge are nearly
identical, we found that disorder strongly reduces phonon group velocities,
which significantly reduces thermal conductivity. Our work points at a new path
towards optimizing thermoelectrics.

<h3>Low-energy hole subband dispersions in a cylindrical Ge nanowire: the  effects of the nanowire growth direction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08400" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08400</a>

We examine the validity of the spherical approximation
$\gamma_{s}=(2\gamma_{2}+3\gamma_{3})/5$ in the Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian in
calculating the subband dispersions of the hole gas. We calculate the realistic
hole subband dispersions (without the spherical approximation) in a cylindrical
Ge nanowire by using quasi-degenerate perturbation theory. The realistic
low-energy hole subband dispersions have a double-well anticrossing structure,
that consists with the spherical approximation prediction. However, the
realistic subband dispersions are also nanowire growth direction dependent.
When the nanowire growth direction is restricted in the (100) crystal plane,
the detailed growth direction dependences of the subband parameters are given.
We find the spherical approximation is good approximation, it can nicely

Using variational matrix product states, we analyze the finite temperature
behavior of a half-filled periodic Anderson model in one dimension, a
prototypical model of a Kondo insulator. We present an extensive analysis of
single-particle Green's functions, two-particle Green's functions, and
transport functions creating a broad picture of the low-temperature properties.
We confirm the existence of energetically low-lying spin excitations in this
model and study their energy-momentum dispersion and temperature dependence. We
demonstrate that charge-charge correlations at the Fermi energy exhibit a
different temperature dependence than spin-spin correlations. While
energetically low-lying spin excitations emerge approximately at the Kondo
temperature, which exponentially depends on the interaction strength, charge
correlations vanish already at high temperatures. Furthermore, we analyze the
charge and thermal conductivity at finite temperatures by calculating the
time-dependent current-current correlation functions. While both charge and
thermal conductivity can be fitted for all interaction strengths by gapped
systems with a renormalized band gap, the gap in the system describing the
thermal conductivity is generally smaller than the system describing the charge
conductivity. Thus, two-particle correlations affect the charge and heat
conductivities in a different way resulting in a temperature region where the
charge conductivity of this one-dimensional Kondo insulator is already
decreasing while the heat conductivity is still increasing.

In the study of dynamic charge order correlations in the cuprates, most high
energy-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements have
focused on momenta along the high-symmetry directions of the copper oxide
plane. However, electron scattering along other in-plane directions should not
be neglected as they may contain information relevant, for example, to the
origin of charge order correlations or to our understanding of the isotropic
scattering responsible for strange metal behavior in cuprates. We report
high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) experiments that
reveal the presence of dynamic electron correlations over the $q_x$-$q_y$
scattering plane in underdoped
$\textrm{Bi}_2\textrm{Sr}_2\textrm{Ca}\textrm{Cu}_2\textrm{O}_{8+\delta}$ with
$T_c=54$ K. We use the softening of the RIXS-measured bond stretching phonon
line as a marker for the presence of charge-order-related dynamic electron
correlations. The experiments show that these dynamic correlations exist at
energies below approximately $70$ meV and are centered around a quasi-circular
manifold in the $q_x$-$q_y$ scattering plane with radius equal to the magnitude
of the charge order wave vector, $q_{CO}$. We also demonstrate how this
phonon-tracking procedure provides the necessary experimental precision to rule
out fluctuations of short-range directional charge order (i.e. centered around
$[q_x=\pm q_{CO}, q_y=0]$ and $[q_x=0, q_y=\pm q_{CO}]$) as the origin of the
observed correlations.

<h3>Possible new phase transition in the 3D Ising Model associated with  boundary percolation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08424" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08424</a>

<i>Michael Grady</i>
<br>
<br>
In the ordered phase of the 3D Ising model, minority spin clusters are
surrounded by a boundary of dual plaquettes. As the temperature is raised,
these spin clusters become more numerous, and it is found that eventually their
boundaries undergo a percolation transition when about 13\% of spins are
minority. Boundary percolation differs from the more commonly studied site and
link percolation, although it is related to an unusual type of site percolation
that includes next to nearest neighbor relationships. Because the Ising model
can be reformulated in terms of the domain boundaries alone, there is reason to
believe boundary percolation should be relevant here. A symmetry-breaking order
parameter is found in the dual theory, the 3D gauge Ising model. It is seen to
undergo a phase transition at a coupling close to that predicted by duality
from the boundary percolation. This transition lies in the disordered phase of
the gauge theory and has the nature of a spin-glass transition. Its critical
exponent $\nu \sim 1.3$ is seen to match the finite-size shift exponent of the
percolation transition further cementing their connection. This predicts a very
weak specific heat singularity with exponent $\alpha \sim -1.9$. The third
energy cumulant fits well to the expected non-infinite critical behavior in a
manner consistent with both the predicted exponent and critical point,
indicating a true thermal phase transition. Unlike random boundary percolation,
the Ising boundary percolation has two different $\nu$ exponents, one
associated with largest-cluster scaling and the other with finite-size
transition-point shift. This suggests there are two different correlation
lengths present.

<h3>Quantum criticality of a $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ symmetric spin chain with  long-range interactions</h3>

<i>Xue-Jia Yu, Chengxiang Ding, Limei Xu</i>
<br>
<br>
Based on large-scale density matrix renormalization group techniques, we
investigate the critical behaviors of quantum three-state Potts chains with
long-range interactions. Using fidelity susceptibility as an indicator, we
obtain a complete phase diagram of the system. The results show that as the
long-range interaction power $\alpha$ increases, the critical points
$f_{c}^{*}$ shift towards lower values. In addition, the critical threshold
$\alpha_{c}(\approx 1.43$) of the long-range interaction power is obtained for
the first time by a non-perturbative numerical method. This indicates that the
critical behavior of the system can be naturally divided into two distinct
universality classes, namely the long-range ($\alpha \textless \alpha_c$) and
short-range ($\alpha \textgreater \alpha_c$) universality classes,
qualitatively consistent with the classical $\phi^{3}$ effective field theory.
This work provides a useful reference for further research on phase transitions
in quantum spin chains with long-range interaction.

We introduce an exact framework to compute the positive frequency moments
$M^{(\alpha)}(\mathbf{q})=\braket{\omega^\alpha}$ of different dynamic
properties from imaginary-time quantum Monte Carlo data. As a practical
example, we obtain the first five moments of the dynamic structure factor
$S(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ of the uniform electron gas at the electronic Fermi
temperature based on \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo simulations. We
find excellent agreement with known sum rules for $\alpha=1,3$, and, to our
knowledge, present the first results for $\alpha=2,4,5$. Our idea can be
straightforwardly generalized to other dynamic properties such as the
single-particle spectral function $A(\mathbf{q},\omega)$, and will be useful
for a number of applications, including the study of ultracold atoms, exotic
warm dense matter, and condensed matter systems.

We study a topological phase in the dissipative Kitaev chain described by the
Markovian quantum master equation. Based on the correspondence between
Lindbladians, which generate the dissipative time-evolution, and non-Hermitian
matrices, Lindbladians are classified in terms of non-Hermitian topological
phases. We find out that the Lindbladian retains PT symmetry which is the
prominent symmetry of open systems and then all the bulk modes can have a
common lifetime. Moreover, when open boundary conditions are imposed on the
system, the edge modes which break PT symmetry emerge, and one of the edge
modes has a zero eigenvalue.

<h3>Properties of dissipative Floquet Majorana modes using a quantum dot</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the electronic conductance of dissipative Floquet Majorana zero
modes (FMZMs) in a periodically driven nanowire coupled to a quantum dot. We
use a numerical method which can accurately take into account the dissipation
effects from the superconducting bath, which causes the FMZMs to have a finite
lifetime. Our results show that, in the weak nanowire-dot coupling regime, the
peak conductance at zero temperature of the resonant dot can be well
approximated by a universal function of the FMZM lifetime rescaled with the
nanowire-dot coupling strength: For a long FMZM's lifetime, the conductance
approaches the characteristic quantized value of $G = e^2/2h$, whereas $G
\rightarrow e^2/h$ (uncoupled dot) as the FMZMs' lifetime goes to zero. In
principle, our method can be used to test the presence and lifetime of FMZMs in
such devices, which is key for any practical application of these topological
states.

<br>
<i>Matteo Caldara, Andrea Richaud, Massimo Capone, Pietro Massignan</i>
<br>
<br>
We study a superfluid in a planar annulus hosting vortices with massive
cores. An analytical point-vortex model shows that the massive vortices may
perform radial oscillations on top of the usual uniform precession of their
massless counterpart. This regular motion becomes unstable beyond a critical
vortex mass. The analogy with the motion of a charged particle in a static
electromagnetic field leads to the development of a plasma orbit theory that
provides a description of the trajectories which remains accurate even beyond
the regime of small radial oscillations. These results are confirmed by the
numerical solution of coupled two-component Gross-Pitaevskii equations. The
analysis is then extended to a necklace of vortices symmetrically arranged
within the annulus.

Boltzmann Equation with the non-additive correlation functional. The
collisional term following the $q$-algebra is adopted. In the derivation of the
non-additive Fokker-Planck Equation, two constraints are imposed on the final
result: i) that the entropic index $q$ is a characteristic parameter of the
non-additive systems with a value that does not change with time, and ii) that
for $q \rightarrow 1$ a smooth transition for the standard Fokker-Planck
Equation is obtained.

<br>
We have measured crystalline electric field (CEF) excitations of Nd3+ ions in
the two-channel Kondo lattice candidates NdT2Zn20 (T = Co, Rh, and Ir) by means
of inelastic neutron scattering (INS). In the INS measurements at 5 K,
dispersionless excitations were observed at 3.8 and 7.2 meV for T = Co, 3.1 and
5.8 meV for T = Rh, and 3.0 and 5.3 meV for T = Ir. Analyses of the temperature
dependence of the INS spectra confirm that the CEF ground states are the Gamma
6 doublet, that is a requisite for manifestation of the magnetic two-channel
Kondo effect. For T = Co, a shoulder was observed at 7.7 meV close to the CEF
excitation peak centered at 7.2 meV. The shoulder is attributed to a bound
state of the CEF and low-lying optical phonon excitations.

Applying very small purely radial strains on amorphous solids in radial
geometry one observes elastic responses that break the radial symmetry. Without
any plasticity involved, the responses indicate nonlinear mode coupling
contributions even for minute strains. We show that these symmetry-breaking
responses are due to disorder, typical to amorphous configurations. The
symmetry breaking responses are quantitatively explained using the classical
Michell solutions which are excited by mode coupling.

Recent experiments indicate that superconducting fluctuations also play an
important role in overdoped cuprates. Here we apply the static auxiliary field
Monte Carlo approach to study phase correlations of the pairing fields in a
microscopic model with spin-singlet pairing interaction. We find that the
short- and long-range phase correlations are well captured by the phase mutual
information, which allows us to construct a theoretical phase diagram
containing the uniform $d$-wave superconducting region, the phase fluctuating
region, the local pairing region, and the disordered region. We show that the
gradual development of phase coherence has a number of consequences on
spectroscopic measurements, such as the development of the Fermi arc and the
anisotropy in the angle-resolved spectra, scattering rate, entropy, specific
heat, and quasiparticle dispersion, in good agreement with experimental
observations. For strong coupling, our Monte Carlo simulation reveals an
unexpected charge-4$e$ plaquette state with $d$-wave bonds, which competes with
the uniform $d$-wave superconductivity and exhibits a U-shaped density of
states.

We develop a theory describing the transient transmission through noisy
qubit-resonator systems with quadratic interactions as are found in
superconducting and nanomechanical resonators coupled to solid-state qubits.
After generalizing the quantum Langevin equations to arbitrary qubit-resonator
couplings, we show that only the cases of linear and quadratic couplings allow
for an analytical treatment within standard input-output theory. Focussing for
the first time on quadratic couplings and allowing for arbitrary initial qubit
coherences, it is shown that noise characteristics can be extracted from
input-output measurements by recording both the averaged fluctuations in the
transmission probability and the averaged phase. Our results represent an
extension to the field of transmission-based noise spectroscopy with immediate
practical applications.

<h3>Out of equilibrium dynamics of repulsive ranked diffusions: the  expanding crystal</h3>

<br>
<i>Ana Flack, Pierre Le Doussal, Satya N. Majumdar, Gregory Schehr</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the non-equilibrium Langevin dynamics of $N$ particles in one
dimension with Coulomb repulsive linear interactions. This is a dynamical
version of the so-called jellium model (without confinement) also known as
ranked diffusion. Using a mapping to the Lieb-Liniger model of quantum bosons,
we obtain an exact formula for the joint distribution of the positions of the
$N$ particles at time $t$, all starting from the origin. A saddle point
analysis shows that the system converges at large time to a linearly expanding
crystal. Properly rescaled, this dynamical state resembles the equilibrium
crystal in a time dependent effective quadratic potential. This analogy allows
to study the fluctuations around the perfect crystal, which, to leading order,
are Gaussian. There are however deviations from this Gaussian behavior, which
embody long-range correlations of purely dynamical origin, characterized by the
higher order cumulants of, e.g., the gaps between the particles, that we
calculate exactly. We complement these results using a recent approach by one
of us in terms of a noisy Burgers equation. In the large $N$ limit, the mean
density of the gas can be obtained at any time from the solution of a
deterministic viscous Burgers equation. This approach provides a quantitative
description of the dense regime at shorter times. Our predictions are in good
agreement with numerical simulations for finite and large $N$.

Nanowire devices have long been proposed as an efficient alternative to their
planar counterparts for different optoelectronic applications. Unfortunately,
challenges related to the growth and characterization of doping and p-n
junction formation in nanowire devices (along axial or radial axis) have
significantly impeded their development. The problems are further amplified if
a p-n junction has to be implemented radially. Therefore, even though radial
junction devices are expected to be on par with their axial junction
counterparts, there are minimal reports on high-performance radial junction
nanowire optoelectronic devices. This paper summarizes our recent results on
the simulation and fabrication of radial junction nanowire solar cells and
photodetectors, which have shown unprecedented performance and clearly
demonstrate the importance of radial junction for optoelectronic applications.
Our simulation results show that the proposed radial junction device is both
optically and electrically optimal for solar cell and photodetector
applications, especially if the absorber quality is extremely low. The radial
junction nanowire solar cells could achieve a 17.2% efficiency, whereas the
unbiased radial junction photodetector could show sensitivity down to a single
photon level using an absorber with a lifetime of less than 50 ps. In
comparison, the axial junction planar device made using same substrate as
absorber showed less than 1% solar cell efficiency and almost no photodetection
at 0 V. This study is conclusive experimental proof of the superiority of
radial junction nanowire devices over their thin film or axial junction
counterparts, especially when absorber lifetime is extremely low. The proposed
device holds huge promise for III-V based photovoltaics and photodetectors.

MnTe has recently attracted attention as an altermagnetic candidate.
Experimentally it has an altermagnetic order of ferromagnetic $ab$ planes,
stacked antiferromagnetically along $c$. We show that this magnetic order (by
itself non-trivial, since the in-plane exchange in antiferromagnetic) opens
intriguing possibility of manufacturing altermagnetically-detwinned samples and
generate observable magnetooptical response (which we calculate from first
principles) as a signature of altermagnetism.

The spectrum of charged particles in translation-invariant systems in a
magnetic field is characterized by the Landau levels, which play a fundamental
role in the thermodynamic and transport properties of solids. The topological
nature and the approximate degeneracy of the Landau levels are known to also
survive on crystalline lattices with discrete translation symmetry when the
magnetic flux through a primitive cell is small compared to the flux quantum.
Here we show that the notion of Landau levels and the quantum Hall effect can
be generalized to 2d non-crystalline lattices without spatial long-range order.
Remarkably, even when the spatial correlations decay over microscopic
distances, 2d systems can exhibit a number of well-resolved Landau-like bands.
The existence of these bands imply that non-crystalline systems in magnetic
fields can support the hallmark quantum effects which have been typically
associated with crystalline solids.

Solidification is an important process in many alloy processing routes. The
solidified microstructure of alloys is usually made up of dendrites, eutectics
or a combination of both. The evolving morphologies are largely determined by
the solidification process and thus many materials properties are dependent on
the processing conditions. While the growth of either type of microstructure is
well-investigated, there is little information on the coupled growth of both
microstructures. This work aims to close this gap by formulating a phase-field
model capable of reproducing dendritic, eutectic as well as dendritic-eutectic
growth. Following this, two-dimensional simulations are conducted which show
all three types of microstructures depending on the composition and processing
conditions. The effect of the dendritic-eutectic growth on the microstructural
lengths, which determine materials properties, is investigated and the
morphological hysteresis between eutectic growth and dendritic-eutectic growth
is studied by employing solidification velocity jumps. Further, the influence
of primary crystallization is investigated in large-scale two-dimensional
simulations. Finally, qualitative three-dimensional simulations are conducted
to test for morphological changes in the eutectic.

<h3>Transitions in Xenes between excitonic, topological and trivial  insulator phases: influence of screening, band dispersion and external  electric field</h3>

<br>
<br>
Using a variational approach, the binding energies $E_b$ of the lowest bound
excitons in Xenes under varying electric field are investigated. The internal
exciton motion is described both by Dirac electron dispersion and in
effective-mass approximation, while the screened electron-hole attraction is
modeled by a Rytova-Keldysh potential with a 2D electronic polarizability
$\alpha_{2{\rm D}}$. The most important parameters as spin-orbit-induced gap
$E_g$, Fermi velocity $v_F$ and $\alpha_{2{\rm D}}$ are taken from ab initio
density functional theory calculations. In addition, $\alpha_{2{\rm D}}$ is
approximated in two different ways. The relation of $E_b$ and $E_g$ is ruled by
the screening. The existence of an excitonic insulator phase with $E_b>E_g$
sensitively depends on the chosen $\alpha_{2{\rm D}}$. The values of $E_g$ and
$\alpha_{2{\rm D}}$ are strongly modified by a vertical external electric bias
$U$, which defines a transition from the topological into a trivial insulator
at $U=E_g/2$, with the exception of plumbene. Within the Dirac approximation,
but also within the effective mass description of the kinetic energy, the
treatment of screening dominates the appearance or non-appearance of an
excitonic insulator phase. Gating does not change the results: the prediction
done at zero electric field is confirmed when a vertical electric field is
applied. Finally, Many-Body perturbation theory approaches based on the Green's
function method, applied to stanene, confirm the absence of an excitonic
insulator phase, thus validating our results obtained by ab initio modeling of
$\alpha_{2{\rm D}}$.

We report the magnetization, ac susceptibility, and specific heat of
optically float-zoned single crystals of CePdAl$_{3}$. In comparison to the
properties of polycrystalline CePdAl$_{3}$ reported in the literature, which
displays a tetragonal crystal structure and no long-range magnetic order, our
single crystals exhibit an orthorhombic structure ($Cmcm$) and order
antiferromagnetically below a N\'eel temperature $T_{\rm N}$ = 5.6 K. The
specific heat at zero-field shows a clear $\lambda$-type anomaly with a broad
shoulder at $T_{\rm N}$. A conservative estimate of the Sommerfeld coefficient
of the electronic specific heat, $\gamma = 121~\mathrm{mJ~K^{-2}~mol^{-1}}$,
indicates a moderately enhanced heavy-fermion ground state. A twin
microstructure evolves in the family of planes spanned by the basal plane
lattice vectors $a_{\rm o}$ and $c_{\rm o}$, with the magnetic hard axis
$b_{\rm o}$ common to all twins. The antiferromagnetic state is characterized
by a strong magnetic anisotropy and a spin-flop transition induced under
magnetic field along the easy direction, resulting in a complex magnetic phase
diagram. Taken together our results reveal a high sensitivity of the magnetic
and electronic properties of CePdAl$_{3}$ to its structural modifications.

In the last few years, much efforts have gone into developing universal
machine-learning potentials able to describe interactions for a wide range of
structures and phases. Yet, as attention turns to more complex materials
including alloys, disordered and heterogeneous systems, the challenge of
providing reliable description for all possible environment become ever more
costly. In this work, we evaluate the benefits of using specific versus general
potentials for the study of activated mechanisms in solid-state materials. More
specifically, we tests three machine-learning fitting approaches using the
moment-tensor potential to reproduce a reference potential when exploring the
energy landscape around a vacancy in Stillinger-Weber silicon crystal and
silicon-germanium zincblende structure using the activation-relaxation
technique nouveau (ARTn). We find that a a targeted on-the-fly approach
specific and integrated to ARTn generates the highest precision on the
energetic and geometry of activated barriers, while remaining cost-effective.
This approach expands the type of problems that can be addressed with
high-accuracy ML potentials.

Novel quasi two dimensional typically layered semimetals offer a unique
opportunity to control the density and even the topology of the electronic
matter. In intercalated MoTe2 type II Weyl semimetal the tilt of the dispersion
relation cones is so large that topologically of the Fermi surface is distinct
from a more conventional type I. Superconductivity observed recently in this
compound [Zhang et al, 2D Materials 9, 045027 (2022)] demonstrated two puzzling
phenomena: the gate voltage has no impact on critical temperature, Tc, in wide
range of density, while it is very sensitive to the interlayer distance. The
phonon theory of pairing in a layered Weyl material including the effects of
Coulomb repulsion is constructed and explains the above two features in
MoTe2.The first feature turns out to be a general one for any type II
topological material, while the second reflects properties of the intercalated
materials affecting the Coulomb screening.

Photo-excitation at terahertz and mid-infrared frequencies has emerged as a
new way to manipulate functionalities in quantum materials, in some cases
creating non-equilibrium phases that have no equilibrium analogue. In
K$_3$C$_{60}$, a metastable zero-resistance phase was documented with optical
properties and pressure dependences compatible with non-equilibrium high
temperature superconductivity. Here, we report the discovery of a dominant
energy scale for this phenomenon, along with the demonstration of a giant
increase in photo-susceptibility near 10 THz excitation frequency. At these
drive frequencies a metastable superconducting-like phase is observed up to
room temperature for fluences as low as ~400 $\mu J/cm^2$. These findings shed
light on the microscopic mechanism underlying photo-induced superconductivity.
They also trace a path towards steady state operation, currently limited by the
availability of a suitable high-repetition rate optical source at these
frequencies.

Gate-defined quantum dots (QDs) have appealing attributes as a quantum
computing platform, however, near-term devices possess a range of possible
imperfections that need to be accounted for during the tuning and operation of
QD devices. One such problem is the capacitive cross-talk between the metallic
gates that define and control QD qubits. A way to compensate for the capacitive
cross-talk and enable targeted control of specific QDs independent of coupling
is by the use of virtual gates. Here, we demonstrate a reliable automated
capacitive coupling identification method that combines machine learning with
traditional fitting to take advantage of the desirable properties of each. We
also show how the cross-capacitance measurement may be used for the
identification of spurious QDs sometimes formed during tuning experimental
devices. Our systems can autonomously flag devices with spurious dots near the
operating regime which is crucial information for reliable tuning to a regime
suitable for qubit operations.

The quantum Hall (QH) effect in two-dimensional electron systems (2DESs) is
conventionally observed at liquid-helium temperatures, where lattice vibrations
are strongly suppressed and bulk carrier scattering is dominated by disorder.
However, due to large Landau level (LL) separation (~2000 K at B = 30 T),
graphene can support the QH effect up to room temperature (RT), concomitant
with a non-negligible population of acoustic phonons with a wave-vector
commensurate to the inverse electronic magnetic length. Here, we demonstrate
that graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) realizes a novel
transport regime, where dissipation in the QH phase is governed predominantly
by electron-phonon scattering. Investigating thermally-activated transport at
filling factor 2 up to RT in an ensemble of back-gated devices, we show that
the high B-field behaviour correlates with their zero B-field transport
mobility. By this means, we extend the well-accepted notion of phonon-limited
resistivity in ultra-clean graphene to a hitherto unexplored high-field realm.

The use of ensemble Monte Carlo (EMC) methods for the simulation of transport
in semiconductor devices has become extensive over the past few decades. This
method allows for simulation utilizing particles while addressing the full
physics within the device, leaving the computational difficulties to the
computer. More recently, the study of quantum mechanical effects within the
devices, effects which also strongly affect the carrier transport itself, have
become important. While particles have continued to be useful in quantum
simulations using Wigner functions, interest in analytical solutions based upon
the non-equilibrium Green's functions (NEGF) have become of greater interest in
device simulation. While NEGF has been adopted by many commercial
semiconductor, there remains considerable computational difficulty in this
approach. Here, a particle approach to NEGF is discussed, and preliminary
results presented illustrating the computational efficiency that remains with
the use of particles. This approach adopts the natural basis functions for use
in a high electric field and the preliminary results are obtained for quantum
transport in Si at 300 K. This approach appears to offer significant advantages
for the use of NEGF.

The kinetic energy of electrons in a magnetic field is quenched resulting in
a discrete set of highly degenerate Landau levels (LL) which gives rise to
fascinating phenomena like the de Haas-van Alphen effect (dHvAe) or the integer
and fractional quantum Hall effects. The latter is a result of interactions
partially lifting the degeneracy within a given LL while inter-LL interactions
are usually assumed to be unimportant. Here, we study the LL spectrum of the
Hatsugai-Kohmoto model, a Hubbard-like model which is exactly soluble on
account of infinite range interactions. For the doped Mott insulator phase in a
magnetic field we find that the degeneracy of LLs is preserved but inter-LL
interactions are important leading to a non-monotonous reconstruction of the
spectrum. As a result, strong LL repulsion leads to aperiodic quantum
oscillations of the dHvAe in contrast to Onsager's famous relation connecting
oscillation frequencies with the Fermi surface areas at zero field. In
addition, we find unconventional temperature dependencies of quantum
oscillations and interaction-induced effective mass renormalizations. We
discuss the general importance of inter-LL interactions for understanding doped
Mott insulators in magnetic fields.

We propose a class of pure states of two-dimensional lattice systems
realizing topological order associated with unitary rational vertex operator
algebras. We show that the states are well-defined in the thermodynamic limit
and have exponential decay of correlations. The construction provides a natural
way to insert anyons and compute certain topological invariants. It also gives
candidates for bosonic states in non-trivial invertible phases, including the
$E_8$ phase.

Many functionally relevant ferroic phenomena in quantum materials can be
manipulated by driving the lattice coherently with optical and terahertz
pulses. New physical phenomena and non-equilibrium phases that have no
equilibrium counterpart have been discovered following these protocols. The
underlying structural dynamics has been mostly studied by recording the average
atomic position along dynamical structural coordinates with elastic scattering
methods. However, crystal lattice fluctuations, which are known to influence
phase transitions in equilibrium, are also expected to determine these dynamics
but have rarely been explored. Here, we study the driven dynamics of the
quantum paraelectric SrTiO3, in which mid-infrared drives have been shown to
induce a metastable ferroelectric state. Crucial in these physics is the
competition between the polar instability and antiferrodistortive rotations,
which in equilibrium frustrate the formation of long-range ferroelectricity. We
make use of high intensity mid-infrared optical pulses to resonantly drive a
Ti-O stretching mode at 17 THz, and we measure the resulting change in lattice
fluctuations using time-resolved x-ray diffuse scattering at a free electron
laser. After a prompt increase, we observe a long-lived quench in R-point
antiferrodistortive lattice fluctuations. The enhancement and reduction in
lattice fluctuations are explained theoretically by considering fourth-order
nonlinear phononic interactions and third-order coupling to the driven optical
phonon and to lattice strain, respectively. These observations provide a number
of new and testable hypotheses for the physics of light-induced
ferroelectricity.

In the present article we investigate the nonlinear dynamics of microtubules,
the basic components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton, and rely on the known
general model. A crucial interaction among constitutive particles is modelled
using W-potential. Three kinds of this potential are studied, symmetrical and
two non-symmetrical. We demonstrate an advantage of the latter ones.

<h3>Controlling Uncertainty of Empirical First-Passage Times in the  Small-Sample Regime</h3>

We derive general bounds on the probability that the empirical first-passage
time $\overline{\tau}_n\equiv \sum_{i=1}^n\tau_i/n$ of a reversible ergodic
Markov process inferred from a sample of $n$ independent realizations deviates
from the true mean first-passage time by more than any given amount in either
direction. We construct non-asymptotic confidence intervals that hold in the
elusive small-sample regime and thus fill the gap between asymptotic methods
and the Bayesian approach that is known to be sensitive to prior belief and
tends to underestimate uncertainty in the small-sample setting. Our
concentration-of-measure-based results allow for model-free error control and
reliable error estimation in kinetic inference, and are thus important for the
analysis of experimental and simulation data in the presence of limited
sampling.

<h3>Space-charge region recombination in monocrystalline silicon-based  barrier structures with long lifetimes and its impact on key characteristics  of high-efficiency solar cells</h3>

<br>
<br>
The recombination rate in the space charge region (SCR) of a silicon-based
barrier structure with long Shockley-Reed-Hall lifetime is calculated
theoretically taking into account the concentration gradient of excess
electron-hole pairs in the base region. The effects of the SCR lifetime and the
applied voltage on the structure's ideality factor are analyzed. The ideality
factor is significantly reduced by the concentration gradient of electron-hole
pairs. This mechanism provides an increase of the effective lifetime compared
to the case when it is insignificant, which is realized at sufficiently low
pair concentrations. The theoretical results are shown to be in agreement with
experimental data.

Topology and many-body localization (MBL) have opened new avenues for
preserving quantum information at finite energy density. Resonant
delocalization plays a crucial role in destabilizing these phenomena. In this
work, we study the statistical properties of many-body resonances in a
disordered interacting Ising model - which can host symmetry protected
topological order - using a Clifford circuit encoding of the real space
renormalization group which allows the resonant properties of the wave
functions to be efficiently characterized. Our findings show that both the
trivial and topologically ordered MBL phases remain stable to the resonances,
but in the vicinity of the transition between them localization is destabilized
by resonance proliferation. Diverging susceptibility towards the development of
an avalanche instability suggests an intervening ergodic phase. We are also
able to access the local integrals of motion in the MBL phases and identify the
topological edge-mode operators in the ordered phase. Our results have
important implications for the stability of MBL and phase transitions between
distinct MBL phases with and without symmetries.
