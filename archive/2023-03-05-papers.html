<h3>Anomalous Random Telegraphy Signal in Suspended Graphene with Oxygen  Adsorption</h3>

Graphene is a promising material for sensing applications because of its
large specific surface area and low noise. In many applications, graphene will
inevitably be in contact with oxygen since it is the second most abundant gas
in the atmosphere. Therefore, it is of interest to understand how this gas
affects the sensor properties. In this work, the effect of oxygen on the
low-frequency noise of suspended graphene is demonstrated. Two devices with
suspended graphene nanoribbons with a width and length of 200 nm were
fabricated. The resistance as function of time was measured in vacuum and pure
oxygen atmospheres through an ac lock-in method. After signal processing with
wavelet denoising and analysis, it is demonstrated that oxygen causes random
telegraphy signal with an average dwell time of 2.95 milliseconds in the
high-resistance state, and 1.98 milliseconds in the low-resistance state. It is
also shown that this RTS occurs only at some periods, which indicates that,
upon adsorption, the molecules take some time until they find the most
energetically favorable adsorption state. Also, a slow-down in the RTS time
constants is observed, which infers that less active sites are available as
time goes on because of oxygen adsorption. Therefore, it is very important to
consider these effects to guarantee high sensitivity and high durability for
graphene-based sensors that will be exposed to oxygen during their lifetime.

<h3>Inertia suppresses signatures of activity of active Brownian particles  in a harmonic potential</h3>

A harmonically trapped active Brownian particle exhibits two types of
positional distributions -- one has a single peak, the other has a single well
-- that signify steady-state dynamics with low and high activity, respectively.
Adding inertia to the translational motion preserves this strict single
peak/well classification of the densities but shifts the dividing boundary
between the states in the parameter space. We characterize this shift for the
dynamics in one spatial dimension using the static Fokker--Planck equation for
the full joint distribution of the state space. We derive local results
analytically with a perturbation method for a small rotational velocity and
then extend them globally with a numerical approach

Quantum impurity models (QIMs) are ubiquitous throughout physics. As
simplified toy models they provide crucial insights for understanding more
complicated strongly correlated systems, while in their own right are accurate
descriptions of many experimental platforms. In equilibrium, their physics is
well understood and have proven a testing ground for many powerful theoretical
tools, both numerical and analytical, in use today. Their non-equilibrium
physics is much less studied and understood. However, the recent advancements
in non equilibrium integrable quantum systems through the development of
generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) coupled with the fact that many archetypal QIMs
are in fact integrable presents an enticing opportunity to enhance our
understanding of these systems. We take a step towards this by expanding the
framework of GHD to incorporate integrable interacting QIMs. We present a set
of Bethe-Boltzmann type equations which incorporate the effects of impurity
scattering and discuss the new aspects which include entropy production. These
impurity GHD equations are then used to study a bipartioning quench wherein a
relevant backscattering impurity is included at the location of the
bipartition. The density and current profiles are studied as a function of the
impurity strength and expressions for the entanglement entropy and full
counting statistics are derived.

<h3>Transition from Diffusive to Superdiffusive Transport in Carbon Nanotube  Networks via Nematic Order Control</h3>

<br>
The one-dimensional confinement of quasiparticles in individual carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) leads to extremely anisotropic electronic and optical
properties. In a macroscopic ensemble of randomly oriented CNTs, this
anisotropy disappears together with other properties that make them attractive
for certain device applications. The question however remains if not only
anisotropy, but other types of behaviours are suppressed by disorder. Here, we
compare the dynamics of quasiparticles under strong electric fields in aligned
and random CNT networks using a combination of terahertz emission and
photocurrent experiments and out-of-equilibrium numerical simulations. We find
that the degree of alignment strongly influences the excited quasiparticles'
dynamics, rerouting the thermalisation pathways. This is, in particular,
evidenced in the high-energy, high-momentum electronic population (probed
through the formation of low energy excitons via exciton impact ionization) and
the transport regime evolving from diffusive to superdiffusive.

<h3>Reentrant condensation transition in a model of driven scalar active  matter with diffusivity edge</h3>

<i>Jonas Berx, Aritra Bose, Ramin Golestanian, Beno√Æt Mahault</i>
<br>
<br>
The effect of a diffusivity edge is studied in a system of scalar active
matter confined by a periodic potential and driven by an externally applied
force. We find that this system shows qualitatively distinct stationary regimes
depending on the amplitude of the driving force with respect to the potential
barrier. For small driving, the diffusivity edge induces a transition to a
condensed phase analogous to the Bose-Einstein-like condensation reported for
the nondriven case, which is characterized by a density-independent steady
state current. Conversely, large external forces lead to a qualitatively
different phase diagram since in this case condensation is only possible beyond
a given density threshold, while the associated transition at higher densities
is found to be reentrant.

<h3>Mechano-chemical active feedback generates convergence extension in  epithelial tissue</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02109" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02109</a>
<br>
<i>Aondoyima Ioratim-Uba, Tanniemola B. Liverpool, Silke Henkes</i>
<br>
<br>
Convergence extension, the simultaneous elongation of tissue along one axis
while narrowing along a perpendicular axis, occurs during embryonic
development. A fundamental process that contributes to shaping the organism, it
happens in many different species and tissue types. Here we present a minimal
continuum model, that can be directly linked to the controlling microscopic
biochemistry, which shows spontaneous convergence extension. It is comprised of
a 2D viscoelastic active material with a mechano-chemical active feedback
mechanism coupled to a substrate via friction. Robust convergent extension
behaviour emerges beyond a critical value of the activity parameter and is
controlled by the boundary conditions and the coupling to the substrate.
Oscillations and spatial patterns emerge in this model when internal
dissipation dominates over friction, as well as in the active elastic limit.

<h3>Complex semiclassical theory for non-Hermitian quantum systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01525" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01525</a>
<br>
<i>Guang Yang, Yongkang Li, Yongxu Fu, Zhenduo Wang, Yi Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
Non-Hermitian quantum systems exhibit various novel characteristics, such as
exotic topological phenomena and non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), yet their
exponential localization and non-orthogonal eigenstates stranglehold analysis
and calculations. The potent semiclassical theory, which offers physical
pictures and quantitative results for various Hermitian systems, remains
limited in non-Hermitian systems. Here, we establish a complex semiclassical
theory for non-Hermitian quantum systems as a straightforward analytical
continuation of quantization conditions and physical variables, such as
momentum, position, time, and energy, with consistent physical interpretations.
Generally applicable to continuous and lattice models, such complex
semiclassical theory yields accurate complex energy spectra (e.g., Landau
levels) and quantum states, presenting a helpful bedrock towards interesting
physics such as nontrivial topology, NHSE, and their interplay.

<h3>Perfectly localized Majorana corner modes in fermionic lattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01535" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01535</a>
<br>
<i>Prathyush P. Poduval, Thomas L. Schmidt, Andreas Haller</i>
<br>
<br>
Focusing on examples of Majorana zero modes on the corners of a
two-dimensional lattice, we introduce a method to find parameter regions where
the Majorana modes are perfectly localized on a single site. Such a limit
allows us to study the dimerization structure of the sparse bulk Hamiltonian
that results in the higher-order topology of the system. Furthermore, such
limits typically provide an analytical understanding of the system energy
scales. Based on the dimerization structure we extract from the two-dimensional
model, we identify a more general stacking procedure to construct Majorana zero
modes in arbitrary corners of a $d$-dimensional hypercube, which we demonstrate
explicitly in $d\leq3$.

<h3>Temperature-dependent elastic constants of thorium dioxide probed using  time-domain Brillouin scattering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01539" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01539</a>
<br>
<i>Amey Khanolkar, Yuzhou Wang, Cody A. Dennett, Zilong Hua, J. Matthew Mann, Marat Khafizov, David H. Hurley</i>
<br>
<br>
We report the adiabatic elastic constants of single-crystal thorium dioxide
over a temperature range of 77 - 350 K. Time-domain Brillouin scattering
(TDBS), an all-optical, non-contact picosecond ultrasonic technique, is used to
generate and detect coherent acoustic phonons that propagate in the bulk
perpendicular to the surface of the crystal. These coherent acoustic lattice
vibrations have been monitored in two hydrothermally grown single-crystal
thorium dioxide samples along the (100) and (311) crystallographic directions.
The three independent elastic constants of the cubic crystal (C11, C12 and C44)
are determined from the measured bulk acoustic velocities. The longitudinal
wave along the (100) orientation provided a direct measurement of C11.
Measurement of C44 and C12 was achieved by enhancing the intensity of
quasi-shear mode in a (311) oriented crystal by adjusting the polarization
angle relative to the crystal axes. We find the magnitude of softening of the
three elastic constants to be ~2.5% over the measured temperature range. Good
agreement is found between the measured elastic constants with previously
reported values at room temperature, and between the measured
temperature-dependent bulk modulus with calculated values. We find that
semi-empirical models capturing lattice anharmonicity adequately reproduce the
observed trend. We also determine the acoustic Gruneisen anharmonicity
parameter from the experimentally derived temperature-dependent bulk modulus
and previously reported temperature-dependent values of volume thermal
expansion coefficient and heat capacity. This work presents measurements of the
temperature-dependent elasticity in single-crystal thorium dioxide at cryogenic
temperature and provides a basis for testing ab initio theoretical models and
evaluating the impact of anharmonicity on thermophysical properties.

<h3>Exciton-assisted electron tunneling in van der Waals heterostructures</h3>

<br>
<br>
The control of elastic and inelastic electron tunneling relies on materials
with well defined interfaces. Van der Waals materials made of two-dimensional
constituents form an ideal platform for such studies. Signatures of acoustic
phonons and defect states have been observed in current-to-voltage ($I-V$)
measurements. These features can be explained by direct electron-phonon or
electron-defect interactions. Here, we use a novel tunneling process that
involves excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). We study tunnel
junctions consisting of graphene and gold electrodes separated by hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN) with an adjacent TMD monolayer and observe prominent
resonant features in $I-V$ measurements. These resonances appear at bias
voltages that correspond to TMD exciton energies. By placing the TMD outside of
the tunneling pathway, we demonstrate that this phonon-exciton mediated
tunneling process does not require any charge injection into the TMD. This work
demonstrates the appearance of optical modes in electrical transport
measurements and introduces a new functionality for optoelectronic devices
based on van der Waals materials.

<h3>Memory-multi-fractional Brownian motion with continuous correlations</h3>

<i>Wei Wang, Michal Balcerek, Krzysztof Burnecki, Aleksei V. Chechkin, Skirmantas Janusonis, Jakub Slezak, Thomas Vojta, Agnieszka Wylomanska, Ralf Metzler</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a generalization of the widely used fractional Brownian motion
(FBM), memory-multi-FBM (MMFBM), to describe viscoelastic or persistent
anomalous diffusion with time-dependent memory exponent $\alpha(t)$ in a
changing environment. In MMFBM the built-in, long-range memory is continuously
modulated by $\alpha(t)$. We derive the essential statistical properties of
MMFBM such as response function, mean-squared displacement (MSD),
autocovariance function, and Gaussian distribution. In contrast to existing
forms of FBM with time-varying memory exponents but reset memory structure, the
instantaneous dynamic of MMFBM is influenced by the process history, e.g., we
show that after a step-like change of $\alpha(t)$ the scaling exponent of the
MSD after the $\alpha$-step may be determined by the value of $\alpha(t)$
before the change. MMFBM is a versatile and useful process for correlated
physical systems with non-equilibrium initial conditions in a changing
environment.

<h3>Quantum Electrodynamics in 2+1 Dimensions as the Organizing Principle of  a Triangular Lattice Antiferromagnet</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01585" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01585</a>
<br>
<i>Alexander Wietek, Sylvain Capponi, Andreas M. L√§uchli</i>
<br>
<br>
Quantum electrodynamics in $2+1$ dimensions (QED$_3$) has been proposed as a
critical field theory describing the low-energy effective theory of a putative
algebraic Dirac spin liquid or of quantum phase transitions in two-dimensional
frustrated magnets. We provide compelling evidence that the intricate spectrum
of excitations of the elementary but strongly frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg
model on the triangular lattice is in one-to-one correspondence to a zoo of
excitations from QED$_3$, in the quantum spin liquid regime. This includes a
large manifold of explicitly constructed monopole and bilinear excitations of
QED$_3$, which is thus shown to serve as an organizing principle of phases of
matter in triangular lattice antiferromagnets and their low-lying excitations.
Moreover, we observe signatures of an emergent valence bond solid (VBS), which
suggests a scenario where only the critical point of a transition from the
$120^\circ$ N\'eel order to a VBS is described by QED$_3$. Our results are
obtained by comparing ansatz wave functions from a parton construction to exact
eigenstates obtained using large-scale exact diagonalization up to $N=48$
sites.

<h3>Quantum-Geometric Light-Matter Coupling in Correlated Quantum Materials</h3>

<br>

Irradiation with light provides a powerful tool to interrogate, control or
induce new quantum states of matter out of equilibrium, however a microscopic
understanding of light-matter coupling in interacting electron systems remains
a profound challenge. Here, we show that light grants a new quantum-geometric
handle to steer and probe correlated quantum materials, whereby photons can
couple directly to the shape and center of the maximally-localized Wannier
functions that comprise the material's interacting bands, dressing both
electronic motion and electronic interactions with light. Notably, this effect
is generic to any material and purely geometric in origin, but dominates
emergent optical responses in correlated electron systems with poorly localized
or obstructed Wannier functions. Spectroscopic consequences are first
illustrated for a paradigmatic strongly interacting model with a tunable
Wannier obstruction. We then present ramifications for non-equilibrium control
of moir\'e heterostructures and find that subjecting magic-angle twisted
bilayer graphene to weak THz radiation can conspire with a fragile topological
obstruction to profoundly alter the material's competing interactions and tune
across boundaries to competing phases.

A buckled sheet offers a reservoir of material that can be unfurled at a
later time. For sufficiently thin yet stiff materials, this geometric process
has a striking mechanical feature: when the slack runs out, the material locks
to further extension. Here we establish a simple route to a tunable locking
material - a system with an interval where it is freely deformable under a
given deformation mode, and where the endpoints of this interval can be changed
continuously over a wide range. We demonstrate this type of mechanical response
in a thin cylindrical shell subjected to axial twist and compression, and we
rationalize our results with a simple geometric model.

<h3>Anharmonic Fluctuations Govern the Band Gap of Halide Perovskites</h3>

<i>Stefan A. Seidl, Xiangzhou Zhu, Guy Reuveni, Sigalit Aharon, Christian Gehrmann, Sebasti√°n Caicedo-D√°vila, Omer Yaffe, David A. Egger</i>
<br>
<br>
We determine the impact of anharmonic thermal vibrations on the fundamental
band gap of CsPbBr$_3$, a prototypical model system for the broader class of
halide perovskite semiconductors. Through first-principles molecular dynamics
and stochastic calculations, we find that anharmonic fluctuations are a key
effect in the electronic structure of these materials. We present experimental
and theoretical evidence that important characteristics, such as a mildly
changing band-gap value across a temperature range that includes
phase-transitions, cannot be explained by harmonic phonons thermally perturbing
an average crystal structure and symmetry. Instead, the thermal characteristics
of the electronic structure are microscopically connected to anharmonic
vibrational contributions to the band gap that reach a fairly large magnitude
of 450 meV at 425 K.

<h3>Perturbative solution of fermionic sign problem in lattice Quantum Monte  Carlo</h3>

We develop a strong-coupling perturbation scheme for a generic Hubbard model
around a half-filled particle-hole-symmetric reference system, which is free
from the fermionic sign problem. The approach is based on the lattice
determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method in continuous and discrete time
versions for large periodic clusters in a fermionic bath. Considering the
first-order perturbation in the shift of the chemical potential and of the
second-neighbour hopping gives an accurate electronic spectral function for a
parameter range corresponding to the optimally doped cuprate system for
temperature of the order of $T=0.1t$, the region hardly accessible for the
straightforward lattice QMC calculations. We discuss the formation of the
pseudogap and the nodal-antinodal dichotomy for a doped Hubbard system in a
strong-coupling regime with the interaction parameter $U$ equal to the
bandwidth and the optimal value of the next-nearest-neighbor hopping parameter
$t'$ for high-temperature superconducting cuprates.

<h3>Theory of Topological Nernst and Thermoelectric Transport in Chiral  Magnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01609" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01609</a>
<br>
<i>Zachariah Addison, Lauren Keyes, Mohit Randeria</i>
<br>
<br>
We calculate the thermoelectric transport of spin-orbit coupled conduction
electrons in the presence of topological spin textures. We show, within a
controlled, semiclassical approach that includes all phase space Berry
curvatures, that the Nernst effect has two contributions in addition to the
usual effect proportional to a magnetic field. These are an anomalous
contribution governed by the momentum-space Berry curvature and proportional to
net magnetization, and a topological contribution determined by the real-space
Berry curvature and proportional to the topological charge density, which is
non-zero in skyrmion phases. We derive a generalized Mott relation expressing
the thermoelectric tensor as the chemical potential derivative of the
conductivity tensor and show how the Sondheimer cancellation in the Nernst
effect is evaded in chiral magnets.

<h3>Orbital character of the spin-reorientation transition in TbMn$_6$Sn$_6$</h3>

Ferromagnetic (FM) order in a two-dimensional kagome layer is predicted to
generate a topological Chern insulator without an applied magnetic field. The
Chern gap is largest when spin moments point perpendicular to the kagome layer,
enabling the capability to switch topological transport properties, such as the
quantum anomalous Hall effect, by controlling the spin orientation. In
TbMn$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$, the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of the Tb$^{3+}$ ion is
effective at generating the Chern state within the FM Mn kagome layers while a
spin-reorientation (SR) transition to easy-plane order above $T_{SR}=310$ K
provides a mechanism for switching. Here, we use inelastic neutron scattering
to provide key insights into the fundamental nature of the SR transition. The
observation of two Tb excitations, which are split by the magnetic anisotropy
energy, indicates an effective two-state orbital character for the Tb ion, with
a uniaxial ground state and an isotropic excited state. The simultaneous
observation of both modes below $T_{SR}$ confirms that orbital fluctuations are
slow on magnetic and electronic time scales $<$ ps and act as a
spatially-random orbital alloy. A thermally-driven critical concentration of
isotropic Tb ions triggers the SR transition.

<h3>Downslope granular flow through a forest of obstacles</h3>

We investigate the effect of a forest of pillars on a granular layer steadily
flowing over a rough inclined plane. We quantify experimentally how the steady
flow rate of grains is affected by the inter-pillars distance for different
layer thicknesses and slope angles. We then propose a model based on a
depth-average approximation associated with $\mu(I)$ rheology that considers
the additional force exerted by the pillars on the granular layer. This model
succeeds in accounting for most of the observed results when taking into
account some inertia due to the nonvanishing Froude number of the flow.

The buckling instabilities of core-shell systems, comprising an interior
elastic sphere, attached to an exterior shell, have been proposed to underlie
myriad biological morphologies. To fully discuss such systems, however, it is
important to properly understand the elasticity of the spherical core. Here, by
exploiting well-known properties of the solid harmonics, we present a simple,
direct method for solving the linear elastic problem of spheres and spherical
voids with surface deformations, described by a real spherical harmonic. We
calculate the corresponding bulk elastic energies, providing closed-form
expressions for any values of the spherical harmonic degree (l), Poisson ratio,
and shear modulus. We find that the elastic energies are independent of the
spherical harmonic index (m). Using these results, we revisit the buckling
instability experienced by a core-shell system comprising an elastic sphere,
attached within a membrane of fixed area, that occurs when the area of the
membrane sufficiently exceeds the area of the unstrained sphere [C. Fogle, A.
C. Rowat, A. J. Levine and J. Rudnick, Phys. Rev. E 88, 052404 (2013)]. We
determine the phase diagram of the core-shell sphere's shape, specifying what
value of l is realized as a function of the area mismatch and the core-shell
elasticity. We also determine the shape phase diagram for a spherical void
bounded by a fixed-area membrane.

<h3>A New Two-Dimensional Dirac Semimetal Based on the Alkaline Earth Metal,  CaP$_3$</h3>

Using an evolutionary algorithm in combination with first-principles density
functional theory calculations, we identify two-dimensional (2D) CaP$_3$
monolayer as a new Dirac semimetal due to inversion and nonsymmorphic spatial
symmetries of the structure. This new topological material, composed of light
elements, exhibits high structural stability (higher than the phase known in
the literature), which is confirmed by thermodynamic and kinetic stability
analysis. Moreover, it satisfies the electron filling criteria, so that its
Dirac state is located near the Fermi level. The existence of the Dirac state
predicted by the theoretical symmetry analysis is also confirmed by
first-principles electronic band structure calculations. We find that the
energy position of the Dirac state can be tuned by strain, while the Dirac
state is unstable against an external electric field since it breaks the
spatial inversion symmetry. Our findings should be instrumental in the
development of 2D Dirac fermions based on light elements for their application
in nanoelectronic devices and topological electronics.

<h3>Revealing the hidden dynamics of confined water in acrylate polymers:  Insights from hydrogen-bond lifetime analysis</h3>

Polymers contain functional groups that participate in hydrogen bond (H-bond)
with water molecules, establishing a robust H-bond network that influences bulk
properties. This study utilized molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine
the H-bonding dynamics of water molecules confined within three
poly(meth)acrylates: poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate) (PMEA), poly(2-hydroxyethyl
methyl acrylate) (PHEMA), and poly(1-methoxymethyl acrylate) (PMC1A). Results
showed that H-bonding dynamics significantly slowed as the water content
decreased. Additionally, the diffusion of water molecules and its correlation
with H-bond breakage were analyzed. Our findings suggest that when the H-bonds
between water molecules and the methoxy oxygen of PMEA are disrupted, those
water molecules persist in close proximity and do not diffuse on a picosecond
timescale. In contrast, the water molecules H-bonded with the hydroxy oxygen of
PHEMA and the methoxy oxygen of PMC1A diffuse concomitantly with the breakage
of H-bonds. These results provide an in-depth understanding of the impact of
polymer functional groups on H-bonding dynamics.

<h3>On The Patterns of The Fisher's Zeros Maps to Classify Phase Transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01654" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01654</a>
<br>
<i>J. C. S. Rocha, B.V. Costa</i>
<br>
<br>
Phase transition is one of the most interesting natural phenomena and until
nowadays several techniques are being developed to study it. One of the main
concerns in the topic is how to classify a specific transition as being of
first, second, or even of a higher order, according to the Ehrenfest
classification. The partition function provides all the thermodynamic
information about the physical system, and a phase transition can be identified
by the complex temperature where it is equal to zero. In addition, the pattern
of the zeros on the complex temperature plan can provide evidences of the order
of the transition. In this manuscript, we present an analytical and
simulational study connecting the microcanonical analysis of the unstable
region of the entropy to the canonical partition function zeros. We show that
for the first-order transition the zeros accumulate uniformly in a vertical
line on the complex inverse temperature plane as discussed in previous works.
We illustrated our calculation using the $147$ particles Lennard-Jones cluster.
In the second-order case the zeros can assume different slops, besides that the
inverse distance between them following a power law with exponent $0<\alpha<1$.
For higher order phase transitions $\alpha > 1$ is expected. We studied the 2D
square lattice Ising model where we found $\alpha \approx 1.4$ which is
inconsistent with the expected transition for this model.

<h3>Atomtronic superconducting quantum interference device in synthetic  dimensions</h3>

<i>Wenxi Lai, Yu-Quan Ma, Yi-Wen Wei</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose atomtronic counterpart of superconducting quantum interference
device (SQUID) in synthetic $2$-dimensional space. The system is composed of
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in two neighboring optical wells which is
coupled to an external coherent light. Furthermore, availability of
controllable atomtronic flux qubit in the synthetic dimensions is demonstrated
with this system. Control parameter for the qubit is naturally provided by
artificial magnetic flux originated from the coherent atom-light coupling.
Comparing with traditional SQUID which requires at least $2$-dimensional
circuits, the synthetic dimensional SQUID can be realized only in
$1$-dimensional circuits. It should be a great advantage for the scalability
and integration feature of quantum logic gates.

<br>
<br>
In this work, the thermal transport properties of thorium dioxide (ThO$_2$,
thoria) with low levels of substitutional uranium (U) doping are explored. We
observe strong indications of resonant phonon scattering, an interaction
between phonons and electronic degrees of freedom, induced by this doping in
addition to common ``impurity'' scattering due to mass and interatomic force
constant differences. Uranium doping levels of 6\%, 9\%, and 16\% were studied
in a single hydrothermally synthesized U-doped thoria crystal with
spatially-varying U doping levels. Within this crystal, isoconcentration
regions with relatively uniform doping were located for local thermal
conductivity measurements using a thermoreflectance technique. The measured
thermal conductivity profiles in the temperature range of 77--300~K are
compared to predictions of an analytical Klemens-Callaway thermal conductivity
model to identify impacts from different phonon scattering mechanisms. Highly
suppressed thermal conductivity at cryogenic temperatures at these doping
levels suggests that phonon resonant scattering plays an important role in
thermal conductivity reduction in U-doped thoria.

<h3>Light Induced Magnetization in Superconductors via Inverse Faraday  Effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01699" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01699</a>
<br>
<i>Priya Sharma, Alexander V. Balatsky</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider a purely optical mechanism to induce magnetization in
superconductors in the absence of applied dc magnetic fields. A static local
magnetic moment is induced via the inverse Faraday effect(IFE) on the
application of light. This induced moment can be large enough to create
topological excitations, i.e. vortices in conventional superconductors in the
zero-field limit. The effect can be enhanced by tuning the magnitude of the
superconducting order parameter. For a superconducting film illuminated by
circularly polarized THz light, we estimate the induced moment to be on the
scale of $0.1 \mu_B$ per unit cell. We present a microscopic calculation of the
induced local field that can "write on" the magnetization in the superconductor
and generate vortices.

<h3>Distinguishing and controlling Mottness in 1T-TaS$_2$ by ultrafast light</h3>

<i>Changhua Bao, Haoyuan Zhong, Fei Wang, Tianyun Lin, Haoxiong Zhang, Zhiyuan Sun, Wenhui Duan, Shuyun Zhou</i>
<br>
<br>
Distinguishing and controlling the extent of Mottness is important for
materials where the energy scales of the onsite Coulomb repulsion U and the
bandwidth W are comparable. Here we report the ultrafast electronic dynamics of
1T-TaS$_2$ by ultrafast time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. A
comparison of the electron dynamics for the newly-discovered intermediate phase
(I-phase) as well as the low-temperature commensurate charge density wave
(C-CDW) phase shows distinctive dynamics. While the I-phase is characterized by
an instantaneous response and nearly time-resolution-limited fast relaxation
(~200 fs), the C-CDW phase shows a delayed response and a slower relaxation (a
few ps). Such distinctive dynamics refect the different relaxation mechanisms
and provide nonequilibrium signatures to distinguish the Mott insulating
I-phase from the C-CDW band insulating phase. Moreover, a light-induced
bandwidth reduction is observed in the C-CDW phase, pushing it toward the Mott
insulating phase. Our work demonstrates the power of ultrafast light-matter
interaction in both distinguishing and controlling the extent of Mottness on
the ultrafast timescale.

<br>
<br>
The creation of aligning layers for the uniform orientation of liquid
crystals is an important goal for both, research and application of liquid
crystals. For all applications the creation of aligning layers possessing
controllable characteristics such as azimuthal and polar anchoring energies,
easy-axis of director alignment and pre-tilt angle, in the same way as it is
achieved by using photoaligning layers processed by light, is very important.
Here, aligning properties of the hybrid aligning layers created on the basis of
sapphire surfaces additionally coated by photoaligning layer of PVCN-F are
studied. These hybrid layers have the properties of both, the nano-structured
sapphire layer and the photosensitive PVCN-F layer, and complement each other.
The dependence of the azimuthal anchoring energy of the hybrid layers on
irradiation time is studied. By using certain experimental conditions during
irradiation of hybrid layers e.g. polarisation of light and irradiation time, a
minimum value of azimuthal anchoring energy, close to zero, was obtained. AFM
studies of the irradiated hybrid layers were also carried out. It was found
that the behaviour of the contact angle values of nematic droplets placed on
treated sapphire surfaces are in good agreement with properties of hybrid
aligning layers and parameters of structuring surface obtained from AFM images.

<h3>Aharonov-Bohm interference and phase-coherent surface-state transport in  topological insulator rings</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present low-temperature magnetotransport measurements on selectively-grown
Sb$_2$Te$_3$-based topological insulator ring structures. These topological
insulator ring geometries display clear Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in the
conductance originating from phase-coherent transport around the ring. The
temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude indicates that the
Aharonov-Bohm oscillations originate from ballistic transport along the ring
arms. The oscillations can therefore be attributed to topological surface
states, which can maintain a quasi-ballistic transport regime in the presence
of disorder. Further insight on the phase coherence is gained by comparing with
similar Aharonov-Bohm-type oscillations in topological insulator nanoribbons
exposed to an axial magnetic field. Here, quasi-ballistic phase-coherent
transport is confirmed for closed-loop topological surface states in transverse
direction enclosing the cross-section of the nanoribbon. In contrast, the
appearance of universal conductance fluctuations indicates phase-coherent
transport in the diffuse regime, which is attributed to bulk carrier transport.
Thus, it appears that even in the presence of diffusive $p$-type charge
carriers in Aharonov-Bohm ring structures, phase-coherent quasi-ballistic
transport of topologically protected surface states is maintained over long
distances.

<h3>Kittel law and domain formation mechanism in PbTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$  superlattices</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report second-principles simulations on the structural and energetic
properties of domains in (PbTiO$_{3}$)$_{n}$/(SrTiO$_{3}$)$_{n}$ superlattices.
For the explored layer thickness ($n$ ranging between 8 and 16 unit cells) and
lateral sizes of the domains, the most stable configuration corresponds to
polar domains separated by a sequence of counter-rotating vortices
(clockwise/counterclockwise) perpendicular to the stacking direction and acting
as domain walls. The balance between the domain wall energy and the
electrostatic energy yields to an optimal domain period $\omega$ that is
proportional to the square-root of the thickness of the PbTiO$_{3}$ layer,
following the Kittel law. For a given lateral size of the simulation box,
suboptimal domain structures (with a width larger than the one predicted by the
Kittel law) can be obtained in a metastable form. However, at finite
temperature, molecular dynamics simulations show the spontaneous change of
periodicity, which implies the formation of new domains whose generation is
initiated by the nucleation of vortices and antivortices at the interface
between the SrTiO$_{3}$ and the PbTiO$_{3}$ layers. The vortices progressively
elongate and eventually annihilate with the antivortices yielding the formation
of new domains to comply the Kittel law via a topological phase transition.

<h3>Entropic Stabilization and Descriptors of Structural Transformation in  High Entropy Alloys</h3>

With first-principles theoretical analysis of the local structure using Bond
Orientational Order parameters and Voronoi partitioning, we establish (a)
HCP$\rightarrow$BCC structural transformation in high-entropy alloys (HEAs)
Nb$_x$(HfZrTi)$_y$ at 16% Nb-concentration, and (b) that the internal lattice
distortions (ILDs) peak at the transition. We demonstrate that the relative
stability of HCP and BCC structures is driven by energetics, while the overall
stability is achieved with contribution from the vibrational entropy that
exceeds the configurational entropy of mixing. We show that along with atomic
size mismatch, low average number ($< $5) of valence electrons and disparity in
the crystal structures of constituent elements are responsible for larger ILDs
in Nb$_x$(HfZrTi)$_y$ than in HEAs like Nb$_a$Mo$_b$W$_c$Ta$_d$.

<br>
<br>
As materials with suppressed ordering temperatures and enhanced ground state
entropies, frustrated magnetic oxides are ideal candidates for cryogenic
magnetocaloric refrigeration. While previous materials design has focused on
tuning the magnetic moments, their interactions, and density of moments on the
lattice, there has been relatively little attention to frustrated lattices.
Prior theoretical work has shown that the magnetocaloric cooling rate at the
saturation field is proportional to a macroscopic number of soft mode
excitations that arise due to the classical ground state degeneracy. The number
of these modes is directly determined by the geometry of the frustrating
lattice. For corner-sharing geometries, the pyrochlore has 50\% more modes than
the garnet and kagome lattices, whereas the edge-sharing \emph{fcc} has only a
subextensive number of soft modes. Here, we study the role of soft modes in the
magnetocaloric effect of four large-spin Gd$^{3+}$ ($L=0$, $J=S=7/2$)
Heisenberg antiferromagnets on a kagome, garnet, pyrochlore, and \emph{fcc}
lattice. By comparing measurements of the magnetic entropy change $\Delta S_m$
of these materials at fields up to $9$~T with predictions using mean-field
theory and Monte Carlo simulations, we are able to understand the relative
importance of spin correlations and quantization effects. We observe that
tuning the value of the nearest neighbor coupling has a more dominant
contribution to the magnetocaloric entropy change in the liquid-He cooling
regime ($2$-$20$~K), rather than tuning the number of soft mode excitations.
Our results inform future materials design in terms of dimensionality, degree
of magnetic frustration, and lattice geometry.

<br>
<br>
The (Cd, Be)Te semiconductor alloy that exhibits a dramatic mismatch in bond
covalency and stiffness clarifying its vibrational and mechanical properties is
used as a benchmark to test the limits of the percolation model (PM) worked out
to explain the complex Raman spectra of the related but less contrasted (Zn,
Be) chalcogenides. The test is done by way of experiment (x smaller than 0.11)
combining Raman scattering with X ray diffraction at high pressure and ab
initio calculations (x around 0, 0.5 and 1). The (macroscopic) bulk modulus B
drops below the CdTe value on minor Be incorporation, at variance with a linear
B versus x increase predicted ab initio, thus hinting at large anharmonic
effects in the real crystal. Yet, no anomaly occurs at the microscopic (bond)
scale as the regular bimodal PM Raman signal predicted ab initio for the BeTe
bond in minority (x around 0 and 0.5) is (barely) detected experimentally.
Although at large Be content (x around 1) the same bimodal signal relaxes down
to inversion, an unprecedented case, specific pressure dependencies of the
regular (x around 0 and 0.5) and inverted (x around 1) BeTe Raman doublets are
in line with PM predictions. Hence, the PM applies as such to (Cd, Be)Te albeit
in a relaxed form, without further refinement. This enhances the scheme
validity as a generic descriptor of phonons in alloys.

A bicircular light (BCL) consists of left and right circularly polarized
lights with different frequencies, and draws a rose-like pattern with a
rotational symmetry determined by the ratio of the two frequencies. Here we
show that an application of a BCL to centrosymmetric systems allows a
photocurrent generation through introduction of an effective polarity to the
system. We derive formulas for the BCL-induced photocurrent from a standard
perturbation theory, which is then applied to a simple 1D model and 3D
Dirac/Weyl semimetals. A nonperturbative effect with strong light intensity is
also discussed with the Floquet technique.

Recently, an exciting discovery of orientation-dependent superconductivity
was made in two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the interfaces of
LaAlO$_3$/KTaO$_3$ (LAO/KTO) or EuO/KTaO$_3$ (EuO/KTO). The superconducting
transition temperature can reach a $T_c$ of up to $\sim$ 2.2 K, which is
significantly higher than its 3$d$ counterpart LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ (LAO/STO)
with a $T_c$ of $\sim$ 0.2 K. However, the underlying origin remains to be
understood. To uncover the nature of electrons in KTO-based interfaces, we
employ x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic x-ray
spectroscopy (RIXS) to study LAO/KTO and EuO/KTO with different orientations.
We reveal the absence of $dd$ orbital excitations in all the measured samples.
Our RIXS results are well reproduced by calculations that considered itinerant
$5d$ electrons hybridized with O $2p$ electrons. This suggests that there is a
lack of localized Ta $5d^1$ electrons in KTO interface superconductors, which
is consistent with the absence of magnetic hysteresis observed in
magneto-resistance (MR) measurements. These findings offer new insights into
our understanding of superconductivity in Ta $5d$ interface superconductors and
their potential applications.

pressure strongly modifies the interlayer exchange interaction strength, by
1700 % at P = 6 GPa, and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy parameters,
providing the unique oportunity explore the magnetic phase diagram of this
anisotropic antiferromagnet. By probing the evolution of excitons in this bulk
material, we describe the different magnetic phases by extracting the
saturation magnetic field at different values of the applied pressure. We
generate a spin-flop magnetic phase which is stabilized because of the modified
competition between interlayer exchange and magnetocrystalline anisotropy.

Electrically controlled rotation of spins in a semiconducting channel is a
prerequisite for the successful realization of many spintronic devices, like,
e.g., the spin field effect transistor (sFET). To date, there have been only a
few reports on electrically controlled spin precession in sFET-like devices.
These devices operated in the ballistic regime, as postulated in the original
sFET proposal, and hence need high SOC channel materials in practice. Here, we
demonstrate gate-controlled precession of spins in a non-ballistic sFET using
an array of narrow diffusive wires as a channel between a spin source and a
spin drain. Our study shows that spins traveling in a semiconducting channel
can be coherently rotated on a distance far exceeding the electrons mean free
path, and spin-transistor functionality can be thus achieved in non-ballistic
channels with relatively low SOC, relaxing two major constraints of the
original sFET proposal.

<h3>Signatures of electric field and layer separation effects on the  spin-valley physics of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers: from energy bands to  dipolar excitons</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the spin-valley physics (SVP) in MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$
heterobilayers under external electric field (EF) and changes of the interlayer
distance (ID). We analyze the spin ($S_z$) and orbital ($L_z$) degrees of
freedom, and the symmetry properties of relevant band edges (at K, Q, and
$\Gamma$ points) in high-symmetry stackings at 0$^0$ (R-type) and 60$^0$
(H-type) angles, the important building blocks of moir\'e or atomically
reconstructed structures. We reveal distinct hybridization signatures of $S_z$
and $L_z$ in low-energy bands due to the wave function mixing between the
layers, which are stacking-dependent and can be further modified by EF and ID.
The H-type stackings favor large changes in the g-factors under EF, e. g. from
$-5$ to $3$ in the valence bands of the H$^h_h$ stacking, due to the opposite
orientation of $S_z$ and $L_z$ in the individual monolayers. For the low-energy
dipolar excitons (DEs), direct and indirect in $k$-space, we quantify the
electric dipole moments and polarizabilities, reflecting the layer
delocalization of the constituent bands. We found that direct DEs carry a
robust valley Zeeman effect nearly independent of the EF but tunable by the ID,
which can be experimentally accessible via applied external pressure. For the
momentum-indirect DEs, our symmetry analysis indicates that phonon-mediated
optical processes can easily take place. For the indirect DEs with conduction
bands at the Q point for H-type stackings, we found marked variations of the
valley Zeeman ($\sim 4$) as a function of the EF that notably stand out from
the other DE species. Stronger signatures of the coupled SVP are favored in
H-type stackings, which can be experimentally investigated in $\sim 60^0$
samples. Our study provides fundamental insights into the SVP of van der Waals
heterostructures, relevant to understand the valley Zeeman of DEs and
intralayer excitons.

Identifying topological phases via zero-bias conductance peaks in Majorana
wires is not trivial. Here we address this issue in realistic three-terminal
proximitized superconducting (disordered) nanowires coupled to normal leads,
purportedly capable of hosting (quasi-) zero-energy Majorana modes. By using
Green functions and the scattering matrix formalism, we calculate the
conductance matrix and the local density of states (LDOS) for asymmetrically
tunnel coupled left ($\Gamma_L$, constant) and right ($\Gamma_R$) leads. In the
trivial phase, we find that the local conductances are distinctively affected
by variations in $\Gamma_R$: while $G_{LL}$ is essentially constant, $G_{RR}$
is exponentially suppressed as $\Gamma_R$ diminishes. In the topological phase
(bulk criterion), surprisingly, $G_{LL}$ and $G_{RR}$ are suppressed in the
exact same way, i.e., $G_{LL}=G_{RR}$. This nonlocal suppression of $G_{LL}$
scales with the hybridization between the Majorana zero modes (MZMs) and arises
from the emergence of a dip in the LDOS around zero energy at the left end of
the wire, which in turn affects the MZM-mediated local Andreev reflections. We
also present a Majorana transistor exploiting the nonlocality of the local
Andreev processes and the gate-controlled suppression of the LDOS. Finally, we
propose a protocol for distinguishing trivial from topological zero-bias peaks
that rely only on local conductance measurements.

from the addition of a homogeneous size-dependent perturbation, decaying as an
inverse power of the system size. The scaling theory is first formulated in a
general framework and then illustrated using three concrete problems for which
exact results are obtained.

We discuss the possibility of defining an emergent local temperature in
extended quantum many-body systems evolving out of equilibrium. For the most
simple case of free-fermionic systems, we give an explicit formula for the
effective temperature in the case of, not necessarily unitary, Gaussian
preserving dynamics. In this framework, we consider the hopping fermions on a
one-dimensional lattice submitted to randomly distributed projective
measurements of the local occupation numbers. We show from the average over
many quantum trajectories that the effective temperature relaxes exponentially
towards infinity.

<h3>Hidden direct exchange and alternative description of magnetic  interactions in two-dimensional Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01888" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01888</a>
<br>
<i>Georgy V. Pushkarev, Danis I. Badrtdinov, Ilia A. Iakovlev, Vladimir V. Mazurenko, Alexander N. Rudenko</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose an alternative description of the magnetic properties in monolayer
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ based on the state-of-the-art first-principles calculations
combined with model simulations. We show that due to structural peculiarities
of the system, short distance between the neighboring iron atoms gives rise to
a strong direct exchange coupling. The direct exchange is important for an
accurate description of the magnon spectrum at high energies, but remains
insignificant for moderate-energy spin excitations, as well as for
thermodynamic averages. A strong coupling between the iron atoms allows us to
consider them as an effective cluster with a magnetic moment $\sim$5 $\mu_B$,
giving rise to a simplified spin model on a bipartite honeycomb lattice with
the reduced number of long-range interactions. The simplified model perfectly
reproduces the results of the conventional spin model, but allows for a more
tractable description of the magnetic properties of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, which is
important, e.g., for large-scale simulations. Also, we discuss the role of
biaxial strain in the stabilization of ferromagnetic ordering in
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$.

<br>
<i>A. L√≥pez, B. Monta√±es, E. Medina</i>
<br>
<br>
We analyze the scenario of modulating the potential strength of bound atoms
in an optical honeycomb lattice patterned by an electric field to emulate
uniaxial strain. This modulation can be achieved by a combination of the
strength of the patterned electric field and gauge vector effects using the
Floquet approach. We show that such a modulation allows one to follow through a
topological transition between a semi-metal and a band insulator, when two
non-equivalent $K$ points merge as a function of the electric field strength.
We explicitly compute the wavefunctions for the moving $K$ points and the Chern
numbers up to the transition. Anisotropic effective masses and the insulating
gap are described close to the semimetal-insulator transition.

<br>
<br>
The heavy-fermion metal CeCu$_2$Si$_2$ was the first discovered
unconventional, non-phonon-mediated superconductor, and for a long time was
believed to exhibit single-band $d$-wave superconductivity, as inferred from
various measurements hinting at a nodal gap structure. More recently however,
measurements using a range of techniques at very low temperatures ($T
\lessapprox 0.1$ K) provided evidence for a fully-gapped superconducting order
parameter. In this Colloquium, after a brief historical overview we survey the
apparently conflicting results of numerous experimental studies on this
compound. We then address the different theoretical scenarios which have been
applied to understand the particular gap structure, including both isotropic
(sign-preserving) and anisotropic two-band $s$-wave superconductivity, as well
as an effective two-band $d$-wave model, where the latter can explain the
currently available experimental data on CeCu$_2$Si$_2$. The lessons from
CeCu$_2$Si$_2$ are expected to help uncover the Cooper-pair states in other
unconventional, fully-gapped superconductors with strongly correlated carriers,
and in particular highlight the rich variety of such states enabled by orbital
degrees of freedom.

<h3>Superconducting Diode Effect Sign Change in Epitaxial Al-InAs Josepshon  Junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01902" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01902</a>
<br>
<i>Neda Lotfizadeh, Barƒ±≈ü Pekerten, Peng Yu, William Strickland, Alex Matos-Abiague, Javad Shabani</i>
<br>
<br>
There has recently been a surge of interest in studying the superconducting
diode effect (SDE) analogous to semiconducting circuits where the junction
shows nonreciprocal response depending on the current direction. The SDE could
be observed in systems where the time reversal and inversion symmetries are
broken. Here, we observe the SDE in epitaxial Al-InAs Josephson junctions (JJs)
with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and show that this effect
strongly depends on the orientation of the in-plane magnetic field. In the
presence of strong magnetic field, we observe a change of sign in the SDE.
Simulation and measurement of supercurrent suggest that depending on the
superconducting widths, $W_S$, this sign change may not necessarily be related
to $0-\pi$ or topological transitions. We find the strongest sign change in
junctions with narrow $W_S$ is consistent with SOC-induced asymmetry of the
critical current under magnetic-field inversion, while in wider $W_S$, the sign
reversal could be related to $0-\pi$ transitions and topological
superconductivity

<h3>The highly nonperturbative nature of the Mott metal-insulator  transition: Two-particle vertex divergences in the coexistence region</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01914" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01914</a>
<br>
<i>Mathias Pelz, Severino Adler, Matthias Reitner, Alessandro Toschi</i>
<br>
<br>
We thoroughly analyze the divergences of the irreducible vertex functions
occurring in the charge channel of the half-filled Hubbard model in close
proximity to the Mott metal-insulator transition (MIT). In particular, by
systematically performing dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations on
the two-particle level, we determine the location and the number of the vertex
divergences across the whole coexistence region adjacent to the first-order
metal-to-insulator transition. We find that the lines in the parameter space,
along which the vertex divergences occur, display a qualitatively different
shape in the coexisting metallic and insulating phase, which is also associated
to an abrupt jump of the number of divergences across the MIT. Physically, the
systematically larger number of divergences on the insulating side of the
transition reflects the sudden suppression of local charge fluctuation at the
MIT. Further, a systematic analysis of the results demonstrates that the number
of divergence lines increases as a function of the inverse temperature
${\beta\!=\!(k_\mathrm{B} T)^{-1}}$ by approaching the Mott transition in the
zero temperature limit. This makes it possible to identify the zero-temperature
MIT as an accumulation point of an infinite number of vertex divergence lines,
unveiling the highly nonperturbative nature of the underlying transition.

<h3>Medium-induced Interaction Between Impurities in a Bose-Einstein  Condensate</h3>

<br>
<i>Moritz Drescher, Manfred Salmhofer, Tilman Enss</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider two heavy particles immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate in
three dimensions and compute their mutual interaction induced by excitations of
the medium. For an ideal Bose gas, the induced interaction is Newtonian up to a
shift in distance which depends on the coupling strength between impurities and
Bosons. For a real BEC, we find that on short distances, the induced potential
is dominated by three-body physics of a single Boson bound to the impurities,
leading to an Efimov potential. At large distances of the order of the healing
length, a Yukawa potential emerges instead. In particular, we find that both
regimes are realized for all impurity-boson couplings and determine the
corresponding crossover scales. The transition from the real to the ideal
condensate at low gas parameters is investigated.

<br>
<br>
The study concerns dynamics of standing spin waves in arrays of sub-100 nm
elliptic synthetic-antiferromagnet (SAF) nanodisks. We performed a detailed
ferromagnetic resonance analysis in conjunction with micromagnetic modeling to
find out several prominent traits of such systems. One broad line is shown to
be the sole resonant response for a SAF of the considered sizes. We demonstrate
that this mode is degenerated, and its excitation map resembles a superposition
of in-center and edge-type oscillations. We also show how this hybrid
excitation leads to almost twofold enhancement in the shape-induced anisotropy
of the mode.

<h3>Impact of the $p$-cubic Dresselhaus term on the spin Hall effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01941" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01941</a>
<br>
<i>E. Santana-Su√°rez, F. Mireles</i>
<br>
<br>
It is well known that the Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in
semiconductor two dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) possesses both linear and
cubic in momentum contributions. Nevertheless, the latter is usually neglected
in most theoretical studies. However, recent Kerr rotation experiments have
revealed a significant enhancement of the cubic Dresselhaus interaction by
increasing the drift velocities in 2DEGs hosted in GaAs quantum wells. Here, we
present a study of the optical spin Hall conductivity in 2DEGs under the
simultaneous presence of Rashba and (linear plus cubic) Dresselhaus SOC. The
work was done within the Kubo formalism in linear response. We show that the
coexistence of the Rashba and cubic Dresselhaus SOC in 2DEGs promotes a strong
anisotropy of the band spin splitting which in turn leads to a very
characteristic frequency dependence of the spin Hall conductivity. We find that
the spin Hall conductivity response could be very sensible to sizeable
cubic-Dresselhaus coupling strength. This may be of relevance for the optical
control of spin currents in 2DEGs with non-negligible cubic-Dresselhaus SOC.

<h3>Interplay of Kekul√© distortions and laser fields in graphene</h3>

<br>
<i>A. L√≥pez, F. Mireles</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the interplay between a Kekul\'e patterned distortion in monolayer
graphene and a monochromatic laser irradiation, focusing in the long wavelength
approximation of its Landau level structure. Exploiting the symmetries of the
system, we calculate in the static regime an exact analytical solution for the
energy spectrum and its eigenstates, which in turn allows us to find close
expressions for the polarizations in the valley and pseudospin degrees of
freedom. We find that due to the valley-momentum coupling, the valley
polarization exhibits a distinct magnetic response for the two $K$-valley
components. Owing to that, the introduction of the radiation field mixes the
Landau levels, and it is shown that by tuning the system to resonance leads to
a larger valley-polarization response as compared to the non-resonant scenario.

<h3>An Abelian Higgs model for disclinations in nematics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01955" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01955</a>
<br>
<i>A. de P√°dua Santos, F. Moraes, F. A. N. Santos, S. Fumeron</i>
<br>
<br>
Topological defects in elastic media may be described by a geometric field
akin to three-dimensional gravity. From this point of view, disclinations are
line defects of zero width corresponding to a singularity of the curvature in
an otherwise flat background. On the other hand, in two dimensions, the Frank
free energy of a nematic liquid crystal may be interpreted as an Abelian Higgs
Lagrangian. In this work, we construct an Abelian Higgs model coupled to
"gravity" for the nematic phase, with the perspective of finding more realistic
disclinations. That is, a cylindrically symmetric line defect of finite radius,
invariant under translations along its axis. Numerical analysis of the
equations of motion indeed yield a $+1$ winding number "thick" disclination.
The defect is described jointly by the gauge and the Higgs fields, that compose
the director field, and the background geometry. Away from the defect, the
geometry is conical, associated to a dihedral deficit angle. The gauge field,
confined to the defect, gives a structure to the disclination while the Higgs
field, outside, represents the nematic order.

<h3>Light-induced coherent interlayer transport in stripe-ordered ${\rm  La}_{1.6-x}{\rm Nd}_{0.4}{\rm Sr}_{x}{\rm CuO}_{4}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01961" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01961</a>
<br>
<i>Morihiko Nishida, Kota Katsumi, Dongjoon Song, Hiroshi Eisaki, Ryo Shimano</i>
<br>
<br>
We have investigated the photoexcited transient responses of stripe-ordered
phase in a cuprate superconductor, ${\rm La}_{1.6-x}{\rm Nd}_{0.4}{\rm
Sr}_{x}{\rm CuO}_{4}~(x = 0.12)$ using optical-pump terahertz (THz)-probe
spectroscopy. Upon the near-infrared photoexcitation with the electric field
polarized along the $c$-axis, a clear plasma edge appears in the THz reflection
spectrum along the $c$-axis with its position nearly coinciding with the
Josephson plasma resonance of similarly doped ${\rm La}_{2-x}{\rm Sr}_{x}{\rm
CuO}_{4}~(x = 0.125)$ in the low-temperature superconducting phase. The
appearance of light-induced plasma edge sustains up to the onset temperature of
the charge-stripe order, indicating the inherent interplay between the
light-induced phase and the charge-stripe order. The optical conductivity
spectrum of the light-induced state is mostly reproduced by the Drude model
with a scattering rate as small as a few meV, and its imaginary part does not
exhibit $1/{\omega}$-divergence behavior in any temporal region after the
photoexcitation. We discuss the possible origin of the observed coherent
interlayer transport behavior as manifested by the narrow Drude response in the
THz reflectivity along the $c$-axis.

<br>
<br>
We show that a band complex can in principle has no finite upper bound for
certain space groups. It means infinitely many bands can entangle together,
forming a connected pattern stable against symmetry-preserving perturbations.
This is demonstrated by our developed inductive construction procedure, through
which a given band complex can always be grown into a larger one by gluing a
basic building block to it. As a by-product, we demonstrate the existence of
arbitrarily large accordion type band structure containing $N_C=4n$ bands, with
$n\in\mathbb{N}$.

We consider the three-dimensional site-diluted Ising model with power-law
correlated defects and study the critical behavior of the second-moment
correlation length and the magnetic susceptibility in the high-temperature
phase. By comparing, for various defect correlation strengths, the extracted
critical exponents $\nu$ and $\gamma$ with the results of our previous
finite-size scaling study, we consolidate the exponent estimates.

<br>
<i>Zheng-Wei Zuo, Linxi Lv, Dawei Kang</i>
<br>
<br>
A general strategy of alternated slide construction to craft the topological
metals is proposed, where there is a relative slide between the odd and even
chains in the trivial spinless quantum wire array. Firstly, taken the three-leg
ladder as an example, we find that alternated slide can induce a topological
phase transition from the normal metal to topological metal phases, which are
protected by the inversion symmetry. Remarkably, a new kind of topological
metal without nontrivial edge states is found and the bulk-boundary
correspondence breaks down. Secondly, the two dimensional (2D) quantum wires
array with alternated slide manifest similar physical behaviors. Two types of
topological metal phases emerge, where there are gapless bulk bands with and
without nontrivial edge states. These results could be confirmed by current
experimental techniques.

<br>
<br>
How a system initially at infinite temperature responds when suddenly placed
at finite temperatures is a way to check the existence of phase transitions. It
has been shown in [R. da Silva, IJMPC 2023] that phase transitions are
imprinted in the spectra of matrices built from time evolutions of
magnetization of spin models. In this paper, we show that this method works
very accurately in determining the critical temperature in the mean-field Ising
model. We show that for Glauber or Metropolis dynamics, the average eigenvalue
has a minimum at the critical temperature, which is corroborated by an
inflection at eigenvalue dispersion at this same point. Such transition is
governed by a gap in the density of eigenvalues similar to short-range spin
systems. We conclude that the thermodynamics of this mean-field system can be
described by the fluctuations in the spectra of Wishart matrices which suggests
a direct relationship between thermodynamic fluctuations and spectral
fluctuations.

<br>
<i>Yoshifumi Nakata, Masaki Tezuka</i>
<br>
<br>
The key to understanding complex quantum systems is information scrambling
originally proposed in relation to the Hayden-Preskill recovery, which refers
to localized information being spread over the whole system and being
accessible from small subsystems. This phenomenon is well-understood in random
unitary models but hardly addressed in Hamiltonian systems. In this Letter, we
investigate the information recovery for various time-independent Hamiltonians,
including Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models and chaotic spin chains. Despite the
fact that the Hayden-Preskill recovery typically relies on the assumption never
satisfied in Hamiltonian systems, we show that information recovery is possible
in certain, but not all, chaotic models. This highlights the information
recovery as an operational probe for the manifestation of novel complex quantum
dynamics.

<h3>A spatially resolved optical method to measure thermal diffusivity</h3>

<br>
<br>
We describe an optical method to directly measure position-dependent thermal
diffusivity of reflective single crystal samples across a broad range of
temperatures for condensed matter physics research. Two laser beams are used,
one as a source to locally modulate the sample temperature, and the other as a
probe of sample reflectivity, which is a function of the modulated temperature.
Thermal diffusivity is obtained from the phase delay between source and probe
signals. We combine this technique with a microscope setup in an optical
cryostat, in which the sample is placed on a 3-axis piezo-stage, allowing for
spatially resolved measurements. Furthermore, we demonstrate experimentally and
mathematically that isotropic in-plane diffusivity can be obtained when
overlapping the two laser beams instead of separating them in the traditional
way, which further enhances the spatial resolution to a micron scale,
especially valuable when studying inhomogeneous or multidomain samples. We
discuss in detail the experimental conditions under which this technique is
valuable, and demonstrate its performance on two stoichiometric bilayer
ruthenates: Sr3Ru2O7 and Ca3Ru2O7. The spatial resolution allowed us to study
the diffusivity in single domains of the latter, and we uncovered a
temperature-dependent in-plane diffusivity anisotropy. Finally, we used the
enhanced spatial resolution enabled by overlapping the two beams to measure
temperature-dependent diffusivity of Ti-doped Ca3Ru2O7, which exhibits a
metal-insulator transition. We observed large variations of transition
temperature over the same sample, originating from doping inhomogeneity, and
pointing to the power of spatially resolved techniques in accessing inherent
properties.

<h3>Topologically invisible defects in chiral mirror lattices</h3>

<br>
<br>
One of the hallmark of topological insulators is having conductivity
properties that are unaffected by the possible presence of defects. So far, for
classical waves in time reversal invariant systems, all attempts to obtain
topological modes have not displayed strict immunity to backscattering. Here,
we obtain exact perfect transmission across defects or disorder using a
combination of chiral and mirror symmetry. To demonstrate the principle, we
focus on a simple hexagonal lattice model with Kekule distortion displaying
topological edge waves and we show analytically and numerically that the
transmission across symmetry preserving defects is unity. Importantly, not only
the transmission is perfect, but no phase shift is induced making the defect
invisible. Our results rely on a generic lattice model, applicable to various
classical wave systems, which we realize to a high accuracy in an acoustic
system, and confirm the perfect transmission with numerical experiments. Our
work opens the door to new types of topological metamaterials exploiting
distinct symmetries to achieve robustness against defects or disorder. We
foresee that the versatility of our model will trigger new experiments to
observe topological perfect transmission and invisibility in various wave
systems, such as photonics, cold atoms or elastic waves.

LaCrGe$_3$ is an itinerant, metallic ferromagnet with a Curie temperature
($T_C$) of $\sim$ 86 K. Whereas LaCrGe$_3$ has been studied extensively as a
function of pressure as an example of avoided ferromagnetic quantum
criticality, questions about its ambient pressure ordered state remain;
specifically, whether there is a change in the nature of the ferromagnetically
ordered state below $T_C$ $\sim$ 86 K. We present anisotropic $M$($H$)
isotherms, coupled with anisotropic AC susceptibility data, and demonstrate
that LaCrGe$_3$ has a remarkable, low temperature coercivity associated with
exceptionally sharp, complete magnetization reversals to and from fully
polarized states. This coercivity is temperature dependent, it drops to zero in
the 40 - 55 K region and reappears in the 70 - 85 K regions. At low
temperatures LaCrGe$_3$ has magnetization loops and behavior that has
previously associated with micromagnetic/nanocrystalline materials, not bulk,
macroscopic samples.

<i>Siddhartha Sarkar, Xiaoming Mao, Kai Sun</i>
<br>
<br>
Maxwell lattices, where the number of degrees of freedom equals the number of
constraints, are known to host topologically-protected zero-frequency modes and
states of self stress, characterized by a topological index called topological
polarization. In this letter, we show that in addition to these known
topological modes, with the help of a mirror symmetry, the inherent chiral
symmetry of Maxwell lattices creates another topological index, the
mirror-graded winding number (MGWN). This MGWN is a higher order topological
index, which gives rise to topological zero modes and states of self stress at
mirror-invariant domain walls and corners between two systems with different
MGWNs. We further show that two systems with same topological polarization can
have different MGWNs, indicating that these two topological indices are
fundamentally distinct.

Recent experiments have created supersolids of dipolar quantum droplets. The
resulting crystals lack, however, a genuine cohesive energy and are maintained
by the presence of an external confinement, bearing a resemblance to the case
of ion Coulomb crystals. We show that a mixture of two antiparallel dipolar
condensates allows for the creation of potentially large, self-bound crystals
which, resembling ionic crystals in solid-state physics, are maintained by the
mutual dipolar attraction between the components, with no need of transversal
confinement. This opens intriguing novel possibilities, including
three-dimensionally self-bound droplet-ring structures, stripe/labyrinthic
patterns, and self-bound crystals of droplets surrounded by an interstitial
superfluid, resembling the case of superfluid Helium in porous media.

We propose a simple two-step approximation for the radial distribution
function of a one-component two-dimensional Yukawa fluid. This approximation is
specified by the key parameters of the system: coupling parameter and screening
parameter. On the basis of this approximation, analytical expressions are
obtained for the same thermodynamic quantities as internal energy, internal
pressure, excess entropy in the two-particle approximation, and also
longitudinal sound velocity. The theoretical results show an agreement with the
results obtained in the case of a true radial distribution function.

We investigated the thermal transport properties of two $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$
crystals with different degrees of stacking disorder to understand the origin
of the previously reported oscillatory feature in the field dependence of
thermal conductivity. Crystal I shows only one magnetic order around 13\,K,
which is near the highest T$_N$ for $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ with stacking faults.
Crystal II has less stacking disorder, with a dominant heat capacity at 7.6\,K
along with weak anomalies at 10\,K and 13\,K. In the temperature and field
dependence of thermal conductivity, no obvious anomaly was observed to be
associated with the magnetic order around 13\,K for either crystal or around
10\,K for crystal II. Crystal II, with less disorder, showed clear oscillations
in the field dependence of thermal conductivity, while crystal I, with more
disorder, did not. For crystal I, an L-shaped region in the temperature-field
space was observed where thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$/T is within
$\pm$20\% of the half quantized thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{HQ}$/T.
While for crystal II, $\kappa_{xy}$/T reaches $\kappa_{HQ}$/T only in the high
field and high temperature regime with no indication of a plateau at
$\kappa_{HQ}$/T. Our thermal conductivity data suggest the oscillatory features
are inherent to the zig-zag ordered phase with T$_N$ near 7\,K. Our planar
thermal Hall effect measurements highlight the sensitivity of this phenomena to
stacking disorder. Overall, our results highlight the importance of
understanding and controlling crystallographic disorder for obtaining and
interpreting intrinsic thermal transport properties in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.

We lay down the {\em ab initio} many-body quantum theory of electrons and
phonons in- and out-of-equilibrium at any temperature. We begin by addressing a
fundamental issue concerning the {\em ab initio} Hamiltonian in the harmonic
approximation, which we show must be determined {\em self-consistently} to
avoid inconsistencies. After identifying the most suitable partitioning into a
``noninteracting'' and an ``interacting'' part we embark on the Green's
function diagrammatic analysis. We single out key diagrammatic structures to
carry on the expansion in terms of dressed propagators and screened
interaction. The final outcome is the finite-temperature nonequilibrium
extension of the Hedin equations, featuring the appearance of the time-local
Ehrenfest diagram in the electronic self-energy. The Hedin equations have
limited practical utility for real-time simulations of driven systems. We
leverage the versatility of diagrammatic expansion to generate a closed system
of integro-differential equations for the Green's functions and nuclear
displacements. These are the Kadanoff-Baym equations for electrons and phonons.
Another advantage of the diagrammatic derivation is the ability to use
conserving approximations, which ensure the satisfaction of all fundamental
conservation laws during the time evolution. As an example we show that the
adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation is not conserving whereas its
dynamical extension is conserving provided that the electrons are treated in
the Fan-Migdal approximation with a dynamically screened electron-phonon
coupling. We also derive the formal solution of the Kadanoff-Baym equations in
the long time limit and at the steady state. The expansion of the phononic
Green's function around the quasi-phonon energies points to a possible
correlation-induced splitting of the phonon dispersion in materials with no
time-reversal invariance.

Magnetic skyrmions are promising for next-generation information storage and
processing owing to their potential advantages in data storage density,
robustness, and energy efficiency. The magnetic multilayers consisting of Pt,
Co, and a third metal element $X$ provide an ideal platform to study the
skyrmions due to their highly tunable magnetic properties. Here, we report the
material parameters needed to achieve room-temperature skyrmions in epitaxial
Pt/Co/Cu superlattices grown by molecular beam epitaxy. By tuning the Co
thickness and the number of periods, the magnetic easy axis varies from
perpendicular to in-plane, and skrymions are observed in the spin-reorientation
transition. The magnetic properties of the Pt/Co/Cu samples are studied by
magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) and superconducting quantum interference
device (SQUID) magnetometer measurements. Skyrmions are directly imaged by
magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy
(LTEM). The development of room-temperature skyrmions in Pt/Co/Cu multilayers
may lead to advances in skyrmion-related research and applications.

<h3>Dispersed, condensed and self-limiting states of geometrically  frustrated assembly</h3>

In self-assembling systems, geometric frustration leads to complex states
characterized by internal gradients of shape misfit. Frustrated assemblies have
drawn recent interest due to the unique possibility that their thermodynamics
can sense and select the finite size of assembly at length scales much larger
than constituent building blocks or their interactions. At present,
self-limitation is chiefly understood to derive from zero-temperature
considerations, specifically the competition between cohesion and
scale-dependent elastic costs of frustration. While effects of entropy and
finite temperature fluctuations are necessarily significant for self-assembling
systems, their impact on the self-limiting states of frustrated assemblies is
not known. We introduce a generic, minimal model of frustrated assembly, and
establish its finite-temperature and concentration dependent thermodynamics by
way of simulation and continuum theory. The phase diagram is marked by three
distinct states of translation order: a dispersed vapor; a defect-riddled
condensate; and the self-limiting aggregate state. We show that, at finite
temperature, the self-limiting state is stable at intermediate frustration.
Further, in contrast to the prevailing picture, its thermodynamic boundaries
with the macroscopic disperse and bulk states are temperature controlled,
pointing to the essential importance of translational and conformational
entropy in their formation.

<h3>Fubini-Study metric as a tool to classify the topological properties of  flat band electronic states: the case of an atomic chain with $s-p$ orbitals</h3>

The topological properties of flat band states of a one-electron Hamiltonian
describing a chain of atoms with $s-p$ orbitals are explored. This model is
mapped onto a Kitaev-Creutz type model providing a useful framework to
understand the topology through a non-trivial winding number and the geometry
introduced by the \textit{Fubini-Study (FS)} metric. This metric allows us to
distinguish between pure states of systems with the same topology and thus
provides a suitable tool to obtain the fingerprint of flat bands. Moreover it
provides an appealing geometrical picture to describe flat bands, as it can be
associated with a local conformal transformation over circles in a complex
plane. In addition the presented model allows to relate the topology with the
formation of Compact Localized States (CLS) and Bogoliubov-like modes. The
presented model is equivalent to two interacting SSH chains under a change of
basis and thus provides the most simple generalization of the SSH model able to
present flat bands. Expermimentally, the proposed system can be realized with
boron, gallium and tellurium.

<h3>Entanglement Entropy of Large-N Theories</h3>

A large class of strongly correlated quantum systems can be described in
certain large-N limits by quadratic in field actions along with
self-consistency equations that determine the two-point functions. We use the
replica approach and the notion of shifted Matsubara frequency to compute von
Neumann and R\'enyi entanglement entropies for generic bi-partitioning of such
systems. Remarkably, the von Neumann entropy can be computed from equilibrium
spectral functions w/o partitioning, while the R\'enyi entropy requires
re-calculating the spectrum in the interacting case. We demonstrate the
flexibility of the method by applying it to examples of a two-site problem in
presence of decoherence, and various coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models.

<h3>Modulated Floquet parametric driving and non-equilibrium crystalline  electron states</h3>

We propose a method to parametrically excite low frequency collective modes
in an interacting many body system using an amplitude modulated Floquet drive
at optical frequencies. We illustrate this method on the example of terahertz
plasmons in a two dimensional electronic system. In the presence of a
sufficiently strong drive, plasmons resonant with the modulation frequency
become unstable and arrange themselves in a crystal-like structure stabilized
by interactions and nonlinearities. The new state breaks the discrete time
translational symmetry of the drive as well as the translational and rotational
spatial symmetries of the system and exhibits soft, Goldstone-like phononic
excitations.

<h3>Theory of the low- and high-field superconducting phases of UTe$_2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Recent nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and calorimetric experiments have
observed that UTe$_2$ exhibits a transition between two distinct
superconducting phases as a function of magnetic field strength for a field
applied along the crystalline $b$-axis. To determine the nature of these
phases, we employ a microscopic two-band minimal Hamiltonian with the essential
crystal symmetries and structural details. We also adopt a local, ferromagnetic
interaction term. We study the resulting pairing symmetries and properties of
these low- and high-field phases in mean field theory.
