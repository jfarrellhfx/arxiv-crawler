<h3>Solvable models of two-level systems coupled to itinerant electrons:  Robust non-Fermi liquid and quantum critical pairing</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06532" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06532</a>

</p><i>Evyatar Tulipman, Noga Bashan, Jörg Schmalian, Erez Berg</i>
<p>Strange metal behavior is traditionally associated with an underlying
putative quantum critical point at zero temperature. However, in many
correlated metals, e.g., high-Tc cuprate superconductors, strange metallicity
persists at low temperatures over an extended range of microscopic parameters,
suggesting the existence of an underlying quantum critical phase, whose
possible physical origins remain poorly understood. Systematic investigations
of physical scenarios giving rise to such a critical, non-Fermi liquid (NFL)
phase are therefore crucial to better understand this puzzling behavior. In a
previous work [Bashan et al. arXiv:2310.07768], we considered a solvable
large-N model consisting of itinerant electrons coupled to local two-level
systems (TLSs) via spatially random interactions, inspired by the possibility
of emergent metallic glassiness due to frustrated competing orders, and found
that the system hosts an NFL phase with tunable exponents at intermediate
couplings. In this work, we expand our investigation to the following: (i) We
study the extent to which this NFL phase is generic by considering various
deformations of our theory, including coupling of electrons to multiple
operators of the TLSs and arbitrarily directed TLS-fields. We find that the
physical picture obtained in Bashan et al. qualitatively persist in a wide
region of parameter space, showcasing the robustness of the NFL phase; (ii) We
analyze the superconducting instability due to coupling of TLSs to electrons,
and find a rich structure, including quantum critical pairing associated with
the NFL phase and conventional BCS pairing in the weak and strong coupling
limits; (iii) We elaborate on the analysis of Bashan et al., including
single-particle, transport and thermodynamic properties.

<h3>Exact Floquet flat band and heating suppression via two-rate drive  protocols</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06536" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06536</a>
<br>
</p><i>Tista Banerjee, Sayan Choudhury, K. Sengupta</i>
<p>We demonstrate the existence of exact Floquet flat bands implying strong
violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in a large class of
closed quantum many-body systems in the presence of a two-rate drive
characterized by frequencies $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2=\nu \Omega_1$. We provide
the exact analytic condition for this phenomenon to occur for a generic
protocol; in particular, $\nu=(2p+1)$, where $p$ is an integer, leads to such
flat bands for both square-pulse and cosine drive protocols for arbitrary
$\Omega_1$. In the vicinity of these points, heating is suppressed up to very
long timescales in such driven systems, leading to a prethermal regime; we
demonstrate this by exact numerical studies of distribution and bandwidth of
the Floquet eigenstates, spectral form factor, entanglement entropy, and
correlation functions of an experimentally realizable finite driven Rydberg
chain. The corresponding micromotion exhibits coherent reversal of excitation
reminiscent of echoes. Our analysis constitutes a yet unexplored mechanism for
heating suppression in driven closed quantum systems.

<h3>Robustness of topological magnons in disordered arrays of skyrmions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06541" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06541</a>
<br>
</p><i>H. Diego Rosales, Roberto E. Troncoso</i>
<p>The effects of disorder on the robustness of topological magnon states of
two-dimensional ferromagnetic skyrmions is investigated. It is diagnosed by
evaluating a real space topological invariant, the bosonic Bott index (BI). The
disorder simultaneously breaks the axially symmetric shape and the crystalline
ordering of the skyrmions array. The corresponding magnonic fluctuations and
band spectrum are determined in terms of magnetic field and strength of
disorder. We observe the closing of the existing band gaps as the individual
skyrmions start to occupy random positions. The analysis reveals that
topological states (TSs) persist beyond the perturbative limit when skyrmions
reach the glassy phase. In addition, the localization of topologically
protected edge states is weakened by the disordered skyrmion structure with
increasing localization length. Our findings shed light on the physical
understanding of the coexistence of disordered magnetic textures and their
topological spin fluctuations.

<h3>Chiral two-dimensional MoS2 by molecular functionalization as  ultra-sensitive detectors for circularly polarized light</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06555" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06555</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ye Wang, Yiru Zhu, Han Yan, Yang Li, Yan Wang, Manish Chhowalla</i>
<p>Inducing chirality in optically and electronically active materials is
interesting for applications in sensing and quantum information transmission.
Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) possess excellent
electronic and optical properties but are achiral. Here we demonstrate
chirality induction in atomically thin layers of 2D MoS2 by functionalization
with chiral thiol molecules. Analysis of X-ray absorption near-edge structure
and Raman optical activity with circularly polarized excitation suggest
chemical and electronic interactions that leads chirality transfer from the
molecules to the MoS2. We confirm chirality induction in 2D MoS2 with circular
dichroism measurements that show absorption bands at wavelengths of 380-520 nm
and 520-600 nm with giant molar ellipticity of 10^8 deg cm2/dmol 2-3 orders of
magnitude higher than 3D chiral materials. Phototransistors fabricated from
atomically thin chiral MoS2 for detection of circularly polarized light exhibit
responsivity of >10^2 A/W and maximum anisotropy g-factor of 1.98 close to the
theoretical maximum of 2.0, which indicates that the chiral states of photons
are fully distinguishable by the photodetectors. Our results demonstrate that
it is possible achieve chirality induction in monolayer MoS2 by molecular
functionalization and realise ultra-sensitive detectors for circularly
polarized photons.

<h3>Subgap states in semiconductor-superconductor devices for quantum  technologies: Andreev qubits and minimal Majorana chains</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06592" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06592</a>
<br>
</p><i>Rubén Seoane Souto, Ramón Aguado</i>
<p>In recent years, experimental advances have made it possible to achieve an
unprecedented degree of control over the properties of subgap bound states in
hybrid nanoscale superconducting structures. This research has been driven by
the promise of engineering subgap states for quantum applications, which
includes Majorana zero modes predicted to appear at the interface of
superconductor and other materials, like topological insulators or
semiconductors. In this chapter, we revise the status of the field towards the
engineering of quantum devices in controllable semiconductor-superconductor
heterostructures. We begin the chapter with a brief introduction about subgap
states, focusing on their mathematical formulation. After introducing
topological superconductivity using the Kitaev model, we discuss the advances
in the search for Majorana states over the last few years, highlighting the
difficulties of unambiguously distinguish these states from nontopological
subgap states. In recent years, the precise engineering of bound states by a
bottom-up approach using quantum dots has led to unprecedented experimental
advances, including experimental demonstrations of an Andreev qubits based on a
quantum dot Josephson junction and a minimal Kitaev chain based on two quantum
dots coherently coupled by the bound states of an intermediate superconducting
segment. These experimental advances have revitalized the field and helped to
understand that, far from being a disadvantage, the presence of subgap bound
states can be exploited for new qubit designs and quantum coherence
experiments, including Majorana-based qubits.

<h3>Sensing quantum vacuum fluctuations with non-Gaussian electronic noise</h3>

</p><i>Clovis Farley, Edouard Pinsolle, Bertrand Reulet</i>
<p>The statistics of electron transport in a tunnel junction is affected by
fluctuations of its voltage bias, which modulates the probability for electrons
to cross the junction. We exploit this phenomenon to provide a direct
measurement of quantum vacuum fluctuations in the microwave domain of a
resistor placed at ultra-low temperature: we show that the amplified vacuum
fluctuations are correlated with the noise generated by the junction to
contribute to a third moment of detected voltage fluctuations. This experiment
constitutes an absolute measurement of noise, not affected by the unavoidable
noise added by the detection setup.

<h3>Physics of acceptors in GaN: Koopmans tuned HSE hybrid functional  calculations and experiment</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06603" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06603</a>
<br>
</p><i>Denis O. Demchenko, Mykhailo Vorobiov, Oleksandr Andrieiev, Mikhail A. Reshchikov, Benjamin MvEwen, Fatemeh Shahedipour-Sandvik</i>
<p>The Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional has become a widely used
tool for theoretical calculations of point defects in semiconductors. It
generally offers a satisfactory qualitative description of defect properties,
including the donor/acceptor nature of defects, lowest energy charge states,
thermodynamic and optical transition levels, Franck-Condon shifts,
photoluminescence (PL) band shapes, and carrier capture cross sections.
However, there are noticeable quantitative discrepancies in these properties
when compared to experimental results. Some of these discrepancies arise from
the presence of self-interaction in various parametrizations of the HSE. Other
errors are due to the use of the periodic boundary conditions. In this study,
we demonstrate that the error corrections scheme based on extrapolation to the
dilute limit effectively eliminates the errors due to artificial electrostatic
interactions of periodic images and interactions due to the defect state
delocalization. This yields parametrizations of HSE that satisfy the
generalized Koopmans' condition, essentially eliminating self-interaction from
defect state orbitals. We apply this HSE Koopmans tuning individually to a
range of cation site acceptors in GaN (Be\textsubscript{Ga},
Mg\textsubscript{Ga}, Zn\textsubscript{Ga}, Ca\textsubscript{Ga},
Cd\textsubscript{Ga}, and Hg\textsubscript{Ga}) and compare the HSE results
with experimental data from PL spectra. The Koopmans-compliant HSE calculations
show a significantly improved quantitative agreement with the experiment.

<h3>Inertial active matter with Coulomb friction</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06615" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06615</a>
<br>
</p><i>Alexander P. Antonov, Lorenzo Caprini, Christian Scholz, Hartmut Löwen</i>
<p>Friction is central to the motion of active (self-propelled) objects, such as
bacteria, animals or robots. While in a viscous fluid friction is typically
described by Stokes' law, objects in contact with other solid bodies are often
governed by more complex empirical friction laws. We study active dry particles
subject to dry Coulomb friction force numerically and analytically. The
interplay of friction and activity forces induces a rich behavior resulting in
three distinct dynamical regimes. While for low activity levels, active
Brownian motion is recovered, for large activity we observe a dynamical Stop &
Go regime continuously switching from diffusion and accelerated motion. For
further activity values, we observe a super-mobile dynamical regime
characterized by a fully accelerated motion which is described by an anomalous
scaling of the diffusion coefficient with the activity. These findings cannot
be observed with Stokes viscous forces typical of active swimmers but are
central in dry active objects.

<h3>Quantum graph models for transport in filamentary switching</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06628" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06628</a>
<br>
</p><i>Alison A. Silva, Fabiano M. Andrade, Francesco Caravelli</i>
<p>The formation of metallic nanofilaments bridging two electrodes across an
insulator is a mechanism for resistive switching. Examples of such phenomena
include atomic synapses, which constitute a distinct class of memristive
devices whose behavior is closely tied to the properties of the filament. Until
recently, experimental investigation of the low-temperature regime and quantum
transport effects has been limited. However, with growing interest in
understanding the true impacts of the filament on device conductance,
comprehending quantum effects has become crucial for quantum neuromorphic
hardware. We discuss quantum transport resulting from filamentary switching in
a narrow region where the continuous approximation of the contact is not valid,
and only a few atoms are involved. In this scenario, the filament can be
represented by a graph depicting the adjacency of atoms and the overlap between
atomic orbitals. Using quantum graphs, we calculate the scattering amplitude of
charge carriers on this graph and explore the interplay between filamentary
formation and quantum transport effects.

<h3>SAM-I-Am: Semantic Boosting for Zero-shot Atomic-Scale Electron  Micrograph Segmentation</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06638" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06638</a>
<br>
</p><i>Waqwoya Abebe, Jan Strube, Luanzheng Guo, Nathan R. Tallent, Oceane Bel, Steven Spurgeon, Christina Doty, Ali Jannesari</i>
<p>Image segmentation is a critical enabler for tasks ranging from medical
diagnostics to autonomous driving. However, the correct segmentation semantics
- where are boundaries located? what segments are logically similar? - change
depending on the domain, such that state-of-the-art foundation models can
generate meaningless and incorrect results. Moreover, in certain domains,
fine-tuning and retraining techniques are infeasible: obtaining labels is
costly and time-consuming; domain images (micrographs) can be exponentially
diverse; and data sharing (for third-party retraining) is restricted. To enable
rapid adaptation of the best segmentation technology, we propose the concept of
semantic boosting: given a zero-shot foundation model, guide its segmentation
and adjust results to match domain expectations. We apply semantic boosting to
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to obtain microstructure segmentation for
transmission electron microscopy. Our booster, SAM-I-Am, extracts geometric and
textural features of various intermediate masks to perform mask removal and
mask merging operations. We demonstrate a zero-shot performance increase of
(absolute) +21.35%, +12.6%, +5.27% in mean IoU, and a -9.91%, -18.42%, -4.06%
drop in mean false positive masks across images of three difficulty classes
over vanilla SAM (ViT-L).

<h3>Slow relaxation of quasi-periodically driven integrable quantum  many-body systems</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06667" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06667</a>
<br>
</p><i>Souradeep Ghosh, Sourav Bhattacharjee, Souvik Bandyopadhyay</i>
<p>We study the emergence and stability of a prethermal phase in an integrable
many-body system subjected to a Fibonacci drive. Despite not being periodic,
Fibonacci drives have been shown to introduce dynamical constraints due to
their self-similar structure, unlike random driving protocols. From
perturbative analysis, this has been argued to result in an exponentially long
prethermal phase in the high frequency limit of driving. Examining higher order
terms in the perturbative expansion, we show that the perturbative description
breaks down eventually in such systems at a finite universal order, which
depends solely on features of the Fibonacci sequence. This leads to an onset of
energy absorption at long time scales for intermediate and low driving
frequencies. Interestingly, in spite of the breakdown of an effective
Hamiltonian in the perturbative analysis, we still observe slow logarithmic
heating time-scales, unlike purely random drives.

<h3>Noise-Tolerance of Majorana Teleportation in Mesoscopic Topological  Superconductors</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06677" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06677</a>
<br>
</p><i>Tsukasa Goto, Masayuki Sugeta, Takeshi Mizushima, Satoshi Fujimoto</i>
<p>We investigate teleportation interference associated with the non-local
character of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) as a probe of MZMs focusing on the
tolerance of teleportation against disturbances, such as inhomogeneous
potentials at junctions and disorder. We develop a method for calculating
non-local conductance in mesoscopic topological superconductors with fixed
parity. In the trivial phase, the non-local conductance exhibits the
$h/2e$-periodicity, while in the topological phase with fixed parity, it
exhibits the $h/e$-periodicity, indicative of Majorana teleportation. We find
that the $h/e$-periodicity is stable against changes in inhomogeneous potential
structures and disorder. These results imply that MZMs can cause teleportation
interference even in the presence of disturbances, leading to a clear
distinction between the trivial and topological phases.

<h3>Many-defect solutions in planar nematics: interactions, spiral textures  and boundary conditions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06678" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06678</a>
<br>
</p><i>Simon Čopar, Žiga Kos</i>
<p>From incompressible flows to electrostatics, harmonic functions can provide
solutions to many two-dimensional problems and, similarly, the director field
of a planar nematic can be determined using complex analysis. We derive a
closed-form solution for a quasi-steady state director field induced by an
arbitrarily large set of point defects and circular inclusions with or without
fixed rotational degrees of freedom, and compute the forces and torques acting
on each defect or inclusion. We show that a complete solution must include two
types of singularities, generating a defect winding number and its spiral
texture, which have a direct effect on defect equilibrium textures and their
dynamics. The solution accounts for discrete degeneracy of topologically
distinct free energy minima which can be obtained by defect braiding. The
derived formalism can be readily applied to equilibrium and slowly evolving
nematic textures for active or passive fluids with multiple defects present
within the orientational order.

<h3>On activation in solid ionic electrolytes</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06707" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06707</a>
<br>
</p><i>Keian Noori, Ben A. Olsen, Aleksandr Rodin</i>
<p>Ionic conductivity in solid electrolytes is commonly expected to exhibit
Arrhenius dependence on temperature, determined by a well-defined activation
energy. Consequently, a standard approach involves calculating this energy
using quasi-static methods and using the Arrhenius form to extrapolate the
numerical results from one temperature range to another. Despite the ubiquity
of this Arrhenius-based modeling, disagreements frequently arise between theory
and experiment, and even between different theoretical studies. By considering
a tractable minimal model, we elucidate the reason behind the breakdown of the
Arrhenius conductivity form. This breakdown is driven by non-trivial
phase-space boundaries between conducting and non-conducting regimes, and
depends on the kinetic properties of the system.

<h3>Best-in-class modeling: A novel strategy to discover constitutive models  for soft matter systems</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06725" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06725</a>
<br>
</p><i>Kevin Linka, Ellen Kuhl</i>
<p>The ability to automatically discover interpretable mathematical models from
data could forever change how we model soft matter systems. For convex
discovery problems with a unique global minimum, model discovery is
well-established. It uses a classical top-down approach that first calculates a
dense parameter vector, and then sparsifies the vector by gradually removing
terms. For non-convex discovery problems with multiple local minima, this
strategy is infeasible since the initial parameter vector is generally
non-unique. Here we propose a novel bottom-up approach that starts with a
sparse single-term vector, and then densifies the vector by systematically
adding terms. Along the way, we discover models of gradually increasing
complexity, a strategy that we call best-in-class modeling. To identify
successful candidate terms, we reverse-engineer a library of sixteen functional
building blocks that integrate a century of knowledge in material modeling with
recent trends in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Yet, instead of
solving the discrete combinatorial problem with 65,536 possible combinations of
terms, best-in-class modeling starts with the best one-term model and
iteratively repeats adding terms, until the objective function meets a
user-defined convergence criterion. Strikingly, we achieve good convergence
with only one or two terms. We illustrate the best-in-class one- and two-term
models for a variety of soft matter systems including rubber, brain, artificial
meat, skin, and arteries. Our discovered models display distinct and unexpected
features for each family of materials, and suggest that best-in-class modeling
is an efficient, robust, and easy-to-use strategy to discover the mechanical
signatures of traditional and unconventional soft materials. We anticipate that
our technology will generalize naturally to other classes of natural and
man-made soft matter.

<h3>CryinGAN: Design and evaluation of point-cloud-based generative  adversarial networks using disordered materials $-$ application to  Li$_3$ScCl$_6$-LiCoO$_2$ battery interfaces</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06734" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06734</a>
<br>
</p><i>Adrian Xiao Bin Yong, Elif Ertekin</i>
<p>Generative models have received significant attention in recent years for
materials science applications, particularly in the area of inverse design for
materials discovery. While current efforts have mainly focused on bulk
materials with relatively small unit cells, the possibility of generative
models for more complex, disordered materials would significantly extent the
current capabilities of generative modeling. Generative models would also
benefit from better ways to assess their performance. They are typically
evaluated on the new, unverified materials being generated, which give limited
metrics for evaluation. In this work, we design and evaluate models intended
for disordered interface structure generation. Using a disordered
Li$_3$ScCl$_6$-LiCoO$_2$ battery interface, we tested different
point-cloud-based generative adversarial network architectures that further
include bond distance information in the discriminator, rather than only atomic
coordinates. By working with a fixed material system, we evaluated the model
performance through direct comparisons between training and generated
structures. The best performing architecture, Crystal Interface Generative
Adversarial Network (CryinGAN), uses two separate 1D convolutional
discriminators, one that accepts coordinates and another that accepts bond
distances as input. We demonstrate that CryinGAN is able to successfully
generate low-interface-energy structures for systems with > 250 atoms, in which
the generated interfaces are structurally similar to the training structures.
This study highlights the capabilities of a relatively simple generative model
in generating large disordered materials, and discusses the limitations of the
point cloud representation. Insights are provided to help guide the development
of future generative models that are useful to not just disordered, but also
ordered materials.

<h3>The Physics of Antimicrobial Activity of Ionic Liquids</h3>

<p>The bactericidal potency of ionic liquids (ILs) is well-established, yet
their precise mechanism of action remains elusive. Here, we show evidence that
the bactericidal action of ILs primarily involves permeabilizing the bacterial
cell membrane. Our findings reveal that ILs exert their effects by directly
interacting with the lipid bilayer and enhancing the membrane dynamics. Lateral
lipid diffusion is accelerated which in turn augments membrane permeability,
ultimately leading to bacterial death. Furthermore, our results establish a
significant connection: an increase in the alkyl chain length of ILs correlates
with a notable enhancement in both lipid lateral diffusion and antimicrobial
potency. This underscores a compelling correlation between membrane dynamics
and antimicrobial effectiveness, providing valuable insights for the rational
design and optimization of IL-based antimicrobial agents in healthcare
applications.

<h3>Direct transition from a fractional quantum anomalous Hall state to a  smectic state with the same Hall conductance</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06745" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06745</a>
<br>
</p><i>Hongyu Lu, Han-Qing Wu, Bin-Bin Chen, Zi Yang Meng</i>
<p>The recent developments in twisted MoTe_2 and rhombohedral multilayer
graphene have generated widespread attention to the general features of
fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states, including their possible
coexistence with and transition to various symmetry breaking charge ordered
states. These attentions are pushing forward our knowledge of the relation
between the topological order in FQAH states and the Landau-type of symmetry
breaking order such as the 1D smectic electronic liquid crystal and 2D
charge-density-wave (CDW) solid. Although the transitions from topological
states to symmetry breaking states with trivial topology have been discussed,
the road from one topological ordered state to another with the same Hall
conductance coexisting with Landau order has not been found. Here we show the
intriguing evidence that the FQAH to FQAH Smectic (FQAHS) transition is
robustly realizable in the archetypal correlated flat Chern-band model at
filling {\nu} = 2/3. This transition is novel in that: i) the FQAHS acquires
the same fractional Hall conductance as FQAH, which cannot be explained by
mean-field band folding. The formation of smectic order can be viewed as
perturbation around the transition point, and thus, do not destroy or change
the original topology; ii) the charge excitation remains gapped across the
transition although the neutral gap is closed at transition point; and iii) the
transition is triggered by the softening of roton mode with the same wave
vector as the smectic order. Our discovery opens countless new possibilities,
both theoretical and experimental, in the fast-growing field of robust
fractional Chern insulators.

<h3>Quantum spin state stabilized by coupling with classical spins</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Hironori Yamaguchi, Tsuyoshi Okubo, Akira Matsuo, Takashi Kawakami, Yoshiki Iwasaki, Taiki Takahashi, Yuko Hosokoshi, Koichi Kindo</i>
<p>We introduce a model compound featuring a spin-1/2 frustrated square lattice
partially coupled by spin-5/2. A significant magnetization plateau exceeding 60
T could be observed, indicating a quantum state formed by $S$ = 1/2 spins in
the square lattice. The remaining $S$ = 5/2 spins exhibited paramagnetic
behavior in the low-field regions. The numerical analysis confirmed that the
observed quantum state is a many-body entangled state based on the dominant AF
interactions and is strongly stabilized by coupling with spin-5/2. The
stabilization of this quantum state can be attributed to a compensation effect
similar to magnetic field-induced superconductivity, which serves as a strategy
to control the stability of quantum spin states in magnetic fields.

</p><i>Hajime Ishikawa, Yuto Ishii, Takeshi Yajima, Yasuhiro H. Matsuda, Koichi Kindo, Yusei Shimizu, Ioannis Rousochatzakis, Ulrich K. Rößler, Oleg Janson</i>
<p>We study the magnetism of a layered, spin-$\frac12$ organic-inorganic copper
sulfate, which is a close realization of the star lattice antiferromagnet, one
of the playgrounds of geometric frustration and resonating valence bond physics
in two spatial dimensions. Our thermodynamic measurements show no ordering down
to 0.1 K and a characteristic field-induced entropic shift, revealing the
presence of an infinite number of competing states down to very low energy
scales. The response to external magnetic fields shows, in addition, a peculiar
anisotropy, reflected in the formation of a 1/3 magnetization plateau (stable
up to full saturation around 105 T) and a paramagnetic, Curie-like
susceptibility for one direction of the field (${\bf H}\parallel{\bf c}$), and
a completely different response in other field directions. Our first-principles
density functional theory calculations and exact diagonalizations show that
these experimental puzzles are distinctive signatures of a strong interplay
between geometric frustration and sizable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions,
and the emergence of a continuous U(1) symmetry at low energy scales.

<p>Chemical interface damping is a change in the effective collision frequency
of conduction band electrons in metal originating from a chemical change of the
metal interface. In this work, we present in-situ ellipsometric measurements
that reveal the chemical interface damping effect from electrochemical
oxidation of single crystal and polycrystalline gold films. We observe an
increase in collision frequency of up to 21 meV for single-crystalline gold. To
compare to results obtained with thiols and metal-oxides on gold nanoparticles,
we normalize the collision frequency by the electron mean free path to the
surface of the structure. We show that electrochemical gold oxidation provides
a stronger effect on collision frequency than these coatings. Similar
ellipsometric experiments have previously been conducted to investigate the
optical properties of gold oxide, but without taking chemical interface damping
into account. The change in reflection from oxidation of gold was solely
attributed to the oxide coating. We also show that the chemical interface
damping effect saturates at a larger effective oxide thickness, which is
attributed to the stabilization of the gold-oxide interface.

<p>With the help of one-dimensional random Potts-like model we study the origins
of fine structure observed on differential melting profiles of double-stranded
DNA. We assess the effects of sequence arrangement on DNA melting curves
through the comparison of results for random, correlated, and block sequences.
Our results re-confirm the smearing out the fine structure with the increase of
chain length for all types of sequence arrangements and suggest fine structure
to be a finite-size effect. We have found, that the fine structure in chains
comprised of blocks with the correlation in sequence is more persistent,
probably, because of increased sequence disorder the blocks introduce. Many
natural DNAs show a well-expressed fine structure of melting profiles. In view
of our results it might mean the existence of blocks in such DNAs. The very
observation of fine structure may also mean, that there exists an optimal
length for natural DNAs \emph{in vivo}.

<h3>Control of proton transport and hydrogenation in double-gated graphene</h3>

<p>Graphene's basal plane can function as a perfectly selective barrier
permeable to protons but impermeable to all ions and gases, stimulating its use
in applications such as membranes, catalysis and isotope separation. Protons
can also chemically adsorb on graphene and hydrogenate it, inducing a
conductor-insulator transition intensely explored in graphene electronic
devices. However, both processes face energy barriers that in the case of
proton transport motivate strategies to accelerate it, such as introducing
vacancies, incorporating catalytic metals or chemically functionalising the
lattice, but these can compromise other properties like ion selectivity or
mechanical stability. Here we show that independent control of the electric
field E~V nm-1 and charge carrier density n~10^14 cm-2 in double gated graphene
allows decoupling proton transport from lattice hydrogenation and can
accelerate proton transport such that it approaches the limiting electrolyte
current in our devices. Proton transport and hydrogenation can be driven
selectively with precision and robustness that enables proton-based
logic-and-memory graphene devices with orders-of-magnitude on-off ratios. Our
results show that field effects can accelerate and decouple electrochemical
processes in double-gated 2D crystals and demonstrate the possibility of
mapping such processes as a function of E and n - a fundamentally different
technique to study 2D electrode-electrolyte interfaces.

<p>Laser metal additive manufacturing technology is capable of producing
components with complex geometries and compositions that cannot be realized by
conventional manufacturing methods. However, a large number of pores generated
during the additive manufacturing process greatly affect the mechanical
properties of the additively manufactured parts, and the mechanism of such pore
generation has not been revealed by direct observation clearly. Here, we report
the mechanism of pore generation in the laser direct energy deposition process
as revealed by {\it in-situ} high-speed high-resolution synchrotron X-ray
imaging. We found that dissolution and re-precipitation of external gases and
precipitation of metal vapors are the two main mechanisms of pore formation. We
further explored the effects of different process parameters on the generation
of pores and optimized the process to suppress pore generation. This work
provides important insights into the formation of porosity defects during laser
metal additive manufacturing, and can provide guidance for related process
optimization.

<h3>Field-induced Peierls phase in $S=1$ Heisenberg spins coupled to quantum  phonons</h3>

</p><i>Shifeng Cui, Wenan Guo, G. G. Batrouni, Pinaki Sengupta</i>
<p>Spin-Peierls transition occurs in a one-dimensional $S=1$ Heisenberg
antiferromagnetic model with single-ion anisotropy, coupled to finite frequency
bond phonons, in a magnetic field. Our results indicate that for the pure
Heisenberg model, any Peierls transition is suppressed by quantum fluctuations
of the phonon field. However, a novel magnetic field-induced Spin-Peierls phase
is realized in the presence of strong single-ion anisotropy. Contrary to the
standard Peierls state, the periodicity of bond strength modulation in this
field-induced Spin-Peierls state is variable and depends on the strength of the
applied field. The nature of the ground state in this new phase and the
associated field-driven transitions to and out of this phase are explored using
extensive numerical simulations. In particular, we explore the spin and bond
correlations and the evolution of bond order modulation with varying magnetic
field.

<h3>Size-induced Exchange Bias in Single-phase CoO Nanoparticles</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Vikash Sharma, Sudip Pal, Divya Sharma, Dinesh Kumar Shukla, Ram Janay Chaudhary, Gunadhor Singh Okram</i>
<p>We report EB in single-phase CoO nanoparticles, where two magnetic phases
naturally emerge as the crystallite size decreases from 34.6 to 10.8 nm. The
N\'eel temperature (TN) associated with antiferromagnetic ordering decreases
monotonically with the reduction in crystallite size, highlighting the
significant influence of size effects. The 34.6 nm nanoparticles exhibit
magnetization irreversibility between zero field cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled
(FC) states below TN. This irreversibility appears well above TN with further
reduction in size, resulting in the absence of true paramagnetic regime which
indicates the occurrence of an additional magnetic phase. The
frequency-dependent ac-susceptibility in 10.8 nm nanoparticles suggests slow
dynamics of disordered surface spins above TN, coinciding with the
establishment of long-range order in the core. The thermoremanent magnetization
(TRM) and isothermoremanent magnetization (IRM) curves suggest a core-shell
structure: the core is antiferromagnetic, and the shell consists of disordered
surface spins causing ferromagnetic interaction. Hence, the exchange bias in
these CoO nanoparticles results from the exchange coupling between an
antiferromagnetic core and a disordered shell that exhibits unconventional
surface spin characteristics.

<p>Recent experiments have established negative energetic elasticity, the
negative contribution of energy to the elastic modulus, as a universal property
of polymer gels. To reveal the microscopic origin of this phenomenon, Shirai
and Sakumichi investigated a polymer model on a cubic lattice with the energy
effect from the solvent in finite-size calculations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130,
148101 (2023)]. Motivated by this work, we provide a simple platform to study
the elasticity of polymer chains by considering a one-dimensional random walk
with the energy effect. This model can be mapped onto the classical Ising
chain, leading to an exact form of the free energy in the thermodynamic or
continuous limit. Our analytical results are qualitatively consistent with
Shirai and Sakumichi's work. Our model serves as a fundamental benchmark for
studying negative energetic elasticity.

<p>The topological states of the two-leg and three-leg ladders formed by two
trivial quantum wires with different lattice constants are theoretically
investigated. For the symmetric nearest-neighbor intra-chain hopping two-leg
ladder, the inversion symmetry topological insulator phase with two degenerate
topological edge states appears. When the inversion symmetry is broken, the
topological insulators with one or two topological edge states of different
energies and topological metals with edge states embedded in the bulk states
could emerge dependent on the filling factor. The topological origin of these
topological states in the two-leg ladders is the topological properties of the
Chern insulators and Chern metals. According to the arrangement of two trivial
quantum wires, we construct two types of three-leg ladders. Each type of the
three-leg ladder could be divided into one trivial subspace and one topological
nontrivial subspace by unitary transformation. The topological nontrivial
subspace corresponds to the effective two-leg ladder model. As the filling
factor changes, the system could be in topological insulators or topological
metals phases. These rich topological states in the two-leg and three-leg
ladders could be confirmed by current experimental techniques.

<p>Graphdiyne-based carbon systems generate intriguing layered sp-sp$^2$
organometallic lattices, characterized by flexible acetylenic groups connecting
planar carbon units through metal centers. At their thinnest limit, they can
result in two-dimensional (2D) organometallic networks exhibiting unique
quantum properties and even confining the surface states of the substrate,
which is of great importance for fundamental studies. In this work, we present
the on-surface synthesis of a highly crystalline 2D organometallic network
grown on Ag(111). The electronic structure of this mixed honeycomb-kagome
arrangement - investigated by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and
scanning tunneling spectroscopy - reveals a strong electronic conjugation
within the network, leading to the formation of two intense electronic
band-manifolds. In comparison to theoretical density functional theory
calculations, we observe that these bands exhibit a well-defined orbital
character that can be associated with distinct regions of the sp-sp$^2$
monomers. Moreover, we find that the halogen by-products resulting from the
network formation locally affect the pore-confined states, causing a
significant energy shift. This work contributes to the understanding of the
growth and electronic structure of graphdiyne-like 2D networks, providing
insights into the development of novel carbon materials beyond graphene with
tailored properties.

<h3>The effects of V doping on the intrinsic properties of SmFe10Co2 alloys:  a theoretical investigation</h3>

<p>The present study focuses on the intrinsic properties of the SmFe10Co2-xVx (x
= 0-2) alloys, which includes the SmFe10Co2 alloy, one of the most promising
permanent magnets with the ThMn12 type of structure due to its large saturation
magnetization (1.78 T), high Curie temperature (Tc = 859 K), and anisotropy
field (12 T) experimentally obtained. Unfortunately, its low coercivity (<0.4
T) hinders its use in permanent magnet applications. The effect of V-doping on
magnetization, magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, and Curie temperature is
investigated by electronic band structure calculations. The spin-polarized
fully relativistic Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (SPR-KKR) band structure method,
which employs the coherent potential approximation (CPA) to deal with
substitutional disorder, has been used. The Hubbard-U correction to local spin
density approximation (LSDA +U) was used to account for the large correlation
effects due to the 4f electronic states of Sm. The computed magnetic moments
and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies were compared with existing
experimental data to validate the theoretical approach's reliability. The
exchange-coupling parameters from the Heisenberg model were used for obtaining
the mean-field estimated Curie temperature. The magnetic anisotropy energy was
separated into contributions from transition metals and Sm, and its
relationships with the local environment, interatomic distances, and valence
electron delocalization were analyzed. The suitability of the hypothetical
SmFe10CoV alloy for permanent magnet manufacture was assessed using the
calculated anisotropy field, magnetic hardness, and intrinsic magnetic
properties.

In this study, we created networks of PbTe nanowires arranged in loop

oscillations in supercurrent upon the scanning of a magnetic field. Most of the
oscillations can be fitted assuming a sinusoidal current-phase relation for
each Josephson junction. Under certain conditions, the oscillations are found
to be skewed, suggesting possible deviation from a sinusoidal behavior. Our
results highlight the potential of PbTe nanowires for building complex quantum
devices in the form of networks.

comprised of ZnO nanoparticles/Ag nanowires. A multi-interface engineering
strategy assisted by organic polymers and molecules is explored to
synergistically improve the film deposition, passivate the surface defects and
facilitate the charge transfer. These efforts help us achieve high-performance
and robust Kesterite solar cells at extremely low time and energy costs, with
efficiency records of 14.37% and 13.12% being realized in rigid and flexible
Kesterite solar cells, respectively. Our strategy here is also promising to be
transplanted into other solar cells with similar geometric and energy band

electrodes exhibiting a large dielectric breakdown field of > 1E9 V/m. The
advantage of overlapping gates over the split gate approach is confirmed in

</p><i>Federico Corberi, Salvatore dello Russo</i>
<p>We study the ordering kinetics of a generalization of the voter model with
long-range interactions, the $p$-voter model, in one dimension. It is defined
in terms of boolean variables $S_{i}$, agents or spins, located on sites $i$ of
a lattice, each of which takes in an elementary move the state of the majority
of $p$ other agents at distances $r$ chosen with probability $P(r)\propto
r^{-\alpha}$. For $p=2$ the model can be exactly mapped onto the case with
$p=1$, which amounts to the voter model with long-range interactions decaying
algebraically. For $3\le p<\infty$, instead, the dynamics falls into the
universality class of the one-dimensional Ising model with long-ranged coupling
constant $J(r)=P(r)$ quenched to small finite temperatures. In the limit $p\to
\infty$, a crossover to the (different) behavior of the long-range Ising model
quenched to zero temperature is observed.

and the two successive magnetic transitions at zero field with two-stage

magnetic field in the intermediate temperature phase. Multiple field-induced
phases are observed before full saturation at around 40 T. We argue the unique

connected component of Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs, with average connectivity
$p$ and randomly distributed hopping amplitudes. By solving the self-consistent
cavity equations satisfied by the matrix elements of the resolvent, we compute
the probability distribution of the local density of states, which governs the
scaling with the system size of the moments of the eigenvectors' amplitudes, as
well as several other observables related to the spectral statistics. For small
values of $p>1$ above the percolation threshold, we unveil the presence of an
exotic delocalized but (weakly) multifractal phase in a broad region of the
parameter space, which separates the localized phase found for $p\le1$ from the
fully-delocalized GOE-like phase expected for $p\to \infty$. We explore the
fundamental physical mechanism underlying the emergence of delocalized
multifractal states, rooted in the pronounced heterogeneity in the topology of
the graph. This heterogeneity arises from the interplay between strong
fluctuations in local degrees and hopping amplitudes, and leads to an effective
fragmentation of the graph. We further support our findings by characterizing
the level statistics and the two-point spatial correlations within the
multifractal phase, and address the ensuing anomalous transport and relaxation
properties affecting the quantum dynamical evolution.

polarization transfer from the electron spin to the nuclei require the
knowledge of the electron-nuclear interaction parameters, we have used
high-frequency (94 GHz) electron-nuclear double resonance spectroscopy combined
with first-principles density functional theory to investigate the hyperfine
and nuclear quadrupole interactions of the basal and axial NV centers. We
observed that the four inequivalent NV configurations (hk, kh, hh, and kk)
exhibit different electron-nuclear interaction parameters, suggesting that each
NV center may act as a separate optically addressable qubit. Finally, we
rationalized the observed differences in terms of distinctions in the local

<p>Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are promising candidates to improve the thermal
conductivity of nano-composites. The main obstacle to these applications is the
extremely high thermal boundary (Kapitza) resistance between the CNTs and their
matrix. In this theoretical work our goal is to maximize the heat flux through
the CNT by functionalizing the CNT ends. We use a Landauer approach to
calculate and optimize the energy flux from a soft to a hard material in one
dimension through a connecting continuous medium of varying elasticity and
density. The transmission probability of phonons through the system is
calculated both numerically and analytically. We find that over 90% of the
maximum heat flux into CNT is possible for 1nm length of the intermediate
material at room temperature (300K).

to be varied, we note limitations from finite size effects, and conclude that
quantum dots and quantum gases offer complementary views on transport through

<p>We present a phenomenological model for magnetoelectricity in multiferroic
materials. The distinctive feature of the model is a two-component complex
order parameter that encodes the electric polarization, along with a direct
coupling between the polarization and magnetic field. Our model effectively
elucidates that a sufficiently strong magnetic field can destroy electric
polarization. Furthermore, the transition field strength diminishes with rising
temperature, following a power-law relation with the exponent being precisely
worked out. At lower field strength, the electric polarization takes a spiral
order in the magnetic field, with the spiral wavelength inversely proportional
to the magnetic field strength. We anticipate these predictions can be
experimentally tested in future studies on multiferroic materials.

<p>Diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS) colloidal nanocrystals demonstrate
remarkable magneto-optical properties. However, the behavior of circular
polarization of their emission in high magnetic fields remains unclear. We
measure magneto-optical properties of colloidal CdSe/CdMnS nanoplatelets in
high magnetic fields up to 30 T and at cryogenic temperatures. The degree of
circular polarization of photoluminescence demonstrates non-monotonous behavior
in a magnetic field. In low magnetic fields, the polarization degree is
positive, due to an exchange interaction of excitons with localized spins of
magnetic Mn ions. The exchange interaction is strong enough to overcome the
intrinsic Zeeman splitting, which provides negatively polarized emission in
nonmagnetic CdSe/CdS nanoplatelets. After reaching a maximum the polarization
degree starts to decrease and reverses the sign to negative in high magnetic
fields. The critical magnetic field, in which the sign is reversed, increases
when temperature is elevated. We develop a model, which explains this behavior
by an interplay of bright and dark exciton recombination.

field is minimally coupled with a ${\mathbb
Z}_2$-gauge link variables. These models are invariant under global O($N$)
and local ${\mathbb Z}_2$ transformations. They present three phases
characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the global O($N$) symmetry and by
the different topological properties of the ${\mathbb
Z}_2$-gauge correlations. We address the nature of the three transition lines
separating the three phases. The theoretical predictions are supported by
numerical finite-size scaling analyses of Monte Carlo data for the $N=2$ model.
In this case, continuous transitions can be observed along both transition
lines where the spins order, in the regime of small and large inverse gauge
coupling $K$. Even though these continuous transitions belong to the same $XY$
universality class, their critical modes turn out to be different. When the
gauge variables are disordered (small $K$), the relevant order-parameter field
is a gauge-invariant bilinear combination of the vector field. On the other
hand, when the gauge variables are ordered (large $K$), the order-parameter
field is the gauge-dependent $N$-vector field, whose critical behavior can only
be probed by using a stochastic gauge fixing that reduces the gauge freedom.

<p>We investigate the addition of applied stress to a random block matrix model
introduced by Parisi to study the Hessian matrix of soft spheres near the
jamming point. In the infinite dimensional limit the applied stress translates
the spectral distribution to the left, leading to a stability constraint. With
negative stress, as in the case of a random network of stretched elastic
springs, the spectral distribution is translated to the right, and the density
of states has a peak before the plateau.

<p>We investigate the effect of polydispersity on the properties of curved
linear brushes in good solvent. To this end, we extend the strong stretching
theory for polydisperse brushes to curved geometries and investigate the
polymer chain end profiles, bending moduli and other properties for
experimentally relevant polymer chain length distributions of the Schulz-Zimm
type. We also investigate the properties of End Exclusion Zones (EEZ) that may
appear in convex geometries under certain conditions, and show that their
position in the brush can be engineered by careful selection of the polymer
length distribution. Lastly, we propose a method to engineer chain end profiles
by engineering the polymer length distribution.

<p>Atomic arrangements and local sub-structures fundamentally influence emergent
material functionalities. The local structures are conventionally probed using
spatially resolved studies and the property correlations are usually deciphered
by a researcher based on sequential explorations and auxiliary information,
thus limiting the throughput efficiency. Here we demonstrate a Bayesian deep
learning based framework that automatically correlates material structure with
its electronic properties using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
measurements in real-time. Its predictions are used to autonomously direct
exploration toward regions of the sample that optimize a given material
property. This autonomous method is deployed on the low-temperature ultra-high
vacuum STM to understand the structure-property relationship in a
europium-based semimetal, EuZn2As2, one of the promising candidates for
studying the magnetism-driven topological properties. The framework employs a
sparse sampling approach to efficiently construct the scalar-property space
using a minimal number of measurements, about 1 - 10 % of the data required in
standard hyperspectral imaging methods. We further demonstrate a
target-property-guided active learning of structures within a multiscale
framework. This is implemented across length scales in a hierarchical fashion
for the autonomous discovery of structural origins for an observed material
property. This framework offers the choice to select and derive a suitable
scalar property from the spectroscopic data to steer exploration across the
sample space. Our findings reveal correlations of the electronic properties
unique to surface terminations, local defect density, and point defects.

<p>The possibility of using axial spin color centers with $S=3/2$, oriented
along the hexagonal $c$ axis in a silicon carbide (SiC) wafer, has been
demonstrated for all-optical measurement of projection of the external magnetic
field coinciding with the $c$ axis of the crystal, and the polar and azimuthal
angles of the external measured magnetic field at room and significantly higher
temperatures. A distinctive feature of spin centers in SiC, in which optically
induced spin alignment is carried out, is the presence of a unique system of
spin levels in a magnetic field, caused by fine structure interaction and
hyperfine interaction with the $^{29}$Si nuclei and there is a wide range of
level anticrossings (LACs), leading to an exceptionally strong change in
photoluminescence in the region of LAC and the dependence of the LAC spectrum
on the orientation of the external measured magnetic field, which made it
possible to develop the all-optical vector magnetometry method. Such
measurements do not require microwave radiation, it is possible to use single
spin center for the all-optical vector magnetometry. The proposed magnetometer
is based on an external magnetic field cancellation scheme, which leads to a
LAC spectrum observed in a zero external magnetic field, called its reference
spectrum, by maintaining a local region of zero magnetic field at the site of
optical excitation of spin centers. 4H-SiC plate is placed on the scanning
stage of a confocal microscope inside the Helmholtz coils. Sensitivity to a
constant magnetic field for $z$ component of the magnetic field ${B}_{z}$ is
better than $0.1\mu$T$/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ in a volume of
$1\times10^{-8}$mm$^{3}$ at room temperature. The sensitivity of determining
the angles polar and azimuthal is determined by the sensitivity to determining
the perpendicular component of the magnetic field, which is better than
$5~\mu$T$/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$.

<h3>Probing phase transitions with correlations in configuration space: a  Monte Carlo study on lattice models</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07087" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07087</a>
<br>
</p><i>Wen-Yu Su, Yu-Jing Liu, Nvsen Ma, Chen Cheng</i>
<p>While phases and phase transitions are mostly characterized by order
parameters or physical quantities in real space, we propose that the
correlation in Hilbert space is closely connected to phase transitions.
Specifically, this correlation is quantified by the 1-norm distance between
configurations, and the distribution of distances can be obtained from a small
fraction of configurations in the exponentially large Hilbert space, with the
help of importance sampling procedures of the Monte Carlo method. Considering
the obtained distances as a data set, its distribution varies substantially in
different phases, and the numerical results further suggest a universal
critical behavior for the uncertainty and participation entropy extracted from
it. For various classical spin models with different types of phases and phase
transitions, the finite-size analysis based on these quantities successfully
catches the phase transitions with accurate critical points. Moreover, in all
cases for different systems and phase transitions, the critical exponent from
the uncertainty of the distances is found to numerically equal the anomalous
dimension that determines the decay of the correlation in real space. This
implies a deeper connection between the correlation in the real space and
configuration space, which deserves further investigation. In our proposal, the
definition of distance covers various lattice models with different local
degrees of freedom, e.g., two levels for Ising-like models, discrete
multi-levels for $q$-state clock models, and continuous local levels for the
$XY$ model, and the way handling the distances is very simple and robust. Our
proposal provides an alternative way of understanding the complex phases and
phase transitions in complicated systems where the order parameter is hard to
compute or define.

<h3>Particle Scattering and Fusion for the Ablowitz-Ladik Chain</h3>

<p>The Ablowitz-Ladik chain is an integrable discretized version of the
nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation. We report on a novel underlying Hamiltonian
particle system with properties similar to the ones known for the classical
Toda chain and Calogero fluid with $1/\sinh^2$ pair interaction. Boundary
conditions are imposed such that, both in the distant past and future,
particles have a constant velocity. We establish the many-particle scattering
for the Ablowitz-Ladik chain and obtain properties known for generic integrable
many-body systems. For a specific choice of the chain, real initial data remain
real in the course of time. Then, asymptotically, particles move in pairs with
a velocity-dependent size and scattering shifts are governed by the fusion
rule.

<h3>Open reaction-diffusion systems: bridging probabilistic theory across  scales</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Mauricio J. del Razo</i>
<p>Reaction-diffusion processes are the foundational model for a diverse range
of complex systems, ranging from biochemical reactions to social agent-based
phenomena. The underlying dynamics of these systems occur at the individual
particle/agent level, and in realistic applications, they often display
interaction with their environment through energy or material exchange with a
reservoir. This requires intricate mathematical considerations, especially in
the case of material exchange since the varying number of particles/agents
results in ``on-the-fly'' modification of the system dimension. In this work,
we first overview the probabilistic description of reaction-diffusion processes
at the particle level, which readily handles varying numbers of particles. We
then extend this model to consistently incorporate interactions with
macroscopic material reservoirs. Based on the resulting expressions, we bridge
the probabilistic description with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions
for linear and nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems, as well as for an
archetypal open reaction-diffusion system. This establishes a methodological
workflow to bridge particle-based probabilistic descriptions with macroscopic
concentration-based descriptions of reaction-diffusion in open settings, laying
the foundations for a multiscale theoretical framework upon which to construct
theory and simulation schemes that are consistent across scales.

<h3>Local probe of bulk and edge states in a fractional Chern insulator</h3>

<p>Fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is a prime example of topological
quantum many-body phenomena, arising from the interplay between strong electron
correlation, topological order, and time reversal symmetry breaking. Recently,
a lattice analog of FQHE at zero magnetic field has been observed, confirming
the existence of a zero-field fractional Chern insulator (FCI). Despite this,
the bulk-edge correspondence -- a hallmark of FCI featuring an insulating bulk
with conductive edges -- has not been directly observed. In fact, this
correspondence has not been visualized in any system for fractional states due
to experimental challenges. Here we report the imaging of FCI edge states in
twisted MoTe2 by employing a newly developed modality of microwave-impedance
microscopy. By tuning the carrier density, we observe the system evolving
between metallic and FCI states, the latter of which exhibits insulating bulk
and conductive edges as expected from bulk-boundary correspondence. We also
observe the evolution of edge states across the topological phase transition
from an incompressible Chern insulator state to a metal and finally to a
putative charge ordered insulating state as a function of interlayer electric
field. The local measurement further reveals tantalizing prospects of
neighboring domains with different fractional orders. These findings pave the
way for research into topologically protected 1D interfaces between various
anyonic states at zero magnetic field, such as topological entanglement
entropy, Halperin-Laughlin interfaces, and the creation of non-abelian anyons.

<h3>Pressure-tuned many-body phases through $Γ$-K valleytronics in  moiré bilayer WSe$_2$</h3>

</p><i>Marta Brzezińska, Sergii Grytsiuk, Malte Rösner, Marco Gibertini, Louk Rademaker</i>
<p>Recent experiments in twisted bilayer transition-metal dichalcogenides have
revealed a variety of strongly correlated phenomena. To theoretically explore
their origin, we combine here ab initio calculations with correlated model
approaches to describe and study many-body effects in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$
under pressure. We find that the interlayer distance is a key factor for the
electronic structure, as it tunes the relative energetic positions between the
K and the $\Gamma$ valleys of the valence band maximum of the untwisted
bilayer. As a result, applying uniaxial pressure to a twisted bilayer induces a
charge-transfer from the K valley to the flat bands in the $\Gamma$ valley.
Upon Wannierizing moir\'e bands from both valleys, we establish the relevant
tight-binding model parameters and calculate the effective interaction
strengths using the constrained random phase approximation. With this, we
approximate the interacting pressure-doping phase diagram of WSe$_2$ moir\'e
bilayers using self-consistent mean field theory. Our results establish twisted
bilayer WSe$_2$ as a platform that allows the direct pressure-tuning of
different correlated phases, ranging from Mott insulators,
charge-valley-transfer insulators to Kondo lattice-like systems.

<p>Monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently become the focus of
intense research as a material to host quantum emitters. Although it is well
known that such emission is associated with point defects, so far no conclusive
correlation between the spectra and specific defects has been demonstrated.
Here, we prepare atomically clean suspended hBN samples and subject them to
low-energy ion irradiation. The samples are characterized before and after
irradiation via automated scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging to
assess the defect concentrations and distributions. We find an intrinsic defect
concentration of ca. 0.03/nm2 (with ca. 55% boron and 8% nitrogen single
vacancies, 20% double vacancies and 16% more complex vacancy structures). To be
able to differentiate between these and irradiation-induced defects, we create
a significantly higher (but still moderate) concentration of defects with the
ions (0.30/nm2), and now find ca. 55% boron and 12% nitrogen single vacancies,
14% double vacancies, and 18% more complex vacancy structures. The results
demonstrate that already the simplest irradiation provides selectivity for the
defect types, and open the way for future experiments to explore changing the
selectivity by modifying the irradiation parameters.

<p>Despite the widespread applications of machine learning force field (MLFF) on
solids and small molecules, there is a notable gap in applying MLFF to complex
liquid electrolytes. In this work, we introduce BAMBOO (ByteDance AI Molecular
Simulation Booster), a novel framework for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,
with a demonstration of its capabilities in the context of liquid electrolytes
for lithium batteries. We design a physics-inspired graph equivariant
transformer architecture as the backbone of BAMBOO to learn from quantum
mechanical simulations. Additionally, we pioneer an ensemble knowledge
distillation approach and apply it on MLFFs to improve the stability of MD
simulations. Finally, we propose the density alignment algorithm to align
BAMBOO with experimental measurements. BAMBOO demonstrates state-of-the-art
accuracy in predicting key electrolyte properties such as density, viscosity,
and ionic conductivity across various solvents and salt combinations. Our
current model, trained on more than 15 chemical species, achieves the average
density error of 0.01 g/cm^3 on various compositions compared with experimental
data. Moreover, our model demonstrates transferability to molecules not
included in the quantum mechanical dataset. We envision this work as paving the
way to a ''universal MLFF'' capable of simulating properties of common organic
liquids.

<h3>Laser driven melt pool resonances through dynamically oscillating energy  inputs</h3>

<p>Spatially selective melting of metal materials by laser irradiation allows
for the precise welding as well as the 3D printing of complex metal parts.
However, the simple scanning of a conventional Gaussian beam typically results
in a melt track with randomly distributed surface features due to the complex
and dynamic behavior of the melt pool. In this study, the implications of
utilizing a dynamically oscillating energy input on driving melt track
fluctuations is investigated. Specifically, the laser intensity and/or
intensity distribution is sinusoidally modulated at different scan speeds, and
the effect of modulation frequency on the resulting surface features of the
melt track is examined. The formation of periodically oriented surface features
indicates an evident frequency coupling between the melt pool and the
modulation frequency. Moreover, such a frequency coupling becomes most
prominent under a specific modulation frequency, suggesting resonant behavior.
The insights provided in this study will enable the development of novel
methods, allowing for the control and/or mitigation of inherent fluctuations in
the melt pool through laser-driven resonances.
