<h3>Optimized Current Density Reconstruction from Widefield Quantum Diamond  Magnetic Field Maps</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17781" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17781</a>

</p><i>Siddhant Midha, Madhur Parashar, Anuj Bathla, David A. Broadway, Jean-Philippe Tetienne, Kasturi Saha</i>
<p>Quantum Diamond Microscopy using Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) defects in diamond
crystals has enabled the magnetic field imaging of a wide variety of nanoscale
current profiles. Intimately linked with the imaging process is the problem of
reconstructing the current density, which provides critical insight into the
structure under study. This manifests as a non-trivial inverse problem of
current reconstruction from noisy data, typically conducted via Fourier-based
approaches. Learning algorithms and Bayesian methods have been proposed as
novel alternatives for inference-based reconstructions. We study the
applicability of Fourier-based and Bayesian methods for reconstructing
two-dimensional current density maps from magnetic field images obtained from
NV imaging. We discuss extensive numerical simulations to elucidate the
performance of the reconstruction algorithms in various parameter regimes, and
further validate our analysis via performing reconstructions on experimental
data. Finally, we examine parameter regimes that favor specific reconstruction
algorithms and provide an empirical approach for selecting regularization in
Bayesian methods.

<h3>Geometrothermodynamic description of magnetic materials</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17782" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17782</a>
<br>
</p><i>Hernando Quevedo, Maria N. Quevedo, Alberto Sanchez</i>
<p>We perform a statistical and geometrothermodynamic analysis of three
different models of magnetic materials, namely, the translational free model,
the spin model, and the mean-field model. First, we derive the fundamental
equation for each model, which is then used as input to compute the metrics of
the corresponding equilibrium spaces. Analyzing the corresponding
geometrothermodynamic curvatures, we conclude that they can be used to describe
thermodynamic interaction, stability conditions, and the phase transition
structure of the modeled substances. In all the cases, we reproduce their
well-known behavior close to the Curie temperature. Moreover, in the case of
the model with spin, we found a curvature singularity which corresponds to a
novel transition, where a particular response function diverges, indicating the
presence of second order phase transition, according to Ehrenfest
classification.

<p>An exact solution is introduced for one dimensional space-fractional
Edwards-Wilkinson equation. It is shown that the roughness obeys the
Family-Viscek dynamic scaling form and the scaling exponents is derived. It is
seen that the scaling exponents are different from those coming from ordinary
Edwards-Wilkinson equation and depend on the fractional order. Scaling
exponents in the presence of correlated noise is also obtained.

<h3>Residual entropy from temperature incremental Monte Carlo method</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17827" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17827</a>
<br>
</p><i>Zenan Dai, Xiao Yan Xu</i>
<p>Residual entropy, indicative of the degrees of freedom in a system at
absolute zero, is a cornerstone for understanding quantum and classical ground
states. Despite its critical role in elucidating low-temperature phenomena and
ground state degeneracy, accurately quantifying residual entropy remains a
formidable challenge due to significant computational hurdles. In this Letter,
we introduce the Temperature Incremental Monte Carlo (TIMC) method, our novel
solution crafted to surmount these challenges. The TIMC method incrementally
calculates the partition function ratio of neighboring temperatures within
Monte Carlo simulations, enabling precise entropy calculations and providing
insights into a spectrum of other temperature-dependent observables in a single
computational sweep of temperatures. We have rigorously applied TIMC to a
variety of complex systems, such as the frustrated antiferromagnetic Ising
model on both C60 and 2D triangular lattices, the Newman-Moore spin glass
model, and a 2D quantum transverse field Ising model. Notably, our method
surmounts the traditional obstacles encountered in partition function
measurements when mapping $d$-dimensional quantum models to $d+1$-dimensional
classical counterparts. The TIMC method's finesse in detailing entropy across
the entire temperature range enriches our comprehension of critical phenomena
in condensed matter physics. This includes insights into spin glasses, phases
exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking, topological states of matter and
fracton phases. Our approach not only advances the methodology for probing the
entropic landscape of such systems but also paves the way for exploring their
broader thermodynamic and quantum mechanical properties.

<h3>Quantum anomalous Hall crystal at fractional filling of moiré  superlattices</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17832" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17832</a>

<p>We predict the emergence a state of matter with intertwined ferromagnetism,
charge order and topology in fractionally filled moir\'e superlattice bands.
Remarkably, these quantum anomalous Hall crystals exhibit a quantized integer
Hall conductance that is different than expected from the filling and Chern
number of the band. Microscopic calculations show that this phase is robustly
favored at half-filling ($\nu=1/2$) at larger twist angles of the twisted
semiconductor bilayer $t$MoTe$_2$

<h3>Performance limits of information engines</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17860" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17860</a>
<br>
</p><i>Johan du Buisson, David A. Sivak, John Bechhoefer</i>
<p>We review recent studies of a colloidal information engine that consists of a
bead in water and held by an optical trap. The bead is ratcheted upward without
any apparent external work, by taking advantage of favorable thermal
fluctuations. Much of the previous work on such engines aimed to show that
accounting for information-processing costs can reconcile the observed motion
with the second law of thermodynamics. By contrast, we focus on the factors
that limit the performance of such engines by optimizing variously the upward
velocity, rate of gravitational free-energy extraction, or ability to track a
trajectory. We then consider measurement noise, which degrades engine
performance. A naive use of noisy measurements in the feedback algorithm leads
to a phase transition at finite signal-to-noise ratio: below the transition,
the engine no longer functions. A more sophisticated, `Bayesian' algorithm
eliminates the phase transition and improves performance. Finally, operating
the information engine in a nonequilibrium environment with extra force
fluctuations can enhance the performance by orders of magnitude, even to the
point where the energy extracted exceeds that needed to run the information
processing. Autonomous implementations of an information engine in such
environments could be powered entirely by the additional energy of the bath.

<h3>Sublattice structure and topology in spontaneously crystallized  electronic states</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17867" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17867</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yongxin Zeng, Daniele Guerci, Valentin Crépel, Andrew J. Millis, Jennifer Cano</i>
<p>The prediction and realization of the quantum anomalous Hall effect are often
intimately connected to honeycomb lattices in which the sublattice degree of
freedom plays a central role in the nontrivial topology. Two-dimensional Wigner
crystals, on the other hand, form triangular lattices without sublattice
degrees of freedom, resulting in a topologically trivial state. In this Letter,
we discuss the possibility of spontaneously formed honeycomb-lattice crystals
that exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Starting from a single-band
system with nontrivial quantum geometry, we derive the mean-field energy
functional of a class of crystal states and express it as a model of sublattice
pseudospins in momentum space. We find that nontrivial quantum geometry leads
to extra terms in the pseudospin model that break an effective `time-reversal
symmetry' and favor a topologically nontrivial pseudospin texture. When the
effects of these extra terms dominate over the ferromagnetic exchange coupling
between pseudospins, the anomalous Hall crystal state becomes energetically
favorable over the trivial Wigner crystal state.

<h3>Magnetocaloric performance of RE$_{5}$Pd$_2$In$_4$ (RE = Tb-Tm)  compounds</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17912" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17912</a>
<br>
</p><i>Altifani Rizky Hayyu, Stanisław Baran, Andrzej Szytuła</i>
<p>Magnetocaloric performance of the RE$_{5}$Pd$_2$In$_4$ (RE = Tb-Tm) rare
earth compounds has been investigated using measurements of magnetization in
the function of temperature and applied magnetic field. The maximum magnetic
entropy change ($-\Delta S_{M}^{max}$) at magnetic flux density change ($\Delta
\mu_0 H$) of 0-9~T has been determined to be 3.3~J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$
at 62~K for Tb$_{5}$Pd$_2$In$_4$, 7.0~J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$ at 22~K
for Dy$_{5}$Pd$_2$In$_4$, 12.6~J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$ at 22~K for
Ho$_{5}$Pd$_2$In$_4$, 12.1~J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$ at 17~K for
Er$_{5}$Pd$_2$In$_4$ and 11.9~J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$ at 9.0~K for
Tm$_{5}$Pd$_2$In$_4$. The temperature averaged entropy change (TEC) with 3~K
span equals 3.2, 7.0, 12.6, 12.2 and 11.8~J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}\cdot$K$^{-1}$ for RE
= Tb-Tm, respectively. The relative cooling power (RCP) and refrigerant
capacity (RC) are equal to respectively 258 and 215~J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}$ in
Tb$_{5}$Pd$_2$In$_4$, 498 and 325~J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}$ in Dy$_{5}$Pd$_2$In$_4$,
489 and 403~J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}$ in Ho$_{5}$Pd$_2$In$_4$, 403 and
314~J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}$ in Er$_{5}$Pd$_2$In$_4$ and 234 and 184~J$\cdot$kg$^{-1}$
in Tm$_{5}$Pd$_2$In$_4$. The magnetocaloric properties of RE$_{5}$Pd$_2$In$_4$
are comparable to those of other known magnetocaloric materials, which show
good magnetocaloric performance at low temperatures. Among
RE$_{5}$Pd$_2$In$_4$, the highest values of parameters characterizing the
magnetocaloric effect are found for RE = Ho and Er. Furthermore, for fixed RE
element, the RE$_{5}$Pd$_2$In$_4$ compound displays the highest RCP and RC
values when compared to those of its isostructural RE$_{5}$T$_2$In$_4$ (T = Ni,
Pt) analogues.

<h3>Band structure and excitonic properties of WSe$_2$ in the isolated  monolayer limit in an all-electron approach</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17924" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17924</a>
<br>
</p><i>Niloufar Dadkhah, Walter R. L. Lambrecht</i>
<p>A study is presented of the electronic band structure and optical absorption
spectrum of monolayer WSe$_2$ using an all-electron quasiparticle
self-consistent $GW$ approach, QS$G\hat W$, in which the screened Coulomb
interaction $\hat W$ is calculated including ladder diagrams representing
electron-hole interaction. The Bethe-Salpeter Equation is used to calculate
both the screened Coulomb interaction $\hat W$ in the quasiparticle band
structure and the imaginary part of the macroscopic dielectric function. The
convergence of the quasiparticle band gap and lowest exciton peak position is
studied as function of the separation of the monolayers when using periodic
boundary conditions. The quasiparticle gap is found to vary as $1/d$ with $d$
the size of the vacuum separation, while the excitonic lowest peak reaches
convergence much faster. The nature of the exciton spectrum is analyzed and
shows several excitonic peaks below the quasiparticle gap when a sufficient
number of $\textbf{k}$ points is used. They are found to be in good agreement
with prior work and experiment after adding spin-orbit coupling corrections and
can be explained in the context of the Wannier-Mott theory adapted to 2D.

<h3>Electron-Induced Radiolysis Chemistry in Fluid Cell Electron Microscopy:  Application on the Reactivity of Aluminum Nanocubes</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17928" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17928</a>
<br>
</p><i>Kunmo Koo, Nikhil S. Chellam, Sangyoon Shim, Chad A. Mirkin, George C. Schatz, Xiaobing Hu, Vinayak P. Dravid</i>
<p>Leveraging the high energy electrons as probe for the atomic landscape of
materials, the importance of understanding radiolysis chemistry in the field of
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is exceptionally important. Reactive
chemical species generated from electron-material interactions diffuse
throughout the sample and may induce "artifact" reactions with the specimen of
interest. However, in other aspects, this radiolysis can be utilized to
intentionally trigger chemical reactions related to the nucleation and growth
of colloidal nanoparticles, as well as chemical etching under a priori
conditions in fluid condition. Therefore, systematic research and new theories
are required to help researchers gain a deeper understanding of these
electron-materials interactions either to mitigate damage or rationally use
radical chemistry especially in the environmental TEM (E-TEM). Radiolysis in
open-cell gas phase TEM (GPTEM) under reduced pressures is usually disregarded
considering the low density of molecules and high diffusivity. However, for
emerging closed-cell GPTEM, which usually involves the usage of higher
pressures, less is known. Here, we utilize an ultrathin (UT) silicon nitride
gas cell to investigate and quantify the effects of electron dosage on the
oxidation behavior of {100}-faceted aluminum (Al) nanocubes under various
conditions. In addition, we develop a generalized computational code to
elucidate radiolysis chemistry in varying media with consideration of the
diffusion dynamics, while rationalizing the experimental observations. Based on
these theoretical electron-fluid interaction models, we propose guidelines to
control the radical species of the closed-cell in situ nanoreactors, paving the
way to the nanoscale control of chemical reactions in E-TEM.

<h3>Universal energy-speed-accuracy trade-offs in driven nonequilibrium  systems</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17931" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17931</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jérémie Klinger, Grant M. Rotskoff</i>
<p>Physical systems driven away from equilibrium by an external controller
dissipate heat to the environment; the excess entropy production in the thermal
reservoir can be interpreted as a "cost" to transform the system in a finite
time. The connection between measure theoretic optimal transport and
dissipative nonequilibrium dynamics provides a language for quantifying this
cost and has resulted in a collection of "thermodynamic speed limits", which
argue that the minimum dissipation of a transformation between two probability
distributions is directly proportional to the rate of driving. Thermodynamic
speed limits rely on the assumption that the target probability distribution is
perfectly realized, which is almost never the case in experiments or numerical
simulations. Here, we address the ubiquitous situation in which the external
controller is imperfect. As a consequence, we obtain a lower bound for the
dissipated work in generic nonequilibrium control problems that 1) is
asymptotically tight and 2) matches the thermodynamic speed limit in the case
of optimal driving. We illustrate these bounds on analytically solvable
examples and also develop a strategy for optimizing minimally dissipative
protocols based on optimal transport flow matching, a generative machine
learning technique. This latter approach ensures the scalability of both the
theoretical and computational framework we put forth. Crucially, we demonstrate
that we can compute the terms in our bound numerically using efficient
algorithms from the computational optimal transport literature and that the
protocols that we learn saturate the bound.

<h3>Elastocaloric evidence for a multicomponent superconductor stabilized  within the nematic state in Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$</h3>

<p>The iron-based high-$T_c$ superconductors exhibit rich phase diagrams with
intertwined phases, including magnetism, nematicity and superconductivity. The
superconducting $T_c$ in many of these materials is maximized in the regime of
strong nematic fluctuations, making the role of nematicity in influencing the
superconductivity a topic of intense research. Here, we use the AC
elastocaloric effect (ECE) to map out the phase diagram of
Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ near optimal doping. The ECE signature at $T_c$
on the overdoped side, where superconductivity condenses without any nematic
order, is quantitatively consistent with other thermodynamic probes that
indicate a single-component superconducting state. In contrast, on the slightly
underdoped side, where superconductivity condenses within the nematic phase,
ECE reveals a second thermodynamic transition proximate to and below $T_c$. We
rule out magnetism and re-entrant tetragonality as the origin of this
transition, and find that our observations strongly suggest a phase transition
into a multicomponent superconducting state. This implies the existence of a
sub-dominant pairing instability that competes strongly with the dominant
$s^\pm$ instability. Our results thus motivate a re-examination of the pairing
state and its interplay with nematicity in this extensively studied iron-based
superconductor, while also demonstrating the power of ECE in uncovering
strain-tuned phase diagrams of quantum materials.

<h3>Multifunctional composite magnet for practical transverse  thermoelectrics</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Fuyuki Ando, Takamasa Hirai, Abdulkareem Alasli, Hossein Sepehri-Amin, Yutaka Iwasaki, Hosei Nagano, Ken-ichi Uchida</i>
<p>Permanent magnets are used in various products and essential for human
society. If omnipresent permanent magnets could directly convert heat into
electricity, they would lead to innovative energy harvesting and thermal
management technologies. However, achieving such "multifunctionality" has been
difficult because of the poor thermoelectric performance of conventional
magnets. Here, we develop a multifunctional composite magnet that enables giant
transverse thermoelectric conversion. The proposed composite material,
comprising alternately and obliquely stacked
SmCo$_5$/Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{1.8}$Te$_3$ multilayers, exhibits large remanent
magnetization and coercivity as well as an excellent figure of merit of 0.32
for transverse thermoelectric conversion around room temperature. While having
versatile transverse geometry and high mechanical durability, the thermopile
module based on these composite magnets generates 204 mW at a temperature
difference of 152 K owing to extremely low interfacial electrical and thermal
resistances. The corresponding power density per heat transfer area of 56.7
mW/cm$^2$ is not only record-high among all the transverse thermoelectric
modules but also comparable to those of commercial longitudinal thermoelectric
modules based on the Seebeck effect. The novel functional material enables the
integration of thermoelectric conversion capabilities wherever permanent
magnets are currently used.

<h3>Impact of etches on thin-film single-crystal niobium resonators</h3>

<p>A single crystal niobium thin film was grown using molecular beam epitaxy on
a c-plane sapphire wafer. Several samples were fabricated into dc resistivity
test devices and coplanar waveguide resonator chips using the same
microfabrication procedures and solvent cleans. The samples were then subject
to different acid cleaning treatments using different combinations of piranha,
hydrofluoric acid, and buffered oxide etch solutions. The different samples
expressed changes in dc resistivity in the normal and superconducting states
such that the low temperature resistivities changed by more than 100\%, and the
residual resistivity ratio dropped by a factor of 2. The internal quality
factor of coplanar waveguide resonators measured near 5~GHz also showed
significant variation at single photon powers ranging from 1.4$\times 10^6$ to
less than 60$\times 10^3$. These changes correlate with the formation of
surface crystallites that appear to be hydrocarbons. All observations are
consistent with hydrogen diffusing into the niobium film at levels below the
saturation threshold that is needed to observe niobium hydrides.

<h3>Study of superconductivity of very thin  $\mathrm{FeSe}_{1-x}\mathrm{Te}_x$ films investigated by microwave complex  conductivity measurements</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18082" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18082</a>

</p><i>Gaku Matsumoto, Ryo Ogawa, Koji Higasa, Tomoki Kobayashi, Hiroki Nakagawa, Atsutaka Maeda</i>
<p>Complex conductivity measurements spanning the entire temperature range,
including the vicinity of $T_c$, were conducted on systematically varied
FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ ($x$ = 0 - 0.5) very thin films. By applying a novel cavity
measurement technique employing microwave electric fields parallel to
FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ films, we observed distinct temperature-dependent
alterations in superfluid fraction and quasiparticle scattering rate at the
nematic boundary. These changes in the nematic boundary suggests variations in
the superconducting gap structure between samples in the nematic and
non-nematic phase. Moreover, fluctuation is visible up to 1.2 $T_c$
irrespective of nematic order, consistent with large superconducting
fluctuations in iron chalcogenide superconductors reported previously in [H.
Takahashi \textit{et al}, Phys. Rev. B 99, 060503(R) (1982)] and [F. Nabeshima

<h3>27Al-NMR Study on a square-Kagome lattice antiferromagnet</h3>

</p><i>Takayuki Goto, Masayoshi Fujihala, Setsuo Mitsuda</i>
<p>NMR study has been performed on an S = 1/2 antiferromagnet KCu6AlBiO4(SO4)5Cl
on the square-Kagome lattice, which has three slightly inequivalent
nearest-neighbor interactions. Because of the geometrical frustration inherited
from triangles within the square kagome lattice and of the low dimensionality,
a long range magnetic order is strongly suppressed; its absence has so far been
confirmed in low temperatures down to dilution refrigerator region. 27Al-NMR
spectra and the longitudinal relaxation time T1 were measured by a conventional
pulsed spectrometer on powder sample under several magnetic fields between 3
and 10 T and in low temperatures down to 0.35 K. The NMR line width due to the
inhomogeneous broadening increased with lowering temperatures and leveled off
below 3 K, where FWHM reached the value as large as 0.1 T, implying that the
ground state is magnetic one, consistent with previous reports. On the other
hand, the longitudinal nuclear spin relaxation rate 1/T1 obeyed the Arrhenius
law with the thermal activation energy {\Delta} = 2K at low temperatures,
suggesting that a small gap is formed in the spin excitation spectrum.

<h3>Entropy production from waiting-time distributions for overdamped  Langevin dynamics</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Ellen Meyberg, Julius Degünther, Udo Seifert</i>
<p>For a Markovian dynamics on discrete states, the logarithmic ratio of
waiting-time distributions between two successive, instantaneous transitions in
forward and backward direction is a measure of time-irreversibility. It thus
serves as an entropy estimator, which is exact in the case of a uni-cyclic
network. We adopt this framework to overdamped Langevin dynamics, where such
transitions have finite duration. By introducing milestones based on the
observation of a particle at at least three points, we identify an entropy
estimator that becomes exact for driven motion along a one-dimensional
potential.

<h3>Strategies for the alignment of electronic states in quantum-dot  tunnel-injection lasers and their influence on the emission dynamics</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Michael Lorke, Igor Khanonkin, Stephan Michael, Johann Peter Reithmaier, Gadi Eisenstein, Frank Jahnke</i>
<p>In quantum-dot tunnel-injection lasers, the excited charge carriers are
efficiently captured from the bulk states via an injector quantum well and then
transferred into the quantum dots via a tunnel barrier. The alignment of the
electronic levels is crucial for the high efficiency of these processes and
especially for the fast modulation dynamics of these lasers. In particular, the
quantum mechanical nature of the tunneling process must be taken into account
in the transition from two-dimensional quantum well states to zero-dimensional
quantum dot states. This results in hybrid states, from which the scattering
into the quantum-dot ground states takes place. We combine electronic state
calculations of the tunnel-injection structures with many-body calculations of
the scattering processes and insert this into a complete laser simulator. This
allows us to study the influence of the level alignment and limitations due to
inhomogeneous quantum-dot distributions. We find that the optimal alignment
deviates from a simple picture in which the of the quantum-dot ground state
energies are one LO-phonon energy below the injector quantum well ground state.

<h3>Harnessing the Duality of Magnetism and Conductivity: A Review of Oxide  based Dilute Magnetic Semiconductors</h3>

</p><i>Pankaj Bhardwaj, Jarnail Singh, Vikram Verma, Ravi Kumar</i>
<p>Over the last two decades, the new branch of spintronics, i.e., semiconductor
spintronics, has gained more attention because it integrates the
characteristics of conventional semiconductors, such as optical bandgap and
charge carriers, helpful for processing and computing pieces of information
combined with magnets for data storage applications in a single device.
Likewise, substituting transition metal (TM) ions to induce magnetic qualities
into semiconductors or oxides creates dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) or
oxides (DMOs) with high electronic, photonic, and magnetic functionality. This
review article discusses the historical outline of magnetic semiconductors with
their origin and mechanism. It also includes a concise overview of various DMO
systems based on their conductivity (p-type and n-type) to elucidate the
synthesis, origin, and control mechanisms and further evoke the prepared
spintronics devices. The occurrence of RTFM with transparency and conductivity
can be helpful in spintronics device fabrications, which was assumed to be
governed by the formation of intrinsic defects, charge carriers, morphology,
and the induced exchange interactions between ions. The DMOs-based spintronics
devices, such as magneto-optical devices, transparent ferromagnets, and
spin-based solar cells, exploit both semiconducting and magnetic properties,
which have also been discussed in this review article with outlook and
perspectives.

calculations. Along the hexagonal $a$- and $c$-axes, the peaks in the
middle-infrared region originating from the hybridization between conduction
bands and Ce~$4f$ states appear even at room temperature, indicating strong
valence fluctuation. Renormalized Drude structures observed at the photon
energy below 100~meV, on the other hand, obey the dynamical Planckian scaling
below 80~K for $E \parallel a$ and below 200~K for $E \parallel c$, suggesting
the non-Fermi liquid behavior due to the quantum criticality. These results
indicate that the coexistence of the valence fluctuation and quantum
criticality is a consequence of anisotropic magnetic fluctuations based on the
Ce quasi-kagome lattice structure

<h3>Lindblad dynamics from spatio-temporal correlation functions in  nonintegrable spin-1/2 chains with different boundary conditions</h3>

<p>We investigate the Lindblad equation in the context of boundary-driven
magnetization transport in spin-$1/2$ chains. Our central question is whether
the nonequilibrium steady state of the open system, including its buildup in
time, can be described on the basis of the dynamics in the closed system. To
this end, we rely on a previous work [Phys. Rev. B 108, L201119 (2023)], where
a description in terms of spatio-temporal correlation functions has been
suggested in the case of weak driving and small system-bath coupling. Because
this work has focused on integrable systems and periodic boundary conditions,
we here extend the analysis in three directions: We (i) consider nonintegrable
systems, (ii) take into account open boundary conditions and other
bath-coupling geometries, and (iii) provide a comparison to time-evolving block
decimation. While we find that nonintegrability plays a minor role, the choice
of the specific boundary conditions can be crucial, due to potentially
nondecaying edge modes. Our large-scale numerical simulations suggest that a
description based on closed-system correlation functions is an useful
alternative to already existing state-of-the-art approaches.

<h3>Plasma-induced magnetic phase in 3D $\mathrm{Mn^{II}-Nb^{IV}}$  octacyanidometalate with magnetic sponge behavior</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Dominik Czernia, Piotr Konieczny, Marcin Perzanowski, Beata Nowicka, Dawid Pinkowicz</i>
<p>A new magnetic phase with $T_C = 72 \ \mathrm K$ was obtained by exposing the
three-dimensional $\mathrm{\{ [Mn^{II}(H_2O)_2]_2[Nb^{IV}(CN)_8] \cdot 4H_2O \}
_n}$ coordination ferrimagnet ($T_C = 49 \ \mathrm K$) to air, oxygen,
nitrogen, and argon-based plasma. The X-ray powder diffraction pattern revealed
that the unit cell shrank after plasma treatment, leading to a 20% enhancement
of the superexchange couplings, as estimated from the mean-field approximation
(MFA) model. Although no stable dehydrated form was found in the
thermogravimetric analysis, the observed changes are attributed to the removal
of crystallization water molecules. The plasma-induced magnetic phase could not
be obtained by exposing the studied material to 0% relative humidity during
dynamic vapor sorption. Instead, the material underwent a major structural
reorganization after dehydration, necessitating an extended MFA model to
reproduce the magnetic susceptibility. These findings demonstrate that
plasma-induced changes can create unique magnetic phases in molecule-based
systems that are otherwise unobtainable.

<h3>Gravity effects on a bio-inspired self-burrowing probe in granular soils</h3>

<p>In recent years, self-burrowing probes have been studied since they can be
suitable for soil monitoring in locations with limited access such as outer
space bodies and underneath existing structures. We study the performance of a
self-burrowing probe under different gravity conditions, from low gravity
(i.e., 1/6g, 1/3g and 1g) to high gravity (i.e., 5g, 10g and 15g), specifically
in terms of penetration distance and energy consumption. Results show that the
probe reaches efficient penetration in all gravity conditions and that it
achieves larger penetration distances in high gravity conditions. However, the
penetration efficiency, shown as unit energy per meter, is higher in low
gravity. Additionally, we prove that a simple dimensional analysis provides
reasonable scaling factors for first order effects in forces, velocities and
energy. The findings in this study give confidence to the potential use of
self-burrowing probes in campaigns of soil testing and sensor deployment in
outer space or centrifuges in which the gravity conditions can differ from
Earth.

<p>Fluoride salts demonstrate significant potential for applications in
next-generation nuclear reactors, necessitating a comprehensive understanding
of their thermophysical properties for technological advancements. Experimental
measurement of these properties poses challenges, due to factors such as high
temperatures, impurity control, and corrosion. Consequently, precise
computational modeling methods become essential for predicting the
thermophysical properties of molten salts. In this work, we performed molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations of several thermophysical properties of the eutectic
salt mixture LiF-NaF-KF (FLiNaK) melt, including density, self-diffusion
coefficients, viscosity, and thermal conductivity. We demonstrated the
successful application of moment tensor potentials (MTP) as an accurate model
for interatomic interactions in FLiNaK. Our results on thermophysical
properties calculations exhibit strong agreement with experimental data. An
important aspect of our methodology is the incorporation of an active learning
scheme, which enables the generation of a robust and accurate potential, while
maintaining a moderate-sized training dataset.

<p>The sharp Dirac cone of the electronic dispersion confers to graphene a
remarkable sensitivity to strain. It is usually encoded in scalar and
pseudo-vector potentials, induced by the modification of hopping parameters,
which have given rise to new phenomena at the nanoscale such as giant
pseudomagnetic fields and valley polarization. Here, we unveil the effect of
these potentials on the quantum transport across a succession of strain-induced
barriers. We use high-mobility, hBN-encapsulated graphene, transferred over a
large (10x10 $\mu$m$^{2}$) crenellated hBN substrate. We show the emergence of
a broad resistance ancillary peak at positive energy that arises from Klein
tunneling barriers induced by the tensile strain at the trench edges. Our
theoretical study, in quantitative agreement with experiment, highlights the
balanced contributions of strain-induced scalar and pseudo-vector potentials on
ballistic transport. Our results establish crenellated van der Waals
heterostructures as a promising platform for strain engineering in view of
applications and basic physics.

<h3>Phononic Crystals in Superfluid Thin-Film Helium</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Alexander Rolf Korsch, Niccolò Fiaschi, Simon Gröblacher</i>
<p>In recent years, nanomechanical oscillators in thin films of superfluid
helium have attracted attention in the field of optomechanics due to their
exceptionally low mechanical dissipation and optical scattering. Mechanical
excitations in superfluid thin films - so-called third sound waves - can
interact with the optical mode of an optical microresonator by modulation of
its effective refractive index enabling optomechanical coupling. Strong
confinement of third sound modes enhances their intrinsic mechanical
non-linearity paving the way for strong phonon-phonon interactions with
applications in quantum optomechanics. Here, we realize a phononic crystal
cavity confining third sound modes in a superfluid helium film to length scales
close to the third sound wavelength. A few nanometer thick superfluid film is
self-assembled on top of a silicon nanobeam optical resonator. The periodic
patterning of the silicon material creates a periodic modulation of the
superfluid film leading to the formation of a phononic band gap. By engineering
the geometry of the silicon nanobeam, the phononic band gap allows the
confinement of a localized phononic mode.

<p>Bosonic condensation and lasing of exciton-polaritons in microcavities is a
fascinating solid-state phenomenon. It provides a versatile platform to study
out-of-equilibrium many-body physics and has recently appeared at the forefront
of quantum technologies. Here, we study the photon statistics via the
second-order temporal correlation function of polariton lasing emerging from an
optical microcavity integrated with an atomically thin MoSe2 crystal.
Furthermore, we investigate the macroscopic polariton phase transition for
varying excitation powers and temperatures. The lower-polariton exhibits photon
bunching below the threshold, implying a dominant thermal distribution of the
emission, while above the threshold, the second-order correlation transits
towards unity, which evidences the formation of a coherent state. Our findings
are in agreement with a microscopic numerical model, which explicitly includes
scattering with phonons on the quantum level.

<h3>Ferroelectrically tunable topological phase transition in In$_2$Se$_3$  thin films</h3>

</p><i>Zhiqiang Tian, Ziming Zhu, Jiang Zeng, Chao-Fei Liu, Yurong Yang, Anlian Pan, Mingxing Chen</i>
<p>Materials with ferroelectrically switchable topological properties are of
interest for both fundamental physics and practical applications. Using
first-principles calculations, we find that stacking ferroelectric
$\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ monolayers into a bilayer leads to polarization-dependent
band structures, which yields polarization-dependent topological properties.
Specifically, we find that the states with interlayer ferroelectric couplings
are quantum spin Hall insulators, while those with antiferroelectric
polarizations are normal insulators. We further find that In$_2$Se$_3$ trilayer
and quadlayer exhibit nontrivial band topology as long as in the structure the
ferroelectric In$_2$Se$_3$ bilayer is antiferroelectrically coupled to
In$_2$Se$_3$ monolayers or other ferroelectric In$_2$Se$_3$ bilayer. Otherwise
the system is topologically trivial. The reason is that near the Fermi level
the band structure of the ferroelectric In$_2$Se$_3$ bilayer has to be
maintained for the nontrivial band topology. This feature can be used to design
nontrivial band topology for the thicker films by a proper combination of the
interlayer polarization couplings. The topological properties can be
ferroelectrically tunable using the dipole locking effect. Our study reveals
switchable band topology in a family of natural ferroelectrics, which provide a
platform for designing new functional devices.

<h3>Cotunneling effects in the geometric statistics of a nonequilibrium  spintronic junction</h3>

</p><i>Mriganka Sandilya, Javed Akhtar, Manash Jyoti Sarmah, Himangshu Prabal Goswami</i>
<p>In the nonequilibrium steadystate of electronic transport across a
spin-resolved quantronic junction, we investigate the role of cotunneling on
the emergent statistics under phase-different adiabatic modulation of the
reservoirs' chemical potentials. By explicitly identifying the sequential and
inelastic cotunneling rates, we numerically evaluate the geometric or
Pancharatnam-Berry contributions to the spin exchange flux. We identify the
relevant conditions wherein the sequential and cotunneling processes compete
and selectively influence the total geometric flux upshot. The Fock space
coherences are found to suppress the cotunneling effects when the system
reservoir couplings are comparable. The cotunneling contribution to the total
geometric flux can be made comparable to the sequential contribution by
creating a rightsided asymmetry in the system-reservoir coupling strength.
Using a recently proposed geometric thermodynamic uncertainty relationship, we
numerically estimate the total rate of minimal entropy production. The
geometric flux and the minimum entropy are found to be nonlinear as a function
of the interaction energy of the junction's spin orbitals.

<h3>A Simple Tensorial Theory of Smectic C Liquid Crystals</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Jingmin Xia, Yucen Han</i>
<p>The smectic C (smC) phase represents a unique class of liquid crystal phases
characterised by the layered arrangement of molecules with tilted orientations
with respect to layer normals. Building upon the real-valued tensorial smectic
A (smA) model in [Xia et al., PRL, 126, 177801 (2021)], we propose a new
continuous mathematical model for smC (and smA) by introducing a novel coupling
term between the real tensor containing orientational information and density
variation, to control the tilt angle between directors and the layer normal
(the tilt angle is zero for smA and nonzero for smC). To validate our proposed
model, we conduct a series of two- and three-dimensional numerical experiments
that account for typical structures in smectics: chevron patterns, defects,
dislocations and toroidal focal conic domains (TFCDs). These results also
reveal the phenomenological differences between smA and smC configurations.

<br>
</p><i>Lin Wang, Guido Burkard</i>
<p>We investigate the valley relaxation due to intervalley coupling in a
single-electron bilayer graphene quantum dot. The valley relaxation is assisted
by both the emission of acoustic phonons via the deformation potential and
bond-length change mechanisms and $1/f$ charge noise. In the perpendicular
magnetic-field dependence of the valley relaxation time $T_1$, we predict a
monotonic decrease of $T_1$ at higher fields due to electron-phonon coupling,
which is in good agreement with recent experiments by Banszerus et al. We find
that the dominant valley relaxation channel in the high-field regime is the
electron-phonon coupling via the deformation potential. At lower fields, we
predict that a peak in $T_1$ can arise from the competition between $1/f$
charge noise and electron-phonon scattering due to bond-length change. We also
find that the interlayer hopping $\gamma_3$ opens a valley relaxation channel
for electric charge noise for rotationally symmetric quantum dots in bilayer
graphene.

<p>To describe the polar properties of the nanosized HfxZr1-xO2-y, we evolve the
"effective" Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) model based on the parametrization
of the Landau expansion coefficients for the polar and antipolar orderings. We
have shown that the effective LGD model can predict the influence of screening
conditions and size effects on phase diagrams, polarization reversal and
structural properties of the nanosized HfxZr1-xO2-y of various shape and sizes.
To verify the model, we use available experimental results for HfxZr1-xO2 thin
films and oxygen-deficient HfO2-y nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction was used to
determine the phase composition of the HfO2-y nanoparticles prepared at
different annealing conditions and revealed the formation of the ferroelectric
orthorhombic phase. Micro-Raman spectroscopy was used to explore the
correlation of lattice dynamics and structural changes appearing in dependence
on the oxygen vacancies concentration. Obtained results can be promising for
creation of next generation Si-compatible ferroelectric nanomaterials based on
HfxZr1-xO2-y.

<p>Superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices, involving quantum dots
interfaced with floating and/or grounded superconductors, have reached a level
of complexity which calls for the development of versatile and numerically
efficient modelling tools. Here, we propose an extension of the surrogate model
solver for sub-gap states [Phys. Rev. B 108, L220506 (2023)], which is able to
handle floating superconducting islands with finite charging energy. Upon
eliminating all finite-size effects of the computationally demanding Richardson
model approach, we achieve a more efficient way of calculating the sub-gap
spectra and related observables without compromising their accuracy. We provide
a number of benchmarks between the two approaches and showcase the versatility
of the extended surrogate model solver by studying the stability of
spin-triplet ground states in various tunable devices. The methods introduced
here set the stage for reliable microscopic simulations of complex

<p>Materials with strongly correlated electrons exhibit physical properties that
are often difficult to predict as they result from the interactions of large
numbers of electrons combined with several quantum de-grees of freedom. The
layered oxide perovskite Sr2RuO4 is a strongly correlated electron material
that has been intensively investigated since its discovery due to its unusual
physical properties. Whilst re-cent experiments have reopened the debate on the
exact symmetry of the superconducting state in Sr2RuO4, a deeper understanding
of the Sr2RuO4 normal state appears crucial as this is the back-ground in which
electron pairing occurs. Here, by using low-energy muon spin spectroscopy we
dis-cover the existence of magnetism at the surface of Sr2RuO4 in its normal
state. We detect static weak dipolar fields yet manifesting below a relatively
high onset temperature larger than 50 K, which re-veals the unconventional
nature of the observed magnetism. We relate the origin of this phase break-ing
time reversal symmetry to electronic ordering in the form of orbital loop
currents that originate at the reconstructed Sr2RuO4 surface. Our observations
set a reference for the discovery of the same magnetic phase in other materials
and unveil an electronic ordering mechanism that can influence un-conventional
electron pairing with broken time reversal symmetry in those materials where
the ob-served magnetic phase coexists with superconductivity.

</p><i>Bi-Yang Tan, Yueshui Zhang, Hua-Chen Zhang, Wei Tang, Lei Wang, Hong-Hao Tu, Ying-Hai Wu</i>
<p>The low-energy physics of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) is controlled by
the Luttinger parameter. We demonstrate that this parameter can be extracted
from a single wave function for one-component TLLs with periodic boundary
condition. This method relies on the fact that TLLs are described by conformal
field theory in which crosscap states can be constructed. The overlaps between
the crosscap states and the ground state as well as some excited states are
proved to be universal numbers that directly reveal the Luttinger parameter. In
microscopic lattice models, crosscap states are formed by putting each pair of
antipodal sites into a maximally entangled state. Analytical and numerical
calculations are performed in a few representative models to substantiate the
conformal field theory prediction. The extracted Luttinger parameters are
generally quite accurate in finite-size systems with moderate lengths, so there
is no need to perform data fitting and/or finite-size scaling.

</p><i>A. N. Zarezad, A. Qaiumzadeh, J. Barnaś, A. Dyrdał</i>
<p>The topological charge Hall effect (TCHE) and the topological spin Hall
effect (TSHE), arising from ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM)
skyrmions, respectively; can be elucidated through the emergence of
spin-dependent Berry gauge fields that affect the adiabatic flow of electrons
within the skyrmion texture. TCHE is absent in systems with parity-time (PT)
symmetry, such as collinear AFM systems. In this study, we theoretically study
TCHE and TSHE in a canted antiferromagnet within the diffusive regime. Spin
canting or weak ferromagnetism in canted AFMs that breaks the PT symmetry may
arise from strong homogeneous Dzyaloshinskii-Morya interactions. Using a
semiclassical Boltzmann approach, we obtain diffusion equations for the spin
and charge accumulations in the presence of finite spin-flip and spin-dependent
momentum relaxation times. We show that the finite net magnetization, stemming
from spin canting and the subsequent breaking of parity-time symmetry, results
in the emergence of both finite TCHE and TSHE in AFM systems.

</p><i>A.R. Mazza, J. Yan, S. Middey, J. S. Gardner, A.-H. Chen, M. Brahlek, T.Z. Ward</i>
<p>Many of the most exciting materials discoveries in fundamental condensed
matter physics are made in systems hosting some degree of intrinsic disorder.
While disorder has historically been regarded as something to be avoided in
materials design, it is often of central importance to correlated and quantum
materials. This is largely driven by the conceptual and theoretical ease to
handle, predict, and understand highly uniform systems that exhibit complex
interactions, symmetries and band structures. In this perspective, we highlight
how flipping this paradigm has enabled exciting possibilities in the emerging
field of high entropy oxide (HEO) quantum materials. These materials host high
levels of cation or anion compositional disorder while maintaining unexpectedly
uniform single crystal lattices. The diversity of atomic scale interactions of
spin, charge, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom are found to emerge into
coherent properties on much larger length scales. Thus, altering the variance
and magnitudes of the atomic scale properties through elemental selection can
open new routes to tune global correlated phases such as magnetism,
metal-insulator transitions, ferroelectricity, and even emergent topological
responses. The strategy of embracing disorder in this way provides a much
broader pallet from which functional states can be designed for next-generation
microelectronic and quantum information systems.

<p>Qubits that can be efficiently controlled are pivotal in the development of
scalable quantum hardware. Resonant control is commonly embraced to execute
high-fidelity quantum gates but demands integration of high-frequency
oscillating signals and results in qubit crosstalk and heating. Establishing
quantum control based on discrete signals could therefore result in a paradigm
shift. This may be accomplished with single-spin semiconductor qubits, if one
can engineer hopping spins between quantum dots with site-dependent spin
quantization axis. Here, we introduce hopping-based universal quantum logic and
obtain single-qubit gate fidelities of 99.97%, coherent shuttling fidelities of
99.992%, and two-qubit gates fidelities of 99.3%, corresponding to error rates
that have been predicted to allow for quantum error correction. We demonstrate
that hopping spins also constitute an elegant tuning method by statistically
mapping the coherence of a 10-quantum dot system. These results motivate dense
quantum dot arrays with sparse occupation for efficient and high-connectivity
qubit registers.

<h3>Effect of a perpendicular magnetic field on bilayer graphene under dual  gating</h3>

</p><i>Mouhamadou Hassane Saley, Abderrahim El Mouhafid, Ahmed Jellal</i>
<p>By studying the impact of a perpendicular magnetic field $B$ on AB-bilayer
graphene (AB-BLG) under dual gating, we yield several key findings for the
ballistic transport of gate $U_\infty$. Firstly, we discover that the presence
of $B$ leads to a decrease in transmission. At a high value of $B$, we notice
the occurrence of anti-Klein tunneling over a significant area. Secondly, in
contrast to the results reported in the literature, where high peaks were found
with an increasing in-plane pseudomagnetic field applied to AB-BLG, we find a
decrease in conductivity as $B$ increases. However, it is worth noting that in
both cases, the number of oscillations decreases compared to the result in the
study where no magnetic field was present $(B = 0)$. Thirdly, at the neutrality
point, we demonstrate that the conductivity decreases and eventually reaches
zero for a high value of $B$, which contrasts with the result that the
conductivity remains unchanged regardless of the value taken by the in-plane
field. Finally, we consider the diffusive transport with gate $U_\infty = 0.2
\gamma_1$ and observe two scenarios. The amplitude of conductivity oscillations
increases with $B$ for energy $E$ less than $U_\infty$ but decreases in the
opposite case $E>U_\infty$.

<h3>Predicting Phase Transitions in PbTiO$_3$ using Zentropy</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Nigel Lee En Hew, Shun-Li Shang, Zi-Kui Liu</i>
<p>According to conventional X-ray measurements, PbTiO$_3$ undergoes a phase
transition from a tetragonal ferroelectric phase to a cubic paraelectric phase
at 763 K. However, x-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) measurements indicate
that PbTiO$_3$ is tetragonal even after the phase transition has occurred. The
difference in these results concerns the length scales accessible to each
measurement technique: millimeters for X-ray and Angstroms for XAFS. For both
of these measurements to be consistent, PbTiO$_3$ is macroscopically cubic but
still locally tetragonal above the phase transition temperature. Despite this,
most models, such as the Laundau-Ginsburg-Devonshire theory, are still unable
to explain this phenomenon. Moreover, these methods involve model parameters
fitted to experimental or theoretical data and do not consider other tetragonal
configurations, such as domain walls, to predict the phase transition. In this
study, we use our novel zentropy approach to predict the phase transition,
which allows us to calculate the total entropy of a system without fitted
parameters, taking only inputs from density functional theory calculations
through energy-volume curves and phonon calculations. Our approach also
considers the tetragonal 90{\deg} and 180{\deg} domain walls and the
ferroelectric ground state in predicting the phase transition. The predicted
phase transition using the metaGGA $r^2\text{SCAN}$ occurs at 830 K, showing
good agreement with the experimental value of 763 K. It is the subject of
future work to show that the statistical average of these tetragonal
configurations at the phase transition will result in the cubic phase.

<p>We present in-situ x-ray diffraction and velocity measurements of Fe$_2$O$_3$
under laser shock compression at pressures between 38-116 GPa. None of the
phases reported by static compression studies were observed. Instead, we
observed an isostructural phase transition from $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ to a new
$\alpha^\prime$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ phase at a pressure of 50-62 GPa. The
$\alpha^\prime$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ phase differs from $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ by an 11%
volume drop and a different unit cell compressibility. We further observed a
two-wave structure in the velocity profile, which can be related to an
intermediate regime where both $\alpha$ and $\alpha^\prime$ phases coexist.
Density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard parameter indicate that
the observed unit cell volume drop can be associated with a spin transition
following a magnetic collapse.

<h3>Magnetization fluctuations and magnetic aftereffect probed via the  anomalous Hall effect</h3>

<p>Taking advantage of the anomalous Hall effect, we electrically probe
low-frequency magnetization fluctuations at room temperature in a thin
ferromagnetic Pt/Co/AlO$_x$ layer stack with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.
We observe a strong enhancement of the Hall voltage fluctuations within the
hysteretic region of the magnetization loop. Analyzing both the temporal
evolution of the anomalous Hall voltage and its frequency-dependent noise power
density, we identify two types of magnetic noise: abrupt changes in the
magnetic domain configuration, evident as Barkhausen-like steps in the Hall
voltage time trace, yield a noise power density spectrum scaling with frequency
as $1/f^{\beta}$ with $\beta\approx 1.9$. In contrast, quasi-stationary
magnetization configurations are connected with a magnetic noise power density
with an exponent $\beta\approx 0.9$. The observation of Barkausen steps and
relaxation effects shows that the magnetic system is in a non-stationary state
in the hysteresis region, such that the fluctuation-dissipation theorem cannot
be expected to hold. However, the time-dependent change in the Hall voltage for
constant magnetic field strength resembles the integrated noise power.

<h3>Anomalous Hall Effect in Thin Bismuth</h3>

</p><i>Oulin Yu, Sujatha Vijayakrishnan, R. Allgayer, T. Szkopek, G. Gervais</i>
<p>Bismuth, the heaviest of all group V elements with strong spin-orbit
coupling, is famously known to exhibit many interesting transport properties,
and effects such as Shubnikov-de Haas and de Haas-van Alphen were first
revealed in its bulk form. However, the transport properties have not yet been
fully explored experimentally in thin bismuth nor in its 2D limit. In this
work, bismuth flakes with average thicknesses ranging from 29 to 69 nm were
mechanically exfoliated by a micro-trench technique and were used to fabricate
four-point devices. Due to mixing of components, Onsager's relations were used
to extract the longitudinal ($R_{xx}$) and Hall ($R_{xy}$) resistances where
the latter shows a Hall anomaly that is consistent with the Anomalous Hall
Effect (AHE). Our work strongly suggests that that there could be a hidden
mechanism for time-reversal symmetry breaking in pure bismuth thin films.

<h3>Unraveling the complexity of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in  layered magnets: Towards its full magnitude and chirality control</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Khalil Zakeri, Albrecht von Faber, Sergiy Mankovsky, Hubert Ebert</i>
<p>Chirality is an inherent characteristics of some objects in nature. In
magnetism chiral magnetic textures can be formed in systems with broken
inversion symmetry and due to an antisymmetric magnetic interaction, known as
Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction (DMI). Here, aiming on a fundamental
understanding of this chiral interaction on the atomic scale, we design several
synthetic layered structures composed of alternating atomic layers of 3d
ferromagnetic metals epitaxially grown on Ir(001). We demonstrate both
experimentally and theoretically that the atomistic DMI depends critically not
only on the orbital occupancy of the interface magnetic layer but also on the
sequence of the atomic layers. The effect is attributed to the complexity of
the electronic structure and the contribution of different orbitals to the
hybridization and DMI. We anticipate that our results provide guidelines for
controlling both the chirality and the magnitude of the atomistic DMI.

<h3>Dynamic instabilities and turbulence of merged rotating Bose-Einstein  condensates</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18474" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18474</a>
<br>
</p><i>Anirudh Sivakumar, Pankaj Kumar Mishra, Ahmad A. Hujeirat, Paulsamy Muruganandam</i>
<p>We present the simulation results of merging harmonically confined rotating
Bose-Einstein condensates in two dimensions. Merging of the condensate is
triggered by positioning the rotation axis at the trap minima and moving both
condensates towards each other while slowly ramping their rotation frequency.
We analyze the dynamics of the merged condensate by letting them evolve under a
single harmonic trap. We systematically investigate the formation of solitonic
and vortex structures in the final, unified condensate, considering both
non-rotating and rotating initial states. In both cases, merging leads to the
formation of solitons that decay into vortex pairs through snake instability
and subsequently, these pairs annihilate. Soliton formation and decay-induced
phase excitations generate sound waves, more pronounced when the merging time
is short. We witness no sound wave generation at sufficiently longer merging
times that finally leads to the condensate reaching its ground state. With
rotation, we notice off-axis merging (where the rotation axes are not aligned),
leading to the distortion and weakening of soliton formation. The
incompressible kinetic energy spectrum exhibits a Kolmogorov-like cascade
[$E(k) \sim k^{-5/3}$] in the initial stage for merging condensates rotating
above a critical frequency and a Vinen-like cascade [$E(k) \sim k^{-1}$] at a
later time for all cases. Our findings hold potential significance for atomic
interferometry, continuous atomic lasers, and cosmic events related to the
remnants of binary neutron-star mergers.

<h3>Nuclear magnetic resonance studies in a model transverse field Ising  system</h3>

</p><i>Y-H. Nian, I. Vinograd, C. Chaffey, Y. Li, M. P. Zic, P. Massat, R. R. P. Singh, I. R. Fisher, N. J. Curro</i>
<p>The suppression of ferroquadrupolar order in TmVO$_4$ in a magnetic field is
well-described by the transverse field Ising model, enabling detailed studies
of critical dynamics near the quantum phase transition. We describe nuclear
magnetic resonance measurements in pure and Y-doped single crystals. The
non-Kramers nature of the ground state doublet leads to a unique form of the
hyperfine coupling that exclusively probes the transverse field susceptibility.
Our results show that this quantity diverges at the critical field, in contrast
to the mean-field prediction. Furthermore, we find evidence for quantum
critical fluctuations present near Tm-rich regions in Y-doped crystals at
levels beyond which long-range order is suppressed, suggesting the presence of
quantum Griffiths phases.

<h3>Rigorously proven chaos in chemical kinetics</h3>

<br>
</p><i>M. Susits, J. Tóth</i>
<p>This study addresses a longstanding question regarding the mathematical proof
of chaotic behavior in kinetic differential equations. Following the numerous
numerical and experimental results in the past 50 years, we introduce two
formal chemical reactions that rigorously demonstrate this behavior. Our
approach involves transforming chaotic equations into kinetic differential
equations and subsequently realizing these equations through formal chemical
reactions. The findings present a novel perspective on chaotic dynamics within
chemical kinetics, thereby resolving a longstanding open problem.

<h3>Phase transitions beyond criticality: extending Ising universal scaling  functions to describe entire phases</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18531" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18531</a>
<br>
</p><i>David Hathcock, James P. Sethna</i>
<p>Universal scaling laws only apply asymptotically near critical phase
transitions. We propose a general scheme, based on normal form theory of
renormalization group flows, for incorporating corrections to scaling that
quantitatively describe the entire neighboring phases. Expanding Onsager's
exact solution of the 2D Ising model about the critical point, we identify a
special coordinate with radius of convergence covering the entire physical
temperature range, $0<T<\infty$. Without an exact solution, we demonstrate that
using solely the critical singularity with low- and high-temperature expansions
leads to exponentially converging approximations across all temperatures for
both the 2D and 3D Ising free energies and the 3D magnetization. We discuss
challenges and opportunities for future work.

<h3>Peak Effect and Dynamics of Stripe and Pattern Forming Systems on a  Periodic One Dimensional Substrate</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18539" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18539</a>
<br>
</p><i>C. Reichhardt, C.J.O. Reichhardt</i>
<p>We examine the ordering, pinning, and dynamics of two-dimensional pattern
forming systems interacting with a periodic one-dimensional substrate. In the
absence of the substrate, particles with competing long-range repulsion and
short-range attraction form anisotropic crystal, stripe, and bubble states.
When the system is tuned across the stripe transition in the presence of a
substrate, we find that there is a peak effect in the critical depinning force
when the stripes align and become commensurate with the substrate. Under an
applied drive, the anisotropic crystal and stripe states can exhibit soliton
depinning and plastic flow. When the stripes depin plastically, they
dynamically reorder into a moving stripe state that is perpendicular to the
substrate trough direction. We also find that when the substrate spacing is
smaller than the widths of the bubbles or stripes, the system forms pinned
stripe states that are perpendicular to the substrate trough direction. The
system exhibits multiple reentrant pinning effects as a function of increasing
attraction, with the anisotropic crystal and large bubble states experiencing
weak pinning but the stripe and smaller bubble states showing stronger pinning.
We map out the different dynamic phases as a function of filling, the strength
of the attractive interaction term, the substrate strength, and the drive, and
demonstrate that the different phases produce identifiable features in the
transport curves and particle orderings.

<h3>Stabilizing topological superconductivity in disordered spin-orbit  coupled semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18549" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18549</a>
<br>
</p><i>Binayyak B. Roy, Rimika Jaiswal, Tudor D. Stanescu, Sumanta Tewari</i>
<p>We investigate theoretically a one-dimensional semiconductor-superconductor
(SM-SC) heterostructure with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and parallel Zeeman
field in the presence of disorder generated by random charged impurities and
identify the optimal regimes for realizing topological superconductivity and
Majorana zero modes. Using a Green's function approach, we show that upon
increasing the disorder strength the stable topological superconducting phase
characterized by robust end-to-end Majorana correlations ``migrates'' toward
larger values of the Zeeman field and can be stabilized by increasing the
effective SM-SC coupling. Based on these findings, we propose a strategy for
accessing a regime characterized by well-separated Majorana zero modes that is
based on (a) enhancing the strength of the effective SM-SC coupling (e.g.,
through interface engineering) and (b) expanding the range of accessible Zeeman
fields (e.g., by enhancing the gyromagnetic ratio or optimizing the parent
superconductor, to enable the application of larger magnetic fields). While
this strategy may still require some reduction of the disorder strength, this
requirement is significantly less strict than the corresponding requirement in
a strategy that focuses exclusively on disorder reduction.

<h3>Amplified entanglement witnessed in a quantum critical metal</h3>

</p><i>Yuan Fang, Mounica Mahankali, Yiming Wang, Lei Chen, Haoyu Hu, Silke Paschen, Qimiao Si</i>
<p>Strong correlations in matter promote a landscape of ground states and the
associated quantum critical points. For metallic systems, there is increasing
recognition that the quantum criticality goes beyond the standard Landau
framework and, thus, novel means are needed to characterize the quantum
critical fluid. Here we do so by studying the entanglement properties near a
quantum critical point of a strongly correlated metal. We calculate the mutual
information and quantum Fisher information of an Anderson/Kondo lattice model
across its Kondo destruction quantum critical point, with the former measuring
the bipartite entanglement between two subsystems and the latter serving as
witness for multipartite entanglement in the entire system. The mutual
information between the conduction electrons and local moments reveals a
dynamical effect of Kondo correlations across the quantum critical point.
Moreover, the quantum Fisher information of the spin degree of freedom peaks at
the quantum critical point and indicates a strongly entangled ground state. Our
work opens a new avenue to advance the understanding of metallic quantum
criticality by entanglement means in a broad range of strongly correlated
systems, and reveals a new regime of quantum matter to witness amplified
entanglement.

<h3>Probabilistic work extraction on a classical oscillator beyond the  second law</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18556" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18556</a>
<br>
</p><i>Nicolas Barros, Sergio Ciliberto, Ludovic Bellon</i>
<p>We demonstrate experimentally that, applying optimal protocols which drive
the system between two equilibrium states characterized by a free energy
difference $\Delta F$, we can maximize the probability of performing the
transition between the two states with a work $W$ smaller than $\Delta F$. The
second law holds only on average, resulting in the inequality $\langle W
\rangle \geq \Delta F$. The experiment is performed using an underdamped
oscillator evolving in a double-well potential. We show that with a suitable
choice of parameters the probability of obtaining trajectories with $W \le
\Delta F$ can be larger than 90 %. Very fast protocols are a key feature to
obtain these results which are explained in terms of the Jarzynski equality.

<h3>Transient dynamical phase diagram of the spin-boson model</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Olga Goulko, Hsing-Ta Chen, Moshe Goldstein, Guy Cohen</i>
<p>We investigate the real-time dynamics of the sub-Ohmic spin-boson model
across a broad range of coupling strengths, using the numerically exact
inchworm quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. From short- and intermediate-time
dynamics starting from an initially decoupled state, we extract signatures of
the zero-temperature quantum phase transition between localized and delocalized
states. We show that the dynamical phase diagram thus obtained differs from the
equilibrium phase diagram in both the values of critical couplings and the
associated critical exponents. We also identify and quantitatively analyze two
competing mechanisms for the crossover between coherent oscillations and
incoherent decay. Deep in the sub-Ohmic regime, the crossover is driven by the
damping of the oscillation amplitude, while closer to the Ohmic regime the
oscillation frequency itself drops sharply to zero at large coupling.

<h3>High-Field Superconducting Halo in UTe$_2$</h3>

<p>Heavy fermion UTe$_2$ is a promising candidate for topological
superconductivity that also exhibits multiple high-field superconducting
phases. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase has only been observed in off-axis magnetic
fields in the $bc$ plane at fields greater than 40 teslas, a striking scale
given its critical temperature of only 2 kelvins. Here, we extend measurements
of this unique superconducting state outside of the $bc$ plane and reveal its
core structure. The SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase is not confined to fields in the $bc$
plane and in fact wraps around the $b$ axis in a halo-like fashion. In other
words, this superconducting state, which exists in fields above 73 teslas, is
stabilized by a field component perpendicular to the magnetic easy axis. These
remarkable field scales further underscore UTe$_2$'s unique magnetophilic
superconducting tendencies and suggest an underlying pairing mechanism that is
qualitatively distinct from known theories for field-enhanced
superconductivity. Phenomenological modeling points to a two-component,
non-unitary spin triplet order parameter with finite orbital momentum of the
Cooper pairs as a natural explanation for the field-angle dependence of the
upper critical field of the SC$_{\rm{FP}}$ phase.
