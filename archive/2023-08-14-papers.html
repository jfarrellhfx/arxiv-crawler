<h3>Active nematics with deformable particles</h3>

The hydrodynamic theory of active nematics has been often used to describe
the spatio-temporal dynamics of cell flows and motile topological defects
within soft confluent tissues. Those theories, however, often rely on the
assumption that tissues consist of cells with a fixed, anisotropic shape and do
not resolve dynamical cell shape changes due to flow gradients. In this paper
we extend the continuum theory of active nematics to include cell shape
deformability. We find that circular cells in tissues must generate sufficient
active stress to overcome an elastic barrier to deforming their shape in order
to drive tissue-scale flows. Above this threshold the systems enter a dynamical
steady-state with regions of elongated cells and strong flows coexisting with
quiescent regions of isotropic cells.

<h3>Two-dimensional electron hydrodynamics in an obstacle array:  Magnetoresistivity, Hall viscosity, and the Landauer dipole</h3>

We formulate a general framework to study flow of the electron liquid in two
dimensions past a random array of impenetrable obstacles in the presence of a
magnetic field. We derive a linear-response formula for the resistivity tensor
$\hat\rho$ in hydrodynamics with obstacles, which expresses $\hat\rho$ in terms
of the vorticity and its harmonic conjugate, both on the boundary of obstacles.
In the limit of rare obstacles, in which we calculate $\hat\rho$, the
contributions of the flow-induced electric field to the dissipative resistivity
from the area covered by the liquid and the area inside obstacles are shown to
be equal to each other. We demonstrate that the averaged electric fields
outside and inside obstacles are rotated by Hall viscosity from the direction
of flow. For the diffusive boundary condition on the obstacles, this effect
exactly cancels in $\hat\rho$. By contrast, for the specular boundary
condition, the total electric field is rotated by Hall viscosity, which means
the emergence of a Hall-viscosity-induced effective -- proportional to the
obstacle density -- magnetic field. Its effect on the Hall resistivity is
particularly notable in that it leads to a deviation of the Hall constant from
its universal value. We show that the applied magnetic field enhances
hydrodynamic lubrication, giving rise to a strong negative magnetoresistance.
We combine the hydrodynamic and electrostatic perspectives by discussing the
distribution of charges that create the flow-induced electric field around
obstacles. We provide a connection between the tensor $\hat\rho$ and the
disorder-averaged electric dipole induced by viscosity at the obstacle. This
establishes a conceptual link between the resistivity in hydrodynamics with
obstacles and the notion of the Landauer dipole. We show that the
viscosity-induced dipole is rotated from the direction of flow by Hall
viscosity.

<h3>Interlayer interaction, shear vibrational mode, and tribological  properties of two-dimensional bilayers with a commensurate moiré pattern</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06302" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06302</a>

<br>
<br>
The potential energy surface (PES) of interlayer interaction of infinite
twisted bilayer graphene is calculated for a set of commensurate moir\'e
patterns using the registry-dependent Kolmogorov-Crespi empirical potential.
The calculated PESs have the same shape for all considered moir\'e patterns
with the unit cell size of the PES which is inversely related to the unit cell
size of the moir\'e pattern. The amplitude of PES corrugations is found to
decrease exponentially upon increasing the size of the moir\'e pattern unit
cell. An analytical expression for such a PES including the first Fourier
harmonics compatible with the symmetries of both layers is derived. It is shown
that the calculated PESs can be approximated by the derived expression with the
accuracy within 1%. This means that different physical properties associated
with relative in-plane motion of graphene layers are interrelated and can be
expressed analytically as functions of the amplitude of PES corrugations. In
this way, we obtain the shear mode frequency, shear modulus, shear strength and
barrier for relative rotation of the commensurate twisted layers to a fully
incommensurate state for the considered moir\'e patterns. This barrier may
possibly lead to the macroscopic robust superlubricity for twisted graphene
bilayer with a commensurate moir\'e pattern. The conclusions made should be
valid for diverse 2D systems of twisted commensurate layers.

<h3>Information Arbitrage in Bipartite Heat Engines</h3>

Heat engines and information engines have each historically served as
motivating examples for the development of thermodynamics. While these two
types of systems are typically thought of as two separate kinds of machines,
recent empirical studies of specific systems have hinted at possible
connections between the two. Inspired by molecular machines in the cellular
environment, which in many cases have separate components in contact with
distinct sources of fluctuations, we study bipartite heat engines. We show that
a bipartite heat engine can only produce net output work by acting as an
information engine. Conversely, information engines can only extract more work
than the work consumed to power them if they have access to different sources
of fluctuations, i.e., act as heat engines. We illustrate these findings first
through an analogy to economics and a cyclically controlled 2D ideal gas. We
then explore two analytically tractable model systems in more detail: a
Brownian-gyrator heat engine which we show can be reinterpreted as a
feedback-cooling information engine, and a quantum-dot information engine which
can be reinterpreted as a thermoelectric heat engine. Our results suggest
design principles for both heat engines and information engines at the
nanoscale, and ultimately imply constraints on how free-energy transduction is
carried out in biological molecular machines.

Water is an ubiquitous liquid that has several exotic and anomalous
properties. Despite its apparent simple chemical formula, its capability of
forming a dynamic network of hydrogen bonds leads to a rich variety of physics.
Here we study the vibrations of water using molecular dynamics simulations,
mainly concentrating on the Raman and infrared spectroscopic signatures. We
investigate the consequences of the temperature on the vibrational frequencies,
and we enter the details of the hydrogen bonding coordination by using
restrained simulations in order to gain quantitative insight on the dependence
of the frequencies on the neighbouring molecules. Further we consider the
differences due to the different methods of solving the electronic structure to
evaluate the forces on the ions, and report results on the angular
correlations, isotopic mixtures HOD in H$_2$O/D$_2$O and and the dielectric
constants in water.

<h3>An ab initio study of the static, dynamic and electronic properties of  some liquid 5d transition metals near melting</h3>

We report a study on the static and dynamic properties of several liquid 5$d$
transition metals at thermodynamic conditions near their respective melting
points. This is performed by resorting to ab initio molecular dynamics
simulations in the framework of the density functional theory. Results are
presented for the static structure factors and pair distribution functions;
moreover, the local short range order in the liquid metal is also analized. As
for the dynamical properties, both single-particle and collective properties
are evaluated. The dynamical structure shows the propagating density
fluctuations, and the respective dispersion relation is obtained. Results are
also obtained for the longitudinal and transverse current spectral functions
along with the associated dispersion of collective excitations. For some
metals, we found the existence of two branches of transverse collective
excitations in the region around the main peak of the structure factor.
Finally, several transport coefficients are also calculated.

<h3>Proportional correlation between heat capacity and thermal expansion of  atomic, molecular crystals and carbon nanostructures</h3>

Correlation between thermal expansions $\beta(T)$ and heat capacity $C(T)$ of
atomic and molecular crystals, amorphous materials with a structural disorder,
carbon nanomaterials (fullerite C$_{60}$, bundles SWCNTs of single-walled
carbon nanotubes) was analyzed. The influence of the contribution to the
coefficient of linear thermal expansion $\alpha_\textrm{Xe}(T)$ of Xe atoms
adsorbed on the SWCNTs bundles is considered. The proportional correlation was
found between the contribution to the coefficient of linear thermal expansion
$\alpha_\textrm{Xe}(T)$ and the normalized to the gas constant heat capacity
$C_\textrm{Xe}(T)/R$ of Xe atoms adsorbed on the SWCNTs bundles. The
proportional correlation $(\beta/\beta^*) \sim (C_\textrm{V}/R)$ with the
parameter $\beta^*$ for the bulk thermal expansion coefficient for cryocrystals
is proposed. In the case of atomic crystals such as Xe and Ar, the proportional
correlation $(\beta/\beta^*) \sim (C_\textrm{V}/R)$ is observed in the
temperature range from the lowest experimental to temperatures where
$C_\textrm{V}/R \approx 2.3$. The correlation is not observed in the
temperatures where $2.3<C_V/R<3$ (classical Dulong-Petit law). It was found
that the universal proportional correlation is also observed for molecular
crystals with linear symmetry, such as CO$_{2}$, CO, and N$_{2}$O if the
normalized heat capacity below the values $C_\textrm{V}/R \approx 3 \div 3.5$.

<h3>Statistical Material Law Support for Room Temperature Superconductivity  in the Lead Apatite System</h3>

Quantum mechanics calculations of an electronic orbital coupling distribution
of the new possible Room Temperature (RT) system of lead apatite Pb10(PO4)6O
system show that the complex orbital coupling characteristics of the new system
are similar to those of copper oxide and with multiple orbital interactions.
The overall bandwidth is significantly larger than the current largest copper
oxide system, which can also be compared to near RT high-pressure hydride
systems. By applying a material dependence law relating overall bandwidth to
superconducting critical temperature across various typical superconducting
systems, we predict that the electronic structure of the new material can
support achieving RT superconductivity in the condition of a flatter band.

<h3>On the existence of a second branch of transverse collective excitations  in liquid metals</h3>

<br>
It was found recently that the liquid dynamics of several metals (Li, Zn, Ni,
Fe, Tl, Pb) under pressure is characterized by transverse spectral functions
containing an additional high-frequency peak. To rationalize the pressure
dependence of the contributions from different propagating processes to
transverse spectral functions in liquid metals, ab initio molecular dynamics
simulations were performed for two typical liquid metals (Na and Al) in a wide
range of pressures. The influence of density/pressure is investigated for Na by
considering four pressures ranging from 15 to 147 GPa, while the temperature
influence is considered for Al between 600 K in the deep supercooled liquid up
to 1700 K well above the melting point at ambient pressure. Both temperature
and density dependence of the spectra of collective excitations are analyzed
with a focus on the appearance of a second high-frequency mode in the
transverse spectra. A correspondence between spectra of transverse collective
excitations and the peak positions of the Fourier-spectra of velocity
autocorrelation functions (vibrational density of states) is found.

<br>
<br>
We explore some aspects of the microscopic structure of curcumin solutions
with water-dimethylsulfoxide solvent of variable composition. Molecular
dynamics computer simulations at isobaric-isothermal conditions are used for
this purpose. The model consists of the OPLS-UA type model for the enol
conformer of curcumin (J. Mol. Liq., 223, 707, 2016), the OPLS model for the
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and the SPC/E water model. Radial distributions for
the centers of mass of curcumin molecules are evaluated and the corresponding
running coordination numbers are analyzed. The disaggregation of curcumin
clusters upon increasing the DMSO content in water-DMSO solvent is elucidated.
Changes of the distribution of water and DMSO species around curcumin molecules
are investigated. A qualitative comparison of our findings with the results of
other authors is performed. A possibility to relate predictions of the model
with the experimental observations in terms of the so-called critical
wateraggregation percentage is discussed.

<h3>Physics inspired quantum simulation of resonating valence bond states --  a prototypical template for a spin-liquid ground state</h3>

Spin-liquids -- an emergent, exotic collective phase of matter -- have
garnered enormous attention in recent years. While experimentally, many
prospective candidates have been proposed and realized, theoretically modeling
real materials that display such behavior may pose serious challenges due to
the inherently high correlation content of emergent phases. Over the last few
decades, the second-quantum revolution has been the harbinger of a novel
computational paradigm capable of initiating a foundational evolution in
computational physics. In this report, we strive to use the power of the latter
to study a prototypical model -- a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$-unit cell of a Kagome
anti-ferromagnet. Extended lattices of such unit cells are known to possess a
magnetically disordered spin-liquid ground state. We employ robust classical
numerical techniques like Density-Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) to
identify the nature of the ground state through a matrix-product state (MPS)
formulation. We subsequently use the gained insight to construct an auxillary
hamiltonian with reduced measurables and also design an ansatz that is modular
and gate efficient. With robust error-mitigation strategies, we are able to
demonstrate that the said ansatz is capable of accurately representing the
target ground state even on a real IBMQ backend within $1\%$ accuracy in
energy. Since the protocol is linearly scaling $O(n)$ in the number of unit
cells, gate requirements, and the number of measurements, it is
straightforwardly extendable to larger Kagome lattices which can pave the way
for efficient construction of spin-liquid ground states on a quantum device.

Excitons -- bound electron-hole pairs -- play a central role in light-matter
interaction phenomena, and are crucial for wide-ranging applications from light
harvesting and generation to quantum information processing. A long-standing
challenge in solid-state optics has been to achieve precise and scalable
control over the quantum mechanical state of excitons in semiconductor
heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate a technique for creating tailored and
tunable potential landscapes for optically active excitons in 2D semiconductors
that enables in-situ wavefunction shaping at the nanoscopic lengthscale. Using
nanostructured gate electrodes, we create localized electrostatic traps for
excitons in diverse geometries such as quantum dots and rings, and arrays
thereof. We show independent spectral tuning of multiple spatially separated
quantum dots, which allows us to bring them to degeneracy despite material
disorder. Owing to the strong light-matter coupling of excitons in 2D
semiconductors, we observe unambiguous signatures of confined exciton
wavefunctions in optical reflection and photoluminescence measurements. Our
work introduces a new approach to engineering exciton dynamics and interactions
at the nanometer scale, with implications for novel optoelectronic devices,
topological photonics, and many-body quantum nonlinear optics.

<h3>Transcending the MAX phases concept of nanolaminated early transition  metal carbides/nitrides -- the ZIA phases</h3>

<br>
<br>
A new potential class of nanolaminated and structurally complex materials,
herein conceived as the Zigzag IntermetAllic (ZIA) phases, is proposed. A study
of the constituent phases of a specific Nb--Si--Ni intermetallic alloy revealed
that its ternary H-phase, \textit{i.e.}, the Nb$_3$SiNi$_2$ intermetallic
compound (IMC), is a crystalline solid with the close-packed \textit{fcc}
Bravais lattice, the 312 MAX phase stoichiometry and a layered atomic
arrangement that may define an entire class of nanolaminated IMCs analogous to
the nanolaminated ceramic compounds known today as the MAX phases. The electron
microscopy investigation of the Nb$_{3}$SiNi$_{2}$ compound -- the first
candidate ZIA phase -- revealed a remarkable structural complexity, as its
ordered unit cell is made of 96 atoms. The ZIA phases extend the concept of
nanolaminated crystalline solids well beyond the MAX phases family of early
transition metal carbides/nitrides, most likely broadening the spectrum of
achievable material properties into domains typically not covered by the MAX
phases. Furthermore, this work uncovers that both families of nanolaminated
crystalline solids, \textit{i.e.}, the herein introduced \textit{fcc} ZIA
phases and all known variants of the \textit{hcp} MAX phases, obey the same
overarching stoichiometric rule $P_{x+y}A_xN_y$, where $x$ and $y$ are integers
ranging from 1 to 6.

<h3>A first-principles study of bilayer 1T'-WTe2/CrI3: A candidate  topological spin filter</h3>

The ability to manipulate electronic spin channels in 2D materials is crucial
for realizing next-generation spintronics. Spin filters are spintronic
components that polarize spins using external electromagnetic fields or
intrinsic material properties like magnetism. Recently, topological protection
from backscattering has emerged as an enticing feature through which the
robustness of 2D spin filters might be enhanced. In this work, we propose and
then characterize one of the first 2D topological spin filters: bilayer
CrI3/1T'-WTe2. To do so, we use a combination of Density Functional Theory and
maximally localized Wannier functions to demonstrate that the bilayer (BL)
satisfies the principal criteria for being a topological spin filter; namely
that it is gapless, exhibits charge transfer from WTe2 to CrI3 that renders the
BL metallic despite the CrI3 retaining its monolayer ferromagnetism, and does
not retain the topological character of monolayer 1T'-WTe2. In particular, we
observe that the atomic magnetic moments on Cr from DFT are approximately 3.2
mB/Cr in the BL compared to 2.9 mB/Cr with small negative ferromagnetic (FM)
moments induced on the W atoms in freestanding monolayer CrI3. Subtracting the
charge and spin densities of the constituent monolayers from those of the BL
further reveals spin-polarized charge transfer from WTe2 to CrI3. We find that
the BL is topologically trivial by showing that its Chern number is zero.
Altogether, this evidence indicates that BL 1T'-WTe2/CrI3 is gapless, magnetic,
and topologically trivial, meaning that a terraced WTe2/CrI3 BL heterostructure
in which only a portion of a WTe2 monolayer is topped with CrI3 is a promising
candidate for a 2D topological spin filter. Our results further suggest that 1D
chiral edge states may be realized by stacking strongly hybridized FM
monolayers, like CrI3, atop 2D nonmagnetic Weyl semimetals like 1T'-WTe2.

The existence of a crumpled phase for self-avoiding elastic surfaces was
postulated more than three decades ago using simple Flory-like scaling
arguments. Despite much effort, its stability in a microscopic environment has
been the subject of much debate. In this Letter we show how a crumpled phase
develops reliably and consistently upon subjecting a thin spherical shell to
active fluctuations. We find a master curve describing how the relative volume
of a shell changes with the strength of the active forces, that applies for
every shell independent of size and elastic constants. Furthermore, we extract
a general expression for the onset active force beyond which a shell begins to
crumple. Finally, we calculate how the size exponent varies along the crumpling
curve.

<h3>Modulating the electrochemical intercalation of graphene interfaces with  $α$-RuCl$_3$ as a solid-state electron acceptor</h3>

Intercalation reactions modify the charge density in van der Waals (vdW)
materials through coupled electronic-ionic charge accumulation, and are
susceptible to modulation by interlayer hybridization in vdW heterostructures.
Here, we demonstrate that charge transfer between graphene and
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, which dopes the graphene positively, greatly favors the
intercalation of lithium ions into graphene-based vdW heterostructures. We
systematically tune this effect on Li$^+$ ion intercalation, modulating the
intercalation potential, by using varying thicknesses of hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN) as spacer layers between graphene and $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Confocal
Raman spectroscopy and electronic transport measurements are used to monitor
electrochemical intercalation and density functional theory computations help
quantify charge transfer to both $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and graphene upon Li
intercalation. This work demonstrates a versatile approach for systematically
modulating the electrochemical intercalation behavior of two-dimensional layers
akin to electron donating/withdrawing substituent effects used to tune
molecular redox potentials.

<h3>Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation for an interacting mobile impurity</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this work we study the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) relation in the
Yang-Gaudin model of an interacting mobile impurity. We use the integrability
of the model to compute the dynamic injection and ejection Green's functions at
finite temperatures. We show that due to separability of the Hilbert space with
an impurity, the ejection Green's in a canonical ensemble cannot be reduced to
a single expectation value as per microcanonical picture. Instead, it involves
a thermal average over contributions from different subspaces of the Hilbert
space which, due to the integrability, are resolved using the so-called spin
rapidity. It is then natural to consider the injection and ejection Green's
functions within each subspace. We rigorously prove by reformulating the
refined KMS condition as a Riemann-Hilbert problem, and then we verify
numerically, that such Green's functions obey a refined KMS relation from which
the original one naturally follows.

<h3>Polar discontinuities and interfacial electronic properties of  Bi$_2$O$_2$Se on SrTiO$_3$</h3>

The layered oxychalcogenide semiconductor Bi$_2$O$_2$Se (BOS) hosts a
multitude of unusual properties including high electron mobility. Owing to
similar crystal symmetry and lattice constants, the perovskite oxide SrTiO$_3$
(STO) has been demonstrated to be an excellent substrate for wafer-scale growth
of atomically thin BOS films. However, the structural and electronic properties
of the BOS/STO interface remain poorly understood. Here, through
first-principles study, we reveal that polar discontinuities and interfacial
contact configurations have a strong impact on the electronic properties of
ideal BOS/STO interfaces. The lowest-energy [Bi-TiO$_2$] contact type, which
features the contact between a Bi$_2$O$_2$ layer of BOS with the
TiO$_2$-terminated surface of STO, incurs significant interfacial charge
transfer from BOS to STO, producing a BOS/STO-mixed, $n$-type metallic state at
the interface. By contrast, the [Se-SrO] contact type, which is the most stable
contact configuration between BOS and SrO-terminated STO substrate, has a much
smaller interfacial charge transfer from STO to BOS and exhibits $p$-type
electronic structure with much weaker interfacial hybridization between BOS and
STO. These results indicate that BOS grown on TiO$_2$-terminated STO substrates
could be a fruitful system for exploring emergent phenomena at the interface
between an oxychalcogenide and an oxide, whereas BOS grown on SrO-terminated
substrates may be more advantageous for preserving the excellent intrinsic
transport properties of BOS.

renormalization group, we compute the magnetic, density, and superconducting
susceptibilities of the two-dimensional Hubbard model at weak coupling and
present a detailed analysis of their evolution with temperature, interaction
strength, and loop order. By breaking down the susceptibilities into
contributions from the bare susceptibility and the individual channels, we
investigate their relative importance as well as the channel interplay. In
particular, we trace the influence of antiferromagnetic fluctuations on the
$d$-wave superconductivity and provide an analytical understanding for the
observed behavior.

4H silicon carbide (SiC) polytype is preferred over other SiC polytypes for
high-power, high-voltage, and high-frequency applications due to its superior
electrical, thermal, and structural characteristics. In this manuscript, we
provide a comprehensive study of the spin coupling dynamic between conduction
electrons and nitrogen (N) donors in monocrystalline 4H SiC with various
concentrations of uncompensated N donors from 10^17 cm^-3 to 5x10^19 cm^-3 by
continuous wave, pulsed EPR, and microwave perturbation techniques at T=4.2-300
K. At low temperatures two triplets due to N donors in cubic (Nk) hexagonal
(Nh) positions and triplet arisen from spin-interaction between Nh and Nk were
observed in 4H SiC having Nd-Na=10^17 cm^-3. A single S-line (S=1/2) dominates
the EPR spectra in all investigated 4H SiC monocrystals at high temperatures.
It was established that this line occurs due to the exchange coupling of
localized electrons (dominate at low temperatures) and non-localized electrons
(dominate at high temperatures). The localized electrons were attributed to Nh
for Nd-Na=10^17 cm^-3 and Nk donors for Nd-Na>=5x10^18 cm^-3. We have concluded
that the conduction electrons in 4H SiC monocrystals are characterized by
gpar=2.0053(3) gper=2.0011(3) for Nd-Na<=5x10^18 cm^-3 and gpar=2.0057(3) and
gper=2.0019(3) for Nd-Na=5x10^19 cm^-3. Using the theoretical fitting of the
temperature variation of S-line EPR linewidth in 4H SiC having Nd-Na<5x10^18
cm-^3, the energy levels of 57-65 meV that correlate with the valley-orbit
splitting values for Nk donors in 4H SiC monocrystals were obtained.

<br>
<br>
Challenges associated with in-service mechanical degradation of Li-ion
battery cathodes has prompted a transition from polycrystalline to single
crystal cathode materials. Whilst for single crystal materials,
dislocation-assisted crack formation is assumed to be the dominating failure
mechanism throughout battery life, there is little direct information about
their mechanical behaviour, and mechanistic understanding remains elusive.
Here, we demonstrated, using in situ micromechanical testing, direct
measurement of local mechanical properties within LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 single
crystalline domains. We elucidated the dislocation slip systems, their critical
stresses, and how slip facilitate cracking. We then compared single crystal and
polycrystal deformation behaviour. Our findings answer two fundamental
questions critical to understanding cathode degradation: What dislocation slip
systems operate in Ni-rich cathode materials? And how does slip cause fracture?
This knowledge unlocks our ability to develop tools for lifetime prediction and
failure risk assessment, as well as in designing novel cathode materials with
increased toughness in-service.

<br>
<br>
We study two non-Markovian gene-expression models in which protein production
is a stochastic process with a fat-tailed non-exponential distribution of
waiting times. For both models, we find two distinct scaling regimes separated
by an exponentially long time, proportional to the mean first passage time
(MFPT) to a ground state of the dynamics, from which the system can only exit
via a non-exponential reaction. At times shorter than the MFPT the dynamics are
stationary and ergodic while at times longer than the MFPT the dynamics are
nonstationary and nonergodic. The MFPT to the ground state is shown to directly
affect the average population sizes and we postulate that the transition to
nonergodicity is a universal feature of models with a non-Markovian state.

<br>
<br>
The mechanical properties of layered, hexagonal-structured MAX phases often
show the combined merits of metals and ceramics, making them promising material
candidates for safety critical applications. While their unique mechanical
performance largely arises from the crystal structure, the effect of chemistry
on the properties of these materials remains unclear. To study this, here we
employed two in situ electron microscope small scale testing approaches to
examine the micromechanical properties of Zr3AlC2, and compared the results
with the properties of Ti3SiC2: we used micropillar compression tests to
measure basal slip strength, and double cantilever beam splitting tests to
evaluate fracture energy for basal plane delamination. We observed distinct and
systematic differences in these measured properties between Zr3AlC2 and
Ti3SiC2, where Zr3AlC2 appeared to be stronger but more brittle at the
microscale, and discussed the implications of the results in the selection,
design, and engineering of MAX phases for targeted engineering applications.

<h3>Unveiling Correlated Topological Insulators through Fermionic Tensor  Network States -- Classification, Edge Theories and Variational Wavefunctions</h3>

<br>
<br>
The study of topological band insulators has revealed fascinating phases
characterized by band topology indices, harboring extraordinary boundary modes
protected by anomalous symmetry actions. In strongly correlated systems, where
the traditional notion of electronic bands becomes obsolete, it has been
established that topological insulator phases persist as stable phases,
separate from trivial insulators. However, due to the inability to express the
ground states of such systems as Slater determinants, the formulation of
generic variational wavefunctions for numerical simulations is highly
desirable. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by developing a
comprehensive framework for fermionic tensor network states. Starting from
simple assumptions, we obtain possible sets of tensor equations for any given
symmetry group, capturing consistent relations governing symmetry
transformation rules on tensor legs. We then examine the connections between
these tensor equations and topological insulators by construing edge theories
and extracting quantum anomaly data from each set of tensor equations. By
exhaustively exploring all possible sets of equations, we achieve a systematic
classification of topological insulator phases. Imposing the solutions of a
given set of equations onto local tensors, we obtain generic variational
wavefunctions for corresponding topological insulator phases. Our methodology
provides a crucial first step towards simulating topological insulators in
strongly correlated systems. We discuss the limitations and potential
generalizations of our results, paving the way for further advancements in this
field.

Driven-dissipative protocols are proposed to control and create nontrivial
quantum many-body correlated states. Protocols conserving the number of
particles stand apart. As well-known, in quantum systems with the unitary
dynamics the particle number conservation and random scattering yield diffusive
behavior of two-particle excitations (diffusons and cooperons). Existence of
diffusive modes in the particle-number-conserving dissipative dynamics is not
well studied yet. We explicitly demonstrate the existence of diffusons in a
paradigmatic model of a two-band system, with dissipative dynamics aiming to
empty one fermion band and to populate the other one. The studied model is
generalization of the model introduced in F. Tonielli, J. C. Budich, A.
Altland, and S. Diehl, Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 240404 (2020). We find how the
diffusion coefficient depends on details of a model and the rate of
dissipation. We discuss how the existence of diffusive modes complicates
engineering of macroscopic many-body correlated states.

<h3>Measurement-induced integer families of critical dynamical scaling in  quantum many-body systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Zuo Wang, Shi-Liang Zhu, Li-Jun Lang, Liang He</i>
<br>
<br>
A quantum many-body system can undergo transitions in the presence of
continuous measurement. In this work, we find that a generic class of critical
dynamical scaling behavior can emerge at these measurement-induced transitions.
Remarkably, depending on the symmetry that can be respected by the system,
different integer families of dynamical scaling can emerge. The origin of these
scaling families can be traced back to the presence of hierarchies of high
order exceptional points in the effective non-Hermitian descriptions of the
systems. Direct experimental observation of this class of dynamical scaling
behavior can be readily achieved using ultracold atoms in optical lattices or
through intermediate-scale quantum computing systems.

<br>
<br>
We experimentally investigate the clogging process of granular materials in a
two-dimensional hopper, and present a self-consistent physical mechanism of
clogging based on preformed dynamic chain structures in the flow. We found that
these chain structures follow a specific modified restricted random walk, and
clogging occurs when they are mechanically stable enough to withstand the flow
fluctuations, resulting in the formation of an arch at the outlet. We introduce
a simple model which can explain the clogging probability by incorporating an
analytical expression for chain formation and its transition into an arch. Our
results provide insight into the microscopic mechanism of clogging in hopper
flow.

The desire to create an energy efficient world is bound to be incomplete
without the discovery of a room temperature superconductor at ambient pressure.
A recent report on the room-temperature ambient-pressure superconductor has
inspired scientists to study the Cu doped Lead apatite named as LK-99. Here, we
have synthesized Cu doped LK-99 and Ni-doped LK-99 compounds and studied their
temperature dependent transport and magnetization behavior. In spite of the
presence of impurity phase Cu$_2$S, the temperature dependent resistance shows
an insulating nature of the sample. The radio frequency penetration depth
measurement unveils the absence of diamagnetic flux expulsion in this sample.
The temperature dependent ac susceptibility measurements reveal the
paramagnetic nature of the Ni doped LK-99.

Doniach phase diagram of heavy fermions with Ce and Eu ions is explained by
the scaling solution of the Anderson model. At high temperatures, where the
rear earth ions behave as nearly independent local moments (LM) the system has
a large paramagnetic entropy and its properties are defined by Kondo
temperature, $T_K(p)$, where $p$ is the external parameter, like pressure or
doping. For a given $T_K(p)$, the scaling law allows an estimate of the
pressure or doping dependence of the coupling constant which is then used to
find the dependence of the RKKY temperature $T_{RKKY}(p)$ and N\'eel
temperature $T_N(p)$ on the control parameter. The competition between the
on-site Kondo coupling and the off-site RKKY coupling determines the mechanism
by which the system removes the paramagnetic entropy at low temperatures. The
pressure-induced change of the ground state is explained by the differences in
the functional form of $T_K(p)$ and $T_{RKKY}(p)$. Our theoretical results
capture the main features shown by the Doniach diagram of CeRu$_2$Ge$_2$,
CeCu$_2$(Ge$_{1-x}$Si$_{x})_2$ or EuCu$_2$(Ge$_{1-x}$Si$_{x})_2$.

In this paper we consider the possibility and conditions for pair
photoemission whereby two incident photons emit pairs of electrons from a
candidate material as a novel method to measure and visualize electronic
correlations. As opposed to double photoemission - where a single photon
precipitates the ejection of a pair electrons via a subsequent electron energy
loss scattering process - we show that pair photoemission need not be limited
to interference between initial photoelectrons and valence electrons, and
moreover, can occur without the energy penalty of two work functions. This
enables detection of pairs of electrons at high energy resolution that may be
correlated in the same quantum many-body states.

<h3>In-plane Hall effect in rutile oxide films induced by the Lorentz force</h3>

<br>
<br>
The conventional Hall effect is linearly proportional to the field component
or magnetization component perpendicular to a film. Despite the increasing
theoretical proposals on the Hall effect to the in-plane field or magnetization
in various special systems induced by the Berry curvature, such an
unconventional Hall effect has only been experimentally reported in Weyl
semimetals and in a heterodimensional superlattice. Here, we report an
unambiguous experimental observation of the in-plane Hall effect (IPHE) in
centrosymmetric rutile RuO2 and IrO2 single-crystal films under an in-plane
magnetic field. The measured Hall resistivity is found to be proportional to
the component of the applied in-plane magnetic field along a particular crystal
axis and to be independent of the current direction or temperature. Both the
experimental observations and theoretical calculations confirm that the IPHE in
rutile oxide films is induced by the Lorentz force. Our findings can be
generalized to ferromagnetic materials for the discovery of in-plane anomalous
Hall effects and quantum anomalous Hall effects. In addition to significantly
expanding knowledge of the Hall effect, this work opens the door to explore new
members in the Hall effect family.

<h3>Rabi oscillations and magnetization of a mobile spin-1/2 impurity in a  Fermi sea</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the behavior of a mobile spin-1/2 impurity atom immersed in a
Fermi gas, where the interacting spin-$\uparrow$ and non-interacting
spin-$\downarrow$ states of the impurity are Rabi coupled via an external
field. This scenario resembles the classic problem of a two-state system
interacting with a dissipative environment, but with an added dimension
provided by the impurity momentum degree of freedom. In this case, the impurity
can become "dressed" by excitations of the Fermi sea to form a Fermi polaron
quasiparticle. For the steady-state system, where the impurity has thermalized
with the medium, we derive exact thermodynamic relations that connect the
impurity magnetization with quasiparticle properties such as the number of
fermions in the dressing cloud. We show how the thermodynamic properties evolve
with increasing Rabi coupling and we present exact analytical results in the
limits of weak and strong Rabi coupling. For the dynamics of the Rabi-driven
Fermi polaron, we formulate a theoretical approach based on correlation
functions that respects conservation laws and allows the efficient calculation
of Rabi oscillations for a range of time scales and impurity momenta beyond
what has been achieved previously. Our results are in good agreement with
recent experiments on the Rabi oscillations of the attractive polaron, and they
reveal how the Rabi oscillations are influenced by the interplay between the
polaron and its dressing cloud.

<br>
<br>
We numerically investigate the high-efficiency photovoltaic effect in lateral
p-n homojunction based on monolayer black phosphorus (MBP) by using the
non-equilibrium Green's function combined with the density functional theory.
Due to the built-in electric field of the p-n junction and the wrinkle
structure of MBP, the photocurrent excited by either linearly or elliptically
polarized light is significantly enhanced in a wide photon energy range.
Moreover, because of the electron-photon interaction, the photocurrent is
related to atomic orbitals through the polarizing angle of polarized light.
Therefore, we can read the orbital information of the band structure from the
polarizing angular distribution of photocurrent. These findings suggest the
promising application of MBP-based p-n homojunction in high-efficiency
photoelectric devices and orbital-resolved photovoltaic detection.

The study of ground-state properties of the Fermi-Hubbard model is a
long-lasting task in the research of strongly correlated systems. Owing to the
exponentially growing complexity of the system, a quantitative analysis usually
demands high computational cost and is restricted to small samples, especially
in two or higher dimensions. Here, we introduce a variational method in the
frame of fermionic Gaussian states, and obtain the ground states of one- and
two-dimensional attractive Hubbard models via imaginary-time evolution. We
calculate the total energy and benchmark the results in a wide range of
interaction strength and filling factor with those obtained via exact two-body
results, the density matrix renormalization group based on matrix product
states (MPS), and projector Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method. For both 1D and
2D cases, the Gaussian variational method presents accurate results for total
energy with a maximum systematic error ~4% in the intermediate interaction
region. The accuracy of these results has negligible dependence on the system
size. We further calculate the double occupancy and find excellent agreement
with MPS and QMC, as well as the experimental results of cold quantum gases in
optical lattices. The results suggest that the Gaussian pairing state is a good
approximation to the ground states of attractive Hubbard model, in particular
in the strong and weak coupling limits. Moreover, we generalize the method to
the attractive Hubbard model with a finite spin-polarization, which can be
mapped to the repulsive interaction case via particle-hole transformation, and
obtain accurate results of ground state energy and double occupancy. Our work
demonstrates the ability of the Gaussian variational method to extract ground
state properties of strongly correlated many-body systems with negligible
computational cost, especially of large size and in higher dimensions.

<h3>Diamagnetic property and optical absorption in conventional  superconductors with magnetic impurities</h3>

By solving the renormalization of the $s$-$d$ interaction from magnetic
impurities embeded in conventional superconductors at low concentration, we
derive the macroscopic superconducting phase fluctuation and electromagnetic
properties within the path-integral approach. It is found that there exist two
superconducting phase modes, both exhibiting similar behaviors of the
Nambu-Goldstone mode. The existence of two phase modes suggests that in
addition to the conventional free Cooper pairs as in the BCS case, there
emerges a small part of the localized Cooper pairs around magnetic impurities
due to the quantum correlation by the $s$-$d$ interaction, acting as Josephson
islands. The emerging impurity Shiba bands inside the superconducting gap then
correspond to the excitations of the ground state of the localized Cooper
pairs, associated with the breaking of these Cooper pairs. In the diamagnetic
response, the state of the free Cooper pairs gives rise to the conventional
real contribution in the generated supercurrent, whereas the one of the
localized Cooper pairs results in an imaginary contribution, leading to the
superconducting Friedel oscillation, i.e., oscillation in the decay of the
vector potential in the Meissner effect. As for the optical absorption of a
conventional superconductor lying in the anomalous-skin-effect region, it is
found that besides the conventional interband transition of Bogoliubov
quasiparticles as revealed by Mattis-Bardeen theory, there also exist the
interband transition between the impurity Shiba bands as well as all interband
transitions between Bogoliubov quasiparticle and impurity Shiba bands. These
transitions exhibit clear and separate resonance characters, providing a
feasible scheme for the experimental detection.

<h3>Instability of the $U(1)$ spin liquid with a large spinon Fermi surface  in the Heisenberg-ring exchange model on the triangular lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06711" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06711</a>
<br>
<i>Jianhua Yang, Tao Li</i>
<br>
<br>
It is widely believed that the $U(1)$ spin liquid with a large spinon Fermi
surface(SFS state) can be realized in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ $J_{1}-J_{4}$
model on the triangular lattice, when the ring exchange coupling $J_{4}$ is
sufficiently strong to suppress the 120 degree magnetic ordered state. This
belief is supported by many variational studies on this model and seems to be
consistent with observations on the organic spin liquid materials such as
$\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$(CN)$_{3}$, a system that is close to Mott
transition and thus has large ring exchange coupling. Here we show through a
systematic variational search that such a state is never favored in the
$J_{1}-J_{4}$ model on the triangular lattice. Instead, a state with broken
spatial symmetry is favored in the most probable parameter regime for the SFS
state, with an energy much lower than that of the SFS state and other
previously proposed variational states. More specifically, we find that for
$J_{4}\ge 0.09J_{1}$, the system favors a valence bond solid state with a
$4\times6$ period in its local spin correlation pattern, with a variational
energy that is about $5\%$ lower than that of the SFS state. This state is
separated form the $\pi$-flux state for $J_{4}\le 0.045J_{1}$ by an
intermediate valence bond solid state with a zigzag pattern in its local spin
correlation. We find that the variational phase digram is in qualitative
agreement with that obtained from exact diagonalization on a $6\times6$
cluster.

Here, we report a new intrinsic magnetic topological insulator FeBi$_2$Te$_4$
based on first-principles calculations and it can achieve a rich topological
phase under pressure modulation. Without pressure, we predict that both
FeBi$_2$Te$_4$ ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orders are non-trivial
topological insulators. Furthermore, FeBi$_2$Te$_4$ of FM-z order will undergo
a series of phase transitions from topological insulator to semimetals and then
to trivial insulator under pressure. Finally, we further clarify and verify
topological phase transitions with low-energy effective model calculations.
This topological phase transition process is attributed to the synergy of the
magnetic moment and the spin-orbit coupling. The unique topological properties
of FeBi$_2$Te$_4$ will be of great interest in driving the development of
quantum effects.

Using Bethe's hypothesis, C N Yang exactly solved the one-dimensional (1D)
delta-function interacting spin-1/2 Fermi gas with an arbitrary spin-imbalance
in 1967. At that time, using a different method, M Gaudin solved the problem of
interacting fermions in a spin-balanced case. Later, the 1D delta-function
interacting fermion problem was named as the Yang-Gaudin model. It has been in
general agreed that a key discovery of C N Yang's work was the cubic matrix
equation for the solvability conditions. % This equation was later
independently found by R J Baxter for commuting transfer matrices of 2D exactly
solvable vertex models. % The equation has since been referred to Yang-Baxter
equation, being the master equation to integrability. % The Yang-Baxter
equation has been used to solve a wide range of 1D many-body problems in
physics, such as 1D Hubbard model, $SU(N)$ Fermi gases, Kondo impurity problem
and strongly correlated electronic systems etc.
% In this paper, we will briefly discuss recent developments of the
Yang-Gaudin model on several breakthroughs of many-body phenomena, ranging from
the universal thermodynamics to the Luttigner liquid, the spin charge
separation, the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO)-like pairing state and
the quantum criticality.

These developments demonstrate that the Yang-Gaudin model has laid out a
profound legacy of the Yang-Baxter equation.

The doping of lighter non-metals like boron and nitrogen into graphene
represents a promising advancement in the field of nano-electronic devices,
particularly in the development of field-effect transistors (FETs). These doped
two-dimensional (2D) materials offer improved stability and enhanced adsorption
characteristics compared to pure graphene. Notably, It displays semiconducting
behavior, resulting in higher conductivity and carrier mobility. In this study,
we investigate the structural, electronic, optical, and conductivity/carrier
transport properties of 2D polymer sheets made of fullerene, both with and
without boron and nitrogen doping. We employ density functional theory (DFT)
with PBE and HSE functionals, considering the inclusion of van der Waals (vdW)
interactions. The research findings indicate that the 2D sheets of C60,
C58B1N1, and C54B3N3 exhibit band gaps of approximately 0.97 eV (1.5 eV), 1.08
eV (1.9 eV), and 1.05 eV (1.6 eV), respectively, as obtained from PBE (HSE)
calculations. Moreover, according to the deformation potential theory, both
doped sheets exhibit ultra-high conductivity at elevated temperature). These
results are highly promising and underscore the significance of a single pair
of BN dopants in fullerene (C58B1N1) monolayers for the advancement of
next-generation 2D nanoelectronic and photonics applications.

Transition metal oxides (TMOs) exhibit a broad spectrum of electronic,
magnetic, and optical properties, making them intriguing materials for various
technological applications. Soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is widely
used to study TMOs, shedding light on their chemical state, electronic
structure, orbital polarization, element-specific magnetism, and more.
Different XAS acquisition modes feature different information depth regimes in
the sample. Here, we employ two XAS acquisition modes, having surface-sensitive
versus bulk probing depths, on the prototypical TMO SrVO3. We illustrate and
elucidate a strong apparent discrepancy between the different modes,
emphasizing the impact of the near-surface region on the interpretation of XAS
data. These findings highlight the importance of the acquisition mode selection
in XAS analysis. Moreover, the results highlight the role of the near-surface
region not only in the characterization of TMOs, but also in the design of
future nanoscale oxide electronics.

The electric double layer is an important structure that appears at charged
liquid interfaces, and it determines the performance of various electrochemical
devices such as supercapacitors and electrokinetic energy converters. Here the
double-layer capacitance of the interface between aluminum electrodes and
water/1-propanol electrolyte solutions is investigated using electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy. The double-layer capacitances of mixture solvents are
almost the same as those of water-only electrolyte solutions, and the
double-layer capacitance of 1-propanol-only solutions are significantly smaller
than those of other volume fractions of water. The qualitative variation of the
double-layer capacitances with the water volume fraction is independent of the
electrolyte types and their concentrations. Therefore, these results can be
explained by ubiquitous preferential water adsorption caused by the
hydrophilicity of the electrode surface.

A long excitation coil piercing a superconducting (SC) ring is used to
generate ever increasing persistent current in the ring, until the current
destroys the order parameter. Given that the penetration depth $\lambda$ is
known, this experiment measures, hypothetically, the coherence length $\xi$,
hence the name "Xiometer". We examine various aspects of this theoretically
driven hypothesis by testing niobium rings with different dimensions, and by
comparing the results to the known values of $\xi$. We then apply the method to
two La$_{1.875}$Sr$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$ rings at $T \rightarrow 0$. In one, the
current flows in the CuO$_2$ planes hence it is set by $\xi_{ab}$. In the
other, the current must cross planes and is determined by $\xi_{c}$. We find
that $\xi_{c}=1.3 \pm 0.1$~nm, and $\xi_{ab}<2.3~$nm indicating that at low
temperatures the Cooper pairs are three dimensional.

We propose and analyze a laser-driven protocol to generate long-range ordered
patterns in paramagnets, based on non-adiabatically driven aggregation
dynamics. We derive the optimal driving parameters that maximize, respectively,
the correlation length or the size of defect-free antiferromagnetic clusters in
a one-dimensional chain. We show that one can reach correlation lengths that
are exponentially larger than those achieved by adiabatic pumping schemes. The
resonantly driven dynamics of cluster fronts is shown to map to an exactly
solvable model of free fermions.

<h3>Anisotropic Rashba splitting dominated by out-of-plane spin polarization  in two-dimensional Janus $XA_{2}Y$ ($A$= Si, Sn, Ge; $X,Y$= Sb, Bi) with  surface imperfection</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The anisotropic Rashba effect allows for the manipulation of electron spins
in a more precise and tunable manner since the magnitude of the Rashba
splitting and orientation of the spin textures can be simply controlled by
tuning the direction of the externally applied electric field. Herein, we
predict the emergence of the anisotropic Rashba effect in the two-dimensional
(2D) Janus $XA_{2}Y$ constructed from the group IV ($A$= Si, Sn, Ge) and group
V ($X,Y$ = Sb, Bi) elements having trigonal prismatic structures but lacking
in-plane mirror symmetry. Due to the lowering point group symmetry of the
crystal, the Rashba spin splitting is enforced to becomes anisotropic around
certain high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone and preserves the
out-of-plane spin textures. We illustrate this behavior using density
functional theory calculations supplemented with $\vec{k}\cdot\vec{p}$ analysis
on the Janus SbSi$_{2}$Bi monolayer as a representative example. Specifically,
we observed large and anisotropic Rashba splitting with prominence contribution
of the out-of-plane spin textures in the conduction band minimum around the $M$
point and valence band maximum around the $\Gamma$ point. More importantly, the
anisotropic spin splitting and out-of-plane spin polarization are sensitively
affected by surface imperfections, depending on the concentration and
configuration of the $X$ and $Y$ elements in the 2D Janus $XA_{2}Y$ surface.
Our study offer the possibility to realize the present systems for spintronics
applications.

<h3>High Temperature Superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h3>

<br>
<i>Kun Jiang, Ziqiang Wang, Fu-Chun Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in
bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, we study its electronic properties
and superconductivity due to strong electron correlation. Using the inversion
symmetry, we decouple the low-energy electronic structure into block-diagonal
symmetric and antisymmetric sectors. We find that the antisymmetric sector can
be reduced to a one-band system near half filling, while the symmetric bands
occupied by about two electrons are heavily overdoped individually. Using the
strong coupling mean field theory, we obtain strong superconducting pairing
with $B_{1g}$ symmetry in the antisymmetric sector. We propose that due to the
spin-orbital exchange coupling between the two sectors, $B_{1g}$ pairing is
induced in the symmetric bands, which in-turn boosts the pairing gap in the
antisymmetric band and enhances the high-temperature superconductivity with a
congruent $d$-wave symmetry in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.

<h3>Tunable persistent currents in a spin-orbit coupled pseudospin-1  fermionic quantum ring</h3>

<br>

We conduct a thorough study of the persistent currents in a spin-orbit
coupled ${\alpha}-T_3$ pseudospin-1 fermionic quantum ring (QR) that smoothly
interpolates between graphene (${\alpha} = 0$, pseudospin-1/2) and a dice
lattice (${\alpha} = 1$, pseudospin-1). In particular, we have considered both
intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (ISOC) and Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) in
addition to an external magnetic field, and have systematically enumerated
their individual and combined effects on the charge, valley and the
spin-polarized persistent currents. The energy levels of the system comprise of
the conduction bands, valence bands, and flat bands which show non-monotonic
dependencies on the ring radius, R of the QR, in the sense that, for small R,
the energy levels vary as 1/R, while the variation is linear in R for large R.
The cases corresponding to zero magnetic fields are benchmarked with those for
finite external fields. Further, it is noted that the flat bands demonstrate
dispersive behavior, and hence can contribute to the transport properties only
when ISOC is non-zero. Moreover, the RSOC yields spin-split bands, thereby
contributing to the spin-resolved currents, together with distinct degeneracies
for different spin branches. The persistent currents in the charge, valley, and
spin sectors for each of these cases oscillate as a function of the magnetic
field with a period equal to the flux quantum, as they should be, and depend
upon the spin-orbit coupling terms. Further, we have explored the role played
by the parameter ${\alpha}$ in our entire analysis to ascertain the effect of
the flat bands.

<h3>(chiral) Quantum well Rashba splitting in Sb monolayer on Au(111)</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06814" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06814</a>

<i>Jinbang Hu, Xiansi Wang, Justin W Wells</i>
<br>
<br>
We present atomic and electronic structure investigations of Single-layer
(110) surface of rhombohedral crystal formed Sb on Au(111) substrate. Low
energy electron diffraction (LEED) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
reveal a pure 2D Sb stripe structure with mirror symmetry broken along the x
axis direction. The electronic band structure is determined by angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The significantly complex surface band
structure results from a combination of a surface band originating from the
three different azimuthal orientations of the (110) rhombohedral phase and
Umklapp scattered branches of Au sp band. The experimental bands are compared
to the calculated band structure of $3\times\sqrt{3}$ periodicity of Sb(110).
Most of the experimental band dispersions are qualitatively reproduced by the
theoretical band structure except Umklapp scattered surface band. Taking
advantage of our DFT calculations, we found the quantum well(QW) Rashba
splitting bands appear at both $\bar{\Gamma}$ point and $\bar{X}$ point.
Considering the surface Brillouin zone (SBZ) relationship between Sb(110)
sub-unit cell and Au(111) surface, the distinct in energy position of QW states
at $\bar{\Gamma}$ point and $\bar{X}$ point is found be a combination of the
relative spin-orbital coupling(SOC) and the buckling of Sb monolayer on Au
surface that work together. The orbital decomposition of the Sb(110) projected
band structure indicates hybridization between Sb py state and Au state can
modify the spin splitting of QW states due to the intrinsic large SOC of Au
state introduced into the QW states.

<h3>On the relative abundances of Cavansite and Pentagonite</h3>

<br>
Cavansite is a visually stunning blue vanadosilicate mineral with limited
occurrences worldwide, whereas Pentagonite is a closely related dimorph with
similar physical and chemical properties, yet is extremely rare. The reasons
behind Pentagonite's exceptional rarity remain largely unknown. In this study,
we utilize density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the electronic
structures of Cavansite and Pentagonite at ground state and finite pressures.
We then employ the Boltzmann probability model to construct a comprehensive
phase diagram that reveals the abundance of each species across a wide range of
pressure and temperature conditions. Our analysis reveals the key factors that
contribute to the relative scarcity of Pentagonite, including differences in
structural arrangement and electronic configurations between the two minerals.
Specifically, because of the peculiar arrangements of SiO4 polyhedra, Cavansite
forms a compact structure (about 2.7% less in volume) resulting in lower
energy. We also show that at a temperature of about 600K only about 1%
Pentagonite can be formed. This probability is only slightly enhanced within a
pressure range of up to about 3GPa. We also find that vanadium induces a highly
localized state in both of these otherwise large band gap insulators resulting
in extremely weak magnetic phase that is unlikely to be observed at any
reasonable finite temperature. Finally, our dehydration studies reveal that
water molecules are loosely bound inside the microporous crystals of Cavansite
and Pentagonite, suggesting potential applications of these minerals in various
technological fields.

<h3>Generalized Kitaev Spin Liquid model and Emergent Twist Defect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06835" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06835</a>
<br>
<i>Bowen Yan, Shawn X. Cui</i>
<br>
<br>
The Kitaev spin liquid model on honeycomb lattice offers an intriguing
feature that encapsulates both Abelian and non-Abelian anyons. Recent studies
suggest that the comprehensive phase diagram of possible generalized Kitaev
model largely depends on the specific details of the discrete lattice, which
somewhat deviates from the traditional understanding of "topological" phases.
In this paper, we propose an adapted version of the Kitaev spin liquid model on
arbitrary planar lattices. Our revised model recovers the toric code model
under certain parameter selections within the Hamiltonian terms. Our research
indicates that changes in parameters can initiate the emergence of holes,
domain walls, or twist defects. Notably, the twist defect, which presents as a
lattice dislocation defect, exhibits non-Abelian braiding statistics upon
tuning the coefficients of the Hamiltonian on a standard translationally
invariant lattice. Additionally, we illustrate that the creation, movement, and
fusion of these defects can be accomplished through natural time evolution by
linearly interpolating the static Hamiltonian. These defects demonstrate the
Ising anyon fusion rule as anticipated. Our findings hint at possible
implementation in actual physical materials owing to a more realistically
achievable two-body interaction.

<br>

Understanding the organization of matter under the long-range electrostatic
force is a fundamental problem in multiple fields. In this work, based on the
electrically charged tethered membrane model, we reveal regular structures
underlying the lowest-energy states of inhomogeneously stretched planar
lattices by a combination of numerical simulation and analytical geometric
analysis. Specifically, we show the conformal order characterized by the
preserved bond angle in the lattice deformation, and reveal the
Poincar$\rm{\acute{e}}$-Klein mapping underlying the electrostatics-driven
inhomogeneity. The discovery of the Poincar$\rm{\acute{e}}$-Klein mapping,
which connects the Poincar$\rm{\acute{e}}$ disk and the Klein disk for the
hyperbolic plane, implies the connection of long-range electrostatic force and
hyperbolic geometry. We also discuss lattices with patterned charges of
opposite signs for modulating in-plane inhomogeneity and even creating 3D
shapes, which may have a connection to metamaterials design. This work suggests
the geometric analysis as a promising approach for elucidating the organization
of matter under the long-range force.

We present a variety of structures formed by colloidal droplets at a nematic
liquid crystal-air interface, where the elastic dipole-dipole,
quadrupole-quadrupole, and dipole-quadrupole interactions are all essentially
involved. The colloidal structures observed not only include chains with kinks
or clusters, but also comprise directional structures, such as directional
chains and branches, whose direction is associated with the tilting director in
the liquid crystal layer. The dipole-quadrupole interaction, originating from
the polydispersity of the droplets, plays a central role for the formation of
these directional structures. Clusters consisting of directional branches and
chains are also observed and found to be fractal statistically.

We investigated four single crystals of K-doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$ (Ba-122),
Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ with $x$ = 0.29, 0.36, 0.40, and 0.51, using
infrared spectroscopy. We explored a wide variety of doping levels, from under-
to overdoped. We obtained the superfluid plasma frequencies
($\Omega_{\mathrm{sp}}$) and corresponding London penetration depths
($\lambda_{\mathrm{L}}$) from the measured optical conductivity spectra. We
also extracted the electron-boson spectral density (EBSD) functions using a
two-parallel charge transport channel approach in the superconducting (SC)
state. From the extracted EBSD functions, the maximum SC transition
temperatures ($T_c^{\mathrm{Max}}$) were determined using a generalized
McMillan formula and the SC coherence lengths ($\xi_{\mathrm{SC}}$) were
calculated using the timescales encoded in the EBSD functions and reported
Fermi velocities. We identified some similarities and differences in the
doping-dependent SC quantities between the K-doped Ba-122 and the hole-doped
cuprates. We expect that the various SC quantities obtained across the wide
doping range will provide helpful information for establishing the microscopic
pairing mechanism in Fe-pnictide superconductors.

<br>
<br>
We investigated CeCoIn$_5$ and LaCoIn$_5$ single crystals, which have the
same HoCoGa$_5$-type tetragonal crystal structure, using infrared spectroscopy.
However, while CeCoIn$_5$ has 4$f$ electrons, LaCoIn$_5$ does not. By comparing
these two material systems, we extracted the temperature-dependent electronic
evolution of the $f$ electrons of CeCoIn$_5$. We observed that the differences
caused by the $f$ electrons are more obvious in low-energy optical spectra at
low temperatures. We introduced a complex optical resistivity and obtained a
magnetic optical resistivity from the difference in the optical resistivity
spectra of the two material systems. From the temperature-dependent average
magnetic resistivity, we found that the onset temperature of the Kondo effect
is much higher than the known onset temperature of Kondo scattering ($\simeq$
200 K) of CeCoIn$_5$. Based on momentum-dependent hybridization, the periodic
Anderson model, and a maximum entropy approach, we obtained the hybridization
gap distribution function of CeCoIn$_5$ and found that the resulting gap
distribution function of CeCoIn$_5$ was mainly composed of two (small and
large) components (or gaps). We assigned the small and large gaps to the
in-plane and out-of-plane hybridization gaps, respectively. We expect that our
results will provide useful information for understanding the
temperature-dependent electronic evolution of $f$-electron systems near Fermi
level.

<h3>Thermal stability and secondary aggregation of self-limiting,  geometrically-frustrated assemblies: Chain assembly of incommensurate  polybricks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06892" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06892</a>
<br>
<i>Michael Wang, Gregory Grason</i>
<br>
<br>
In geometrically frustrated assemblies, equilibrium self-limitation manifests
in the form of a minimum in the free energy per subunit at a finite,
multi-subunit size which results from the competition between the elastic costs
of frustration within an assembly and the surface energy at its boundaries.
Physical realizations -- from ill-fitting particle assemblies to self-twisting
protein superstructures -- are capable of multiple mechanisms of escaping the
cumulative costs of frustration, resulting in unlimited equilibrium assembly,
including elastic modes of ``shape-flattening'' and the formation of weak,
defective bonds that screen intra-assembly stresses. Here we study a model of
1D chain assembly of incommensurate ``polybricks'', and determine its
equilibrium assembly as a function of temperature, concentration, degree of
shape frustration, elasticity and inter-particle binding, notably focusing on
how weakly cohesive, defective bonds give rise to strongly
temperature-dependent assembly. Complex assembly behavior derives from the
competition between multiple distinct local minima in the free energy
landscape, including self-limiting chains, weakly-bound aggregates of
self-limiting chains, and strongly-bound, elastically defrustrated assemblies.
We show that this scenario, in general, gives rise to anomalous {\it multiple
aggregation} behavior, in which disperse subunits first exhibit a primary
aggregation transition to self-limiting chains (at intermediate concentration
and temperature) which are ultimately unstable to condensation into unlimited
assembly of finite-chains through weak binding at a secondary aggregation
transition (at low temperature and high concentration). We show that window of
stable self-limitation is determined both by the elastic costs of frustration
in the assembly as well as energetic and entropic features of inter-subunit
binding.

consistent with the underlying dynamical quantum transport description and is

Quantum memories facilitate the storage and retrieval of quantum information
for on-chip and long-distance quantum communications. Thus, they play a
critical role in quantum information processing (QIP) and have diverse
applications ranging from aerospace to medical imaging. It is well established
that quantized vibrations (phonons) in mechanical oscillators can behave
quantum mechanically and play an important role in QIP. Bulk acoustic wave
(BAW) phonons are promising candidates for storing quantum information due to
their long lifetimes. In this work, we investigate a hybrid magnonic system,
where BAW phonons are excited in a Gadolinium Iron Garnet (GGG) thick film via
coupling with quantized electron spin-waves (magnons) in a Yttrium Iron Garnet
(YIG) thin film. Recent experiments of a YIG/GGG device show that the memories
are limited by the phonon lifetime of 0.2 $\mu$s at room temperature. The
phonon lifetime is expected to be longer in the milliKelvin regime. However,
the phonon lifetime could be limited by diffraction in that regime, especially
for small scale devices. A complete understanding of the diffraction-limited
performance of the hybrid magnonic devices is not available. We present
theoretical and numerical analyses of the diffraction-limited BAW phonon
lifetimes, modeshapes, and their coupling strengths to magnons in planar and
confocal high-overtone bulk aoustic wave resonator (HBAR) structures. We
utilize Fourier beam propagation and Hankel transform eigenvalue problem
approaches and discuss the effectiveness of the two methods to predict the HBAR
BAW phonons. Our analyses predicts the diffraction-limited phonon lifetime to
be on the order of 100 milliseconds in confocal HBAR structures. We illustrate
that a focusing dome could significantly improve the performance of hybrid
magnonic HBAR structures, for quantum memory and transduction applications.

hole- carrier trap levels (DTR(E)), dispersing inside the energy gap of a
rubrene single crystal in a field effect transistor (FET) struction with Ca and
Au hetero-electrodes for an ambipolar carrier injection mode, by using
polymeric protection-layer materials on a Si substrate. Three different types
of polymeric materials, poly(methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(styrene) (PS)
and poly(chloro-styrene) (PCS) are employed. From the temperature (T)-dependent
source-drain current and gate voltage (ISD-VG) transfer characteristics, the
values of DTR(E) are evaluated. PS exhibits the most efficiently-balanced
ambipolar carrier transport, which is superior to PMMA that is most typically
used as the standard protection layer on a SiO$_2$/doped-Si substrate.
Discussions are made in the framework of a carrier multiple trap and release
(CMTR) model.

Liquid electrolytes in batteries are typically treated as macroscopically
homogeneous ionic transport media despite having complex chemical composition
and atomistic solvation structures, leaving a knowledge gap of microstructural
characteristics. Here, we reveal a unique micelle-like structure in a localized
high-concentration electrolyte (LHCE), in which the solvent acts as a
surfactant between an insoluble salt in diluent. The miscibility of the solvent
with the diluent and simultaneous solubility of the salt results in a
micelle-like structure with a smeared interface and an increased salt
concentration at the centre of the salt-solvent clusters that extends the salt
solubility. These intermingling miscibility effects have temperature
dependencies, wherein an exemplified LHCE peaks in localized cluster salt
concentration near room temperature and is utilized to form a stable
solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Li-metal anode. These findings serve as a
guide to predicting a stable ternary phase diagram and connecting the
electrolyte microstructure with electrolyte formulation and formation protocols
to form stable SEI for enhanced battery cyclability.

G\'acs' coarse-grained algorithmic entropy leverages universal computation to
quantify the information content of any given state. Unlike the Boltzmann and
Shannon-Gibbs entropies, it requires no prior commitment to a partition of
phase space or to probabilistic ensembles. Whereas earlier work had made loose
connections between the entropy of thermodynamic systems and
information-processing systems, the algorithmic entropy formally unifies them
both. For a close variant of G\'acs' definition, we prove a very general second
law of thermodynamics, and discuss its advantages over previous formulations.
Our law is a general property of Markov processes, which can be derived as
coarse-grainings of certain time-reversible dynamical systems. Finally, taking
inspiration from Maxwell's demon, we model an information engine powered by
compressible data.

Over the past decade, alchemical free energy methods like Hamiltonian replica
exchange (HREX) and expanded ensemble (EXE) have gained popularity for the
computation of solvation free energies and binding free energies. These methods
connect the end states of interest via nonphysical pathways defined by states
with different modified Hamiltonians. However, there exist systems where
traversing all alchemical intermediate states is challenging, even if
alchemical biases (e.g., in EXE) or coordinate exchanges (e.g., in HREX) are
applied. This issue is exacerbated when the state space is multidimensional,
which can require extensive communications between hundreds of cores that
current parallelization schemes do not fully support.
To address this challenge, we present the method of ensemble of expanded
ensembles (EEXE), which integrates the principles of EXE and HREX.
Specifically, the EEXE method periodically exchanges coordinates of EXE
replicas sampling different ranges of states and allows combining weights
across replicas. With the solvation free energy calculation of anthracene, we
show that the EEXE method achieves accuracy akin to the EXE and HREX methods in
free energy calculations, while offering higher flexibility in parameter
specification. Additionally, its parallelizability opens the door to wider
applications, such as estimating free energy profiles of serial mutations.
Importantly, extensions to the EEXE approach can be done asynchronously,
allowing looser communications between larger numbers of loosely coupled
processors, such as when using cloud computing, than methods such as replica
exchange. They also allow adaptive changes to the parameters of ensembles in
response to data collected. All algorithms for the EEXE method are available in
the Python package ensemble_md, which offers an interface for EEXE simulation
management without modifying the source code in GROMACS.

We study the implications of spin-orbit interaction (SOI) for two-qubit gates
(TQGs) in semiconductor spin qubit platforms. The exchange interaction
governing qubit pairs is anisotropic under SOI, posing a problem for
conventional TQGs derived under the Heisenberg exchange. After developing a
concise form of the effective two-qubit Hamiltonian under SOI, we use it to
derive properties of rotating-frame evolution. Two main observations are made.
First, in contrary to past belief, we find that an appropriate amount of SOI
can significantly enhance the controlled-phase gate fidelity compared to the
no-SOI case. Second, SOI enables novel two-qubit dynamics, that are
conventionally inaccessible through DC evolution, such as the reflection gate
and the controlled-not gate.

<h3>Absence of Vestigial Time-reversal Symmetry Breaking above $T_c$ in the  Strong-coupling Limit of a Twisted Bilayer Superconductor</h3>

<br>
Phase ordering in a 2D superconductor occurs via a BKT transition. However,
in bilayer systems with vanishing first-order interlayer Josephson coupling,
the superconducting phase can also exhibit spontaneous time-reversal symmetry
breaking (TRSB) due to the locking of the phase difference $\phi$ across the
junction via a second-order Josephson coupling $J_2 \cos (2\phi)$ with a sign
that favors $\phi = \pm \pi/2$. In particular, in unconventional
superconductors (SC), the first-order term $-J_1(\theta) \cos \phi$ can be
tuned to vanish via twisting the relative orientation (e.g., by $\theta=\pi/4$
in a $d$-wave SC), so that the second order coupling $J_2 \cos (2\phi)$ becomes
the dominant interlayer interaction. However, it remains unsettled whether TRSB
occurs above the BKT transition in the normal state (\textit{vestigial order}).
Here we show that in the strong-coupling (large $J_2$) limit, the TRSB onsets
precisely at the superconducting transition when $J_1= 0$, and at a lower
critical temperature when $J_1>0$.

<br>
<br>
(111) NiO epitaxial layers embedded with crystallographically oriented
Ni-clusters are grown on c-GaN/Sapphire templates using pulsed laser deposition
technique. Structural and magnetic properties of the films are examined by a
variety of techniques including high resolution x-ray diffraction,
precession-electron diffraction and superconducting quantum interference device
magnetometry. The study reveals that the inclusion, orientation, shape, size,
density and magnetic properties of these clusters depend strongly on the growth
temperature (TG). Though, most of the Ni-clusters are found to be
crystallographically aligned with the NiO matrix with Ni(111) parallel to
NiO(111), clusters with other orientations also exist, especially in samples
grown at lower temperatures. Average size and density of the clusters increase
with TG . Proportion of the Ni(111) parallel to NiO(111) oriented clusters also
improves as TG is increased. All cluster embedded films show ferromagnetic
behaviour even at room temperature. Easy-axis is found to be oriented in the
layer plane in samples grown at relatively lower temperatures. However, it
turns perpendicular to the layer plane for samples grown at sufficiently high
temperatures. This reversal of easy-axis has been attributed to the size
dependent competition between the shape, magnetoelastic and the surface
anisotropies of the clusters. This composite material thus has great potential
to serve as spin-injector and spinstorage medium in GaN based spintronics of
the future.

<br>
We study the effects of additive and multiplicative noise on the solution
landscape of nematic liquid crystals confined to a square domain within the
Landau-de Gennes framework, as well as the impact of additive noise on the
symmetric radial hedgehog solution for nematic droplets. The introduction of
random noise can be used to capture material uncertainties and imperfections,
which are always present in physical systems. We implement random noise in our
framework by introducing a Q-Wiener stochastic process to the governing
differential equations. On the square, the solution landscape for the
deterministic problem is well understood, enabling us to compare and contrast
the deterministic predictions and the stochastic predictions, while we
demonstrate that the symmetry of the radial hedgehog solution can be violated
by noise. This approach of introducing noise to deterministic equations can be
used to test the robustness and validity of predictions from deterministic
liquid crystal models, which essentially capture idealised situations.

We review well-known signatures of disorder in crystallographic and inelastic
neutron scattering data. We show that these can arise from different types of
disorder, corresponding to different values of the system entropy. Correlating
the entropy of a material with its atomistic structure and dynamics is in
general a difficult problem that requires correlating information between
multiple experimental techniques including crystallography, spectroscopy, and
calorimetry. These comments are illustrated with particular reference to
barocalorics, but are relevant to a broad range of calorics and other
disordered crystalline materials.

Refractory metals that can withstand at high temperatures and harsh
conditions are of utmost importance for solar-thermal and energy storage
applications. Thin films of TiN have been deposited using cathodic vacuum arc
deposition (CVA) at relatively low temperatures ~ 300 oC using the substrate
bias ~ -60V. The nanomechanical properties of these films were investigated
using nanoindentation and the spatial fluctuations were observed. The
nanoindentation results were simulated using finite element method (FEM)
through Johnson-Cook model. We have found the local nitridation plays an
important role on nanomechanical properties of TiN thin films and confirms that
the nitrogen deficient regions are ductile with low yield stress and hardening
modulus. This study further opens the opportunities of modelling the nanoscale
system using FEM analysis.

<br>
<br>
We generalize the nested Wilson loop formalism, which has been playing an
important role in the study of topological quadrupole insulators, to
two-dimensional (2D) and 3D nonsymmorphic materials with higher-order topology.
In particular, certain 3D Dirac semimetals exhibit 1D higher-order Fermi arc
(HOFA) states localizing on hinges where two surfaces meet and connecting the
projection of the bulk Dirac points. We discover that the generalized nested
Berry phase (gNBP) derived from this formalism is the bulk topological
indicator determining the existence/absence of HOFAs, revealing a direct
bulk-hinge correspondence in 3D Dirac semimetals. Finally, we study the Dirac
semimetals NaCuSe and KMgBi based on first-principles calculations and
explicitly show that the change in gNBP adjacent to the Dirac point corresponds
to the termination of HOFAs at the projection of Dirac points on the hinge. Our
findings not only improve the understanding of the bulk-hinge correspondence in
topological Dirac semimetals but also provide a general formalism for studying
the higher-order topology in nonsymmorphic systems.

<br>
We investigate the nature of the phase transitions in the quantum
Ashkin-Teller chain in the presence of chiral perturbations. We locate the
Lifshitz line separating a region of direct chiral transitions from the region
where the transition is through an intermediate floating phase. Furthermore, we
identify a small region in the vicinity of the four-state Potts point where
chiral perturbations are irrelevant and where the transition remains conformal.
Implications to Rydberg atoms experiments are briefly discussed.

<i>Deepak Gaur, Hrushikesh Sable, D. Angom</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we describe a new technique for numerical
exact-diagonalization. The method is particularly suitable for cold bosonic
atoms in optical lattices, in which multiple atoms can occupy a lattice site.
We describe the use of the method for Bose-Hubbard model as an example,
however, the method is general and can be applied to other lattice models. The
proposed numerical technique focuses in detail on how to construct the basis
states as a hierarchy of wavefunctions. Starting from single-site Fock states
we construct the basis set in terms of row-states and cluster-states. This
simplifies the application of constraints and calculation of the Hamiltonian
matrix. Each step of the method can be parallelized to accelerate the
computation. In addition, we have illustrated the computation of the spatial
bipartite entanglement entropy in the correlated $\nu =1/2$ fractional quantum
Hall state.

<h3>Optically induced delocalization of electrons bound by attractive  potentials</h3>

<br>
Within the Floquet theory of periodically driven quantum systems, we
demonstrate that a circularly polarized off-resonant electromagnetic field can
destroy the electron states bound by three-dimensional attractive potentials.
As a consequence, the optically induced delocalization of bound electrons
appears. The effect arises from the changing of topological structure of a
potential landscape under a circularly polarized off-resonant electromagnetic
field which turns simply connected potentials into doubly connected ones.
Possible manifestations of the effect are discussed for conduction electrons in
condensed-matter structures.

We study the nonequilibrium phase transitions from the absorbing phase to the
active phase for the model of disease spreading
(Susceptible-Infected-Refractory-Susceptible (SIRS)) on a regular one
dimensional lattice. In this model, particles of three species (S, I and R) on
a lattice react as follows: $S+I\rightarrow 2I$ with probability $\lambda$,
$I\rightarrow R$ after infection time $\tau_I$ and $R\rightarrow I$ after
recovery time $\tau_R$. In the case of $\tau_R>\tau_I$, this model has been
found to has two critical thresholds separate the active phase from absorbing
phases \cite{ali1}. The first critical threshold $\lambda_{c1}$ is
corresponding to a low infection probability and second critical threshold
$\lambda_{c2}$ is corresponding to a high infection probability. At the first
critical threshold $\lambda_{c1}$, our Monte Carlo simulations of this model
suggest the phase transition to be of directed percolation class (DP). However,
at the second critical threshold $\lambda_{c2}$ we observe that, the system
becomes so sensitive to initial values conditions which suggests the phase
transition to be discontinuous transition. We confirm this result using order
parameter quasistationary probability distribution and finite-size analysis for
this model at $\lambda_{c2}$. Additionally, the typical space-time evolution of
this model at $\lambda_{c2}$ shows that, the spreading of active particles are
compact in a behavior which remind us the spreading behavior in the compact
directed percolation.14

<h3>Converting a triplet Cooper pair supercurrent into a spin-signal</h3>

<br>

Superconductivity with spin-polarized Cooper pairs is known to emerge by
combining conventional spinless superconductors with materials that have
spin-dependent interactions, such as magnetism and spin-orbit coupling. This
enables a dissipationless and conserved flow of spin. However, actually
utilizing the spin-polarization of such supercurrents have proven challenging.
Here, we predict an experimental signature of current-carrying triplet Cooper
pairs in the form of an induced spin-signal. We show that a supercurrent
carried only by triplet Cooper pairs induces a non-local magnetization that is
controlled by the polarization direction of the triplet Cooper pairs. This
provides a measurement protocol to directly use the spin-polarization of the
triplet Cooper pairs in supercurrents to transfer spin information in a
dissipationless manner.

The magnon propagation length, (MPL) of a ferro/ferrimagnet (FM) is one of
the key factors that controls the generation and propagation of
thermally-driven spin current in FM/heavy metal (HM) bilayer based
spincaloritronic devices. Theory predicts that for the FM layer, MPL is
inversely proportional to the Gilbert damping (alpha) and the square root of
the effective magnetic anisotropy constant (K_eff). However, direct
experimental evidence of this relationship is lacking. To experimentally
confirm this prediction, we employ a combination of longitudinal spin Seebeck
effect (LSSE), transverse susceptibility, and ferromagnetic resonance
experiments to investigate the temperature evolution of MPL and establish its
correlation with the effective magnetic anisotropy field, H_K^eff (proportional
to K_eff) and alpha in Tm3Fe5O12 (TmIG)/Pt bilayers. We observe concurrent
drops in the LSSE voltage and MPL below 200 K in TmIG/Pt bilayers regardless of
TmIG film thickness and substrate choice and attribute it to the noticeable
increases in H_K^eff and alpha that occur within the same temperature range.
This study not only highlights the ability to manipulate MPL by controlling
H_K^eff and alpha in FM/HM based spincaloritronic nanodevices, but also shows
that the tuning of alpha is more effective than H_K^eff in controlling MPL and,
hence, the spincaloritronic efficiency.

<br>
Layered van der Waals magnets have attracted much recent attention as a
promising and versatile platform for exploring intrinsic two-dimensional
magnetism. Within this broader class, the transition metal phosphorous
trichalcogenides $M$P$X_3$ stand out as particularly interesting, as they
provide a realization of honeycomb lattice magnetism and are known to display a
variety of magnetic ordering phenomena as well as superconductivity under
pressure. One example, found in a number of different materials, is
commensurate single-$Q$ zigzag antiferromagnetic order, which spontaneously
breaks the spatial threefold $(C_3)$ rotation symmetry of the honeycomb
lattice. The breaking of multiple distinct symmetries in the magnetic phase
suggests the possibility of a sequence of distinct transitions as a function of
temperature, and a resulting intermediate $\mathbb{Z}_3$-nematic phase which
exists as a paramagnetic vestige of zigzag magnetic order -- a scenario known
as vestigial ordering. Here, we report the observation of key signatures of
vestigial Potts-nematic order in rhombohedral FePSe$_3$. By performing linear
dichroism imaging measurements -- an ideal probe of rotational symmetry
breaking -- we find that the $C_3$ symmetry is already broken above the N\'eel
temperature. We show that these observations are explained by a general
Ginzburg-Landau model of vestigial nematic order driven by magnetic
fluctuations and coupled to residual strain. An analysis of the domain
structure as temperature is lowered and a comparison with zigzag-ordered
monoclinic FePS$_3$ reveals a broader applicability of the Ginzburg-Landau
model in the presence of external strain, and firmly establishes the $M$P$X_3$
magnets as a new experimental venue for studying the interplay between
Potts-nematicity, magnetism and superconductivity.

Finding a material that turns superconducting under ambient conditions has
been the goal of over a century of research, and recently
Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O aka LK-99 has been put forward as a possible
contestant. In this work, we study the possibility of electronically driven
superconductivity in LK-99 also allowing for electron or hole doping. We use an
$\textit{ab initio}$ derived two-band model of the Cu $e_g$ orbitals for which
we determine interaction values from the constrained random phase approximation
(cRPA). For this two-band model we perform calculations in the fluctuation
exchange (FLEX) approach to assess the strength of orbital and spin
fluctuations. We scan over a broad range of parameters and enforce no magnetic
or orbital symmetry breaking. Even under optimized conditions for
superconductivity, spin and orbital fluctuations turn out to be too weak for
superconductivity anywhere near to room-temperature. We contrast this finding
to non-self-consistent RPA, where it is possible to induce spin-singlet
$d$-wave superconductivity at $T_{\mathrm{c}}\geq300$ K if the system is put
close enough to a magnetic instability.

We provide two pedagogical examples to understand the mechanisms at play in
stabilizing an insulating state, and an impurity level in the bandgap in two
insulators using DFT+U: Cu-doped Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O and V-doped SrTiO$_3$
transition metal-doped insulators. We find both to be insulating, with isolated
impurity (flat) bands, regardless of doping location. In both cases, the
electron degeneracy and crystal lattice symmetry are broken, leading to an
insulating state, and a magnetically and orbitally polarized impurity state
within the gap, clearly separated from the valence and conduction bands. We
also resolve previously noticed inconsistencies between DFT and experiment
regarding doping site energetics, crystal structure, and transparency in
Cu-doped phosphate lead apatite 'LK-99'. Doping one of each type of site in the
same unit cell ($20 \%$ doping) also simply leads to two spin-polarized
impurity bands in the material's gap. The local transition metal ion sites may
behave like color centers (or f-centers), possibly giving color at low
temperatures to what we predict to be a transparent, insulating material in the
recently synthesized LK-99. Weak ferromagnetism may be possible due to the
relatively delocalized unpaired spins in the valence band. Further work should
take into account the possibility of further changes in stoichiometry,
different doping locations, supercell effects, and quantification of magnetic
exchange interactions.

<br>
We examine motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) in two-dimensional run
and tumble disk systems using both machine learning and noise fluctuation
analysis. Our measures suggest that within the MIPS state there are several
distinct regimes as a function of density and run time, so that systems with
MIPS transitions exhibit an active fluid, an active crystal, and a critical
regime. The different regimes can be detected by combining an order parameter
extracted from principal component analysis with a cluster stability
measurement. The principal component-derived order parameter is maximized in
the critical regime, remains low in the active fluid, and has an intermediate
value in the active crystal regime. We demonstrate that machine learning can
better capture dynamical properties of the MIPS regimes compared to more
standard structural measures such as the maximum cluster size. The different
regimes can also be characterized via changes in the noise power of the
fluctuations in the average speed. In the critical regime, the noise power
passes through a maximum and has a broad spectrum with a $1/f^{1.6}$ signature,
similar to the noise observed near depinning transitions or for solids
undergoing plastic deformation.

Metal surfaces have long been known to reconstruct, significantly influencing
their structural and catalytic properties. Many key mechanistic aspects of
these subtle transformations remain poorly understood due to limitations of
previous simulation approaches. Using active learning of Bayesian
machine-learned force fields trained from ab initio calculations, we enable
large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to describe the thermodynamics and
time evolution of the low-index mesoscopic surface reconstructions of Au (e.g.,
the Au(111)-`Herringbone,' Au(110)-(1$\times$2)-`Missing-Row,' and
Au(100)-`Quasi-Hexagonal' reconstructions). This capability yields direct
atomistic understanding of the dynamic emergence of these surface states from
their initial facets, providing previously inaccessible information such as
nucleation kinetics and a complete mechanistic interpretation of reconstruction
under the effects of strain and local deviations from the original
stoichiometry. We successfully reproduce previous experimental observations of
reconstructions on pristine surfaces and provide quantitative predictions of
the emergence of spinodal decomposition and localized reconstruction in
response to strain at non-ideal stoichiometries. A unified mechanistic
explanation is presented of the kinetic and thermodynamic factors driving
surface reconstruction. Furthermore, we study surface reconstructions on Au
nanoparticles, where characteristic (111) and (100) reconstructions
spontaneously appear on a variety of high-symmetry particle morphologies.
