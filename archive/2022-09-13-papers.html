<h3>Apparent line tension induced by surface-active impurities</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05513" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05513</a>
<br>
<i>Fabio Staniscia, Matej Kanduč</i>
<br>
Line tension in wetting processes is of high scientific and technological
relevance, but its understanding remains vague, mainly because of its difficult
determination. A widely used method to extract the line tension relies on the
variation of a droplet's contact angle with the droplet's size. This approach
yields the apparent line tension, which factors in numerous contributions to
the finite-size dependence, thus masking the actual line tension in terms of
the excess free energy of the three-phase contact line. Based on our recent
computer simulation study, we investigate how small amounts of nonionic
surfactants, such as surface-active impurities, contribute to the apparent line
tension in aqueous droplets. When depositing polydisperse droplets, their
different surface-area-to-volume ratios can result in different final bulk
concentrations of surfactants, different excess adsorptions to interfaces, and,
consequently, different contact angles. We show that already trace amounts of
longer-chained surfactants are enough to cause a measurable effect on the
apparent line tension. Our analysis quantifies to what extent "background"
impurities, inevitably present in all experimental settings, limit the
resolution of line-tension measurements, which is crucial for avoiding data
misinterpretation.

<h3>Coulomb drag between two graphene layers at different temperatures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05529" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05529</a>
<br>
<i>Federico Escudero, Facundo Arreyes, Juan Sebastián Ardenghi</i>
<br>
We theoretically study the Coulomb drag in graphene when there is a
temperature difference between the layers. Within the degenerate limit, we find
that this can lead to significant deviations from the usual quadratic
temperature dependence of the drag resistivity. The exact behavior depends
strongly on the phase-space available for intraband scattering, and is not
symmetrical when the temperatures of the layers are interchanged. In
particular, when one layer is at a much higher temperature $T$ than the other,
the drag resistivity behaves as $\rho_D\sim T/d^5$, where $d$ is the interlayer
separation. The magnitude of the drag in this limit is always larger when the
active layer is at the higher temperature.

Low-energy magnonic logic circuits are an actively developing field of modern
magnetism. The potential benefits of magnonics for data processing are vitally
dependent on units based on non-reciprocal propagation of spin waves in analogy
to semiconductor diodes and transistors in electronics. In this article, we
suggest the approach to realize non-reciprocal propagation of spin waves in a
ferromagnetic metallic waveguide by exciting them with femtosecond laser pulse.
Using micromagnetic modeling, we show that the combination of an external
magnetic field and the position of the excitation laser spot across the
waveguide leads to unidirectional propagation of the excited spin-wave packet.
The results are crucial for the design of hybrid magnonic-photonic circuits in
future generations of data processing devices.

<h3>Integration of 3-level MoS$_2$ multi-bridge channel FET with 2D layered  contact and gate dielectric</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05750" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05750</a>
<br>
<i>Hitesh S, Pushkar Dasika, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Kausik Majumdar</i>
<br>
Multi-bridge channel field effect transistor (MBCFET) provides several
advantages over FinFET technology and is an attractive solution for sub-5 nm
technology nodes. MBCFET is a natural choice for devices that use
semiconducting layered materials (such as, MoS$_2$) as the channel due to their
dangling-bond-free ultra-thin nature and the possibility of layer-by-layer
transfer. MoS$_2$-based MBCFET is thus an attractive proposition for drive
current boost without compromising on the electrostatics and footprint. Here we
demonstrate a 3-level MoS$_2$ MBCFET, where each vertically stacked channel is
dual-gated to achieve a saturation current of 174.9 $\mu$A (which translates to
\txc{90 $\mu$A per $\mu$m footprint width (@2.7 $\mu$m channel length), a
near-ideal sub-threshold slope of 63 mV/dec, and an on-off ratio $>$$10^8$.
This work sets the benchmark for layer-material-based MBCFET in terms of the
number of parallel channels integrated, simultaneously providing high drive
current and excellent electrostatic control.

<h3>Diffusion through permeable interfaces: Fundamental equations and their  application to first-passage and local time statistics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06023" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06023</a>
<br>
<i>Toby Kay, Luca Giuggioli</i>
<br>
The diffusion equation is the primary tool to study the movement dynamics of
a free Brownian particle, but when spatial heterogeneities in the form of
permeable interfaces are present, no fundamental equation has been derived.
Here we obtain such an equation from a microscopic description using a lattice
random walk model. The sought after Fokker-Planck description and the
corresponding backward Kolmogorov equation are employed to investigate
first-passage and local time statistics and gain new insights. Among them a
surprising phenomenon, in the case of a semibounded domain, is the appearance
of a regime of dependence and independence on the location of the permeable
barrier in the mean first-passage time. The new formalism is completely
general: it allows to study the dynamics in the presence of multiple permeable
barriers as well as reactive heterogeneities in bounded or unbounded domains
and under the influence of external forces.

<h3>Collective density fluctuations of strange metals with critical Fermi  surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05491" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05491</a>
<br>
<i>Xuepeng Wang, Debanjan Chowdhury</i>
<br>
Recent spectroscopic measurements in a number of strongly correlated metals
that exhibit non-Fermi liquid like properties have observed evidence of
anomalous frequency and momentum-dependent charge-density fluctuations.
Specifically, in the strange metallic regime of the cuprate superconductors,
there is a featureless particle-hole continuum exhibiting unusual power-laws,
and experiments suggest that the plasmon mode decays into this continuum in a
manner that is distinct from the expectations of conventional Fermi liquid
theory. Inspired by these new experimental developments, we address the nature
of low-energy collective modes and the particle-hole continua for different
"solvable" lattice models of non-Fermi liquids that host a critical Fermi
surface -- a sharp electronic Fermi surface without any low-energy electronic
quasiparticles. We scrutinize theoretically the possible existence of a
long-lived zero-sound mode, which is renormalized to the plasma frequency in
the presence of long-ranged coulomb interactions, and its decay into the
continuum over a wide range of frequencies and momenta. Quite remarkably, some
of the models analyzed here can account for certain aspects of the universal
experimental observations, that clearly lie beyond the purview of standard
Fermi liquid theory.

<h3>Reversibly controlled ternary polar states and ferroelectric bias  promoted by boosting square-tensile-strain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05494" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05494</a>

Interaction between dipoles often emerges intriguing physical phenomena, such
as exchange bias in the magnetic heterostructures and magnetoelectric effect in
multiferroics, which lead to advances in multifunctional heterostructures.
However, the defect-dipole tends to be considered the undesired to deteriorate
the electronic functionality. Here, we report deterministic switching between
the ferroelectric and the pinched states by exploiting a new substrate of cubic
perovskite, BaZrO$_{3}$, which boosts square-tensile-strain to BaTiO$_{3}$ and
promotes four-variants in-plane spontaneous polarization with oxygen vacancy
creation. First-principles calculations propose a complex of an oxygen vacancy
and two Ti$^{3+}$ ions coins a charge-neutral defect-dipole. Cooperative
control of the defect-dipole and the spontaneous polarization reveals ternary
in-plane polar states characterized by biased/pinched hysteresis loops.
Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that three electrically controlled
polar-ordering states lead to switchable and non-volatile dielectric states for
application of non-destructive electro-dielectric memory. This discovery opens
a new route to develop functional materials via manipulating defect-dipoles and
offers a novel platform to advance heteroepitaxy beyond the prevalent
perovskite substrates.

<h3>The one-dimensional Holstein model revisited</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05498" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05498</a>
<br>
<i>Sijia Zhao, Zhaoyu Han, Ilya Esterlis, Steven A. Kivelson</i>
<br>
We analyze the global ground-state (quantum) phase diagram of the
one-dimensional Holstein model at half-filling as a function of the strength of
the electron-phonon coupling (represented by the strength of the phonon-induced
attraction, $U$) and the phonon frequency, $\omega_0$. In addition to
reanalyzing the various asymptotic regimes, we have carried out density-matrix
renormalization group simulations to correct previous inferences concerning the
anti-adiabatic (large $\omega_0$) and strong coupling (large $U$) regimes.
There are two distinct phases - a fully gapped commensurate charge-density-wave
and a spin-gapped Luther-Emery phase with a gapless charge mode - separated by
a phase boundary, with a shape that reflects different microscopic physics in
the weak and strong coupling limits.

<h3>Tunable topological order of pseudo spins in semiconductor  heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05506" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05506</a>
<br>
<i>Clemens Kuhlenkamp, Wilhelm Kadow, Atac Imamoglu, Michael Knap</i>
<br>
We propose a novel platform to realize highly-tunable, frustrated Hubbard
physics with topological order in multi-layer moire structures. Identifying a
layer degree of freedom as a pseudo spin, allows us to retain SU(2) symmetry,
while controlling ring exchange processes and concurrently quenching the
kinetic energy by large external magnetic fields. This way, a broad class of
interacting Hofstadter states and their transitions can be studied. Remarkably,
in the limit of strong interactions the system becomes Mott insulating and we
find exceptionally stable spin liquid phases which are induced by the magnetic
field. As the magnetic flux can be easily tuned in moire systems, our approach
provides a promising route towards the experimental realization and control of
topologically ordered phases of matter. We also discuss how layer pseudo-spin
can be probed in near-term experiments

<h3>Longitudinal magnetoconductance and the planar Hall conductance in  inhomogeneous Weyl semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05507" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05507</a>
<br>
<i>Azaz Ahmad, Karthik V. Raman, Sumanta Tewari, G. Sharma</i>
<br>
Elastic deformations (strain) couple to the electronic degrees of freedom in
Weyl semimetals as an axial magnetic field (chiral gauge field), which in turn
affects their impurity dominated diffusive transport. Here we study the
longitudinal magnetoconductance (LMC) in the presence of strain, Weyl cone
tilt, and finite intervalley scattering, taking into account the momentum
dependence of the scattering processes (both internode and intranode), as well
as charge conservation. We show that strain induced chiral gauge field results
in `strong sign-reversal' of the LMC, which is characterized by the reversal of
orientation of the magnetoconductance parabola with respect to the magnetic
field. On the other hand, external magnetic field results in `strong
sign-reversal', only for sufficiently strong intervalley scattering. When both
external and chiral gauge fields are present, we observe both strong and weak
sign-reversal, where in the case of weak sign-reversal, the rise and fall of
magnetoconductivity depends on the direction of the magnetic field and/or the
chiral gauge field, and is not correlated with the orientation of the LMC
parabola. The combination of the two fields is shown to generate striking
features in the LMC phase diagram as a function of various parameters such as
tilt, strain, and intervalley scattering. We also study the effect of strain
induced chiral gauge field on the planar Hall conductance and highlight its
distinct features that can be probed experimentally.

<h3>Photo-induced Superconductivity = Discrete Time Crystal?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05510" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05510</a>
<br>
<i>Zhehao Dai, Vibhu Ravindran, Norman Y. Yao, Michael P. Zaletel</i>
<br>
We propose that periodic driving can stabilize a new type of order,
"period-doubled superconductivity", in which a superconducting order parameter
oscillates at half the frequency of the drive. Despite having a zero
time-averaged order parameter, the ordered state exhibits perfect conductivity
and a Meissner effect. Our theory predicts that this phase may be realized as
the steady state of materials shown to exhibit photo-induced superconductivity.
We propose to detect the period-doubled oscillation of the order parameter by
utilizing a Josephson junction between a photo-induced superconductor and a
conventional superconductor. Our theory can also be realized via parametric
driving of cold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice.

<h3>Quantum Many-Body Scars from Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen States in Bilayer  Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05527" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05527</a>
<br>
<i>Julia Wildeboer, Christopher M. Langlett, Zhi-Cheng Yang, Alexey V. Gorshkov, Thomas Iadecola, Shenglong Xu</i>
<br>
Quantum many-body scar states are special eigenstates of nonintegrable models
with distinctive entanglement features that give rise to infinitely long-lived
coherent dynamics under quantum quenches from certain initial states. We
elaborate on a construction of quantum many-body scar states in which they
emerge from Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states in systems with two layers,
wherein the two layers are maximally entangled. We apply this construction to
spin systems as well as systems of itinerant fermions and bosons and
demonstrate how symmetries can be harnessed to enhance its versatility. We show
that several well-known examples of quantum many-body scars, including the
tower of states in the spin-1 XY model and the $\eta$-pairing states in the
Fermi-Hubbard model, can be understood within this formalism. We also
demonstrate how an {\it infinite} tower of many-body scar states can emerge in
bilayer Bose-Hubbard models with charge conservation.

<h3>Maximally valent orbitals in systems with non-ideal bond-angles</h3>

<br>
<i>Joydev De, Sujith N S, Manoar Hossain, Joydeep Bhattacharjee</i>
<br>
In pursuit of a minimal basis for systems with non-ideal bond angles, in this
work we try to pinpoint the exact orientation of the major overlapping orbitals
along the nearest neighbouring coordination segments in a given system such
that they maximally represent the covalent interactions through out the system.
We compute Mayer's bond order, akin to the Wiberg's bond index, in the basis of
atomic Wannier orbitals with customizable non-degenerate hybridization
constructed from first principles, in a representative variety of molecules and
layered systems. We put them in perspective with unbiased maximally localized
descriptions of bonding and non-bonding orbitals, and energetics to tunneling
of electrons through them between nearest neighbours, to describe the different
physical aspects of covalent interactions, which are not necessarily
represented by a single unique set of atomic or bonding orbitals.

<h3>Revealing the order parameter dynamics of 1T-TiSe$_2$ following optical  excitation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05542" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05542</a>
<br>
<i>Maximilian Huber, Yi Lin, Nicholas Dale, Renee Sailus, Sefaattin Tongay, Robert A. Kaindl, Alessandra Lanzara</i>
<br>
The formation of a charge density wave state is characterized by an order
parameter. The way it is established provides unique information on both the
role that correlation plays in driving the charge density wave formation and
the mechanism behind its formation. Here we use time and angle resolved
photoelectron spectroscopy to optically perturb the charge-density phase in
1T-TiSe$_2$ and follow the recovery of its order parameter as a function of
energy, momentum and excitation density. Our results reveal that two distinct
orders contribute to the gap formation, a CDW order and pseudogap-like order,
manifested by an overall robustness to optical excitation. A detailed analysis
of the magnitude of the the gap as a function of excitation density and delay
time reveals the excitonic long-range nature of the CDW gap and the short-range
Jahn-Teller character of the pseudogap order. In contrast to the gap, the
intensity of the folded Se$_{4p}$* band can only give access to the excitonic
order. These results provide new information into the the long standing debate
on the origin of the gap in TiSe$_2$ and place it in the same context of other
quantum materials where a pseudogap phase appears to be a precursor of
long-range order.

<h3>Stochastic motion in phase space on a surface of constant energy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05545" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05545</a>
<br>
<i>Tânia Tomé, Mário J. de Oliveira</i>
<br>
We study closed systems of particles that are subject to stochastic forces in
addition to the conservative forces. The stochastic equations of motion are set
up in such a way that the energy is strictly conserved at all times. To ensure
this conservation law, the evolution equation for the probability density is
derived using an appropriate interpretation of the stochastic equation of
motion that is not the It\^o nor the Stratonovic interpretation. The
trajectories in phase space are restricted to the surface of constant energy.
Despite this restriction, the entropy is shown to increase with time,
expressing irreversible behavior and relaxation to equilibrium. This main
result of the present approach contrasts with that given by the Liouville
equation, which also describes closed systems, but does not show
irreversibility.

<h3>Unified Graph Neural Network Force-field for the Periodic Table</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05554" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05554</a>
<br>
<i>Kamal Choudhary, Brian DeCost, Lily Major, Keith Butler, Jeyan Thiyagalingam, Francesca Tavazza</i>
<br>
Classical force fields (FF) based on machine learning (ML) methods show great
promise for large scale atomistic simulations. However, MLFFs are usually
designed for a narrow chemical space, making them non-transferable for broader
applications. Here, we develop a unified atomistic line graph neural
network-based force-field (ALIGNN-FF) that can model both structurally and
chemically diverse materials with any combination of 89 elements from the
periodic table. To train the ALIGNN-FF model, we use the JARVIS-DFT dataset
which contains around 75000 materials and 4 million energy-force entries, out
of which 307113 are used in the training. We demonstrate the applicability of
this method for fast optimization atomic structures in the crystallography open
database and by predicting accurate crystal structures using genetic algorithm
for alloys.

<h3>Metallic Hydrogen: Experiments on Metastability</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05571" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05571</a>
<br>

<br>
Molecular hydrogen was pressurized in a diamond anvil cell at temperatures
between 5 and 83 K. At a sufficiently high pressure, estimated to be between
477 to 491 GPa, hydrogen became metallic, determined by its reflectance in the
near infrared and fit to a Drude free-electron model. We then studied the
predicted metastability of metallic hydrogen. At a temperature of 5 K the load
on the metallic hydrogen was stepwise reduced until the pressure was zero.
While turning the load or pressure down, the sample evidently transformed to
the molecular phase and escaped; the sample hole closed. We estimate this
pressure to be 113 to 84 GPa. Metallic hydrogen was not observed to be
metastable at zero pressure.

<h3>Polycrystal Graph Neural Network</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05583" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05583</a>
<br>
<i>Minyi Dai, Mehmet F. Demirel, Xuanhan Liu, Yingyu Liang, Jia-Mian Hu</i>
<br>
We develop a polycrystal graph neural network (PGNN) model for predicting the
properties of three-dimensional (3D) polycrystalline microstructures. Compared
to existing GNN models in this domain, the PGNN model considers the physical
features of both the grains and grain boundaries, and therefore better aligns
with the physical principles. To evaluate the property prediction and transfer
learning performance of the PGNN model, a dataset of 5000 3D polycrystalline
microstructures and corresponding effective properties is generated by
high-throughput physics-based simulations. The effective Li-ion conductivities
and elastic stiffness coefficients of the polycrystalline Li7La3Zr2O12 ceramic
are utilized as the examples. Trained with 4000 data points, the PGNN model
achieves a property prediction error of <1.4%, which is superior to all the
baseline machine learning models, including a linear artificial neural network,
a convolutional neural network (CNN), and the ResNet. Furthermore, compared to
the PGNN model trained from scratch, a pretrained PGNN model demonstrates a
significant shorter training time and lower prediction error. Our fast,
accurate, and transferable PGNN model is therefore well suited for harnessing
large-scale 3D polycrystalline microstructure images that usually contain
billions of voxels per image, which can be too slow to address with voxel-based
machine learning models, such as the CNN.

We present a drop model for integer and fractional quantum Hall effects
(FQHE). We show that the two-dimensional electron gas breaks up into regions
with filling factors {\nu} = 1 and {\nu} = 0 in disk geometry, and the
formation of drops with a finite number of electrons is possible. Sequences of
filling fractions are constructed on the basis of experimental data. For all
sequences there are initial FQHE states, which correspond to a drop with five
electrons. The remaining FQHE states are composite states of a drop with five
electrons and one or more pairs of electrons.

Due to their versatility in investigating phenomena in microscopic scales,
optical tweezers have been an excellent platform for studying stochastic
thermodynamics. In this context, this work presents experimental measurements
of the energetic cost of driven finite-time protocols using colloidal Brownian
particles in harmonic potentials. For this simple model system, we compare the
results of optimal and sub-optimal protocols in a time-dependent trap,
controlling the trap stiffness with different modulation amplitudes and
protocol times. We also calculate the Jarzynski relation for the stochastic
trajectories from the experimental data as an independent consistency check.

<h3>A Neural Network Approach to Predict Gibbs Free Energy of Ternary Solid  Solutions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05609" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05609</a>
<br>
<i>Paul Laiu, Ying Yang, Massimiliano Lupo Pasini, Jong Youl Choi, Dongwon Shin</i>
<br>
We present a data-centric deep learning (DL) approach using neural networks
(NNs) to predict the thermodynamics of ternary solid solutions. We explore how
NNs can be trained with a dataset of Gibbs free energies computed from a
CALPHAD database to predict ternary systems as a function of composition and
temperature. We have chosen the energetics of the FCC solid solution phase in
226 binaries consisting of 23 elements at 11 different temperatures to
demonstrate the feasibility. The number of binary data points included in the
present study is 102,000. We select six ternaries to augment the binary dataset
to investigate their influence on the NN prediction accuracy. We examine the
sensitivity of data sampling on the prediction accuracy of NNs over selected
ternary systems. It is anticipated that the current DL workflow can be further
elevated by integrating advanced descriptors beyond the elemental composition
and more curated training datasets to improve prediction accuracy and
applicability.

<h3>Approaching the perfect diode limit through a nonlinear interface</h3>

<br>

<br>
We consider a system formed by two different segments of particles, coupled
to two thermal baths, one at each end, modeled by Langevin thermostats. The
particles in each segment interact harmonically and are subject to an on-site
potential, for which, three different types are considered, namely, harmonic,
$\phi^4$, and Frenkel-Kontorova. The two segments are nonlinearly coupled,
according to a power-law potential between interfacial particles, characterized
by the exponent $\mu$ and strength $k_\mu$. Thermal rectification is
investigated by integrating the equations of motion and computing the heat
fluxes. From a systematic study, varying the interface parameters $\mu$,
characteristic length $\ell$, and $k_\mu$, the average temperature $T_m$ and
relative difference of end temperatures $\Delta_{rel}\equiv \Delta T/T_m$, we
discuss the conditions under which optimal rectification is achieved. At high
temperatures, rectification is optimal at a finite $\mu$. When the average
temperature is sufficiently low, maximal rectification (close to 100 %) is
achieved in the infinite-square-well limit of the interface potential
($\mu\to\infty$).

<h3>Nonlinear Indentation of Second-order Hyperelastic Materials</h3>

The classical problem of indentation on an elastic substrate has found new
applications in the field of the Atomic Force Microscopy. However, linearly
elastic indentation models are not sufficiently accurate to predict the
force-displacement relationship at large indentation depths. For hyperelastic
materials, such as soft polymers and biomaterials, a nonlinear indentation
model is needed. In this paper, we use second-order elasticity theory to
capture larger amplitude deformations and material nonlinearity. We provide a
general solution for the contact problem for deformations that are second-order
in indentation amplitude with arbitrary indenter profiles. Moreover, we derive
analytical solutions by using either parabolic or quartic surfaces to mimic a
spherical indenter. The analytical prediction for a quartic surface agrees well
with finite element simulations using a spherical indenter for indentation
depths on the order of the indenter radius. In particular, the relative error
between the two approaches is less than 1% for an indentation depth equal to
the indenter radius, an order of magnitude less than that observed with models
which are either first-order in indentation amplitude or those which are
second-order in indentation amplitude but with a parabolic indenter profile.

The Earth's crust is known to be depleted of gold, among other slightly heavy
noble metals transported by magma from the Earth's mantle to the crust. The
bulk silicate Earth (BSE) model also suggests significant depletion of Au in
the silicate mantle itself, which cannot be explained by the amount of Au in
the mantle's magma. This implies that Au could remain in the lower mantle and
form stable compounds, especially with iron, which is the predominant element
within the core. While Fe does not form binary compounds or a bulk alloy with
Au under ambient conditions, it may do so at the elevated pressures found in
the Earth's interior. Here, using density-functional methods, we investigated
the possibility of identifying stable, binary Fe-Au compounds at pressures up
to 210 GPa. We found three such Fe-Au compounds, which are stabilized by
pressure and notable electron transfer, including an orthorhombic AuFe$_4$
phase that is ferromagnetic in nature with Au possessing a significant magnetic
moment. While our results suggest that thermal convection due to the
conductivities and the heat flux from the Fe-Au compounds could be an energy
source to power the Earth's geodynamo, they also point towards changes in Au's
chemical properties, as it can exist as either an anion or cation under
pressure. In addition, the sound velocity and the density predicted for the
various Fe-Au compounds suggest that they could shed light on the composition
of the core-mantle boundary and the Earth's core, while demonstrating how the
presence of trace amounts of Au could influence agreement with seismic data.

Thin sheets respond to confinement by smoothly wrinkling, or by focusing
stress into small, sharp regions. From engineering to biology, geology,
textiles, and art, these motifs have provoked decades of study. Yet, a
framework to explain the morphological paths of confined, thin sheets awaits an
understanding of how a wide range of intermediate confinement conditions drive
spontaneous stress focusing. We probe this regime with experiments and
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, in which circular sheets are flattened in
their central region and quasi-statically drawn through a ring. Wrinkles
develop in the outer, free region, then are replaced by a truncated cone, which
forms in an abrupt transition to stress focusing. An analogy to pressure
buckling of an encased ring captures the force associated with this event.
Additional cones sequentially pattern the sheet, until axisymmetry is recovered
in most geometries. Cone size is sensitive to geometry, which we explain with a
1D model wherein concentrated strain acts as an effective elastic foundation.
This work contributes to the characterization of general confinement of thin
sheets, while broadening the understanding of the d-cone, a fundamental element
of stress focusing, as it appears in realistic settings.

<br>
beta-Ga2O3 is a wide bandgap semiconductor with electrical properties better
than SiC and GaN which makes it promising for applications of next-generation
power devices. However, the thermal conductivity of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 is more than
one order of magnitude lower than that of SiC and GaN, resulting in serious
thermal management problems that limit device performance and reliability. This
work reports selectively transferring of high thermal conductivity 3C-SiC thin
film grown on Si to beta-Ga2O3 (001) substrate using surface activated bonding
(SAB) technique at room temperature, to attempt extracting the heat from the
surface of the devices. A 4.5-nm-thick interfacial crystal defect layer is
formed at the as-bonded 3C-SiC/beta-Ga2O3 interface. The thickness of the
interfacial crystal defect layer decreases with increasing annealing
temperature, which decreases to 1.5 nm after annealing at 1000 C. No voids and
unbonded area are observed at the interfaces, even after annealing at
temperature as high as 1000 C. The thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of the
1000 C-annealed 3C-SiC/beta-Ga2O3 interface and thermal conductivity of the
beta-Ga2O3 substrate was measured by time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR). The
3C-SiC/beta-Ga2O3 TBC value was determined to be 244 MW/m2-K, which is the
highest value ever reported for SiC/Ga2O3 interfaces, due to the high-quality
heterointerface. Our works demonstrate that selective transferring of 3C-SiC
film to the beta-Ga2O3 substrate is an efficient path to improve heat
dissipation of the \b{eta}-Ga2O3 power devices.

We propose a new scheme for optical simulation of topological systems: using
optical systems to simulate the change of eigenstates of topological systems in
momentum space, we can get the information of topological numbers according to
the change of light corresponding to the eigenstates in momentum space. In this
paper the scheme is applied to the one-dimensional SSH model and the
two-dimensional BHZ model. In addition, we design a Method of calculating
topological numbers by line integral for the two-dimensional topological
system, and explain the principle of this mothod. Thus we obtain a more
effective optical simulation scheme for the two-dimensional topological system:
we do the optical simulation around discontinuity points to obtain the
vorticity of every discontinuity points. Then we attain the topological number
by summing up the vorticity of all discontinuity points.

<h3>The Puzzle of Meteoritic Minerals Heideite and Brezinaite; Are they  Iron-based Superconductors? Are they Technosignatures?</h3>

<br>
Transition metal sulfides (Fe, V)3S4 and (Fe, Ti)3S4, with the monoclinic
Cr3S4 type structure have been studied for a long time, itinerant magnetism in
form of Spin density waves (SDW) have been found in these systems with
different features as evidenced by 57Fe Mossbauer Spectroscopy, there is an
intricate relationship between the proportion of Fe, V and Ti atoms, the degree
of commensurability of the SDW and the magnetic transition temperature. These
sulfides have no natural occurrence on Earth and some of these phases were
detected as minerals in meteorites; the mineral Heideite in the Bustee and
Kaidun meteorites, with minor proportion of Cr atoms leading to the general
formula (Fe, Cr)1+x (Ti, Fe)2S4, and the mineral Brezinaite in the Tucson
meteorite, with minor proportion of Fe atoms and traces of V, Ti and Mn atoms,
leading to the formula (Cr2.65Fe0.20V0.09Ti0.06Mn0.04)3.04S4. In this critical
review of the experimental literature, we discuss the issues that these
meteoritic minerals are structurally sensitive to the method of synthesis, and
so is their magnetic behavior, especially in the presence of minor and trace
elements. This discussion could shed light on our knowledge in Solid State
Physics and Planetary Science; these meteoritic minerals are promising
candidates for iron-based superconductors because of three clues: they are
layered structures, they undergo a transition to SDW with variable degree of
commensurability and the minor and trace elements could act as dopants and
hence suppress the SDW giving rise to superconductivity. On the other side, the
genesis of these meteoritic minerals could require controlled and sophisticated
process not easily found in nature. So, it is important to be open-minded and
even provocative to consider the following question: Are these meteoritic
minerals samples of Extraterrestrial Technosignatures?

<h3>Theory of transverse magnetization in spin-orbit coupled  antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05702" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05702</a>
<br>
<i>Taekoo Oh, Sungjoon Park, Bohm-Jung Yang</i>
<br>
Some antiferromagnets under a magnetic field develop magnetization
perpendicular to the field as well as more conventional ones parallel to the
field. So far, the transverse magnetization (TM) has been attributed to either
spin canting effect or the presence of cluster magnetic multipolar ordering.
However, a general theory of TM based on microscopic understanding is still
missing. Here, we construct a general microscopic theory of TM in
antiferromagnets with cluster magnetic multipolar ordering by considering
classical spin Hamiltonians with spin anisotropy that arises from the
spin-orbit coupling. First, from general symmetry analysis, we show that TM can
appear only when all crystalline symmetries are broken other than the
antiunitary mirror, antiunitary two-fold rotation, and inversion symmetries.
Moreover, by analyzing spin Hamiltonians, we show that TM always appears when
the degenerate ground state manifold of the spin Hamiltonian is discrete. On
the other hand, when the degenerate ground state manifold is continuous, TM
generally does not appear except when the magnetic field direction and the spin
configuration satisfy specific geometric conditions under single-ion
anisotropy. Finally, we show that TM can induce anomalous planar Hall Effect, a
unique transport phenomenon that can be used to probe multipolar
antiferromagnetic structures. We believe that our theory provides a useful
guideline for understanding the anomalous magnetic responses of the
antiferromagnets with complex magnetic structures.

<h3>Third-order charge transport in a magnetic topological semimetal</h3>

<br>

<br>
Magnetic topological materials and their physical signatures are a focus of
current research. Here, by first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis,
we reveal topological semimetal states in an existing antiferromagnet ThMn2Si2.
Depending on the N\'eel vector orientation, the topological band crossings near
the Fermi level form either a double-nodal loop or two pairs of Dirac
points,which are all fourfold degenerate and robust under spin-orbit coupling.
These topological features produce large Berry connection polarizability, which
leads to enhanced nonlinear transport effects. Particularly, we evaluate the
third order current response, which dominates the transverse charge current. We
show that the nonlinear response can be much more sensitive to topological
phase transitions than linear response, which offers a powerful tool for
characterizing magnetic topological semimetals.

<br>
Antiferromagnetic (AF) transitions of birefringent Dirac fermions created by
a Y-shaped Kekul\'e distortion in graphene are investigated by the mean-field
theory and the determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the
quantum critical point can be continuously tuned by the bond-modulation
strength, and the universality of the quantum criticality remains in the
Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg class. The critical interaction scales with the
geometric average of the two velocities of the birefringent Dirac cones and
decreases monotonically between the uniform and the completely depleted limits.
Since the AF critical interaction can be tuned to very small values,
antiferromagnetism may emerge automatically, realizing the long-sought
magnetism in graphene. These results enrich our understanding of the
semimetal-AF transitions in Dirac-fermion systems and open a new route to
achieving magnetism in graphene.

<br>
Metallic barcode nanowires (BNWs) composed of repeating heterogeneous
segments fabricated by template-assisted electrodeposition can offer extended
functionality in magnetic, electrical, mechanical, and biomedical applications.
We can consider such nanostructures as a three-dimensional system of
magnetically interacting elements with magnetic behavior strongly affected by
complex magnetostatic interactions. This study discusses the influence of
geometrical parameters of segments on the character of their interactions and
the overall magnetic behavior of the array of BNWs having alternating
magnetization. By controlling the applied current densities and the elapsed
time in the electrodeposition, we regulate the dimension of the Fe-Au BNWs. We
show that the Fe and Au segments are made of Fe-Au alloys with high and low
magnetization. With the help of micromagnetic simulations, we discover and
analyze the three types of magnetostatic interactions in the BNW arrays. As a
result, we demonstrate that the dominating type of interaction depends on the
geometric parameters of the Fe and Au segments and the interwire and intrawire
distances.

Higher-order topological insulator (HOTI) has been extended from crystals to
quasicrystals. However, due to the difference in spatial symmetry, the
realization mechanism and analysis method of HOTI in crystals and quasicrystals
are not universal. In this Letter, the multimer analysis method (MAM) is
strictly defined and improved, and the higher-order topology (HOT) in
quasicrystals is revealed by MAM and its universality in crystals is verified.
The Stampfli-type higher-order topological quasicrystalline insulator (HOTQI)
protected by long-range C12 symmetry dominated by C6 symmetry is constructed.
Based on MAM, the topological phase transition of HOTQI is investigated, and a
real-space topological index is proposed. In addition, photonic and phononic
analogs of HOTQI are constructed based on MAM. This work provides a universal
method for revealing the HOT in various systems (crystals and quasicrystals,
electronics, photonics and phononics).

<h3>Non-reciprocity of Vortex-limited Critical Current in Conventional  Superconducting Micro-bridges</h3>

<br>
<i>Dhavala Suri, Akashdeep Kamra, Thomas N. G. Meier, Matthias Kronseder, Wolfgang Belzing, Christian H. Back, Christoph Strunk</i>
<br>
Non-reciprocity in the critical current has been observed in a variety of
superconducting systems and has been called the superconducting diode effect.
The origin underlying the effect depends on the symmetry breaking mechanisms at
play. We investigate superconducting micro bridges of NbN and also NbN/magnetic
insulator (MI) hybrids. We observe a large diode efficiency of $\approx$~30\%
when an out-of-plane magnetic field as small as 25~mT is applied. In both NbN
and NbN/MI hybrid, we find that the diode effect vanishes when the magnetic
field is parallel to the sample plane. Our observations are consistent with the
critical current being determined by the vortex surface barrier. Unequal
barriers on the two edges of the superconductor strip result in the diode
effect. Furthermore, the rectification is observed up to a temperature
$\sim$10~K, which makes the device potential for diode based applications over
larger temperature range than before.

The effect of improved dielectric properties in the presence of an applied
magnetic field is discussed in Pr doped polycrystalline
Gd$_{0.55}$Pr$_{0.45}$MnO$_3$ complemented by the structural properties down to
50 K and magnetic properties. Enhanced dielectric permittivity and low
dielectric loss represent the strongly field-dependent dielectric behaviour of
the sample. The structural characterizations using synchrotron angle dispersive
X-ray diffraction confirm the orthorhombic symmetry of the polycrystalline
sample with the Pnma space group from 300 K to 50 K. There is no structural
transition at lower temperatures up to 50 K; however the Mn O octahedral
distortion is reduced. The investigation of dielectric properties for
frequencies range 500 Hz to 1 MHz was conducted in the temperature range 8 K to
300 K with and without a magnetic field of 7 Tesla, which shows the high
dielectric constant in the 500 Hz frequency region. This confirms the
relaxation phenomena in polycrystalline Gd$_{0.55}$Pr$_{0.45}$MnO$_3$. ac
conductivity data shows the increasing trend for frequencies along with the
activation energy which increases from low frequencies to higher frequencies.
Temperature-dependent dc magnetization study shows the negative magnetization
in polycrystalline Gd$_{0.55}$Pr$_{0.45}$MnO$_3$ at low temperature at 100 Oe
applied field, due to spin canting of Mn-Mn magnetic lattice. High coercivity
due to competition in between spin ordering of Mn and Gd,Pr magnetic lattice at
5 K are also observed in the field-dependent magnetization study.

A theory of self-excitation in the metal-insulator-metal structure doped with
metal nanowires is developed for the case where the power is provided by an
external source of radio waves. Both the transient stage of self-excitation and
the steady-state regime of self-oscillation are analyzed in a fully analytical
form. The numerical estimates demonstrate that this effect can be used for
diverse practical purposes, in particular, for radio frequency power
harvesting. These findings extend the approach developed in nano-optics to the

<i>Kangkang Li</i>
<br>
There have been intensive studies on Kitaev materials for the sake of the
realization of exotic states such as quantum spin liquid and topological
orders. In realistic materials, the Kitaev interaction may coexist with the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and it is a challenge to distinguish
their magnitudes separately. Here, we study the topological magnon excitations
and related thermal Hall conductivity of kagome magnet exhibiting Heisenberg,
Kitaev and DM interactions exposed to a magnetic field. In a strong magnetic
field perpendicular to the plane of the lattice ([111] direction) that bring
the system into the fully polarized paramagnetic phase, we find that the magnon
bands carry nontrivial Chern numbers in the full region of the phase diagram.
Furthermore, there are phase transitions relate two topological phases with
opposite Chern numbers, which lead to the sign changes of the thermal Hall
conductivity. In the phase with negative thermal conductivity, the Kitaev
interaction is relatively large and the width of the phase increases with the
strength of DMI. Hence the study here will contribute to the understanding of
related compounds.

<br>
We show how to properly extract the local charge order in two-dimensional
materials from scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS)
measurements. When the charge order presents spatial variations at the atomic
scale inside the unit cell and is energy dependent, particular care should be
taken. In such cases the use of the lock-in technique, while acquiring an STM
topography in closed feedback loop, leads to systematically incorrect dI/dV
measurements giving a false local charge order. A correct method is either to
perform a constant height measurement or to perform a full grid of dI/dV(V)
spectroscopies, using a bias voltage setpoint outside the material bandwidth
where the local density-of-states (LDOS) is spatially homogeneous. We take as a
paradigmatic example of two-dimensional material the 1/3 single-layer
Pb/Si(111). As large areas of this phase cannot be grown, charge ordering in
this system is not accessible to angular resolved photoemission or grazing
x-ray diffraction. Previous investigations by STM/STS supplemented by {\it ab
initio} Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations concluded that this
material undergoes a phase transition to a low-temperature $3\times 3$
reconstruction where one Pb atom moves up, the two remaining Pb atoms shifting
down. A third STM/STS study by Adler {\it et al.} [PRL 123, 086401 (2019)] came
to the opposite conclusion, i.e. that two Pb atoms move up, while one Pb atom
shifts down. This latter erroneous conclusion comes from a misuse of the
lock-in technique. In contrast, using a full grid of dI/dV(V) spectroscopy
measurements, we show that the energy-dependent LDOS maps agree very well with
state-of-the-art DFT calculations confirming the one-up two-down charge
ordering. This structural and charge re-ordering in the $3\times 3$ unit cell
is equally driven by electron-electron interactions and the coupling to the
substrate.

<br>
Crystal structure prediction for a given chemical composition has long been a
challenge in condensed-matter science. We have recently shown that experimental
powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data are helpful in a crystal structure search
using simulated annealing, even when they are insufficient for structure
determination by themselves (N. Tsujimoto et al., Phys. Rev. Materials 2,
053801 (2018)). In the method, the XRD data are assimilated into the simulation
by adding a penalty function to the physical potential energy, where we used a
crystallinity-type penalty function defined by the difference between
experimental and simulated diffraction angles. To improve the success rate and
noise robustness, we introduce a correlation-coefficient-type penalty function
adaptable to XRD data with significant experimental noise. We apply the new
penalty function to SiO$_2$ coesite and $\epsilon$-Zn(OH)$_2$ to determine its
effectiveness in the data assimilation method.

<br>
The Mn3X family of compounds was the first in which a large anomalous Hall
effect (AHE) was predicted to arise from a purely antiferromagnetic structure,
due to the Berry curvature in momentum space. Nearly simultaneously with this
prediction, a large AHE was observed experimentally in one of the hexagonal
members of this family, Mn3Sn. Aligning antiferromagnetic domains, a necessary
step for observation of the AHE, is more challenging for the cubic members of
the Mn3X family, due to a combination of a smaller spontaneous ferromagnetic
moment and much stronger magnetic anisotropy. Here, we use a combination of
uniaxial stress and applied magnetic field to align domains of bulk
single-crystal Mn3Pt, and demonstrate for the first time a substantial AHE in a
bulk sample of a cubic member of the Mn3X family. The AHE remains locked in
with essentially no quantitative variation when the stress is ramped back to
zero, which shows that it is not a consequence of any stress-induced
ferromagnetic moment.

<br>
Using polarization selective spontaneous Raman scattering, we have
investigated the 5$d$ transition metal compound K$_2$ReCl$_6$ which displays a
series of structural phase transitions. We observe a violation of the Raman
selection rules in the cubic high temperature phase as well as a low-energy
scattering continuum persistent throughout the investigated temperature range
from 300 down to 5 K. The continuum couples to one of the phonon modes at
temperatures above the lowest structural phase transition at 76 K. We propose a
common origin of these observations caused by local fluctuations in the
orientation of the ReCl$_6$ octahedra which locally break the long-range cubic
symmetry. Consistent results from the related non-magnetic compound
K$_2$SnCl$_6$ support this interpretation.

<br>
Dynamical properties of two-component mass-imbalanced few-fermion systems
confined in a one-dimensional harmonic trap following a sudden quench of
interactions are studied. It is assumed that initially the system is prepared
in the non-interacting ground state and then, after a sudden quench of
interactions, the unitary evolution is governed by interacting many-body
Hamiltonian. By careful analysis of the evolution of the Loschmidt echo,
density distributions of the components, and entanglement entropy between them,
the role of mass imbalance and particle number imbalance on the system's
evolution stability are investigated. All the quantities studied manifest a
dramatic dependence on the number of heavy and lighter fermions in each
component at a given quench strength. The results may have implications for
upcoming experiments on fermionic mixtures with a well-defined and small number
of particles.

<br>
In this article, we study the spreading of droplets of density-matched
granular suspensions on the surface of a solid. Bidispersity of the particle
size distribution enriches the conclusions drawn from monodisperse experiments
by highlighting key elements of the wetting dynamics. In all cases, the
relation between the dynamic contact angle and the velocity of the contact line
follows a similar relation as that of a simple fluid, despite the complexity
introduced by the presence of particles. We extract from this relation an
apparent wetting viscosity of the suspensions that differs from that measured
in the bulk. Dimensional analysis supported by experimental measurements yields
estimate of the size of the region inside the droplet where the value of the
dynamic contact angle depends on a balance of viscous dissipation and capillary
stresses. Depending on how particle size compares with this viscous cut-off
length seems crucial in determining the value of the apparent wetting
viscosity. With bimodal blends, the particle size ratio can be used to show the
effects of the local structure and volume fraction at the contact line, both
impacting the value of the corresponding wetting viscosity.

We report the observation of cluster glass-like properties in a double
perovskite ruthenate Ba$_2$CoRuO$_6$ through structural (neutron and
synchrotron X-ray diffraction), magnetic and transport measurements. The system
exhibits classic glassy characteristics like a frequency dependence in ac
Susceptibility, aging and memory effects along with persistance of short-range
correlations upto room temperature. The significant ($\sim30\%$) anti-site
disorder on the dimer sites, coupled with the inherent geometrical frustration,
allows a variety of exchange (both antiferro- and ferromagnetic) interactions
to be distributed randomly across the lattice. On cooling, locally dominant
interactions cause spins to nucleate and form local, short-range ordered
clusters which grow in size until a global freezing occurs at about $T_f \sim
43K$.

Thin ferromagnetic films can possess unconventional magnetic properties,
opening a new road for using them in spintronic technologies. In the present
work exploiting three different methods, we comprehensively analyze phason
excitations of a skyrmion lattice in synthetic antiferromagnets. To analyze
phason excitations of the skyrmion lattice, we have constructed an analytical
model based on three coupled helices and found a linear gapless mode.
Micromagnetic simulations also support this result. Moreover, a similar result
has been achieved within the rigid skyrmion lattice model based on the coupled
Thiele's equations, when the coupling between skyrmions in different layers of
the synthetic antiferromagnetic is comparable to or larger than the intralayer
coupling. In addition, we also consider the orbital angular momentum and spin
pumping current associated with phason excitations. Due to the gapless
excitations in the case of skyrmion lattice, the pumping current is nonzero for
the arbitrary frequency of pumping microwaves. In the case of individual
skyrmions, no current is pumped when microwave frequency is inside the gap of
the spectrum of individual skyrmions.

We study the statistical properties of a non-Markovian chiral run-and-tumble
particle (CRTP) in two dimensions in continuous space and time. In our model,
the possible orientations of the particle correspond to the four cardinal
directions. The particle can reorient by turning left, right or reversing its
direction of motion at different rates. We show how chirality manifests itself
in the transport properties like the spatial moments of the marginal position
distribution and the first-passage properties of a CRTP. Interestingly, we find
that the chirality leads to enhanced diffusion and a \textit{looping} tendency
in the trajectory space. Furthermore, our results show that chirality plays a
pivotal role in the improvement of the search strategy -- notably, there exists
an optimal bias in tumbling that minimizes the mean search time. This key
observation can play a crucial role in determining how living systems
efficiently search under non-equilibrium conditions.

<br>
Optical spectroscopy of ultimately thin materials has significantly enhanced
our understanding of collective excitations in low-dimensional semiconductors.
This is particularly reflected by the rich physics of excitons in atomically
thin crystals which uniquely arises from the interplay of strong Coulomb
correlation, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and lattice geometry. Here we extend
the field by reporting the observation of room temperature excitons in a
material of non-trivial global topology. We study the fundamental optical
excitation spectrum of a single layer of bismuth atoms epitaxially grown on a
SiC substrate (hereafter bismuthene or Bi/SiC) which has been established as a
large-gap, two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator. Strongly
developed optical resonances are observed to emerge around the direct gap at
the K and K' points of the Brillouin zone, indicating the formation of bound
excitons with considerable oscillator strength. These experimental findings are
corroborated, concerning both the character of the excitonic resonances as well
as their energy scale, by ab-initio \emph{GW} and Bethe-Salpeter equation
calculations, confirming strong Coulomb interaction effects in these optical
excitations. Our observations provide the first evidence of excitons in a 2D
QSH insulator at room temperature, with excitonic and topological physics
deriving from the very same electronic structure.

<br>
We focus on three-component SU(3) Fermi gases loaded into a square optical
lattice, with population imbalance between one component and the others. At
strong coupling the system is described by the SU(3) Heisenberg model with an
external field that couples to the population imbalance. We discuss the ground
state at the mean-field level and then analyze the thermal fluctuations with
the semi-classical Monte-Carlo method. The interplay of interactions,
population imbalance and thermal fluctuations gives rise to a phase transition
linked to the breaking of an emergent Ising symmetry, despite the absence of
frustration. This represents a new scenario of discrete symmetry breaking in
low-dimensional systems with continuous symmetries. Possible implementations
with cold alkaline-earth(-like) atoms are discussed.

<br>
We consider helical rotation of skyrmions confined in the potentials formed
by nano-disks. Based on numerical and analytical calculations we propose the
skyrmion echo phenomenon. The physical mechanism of the skyrmion echo formation
is also proposed. Due to the distortion of the lattice, impurities, or pinning
effect, confined skyrmions experience slightly different local fields, which
leads to dephasing of the initial signal. The interaction between skyrmions
also can contribute to the dephasing process. However, switching the
magnetization direction in the nanodiscs (e.g. by spin transfer torque) also
switches the helical rotation of the skyrmions from clockwise to anticlockwise
(or vice-versa), and this restores the initial signal (which is the essence of
skyrmion echo).

<h3>Direct observation of ultrafast lattice distortions during  exciton-polaron formation in lead-halide perovskite nanocrystals</h3>

<br>
The microscopic origin of slow carrier cooling in lead-halide perovskites
remains debated, and has direct implications for applications. Slow carrier
cooling has been attributed to either polaron formation or a hot-phonon
bottleneck effect at high excited carrier densities (> 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$).
These effects cannot be unambiguously disentangled from optical experiments
alone. However, they can be distinguished by direct observations of ultrafast
lattice dynamics, as these effects are expected to create qualitatively
distinct fingerprints. To this end, we employ femtosecond electron diffraction
and directly measure the sub-picosecond lattice dynamics of weakly confined
CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals following above-gap photo-excitation. The data reveal a
light-induced structural distortion appearing on a time scale varying between
380 fs to 1200 fs depending on the excitation fluence. We attribute these
dynamics to the effect of exciton-polarons on the lattice, and the slower
dynamics at high fluences to slower hot carrier cooling, which slows down the
establishment of the exciton-polaron population. Further analysis and
simulations show that the distortion is consistent with motions of the
[PbBr$_3$]$^{-}$ octahedral ionic cage, and closest agreement with the data is
obtained for Pb-Br bond lengthening. Our work demonstrates how direct studies
of lattice dynamics on the sub-picosecond timescale can discriminate between
competing scenarios, thereby shedding light on the origin of slow carrier
cooling in lead-halide perovskites.

We present a code modularization approach to design efficient and massively
parallel cubic and linear-scaling solvers in electronic structure codes. The
modular implementation of the orbital minimization method (OMM), in which
linear algebra and parallelization issues are handled via external libraries,
is demonstrated in the SIESTA code. The DBCSR (Distributed Block Compressed
Sparse Row) library is used for algebraic operations with sparse matrices,
while ScaLAPACK (Scalable Linear Algebra PACKage) is used for dense matrices.
The MatrixSwitch and libOMM libraries, recently developed within the Electronic
Structure Library (ESL), facilitate switching between different matrix formats.
We show results comparing the performance of several cubic-scaling algorithms,
and also demonstrate the parallel performance of the linear-scaling solvers,
and their supremacy over the cubic-scaling solvers for system sizes of several
hundreds of atoms.

<i>Connor Skelland, Gino Hrkac</i>
<br>
We developed a grain growth model that is based on the energy minimisation of
surfaces with respect to the volume energy and the grain's environment. We used
the well-known FePt L1$_\text{0}$ system to discover the physical factors that
drive the shape and size of FePt grains. It was found that the preferred growth
directions are along symmetry planes that are determined by the basic crystal
and driven by surface energy minimisation. The model developed here can be used
to predict a grain's growth and shape as a function of atomic number and
composition. This means that by tailoring a grain's surface and grain
boundaries the shape of the magnetic grains can be manipulated.

<h3>Fractional Charges in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model</h3>

<i>Yidong Wu</i>
<br>
The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger(SSH) model has been widely used to study the
topological property of 1D systems. It is claimed that there is fractional
charge at the boundary of the nontrivial phase while none at that of trivial
phase. However, this conclusion is in direct contradiction to the modern theory
of polarization(MTP). We solve this paradox by showing that the polarization of
SSH model depends only on the distribution of the positive charges and is
irrelevant to the Zak phase defined in previous works. Thus the distribution of
positive charges alone determines whether the SSH chain is topological or not.
Similarly, we show the polarization defined by Berry connection can not be used
to characterize topological property of a 2D generalization of SSH model.

<h3>Origin of Enhanced Zone Lines in Field Desorption Maps</h3>

<br>
Artifacts in the collective desorption map of the detector hits impede a
truthful reconstruction, including enhanced "zone lines" with high atomic
impact intensity. Since APT is destructive, simulation is the only approach to
explain the origin of these zone lines, but previous work couldn't reproduce
them. Here, we use a new simulation technique that adds the full electrostatic
forces to the interatomic forces in a molecular-dynamics simulation and
eliminates the previous ad-hoc assumptions. We find for the canonical example
of tungsten that evaporation happens when the electrostatic force overpowers
the interatomic force, and the misalignment of the two forces deviates the
launch direction of the atoms in certain zones, giving rise to an accumulation
of hit events around zone lines.

We utilize the topological insulator (TI)-based magnetic heterostructures
Bi2Te3/CrTe2 to create the integrated spin-orbit toque (SOT) synapse-neuron
units compatible with the neuromorphic computing network. By taking advantages
of the strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the wafer-scale van der Waals (vdW)
integration, we demonstrate the multistate SOT switching with high endurance (>
5e4) and reproducibility (weight deviation < 0.006). Furthermore, the tunable
magnetism of CrTe2 not only achieves power reduction by 54% in the associated
SOT device, but also brings about the trainability of the sigmoid-type
activation function (k in [0.37,1.28]), which leads to an improved training
efficiency to attain the classification accuracy over 95%.

<h3>Electrical and thermal transport through $α-T_3$ NIS junction</h3>

<br>
<i>Mijanur Islam, Priyadarshini Kapri</i>
<br>
We investigate the electrical and thermal transport properties of the
$\alpha-T_3$ based normal metal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) junction using
Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) theory. We show that the tunneling conductance
of the NIS junction is an oscillatory function of the effective barrier
potential ($\chi$) of the insulating region upto a thin barrier limit. The
periodicity and the amplitudes of the oscillations largely depend on the values
of $\alpha$ and the gate voltage of the superconducting region, namely, $U_0$.
Further, the periodicity of the oscillation changes from $\pi$ to $\pi/2$ as we
increase $U_0$. To assess the thermoelectric performance of such a junction, we
have computed the Seebeck coefficient, the thermoelectric figure of merit,
maximum power output, efficiency at the maximum output power of the system, and
the thermoelectric cooling of the NIS junction as a self-cooling device. Our
results on the thermoelectric cooling indicate practical realizability and
usefulness for using our system as efficient cooling detectors, sensors, etc.,
and hence could be crucial to the experimental success of the thermoelectric
applications of such junction devices. Furthermore, for an $\alpha-T_3$
lattice, whose limiting cases denote a graphene or a dice lattice, it is
interesting to ascertain which one is more suitable as a thermoelectric device
and the answer seems to depend on the $U_0$. We observe that for an
$\alpha-T_3$ lattice corresponding to $U_0=0$, graphene ($\alpha=0$) is more
feasible for constructing a thermoelectric device, whereas for $U_0 \gg E_F$,
the dice lattice ($\alpha=1$) has a larger utility.

The bowing of the energy of the three lowest band-to-band transitions in
$\beta$-(Al$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ alloys was resolved using a combined
density functional theory (DFT) and generalized spectroscopic ellipsometry
(GSE) approach. The DFT calculations of the electronic band structure of both,
$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and $\theta$-Al$_2$O$_3$, allow extracting of the linear
portion of the energy shift in the alloys, and provide a method for quantifying
the role of coherent strain present in the
$\beta$-(Al$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ thin films on (010) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$
substrates. The energies of band-to-band transitions were obtained using the
spectroscopic ellipsometry eigenpolarization model approach [A. Mock et al.,
Phys. Rev. B 95, 165202 (2017)]. After subtracting the effects of strain which
also induces additional bowing and after subtraction of the linear portion of
the energy shift due to alloying, the bowing parameters associated with the
three lowest band-to-band transitions in monoclinic
$\beta$-(Al$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ are found.

<br>
In neutral dense electron-hole (e-h) systems at low temperatures, theory
predicts Cooper-pair-like excitons at the Fermi energy and a BCS-like exciton
condensation. Optical excitation allows creating e-h systems with the densities
controlled by the excitation power. However, the intense optical excitations
required to achieve high densities cause substantial heating of the e-h system
that prevents the realization of dense and cold e-h systems in conventional
semiconductors. In this work, we study e-h systems created by optical
excitation in separated electron and hole layers. The layer separation
increases the e-h recombination time and, in turn, the density for a given
optical excitation by orders of magnitude and, as a result, enables the
realization of the dense and cold e-h system. We found a strong enhancement of
photoluminescence intensity at the Fermi energy of the neutral dense ultracold
e-h system that evidences the emergence of excitonic Fermi edge singularity due
to the Cooper-pair-like excitons at the Fermi energy.

For driven open systems in contact with multiple heat reservoirs, we find the
marginal distributions of work or heat do not satisfy any fluctuation theorem,
but the joint distribution of work and heat satisfies a family of fluctuation
theorems. A hierarchical structure of these fluctuation theorems is discovered
in both classical and quantum regimes, and thus we put all fluctuation theorems
concerning work and heat in a unified framework. We also propose a general
method to calculate the joint statistics of work and heat in the case of
multiple heat reservoirs via the Feynman-Kac equation. For a classical Brownian
particle in contact with multiple heat reservoirs, we verify the validity of
the fluctuation theorems for the joint distribution of work and heat.

Using a non-perturbative classical approach, we study the dynamics of a
mobile particle interacting with an infinite one-dimensional (1D) chain of
harmonic oscillators. This minimal system is an effective model for many 1D
transport phenomena, such as molecular motion in nanotubes and ionic conduction
through solid-state materials. As expected, coupling between the mobile
particle and the chain induces dissipation of the mobile particle's energy.
However, both numerical and analytic results demonstrate an unconventional
non-monotonic dependence of the drag on particle speed. In addition, when this
system is subjected to a constant bias, it supports multiple steady-state drift
velocities.

Resonant scattering of electromagnetic (EM) waves by small particles is
considered as one of the basic problem in metamaterial science. At present,
special subwavelength resonators are considered as structural elements in
chiral and bianisotropic metamaterials. There is a general consensus that these
small scatterers behave like "artificial atoms", meta-atoms, with strong
electrical and magnetic responses and an interconnection between these
responses. However, the observed effect of magnetoelectric (ME) coupling in
these meta-atoms is not associated with the near-field manipulation properties
caused by intrinsic magnetoelectricity. This arises the question whether ME
point scatterers of EM radiation really exist. In this paper, we show that
there are mesoscopic structures with electric and magnetic dipole-carrying
excitations that behave like point scatterers with their inherent
magnetoelectricity. In such subwavelength resonators, coherent oscillations of
the electric polarization and magnetization can be considered as quasistatic
oscillations described by electrostatic (ES) and magnetostatic (MS) scalar wave
functions. The ME resonance effect arises from the coupling of two, ES and MS,
oscillations. The near fields of these resonators, called the ME near fields,
are characterized by simultaneous violation of time reversal and inversion
symmetry. In study of ME fields and EM problems associated with these fields,
we put forward the concept of ME-field electrodynamics. Like the axion-field
electrodynamics and the axion-polariton problem, we are talking about modified
Maxwell equations with a presudoscalar source terms and the quantum field
theory for massive particles. While the axion fields are boson scalar fields,
the ME fields are fermionic fields. These fields are characterized by energy
eigenstates with rotational superflows and quantized vortices.

Layered rare-earth delafossites $ARX_2$ with $R$ = Yb(III) or Ce(III) have
received a lot of interest as potential hosts for a quantum spin-liquid ground
state. Some systems of this family that show no long-range order down to the
lowest measured temperatures, such as NaYbO$_2$, NaYbS$_2$, and NaYbSe$_2$, are
presumed to be in a quantum spin-liquid state. However, other isostructural
compounds are known to order antiferromagnetically at subkelvin temperatures.
Among them, KCeS$_2$ exhibits stripe-$yz$ magnetic order in the
triangular-lattice planes that sets in below 400 mK. Here we investigate the
spin-wave spectrum of this ordered phase with powder inelastic neutron
scattering and describe it using a model Hamiltonian obtained from
first-principles calculations based on the complete $|J,m_J\rangle$ multiplet
description of the Ce sites with an anisotropic nearest-neighbor exchange
interaction. Combing the current understanding of the exchange interaction in
the systems with the effects of texturing in the powder, we have been able to
model the inelastic neutron scattering spectrum with high fidelity.

We present a deep generative model-based variational free energy approach to
the equations of state of dense hydrogen. We employ a normalizing flow network
to model the proton Boltzmann distribution and a fermionic neural network to
model the electron wavefunction at given proton positions. By jointly
optimizing the two neural networks we reached a comparable variational free
energy to the previous coupled electron-ion Monte Carlo calculation. Our result
suggests that hydrogen in the planetary condition is even denser compared to
previous Monte Carlo and ab initio molecular dynamics data, which is further
away from the empirical chemical model predictions. Obtaining reliable
equations of state of dense hydrogen, and in particular, direct access to
entropy and free energy opens new opportunities in planetary modeling and
high-pressure physics research.

<br>
<i>Ram Narayanan, Prachi Parashar, K. V. Shajesh, S. Vijayakumar</i>
<br>
To investigate the role of long-range van der Waals interactions in static
friction, we derive an analytic expression for the coefficient of static
friction $\mu_s$ between two thin layers of polarizable materials under zero
load. For simplicity, we model the surface roughness with sinusoidal
corrugations and calculate the interaction energy perturbatively up to the
second order in corrugation amplitude. The ratio of corresponding maximum
lateral Casimir force to normal Casimir force is defined as the coefficient of
static friction, which is found to be independent of the dielectric properties
of the materials. It depends on the geometric properties, like interlayer
separation, corrugation amplitude, and wavelength of the corrugation. As a
proof of concept, our predicted values of $\mu_s$ for the 2D van der Waals
materials graphene and hexagonal boron nitride are in reasonable agreement with
previously reported values in the literature. This simplistic model could be
generalized by incorporating other forces, such as the frequency-dependent
contributions of van der Waals interactions and electrostatic interactions.

<i>Suman Mondal, Eric Bertok, Fabian Heidrich-Meisner</i>
<br>
Adiabatic and periodic variation of the lattice parameters can make it
possible to transport charge through a system even without net external
electric or magnetic fields, known as Thouless charge pumping. The amount of
charge pumped in a cycle is quantized and entirely determined by the system's
topology, which is robust against perturbations such as disorder and
interactions. However, coupling to the environment may play a vital role in
topological transport in many-body systems. We study the topological Thouless
pumping, where the charge carriers interact with local optical phonons. The
semi-classical multi-trajectory Ehrenfest method is employed to treat the
phonon trajectories classically and charge carriers quantum mechanically. We
find a breakdown of the quantized charge transport in the presence of phonons.
It happens for any finite electron-phonon coupling strength at the resonance
condition when the pumping frequency matches the phonon frequency, and it takes
finite phonon coupling strength away from the resonance. Moreover, there exist
parameter regimes with non-quantized negative and positive charge transport.
The modified effective pumping path due to electron-phonon coupling accurately
explains the underlying physics. In the large coupling regime where the pumping
disappears, the phonons are found to eliminate the staggering of the onsite
potentials, which is necessary for the pumping protocol. Finally, we present a
stability diagram of quantized pumping as a function of time period of pumping
and phonon coupling strength.

<br>
Nontrivial band topologies in semimetals lead to robust surface states that
can contribute dominantly to the total conduction. This may result in reduced
resistivity with decreasing feature size contrary to conventional metals, which
may highly impact the semiconductor industry. Here we study the resistivity
scaling of a representative topological semimetal CoSi using realistic band
structures and Green's function methods. We show that there exists a critical
thickness d_c dividing different scaling trends. Above d_c, when the defect
density is low such that surface conduction dominates, resistivity reduces with
decreasing thickness; when the defect density is high such that bulk conduction
dominates, resistivity increases in as conventional metals. Below d_c, the
persistent remnants of the surface states give rise to decreasing resistivity
down to the ultrathin limit, unlike in topological insulators. The observed
CoSi scaling can apply to broad classes of topological semimetals, providing
guidelines for materials screening and engineering. Our study shows that
topological semimetals bear the potential of overcoming the resistivity scaling
challenges in back-end-of-line interconnect applications.

The t - J Hamiltonian of the spinful hard-core bosonic ring in the Nagaoka
limit is solved. The energy spectrum becomes quantized due to presence of spin,
where each energy level corresponds to a cyclic permutation state of the spin
chains. The ground state is true ferromagnetic when the ring contains N = 2, 3
spinful hard-core bosons; for all other N it is a mixture of the ferromagnetic
and non-ferromagnetic states. This behaviour is different from the fermionic
ring, where ground state is true ferromagnetic only for N = 3. It is shown that
the intrinsic spin generated gauge fields are analogous to the synthetic gauge
fields generated by rotation of either the condensate or the confining
potential. It is argued that the low lying excited levels of the spin flipped
states intrinsically support the superfluidity. Possible ways to experimentally
verify these results are also discussed.

Symmetry distills the simplicity of natural laws from the complexity of
physical phenomena. The symmetry principle is of vital importance in various
aspects of modern physics, including analyzing atomic spectra, determining
fundamental interactions in the Standard Model, and unifying physics at
different energy scales. In this chapter, novel applications of this principle
are reviewed in condensed matter physics and cold atom physics for exploring
new states of matter.

We develop a quantum model for the injection of carriers in a material that
presents strong electron-vibration coupling. This model, which can be solved
numerically, is applied to the organic solar cells for which the electron
transfer at the donor acceptor interface is an essential step. We analyze how
the electron-hole interaction and the nature of the recombination process
impact the electron transfer. In particular this model explains, on a quantum
basis, how one can get high injection yield with a cold charge transfer state
as often observed experimentally.

<h3>Thermodynamic approach to liquid-to-glass transformation as an arrest  transition in polydisperse solution</h3>

Thermodynamic multi-component solution solidification approach to
liquid-to-glass transition is proposed and actual mechanisms underlying
vitrification, other than viscous slowdown, are identified. Due to polydisperse
aggregation in liquid state, glass-forming liquids, irrespective of chemical
composition, appear to be mixtures of various quasi-components whose
thermodynamic quantities shall be expressed not in terms of molar
concentrations of actual chemical components, but in terms of relative
concentrations of dominant structural units. Thermodynamically, any
glass-former is expected to behave as multi-component solution and solidify in
continuous temperature range between apparent liquidus and solidus temperatures
that can be identified as glass-transition range. Using extended irreversible
thermodynamics of polydisperse solutions it is demonstrated that upon
quenching, diffusional and Brownian mass transport in such solutions is negated
within heat removal timescale, which results in dynamical arrest of nucleation
and growth in clusters and solid-liquid phase separation. Rapid solution
solidification proceeds via successive cluster freezing in continuous
temperature range, in line with cluster size dispersity, which can be described
in terms of percolation in static polydisperse fractal ensemble where glass
transition temperature naturally emerges as percolation threshold.
Multi-component solution solidification framework is shown to be reconcilable
qualitatively and quantitatively with the Mode Coupling - Random First Order
Transition scenario. Finally, it is demonstrated that liquid-to-glass
transformation is thermodynamic liquid-to-solid phase transition, glassy state
of matter appears to be solid supersaturated solution of defects in otherwise
perfect matrix, and the true equilibrium structure which glass is unable access
is a crystalline one.

<h3>Integrable boundary conditions for staggered vertex models</h3>

Yang-Baxter integrable vertex models with a generic $\mathbb{Z}_2$-staggering
can be expressed in terms of composite $\mathbb{R}$-matrices given in terms of
the elementary $R$-matrices. Similarly, integrable open boundary conditions can
be constructed through generalized reflection algebras based on these objects
and their representations in terms of composite boundary matrices
$\mathbb{K}^\pm$. We show that only two types of staggering yield a local
Hamiltonian with integrable open boundary conditions in this approach. The
staggering in the underlying model allows for a second hierarchy of commuting
integrals of motion (in addition to the one including the Hamiltonian obtained
from the usual transfer matrix), starting with the so-called quasi momentum
operator. In this paper, we show that this quasi momentum operator can be
obtained together with the Hamiltonian for both periodic and open models in a
unified way from enlarged Yang-Baxter or reflection algebras in the composite
picture. For the special case of the staggered six-vertex model, this allows
constructing an integrable spectral flow between the two local cases.

<h3>Tunneling-induced fractal transmission in Valley Hall waveguides</h3>

The Valley Hall effect provides a popular route to engineer robust waveguides
for bosonic excitations such a photons and phonons. The almost complete absence
of backscattering in many experiments has its theoretical underpinning in a
smooth-envelope approximation that neglects large momentum transfer and is
accurate only for small bulk band gaps and/or smooth domain walls. For larger
bulk band gaps and hard domain walls backscattering is expected to become
significant. Here, we show that in this experimentally relevant regime, the
reflection of a wave at a sharp corner becomes highly sensitive on the
orientation of the outgoing waveguide relative to the underlying lattice.
Enhanced backscattering can be understood as being triggered by resonant
tunneling transitions in quasimomentum space. Tracking the resonant tunneling
energies as a function of the waveguide orientation reveals a self-repeating
fractal pattern that is also imprinted in the density of states and the
backscattering rate at a sharp corner.

<h3>Pinch-off of bubbles in a polymer solution</h3>

<br>
The formation of gas bubbles in a liquid occurs in various engineering
processes, such as during foam generation or agitation and mixing in bubbly
flows. A challenge in describing the initial formation of a gas bubble is due
to the singular behavior at pinch-off. Past experiments in Newtonian fluids
have shown that the minimum neck radius follows a power-law evolution shortly
before the break-up. The exponent of the power-law depends on the viscosity of
the surrounding Newtonian liquid, and ranges from 0.5 for low viscosity to 1
for large viscosity. However, bubble formation in a viscoelastic polymer
solution remains unclear, and in particular, if the evolution is still captured
by a power-law and how the exponent varies with the polymer concentration. In
this study, we use high-speed imaging to analyze the bubble pinch-off in
solutions of polymers. We characterize the time evolution of the neck radius
when varying the concentration and thus the characteristic relaxation time and
describe the influence of viscoelasticity on the bubble pinch-off. Our results
reveal that the presence of polymers does not influence the thinning until the
latter stages, when their presence in sufficient concentration delays the
pinch-off.

<h3>Parametric amplification of electromagnetic waves produced by a  flux-flow-oscillator made of YBaCuO Josephson junction arrays</h3>

<br>
We observe parametric amplification of electromagnetic (EM) waves produced by
a flux-flow oscillator made of YBaCuO Josephson junctions arrays coupled to the
resonant modes of a millimeter wave Fabry-Perot resonator at a pump frequency
fP=45 GHz. The frequency fS of the EM signal to be amplified could be tuned
continuously in the range (1-25) GHz by an applied B-field induced flux with a
one-flux-quantum periodicity. For all frequencies fS in the range (1-25) GHz we
measured a significant parametric gain for operation temperatures between 30K
and 45 K, with a maximum of (8-10.4) dB reached at 40K. Our results are very
promising towards the development of tunable MW generators/detectors, as well
as parametric amplifiers made of high transition temperature superconductors
and operating in a wide range of temperatures (20 mK-77K).

<i>Madhuparna Karmakar</i>
<br>
We report the first comprehensive microscopic description of the thermal
fluctuations tuned Fermi surface characteristics in a non-centrosymmetric
superconductor, in presence of an in-plane Zeeman field. Using a non
perturbative approach we demonstrate that short range fluctuating
superconducting pair correlations give rise to segmentation of the Fermi
surface with direction dependent pair breaking and hotspots for quasiparticle
scattering. Further, a fluctuation driven change in the Fermi surface topology
is realized, characterized by a shift of the corresponding Dirac point from the
trivial ${\bf k}=0$ to the non trivial ${\bf k} \neq 0$. Our results provide
key benchmarks for the thermal scales and regimes of thermal stability of the
properties of these systems, that are important from the applied perspective to
spintronic devices. Our theoretical estimates are in remarkable qualitative
agreement with the recent differential conductance and quasiparticle
interference measurements on Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$/NbSe$_{2}$ hybrid. A generic
theoretical framework for the finite momentum scattering of quasiparticles and
the associated spectroscopic features is proposed, which is expected to be
applicable to a wide class of superconducting materials.

<h3>Electrical conductivity and NMR relaxation rate of Eliashberg  superconductors in the weak-coupling limit</h3>

Electrical conductivity is an important transport response in
superconductors, enabling clear signatures of dynamical interactions to be
observed. Of primary interest in this paper is to study signatures of the
electron-phonon interaction in weak-coupling Eliashberg theory (Eth), and to
note the distinctions from BCS theory. Recent analysis of weak-coupling Eth has
shown that while there are modifications from the BCS results, certain
dimensionless ratios are in agreement. Here we show that the conductivities in
BCS theory and Eth fundamentally differ, with the latter having an imaginary
gap component that damps a divergence. We focus on the dirty limit, and for
both BCS theory and Eth we derive expressions for the small-frequency limit of
the real conductivity. For Eth specifically, there are two limits to consider,
depending on the relative size of the frequency and the imaginary part of the
gap. In the case of identically zero frequency, we derive an analytical
expression for the NMR relaxation rate. Our analysis of the conductivity
complements the previous study of the Meissner response and provides a thorough
understanding of weak-coupling Eth.
