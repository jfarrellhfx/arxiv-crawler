<h3>Theoretical approach to ferroelectricity in hafnia and related materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00688" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00688</a>
<br>
<i>Hugo Aramberri, Jorge Íñiguez</i>

Hafnia ferroelectrics combine technological promise and unprecedented
physical behaviors. Their peculiarity stems from the many active extrinsic
mechanisms that contribute to their properties and from a continuously growing
number of novel intrinsic features. Partly because of their unconventional
nature, basic questions about these materials remain open, and there are
inconsistencies between common theoretical assumptions and experimental
evidence. Aided by first-principles simulations, here we show that many of
hafnia's puzzles can be resolved by adopting an original high-symmetry
reference phase as the starting point of the analysis. The proposed theory
describes hafnia as a proper uniaxial ferroelectric that is not ferroelastic,
correcting previous discrepancies with experiment while confirming key
observations, such as the weak tendency of ferroelectric domains to grow. Our
approach also provides a straightforward and unified description of all
low-energy polymorphs, shedding light into old questions (e.g., the prevalence
of the monoclinic ground state), pointing at exciting possibilities (e.g., an
antiferroelastic behavior) and facilitating the future development of
perturbative theories (from Landau to second-principles potentials). Our work
thus yields a consistent and deeper understanding of hafnia ferroelectrics,
improving our ability to optimize their properties and induce new ones.

<h3>Raman Enhancement in Bowtie-Shaped Aperture-Particle Hybrid  Nanostructures Fabricated with DNA-Assisted Lithography</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01154" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01154</a>

<br>
<br>
We report on efficient surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) supporting
substrates, which are based on DNA-assisted lithography (DALI) and a layered
configuration of materials. In detail, we used nanoscopic DNA origami bowtie
templates to form hybrid nanostructures consisting of aligned silver
bowtie-shaped particles and apertures of similar shape in a silver film. We
hypothesized that this particular geometry could facilitate a four-fold
advantage in Raman enhancement compared to common particle-based SERS
substrates, and further, we verified these hypotheses experimentally and by
finite difference time domain simulations. In summary, our DALI-fabricated
hybrid structures suppress the background emission, allow emission
predominantly from the areas of high field enhancement, and support additional
resonances associated with the nanoscopic apertures. Finally, these
nanoapertures also enhance the fields associated with the resonances of the
underlying bowtie particles. The versatility and parallel nature of our DNA
origami-based nanofabrication scheme and all of the above-mentioned features of
the hybrid structures therefore make our optically resonant substrates
attractive for various SERS-based applications.

<h3>Development and Demonstration of a ReaxFF Reactive Force Field for  Ni-Doped MoS$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01268" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01268</a>

<br>
<br>
The properties of $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ can be tuned or optimized through doping.
In particular, Ni doping has been shown to improve the performance of
$\mathrm{MoS_2}$ for various applications, including catalysis and tribology.
To enable investigation of Ni-doped $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ with reactive molecular
dynamics simulations, we developed a new ReaxFF force field to describe this
material. The force field parameters were optimized to match a large set of
density-functional theory (DFT) calculations of 2H-$\mathrm{MoS_2}$ doped with
Ni, at four different sites (Mo-substituted, S-substituted, octahedral
intercalation, and tetrahedral intercalation), under uniaxial, biaxial,
triaxial, and shear strain. The force field was evaluated by comparing ReaxFF-
and DFT-relaxed structural parameters and the tetrahedral/octahedral energy
difference in doped 2H, energies of doped 1H and 1T monolayers, and doped 2H
structures with vacancies. We demonstrated the force field with reactive
simulations of sputtering deposition and annealing of Ni-doped MoS$_2$ films.
Results show that the developed force field can accurately model the phase
transition of Ni-doped $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ from amorphous to crystalline. The
newly developed force field can be used in subsequent investigations to study
the properties and behavior of Ni-doped $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ using reactive
molecular dynamics simulations.

<h3>Anderson localization in doped semiconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00680" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00680</a>
<br>
<i>Prathyush P. Poduval, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically consider the problem of doping induced insulator to metal
transition in bulk semiconductors by obtaining the transition density as a
function of compensation, assuming that the transition is an Anderson
localization transition controlled by the Ioffe-Regel-Mott (IRM) criterion. We
calculate the mean free path, on the highly doped metallic side, arising from
carrier scattering by the ionized dopants, which we model as quenched random
charged impurities. The Coulomb disorder of the charged dopants is screened by
the carriers themselves, leading to an integral equation for localization,
defined by the density-dependent mean free path being equal to the inverse of
the Fermi wave number, as dictated by the IRM criterion. Solving this integral
equation approximately analytically and exactly numerically, we provide
detailed results for the localization critical density for the doping induced
metal-insulator transition.

<h3>Disorder-Free Localization as a Purely Classical Effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00681" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00681</a>
<br>
<i>Pablo Sala, Giuliano Giudici, Jad C. Halimeh</i>
<br>
<br>
Disorder-free localization (DFL) is an ergodicity breaking mechanism that has
been shown to occur in lattice gauge theories in the quench dynamics of initial
states spanning an extensive number of gauge superselection sectors. Whether
DFL is intrinsically a quantum interference effect or can arise classically has
hitherto remained an open question whose resolution is pertinent to further
understanding the far-from-equilibrium dynamics of gauge theories. In this
work, we utilize cellular automaton circuits to model the quench dynamics of
large-scale quantum link model (QLM) formulations of $(1+1)$D quantum
electrodynamics, showing excellent agreement with the exact quantum case for
small system sizes. Our results demonstrate that DFL persists in the
thermodynamic limit as a purely classical effect arising from the finite-size
regularization of the gauge-field operator in the QLM formulation, and that
quantum interference, though not a necessary condition, may be employed to
enhance DFL.

<h3>Superconductivity from repulsive interactions in Bernal-stacked bilayer  graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00682" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00682</a>
<br>
<i>Glenn Wagner, Yves H. Kwan, Nick Bultinck, Steven H. Simon, S. A. Parameswaran</i>
<br>
<br>
A striking series of experiments have observed superconductivity in
Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BBG) when the energy bands are flattened by
applying an electrical displacement field. Intriguingly, superconductivity
manifests only at non-zero magnetic fields, or when spin-orbit coupling is
induced in BBG by coupling to a substrate. We present detailed functional
renormalization group and random-phase approximation calculations that provide
a unified explanation for the superconducting mechanism in both cases. Both
calculations yield a purely electronic $p$-wave instability of the
Kohn-Luttinger (KL) type. The latter can be enhanced either by magnetic fields
or Ising spin-orbit coupling, naturally explaining the behaviour seen in
experiments.

<h3>Superconductivity and strong interactions in a tunable moiré  quasiperiodic crystal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00686" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00686</a>
<br>
<i>Aviram Uri, Sergio C. de la Barrera, Mallika T. Randeria, Daniel Rodan-Legrain, Trithep Devakul, Philip J. D. Crowley, Nisarga Paul, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ron Lifshitz, Liang Fu, Raymond C. Ashoori, Pablo Jarillo-Herrero</i>
<br>
<br>
Electronic states in quasiperiodic crystals generally preclude a Bloch
description, rendering them simultaneously fascinating and enigmatic. Owing to
their complexity and relative scarcity, quasiperiodic crystals are
underexplored relative to periodic and amorphous structures. Here, we introduce
a new type of highly tunable quasiperiodic crystal easily assembled from
periodic components. By twisting three layers of graphene with two different
twist angles, we form two moir\'e patterns with incommensurate moir\'e unit
cells. In contrast to many common quasiperiodic structures that are defined on
the atomic scale, the quasiperiodicity in our system is defined on moir\'e
length scales of several nanometers. This novel "moir\'e quasiperiodic crystal"
allows us to tune the chemical potential and thus the electronic system between
a periodic-like regime at low energies and a strongly quasiperiodic regime at
higher energies, the latter hosting a large density of weakly dispersing
states. Interestingly, in the quasiperiodic regime we observe superconductivity
near a flavor-symmetry-breaking phase transition, the latter indicative of the
important role electronic interactions play in that regime. The prevalence of
interacting phenomena in future systems with in situ tunability is not only
useful for the study of quasiperiodic systems, but it may also provide insights
into electronic ordering in related periodic moir\'e crystals. We anticipate
that extending this new platform to engineer quasiperiodic crystals by varying
the number of layers and twist angles, and by using different two-dimensional
components, will lead to a new family of quantum materials to investigate the
properties of strongly interacting quasiperiodic crystals.

<h3>Spectral statistics of a minimal quantum glass model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00703" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00703</a>
<br>
<i>Richard Barney, Michael Winer, Christopher L. Baldwin, Brian Swingle, Victor Galitski</i>
<br>
<br>
Glasses have the interesting feature of being neither integrable nor fully
chaotic. They thermalize quickly within a subspace but thermalize much more
slowly across the full space due to high free energy barriers which partition
the configuration space into sectors. Past works have examined the
Rosenzweig-Porter (RP) model as a minimal quantum model which transitions from
localized to chaotic behavior. In this work we generalize the RP model in such
a way that it becomes a minimal model which transitions from glassy to chaotic
behavior, which we term the "Block Rosenzweig-Porter" (BRP) model. We calculate
the spectral form factors of both models at all timescales. Whereas the RP
model exhibits a crossover from localized to ergodic behavior at the Thouless
timescale, the new BRP model instead crosses over from glassy to fully chaotic
behavior, as seen by a change in the slope of the ramp of the spectral form
factor.

<h3>Exploring energy-composition relationships with Bayesian optimization  for accelerated discovery of inorganic materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00710" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00710</a>
<br>
<i>Andrij Vasylenko, Benjamin Asher, Chris C. Collins, Michael W. Gaultois, George Darling, Matthew S. Dyer, Matthew J. Rosseinsky</i>
<br>
<br>
Computational exploration of the compositional spaces of materials can
provide guidance for synthetic research and thus accelerate the discovery of
novel materials. Most approaches employ high-throughput sampling and focus on
reducing the time for energy evaluation for individual compositions, often at
the cost of accuracy. Here, we present an alternative approach focusing on
effective sampling of the compositional space. Learning algorithm PhaseBO
optimizes the stoichiometry of the potential target material and accelerates
its discovery without compromising the accuracy of energy evaluation.

<h3>Blume-Emery-Griffiths model on Random Graphs</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00712" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00712</a>
<br>
<i>R. Erichsen Jr., Alexandre Silveira, S. G. Magalhaes</i>
<br>
<br>
The Blume-Emery-Griffiths model with a random crystal field is studied in a
random graph architecture, in which the average connectivity is a controllable
parameter. The disordered average over the graph realizations is treated by
replica symmetry formalism of order parameter functions. A self-consistent
equation for the distribution of local fields is derived and numerically solved
by a population dynamics algorithm. The results show that the average
connectivity amounts to changes in the topology of the phase diagrams. Phase
diagrams for representative values of the model parameters are compared with
those obtained for fully connected mean field and renormalization group
approaches.

<h3>Precise Wigner-Weyl calculus for the honeycomb lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00723" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00723</a>
<br>
<i>R. Chobanyan, M. A. Zubkov</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper we propose the precise Wigner-Weyl calculus for the lattice
models defined on the honeycomb lattice. We construct two symbols of operators:
the $\mathscr{B}$-symbol, which is similar to the symbol introduced by F. Buot,
and the $W$ (or, Weyl) symbol. The latter possesses the set of useful
properties. These identities allow us to use it in physical applications. In
particular, we derive topological expression for the Hall conductivity through
the Wigner transformed Green function. This expression may be used for the
description of quantum Hall effect in the systems with artificial honeycomb
lattice, when magnetic flux through the lattice cell is of the order of
elementary quantum of magnetic flux.

<h3>Many-body multipole index and bulk-boundary correspondence</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00800" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00800</a>
<br>
<i>Yasuhiro Tada, Masaki Oshikawa</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose new dipole and quadrupole indices for interacting insulators with
point group symmetries. The proposed indices are defined in terms of many-body
quantum multipole operators combined with the generator of the point group
symmetry. Unlike the original multipole operators, these combined operators
commute with Hamiltonian under the symmetry and therefore their eigenvalues are
quantized. This enables a clear identification of nontrivial multipolar states.
We calculate the multipole indices in representative models and show their
effectiveness as order parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate a bulk-boundary
correspondence: a non-zero index implies the existence of edge/corner states
under the the point group symmetry.

<h3>Inversion Symmetry Breaking in Epitaxial Ultrathin Bi (111) Films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00803" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00803</a>
<br>
<i>Hadass S. Inbar, Muhammad Zubair, Jason T. Dong, Aaron N Engel, Connor P. Dempsey, Yu Hao Chang, Shinichi Nishihaya, Shoaib Khalid, Alexei V. Fedorov, Anderson Janotti, Chris J. Palmstrøm</i>
<br>
<br>
Bismuth films hold promise for potential applications in spintronic devices
and topological one-dimensional edge transport. Yet synthesizing high-quality,
wafer-scale ultrathin bismuth films on non-metallic substrates remains
challenging. Here, we demonstrate the growth of large-area (111) bismuth films
with a single epitaxial domain orientation synthesized on InSb (111)B
substrates and perform angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)
measurements on 1 to 200-bilayer-thick bismuth films. We find evidence of
strong film-substrate interactions, promoting epitaxial stabilization of the
(111) orientation and leading to inversion symmetry breaking. Through scanning
tunneling microscopy, density functional theory, and ARPES, we resolve the
longstanding controversy over the $Z_2$ topological assignment of bismuth and
show that the surface states are topologically trivial. Our results demonstrate
that interfacial bonds prevent the semimetal-to-semiconductor transition
predicted for freestanding bismuth layers, highlighting the importance of
controlled functionalization and surface passivation in two-dimensional
materials.

<h3>Ultra Strong Magnon-Photon Coupling Achieved by Magnetic Films in  Contact with Superconducting Resonators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00804" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00804</a>
<br>
<i>Alberto Ghirri, Claudio Bonizzoni, Marco Affronte, Maksut Maksutoglu, Alberto Mercurio, Omar Di Stefano, Salvatore Savasta</i>
<br>
<br>
Coherent coupling of magnon excitations and microwave photons in a cavity may
disclose new paths to unconventional phenomena and for novel applications.
Here, we show that large couplings and cooperativities can be achieved with YIG
(Yttrium Iron Garnet) films in contact with coplanar resonators made of
superconducting YBCO. Transmission spectra, which are analysed by a modified
Hopfield model, show that the coupling of the dominant magnetic mode with
photons exceeds 0.2 times the cavity frequency, thus demonstrating the
achievement of the ultra strong coupling regime with this architecture.

<h3>High-entropy silicide superconductors with W$_{5}$Si$_{3}$-type  structure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00844" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00844</a>
<br>
<i>Bin Liu, Wuzhang Yang, Guorui Xiao, Qinqing Zhu, Shijie Song, Guang-Han Cao, Zhi Ren</i>
<br>
<br>
We report the synthesis, crystal structure and physical properties of two new
high-entropy silicides (HESs), namely
(Nb$_{0.1}$Mo$_{0.3}$W$_{0.3}$Re$_{0.2}$Ru$_{0.1}$)$_{5}$Si$_{3}$ and
(Nb$_{0.2}$Mo$_{0.3}$W$_{0.3}$Re$_{0.1}$Ru$_{0.1}$)$_{5}$Si$_{3}$. Structural
analysis indicates that both HESs consist of a (nearly) single tetragonal
W$_{5}$Si$_{3}$-type phase (space group $I$4/$mcm$) with a disordered cation
distribution. Electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and specific heat
measurements show that
(Nb$_{0.1}$Mo$_{0.3}$W$_{0.3}$Re$_{0.2}$Ru$_{0.1}$)$_{5}$Si$_{3}$ and
(Nb$_{0.2}$Mo$_{0.3}$W$_{0.3}$Re$_{0.1}$Ru$_{0.1}$)$_{5}$Si$_{3}$ are weakly
coupled bulk superconductors, which represent the first superconducting
high-entropy nonoxide ceramics. In particular, these HESs have higher $T_{\rm
c}$ values (3.2-3.3 K) compared with those of the binary counterparts, and
their $B_{\rm c2}$(0)/$T_{\rm c}$ ratios are the largest among superconductors
of the same structural type.

<h3>Exploring the Relationship Between Softness and Excess Entropy in  Glass-forming Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00866" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00866</a>
<br>
<i>Ian R. Graham, Paulo E. Arratia, Robert A. Riggleman</i>
<br>
<br>
We explore the relationship between a machine-learned structural quantity
(softness) and excess entropy in simulations of supercooled liquids. Excess
entropy is known to scale well the dynamical properties of liquids, but this
quasi-universal scaling is known to breakdown in the supercooled and glassy
regimes. Using numerical simulations, we test whether a local form of the
excess entropy can lead to predictions that derive from softness, which has
been shown to correlate well with the tendency for individual particles to
rearrange. To that end, we explore leveraging softness to compute excess
entropy in the traditional fashion over softness groupings. Our results show
that by computing the excess entropy over softness-binned groupings, we can
build a strong quantitative relationship between the rearrangement barriers
across the explored systems.

<h3>Ultrafast Hot-Carrier cooling in Quasi Freestanding Bilayer Graphene  with Hydrogen Intercalated Atoms</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00882" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00882</a>
<br>
<i>Sachin Sharma, Rachael L. Myers-Ward, David Kurt Gaskill, Ioannis Chatzakis</i>
<br>
<br>
We perform a femtosecond-THz optical pump-probe spectroscopy to investigate
the cooling dynamics of hot carriers in quasi-free standing bilayer epitaxial
graphene. We observed longer decay time constants, in the range of 2.6 to 6.4
ps, compared to previous studies on monolayer graphene, which increase
nonlinearly with excitation intensity. The increased relaxation times are due
to the decoupling of the graphene layer from the SiC substrate after hydrogen
intercalation which increases the distance between graphene and substrate.
Furthermore, our measurements do not show that the supercollision mechanism is
related to the cooling process of the hot carriers, which is ultimately
achieved by electron-optical phonon scattering.

<h3>Spin-Driven Stationary Turbulence in Spinor Bose-Einstein Condensates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00895" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00895</a>
<br>
<i>Deokhwa Hong, Junghoon Lee, Jongmin Kim, Jong Heum Jung, Kyuhwan Lee, Seji Kang, Yong-il Shin</i>
<br>
<br>
We report the observation of stationary turbulence in antiferromagnetic
spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates under radio-frequency magnetic field driving.
The magnetic driving injects energy into the system by spin rotation and the
energy is dissipated via dynamic instability, resulting in the development of
an irregular spin texture in the condensate. With continuous driving, the
spinor condensate evolves into a nonequilibrium steady state with
characteristic spin turbulence. Owing to the low energy scale of spin
excitations, the sample's lifetime is not significantly affected by magnetic
driving. We find that the spin composition of the stationary turbulent state
becomes isotropic at a driving strength comparable to the system's spin
interaction energy and the quadratic Zeeman energy. This work paves the way for
studies of quantum turbulence in a spinor superfluid system.

<h3>Phase transition of parallelizability in assembly systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00909" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00909</a>
<br>
<i>Ikumi Kobayashi, Shin-ichi Sasa</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a phase transition on the feasibility of efficient parallel
assembly. By introducing the parallel efficiency that measures how efficiently
the parallel assembly works, the parallelizable phase is defined by its
positive value. The parallelizable/unparallelizable transition is then
identified by the non-analytic change in the parallel efficiency from a
positive value to zero. We present two analyzable models to demonstrate this
phase transition in the limit of infinite system size.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Rigorous proof of a phase transition of parallelizability in a  one-dimensional structure assembly</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00914" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00914</a>
<br>
<i>Ikumi Kobayashi, Shin-ichi Sasa</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, we prove the existence of a phase transition of
parallelizability in the assembly of one-dimensional chains. By introducing the
parallel efficiency that measures how efficiently the parallel assembly works,
the parallelizable phase is defined by its positive value. The
parallelizable/unparallelizable transition is then identified by the
non-analytic change in the parallel efficiency from a positive value to zero.
By evaluating the parallel efficiency on each side of the transition point, we
show the existence of a phase transition in this system.

<h3>Coupling of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in 1D chains of Fe atoms on Nb(110)</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00966" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00966</a>
<br>
<i>Felix Friedrich, Robin Boshuis, Matthias Bode, Artem Odobesko</i>
<br>
<br>
The hybridization of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in dimers of magnetic impurities
leads to molecular-like bonding and antibonding modes. In many-impurity
systems, the interaction gives rise to YSR bands and can even result in the
formation of a topologically non-trivial superconducting state, characterized
by Majorana fermions at the edges of the system. To obtain a more detailed
understanding of these interactions, we investigate the coupling of YSR states
in short one-dimensional Fe chains on clean Nb(110). We observe a splitting of
the single-atom YSR peaks into multiple states with even or odd spatial
symmetry and identify a peculiar dependence of the even and odd states' energy
position on the chain length.

<h3>Series expansions in closed and open quantum many-body systems with  multiple quasiparticle types</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01000" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01000</a>
<br>
<i>L. Lenke, A. Schellenberger, K. P. Schmidt</i>
<br>
<br>
The established approach of perturbative continuous unitary transformations
(pCUTs) constructs effective quantum many-body Hamiltonians as perturbative
series that conserve the number of one quasiparticle type. We extend the pCUT
method to similarity transformations - dubbed $\mathrm{pcst}^{\texttt{++}}$ -
allowing for multiple quasiparticle types with complex-valued energies. This
enlarges the field of application to closed and open quantum many-body systems
with unperturbed operators corresponding to arbitrary superimposed ladder
spectra. To this end, a generalized counting operator is combined with the
quasiparticle generator for open quantum systems recently introduced by
Schmiedinghoff and Uhrig (arXiv:2203.15532). The $\mathrm{pcst}^{\texttt{++}}$
then yields model-independent block-diagonal effective Hamiltonians and
Lindbladians allowing a linked-cluster expansion in the thermodynamic limit
similar to the conventional pCUT method. We illustrate the application of the
$\mathrm{pcst}^{\texttt{++}}$ method by discussing representative closed, open,
and non-Hermitian quantum systems.

<h3>On the polytypism of layered $\textit{MX}_2$ materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01016" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01016</a>
<br>
<i>Emma H. Wolpert, Simon J. Cassidy, Andrew L. Goodwin</i>
<br>
<br>
We revisit the problem of polytypism in layered $\textit{MX}_2$ materials,
with a view to reinterpreting the phase space accessible to this family. Our
starting point is to develop a simple, constructive and compact label for the
most commonly observed stacking arrangements that is similar to the Glazer
notation used to label tilt systems in perovskites. The key advantage of this
label in the context of $\textit{MX}_2$ systems is that it contains sufficient
information to generate the corresponding stacking sequences uniquely. Using a
related approach, we generate a Cartesian representation of the phase space
containing all possible $\textit{MX}_2$ polytypes, with the most common
structures appearing as limiting cases. We argue that variation in (e.g.
composition, or temperature, or pressure) may allow navigation of this phase
space along continuous paths. This interpretation is shown to be consistent
with the structural evolution of stacking-faulted $\textit{MX}_2$ systems as a
function of temperature and composition. Our study highlights the potential for
controlling composition/structure/property relationships amongst layered
$\textit{MX}_2$ materials in ways that might not previously have been obvious.

Three-body recombination loss in ultracold atoms is a central process for
studying universal few-body systems. Zero-range theory provides the
state-of-the-art framework to analyze corresponding experimental data. However,
this theory cannot explain temperature dependence of three-body parameters
observed in some experiments. That can be attributed to finite-range physics,
which is necessarily present in realistic systems.
To study three-body recombination beyond the zero-range model, we introduce
and examine a hyperspherical model that includes an effective range. Based on
this model, we show that temperature dependence of the zero-range parameters is
sensitive to the distribution of error bars in the experiment. This observation
might help to reconcile existing experimental research and paves the way for
extracting universal properties from the data taken in non-universal parameter
regions.

The recent realizations of the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and MnBi$_4$Te$_7$ benchmark the
(MnBi$_2$Te$_4$)(Bi$_2$Te$_3$)$_n$ family as a promising hotbed for further
QAHE improvements. The family owes its potential to its ferromagnetically (FM)
ordered MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ septuple layers (SL). However, the QAHE realization is
complicated in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and MnBi$_4$Te$_7$ due to the substantial
antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling between the SL. An FM state, advantageous for
the QAHE, can be stabilized by interlacing the SL with an increasing number $n$
of Bi$_2$Te$_3$ layers. However, the mechanisms driving the FM state and the
number of necessary QLs are not understood, and the surface magnetism remains
obscure. Here, we demonstrate robust FM properties in MnBi$_6$Te$_{10}$ ($n =
2$) with $T_C \approx 12$ K and establish their origin in the Mn/Bi intermixing
phenomenon by a combined experimental and theoretical study. Our measurements
reveal a magnetically intact surface with a large magnetic moment, and with FM
properties similar to the bulk. Our investigation thus consolidates the
MnBi$_6$Te$_{10}$ system as perspective for the QAHE at elevated temperatures.

<br>
<br>
In the last two decades, many phase-field models for solid-state sintering
have been published. Two groups of models have emerged, with and without the
contribution of rigid body motion. This paper first describes the previously
published phase-field model with an advection term driven by rigid body motion.
The model is then used to investigate the differences between models with and
without rigid body motion in new benchmark geometries exhibiting markedly
different behavior. Sensitivity studies concerning the parameters of the
rigid-body motion model are conducted and their effects on equilibrium and
kinetic properties explored. In particular, it is shown by simulations that a
shrinkage rate independent of system size requires the inclusion of an
advection term. Finally, the reason behind this behavior is explored and
implications for diffusion-only models are drawn.

<h3>Accurate recipe for predicting valley Linear Weyl phonons in two  dimensions</h3>

<br>
<br>
The discovery of topological quantum states in two-dimensional (2D) systems
is one of the most promising advancements in condensed matter physics. Linear
Weyl point (LWP) phonons have been theoretically investigated in some 2D
materials. Especially, Jin, Wang, and Xu [Nano Lett. 2018, 18, 12, 7755-7760]
proposed in 2018 that the candidates with threefold rotational symmetry at the
corners of the hexagonal Brillouin zone can host LWP phonons with a quantized
valley Berry phase. However, all the candidates with hexagonal lattices may not
host LWP phonons at $K$ ($K'$) high-symmetry points (HSPs). Hence, a more
accurate recipe for LWP phonons in 2D is highly required. This work provides an
exhaustive list of valley LWP phonons at HSPs in 2D by searching the entire 80
layer groups (LGs). We found that the valley LWP phonons can be obtained at
HSPs in 11 of the 80 LGs. Guided by the symmetry analysis, we also contributed
to realizing the ideal 2D material with valley LWP phonons. We identified the
existence of the valley LWP phonons in eleven 2D material candidates with 11
LGs. This work offers a method to search for valley LWPs in 2D phononic systems
and proposes 2D material candidates to obtain the valley LWP phonons.

<h3>Nonlinear Schrodinger equation for a two-dimensional plasma: the  analysis of solitons, breathers, and plane wave stability</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01057" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01057</a>

<br>
<br>
We analytically study nonlinear quasi-monochromatic plasma waves in a
two-dimensional electron system set between the two metal electrodes (gates).
We derive a nonlinear Schrodinger equation for a slow-varying envelope to
describe the waves. We find it to be of either focusing or defocusing type
depending on the parameter qd, where q is the carrier wave vector and d is the
distance between the 2DES and the gates. When qd<1.61, we have the
defocusing-type equation with the solutions in the form of dark plasma solitons
appearing against the background of the stable plane waves. Conversely, for
qd>1.61, the focusing-type equation has the solutions in the form of bright
solitons, and the plane waves are unstable. We also address the appearance of
the simplest type of breathers in the latter case. A detailed description of
the resultant nonlinear waves is given based on the parameters of the
two-dimensional electron system.

<h3>Two-dimensional extended Hubbard model at half-filling</h3>

<i>A. Sherman</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider the extended Hubbard model on a two-dimensional square lattice at
half-filling. The model is investigated using the strong coupling diagram
technique. We sum infinite series of ladder diagrams for an infinite crystal
allowing for full-scale charge and spin fluctuations and the actual short-range
antiferromagnetic order for nonzero temperatures. In agreement with earlier
results, we find the first-order phase transition in the charge subsystem
occurring at $v=v_c\gtrsim U/4$ with $v$ and $U$ the intersite and on-site
Coulomb repulsion constants. The state arising at the transition has
alternating deviations of electron occupations from the mean value on
neighboring sites. Due to fluctuations, these alternating occupation deviations
have short-range order. States on transition sides differ in the sign of the
zero-frequency charge susceptibility at the corner of the Brillouin zone, where
it sharply peaks. For the considered parameters, such behavior is found for
$U\lesssim5t$ with $t$ the hopping constant. The states with alternating
occupations reveal themselves in the electron density of states when it
features the narrow Fermi-level peak. For the insulating case $U\geq 7t$, in
which the transition is not observed, we find a continuous growth of the Mott
gap with $v$.

<br>
<br>
Skyrmions are promising for next-generation spintronic and magnonic devices.
However, their stability and controlled nucleation through chiral interactions
in magnetic films and multilayers remain challenging. Here, we reveal the
potential of moir\'e-engineered 2D magnetic heterostructures to overcome these
challenges. We illustrate our findings through stochastic
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations of moir\'e CrBr3/CrI3 heterostructures. As
a prerequisite for reliable simulations, we develop theoretical models that
involve all spin degrees of freedom and competing interactions in the
heterostructures. In CrBr3/CrI3 bilayers, we successfully establish the
controlled nucleation of field-free moir\'e skyrmion lattices, emerging
specifically in the CrBr3 layer due to its weaker intralayer exchange. By
combining twisted and pristine stackings of CrBr3 and CrI3 layers in a vertical
trilayer geometry, we achieve designable layered 2D skyrmion lattices via the
magnetic proximity effect. Our results uncover a path for fabricating
skyrmion-based functional materials through controllable layer-by-layer
engineering of spin textures in moir\'e magnetic heterostructures.

<br>
<br>
The conflict between strength and toughness is a fundamental problem in
engineering materials design. However, systematic discovery of microstructured
composites with optimal strength-toughness trade-offs has never been
demonstrated due to the discrepancies between simulation and reality and the
lack of data-efficient exploration of the entire Pareto front. Here, we report
a widely applicable pipeline harnessing physical experiments, numerical
simulations, and artificial neural networks to efficiently discover
microstructured designs that are simultaneously tough and strong. Using a
physics-based simulator with moderate complexity, our strategy runs a
data-driven proposal-validation workflow in a nested-loop fashion to bridge the
gap between simulation and reality in high sample efficiency. Without any
prescribed expert knowledge of materials design, our approach automatically
identifies existing toughness enhancement mechanisms that were traditionally
discovered through trial-and-error or biomimicry. We provide a blueprint for
the computational discovery of optimal designs, which inverts traditional
scientific approaches, and is applicable to a wide range of research problems
beyond composites, including polymer chemistry, fluid dynamics, meteorology,
and robotics.

<br>
<br>
Knots on ring polymers tend to be tight. For knots on charged polymers
(polyelectrolytes), electrostatic repulsion among the monomers is considered to
enhance the persistence length and further localize the knots. However, the
effects of counterion condensation on knots behavior are not clear. Here we use
molecular dynamics simulations to systematically study the effect of counterion
condensation on the knot behavior under different electrostatic strength and
solvent quality conditions, with the focus on the knot sizes. We show that
generally counterion condensation \emph{delocalizes} the knots in systems with
strong electrostatic strength. At small to intermediate electrostatic strength,
the knot size and overall chain size and can be positive correlated or negative
correlated, as a result of the interplay between electrostatic correlation and
solvent quality.

The growing skill in the synthesis processes of new materials has intensified
the interest in exploring the properties of systems modeled by more complex
lattices. Two-dimensional super-honeycomb lattices, have been investigated in
metallic organic frameworks. They turned out as a significant route to the
emergence of localized electronic responses, manifested as flat bands in their
structure with topological isolating behavior. A natural inquiry is a complete
analysis of their topological phases in the presence of electronic correlation
effects. Here we analyse of the electron-electron correlation effects via
Hubbard mean-field approximation on the topological phases of 2D and quasi-1D
graphene-Kagome lattices. The 2D spin conductivity phase's diagrams describe
metallic, trivial and topological insulating behaviors, considering different
energy coupling and electronic occupations. Our results pave the way to
smart-engineered nanostructured devices with relevant applications in
spintronics and transport responses.

<h3>A framework for efficient ab initio electronic structure with Gaussian  Process States</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present a general framework for the efficient simulation of realistic
fermionic systems with modern machine learning inspired representations of
quantum many-body states, towards a universal tool for ab initio electronic
structure. These machine learning inspired ansatzes have recently come to the
fore in both a (first quantized) continuum and discrete Fock space
representations, where however the inherent scaling of the latter approach for
realistic interactions has so far limited practical applications. With
application to the 'Gaussian Process State', a recently introduced ansatz
inspired by systematically improvable kernel models in machine learning, we
discuss different choices to define the representation of the computational
Fock space. We show how local representations are particularly suited for
stochastic sampling of expectation values, while also indicating a route to
overcome the discrepancy in the scaling compared to continuum formulated
models. We are able to show competitive accuracy for systems with up to 64
electrons, including a simplified (yet fully ab initio) model of the Mott
transition in three-dimensional hydrogen, indicating a significant improvement
over similar approaches, even for moderate numbers of configurational samples.

<br>
<br>
Topological insulators (TIs) are a promising class of materials for
manipulating the magnetization of an adjacent ferromagnet (FM) through the
spin-orbit torque (SOT) mechanism. However, current studies combining TIs with
conventional FMs present large device-to-device variations, resulting in a
broad distribution of SOT magnitudes. It has been identified that the
interfacial quality between the TI and the FM is of utmost importance in
determining the nature and efficiency of the SOT. To optimize the SOT magnitude
and enable ultra-low-power magnetization switching, an atomically smooth
interface is necessary. To this end, we have developed the growth of a full van
der Waals FM/TI heterostructure by molecular beam epitaxy. The compensated TI
(Bi0.4Sb0.6)2Te3 and ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) were chosen because of their
exceptional crystalline quality, low carrier concentration in BST and
relatively large Curie temperature and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in
FGT. We characterized the magnitude of the SOTs by using thorough harmonic
magnetotransport measurements and showed that the magnetization of an ultrathin
FGT film could be switched with a current density Jc < 10^10 A/m^2. In
comparison to previous studies utilizing traditional FMs, our findings are
highly reliable, displaying little to no variation between devices.

<h3>Superconducting phases of YH9 under pressure</h3>

Yttrium superhydrides has attracted much attention due to their multiple
stoichiometries and excellent superconductivities under high pressure.
Especially, YH9 have a Tc of 243 K, which is the second highest Tc among all
binary hydrides. It exhibits a positive pressure dependence of Tc below 200
GPa, contrary to the results of theoretical prediction. In order to explore the
origin of Tc at low pressure, we extensively investigated the crystal structure
of YH9 at different pressure, and found a distorted cage structure with a
symmetry of Pnma. This phase has the lowest enthalpy at pressure below 220 GPa,
and its X-ray diffraction patterns is consistent with experimental data. Most
importantly, the pressure dependence of Tc in phase Pnma is in line with the
experimental results. Further calculations show the structural distortion
strongly affect the lattice vibration and electron-phonon coupling, leads to
the Pnma phase exhibiting a positive pressure dependence of Tc.

<h3>Leveraging symmetry for an accurate spin-orbit torques characterization  in ferrimagnetic insulators</h3>

<br>
<br>
Spin-orbit torques (SOTs) have emerged as an efficient means to electrically
control the magnetization in ferromagnetic heterostructures. Lately, an
increasing attention has been devoted to SOTs in heavy metal (HM)/magnetic
insulator (MI) bilayers owing to their tunable magnetic properties and
insulating nature. Quantitative characterization of SOTs in HM/MI
heterostructures are, thus, vital for fundamental understanding of charge-spin
interrelations and designing novel devices. However, the accurate determination
of SOTs in MIs have been limited so far due to small electrical signal outputs
and dominant spurious thermoelectric effects caused by Joule heating. Here, we
report a simple methodology based on harmonic Hall voltage detection and
macrospin simulations to accurately quantify the damping-like and field-like
SOTs, and thermoelectric contributions separately in MI-based systems.
Experiments on the archetypical Bi-doped YIG/Pt heterostructure using the
developed method yield precise values for the field-like and damping-like SOTs,
reaching -0.14 and -0.15 mT per 1.7x$10^11$ A/$m^2$, respectively. We further
reveal that current-induced Joule heating changes the spin transparency at the
interface, reducing the spin Hall magnetoresistance and damping-like SOT,
simultaneously. These results and the devised method can be beneficial for
fundamental understanding of SOTs in MI-based heterostructures and designing
new devices where accurate knowledge of SOTs is necessary.

<h3>Growth modes and coupled morphological-compositional modulations in  GaP1-xNx layers grown on nominally (001)-oriented Si substrates</h3>

<i>K. Ben Saddik, S. Fernandez-Garrido, R. Volkov, J. Grandal, N. Borgardt, B. J. Garcia</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigated the chemical beam epitaxy of GaP1-xNx to correlate the growth
parameters with their properties when they are grown on nominally
(001)-oriented Si substrates, as desired for the lattice-matched integration of
optoelectronic devices with the standard Si technology. The growth mode as well
as the chemical, morphological and structural properties of samples prepared
using different growth temperatures and N precursor fluxes were analyzed by
RHEED, XRD, RBS, NRA, EDX spectroscopy, AFM and TEM. Our results show that, up
to x = 0.04, it is possible to synthesize smooth and chemically homogeneous
GaP1-xNx layers with a high-structural quality in a 2D fashion, namely,
layer-by-layer. For a given N mole fraction, the layer-by-layer growth mode is
favored by lowering the growth temperature while decreasing the N precursor
flux. As the flux of the N precursor is increased at a given temperature to
enhance N incorporation, the quality of the layers degrades upon exceeding a
temperature-dependent threshold; above this threshold, the growing layer
experiences a growth mode transition from 2D to 3D after reaching a critical
thickness of a few nm. Following that transition, the morphology and the
chemical composition become modulated along the [110] direction with a period
of several tens of nm. The surface morphology is then characterized by the
formation of {113}-faceted wires, while the N concentration is enhanced at the
troughs formed in between adjacent (113) and (-1-13) facets. We conclude on the
feasibility of fabricating homogeneous thick GaP1-xNx layers lattice matched to
Si (x = 0.021) or even with N content up to x=0.04. The possibility of
exceeding a N mole fraction of 0.04 without inducing coupled
morphological-compositional modulations has also been demonstrated when the
layer thickness is kept below the critical value for the 2D-3D growth mode
transition.

<h3>Encounter-based model of a run-and-tumble particle II: absorption at  sticky boundaries</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01158" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01158</a>
<br>
<i>Paul C. Bressloff</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper we develop an encounter-based model of a run-and-tumble
particle (RTP) confined to a finite interval $[0,L]$ with partially absorbing,
sticky boundaries at both ends. We assume that the particle switches between
two constant velocity states $\pm v$ at a rate $\alpha$. Whenever the particle
hits a boundary, it becomes stuck by pushing on the boundary until either a
tumble event reverses the swimming direction or it is permanently absorbed. We
formulate the absorption process by identifying the first passage time (FPT)
for absorption with the event that the time $A(t)$ spent attached to either
wall up to time $t$ (the occupation time) crosses some random threshold
$\hat{A}$. Taking $\Psi({a})\equiv\mathbb{P}[\hat{A}\gt{a}]$ to be an
exponential distribution, $\Psi[{a}]=e^{-\kappa_0a}$, we show that the joint
probability density for particle position $X(t)$ and velocity state
$\sigma(t)=\pm $ satisfies a well-defined boundary value problem (BVP) with
$\kappa_0$ representing a constant absorption rate. The solution of this BVP
determines the so-called occupation time propagator, which is the joint
probability density for the triplet $(X(t),A(t),\sigma(t))$. The propagator is
then used to incorporate more general models of absorption based on
non-exponential (non-Markovian) distributions $\Psi(a)$. We illustrate the
theory by calculating the mean FPT (MFPT) and splitting probabilities for
absorption. We also show how our previous results for partially absorbing,
non-sticky boundaries can be recovered in an appropriate limit. Absorption now
depends on the number of collisions $\ell(t)$ of the RTP with the boundary.
Finally, we extend the theory by taking absorption to depend on the individual
occupation times at the two ends.

<br>

Spontaneous symmetry breaking is ubiquitous phenomenon in nature. One of the
defining features of symmetry broken phases is that the large system size limit
and the vanishing external field limit do not commute. In this work, we study a
family of extensions of the $N$-state clock model. We find that the exact
symmetry and the ground state degeneracy under the periodic boundary condition
heavily depend on the system size, although the model has the manifest
translation symmetry. In particular, the ground state can be unique and all
excitations are gapped even when the phase exhibits non-commutativity of the
two limits. Our model hence poses a question on the standard understanding of
spontaneous symmetry breaking.

In a nanowire (NW) of a three-dimensional topological insulator (TI), the
quantum-confinement of topological surface states leads to a peculiar subband
structure that is useful for generating Majorana bound states. Top-down
fabrication of TINWs from a high-quality thin film would be a scalable
technology with great design flexibility, but there has been no report on
top-down-fabricated TINWs where the chemical potential can be tuned to the
charge neutrality point (CNP). Here we present a top-down fabrication process
for bulk-insulating TINWs etched from high-quality
(Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_2$Te$_3$ thin films without degradation. We show that the
chemical potential can be gate-tuned to the CNP and the resistance of the NW
presents characteristic oscillations as functions of the gate voltage and the
parallel magnetic field, manifesting the TI-subband physics. We further
demonstrate the superconducting proximity effect in these TINWs, preparing the
groundwork for future devices to investigate Majorana bound states.

In this paper, first, we present a general formulation to investigate the
ground-state and elementary excitations of an excitonic insulator (EI) in real
materials. In addition, we discuss the out-of-equilibrium state induced (albeit
transiently) by high-intensity light illumination of a conventional
two-dimensional (2D) insulator. We then, present various band-structure models
which allow us to study the transition from a conventional insulator to an EI
in 2D materials as a function of the dielectric constant, the conventional
insulator gap (and chemical potential), the bandwidths of the conduction and
valence bands and the Bravais lattice unit-cell size. One of the goals of this
investigation is to determine which range of these experimentally determined
parameters to consider in order to find the best candidate materials to realize
the excitonic insulator. The numerical solution to the EI gap equation for
various band-structures shows a significant and interesting momentum-dependence
of the EI gap function $\Delta(\vec k)$ and of the zero-temperature electron
and hole momentum-distribution across the Brillouin zone. Last, we discuss that
these features can be detected by tunneling microscopy

Candidate materials for the Kitaev spin liquid generically have residual
interactions beyond the Kitaev coupling. It therefore becomes necessary to
understand how signatures of the quantum spin liquid, e.g., fractionalization
of the spin excitations, are affected by the presence of these interactions.
Recently it was shown that phonon dynamics is an indirect but effective probe
to study fractionalized excitations in the Kitaev spin liquid. Ultrasound
experiments can measure sound attenuation, which should show characteristic
temperature and angular dependence of the sound attenuation coefficient if the
scattering of phonons happens predominantly on Majorana fermions. So far the
computation of the sound attenuation was only done in the pure spin-phonon
coupled Kitaev model, without taking into account residual interactions. In
order to understand experimental signatures, here we present a mean-field study
of the sound attenuation in the generalized $J$-$K$-$\Gamma$ model, which is
relevant to candidate materials. Our findings show that as long as the system
is in the spin liquid phase, characteristic features of the sound attenuation
remain observable even in the presence of residual interactions.

peculiar feature is the warping of the electronic dispersion relations, which
are not isotropic even in the vicinity of the band edge. When the exciton, all
important for the semiconductor optical properties, is considered, this problem
is usually handled by using some kind of angular averaging procedure, that
would restore the isotropy of the hole effective dispersion relations. In the
present paper, we consider the problem of the exciton ground-state energy for
semiconductors with zinc-blende crystal structure, and we solve it exactly by a
numerical treatment, taking fully into account the warping of the valence band.
In the resulting four-dimensional problem, we first show exactly that the
exciton ground state is fourfold degenerate. We then explore the ground-state
energy across the full range of allowed Luttinger parameters. We find that the
correction due to warping may in principle be quite large. However, for the
semiconductors with available data for the band structure we have considered,
the correction turns out to be in the $10\% - 15\%$ range.

Nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of the magnetic susceptibility of
superfluid $^3$He imbibed in anisotropic aerogel reveal anomalous behavior at
low temperatures. Although the frequency shift clearly identifies a
low-temperature phase as the $B$ phase, the magnetic susceptibility does not
display the expected decrease associated with the formation of the
opposite-spin Cooper pairs. This susceptibility anomaly appears to be the
predicted high-field behavior corresponding to the Ising-like magnetic
character of surface Andreev bound states within the planar aerogel structures.

The force autocorrelation function, a concept of fundamental interest in
statistical mechanics, encodes the effect of interactions on the dynamics of a
tagged particle. In equilibrium, the correlation is believed to decay
monotonically in time which is a hallmark signature of slowing down of the
dynamics of the tagged particle due to interactions. Here we analytically show
that in odd-diffusive systems, which are characterized by a diffusion tensor
with antisymmetric elements, the force autocorrelation function can become
negative and even exhibit temporal oscillations. %Remarkably this holds
regardless of the dilute limit where collisions are rare. We further
demonstrate that, despite the isotropy, the knowledge of force autocorrelation
function alone is not sufficient to determine the self-diffusion coefficient:
the full autocorrelation tensor is required and contains an antisymmetric part.
These unusual properties translate into enhanced dynamics of the tagged
particle quantified via the self-diffusion coefficient that, remarkably,
increases due to particle interactions.

The generalized Langevin equation with an exponential kernel is used to
analyze memory effects on the optimal work done by a Brownian particle in a
heat bath and subjected to a harmonic moving potential. The generalized
overdamping scenario is also investigated. Several facts emerge in these more
precise descriptions using the same initial conditions of the Markovian which
lead the particle to do mechanical work against the field. Compared with the
results obtained with the latter, the memory fades the discontinuities observed
in the highly underdamped regime, which suggests that this trait is a
consequence of the Markov approximation as well as the dependence of the
different dynamical susceptibilities with the external field. Unlike the
overdamped Markovian, work is done by the external field in the analog
generalized counterpart. A detailed calculation of the rate of entropy
production gives negative values. It is mathematically correct because the
dynamics deal with a reduced description of the degrees of freedom of the bath.
The theory then requires improving the treatment of them to restore the second
law and thus to get the results with the required thermodynamics consistency.

<h3>Computing chemical potentials of adsorbed or confined fluids</h3>

The chemical potential of adsorbed or confined fluids provides insight into
their unique thermodynamic properties and determines adsorption isotherms.
However, it is often difficult to compute this quantity from atomistic
simulations using existing statistical mechanical methods. We introduce a
computational framework that utilizes static structure factors, thermodynamic
integration and free energy perturbation, for calculating the absolute chemical
potential of fluids. For demonstration, we apply the method to compute the
adsorption isotherms of carbon dioxide in a metal-organic framework (MOF) and
water in carbon nanotubes.

The system consists of a Brownian particle immersed in a heat bath trapped in
optical tweezers with a time-dependent strength acting as an external protocol.
In [Phys. Rev. Letts., 98:108301, 2007] the optimal mean work in the overdamped
regime was thoroughly calculated by assuming the work must be averaged over the
distribution of the initial position of the particle. The present research
assumes instead the solution of the Langevin equation for any given initial
position and its average done over the noise distribution. Therefore, this
proposal extends in a more general sense the results already published,
including the appearance of Maxwell's demon for particular initial conditions
which is analyzed in terms of entropy production rate and the mutual
information obtained by measuring the particle position. The proposed research
has the advantage of being able to be compared with data from numerical
simulations.

<h3>Super-frustration in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate introduced by an  optical lattice</h3>

Dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates can form arrays of spatially distinct
droplets with hexagonal symmetry on top of a small background density in what's
known as the supersolid phase. Here we consider the application of a square
optical lattice to such a system. The 4-fold symmetry of the lattice, and the
spacing set by it, competes with the intrinsic 6-fold symmetry and spacing of
the dipolar droplets in the unperturbed ground state. By developing a graphics
processing unit enhanced solver to the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we
find that the application of the lattice can lead to frustration for certain
lattice parameters while maintaining phase coherence between droplets, and thus
we consider such states super-frustrated. We additionally see second-order
phase transitions as a function of lattice depth and glassiness characterized
by a deeply degenerate ground state manifold.

We consider the R\'enyi-$\alpha$ tripartite information $I_3^{(\alpha)}$ of
three adjacent subsystems in the stationary state emerging after global
quenches in noninteracting spin chains from both homogeneous and bipartite
states. We identify settings in which $I_3^{(\alpha)}$ remains nonzero also in
the limit of infinite lengths and develop a field theory description. We map
the calculation into a Riemann-Hilbert problem with a piecewise constant matrix
for a doubly connected domain. We find an explicit solution for $\alpha=2$ and
an implicit one for $\alpha>2$. In the latter case, we develop a rapidly
convergent perturbation theory that we use to derive analytic formulae
approximating $I_3^{(\alpha)}$ with outstanding accuracy.
