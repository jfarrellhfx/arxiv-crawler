<h3>Spin imaging of Poiseuille flow of viscous electronic fluid</h3>

Recent progress in fabricating high-quality conductors with small densities
of defects has initiated the studies of the viscous electron fluid and has
motivated the search for the evidences of the hydrodynamic regime of electron
transport. In this work we come up with the spin imaging technique allowing us
to attest to the emergence of electron hydrodynamic flows. Based on numerical
calculations we demonstrate that the injected electron spin density is
inhomogeneous across the channel when the viscous electron fluid forms the
Poiseuille flow. We also argue that the Hanle curves at different positions
across the channel acquire relative phase shifts resulting from the variation
of the electron drift velocity in inhomogeneous hydrodynamic flows. The studied
effects can be employed to evidence and study the viscous electron fluid
non-invasively.

<h3>Signatures of non-local conductivity in near-field microscopy</h3>

We propose and theoretically substantiate a new method to study the non-local
conductivity of two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) using the tools of
near-field microscopy. We show that the height dependence of induced dipole
moment of illuminated near-field probe is substantially different for various
transport regimes of charge carriers in 2DES. For hydrodynamic transport
regime, the induced dipole moment scales as $z_0^{-2}$, where $z_0$ is the
elevation of probe above the 2DES. Both for Drude and classical ballistic
regimes of conduction, the dipole moment scales as $z_0^{-3}$. In the former
case, the dipole moment is carrier density-independent, while in the latter it
largely depends on carrier density. More generally, we find that the induced
dipole moment of the probe is proportional to the Laplace transform of
wave-vector dependent conductivity and inverse dielectric function of 2DES over
the wave vectors $q$. Our results should provide a simple tool for studies of
non-local conductivity in solids that was challenging to address with other
techniques.
