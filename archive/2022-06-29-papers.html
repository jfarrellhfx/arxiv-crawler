<h3>Active buckling of pressurized spherical shells : Monte Carlo Simulation</h3>

We study the buckling of pressurized spherical shells by Monte Carlo
simulations in which the detailed balance is explicitly broken -- thereby
driving the shell active, out of thermal equilibrium. Such a shell typically
has either higher (active) or lower (quiescent) fluctuations compared to one in
thermal equilibrium depending on how the detailed balance is broken. We show
that for the same set of elastic parameters, a shell that is not buckled in
thermal equilibrium can be buckled if turned active. Similarly, a shell that is
buckled in thermal equilibrium can unbuckle if turned quiescent. Based on this
result, we suggest that it is possible to experimentally design microscopic
elastic shells whose buckling can be optically controlled.

<h3>Ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory</h3>

We introduce a new universal framework describing fluctuations and
correlations in quantum and classical many-body systems, at the Euler
hydrodynamic scale of space and time. The framework adapts the ideas of the
conventional macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) to systems that support
ballistic transport. The resulting ``ballistic MFT'' (BMFT) is solely based on
the Euler hydrodynamics data of the many-body system. Within this framework,
mesoscopic observables are classical random variables depending only on the
fluctuating conserved densities, and Euler-scale fluctuations are obtained by
deterministically transporting thermodynamic fluctuations via the Euler
hydrodynamics. Using the BMFT, we show that long-range correlations in space
generically develop over time from long-wavelength inhomogeneous initial states
in interacting models. This result, which we verify by numerical calculations,
challenges the long-held paradigm that at the Euler scale, fluid cells may be
considered uncorrelated. We also show that the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation
theorem for non-equilibrium ballistic transport follows purely from
time-reversal invariance of the Euler hydrodynamics. We check the validity of
the BMFT by applying it to integrable systems, and in particular the hard-rod
gas, with extensive simulations that confirm our analytical results.

<h3>Universal Poisson statistics of a passive tracer diffusing in dilute active suspensions</h3>

The statistics of a passive tracer immersed in a suspension of active
self-propelled particles (swimmers) is derived from first principles by
considering a perturbative expansion of the tracer interaction with the
microscopic swimmer field. To first order in the swimmer density, the tracer
statistics is exactly represented as a spatial Poisson process combined with
independent swimmer-tracer scattering events, rigorously reducing the
multi-particle dynamics to two-body interactions. The Poisson representation is
valid in any dimensions and for arbitrary interaction forces and swimmer
dynamics. It provides in particular an analytical derivation of the coloured
Poisson process introduced in [K. Kanazawa et al.; Nature 579, 364 (2020)]
highlighting that such a non-Markovian process can be obtained from Markovian
dynamics by a variable transformation.
