<h3>Decoupling of rotation and translation at the colloidal glass transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01956" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01956</a>
<br>
<i>John Geiger, Niklas Grimm, Matthis Fuchs, Andreas Zumbusch</i>
<p>Little is known about the coupling of rotation and translation in dense
systems. Here, we report results of confocal fluorescence microscopy where
simultaneous recording of translational and rotational particle trajectories
from a bidisperse colloidal dispersion is achieved by spiking the samples with
rotational probe particles. The latter consist of colloidal particles
containing two fluorescently labelled cores suited for tracking the particle's
orientation. A comparison of the experimental data with event driven Brownian
simulations gives insight into the system's structure and dynamics close to the
glass transition and sheds new light onto the translation-rotation coupling.
The data show that with increasing volume fractions, translational dynamics
slows down drastically, whereas rotational dynamics changes very little. We
find convincing agreement between simulation and experiments, even though the
simulations neglect far-field hydrodynamic interactions. An additional analysis
of the glass transition following mode coupling theory works well for the
structural dynamics but indicates a decoupling of the diffusion of the smaller
particle species. The shear stress correlations do not decorrelate in the
simulated glass states and are not affected by rotational motion.

<h3>Thermodynamics of active matter: Tracking dissipation across scales</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02252" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02252</a>
<br>
<i>Robin Bebon, Joshua F. Robinson, Thomas Speck</i>
<p>The concept of entropy has been pivotal in the formulation of thermodynamics.
For systems driven away from thermal equilibrium, a comparable role is played
by entropy production and dissipation. Here we provide a comprehensive picture
how local dissipation due to effective chemical events manifests on large
scales in active matter. We start from a microscopic model for a single
catalytic particle involving explicit solute molecules and show that it
undergoes directed motion. Leveraging stochastic thermodynamics, we calculate
the average entropy production rate for interacting particles. We then show how
the model of active Brownian particles emerges in a certain limit and we
determine the entropy production rate on the level of the hydrodynamic
equations. Our results augment the model of active Brownian particles with
rigorous expressions for the dissipation that cannot be inferred from their
equations of motion, and we illustrate consequences for wall aggregation and
motility-induced phase separation. Notably, our bottom-up approach reveals that
a naive application of the Onsager currents yields an incorrect expression for
the local dissipation.

<h3>Aqueous Laponite Dispersions are Attractive Gels, Not Repulsive Wigner  Glasses: A Critical Commentary</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01917" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01917</a>
<br>
<i>Yogesh M Joshi, Shrajesh Patel, Khushboo Suman</i>
<p>An aqueous dispersion of Laponite has been studied in the literature for over
the past three decades. Typically, the aqueous dispersion of Laponite undergoes
incessant evolution of its microstructure, wherein its elastic modulus and the
mean relaxation time show a continuous increase as a function of time. A
considerable amount of discussion has revolved around the nature of this
dispersion, specifically whether it can be classified as a repulsive Wigner
glass state, characterized by disconnected Laponite particles stabilized by
electrostatic repulsions, or an attractive gel state, in which the particles
form a percolated space-spanning network. The proponents of the Wigner glass
state also conjecture that this system experiences a glass-glass transition
after a period of two days has elapsed since its preparation. In this
commentary, we explore this topic from a rheological point of view analyzing
the published literature and performing new experiments. Aided by additional
evidence from the literature, we propose that rheological behavior
overwhelmingly suggests that an aqueous dispersion of Laponite undergoes sol -
attractive gel transition and remains in the attractive gel state over at least
up to 7 days without undergoing any additional transition. Importantly,
rheology, despite being a macroscopic tool governed by principles of mechanics,
offers profound insight into the microstructure of this particular system. The
corresponding analysis conclusively determines the state of an aqueous
dispersion of Laponite to be an attractive gel.

<h3>Defining classical and quantum chaos through adiabatic transformations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01927" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01927</a>
<br>
<i>Cedric Lim, Kirill Matirko, Anatoli Polkovnikov, Michael O. Flynn</i>
<p>We propose a formalism which defines chaos in both quantum and classical
systems in an equivalent manner by means of adiabatic transformations. The
complexity of adiabatic transformations which preserve classical time-averaged
trajectories (quantum eigenstates) in response to Hamiltonian deformations
serves as a measure of chaos. This complexity is quantified by the (properly
regularized) fidelity susceptibility. Our exposition clearly showcases the
common structures underlying quantum and classical chaos and allows us to
distinguish integrable, chaotic but non-thermalizing, and ergodic regimes. We
apply the fidelity susceptibility to a model of two coupled spins and
demonstrate that it successfully predicts the universal onset of chaos, both
for finite spin $S$ and in the classical limit $S\to\infty$. Interestingly, we
find that finite $S$ effects are anomalously large close to integrability.

<h3>Interferometry of non-Abelian band singularities and Euler class  topology</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01928" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01928</a>
<br>
<i>Oliver Breach, Robert-Jan Slager, F. Nur Ünal</i>
<p>In systems with a real Bloch Hamiltonian band nodes can be characterised by a
non-Abelian frame-rotation charge. The ability of these band nodes to
annihilate pairwise is path dependent, since by braiding nodes in adjacent gaps
the sign of their charges can be changed. Here, we theoretically construct and
numerically confirm two concrete methods to experimentally probe these
non-Abelian braiding processes and charges in ultracold atomic systems. We
consider a coherent superposition of two bands that can be created by moving
atoms through the band singularities at some angle in momentum space. Analyzing
the dependency on the frame charges, we demonstrate an interferometry scheme
passing through two band nodes, which reveals the relative frame charges and
allows for measuring the multi-gap topological invariant. The second method
relies on a single wavepacket probing two nodes sequentially, where the frame
charges can be determined from the band populations. Our results present a
feasible avenue for measuring non-Abelian charges of band nodes and the
experimental verification of braiding procedures directly, which can be applied
in a variety of settings including the recently discovered anomalous
non-Abelian phases arising under periodic driving.

<h3>Dichroic cavity mode splitting and lifetimes from interactions with a  ferromagnetic metal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01929" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01929</a>
<br>
<i>Henning G. Hugdal, Eirik Jaccheri Høydalsvik, Sol H. Jacobsen</i>
<p>We study the effect of ferromagnetic metals (FM) on the circularly polarized
modes of an electromagnetic cavity and show that broken time-reversal symmetry
leads to a dichroic response of the cavity modes. With one spin-split band, the
Zeeman coupling between the FM electrons and cavity modes leads to an
anticrossing for mode frequencies comparable to the spin splitting. However,
this is only the case for one of the circularly polarized modes, while the
other is unaffected by the FM, allowing for the determination of the
spin-splitting of the FM using polarization-dependent transmission experiments.
Moreover, we show that for two spin-split bands, also the lifetimes of the
cavity modes display a polarization-dependent response. The reduced lifetime of
modes of only one polarization could potentially be used to engineer and
control circularly polarized cavities.

<h3>Observation of Liquid Glass in Molecular Dynamics Simulations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01938" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01938</a>
<br>
<i>Mohammed Alhissi, Andreas Zumbusch, Matthias Fuchs</i>
<p>Molecular anisotropy plays an important role in the glass transition of a
liquid. Recently, a novel glass state has been discovered by optical microscopy
experiments on suspensions of ellipsoidal colloids. 'Liquid glass' is a
disordered analog of a nematic liquid crystal, where rotation motion is
hindered but particles diffuse freely. Global nematic order is suppressed as
clusters of aligned particles intertwine. We perform Brownian dynamics
simulations to test the structure and dynamics of a dense system of soft
ellipsoidal particles. As seen in experiments and in accordance with
predictions from mode coupling theory, on the time scale of our simulations
rotation motion is frozen but translation motion persists in liquid glass.
Analyses of the dynamic structure functions for translation and rotation
corroborates the presence of two separate glass transitions for rotation and
translation, respectively. Even though the equilibrium state should be a
nematic, aligned structures remain small and orientational order rapidly decays
with increasing size. Long-wavelength fluctuations are remnants of the
isotropic-nematic transition.

<h3>Generation of gauge magnetic fields in a kagome spin liqud candidate  using the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01946" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01946</a>
<br>
<i>Byungmin Kang, Patrick A. Lee</i>
<p>The recent discovery of magnetization oscillations in a kagome spin liquid
candidate motivates us to examine the origin of the gauge magnetic field term
that can give rise to quantum oscillations of fermionic spinons. We find that
in the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and an average spin
polarization, the spin permutation operator around the unit cell acquires an
imaginary part, and a net gauge flux is generated through the unit cell of the
kagome lattice. This new mechanism of gauge field generation can account for
the strength of the gauge magnetic field needed to explain the experiment.

<h3>Bulk synthesis of Zn$_3$WN$_4$ via solid-state metathesis</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01964" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01964</a>
<br>
<i>Christopher L. Rom, Shaun O'Donnell, Kayla Huang, Ryan A. Klein, Morgan J. Kramer, Rebecca W. Smaha, Andriy Zakutayev</i>
<p>Ternary nitrides are of growing technological importance, with applications
as semiconductors, catalysts, and magnetic materials; however, new synthetic
tools are needed to advance materials discovery efforts. Here, we show that
Zn$_3$WN$_4$ can be synthesized via metathesis reactions between Li$_6$WN$_4$
and Zn$X_2$ ($X$ = Br, Cl, F). In situ synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction and
differential scanning calorimetry show that the reaction onset is correlated
with the Zn$X_2$ melting point and that product purity is inversely correlated
with the reaction's exothermicity. High resolution synchrotron powder X-ray
diffraction measurements show that this bulk synthesis produces a structure
with substantial cation ordering, as opposed to the disordered structure
initially discovered via thin film sputtering. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
reveals that Zn$_3$WN$_4$ powders exhibit two optical absorption onsets at 2.5
eV and 4.0 eV, indicating wide-bandgap semiconducting behavior and suggesting a
small amount of structural disorder. We hypothesize that this synthesis
strategy is generalizable because many potential Li-M-N precursors (where M is
a metal) are available for synthesizing new ternary nitride materials. This
work introduces a promising synthesis strategy that will accelerate the
discovery of novel functional ternary nitrides and other currently inaccessible
materials.

<h3>Minimal Model for Chirally Induced Spin Selectivity: Spin-orbit  coupling, tunneling and decoherence</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01994" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01994</a>
<br>
<i>Miguel Mena, Bertrand Berche, Ernesto Medina</i>
<p>Chirally Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) is a transport phenomenon observed
in both linear and non-linear regimes, where the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) acts
as the key driver and electron tunneling serves as the dominant mechanism for
charge transfer. Despite SOC's inherent time-reversal symmetry (TRS)
preservation, conventional reciprocity relations limit spin polarization and
the differential treatment of spin species. In experimental systems, an
additional factor, spin-independent decoherence, disrupts TRS and reciprocity.
We introduce decoherence using the Buttiker voltage probe within the scattering
matrix framework. Our results reveal the importance of under-the-barrier
decoherence as an order-of-magnitude polarization enhancement mechanism.
Polarization arises by the disruption of spin precession around the spin-orbit
magnetic field with a new spin component along the field direction. The
alignment of polarization depends on interference effects produced by the
voltage probe. We discuss the connection of our model to a more realistic
decoherence mechanism in molecular systems.

<h3>Strong and Highly Switchable Soft Sticky Adhesives</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02002" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02002</a>
<br>
<i>Qianfeng Yin, Yilmaz Arin Manav, Yichen Wan, Benyamin Davaji, Ruobing Bai</i>
<p>Many biological systems can form strong adhesion to various materials with
complex shapes. The adhesion is further switchable between strongly adhering
and completely non-adhering in a simple and fast manner. By contrast, no
engineering system has yet achieved the same robust adherence and switching.
This limitation severely hinders the advancement of several emerging
technologies including biomimetic robots, assembly-based manufacturing,
precision medicine, wearable and implantable devices, as well as on-demand
material dismantling and recycling for sustainability. Here we present a design
approach for strong and highly switchable adhesion by synergizing the surface
stickiness, bulk energy dissipation, and stimuli-responsive polymer chains in a
thermo-switchable soft sticky adhesive. The adhesive has a high adhesion
strength of about 80 kPa with diverse materials at room temperature. The
adhesion is highly switchable to near-vanishing (about 0.6 kPa) at an elevated
temperature due to the thermo-responsive surface polymer chain retraction. This
adhesion switching is reversible and repeatable for many cycles, enabling
selective pick-and-release of objects with various materials, shapes, sizes,
and weights. The switching time is around 10 s with an adhesive layer of 1 mm,
governed by thermal conduction through the adhesive, faster than or comparable
to most state-of-the-art methods. The adhesive is self-healing, and can be
recycled, dried, stored, reswollen, and reused with nearly intact adhesion and
switching properties. The synergistic design combining strong adhesion and
stimuli-responsive switching can be potentially extended to various polymer
systems, and further enhanced by optimized surface architectures.

<h3>Truncated string-state-space approach and its application to  non-integrable spin 1/2 Heisenberg chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02018" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02018</a>
<br>
<i>Jiahao Yang, Jianda Wu</i>
<p>By circumventing the difficulty of obtaining exact string state solutions to
Bethe ansatz equations, we devise a truncated string-state-space approach for
investigating spin dynamics in non-integrable spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain
subjected to staggered field at various magnetization. The obtained dynamical
spectra reveal a series of elastic peaks at integer multiples of the ordering
wavevector $Q$, indicating the presence of multi-$Q$ Bethe string states within
the ground state. The spectrum exhibits a separation between different string
continua as the strength of the staggered field increases at low
magnetization,reflecting the confinement of the Bethe strings. The approach has
successfully provided a unified string-state-based picture for understanding
spin dynamics observed in various phases of quasi-1D antiferromagnet $\rm
YbAlO_3$ \cite{Yang_CBS_2023}, and also paves a way for investigating
low-dimensional non-integrable systems.

<h3>Accelerated Band Offset Prediction in Semiconductor Interfaces with DFT  and Deep Learning</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02021" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02021</a>
<br>
<i>Kamal Choudhary, Kevin Garrity</i>
<p>We introduce a computational framework to predict band offsets of
semiconductor interfaces using density functional theory (DFT) and graph neural
networks (GNN). As a first step, we benchmark DFT based work function and
electron affinity values for surfaces against experimental data with accuracies
of 0.29 eV and 0.39 eV. Similarly, we evaluate band offset values using
independent unit (IU) and alternate slab junction (ASJ) models leading to
accuracies of 0.45 eV and 0.22 eV respectively. During ASJ structure
generation, we use Zur's algorithm along with a unified GNN force-field to
tackle the conformation challenges of interface design. At present, we have 300
surface work functions calculated with DFT, from which we can compute 44850 IU
band offsets as well as 250 directly calculated ASJ band offsets. Finally, as
the space of all possible heterojunctions is too large to simulate with DFT, we
develop generalized GNN models to quickly predict band edges with an accuracy
of 0.26 eV. We use such models to predict relevant quantities including
ionization potentials, electron affinities, and IU-based band offsets. We
establish simple rules using the above models to pre-screen potential
semiconductor devices from a vast pool of nearly 1.4 trillion candidate
interfaces.

<h3>Intrinsic insulating transport characteristics in low-carrier density  EuCd2As2 films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02026" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02026</a>
<br>
<i>Shinichi Nishihaya, Ayano Nakamura, Mizuki Ohno, Markus Kriener, Yuto Watanabe, Masashi Kawasaki, Masaki Uchida</i>
<p>Searching for an ideal magnetic Weyl semimetal hosting only a single pair of
Weyl points has been a focal point for systematic clarification of its unique
magnetotransport derived from the interplay between topology and magnetization.
Among the candidates, triangular-lattice antiferromagnet EuCd$_2$As$_2$ has
been attracting special attention due to the prediction of the ideal Weyl
semimetal phase in the ferromagnetic state, however, transport properties of
low-carrier density samples have remained elusive. Here we report molecular
beam epitaxy growth of EuCd$_2$As$_2$ films, achieving low-hole density in the
range of $10^{15}$-$10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$ at low temperature. Transport
measurements of such low-carrier density films reveal an insulating behavior
with an activation gap of about 200 meV, which persists even in the
field-induced ferromagnetic state. Our work provides an important experimental
clue that EuCd$_2$As$_2$ is intrinsically insulating, contrary to the previous
prediction.

<h3>Anomalous upper critical field in the quasicrystal superconductor  Ta$_{1.6}$Te</h3>

<br>
<i>Taichi Terashima, Yuki Tokumoto, Kotaro Hamano, Takako Konoike, Naoki Kikugawa, Keiichi Edagawa</i>
<p>Superconductivity in quasicrystals poses a new challenge in condensed matter
physics. We measured the resistance and ac magnetic susceptibility of a
Ta$_{1.6}$Te dodecagonal quasicrystal, which is superconducting below $T_c
\sim$ 1 K. We show that the upper critical field increases linearly with a
large slope of $-$4.4 T/K with decreasing temperature down to 0.04 K, with no
tendency to level off. The extrapolated zero-temperature critical field exceeds
the Pauli limit by a factor of 2.3. We also observed flux-flow resistance with
thermally activated behavior and an irreversibility field that is distinct from
the upper critical field. We discuss these peculiarities in terms of the
nonuniform superconducting gap and spin--orbit interaction in quasicrystal
structures.

<br>
<i>H. Okabe, M. Hiraishi, A. Koda, S. Takeshita, K. M. Kojima, I. Yamauchi, T. Ohsawa, N. Ohashi, H. Sato, R. Kadono</i>
<p>The electronic and magnetic states of $\beta$-MnO$_{2}$ in terms of hydrogen
impurities have been investigated by muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR) technique
combined with density-functional theory (DFT) calculations for muon as
pseudo-hydrogen. We found that 85% of implanted muons are localized in the
oxygen channels of the rutile structure and behave as interstitial protons
(Mu$^{+})$ except those (7.6%) forming a charge-neutral state (Mu$^{0})$ at 2.3
K, which indicates that interstitial hydrogen acts as a shallow donor within
less than 0.1 meV of ionization energy. The residual 15% of muons are
attributed to those related to lattice imperfection as Mn vacancies. Detailed
analyses combined with DFT approach suggested that the muon is localized at the
center of the oxygen channel due to its large zero-point vibration energy.

<h3>Generalized Spectral Form Factor in Random Matrix Theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02119" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02119</a>
<br>
<i>Zhiyang Wei, Chengming Tan, Ren Zhang</i>
<p>The spectral form factor (SFF) plays a crucial role in revealing the
statistical properties of energy level distributions in complex systems. It is
one of the tools to diagnose quantum chaos and unravel the universal dynamics
therein. The definition of SFF in most literature only encapsulates the
two-level correlation. In this manuscript, we extend the definition of SSF to
include the high-order correlation. Specifically, we introduce the standard
deviation of energy levels to define correlation functions, from which the
generalized spectral form factor (GSFF) can be obtained by Fourier transforms.
GSFF provides a more comprehensive knowledge of the dynamics of chaotic
systems. Using random matrices as examples, we demonstrate new dynamics
features that are encoded in GSFF. Remarkably, the GSFF is complex, and both
the real and imaginary parts exhibit universal dynamics. For instance, in the
two-level correlated case, the real part of GSFF shows a dip-ramp-plateau
structure akin to the conventional counterpart, and the imaginary part for
different system sizes converges in the long time limit. For the two-level
GSFF, the closed analytical forms of the real part are obtained and consistent
with numerical results. The results of the imaginary part are obtained by
numerical calculation. Similar analyses are extended to three-level GSFF.

<h3>Synergistic interplays between the selective electron-phonon coupling,  antiferromagnetic fluctuations and charge density wave in the YBa2Cu3Ox  cuprate superconductor</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02131" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02131</a>
<br>
<i>Chi Ho Wong, Rolf Lortz</i>
<p>This research aims to investigate the synergistic effect between charge
density wave, selective electron-phonon coupling under antiferromagnetic
fluctuations, as well as the unusual electron distribution observed in ARPES
data in YBa2Cu3Ox superconductors (YBCO). By considering their synergistic
impact, our model can calculate the superconducting transition temperature Tc
of YBa2Cu3Ox as a function of pressure for x = 6.5 and 7 at a reasonable level.
Moreover, we have identified a specific antiferromagnetic phonon that
contributes significantly to the high Tc observed in YBCO. This finding
highlights the significance of these effects in achieving high Tc values. Our
study not only identifies an imbalanced charge-density wave effect for
triggering selective electron-phonon coupling but also explains why the charge
density wave usually occurs around the magnetic copper atoms. Furthermore, our
research reveals limitations in the conventional mean-field ab-initio
approximation used for antiferromagnetic fluctuations in YBCO. It shows that
the dynamic behavior of electrons in YBCO might not be accurately captured by
this approximation, as non-uniform magnetic fields under antiferromagnetic
fluctuations induce an additional electric potential on electrons across the
boundary between non-magnetic to magnetic sites instantaneously. This
instantaneous electric potential, in turn, suggest that the influence of the
antiferromagnetic phonon-based pairing mechanism might not have been optimized
in theory

<h3>Unexpected weak effects of phonon-electron interactions on the lattice  thermal conductivity of high-concentration n-type GaN</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02133" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02133</a>
<br>
<i>Jianshi Sun, Shouhang Li, Zhen Tong, Cheng Shao, Xiangchuan Chen, Qianqian Liu, Yucheng Xiong, Meng An, Xiangjun Liu</i>
<p>Gallium nitride (GaN) has great potential for high-frequency and high-power
applications due to its excellent electrical and thermal transport properties.
However, enhancing the performance of GaN-based power electronics relies on
heavy doping. Previous studies show that electron-phonon interactions have
strong effects on the lattice thermal conductivity of GaN due to the Fr\"ohlich
interaction. Surprisingly, our investigation reveals weak effects of
phonon-electron interactions on the lattice thermal conductivity of n-type GaN
at ultra-high electron concentrations, and the impact of the Fr\"ohlich
interaction can be ignored. The small phonon-electron scattering rate is
attributed to the limited scattering channels, quantified by the Fermi surface
nesting function. In contrast, there is a significant reduction in the lattice
thermal conductivity of p-type GaN at high hole concentrations due to the large
Fermi surface nesting function. However, as p-type GaN has relatively smaller
electron-phonon matrix elements, the reduction in lattice thermal conductivity
is weaker than that observed in p-type silicon. Our work provides a deep
understanding of thermal transport in doped GaN and the conclusions can be
further extended to other wide-bandgap semiconductors, including \{beta}-Ga2O3,
AlN, ZnO, etc.

<h3>Exploring the Unconventional Electron Distribution Patterns in  Iron-based Superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02140" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02140</a>
<br>
<i>Chi Ho Wong, Rolf Lortz</i>
<p>For more than a decade, the unusual distribution of electrons observed in
ARPES (angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy) data within the energy range
of ~30meV to ~300meV below the Fermi level, known as the ARPES range, has
remained a puzzle in the field of iron-based superconductivity. However, in
this study, we have made a noteworthy observation: although the electron-phonon
coupling alone is insufficient to account for the observed ARPES pattern, our
analysis reveals that when the instantaneous electron-phonon coupling occurring
in selective phonon channel is enhanced by the coexistence of antiferromagnetic
spin density wave and charge density wave phenomena, the amplified interaction
becomes comparable to the ARPES range. This finding suggests that the
instantaneous interplay between these intricate phenomena should play a crucial
role in generating the observed energy range in ARPES. Our work may provide a
valuable clue towards achieving a deeper understanding of the complex
relationship between electronic correlations, lattice structure, and
superconductivity in iron-based materials for uncovering the origin of the
unconventional ARPES pattern.

<p>In multivalley systems, the valley pseudospin offers rich physics going from
encoding of information by its polarization (valleytronics), to exploring novel
phases of matter when its degeneracy is changed. Here, by strain engineering,
we reveal fully valley-polarized quantum Hall (QH) phases in the Pb1-xSnxSe
Dirac system. Remarkably, when the valley energy splitting exceeds the
fundamental band gap, we observe a bipolar QH phase, heralded by the
coexistence of hole and electron chiral edge states at distinct valleys in the
same quantum well. This suggests that spatially overlaid counter-propagating
chiral edge states emerging at different valleys do not interfere with each
other.

<h3>Optimization of ionic configurations in battery materials by quantum  annealing</h3>

<i>Tobias Binninger, Yin-Ying Ting, Piotr M. Kowalski, Michael H. Eikerling</i>
<p>Energy materials with disorder in site occupation are challenging for
computational studies due to an exponential scaling of the configuration space.
We herein present a grand-canonical optimization method that enables the use of
quantum annealing (QA) for sampling the ionic ground state. The method relies
on a Legendre transformation of the Coulomb energy cost function that strongly
reduces the effective coupling strengths of the fully connected problem, which
is essential for effectiveness of QA. The approach is expected to be applicable

<p>Quantum materials are defined by the emergence of new properties resulting
from collective quantum effects and by holding promise for their quantum
applications. Novel superconductors, from high-Tc cuprates and iron-based
superconductors to twisted monolayers, exhibit a higher level of emergent
complexity, with a multiband electronic structure playing a pivotal role in
their comprehension and potential applications. Here, we provide a brief
overview of key multiband effects in these superconductors and topological
semimetals, offering guidelines for the theory-assisted development of new
quantum materials and devices.

<p>A collection of active self-propelled particles exhibits motility-induced
phase separation at a packing density much lower than the corresponding
equilibrium counterpart. Unlike the equilibrium counterpart, the steady state
in a system of active particles is characterized by the continuous association
and dissociation of clusters. In this work, we propose an effective
single-particle model in which the effect of neighboring particles is replaced
by a time-dependent local density around the particle, having a unique
auto-correlation function. Such that the local density around the particles has
a memory with a finite correlation time. The correlation time increases with
packing density. Further, by using the same local density and its correlation
function, we solve the system of many particles and compare the results with
numerical simulations. Our proposed analytical theory matches well with the
numerical study.

<p>Inorganic semiconductors based on heavy pnictogen cations (Sb3+ and Bi3+)
have gained significant attention as potential nontoxic and stable alternatives
to lead-halide perovskites for solar cell applications. A limitation of these
novel materials, which is being increasingly commonly found, is carrier
localization, which substantially reduces mobilities and diffusion lengths.
Herein, the layered p\v{r}\'ibramite CuSbSe2 is investigated and discovered to
have delocalized free carriers, as shown through optical pump terahertz probe
spectroscopy and temperature-dependent mobility measurements. Using a
combination of theory and experiment, it is found that the underlying factors
are: 1) weak coupling to acoustic phonons due to low deformation potentials, as
lattice distortions are primarily accommodated through rigid inter-layer
movement rather than straining inter-atomic bonds, and 2) weak coupling to
optical phonons due to the ionic contributions to the dielectric constant being
low compared to electronic contributions. This work provides important insights
into how pnictogen-based semiconductors avoiding carrier localization could be
identified.

<h3>Nearest-Neighboring Pairing of Monolayer NbSe2 Facilitates the Emergence  of Topological Superconducting States</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02259" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02259</a>
<br>
<i>Yizhi Li, Quan Gao, Yanru Li, Jianxin Zhong, Lijun Meng</i>
<p>NbSe2, which simultaneously exhibits superconductivity and spin-orbit
coupling, is anticipated to pave the way for topological superconductivity and
unconventional electron pairing. In this paper, we systematically study
topological superconducting (TSC) phases in monolayer NbSe2 through mixing
on-site s-wave pairing (ps) with nearest-neighbor pairing (psA1) based on a
tight-binding model. We observe rich phases with both fixed and sensitive Chern
numbers (CNs) depending on the chemical potential ({\mu}) and out-of-plane
magnetic field (Vz). As the psA1 increases, the TSC phase manifests matching
and mismatching features according to whether there is a bulk-boundary
correspondence (BBC). Strikingly, the introduction of mixed wave pairing
significantly reduces the critical Vz to form TSC phases compared with the pure
s-wave paring. Moreover, the TSC phase can be modulated even at Vz=0 under
appropriate {\mu} and psA1, which is identified by the robust topological edge
states (TESs) of ribbons. Additionally, the mixed pairing influences the
hybridization of bulk and edge states, resulting in a matching/mismatching BBC
with localized/oscillating TESs on the ribbon. Our finding is helpful for the
realization of TSC states in experiment, as well as designing and regulating
TSC materials.

<p>Synthetic antiferromagnets host spin waves that are highly tunable. It is of
practical interest to analyze the symmetry of their coupling to surface
acoustic waves with the design of hybrid devices in view. For this we calculate
the layer-resolved susceptibility tensor of a synthetic antiferromagnet, the
effective magneto-elastic and magneto-rotation fields associated to a
travelling elastic wave, and the power irreversibly transferred by the elastic
wave to the magnetic layers. We consider Rayleigh-type surface acoustic waves:
(a) that travel in an elastically isotropic, non-piezoelectric substrate, or
(b) that propagate along the X direction at the surface of a Z-cut LiNbO$_3$
substrate, or (c) that are guided in a thin Z-cut LiNbO$_3$ film grown on a
sapphire substrate. In particular, we show that the complementary angular
dependencies of the acoustic and optical spin wave modes in synthetic
antiferromagnets makes it possible to excite spin waves for any relative
orientation of magnetization and acoustic wavevector. In addition, we discuss
the symmetries of the driving fields and of the energy transferred to the
magnetic degree of freedom. We evidence new interaction channels coupling the
magnetization eigenmodes when elastic anisotropy and piezoelectricity of the
substrate are considered.

<h3>Electrochemical Removal of HF from Carbonate-based $LiPF_6$-containing  Li-ion Battery Electrolytes</h3>

<i>Xiaokun Ge, Marten Huck, Andreas Kuhlmann, Michael Tiemann, Christian Weinberger, Xiaodan Xu, Zhenyu Zhao, Hans-Georg Steinrück</i>
<p>Due to the hydrolytic instability of $LiPF_6$ in carbonate-based solvents, HF
is a typical impurity in Li-ion battery electrolytes. HF significantly
influences the performance of Li-ion batteries, for example by impacting the
formation of the solid electrolyte interphase at the anode and by affecting
transition metal dissolution at the cathode. Additionally, HF complicates
studying fundamental interfacial electrochemistry of Li-ion battery
electrolytes, such as direct anion reduction, because it is
electrocatalytically relatively unstable, resulting in LiF passivation layers.
Methods to selectively remove ppm levels of HF from $LiPF_6$-containing
carbonate-based electrolytes are limited. We introduce and benchmark a simple
yet efficient electrochemical in situ method to selectively remove ppm amounts
of HF from $LiPF_6$-containing carbonate-based electrolytes. The basic idea is
the application of a suitable potential to a high surface-area metallic
electrode upon which only HF reacts (electrocatalytically) while all other
electrolyte components are unaffected under the respective conditions.

<h3>Dynamical excitations of one-dimensional Fulde-Ferrell pairing Fermi  superfluid</h3>

<i>Peng Zou, Huaisong Zhao, Feng Yuan, Shi-Guo Peng</i>
<p>We theoretically investigate a one-dimensional Fulde-Ferrell Fermi superfluid
at a finite effective Zeeman field $h$, and study entire dynamical excitations
related to density perturbation. By calculating the density dynamic structure
factor, we find anisotropic dynamical excitations in both collective modes and
single-particle excitations. Along the direction of centre-of-mass momentum
$p$, there are two obvious gapless collective modes with different speed. The
lower collective modes is from the usual gauge symmetry breaking and has a
larger speed than the one in the negative direction of $p$. The higher one is
due to the direction spontaneous symmetry breaking of centre-of-mass momentum
$p$, and separates two kinds of single-particle excitations in the positive $p$
direction. However, this higher mode disappears in the opposite direction of
$p$, where two single-particle excitations overlap with each other. These
signals of dynamical excitations can do help to distinguish Fulde-Ferrell
superfluid from the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superfluid in the
future experiment.

<h3>Robustness of topological order against disorder</h3>

<br>
<i>Lucas A. Oliveira, Wei Chen</i>
<p>A universal topological marker has been proposed recently to map the
topological invariants of Dirac models in any dimension and symmetry class to
lattice sites. Using this topological marker, we examine the conditions under
which the global topological order, represented by the spatially averaged
topological marker, remains unchanged in the presence of disorder for 1D and 2D
systems. We find that if an impurity corresponds to varying a nonzero matrix
element of the lattice Hamiltonian, regardless the element represents hopping,
chemical potential, pairing, etc, then the average topological marker is
conserved. However, if there are many strong impurities and the average
distance between them is shorter than a correlation length, then the average
marker is no longer conserved. In addition, strong and dense impurities can be
used to continuously interpolate between one topological phase and another. A
number of prototype lattice models including Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, Kitaev
chain, Chern insulators, Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model, and chiral p-wave
superconductors are used to elaborate the ubiquity of these statements.

<h3>Anisotropy of the anomalous Hall effect in the altermagnet candidate  Mn$_5$Si$_3$ films</h3>

<p>Altermagnets are compensated magnets belonging to spin symmetry groups that
allow alternating spin polarizations both in the coordinate space of the
crystal and in the momentum space of the electronic structure. In these
materials the anisotropic local crystal environment of the different
sublattices lowers the symmetry of the system so that the opposite-spin
sublattices are connected only by rotations, which results in an unconventional
spin-polarized band structure in the momentum space. This low symmetry of the
crystal structure is expected to be reflected in the anisotropy of the
anomalous Hall effect. In this work, we study the anisotropy of the anomalous
Hall effect in epitaxial thin films of Mn$_5$Si$_3$, an altermagnetic candidate
material. We first demonstrate a change in the relative N\'eel vector
orientation when rotating the external field orientation through systematic
changes in both the anomalous Hall effect and the anisotropic longitudinal
magnetoresistance. We then show that the anomalous Hall effect in this material
is anisotropic with the N\'eel vector orientation relative to the crystal
structure and that this anisotropy requires high crystal quality and unlikely
correlates with the magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Our results provide further
systematic support to the case for considering epitaxial thin films of
Mn$_5$Si$_3$ as an altermagnetic candidate material.

<p>This review presents recent breakthroughs in the realm of nonlinear Hall
effects, emphasizing central theoretical foundations and recent experimental
progress. We elucidate the quantum origin of the second-order Hall response,
focusing on the Berry curvature dipole, which may arise in inversion symmetry
broken systems. The theoretical framework also reveals the impact of disorder
scattering effects on the nonlinear response. We further discuss the
possibility of obtaining nonlinear Hall responses beyond the second order. We
examine symmetry-based indicators essential for the manifestation of nonlinear
Hall effects in time-reversal symmetric crystals, setting the stage for a
detailed exploration of theoretical models and candidate materials predicted to
exhibit sizable and tunable Berry curvature dipole. We summarize groundbreaking
experimental reports on measuring both intrinsic and extrinsic nonlinear Hall
effects across diverse material classes. Finally, we highlight some of the
other intriguing nonlinear effects, including nonlinear planar Hall, nonlinear
anomalous Hall, and nonlinear spin and valley Hall effects. We conclude with an
outlook on pivotal open questions and challenges, marking the trajectory of
this rapidly evolving field.

<h3>Temperature-dependent Fermi surface probed by Shubnikov-de Haas  oscillations in topological semimetal candidates DyBi and HoBi</h3>

<p>Rare earth-based monopnictides are among the most intensively studied groups
of materials in which extremely large magnetoresistance has been observed. This
study explores magnetotransport properties of two representatives of this
group, DyBi and HoBi. The extreme magnetoresistance is discovered in DyBi and
confirmed in HoBi. At $T=2$ K and in $B=14$ T for both compounds,
magnetoresistance reaches the order of magnitude of $10^4\%$. For both
materials, standard Kohler's rule is obeyed only in the temperature range from
50 K to 300 K. At lower temperatures, extended Kohler's rule has to be invoked
because carrier concentrations and mobilities strongly change with temperature
and magnetic field. This is further proven by the observation of a quite rare
temperature-dependence of oscillation frequencies in Shubnikov-de Haas effect.
Rate of this dependence clearly changes at N\'{e}el temperature, reminiscent of
a novel magnetic band splitting. Multi-frequency character of the observed
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations points to the coexistence of electron- and
hole-type Fermi pockets in both studied materials. Overall, our results
highlight correlation of temperature dependence of the Fermi surface with the
magnetotransport properties of DyBi and HoBi.

<h3>Tunning the number of chiral edge channels in a fixed quantum anomalous  Hall system</h3>

<p>Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators exhibit chiral edge channels
characterized by vanishing longitudinal conductance and quantized Hall
conductance of Ce2/h, wherein the Chern number C is an integer equal to the
number of the parallel chiral edge channels. These chiral edge channels conduct
dissipationless transport in QAH insulators, making them pivotal for
applications in low-consumption electronics and topological quantum computing.
While the QAH effect with multiple chiral edge channels (i.e., C >1) has been
demonstrated in multilayers consisting of magnetic topological insulators and
normal insulators, the channel number remains fixed for a given sample. Here,
we unveil the tunability of the number of chiral edge channels within a single
QAH insulator device. By tuning the magnetization of individual layers within
the multilayer system, Chern insulating states with different Chern numbers are
unveiled. The tunable Chern number was corroborated by our theoretical
calculations. Furthermore, we conducted layer-dependent calculations to
elucidate the contribution of the Chern number from different layers in the
multilayer. Our findings demonstrate an extra degree of freedom in manipulating
the chiral edge channels in QAH insulators. This newfound tunability offers
extra dimension for the implementation of the QAH-based multi-channel
dissipationless transport.

<h3>Electron-phonon coupling, critical temperatures and gaps in  $\rm{NbSe_2}$/$\rm{MoS_2}$ Ising Superconductors</h3>

<br>
<i>Shubham Patel, Soumyasree Jena, A Taraphder</i>
<p>Utilizing Migdal-Eliashberg theory of superconductivity within the
first-principles calculations, we work out the role of electron-phonon coupling
(EPC) and anisotropic superconducting properties of a recently discovered
[Appl. Phys. Lett. 120, 183101 (2022)] 2D van der Waals heterostructure
comprising a single layer of MoS$_2$ and few layers of NbSe$_2$. We find strong
EPC and a softening of phonon modes in the lowest acoustic branch. While the
single MoS$_2$ layer does not actively contribute to the EPC, it significantly
elevates the superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$) compared to monolayer
NbSe$_2$. This is attributed to the degradation of the charge-density wave
(CDW) by the MoS$_2$ layer. Notably, we observe a two-gap superconductivity in
$\rm{NbSe_2}$/$\rm{MoS_2}$ and extend our study to three layers of NbSe$_2$. A
reduction in $T_c$ with increasing thickness of NbSe$_2$ is observed. We
confirm that this trend is consistent with recent experiments, if one goes
beyond three layers of NbSe$_2$. We incorporated spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and
suggest a possible mechanism for Ising superconductivity. We find that SOC
reduces EPC while $T_c$ is suppressed concomitantly by about 5K, leading to a
closer estimate of the experimental $T_c$.

<br>
<i>Gang Meng, James Gardner, Wenjie Dou, Reinhard J. Maurer, Bin Jiang</i>
<p>Accurate description of nonadiabatic dynamics of molecules at metal surfaces
involving electron transfer has been a longstanding challenge for theory. Here,
we tackle this problem by first constructing high-dimensional neural network
diabatic potentials including state crossings determined by constrained density
functional theory, then applying mixed quantum-classical surface hopping
simulations to evolve coupled electron-nuclear motion. Our approach accurately
describes the nonadiabatic effects in CO scattering from Au(111) without
empirical parameters and yields results agreeing well with experiments under
various conditions for this benchmark system. We find that both adiabatic and
nonadiabatic energy loss channels have important contributions to the
vibrational relaxation of highly vibrationally excited CO(vi = 17), whereas
relaxation of low vibrationally excited states of CO(vi = 2) is weak and
dominated by nonadiabatic energy loss. The presented approach paves the way for
accurate first-principles simulations of electron transfer mediated
nonadiabatic dynamics at metal surfaces.

<p>The electronic and transport properties of aluminum-graphene composite
materials were investigated using ab initio plane wave density functional
theory. The interfacial structure is reported for several configurations. In
some cases, the face-centered aluminum (111) surface relaxes in a nearly ideal
registry with graphene, resulting in a remarkably continuous interface
structure. The Kubo-Greenwood formula and space-projected conductivity were
employed to study electronic conduction in aluminum single- and double-layer
graphene-aluminum composite models. The electronic density of states at the
Fermi level is enhanced by the graphene for certain aluminum-graphene
interfaces, thus, improving electronic conductivity. In double-layer graphene
composites, conductivity varies non-monotonically with temperature, showing an
increase between 300-400 K at short aluminum-graphene distances, unlike the
consistent decrease in single-layer composites.

<i>Paul Tangney</i>
<p>I present the mathematical structure of classical phonon theory in a general
form, which emphasizes the wave natures of phonons, and which can serve as a
robust foundation for further development of the theory of strongly interacting
phonons. I also show that the Fourier transform (FT) of the mass-weighted
velocity-velocity correlation function (mVVCF) is exactly the distribution of
the classical kinetic energy among frequencies and wavevectors. Because this
result is classically exact, it is general: It is as valid, theoretically, for
a liquid or a molecule in a non-thermal non-stationary state as it is for a
crystal at thermal equilibrium at a low temperature. Therefore, as well as
being of fundamental importance to physical theory, this result implies that
calculating the FT of the mVVCF from atomistic simulations is a much more
powerful computational tool than it is believed to be. Existing theory shows
only that the FT of the mVVCF is proportional to the vibrational density of
states at thermal equilibrium, and under the simplifying assumption that the
number of available vibrational states is equal to the number of degrees of
freedom.

<h3>Proposal for Majorana Modes without a Magnetic Field in a  semiconductor-superconductor sandwich structures</h3>

<i>Huan-Kuang Wu, Jay Sau</i>
<p>We propose a planar Josephson junction setup to host Majorana modes where the
semiconductor is sandwiched between superconductors on both surfaces. While the
studied configuration is related to both devices proposed for use with
topological insulators as well as other proposals for Majorana modes without
applied magnetic fields, we find that placing the superconductor on both
surfaces allows us to replace the topological insulator by a wider variety of
spin-orbit coupled semiconductors. Application of an electric field in the
junction together with appropriate superconducting phase differences allows
different Fermi surfaces to be subject to different phase differences. We find
that these conditions can drive the system into a class-D topological
superconductor with a pair of Majorana modes at the two ends of the junction.
Additionally, class-DIII topological superconductors with helical Majorana
modes also occur in other parts of the phase diagram. We simulate our setup on
HgTe near the valence band edge described by the well-known 8-band Kane model
with realistic parameters and find phase diagram can be achieved. The
topological gap can remain comparable to the bulk superconducting gap
throughout the fermi surface.
