<h3>Magnetic properties of the spiral spin liquid and surrounding phases in  the square lattice XY model</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00100" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00100</a>
<br>
</p><i>Matías G. Gonzalez, Anna Fancelli, Han Yan, Johannes Reuther</i>
<p>Spiral spin liquids possess a subextensively degenerate ground-state
manifold, represented by a continuum of energy minima in reciprocal space.
Since a small change of the spiral state wavevector requires a global change of
the spin configuration in real space, it is a priori unclear how such systems
can fluctuate within the degenerate ground state manifold. Only recently it was
proposed that momentum vortices are responsible for the liquidity of the spiral
phase and that these systems are closely related to an emergent rank-2 U(1)
gauge theory [H. Yan and J. Reuther, Phys. Rev. Research 4, 023175 (2022)]. As
a consequence of this gauge structure, four-fold pinch-point singularities were
found in a generalized spin correlator. In this article, we use classical Monte
Carlo and molecular dynamics calculations to embed the previously studied
spiral spin liquid into a broader phase diagram of the square lattice XY model.
We find a multitude of unusual phases and phase transitions surrounding the
spiral spin liquid such as an effective four-state Potts transition into a
colinear double-striped phase resulting from the spontaneous breaking of two
coupled $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries. Since this phase is stabilized by entropic
effects selecting the momenta away from the spiral manifold, it undergoes a
re-entrance phenomenon at low temperatures into a nematic spiral phase. We also
observe a region of parameters where the phase transition into the spiral spin
liquid does not break any symmetries and where the critical exponents do not
match those of standard universality classes. We study the importance of
momentum vortices in driving this phase transition and discuss the possibility
of a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of momentum vortices. Finally, we explore
the regime where the rank-2 U(1) gauge theory is valid by investigating the
four-fold pinch point singularities across the phase diagram

<h3>Dynamics of nano-scale assemblies of amphiphilic PEG-PDMS-PEG copolymers</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Sudipta Gupta, Rasangi M. Perera, Christopher J. Van Leeuwen, Tianyu Li, Laura Stingaciu, Markus Bleuel, Kunlun Hong, Gerald J. Schneider</i>
<p>Micelles and vesicles are promising candidates in targeted drug/gene
delivery, bioreactors, and templates for nanoparticle synthesis. We
investigated the morphology and dynamics of PEG-PDMS-PEG triblock copolymer
nano-scale assemblies regarding the membrane dynamics because the molecular
dynamics of the membrane govern mechanical properties like the stability of a
membrane. We studied the structure by cryogenic transmission electron
microscopy, small-angle neutron scattering, and the dynamics by dynamic light
scattering and neutron spin echo spectroscopy. We changed the length of the
hydrophilic block to obtain micellar and vesicular systems. The vesicle has a
membrane rigidity, $\kappa_\eta = 16 \pm 2 k_B T$, the same order of magnitude
as the corresponding liposome value but one order of magnitude higher than
polymeric interfaces in microemulsions. Hence, the height-height fluctuations
of polymers in a polymersome seem much less than those measured for surfactants
at an oil-water interface. Therefore, the polymersome is substantially more
stable. The value is very close to liposomes, indicating a similar stability.

<h3>Transient amplification in Floquet media: the Mathieu oscillator example</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00138" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00138</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ioannis Kiorpelidis, Fotios K. Diakonos, Georgios Theocharis, Vincent Pagneux</i>
<p>The Mathieu equation occurs naturally in the description of non linear
vibrations or by considering the propagation of a wave in an infinite medium
with time-periodic refractive index. It is known to lead to parametric
instability since it supports unstable solutions in some regions of the
parameter space. However, even in the stable region the matrix that propagates
the initial conditions forward in time is non-normal and therefore it can
result in transient amplification. By optimizing over initial conditions as
well as initial time we show that significant transient amplifications can be
obtained, going beyond the one simply stemming from adiabatic invariance.
Moreover, we explore the monodromy matrix in more depth, by studying its
$\epsilon$-pseudospectra and Petermann factors, demonstrating that is the
degree of non-normality of this matrix that determines the global amplifying
features.

<h3>Machine learning classification of local environments in molecular  crystals</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00155" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00155</a>
<br>
</p><i>Daisuke Kuroshima, Michael Kilgour, Mark E. Tuckerman, Jutta Rogal</i>
<p>Identifying local structural motifs and packing patterns of molecular solids
is a challenging task for both simulation and experiment. We demonstrate two
novel approaches to characterize local environments in different polymorphs of
molecular crystals using learning models that employ either flexibly learned or
handcrafted molecular representations. In the first case, we follow our earlier
work on graph learning in molecular crystals, deploying an atomistic graph
convolutional network, combined with molecule-wise aggregation, to enable
per-molecule environmental classification. For the second model, we develop a
new set of descriptors based on symmetry functions combined with a point-vector
representation of the molecules, encoding information about the positions as
well as relative orientations of the molecule. We demonstrate very high
classification accuracy for both approaches on urea and nicotinamide crystal
polymorphs, and practical applications to the analysis of dynamical trajectory
data for nanocrystals and solid-solid interfaces. Both architectures are
applicable to a wide range of molecules and diverse topologies, providing an
essential step in the exploration of complex condensed matter phenomena.

<h3>Flow dichroism of DNA can be quantitatively predicted via coarse-grained  molecular simulations</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00160" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00160</a>
<br>
</p><i>Isaac Pincus, Alison Rodger, J. Ravi Prakash</i>
<p>We demonstrate the use of multiscale polymer modelling to quantitatively
predict DNA linear dichroism (LD) in shear flow. LD is the difference in
absorption of light polarised along two perpendicular axes, and has long been
applied to study biopolymer structure and drug-biopolymer interactions. As LD
is orientation-dependent, the sample must be aligned in order to measure a
signal. Shear flow via a Couette cell can generate the required orientation,
however it is challenging to separate the LD due to changes in polymer
conformation from specific interactions, e.g. drug-biopolymer. In this study,
we have applied a combination of Brownian dynamics and equilibrium Monte Carlo
simulations to accurately predict polymer alignment, and hence flow LD, at
modest computational cost. As the optical and conformational contributions to
the LD can be explicitly separated, our findings allow for enhanced
quantitative interpretation of LD spectra through the use of an in-silico model
to capture conformational changes. Our model requires no fitting and only five
input parameters, the DNA contour length, persistence length, optical factor,
solvent quality, and relaxation time, all of which have been well characterized
in prior literature. The method is sufficiently general to apply to a wide
range of biopolymers beyond DNA, and our findings could help guide the search
for new pharmaceutical drug targets via flow LD.

<p>Technical advancement of oxide molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) has opened new
avenues for studying various quantum transport phenomena in correlated
transition-metal oxides, as exemplified by the exotic superconductivity of
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and quantum oscillations of SrRuO$_3$. On the other hand, film
research of another Ruddlesden-Popper strontium ruthenate Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$
which exhibits a unique quantum phase related to metamagnetism in bulk systems
did not progress well. Here we report the fabrication of high-quality
Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ thin films by oxide MBE and the observation of a
strain-induced ferromagnetic ground state. The change in magnetic exchange
coupling evaluated by first-principles calculations indicates a systematic
relation between the compression of the $c$-axis length and induced
ferromagnetism. Giant epitaxial strain in high-quality films will be a key to a
comprehensive understanding of the magnetism in Ruddlesden-Popper strontium
ruthenates Sr$_{n+1}$Ru$_n$O$_{3n+1}$, which sensitively depends on the ratio
of in-plane to out-of-plane Ru-Ru distances.

<h3>Minimizing the Profligacy of Searches with Reset</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00215" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00215</a>
<br>
</p><i>John C. Sunil, Richard A. Blythe, Martin R. Evans, Satya N. Majumdar</i>
<p>We introduce the profligacy of a search process as a competition between its
expected cost and the probability of finding the target. The arbiter of the
competition is a parameter $\lambda$ that represents how much a searcher
invests into increasing the chance of success. Minimizing the profligacy with
respect to the search strategy specifies the optimal search. We show that in
the case of diffusion with stochastic resetting, the amount of resetting in the
optimal strategy has a highly nontrivial dependence on model parameters
resulting in classical continuous transitions, discontinuous transitions and
tricritical points as well as non-standard discontinuous transitions exhibiting
re-entrant behavior and overhangs.

<h3>Complete universal scaling in first-order phase transitions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00219" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00219</a>
<br>
</p><i>Fan Zhong</i>
<p>Phase transitions and critical phenomena are among the most intriguing
phenomena in nature and society. They are classified as first-order phase
transitions (FOPTs) and continuous ones. While the latter show marvelous
phenomena of scaling and universality, whether the former behaves similarly is
a long-standing controversial issue. Here we definitely demonstrate complete
universal scaling in field driven FOPTs for Langevin equations in both zero and
two spatial dimensions by rescaling all parameters and subtracting extra
contributions with singular dimensions from an effective temperature and a
special field according to an effective theory that possesses a fixed point of
a seemingly un-physical imaginary value. This offers a perspective different
from the usual nucleation and growth but conforming to continuous phase
transitions to study FOPTs.

<h3>Flattening a trapped atomic gas using a programmable optical potential  in a feedback loop</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00238" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00238</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sol Kim, Kyuhwan Lee, Jongmin Kim, Y. Shin</i>
<p>We present a method for producing a flat, large-area Fermi gas of $^6$Li with
a uniform area density. The method uses a programmable optical potential within
a feedback loop to flatten the in-plane trapping potential for atoms. The
optical potential is generated using a laser beam, whose intensity profile is
adjusted by a spatial light modulator and optimized through measurements of the
density distribution of the sample. The resulting planar sample exhibits a
uniform area density within a region of about 480 $\mu$m in diameter and the
standard deviation of the trap bottom potential is estimated to be $\approx k_B
\times$ 6.1 nK, which is less than 20$\%$ of the transverse confinement energy.
We discuss a dimensional crossover toward 2D regime by reducing the number of
atoms in the planar trap, including the effect of the spatial variation of the
transverse trapping frequency in the large-area sample.

<h3>NMR of a single nuclear spin detected by a scanning tunneling microscope</h3>

</p><i>Yishay Manassen, Michael Averbukh, Zion Hazan, Yahel Tzuriel, Pino Boscolo, Alexsander Shnirman, Baruch Horovitz</i>
<p>We demonstrate ionization of a molecule with the bias voltage of a Scanning
Tunnelling Microscope (STM) resulting in a coexistence of a neutral and ionic
molecules, i.e. radical (paramagnetic) and non-radical (diamagnetic) states.
This coexistence may be facilitated by a periodic switching between two bias
voltages. The precession of the nucleus in the diamagnetic state modulates the
nuclear polarization as well as the hyperfine transitions as seen in electron
spin resonance (ESR). We analyze the power spectrum of a selected hyperfine
intensity and obtain the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum. We have
observed this phenomenon in three types of molecules: TEMPO, toluene and
triphenylphosphine, showing NMR of $^{14}$N, $^{13}$C, $^{31}$P and $^1$H
nuclei. The spectra are detailed and show signatures of the chemical
environment, i.e. chemical shifts. A master equation including off-diagonal
hyperfine interactions accounts for these observations.

<h3>Discrete Scale Invariance and $U(2)$ Family of Two-Body Contact  Interactions in One Dimension</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00275" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00275</a>
<br>
</p><i>Satoshi Ohya</i>
<p>Because of the absence of indistinguishability constraint, interparticle
interactions between nonidentical particles have in general much more variety
than those between identical particles. In particular, it is known that there
exists a $U(2)$ family of two-body contact interactions between nonidentical
particles in one spatial dimension. This paper studies breakdown of continuous
scale invariance to discrete scale invariance under this $U(2)$ family of
two-body contact interactions in two-body problems of nonidentical particles on
the half line. We show that, in contrast to the corresponding
identical-particle problem, there exist two distinct channels that admit
geometric sequences of two-body bound states.

<h3>Gradient bandgap enables >13% efficiency sulfide Kesterite solar cells  with open-circuit voltage over 800 mV</h3>

<p>Sulfide Kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), a nontoxic and low-cost photovoltaic
material, has always being facing severe charge recombination and poor carrier
transport, resulting in the cell efficiency record stagnating around 11% for
years. Gradient bandgap is a promising approach to relieve these issues,
however, has not been effectively realized in Kesterite solar cells due to the
challenges in controlling the gradient distribution of alloying elements at
high temperatures. Herein, targeting at the Cd alloyed CZTS, we propose a
pre-crystallization strategy to reduce the intense vertical mass transport and
Cd rapid diffusion in the film growth process, thereby realizing front
Cd-gradient CZTS absorber. The Cd-gradient CZTS absorber, exhibiting downward
bending conduction band structure, has significantly enhanced the minority
carrier transport and additionally improved band alignment and interface
property of CZTS/CdS heterojunction. Ultimately, we have achieved a champion
total-area efficiency of 13.5% (active-area efficiency: 14.1%) in the cell and
in particular a high open-circuit voltage of >800 mV. We have also achieved a
certified total-area cell efficiency of 13.16%, realizing a substantial step
forward for the pure sulfide Kesterite solar cell.

<h3>Dynamic Viscosity of the ABC-stacked Multilayer Graphene in the  Collisionless Regime</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00375" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00375</a>
<br>
</p><i>Weiwei Chen, Yedi Shen, Tianle Zhan, W. Zhu</i>
<p>We explore the dynamic shear viscosity of the undoped ABC-stacked multilayer
graphene based on the chiral-$N$ effective Hamiltonian, where the chirality $N$
is equivalent to the layer number. We investigate the dependence of the dynamic
shear viscosity on the frequency in the collisionless regime and calculate
Coulomb interaction corrections by three leading order Feynman diagrams:
self-energy diagram, vertex diagram, and honey diagram. We propose that the
dynamic shear viscosity is generated by the relaxation of momentum flux
polarization through electron-hole excitations, and that the interaction can
amplify this effect. Furthermore, our research indicates that the dynamic shear
viscosity exhibits a robust linear positive dependence on $N$. This finding
suggests that by making modifications to the number of layers in graphene, it
is possible to finely tune the electron viscous effects.

<h3>Non-additive Stochastic Model for Supercooled Liquids: New Perspectives  for Glass Science</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Antonio Cesar do Prado Rosa Junior, Elias Brito Alves Junior, Wanisson Silva Santana, Clebson Cruz</i>
<p>We present a review of the Non-additive Stochastic Model for supercooled
liquids (NSM), an efficient approach for diffusive processes that provides a
suitable interpretation for the non-Arrhenius dynamics in these materials.
Based on a class of non-homogeneous continuity equations, the NSM provides
functions able to model the thermal behavior of the viscosity and diffusivity
in fragile liquids. The model defines a rigorous physical criterion that
distinguishes super-Arrhenius from sub-Arrhenius processes, establishes a
robust scale of fragility, describes fragile-to-strong curves in Angell's plot,
and provides an accurate fitting equation for experimental viscosity data as
effective as other viscosity classic models.

<h3>Optimum surface-passivation schemes for near-surface spin defects in  silicon carbide</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00393" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00393</a>
<br>
</p><i>Cyrille Armel Sayou Ngomsi, Tamanna Joshi, Pratibha Dev</i>
<p>Spin-active defects in silicon carbide (SiC) are promising quantum light
sources for realizing scalable quantum technologies. In different applications,
these photoluminescent defects are often placed in a nanostructured host or
close to surfaces in order to enhance the signal from the defects. However,
proximity to the surface not only modifies frequencies of the quantum emission
from the defect, but also adversely affects their photo-stability, resulting in
blinking and/or photobleaching of the defect. These effects can be ameliorated
by passivating surfaces with optimal adsorbates. In this work, we explore
different passivation schemes using density functional theory-based
calculations. We show that a uniform surface passivation with either hydrogen
or with mixed hydrogen/hydroxyl groups completely removes surface states from
the SiC band gap, restoring the optical properties of the defects.

<h3>Moments of Entropy Production in Dissipative Devices</h3>

</p><i>Jean-Charles Delvenne, Léopold Van Brandt</i>
<p>We characterize the possible moments of entropy production for general
overdamped Markovian systems. We find a general formulation of the problem, and
derive a new necessary condition between the second and third moment. We
determine all possible first, second and third moments of entropy production
for a white noise process. As a consequence, we obtain a lower bound for the
skewness of the current fluctuations in dissipative devices such as
transistors, thereby demonstrating that the Gaussianity assumption widely used
in electronic engineering is thermodynamically inconsistent.

<h3>Electron Collimation in Twisted Bilayer Graphene via Gate-defined  Moiré Barriers</h3>

<p>Electron collimation via a graphene pn-junction allows electrostatic control
of ballistic electron trajectories akin to that of an optical circuit. Similar
manipulation of novel correlated electronic phases in twisted-bilayer graphene
(tBLG) can provide additional probes to the underlying physics and device
components towards advanced quantum electronics. In this work, we demonstrate
collimation of the electron flow via gate-defined moir\'e barriers in a tBLG
device, utilizing the band-insulator gap of the moir\'e superlattice. A single
junction can be tuned to host a chosen combination of conventional pseudo
barrier and moir\'e tunnel barriers, from which we demonstrate improved
collimation efficiency. By measuring transport through two consecutive moir\'e
collimators separated by 1 um, we demonstrate evidence of electron collimation
in tBLG in the presence of realistic twist-angle inhomogeneity.

<h3>Gauge potentials and vortices in the Fock space of a pair of  periodically driven Bose-Einstein condensates</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00533" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00533</a>
<br>
</p><i>J. Mumford, D. Kamp, D. H. J. O'Dell</i>
<p>We perform a theoretical study of the coupled dynamics of two species of
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a double well potential where both the
tunneling and the interatomic interactions are driven periodically in time. The
population difference between the wells of each species gives rise to a two
dimensional lattice in Fock space with dimensions given by the number of atoms
in each BEC. We use a Floquet analysis to derive an effective Hamiltonian that
acts in this Fock space and find that it contains an artificial gauge field.
This system simulates noninteracting particles in a tight binding lattice
subject to an additional harmonic potential and vector potential. When the
intra-species interactions are attractive there is a critical value at which
the ground state of the Floquet operator undergoes a transition from a Gaussian
state to a quantized vortex state in Fock space. The transition can be
quantified in terms of the angular momentum as well as the entanglement entropy
of the ground state with both showing sudden jumps as the intra-species
interactions become stronger. The stability of the vortex state vanishes in the
thermodynamic limit.

</p><i>Qiwen Qiu, Stephen Yue, Jun Song</i>
<p>Magnesium (Mg) alloys have emerged as promising materials due to their low
density and high strength-to-weight ratio, offering a wide range of
applications across multiple industries. Nevertheless, the inherent brittleness
of Mg alloys poses a significant hurdle, necessitating innovative approaches to
enhance their mechanical performance. Among the various strategies,
manipulating stacking fault energy (SFE) has been a key focus, although
primarily within the realm of binary alloys. This study investigates SFE in Mg
alloys, focusing on ternary compositions. Utilizing first-principles DFT
calculations, we analyze solute interactions and their influence on SFE,
particularly in Mg-Al-X and Mg-Zn-X configurations. Predictive models are
developed for estimating SFE effects, revealing solute pairs that mimic rare
earth elements and show potential for improved ductility. The findings
contribute to fundamental insights into Mg alloy behavior, offering practical
directions for designing advanced materials with superior mechanical
properties.

<p>The LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface hosts a plethora of gate-tunable electronic
phases. Gating of LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces are usually assumed to occur
electrostatically. However, increasing evidence suggests that non-local
interactions can influence and, in some cases, dominate the coupling between
applied gate voltages and electronic properties. Here, we sketch quasi-1D
ballistic electron waveguides at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface as a probe
to understand how gate tunability varies as a function of spatial separation.
Gate tunability measurements reveal the scaling law to be at odds with the pure
electrostatic coupling observed in traditional semiconductor systems. The
non-Coulombic gating at the interface is attributed to the existence of a
long-range nanoelectromechanical coupling between the gate and electron
waveguide, mediated by the ferroelastic domains in SrTiO$_3$. The long-range
interactions at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface add unexpected richness and
complexity to this correlated electron system.

<h3>Harmonic chain driven by active Rubin bath: transport properties and  steady-state correlations</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00615" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00615</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ritwick Sarkar, Ion Santra, Urna Basu</i>
<p>Characterizing the properties of an extended system driven by active
reservoirs is a question of increasing importance. Here we address this
question in two steps. We start by investigating the dynamics of a probe
particle connected to an `active Rubin bath' -- a linear chain of overdamped
run-and-tumble particles. We derive exact analytical expressions for the
effective noise and dissipation kernels, acting on the probe, and show that the
active nature of the bath leads to a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation.
In the next step, we study the properties of an activity-driven system, modeled
by a chain of harmonic oscillators connected to two such active reservoirs at
the two ends. We show that the system reaches a nonequilibrium stationary state
(NESS), remarkably different from that generated due to a thermal gradient. We
characterize this NESS by computing the kinetic temperature profile, spatial
and temporal velocity correlations of the oscillators, and the average energy
current flowing through the system. It turns out that, the activity drive leads
to the emergence of two characteristic length scales, proportional to the
activities of the reservoirs. Strong signatures of activity are also manifest
in the anomalous short-time decay of the velocity autocorrelations. Finally, we
find that the energy current shows a non-monotonic dependence on the activity
drive and reversal in direction, corroborating previous findings.

<h3>Bloch-Landau-Zener oscillations in a quasi-periodic potential</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00642" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00642</a>
<br>
</p><i>Henrique C. Prates, Vladimir V. Konotop</i>
<p>Bloch oscillations and Landau-Zener tunneling are ubiquitous phenomena which
are sustained by a band-gap spectrum of a periodic Hamiltonian and can be
observed in dynamics of a quantum particle or a wavepacket in a periodic
potential under action of a linear force. Such physical setting remains
meaningful for aperiodic potentials too, although band-gap structure does not
exist anymore. Here we consider the dynamics of noninteracting atoms and
Bose-Einstein condensates in a quasi-periodic one-dimensional optical lattice
subjected to a weak linear force. Excited states with energies below the
mobility edge, and thus localized in space, are considered. We show that the
observed oscillatory behavior is enabled by tunneling between the initial state
and a state (or several states) located nearby in the coordinate-energy space.
The states involved in such Bloch-Landau-Zener oscillations are determined by
the selection rule consisting of the condition of their spatial proximity and
condition of quasi-resonances occurring at avoided crossings of the energy
levels. The latter condition is formulated mathematically using the Gershgorin
circle theorem. The effect of the inter-atomic interactions on the dynamics can
also be predicted on the bases of the developed theory. The reported results
can be observed in any physical system allowing for observation of the Bloch
oscillations, upon introducing incommensurablity in the governing Hamiltonian.

<p>The search for exotic spin configurations and related novel transport
properties continues to be fueled by the promise of new electronic states and
outstanding candidate components for spintronic applications. In layered
Cr$_{7-\delta}$Te$_8$, the applied field drives a before unreported magnetic
transition revealed by the alternating current magnetic susceptibility
measurements around room temperature. This observed magnetic transition results
in a sign change for the anomalous Hall effect which exhibits non-monotonous
temperature dependence. The prominent topological Hall effect (THE) with a
large value of 1$\mu \Omega \cdot cm$ has been observed without breaking the
inversion symmetry for Cr$_{7-\delta}$Te$_8$. This robust THE can persist up to
room temperature attributed to the nonzero fluctuation-driven scalar spin
chirality. The complicated interactions of long-range and short-range magnetic
orders lead to rich exotic magnetic states with related novel transport
properties in Cr$_{7-\delta}$Te$_8$.

<h3>Real-space renormalisation approach to the Chalker-Coddington model  revisited: improved statistics</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00660" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00660</a>
<br>
</p><i>Syl Shaw, Rudolf A. Römer</i>
<p>The real-space renormalisation group method can be applied to the
Chalker-Coddington model of the quantum Hall transition to provide a convenient
numerical estimation of the localisation critical exponent, $\nu$. Previous
such studies found $\nu\sim 2.39$ which falls considerably short of the current
best estimates by transfer matrix ($\nu\approx 2.593$) and
exact-diagonalisation studies ($\nu=2.58(3)$). By increasing the amount of data
$500$ fold we can now measure closer to the critical point and find an improved
estimate $\nu\approx 2.51$. This deviates only $\sim 3\%$ from the previous two
values and is already better than the $\sim 7\%$ accuracy of the classical
small-cell renormalisation approach from which our method is adapted. We also
study a previously proposed mixing of the Chalker-Coddington model with a
classical scattering model which is meant to provide a route to understanding
why experimental estimates give a lower $\nu\sim 2.3$. Upon implementing this
mixing into our RG unit, we find only further increases to the value of $\nu$.

<h3>Spontaneous charge-ordered state in Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Xiu-Cai Jiang, Ze-Yi Song, Ze Ruan, Yu-Zhong Zhang</i>
<p>We propose that a weakly spontaneous charge-ordered insulating state probably
exists in Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene which can account for experimentally
observed non-monotonic behavior of resistance as a function of the gated field,
namely, the gap closes and reopens at a critical gated field. The underlying
physics is demonstrated by a simple model on a corresponding lattice that
contains the nearest intralayer and interlayer hoppings, electric field, and
staggered potential between different sublattices. Combining density functional
theory calculations with model analyses, we argue that the interlayer van der
Waals interactions cooperating with ripples may be responsible for the
staggered potential which induces a charge-ordered insulating state in the
absence of the electric field.

<h3>Hidden-Rashba-driven Absence of Odd-integer Quantized States in an Oxide  Quantum Hall System</h3>

<p>The discovery of the quantum Hall effect in 1980, a turning point in
condensed matter physics, has inspired exploring emergent quantized states
regarding novel electron states, band topologies and spin textures. Owing to
the lifted degeneracies universally-existing, most quantum Hall systems host
both even- and odd-integer quantum Hall plateaus simultaneously. Selective
control of these quantized states is of great significance to understand the
exotic ground states and manipulate the spin textures in quantum Hall systems;
however, it remains challenging. Here we demonstrate the absence of odd-integer
state in inversion-symmetric Bi2O2Se quantum Hall system driven by the unique
hidden Rashba effect. Pronounced quantum oscillations and only even-integer
quantized plateaus were observed in the few-layer Bi2O2Se films epitaxially
grown on SrTiO3. However, after reducing the thickness of epitaxial Bi2O2Se
film to one unit cell limit with giant Rashba parameter of 440 meV.A, both odd-
and even-integer states can show up simultaneously in this 2D Janus film.
Theoretical calculations revealed that such absence of odd-integer states,
i.e., a suppressed Zeeman splitting, stems from a unique hidden Rashba effect
in the inversion-symmetric Bi2O2Se. However, this hidden Rashba effect can be
further broken down due to tunable inversion-symmetry breaking. Our work
highlights the extraordinary controllability of quantized states at the atomic
level and further provides an unprecedented path to explore and handle novel
spin textures and ground states.

</p><i>Shuai Yang, Zhiyu Dong, Yan Chen</i>
<p>We explore numerically the intricate interplay between Berry phases in both
real and momentum spaces within itinerant magnets. This interplay manifests as
an emergent spin-orbit coupling, where charge carriers occupying a Berry-curved
band generate an orbital magnetization, inducing a pseudo-magnetic field
originating in chiral spin textures. Using density-matrix-renormalization-group
techniques, we demonstrate that switching on a band Berry curvature in a
metallic ferromagnetic phase results in chiral magnetic textures. Furthermore,
employing a two-leg strip geometry, we establish a connection between charge
and spin chirality, further supporting this emergent spin-orbit interaction.

<h3>Revealing Symmetry-broken Superconducting Configurations by Density  Functional Theory</h3>

</p><i>Zi-Kui Liu, Shun-Li Shang</i>
<p>A coherent theory for both conventional and unconventional superconductors is
currently lacking. Here we show that the electron charge densities of Al,
YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO), and LaH10 along with Pb and Nb3Sn share the same feature of
electron charge gains in their respective superconducting configurations (SCCs)
predicted by first-principles calculations based on the density functional
theory (DFT). It is discovered that the formation of SCCs is due to the local
symmetry breaking from their normal conducting configurations (NCCs), and the
electron charge gains in SCCs form electron tunnels in crystals that resemble
pontoons, thus termed as electron pontoon tunnel (EPT) here. The nuclei
promoting the formation of EPTs in conventional superconductors have strong
bonding with other nuclei, resulting in their EPTs easily destroyed and thus
low superconducting critical temperature (Tc), while in unconventional
superconductor, this bonding is very weak as shown by negative stretching force
constants in YBCO, thus resulting in much higher Tc. The fundamental
understanding of SCCs and the capability to predict them by DFT enable
theoretical search of room temperature superconductors without empirical
models.

<p>Flat bands play a central role in hosting emergent states of matter in many
condensed matter systems, from the nascent insulating states of twisted bilayer
graphene to the fractionalized excitations found in frustrated magnets and
quantum Hall materials. Here, we report on the experimental realization of
highly tunable flat-band models populated by strongly interacting Rydberg
atoms. Using the approach of synthetic dimensions, we engineer a flat-band
rhombic lattice with twisted boundaries, and through nonequilibrium dynamics we
explore the control of Aharonov--Bohm (AB) caging via a tunable $U(1)$ gauge
field. Through microscopic measurements of Rydberg pairs, we explore the
interaction-driven breakdown of AB caging in the limit of strong dipolar
interactions that mix the lattice bands. In the limit of weak interactions,
where caging remains intact, we observe an effective magnetism that arises due
to the interaction-driven mixing of degenerate flat-band states. These
observations of strongly correlated flat-band dynamics open the door to
explorations of new emergent phenomena in synthetic quantum materials.

<h3>Charge and spin current pumping by ultrafast demagnetization dynamics</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00779" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00779</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jalil Varela-Manjarres, Ali Kefayati, M. Benjamin Jungfleisch, John Q. Xiao, Branislav K. Nikolic</i>
<p>The surprising discovery of ultrafast demagnetization -- where electric field
of femtosecond laser pulse couples to electrons of a ferromagnetic (FM) layer
causing its magnetization vector {\em to shrink while not rotating}, is also
assumed to be accompanied by generation of spin current in the direction
orthogonal to electric field. However, understanding of the microscopic origin
of such spin current and how efficiently it can be converted into charge
current, as the putative source of THz radiation, is lacking despite nearly
three decades of intense studies. Here we connect the standard pumping
phenomena driven by microwave precession of magnetization vector replacing
periodic time-dependence of magnetization precession with nonperiodic
time-dependence of demagnetization, as obtained from experiments on
ultrafast-light-driven Ni layer. Applying time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's
functions, able to evolve such setup with arbitrary time dependence, reveals
how demagnetization dynamics pumps both charge and spin currents in directions
both parallel and orthogonal to electric field of laser pulse, even in the
absence of spin-orbit coupling and thereby induced spin-to-charge conversion
mechanisms. Although pumped currents follow $dM_z/dt$ in some setups, this
becomes obscured when NM layers are disconnected and pumped currents start to
reflect from FM boundaries (as is the case of experimental setups). Finally, we
use the Jefimenko equations to compute electromagnetic radiation by charge
current pumped in disconnected setup during demagnetization, or later during
its slow recovery, unraveling that radiated electric field only in the former
time interval exhibits features in 0.1--30 THz frequency range probed
experimentally or explored for applications of spintronic THz emitters.

<h3>Nonreciprocal superfluidlike topological spin transport</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Alexey A. Kovalev, Bo Li, Edward Schwartz</i>
<p>We study superfluidlike spin transport facilitated by thermal diffusion of
magnetic domain walls, where the positive and negative chiralities of domain
walls act as opposite topological charges. The topological charge conservation
leads to algebraic decay of the topological current, allowing for the transport
of spin over extended distances. We demonstrate that the presence of the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction can lead to nonreciprocity in topological
flow. In one scenario, the nonreciprocity arises due to diode-like behavior
where the nucleation of domain walls is governed by thermal activation for one
direction of spin current and by viscous injection for the other direction of
spin current. We confirm our predictions by micromagnetic simulations of domain
walls in TmIG nanowire.

<h3>Intrinsic conductance of ferroelectric domain walls</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Feng Yang</i>
<p>Ferroelectric domain walls hold great promise for innovative applications in
ferroelectric devices. However, the underlying mechanisms behind the observed
giant conductance of charged domain walls remain poorly understood. Using a
first-principles approach that incorporates Boltzmann transport theory and the
relaxation time approximation, we determine the carrier concentration,
mobility, and conductivity of domain walls with head-to-head and tail-to-tail
polarization orientations. Our systematic exploration reveals that the
accumulation of carriers, particularly their concentration, plays a dominant
role in the domain wall conductance mechanism. However, the observed
conductance differences between head-to-head and tail-to-tail domain walls are
primarily due to differences in carrier mobility. The width of the domain wall
is a key factor determining the device scale. Our calculated domain wall width
is significantly smaller than previously reported values. This method, not
limited to a certain ferroelectric material, can be used for the optimization
and application development of various domain wall materials and devices.

<h3>Octupolar edge state in an $e_g$ orbital system on a square lattice</h3>

</p><i>Katsunori Kubo</i>
<p>A tight-binding model for $e_g$ orbitals on a square lattice is investigated.
We consider only the nearest-neighbor hopping and the model is characterized by
two hopping parameters, $t_1$ and $t_2$. There are Dirac points in the
electronic band structure and the type of the Dirac points (type-I or type-II)
depends on the ratio $t_2/t_1$. For the case of the type-I Dirac points, edge
states appear for a lattice with edges perpendicular to the $[11]$ direction.
The edge states at a certain momentum along the edges have octupole moments
with opposite signs between the right and left edges. Thus, these edge states
can be called helical octupolar edge states. This study bridges the research
fields of topological phenomena and multipole physics.

</p><i>Ashkan Shekaari</i>
<p>Nanoscale CAMS (computer-aided materials simulation) within the framework of
density functional theory (DFT) has been applied to investigate electronic
structure of molybdenene monolayer in both its hexagonal and triclinic
eigen-structures as observed formerly in the lab. In agreement with
experimental findings, and based on electronic band structure and density of
states (DOS) calculations, it has been found that both monolayers are metallic
Dirac materials, known as metallic relative of graphene in the literature.
Partial DOS analyses have also revealed that both Mo atoms of the unit cells
have exactly the same contributions to the metallic property observed, the
largest of which, compared to the rest, emerge from the $d$ valence orbitals
due to being both half-empty as well as the outermost (then containing
weakest-bound electrons), giving charge carriers a higher kinetic/movement
degree of freedom to conduct electricity, governed by Pauli's exclusion
principle.

<p>Owing to the unique features of low Gilbert damping, long spin-diffusion
lengths and zero Ohmic losses, magnetic insulators are promising candidate
materials for next-generation spintronic applications. However, due to the
localized magnetic moments and the complex metal-oxide interface between
magnetic insulators and heavy metals, spin-functional Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interactions or spin Hall and Edelstein effects are weak, which diminishes the
performance of these typical building blocks for spintronic devices. Here, we
exploit the exchange coupling between metallic and insulating magnets for
efficient electrical manipulation of heavy metal/magnetic insulator
heterostructures. By inserting a thin Co layer, we enhance the spin-orbit
torque efficiency by more than 20 times, which significantly reduces the
switching current density. Moreover, we demonstrate field-free current-induced
magnetization switching caused by a symmetry-breaking non-collinear magnetic
texture. Our work launches magnetic insulators as an alternative platform for
low-power spintronic devices.

<p>The evolution of AI and high-throughput technologies has boosted a rapid
increase in the number of new materials, challenging our computational ability
to comprehensively analyze their properties. Relaxed crystal structures often
serve as the foundational basis for further property calculations. However,
determining equilibrium structures traditionally involves computationally
expensive iterative calculations. Here, we develop DeepRelax, an efficient deep
generative model designed for rapid structural relaxation without any iterative
process. DeepRelax learns the equilibrium structural distribution, enabling it
to predict relaxed structures directly from their unrelaxed counterparts. The
ability to perform structural relaxation in just a few hundred milliseconds per
structure, combined with the scalability of parallel processing, makes
DeepRelax particularly useful for large-scale virtual screening. To demonstrate
the universality of DeepRelax, we benchmark it against three different
databases of X-Mn-O oxides, Materials Project, and Computational 2D Materials
Database with various types of materials. In these tests, DeepRelax exhibits
both high accuracy and efficiency in structural relaxation, as further
validated by DFT calculations. Finally, we integrate DeepRelax with an
implementation of uncertainty quantification, enhancing its reliability and
trustworthiness in material discovery. This work provides an efficient and
trustworthy method to significantly accelerate large-scale computations,
offering substantial advancements in the field of computational materials
science.

<h3>First-principles study of defects and doping limits in CaO</h3>

</p><i>Zhenkun Yuan, Geoffroy Hautier</i>
<p>Calcium oxide (CaO) is a promising host for quantum defects because of its
ultrawide band gap and potential for long spin coherence times. Using hybrid
functional calculations, we investigate the intrinsic point defects and how
they limit Fermi-level positions and doping in CaO. Our results reveal calcium
and oxygen vacancies to be the most common intrinsic defects, acting as
compensating acceptors and donors, respectively. Oxygen interstitials are also
prevailing under O-rich conditions and act as compensating donors. Due to
compensation by these defects, O-poor conditions are required to dope CaO
n-type, while O-rich conditions are required for p-type doping. We find that,
at room temperature, intrinsic CaO can only achieve Fermi-level positions
between 1.76 eV above the valence-band maximum (VBM) and 1.73 eV below the
conduction-band minimum (CBM). If suitable shallow dopants can be found, the
allowed range of Fermi levels would increase to between VBM+0.53 eV and
CBM-0.27 eV and is set by the compensating intrinsic defects. Additionally, we
study hydrogen impurities, and show that hydrogen will limit p-type doping but
can also act as shallow donor when substituting oxygen ($\mathrm{H}_\mathrm{O}$
defects).

<p>Inspired by the recent discovery of a new polar metal LiReO$_3$ by K.
Murayama, \textit{et al}, we calculate the temperature($T$)-dependent crystal
structures of Li$B$O3 with $B$ = Ta, W, Re, Os, using the self-consistent
phonon (SCPH) theory. We have reproduced the experimentally observed
polar-nonpolar structural phase transitions and the transition temperatures
($T_c$) of LiTaO$_3$, LiReO$_3$, and LiOsO$_3$. From the calculation, we
predict that LiWO$_3$ is a polar metal, which is yet to be tested
experimentally. Upon doping electrons to the insulating LiTaO$_3$, the
predicted $T_c$ is quickly suppressed and approaches those of the polar metals.
Thus, there is a continuous crossover between ferroelectric insulators and
polar metals if we dope electrons to the polar metals. Investigating the
detailed material dependence of the interatomic force constants (IFCs), we
explicitly show that the suppression of $T_c$ in polar metals can be ascribed
to the screening of the long-range Li-O interaction, which is caused by the
presence of the itinerant electrons.

free software FreeFem for computing the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) spectrum of
stationary solutions to one- and two-component Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations,
in two or three spatial dimensions. The parallelization of the toolbox relies
exclusively upon the recent interfacing of FreeFem with the PETSc library. The
latter contains itself a wide palette of state-of-the-art linear algebra
libraries, graph partitioners, mesh generation and domain decomposition tools,
as well as a suite of eigenvalue solvers that are embodied in the SLEPc
library. Within the present toolbox, stationary states of the GP equations are
computed by a Newton method. Branches of solutions are constructed using an
adaptive step-size continuation algorithm. The combination of mesh adaptivity
tools from FreeFem with the parallelization features from PETSc makes the
toolbox efficient and reliable for the computation of stationary states. Their
BdG spectrum is computed using the SLEPc eigenvalue solver. We perform
extensive tests and validate our programs by comparing the toolbox's results
with known theoretical and numerical findings that have been reported in the
literature.

<p>To understand the alkali-metal-dependent material properties of recently
discovered $A$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, and Cs), we conducted a detailed
electronic structure analysis based on first-principles density functional
theory calculations. Contrary to the case of $A$ = K and Rb, the energetic
positions of the low-lying Van Hove singularities are reversed in
CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, and the characteristic higher-order Van Hove point gets
closer to the Fermi level. We found that this notable difference can be
attributed to the chemical effect, apart from structural differences. Due to
their different orbital compositions, Van Hove points show qualitatively
different responses to the structure changes. A previously unnoticed highest
lying point can be lowered, locating close to or even below the other ones in
response to a reasonable range of bi- and uni-axial strain. Our results can be
useful in better understanding the material-dependent features reported in this
family and in realizing experimental control of exotic quantum phases.

<p>As thermoelectric generators can convert waste heat into electricity, they
play an important role in energy harvesting. The metal chalcogenide AgBiSe2 is
one of the high-performance thermoelectric materials with low lattice thermal
conductivity (klat), but it exhibits temperature-dependent crystal structural
transitions from hexagonal to rhombohedral, and finally a cubic phase as the
temperature rises. The high figure-of-merit ZT is obtained only for the
high-temperature cubic phase. In this study, we utilized the high-entropy-alloy
(HEA) concept for AgBiSe2 to stabilize the cubic phase throughout the entire
temperature range with enhanced thermoelectric performance. We synthesized
high-entropy-type AgBiSe2-2xSxTex bulk polycrystals and realized the
stabilization of the cubic phase from room temperature to 800 K for x > 0.6.
The ultra-low klat at of 0.30 Wm^-1K^-1 and the high peak ZT 0.9 at around 750
K were realized for cubic AgBiSe2-2xSxTex without carrier tuning. In addition,
the average ZT value of x = 0.6 and 0.7 for the temperature range of 360-750 K
increased to 0.38 and 0.40, respectively, which are comparable to the highest
previously reported values.

<p>Strongly correlated electron systems with a kagome lattice can host abundant
exotic quantum states such as superconductivity and spin/charge density waves
(CDW) due to the complicated interactions between different degrees of freedoms
in the framework of a unique two-dimensional geometrically frustrated lattice
structure. Recently, successive orders of A-type antiferromagnetism (AFM),
$2\times2\times2$ CDW and canted double-cone AFM have been manifested upon
cooling in magnetic kagome FeGe. However, the mechanism of the CDW order and
its interaction with magnetism are presently enigmatic at best. Here we
investigate the evolution of CDW order with temperature across the spin canting
transition in FeGe by single-crystal x-ray diffraction. Refinements of its
modulated structure are presented using the superspace approach. Interestingly,
the superlattice reflections originating from CDW-induced long-range structural
modulation become extremely weak after the system enters the canted AFM while a
$2\times2$ CDW in the $ab$ plane persists as a long-range order demonstrated by
strong electronic modulation in the d$I$/d$V$ map of scanning tunneling
spectroscopy. We discovered a novel CDW order without long-range structural
modulation in FeGe probably because of the competition between CDW and canted
AFM in determining the underlying crystal structure. In addition, occupational
modulations of Ge1 atoms located in the kagome plane and displacive modulations
of all the atoms were extracted from the refinements, confirming the existence
of Ge atom dimerization along the $c$ axis as the major distortion and
indicating a dynamic transformation between different CDW domains.

<p>Cyclic loading on granular packings and amorphous media exhibits a transition
from reversible elastic behavior to irreversible plasticity. The present study
compares the irreversibility transition and microscopic details of colloidal
polycrystals under oscillatory tensile-compressive and shear strain. Under both
modes, the systems exhibit a reversible to irreversible transition. However,
the strain amplitude at which the transition is observed is larger in the shear
strain than in the tensile-compressive mode. The threshold strain amplitude is
confirmed by analyzing the dynamical properties, such as mobility and atomic
strain (von-Mises shear strain and the volumetric strain). The structural
changes are quantified using a hexatic order parameter. Under both modes of
deformation, dislocations and grain boundaries in polycrystals disappear, and
monocrystals are formed. We also recognize the dislocation motion through
grains. The key difference is that strain accumulates diagonally in oscillatory
tensile-compressive deformation, whereas, in shear deformation, strain
accumulation is along the $x$ or $y$ axis.

<p>The valley degree of freedom in 2D materials can be manipulated for
low-dissipation quantum electronics called valleytronics. At the boundary
between two regions of bilayer graphene with different atomic or electrostatic
configuration, valley-polarized current has been realized. However, the
demanding fabrication and operation requirements limit device reproducibility
and scalability toward more advanced valleytronics circuits. We demonstrate a
new device architecture of a point junction where a valley-chiral 0D PN
junction is easily configured, switchable, and capable of carrying valley
current with an estimated polarization of ~80%. This work provides a new
building block in manipulating valley quantum numbers and scalable
valleytronics.

<p>We investigate irreversible aggregation processes driven by a source of small
mass clusters. In the spatially homogeneous situation, a well-mixed system is
consists of clusters of various masses whose concentrations evolve according to
an infinite system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. We focus on
the cluster mass distribution in the long time limit. An input-driven
aggregation with rates proportional to the product of merging partners
undergoes a percolation transition. We examine this process analytically and
numerically. There are two theoretical schemes and two natural ways of
numerical integration on the level of a truncated system with a finite number
of equations. After the percolation transition, the behavior depends on the
adopted approach: The giant component quickly engulfs the entire system (Flory
approach), or a non-trivial stationary mass distribution emerges (Stockmayer
approach). We also outline generalization to ternary aggregation.

<p>The phase-field method has become a useful tool for the simulation of
classical metallurgical phase transformations as well as other phenomena
related to materials science. The thermodynamic consistency that forms the
basis of these formulations lends to its strong predictive capabilities and
utility. However, a strong impediment to the usage of the method for typical
applied problems of industrial and academic relevance is the significant
overhead with regard to the code development and know-how required for
quantitative model formulations. In this paper, we report the development of an
open-source phase-field software stack that contains generic formulations for
the simulation of multi-phase and multi-component phase transformations. The
solvers incorporate thermodynamic coupling that allows the realization of
simulations with real alloys in scenarios directly relevant to the materials
industry. Further, the solvers utilize parallelization strategies using either
multiple CPUs or GPUs to provide cross-platform portability and usability on
available supercomputing machines. Finally, the solver stack also contains a
graphical user interface to gradually introduce the usage of the software. The
user interface also provides a collection of post-processing tools that allow
the estimation of useful metrics related to microstructural evolution.

<h3>Wiedemann-Franz law violation domain for graphene and nonrelativistic  systems</h3>

</p><i>Thandar Zaw Win, Cho Win Aung, Gaurav Khandal, Sabyasachi Ghosh</i>
<p>Systematic and comparative research on Lorenz ratios for graphene and
nonrelativistic systems has been studied to identify their Wiedemann-Franz law
violation domain. Fermi energy and temperature are the main governing
parameters for deciding the values of the Lorenz ratio, which is basically
thermal conductivity divided by electrical conductivity times temperature times
Lorenz number. Metals as three-dimensional nonrelativistic electron gas locate
at higher Fermi-energy by temperature domain, where Lorenz ratio remains one.
Hence, they obey the Wiedemann-Franz law. By creating higher doping in a
two-dimensional graphene system, one can again reach a higher Fermi-energy by
temperature domain and get a constant Lorenz ratio. For both graphene and
non-relativistic systems, the Lorenz ratio goes below one if we go lower
Fermi-energy by temperature domain, which is possible for the graphene system
by decreasing the doping concentration. Experimentally observed greater than
one Lorenz ratio in this lower Fermi-energy by temperature domain or Dirac
Fluid domain indicates that non-fluid expressions of Lorenz ratio should be
replaced by fluid-type expressions. We have noticed a divergent trend of Lorenz
ratio in the Dirac Fluid domain using its fluid-type expression, and it matches
with the trend of experimental data.

<h3>Topological phases and edge modes of an uneven ladder</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01097" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01097</a>
<br>
</p><i>Wen-Chuang Shang, Yi-Ning Han, Shimpei Endo, Chao Gao</i>
<p>We investigate the topological properties of a two-chain quantum ladder with
uneven legs, i.e. the two chains differ in their periods by a factor of two.
Such an uneven ladder presents rich band structures classified by the closure
of either direct or indirect bandgaps. It also provides opportunities to
explore fundamental concepts concerning band topology and edge modes, including
the difference of intracellular and intercellular Zak phases, and the role of
the inversion symmetry (IS). We calculate the Zak phases of the two kinds and
find excellent agreement with the dipole moment and extra charge accumulation,
respectively. We also find that configurations with IS feature a pair of
degenerate two-side edge modes emerging as the closure of the direct bandgap,
while configurations without IS feature one-side edge modes emerging as not
only the closure of both direct and indirect bandgap but also within the band
continuum. Furthermore, by projecting to the two sublattices, we find that the
effective Bloch Hamiltonian corresponds to that of a generalized
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model or Rice-Mele model whose hopping amplitudes depend
on the quasimomentum. In this way, the topological phases can be efficiently
extracted through winding numbers. We propose that uneven ladders can be
realized by spin-dependent optical lattices and their rich topological
characteristics can be examined by near future experiments.

<h3>Exact moments for trapped active particles: inertial impact on  steady-state properties and re-entrance</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Manish Patel, Debasish Chaudhuri</i>
<p>In this study, we investigate the behavior of inertial active Brownian
particles in a $d$-dimensional harmonic trap in the presence of translational
diffusion. While the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation is generally
challenging, it can be utilized to compute the exact time evolution of all
time-dependent dynamical moments using a Laplace transform approach. We present
the explicit form for several moments of position and velocity in
$d$-dimensions. An interplay of time scales assures that the effective
diffusivity and steady-state kinetic temperature depend on both inertia and
trap strength, unlike passive systems. We present detailed `phase diagrams'
using kurtosis of velocity and position showing possibilities of re-entrance.

<br>
</p><i>M. Iskin</i>
<p>Considering a spin-up and a spin-down fermion in a generic tight-binding
lattice with a multi-site basis, here we study the two-body problem using a
multiband extended-Hubbard model with arbitrary but finite-ranged hopping and
interaction parameters. We derive a linear eigenvalue problem for the entire
two-body spectrum, alongside a nonlinear eigenvalue problem for the bound
states in the form of a self-consistency equation. Our results are based on an
exact variational approach and their versatility offers practical applications
in a broad range of lattice geometries. As an illustration, we apply them to
the linear-chain model and demonstrate that the resultant spin singlet and
triplet bound states are in perfect agreement with the existing literature.

<h3>An atomic-scale perspective on individual thiol-terminated molecules  anchored to single S vacancies in MoS$_2$</h3>

<p>Sulphur vacancies in MoS$_2$ on Au(111) have been shown to be negatively
charged as reflected by a Kondo resonance. Here, we use scanning tunneling
microscopy to show that these vacancies serve as anchoring sites for
thiol-based molecules (CF$_3$-3P-SH) with two distinct reaction products, one
of them showing a Kondo resonance. Based on comparisons with density-functional
theory (DFT) calculations, including a random structure search and computation
of energies and electronic properties at a hybrid exchange-correlation
functional level, we conclude that both anchored molecules are charge neutral.
One of them is an anchored intact CF$_3$-3P-SH molecule while the other one is
the result of catalytically activated dehydrogenation to CF$_3$-3P-S with
subsequent anchoring. Our investigations highlight a perspective of
functionalizing defects with thiol-terminated molecules that can be equipped
with additional functional groups, such as charge donor- or acceptor-moieties,
switching units or magnetic centers.

<h3>Thermodynamic dissipation does not bound replicator growth and decay  rates</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01130" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01130</a>
<br>
</p><i>Artemy Kolchinsky</i>
<p>In a well-known paper, Jeremy England derived a bound on the free energy
dissipated by a self-replicating system [England, "Statistical physics of
self-replication", The Journal of Chemical Physics, 2013]. This bound is
usually interpreted as a universal relationship that links thermodynamic
dissipation to the replicator's per-capita decay and growth rates. Contrary to
this interpretation, we argue from thermodynamic principles that such a
relationship cannot exist. In particular, we show that it is impossible for a
system to undergo both replication and per-capita decay back into reactants.
While it is possible for a system to undergo replication and decay into
separate waste products, in that case replication and decay are two independent
physical processes, and there is no universal relationship between their
thermodynamic and dynamical properties.

<h3>Hitting probabilities for fast stochastic search</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Samantha Linn, Sean D. Lawley</i>
<p>Many physical phenomena are modeled as stochastic searchers looking for
targets. In these models, the probability that a searcher finds a particular
target, its so-called hitting probability, is often of considerable interest.
In this work we determine hitting probabilities for stochastic search processes
conditioned on being faster than a random short time. Such times have been used
to model stochastic resetting or stochastic inactivation. These results apply
to any search process, diffusive or otherwise, whose unconditional short-time
behavior can be adequately approximated, which we characterize for broad
classes of stochastic search. We illustrate these results in several examples
and show that the conditional hitting probabilities depend predominantly on the
relative geodesic lengths between the initial position of the searcher and the
targets. Finally, we apply these results to a canonical evidence accumulation
model for decision making.

<h3>Dielectric Screening Inside Carbon Nanotubes</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Georgy Gordeev, Sören Wasserroth, Han Li, Ado Jorio, Benjamin S. Flavel, Stephanie Reich</i>
<p>Dielectric screening plays a vital role for the physical properties in the
nanoscale and also alters our ability to detect and characterize nanomaterials
by optical techniques. We study the dielectric screening inside of carbon
nanotubes and how it changes electromagnetic fields and many-body effects for
encapsulated nanostructures. First, we show that the local electric field
inside a nanotube is altered by one-dimensional screening with dramatic effects
on the effective Raman scattering efficiency of the encapsulated species for
metallic walls. The scattering intensity of the inner tube is two orders of
magnitude weaker than for the tube in air, which is nicely reproduced by local
field calculations. Secondly, we find that the optical transition energies of
the inner nanotubes shift to lower energies compared to a single-walled carbon
nanotubes of the same chirality. The shift is higher if the outer tube is
metallic than when it is semiconducting. The magnitude of the shift suggests
that the excitons of small diameter inner metallic tubes are thermally
dissociated at room temperate if the outer tube is also metallic and in essence
we observe band-to-band transitions.

<h3>High-temperature domain wall current in Mg-doped lithium niobate single  crystals up to 400°C</h3>

<p>Conductive ferroelectric domain walls (DWs) represent a promising topical
system for the development of nanoelectronic components and devices. DWs may
show very different properties as compared to their bulk counterparts. Of
central interest here is the domain wall current (DWC) of charged DWs in 5mol%
Mg-doped lithium niobate single crystals; in contrast to former works, we
extend the DWC study here to temperatures as high as 400{\deg}C. Both the
temporal stability and the thermal activation energies of 100 - 160 meV are
readily deduced from current-voltage sweeps as recorded over multiple heating
cycles. Our experimental work is backed up by atomistic modelling of the DWC.
The latter suggests that a large band bending renders head-to-head (H2H) and
tail-to-tail (T2T) DWs semimetallic. These detailed investigations underline
the potential to extending DWC-based nanoelectronic applications even into the
so-far unexplored high-temperature regime.

<h3>Beyond Linear Response: Equivalence between Thermodynamic Geometry and  Optimal Transport</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01286" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01286</a>
<br>
</p><i>Adrianne Zhong, Michael R. DeWeese</i>
<p>A fundamental result of thermodynamic geometry is that the optimal,
minimal-work protocol that drives a nonequilibrium system between two
thermodynamic states in the slow-driving limit is given by a geodesic of the
friction tensor, a Riemannian metric defined on control space. For overdamped
dynamics in arbitrary dimensions, we demonstrate that thermodynamic geometry is
equivalent to $L^2$ optimal transport geometry defined on the space of
equilibrium distributions corresponding to the control parameters. We show that
obtaining optimal protocols past the slow-driving or linear response regime is
computationally tractable as the sum of a friction tensor geodesic and a
counterdiabatic term related to the Fisher information metric. These
geodesic-counterdiabatic optimal protocols are exact for parameteric harmonic
potentials, reproduce the surprising non-monotonic behavior recently discovered
in linearly-biased double well optimal protocols, and explain the ubiquitous
discontinuous jumps observed at the beginning and end times.
