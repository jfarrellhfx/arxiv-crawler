<h3>Transport properties in non-Fermi liquid phases of nodal-point  semimetals</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08635" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08635</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ipsita Mandal, Hermann Freire</i>
<p>In this review, we survey the current progress in computing transport
properties in semimetals which harbour non-Fermi liquid phases. We first
discuss the widely used Kubo formalism, which can be applied to the effective
theory describing the stable non-Fermi liquid pase obtained via a
renormalization group procedure and, hence, is applicable for temperatures
close to zero (e.g., optical conductivity). For finite temperature regimes,
which apply to the computations of the generalized dc conductivity tensors, we
elucidate the memory matrix approach. This approach is based on an effective
hydrodynamic description of the system, and is especially suited for tackling
transport calculations in strongly-interacting quantum field theories, because
it does not rely on the existence of long-lived quasiparticles. As a concrete
example, we apply these two approaches to find the response of the so-called
Luttinger-Abrikosov-Benelavskii phase of isotropic three-dimensional Luttinger
semimetals, which arise under the effects of long-ranged (unscreened) Coulomb
interactions, with the chemical potential fine-tuned to cut exactly the nodal
point. In particular, we focus on the electric conductivity tensors, thermal
and thermoelectric response, Raman response, free energy, entropy density, and
shear viscosity.

<h3>A Microscopic Perspective on Moir√© Materials</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08044" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08044</a>
<br>
</p><i>Kevin P. Nuckolls, Ali Yazdani</i>
<p>Contemporary quantum materials research is guided by themes of topology and
of electronic correlations. A confluence of these two themes is engineered in
"moir\'e materials", an emerging class of highly tunable, strongly correlated
two-dimensional (2D) materials designed by the rotational or lattice
misalignment of atomically thin crystals. In moir\'e materials, dominant
Coulomb interactions among electrons give rise to collective electronic phases,
often with robust topological properties. Identifying the mechanisms
responsible for these exotic phases is fundamental to our understanding of
strongly interacting quantum systems, and to our ability to engineer new
material properties for potential future technological applications. In this
Review, we highlight the contributions of local spectroscopic, thermodynamic,
and electromagnetic probes to the budding field of moir\'e materials research.
These techniques have not only identified many of the underlying mechanisms of
the correlated insulators, generalized Wigner crystals, unconventional
superconductors, moir\'e ferroelectrics, and topological orbital ferromagnets
found in moir\'e materials, but they have also uncovered fragile quantum phases
that have evaded spatially averaged global probes. Furthermore, we highlight
recently developed local probe techniques, including local charge sensing and
quantum interference probes, that have uncovered new physical observables in
moir\'e materials.

<h3>High thermoelectric power factor through topological flat bands</h3>

<p>Thermoelectric (TE) materials are useful for applications such as waste heat
harvesting or efficient and targeted cooling. While various strategies towards
superior thermoelectrics through a reduction of the lattice thermal
conductivity have been developed, a path to enhance the power factor is
pressing. Here, we report large power factors up to 5 mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ at
room temperature in the kagome metal Ni$_3$In$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$. This system is
predicted to feature almost dispersionless flat bands in conjunction with
highly dispersive Dirac-like bands in its electronic structure around the Fermi
energy $E_\text{F}$ [L. Ye et al., Nature Physics 1-5 (2024)]. Within this
study, we experimentally and theoretically showcase that tuning this flat band
precisely below $E_\text{F}$ by chemical doping $x$ boosts the Seebeck
coefficient and power factor, as highly mobile charge carriers scatter into the
flat-band states. Our work demonstrates the prospect of engineering extremely
flat and highly dispersive bands towards the Fermi energy in kagome metals and
introduces topological flat bands as a novel tuning knob for thermoelectrics.

<h3>High temperature transport in the one dimensional mass-imbalanced  Fermi-Hubbard model</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08076" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08076</a>
<br>
</p><i>Thomas G. Kiely, Erich J. Mueller</i>
<p>We study transport in the one-dimensional mass-imbalanced Fermi-Hubbard model
at infinite temperature, focusing on the case of strong interactions. Prior
theoretical and experimental investigations have revealed unconventionally long
transport timescales, with complications due to strong finite size effects. We
compute the dynamical current-current correlation function directly in the
thermodynamic limit using infinite tensor network techniques. We show that
transport in the strong-imbalance limit is dominated by AC resonances, which we
compute with an analytic expansion. We study the dephasing of these resonances
with mass imbalance, $\eta$. In the small-imbalance limit, the model is nearly
integrable. We connect these unusual limits by computing the DC conductivity
and transport decay time as a function of $\eta$ and the interaction strength
$U/t$. We propose an experimental protocol to measure these correlation
functions in cold atom experiments.

<h3>Comparing quantum fluctuations in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ and spin-$1$  XXZ Heisenberg models on square and honeycomb lattices</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08099" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08099</a>
<br>
</p><i>Masahiro Kadosawa, Masaaki Nakamura, Yukinori Ohta, Satoshi Nishimoto</i>
<p>We present a detailed investigation of the XXZ Heisenberg model for
spin-$1/2$ and spin-$1$ systems on square and honeycomb lattices. Utilizing the
density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, complemented by Spiral
Boundary Conditions (SBC) for mapping two-dimensional (2D) clusters onto
one-dimensional (1D) chains, we meticulously explore the evolution of staggered
magnetization and spin gaps across a broad spectrum of easy-axis anisotropies.
Our study reveals that, despite the lower site coordination number of honeycomb
lattice, which intuitively suggests increased quantum fluctuations in its
N\'eel phase compared to the square lattice, the staggered magnetization in the
honeycomb structure exhibits only a marginal reduction. Furthermore, our
analysis demonstrates that the dependence of staggered magnetization on the XXZ
anisotropy $\Delta$, except in close proximity to $\Delta=1$, aligns with
series expansion predictions up to the 12th order. Notably, for the $S=1/2$
honeycomb lattice, deviations from the 10th order series expansion predictions
near the isotropic Heisenberg limit emphasize the critical influence of quantum
fluctuations on the spin excitation in its N\'eel state. Additionally, our
findings are numerically consistent with the singular behavior of the spin gap
near the isotropic Heisenberg limit as forecasted by spin-wave theory. The
successful implementation of SBC marks a methodological advancement,
streamlining the computational complexity involved in analyzing 2D models and
paving the way for more precise determinations of physical properties in
complex lattice systems.

<h3>Tunneling magnetoresistance in MgO tunnel junctions with Fe-based leads  in empirically corrected density functional theory</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08103" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08103</a>
<br>
</p><i>G. G. Baez Flores, M. van Schilfgaarde, K. D. Belashchenko</i>
<p>The minority-spin Fe/MgO interface states are at the Fermi level in density
functional theory (DFT), but experimental evidence and GW calculations place
them slightly higher in energy. This small shift can strongly influence
tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) in junctions with a thin MgO barrier and its
dependence on the concentration of Co in the electrodes. Here, an empirical
potential correction to DFT is introduced to shift the interface states up to
match the tunnel spectroscopy data. With this shift, TMR in Fe/MgO/Fe junctions
exceeds 800% and 3000% at 3 and 4 monolayers (ML) of MgO, respectively. We
further consider the effect of alloying of the Fe electrodes with up to 30% Co
or 10% V, treating them in the coherent potential approximation (CPA). Alloying
with Co broadens the interface states and brings a large incoherent
minority-spin spectral weight to the Fermi level. Alloying with V brings the
minority-spin resonant states close to the Fermi level. However, in both cases
the minority-spin spectral weight at the Fermi level resides primarily at the
periphery of the Brillouin zone, which is favorable for spin filtering. Using
convolutions of $\mathbf{k}_\parallel$-resolved barrier densities of states
calculated in CPA, it is found that TMR is strongly reduced by alloying with Co
or V but still remains above 500% at 4 ML of MgO up to 30% of Co or 5% V. At 5
ML, the TMR increases above 1000% in all systems considered. On the other hand,
while TMR declines sharply with increasing bias up to 0.2 eV in the MTJ with
pure Fe leads, it remains almost constant up to 0.5 eV if leads are alloyed
with Co.

<h3>Understanding Disorder in Monolayer Graphene Devices with Gate-Defined  Superlattices</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08112" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08112</a>
<br>
</p><i>Vinay Kammarchedu, Derrick Butler, Asmaul Smitha Rashid, Aida Ebrahimi, Morteza Kayyalha</i>
<p>Engineering superlattices (SLs) - which are spatially periodic potential
landscapes for electrons - is an emerging approach for the realization of
exotic properties, including superconductivity and correlated insulators, in
two-dimensional materials. While moir\'e SL engineering has been a popular
approach, nanopatterning is an attractive alternative offering control over the
pattern and wavelength of the SL. However, the disorder arising in the system
due to imperfect nanopatterning is seldom studied. Here, by creating a square
lattice of nanoholes in the $SiO_2$ dielectric layer using nanolithography, we
study the superlattice potential and the disorder formed in hBN-graphene-hBN
heterostructures. Specifically, we observe that while electrical transport
shows distinct superlattice satellite peaks, the disorder of the device is
significantly higher than graphene devices without any SL. We use
finite-element simulations combined with a resistor network model to calculate
the effects of this disorder on the transport properties of graphene. We
consider three types of disorder: nanohole size variations, adjacent nanohole
mergers, and nanohole vacancies. Comparing our experimental results with the
model, we find that the disorder primarily originates from nanohole size
variations rather than nanohole mergers in square SLs. We further confirm the
validity of our model by comparing the results with quantum transport
simulations. Our findings highlight the applicability of our simple framework
to predict and engineer disorder in patterned SLs, specifically correlating
variations in the resultant SL patterns to the observed disorder. Our combined
experimental and theoretical results could serve as a valuable guide for
optimizing nanofabrication processes to engineer disorder in nanopatterned SLs.

<h3>Realistic Fr√∂hlich Scattering and Mobility of 2D Semiconductors in van  der Waals Heterostructure</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08114" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08114</a>
<br>
</p><i>Chenmu Zhang, Yuanyue Liu</i>
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have demonstrated great potential for
next-generation electronics and optoelectronics. Their atomic thinness
facilitates the material design for desirable electronic properties when
combined with other 2D materials in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure.
Although the carrier mobility has been well studied for suspended 2D
semiconductors via first-principles calculation recently, it is not clear how
they are affected by surrounding materials. In this work, we propose a model to
consider the Fr\"ohlich scattering, an important scattering in polar materials
from polar-optical (PO) phonons, in vdW heterostructures. Exemplified by InSe
surrounded by h-BN, we found the InSe Fr\"ohlich mobility can be enhanced about
2.5 times by environmental dielectric screening and coupled PO phonons in vdW
heterostructures. More interestingly, the strong remote PO phonons can enhance
the InSe mobility instead of deteriorating it once considering the PO phonons
coupling. Then several quantities of surrounding dielectrics are proposed to
optimize the InSe Fr\"ohlich mobility, and then used for filtering potential 2D
dielectric materials. Our work provides efficient calculation tools as well as
physical insights for carrier transport of 2D semiconductors in realistic vdW
heterostructures.

<h3>Two-dimensional Semiconductor Computational Carrier Mobility Genome</h3>

</p><i>Chenmu Zhang, Yuanyue Liu</i>
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) crystalline semiconductors hold promise for
next-generation electronic devices due to its atomical thickness and consequent
properties. Despite years of search, literature-reported 2D semiconductors
commonly suffered from low room-temperature charge mobility (< 200 cm2V-1s-1),
due to the dimensionality-increased 'density of scattering', undesirable
defects during fabrication and/or strong electron-phonon scattering. Therefore,
understanding charge scatterings in 2D semiconductors via computational tools
and discovering new 2D semiconductors with high mobility (> 1000 cm2V-1s-1) are
both desirable. Here we review the accurate ab initio approaches for
electron-phonon/defect/boundary scattering developed these years, and the
efforts made in high-mobility 2D semiconductor high throughput screening.
Starting from these studies, the common genome of high-mobility 2D
semiconductor are summarized and discussed, which would contribute to further
discovering of high mobility in 2D semiconductors.

<h3>Cavity engineered phonon-mediated superconductivity in MgB$_2$ from  first principles quantum electrodynamics</h3>

</p><i>I-Te Lu, Dongbin Shin, Hannes H√ºbener, Umberto De Giovannini, Simone Latini, Michael Ruggenthaler, Angel Rubio</i>
<p>Strong laser pulses can control superconductivity, inducing non-equilibrium
transient pairing by leveraging strong-light matter interaction. Here we
demonstrate theoretically that equilibrium ground-state phonon-mediated
superconductive pairing can be affected through the vacuum fluctuating
electromagnetic field in a cavity. Using the recently developed $\textit{ab
initio}$ quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory approximation, we
specifically investigate the phonon-mediated superconductive behavior of
MgB$_2$ under different cavity setups and find that in the strong-light matter
coupling regime its superconducting transition temperature can be enhanced by
$\approx 73\%$ ($\approx 40\%$) in an in-plane (out-of-plane) polarized cavity.
The results highlight that strong-light matter coupling in extended systems can
profoundly alter material properties in a non-perturbative way by modifying
their electronic structure and phononic dispersion at the same time. Our
findings indicate a pathway to the experimental realization of light-controlled
superconductivity in solid-state materials at equilibrium via cavity-material
engineering.

<h3>Effects of clustering heterogeneity on the spectral density of sparse  networks</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08152" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08152</a>
<br>
</p><i>Tuan Minh Pham, Thomas Peron, Fernando L. Metz</i>
<p>We derive exact equations for the spectral density of sparse networks with an
arbitrary distribution of the number of single edges and triangles per node.
These equations enable a systematic investigation of the effect of clustering
on the spectral properties of the network adjacency matrix. In the case of
heterogeneous networks, we demonstrate that the spectral density becomes more
symmetric as the fluctuations in the triangle-degree sequence increase. This
phenomenon is explained by the small clustering coefficient of networks with a
large variance of the triangle-degree distribution. In the homogeneous case of
regular clustered networks, we find that both perturbative and non-perturbative
approximations fail to predict the spectral density in the high-connectivity
limit. This suggests that traditional large-degree approximations may be
ineffective in studying the spectral properties of networks with more complex
motifs. Our theoretical results are fully confirmed by numerical
diagonalizations of finite adjacency matrices.

<h3>Magnonic Thermal Machines</h3>

<br>
</p><i>N. Vidal-Silva, Francisco J. Pe√±a, Roberto E. Troncoso, Patricio Vargas</i>
<p>We propose a magnon-based thermal machine in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic
insulators. The thermodynamical cycles are engineered by exposing a magnon spin
system to thermal baths at different temperatures and tuning the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. We find for the Otto cycle that a
thermal gas of magnons converts a fraction of heat into energy in the form of
work, where the efficiency is maximized for specific values of DM, reaching the
corresponding Carnot efficiency. We witness a positive to negative net work
transition during the cycle that marks the onset of a refrigerator-like
behavior. The work produced by the magnonic heat engine enhances the magnon
chemical potential. The last enables a spin accumulation that might result in
the pumping of spin currents at the interfaces of metal-magnet
heterostructures. Our work opens new possibilities for the efficient leverage
of conventional two-dimensional magnets.

<h3>Ligand Equilibrium Influences Photoluminescence Blinking in CsPbBr3: A  Change Point Analysis of Widefield Imaging Data</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08166" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08166</a>
<br>
</p><i>Shaun Gallagher, Jessica Kline, Farzaneh Jahanbakhshi, James C. Sadighian, Ian Lyons, Gillian Shen, Andrew M. Rappe, David S. Ginger</i>
<p>Photoluminescence intermittency remains one of the biggest challenges to
realizing perovskite quantum dots (QDs) as scalable single photon emitters. We
compare CsPbBr3 QDs capped with different ligands, lecithin, and a combination
of oleic acid and oleylamine, to elucidate the role of surface chemistry on
photoluminescence intermittency. We employ widefield photoluminescence
microscopy, sampling the blinking behavior of hundreds of QDs. Using change
point analysis, we achieve the robust classification of blinking trajectories,
and we analyze representative distributions from large numbers of QDs
(Nlecithin = 1308, Noleic acid/oleylamine =1317). We find that lecithin
suppresses blinking in CsPbBr3 QDs compared to oleic acid/oleylamine. Under
common experimental conditions, lecithin-capped QDs are 7.5 times more likely
to be non-blinking and spend 2.5 times longer in their most emissive state,
despite both QDs having nearly identical solution photoluminescence quantum
yields. We measure photoluminescence as a function of dilution and show that
the differences between lecithin and oleic acid/oleylamine capping emerge at
low concentrations during preparation for single particle experiments. From
experiment and first principles calculations, we attribute the differences in
lecithin and oleic acid/oleylamine performance to differences in their ligand
binding equilibria. Consistent with our experimental data, density functional
theory calculations suggest a stronger binding affinity of lecithin to the QD
surface compared to oleic acid/oleylamine, implying a reduced likelihood of
ligand desorption during dilution. These results suggest that using more
tightly binding ligands is a necessity for surface passivation and
consequently, blinking reduction in perovskite QDs used for single particle and
quantum light experiments.

<h3>Magnetic properties of low-angle twisted bilayer graphene at  three-quarters filling</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08177" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08177</a>
<br>
</p><i>Kevin J. U. Vidarte, Caio Lewenkopf</i>
<p>We present a theoretical investigation of the magnetic properties exhibited
by twisted bilayer graphene systems with small twist angles, where the
appearance of flat minibands strongly enhances electron-electron interaction
effects. We consider a tight-binding Hamiltonian combined with a Hubbard
mean-field interaction term and employ a real-space recursion technique to
self-consistently calculate the system's local density of states. The $O({\cal
N})$ efficiency of the recursion method makes it possible to address
superlattices of very large size by means of a full real-space analysis. Our
procedure is validated by comparison with literature momentum-space
calculations that find a magnetic phase in charge-neutral twisted bilayer
graphene. We use our method to investigate the properties of small-angle
twisted bilayer graphene at three-quarters filling of the conduction miniband.
Our calculations indicate the emergence of a ferromagnetic phase that can be
understood in terms of the Stoner mechanism, in line with recent experimental
observations.

<h3>Fractal spectrum in twisted bilayer optical lattice</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08211" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08211</a>
<br>
</p><i>Xu-Tao Wan, Chao Gao, Zhe-Yu Shi</i>
<p>The translation symmetry of a lattice is greatly modified when subjected to a
perpendicular magnetic field [Zak, Phys. Rev. \textbf{134}, A1602 (1964)]. This
change in symmetry can lead to magnetic unit cells that are substantially
larger than the original ones. Similarly, the translation properties of a
double-layered lattice alters drastically while two monolayers are relatively
twisted by a small angle, resulting in large-scale moir\'{e} unit cells.
Intrigued by the resemblance, we calculate the complete band structures of a
twisted bilayer optical lattice and show that the geometric moir\'{e} effect
can induce fractal band structures. The fractals are controlled by the twist
angle between two monolayers and are closely connected to the celebrated
butterfly spectrum of two-dimensional Bloch electrons in a magnetic field
[Hofstadter, Phys. Rev. B \textbf{14}, 2239 (1976)]. We demonstrate this by
proving that the twisted bilayer optical lattice can be mapped to a generalized
Hofstadter's model with long-range hopping. Furthermore, we provide numerical
evidence on the infinite recursive structures of the spectrum and give an
algorithm for computing these structures.

<h3>Stability and noncentered PT symmetry of real topological phases</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08215" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08215</a>
<br>
</p><i>S. J. Yue, Qing Liu, Shengyuan A. Yang, Y. X. Zhao</i>
<p>Real topological phases protected by the spacetime inversion (P T) symmetry
are a current research focus. The basis is that the P T symmetry endows a real
structure in momentum space, which leads to Z2 topological classifications in
1D and 2D. Here, we provide solutions to two outstanding problems in the
diagnosis of real topology. First, based on the stable equivalence in K-theory,
we clarify that the 2D topological invariant remains well defined in the
presence of nontrivial 1D invariant, and we develop a general numerical
approach for its evaluation, which was hitherto unavailable. Second, under the
unit-cell convention, noncentered P T symmetries assume momentum dependence,
which violates the presumption in previous methods for computing the
topological invariants. We clarify the classifications for this case and
formulate the invariants by introducing a twisted Wilson-loop operator for both
1D and 2D. A simple model on a rectangular lattice is constructed to
demonstrate our theory, which can be readily realized using artificial
crystals.

<h3>Thermally activated intermittent flow in amorphous solids</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08220" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08220</a>
<br>
</p><i>Daniel J. Korchinski, J√∂rg Rottler</i>
<p>Using mean field theory and a mesoscale elastoplastic model, we analyze the
steady state shear rheology of thermally activated amorphous solids. At
sufficiently high temperature and driving rates, flow is continuous and
described by well-established rheological flow laws such as Herschel-Bulkley
and logarithmic rate dependence. However, we find that these flow laws change
in the regime of intermittent flow, were collective events no longer overlap
and serrated flow becomes pronounced. In this regime, we identify a thermal
activation stress scale, $x_{a}(T,\dot{\gamma})$, that wholly captures the
effect of driving rate $\dot{\gamma}$ and temperature $T$ on average flow
stress, stress drop (avalanche) size and correlation lengths. Different
rheological regimes are summarized in a dynamic phase diagram for the amorphous
yielding transition. Theoretical predictions call for a need to re-examine the
rheology of very slowly sheared amorphous matter much below the glass
transition.

<h3>Quantum geometric tensor and the topological characterization of the  extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Xiang-Long Zeng, Wen-Xi Lai, Yi-Wen Wei, Yu-Quan Ma</i>
<p>We investigate the quantum metric and topological Euler number in a
cyclically modulated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with long-range hopping
terms. By computing the quantum geometry tensor, we derive exactly expressions
for the quantum metric and Berry curvature of the energy band electrons, and we
obtain the phase diagram of the model marked by the first Chern number.
Furthermore, we also obtain the topological Euler number of the energy band
based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem on the topological characterization of the
closed Bloch states manifold in the first Brillouin zone. However, some regions
where the Berry curvature is identically zero in the first Brillouin zone
results in the degeneracy of the quantum metric, which leads to ill-defined
non-integer topological Euler numbers. Nevertheless, the non-integer "Euler
number" provides valuable insights and provide an upper bound for absolute
values of the Chern numbers.

<h3>Large bubble drives melting in circular DNA</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Souradeep Sengupta, Somendra M. Bhattacharjee, Garima Mishra</i>
<p>We investigate the melting transition of non-supercoiled circular DNA of
different lengths, employing Brownian dynamics simulation. In the absence of
supercoiling, we find that melting of circular DNA is driven by a large bubble,
which agrees with the previous predictions of circular DNA melting in the
presence of supercoiling. By analyzing sector-wise changes in average base-pair
distance, our study reveals that the melting behavior of circular DNA closely
resembles that of linear DNA. Additionally, we find a marked difference in the
thermal stability of circular DNA over linear DNA at very short length scales,
an effect that diminishes as the length of circular DNA increases. The
stability of smaller circular DNA is linked to the occurrence of transient
small bubbles, characterized by a lower probability of growth.

<p>Transition metal dichalcogenides with superperiodic lattice distortions have
been widely investigated as the platform of ultrafast structural phase
manipulations. Here we performed ultrafast electron diffraction on
room-temperature TaTe$_2$, which exhibits peculiar double zigzag chain pattern
of Ta atoms. From the time-dependent electron diffraction pattern, we revealed
a photoinduced change in the crystal structure occurring within <0.5 ps, though
there is no corresponding high-temperature equilibrium phase. We further
clarified the slower response (~1.5 ps) reflecting the lattice thermalization.
Our result suggests the unusual ultrafast crystal structure dynamics specific
to the non-equilibrium transient process in TaTe$_2$.

<p>The hot carriers generated by plasmon damping hold significant potential for
photoelectric conversion and photocatalysis. Despite numerous experiments and
theoretical analyses, the precise role of plasmonic hot carriers in such
dynamical processes has not been well understood. Here we present a theory of
plasmonic photocatalysis based on the microscopic model of electron-vibrational
coupling and the vibrational heating mechanism. The nonthermal hot carrier
distribution was derived and treated on equal footing with the thermal
Fermi-Dirac distribution. The inelastic rates of vibrational excitations were
calculated including the effect of multiple electronic transitions. As an
example of application, the O$_2$ dissociation on silver nanoparticles was
explored with focus on the temperature- and light-intensity dependences. The
dissociation rate evolves from a linear regime into a superlinear regime due to
the onset of vibrational heating induced by hot carriers. In the nonlinear
regime, nonthermal hot carriers greatly promote molecular dissociation. Our
findings provide insight into plasmonic photocatalysis, and paves the way for
harnessing light energies in the nonthermal regime.

<h3>Electron-phonon interaction, magnetic phase transition, charge density  waves and resistive switching in VS2 and VSe2 revealed by Yanson point  contact spectroscopy</h3>

<p>VS2 and VSe2 have attracted particular attention among the transition metals
dichalcogenides because of their promising physical properties concerning
magnetic ordering, charge density wave (CDW), emergent superconductivity, etc.,
which are very sensitive to stoichiometry and dimensionality reduction. Yanson
point contact (PC) spectroscopic study reveals metallic and nonmetallic states
in VS2 PCs, as well as a magnetic phase transition was detected below 25 K.
Analysis of PC spectra of VS2 testifies the realization of the thermal regime
in PCs. At the same time, rare PC spectra, where the magnetic phase transition
was not visible, shows a broad maximum of around 20 mV, likely connected with
electron-phonon interaction (EPI). On the other hand, PC spectra of VSe2
demonstrate metallic behavior, which allowed us to detect features associated
with EPI and CDW transition. The Kondo effect appeared for both compounds,
apparently due to interlayer vanadium ions. Besides, the resistive switching
was observed in PCs on VSe2 between a low resistive, mainly metallic-type
state, and a high resistive nonmetallic-type state by applying bias voltage
(about 0.4V). In contrast, reverse switching occurs by applying a voltage of
opposite polarity (about 0.4V). The reason may be the alteration of
stoichiometry in the PC core due to the displacement of V ions to interlayer
under a high electric field. The observed resistive switching characterize VSe2
as a potential material, e.g., for non-volatile resistive RAM, neuromorphic
engineering, and for other nanoelectronic applications. At the same time, VSe2
attracts attention as a rare layered van der Waals compound with magnetic
transition.

<p>Low-dimensional quantum magnets are a versatile materials platform for
studying the emergent many-body physics and collective excitations that can
arise even in systems with only short-range interactions. Understanding their
low-temperature structure and spin Hamiltonian is key to explaining their
magnetic properties, including unconventional quantum phases, phase
transitions, and excited states. We study the metal-organic coordination
compound (C$_5$H$_9$NH$_3$)$_2$CuBr$_4$ and its deuterated counterpart, which
upon its discovery was identified as a candidate two-leg quantum ($S = 1/2$)
spin ladder in the strong-leg coupling regime. By growing large single crystals
and probing them with both bulk and microscopic techniques, we deduce that two
previously unknown structural phase transitions take place between 136 K and
113 K. The low-temperature structure has a monoclinic unit cell giving rise to
two inequivalent spin ladders. We further confirm the absence of long-range
magnetic order down to 30 mK and discuss the implications of this two-ladder
structure for the magnetic properties of (C$_5$H$_9$NH$_3$)$_2$CuBr$_4$.

</p><i>Abdolhalim Torrik, Mahdi Zarif</i>
<p>Active matter systems being in a non-equilibrium state, exhibit complex
behaviors such as self-organization and giving rise to emergent phenomena.
There are many examples of active particles with biological origins, including
bacteria and spermatozoa, or with artificial origins, such as self-propelled
swimmers and Janus particles. The ability to manipulate active particles is
vital for their effective application e.g. separating motile spermatozoa from
nonmotile and dead ones, to increase fertilization chance. In this study, we
proposed a mechanism -- an apparatus -- to sort and demix active particles
based on their motility values (P\`eclet number). Initially, using Brownian
simulations we demonstrated the feasibility of sorting self-propelled
particles. Following this, we employed machine learning methods, supplemented
with data from comprehensive simulations that we conducted for this study, to
model the complex behavior of active particles. This enabled us to sort them
based on their P\`eclet number. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the
developed models and showed their effectiveness in demixing and sorting the
active particles. Our findings can find applications in various fields,
including physics, biology, and biomedical science, where the sorting and
manipulation of active particles play a pivotal role.

<p>We study a one-dimensional hybrid system made of a $p$-wave altermagnet and a
metal possessing the orbital degree of freedom. The hybrid system is a
topological insulator without the spin-orbit interaction. There emerge two edge
states per one edge, because the system is mapped to a set of two copies of a
topological insulator. Each copy resembles the long-range Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
model but it is topologically different. Topological interface states emerge at
a domain wall of the $p$-wave altermagnet, which are charged due to the
Jackiw-Rebbi mechanism. Hence, the domain wall of the $p$-wave is controllable
and detectable by purely electrical means.

<p>Thermal transistors that switch the thermal conductivity (\k{appa}) of the
active layers are attracting increasing attention as thermal management
devices. For electrochemical thermal transistors, several transition metal
oxides (TMOs) have been proposed as active layers. After electrochemical redox
treatment, the crystal structure of the TMO is modulated, which results in the
\k{appa} switching. However, the \k{appa} switching width is still small (< 4
W/mK). In this study, we demonstrate that LaNiOx-based solid-state
electrochemical thermal transistors have a \k{appa} switching width of 4.3
W/mK. Fully oxidised LaNiO3 (on state) has a \k{appa} of 6.0 W/mK due to the
large contribution of electron thermal conductivity (\k{appa}ele, 3.1 W/mK). In
contrast, reduced LaNiO2.72 (off state) has a \k{appa} of 1.7 W/mK because the
phonons are scattered by the oxygen vacancies. The LaNiOx-based electrochemical
thermal transistor exhibits excellent cyclability of \k{appa} and the
crystalline lattice of LaNiOx. This electrochemical thermal transistor may be a
promising platform for next-generation devices such as thermal displays.

<h3>Evidence of ferroelectric features in low-density supercooled water from  ab initio deep neural-network simulations</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Cesare Malosso, Natalia Manko, Maria Grazia Izzo, Stefano Baroni, Ali Hassanali</i>
<p>Over the last decade, an increasing body of evidence has emerged, supporting
the existence of a metastable liquid-liquid critical point in supercooled
water, whereby two distinct liquid phases of different densities coexist.
Analysing long molecular dynamics simulations performed using deep
neural-network force fields trained to accurate quantum mechanical data, we
demonstrate that the low-density liquid phase displays a strong propensity
toward spontaneous polarization, as witnessed by large and long-lived
collective dipole fluctuations. Our findings suggest that the dynamical
stability of the low-density phase, and hence the transition from high-density
to low-density liquid, is triggered by a collective process involving an
accumulation of rotational angular jumps, which could ignite large dipole
fluctuations. This dynamical transition involves subtle changes in the
electronic polarizability of water molecules which affects their rotational
mobility within the two phases. These findings hold the potential for
catalyzing new activity in the search for dielectric-based probes of the
putative second critical point.

<p>We critically examine a broad class of explicitly polarisable soft solvent
models aimed at applications in dissipative particle dynamics. We obtain the
dielectric permittivity using the fluctuating box dipole method in linear
response theory, and verify the models in relation to several test cases
including demonstrating ion desorption from an oil-water interface due to image
charge effects. We additionally compute the Kirkwood factor and find it
uniformly lies in the range gK approx 0.7-0.8, indicating that dipole-dipole
correlations are not negligible in these models. This is supported by
measurements of dipole-dipole correlation functions. As a consequence, Onsager
theory over-predicts the dielectric permittivity by approximately 20-30
percent. On the other hand, the mean square molecular dipole moment can be
accurately estimated with a first-order Wertheim perturbation theory.

<p>Spontaneously symmetry-broken (SSB) phases are locally ordered states of
matter characterizing a large variety of physical systems. Because of their
specific ordering, their presence is usually witnessed by means of local order
parameters. Here, we propose an alternative approach based on statistical
correlations of noise after the ballistic expansion of an atomic cloud. We
indeed demonstrate that probing such noise correlators allows one to
discriminate among different SSB phases characterized by spin-charge
separation. As a particular example, we test our prediction on a 1D extended
Fermi-Hubbard model, where the competition between local and nonlocal couplings
gives rise to three different SSB phases: a charge density wave, a
bond-ordering wave, and an antiferromagnet. Our numerical analysis shows that
this approach can accurately capture the presence of these different SSB
phases, thus representing an alternative and powerful strategy to characterize
strongly interacting quantum matter.

<h3>R√©nyi entropy of the permutationally invariant part of the ground  state across a quantum phase transition</h3>

</p><i>Yuki Miyazaki, Giacomo Marmorini, Nobuo Furukawa, Daisuke Yamamoto</i>
<p>We investigate the role of the permutationally invariant part of the density
matrix (PIDM) in capturing the properties of the ground state of the system
during a quantum phase transition. In the context of quantum state tomography,
PIDM is known to be obtainable with only a low number of measurement settings,
namely $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$, where $L$ is the system size. Considering the
transverse-field Ising chain as an example, we compute the second-order R\'enyi
entropy of PIDM for the ground state by using the density matrix
renormalization group algorithm. In the ferromagnetic case, the ground state is
permutationally invariant both in the limits of zero and infinite field,
leading to vanishing R\'enyi entropy of PIDM. The latter exhibits a broad peak
as a function of the transverse field around the quantum critical point, which
gets more pronounced for larger system size. In the antiferromagnetic case, the
peak structure disappears and the R\'enyi entropy diverges like
$\mathcal{O}(L)$ in the whole field range of the ordered phase. We discuss the
cause of these behaviors of the R\'enyi entropy of PIDM, examining the possible
application of this experimentally tractable quantity to the analysis of phase
transition phenomena.

<p>Symmetry-breaking plays a pivotal role in unlocking intriguing properties and
functionalities in material systems. For example, the breaking of spatial and
temporal symmetries leads to a fascinating phenomenon of superconducting diode
effect. However, generating and precisely controlling the superconducting diode
effect poses significant challenges. Here, we take a novel route with
deliberate manipulation of magnetic charge potentials to realize unconventional
superconducting flux-quantum diode effects. We achieve this through suitably
tailored nanoengineered arrays of nanobar magnets on top of a superconducting
thin film. We demonstrate the vital roles of inversion antisymmetry and its
breaking in evoking unconventional superconducting effects-a magnetically
symmetric diode effect and an odd-parity magnetotransport effect. These effects
are non-volatilely controllable through in-situ magnetization switching of the
nanobar magnets. Our findings promote the use of antisymmetry (breaking) for
initiating unconventional superconducting properties, paving the way for
exciting prospects and innovative functionalities in superconducting
electronics.

<p>We present an in-depth multi-scale analysis of the conformations and dynamics
of polar active polymers, comparing very dilute and very dense conditions. We
unveil characteristic length and time scales, common to both dilute and dense
systems, that recapitulate the conformational and dynamical properties of these
active polymers upon varying both the polymer size and the strength of the
activity. Specifically, we find that a correlation (or looping) length
characterises the polymer conformations and the monomer dynamics. Instead, the
dynamics of the center of mass can be fully characterised by the end-to-end
mean-square distance and by the associated relaxation time. As such, we show
that the dynamics in melts of polar active polymers are not controlled by
entanglements but only by the strength of the self-propulsion.

<p>The selective-area epitaxy (SAE) is a useful technique to grow epitaxial
films with a desired shape on a pre-patterned substrate. Although SAE of
patterned topological-insulator (TI) thin films has been performed in the past,
there has been no report of SAE-grown TI structures that are bulk-insulating.
Here we report the successful growth of Hall-bars and nanowires of
bulk-insulating TIs using the SAE technique. Their transport properties show
that the quality of the selectively-grown structures is comparable to that of
bulk-insulating TI films grown on pristine substrates. In SAE-grown TI
nanowires, we were able to observe Aharonov-Bohm-like magnetoresistance
oscillations that are characteristic of the quantum-confined topological
surface states. The availability of bulk-insulating TI nanostructures via the
SAE technique opens the possibility to fabricate intricate topological devices
in a scalable manner.

<h3>Growth of two-inch free-standing heteroepitaxial diamond on Ir/YSZ/Si  (001) substrates via laser-patterned templates</h3>

</p><i>Pengfei Qu, Peng Jin, Guangdi Zhou, Zhen Wang, Zhanguo Wang</i>
<p>In this paper, 2-inch free-standing diamonds were prepared by using
heteroepitaxy on composite Ir/YSZ/Si (001) substrates. To release stress,
patterned templates were fabricated using laser etching after the initial
growth of 50-nm-diamond. Then, the subsequent growth was completed on a
patterned template. The full width at half maximum of the diamond (400) and
(311) X-ray rocking curves were 313.5 and 359.3 arcsecs, respectively. Strong
band-edge emission in the cathodoluminescence spectrum of the resulting diamond
revealed excellent crystalline quality. Furthermore, the 2D mapping of Raman
spectra was conducted on a $2 mm \times 2 mm$ area located at the center of the
2-inch sample with a thickness of $400 {\mu}m$. The result showed an average
peak width of $2.85 \pm 0.36 cm^{-1}$ and residual stress of $-0.03 \pm 0.37
GPa$. The dislocation density, determined by counting etching pits generated
from $ H_2/O_2$ plasma etching, was estimated to be around $2.2 \times 10^7
cm^{-2}$. These results evidence that the laser-patterned method can
effectively release stress during the growth of large-size diamonds, offering a
simpler and more cost-effective alternative to the traditional
photolithography-patterned scheme.

<p>The propagation path of quasistatic cracks under monotonic loading is known
to be strongly influenced by the anisotropy of the fracture energy in
crystalline solids or engineered materials with a regular microstructure. Such
cracks generally follow directions close to minima of the fracture energy. Here

under cyclic loading follow dramatically different paths that are predominantly
dictated by the symmetry of the loading with the microstructure playing a
negligible or subdominant role.

<br>
</p><i>Steven Kim, Fabian Hassler</i>
<p>A chaotic light source is characterized by the fact that many independent
emitters radiate photons with a random optical phase. This is similar compared
to a tunnel junction where many independent channels are able to emit photons
due to a coupling to an electromagnetic environment. However, in a recent
experiment it has been observed that a tunnel junction can deviate from the
expectation of chaotic light and is able to emit strongly correlated,
superbunched photons. Motivated by this, we study the correlation of the
radiation and show that the superbunching originates from the emission of
multiple photons which is possible due to the quantization of charge.

<h3>Inverted band gap trend through octahedral ordering in Cs$_2$Au$_2$X$_6$  (X=Cl, Br, I)</h3>

</p><i>Kazuki Morita, Andrew M. Rappe</i>
<p>Double perovskites Cs$_2$Au$_2$X$_6$ (X=Cl, Br, I) are prototypical materials
that exhibit charge disproportionation of gold into 1+ and 3+ states. It is
known that the disproportionation is resolved under high pressures, and this
has stimulated many studies into the pressurization of these materials. At
present, the phase changes in these materials are still strongly contested.
Here, we use density functional theory to study the pressure-dependent behavior
of Cs$_2$Au$_2$X$_6$. We find that a tetragonal--cubic transition occurs
directly from the ground state $I4/mmm$ structure. Even so, we also found an
intermediate tetragonal $P4/mmm$ structure to be very close in energy,
suggesting it to be observable. We also find several other competing metastable
phases, which explains some of the controversies in the literature. Focusing on
one of the metastable phases, we suggest that Cs$_2$Au$_2$X$_6$ can be prepared
in a $P4_2/mnm$ structure, analogous to that of KCuF$_3$. The band gap in the
$P4_2/mnm$ structure widened as atomic number of the halide was increased,
which is the inverse trend compared to the ground state structure. We explain
this by the different octahedral distortion ordering in the two structural
phases. Furthermore, we show that the conduction band in $P4_2/mnm$ is three
dimensionally connected, which is favorable for opto-electronic applications.
We submit that this work demonstrates that octahedral distortion ordering is a
promising avenue for developing new double perovskites and suggests it to be
particular effective in tuning the electronic structure properties.

<h3>Electron-phonon coupling induced topological phase transition in an  $Œ±$-$T_{3}$ Haldane-Holstein model</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Mijanur Islam, Kuntal Bhattacharyya, Saurabh Basu</i>
<p>We present impelling evidence of topological phase transitions induced by
electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling in an $\alpha$-$T_3$ Haldane-Holstein model
that presents smooth tunability between graphene ($\alpha=0$) and a dice
lattice $(\alpha=1)$. The e-ph coupling has been incorporated via the
Lang-Firsov transformation which adequately captures the polaron physics in the
high frequency (anti-adiabatic) regime, and yields an effective Hamiltonian of
the system through zero phonon averaging at $T=0$. While exploring the
signature of the phase transition driven by polaron and its interplay with the
parameter $\alpha$, we identify two regions based on the values of $\alpha$,
namely, the low to intermediate range $(0 < \alpha \le 0.6)$ and larger values
of $\alpha~(0.6 < \alpha < 1)$ where the topological transitions show distinct
behaviour. There exists a single critical e-ph coupling strength for the
former, below which the system behaves as a topological insulator characterized
by edge modes, finite Chern number, and Hall conductivity, with all of them
vanishing above this value, and the system undergoes a spectral gap closing
transition. Further, the critical coupling strength depends upon $\alpha$. For
the latter case $(0.6 < \alpha < 1)$, the scenario is more interesting where
there are two critical values of the e-ph coupling at which
trivial-topological-trivial and topological-topological-trivial phase
transitions occur for $\alpha$ in the range $[0.6:1]$. Our studies on e-ph
coupling induced phase transitions show a significant difference with regard to
the well-known unique transition occurring at $\alpha = 0.5$ (or at $0.7$) in
the absence of the e-ph coupling, and thus underscore the importance of
interaction effects on the topological phase transitions.

<p>We investigate the experimental control of pair tunneling in a double-well

with density-assisted tunneling to dominant pair tunneling by tuning the
effective interactions. Furthermore, we show that the pair tunneling rate can
be enhanced not only compared to the Floquet-reduced single-particle tunneling
but even beyond the static superexchange rate, while keeping the effective
interaction in a relevant range. This opens possibilities to realize models
with explicit pair tunneling in ultracold atomic systems.

<p>The crossover between short-range and long-range (LR) universal behaviors
remains a central theme in the physics of long-range interacting systems. The
competition between LR coupling and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
mechanism makes the problem more subtle and less understood in the
two-dimensional (2D) XY model, a cornerstone for investigating low-dimensional
phenomena and their implications in quantum computation. We study the 2D XY
model with algebraically decaying interaction $\sim1/r^{2+\sigma}$. Utilizing
an advanced update strategy, we conduct large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of
the model up to a linear size of $L=8192$. Our results demonstrate continuous
phase transitions into a ferromagnetic phase for $\sigma \leq 2$, which
exhibits the simultaneous emergence of a long-ranged order and a power-law
decaying correlation function due to the Goldstone mode. Furthermore, we find
logarithmic scaling behaviors in the low-temperature phase at $\sigma = 2$. The
observed scaling behaviors in the low-temperature phase for $\sigma \le 2$
agree with our theoretical analysis. Our findings request further theoretical
understandings and can be of practical application in cutting-edge experiments
like Rydberg atom arrays.

<p>The exploration of van der Waals (vdWs) magnetic materials has sparked great
interest in spintronics. However, conventional methods often face challenges in
characterizing the magnetic properties of small-sized vdWs materials,
especially for antiferromagnets with extremely small magnetic moments. Here, we
demonstrate the efficacy of dynamic cantilever magnetometry (DCM) in
characterizing the magnetic properties of vdWs magnets, using an
antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrPS4. We observe continuous spin axis rotation
under a magnetic field, accurately modelled by considering the existance of
marked magnetic anisotropies. Furthermore, the dominance of out-of-plane
magnetic anisotropy in spin reorientation behavior at low temperatures
transitions to the prevalence of in-plane anisotropy with increasing
temperature, leading to a sign reversal of the frequency shift in measurements.
The peculiar magnetic phase transitions make CrPS4 an intriguing platform for
studying two-dimensional magnetism. Our findings underscore the effectiveness
of DCM in characterizing magnetic anisotropies and phase transitions in vdWs
magnets.

<p>Coupling between flow and orientation is a central issue in understanding the

quenched random field on the flow patterns and orientational order in
two-dimensional active nematic liquid crystals. We found that the director
dynamics is frozen above a critical disorder strength. For sufficiently strong
randomness, the orientational correlation function decays exponentially with
the distance, reproducing the behavior of passive random-field nematics. In
contrast, the flow velocity decreases only gradually as the randomness is
increased, and develops a logarithmic spatial correlation for strong disorder.
The threshold between the activity- and disorder-dominated regimes is specified
and its dependence on the activity parameter is discussed.

<h3>Spin-resolved nonlocal transport in proximitized Rashba nanowires</h3>

<p>Non-equilibrium transport in hybrid semiconductor-superconductor nanowires is
crucial for many quantum phenomena such as generating entangled states via
cross Andreev reflection (CAR) processes, detecting topological
superconductivity, reading out Andreev spin qubits, coupling spin qubits over
long distances and so on. Here, we investigate numerically transport properties
of a proximitized Rashba nanowire that hosts spin-polarized low-energy
quasiparticle states. We show that the spin polarization in such
one-dimensional Andreev bands, extended over the entire nanowire length, can be
detected in nonlocal transport measurements with tunnel-coupled side leads that
are spin polarized. Remarkably, we find an exact correspondence between the
sign of the nonlocal conductance and the spin density of the superconducting
quasiparticles at the side lead position. We demonstrate that this feature is
robust to moderate static disorder. As an example, we show that such a method
can be used to detect spin inversion of the bands, accompanying the topological
phase transition (TPT) for realistic system parameters. Furthermore, we show
that such effects can be used to switch between CAR and elastic cotunneling
(ECT) processes by tuning the strength of either the electric or the magnetic
field. These findings hold significant practical implications for
state-of-the-art transport experiments in such hybrid systems.

<h3>Scaling regimes of the one-dimensional phase turbulence in the  deterministic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation</h3>

</p><i>Francesco Vercesi, Susie Poirier, Anna Minguzzi, L√©onie Canet</i>
<p>We study the phase turbulence of the one-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau
equation, in which the defect-free chaotic dynamics of the order parameter maps
to a phase equation well approximated by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky model. In
this regime, the behaviour of the large wavelength modes is captured by the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, determining universal scaling and statistical
properties. We present numerical evidence of the existence of an additional
scale-invariant regime, with dynamical scaling exponent $z=1$, emerging at
scales which are intermediate between the microscopic, intrinsic to the
modulational instability, and the macroscopic ones. We argue that this new
regime is a signature of the universality class corresponding to the inviscid
limit of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.

<h3>Large scale simulations of photosynthetic antenna systems: interplay of  cooperativity and disorder</h3>

<p>Large scale simulations of light-matter interaction in natural photosynthetic
antenna complexes containing more than one hundred thousands chlorophyll
molecules, comparable with natural size, have been performed. Photosynthetic
antenna complexes present in Green sulfur bacteria and Purple bacteria have
been analyzed using a radiative non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, well known in the
field of quantum optics, instead of the widely used dipole-dipole Frenkel
Hamiltonian. This approach allows to study ensembles of emitters beyond the
small volume limit (system size much smaller than the absorbed wavelength),
where the Frenkel Hamiltonian fails. When analyzed on a large scale, such
structures display superradiant states much brighter then their single
components. An analysis of the robustness to static disorder and dynamical
(thermal) noise, shows that exciton coherence in the whole photosynthetic
complex is larger than the coherence found in its parts. This provides evidence
that the photosynthetic complex as a whole has a predominant role in sustaining
coherences in the system even at room temperature. Our results allow a better
understanding of natural photosynthetic antennae and could drive experiments to
verify how the response to the electromagnetic radiation depends on the size of
the photosynthetic antenna.

<h3>Quantum entropy couples matter with geometry</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08556" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08556</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ginestra Bianconi</i>
<p>We propose a theory for coupling matter fields with discrete geometry on
higher-order networks, i.e. cell complexes. The key idea of the approach is to
associate to a higher-order network the quantum entropy of its metric.
Specifically we propose an action given by the quantum relative entropy between
the metric of the higher-order network and the metric induced by the matter and
gauge fields. The induced metric is defined in terms of the topological spinors
and the discrete Dirac operators. The topological spinors, defined on nodes,
edges and higher-dimensional cells, encode for the matter fields. The discrete
Dirac operators act on topological spinors, and depend on the metric of the
higher-order network as well as on the gauge fields via a discrete version of
the minimal substitution. We derive the coupled dynamical equations for the
metric, the matter and the gauge fields, providing an information theory
principle to obtain the field theory equations in discrete curved space.

<h3>On the average spin Chern number</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08595" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08595</a>
<br>
</p><i>Rafael Gonzalez-Hernandez, Bernardo Uribe</i>
<p>In this letter, we propose the average spin Chern number (ASCN) as an
indicator of the topological significance of the spin degree of freedom within
insulating materials. Whenever this number is a non-zero even integer, it
distinguishes the material as a spin Chern insulator and the number is a
topological invariant. If this number is not zero, it indicates that the
material has non-trivial spin transport properties, and it lies close to the
value of the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) within the bandgap. For materials
where spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is small, the ASCN matches the SHC. When the
SOC cannot be neglected, both values are non-zero simultaneously. The ASCN is
therefore a good complement for the intrinsic contribution of the SHC, and
permits to detect topological information of the material which is not possible
alone from the value of the SHC.
