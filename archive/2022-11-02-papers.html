<h3>Accelerated Design of Chalcogenide Glasses through Interpretable Machine  Learning for Composition Property Relationships</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00691" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00691</a>

Chalcogenide glasses possess several outstanding properties that enable
several ground breaking applications, such as optical discs, infrared cameras,
and thermal imaging systems. Despite the ubiquitous usage of these glasses, the
composition property relationships in these materials remain poorly understood.
Here, we use a large experimental dataset comprising approx 24000 glass
compositions made of 51 distinct elements from the periodic table to develop
machine learning models for predicting 12 properties, namely, annealing point,
bulk modulus, density, Vickers hardness, Littleton point, Youngs modulus, shear
modulus, softening point, thermal expansion coefficient, glass transition
temperature, liquidus temperature, and refractive index. These models, by far,
are the largest for chalcogenide glasses. Further, we use SHAP, a game theory
based algorithm, to interpret the output of machine learning algorithms by
analyzing the contributions of each element towards the models prediction of a
property. This provides a powerful tool for experimentalists to interpret the
models prediction and hence design new glass compositions with targeted
properties. Finally, using the models, we develop several glass selection
charts that can potentially aid in the rational design of novel chalcogenide
glasses for various applications.

The theory of ion transport in cylindrical channels of a fixed surface charge
density is revisited. Attention is focused on impact of the hydrophobic
slippage and mobility of adsorbed surface charges. We formulate generalised
Onsager relations for a cylinder of an arbitrary radius and then derive exact
expressions for the mean electro-osmotic mobility and conductivity. To employ
these expressions we perform additional electrostatic calculations, with the
special focus on the non-linear electrostatic effects. Our theory provides a
simple explanation of a giant enhancement of the electrokinetic mobility and
conductivity of hydrophobic nanotubes by highlighting the role of appropriate
electrostatic and hydrodynamic length scales and their ratios. We also propose
a novel interpretation of zeta potentials of cylindrical channels.

In this article we discuss the accuracy of effective one-dimensional theories
used to describe the behavior of ultracold atomic ensembles confined in quantum
wires by a harmonic trap. We derive within a fully many-body approach the
effective Hamiltonian describing this class of systems and we calculate the
beyond-mean field corrections to the energy of the ground state arising from
virtual transitions towards excited state of the confining potential. We find
that, due to the Pauli principle, effective finite-range corrections are one of
magnitude larger than effective three-body interactions.By comparing to exact
solutions of the purely 1D problem, we conclude that a 1D effective theory
provides a good description of the ground state of the system for a rather
large range of interaction parameters.

<h3>Correlating microscopic viscoelasticity and structure of an aging  colloidal gel using active microrheology and cryogenic scanning electron  microscopy</h3>

Optical tweezers (OTs) can detect pico-Newton range forces operating on a
colloidal particle trapped in a medium and have been successfully utilized to
investigate complex systems with internal structures. Laponite clay particles
in an aqueous medium self-assemble to form microscopic networks over time as
electrostatic interactions between the particles gradually evolve in a physical
aging process. We investigate the forced movements of an optically trapped
micron-sized colloidal probe particle, suspended in an aging Laponite
suspension, as the underlying Laponite microstructures gradually develop. Our
OT-based oscillatory active microrheology experiments allow us to investigate
the mechanical responses of the evolving microstructures in aging aqueous clay
suspensions of concentrations ranging from 2.5% w/v to 3.0% w/v and at several
aging times between 90 and 150 minutes. We repeat such oscillatory measurements
for a range of colloidal probe particle diameters and investigate the effect of
probe size on the microrheology of the aging suspensions. Using cryogenic field
emission scanning electron microscopy (cryo-FESEM), we examine the average pore
areas of the Laponite suspension microstructures for various sample
concentrations and aging times. By combining our OT and cryo-FESEM data, we
report here for the first time to the best of our knowledge, an inverse
correlation between the crossover modulus and the average pore diameter of the
aging suspension microstructures for the different suspension concentrations
and probe particle sizes studied here.

<h3>Collective Motion in Active Materials: Model Experiments</h3>

In these lecture notes from the Les Houches School, we discuss collective

<h3>Self-attractive semiflexible polymers under an external force field</h3>

<i>A. Lamura</i>
<br>
<br>
The dynamical response of a tethered semiflexible polymer with
self-attractive interactions and subjected to an external force field is
numerically investigated by varying stiffness and self-interaction strength.
The chain is confined in two spatial dimensions and placed in contact with a
heat bath described by the Brownian multiparticle collision method. For strong
self-attraction the equilibrium conformations range from compact structures to
double-stranded chains, and to rods when increasing the stiffness. Under the
external field at small rigidities, the initial close-packed chain is
continuously unwound by the force before being completely elongated. For
double-stranded conformations the transition from the folded state to the open
one is sharp being steeper for larger stiffnesses. The discontinuity in the
transition appears in the force-extension relation as well as in the
probability distribution function of the gyration radius. The relative
deformation with respect to the equilibrium case along the direction normal to
the force is found to decay as the inverse of the applied force.

<h3>Microscopic theory for the pair correlation function of liquidlike  colloidal suspensions under shear flow</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01284" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01284</a>

<i>Luca Banetta, Francesco Leone, Carmine Anzivino, Michael S. Murillo, Alessio Zaccone</i>

We present a theoretical framework to investigate the microscopic structure
of concentrated hard-sphere colloidal suspensions under strong shear flows by
fully taking into account the boundary-layer structure of convective diffusion.
We solve the pair Smoluchowski equation with shear separately in the
compressing and extensional sectors of the solid angle, by means of matched
asymptotics. A proper, albeit approximate, treatment of the hydrodynamic
interactions in the different sectors allows us to construct a potential of
mean force containing the effect of the flow field on pair correlations. We
insert the obtained pair potential in the Percus-Yevick relation and use the
latter as a closure to solve the Ornstein-Zernike integral equation. For a wide
range of either the packing fraction $\eta$ and the P\'eclet ($\textrm{Pe}$)
number, we compute the pair correlation function and extract scaling laws for
its value at contact. For all the considered value of $\textrm{Pe},$ we observe
a very good agreement between theoretical findings and numerical results from
literature, up to rather large values of $\eta.$ The theory predicts a
consistent enhancement of the structure factor $ S(k)$ at $k \to 0,$ upon
increasing the $\textrm{Pe}$ number. We argue this behaviour may signal the
onset of a phase transition from the isotropic phase to a non-uniform one,
induced by the external shear flow.

<h3>Current Noise of Hydrodynamic Electrons</h3>

A resistor at finite temperature produces white noise fluctuations of the
current called Johnson-Nyquist noise. Measuring the amplitude of this noise
provides a powerful primary thermometry technique to access the electron
temperature at the nanoscale. In practical situations, one needs to generalize
the Johnson-Nyquist theorem to handle spatially inhomogeneous temperature
profiles. Recent work provided such a generalization for ohmic devices obeying
the Wiedemann-Franz law and showed that Joule heating leads to a
geometry-independent increase in Johnson noise. There is a need to provide a
similar generalization for hydrodynamic electron systems, which do not admit a
local conductivity nor obey the Wiedemann-Franz law, since hydrodynamic
electrons provide unusual sensitivity for Johnson noise thermometry. Here we
address this need by considering low-frequency Johnson noise in the
hydrodynamic setting for a rectangular geometry. Unlike in the ohmic setting,
we find that the Johnson noise is no longer geometry-independent due to
non-local viscous gradients. Nonetheless, ignoring the geometric correction
only leads to an error of at most 40% as compared to naively using the ohmic
result.

<h3>Trimer quantum spin liquid in a honeycomb array of Rydberg atoms</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00653" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00653</a>

<br>
<br>
Quantum spin liquids are elusive but paradigmatic examples of strongly
correlated quantum states that are characterized by long-range quantum
entanglement. Recently, the direct signatures of a gapped topological
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid have been observed in a system of Rydberg atoms
arrayed on the ruby lattice. Here, we illustrate the concrete realization of a
fundamentally different class of spin liquids in a honeycomb array of Rydberg
atoms. Exploring the quantum phase diagram of this system using both
density-matrix renormalization group and exact diagonalization simulations,
several density-wave-ordered phases are characterized and their origins
explained. More interestingly, in the regime where third-nearest-neighbor atoms
lie within the Rydberg blockade radius, we find a novel ground state -- with an
emergent $\mathrm{U}(1)\times \mathrm{U}(1)$ local symmetry -- formed from
superpositions of classical {\it trimer} configurations on the dual triangular
lattice. The fidelity of this trimer spin liquid state can be enhanced via
dynamical preparation, which we explain by a Rydberg-blockade-based projection
mechanism associated with the smooth turnoff of the laser drive. Finally, we
discuss the robustness of the trimer spin liquid phase under realistic
experimental parameters and demonstrate that our proposal can be readily
implemented in current Rydberg atom quantum simulators.

<h3>Untwisting moiré physics: Almost ideal bands and fractional Chern  insulators in periodically strained monolayer graphene</h3>

Moir\'e systems have emerged in recent years as a rich platform to study
strong correlations. Here, we will discuss a simple, experimentally feasible
setup based on periodically strained graphene that reproduces several key
aspects of twisted moir\'e heterostructures -- but without introducing a twist.
We consider a monolayer graphene sheet subject to a $C_2$-breaking periodic
strain-induced psuedomagnetic field (PMF) with period $L_M \gg a$, along with a
scalar potential of the same period. This system has {\it almost ideal} flat
bands with valley-resolved Chern number $\pm 1$, where the deviation from ideal
band geometry is analytically controlled and exponentially small in the
dimensionless ratio $(L_M/l_B)^2$ where $l_B$ is the magnetic length
corresponding to the maximum value of the PMF. Moreover, the scalar potential
can tune the bandwidth far below the Coulomb scale, making this a very
promising platform for strongly interacting topological phases. Using a
combination of strong-coupling theory and self-consistent Hartree fock, we find
quantum anomalous Hall states at integer fillings. At fractional filling, exact
diagonaliztion reveals a fractional Chern insulator at parameters in the
experimentally feasible range. Overall, we find that this system has larger
interaction-induced gaps, smaller quasiparticle dispersion, and enhanced
tunability compared to twisted graphene systems, even in their ideal limit.

<h3>Asymptotic sign free in interacting fermion models</h3>

As an intrinsically-unbiased approach, quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is of vital
importance in understanding correlated phases of matter. Unfortunately, it
often suffers notorious sign problem when simulating interacting fermion
models. Here, we show for the first time that there exist interacting fermion
models whose sign problem becomes less severe for larger system sizes and
eventually disappears in the thermodynamic limit, which we dub as "asymptotic
sign free". We demonstrate asymptotically-free sign in determinant QMC for
various interacting models. Moreover, based on renormalization-group-like ideas
we propose a heuristic understanding of the feature of asymptotic sign free. We
believe that asymptotic sign free behavior could shed new lights to deepening
our understanding of sign problem. More importantly, it can provide a promising
way to decipher intriguing physics in correlated models which were
conventionally thought not accessible by QMC.

<h3>A Criterion for Strange Metallicity in the Lorenz Ratio</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00665" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00665</a>
<br>
<i>Evyatar Tulipman, Erez Berg</i>
<br>
<br>
The Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law, stating that the Lorenz ratio $L =
\kappa/(T\sigma)$ between the thermal and electrical conductivities in a metal
approaches a universal constant $L_0=\pi^2 k_B^2/ (3 e^2)$ at low temperatures,
is often interpreted as a signature of fermionic Landau quasi-particles. In
contrast, we show that various models of weakly disordered non-Fermi liquids
also obey the WF law at $T \to 0$. Instead, we propose using the leading
low-temperature correction to the WF law, $L(T)-L_0$ (proportional to the
inelastic scattering rate), to distinguish different types of strange metals.
As an example, we demonstrate that in a solvable model of a marginal Fermi
liquid, $L(T)-L_0\propto -T$. Using the quantum Boltzmann equation approach, we
find analogous behavior in a class of marginal- and non-Fermi liquids with a
weakly momentum-dependent inelastic scattering. In contrast, in a Fermi liquid,
$L(T)-L_0$ is proportional to $-T^2$. This holds even when the resistivity
grows linearly with $T$, due to $T-$linear quasi-elastic scattering (as in the
case of electron-phonon scattering at temperatures above the Debye frequency).

Ultrafast photo-induced phase transitions occurring under the impact of
femtosecond laser pulses provide versatile opportunities to switch solids
between distinctly-different crystalline, electronic, and spin states and thus
modify their functional properties in a significant manner. In this paper, we
report on the laser-induced spin reorientation and Verwey phase transitions in
a ferrimagnetic single crystalline magnetite Fe$_3$O$_4$. Using femtosecond
optical and magneto-optical pump-probe techniques, we define the range of
initial sample temperatures and laser fluences when partial or complete
photo-induced phase transitions occur from a monoclinic insulating to a cubic
metallic state with concomitant switching of magnetic anisotropy from the
uniaxial to the cubic one. We thus reveal a connection between these phase
transitions when driven by femtosecond laser pulses. Using transient linear and
quadratic magneto-optical effects, we examine magnetization dynamics launched
by the magnetic anisotropy axis switching, and unveil the presence of the
domains undergoing the laser-induced phase transitions even below the
established thershold fluence for the transitions, as well as when the material
is initially in the cubic phase. This is the manifestation of the 1st order of
these laser-induced phase transitions beyond the range of thermodynamic
equilibrium.

<h3>Stochastic thermodynamic bounds on logical circuit operation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00670" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00670</a>
<br>
<i>Phillip Helms, David T. Limmer</i>
<br>
<br>
Using a thermodynamically consistent, mesoscopic model for modern
complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor transistors, we study an array of
logical circuits and explore how their function is constrained by recent
thermodynamic uncertainty relations when operating near thermal energies. For a
single NOT gate, we find operating direction-dependent dynamics, and an optimal
trade-off between dissipated heat and operation time certainty. For a memory
storage device, we find an exponential relationship between the memory
retention time and energy required to sustain that memory state. For a clock,
we find that the certainty in the cycle time is maximized at biasing voltages
near thermal energy, as is the trade-off between this certainty and the heat
dissipated per cycle. We demonstrate that a simple control mechanism for the
clock leads to a monotonic increase in cycle time certainty with biasing
voltage alleviating its degradation at large biasing voltages. These results
provide a framework for assessing thermodynamic costs of realistic computing
devices, allowing for circuits to be designed and controlled for
thermodynamically optimal operation.

<h3>Higher-Order Nodal Hinge States in Doped Superconducting Topological  Insulator</h3>

<br>
<i>Sayed Ali Akbar Ghorashi, Jennifer Cano, Enrico Rossi, Taylor L. Hughes</i>
<br>
<br>
Doped strong topological insulators are one of the most promising candidates
to realize a fully gapped three-dimensional topological superconductor (TSC).
In this letter, we revisit this system and reveal a possibility for
higher-order topology which was previously missed. We find that over a
finite-range of doping, the Fu-Berg superconducting pairing can give rise to
both Majorana surface states, and nodal hinge states. Interestingly, we observe
the coexistence of surface and hinge modes in the superconducting state only
when there are both bulk and surface Fermi-surfaces in the normal state. Also,
we find that the hinge modes can appear for normal states consisting of doped
strong or weak topological insulators. In summary, this work may allow for the
discovery of superconducting hinge modes in a well explored class of materials,
i.e., doped strong or weak topological insulators.

The XYZ model is an integrable spin chain which has an infinite set of
conserved charges, but it lacks a global $U(1)$-symmetry. We consider the
current operators, which describe the flow of the conserved quantities in this
model. We derive an exact result for the current mean values, valid for any
eigenstate in a finite volume with periodic boundary conditions. This result
can serve as a basis for studying the transport properties of this model within
Generalized Hydrodynamics.

<br>
<br>
We report optical pumping and X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments at
the PAL free electron laser that directly probe the electron dynamics of a
graphene monolayer adsorbed on copper in the femtosecond regime. By analyzing
the results with ab-initio theory we infer that the excitation of graphene is
dominated by indirect excitation from hot electron-hole pairs created in the
copper by the optical laser pulse. However, once the excitation is created in
graphene, its decay follows a similar path as in many previous studies of
graphene adsorbed on semiconductors, i e. rapid excitation of SCOPS (Strongly
Coupled Optical Phonons) and eventual thermalization. It is likely that the
lifetime of the hot electron-hole pairs in copper governs the lifetime of the
electronic excitation of the graphene.

Photo-induced phase-transitions (PIPTs) driven by highly cooperative
interactions are of fundamental interest as they offer a way to tune and
control material properties on ultrafast timescales. Due to strong correlations
and interactions, complex quantum materials host several fascinating PIPTs such
as light-induced charge density waves and ferroelectricity and have become a
desirable setting for studying these PIPTs. A central issue in this field is
the proper understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving the PIPTs. As
these PIPTs are highly nonlinear processes and often involve multiple time and
length scales, different theoretical approaches are often needed to understand
the underlying mechanisms. In this review, we present a brief overview of PIPTs
realized in complex materials, followed by a discussion of the available
theoretical methods with selected examples of recent progress in understanding
of the nonequilibrium pathways of PIPTs.

<br>
Spin qubits in germanium are a promising contender for scalable quantum
computers. Reading out of the spin and charge configuration of quantum dots
formed in Ge/Si core/shell nanowires is typically performed by measuring the
current through the nanowire. Here, we demonstrate a more versatile approach on
investigating the charge configuration of these quantum dots. We employ a
high-impedance, magnetic-field resilient superconducting resonator based on
NbTiN and couple it to a double quantum dot in a Ge/Si nanowire. This allows us
to dispersively detect charging effects, even in the regime where the nanowire
is fully pinched off and no direct current is present. Furthermore, by
increasing the electro-chemical potential far beyond the nanowire pinch-off, we
observe indications for depleting the last hole in the quantum dot by using the
second quantum dot as a charge sensor.

<h3>Persistent-current states originating from the Hilbert space  fragmentation in momentum space</h3>

Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) is a phenomenon that the Hilbert space of
an isolated quantum system splits into exponentially many disconnected
subsectors. The fragmented systems do not thermalize after long-time evolution
because the dynamics are restricted to a small subsector. Inspired by recent
developments of the HSF, we construct the Hamiltonian that exhibits the HSF in
the momentum space. We show that persistent-current (PC) states emerge due to
the HSF in the momentum space. We also investigate the stability of the PC
states against the random potential, which breaks the structure of the HSF, and
find that the decay rate of the PC is almost independent of the current
velocity.

The extra CO2 that has already been released into the atmosphere has to be
removed in order to create a world that is carbon neutral. Technologies have
been created to remove carbon dioxide from wet flue gas or even directly from
ambient air, however these technologies are not widely deployed yet. New
generations of creative CO2 capture sorbents have been produced as a
consequence of recent improvements in material assembly and surface chemistry.
We summarize recent progress on water-stable and encapsulated metal-organic
frameworks (MOFs) for CO2 capture under a wide range of environmental and
operating conditions. In particular, newly developed water-stable MOFs and
hydrophobic coating technologies are discussed with insights into their
materials discovery and the synergistic effects between different components of
these hybrid sorbent systems. The future perspectives and directions of
water-stable and encapsulated MOFs are also given for Direct Air Capture of CO2
and CO2 capture from wet flue gas.

<h3>Pressure-induced dimerization and molecular orbitals formation in  Na2RuO3 with strong correlation-enhanced spin-orbit coupling effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00811" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00811</a>

<br>
<br>
First-principles calculations and simulations are conducted to clarify the
nonmagnetic insulating ground state of the honeycomb lattice compound Na2RuO3
with 4d^4 electronic configuration and explore the evolutions of crystal
structure and electronic property under pressure. We reveal that individual
Coulomb correlation or spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect cannot reproduce the
experimentally observed nonmagnetic insulating behavior of Na2RuO3, whereas the
Coulomb correlation enhanced SOC interactions give rise to an unusual
spin-orbital-entangled J = 0 nonmagnetic insulating state, which contrasts with
the SOC assisted Mott insulating state in d^5 ruthenates and iridates.
Furthermore, a pressure-induced structural dimerization transition has been
predicted around 15-17.5 GPa. The honeycomb lattice of the high-pressure
dimerized phase features with parallel pattern of the short Ru-Ru dimers
aligning along the crystallographic b direction. Accompanied with the
structural dimerization, the electronic structure shows striking reconstruction
by formation of molecular orbitals. Interestingly, the cooperation of Coulomb
correlation together with SOC can realize a nonmagnetic insulating state in the
high-pressure dimerized phase. The d^4 ruthenate Na2RuO3 with honeycomb lattice
will provide a new platform to explore unusual physics and rich phase diagram
due to the delicate interplay of lattice degree of freedom, electron
correlations, and SOC interactions.

Concepts of complex partition functions and the Fisher zeros provide
intrinsic statistical mechanisms for finite temperature and real time dynamical
phase transitions. We extend the utility of these complexifications to quantum
phase transitions. We exactly identify different Fisher zeros on lines or
closed curves and elucidate their correspondence with domain-wall excitation or
confined meson for the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. The
crossover behavior of Fisher zeros provides a fascinating picture for
criticality near the quantum phase transition, where the excitation energy
scales are quantitatively determined. We further confirm our results by tensor
network calculation and demonstrate a clear signal of deconfined meson
excitation from the breaking of the closed zero curves. Our results
unambiguously show significant features of the Fisher zeros for a quantum phase
transition and open up a new route to explore quantum criticality.

Sintering, as a thermal process at elevated temperature below the melting
point, is widely used to bond contacting particles into engineering products
such as ceramics, metals, polymers, and cemented carbides. Modelling and
simulation as important complement to experiments are essential for
understanding the sintering mechanisms and for the optimization and design of
sintering process. We share in this article a state-to-the-art review on the
major methods and models for the simulation of sintering process at various
length scales. It starts with molecular dynamics simulations deciphering
atomistic diffusion process, and then moves to microstructure-level approaches
such as discrete element method, Monte--Carlo method, and phase-field models,
which can reveal subtle mechanisms like grain coalescence, grain rotation,
densification, grain coarsening, etc. Phenomenological/empirical models on the
macroscopic scales for estimating densification, porosity and average grain
size are also summarized. The features, merits, drawbacks, and applicability of
these models and simulation technologies are expounded. In particular, the
latest progress on the modelling and simulation of selective and direct-metal
laser sintering based additive manufacturing is also reviewed. Finally, a
summary and concluding remarks on the challenges and opportunities are given
for the modelling and simulations of sintering process.

Combinatorial optimization problems can be mapped onto Ising models, and
their ground state is generally difficult to find. A lot of heuristics for
these problems have been proposed, and one promising approach is to use
continuous variables. In recent years, one such algorithm has been implemented
by using parametric oscillators known as coherent Ising machines. Although
these algorithms have been confirmed to have high performance through many
experiments, unlike other familiar algorithms such as simulated annealing,
their computational ability has not been fully investigated. In this paper, we
propose a simple heuristic based on continuous variables whose static and
dynamical properties are easy to investigate. Through the analyses of the
proposed algorithm, we find that many local minima in the early stage of the
optimization and bifurcation delay reduce its performance in a certain class of
Ising models.

We present the development of a high-precision sample-position-autocorrection
system for photoemission experiments. A binocular vision method based on image
pattern matching calculations was realized to track the sample position with an
accuracy better than 1 \um, which was much smaller than the spot size of the
incident laser. We illustrate the performance of the
sample-position-autocorrection system with representative photoemission data on
the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and an optimally-doped cuprate

The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) layered MoSi$_2$N$_4$ and WSi$_2$N$_4$
without knowing their 3D parents by chemical vapor deposition in 2020 has
stimulated extensive studies of 2D MA$_2$Z$_4$ system due to its structural
complexity and diversity as well as versatile and intriguing properties. Here,
a comprehensive overview on the state-of-the-art progress of this 2D
MA$_2$Z$_4$ family is presented. Starting by describing the unique sandwich
structural characteristics of the emerging monolayer MA$_2$Z$_4$, we summarize
and anatomize their versatile properties including mechanics, piezoelectricity,
thermal transport, electronics, optics/optoelectronics, and magnetism. The
property tunability via strain engineering, surface functionalization and
layered strategy is also elaborated. Theoretical and experimental attempts or
advances in applying 2D MA$_2$Z$_4$ to transistors, photocatalysts, batteries
and gas sensors are then reviewed to show its prospective applications over a
vast territory. We further discuss new opportunities and suggest prospects for
this emerging 2D family. The overview is anticipated to guide the further
understanding and exploration on 2D MA$_2$Z$_4$.

We report transport properties for layered BiCh2-based (Ch = S, Se)
superconductors LaO1-xFxBiS2-ySey (x = 0.2, 0.5, y = 0-1.05) and the
observation of weak antilocalization (WAL). Electrical resistivity and Hall
coefficients for the Se-poor samples increase with decreasing temperature. The
increase becomes less pronounced with increasing Se concentration indicating a
loss of insulating behavior. Interestingly, the moderately Se-substituted
samples exhibit metallic behavior in the high-temperature region and a weak
increase in the resistivity in the low-temperature regions, which indicates the
existence of carrier localization. The heavily Se-substituted compounds show
metallic behavior in the entire-temperature region. Sign changes of the Hall
coefficients are observed for the x = 0.2 samples, which possibly is related to
a charge-density wave (CDW). Magnetoresistance measurements indicate that WAL
is realized in the heavily Se-substituted systems. The WAL behavior is weakened
by the changes in F and Se concentrations. A crossover state of the WAL and WL
emerges around the moderately F-doped and Se-free LaO0.8F0.2BiS2. The change of
the resistivity behavior by the F and Se substitution clearly correlates to the
difference of the magnetoconductance. Moreover, the localization regions of the
WAL-WL crossover and weak WAL states are possibly associated with the CDW. We
propose that the BiCh2-based system is a good platform for studying
relationship between WAL, superconductivity, and electronic ordering because
those states are tunable by element substitutions with bulk single crystals.

MXenes are rapidly emerging two-dimensional (2D) materials with thickness,
composition, and functionalization-dependent outstanding properties having
applications in diverse fields. To disclose nano-spintronic applications of
2D-double transition metal (DTM) carbide and nitride-based pristine and
surface-functionalized MXenes (M'2M"X2Tx, M' and M" = Cr, Mo, W; X = C/N; T =
-F/-OH/=O), a systematic investigation has been performed on structural
stability, magnetic properties and electronic structure using spin-polarized
first-principles calculations. 36 stables functionalized MXenes were screened
from 144 explored DTM based MXenes. The explored materials exhibit striking
properties, having wide range of magnetic ground states, from non-magnetic to
ferromagnetic, and then to antiferromagnetic, accompanied by metallic to
half-metallic or gapless half-metallic properties, depending on transition
metal(s) and terminating group. Mo and W-based MXenes are found to be
nonmagnetic and metallic, whereas Cr-Mo and Cr-W-based MXenes are magnetic with
varying metallic behavior. W2CrN2O2 and Mo2CrN2O2 systems are found to be
ferromagnetic half-metallic 2D materials with a direct band gap of 1.35 eV and
0.77 eV respectively, in the minority spin channel. The comprehensive study on
DTM MXenes, provide intrinsic half-metallic properties along with robust
ferromagnetism, opens up a class of promising new 2D materials with tunable

<h3>Langevin picture of anomalous diffusion processes in expanding medium</h3>

Expanding medium is very common in many different fields, such as biology and
cosmology. It brings a nonnegligible influence on particle's diffusion, which
is quite different from the effect of an external force field. The dynamic
mechanism of particle's motion in expanding medium has only been investigated
in the framework of continuous-time random walk. To focus on more diffusion
processes and physical observables, we build the Langevin picture of anomalous
diffusion in expanding medium, and conduct detailed analyses in the framework
of Langevin equation. With the help of a subordinator, both subdiffusion
process and superdiffusion process in expanding medium are discussed. We find
that the expanding medium with different changing rate (exponential form and
power-law form) leads to quite different diffusion phenomena. The particle's
intrinsic diffusion behavior also plays an important role. Our detailed
theoretical analyses and simulations present a panoramic view of investigating
anomalous diffusion in expanding medium under the framework of Langevin
equation.

Learning about density functional approximations (DFAs), or approximations
for the exchange-correlation functional, can be intimidating. Density
Functional Theory is now one of the primary simulation tools for the practicing
chemist or materials scientist, and its accuracy relies upon an appropriate
choice of DFA. Over the past decades, there has been extensive research effort
to find better DFAs, and there is now a large body of literature to read
through for someone learning about DFAs for the first time. In this brief
report, I share an analysis that suggests which functionals and publications
have been the most influential, as a potential reading list to new scientists
in this area. Here, "influential" is defined as "likely to have informed the
design of another functional," and not simply a measure of number of citations,
or how much that functional has been used for practical applications. This
analysis is not claimed to be complete.

<h3>Excitonic Metal and Non-Fermi Liquid Behaviour in Twisted Double Bilayer  Graphene near Charge Neutrality</h3>

<br>
<br>
Twisted double bilayer graphene is a compensated semi-metal near the charge
neutrality point with the presence of small electron and hole pockets in its
band structure. We show that strong Coulomb attraction between the electrons
and holes can lead to the formation of indirect excitons. Condensation of these
excitons at low temperature creates an excitonic metal with charge density wave
order for an appropriate range of interaction strength. This has interesting
implications for low-temperature transport in the system as a function of
carrier density and temperature. The reorganization of the single particle
excitations and their density of states in the excitonic metal can lead to
peaks in resistivity as a function of carrier density, recently seen in
experiments at low temperatures. The fluctuations of the Landau damped order
parameter in the quantum critical metal lead to non-Fermi liquid behaviour,
which can explain the sublinear $T^{2/3}$ dependence of the resistance near the
charge neutrality point.

The existence of magnetostriction in bulk BiFeO3 is still a matter of
investigation and it is also an issue to investigate the magnetostriction
effect in nano BiFeO3. Present work demonstrates the existence of
magnetostrictive strain in superparamagnetic BiFeO3 nanoparticles at room
temperature and the magnetoelectric coupling properties in composite form with
P(VDFTrFE). Despite few reports on the magnetostriction effect in bulk BiFeO3
evidenced by the indirect method, the direct method (strain gauge) was employed
in this work to examine the magnetostriction of superparamagnetic BiFeO3. In
addition, a high magnetoelectric coupling coefficient was observed by the
lock-in technique for optimized BiFeO3_P(VDF-TrFE) nanocomposite film. These
nanocomposite films also exhibit room-temperature multiferroic properties.
These results provide aspects of material with immense potential for practical
applications in spintronics and magneto-electronics applications. We report a
magnetoelectric sensor using superparamagnetic BiFeO3_P(VDF-TrFE) nanocomposite

<br>
<br>
The competition between corner, edge and face-sharing octahedral networks is
a cause of phase inhomogeneity in metal halide perovskite thin-films. Here we
probe the charged iodine vacancy distribution and transport at the junction
between cubic and hexagonal polytypes of CsPbI$_3$ from first-principles
materials modelling. We predict a lower defect formation energy in the
face-sharing regions, which correlates with a longer Pb$-$I bond length and
causes a million-fold increase in local defect concentration. These defects are
predicted to be more mobile in the face-sharing regions with a reduced
activation energy for vacancy-mediated diffusion. We conclude that hexagonal
phase inclusions or interfaces will act as defect sinks that could trap charges
and enhance current-voltage hysteresis in perovskite-based solar cells and
electrical devices.

We investigated the structural, electronic, and superconducting properties of
Co1-xNixZr2, in which c-axis thermal expansion is systematically controlled. At
x (smaller than) 0.3, c-axis negative thermal expansion (NTE) was observed, and
the thermal expansion constant {\alpha}c approached zero with increasing x. At
x = 0.4-0.6, zero thermal expansion was observed, and positive thermal
expansion (PTE) appeared for x (greater than) 0.7. By analyzing the c/a ratio,
we observed a possible collapsed transition in the tetragonal lattice at around
x = 0.6-0.8. The lattice collapse results in c-axis PTE and the suppression of
bulk superconductivity.

The Seebeck coefficient, which is proportional to a ratio of the
thermoelectric conductivity to electrical conductivity, has been examined for
Dirac electrons in the organic conductor ET [BEDT-TTF denotes a molecule given
by bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene] under a uniaxial pressure using a
two-dimensional tight-binding (TB) model with both impurity and
electron--phonon (e--p) scatterings. We study an anomalous temperature
dependence of the Seebeck coefficient $S_{\nu}$ with $\nu = x$ (perpendicular
to the molecular stacking axis) and $y$, which shows $S_\nu > 0$ with a maximum
at high temperatures and $S_{\nu} < 0$ with a minimum at low temperatures. The
result is examined using a spectral conductivity and is compared with
experiments on ET.

We report the discovery of superconductivity at a pressure-induced magnetic
quantum critical point in the Kondo-lattice system CeSb2, sustained up to
magnetic fields that exceed the conventional Pauli limit eight-fold. Like
CeRh2As2, CeSb2 is locally non-centrosymmetric around the Ce-site, but the
evolution of critical fields and normal state properties as CeSb2 is tuned
through the quantum critical point motivates a fundamentally different
explanation for its resilience to applied field.

<br>
<br>
The majority-voter model is studied by Monte Carlo simulations on hypercubic
lattices of dimension $d=2$ to 7. The critical exponents $\gamma/\nu$ estimated
from the Finite-Size Scaling of the magnetic susceptibility are shown to be
compatible with those of the Ising model. At dimension $d=4$, the numerical
data are compatible with the presence of multiplicative logarithmic
corrections. For $d\ge 5$, the estimates of the exponents $\gamma/\nu$ are
close to the prediction $\gamma/\nu=d/2$ of the $\phi^4$ theory above the upper
critical dimension. Moreover, the universal values of the Binder cumulant are
also compatible with those of the Ising model. This indicates that the upper
critical dimension of the majority-voter model is not $d_c=6$ as claimed in the
literature, but $d_c=4$ like the equilibrium Ising model.

<br>

Recent experimental advances have been marked by the observations of
ballistic electron transport in moir\'e superlattices in highly aligned
heterostructures of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Here, we
predict that a high-quality graphene bilayer aligned with an hBN substrate
features $T^2$-dependent resistivity caused by umklapp electron-electron (Uee)
scattering from the moir\'e superlattice, that is, a momentum kick by Bragg
scattering experienced by a pair of electrons. Substantial Uee scattering
appears upon $p$-doping of the bilayer above a threshold density, which depends
on the twist angle between graphene and hBN, and its contribution towards the
resistivity grows rapidly with hole density until it reaches a peak value,
whose amplitude changes non-monotonically with the superlattice period. We also
analyse the influence of an electrostatically induced bandgap in the bilayer
and trigonal warping it enhances in the electron dispersion on the
electron-electron umklapp scattering.

Poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) based
pyroelectric as well as magnetoelectric materials offer great promises for
energy harvesting for flexible and wearable applications. Hence, this work
focus on solar energy harvesting as well as magnetoelectric phenomenon in two
phase nanocomposite film where the constituting phases are manganese ferrite
(MnFe2O4) nanoparticles and P(VDF-TrFE) polymer. Composite films have been
prepared using solution casting technique. X-ray diffraction result shows
higher crystallinity of these films. The ferroelectric, magnetic and
magnetoelectric properties in variation with applied field and volume
percentage of ferrite nanoparticles have been investigated. The preparation
condition was optimized in such a way that it results improved ferroelectric
polarization of nanocomposite film after incorporation of small amount of
ferrite nanoparticles. The maximum magnetoelectric-coupling coefficient of
about 156 mV/Oe-Cm was obtained for optimum nanocomposite film when DC bias
field was applied perpendicular to electric polarization direction. From a
pyroelectric device perspective, solar energy harvesting is also reported. An
open circuit voltage of 5V and short circuit current of order of ~1 nA is
demonstrated without any pre amplification. Hence, the combination of
magnetoelectric and pyroelectric properties of nanocomposite film presented
here indicate as a perfect candidate for smart materials, spintronics devices
and specified magnetoelectric-based applications.

<h3>Relaxation dynamics in a long-range system with mixed Hamiltonian and  non-Hamiltonian interactions</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Sometimes the dynamics of a physical system is described by non-Hamiltonian
equations of motion, and additionally, the system is characterized by
long-range interactions. A concrete example is that of particles interacting
with light as encountered in free-electron laser and cold-atom experiments. In
this work, we study the relaxation dynamics to non-Hamiltonian systems, more
precisely, to systems with interactions of both Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian
origin. Our model consists of $N$ globally-coupled particles moving on a circle
of unit radius; the model is one-dimensional. We show that in the infinite-size
limit, the dynamics, similarly to the Hamiltonian case, is described by the
Vlasov equation. In the Hamiltonian case, the system eventually reaches an
equilibrium state, even though one has to wait for a long time diverging with
$N$ for this to happen. By contrast, in the non-Hamiltonian case, there is no
equilibrium state that the system is expected to reach eventually. We
characterize this state with its average magnetization. We find that the
relaxation dynamics depends strongly on the relative weight of the Hamiltonian
and non-Hamiltonian contributions to the interaction. When the non-Hamiltonian
part is predominant, the magnetization attains a vanishing value, suggesting
that the system does not sustain states with constant magnetization, either
stationary or rotating. On the other hand, when the Hamiltonian part is
predominant, the magnetization presents long-lived strong oscillations, for
which we provide a heuristic explanation. Furthermore, we find that the
finite-size corrections are much more pronounced than those in the Hamiltonian
case; we justify this by showing that the Lenard-Balescu equation, which gives
leading-order corrections to the Vlasov equation, does not vanish, contrary to
what occurs in one-dimensional Hamiltonian long-range systems.

Thin NbSe$_2$ retains superconductivity at high in-plane magnetic field up to
30 T. In this work we construct an atomically thin, all van der Waals SQUID, in
which current flows between NbSe$_2$ contacts through two parallel graphene
weak links. This fully planar device remains uniquely stable at high in-plane
field. This enables tracing the evolution of the critical current interference
patterns as a function of the field up to 4.5 T, allowing nm-scale sensitivity
to deviations from a perfect atomic plane. We present numerical methods to
retrieve asymmetric current distributions J$_0$ from measured interference
maps, and suggest a new application of the dual junction geometry to probe the
current density in the absence of phase information. The interference maps
exhibit a striking field-driven transition, indicating a redistribution of
supercurrents to narrow channels. Our results suggest the existence of a
preferred conductance channel with an exceptional stability to in-plane
magnetic field.

High temperature superconductivity encompasses the cuprates, nickelates, iron

in the pairing electrons, which are strongly to moderately correlated, whereas
in the last class of systems specific phonon excitations. In this overview we
concentrate first on the (semi)quantitative theory of high T$_{C}$
superconductivity in the cuprates based on our original vibrational approach
beyond the renormalized mean field theory. The model we explore mainly is
$t$-$J$-$U$ model containing both the superexchange (kinetic energy) combined
with strong interelectronic correlations. Selected equilibrium and
dynamic-excitation properties are analyzed briefly. General questions regarding
the pseudogap and two--dimensional character of those systems are raised.

In graphene, charged defects break the electron-hole symmetry and can even
give rise to exotic collapse states when the defect charge exceeds a critical
value which is proportional to the Fermi velocity. In this work, we investigate
the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) with charged
defects using tight-binding calculations. Like monolayer graphene, tBLG
exhibits linear bands near the Fermi level but with a dramatically reduced
Fermi velocity near the magic angle (approximately 1.1{\deg}). This suggests
that the critical value of the defect charge in magic-angle tBLG should also be
very small. We find that charged defects give rise to significant changes in
the low-energy electronic structure of tBLG. Depending on the defect position
in the moir\'e unit cell, it is possible to open a band gap or to induce an
additional flattening of the low-energy valence and conduction bands. Our
calculations suggest that the collapse states of the two monolayers hybridize
in the twisted bilayer. However, their in-plane localization remains largely
unaffected by the presence of the additional twisted layer because of the
different length scales of the moir\'e lattice and the monolayer collapse state
wavefunctions. These predictions can be tested in scanning tunnelling
spectroscopy experiments.

<br>
<br>
The quadrupole coupling constant $C_Q$ and the asymmetry parameter $\eta$
have been determined for two complex aluminium hydrides from $^{27}$Al NMR
spectra recorded for stationary samples by using the Solomon echo sequence. The
thus obtained data for KAlH4 ($C_Q=(1.30\pm0.02)$ MHz, $\eta=(0.64\pm0.02)$)
and NaAlH4 ($C_Q=(3.11\pm0.02)$ MHz, $\eta<0.01$) agree very well with data
previously determined from MAS NMR spectra. The accuracy with which these
parameters can be determined from static spectra turned out to be at least as
good as via the MAS approach. The experimentally determined parameters
($\delta_{iso}$, $C_Q$ and $\eta$) are compared with those obtained from
DFT-GIPAW (density functional theory - gauge-including projected augmented
wave) calculations. Except for the quadrupole coupling constant for KAlH4,
which is overestimated in the GIPAW calculations by about 30%, the agreement is
excellent. Advantages of the application of the Solomon echo sequence for the
measurement of less stable materials or for in-situ studies are discussed.

Materials modelling and processing require experiments to visualize and
quantify how external excitations drive the evolution of deep subsurface
structure and defects that determine properties. Today, 3D movies with ~100-nm
resolution of crystalline structure are regularly acquired in minutes to hours
using X-ray diffraction based imaging. We present an X-ray microscope that
improves this time resolution to <100 femtoseconds, with images attainable even
from a single X-ray pulse. Using this, we resolve the propagation of 18-km/s
acoustic waves in mm-sized diamond crystals, and demonstrate how mechanical
energy thermalizes from picosecond to microsecond timescales. Our approach
unlocks a vast range of new experiments of materials phenomena with intricate
structural dynamics at ultrafast timescales.

In scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments of molecules on insulating
films, tunneling through molecular resonances implies transiently charging the
molecule. The transition back to the charge ground state by tunneling through
the insulating film is crucial, for example, for understanding STM-induced
electroluminescence. Here, using STM, we report on the charge-state lifetimes
of individual molecules adsorbed on NaCl films of different thicknesses on
Cu(111) and Au(111). To that end, we approached the tip to the molecule at
resonant tunnel conditions up to a regime where charge transport was limited by
tunneling through the NaCl film. The resulting saturation of tunnel current is
a direct measure of the molecule's charge-state lifetime, thus providing a
means to study charge and, thereby, exciton dynamics. A comparison of anion and
cation lifetimes on different substrates reveals the critical role of the level
alignment with the insulator's conduction and valence band, and the
metal-insulator interface state.

<br>
<br>
In a metal with multiple Fermi pockets, the formation of s-wave
superconductivity can be conventional due to electron-phonon coupling or
unconventional due to spin fluctuations. We analyze the hexagonal diboride
CrB$_2$, which is an itinerant antiferromagnet at ambient conditions and turns
superconducting upon increasing pressure. While the high pressure behavior of
T$_c$ suggests conventional s-wave pairing, we find that spin fluctuations
promoting unconventional s-wave pairing become important in the vicinity of the
antiferromagnetic dome. As the symmetry class of the s-wave state is
independent of its underlying mechanism, we argue that CrB$_2$ is a realization
of a hybrid s-wave superconductor where unconventional and conventional s-wave
mechanisms team up to form a joint superconducting dome.

<br>
<br>
We investigate the properties of spin-imbalanced ultracold Fermi gas in a
large range of spin polarizations at low temperatures. We present the results
of microscopic calculations based on mean-field and density functional theory
approaches, with no symmetry constraints. At low polarization values we predict
the structure of the system as consisting of several spin-polarized droplets.
As the polarization increases, the system self-organizes into a disordered
structure similar to liquid crystals, and energetically they can compete with
ordered structures such as grid-like domain walls. At higher polarizations the
system starts to develop regularities that, in principle, can be called
supersolid, where periodic density modulation and pairing correlations coexist.
The robustness of the results has been checked with respect to temperature
effects, dimensionality, and the presence of a trapping potential. Dynamical
stability has also been investigated.

We use trajectory averaging to show that the energy dissipated in the
nonequilibrium energy-state transitions of a driven two-state system satisfies
a fluctuation-dissipation relation. This connection between the average energy
dissipation induced by external driving and its fluctuations about equilibrium
is preserved by an adiabatic approximation scheme. We use this scheme to obtain
the heat statistics of a single-electron box with superconducting leads in the
slow-driving regime, where the dissipated heat becomes normally distributed
with a relatively high probability to be extracted from the environment rather
than dissipated. We also discuss heat fluctuation relations for driven
two-state transitions.

<h3>Static Friction Coefficient Depends on the External Pressure and Block  Shape due to Precursor Slip: Finite Element Simulation</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Amontons' law states that the maximum static friction force on a solid object
is proportional to the loading force and is independent of the apparent contact
area. This law indicates that the static friction coefficient does not depend
on the external pressure or object shape. Here, we numerically investigate the
sliding motion of a 3D viscoelastic block on a rigid substrate using the finite
element method (FEM). The macroscopic static friction coefficient decreases
with an increase in the external pressure, length, or width of the object,
which contradicts Amontons' law. Precursor slip occurs in the 2D interface
between the block and substrate before bulk sliding. The decrease in the
macroscopic static friction coefficient is scaled by the critical area of the
precursor slip before bulk sliding. A theoretical analysis of the simplified
models reveals that bulk sliding results from the instability of the
quasi-static precursor slip caused by velocity-weakening local friction. We
also show that the critical slip area determines the macroscopic static
friction coefficient, which explains the results of the FEM simulation.

<h3>Spin wave excitations in a nanowire spin-torque oscillator with  perpendicular magnetic anisotropy</h3>

Spin torque oscillators (STOs) are emerging microwave devices that can
potentially be used in spin-logic devices and the next-generation high-speed
computing architecture. Thanks to their non-linear nature, STOs are easily
tunable by the magnetic field and the dc current. Spin Hall nano-oscillators
(SHNOs) are promising types of STOs and most of the current studies focus on
localized modes that can be easily excited. Here, we study using micromagnetic
simulations, the nature of the spin-torque-induced excitations in nanowire
devices made of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) material. Our results
showed that upon including PMA the excitation of localized and propagating spin
wave modes is feasible. We study the nature of the mode excitations as a
function of the PMA strength (\text{K}$_u$), and the current. Indeed, we
estimate a critical value of \text{K}$_u$ to allow for the excitation of the
propagating spin wave. We attribute this mode selectivity between localized and
propagating modes to a switch in the sign of the nonlinearity of the system
from negative to positive at a non-zero \text{K}$_u$ which is supported by
analytical calculations. Our results provide deep insight into engineering
reconfigurable microwave devices for future magnonic and computational
applications.

This letter reports high-performance $\mathrm{\beta} Ga2O3 thin channel
MOSFETs with T-gate and degenerately doped source/drain contacts regrown by
MOCVD. Gate length scaling (LG= 160-200 nm) leads to a peak drain current
(ID,MAX) of 285 mA/mm and peak trans-conductance (gm) of 52 mS/mm at 10 V drain
bias with 23.5 Ohm mm on resistance (Ron). A low metal/n+ contact resistance of
0.078 Ohm mm was extracted from TLM measurement. Ron is dominated by interface
resistance between channel and regrown layer. A gate-to-drain breakdown voltage
of 192 V is measured for LGD = 355 nm resulting in average breakdown field
(E_AVG) of 5.4 MV/cm. This E_AVG is the highest reported among all sub-micron
gate length lateral FETs. RF measurements on 200 nm Silicon Nitride (Si3N4)
passivated device shows a current gain cut off frequency (f_T) of 11 GHz and
record power gain cut off frequency (f_MAX) of 48 GHz. The f_T.V_Br product is
2.11 THz.V for 192 V breakdown voltage. The switching figure of merit exceeds
that of silicon and is comparable to mature wide-band gap devices.

Extracting information from radiofrequency (RF) signals using artificial
neural networks at low energy cost is a critical need for a wide range of
applications. Here we show how to leverage the intrinsic dynamics of spintronic
nanodevices called magnetic tunnel junctions to process multiple analogue RF
inputs in parallel and perform synaptic operations. Furthermore, we achieve
classification of RF signals with experimental data from magnetic tunnel
junctions as neurons and synapses, with the same accuracy as an equivalent
software neural network. These results are a key step for embedded
radiofrequency artificial intelligence.

We develop an algorithm to construct mass-spring networks differing in the
correlation length of their local elastic properties. These networks reproduce
Boson peak and quasi-localized vibrational modes observed in glasses and their
relationship. The sound attenuation rate also behaves as in glasses, varying
from a Rayleigh scattering to a disorder-broadening regime on increasing the
frequency. We find that networks modelling glasses with increased stability
have a reduced elastic correlation length. Our results support a deep
connection between the various vibrational features of disordered solids and
clarify their relationship with the correlation length of the local elastic
properties.

Among several approaches to tackle the problem of energy consumption in
modern computing systems, two solutions are currently investigated: one
consists of artificial neural networks (ANNs) based on photonic technologies,
the other is a different paradigm compared to ANNs and it is based on random
networks of nonlinear nanoscale junctions resulting from the assembling of
nanoparticles or nanowires as substrates for neuromorphic computing. These
networks show the presence of emergent complexity and collective phenomena in
analogy with biological neural networks characterized by self-organization,
redundancy, non-linearity. Starting from this background, we propose and
formalize a generalization of the perceptron model to describe a classification
device based on a network of interacting units where the input weights are
nonlinearly dependent. We show that this model, called "receptron", provides
substantial advantages compared to the perceptron as, for example, the solution
of non-linearly separable Boolean functions with a single device. The receptron
model is used as a starting point for the implementation of an all-optical
device that exploits the non-linearity of optical speckle fields produced by a
solid scatterer. By encoding these speckle fields we generated a large variety
of target Boolean functions without the need for time-consuming machine
learning algorithms. We demonstrate that by properly setting the model
parameters, different classes of functions with different multiplicity can be
solved efficiently. The optical implementation of the receptron scheme opens
the way for the fabrication of a completely new class of optical devices for
neuromorphic data processing based on a very simple hardware.

The recent observation of correlated phases in transition metal
dichalcogenide moir\'e systems at integer and fractional filling promises new
insight into metal-insulator transitions and the unusual states of matter that
can emerge near such transitions. Here, we combine real- and momentum-space
mapping techniques to study moir\'e superlattice effects in 57.4$^{\circ}$
twisted WSe$_2$ (tWSe$_2$). Our data reveal a split-off flat band that derives
from the monolayer $\Gamma$ states. Using advanced data analysis, we directly
quantify the moir\'e potential from our data. We further demonstrate that the
global valence band maximum in tWSe$_2$ is close in energy to this flat band
but derives from the monolayer K-states which show weaker superlattice effects.
These results constrain theoretical models and open the perspective that
$\Gamma$-valley flat bands might be involved in the correlated physics of
twisted WSe$_2$.

A domain wall (DW) which moves parallel to a magnetically compensated
interface between an antiferromagnetic insulator (AFMI) and a two-dimensional
(2D) metal can pump spin polarization into the metal. It is assumed that
localized spins of a collinear AFMI interact with itinerant electrons through
their exchange interaction on the interface. We employed the formalism of
Keldysh Green's functions for electrons which experience potential and
spin-orbit scattering on random impurities. This formalism allows a unified
analysis of spin pumping, spin diffusion and spin relaxation effects on a 2D
electron gas. It is shown that the pumping of a nonstaggered magnetization into
the metal film takes place in the second order with respect to the interface
exchange interaction. At sufficiently weak spin relaxation this pumping effect
can be much stronger than the first-order effect of the Pauli magnetism which
is produced by the small nonstaggered exchange field of the DW. It is shown
that the pumped polarization is sensitive to the geometry of the electron's
Fermi surface and increases when the wave vector of the staggered magnetization
approaches the nesting vector of the Fermi surface. In a disordered diffusive
electron gas the induced spin polarization follows the motion of the domain
wall. It is distributed asymmetrically around the DW over a distance which can
be much larger than the DW width.

<br>
<br>
The formation of the charge density wave (CDW) in two-dimensional (2D)
materials caused by Peierls instability remains controversial. The role played
by Fermi surface nesting in giving the CDW state in the 2H-NbSe2 material has
been debated and is to be investigated here. Four NbSe2 structures, Normal,
Stripe, Filled, and Hollow ones, have been identified based on the
characteristics in scanning tunneling microscope images and first-principles
simulations. The calculations reveal that the Filled phase follows Peierls's
description in exhibiting fully opened gaps at the CDW Brillouin zone boundary,
resulting in a drop at the Fermi level in the density of states (DOS) and the
scanning tunneling spectroscopy spectra. The electronic susceptibility and
phonon instability in the Normal phase further support that the Fermi surface
nesting is triggered by two nesting vectors, whereas solely one vector leads to
the Stripe phase. This comprehensive study demonstrates that the Filled phase
of NbSe2 can be categorized into the Peierls-instability-induced CDW in 2D
systems.

Spatial confinement of electronic topological surface states (TSS) in
topological insulators poses a formidable challenge because TSS are protected
by time-reversal symmetry. In previous works formation of a gap in the
electronic spectrum of TSS has been successfully demonstrated in topological
insulator/magnetic material heterostructures, where ferromagnetic exchange
interactions locally lifts the time-reversal symmetry. Here we report an
experimental evidence of exchange interaction between a topological insulator
Bi2Se3 and a magnetic insulator EuSe. Spin-polarized neutron reflectometry
reveals a reduction of the in-plane magnetic susceptibility within a 2 nm
interfacial layer of EuSe, and the combination of SQUID magnetometry and Hall
measurements points to the formation of an antiferromagnetic layer with at
least five-fold enhancement of N\'eel's temperature. Abrupt resistance changes
in high magnetic fields indicate interfacial exchange coupling that affects
transport in a TSS. High temperature local control of TSS with zero net
magnetization unlocks new opportunities for the design of electronic,
spintronic and quantum computation devices, ranging from quantization of Hall
conductance in zero fields to spatial localization of non-Abelian excitations
in superconducting topological qubits.

Magnetic gels are composite materials, consisting of a polymer matrix and
embedded magnetic particles. Those are mechanically coupled to each other,
giving rise to the magnetostrictive effects as well as to a controllable
overall elasticity responsive to external magnetic fields. Due to their
inherent composite and thereby multiscale nature, a theoretical framework
bridging different levels of description is indispensable for understanding the
magnetomechanical properties of magnetic gels. In this study, we extend a
recently developed density functional approach from two spatial dimensions to
more realistic three-dimensional systems. Along these lines, we connect a
mesoscopic characterization resolving the discrete structure of the magnetic
particles, to macroscopic continuum parameters of magnetic gels. In particular,
we incorporate the long-range nature of the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction,
and consider the approximate incompressibility of the embedding media, and
relative rotations with respect to an external magnetic field breaking
rotational symmetry. We then probe the shape of the model system in its
reference state, confirming the dependence of magnetostrictive effects on the
configuration of the magnetic particles and on the shape of the considered
sample. Moreover, calculating the elastic and rotational coefficients on the
basis of our mesoscopic approach, we examine how the macroscopic types of
behavior are related to the mesoscopic properties. Implications for real
systems of random particle configurations are also discussed.

We present time-resolved scanning x-ray microscopy measurements with
picosecond photo-excitation via a tailored infrared pump laser at a scanning
transmission x-ray microscope. Specifically, we image the laser-induced
demagnetization and remagnetization of thin ferrimagnetic GdFe films proceeding
on a few nanoseconds time scale. Controlling the heat load on the sample via
additional reflector and heat-sink layers allows us to conduct destruction-free
measurements at a repetition rate of \SI{50}{\mega\hertz}. Near-field
enhancement of the photo-excitation and controlled annealing effects lead to
laterally heterogeneous magnetization dynamics which we trace with
\SI{30}{\nano\meter} spatial resolution. Our work opens new opportunities to
study photo-induced dynamics on the nanometer scale, with access to picosecond
to nanosecond timescales, which is of technological relevance, especially in

New phases of matter can be stabilized by a combination of diverging
electronic density of states, strong interactions, and spin-orbit coupling.
Recent experiments in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) have uncovered
a wealth of novel phases as a result of interaction-driven spin-valley flavour
polarization. In this work, we explore correlated phases appearing due to the
combined effect of spin-orbit coupling-enhanced valley polarization and large
density of states below half filling ($\nu \lesssim 2$) of the moir\'e band in
a TBG coupled to tungsten diselenide. We observe anomalous Hall effect,
accompanied by a series of Lifshitz transitions, that are highly tunable with
carrier density and magnetic field. Strikingly, the magnetization shows an
abrupt sign change in the vicinity of half-filling, confirming its orbital
nature. The coercive fields reported are about an order of magnitude higher
than previous studies in graphene-based moir\'e systems, presumably aided by a
Stoner instability favoured by the van Hove singularities in the malleable
bands. While the Hall resistance is not quantized at zero magnetic fields,
indicative of a ground state with partial valley polarization, perfect
quantization and complete valley polarization are observed at finite fields.
Our findings illustrate that singularities in the flat bands in the presence of
spin-orbit coupling can stabilize ordered phases even at non-integer moir\'e
band fillings.

<h3>Critical scaling through Gini index</h3>

In the systems showing critical behavior, various response functions have a
singularity at the critical point in the form $M\sim |F-F_c|^{-n}$. The value
of $ {M}$, therefore, changes drastically as the driving field $F$ is tuned
towards its critical value $F_c$. The inequality in the values of $ {M}$ within
a range $aF_c$ to $bF_c$ ($0<a<b\leq 1$) can be quantified by the Gini index
$g$. We show that for $n<1$, the Gini index obeys a scaling of the form
$|F-F_c|\sim |g-g_f|^{1/(1-n)}$, where $g_f=g(b=1)=n/(2-n)$. This implies $
{M}\sim |g-g_f|^{-n/(1-n)}$. For $1<n<2$, $|F-F_c| \sim |g-g_f|^{1/(n-1)}$,
with $g_f=1$ which implies $ {M}\sim |g-g_f|^{-n/(n-1)}$ and similarly for
$n>2$, $|F-F_c| \sim |g-g_f|$, with $g_f=1$, therefore $ {M}\sim |g-g_f|^{-n}$
. Since $g_f$ is either solely a function of the (universal) critical exponent
$n$ or a constant, the above relations help in formulating the critical scaling
behavior in quantities like $ {M}$ independent of the (non-universal) critical
point of the system. We further show for $n>1$, another measure of inequality
-- the Kolkata index $k$, coincides with the Gini index value at a point
$F_e<F_c$. The coincidence of the two indices, therefore, serve as a crucial
indicator of the imminent critical point. We demonstrate the utility of this
precursory signal in the fiber bundle model for fracture of disordered solids.
This approach can be used in any equilibrium or non-equilibrium systems showing
critical behavior.

Based on a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau system of equations and finite
element modeling, we present novel results related with the physics of
phase-slippage in superconducting wires surrounded by a non-superconductive
environment. These results are obtained within our previously reported approach
related to superconducting rings and superconductive gravitational wave
detector transducers. It is shown that the phase-slip centers (PSCs) can be
effective in originating not only positive but also negative thermal fluxes.
With an appropriate design utilizing thermal diodes, PSCs can serve as
cryocooling engines. Operating at $T\sim 1$ K cryostat cold-finger, they can
achieve sub-Kelvin temperatures without using $^3$He.

Ultrafast quantum dynamics relaxation of a photoexcited state in a strongly
correlated spin crossover system LaCoO3 under a sudden perturbation is
considered with the density matrix generalized master equation. The
magnetization and cobalt-oxygen bond length oscillations were found. The
evolution of the electronic band structure during relaxation is calculated in
the framework of the LDA+GTB method.

We demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing the recently established
Floquet-assisted superradiance for laser operation. In particular, we show the
robustness of this state against key imperfections. We consider the effect of a
finite linewidth of the driving field, modelled via phase diffusion. We find
that the linewidth of the light field in the cavity narrows drastically across
the FSP transition, reminiscent of a line narrowing at the laser transition.
Next, we demonstrate that the FSP is robust against inhomogeneous broadening,
while displaying a reduction of light intensity. We show that the depleted
population inversion of near-resonant Floquet states leads to hole burning in
the inhomogeneously broadened Floquet spectra. Finally, we show that the FSP is
robust against dissipation processes, with coefficients up to values that are
experimentally available. We conclude that the FSP presents a robust mechanism
that is capable of realistic laser operation.

We consider the problem of modeling heterogeneous materials where micro-scale
dynamics and interactions affect global behavior. In the presence of
heterogeneities in material microstructure it is often impractical, if not
impossible, to provide quantitative characterization of material response. The
goal of this work is to develop a Bayesian framework for uncertainty
quantification (UQ) in material response prediction when using nonlocal models.
Our approach combines the nonlocal operator regression (NOR) technique and
Bayesian inference. Specifically, we use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
method to sample the posterior probability distribution on parameters involved
in the nonlocal constitutive law, and associated modeling discrepancies
relative to higher fidelity computations. As an application, we consider the
propagation of stress waves through a one-dimensional heterogeneous bar with
randomly generated microstructure. Several numerical tests illustrate the
construction, enabling UQ in nonlocal model predictions. Although nonlocal
models have become popular means for homogenization, their statistical
calibration with respect to high-fidelity models has not been presented before.
This work is a first step towards statistical characterization of nonlocal
model discrepancy in the context of homogenization.

Due to its potential connection with nematicity, electronic anisotropy has
been the subject of intense research effort on a wide variety of material
platforms. The emergence of spatial anisotropy not only offers a
characterization of material properties of metallic phases, which cannot be
accessed via conventional transport techniques, but it also provides a unique
window into the interplay between Coulomb interaction and broken symmetry
underlying the electronic order. In this work, we utilize a new scheme of
angle-resolved transport measurement (ARTM) to characterize electron anisotropy
in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene. By analyzing the dependence of
spatial anisotropy on moir\'e band filling, temperature and twist angle, we
establish the first experimental link between electron anisotropy and the
cascade phenomenon, where Coulomb interaction drives a number of isospin
transitions near commensurate band fillings. Furthermore, we report the
coexistence between electron anisotropy and a novel electronic order that
breaks both parity and time reversal symmetry. Combined, the link between
electron anisotropy, cascade phenomenon and PT-symmetry breaking sheds new
light onto the nature of electronic order in magic-angle graphene moir\'e
systems.

The pursuit of quantum spin liquid (QSL) in the Kitaev honeycomb magnets has
drawn intensive attention recently. In particular, $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has been
widely recognised as a promising candidate for the Kitaev QSL. Although the
compound exhibits an antiferromagnetic order under zero field, it is believed
to be endowed with fractionalized excitations, and can be driven to the QSL
phase by magnetic fields. Here, based on a realistic $K$-$J$-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$
model for $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ [1], we exploit the exponential tensor
renormalization group approach to explore the phase diagram of the compound
under magnetic fields. We calculate the thermodynamic quantities, including the
specific heat, Gr\"uneisen parameter, magnetic torque, and the magnetotropic
susceptibility, etc, under a magnetic field with a tilting angle $\theta$ to
the $c^*$-axis perpendicular to the honeycomb plane. We find an extended QSL in
the angle-field phase diagram determined with thermodynamic responses. The
gapless nature of such field-induced QSL is identified from the specific heat
and entropy data computed down to very low temperatures. The present study
provides guidance for future high-field experiments for the QSL in
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and other candidate Kitaev magnets.
