<h3>Chirality and odd mechanics in active columnar phases</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19514" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19514</a>
<br>
</p><i>S. J. Kole, Gareth P. Alexander, Ananyo Maitra, Sriram Ramaswamy</i>
<p>Chiral active materials display odd dynamical effects in both their elastic
and viscous responses. We show that the most symmetric mesophase with
two-dimensional odd elasticity in three dimensions is chiral, polar and
columnar, with two-dimensional translational order in the plane perpendicular
to the columns and no elastic restoring force for their relative sliding. We
derive its hydrodynamic equations from those of a chiral active variant of
model H. The most striking prediction of the odd dynamics is two distinct types
of column oscillation whose frequencies do not vanish at zero wavenumber. In
addition, activity leads to a buckling instability coming from the generic
force-dipole active stress analogous to the mechanical Helfrich-Hurault
instability in passive materials, while the chiral torque-dipole active stress
fundamentally modifies the instability by the selection of helical column
undulations.

<h3>On the kinetics of homogeneous nucleation of incoherent precipitates in  solid solutions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18957" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18957</a>
<br>
</p><i>M.S. Veshchunov</i>
<p>By critically examining the traditional theory of homogeneous nucleation of
precipitates in solid solutions, it is revealed that the theory's assertion
regarding an increase in the nucleation free energy due to elastic strain
associated with the difference in atomic volumes between the two phases is
applicable to coherent precipitates, but becomes incorrect when applied to
incoherent precipitates. This conclusion is obtained by accounting for thermal
point defects in the matrix, which can be absorbed at the interface between an
incoherent particle and the matrix during nucleation, thereby relieving elastic
stresses. Accordingly, a new kinetic model based on the Reiss theory for binary
nucleation is proposed for predicting the nucleation rate of incoherent
precipitates by agglomeration of solute atoms and point defects, with a further
extension to account for excess vacancies formed under non-equilibrium
conditions of quenching experiments.

<h3>Chirality-induced spin selectivity by variable-range hopping along DNA  double helix</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19000" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19000</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ryotaro Sano, Takeo Kato</i>
<p>We here present a variable-range hopping model to describe the
chirality-induced spin selectivity along the DNA double helix. In this model,
DNA is considered as a one-dimensional disordered system, where electrons are
transported by chiral phonon-assisted hopping between localized states. Owing
to the coupling between the electron spin and the vorticity of chiral phonons,
electric toroidal monopole appears in the charge-to-spin conductances as a
manifestation of true chirality. Our model quantitatively explains the
temperature dependence of the spin polarization observed in experiments.

<h3>Topological holography for fermions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19004" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19004</a>
<br>
</p><i>Rui Wen, Weicheng Ye, Andrew C. Potter</i>
<p>Topological holography is a conjectured correspondence between the symmetry
charges and defects of a $D$-dimensional system with the anyons in a
$(D+1)$-dimensional topological order: the symmetry topological field theory
(SymTFT). Topological holography is conjectured to capture the topological
aspects of symmetry in gapped and gapless systems, with different phases
corresponding to different gapped boundaries (anyon condensations) of the
SymTFT. This correspondence was previously considered primarily for bosonic
systems, excluding many phases of condensed matter systems involving fermionic
electrons. In this work, we extend the SymTFT framework to establish a
topological holography correspondence for fermionic systems. We demonstrate
that this fermionic SymTFT framework captures the known properties of $1+1D$
fermion gapped phases and critical points, including the classification,
edge-modes, and stacking rules of fermionic symmetry-protected topological
phases (SPTs), and computation of partition functions of fermionic conformal
field theories (CFTs). Beyond merely reproducing known properties, we show that
the SymTFT approach can additionally serve as a practical tool for discovering
new physics, and use this framework to construct a new example of a fermionic
intrinsically gapless SPT phase characterized by an emergent fermionic anomaly.

<h3>Classical origins of Landau-incompatible transitions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19009" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19009</a>
<br>
</p><i>Abhishodh Prakash, Nick G. Jones</i>
<p>Continuous phase transitions where symmetry is spontaneously broken are
ubiquitous in physics and often found between `Landau-compatible' phases where
residual symmetries of one phase are a subset of the other. However, continuous
`deconfined quantum critical' transitions between Landau-incompatible
symmetry-breaking phases are known to exist in certain quantum systems, often
with anomalous microscopic symmetries. In this paper, we investigate the need
for such special conditions. We show that Landau-incompatible transitions can
be found in a family of well-known classical statistical mechanical models with
anomaly-free on-site microscopic symmetries, introduced by Jos\'{e}, Kadanoff,
Kirkpatick and Nelson (Phys. Rev. B 16, 1217). The models are labeled by a
positive integer $Q$ and constructed by a deformation of the 2d classical XY
model, defined on any lattice, with an on-site potential that preserves a
discrete $Q$-fold spin rotation and reflection symmetry. For a range of
temperatures, even $Q$ models exhibit two Landau-incompatible partial
symmetry-breaking phases and a direct transition between them for $Q \ge 4$.
Characteristic features of Landau-incompatible transitions are easily seen,
such as enhanced symmetries and melting of charged defects. For odd $Q$, and
corresponding temperature ranges, two regions of a single partial
symmetry-breaking phase are obtained, split by a stable `unnecessary critical'
line. We present quantum models with anomaly-free symmetries that also exhibit
similar phase diagrams.

<h3>Investigating the superconducting state of 2$H$-NbS$_2$ as seen by the  vortex lattice</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19049" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19049</a>
<br>
</p><i>A. Alshemi, E. Campillo, E. M. Forgan, R. Cubitt, M. Abdel-Hafiez, E. Blackburn</i>
<p>2$H$-NbS$_2$ is a classic example of an anisotropic multi-band
superconductor, with significant recent work focussing on the interesting
responses seen when high magnetic fields are applied precisely parallel to the
hexagonal niobium planes. It is often contrasted with its sister compound
2$H$-NbSe$_2$ because they have similar onset temperatures for
superconductivity, but 2$H$-NbS$_2$ has no charge density wave whereas in
2$H$-NbSe$_2$ the charge density wave order couples strongly to the
superconductivity. Using small-angle neutron scattering, a bulk-sensitive
probe, we have studied the vortex lattice and how it responds to the underlying
superconducting anisotropy. This is done by controlling the orientation of the
field with respect to the Nb planes. The superconducting anisotropy,
$\Gamma_{ac} = 7.07 \pm 0.2$, is found to be field independent over the range
measured (0.15 to 1.25 T), and the magnetic field distribution as a function of
the applied magnetic field is found to be in excellent quantitative agreement
with anisotropic London theory modified with a core-size cut-off correction,
providing the first complete validation of this model. We find values of
$\lambda_{ab} = 141.9 \pm 1.5 $ nm for the in-plane London penetration depth,
and $\lambda_{c} \sim$ 1 \textmu m for the out-of-plane response. The
field-independence indicates that we are primarily sampling the larger of the
two gaps generating the superconductivity in this material.

<h3>Phase Ordering in Binary Mixtures of Active Nematic Fluids</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19061" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19061</a>
<br>
</p><i>Saraswat Bhattacharyya, Julia M. Yeomans</i>
<p>We use a continuum, two-fluid approach to study a mixture of two active
nematic fluids. Even in the absence of thermodynamically-driven ordering, for
mixtures of different activities we observe turbulent microphase separation,
where domains form and disintegrate chaotically in an active turbulent
background. This is a weak effect if there is no elastic nematic alignment
between the two fluid components, but is greatly enhanced in the presence of an
elastic alignment or substrate friction. We interpret the results in terms of
relative flows between the two species which result from active anchoring at
concentration gradients. Our results may have relevance in interpreting
epithelial cell sorting and the dynamics of multi-species bacterial colonies.

<h3>Self-reverting vortices in chiral active matter</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19062" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19062</a>
<br>
</p><i>Lorenzo Caprini, Benno Liebchen, Hartmut Löwen</i>
<p>There is currently a strong interest in the collective behavior of chiral
active particles that can propel and rotate themselves. In the presence of
alignment interactions for many chiral particles, chiral self-propulsion can
induce vortex patterns in the velocity fields. However, these emerging patterns
are non-permanent, and do not induce global vorticity. Here we combine
theoretical arguments and computer simulations to predict a so-far unknown
class of collective behavior. We show that, for chiral active particles,
vortices with significant dynamical coherence emerge spontaneously. They
originate from the interplay between attraction interactions and chirality in
the absence of alignment interactions. Depending on parameters, the vortices
can either feature a constant vorticity or a vorticity that oscillates
periodically in time, resulting in self-reverting vortices. Our results may
guide future experiments to realize customized collective phenomena such as
spontaneously rotating gears and patterns with a self-reverting order.

<h3>Chaos-Assisted Dynamical Tunneling in Flat Band Superwires</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19074" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19074</a>
<br>
</p><i>Anton Marius Graf, Ke Lin, MyeongSeo Kim, Joonas Keski-Rahkonen, Alvar Daza, Eric Heller</i>
<p>Recent theoretical investigations have revealed unconventional transport
mechanisms within high Brilliouin zones of two-dimensional superlattices.
Electrons can navigate along channels we call superwires, gently guided without
brute force confinement. Such dynamical confinement is caused by weak
superlattice deflections, markedly different from the static or energetic
confinement observed in traditional wave guides or one-dimensional electron
wires. The quantum properties of superwires give rise to elastic dynamical
tunneling, linking disjoint regions of the corresponding classical phase space,
and enabling the emergence of several parallel channels. This paper provides
the underlying theory and mechanisms that facilitate dynamical tunneling
assisted by chaos in periodic lattices. Moreover, we show that the mechanism of
dynamical tunneling can be effectively conceptualized through the lens of a
paraxial approximation. Our results further reveal that superwires
predominantly exist within flat bands, emerging from eigenstates that represent
linear combinations of conventional degenerate Bloch states. Finally, we
quantify tunneling rates across various lattice configurations, and demonstrate
the tunneling can be suppressed in a controlled fashion, illustrating potential
implications in future nanodevices.

<h3>Nonlinear microrheology with time-dependent forces -- Application to  recoils in viscoelastic fluids</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19085" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19085</a>
<br>
</p><i>Nikolas Ditz, Antonio M. Puertas, M. Fuchs</i>
<p>This work presents a theoretical analysis of the motion of a tracer colloid
driven by a time-dependent force through a viscoelastic fluid. The recoil of
the colloid after application of a strong force is determined. It provides
insights into the elastic forces stored locally in the fluid and their
weakening by plastic processes. We generalize the mode coupling theory of
microrheology to include time-dependent forces. After deriving the equations of
motion for the tracer correlator and simplifying to a schematic model we apply
the theory to a switch-off force protocol that features the recoiling of the
tracer after cessation of the driving. We also include Langevin dynamics
simulations to compare to the results of the theory. A non-monotonic trend of
the recoil amplitude is found in the theory and confirmed in the simulations.
The linear-response approximation is also verified in the small-force regime.
While the overall agreement between simulation and theory is good, simulation
shows that the theory predicts a too strong non-monotonous dependence of the
recoil distance on the applied force.

<h3>Electronic correlations, layer distinction, and electron doping in the  alternating single-layer trilayer La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ polymorph</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19089" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19089</a>
<br>
</p><i>Harrison LaBollita, Soumen Bag, Jesse Kapeghian, Antia S. Botana</i>
<p>We employ a density-functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory
framework to investigate the correlated electronic structure of the alternating
single-layer trilayer (1313) polymorph of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure. We
find that La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-1313 exhibits electronically distinct layers in
terms of their correlations. At ambient pressure, the single-layer is in a Mott
insulating regime and the low-energy physics is dominated by the trilayer
block. Under pressure, the single-layer exhibits orbital-selective physics
closing the gap allowing charge flow into the trilayer block. This change in
effective doping of the trilayer block is likely linked to the higher T$_c$
obtained in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-1313 ($\sim$ 80 K) when compared to the nominal
trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ ($\sim$ 30 K). We conclude that
correlation-driven layer differentiation is crucial in the
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-1313 polymorph and that its low-energy physics aligns closely
with the trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ (rather than the conventional bilayer
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$), in spite of the apparent differences in nominal filling.

<h3>Investigation of ideal shear strength of dilute binary and ternary  Ni-based alloys using first-principles calculations, CALPHAD modeling and  correlation analysis</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19098" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19098</a>
<br>
</p><i>Shuang Lin, Shun-Li Shang, John D. Shimanek, Yi Wang, Allison M. Beese, Zi-Kui Liu</i>
<p>In the present work, the ideal shear strength (Tis) of dilute Ni34XZ ternary
alloys (X or Z = Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Mo, Nb, Si, Ti) are predicted by
first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) in terms
of pure alias shear deformations. The results show that within the
concentration up to 8.3% of the alloying elements, Tis increases with
composition in binary systems with Mn, Fe, Co in ascending order, and decreases
with composition with Nb, Si, Mo, Ti, Al, Cr in descending order. Combined with
Ni34XZ in the present work and Ni11X in the literature from DFT-based
calculations, the composition dependence of Tis in binary and ternary systems
is modeled using the CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) approach
considering lattice instability, indicating that atomic bonding strength
significantly influences Tis. Furthermore, correlational analyses show that
Burgers vector and elastic constant C11 affect Tis the most out of the
elemental features.

<h3>Bilayer graphene in periodic and quasiperiodic magnetic superlattices</h3>

<br>
</p><i>David J. Fernández C., O. Pavón-Torres</i>
<p>Starting from the effective Hamiltonian arising from the tight binding model,
we study the behaviour of low-lying excitations for bilayer graphene placed in
periodic external magnetic fields by using irreducible second order
supersymmetry transformations. The coupled system of equations describing these
excitations is reduced to a pair of periodic Schr\"odinger Hamiltonians
intertwined by a second order differential operator. The direct implementation
of more general second-order supersymmetry transformations allows to create
nonsingular Schr\"odinger potentials with periodicity defects and bound states
embedded in the forbidden bands, which turn out to be associated to
quasiperiodic magnetic superlattices.

<h3>Strong Damping-Like Torques in Wafer-Scale MoTe${}_2$ Grown by MOCVD</h3>

</p><i>Stasiu Thomas Chyczewski, Hanwool Lee, Shuchen Li, Marwan Eladl, Jun-Fei Zheng, Axel Hoffmann, Wenjuan Zhu</i>
<p>The scalable synthesis of strong spin orbit coupling (SOC) materials such as
1T${}^\prime$ phase MoTe${}_2$ is crucial for spintronics development. Here, we
demonstrate wafer-scale growth of 1T${}^\prime$ MoTe${}_2$ using metal-organic
chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) with sputtered Mo and
(C${}_4$H${}_9$)${}_2$Te. The synthesized films show uniform coverage across
the entire sample surface. By adjusting the growth parameters, a synthesis
process capable of producing 1T${}^\prime$ and 2H MoTe${}_2$ mixed phase films
was achieved. Notably, the developed process is compatible with
back-end-of-line (BEOL) applications. The strong spin-orbit coupling of the
grown 1T${}^\prime$ MoTe${}_2$ films was demonstrated through spin torque
ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurements conducted on a 1T${}^\prime$
MoTe${}_2$/permalloy bilayer RF waveguide. These measurements revealed a
significant damping-like torque in the wafer-scale 1T${}^\prime$ MoTe${}_2$
film and indicated high spin-charge conversion efficiency. The BEOL compatible
process and potent spin orbit torque demonstrate promise in advanced device
applications.

<h3>Thermoelectric transport properties of the quasi-one-dimensional  dimer-Mott insulator $β'$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$ICl$_2$</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19137" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19137</a>
<br>
</p><i>Kyohei Eguchi, Takeru Ito, Yoshiki J. Sato, Ryuji Okazaki, Hiromi Taniguchi</i>
<p>Low-dimensional materials, in which the electronic and transport properties
are drastically modified in comparison to those of three-dimensional bulk
materials, yield a key class of thermoelectric materials with high conversion
efficiency. Among such materials, the organic compounds may serve peculiar
properties owing to their unique molecular-based low-dimensional structures
with highly anisotropic molecular orbitals. Here we present the thermoelectric
transport properties of the quasi-one-dimensional dimer-Mott insulator
$\beta'$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$ICl$_2$, where BEDT-TTF stands for
bis(ethylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene. We find that the thermopower exhibits
typical activation-type temperature variation expected for insulators but its
absolute value is anomalously large compared to the expected value from the
activation-type temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity.
Successively, the Jonker-plot analysis, in which the thermopower is usually
scaled by the logarithm of the resistivity, shows an unusual relation among
such transport quantities. We discuss a role of the low dimensionality for the
enhanced thermopower along with recent observations of such a large thermopower
in several low-dimensional materials.

<h3>Symmetry Strategy for Rapid Discovery of Abundant Fractional Quantum  Ferroelectrics</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19152" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19152</a>
<br>
</p><i>Guoliang Yu, Junyi Ji, Changsong Xu, H. J. Xiang</i>
<p>Traditional ferroelectrics are limited by Neumann's principle, which confines
exploration of ferroelectrics within polar point groups. Our recent work [Nat.
Commun. 15, 135, (2024)] proposes the concept of fractional quantum
ferroelectricity (FQFE) that extend the playground of ferroelectricity to
non-polar point groups. Here, we apply group theory and introduce an efficient
symmetry strategy to identify FQFE candidates. Integrated with a
high-throughput screening scheme, we go through 171,527 materials and identify
202 potential FQFE candidates, which are already experimentally synthesized. In
addition, we point out that the essence of FQFE is fractional atomic
displacements with respect to lattice vectors, which can actually result in
both fractional (type-I) and integer (type-II) quantized polarization,
respectively. Through performing first-principles calculations, we verify the
symmetry-predicted switchable FQFE properties in bulk AlAgS2 and monolayer
HgI2. Notably, AlAgS2 exhibits an ultra-low switching barrier of 23 meV/f.u.
and interlocked in-plane/out-of-plane polarization, while HgI2 demonstrates
large spontaneous polarization of 42 {\mu}C/cm2. Our findings not only advance
the understanding on FQFE, but also offer guidance for experimental exploration
and design of novel ferroelectric materials.

<h3>Room temperature realization of artificial chiral magnets with  reprogrammable magnon nonreciprocity at zero field</h3>

</p><i>Mingran Xu, Axel J. M. Deenen, Huixin Guo, Dirk Grundler</i>
<p>Chiral magnets are materials which possess unique helical arrangements of
magnetic moments, which give rise to nonreciprocal transport and fascinating
physics phenomena. On the one hand, their exploration is guided by the
prospects of unconventional signal processing, computation schemes and magnetic
memory. On the other hand, progress in applications is hindered by the
challenging materials synthesis, limited scalability and typically low critical
temperature. Here, we report the creation and exploration of artificial chiral
magnets (ACMs) at room temperature. By employing a mass production compatible
deposition technology, we synthesize ACMs, which consist of helical Ni surfaces
on central cylinders. Using optical microscopy, we reveal nonreciprocal magnon
transport at GHz frequencies. It is controlled by programmable toroidal moments
which result from the ACM's geometrical handedness and field-dependent spin
chirality. We present materials-by-design rules which optimize the helically
curved ferromagnets for 3D nonreciprocal transport at room temperature and zero
magnetic field.

<p>Silicon is a key semiconducting material for electrical devices and hybrid
quantum systems where low temperatures and zero-spin isotopic purity can
enhance quantum coherence. Electrical conductivity in Si is characterised by
carrier freeze out at around 40 K allowing microwave transmission which is a
key component for addressing spins efficiently in silicon quantum technologies.
In this work, we report an additional sharp transition of the electrical
conductivity in a Si-28 cylindrical cavity at around 1 Kelvin. This is observed
by measuring microwave resonator Whispering Gallery Mode frequencies and Q
factors with changing temperature and comparing these results with finite
element models. We attribute this change to a transition from a relaxation
mechanism-dominated to a resonant phonon-less absorption-dominated hopping
conduction regime. Characterising this regime change represents a deeper
understanding of a physical phenomenon in a material of high interest to the
quantum technology and semiconductor device community and the impact of these
results is discussed.

<p>The formation of plasmons through the collective excitation of charge density
has generated intense discussions, offering insights to fundamental sciences
and potential applications. While the underlying physical principles have been
well-established, the effects of multibody interactions and orbital
hybridization on plasmonic dynamics remain understudied. In this work, we
present the observation of conventional metallic and correlated plasmons in
epitaxial La1-xSrxNiO3 (LSNO) films with varying Sr doping concentrations (x =
0, 0.125, 0.25), unveiling their intriguing evolution. Unlike samples at other
doping concentrations, the x = 0.125 intermediate doping sample does not
exhibit the correlated plasmons despite showing high optical conductivity.
Through experimental investigation using spectroscopic ellipsometry and X-ray
absorption spectroscopy, that is further supported by theoretical calculations,
the O2p-Ni3d orbital hybridization for x = 0.125 is found to be significantly
enhanced, alongside a considerable weakening of its effective correlation U*.
These factors account for the absence of correlated plasmons and the high
optical conductivity observed in LSNO (0.125). Our findings highlight the
significant impact of orbital hybridization on the electronic structures and
the formation of quasiparticles in strongly correlated systems, thereby marking
a notable advancement in plasmonics, emphasizing LSNO's compelling potential as
a substitute material in optoelectronic devices.

<p>We theoretically propose chiral magnon in ferromagnetic chiral crystals. We
show that the crystal chirality is imprinted in orbital angular momentum of
magnons which exhibits the opposite signs for opposite chiralities of the

</p><i>Zehuan Tang, Yuanwen Gao</i>
<p>Based on the Maxwell-Beatty reciprocity theorem, static non-reciprocity has
been realized by using nonlinearity, but this non-reciprocity has strict
restrictions on input amplitude and structure size(number of units). Here, we
design a robotic metamaterial with two components of displacement and rotation,
which uses active control to add external forces on the units to break
reciprocity at the level of the interactions between the units. We show
analytically and simulatively that breaking reciprocity at the level of the
interactions directly leads to a strong asymmetric response of displacement in
a static system, this displacement-specific characteristic not only has no
restrictions on size, input amplitude, and suitable geometric asymmetry, but
also can be transferred to rotation by coupling under large deformation. After
the evolution from statics to dynamics, asymmetric transmission and
unidirectional amplification of vector solitons are both implemented in this
system. Our research uncovers the evolution of static non-reciprocity to
dynamic non-reciprocity while building a bridge between non-reciprocity physics
and soliton science.

<h3>Origin of Superconductivity in Rhombohedral Trilayer Graphene:  Quasiparticle Pairing within the Inter-Valley Coherent Phase</h3>

<p>Superconductivity (SC) is observed in rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG)
with an extremely low charge carrier densities, between the normal metal state
and a probable inter-valley coherent (IVC) state. The measured coherence length
in RTG is roughly two orders of magnitude shorter than the value predicted by a
conventional BCS theory. To resolve these discrepancies, we propose that the
RTG SC phase arises from the pairing of quasiparticles within the IVC phase. We
illustrate the SC behavior using gapped Dirac cones with the chemical potential
close to the conduction band's bottom and establish the Ginzburg-Landau theory.
Our findings indicate that the mean-field transition temperature,
$T_\mathrm{MF}$, is primarily determined by the density of states of
quasiparticles within the IVC phase, and is more suppressed in comparison with
the BCS relation. Interestingly, we discover that the coherence length behaves
according to $\xi\sim 1/\sqrt{T_\mathrm{MF}}$. When the chemical potential lies
within the band gap, the conventional coherence length becomes small, while the
quantum metric contribution can diverge. Applying our approach to a microscopic
model for RTG, our predictions align well with experimental data and
effectively capture key measurable features of quantities such as the
mean-field transition temperature $T_\mathrm{MF}$ and the coherence length
$\xi$. Furthermore, we reveal that the quantum metric contribution, stemming
from the multi-band properties of the IVC quasiparticles, plays a significant
role in determining the coherence length around the transition regime from
superconductivity to IVC. Lastly, experimental predictions are discussed on
bebaviors of the upper critical field and coherence length at low temperatures.

<h3>Length and torsion dependence of thermal conductivity in twisted  graphene nanoribbons</h3>

<p>Research on the physical properties of materials at the nanoscale is crucial
for the development of breakthrough nanotechnologies. One of the key properties
to consider is the ability to conduct heat, i.e., its thermal conductivity.
Graphene is a remarkable nanostructure with exceptional physical properties,
including one of the highest thermal conductivities (TC) ever measured.
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) share most fundamental properties with graphene,
with the added benefit of having a controllable electronic bandgap. One method
to achieve such control is by twisting the GNR, which can tailor its electronic
properties, as well as change their TC. Here, we revisit the dependence of the
TC of twisted GNRs (TGNRs) on the number of applied turns to the GNR by
calculating more precise and mathematically well defined geometric parameters
related to the TGNR shape, namely, its twist and writhe. We show that the
dependence of the TC on twist is not a simple function of the number of turns
initially applied to a straight GNR. In fact, we show that the TC of TGNRs
requires at least two parameters to be properly described. Our conclusions are
supported by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to obtain the TC of
suspended TGNRs prepared under different values of initially applied turns and
different sizes of their suspended part. Among possible choices of parameter
pairs, we show that TC can be appropriately described by the initial number of
turns and the initial twist density of the TGNRs.

<p>A remarkable feature of topological superconductors is the emergence of
Majorana fermions in electron systems. Whereas the emergent Majorana fermions
share the self-anti-particle property with Majorana fermions in particle
physics, they may have essentially different electromagnetic properties. In
this paper, we argue the electromagnetic response of spinful Majorana fermions
in topological superconductors. We present a general theory of the
electromagnetic response of spinful Majorana fermions in topological
superconductors and clarify how the pairing symmetry is encoded in the
electromagnetic response. As an application, we predict the
sublattice-dependent dipole (Ising)-type magnetic response of corner Majorana
fermions in iron-based superconductors.

<h3>Structure and dynamics of amphiphilic patchy cubes in a nanoslit under  shear</h3>

<p>Patchy nanocubes are intriguing materials with simple shapes and
space-filling and multidirectional bonding properties. Previous studies have
revealed various mesoscopic structures such as colloidal crystals in the solid
regime and rod-like or fractal-like aggregates in the liquid regime of the
phase diagram. Recent studies have also shown that mesoscopic structural
properties, such as average cluster size $\left\langle M \right\rangle$ and
orientational order, in amphiphilic nanocube suspensions are associated with
macroscopic viscosity changes, mainly owing to differences in cluster shape
among patch arrangements. Although many studies have been conducted on the
self-assembled structures of nanocubes in bulk, little is known about their
self-assembly in nanoscale spaces or structural changes under shear. In this
study, we investigated mixtures of one- and two-patch amphiphilic nanocubes
confined in two flat parallel plates at rest and under shear using molecular
dynamics simulations coupled with multiparticle collision dynamics. We
considered two different patch arrangements for the two-patch particles and two
different slit widths $H$ to determine the degree of confinement in
constant-volume fractions in the liquid regime of the phase diagram. We
revealed two unique cluster morphologies that have not been previously observed
under bulk conditions. At rest, the size of the rod-like aggregates increased
with decreasing $H$, whereas that of the fractal-like aggregates remained
constant. Under weak shear with strong confinement, the rod-like aggregates
maintained a larger $\left\langle M \right\rangle$ than the fractal-like
aggregates, which were more rigid and maintained a larger $\left\langle M
\right\rangle$ than the rod-like aggregates under bulk conditions.

<h3>Statistical Mechanics Calculations Using Variational Autoregressive  Networks and Quantum Annealing</h3>

</p><i>Yuta Tamura, Masayuki Ohzeki</i>
<p>In statistical mechanics, computing the partition function is generally
difficult. An approximation method using a variational autoregressive network
(VAN) has been proposed recently. This approach offers the advantage of
directly calculating the generation probabilities while obtaining a
significantly large number of samples. The present study introduces a novel
approximation method that employs samples derived from quantum annealing
machines in conjunction with VAN, which are empirically assumed to adhere to
the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution. When applied to the finite-size
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, the proposed method demonstrates enhanced
accuracy compared to the traditional VAN approach and other approximate
methods, such as the widely utilized naive mean field.

<p>Trigonal PtBi$_2$ is one of the attractive van-der-Waals materials because of
the enhancement of its superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm{c}}$ by
doping chalcogen elements such as Se and Te. Recently, it has been reported
that $T_{\rm{c}}$ of Pt(Bi$_{1-x}$Se$_x$)$_2$ is enhanced by a factor of 4,
compared to the pristine PtBi$_2$, together with the polar-nonpolar structural
phase transition. Thus, it is desirable to study electrical transport
properties for this new superconducting compound. Here, we have performed
magnetotransport measurements for Pt(Bi$_{1-x}$Se$_x$)$_2$ ($x$ = 0.06 and
0.08) thin-film devices and have observed a peculiar magnetoresistance where a
finite hysteresis appears when the superconducting state is broken. By
measuring the magnetoresistance systematically, we have attributed this
magnetoresistance to the two-level critical-state where fluxons pinned in
Pt(Bi$_{1-x}$Se$_x$)$_2$ play an important role.

<p>We study the problem of two harmonically trapped atoms in the presence of
spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling. The two-body energy spectrum is
numerically calculated by utilizing the exact diagonalization method. We
analyze how the degeneracy of energy levels is lifted under the interplay
between the interatomic interaction and spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling.
The exact numerical results show an excellent agreement with that of
perturbation theory in the weak-interaction limit, as well as that in the
absence of spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling. The properties of
correlations between the two atoms are also discussed with respect to the
interaction strength. The findings in this work may provide valuable insights
into few-body physics subjected to spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling, and
the possible experimental detection of spectrum functions in many-body systems,
such as radio-frequency spectroscopy.

<p>The collisional dynamics of two symmetric droplets with equal intraspecies
scattering lengths and particle number density for each component is studied by
solving the corresponding extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation in two dimensions
by including a logarithmic correction term in the usual contact interaction. We
find the merging droplet after collision experiences a quadrupole oscillation
in its shape and the oscillation period is found to be independent of the
incidental momentum for small droplets. With increasing collision momentum the
colliding droplets may separate into two, or even more, and finally into small
pieces of droplets. For these dynamical phases, we manage to present boundaries
determined by the remnant particle number in the central area and the damped
oscillation of the quadrupole mode. A stability peak for the existence of
droplets emerges at the critical particle number $N_c \simeq 48$ for the
quasi-Gaussian and flat-top shapes of the droplets.

<p>The performance of permanent magnets is intricately tied to their magnetic
hysteresis loop. In this study, we investigate the heavy-fermion ferromagnet
CeAgSb$_2$ through magnetization measurements under uniaxial stress. We observe
a 2400 % increase in magnetic coercivity with just a modest stress of
approximately 1 kbar. This effect persists even after pressure release,
attributable to stress-induced defects that efficiently pin domain walls. Other
magnetic properties such as ordering temperature and saturation moment exhibit
only weak pressure dependencies and display full reversibility. Our findings
offer a promising route for increasing coercive field strength and enhancing
the energy product in ferromagnetic materials and are potentially applicable to
a broad spectrum of commercial or emerging magnetic applications.

<h3>Observation of strain-rate softening behavior in jammed granular media</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Mingchao Liu, Weining Mao, Yiqiu Zhao, Qin Xu, Yixiang Gan, Yifan Wang, K Jimmy Hsia</i>
<p>The strain-rate sensitivity of confined granular materials has been widely
explored, with most findings exhibiting rate-strengthening behaviors. This
study, however, reveals a distinct rate-softening behavior across a certain
strain rate range based on triaxial tests on particle clusters of various
materials with different surface properties, particle sizes, shapes, and
stiffness. This softening effect is especially pronounced in the case of common
rice particles. By examining the behavior of rice particles under different
confining pressure and surface conditions, and directly measuring the
frictional coefficient across various loading rates, we find that the reduction
in surface frictional coefficient with the increasing strain rate predominantly
contributes to this rate-softening behavior. This conclusion is validated by
results from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. Additionally, we identify
confining pressure as a critical factor regulating the normal stress between
particles, and thereby enhancing frictional behavior. Rheometer tests reveal
that the shear modulus exhibits a similar rate-softening trend. This study of
rate-softening behavior in granular materials enhances our understanding of the
mechanisms during their deformation under confining pressure. It also suggests
that local inter-particle tribology significantly impacts overall granular
behavior.

</p><i>Matteo Furci, Giovanni Marini, Matteo Calandra</i>
<p>Photoexcited GeTe undergoes a non-thermal phase transition from a
rhombohedral to a rocksalt crystalline phase. The microscopic mechanism and the
nature of the transition are unclear. By using constrained density functional
perturbation theory and by accounting for quantum anharmonicity within the
stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation, we show that the non-thermal
phase transition is strongly first order and does not involve phonon softening,
at odd with the thermal one. The transition is driven by the closure of the
single particle gap in the photoexcited rhombohedral phase. Finally, we show
that ultrafast X-ray diffraction data are consistent with a coexistence of the
two phases, as expected in a first order transition. Our results are relevant
for the understanding of phase transitions and bonding in phase change
materials.

<p>Transition-metal compounds represent a fascinating playground for exploring
the intricate relationship between structural distortions, electronic
properties, and magnetic behaviour, holding significant promise for
technological advancements. Among these compounds, YBaCo$_4$O$_{7}$ (Y114) is
attractive due to its manifestation of a ferrimagnetic component at low
temperature intertwined with distortion effect due to the charge
disproportionation on Co ions, exerting profound impact on its magnetic
properties. In this perspective paper, we study the structural and magnetic
intricacies of the Y114 crystal. Traditionally, the investigation of such
materials has relied heavily on computational modelling using
density-functional theory (DFT) with the on-site Coulomb interaction correction
$U$ (DFT+$U$) based on the Hubbard model (sometimes including Hund's exchange
coupling parameter $J$, DFT+$U$+$J$) to unravel their complexities. Herein, we
analysed the spurious effects of magnetic-moment delocalisation and spillover
to non-magnetic ions in the lattice on electronic structure and magnetic
properties of Y114. To overcome this problem we have applied constrained DFT
(cDFT) based on the potential self-consistency approach, and comprehensively
explore the Y114 crystal's characteristics in its ferrimagnetic order. We find
that cDFT yields magnetic moments of Co ions much closer to the experimental
values than LDA+$U$+$J$ with the parameters $U$ and $J$ fitted to reproduce
experimental lattice constants. cDFT allows for an accurate prediction of
magnetic properties using oxidation states of magnetic ions as well-defined
parameters. Through this perspective, we not only enhance our understanding of
the magnetic interactions in Y114 crystal, but also pave the way for future
investigations into magnetic materials.

<p>An emerging paradigm in modern electronics is that of CMOS + $\sf X$
requiring the integration of standard CMOS technology with novel materials and
technologies denoted by $\sf X$. In this context, a crucial challenge is to
develop accurate circuit models for $\sf X$ that are compatible with standard
models for CMOS-based circuits and systems. In this perspective we present
physics-based, experimentally benchmarked modular circuit models that can be
used to evaluate a class of CMOS + $\sf X$ systems, where $\sf X$ denotes
magnetic and spintronic materials and phenomena. This class of materials is
particularly challenging because they go beyond conventional charge-based
phenomena and involve the spin degree of freedom which involves non-trivial
quantum effects. Starting from density matrices $-$ the central quantity in
quantum transport $-$ using well-defined approximations, it is possible to
obtain spin-circuits that generalize ordinary circuit theory to 4-component
currents and voltages (1 for charge and 3 for spin). With step-by-step examples
that progressively go higher in the computing stack, we illustrate how the
spin-circuit approach can be used to start from the physics of magnetism and
spintronics to enable accurate system-level evaluations. We believe the core
approach can be extended to include other quantum degrees of freedom like
valley and pseudospins starting from corresponding density matrices.

<p>The thermal quasiparticles in a clean type-II superconductor with line nodes
give rise to a quadratic low-temperature change of the penetration depth,
$\Delta \lambda \sim T^2$, as first shown by Kosztin and Leggett [I. Kosztin
and A. J. Leggett, Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 135 (1997)]. Here, we generalize this
result to multiple nodes and compare it to numerically exact evaluations of the
temperature-dependent penetration depth in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ using a high-precision
tight-binding model. We compare the calculations to recent penetration depth
measurements in high purity single crystals of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ [J. F. Landaeta et
al., arXiv:2312.05129]. When assuming the order parameter to have
$\mathrm{B}_{1\mathrm{g}}$ symmetry, we find that both a simple
$d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave and complicated gap structures with contributions from
higher harmonics and accidental nodes can accommodate the experimental data.

<p>We explore the possibility to perform an in situ transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) thermoelectric characterization of materials. A differential
heating element on a custom in situ TEM microchip allows to generate a
temperature gradient across the studied materials, which are simultaneously
measured electrically. A thermovoltage was induced in all studied devices,
whose sign corresponds to the sign of the Seebeck coefficient of the tested
materials. The results indicate that in situ thermoelectric TEM studies can
help to profoundly understand the interplay between the thermoelectric
properties on one side and the structure/composition of the materials down to
the atomic level on the other side, including grain boundaries, dopants or
crystal defects. We propose an improved in situ TEM microchip design, which
should facilitate a full quantitative measurement of the induced temperature
gradient, the electrical and thermal conductivities, as well as the Seebeck
coefficient.

<p>Ferrotoroidicity, the fourth form of primary ferroic order, breaks both space
and time inversion symmetry. So far, direct observation of ferrotoroidicity in
natural materials remains elusive, which impedes the exploration of
ferrotoroidic phase transitions. Here, we overcome the limitations of natural
materials using an artificial nanomagnet system that can be characterized at
the constituent level and at different effective temperatures. We design a
nanomagnet array as to realize a direct-kagome spin ice. This artificial spin
ice exhibits robust toroidal moments and a quasi-degenerate ground state with
two distinct low-temperature toroidal phases: ferrotoroidicity and
paratoroidicity. Using magnetic force microscopy and Monte Carlo simulation, we
demonstrate a phase transition between ferrotoroidicity and paratoroidicity,
along with a crossover to a non-toroidal paramagnetic phase. Our
quasi-degenerate artificial spin ice in a direct-kagome structure provides a
model system for the investigation of magnetic states and phase transitions
that are inaccessible in natural materials.

<p>Thermal transistors that electrically switch heat flow on and off have
attracted attention as thermal management devices. Electrochemical
reduction/oxidation switches the thermal conductivity (\k{appa}) of active
metal oxide layers. The \k{appa}-switching width (difference between on-state
and off-state \k{appa}) of the previously proposed electrochemical thermal
transistors is narrow, less than 5 W/mK. Here, we show solid-state
electrochemical thermal transistors with a wide \k{appa}-switching width of 9.5
W/mK. We used CeO2 thin film as the active layer directly deposited on a solid
electrolyte YSZ substrate. A Pt thin film was deposited on the surface of the
CeO2 thin film and the back surface of the YSZ substrate to create a
solid-state electrochemical thermal transistor. When the CeO2 thin film was
once reduced (off-state) and then oxidized (on-state), the \k{appa} was
approximately 2.5 W/mK in its most reduced state, and \k{appa} increased with
oxidation to 11.8 W/mK (on-state). This reduction (off-state)/oxidation
(on-state) cycle was repeated five times and the average value of \k{appa} was
2.5 W/mK after reduction (off-state) and 12 W/mK after oxidation (on-state).
The \k{appa}-switching width was 9.5 W/mK. The CeO2-based solid-state
electrochemical thermal transistors are potential materials for thermal

<p>Atomically precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have a wide range of
electronic properties that depend sensitively on their chemical structure.
Several types of GNRs have been synthesized on metal surfaces through selective
surface-catalyzed reactions. The resulting GNRs are adsorbed on the metal
surface, which may lead to hybridization between the GNR orbitals and those of
the substrate. This makes investigation of the intrinsic electronic properties
of GNRs more difficult, and also rules out capacitive gating. Here we
demonstrate the formation of a dielectric gold chloride adlayer that can
intercalate underneath GNRs on the Au(111) surface. The intercalated gold
chloride adlayer electronically decouples the GNRs from the metal and leads to
a substantial hole doping of the GNRs. Our results introduce an easily
accessible tool in the in situ characterization of GNRs grown on Au(111) that

<p>We study rare events in the extreme value statistics of stochastic symmetric
jump processes with power tails in the distributions of the jumps, using the
big jump principle. The principle states that in the presence of stochastic
processes with power tails statistics, if at a certain time a physical quantity
takes on a value much larger than its typical value, this large fluctuation is
realised through a single macroscopic jump that exceeds the typical scale of
the process by several orders of magnitude. In particular, our estimation
focuses on the asymptotic behaviour of the tail of the probability distribution
of maxima, a fundamental quantity in a wide class of stochastic models used in
chemistry to estimate reaction thresholds, in climatology for earthquake risk
assessment, in finance for portfolio management, and in ecology for the
collective behaviour of species. We determine the analytical form of the
probability distribution of rare events in the extreme value statistics of
three L\'evy processes; L\'evy flights, L\'evy walks and the L\'evy-Lorentz
gas. For the L\'evy flights, we re-obtain through the big jump approach recent
analytical results, extending their validity. For the L\'evy-Lorentz gas we
show that the topology of the disordered lattice along which the walker moves
induces memory effects in its dynamics, which influences the extreme value
statistics. Our results are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations.

<p>Heterostructures from complex oxides allow one to combine various electronic
and magnetic orders as to induce new quantum states. A prominent example is the
coupling between superconducting and magnetic orders in multilayers from
high-Tc cuprates and manganites. A key role is played here by the interfacial
CuO2 layer whose distinct properties remain to be fully understood. Here, we
study with resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) the magnon excitations of
this interfacial CuO2 layer. In particular, we show that the underlying
antiferromagnetic exchange interaction at the interface is strongly suppressed
to J ~ 70 meV, as compared to J ~ 130 meV for the CuO2 layers away from the
interface. Moreover, we observe an anomalous momentum dependence of the
intensity of the interfacial magnon mode and show that it suggests that the
antiferromagnetic order is accompanied by a particular kind of orbital order
that yields a so-called altermagnetic state. Such a two-dimensional altermagnet
has recently been predicted to enable new spintronic applications and
superconducting proximity effects.

<p>The chiral anomaly, a hallmark of chiral spin-1/2 Weyl fermions, is an
imbalance between left- and right-moving particles that underpins both high and
low energy phenomena, including particle decay and negative longitudinal
magnetoresistance in Weyl semimetals. The discovery that chiral crystals can
host higher-spin generalizations of Weyl quasiparticles without high-energy
counterparts, known as multifold fermions, raises the fundamental question of
whether the chiral anomaly is a more general phenomenon. Answering this
question requires materials with chiral quasiparticles within a sizable energy
window around the Fermi level, that are unaffected by trivial extrinsic effects
such as current jetting. Here we report the chiral anomaly of multifold
fermions in CoSi, which features multifold bands within about 0.85 eV around
the Fermi level. By excluding current jetting through the squeezing test, we
measure an intrinsic, longitudinal negative magnetoresistance. We develop the
semiclassical theory of magnetotransport of multifold fermions that shows that
the negative magnetoresistance originates in their chiral anomaly, despite a
sizable and detrimental orbital magnetic moment contribution, previously
unaccounted for. A concomitant nonlinear Hall effect supports the
multifold-fermion origin of magnetotransport. Our work confirms the chiral
anomaly of higher-spin generalizations of Weyl fermions, currently inaccessible
outside the solid-state.

<p>Vapor deposition, known for precise structural control, is inevitably
influenced by impurities. These impurities, often distinct from the depositing
material, can significantly impact material properties, including local
structure. Interestingly, the effect of immobilizing some of the depositing
particles themselves, which would still preserve local structural symmetry,
remains largely unexplored. By introducing a small fraction of pinned sites
during colloidal vapor deposition and employing a combination of thermodynamic
and kinematic measurements, we demonstrate that pinned sites, termed "mobility
impurities", are disfavored as nucleation centers. Moreover, tuning the
mobility of mobile colloids can adjust the likelihood of nucleation. In later
stages of growth, pinning induces mode localization, altering the thin film's
vibrational spectrum. Our research underscores the potential of strategically
incorporating mobility impurities to engineer material properties.

</p><i>Elena Rufeil Fiori, Christian Maes</i>
<p>We define the heat capacity for steady periodically driven systems and as an
example we compute it for dissipative two-level systems where the energy gap is
time-modulated. There, as a function of ambient temperature, the Schottky peak
remains the dominant feature. Yet, in contrast with equilibrium, the
quasistatic thermal response of a nonequilibrium system also reveals kinetic
information present in the transition rates; e.g., the heat capacity depends on
the time-symmetric reactivities and changes by the presence of a kinetic
barrier. It still vanishes though at absolute zero, in accord with an extended
Nernst heat postulate, but at a different rate from the equilibrium case. More
generally, we discuss the dependence on driving frequency and amplitude.

<h3>Fine-tuning the Microstructure and Photophysical Characteristics of  Fluorescent Conjugated Copolymers Using Photoalignment and Liquid-crystalline  Ordering</h3>

</p><i>Yuping Shi, Katharina Landfester, Stephen M. Morris</i>
<p>Replicating the microstructure and near-unity excitation energy transfer
efficiency in natural light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) remains a major
challenge for synthetic energy-harvesting devices. Biological photosynthesis
can spontaneously regulate the active ensembles of involved energy absorbing
and funnelling chlorophyll-containing proteins in response to fluctuating
sunlight. Here we utilize liquid crystalline (LC) ordering to fine-tune the
polymer packing and photophysical properties in liquid crystalline conjugated
polymer (LCCP) films for LHC biomimicry and optimizing photoluminescence
quantum efficiency (PLQE). We show that the long-range orientational ordering
present in a LC phase of poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT)
stabilizes a small fraction of randomly-oriented F8BT nanocrystals dispersed in
an amorphous matrix of disordered F8BT chains, hence resembling a self-doped
host-guest system whereby excitation energy funnelling and PLQE are reinforced
significantly by three-dimensional donor-to-acceptor Forster resonance energy
transfer (FRET) and dominant intrachain emission in the nano-crystalline
acceptor. Furthermore, the photoalignment of nematic F8BT layers is combined to
fabricate long-sought large-area-extended monodomains which exhibit >60%
crystallinity and ~20 nm-long interchain packing order, whilst also promoting
linearly polarized emission, a new band-edge absorption species, and an extra
emissive interchain excited state. Our micro-PL spectral results support the
feasibility of making use of self-doped F8BT nematic films for bio-mimicry of
certain structural basis and light-harvesting properties of naturally occurring
LHCs.

<h3>Negative transit time in non-tunneling electron transmission through  graphene multilayers</h3>

<br>
</p><i>E. E. Krasovskii, R.O. Kuzian</i>
<p>Attosecond dynamics of electron transmission through atomically-thin
crystalline films is studied with an {\em ab initio} scattering theory. The
temporal character of the electron propagation through graphene multilayers is
traced to the band structure of bulk graphite: In the forbidden gaps the wave
packet transit time $\tau_\mathrm{T}$ saturates with thickness and in the
allowed bands $\tau_\mathrm{T}$ oscillates following transmission resonances.
Hitherto unknown negative transit time due to in-plane scattering is discovered
in monolayers of graphene, h-BN, and oxygen. Moreover, Wigner time delay is
found to diverge at the scattering resonances caused by the emergence of
secondary diffracted beams. This offers a way to manipulate the propagation
timing of the wave packet without sacrificing the transmitted intensity. The
spatial reshaping of the wave packet at the resonances may help elucidate
details of the streaking by an inhomogeneous field at the surface.

<h3>Novel Topological Insulators with Hybrid-order Boundary States</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19469" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19469</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yan-Qing Zhu, Zhen Zheng, Giandomenico Palumbo, Z. D. Wang</i>
<p>We report the discovery of several classes of novel topological insulators
(TIs) with hybrid-order boundary states generated from the first-order TIs with
additional crystalline symmetries. Unlike the current studies on hybrid-order
TIs where different-order topology arises from merging different-order TIs in
various energy, these novel TIs exhibit a remarkable coexsitence of first-order
gapless modes and higher-order Fermi-arc states, behaving as a hybrid between
the first-order TIs and higher-order topological semimetals within a single
bulk gap. Our findings establish a profound connection between these novel
$d$-dimensional ($d$D) TIs and ($d-1$)D higher-order TIs (HOTIs), which can be
understood as a result of stacking $(d-1)$D HOTIs to $d$D with $d=3,4$,
revealing unconventional topological phase transitions by closing the gap in
certain first-order boundaries rather than the bulk. The bulk-boundary
correspondence between these higher-order Fermi-arcs and bulk topological
invariants acossiated with additional crystallline symmetries is also
demonstrated. We then discuss the conventional topological phase transitions
from these novel TIs to nodal-line/nodal-surface semimetal phases, where the
gapless phases host new kinds of topological responses. Meawhile, we present
the corresponding topological semimetal phases by stacking these unique TIs.
Finally, we discuss potential ways to realize these novel phases in synthetic
and real materials, with a particular focus on the feasible implementation in
optical lattices using ultracold atoms.

<p>Perturbing the arrangements of pegs on a static Galton board can result in
non-trivial stationary distributions, which in the continuum limit correspond
to departure from regular gaussian behavior. Two such distributions are
obtained. Further, the distributions generated for a dynamic galton board under
external forcing in a general direction are obtained by solution of the
corresponding stochastic differential equations. Exact cumulant generating
functions for the distribution are presented for forcing in one dimension. An
approximate expression, correct to first order in the forcing amplitude, is
presented for the case of two dimensions. Both cases show nontrivial departures
from the static gaussian solution.

<h3>Dimensional crossover in Kardar-Parisi-Zhang growth</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19516" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19516</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ismael S. S. Carrasco, Tiago J. Oliveira</i>
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) KPZ growth is usually investigated on substrates of
lateral sizes $L_x=L_y$, so that $L_x$ and the correlation length ($\xi$) are
the only relevant lengths determining the scaling behavior. However, in
cylindrical geometry, as well as in flat rectangular substrates $L_x \neq L_y$
and, thus, the surfaces can become correlated in a single direction, when $\xi
\sim L_x \ll L_y$. From extensive simulations of several KPZ models, we
demonstrate that this yields a dimensional crossover in their dynamics, with
the roughness scaling as $W \sim t^{\beta_{\text{2D}}}$ for $t \ll t_c$ and $W
\sim t^{\beta_{\text{1D}}}$ for $t \gg t_c$, where $t_c \sim
L_x^{1/z_{2\text{D}}}$. The height distributions (HDs) also cross over from the
2D flat [cylindrical] HD to the asymptotic Tracy-Widom GOE [GUE] distribution.
Moreover, 2D-to-1D crossovers are found also in the asymptotic growth velocity
and in the steady state regime of flat systems, where a family of universal HDs
exists, interpolating between the 2D and 1D ones as $L_y/L_x$ increases.
Importantly, the crossover scalings are fully determined and indicate a
possible way to solve 2D KPZ models.

<p>Nano-engineering crystalline materials can be used to tailor their thermal
properties. By adding new nanoscale phonon scattering centers and controlling
their size, one can effectively decrease the phonon mean free path and hence
the thermal conductivity of a fully crystalline material. In this letter, we
use the 3$\omega$ method in the temperature range of 100-300 K to
experimentally report on the more than threefold reduction of the thermal
conductivity of an epitaxially-grown crystalline germanium thin film with
embedded polydispersed crystalline \ch{Ge3Mn5} nano-inclusions with diameters
ranging from 5 to 25~nm. A detailed analysis of the structure of the thin film
coupled with Monte Carlo simulations of phonon transport highlight the role of
the nano-inclusions volume fraction in the reduction of the phononic
contribution to the thermal conductivity, in particular its temperature
dependence, leading to a phonon mean free path that is set by geometrical
constraints.

<h3>Formation of Rydberg Crystals Induced by Quantum Melting in  One-Dimension</h3>

</p><i>Zeki Zeybek, Peter Schmelcher, Rick Mukherjee</i>
<p>Quantum fluctuations in frustrated systems can lead to the emergence of
complex many-body phases. However, the role of quantum fluctuations in
frustration-free lattices is less explored and could provide an interesting
avenue for exploring new physics, and perhaps easier to realize compared to
frustrated lattice systems. Using Rydberg atoms with tunable interactions as a
platform, we leverage strong van der Waals interactions and obtain a
constrained model in one dimension with non-local fluctuations given by dipolar
interactions alongside local fluctuations. The combined effect of such
processes leads to intrinsically quantum-ordered Rydberg crystals through the
order-by-disorder mechanism. Finite-size analyses indicate that combined
fluctuations drive the transition from disordered to ordered phases, contrary
to the expected direction. We provide a theoretical description to understand
the physics of order-by-disorder in one-dimensional systems, which are
typically seen only in higher dimensions.

<p>We study the phase transition behavior of the ferroelectric
BaTi$_{0.8}$Zr$_{0.2}$O$_3$ in the paraelectric region. The temperature
dependencies of thermal, polar, elastic and dielectric properties indicate the
presence of local structures above the paraelectric-ferroelectric transition
temperature Tc = 292 K. The non-zero remnant polarization is measured up to a
characteristic temperature T* ~350 K, which coincides with the temperature
where the dielectric constant deviates from Curie-Weiss law. Resonant
Piezoelectric Spectroscopy shows that DC field-cooling above Tc using fields
smaller than the coercive field leads to an elastic response and remnant
piezoelectricity below T*, which likely corresponds to the coherence
temperature associated with polar nanostructures in ferroelectrics. The
observed remnant effect is attributed to the reorientation of polar
nanostructures above Tc.

<p>The minimization of the magnetic field plays a crucial role in ultracold gas
research. For instance, the contact interaction dominates all the other energy
scales in the zero magnetic field limit, giving rise to novel quantum phases of
matter. However, lowering magnetic fields well below the mG level is often
challenging in ultracold gas experiments. In this article, we apply
Landau-Zener spectroscopy to characterize and reduce the magnetic field on an
ultracold gas of sodium atoms to a few tens of {\mu}G. The lowest magnetic
field achieved here opens to observing novel phases of matter with ultracold
spinor Bose gases.

<p>Polymorphism contributes to the diversity of nature, so that even materials
having identical chemical compositions exhibit variations in properties because
of different lattice symmetries. Thus, if stacked together into multilayers,
polymorphs may work as an alternative approach to the sequential deposition of
layers with different chemical compositions. However, selective polymorph
crystallization during conventional thin film synthesis is not trivial; e.g.
opting for step-like changes of temperature and/or pressure correlated with
switching from one polymorph to another during synthesis is tricky, since it
may cause degradation of the structural quality. In the present work, applying
the disorder-induced ordering approach we fabricated such multilayered
polymorph structures using ion beams. We show that during ion irradiation of
gallium oxide, the dynamic annealing of disorder may be tuned towards
self-assembling of several polymorph interfaces, consistently with theoretical
modelling. Specifically, we demonstrated multilayers with two polymorph
interface repetitions obtained in one ion beam assisted fabrication step.
Importantly, single crystal structure of the polymorphs was maintained in
between interfaces exhibiting repeatable crystallographic relationships,
correlating with optical cross-sectional maps. This data paves the way for
enhancing functionalities in materials with not previously thought capabilities
of ion beam technology.

<h3>Topology in a Su--Schrieffer--Heeger plasmonic crystal</h3>

</p><i>D. A. Miranda, Y. V. Bludov, N. Asger Mortensen, N. M. R. Peres</i>
<p>In this paper we study the topology of the bands of a polaritonic crystal
composed of graphene and of a metallic grating. We first derive a
Kronig--Penney type of equation for the polaritonic bands as function of the
Bloch wavevector and discuss the propagation of the surface plasmon polaritons
on the polaritonic crystal using a transfer-matrix approach. Secondly, we
reformulate the problem as a tight-binding model that resembles the
Su--Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) Hamiltonian, one difference being that the hopping
amplitudes are, in this case, energy dependent. In possession of the
tight-binding equations it is a simple task to determine the topology of the
bands. Similarly to the SSH model, we show that there is a tunable parameter
that induces topological phase transitions from trivial to non-trivial. In our
case, it is the distance $d$ between the graphene sheet and the metallic
grating. We note that $d$ is a parameter that can be easily tuned
experimentally simply by controlling the thickness of the spacer between the
grating and the graphene sheet. It is then experimentally feasible to engineer
devices with the required topological properties.

<p>Copper is a good CO2 electroreduction catalyst as products beyond CO form,
but efficiency and selectivity is low. Experiments have shown that admixture of
other elements can help, and computational screening studies have pointed out
various promising candidates based on the adsorption of a single CO molecule as
a descriptor. Our calculations of CO adsorption on surfaces where a first row
transition metal atom replaces a Cu atom show that multiple CO molecules, not
just one, bind to the substitutional atom. For Fe, Co, and Ni atoms, a decrease
in binding energy is found, but the reverse trend, namely increasing bond
strength, is found for V, Cr, and Mn and the first three CO molecules. Magnetic
moment, charge, and position of the substitutional atom are also strongly
affected by the CO adsorption in most cases. Magnetic moment is stepwise
reduced to zero, and the outward displacement of the substitutional atom
increased.

<h3>Boundary effect and quantum phases in spin chains</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Jinhyeok Ryu, Jaeyoon Cho</i>
<p>Boundary effect is a widespread idea in many-body theories. However, it is
more of a conceptual notion than a rigorously defined physical quantity. One
can quantify the boundary effect by comparing two ground states of the same
physical model, which differ only slightly in system size. Here, we analyze the
quantity, which we call a boundary effect function, for an XXZ spin-1/2 model
using density matrix renormalization group calculations. We find that three
quantum phases of the model manifest as different functional forms of the
boundary effect function. As a result, the quantum phase transition of the
model is associated with a nonanalytic change of the boundary effect function.
This work thus provides and concretizes a novel perspective on the relationship
between bulk and boundary properties of ground states.

<h3>Magnetophononics and the Chiral Phonon Misnomer</h3>

</p><i>R. Merlin</i>
<p>The direct, ultrafast excitation of polar phonons with electromagnetic
radiation is a potent strategy for controlling the properties of a wide range
of materials, particularly in the context of influencing their magnetic
behavior. Here, we show that, contrary to common perception, the origin of
phonon-induced magnetic activity does not stem from the motion of ions
themselves; instead, it arises from the effect their motion exerts on the
electron subsystem. Through the mechanism of electron-phonon coupling, a
coherent state of circularly polarized phonons generates substantial
non-Maxwellian fields that disrupt time reversal symmetry, effectively
emulating the behavior of authentic magnetic fields. Notably, the effective
field can reach magnitudes as high as 100 T, surpassing by several orders of
magnitude the Maxwellian field resulting from the circular motion of the ions.
Because the light-induced non-reciprocal fields depend on the square of the
phonon displacements, the chirality the photons transferred to the ions plays
no role in magnetophononics.

<p>Trigonal PtBi$_2$ is a layered semimetal without inversion symmetry,
featuring 12 Weyl points in the vicinity of the Fermi energy. Its topological
Fermi arcs were recently shown to superconduct at low temperatures where bulk
superconductivity is absent. Here, we perform first-principles calculations to
investigate in detail the bulk and surface electronic structure of PtBi$_2$,
and obtain the spin texture as well as the momentum-dependent localization of
the arcs. Motivated by the experimentally observed recovery of inversion
symmetry under pressure or upon doping, we interpolate between the two
structures and determine the energy and momentum dependence of the Weyl nodes.
For deeper insights into the surface superconductivity of PtBi$_2$, we
construct a symmetry-adapted effective four-band model that accurately
reproduces the Weyl points of PtBi$_2$. We supplement this model with an
analysis of the symmetry-allowed pairings between the Fermi arcs, which
naturally mix spin-singlet and spin-triplet channels. Moreover, the presence of
surface-only superconductivity facilitates an intrinsic
superconductor-semimetal-superconductor Josephson junction, with the
semimetallic phase sandwiched between the two superconducting surfaces. For a
phase difference of $\pi$, zero-energy Andreev bound states develop between the
two terminations.

</p><i>Ce Wang, Chao Gao, Jing Zhang, Hui Zhai, Zhe-Yu Shi</i>
<p>The work intends to extend the moir\'e physics to three dimensions.
Three-dimensional moir\'e patterns can be realized in ultracold atomic gases by
coupling two spin states in spin-dependent optical lattices with a relative
twist, a structure currently unachievable in solid-state materials. We give the
commensurate conditions under which the three-dimensional moir\'e pattern
features a periodic structure, termed a three-dimensional moir\'e crystal. We
emphasize a key distinction of three-dimensional moir\'e physics: in three
dimensions, the twist operation generically does not commute with the
rotational symmetry of the original lattice, unlike in two dimensions, where
these two always commute. Consequently, the moir\'e crystal can exhibit a
crystalline structure that differs from the original underlying lattice. We
demonstrate that twisting a simple cubic lattice can generate various crystal
structures. This capability of altering crystal structures by twisting offers a
broad range of tunability for three-dimensional band structures.

<p>In this work, we have proposed a data-driven screening framework combining
the interpretable machine learning with high-throughput calculations to
identify a series of metal oxides that exhibit both high-temperature tolerance
and high power factors. Aiming at the problem of weak generalization ability of
small data with power factors at high temperatures, we employ symbolic
regression for feature creation which enhances the robustness of the model
while preserving the physical meaning of features. 33 candidate metal oxides
are finally targeted for high-temperature thermoelectric applications from a
pool of 48,694 compounds in the Materials Project database. The Boltzmann
transport theory is utilized to perform electrical transport properties
calculations at 1,000 K. The relaxation time is approximated by employing
constant electron-phonon coupling based on the deformation potential theory.
Considering band degeneracy, the electron group velocity is obtained using the
momentum matrix element method, yielding 28 materials with power factors
greater than 50 ${\mu}W cm^{-1} K^{-2} $. The high-throughput framework we
proposed is instrumental in the selection of metal oxides for high-temperature
thermoelectric applications. Furthermore, our data-driven analysis and
transport calculation suggest that metal oxides rich in elements such as cerium
(Ce), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb) tend to exhibit high power factors at high
temperatures.

<br>
</p><i>John Strahan, Chatipat Lorpaiboon, Jonathan Weare, Aaron R. Dinner</i>
<p>An issue for molecular dynamics simulations is that events of interest often
involve timescales that are much longer than the simulation time step, which is
set by the fastest timescales of the model. Because of this timescale
separation, direct simulation of many events is prohibitively computationally
costly. This issue can be overcome by aggregating information from many
relatively short simulations that sample segments of trajectories involving
events of interest. This is the strategy of Markov state models (MSMs) and
related approaches, but such methods suffer from approximation error because
the variables defining the states generally do not capture the dynamics fully.
By contrast, once converged, the weighted ensemble (WE) method aggregates
information from trajectory segments so as to yield unbiased estimates of both
thermodynamic and kinetic statistics. Unfortunately, errors decay no faster
than unbiased simulation in WE. Here we introduce a theoretical framework for
describing WE that shows that introduction of an element of stratification, as
in nonequilibrium umbrella sampling (NEUS), accelerates convergence. Then,
building on ideas from MSMs and related methods, we propose an improved
stratification that allows approximation error to be reduced systematically. We
show that the improved stratification can decrease simulation times required to
achieve a desired precision by orders of magnitude.

<p>We develop a strategy that integrates machine learning and first-principles

Specifically, the methodology allows to predict infrared spectra for complex
systems at finite temperatures. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated in
challenging scenarios, such as the analysis of water and the organic-inorganic
halide perovskite MAPbI$_{3}$, where our results consistently align with
experimental data. A distinctive feature of the methodology is the
incorporation of derivative learning, which proves indispensable for obtaining
accurate polarization data in bulk materials and facilitates the training of a
machine learning surrogate model of the polarization adapted to rotational and
translational symmetries. We achieve polarisation prediction accuracies of
about 1 % by training only on the predicted Born effective charges.

<p>We explore the quasiparticle dynamics in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
crystal using ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy at high pressure up to
34.2 GPa. At ambient pressure, the temperature dependence of relaxation
indicates appearance of phonon bottleneck effect due to the opening of
density-wave-like gap at 151 K. By analyzing the data with RT model, we
identified the energy scale of the gap to be 70 meV at ambient pressure. The
relaxation bottleneck effect is suppressed gradually by the pressure and
disappears around 26 GPa. At high pressure above 29.4 GPa, we discover a new
density-wave like order with transition temperature of $\sim$130 K. Our results
not only provide the first experimental evidence of the density-wave like gap

<p>Theoretical prediction of the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of metal-like
electron-ion systems would be greatly simplified if a convenient generalization
of the Lorentz number $L_N$ for arbitrary temperatures ($T$) and densities were
available. Such calculations are needed in astrophysics, high-energy-density

finite-$T$ form of $L_N(T)$, expressed in terms of elementary Fermi integrals.
It is a universal function of $t=T/E_F$, where $E_F$ is the Fermi energy of the
electrons. A convenient four-parameter fit to $L_N(t)$ for $t=0-\infty$ further
simplifies the applications. The effect of electron-electron interactions is
also briefly discussed. Calculations for $L_N(t)$ and thermal conductivities
$\kappa$ for Al and C are presented at several compressions and into the
million-Kelvin range. Experimental isobaric conductivities for Al just above
the meting point, and isochoric conductivities for Al and C from available
density-functional theory simulations and average-atom calculations are used as
comparisons.

<p>Traditionally, stress fluctuations in flowing and deformed materials are
overlooked, with an obvious focus on average stresses in a continuum mechanical
approximation. However, these fluctuations, often dismissed as noise, hold the
potential to provide direct insights into the material structure and its
structure-stress coupling, uncovering detailed aspects of fluid transport and
relaxation behaviors. Despite advancements in experimental techniques allowing
for the visualization of these fluctuations, their significance remains largely
untapped, as modeling efforts continue to target Newtonian fluids within the
confines of Gaussian noise assumptions. In the present work a comparative
analysis of stress fluctuations in two distinct microstructural models is
carried out: the temporary network model and the dumbbell model. Despite both
models conforming to the Upper Convected Maxwell Model at a macroscopic level,
the temporary network model predicts non-Gaussian fluctuations. We find that
stress fluctuations within the temporary network model exhibit more pronounced
abruptness at local scale, with only an enlargement of the control volume
leading to a gradual Gaussian-like noise, diminishing the differences between
the two models. These findings underscore the heightened sensitivity of
fluctuating rheology to microstructural details and the microstructure-flow
coupling, beyond what is captured by macroscopically averaged stresses.

<p>A large number of powerful, high-quality, and open-source simulation packages
exist to efficiently perform molecular dynamics simulations, and their
prevalence has greatly accelerated discoveries across a wide range of
scientific domains. These packages typically simulate particles in free
(Euclidean) space, with options to specify a variety of boundary conditions.
While more exotic, many physical systems are constrained to and interact across
curved surfaces, such as organisms moving across the landscape, colloids pinned
at curved fluid-fluid interfaces, and layers of epithelial cells forming highly
curved tissues. The calculation of distances and the updating of equations of
motion in idealized geometries (namely, on surfaces of constant curvature) can
be done analytically, but it is much more challenging to efficiently perform
molecular-dynamics-like simulations on arbitrarily curved surfaces. This
article discusses a simulation framework which combines tools from
particle-based simulations with recent work in discrete differential geometry
to model particles that interact via geodesic distances and move on an
arbitrarily curved surface. We present computational cost estimates for a
variety of surface complexities with and without various algorithmic
specializations (e.g., restrictions to short-range interaction potentials, or
multi-threaded parallelization). Our flexible and extensible framework is set
up to easily handle both equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics, and will
enable researchers to access time- and particle-number-scales previously
inaccessible.

<p>Utilizing a series of Bott indices formulated through polynomials of position
operators, we establish a comprehensive framework for characterizing
topological zero-energy corner states in systems with chiral symmetry. Our
framework covers systems with arbitrary shape, including topological phases
that are not characterizable by previously proposed invariants such as
multipole moments or multipole chiral numbers. A key feature of our framework
is its ability to capture the real-space pattern of zero-energy corner states.
We provide a rigorous analytical proof of its higher-order correspondence. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our theory, we examine several model systems
with representative patterns of zero-energy corner states that previous
frameworks fail to classify.
