<h3>Broad class of nonlinear Langevin equations with drift and diffusion  cofficients separable in time and space: Generalized n-moment, ergodicity,  Einstein relation and fluctuations of the system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17069" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17069</a>

<i>K. S. Fa, S. Pianegonda</i>
<p>A wide class of nonlinear Langevin equations with drift and diffusion
coefficients separable in time and space driven by the Gaussian white noise is
analyzed in terms of a generalized n-moment. We show the system may present
ergodic property, a key property in statistical mechanics, for
space-time-dependent drift and diffusion coefficients. A generalized Einstein
relation is also obtained. Besides, we show that the first two generalized
moments and variance are useful to describe the drift and fluctuations of the
system.

<h3>Avoided metallicity in a hole-doped Mott insulator on a triangular  lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17139" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17139</a>

<i>Chi Ming Yim, Gesa-R. Siemann, Srdjan Stavrić, Seunghyun Khim, Izidor Benedičič, Philip A. E. Murgatroyd, Tommaso Antonelli, Matthew D. Watson, Andrew P. Mackenzie, Silvia Picozzi, Phil D.C. King, Peter Wahl</i>
<p>Charge carrier doping of a Mott insulator is known to give rise to a wide
variety of exotic emergent states, from high-temperature superconductivity to
various charge, spin, and orbital orders. The physics underpinning their
evolution is, however, poorly understood. A major challenge is the chemical
complexity associated with traditional routes to the addition or removal of
carriers. Here, we study the Mott insulating CrO$_2$ layer of the delafossite
oxide PdCrO$_2$, where an intrinsic polar catastrophe provides a clean route to
induce substantial doping of the surface layer. Despite this, from scanning
tunneling microscopy and angle-resolved photoemission, we find that the surface
retains an insulating character, but with a modified electronic structure and
the development of a short-range ordered state with a distinct
$(\sqrt{7}\times\sqrt{7})\mathrm{R}\pm 19.1^\circ$ periodicity. From density
functional theory, we demonstrate how this reflects the formation of an
intricate charge disproportionation that results in an insulating ground state
of the surface layer that is disparate from the hidden Mott insulator found in
the bulk. By applying voltage pulses to the surface layer, we induce
substantial local modifications to this state, which we find relax on a time
scale of tens of minutes, pointing to a glassy nature of the
charge-disproportionated insulator realised here.

<h3>Energy diffusion in weakly interacting chains with fermionic  dissipation-assisted operator evolution</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17148" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17148</a>
<br>
<i>En-Jui Kuo, Brayden Ware, Peter Lunts, Mohammad Hafezi, Christopher David White</i>
<p>Interacting lattice Hamiltonians at high temperature generically give rise to
energy transport governed by the classical diffusion equation; however,
predicting the rate of diffusion requires numerical simulation of the
microscopic quantum dynamics. For the purpose of predicting such transport
properties, computational time evolution methods must be paired with schemes to
control the growth of entanglement to tractably simulate for sufficiently long
times. One such truncation scheme -- dissipation-assisted operator evolution
(DAOE) -- controls entanglement by damping out components of operators with
large Pauli weight. In this paper, we generalize DAOE to treat fermionic
systems. Our method instead damps out components of operators with large
fermionic weight. We investigate the performance of DAOE, the new fermionic
DAOE (FDAOE), and another simulation method, density matrix truncation (DMT),
in simulating energy transport in an interacting one-dimensional Majorana
chain. The chain is found to have a diffusion coefficient scaling like
interaction strength to the fourth power, contrary to naive expectations based
on Fermi's Golden rule -- but consistent with recent predictions based on the
theory of \emph{weak integrability breaking}. In the weak interaction regime
where the fermionic nature of the system is most relevant, FDAOE is found to
simulate the system more efficiently than DAOE.

<h3>Flux-tunable Josephson Effect in a Four-Terminal Junction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17158" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17158</a>
<br>
<i>Christian G. Prosko, Wietze D. Huisman, Ivan Kulesh, Di Xiao, Candice Thomas, Michael J. Manfra, Srijit Goswami</i>
<p>We study a phase-tunable four-terminal Josephson junction formed in an InSbAs
two-dimensional electron gas proximitized by aluminum. By embedding the two
pairs of junction terminals in asymmetric DC SQUIDs we can control the
superconducting phase difference across each pair, thereby gaining information
about their current-phase relation. Using a current-bias line to locally
control the magnetic flux through one SQUID, we measure a nonlocal Josephson
effect, whereby the current-phase relation across two terminals in the junction
is strongly dependent on the superconducting phase difference across two
completely different terminals. In particular, each pair behaves as a
$\phi_0$-junction with a phase offset tuned by the phase difference across the
other junction terminals. Lastly, we demonstrate that the behavior of an array
of two-terminal junctions replicates most features of the current-phase
relation of different multiterminal junctions. This highlights that these
signatures alone are not sufficient evidence of true multiterminal Josephson
effects arising from hybridization of Andreev bound states in the junction.

<h3>Chiral adiabatic transmission protected by Fermi surface topology</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17160" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17160</a>
<br>
<i>Isidora Araya Day, Kostas Vilkelis, Antonio L. R. Manesco, A. Mert Bozkurt, Valla Fatemi, Anton R. Akhmerov</i>
<p>We demonstrate that Andreev modes that propagate along a transparent
Josephson junction have a perfect transmission at the point where three
junctions meet. The chirality and the number of quantized transmission channels
is determined by the topology of the Fermi surface and the vorticity of the
superconducting phase differences at the trijunction. We explain this chiral
adiabatic transmission (CAT) as a consequence of the adiabatic evolution of the
scattering modes both in momentum and real space. We identify an effective
energy barrier that guarantees quantized transmission. We expect that CAT is
observable in nonlocal conductance and thermal transport measurements.
Furthermore, because it does not rely on particle-hole symmetry, CAT is also
possible to observe directly in metamaterials.

<h3>Is stochastic thermodynamics the key to understanding the energy costs  of computation?</h3>

Ouldridge, Andrea Richa, Paul Riechers, Édgar Roldán, Brenda Rubenstein, Zoltan Toroczkai, Joseph Paradiso</i>
<p>The relationship between the thermodynamic and computational characteristics
of dynamical physical systems has been a major theoretical interest since at
least the 19th century, and has been of increasing practical importance as the
energetic cost of digital devices has exploded over the last half century. One
of the most important thermodynamic features of real world computers is that
they operate very far from thermal equilibrium, in finite time, with many
quickly (co-)evolving degrees of freedom - in contrast to the quasi-statically
slow processes considered in 20th century analyses of the thermodynamics of
computational processes. Such processes also must obey multiple physical
constraints on how they work. For example, all modern digital computers are
periodic processes, governed by a global clock. Another example is that many
computers are modular, hierarchical systems, with strong restrictions on the
connectivity of their subsystems. This is true for naturally occurring
computers, like brains or Eukaryotic cells, as well as digital systems.
However, the field of stochastic thermodynamics has been developed in the last
few decades, and it provides the formal tools for analyzing exactly these kinds
of computational systems. We argue here that these tools, together with new
ones currently being developed in stochastic thermodynamics, may help us
understand at a far deeper level just how the fundamental physical properties
of dynamic systems are related to the computation that they perform.

<h3>Vortex pair dynamics in three-dimensional homogeneous dipolar  superfluids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17192" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17192</a>
<br>
<i>Srivatsa B. Prasad, Nick G. Parker, Andrew W. Baggaley</i>
<p>The static and dynamic properties of vortices in dipolar Bose-Einstein
condensates (dBECs) can be considerably modified relative to their nondipolar
counterparts by the anisotropic and long-ranged nature of the dipole-dipole
interaction. Working in a uniform dBEC, we analyze the structure of single
vortices and the dynamics of vortex pairs, investigating the deviations from
the nondipolar paradigm. For a straight vortex line, we find that the induced
dipolar interaction potential is axially anisotropic when the dipole moments
have a nonzero projection orthogonal to the vortex line. This results in a
corresponding elongation of the vortex core along this projection as well as an
anisotropic superfluid phase and enhanced compressibility in the vicinity of
the vortex core. Consequently, the trajectories of like-signed vortex pairs are
described by a family of elliptical and oval-like curves rather than the
familiar circular orbits. Similarly for opposite-signed vortex pairs their
translation speeds along the binormal are found to be dipole
interaction-dependent. We expect that these findings will shed light on the
underlying mechanisms of many-vortex phenomena in dBECs such as quantum
turbulence, vortex reconnections, and vortex lattices.

<h3>Origin of the classical magnetization discontinuities of the  dodecahedron</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17205" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17205</a>
<br>
<i>N. P. Konstantinidis</i>
<p>The classical antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the dodecahedron has been
shown to have three magnetization discontinuities in an external field. Here it
is shown that the highest-field discontinuity can be directly traced back to
the strong magnetization jump leading to saturation at the Ising limit, which
originates from the frustrated connectivity of the molecule. This discontinuity
survives up to the $XY$ limit and disappears just before the ferromagnetic
Ising interaction fully polarizes the spins. The two lower-field jumps of the
model result from the competition of discontinuities that emerge from the
magnetization plateau surviving away from the Ising limit.

<h3>Ultrafast Opto-Electronic and Thermal Tuning of Third-Harmonic  Generation in a Graphene Field Effect Transistor</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17208" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17208</a>
<br>
<i>Omid Ghaebi, Sebastian Klimmer, Nele Tornow, Niels Buijssen, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Andrea Tomadin, Habib Rostami, Giancarlo Soavi</i>
<p>Graphene is a unique platform for tunable opto-electronic applications thanks
to its linear band dispersion, which allows electrical control of resonant
light-matter interactions. Tuning the nonlinear optical response of graphene is
possible both electrically and in an all-optical fashion, but each approach
involves a trade-off between speed and modulation depth. Here, we combine
lattice temperature, electron doping, and all-optical tuning of third-harmonic
generation in a hBN-encapsulated graphene opto-electronic device and
demonstrate up to 85% modulation depth along with gate-tunable ultrafast
dynamics. These results arise from the dynamic changes in the transient
electronic temperature combined with Pauli blocking induced by the
out-of-equilibrium chemical potential. Our work provides a detailed description
of the transient nonlinear optical and electronic response of graphene, which
is crucial for the design of nanoscale and ultrafast optical modulators,
detectors and frequency converters.

<h3>Ab initio study on the stability and elasticity of brucite</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17268" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17268</a>
<br>
<i>Hongjin Wang, Chenxing Luo, Renata M. Wentzcovitch</i>
<p>Brucite (Mg(OH)$_2$) is a mineral of great interest owing to its various
applications and roles in geological processes. Its structure, behavior under
different conditions, and unique properties have been the subject of numerous
studies and persistent debate. As a stable hydrous phase in subduction zones,
its elastic anisotropy can significantly contribute to the seismological
properties of these regions. We performed ab initio calculations to investigate
brucite's stability, elasticity, and acoustic velocities. We tested several
exchange-correlation functionals and managed to obtain stable phonons for the
P$\bar{3}$ phase with r$^2$SCAN for the first time at all relevant pressures up
to the mantle transition zone. We show that r$^2$SCAN performs very well in
brucite, reproducing the experimental equation of state and several key
structure parameters related to hydrogen positions. The room temperature
elasticity results in P$\bar{3}$ reproduces the experimental results at ambient
pressure. These results, together with the stable phonon dispersion of
P$\bar{3}$ at all relevant pressures, indicate P$\bar{3}$ is the stable
candidate phase not only at elevated pressures but also at ambient conditions.
The success of r$^2$SCAN in brucite, suggests this functional should be
suitable for other challenging layer-structured minerals, e.g., serpentines, of
great geophysical significance.

<h3>Ferroelectric domain nucleation and switching pathways in hafnium oxide</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17290" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17290</a>
<br>
<i>Sebastian Calderon V, Samantha T. Jaszewski, Kyle P. Kelley, Jon F. Ihlefeld, Elizabeth Dickey</i>
<p>Nanoscale ferroelectrics that can be integrated into microelectronic
fabrication processes are highly desirable for low-power computing and
non-volatile memory devices. However, scalable novel ferroelectric materials,
such as hafnium oxide (HfO2), remain in a state of development, and a clear
understanding of the effects of relevant compositional and processing
parameters to control their ferroelectric properties and the actual
polarization switching mechanisms are still under investigation. One key
fundamental knowledge gap is the polarization switching pathway in
ferroelectric hafnia. To further our fundamental understanding of domain
nucleation and switching, we have studied polarization switching pathways in
HfO2-x thin films in real-time at the atomic scale using transmission electron
microscopy. We employed differential phase contrast imaging that allows for the
acquisition of both hafnium and oxygen atomic column signals and facilitates
the observation of relative movement of atomic columns between both
sublattices. Our results demonstrate that the switching pathway involves a
transient tetragonal-like local structure, as oxygen ions shift in locations
and remain within their parent hafnium polyhedra.

<h3>Interband and exciton related optical properties of ZnGeN$_2$ compared  to GaN</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17294" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17294</a>
<br>
<i>Ozan Dernek, Walter R. L. Lambrecht</i>
<p>The optical dielectric function of ZnGeN$_2$ is calculated from the interband
transitions using the energy bands calculated in the quasiparticle
self-consistent (QS)$G\hat{W}$ method using two different levels of
approximation: the independent particle approximation (IPA) and the
Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) approach. The first allows us to relate peaks in
{\epsilon}2({\omega}) to specific bands and k-points but does not include
electron-hole interaction effects. The second includes electron-hole
interaction or excitonic effects. The corresponding changes in the shape of
$\epsilon_2(\omega)$ are found to be similar to those in GaN. The screened
Coulomb interaction $\hat{W}$ is here calculated including electron-hole
interactions in the polarization function and gives a band structure already
going beyond the random phase approximation. The convergence of the bound
excitons with density of the k-mesh included in the BSE is studied. The
excitons are related to each of the three fold split valence band and the
splittings of the latter are also studied as function of strain.

<h3>Atomic engineering of interfacial polarization switching in van der  Waals multilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17300" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17300</a>
<br>
<i>Madeline Van Winkle, Nikita Dowlatshahi, Nikta Khaloo, Mrinalni Iyer, Isaac M. Craig, Rohan Dhall, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, D. Kwabena Bediako</i>
<p>In conventional ferroelectric materials, polarization is an intrinsic
property limited by bulk crystallographic structure and symmetry. Recently, it
has been demonstrated that polar order can also be accessed using inherently
non-polar van der Waals materials through layer-by-layer assembly into
heterostructures, wherein interfacial interactions can generate spontaneous,
switchable polarization. Here, we show that introducing interlayer rotations in
multilayer vdW heterostructures modulates both the spatial ordering and
switching dynamics of polar domains, engendering unique tunability that is
unparalleled in conventional bulk ferroelectrics or polar bilayers. Using
operando transmission electron microscopy we show how changing the relative
rotations of three WSe2 layers produces structural polytypes with distinct
arrangements of polar domains, leading to either a global or localized
switching response. Introducing uniaxial strain generates structural anisotropy
that yields a range of switching behaviors, coercivities, and even tunable
biased responses. We also provide evidence of physical coupling between the two
interfaces of the trilayer, a key consideration for controlling switching
dynamics in polar multilayer structures more broadly.

<h3>Interactions between atomic-scale skyrmions in 2D chiral magnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17310" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17310</a>
<br>
<i>Mai Kameda, Koji Kobayashi, Yuki Kawaguchi</i>
<p>To commercialize stable, highly-integrated, and low-power-consuming magnetic
memories of skyrmions, stable control of their motion is crucial. Manipulating
the inter-skyrmion interactions is key to achieving this goal. We find that
distortion of the skyrmion shape can induce the interskyrmion attraction
between atomic-scale small skyrmions, similar to larger skyrmions. Also, the
interaction of smaller skyrmions reaches further, when scaled by the skyrmion
size, than that of larger skyrmions. The continuum model is still capable of
explaining the behavior. Moreover, the formation of the magnetic domains
between skyrmions also induces attraction, which is again the same mechanism as
larger skyrmions. This study contributes to better control of the skyrmion
motion with a wide range of their sizes.

<h3>Superconductivity of metastable dihydrides at ambient pressure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17328" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17328</a>
<br>
<i>Heejung Kim, Ina Park, J. H. Shim, D. Y. Kim</i>
<p>Hydrogen in metals is a significant research area with far-reaching
implications, encompassing diverse fields such as hydrogen storage,
metal-insulator transitions, and the recently emerging phenomenon of
room-temperature ($\textit{$T_C$}$) superconductivity under high pressure.
Hydrogen atoms pose challenges in experiments as they are nearly invisible, and
they are considered within ideal crystalline structures in theoretical
predictions, which hampers research on the formation of meta-stable hydrides.
Here, we propose pressure-induced hydrogen migration from tetrahedral site
($\textit{T}$) to octahedral site ($\textit{O}$),forming $LaH_x^OH_{2-x}^{T}$
in cubic $LaH^2$.Under decompression, it retains $H_x^O$ occupancy, and is
dynamically stable even at ambient pressure, enabling a synthesis route of
metastable dihydrides via compression-decompression process. We predict that
the electron phonon coupling strength of $LaH_x^OH_{2-x}^{T}$ is enhanced with
increasing $\textit{x}$, and the associated $\textit{$T_C$}$ reaches up to 10.8
$\textit{K}$ at ambient pressure. Furthermore, we calculated stoichiometric
hydrogen migration threshold pressure ($\textit{$P_C$}$) for various
lanthanides dihydrides ($\textit{R}$$H_2$, where $\textit{R}$=Y, Sc, Nd, and
Lu), and found an inversely linear relation between $\textit{$P_C$}$ and ionic
radii of $\textit{R}$. We propose that the highest $\textit{$T_C$}$ in the
face-centered-cubic dihydride system can be realized by optimizing the
$\textit{O}$/$\textit{T}$-site occupancies.

<i>Xusheng Zhang, Werner Krauth</i>
<p>We determine diameters of Markov chains describing one-dimensional N
-particle models with an exclusion interaction, namely the Ssep (symmetric
simple exclusion process) and one of its non-reversible liftings, the lifted
Tasep (totally asymmetric simple exclusion process). The diameters provide
lower bounds for the mixing times, and we discuss the implications of our
findings for the analysis of these models.

<h3>Optical control of ferroaxial order</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17362" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17362</a>
<br>
<i>Zhiren He, Guru Khalsa</i>
<p>Materials that exhibit ferroaxial order hold potential for novel multiferroic
applications. However, in pure ferroaxials, domains are not directly coupled to
stress or static electric field due to their symmetry, limiting the ability to
pole and switch between domains -- features required for real-world
applications. Here we propose a general approach to selectively condense and
switch between ferroaxial domains with light. We show that circularly polarized
light pulses on resonance with infrared-active phonons manifest
helicity-dependent control over ferroaxial domains. Nonlinear contributions to
the lattice polarizability play an essential role in this phenomenon. We
illustrate the feasibility of our approach using first-principle calculations
and dynamical simulations for the archetypal ferroaxial material
RbFe(MoO$_4$)$_2$. Our results are discussed in the context of future
pump-probe optical experiments, where polarization, carrier frequency, and
fluence threshold are explored.

<h3>Elastic instability behind brittle fracture in soft solids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17372" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17372</a>
<br>
<i>D. Riccobelli, P. Ciarletta, G. Vitale, C. Maurini, L. Truskinovsky</i>
<p>We argue that nucleation of brittle cracks in initially flawless soft elastic
solids is preceded by a continuum instability which cannot be captured without
accounting for geometrically and physical nonlinearities of the constitutive
response. To corroborate this somewhat counterintuitive claim, we present a
theoretical and numerical study of the simplest model where a homogeneous
elastic body subjected to tension is weakened by a free surface which then
serves as a site of crack nucleation. We show that in this prototypical
setting, brittle fracture starts as a symmetry breaking elastic instability
activated by softening and involving large elastic rotations. The implied
bifurcation of the homogeneous elastic equilibrium is highly unconventional due
to its extraordinary sensitivity to geometry, reminiscent of the transition to
turbulence. We trace the development of the instability beyond the limits of
continuum elasticity by using quasi-continuum theory allowing one to capture
the ultimate strain localization indicative of the formation of actual cracks.

<br>
<i>Jialiang Jiang, Jin Tang, Yaodong Wu, Qi Zhang, Yihao Wang, Junbo Li, Yimin Xiong, Lingyao Kong, Shouguo Wang, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du</i>
<p>Skyrmions are vortex-like localized magnetic structures that possess an
integer-valued topological index known as the skyrmion number or topological
charge. Skyrmion number determines the topology-related emergent magnetism,
which is highly desirable for advanced storage and computing devices. In order
to achieve device functions, it is necessary to manipulate the skyrmion number
in confined nanostructured geometries using electrical methods. Here, we report
the reliable current-controlled operations for manipulating the skyrmion number
through reversible topological transformations between skyrmion chains and
stripe domains in confined Fe3Sn2 nanostripes. The results of micromagnetic
simulations are successful in numerically reproducing our experiments and
explaining them through the combined effect of current-induced Joule heating
and magnetic hysteresis. These findings hold the potential to advance the
development of topological spintronic devices.

<i>Lingyao Kong, Jin Tang, Weiwei Wang, Yaodong Wu, Jialiang Jiang, Yihao Wang, Junbo Li, Yimin Xiong, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du</i>
<p>It is well known that there are two types of magnetic bubbles in uniaxial
magnets. Here, using Lorentz-transimission electronic microscopy magnetic
imaging, we report the direct experimental observation of 3D type-III hybrid
bubbles, which comprise N\'eel-twisted skyrmion bubbles with topological charge
Q = -1 in near-surface layers and type-II bubbles with Q = 0 in interior
layers, in Fe3Sn2 nanodisks. Using the tilted magnetic field, we further show
the controlled topological magnetic transformations of three types of bubbles
in a confined ferromagnetic nanodisk. Our observations are well reproduced
using micromagnetic simulations based on measured magnetic parameters. Our
results advance fundamental classification and understanding of magnetic
bubbles, which could propel the applications of three-dimensional magnetism.

<br>
<i>Jin Tang, Yaodong Wu, Jialiang Jiang, Lingyao Kong, Shouguo Wang, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du</i>
<p>Magnetic skyrmions are spin swirls that possess topological nontriviality and
are considered particle-like entities. They are distinguished by an integer
topological charge Q. The presence of skyrmion bundles provides an opportunity
to explore the range of values for Q, which is crucial for the advancement of
topological spintronic devices with multi-Q properties. In this study, we
present a new material candidate, Sr2Co2Fe28O46 hexaferrite of the X-type,
which hosts small dipolar skyrmions at room temperature and above. By
exploiting reversed magnetic fields from metastable skyrmion bubbles at zero
fields, we can incorporate skyrmion-bubble bundles with different interior
skyrmion/bubble numbers, topological charges, and morphologies at room
temperature. Our experimental findings are consistently supported by
micromagnetic simulations. Our results highlight the versatility of topological
spin textures in centrosymmetric uniaxial magnets, thereby paving the way for
the development of room-temperature topological spintronic devices with multi-Q
characteristics.

<h3>Discovery of Higher-Order Nodal Surface Semimetals</h3>

<br>
<i>Huahui Qiu, Yuzeng Li, Qicheng Zhang, Chunyin Qiu</i>
<p>The emergent higher-order topological insulators significantly deepen our
understanding of topological physics. Recently, the study has been extended to
topological semimetals featuring gapless bulk band nodes. To date, higherorder
nodal point and line semimetals have been successfully realized in different
physical platforms. However, the concept of higher-order nodal surface
semimetals, the final frontier in this field, has yet to be proposed, let alone
experimentally observed. Here, we report an ingenious design route for
constructing this unprecedented higher-order topological phase. The
threedimensional model, layer-stacked with two-dimensional anisotropic
SuSchrieffer-Heeger lattice, exhibits appealing hinge arcs connecting the
projected nodal surfaces. Experimentally, we realize this new topological phase
in an acoustic metamaterial, and present unambiguous evidence for both the bulk
nodal structure and hinge arc states, the two key manifestations of the
higher-order nodal surface semimetal. Our findings can be extended to other
classical systems such as photonic, elastic, and electric circuit systems, and
open new possibilities for controlling waves.

<p>This study employs density functional theory (DFT) and density functional
tight-binding theory (DFTB) to determine the adsorption properties of carbon
dioxide (CO$_2$), methane (CH$_4$), and dihydrogen (H$_2$) in carbophenes
functionalized with carboxyl (COOH), amine (NH$_2$), nitro (NO$_2$), and
hydroxyl (OH) groups. We demonstrate that carbophenes are promising candidates
as adsorbents for these gasses. Carbophenes have larger CO$_2$ and CH$_4$
adsorption energies than other next-generation solid-state capture materials.
Yet, the low predicted desorption temperatures mean they can be beneficial as
air scrubbers in confined spaces. Functionalized carbophenes have H$_2$
adsorption energies usually observed in metal-containing materials. Further,
the predicted desorption temperatures of H$_2$ from carbophenes lie within the
DOE Technical Targets for Onboard Hydrogen Storage for Light-Duty Vehicles
(DOEHST) operating temperature range. The possibility of tailoring the degree
of functionalization in combination with selecting sufficiently open carbophene
structures that allow for multiple strong interactions without steric hindrance
(crowding) effects, added to the multiplicity of possible functional groups
alone or in combination, suggests that these very light materials can be ideal
adsorbates for many gases. Tailoring the design to specific adsorption or
separation needs would require extensive combinatorial investigations.

<p>We report three-dimensional topological spin configurations including a novel
form of skyrmion-antiskyrmion coupling in D2d chiral magnets. The
skyrmion-antiskyrmion coupled string, consisting of skyrmions located in the
near-surface layers and antiskyrmions in the interior of the nanostructured
sample that are sewn together by emergent monopoles, is a hybrid
three-dimensional soliton solution resulting from the application of
micromagnetic equations. We further provide experimental evidence of these 3D
topological skyrmionic strings in a FeNiPdP chiral magnet with S4 symmetry. Our
results demonstrate reversible topological magnetic transformations between
skyrmion-antiskyrmion and skyrmion-bubble strings, which are mediated by the
creation and annihilation of monopoles.

<p>The formation of well-defined three-dimensional (3D) redox-active molecular
nanostructures at the electrode surfaces may open additional routes to achieve
higher conductance in molecular junctions (MJs). We report here experimental
and theoretical charge transport analysis on electroactive
ruthenium(II)-tri(phenanthroline) [Ru(Phen)3]-based molecular junctions
covalently grown on patterned ITO electrode. Thicknesses of the molecular
layers are varied between 4 to 13 nm, thanks to the potential-driven
electrochemical technique to achieve it. A thin layer of Al was deposited on
top contact over ITO/ Ru(Phen)3 to fabricate large-area solid-state molecular
junctions with a stacking configuration of ITO/[Ru(Phen)3]4nm, 10nm, 13nm/Al.
The electrified molecular junctions show LUMO-mediated electron-driven resonant
charge conduction with attenuation in conductance as a function of the length
of Ru(Phen)3 layers (\b{eta} = 0.48 to 0.60 nm-1). Molecular junctions
consisting of 4 nm Ru(Phen)3 layers follow quantum tunneling, while the thicker
junctions (10, and 13 nm) follow Poole-Frenkel and electric-field induced
charge conduction. Considering the energy level of frontier molecular orbitals,
Fermi energy of ITO, and Al contact, a mechanism of symmetric current-voltage
features with respect to the bias-polarity is predicted. The present work
describes a simple, controllable, low-cost, and versatile approach to
fabricating 3D molecular assembly for mimicking conventional electronic
functions.

<h3>Mean Back Relaxation for Position and Densities</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17477" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17477</a>
<br>
<i>Gabriel Knotz, Matthias Krüger</i>
<p>Correlation functions are a standard tool for analyzing statistical particle
trajectories. Recently, a so called mean back relaxation (MBR) has been
introduced, which correlates positions at three time points and which has been
shown to be a marker for breakage of time reversal symmetry for confined
particles. Here, we extend this discussion in several ways. We give an
extension to multiple dimensions. Using a path integral approach, we provide a
general expression for MBR in terms of multipoint density correlations. For
Gaussian systems, this expression yields a relation between MBR and mean
squared displacement. From it, several properties of MBR for Gaussian
equilibrium systems can be found, such as monotonicity and positivity.
Unexpectedly, in this case the particle forgets the conditioning via a power
law in time. We finally demonstrate that using MBR for microscopic densities,
it is a marker for broken detailed balance even in bulk systems.

<h3>Rotating magnetoelectric effect in a ground state of a coupled  spin-electron model on a doubly decorated square lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17495" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17495</a>
<br>
<i>Hana Čenčariková, Jozef Strečka</i>
<p>Exact analytical calculations are performed to study the rotating
magnetoelectric effect in a ground state of a coupled spin-electron model on a
doubly decorated square lattice with and without presence of an external
magnetic field. Novel spatially anisotropic magnetic ground states emergent due
to a rotation in an external electric field are found at three physically
interesting electron concentrations ranging from a quarter up to a half
filling. In absence of the magnetic field existence of spatially anisotropic
structures requires a fractional electron concentration, where a significant
influence of spatial orientation of an electric field is observed. It turns out
that the investigated model exhibits a rotating magnetoelectric effect at all
three concentrations with one or two consecutive critical points in presence of
magnetic field. At the same time, the rotating electric field has a significant
effect on a critical value of an electrostatic potential, which can be enhanced
or lowered upon changing the electron hopping and the magnitude of an applied
magnetic field. Finally, we have found an intriguing interchange of magnetic
order between the horizontal and vertical directions driven by a rotation of
the electric field, which is however destabilized upon strengthening of the
magnetic field.

<p>Superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) driven by disorder and transverse
magnetic field has been investigated in ultrathin MoN films by means of
transport measurements and scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Upon
decreasing thickness, the homogeneously disordered films show increasing sheet
resistance Rs, shift of the superconducting transition Tc to lower temperatures
with the 3 nm MoN being the last superconducting film and thinner films already
insulating. Fermionic scenario of SIT is evidenced by applicability of the
Finkelsteins model, by the fact that Tc and the superconducting gap are coupled
with a constant ratio, and by the spatial homogeneity of the superconducting
and electronic characteristics. The logarithmic anomaly found in the tunneling
spectra of the non-superconducting films is further enhanced in increased
magnetic field due to the Zeeman spin effects driving the system deeper into
the insulating state and pointing also to fermionic SIT.

<h3>Suppressed superconductivity in ultrathin Mo2N films due to  pair-breaking at the interface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17506" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17506</a>
<br>
<i>M. Kuzmiak, M. Kopcik, F. Kosuth, V. Vano, P. Szabo, V. Latyshev, V. Komanicky, P. Samuely</i>
<p>A strong disorder characterized by a small product of the Fermi vector kF and
the electron mean free l drives superconductors towards insulating state. Such
disorder can be introduced by making the films very thin. Here, we present 3-nm
Mo2N film with k_F*l ~ 2 with a resistive superconducting transition
temperature Tc = 2 K heavily suppressed in comparison with the bulk Tc.
Superconducting density of states (DOS) with smeared gap-like peaks and in-gap
states, so called Dynes DOS, is observed by the low temperature tunneling
spectroscopy despite a sharp resistive transition. By scanning tunneling
microscope the spectral maps are obtained and related to the surface
topography. The maps show a spatial variation of the superconducting energy gap
on the order of 20 % which is not accidental but well correlates with the
surface corrugation: protrusions reveal larger gap, smaller spectral smearing
and smaller in-gap states. In agreement with our previous measurements on
ultrathin MoC films we suggest that the film-substrate interface introducing
the local pair-breaking is responsible for the observed effects and generally
for the suppression of the superconductivity in these ultrathin films.

<h3>Giant amplification of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition  temperature in superconducting systems characterized by cooperative interplay  of small-gapped valence and conduction bands</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17511" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17511</a>
<br>
<i>Giovanni Midei, Andrea Perali</i>
<p>Two-dimensional superconductors and electron-hole superfluids in van der
Waals heterostructures having tunable valence and conduction bands in the
electronic spectrum are emerging as rich platforms to investigate novel quantum
phases and topological phase transitions. In this work, by adopting a
mean-field approach considering multiple-channel pairings and the
Kosterlitz-Nelson criterion, we demonstrate giant amplifications of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition temperature and a shrinking of
the pseudogap for small energy separations between the conduction and valence
bands and small density of carriers in the conduction band. The presence of the
holes in the valence band, generated by intra-band and pair-exchange couplings,
contributes constructively to the phase stiffness of the total system, adding
up to the phase stiffness of the conduction band electrons that is boosted as
well, due to the presence of the valence band electrons. This strong
cooperative effect avoids the suppression of the BKT transition temperature for
low density of carriers, that occurs in single-band superconductors where only
the conduction band is present. Thus, we predict that in this regime,
multi-band superconducting and superfluid systems with valence and conduction
bands can exhibit much larger BKT critical temperatures with respect to
single-band and single-condensate systems.

<h3>Reinforcement Learning with thermal fluctuations at the nano-scale</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17519" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17519</a>
<br>
<i>Francesco Boccardo, Olivier Pierre-Louis</i>
<p>Reinforcement Learning offers a framework to learn to choose actions in order
to achieve some goal. However, at the nano-scale, thermal fluctuations hamper
the learning process. We show that in this regime, while optimal actions should
bring an improvement proportional to the small ratio of the applied force times
a length-scale over the temperature, the learned improvement is smaller and
proportional to the square of this small ratio. Consequently, the efficiency of
learning, which compares the learning improvement to the theoretical optimal
improvement, drops to zero. Nevertheless, we show how to circumvent these
limitations by using actions learned at a lower temperature. Our results are
illustrated with simulations of the control of small particle clusters, and
should apply to a wide class of other problems that can also be formulated as a
Markov Decision Processes such as nano-navigation and nano-machine actuation.

<h3>Non-reciprocal electron transport in finite-size  superconductor/ferromagnet bilayers with strong spin-orbit coupling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17534" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17534</a>
<br>
<i>A. V. Putilov, S. V. Mironov, A. I. Buzdin</i>
<p>We show that spin-orbit coupling at the interface between a superconducting
film of the finite lateral size and the underlying ferromagnetic insulator with
in-plane exchange field gives rise to a series of non-reciprocal effects
provided the superconducting pairing is enhanced near the boundaries of the
superconductor due to, e.g., variation of the film thickness or of the
interlayer electron transparency. Specifically, the critical temperature and
the critical depairing current are shown to depend on the relative orientation
between the exchange field in the ferromagnet and the superconducting film
boundaries. The discovered anisotropy of the superconducting properties is
promising for the design of diode-type elements in superconducting spintronics.

<h3>Topological entanglement entropy, boundary defects, and  electric-magnetic duality</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17569" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17569</a>
<br>
<i>Yingcheng Li</i>
<p>Topological entanglement entropy (TEE), the sub-leading term in the
entanglement entropy of topological order, is the direct evidence of the the
long-range entanglement in topological order. While effective in characterizing
topological orders on closed manifolds, TEE is model-dependent and ambiguous
when entanglement cuts intersect with physical gapped boundaries, obscuring the
information encoded in TEE. In this paper, we study the origin of TEE and its
model-dependence, and elucidate the information encoded in TEE. We introduce a
model-independent picture of partitioning the topological orders with gapped
boundaries, where the entanglement boundaries (EBs), i.e. the virtual
boundaries of each subsystem induced by the entanglement cuts, are assumed to
be gapped boundaries with boundary defects. At this model-independent stage,
there are two choices one has to make manually in defining the bi-partition:
the boundary condition on the EBs, and some extra parameters that quantify the
coherence between certain boundary states. We show that TEE appears because of
a constraint on the defect configurations on the EBs, which is independent of
the choice in the cases where the EBs are closed loops, but is choice-dependent
in the cases where the EBs are open segments touching gapped boundaries.
Different models intrinsically employ different choices, rendering TEE
model-dependent. Specifically, calculations within the K-matrix theory, which
employs the folding trick, naturally choose EB conditions that respect
electric-magnetic duality and set specific parameter values.

<h3>Emergence of a spin-liquid-like phase in quantum spin-ladder Ba2CuTeO6  with chemical substitution</h3>

<br>
<i>Shalini Badola, Devesh Negi, Aprajita Joshi, Surajit Saha</i>
<p>Stabilization of the quantum spin liquids is vital to realize applications in
spintronics and quantum computing. The unique magnetic structure of Ba2CuTeO6
comprising of coupled spin-ladders with finite inter-ladder coupling brings the
system close to the quantum critical point. This opens up possibilities to
stabilize unconventional magnetic phases by tailoring the intra- and
inter-ladder exchange couplings. Here, we demonstrate a spin-liquid-like phase
in Ba2CuTeO6 using the method of chemical substitution. We choose non-magnetic
La3+ cation to substitute the Ba2+ in Ba2CuTeO6 and present signature
fingerprints such as deprived magnetic transition, non-dispersive AC
susceptibility, magnetic field-independent heat capacity, and broad Raman
continuum supporting the emergence of a spin-liquid-like phase. We believe that
an increased magnetic frustration and spin-fractionalization upon chemical
substitution play a crucial role in driving such a state. In addition,
temperature and magnetic field-dependent phonon response indicate the presence
of magnetostriction (spin-lattice coupling) in La-doped Ba2CuTeO6, a notable
property of spin-liquids.

<h3>Alterferroicity with seesaw-type magnetoelectricity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17577" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17577</a>
<br>
<i>Ziwen Wang, Shuai Dong</i>
<p>Primary ferroicities like ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism are essential
physical properties of matter. Multiferroics, with coexisting multiple ferroic
orders in a single phase, provide a convenient route to magnetoelectricity.
Even so, the general trade-off between magnetism and polarity remains
inevitable, which prevents practicable magnetoelectric cross control in the
multiferroic framework. Here an alternative strategy, i.e. the so-called
alterferroicity, is proposed to circumvent the magnetoelectric exclusiveness,
which exhibits multiple but non-coexisting ferroic orders. The natural
exclusion between magnetism and polarity, as an insurmountable weakness of
multiferroicity, becomes a distinct advantage in alterferroicity, making it an
inborn rich ore for intrinsic strong magnetoelectricity. The general design
rules for alterferroic materials rely on the competition between the
instabilities of phononic and electronic structures in covalent systems. Based
on primary density functional theory calculations, Ti-based trichalcogenides
are predicted to be alterferroic candidates, which exhibit unique seesaw type
magnetoelectricity. This alterferroicity, as an emerging branch of ferroic
family, re-shapes the framework of magnetoelectricity, going beyond the
established scenario based on multiferroicity.

<br>
<i>Juan Pablo Guerrero-Felipe, Ana M. Valencia, . C. Cocchi</i>
<p>The adsorption of carbon-conjugated molecules represents an established route
to tune the electronic and optical properties of transition metal
dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers. Here, we demonstrate from first principles
that such a functionalization with prototypical compounds pyrene and tetracene
can also enhance the magnitude of selected plasmon resonances in a MoS$_2$
single sheet, without significantly altering their energy and dispersion. Our
proof-of-principle results indicate that such a magnification can be achieved
by proper alignment of the molecules with respect to the direction of the
transferred momentum. The distinct signatures in the loss function of the
interface compared to those of its constituents suggest not only the presence
of non-negligible interactions between them but also the possibility of using
electron energy loss spectroscopy to detect the presence and the orientation of
molecular adsorbates on TMDCs.

<h3>Exotic electronic states in gradient-strained untwisted graphene  bilayers</h3>

<br>
<i>Zeyu Liu, Xianghua Kong, Zewen Wu, Linwei Zhou, Jingsi Qiao, Wei Ji</i>
<p>Many exotic electronic states were discovered in moire superlattices hosted
in twisted homo-bilayers in the past decade, including unconventional
superconductivity and correlated insulating states. However, it is technically
challenging to precisely and orderly stack two or more layers into certain
twisting angles. Here, we presented a theoretical strategy that introduces
moire superlattices in untwisted homo-bilayers by applying different in-plane
strains on the two layers of a graphene homo-bilayer, respectively. Our density
functional theory calculations indicate that the graphene bilayer exhibits
substantial out-of-plane corrugations that form a coloring-triangular structure
in each moire supercell under gradient in-plane strains. Such structure leads
to a set of kagome bands, namely one flat-band and, at least, one Dirac band,
developing along the M-K path after band-folding. For comparison, uniformly
applied in-plane strain only yields a nearly flat band within path K-G, which
is originated from local quantum confinement. These findings highlight the
gradient strain as a route to feasibly fabricate exotic electronic states in
untwisted flexible homo-bilayers.

<i>Alakesh Upadhyaya, Venkata Sathish Akella</i>
<p>We report a simulation study on the narrow escape kinetics of a Chiral Active
Particle (CAP) confined to a circular domain with a narrow escape opening. The
studys main objective is to optimize the CAPs escape changes as a function of
the relevant parameters, such as translational and rotational speeds of the
CAP, domain size, etc. We identified three regimes in the escape kinetics,
namely the noise-dominated regime, the optimal regime, and the chiral
activity-dominated regime. In particular, the optimal regime is characterized
by an escape scheme that involves a direct passage to the domain boundary first
and then a unidirectional drift along the boundary towards the exit.
Furthermore, we propose a non-dimensionalization approach to optimize the
escape performance across microorganisms with varying motile characteristics.
Additionally, we explore the influence of the translational and rotational
noise on the CAPs escape kinetics

<p>Mammalian cell polarization and motility are important processes involved in
many physiological and pathological phenomena, such as embryonic development,
wound healing, and cancer metastasis. The traditional view of mammalian cell
motility suggests that molecular motors, adhesion, and cell deformation are all
necessary components for mammalian cell movement. However, experiments on the
immune cell system have shown that the inhibition of molecular motors does not
significantly affect cell motility. We present a new theory and simulations
demonstrating that actin polymerization alone is sufficient to induce
spontaneously cell polarity accompanied by the retrograde flow. These findings
provide a new understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of cell movement and
at the same time provide a simple mechanism for cell motility in diverse
configurations, e.g. on an adherent substrate, in a non-adherent matrix, or in
liquids.

<i>T. V. Pavlova, V. M. Shevlyuga</i>
<p>For the most precise incorporation of single impurities in silicon, which is
utilized to create quantum devices, a monolayer of adatoms on the Si(100)
surface and a dopant-containing molecule are used. Here we studied the
interaction of a phosphorus tribromide with a chlorine monolayer with mono- and
bivacancies in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) at 77 K. The combination
of different halogens in the molecule and the adsorbate layer enabled
unambiguous identification of the structures after PBr3 dissociation on
Si(100)-Cl. A Cl monolayer was exposed to PBr3 in the STM chamber, which allows
us to compare the same surface areas before and after PBr3 adsorption. As a
result of this comparison, we detected small changes in the chlorine layer and
unraveled the molecular fragments filling mono- and bivacancies. Using density
functional theory, we found that the phosphorus atom occupies a bridge position
after dissociation of the PBr3 molecule, which primarily bonds to silicon in Cl
bivacancies. These findings provide insight into the interaction of a dopant
containing molecule with an adsorbate monolayer on Si(100) and can be applied
to improve the process of single impurities incorporation into silicon.

<i>Haoyang Ni, William R. Meier, Hu Miao, Andrew J. May, Brian C. Sales, Jian-min Zuo, Miaofang Chi</i>
<p>Intertwining charge density wave (CDW) with spin and pairing order parameters
is a major focus of contemporary condensed matter physics. Lattice distortions
and local symmetry breaking resulted from CDWs are crucial for the emergence of
correlated and topological states in quantum materials in general. While the
presence of CDWs can be detected by diffraction or spectroscopic techniques,
atomic visualization of the CDW induced lattice distortions remains limited to
CDW with short wavelengths. In this letter, we realized the imaging of
incommensurate long-wavelength CDWs based on cryogenic four-dimensional
scanning transmission electron microscopy (cryo-4DSTEM). By visualizing the
incommensurate CDW induced lattice modulations in a skyrmion magnet EuAl4, we
discover two out-of-phase intra-unit cell shear modulations that specifically
break the local inversion-symmetry. Our results provide direct evidence for the
intertwined spin and charge orders in EuAl4 and key information about local
symmetry. Furthermore, we establish cryo-4DSTEM as an indispensable approach to
understand CDW induced new quantum states of matter.

<p>Black phosphorus (bP) is a crystalline material that can be seen as ordered
stackings of two-dimensional layers, which lead to outstanding anisotropic
physical properties. The knowledge of its pressure-temperature (P-T) phase
diagram, and in particular, the slope and location of its melting curve is
fundamental for better understanding the synthesis and stability conditions of
this important material. Despite several experimental studies, important
uncertainties remain in the determination of this melting curve. Here we report
accurate melting points measurements, using in situ high-temperature and
high-pressure high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction. In particular, we
have employed an original and accurate pressure and temperature metrology based
on the unique anisotropic P-T response of bP, that we used as sensor for the
simultaneous determination of pressure and temperature up to 5 GPa and 1700 K.
We confirmed the existence of and located a solid-liquid-liquid triple point at
the intersection of the low- and high-pressure melting curves. Finally, we have
characterized the irreversibility of the transformation in the low-pressure
regime below 1 GPa, as the low-density liquid does not crystallize back to bP
but into red phosphorus on temperature quenching.

<p>We consider a system of non-interacting Brownian particles on the line with
steplike initial condition and study the statistics of the occupation time on
the positive half-line. We demonstrate that this system exhibits long-lasting
memory effects of the initialization. Specifically, we calculate the mean and
the variance of the occupation time, demonstrating that the memory effects in
the variance are determined by a generalized compressibility (or Fano factor),
associated with the initial condition. In the particular case of the
uncorrelated uniform initial condition we conduct a detailed study of two
probability distributions of the occupation time: annealed (averaged over all
possible initial configurations) and quenched (for a typical configuration). We
show that at large times both the annealed and the quenched distributions admit
large deviation form and we compute analytically the associated rate functions.
We verify our analytical predictions via numerical simulations using Importance
Sampling Monte-Carlo strategy.

(Y123) superconductor. For the first time, we found the region from the cleaved
surface that reveals clear bulk electronic properties. The intrinsic Fermi
surface and band structures of Y123 are observed. The Fermi surface-dependent
and momentum-dependent superconducting gap is determined which is nodeless and
consistent with the d+is gap form.

<i>Thomas G. J. Chandler, Saverio E. Spagnolie</i>
<p>Anisotropic fluids appear in a diverse array of systems, from liquid-crystal
displays to bacterial swarms, and are characterized by orientational order.
Large colloidal particles immersed in such environments disturb the medium's
orientational order, however, resulting in a stored elastic energy within the
bulk. As a consequence, multiple immersed bodies interact at equilibrium
through fluid-mediated forces and torques, which depend on the bodies'
positions, orientations, and shapes. We provide the equilibrium configuration
of a model nematic liquid crystal with multiple immersed bodies or inclusions
in two-dimensions, as well as the associated body forces, torques, and surface
tractions. A complex variables approach is taken which leans on previous work
by Crowdy (2020) for describing solutions with multiply-connected domains. Free
periods of a complex director field, which correspond to topological defect
positioning and net topological charge, are determined numerically to minimize
a global stored elastic energy, including a contribution of a weak (finite)
anchoring strength on the body surfaces. Finally, a general, analytical
description of two-body far-field interactions is provided, along with examples
using two cylindrical inclusions of arbitrary position and size, and two
triangles of arbitrary position and orientation.

<p>Twisted bilayers of two-dimensional semiconductors offer a versatile platform
to engineer quantum states for charge carriers using moir\'e superlattice
effects. Among the systems of recent interest are twistronic
MoSe${}_{2}$/WSe${}_{2}$ and MoS${}_{2}$/WS${}_{2}$ heterostructures, which
undergo reconstruction into preferential stacking domains and highly strained
domain wall networks, determining the electron/hole localization across moir\'e
superlattices. Here, we present a catalogue of options for the formation of
self-organized quantum dots and wires in lattice-reconstructed marginally
twisted MoSe${}_{2}$/WSe${}_{2}$ and MoS${}_{2}$/WS${}_{2}$ bilayers, fine
tuned by the twist angle between the monolayers from perfect alignment to
$\theta \sim 1^{\circ}$, and by choosing parallel or anti-parallel orientation
of their unit cells. The proposed scenarios of the quantum dots and wires
formation are found using multi-scale modelling that takes into account the
features of strain textures caused by twirling of domain wall networks.

<p>Refractory metals exhibit high strength at high temperature, but often lack
ductility. Multiprinciple element alloys such as high entropy alloys offer the
potential to improve ductility while maintaining strength, but we don't know
$a-priori$ what compositions will be suitable. A number of measures have been
proposed to predict the ductility of metals, notably the Pugh ratio, the
Rice-Thomson D-parameter, among others. Here we examine direct $ab-initio$
simulation of deformation under tensile strain, and we apply this to a variety
of Nb- and Mo-based binary alloys and to several quaternary alloy systems. Our
results exhibit peak stresses for elastic deformation, beyond which defects
such as lattice slip, stacking faults, transformation, and twinning, relieve
the stress. The peak stress grows strongly with increasing valence electron
count. Correlations are examined among several physical properties, including
the above-mentioned ductility parameters.

<br>
<i>A. Schulz, K. Moch, Y. Hinz, P. Lunkenheimer, R. Böhmer</i>
<p>The glass formation and the dipolar reorientational motions in deep eutectic
solvents (DESs) are frequently overlooked, despite their crucial role in
defining the room-temperature physiochemical properties. To understand the
effects of these dynamics on the ionic conductivity and their relation to the
mechanical properties of the DES, we conducted broadband dielectric and
rheological spectroscopy over a wide temperature range on three
well-established carboxylic-acid-based natural DESs: oxaline, maline, and the
eutectic mixture of choline chloride with phenylacetic acid (phenylaceline). In
all three DESs, we observe signs of glassy freezing in the temperature
dependence of their dipolar reorientational and structural dynamics, as well as
varying degrees of motional decoupling between the different observed dynamics:
Maline and oxaline display a breaking of the Walden rule near the
glass-transition temperature, while the relation between the dc conductivity
and dipolar relaxation time in both maline and phenylaceline is best described
by a power law. The glass-forming properties of the investigated systems not
only govern the orientational dipolar motions and rheological properties, which
are of interest from a fundamental point of view, but they also affect the dc
conductivity, even at room temperature, which is of high technical relevance.

<h3>Energetics, electronic structure and electric polarization of basal  stacking faults in wurtzite GaN and ZnO</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17773" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17773</a>
<br>
<i>Abdesamed Benbedra, Said Meskine, Abdelkader Boukortt, Roland Hayn, Michael Texier, Olivier Thomas, Thomas W. Cornelius</i>
<p>We investigate the effect of basal-plane stacking faults on the structural,
electronic, and polarization properties of wurtzite GaN and ZnO. This
theoretical study is performed within density-functional theory (DFT) using
periodic hexagonal supercells. Both formation energies and band structures are
obtained by means of total-energy calculations. The type-I stacking fault is
observed to have the lowest formation energy, followed by type-II and finally
the extrinsic stacking fault. In order to overcome the inherent shortcoming of
DFT in reproducing band gaps, the generalized-gradient approximation is used in
combination with the modified Becke-Johnson functional. It is shown that all
stacking faults studied maintain a direct gap whose value is lower than that in
the ideal defect-free crystals. The lowering in the band gap allows the
creation of quantum-well regions at wurtzite/zincblende interfaces. In
addition, we provide a consistent set of polarization parameters derived from
the Berry-phase method. We find a trend of decreasing (increasing) spontaneous
polarization and piezoelectric coefficient (polarization charge) in going from
type-I to type-II to extrinsic stacking faults. We compare our results to
experimental and theoretical data available from the literature and explain the
observed trends in terms of the properties of the wurtzite and zincblende
polytypes of both materials.

<h3>Noise Dynamics in the Quantum Regime</h3>

<p>A time-dependent bias voltage on a tunnel junction generates a time-dependent
modulation of its current fluctuations, and in particular of its variance. This
translates into an excitation at frequency $\tilde{f}$ generating correlations
between current fluctuating at any frequency $f$ and at frequency $\pm$
$\tilde{f} -f$. We report the measurement of such a correlation in the fully
quantum regime, i.e. when both frequencies are much greater than $k_BT/h$ with
$T$ the temperature. Such a correlator, usually referred to as the noise
susceptibility, is involved in corrections to the measurements of higher-order
moments and in the squeezing of noise.

<br>
<i>R. Flores-Calderón, Elio J. König, Ashley M. Cook</i>
<p>Symmetry-protected topological phases (SPTs) characterized by short-range
entanglement include many states essential to understanding of topological
condensed matter physics, and the extension to gapless SPTs provides essential
understanding of their consequences. In this work, we identify a fundamental
connection between gapless SPTs and recently-introduced multiplicative
topological phases, demonstrating that multiplicative topological phases are an
intuitive and general approach to realizing concrete models for gapless SPTs.
In particular, they are naturally well-suited to realizing higher-dimensional,
stable, and intrinsic gapless SPTs through combination of canonical topological
insulator and semimetal models with critical gapless models in
symmetry-protected tensor product constructions, opening avenues to far broader
and deeper investigation of topology via short-range entanglement.

<p>The exponential suppression of macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) in the
number of elements to be reconfigured is an essential element of broken
symmetry phases. This suppression is also a core bottleneck in quantum
algorithms, such as traversing an energy landscape in optimization, and
adiabatic state preparation more generally. In this work, we demonstrate
exponential acceleration of MQT through Floquet engineering with the
application of a uniform, high frequency transverse drive field. Using the
ferromagnetic phase of the transverse field Ising model in one and two
dimensions as a prototypical example, we identify three phenomenological
regimes as a function of drive strength. For weak drives, the system exhibits
exponentially decaying tunneling rates but robust magnetic order; in the
crossover regime at intermediate drive strength, we find polynomial decay of
tunnelling alongside vanishing magnetic order; and at very strong drive
strengths both the Rabi frequency and time-averaged magnetic order are
approximately constant with increasing system size. We support these claims
with extensive full wavefunction and tensor network numerical simulations, and
theoretical analysis. An experimental test of these results presents a
technologically important and novel scientific question accessible on NISQ-era
quantum computers.

<i>David Breitbach, Moritz Bechberger, Björn Heinz, Abbass Hamadeh, Khrystyna Levchenko, Bert Lägel, Carsten Dubs, Qi Wang, Roman Verba, Philipp Pirro</i>
<p>Nonlinear phenomena are key for magnon-based information processing, but the
nonlinear interaction between two spin-wave signals requires their
spatio-temporal-overlap which can be challenging for directional processing
devices. Our study focuses on a gallium-substituted yttrium iron garnet film,
which exhibits an exchange-dominated dispersion relation and thus provides a
particularly broad range of group velocities compared to pure YIG. Using time-
and space-resolved Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy, we demonstrate the
excitation of time-separated spin-wave pulses at different frequencies from the
same source, where the delayed pulse catches up with the previously excited
pulse and outruns it due to its higher group velocity. By varying the
excitation power of the faster pulse, the outcome can be finely tuned from a
linear superposition to a nonlinear interaction of both pulses, resulting in a
full attenuation of the slower pulse. Therefore, our findings demonstrate the
all-magnonic erasing process of a propagating magnonic signal, which enables
the realization of complex temporal logic operations with potential
application, e.g., in inhibitory neuromorphic functionalities.

<h3>Dynamic redundancy as a mechanism to optimize collective random searches</h3>

<br>
<i>Daniel Campos, Vicenç Méndez</i>
<p>We explore the case of a group of random walkers looking for a target
randomly located in space, such that the number of walkers is not constant but
new ones can join the search, or those that are active can abandon it, with
constant rates $r_b$ and $r_d$, respectively. Exact analytical solutions are
provided both for the fastest-first-passage time and for the collective search
time required to reach the target, in the seminal case of Brownian walkers with
$r_d=0$. We prove that even for such a simplified situation there exists an
optimal rate $r_b$ at which walkers should join the search to minimize the
collective effort required to reach the target. We discuss how these results
open a new line to understand the optimal regulation of cooperative random
searches, e.g. for the case of biological foraging in social species.

<h3>Diagrammatic Monte Carlo for Dissipative Quantum Impurity Models</h3>

<br>
<i>Matthieu Vanhoecke, Marco Schirò</i>
<p>We develop a diagrammatic Monte Carlo method for the real-time dynamics of
dissipative quantum impurity models. These are small open quantum systems with
interaction and local Markovian dissipation, coupled to a large quantum bath.
Our algorithm sample the hybridization expansion formulated on a single
real-time contour, rather than on the double Keldysh one, as it naturally
arises in the thermofield/vectorized representation of the Lindblad dynamics.
We show that local Markovian dissipation generally helps the convergence of the
diagrammatic Monte Carlo sampling by reducing the sign problem, thus allowing
to reach longer time scales as compared to the conventional unitary case. We
apply our method to an Anderson impurity model in presence of local dephasing
and discuss its effect on the charge and spin dynamics of the impurity.

<h3>Quantum trapping and rotational self-alignment in triangular Casimir  microcavities</h3>

<p>Casimir torque -- a rotational motion caused by the minimization of the
zero-point energy -- is a problem that attracts significant theoretical and
experimental interest. Recently, it has been realized using liquid crystal
phases and natural anisotropic substrates. However, for natural materials, the
torque reaches substantial values only at van der Waals distances of ~10 nm.
Here, we employ Casimir self-assembly using templated gold nanostructures of
triangular symmetry for the purpose of rotational self-alignment at truly
Casimir distances (100 -- 200 nm separation). The joint action of repulsive
electrostatic and attractive Casimir potentials leads to the formation of a
stable quantum trap, giving rise to a tunable Fabry-Perot microcavity. This
cavity self aligns both laterally and rotationally to maximize the overlap area
between the templated and floating triangular flakes. The rotational
self-alignment is remarkably sensitive to the equilibrium distance between the
two triangles as well as their area, which opens possibilities for active
control through manipulating the electrostatic screening. Our self-assembled
and self-aligned Casimir microcavities could find future use as a versatile and
tunable platform for nanophotonic, polaritonic, and optomechanical
applications.

<p>Active particles, which are self-propelled nonequilibrium systems, are
modelled by overdamped Langevin equations with colored noise, emulating the
self-propulsion. In this chapter, we present a review of the theoretical
results for the target search problem of these particles. We focus on three
most well-known models, namely, run-and-tumble particles, active Brownian
particles, and direction reversing active Brownian particles, which differ in
their self-propulsion dynamics. For each of these models, we discuss the
first-passage and survival probabilities in the presence of an absorbing
target. We also discuss how resetting helps the active particles find targets
in a finite time.

<h3>$\mathbb{Z}_{2}=0$ is topological too</h3>

<i>Chao Lei, Perry T. Mahon, Allan H. MacDonald</i>
<p>The electronic ground state of a three-dimensional (3D) band insulator with
time-reversal ($\Theta$) symmetry or time-reversal times a discrete translation
($\Theta T_{1/2}$) symmetry is classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-valued
topological invariant and characterized by quantized magnetoelectric response.
Here we demonstrate by explicit calculation in model $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
topological insulator thin-films that whereas the magnetoelectric response is
localized at the surface in the $\Theta$ symmetry (non-magnetic) case, it is
non-universally partitioned between surface and interior contributions in the
$\Theta T_{1/2}$ (anti-ferromagnetic) case, while remaining quantized. Within
our model the magnetic field induced polarization arises entirely from an
anomalous ${\cal N}=0$ Landau level subspace within which the projected
Hamiltonian is a generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model whose topological
properties are consistent with those of the starting 3D model.

<p>Controlled fabrication of nanopores in atomically thin two-dimensional
material offers the means to create robust membranes needed for ion transport,
nanofiltration, and DNA sensing. Techniques for creating nanopores have relied
upon either plasma etching or direct irradiation using electrons or ions;
however, aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)
offers the advantage of combining a highly energetic, sub-angstrom sized
electron beam for atomic manipulation along with atomic resolution imaging.
Here, we utilize a method for automated nanopore fabrication with real-time
atomic visualization to enhance our mechanistic understanding of beam-induced
transformations. Additionally, an electron beam simulation technique,
Electron-Beam Simulator (E-BeamSim) was developed to observe the atomic
movements and interactions resulting from electron beam irradiation. Using the
2D MXene Ti3C2Tx, we explore the influence of temperature on nanopore
fabrication by tracking atomic transformation pathways and find that at room
temperature, electron beam irradiation induces random displacement of atoms and
results in a pileup of titanium atoms at the nanopore edge. This pileup was
confirmed and demonstrated in E-BeamSim simulations around the small, milled
area in the MXene monolayer. At elevated temperatures, the surface functional
groups on MXene are effectively removed, and the mobility of atoms increases,
which results in atomic transformations that lead to the selective removal of
atoms layer by layer. Through controllable manufacture using e-beam milling
fabrication, the production and then characterization of the fabricated defects
can be better understood for future work. This work can lead to the development
of defect engineering techniques within functionalized MXene layers.

<br>
<i>Santiago Galván y García, Yonatan Betancur-Ocampo, Francisco Sánchez-Ochoa, Thomas Stegmann</i>
<p>We demonstrate that the current flow in graphene can be guided on atomically
thin current pathways by means of the engineering of Kekul\'e-O distortions. A
grain boundary in these distortions separates the system into topological
distinct regions and induces a ballistic domain-wall state. The state does not
depend on the precise orientation of the grain boundary with respect to the
graphene sublattice and therefore, permits to guide the current on arbitrary
paths through the system. As the state is gapped, the current flow can be
switched by electrostatic gates. Our findings can be explained by a
generalization of the Jackiw-Rebbi model, where the electrons behave in one
region of the system as fermions with an effective complex mass, making the
device not only promising for technological applications but also a test-ground
for concepts from high-energy physics. An atomic model supported by DFT
calculations demonstrates that the proposed system can be realized by
decorating graphene with Ti atoms.

<h3>Mysteries of supercooled water elucidated by studies of aqueous  solutions</h3>

<p>The most abundant form of water in the universe probably is its supercooled
state, staying non-crystalline down to lowest temperatures. The many
peculiarities of liquid water, like its partly negative thermal expansion, have
been traced back to prominent anomalies occurring in its supercooled form -
especially under elevated pressure - and to the presence of two variants of
supercooled water and of amorphous, glassy ice. However, the bare existence of
these different liquid states and of a related liquid-liquid crossover at
ambient pressure are controversially debated since decades, just as the
absolute value of water's glass-transition temperature. Their direct
experimental detection is hampered by the inevitable crystallization of pure
water in a certain temperature range, termed "no-man's land". To tackle these
problems, we have applied dielectric spectroscopy and differential scanning
calorimetry to aqueous LiCl solutions. By covering a frequency range of up to
14 decades and by quenching some of the solutions to avoid crystallization,
here we show that there are indeed strong hints at two forms of water,
occurring in different temperature ranges and having different glass-transition
temperatures, even at ambient pressure: A so-called "fragile" liquid,
characterized by super-Arrhenius temperature dependence of the molecular
dynamics at high temperatures, and a "strong" liquid, nearly following
Arrhenius behaviour, at low temperatures.

<p>The family of cubic noncentrosymmetric 3-4-3 compounds has become a fertile
ground for the discovery of novel correlated metallic and insulating phases.
Here, we report the synthesis of a new heavy fermion compound,
Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$. It is an isoelectronic analog of the prototypical Kondo
insulator Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pt$_3$ and of the recently discovered Weyl-Kondo
semimetal Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pd$_3$. In contrast to the volume-preserving Pt-Pd
substitution, structural and chemical analyses reveal a positive chemical
pressure effect in Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$ relative to its heavier counterparts.
Based on the results of electrical resistivity, Hall effect, magnetic
susceptibility, and specific heat measurements, we identify an energy gap of
65-70 meV, about 8 times larger than that in Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pt$_3$ and about 45
times larger than that of the Kondo-insulating background hosting the Weyl
nodes in Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pd$_3$. We show that this gap as well as other physical
properties do not evolve monotonically with increasing atomic number, i.e., in
the sequence Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$-Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pd$_3$-Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pt$_3$, but
instead with increasing partial electronic density of states of the $d$
orbitals at the Fermi energy. To understand under which condition topological
states form in these materials is a topic for future studies.

<p>Generative design marks a significant data-driven advancement in the
exploration of novel inorganic materials, which entails learning the symmetry
equivalent to the crystal structure prediction (CSP) task and subsequent
learning of their target properties. Many generative models have been developed
in the last few years. However, these models so far lack the capacity to
produce crystals that obey the fundamental rules of crystal symmetry. This is
because an important step in these previous approaches involves energy
relaxation on the generated crystal structures to find the ground state crystal
structure, typically using Density Functional Theory (DFT). More often than
not, this changes the symmetry of the structure, thereby changing the desired
property and hence invalidating the original CSP. To address this, we introduce
a generative design framework (WyCryst), composed of three pivotal components:
1) a Wyckoff position based inorganic crystal representation, 2) a
property-directed VAE model and 3) an automated DFT workflow for structure
refinement. By implementing loss functions that punish non-realistic crystal
structures, our model selectively generates materials that follow the ground
truth of crystal symmetry in the form of Wyckoff representation for each Space
Group. In leave-one-out validation experiments, we successfully reproduce a
variety of existing materials: CaTiO3 (space group, SG No. 62 and 221), CsPbI3
(SG No. 221), BaTiO3 (SG No. 160), and CuInS2 (SG No.122) for both ground state
as well as polymorphic crystal structure predictions for desired compositions.
We also generate several new ternary materials not found in the inorganic
materials database (Materials Project), which are proved to be stable,
retaining their symmetry, and we also check their phonon stability, using our
automated DFT workflow highlighting the validity of our approach.

<h3>Autoencoder-based analytic continuation method for strongly correlated  quantum systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Maksymilian Kliczkowski, Lauren Keyes, Sayantan Roy, Thereza Paiva, Mohit Randeria, Nandini Trivedi, Maciej M. Maska</i>
<p>The single particle Green's function provides valuable information on the
momentum and energy-resolved spectral properties for a strongly correlated
system. In large-scale numerical calculations using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC),
dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), including cluster-DMFT, one usually obtains
the Green's function in imaginary-time $G(\tau)$. The process of inverting a
Laplace transform to obtain the spectral function $A(\omega)$ in real-frequency
is an ill-posed problem and forms the core of the analytic continuation
problem. In this Letter, we propose to use a completely unsupervised
autoencoder-type neural network to solve the analytic continuation problem. We
introduce an encoder-decoder approach that, together with only minor physical
assumptions, can extract a high-quality frequency response from the imaginary
time domain. With a deeply tunable architecture, this method can, in principle,
locate sharp features of spectral functions that might normally be lost using
already well-established methods, such as maximum entropy (MaxEnt) methods. We
demonstrate the strength of the autoencoder approach by applying it to QMC
results of $G(\tau)$ for a single-band Hubbard model. The proposed method is
general and can also be applied to other ill-posed inverse problems.
