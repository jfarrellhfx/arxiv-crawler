<h3>Predicting and Interpreting Energy Barriers of Metallic Glasses with  Graph Neural Networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08627" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08627</a>
<br>
<i>Haoyu Li, Shichang Zhang, Longwen Tang, Mathieu Bauchy, Yizhou Sun</i>
<p>Metallic Glasses (MGs) are widely used disordered materials. Understanding
the relationship between the local structure and physical properties of MGs is
one of the greatest challenges for both material science and condensed matter
physics. In this work, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the
atomic graph structure and study the connection between the structure and the
corresponding local energy barrier, which is believed to govern many critical
physical properties in MGs. One of our key contributions is to propose a novel
Symmetrized GNN (SymGNN) model for predicting the energy barriers, which is
invariant under orthogonal transformations of the structure, e.g., rotations
and reflections. Such invariance is a desired property that standard GNNs like
Graph Convolutional Networks cannot capture. SymGNNs handle the invariance by
aggregating over orthogonal transformations of the graph structure for
representation learning, and an optimal distribution over all 3D orthogonal
transformations $\mathcal{O}_3$ is learned to maximize the benefit of
invariance. We demonstrate in our experiments that SymGNN can significantly
improve the energy barrier prediction over other GNNs and non-graph machine
learning models. With such an accurate model, we also apply graph explanation
algorithms to better reveal the structure-property relationship of MGs. Our GNN
framework allows effective prediction of material physical properties and
bolsters material science research through the use of AI models.

<h3>Comment on "Shot noise in a strange metal"</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08681" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08681</a>
<br>
<i>B.A. Polyak, E.S. Tikhonov, V.S. Khrapai</i>
<p>The recent paper [Science 382, 907 (2023)] reports on the measurements of
shot noise in the heavy fermion strange metal YbRh2Si2 patterned into the
nanowire shape. The authors claim that the observed shot noise suppression can
not be attributed to the electron-phonon energy relaxation in a standard Fermi
liquid model but rather indicates the failure of quasiparticle concept. In this
comment, we discuss the inconsistency in the resistivity extracted from
nanowire devices of different length which may turn out crucial in the analysis
of shot noise suppression due to the possible contribution of spreading
resistance.

<h3>Gapless Fermionic Systems as Phase-space Topological Insulators:  Non-perturbative Results from Anomalies</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08744" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08744</a>
<br>
<i>Taylor L. Hughes, Yuxuan Wang</i>
<p>We present a theory unifying the topological responses and anomalies of
various gapless fermion systems exhibiting Fermi surfaces, including those with
Berry phases, and nodal structures, which applies beyond non-interacting limit.
As our key finding, we obtain a general approach to directly relate gapless
fermions and topological insulators in phase space, including first- and
higher-order insulators. Using this relation we show that the low-energy
properties and response theories for gapless fermionic systems can be directly
obtained without resorting to microscopic details. Our results provide a
unified framework for describing such systems using well-developed theories
from the study of topological phases of matter.

<h3>New Approach to Strong Correlation: Twisting Hubbard into the Orbital  Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08746" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08746</a>
<br>
<i>Peizhi Mai, Jinchao Zhao, Gaurav Tenkila, Nico A. Hackner, Dhruv Kush, Derek Pan, Philip W. Phillips</i>
<p>Based on the surprising observation that all the correlation functions in the
local-in-momentum space Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model fall off exponentially with
distance, we show that the $N_\alpha$-orbital extension has a fundamental
connection with the Hubbard model. Namely, for $N_\alpha$-orbitals on each of
the $N$ ${\bf k}$-points and dynamics between the orbital degrees of freedom,
the $N_\alpha$-orbital HK model is equivalent to covering the Brillouin zone
with $N/N_\alpha$ Hubbard clusters each containing $N_\alpha$-sites all
connected via twisted boundary conditions. The thermodynamic limit arises from
the ${\bf k}$-state starting point of the HK model. While the Hubbard model
necessarily results when $N_\alpha=N$, we show that already at $N_\alpha=2,4$,
standard results for the Hubbard model emerge, such as the onset of an
insulating state regardless of the strength of the interactions, double
occupancy, dynamical spectral weight transfer, charge neutral excitations
leading to the algebraic temperature dependence of the specific heat, all with
a fraction of the computational time of more advanced cluster methods and
making it possible to obtain analytical insights. Consequently, the
$N_\alpha$-orbital HK model offers a new tool for strongly correlated quantum
matter.

<h3>Deconfined Fermi liquid to Fermi liquid transition and superconducting  instability</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08753" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08753</a>
<br>
<i>Xiaofan Wu, Hui Yang, Ya-Hui Zhang</i>
<p>Deconfined quantum critical points (DQCP) have attracted lots of attentions
in the past decades, but were mainly restricted to incompressible phases. On
the other hand, various experimental puzzles call for new theory of
unconventional quantum criticality between metals at a generic density. Here we
explore the possibility of a deconfined transition between two symmetric Fermi
liquids in a bilayer model tuned by inter-layer antiferromagnetic spin-spin
coupling $J_\perp$. Across the transition the Fermi surface volume per flavor
jumps by $1/2$ of the Brillouin zone (BZ), similar to the small to large Fermi
surface transitions in heavy Fermion systems and maybe also in the high Tc
cuprates. But in the bilayer case the small Fermi surface phase (dubbed as sFL)
has neither symmetry breaking nor fractionalization, akin to the symmetric mass
generation (SMG) discussed in high energy physics. We formulate a deconfined
critical theory where the two Fermi liquids correspond to higgs and/or confined
phases of a $U(1)\times U(1)$ gauge theory. We show that this deconfined FL to
FL transition (DFFT) fixed point is unstable to pairing and thus a
superconductor dome is expected at low temperature. At finite temperature above
the pairing scale, microscopic electron is a three particle bound state of the
deconfined fractional fermions in the critical theory. We also introduce
another parameter which can suppress the pairing instability, leading to a
deconfined tri-critical point stable to zero temperature. We also provide
numerical results of the bilayer model in one dimension, with a Luther-Emery
liquid between two different Luttinger liquids, similar to the phase diagram
from the field theory in two dimension. Our work opens a new direction to
exploring deconfined metallic criticality and new pairing mechanism from
critical gauge field.

<h3>A tool to check whether a symmetry-compensated collinear magnetic  material is antiferro- or altermagnetic</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08784" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08784</a>
<br>
<i>Andriy Smolyanyuk, Libor Šmejkal, Igor I. Mazin</i>
<p>Altermagnets (AM) is a recently discovered class of collinear magnets that
share some properties (anomalous transport, etc) with ferromagnets, some (zero
net magnetization) with antiferromagnets, while also exhibiting unique
properties (spin-splitting of electronic bands and resulting spin-splitter
current). Since the moment compensation in AM is driven by symmetry, it must be
possible to identify them by analyzing the crystal structure directly, without
computing the electronic structure. Given the significant potential of AM for
spintronics, it is very useful to have a tool for such an analysis. This work
presents an open-access code implementing such a direct check.

<h3>Switching plane: A novel crystalline interface in orthorhombic  perovskite films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08798" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08798</a>
<br>
<i>Duncan T.L. Alexander, Hugo Meley, Michael Marcus Schmitt, Bernat Mundet, Philippe Ghosez, Jean-Marc Triscone, Stefano Gariglio</i>
<p>The atomic configuration of phases and their interfaces is fundamental to
materials design and engineering. Here, we unveil a novel crystalline
interface, whose formation is driven by energetic influences that compete in
determining the orientation of an orthorhombic perovskite film. Observed within
LaVO$_3$ grown on $(101)_{\text{orth}}$ DyScO$_3$, the film resolves this
competition by switching its orientation at an atomically-flat plane within its
volume, not at the film-substrate interface. Remarkably, at either side of this
switching plane, characteristic orthorhombic distortions tend to zero to couple
mismatched atomic structures. The resulting boundary is highly energetic; by
using second-principles modeling to map the phase space of film growth, we show
how its formation requires structural relaxation of an entire film grown beyond
a significant critical thickness. This structural-energetic phenomenon opens
avenues towards engineering new functional interfaces, offering the opportunity
of contacting distinct phases of one compound that would never otherwise
coexist.

<h3>Ultrafast chiral precession of spin and orbital angular momentum induced  by circularly polarized laser pulse</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08813" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08813</a>
<br>
<i>Junjie He, Shuo Li, Thomas Fruenheim</i>
<p>Despite spin (SAM) and orbital (OAM) angular momentum dynamics are
well-studied in demagnetization processes, their components receive less focus.
Here, we utilize the non-collinear spin version of real-time time-dependent
density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) to unveil significant x and y components
of SAM and OAM induced by circularly left and right polarized laser pulse in
Ferromagnetic Fe, Co and Ni. Our results show that the magnitude of OAM is an
order of magnitude larger than that of SAM, highlighting a stronger optical
response from the orbital degrees of freedom of electrons compared to spin.
Additionally, we observe a marked dependency of the oscillations of the x and y
components on the helicity of the pulse. Intriguingly, left and right polarized
pulses induce chirality in the precession of SAM and OAM, respectively, with
clear associations with laser frequency and duration. Finally, we demonstrate
that the time scale of OAM and SAM precession occurs even earlier than that of
the demagnetization process and OISTR effect. Our investigation provides
detailed insight into the dynamics of SAM and OAM of electrons during and
shortly after a circularly polarized laser excitation.

<h3>Control of charge-spin interconversion in van der Waals heterostructures  with chiral charge density waves</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08817" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08817</a>

<i>Zhendong Chi, Seungjun Lee, Haozhe Yang, Eoin Dolan, C. K. Safeer, Josep Ingla-Aynés, Franz Herling, Nerea Ontoso, Beatriz Martín-García, Marco Gobbi, Tony Low, Luis E. Hueso, Fèlix Casanova</i>
<p>A charge density wave (CDW) represents an exotic state in which electrons are
arranged in a long range ordered pattern in low-dimensional materials. Although
our understanding of the fundamental character of CDW has been enriched after
extensive studies, its relationship with functional phenomena remains
relatively limited. Here, we show an unprecedented demonstration of a tunable
charge-spin interconversion (CSI) in graphene/1T-TaS$_2$ van der Waals
heterostructures by manipulating the distinct CDW phases in 1T-TaS$_2$. Whereas
CSI from spins polarized in all three directions are observed in the
heterostructure when the CDW phase does not show commensurability, the output
of one of the components disappears and the other two are enhanced when the CDW
phase becomes commensurate. The experimental observation is supported by
first-principles calculations, which evidence that chiral CDW multidomains are
at the origin of the switching of CSI. Our results uncover a new approach for
on-demand CSI in low-dimensional systems, paving the way for advanced
spin-orbitronic devices.

<h3>Lateral plasmonic crystals: Tunability, dark modes, and weak-to-strong  coupling transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08826" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08826</a>
<br>
<i>I. V. Gorbenko, V.Yu. Kachorovskii</i>
<p>We study transmission of the terahertz radiation through a two-dimensional
electron gas with a concentration controlled by grating gate electrodes.
Voltage applied to these electrodes creates a lateral plasmonic crystal with a
gate-tunable band structure. We find that only a part of plasmonic modes of
such a crystal is seen in the transmission spectrum for the case of homogeneous
excitation (so-called bright modes), while there also exist dark modes which
show up only in a case of inhomogeneous excitation. We develop a theory that
describes both weak- to strong- coupling transition in the crystal with
increasing depth of the density modulation and a transition from resonant to
super-resonant regime with increasing quality factor of the structure. We
discuss very recent experiment, where transmission of the terahertz radiation
through GaN/AlGaN based grating gate periodic structures was studied. We argue
that this experiment represents an evidence of formation of the lateral
plasmonic crystal with the band structure fully controlled by the gate
electrodes and magnetic field, in a full agreement with developed theory.

<h3>Structure and lattice excitations of the copper substituted lead  oxyapatite Pb$_{9.06(7)}$Cu$_{0.94(6)}$(PO$_{3.92(4)}$)$_{6}$O$_{0.96(3)}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08834" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08834</a>
<br>
<i>Qiang Zhang, Yingdong Guan, Yongqiang Cheng, Lujin Min, Jong K. Keum, Zhiqiang Mao, Matthew B. Stone</i>
<p>The copper substituted lead oxyapatite,
Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_{x}$(PO$_{3.92(4)}$)$_{6}$O$_{0.96(3)}$ (x=0.94(6)) was studied
using neutron and x-ray diffraction and neutron spectroscopy techniques. The
crystal structure of the main phase of our sample, which has come to be
colloquially known as LK-99, is verified to possess a hexagonal structure with
space group $P 6_{3}/m$, alongside the presence of impurity phases Cu and
Cu$_2$S. We determine the primary substitution location of the Cu as the Pb1
($6h$) site, with a small substitution at the Pb2 ($4f$) site. Consequently, no
clear Cu-doping-induced structural distortion was observed in the investigated
temperature region between 10~K and 300~K. Specially, we did not observe a
reduction of coordinate number at the Pb2 site or a clear tilting of PO$_4$
tetrahedron. Magnetic characterization reveals a diamagnetic signal in the
specimen, accompanied by a very weak ferromagnetic component at 2 K. No
long-range magnetic order down to 10 K was detected by the neutron diffraction.
Inelastic neutron scattering measurements did not show magnetic excitations for
energies up to 350 meV. There is no sign of a superconducting resonance in the
excitation spectrum of this material. The measured phonon density of states
compares well with density functional theory calculations performed for the
main LK-99 phase and its impurity phases. Our study may shed some insight into
the role of the favored substitution site of copper in the absence of
structural distortion and superconductivity in LK-99.

<h3>Hamiltonian formulation of the maximal valence model for liquid  polyamorphism</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08882" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08882</a>
<br>
<i>Sergey V. Buldyrev</i>
<p>Liquid-liquid phase transitions have been found experimentally or proposed to
exist based on computer simulations in many compounds such as water, hydrogen,
sulfur, phosphorus, carbon, silica, and silicon. Recently introduced maximal
valence model implemented via discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) provides simple
generic mechanism of the liquid-liquid phase transitions for all these diverse
cases. Here we will show that certain variants of the maximal valence model
have a well defined Hamiltonian i.e a unique algorithm by which the potential
energy of the system of particles can be computed solely from the coordinates
of the particles and is thus equivalent to a complex multi-body potential. We
will present several examples of the model which can be used to reproduce
liquid-liquid phase transition in systems with maximal valence $z=1$
(hydrogen), $z=2$ (sulfur) and $z=4$ (water), where $z$ is the maximal valence,
i.e. the maximal number of bonds an atom is allowed to have. The maximal
valence model can be modified to forbid not only too large valences but also
too low valences. In the case of sulfur, we forbid also the formation of
monomers, thus restricting the valence $v$ of an atom to be within an interval
$1=v_{min}\leq v\leq v_{max}\equiv z=2$.

<h3>Extreme Metastability of Diamond and its Transformation to BC8  Post-Diamond Phase of Carbon</h3>

<p>Diamond possesses exceptional physical properties due to its remarkably
strong carbon-carbon bonding, leading to significant resilience to structural
transformations at very high pressures and temperatures. Despite several
experimental attempts, synthesis and recovery of the theoretically predicted
post-diamond BC8 phase remains elusive. Through quantum accurate, multi-million
atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we have uncovered the extreme
metastability of diamond at very high pressures, significantly exceeding its
range of thermodynamic stability. We predict the post-diamond BC8 phase to be
experimentally accessible only within a narrow high pressure-temperature region
of the carbon phase diagram. The diamond to BC8 transformation proceeds through
pre-melting followed by BC8 nucleation and growth in the metastable carbon
liquid. We propose a double-shock compression pathway to achieve BC8 synthesis,
which is currently being explored in theory-inspired experiments at the
National Ignition Facility.

<h3>Heterogeneous attenuation of sound waves in three-dimensional amorphous  solids</h3>

<i>Shivam Mahajan, Massimo Pica Ciamarra</i>
<p>Sound waves are attenuated as they propagate in amorphous materials. We
investigate the mechanism driving sound attenuation in the Rayleigh scattering
regime by resolving the dynamics of an excited phonon in time and space via
numerical simulations. We find sound attenuation is spatiotemporal
heterogeneous. It starts in localised regions, which identify soft regions
within the material and correlate with low-frequency vibrational modes. As time
progresses, the regions where sound is primarily attenuated invade the system
via an apparent diffusive process.

<h3>Topological charge pumping in dimerized Kitaev chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08934" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08934</a>
<br>
<i>E. S. Ma, Z. Song</i>
<p>We investigated the topological pumping charge of a dimerized Kitaev chain
with spatially modulated chemical potential, which hosts nodal loops in
parameter space and violates particle number conservation. In the simplest
case, with alternatively assigned hopping and pairing terms, we show that the
model can be mapped into the Rice-Mele model by a partial particle-hole
transformation and subsequently supports topological charge pumping as a
demonstration of the Chern number for the ground state. Beyond this special
case, analytic analysis shows that the nodal loops are conic curves. Numerical
simulation of a finite-size chain indicates that the pumping charge is zero for
a quasiadiabatic loop within the nodal loop and is $\pm 1$ for a quasiadiabatic
passage enclosing the nodal loop. Our findings unveil a hidden topology in a
class of Kitaev chains.

<h3>Spin Orbit Torque on a Curved Surface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08966" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08966</a>
<br>
<i>Seng Ghee Tan, Che Chun Huang, Mansoor B.A.Jalil, Zhuobin Siu</i>
<p>We provide a general formulation of the spin-orbit coupling on a 2D curved
surface. Considering the wide applicability of spin-orbit effect in
spinor-based condensed matter physics, a general spin-orbit formulation could
aid the study of spintronics, Dirac graphene, topological systems, and quantum
information on curved surfaces. Particular attention is then devoted to the
development of an important spin-orbit quantity known as the spin-orbit torque.
As devices trend smaller in dimension, the physics of local geometries on
spin-orbit torque, hence spin and magnetic dynamics shall not be neglected. We
derived the general expression of a spin-orbit anisotropy field for the curved
surfaces and provided explicit solutions in the special contexts of the
spherical, cylindrical and flat coordinates. Our expressions allow spin-orbit
anisotropy fields and hence spin-orbit torque to be computed over the entire
surfaces of devices of any geometry.

<h3>Luttinger Liquid phase in the Aubry-André Hubbard chain</h3>

<br>
<i>Runze Chi, Josephine J. Yu, Chaitanya Murthy, T. Xiang</i>
<p>We study the interplay between an on-site Hubbard repulsion and quasiperiodic
potential in one-dimensional fermion chains using the density matrix
renormalization group. We find that, at half-filling, the quasiperiodic
potential can destroy the Mott gap, leading to a metallic Luttinger liquid
phase between the gapped Mott insulator at strong repulsion and localized
gapless Aubry- Andr\'e insulator at strong quasiperiodic potential. Away from
half-filing, the metallic phase of the interacting model persists to larger
critical strengths of the potential than in the non-interacting case,
suggesting interaction-stabilized delocalization at finite doping. We
characterize the Luttinger liquid through its charge and spin correlations,
structure factors, and entanglement entropy.

<h3>Robust flat bands in twisted trilayer graphene quasicrystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09010" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09010</a>
<br>
<i>Chen-Yue Hao, Zhen Zhan, Pierre A. Pantaleón, Jia-Qi He, Ya-Xin Zhao, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Francisco Guinea, Lin He</i>
<p>Moir\'e structures formed by twisting three layers of graphene with two
independent twist angles present an ideal platform for studying correlated
quantum phenomena, as an infinite set of angle pairs is predicted to exhibit
flat bands. Moreover, the two mutually incommensurate moir\'e patterns among
the twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) can form highly tunable moir\'e
quasicrystals. This enables us to extend correlated physics in periodic moir\'e
crystals to quasiperiodic systems. However, direct local characterization of
the structure of the moir\'e quasicrystals and of the resulting flat bands are
still lacking, which is crucial to fundamental understanding and control of the
correlated moir\'e physics. Here, we demonstrate the existence of flat bands in
a series of TTGs with various twist angle pairs and show that the TTGs with
different magic angle pairs are strikingly dissimilar in their atomic and
electronic structures. The lattice relaxation and the interference between
moir\'e patterns are highly dependent on the twist angles. Our direct spatial
mappings, supported by theoretical calculations, reveal that the localization
of the flat bands exhibits distinct symmetries in different regions of the
moir\'e quasicrystals.

<h3>Controlling Orbital Magnetism of Band Electron Systems via Bath  Engineering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09100" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09100</a>
<br>
<i>Subrata Chakraborty, So Takei</i>
<p>The effects of bath-induced dissipation on the orbital diamagnetism of band
electrons are studied using the gauge-invariant Keldysh Green function
formalism. Orbital diamagnetism is a quantum phenomenon that arises from the
coherent cyclotron motion of the electrons. The system-bath entanglement is
expected to disrupt this coherent electronic motion and quench orbital
diamagnetism. Here, we show that a suitably-tailored bath can lead to an
enhancement of the orbital diamagnetic susceptibility of a multi-band electron
system and can even convert a paramagnetic response into a diamagnetic one as
the system-bath coupling is increased. Furthermore, we demonstrate how van Hove
singularities in the bath density of states can be exploited to generate a
giant enhancement of the orbital magnetic susceptibility. Our work opens doors
to the possibility of controlling the orbital magnetic response of band
electron systems through bath engineering.

<h3>Dark-Bright Exciton Splitting Dominates Low-Temperature Diffusion in  Halide Perovskite Nanocrystal Assemblies</h3>

<br>
<i>Andreas J. Bornschlegl, Michael F. Lichtenegger, Leo Luber, Carola Lampe, Maryna I. Bodnarchuk, Maksym V. Kovalenko, Alexander S. Urban</i>
<p>Semiconductor nanocrystals could replace conventional bulk materials
completely in displays and light-emitting diodes. Exciton transport dominates
over charge carrier transport for materials with high exciton binding energies
and long ligands, such as halide perovskite nanocrystal films. Here, we
investigate how beneficial superlattices - nearly perfect 3D nanocrystal
assemblies of nanocrystals are to exciton transport. Surprisingly, the high
degree of order is not as crucial as the individual nanocrystal size, which
strongly influences the splitting of the excitonic manifold into bright and
dark states. At very low temperatures, the energetic splitting is large for the
smallest nanocrystals, and dark levels with low oscillator strength effectively
trap excitons inside individual nanocrystals, suppressing diffusion. The effect
is reversed at elevated temperatures, and the larger NC size becomes
detrimental to exciton transport due to enhanced exciton trapping and
dissociation. Our results reveal that the nanocrystal size must be strongly
accounted for in design strategies of future optoelectronic applications.

<i>Kay Joerg Wiese</i>
<p>We use an exact mapping of the Manna model, or equivalently conserved
directed percolation, onto disordered elastic manifolds at depinning to show
that particle-density fluctuations in these two models are hyperuniform. The
structure factor of the particle density behaves for small $q$ as $S(q)\sim
|q|^\sigma$ with $\sigma={4-d-2\zeta}$, where $\zeta$ is the roughness exponent
at depinning. In dimension $d=1$, $\sigma=1/2$, while for all dimensions $0.6>
\sigma\ge0$. Our results fit well known simulations in the literature, except
in $d=1$, where we perform our own simulations to confirm our findings.

<p>The prediction of mechanical and thermal properties of polymers is a critical
aspect for polymer development. Herein, we discuss the use of transfer learning
approach to predict multiple properties of linear polymers. The neural network
model is initially trained to predict the heat capacity in constant pressure
(Cp) of linear polymers. Once, the pre-trained model is transferred to predict
four additional properties of polymers: specific heat capacity (Cv), shear
modulus, flexural stress strength at yield, and tensile creep compliance. They
represent a diverse set of mechanical, thermal, and rheological properties. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by achieving high accuracy in
predicting the four additional properties using relatively small datasets of 13
to 18 samples. Also, the performance of the base model is examined using five
different loss functions. Our results suggest that the combined loss function
had better performance compared to the individual loss functions.

<p>Altermagnetic (AM) materials exhibit non-relativistic, momentum-dependent
spin-split states, ushering in new opportunities for spin electronic devices.
While the characteristics of spin-splitting have been documented within the
framework of the non-relativistic spin group sym-metry, there has been limited
exploration of the inclusion of relativistic symmetry and its im-pact on the
emergence of a novel spin-splitting in the band structure. This study delves
into the intricate relativistic electronic structure of an AM material,
{\alpha}-MnTe. Employing temperature-dependent angle-resolved photoelectron
spectroscopy across the AM phase transition, we elucidate the emergence of a
relativistic valence band splitting concurrent with the establish-ment of
magnetic order. This discovery is validated through disordered local moment
calcula-tions, modeling the influence of magnetic order on the electronic
structure and confirming the magnetic origin of the observed splitting. The
temperature-dependent splitting is ascribed to the advent of relativistic
spin-splitting resulting from the strengthening of AM order in {\alpha}-MnTe as
the temperature decreases. This sheds light on a previously unexplored facet of
this intri-guing material.

<h3>Interface Dynamics of Strongly interacting Binary Superfluids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09189" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09189</a>
<br>

<p>Understanding the interface dynamics in non-equilibrium quantum systems
remains a challenge. We study the interface dynamics of strongly coupled
immiscible binary superfluids by using holographic duality. The full nonlinear
evolution of the binary superfluids with a relative velocity shows rich
nonlinear patterns toward quantum turbulence, which is reminiscent of the
quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The wave number of the fast growing modes
$k_0$ extracted from the interface pattern yields a non-monotonic dependence of
the relative velocity, independent of the temperature and interaction. The
value of $k_0$ first increases with the velocity difference and then decreases,
which stands in sharp contrast to the results of mean-field theory described by
the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and is confirmed by using the linear analyses on
top of the stationary configuration. We uncover that the critical velocity
associated with the maximum correspond to the case when the mean separation of
vortices generated by interface instabilities becomes comparable to the vortex
size, which could be a universal physical mechanism at strongly interacting
superfluids and is directly testable in laboratory experiments.

<h3>Role of Elastic Phonon Couplings in Dictating the Thermal Transport  across Atomically Sharp SiC/Si Interfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09212" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09212</a>
<br>
<i>Qinqin He, Yixin Xu, Haidong Wang, Zhigang Li, Yanguang Zhou</i>
<p>Wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductors have promising applications in power
electronics due to their high voltages, radio frequencies, and tolerant
temperatures. Among all the WBG semiconductors, SiC has attracted attention
because of its high mobility, high thermal stability, and high thermal
conductivity. However, the interfaces between SiC and the corresponding
substrate largely affect the performance of SiC-based electronics. It is
therefore necessary to understand and design the interfacial thermal transport
across the SiC/substrate interfaces, which is critical for the thermal
management design of these SiC-based power electronics. This work
systematically investigates heat transfer across the 3C-SiC/Si, 4H-SiC/Si, and
6H-SiC/Si interfaces using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and
diffuse mismatch model. We find that the room temperature ITC for 3C-SiC/Si,
4H-SiC/Si, and 6H-SiC/Si interfaces is 932 MW/m2K, 759 MW/m2K, and 697 MW/m2K,
respectively. We also show the contribution of the ITC resulting from elastic
scatterings at room temperature is 80% for 3C-SiC/Si interfaces, 85% for
4H-SiC/Si interfaces, and 82% for 6H-SiC/Si interfaces, respectively. We
further find the ITC contributed by the elastic scattering decreases with the
temperature but remains at a high ratio of 67%~78% even at an ultrahigh
temperature of 1000 K. The reason for such a high elastic ITC is the large
overlap between the vibrational density of states of Si and SiC at low
frequencies (< ~ 18 THz), which is also demonstrated by the diffuse mismatch
mode. It is interesting to find that the inelastic ITC resulting from the
phonons with frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency of Si (i.e., ~18 THz)
can be negligible. That may be because of the wide frequency gap between Si and
SiC, which makes the inelastic scattering among these phonons challenging to
meet the energy and momentum conservation rules.

<h3>Antipersistent energy current correlations in strong long-ranged  Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou type models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09213" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09213</a>
<br>
<i>Daxing Xiong, Jianjin Wang</i>
<p>We study heat transfer in one-dimensional Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou type
systems with long-range (LR) interactions. The strength of the LR interaction
between two lattice sites decays as a power $\sigma$ of the inverse of their
distance. We focus on the strong LR regime ($0\leq \sigma \leq1$) and show that
the thermal transport behaviors are remarkably nuanced. Specifically, we
observe that the antipersistent (negative) energy current correlation in this
regime is intricately dependent on $\sigma$, displaying a nonmonotonic
variation. Notably, a significant qualitative change occurs at $\sigma_c=1/2$,
where with respect to other $\sigma$ values, the correlation shows a minimum
negative value. The underlying mechanisms of this intriguing phenomenon is
related to the two diverse space-time scaling properties of equilibrium heat
correlations and the various scattering processes of phonons and discrete
breathers.

<h3>How boundary interactions dominate emergent driving of passive probes in  active matter</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09227" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09227</a>
<br>
<i>Jeanine Shea, Gerhard Jung, Friederike Schmid</i>
<p>Colloidal probes immersed in an active bath have been found to behave like
active particles themselves. Here, we use coarse-grained simulations to
investigate the mechanisms behind this behavior. We find that the active motion
of the colloid cannot be simply attributed to the convective motion in the
bath. Instead, the boundary of the probe contributes significantly to these
adopted dynamics by causing active bath particles to spontaneously accumulate
at the probe. This gathering of active bath particles then pushes the probe,
thus promoting its emergent active-particle-like behavior. Furthermore, we find
that the dynamic properties of the probe depend on its size in a non-monotonic
way, which further highlights the non-trivial interplay between probe and bath.

<h3>Calculating Pair Correlations from Random Particle Configurations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09236" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09236</a>
<br>
<i>Aris Karnezis, Art L. Gower</i>
<p>Particle pair-correlations are broadly used to describe particle
distributions in chemistry, physics, and material science. Many theoretical
methods require the pair-correlation to predict material properties such as
fluid flow, thermal properties, or wave propagation. In all these applications
it is either important to calculate a pair-correlation from specific particle
configurations, or vice-versa: determine the likely particle configurations
from a pair-correlation which is needed to fabricate a particulate material.
Most available methods to calculate the pair-correlation from a particle
configuration require that the configuration be very large to avoid effects
from the boundary. Here we show how to avoid boundary effects even for small
particle configurations. Having small particle configurations leads to far more
efficient numerical methods. We also demonstrate how to use techniques from
smooth nonlinear optimisation to quickly recover a particle configuration from
a pair-correlation.

<h3>Work Distribution for Unzipping Processes</h3>

<i>P. Werner, A.K. Hartmann, S.N. Majumdar</i>
<p>A simple zipper model is introduced, representing in a simplified way, e.g.,
the folded DNA double helix or hairpin structures in RNA. The double stranded
hairpin is connected to a heat bath at temperature $T$ and subject to an
external force $f$, which couples to the free length $L$ of the unzipped
sequence. Increasing the force, leads to an zipping/unzipping first-order phase
transition at a critical force $f_c(T)$ in the thermodynamic limit of a very
large chain. We compute analytically, as a function of temperature $T$ and
force $f$, the full distribution $P(L)$ of free lengths in the thermodynamic
limit and show that it is qualitatively very different for $f<f_c$, $f=f_c$ and
$f>f_c$. Next we consider quasistatic work processes where the force is
incremented according to a linear protocol. Having obtained $P(L)$ already
allows us to derive an analytical expression for the work distribution $P(W)$
in the zipped phase $f<f_c$ for a long chain. We compute the large-deviation
tails of the work distribution explicitly. Our analytical result for the work
distribution is compared over a large range of the support down to
probabilities as small as $10^{-200}$ with numerical simulations, which were
performed by applying sophisticated large-deviation algorithms.

<i>L. F. Escamilla-Herrera, J. L. López-Picón, José Torres-Arenas, Alejandro Gil-Villegas</i>
<p>In this work, the Thermodynamic Geometry (TG) of quantum fluids (QF) is
analyzed. We present results for two models. The first one is a quantum
hard-sphere fluid (QHS) whose Helmholtz free energy is obtained from Path
Integrals Monte Carlo simulations (PIMC). It is found that due to quantum
contributions in the thermodynamic potential, the anomaly found in TG for the
classical hard-sphere fluid related to the sign of the scalar curvature, is now
avoided in a considerable region of the thermodynamic space. The second model
is a semi-classical square-well fluid (QSW), described by a quantum hard-sphere
repulsive interaction coupled with a classical attractive square-well
contribution. Behavior of the semi-classical curvature scalar as a function of
the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\lambda_B$ is analyzed for several
attractive-potential ranges, and description of the semi-classical R-Widom
lines defined by the maxima of the curvature scalar, are also obtained and
compared with classical results for different square-well ranges.

<br>
<i>Manfred May, Mathis Boderius, Natalia Gostkowska-Lekner, Mark Busch, Klaus Habicht, Tommy Hofmann, Patrick Huber</i>
<p>The fabrication of hybrid materials consisting of nanoporous hosts with
conductive polymers is a challenging task, since the extreme spatial
confinement often conflicts with the stringent physico-chemical requirements
for polymerization of organic constituents. Here, several low-threshold and
scalable synthesis routes for such hybrids are presented. First, the
electrochemical synthesis of composites based on mesoporous silicon (pore size
of 7 nm) and the polymers PANI, PPy and PEDOT is discussed and validated by
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX). Polymer filling degrees of 74% are achieved. Second, the production of
PEDOT/pSi hybrids, based on the solid-state polymerization (SSP) of DBEDOT to
PEDOT is shown. The resulting amorphous structure of the nanopore-embedded
PEDOT is investigated via in-situ synchrotron-based X-ray scattering. In
addition, a twofold increase in the electrical conductivity of the hybrid
compared to the porous silicon host is shown, making this system particularly
promising for thermoelectric applications.

<h3>Shaping graphene superconductivity with nanometer precision</h3>

<br>
<i>E. Cortés-del Río, S. Trivini, J.I. Pascual, V. Cherkez, P. Mallet, J-Y. Veuillen, J.C. Cuevas, I. Brihuega</i>
<p>Graphene holds great potential for superconductivity due to its pure
two-dimensional nature, the ability to tune its carrier density through
electrostatic gating, and its unique, relativistic-like electronic properties.
At present, we are still far from controlling and understanding graphene
superconductivity, mainly because the selective introduction of superconducting
properties to graphene is experimentally very challenging. Here, we have
developed a method that enables shaping at will graphene superconductivity
through a precise control of graphene-superconductor junctions. The method
combines the proximity effect with scanning tunnelling microscope (STM)
manipulation capabilities. We first grow Pb nano-islands that locally induce
superconductivity in graphene. Using a STM, Pb nano-islands can be selectively
displaced, over different types of graphene surfaces, with nanometre scale
precision, in any direction, over distances of hundreds of nanometres. This
opens an exciting playground where a large number of predefined
graphene-superconductor hybrid structures can be investigated with atomic scale
precision. To illustrate the potential, we perform a series of experiments,
rationalized by the quasi-classical theory of superconductivity, going from the
fundamental understanding of superconductor-graphene-superconductor
heterostructures to the construction of superconductor nanocorrals, further
used as "portable" experimental probes of local magnetic moments in graphene.

<h3>Material Informatics through Neural Networks on Ab-Initio Electron  Charge Densities: the Role of Transfer Learning</h3>

<i>Dario Massa, Stefanos Papanikolaou, Piotr Sankowski</i>
<p>In this work, the dynamic realms of Materials Science and Computer Science
advancements meet the critical challenge of identifying efficient descriptors
capable of capturing the essential features of physical systems. Such task has
remained formidable, with solutions often involving ad-hoc scalar and vectorial
sets of materials properties, making optimization and transferability
challenging. We extract representations directly from ab-initio differential
electron charge density profiles using Neural Networks, highlighting the
pivotal role of transfer learning in such task. Firstly, we demonstrate
significant improvements in regression of a specific defected-materials
property with respect to training a deep network from scratch, both in terms of
predictions and their reproducibilities, by considering various pre-trained
models and selecting the optimal one after fine-tuning. The remarkable
performances obtained confirmed the transferability of the existent pre-trained
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on physics domain data, very different
from the original training data. Secondly, we demonstrate a saturation in the
regression capabilities of computer vision models towards properties of an
extensive variety of undefected systems, and how it can be overcome with the
help of large language model (LLM) transformers, with as little text
information as composition names. Finally, we prove the insufficiency of
open-models, like GPT-4, in achieving the analogous tasks and performances as
the proposed domain-specific ones. The work offers a promising avenue for
enhancing the effectiveness of descriptor identification in complex physical
systems, shedding light over the power of transfer learning to easily adapt and
combine available models, with different modalities, to the physics domain, at
the same time opening space to a benchmark for LLMs capabilities in such
domain.

<h3>Chimeric classes of universality of catastrophic cascades</h3>

<p>Cascades are self-reinforcing processes underlying the systemic risk of many
natural and socio-technical systems. Understanding the universal aspects of
these phenomena is a fundamental topic, yet typically bound to numerical
observations in ad-hoc models and limited insights. Here, we develop a unifying
approach and show that regime shifts by long-range cascades are characterized
by two universality classes defined by the parity invariance of the underlying
process. We provide hyperscaling arguments predicting critical exponents with
mean-field and $d$-dimensional features -- hence, their term ``chimeric'' --
and show how global symmetries influence the geometry and lifetime of
avalanches. Simulations encompassing classic and novel cascade models validate
our predictions, revealing fundamental principles of cascade phenomena amenable
to experimental validation.

<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09326" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09326</a>
<br>
<i>V. V. Pozhyvatenko</i>
<p>The electronic properties as well as the structural characteristics and their
pressure dependence of the semi-metallic $B10$-structured compound
$\mathrm{InBi}$ were investigated. It is found that the structural values of
$\mathrm{InBi}$ calculated in the first-principles calculations reproduce the
experimental values worse than those for other heavy III-V pnictides, which are
characterized by cubic $B3$ and $B2$ structures, as well as for IV-VI compounds
$\mathrm{SnO}$ and $\mathrm{PbO}$ having the same $B10$ structure. The low
accuracy of the first-principles calculations is a consequence of the
peculiarities of the band structure inherent to $\mathrm{InBi}$ and not
observed in all the other above-mentioned compounds. To improve the agreement
with the experiment, it is proposed to take into account the distortion of the
compensated half-metal condition at the highly symmetric points of the
Brillouin zone, where the electronic and hole pockets are located.

<h3>Effect of out-of-plane acoustic phonons on the thermal transport  properties of graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09345" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09345</a>
<br>
<i>J. Chen, Y. Liu</i>
<p>The lattice thermal conductivity of graphene is evaluated using a microscopic
model that takes into account the lattice's discrete nature and the phonon
dispersion relation within the Brillouin zone. The Boltzmann transport equation
is solved iteratively within the framework of three-phonon interactions without
taking into account the four-phonon scattering process. The Umklapp and normal
collisions are treated rigorously, thereby avoiding relaxation-time and
long-wavelength approximations. The mechanisms of the failures of these
approximations in predicting the thermal transport properties are discussed.
Evaluation of the thermal conductivity is performed at different temperatures
and frequencies and in different crystallite sizes. Reasonably good agreement
with the experimental data is obtained. The calculation reveals a critical role
of out-of-plane acoustic phonons in determining the thermal conductivity. The
out-of-plane acoustic phonons contribute greatly and the longitudinal and
transverse acoustic phonons make small contributions over a wide range of
temperatures and frequencies. The out-of-plane acoustic phonons dominate the
thermal conductivity due to their high density of states and restrictions
governing the anharmonic phonon scattering. The selection rule severely
restricts the phase space for out-of-plane phonon scattering due to reflection
symmetry. The optical phonon contribution cannot be neglected at higher
temperatures. Both Umklapp and normal processes must be taken into account in
order to predict the phonon transport properties accurately.

<i>Priyo Adhikary, Mayank Gupta, B. R. K. Nanda, Shantanu Mukherjee</i>
<p>In this study, we perform a numerical simulation on the recently discovered
high-temperature superconductor ($T_c$= 73K) Ba$_2$CuO$_{3.2}$ \cite{lietal}
while focusing on doping dependence of alternating CuO$_6$ octahedra and CuO
chain-like states. Employing the multiband random-phase approximation, we
compute the spin-fluctuation mediated pairing interaction, subsequently
determining its pairing eigenvalues and eigenfunctions relative to
oxygen-doping levels. We find that, for the certain range of hole doping in
Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\delta}$, a singlet $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing symmetry emerges
as long as we keep the doping below the critical value $x_{c}$. Interestingly
upon hole doping, the dominant pairing symmetry undergoes a transition to a
triplet (odd paring) type from the singlet state. This change in pairing is
driven by the competition between the nesting vectors coming from the Fermi
surface of $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals within the CuO$_6$ octahedra.
This triplet state is attainable through hole doping, while supressing
inter-layer self-doping effects. Furthermore, we present the density of states
within the superconducting phase, offering a potential comparison with
tunnelling spectra in Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\delta}$. Our research provides novel
insights into the intricate pairing symmetries in Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\delta}$ and
their underlying pairing mechanisms.

<p>Temperature measurements of dielectric permittivity are performed for
nonstoichiometric ferroelectric lead germanate Pb$_{4.95}$Ge$_3$O$_{11}$ and
multiferroic solid solution [N(C$_2$H$_5$)$_4$]$_2$CoClBr$_3$. Unlike the heat
capacity data, the analysis of the dielectric permittivity of ferroics is
usually performed at the assumption that the dielectric "background" is
negligible compared with its critical part. In this work we quantitatively
interpret the dielectric properties of the single crystals mentioned above and
the appropriate literature data for multiferroic Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ crystals, using
generalized Curie-Weiss formulas that combine corrections due to a nonlinear
temperature-dependent dielectric background, a modified critical index of
electric susceptibility, and a diffuse character of phase transition. We argue
that taking account of the temperature dependent dielectric background can
improve notably the quantitative analysis of PTs for a number of classes of the
ferroic materials.

<p>The molecular dynamics simulations were used to obtain the radius of gyration
of real ring polymer chains with different topological structures consisting of
360 monomers. We focus on the entropic force which is exerted by a dilute
solution of ring polymer chains of different topological structures with the
excluded volume interaction (EVI) in a good solvent on the confining parallel
walls of a slit geometry. We consider mixed boundary conditions of one
repulsive wall and the other one at the adsorption threshold. The obtained
molecular dynamics simulation results for a wide slit region demonstrate a
qualitative agreement with previous analytical results for ideal ring polymers.
These results could lead to interesting potential applications in materials
engineering and improve understanding of some biological processes suggested in
the paper. Additionally, they could be applied in micro- and
nano-electromechanical devices (MEMS and NEMS) in order to reduce the static
friction.

<h3>Potential Energy Landscape of a Flexible Water Model: Equation-of-State,  Configurational Entropy, and Adam-Gibbs Relationship</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09355" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09355</a>
<br>
<i>Ali Eltareb, Gustavo E. Lopez, Nicolas Giovambattista</i>
<p>The potential energy landscape (PEL) formalism is a tool within statistical
mechanics that has been used in the past to calculate the equation of states
(EOS) of classical rigid model liquids at low temperatures, where computer
simulations may be challenging. In this work, we use classical molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations and the PEL formalism to calculate the EOS of the
flexible q-TIP4P/F water model. This model exhibits a liquid-liquid critical
point (LLCP) in the supercooled regime, at ($P_c = 150$ MPa, $T_c = 190$ K,
$\rho_c = 1.04$ g/cm$^3$) [using the reaction field technique]. The PEL-EOS of
q-TIP4P/F water, and the corresponding location of the LLCP, are in very good
agreement with the MD simulations. We show that the PEL of q-TIP4P/F water is
Gaussian which allows us to calculate the configurational entropy of the
system, $S_{conf}$. The $S_{conf}$ of q-TIP4P/F water is surprisingly similar
to that reported previously for rigid water models, suggesting that
intramolecular flexibility does not necessarily add roughness to the PEL. We
also show that the Adam-Gibbs relation, which relates the diffusion coefficient
$D$ with $S_{conf}$, holds for the flexible q-TIP4P/F water model. Overall, our
results indicate that the PEL formalism can be used to study molecular systems
that include molecular flexibility, the common case in standard force fields.
This is not trivial since the introduction of large bending/stretching mode
frequencies is problematic in classical statistical mechanics. For example, as
shown previously, we find that such high-frequencies lead to an unphysical
(negative) entropy for q-TIP4P/F water (yet the PEL formalism can be applied
successfully).

states, the time evolution of monolayer- and total magnetizations is
investigated.

<h3>Exploring the structural, electronic, magnetic, and magneto-optical  properties of double perovskites $\text{Ca}_2\text{TMIrO}_6$ (TM=Fe, Co)  through first principles study</h3>

<i>I. Touaibia, A. Bouguerra, W. Guenez, F. Chemam</i>
<p>This study is aimed at exploring the electronic, magnetic, and
magneto-optical properties of double perovskites Ca$_2$FeIrO$_6$ and
Ca$_2$CoIrO$_6$ {with monoclinic structure (space group P21/$c$) } in order to
examine their potential applications in spintronic and photovoltaic devices.
The calculations were done using the full-potential linearized augmented plane
wave within the density functional theory. For the electronic
exchange-correlation function, we used the generalized gradient approximation
(GGA) and GGA+U (Hubbard potential), and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The study
showed that Ca$_2$FeIrO$_6$ and Ca$_2$CoIrO$_6$ exhibit a monoclinic structure
(space group P21/$c$). The structure relaxation shows an antiferromagnetic
behavior in both systems with a magnetic moment of about 6.00$\mu_B$ for
Ca$_2$FeIrO$_6$ and 4.00$\mu_B$ for Ca$_2$CoIrO$_6$ by using GGA+U
approximation. The results of GGA and GGA+U predict the half-metallic behavior
of Ca$_2$FeIrO$_6$ and Ca$_2$CoIrO$_6$. The magneto-optical polar Kerr effect
(MOKE) was examined by studying the variation of Kerr and ellipticity rotation.
The Kerr rotation angle is $1.3^{\circ}$ at 4.82 eV and $-1.21^{\circ}$ at 4.3
eV, and the ellipticity angle is $-1.21^{\circ}$ at 4.3 eV for Ca$_2$FeIrO$_6$.
In the case of Ca$_2$CoIrO$_6$, the Kerr rotation angle is $-1.04^{\circ}$ at
4.05 eV; the significant Kerr rotation in both compounds may suggest the
application of these materials in optoelectronics bias. The named compounds
have a potential application in the field of spintronics and its devices, such
as in optoelectronics technologies.

<p>Excitons consist of electrons and holes held together by their attractive
Coulomb interaction. Although excitons are neutral excitations, spatial
fluctuations in their charge density couple with the ions of the crystal
lattice. This coupling can lower the exciton energy and lead to the formation
of a localized excitonic polaron, or even a self-trapped exciton in the
presence of strong exciton-phonon interactions. Here, we develop a theoretical
and computational approach to compute excitonic polarons and self-trapped
excitons from first principles. Our methodology combines the many-body
Bethe-Salpeter approach with density-functional perturbation theory, and does
not require explicit supercell calculations. As a proof of concept, we
demonstrate our method for a compound of the halide perovskite family.

<h3>The role of intrinsic atomic defects in a Janus MoSSe/XN (X = Al, Ga)  heterostructure: a first principles study</h3>

<p>The interactions between different layers in van der Waals heterostructures
have a significant impact on the electronic and optical characteristics. By
utilizing the intrinsic dipole moment of Janus transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs), it is possible to tune these interlayer interactions. We systematically
investigate structural and electronic properties of Janus MoSSe
monolayer/graphene-like Aluminum Nitrides (MoSSe/g-AlN) heterostructures with
point defects by employing density functional theory calculations with the
inclusion of the nonlocal van der Waals correction. The findings indicate that
the examined heterostructures are energetically and thermodynamically stable,
and their electronic structures can be readily modified by creating a
heterostructure with the defects in g-AlN monolayer. This heterostructure
exhibits an indirect semiconductor with the band gap of 1.627 eV which is in
the visible infrared region. It can be of interest for photovoltaic
applications. When a single N atom or Al atom is removed from a monolayer of
g-AlN in the heterostructure, creating vacancy defects, the material exhibits
similar electronic band structures with localized states within the band gap
which can be used for deliberately tailoring the electronic properties of the
MoSSe/g-AlN heterostructure. These tunable results can offer exciting
opportunities for designing nanoelectronics devices based on MoSSe/g-AlN
heterojunctions.

<p>The relations for the polarizability of the metallic nanoparticles, coated
with the shell of cyanine dyes, are obtained in the article. The frequency
dependencies for light absorption and scattering efficiencies, the heating of
the composite nanoparticle and the electric field amplification in its
neighborhood are studied. It is established that all the dependencies have
three maxima which correspond to the frequencies of hybrid plasmon-exciton
resonance. It is shown that an increase in content of metal in the nanoparticle
causes a blue shift of the maxima from the visible part of the spectrum and a
red shift of the maximum from ultraviolet frequency range. The issue of
application of metal-organic nanoparticles in nanomedicine, in particular for
the photothermal therapy of malignant neoplasms is studied.

<h3>Theory of excitonic polarons: From models to first-principles  calculations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09369" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09369</a>

<i>Zhenbang Dai, Chao Lian, Jon Lafuente-Bartolome, Feliciano Giustino</i>
<p>Excitons are neutral excitations that are composed of electrons and holes
bound together by their attractive Coulomb interaction. The electron and the
hole forming the exciton also interact with the underlying atomic lattice, and
this interaction can lead to a trapping potential that favors exciton
localization. The quasi-particle thus formed by the exciton and the surrounding
lattice distortion is called excitonic polaron. Excitonic polarons have long
been thought to exist in a variety of materials, and are often invoked to
explain the Stokes shift between the optical absorption edge and the
photo-luminescence peak. However, quantitative ab initio calculations of these
effects are exceedingly rare. In this manuscript, we present a theory of
excitonic polarons that is amenable to first-principles calculations. We first
apply this theory to model Hamiltonians for Wannier excitons experiencing
Fr\"{o}hlich or Holstein electron-phonon couplings. We find that, in the case
of Fr\"{o}hlich interactions, excitonic polarons only form when there is a
significant difference between electron and hole effective masses. Then, we
apply this theory to calculating excitonic polarons in lithium fluoride ab
initio. The key advantage of the present approach is that it does not require
supercells, therefore it can be used to study a variety of materials hosting
either small or large excitonic polarons. This work constitutes the first step
toward a complete ab initio many-body theory of excitonic polarons in real
materials.

<h3>Fresh Cement as a Frictional Non-Brownian Suspension</h3>

<br>

<p>Cement is an essential construction material due to its ability to flow
before later setting, however the rheological properties must be tightly
controlled. Despite this, much understanding remains empirical. Using a
combination of continuous and oscillatory shear flow, we compare fresh Portland
cement suspensions to previous measurements on model non-Brownian suspensions
to gain a micro-physical understanding. Comparing steady and small-amplitude
oscillatory shear, we reveal two distinct jamming concentrations, $\phi_{\mu}$
and $\phi_{\rm rcp}$, where the respective yield stresses diverge. As in model
suspensions, the steady-shear jamming point is notably below the oscillatory
jamming point, $\phi_{\mu} < \phi_{\rm rcp}$, suggesting that it is tied to
frictional particle contacts. These results indicate that recently established
models for the rheology of frictional, adhesive non-Brownian suspensions can be
applied to fresh cement pastes, offering a new framework to understand the role
of additives and fillers. Such micro-physical understanding can guide
formulation changes to improve performance and reduce environmental impact.

<p>The physics of disordered media, from metallic glasses to colloidal
suspensions, granular matter and biological tissues, offers difficult
challenges because it often occurs far from equilibrium, in materials lacking
symmetries and evolving through complex energy landscapes. Here, we review
recent theoretical efforts to provide microscopic insights into the mechanical
properties of amorphous media using approaches from statistical mechanics as
unifying frameworks. We cover both the initial regime corresponding to small
deformations, and the yielding transition marking a change between elastic
response and plastic flow. We discuss the specific features arising for systems
evolving near a jamming transition, and extend our discussion to recent studies
of the rheology of dense biological and active materials.

<h3>Electron binding energy of donor in bilayer graphene with gate-tunable  gap</h3>

<i>E. V. Gorbar, V. P. Gusynin, D. O. Oriekhov, B. I. Shklovskii</i>
<p>In gapped bilayer graphene, similarly to conventional semiconductors, Coulomb
impurities (such as nitrogen donors) may determine the activation energy of its
conductivity and provide low temperature hopping conductivity. However, in
spite of importance of Coulomb impurities, nothing is known about their
electron binding energy $E_b$ in the presence of gates. To close this gap, we
study numerically the electron binding energy $E_b$ of a singly charged donor
in BN-enveloped bilayer graphene with the top and bottom gates at distance $d$
and gate-tunable gap $2\Delta$. We show that for $10 < d < 200$ nm and $1 <
\Delta < 100$ meV the ratio $E_b/\Delta$ changes from 0.4 to 1.5. The ratio
$E_b/\Delta$ stays close to unity because of the dominating role of the bilayer
polarization screening which reduces the Coulomb potential well depth to values
$\sim \Delta$. Still the ratio $E_b/\Delta$ somewhat decreases with growing
$\Delta$, faster at small $\Delta$ and slower at large $\Delta$. On the other
hand, $E_b/\Delta$ weakly grows with $d$, again faster at small $\Delta$ and
slower at large $\Delta$. We also studied the effect of trigonal warping and
found only a small reduction of $E_b/\Delta$.

<h3>Effects of Vanadium Doping on the Optical Response and Electronic  Structure of WS$_{2}$ Monolayers</h3>

<p>Two-dimensional dilute magnetic semiconductors has been recently reported in
semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides by the introduction of
spin-polarized transition metal atoms as dopants. This is the case of
vanadium-doped WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers, which exhibits a ferromagnetic
ordering even above room temperature. However, a broadband characterization of
their electronic band structure and its dependence on vanadium concentration is
still lacking. Therefore, here we perform power-dependent photoluminescence,
resonant four-wave mixing, and differential reflectance spectroscopy to study
the optical transitions close to the A exciton energy of vanadium-doped WS$_2$
monolayers with distinct concentrations. Instead of a single A exciton peak,
vanadium-doped samples exhibit two photoluminescence peaks associated with
transitions to occupied and unoccupied bands. Moreover, resonant Raman
spectroscopy and resonant second-harmonic generation measurements revealed a
blueshift in the B exciton but no energy change in the C exciton as vanadium is
introduced in the monolayers. Density functional theory calculations showed
that the band structure is sensitive to the Hubbard \(U\) correction for
vanadium and several scenarios are proposed to explain the two
photoluminescence peaks around the A exciton energy region. Our work provides
the first broadband optical characterization of these two-dimensional dilute
magnetic semiconductors, shedding light on the novel electronic features of
WS$_{2}$ monolayers which are tunable by the vanadium concentration.

<h3>Interaction robustness of the chiral anomaly in Weyl semimetals and  Luttinger liquids from a mixed anomaly approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09409" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09409</a>
<br>
<i>Shuyang Wang, Jay D. Sau</i>
<p>The chiral anomaly is one of the robust quantum effects in relativistic field
theories with a chiral symmetry where charges in chiral sectors appear to be
separately conserved. The chiral anomaly, which is often associated with a
renormalization-invariant topological term, is a violation of this conservation
law due to quantum effects. Such anomalies manifest in Weyl materials as an
electromagnetic field-induced transfer of charge between Fermi pockets.
However, the emergent nature of the conservation of chiral charge leads to
manifestations of the chiral anomaly response that depend on the details of the
system such as the strength of interactions. In this paper, we apply an
approach where the chiral symmetry in solid materials is replaced by the
combination of charge $U(1)$ gauge and spatial translation symmetry. The chiral
anomaly in this case is replaced by a mixed anomaly between the two symmetries
and the chiral charge can be defined as being proportional to the total
momentum. We show that the chiral anomaly associated with this chiral charge is
unrenormalized by interactions in contrast to other chiral charges in $(1+1)D$
whose renormalization is regularization dependent. In $(3+1)$D Weyl systems,
this chiral anomaly is equivalent to the charge transferred between Fermi
surfaces which can be measured through changes in Fermi-surface-enclosed
volume. We propose a pump-probe technique to measure this.

<h3>Where is the spin liquid in maple-leaf quantum magnet?</h3>

<i>Pratyay Ghosh</i>
<p>We investigate the possibility of exotic phenomena, viz. quantum spin liquid
(QSL) or deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP), in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
Heisenberg model on the maple-leaf lattice, a geometrically frustrated system
formed by hexagons (coupling $J_h$), triangles (coupling $J_t$), and dimers
(coupling $J_d$). We identify one promising region, given by $J_h > 0$ and
$J_t, J_d < 0$, for hosting enticing physics. In this region, the quantum phase
diagram of the system exhibits an interplay between N\'eel order and a gapped
dimerized singlet phase. This arrangement holds the possibility of harboring a
QSL and a DQCP. Using bond-operator mean-field theory and density matrix
renormalization group calculations, we delve into this uncharted territory,
revealing tantalizing evidence of the existence of a QSL phase and highlighting
its potential as a platform for DQCP.
