<h3>Hierarchical defect-induced condensation in active nematics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05716" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05716</a>

Topological defects play a central role in the formation and organization of
various biological systems. Historically, such nonequilibrium defects have been
mainly studied in the context of homogeneous active nematics. Phase-separated
systems, in turn, are known to form dense and dynamic nematic bands, but
typically lack topological defects. In this paper, we use agent-based
simulations of weakly aligning, self-propelled polymers and demonstrate that
contrary to the existing paradigm phase-separated active nematics form ${-1/2}$
defects. Moreover, these defects, emerging due to interactions among dense
nematic bands, constitute a novel second-order collective state. We investigate
the morphology of defects in detail and find that their cores correspond to a
strong increase in density, associated with a condensation of nematic fluxes.
Unlike their analogs in homogeneous systems, such condensed defects form and
decay in a different way and do not involve positively charged partners. We
additionally observe and characterize lateral arc-like structures that separate
from a band's bulk and move in transverse direction. We show that the key
control parameters defining the route from stable bands to the coexistence of
dynamic lanes and defects are the total density of particles and their path
persistence length. We introduce a hydrodynamic theory that qualitatively
recapitulates all the main features of the agent-based model, and use it to
show that the emergence of both defects and arcs can be attributed to the same
anisotropic active fluxes. Finally, we present a way to artificially engineer
and position defects, and speculate about experimental verification of the
provided model.

<h3>Magnetic control of orientational order and intrinsic hydrodynamic  instability in bacterial turbulence</h3>

Highly concentrated active agents tend to exhibit turbulent flows,
reminiscent of classical hydrodynamic turbulence, which has attracted
considerable attention lately. Controlling the so-called active turbulence has
long been a challenge, and the influence of external fields on such chaotic
self-organization remains largely unexplored. Here we report on active
turbulence of Bacillus subtilis bacteria controlled by a uniform magnetic field
via a magnetizable medium based on magnetic nanoparticles. The rod-shaped
bacteria act as non-magnetic voids in the otherwise magnetic medium, allowing
magnetic torques to be generated on their bodies. This leads to an externally
controllable nematic alignment constraint that further controls bacterial
turbulence into a nematic state. The nematic orientational ordering in the
direction parallel to the magnetic field is accompanied by transverse flows
owing to active stress by dipole pushers, which induce undulation of the
nematic state. Remarkably, the typical length of the undulation is almost
independent of the magnetic field strength. Our theoretical model based on the
hydrodynamic equations for suspensions of self-propelled particles predicts the
intrinsic length scale of hydrodynamic instability independent of the magnetic
field. Our findings suggest that magnetic torques are a powerful approach for
controlling both individual agents and their collective states in active
systems.

<h3>Unsteady drag force on an immersed sphere oscillating near a wall</h3>

The unsteady hydrodynamic drag exerted on an oscillating sphere near a planar
wall is addressed experimentally, theoretically, and numerically. The
experiments are performed by using colloidal-probe Atomic Force Microscopy
(AFM) in thermal noise mode. The natural resonance frequencies and quality
factors are extracted from the measurement of the power spectrum density of the
probe oscillation for a broad range of gap distances and Womersley numbers. The
shift in the natural resonance frequency of the colloidal probe as the probe
goes close to a solid wall infers the wall-induced variations of the effective
mass of the probe. Interestingly, a crossover from a positive to a negative
shift is observed as the Womersley number increases. In order to rationalize
the results, the confined unsteady Stokes equation is solved numerically using
a finite-element method, as well as asymptotic calculations.The in-phase and
out-of-phase terms of the hydrodynamic drag acting on the sphere are obtained
and agree well to the experimental results. All together, the experimental,
theoretical, and numerical results show that the hydrodynamic force felt by an
immersed sphere oscillating near a wall is highly dependent on the Womersley
number.

<h3>Resistivity in Quantum Vortex Liquid of Clean Two-Dimensional  Superconductor</h3>

<br>
Motivated by a recent controversy on a possible quantum phase in thin films
of relatively clean superconductors under an out-of-plane magnetic field, the
quantum fluctuation effects on the phase diagram and the resistivity are
reexamined. It is argued that most of features seen in the corresponding
resistivity data in relatively clean systems reported recently are explained
within the present theory, and that the fan-shaped resistivity curves,
suggestive of the presence of a superconductor to insulator transition at zero
temperature, in the vortex liquid regime is a consequence of the insulating
behavior of the Aslamasov-Larkin fluctuation conductivity in the quantum
regime.

<h3>Near room-temperature intrinsic exchange bias in an Fe intercalated  ZrSe2 spin glass</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05595" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05595</a>

<br>
<br>
Some magnetic systems display a shift in the center of their magnetic
hysteresis loop away from zero field, a phenomenon termed exchange bias.
Despite the extensive use of the exchange bias effect, particularly in magnetic
multilayers, for the design of spin-based memory/electronics devices, a
comprehensive mechanistic understanding of this effect remains a longstanding
problem. Recent work has shown that disorder-induced spin frustration might
play a key role in exchange bias, suggesting new materials design approaches
for spin-based electronic devices that harness this effect. Here, we design a
spin glass with strong spin frustration induced by magnetic disorder by
exploiting the distinctive structure of Fe intercalated ZrSe2, where Fe(II)
centers are shown to occupy both octahedral and tetrahedral interstitial sites
and to distribute between ZrSe2 layers without long-range structural order.
Notably, we observe behavior consistent with a magnetically frustrated, and
multi-degenerate ground state in these Fe0.17ZrSe2 single crystals, which
persists above room temperature. Moreover, this magnetic frustration leads to a
robust and tunable exchange bias up to 250 K. These results not only offer
important insights into the effects of magnetic disorder and frustration in
magnetic materials generally, but also highlight as design strategy the idea
that a large exchange bias can arise from an inhomogeneous microscopic
environment without discernible long-range magnetic order. In addition, these
results show that intercalated TMDs like Fe0.17ZrSe2 hold potential for
spintronics technologies that can achieve room temperature applications.

This article contains our comments and views on the status of the current
understanding of phase transitions in systems with only hard-core interactions,
based on our work in this area. The equation of state for the hard sphere gas
in $d$-dimensions is discussed. The universal repulsive Lee-Yang singularities

<h3>Auxiliary Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Forward, Inverse, and  Coupled Radiative Transfer Problems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05602" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05602</a>

<br>
<br>
In this paper, we develop and employ auxiliary physics-informed neural
networks (APINNs) to solve forward, inverse, and coupled integro-differential
problems of radiative transfer theory (RTE). Specifically, by focusing on the
relevant slab geometry and scattering media described by different types of
phase functions, we show how the proposed APINN framework enables the efficient
solution of Boltzmann-type transport equations through multi-output neural
networks with multiple auxiliary variables associated to the Legendre expansion
terms of the considered phase functions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
successful application of APINN to the coupled radiation-conduction problem of
a participating medium and find distinctive temperature profiles beyond the
Fourier thermal conduction limit. Finally, we solve the inverse problem for the
Schwarzschild-Milne integral equation and retrieve the single scattering albedo
based solely on the knowledge of boundary data, similar to what is often
available in experimental settings. The present work significantly expands the
current capabilities of physics-informed neural networks for radiative transfer
problems that are relevant to the design and understanding of complex
scattering media and photonic structures with applications to metamaterials,
biomedical imaging, thermal transport, and semiconductor device modeling.

<h3>Description length of canonical and microcanonical models</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Non-equivalence between the canonical and the microcanonical ensemble has
been shown to arise for models defined by an extensive number of constraints
(e.g. the Configuration Model). Here, we focus on the framework induced by
entropy maximization and study the extent to which ensemble non-equivalence
affects the description length of binary, canonical, and microcanonical models.
Specifically, we consider the description length induced by the Normalized
Maximum Likelihood (NML), which consists of two terms, i.e. a model
log-likelihood and its complexity: while the effects of ensemble
non-equivalence on the log-likelihood term are well understood, its effects on
the complexity term have not been systematically studied yet. Here, we find
that i) microcanonical models are always more complex than their canonical
counterparts and ii) the difference between the canonical and the
microcanonical description length is strongly influenced by the degree of
non-equivalence, a result suggesting that non-equivalence should be taken into
account when selecting models. Finally, we compare the NML-based approach to
model selection with the Bayesian one induced by Jeffreys prior, showing that
the two cannot be reconciled when non-equivalence holds.

<h3>Charge Transfer and Zhang-Rice Singlet Bands in the Nickelate  Superconductor $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ under Pressure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05662" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05662</a>
<br>
<i>Wéi Wú, Zhihui Luo, Dao-Xin Yao, Meng Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, high-Tc superconductivity is reported in the bulk nickelate
$\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ at pressures above 14 GPa. Here, we study an eleven-band
Hubbard model with hopping parameters derived from \textit{ab initio}
calculations of $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$, by employing large scale determinant
quantum Monte Carlo and cellular dynamical mean-field theory methods. Our
result suggests that the superexchange couplings in this system are comparable
to that of cuprates. The superexchange couplings between the intra-layer
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals are comparable to its cuprates counterpart, and that
between the inter-layer $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals are substantially stronger than
the former. The system is a charge transfer insulator as hole concentration
becomes four per site at large Hubbard $U$. Upon hole doping, two low-energy
spin-singlet bands emerge in the system exhibiting distinct correlation
properties: while the one composed of the out-of-plane Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and
O-$p_z$ orbitals demonstrates strong antiferromagnetic correlations and narrow
effective bandwidth, the in-plane singlet band consisting of the
Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and O-$p_x / p_y$ orbitals is in general more itinerant. Over
a broad range of hole doping, the doped holes occupy primarily the
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $p_x / p_y$ orbitals, as the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $p_z$
orbitals retain underdoped. We propose an effective $ t-J$ model to capture the
relevant physics and discuss the implications of our result for comprehending
the $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ superconductivity.

<h3>Adiabatic dynamics of coupled spins and phonons in magnetic insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05668" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05668</a>
<br>
<i>Shang Ren, John Bonini, Massimiliano Stengel, Cyrus E. Dreyer, David Vanderbilt</i>
<br>
<br>
In conventional \textit{ab initio} methodologies, phonons are calculated by
solving equations of motion involving static interatomic force constants and
atomic masses. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where all electronic degrees
of freedom are assumed to adiabatically follow the nuclear dynamics, is also
adopted. This approach does not fully account for the effects of broken
time-reversal symmetry in systems with magnetic order. Recent attempts to
rectify this involve the inclusion of the velocity dependence of the
interatomic forces in the equations of motion, which accounts for time-reversal
symmetry breaking, and can result in chiral phonon modes with non-zero angular
momentum even at the zone center. However, since the energy ranges of phonons
and magnons typically overlap, the spins cannot be treated as adiabatically
following the lattice degrees of freedom. Instead, phonon and spins must be
treated on a similar footing. Focusing on zone-center modes, we propose a
method involving Hessian matrices and Berry curvature tensors in terms of both
phonon and spin degrees of freedom, and describe a first-principles methodology
for calculating these. We then solve Lagrange's equations of motion to
determine the energies and characters of the mixed excitations, allowing us to
quantify, for example, the energy splittings between chiral pairs of phonons in
some cases, and the degree of magnetically induced mixing between infrared and
Raman modes in others. The approach is general, and can be applied to determine
the adiabatic dynamics of any mixed set of slow variables.

<h3>Hourglass-Like Spin Excitation in a Doped Mott Insulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05671" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05671</a>
<br>
<i>Jia-Xin Zhang, Chuan Chen, Jian-Hao Zhang, Zheng-Yu Weng</i>
<br>
<br>
We examine the dynamical magnetic response in a two-component
resonating-valence-bond (RVB) description of the doped Mott insulator. The
half-filled antiferromagnetic phase described by the Schwinger-boson mean-field
theory will evolve into a bosonic-RVB state in the superconducting phase upon
doping, where the doped holes introduce another fermionic itinerant spinon
which forms a BCS-like RVB order. The spin excitations are thus composed of a
resonance-like mode from the former and a weak dispersive mode from the
itinerant component at the mean-field level. These two-component spinons are
shown to give rise to an hourglass-like spin excitation at the RPA level via an
antiferromagnetic coupling between the two modes, which provides an
unconventional explanation of the experimental observations in the cuprate. In
particular, we also discuss an instability towards an incommensurate magnetic
order in this theoretical framework.

<h3>Mott insulators in moiré transition metal dichalcogenides at  fractional fillings: Slave-rotor mean-field theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05676" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05676</a>
<br>
<i>Zhenhao Song, Urban F. P. Seifert, Zhu-Xi Luo, Leon Balents</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we study a slave-rotor mean-field theory of an extended Hubbard
model, applicable to transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e systems, that
captures both the formation of Wigner crystals as well as exotic spin states on
top of these charge backgrounds. Phase diagrams are mapped out for different
choices of long-range Coulomb repulsion strength, reproducing several
experimentally found Wigner crystal states. Assuming unbroken time reversal
symmetry, we find several spin liquid states as well as dimer states at
fractional fillings. While spin dimer states are always found to have the
lowest mean field energy, several spin liquid states are energetically
competitive and may be stabilized by including gauge fluctuations or further
interaction terms. We further discuss possible experimental signatures of these
states pertinent to two-dimensional moir\'e heterostructures.

<h3>A fermion-parity qubit in a proximitized double quantum dot</h3>

<br>
<br>
Bound states in quantum dots coupled to superconductors can be in a coherent
superposition of states with different electron number but with the same number
parity. Electrostatic gating can tune this superposition to a sweet spot, where
the quantum dot has the same mean electric charge independent of its
electron-number parity. Here, we propose to encode quantum information in the
local fermion parity of two tunnel-coupled quantum dots embedded in a Josephson
junction. At the sweet spot, the qubit states have zero charge dipole moment.
This protects the qubit from dephasing due to electric field fluctuations.
Depending on the strength of the tunnel coupling between the dots, the system
is further protected towards either relaxation (weak tunneling) or dephasing
(strong tunneling) from noise coupling separately to each quantum dot. We
describe initialization and readout as well as single-qubit and two-qubit gates
by pulsing gate voltages.

<h3>Hilbert space fragmentation imposed real spectrum of a non-Hermitian  system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05679" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05679</a>
<br>
<i>Somsubhra Ghosh, K. Sengupta, Indranil Paul</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that constraints imposed by strong Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF)
along with the presence of certain global symmetries can provide a sufficient
condition for the reality of eigenspectra of non-Hermitian quantum systems;
such a reality cannot be guaranteed by global symmetries alone. We demonstrate
this insight for an interacting finite fermionic Nelson-Hatano chain. We show
analytically that strong HSF and real spectrum are both consequences of the
same dynamical constraints in the limit of large interaction, provided the
system has sufficient global symmetries. The spectrum stays real for
interactions above a finite critical value, where the system encounters a
many-body exceptional point. We provide a method to detect this exceptional
point using a local equal-time correlation function.

<h3>Quantum-Classical Correspondence for the Relaxation Dynamics of  Many-Body Spin Systems: Linear Chaos and Diffusion in the Energy Shell</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05681" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05681</a>
<br>
<i>Fausto Borgonovi, Felix M. Izrailev, Lea F. Santos</i>
<br>
<br>
We study quench dynamics in a one-dimensional interacting spin model that is
strongly chaotic in the classical and quantum domain. We use the knowledge of
the quantum-classical correspondence developed in [Phys. Rev. B 107, 155143
(2023)] to elucidate the mechanism of the system relaxation process. It
actually involves two mechanisms, one due to linear parametric instability and
the other caused by nonlinearity. We show that the relaxation of the
noninteracting energy (global quantity) and of the onsite magnetization (local
observable) is mainly due to the first mechanism, referred to as linear chaos.
With a semi-analytical approach based on classical ergodicity, we find that the
relaxation timescale of both quantities is independent of the system size for
both the classical and the quantum case. We also verify that the spread of the
noninteracting energy in the energy shell is diffusive-like. In contrast to
these results, the number of principal components, which quantifies how the
initial state spreads in the many-body Hilbert space and does not have a
classical counterpart, grows exponentially in time and has a relaxation time
that depends on the number of spins.

<h3>Electrons interacting with Goldstone modes and the rotating frame</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05699" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05699</a>
<br>
<i>Konstantinos Vasiliou, Yuchi He, Nick Bultinck</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider electronic systems with a spontaneously broken continuous
symmetry. The scattering vertex between electrons and Goldstone modes is
calculated over the entire Brillouin zone using the random phase approximation.
This calculation reveals two things: (1) electrons always couple to both $\phi$
and $\partial_t \phi$, where $\phi$ is the Goldstone field, and (2)
quasi-particles in a state with continuous symmetry breaking have to be defined
in a rotating frame, which locally follows the fluctuations of the order
parameter. The implications of these findings for electron spectral functions
in both symmetry-broken and thermally disordered systems are discussed, and the
examples of anti-ferromagnetism in the Hubbard model and spin spiral order in
the three-band model are worked out in detail.

<h3>Structural and magnetic properties of Fe-Co-C alloys with tetragonal  deformation: a first-principle study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05709" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05709</a>
<br>
<i>Wojciech Marciniak, Mirosław Werwiński</i>
<br>
<br>
Fe-Co alloys with induced tetragonal strain are promising materials for
rare-earth-free permanent magnets. However, as ultrathin-film studies have
shown, tetragonal Fe-Co structures tend to a rapid relaxation toward a cubic
structure as the thickness of the deposited film increases. One of the main
methods of inducing the stable strain in the bulk material is interstitial
doping with small atoms, like B, C, or N. In this work, we present a full
configuration space analysis in density functional theory approach for
(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_{16}$C supercells with a single C impurity in one of the
octahedral interstitial positions and for the full range of Co concentrations
$x$. We discuss all assumptions and considerations leading to calculated
lattice parameters, mixing enthalpies, magnetic moments, and averaged
magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies (MAE). We present a comprehensive
qualitative analysis of the structural and magnetic properties' dependence on
short- and long-range ordering parameters. We analyzed all unique Fe/Co atoms
occupancies at all stoichiometric concentrations possible in 2x2x2 supercell
based on 2-atom tetragonal representation. We rely on the thermodynamic
averaging method and large sample count to obtain accurate MAE values. We
reevaluate several chemical disorder approximation methods, including effective
medium methods (virtual crystal approximation and coherent potential
approximation) and special quasirandom structures method applied to Fe-Co-based
alloys. We observe a structural phase transition from the body-centered
tetragonal structure above 70% Co concentration and confirm the structural
stability of Fe-Co-C alloys in the tetragonal range. We show the presence of a
broad MAE maximum of around 50% Co concentration and notably high MAE values
for Co content $x$ as low as 25%. In addition, we show a positive correlation
between MAE and mixing enthalpy.

<h3>Thermodynamics of computations with absolute irreversibility,  unidirectional transitions, and stochastic computation times</h3>

Developing a physical theory of computation is an open challenging task at
the interface of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and computer science. An
important part of this task requires the examination of thermodynamic
quantities in formal models of computers which execute computational tasks,
such as automata or word-RAM models executing algorithms. This implies dealing
with a number of difficulties such as stochastic halting times, unidirectional
(possibly deterministic) transitions, and restricted initial conditions. Here,
we present a framework which tackles all such difficulties by extending
martingale theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics to non-stationary Markovian
dynamics with broken local detailed balance and absolute irreversibility. In
doing so, we derive universal fluctuation relations and second-law-like
inequalities that provide both lower and upper bounds for the intrinsic
dissipation (mismatch cost) associated with any computation performed over
arbitrary stochastic times, so long as it is implemented with a periodic
process. We then provide universal equalities and inequalities for the
acceptance probability of words of a given length by a computer in terms of
thermodynamic quantities, and outline connections between computer science and
stochastic resetting. We illustrate most of our results with exhaustive
numerical simulations of fundamental models of computation from theoretical
computer science, namely deterministic finite automata processing bit strings.
Our results, while motivated from the computational context, are applicable far
beyond it.

<h3>On the coupling of magnetic moments to superconducting quantum  interference devices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05724" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05724</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the coupling factor $\phi_\mu$ that quantifies the magnetic
flux $\Phi$ per magnetic moment $\mu$ of a point-like magnetic dipole that
couples to a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). Representing
the dipole by a current-carrying loop, the reciprocity of mutual inductances of
SQUID and loop provides a way of calculating $\phi_\mu(\vec{r}, \vec{e}_\mu)$
vs.~position $\vec{r}$ and orientation $\vec{e}_\mu$ of the dipole anywhere in
space from the magnetic field $B(\vec{r})$ produced by a supercurrent
circulating in the SQUID loop. We use numerical simulations based on London and
Ginzburg-Landau theory to calculate $\phi_\mu$ from the supercurrent density
distributions in various SQUID geometries. We treat the far-field regime
($r\gtrsim a=$ inner size of the SQUID loop) with the dipole placed on the
symmetry axis of circular or square shaped loops. We compare expressions for
$\phi_\mu$ from filamentary loop models with simulation results for loops with
finite width $w$ (outer size $A>a$), thickness $d$ and London penetration depth
$\lambda_L$ and show that for thin ($d\ll a$) and narrow ($w < a$) loops the
introduction of an effective loop size $a_{\rm eff}$ in the filamentary
loop-model expressions results in agreement with simulations. For a dipole
placed in the center of the loop, simulations provide an expression
$\phi_\mu(a,A,d,\lambda_L)$ that covers a wide parameter range. In the
near-field regime (dipole centered at small distance $z$ above one SQUID arm)
only coupling to a single strip representing the SQUID arm has to be
considered. Here, we compare simulations with an analytical expression derived
for a homogeneous current density distribution, which yields excellent
agreement for $\lambda_L>w,d$. Moreover, we analyze $\phi_\mu$ provided by the
introduction of a constriction in the SQUID arm below the magnetic dipole.

<h3>Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, Néel skyrmions and V$_4$ magnetic  clusters in multiferroic lacunar spinel GaV$_4$S$_8$</h3>

Using ab initio density functional theory with static mean-field
correlations, we calculate the Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interactions (DMI) for an atomistic spin Hamiltonian for the lacunar spinel,
GaV$_4$S$_8$. The parameters describing these interactions are used in
atomistic spin dynamics and micromagnetic simulations. The magnetic properties
of the lacunar spinel GaV$_4$S$_8$, a material well-known from experiment to
host magnetic skyrmions of N\'eel character, are simulated with these ab initio
calculated parameters. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya contribution to the
micromagnetic energy is a sum of two Lifshitz invariants, supporting the
formation of N\'eel skyrmions and its symmetry agrees with what is usually
expected for $C_{3\nu}$-symmetric systems. The are several conclusions one may
draw from this work. One concerns the quantum nature of the magnetism, where we
show that the precise magnetic state of the V$_4$ cluster is crucial for
understanding quantitatively the magnetic phase diagram. In particular we
demonstrate that a distributed-moment state of each V$_4$ cluster explains well
a variety of properties of GaV$_4$S$_8$, such as the band gap, observed Curie
temperature and especially the stability of N\'eel skyrmions in the
experimentally relevant temperature and magnetic-field range. In addition, we
find that electronic correlations change visibly the calculated value of the
DMI.

<br>
Exactly solvable Hamiltonians with spin liquid ground states have proven to
be extremely useful, not only because they unambiguously demonstrate that these
phases can arise in systems of interacting spins but also as a pedagogical
illustration of the concept and as a controlled starting point for further
theoretical analysis. However, adding dissipative couplings to the environment
- an important aspect for the realization of these phases - generically spoils
the exact solvability. We here present and study a Lindbladian, describing a
square-lattice spin-liquid with dissipative coupling to the environment, that
admits an exact solution in terms of Majorana fermions coupled to static
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge fields. This solution allows us to characterize the
steady-state solutions as well as ``quasiparticle'' excitations within the
Lindbladian spectrum. This emergence of distinct types of quasiparticle
excitations of the Lindbladian leads to a separation of timescales that govern
the equilibration time of the expectation values of different classes of
observables, some of which we identify as fractionalized string-like operators.
This exactly solvable Lindbladian is expected to provide a starting point for a
better understanding of the behavior of fractionalized systems under
dissipative time evolution.

<h3>A New Perspective on Thermally Fluctuating 2D Elastic Membranes:  Introducing Odd Elastic Moduli and Non-Equilibrium Effects</h3>

<br>
<br>
Non-equilibrium and active effects in mesoscopic scale systems have heralded
a new era of scientific inquiries, whether concerning meta-materials or
biological systems such as bacteria and cellular components. At mesoscopic
scales, experimental and theoretical treatments of membranes, and other
quasi-two-dimensional elastic surfaces cannot generically ignore Brownian
motion and other thermal effects. In this paper we aim to study the behavior of
thermally fluctuating 2-D elastic membranes possessing odd elastic moduli
embedded in higher dimensions. We implement an isotropic generalization of the
elastic tensor that includes odd elastic moduli, $K_{odd}$ and $A_{odd}$, that
break conservation of energy and angular momentum respectively, due to
cite{scheibner2020odd}. Naturally this introduces active and non-equilibrium
effects. Passive equilibrium thermalized elastic membranes possess effective
(renormalized) Lam\'e coefficients that reduce with increasing system size and
a diverging effective bending rigidity. Introducing two odd elastic moduli
means that deformations from a reference state can induce chiral forces that
cannot be derived from a Hamiltonian. Thus, the behavior of odd elastic
membranes must instead be investigated with Langevin equations. If
fluctuation-dissipation relations hold, we calculate via the renormalization
group that at long length scales, active effects due to $K_{odd}$ can be
effectively ignored whereas $A_{odd}$ cannot. To validate these findings, we
developed an advanced force implementation methodology, inspired by the
$(T)$-scheme prevalent in vertex models. This contributed to a new method for
the simulation of elastic membranes in higher dimensions, as detailed recently
in \cite{matoz2020wrinkle}. The novelty of the method is that
microscopic/discrete and continuum in-plane elastic moduli are one-to-one and
thus no coarse-graining is needed.

Graphene is of great scientific interest due to a variety of unique
properties such as ballistic transport, spin selectivity, the quantum hall
effect, and other quantum properties. Nanopatterning and atomic scale
modifications of graphene are expected to enable further control over its
intrinsic properties, providing ways to tune the electronic properties through
geometric and strain effects, introduce edge states and other local or extended
topological defects, and sculpt circuit paths. The focused beam of a scanning
transmission electron microscope (STEM) can be used to remove atoms, enabling
milling, doping, and deposition. Utilization of a STEM as an atomic scale
fabrication platform is increasing; however, a detailed understanding of
beam-induced processes and the subsequent cascade of aftereffects is lacking.
Here, we examine the electron beam effects on atomically clean graphene at a
variety of temperatures ranging from 400 to 1000 C. We find that temperature
plays a significant role in the milling rate and moderates competing processes
of carbon adatom coalescence, graphene healing, and the diffusion (and
recombination) of defects. The results of this work can be applied to a wider
range of 2D materials and introduce better understanding of defect evolution in
graphite and other bulk layered materials.

Over the past decades, discrete dislocation dynamics simulations have been
shown to reliably predict the evolution of dislocation microstructures for
micrometer-sized metallic samples. Such simulations provide insight into the
governing deformation mechanisms and the interplay between different physical
phenomena such as dislocation reactions or cross-slip. This work is focused on
a detailed analysis of the influence of the cross-slip on the evolution of
dislocation systems. A tailored data mining strategy using the
``\ab*{discrete-to-continuous} framework'' allows to quantify differences and
to quantitatively compare dislocation structures. We analyze the quantitative
effects of the cross-slip on the microstructure in the course of a tensile test
and a subsequent relaxation to present the role of cross-slip in the
microstructure evolution. The precision of the extracted quantitative
information using D2C strongly depends on the resolution of the domain
averaging. We also analyze how the resolution of the averaging influences the
distribution of total dislocation density and curvature fields of the specimen.
Our analyzes are important approaches for interpreting the resulting structures
calculated by dislocation dynamics simulations.

<h3>Doping of Cr in Graphene Using Electron Beam Manipulation for Functional  Defect Engineering</h3>

<br>
<br>
Chromium atoms in graphene have been proposed to exhibit magnetic moments and
spin-selective conducting states depending on the local bonding geometry within
the graphene structure, which could lead to interesting applications in
spintronics. Despite this interest, there are few direct experimental reports
of Cr dopants in graphene even though it is theorized to be stable. Here, we
demonstrate the introduction of single Cr dopant atoms into the graphene
lattice and onto graphene edges through the controlled use of a focused
electron beam in a scanning transmission electron microscope. We show local
control of doping locations and when coupled with targeted in situ milling
during scanning of the e-beam, these strategies demonstrate an important
component of the fabrication of tailored nanostructured devices in the electron
microscope. The approach is validated with first principles calculations to
understand synthesis pathways during fabrication and reveal the energetics and
local properties of Cr atoms embedded in graphene; e.g., Cr doping can convert
graphene into a magnetic and semiconducting material, which suggests Cr-doped
graphene can be used as a building block for potential electronic devices and a
means to construct them.

Atomic-scale fabrication is an outstanding challenge and overarching goal for
the nanoscience community. The practical implementation of moving and fixing
atoms to a structure is non-trivial considering that one must spatially address
the positioning of single atoms, provide a stabilizing scaffold to hold
structures in place, and understand the details of their chemical bonding.
Free-standing graphene offers a simplified platform for the development of
atomic-scale fabrication and the focused electron beam in a scanning
transmission electron microscope can be used to locally induce defects and
sculpt the graphene. In this scenario, the graphene forms the stabilizing
scaffold and the experimental question is whether a range of dopant atoms can
be attached and incorporated into the lattice using a single technique and,
from a theoretical perspective, we would like to know which dopants will create
technologically interesting properties. Here, we demonstrate that the electron
beam can be used to selectively and precisely insert a variety of transition
metal atoms into graphene with highly localized control over the doping
locations. We use first-principles density functional theory calculations with
direct observation of the created structures to reveal the energetics of
incorporating metal atoms into graphene and their magnetic, electronic, and
quantum topological properties.

Focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID) is a direct write technique
for depositing materials on a support substrate akin to 3D printing with an
electron beam (e-beam). Opportunities exist for merging this existing technique
with aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy to achieve
molecular- or atomic-level spatial precision. Several demonstrations have been
performed using graphene as the support substrate. A common challenge that
arises during this process is e-beam-induced hydrocarbon deposition, suggesting
greater control over the sample environment is needed. Various strategies exist
for cleaning graphene in situ. One of the most effective methods is to rapidly
heat to high temperatures, e.g., 600 C or higher. While this can produce large
areas of what appears to be atomically clean graphene, mobile hydrocarbons can
still be present on the surfaces. Here, we show that these hydrocarbons are
primarily limited to surface migration and demonstrate an effective method for
interrupting the flow using e-beam deposition to form corralled hydrocarbon
regions. This strategy is effective for maintaining atomically clean graphene
at high temperatures where hydrocarbon mobility can lead to substantial
accumulation of unwanted e-beam deposition.

We discuss some general properties of the symmetry-resolved von-Neumann
entanglement entropy in systems with particle number conservation and describe
how to obtain the entanglement components from correlation functions for
Gaussian systems. We introduce majorization as an important tool to derive
entanglement bounds. As an application, we derive lower bounds both for the
number and the configurational entropy for chiral and Cn-symmetric topological
phases. In some cases, our considerations also lead to an improvement of the
previously known lower bounds for the entanglement entropy in such systems.

<h3>Effect of spin-orbit coupling on the zero-point renormalization of the  electronic band gap in cubic materials: First-principles calculations and  generalized Fröhlich model</h3>

<br>
<br>
The electronic structure of semiconductors and insulators is affected by
ionic motion through electron-phonon interaction, yielding
temperature-dependent band gap energies and zero-point renormalization (ZPR) at
absolute zero temperature. For polar materials, the most significant
contribution to the band gap ZPR can be understood in terms of the Fr\"ohlich
model, which focuses on the nonadiabatic interaction between an electron and
the macroscopic electrical polarization created by a long-wavelength optical
longitudinal phonon mode. On the other hand, spin-orbit interaction (SOC)
modifies the bare electronic structure, which will, in turn, affect the
electron-phonon interaction and the ZPR. We present a comparative investigation
of the effect of SOC on the band gap ZPR of twenty semiconductors and
insulators with cubic symmetry using first-principles calculations. We observe
a SOC-induced decrease of the ZPR, up to 30%, driven by the valence band edge,
which almost entirely originates from the modification of the bare electronic
eigenenergies and the decrease of the hole effective masses near the $\Gamma$
point. We also incorporate SOC into a generalized Fr\"ohlich model, addressing
the Dresselhaus splitting which occurs in noncentrosymmetric materials, and
confirm that the predominance of nonadiabatic effects on the band gap ZPR of
polar materials is unchanged when including SOC. Our generalized Fr\"ohlich
model with SOC provides a reliable estimate of the SOC-induced decrease of the
polaron formation energy obtained from first principles and brings to light
some fundamental subtleties in the numerical evaluation of the effective masses
with SOC for noncentrosymmetric materials. We finally warn about a possible
breakdown of the parabolic approximation within the physically relevant energy
range of the Fr\"ohlich interaction for materials with high phonon frequencies
treated with SOC.

Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is now increasingly used in the discovery
of novel materials with applications in diverse industries. However, despite
decades of developments, the problem is far from being solved. With the
progress of deep learning, search algorithms, and surrogate energy models,
there is a great opportunity for breakthroughs in this area. However, the
evaluation of CSP algorithms primarily relies on manual structural and
formation energy comparisons. The lack of a set of well-defined quantitative
performance metrics for CSP algorithms make it difficult to evaluate the status
of the field and identify the strengths and weaknesses of different CSP
algorithms. Here, we analyze the quality evaluation issue in CSP and propose a
set of quantitative structure similarity metrics, which when combined can be
used to automatically determine the quality of the predicted crystal structures
compared to the ground truths. Our CSP performance metrics can be then utilized
to evaluate the large set of existing and emerging CSP algorithms, thereby
alleviating the burden of manual inspection on a case-by-case basis. The

Superconducting pairing symmetry are crucial in understanding the microscopic
superconducting mechanism of a superconductor. Here we report the observation
of a twofold superconducting gap symmetry in an interfacial superconductor
Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$/FeTe, by employing quasiparticle interference (QPI) technique
in scanning tunneling microscopy and macroscopic magnetoresistance
measurements. The QPI patterns corresponding to energies inside and outside the
gap reveal a clear anisotropic superconducting gap. Furthermore, both the
in-plane angle-dependent magnetoresistance and in-plane upper critical field
exhibit a clear twofold symmetry. This twofold symmetry align with the Te-Te
direction in FeTe, which weakens the possible generation by bi-collinear
antiferromagnetism order. Our finding provides key information in further
understanding of the topological properties in Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$/FeTe
superconducting system and propels further theoretical interests in the paring
mechanism in the system.

We report significantly improved accuracy of grain boundary segmentation
using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained on a combination of real and
generated data. Manual segmentation is accurate but time-consuming, and
existing computational methods are faster but often inaccurate. To combat this
dilemma, machine learning models can be used to achieve the accuracy of manual
segmentation and have the efficiency of a computational method. An extensive
dataset of from 316L stainless steel samples is additively manufactured,
prepared, polished, etched, and then microstructure grain images were
systematically collected. Grain segmentation via existing computational methods
and manual (by-hand) were conducted, to create "real" training data. A Voronoi
tessellation pattern combined with random synthetic noise and simulated
defects, is developed to create a novel artificial grain image fabrication
method. This provided training data supplementation for data-intensive machine
learning methods. The accuracy of the grain measurements from microstructure
images segmented via computational methods and machine learning methods
proposed in this work are calculated and compared to provide much benchmarks in
grain segmentation. Over 400 images of the microstructure of stainless steel
samples were manually segmented for machine learning training applications.
This data and the artificial data is available on Kaggle.

Furthering the understanding of the catalytic mechanisms in the oxygen
reduction reaction (ORR) is critical to advancing and enabling fuel cell
technology. In this work, we use multimodal operando synchrotron X-ray
diffraction (XRD) and resonant elastic X-ray scattering (REXS) to investigate
the interplay between the structure and oxidation state of a Co-Mn spinel oxide
electrocatalyst, which has previously shown ORR activity that rivals Pt in
alkaline fuel cells. During cyclic voltammetry, the electrocatalyst exhibited a
reversible and rapid increase in tensile strain at low potentials, suggesting
robust structural reversibility and stability of Co-Mn oxide electrocatalysts
during normal fuel cell operating conditions. At low potential holds, exploring
the limit of structural stability, an irreversible tetragonal-to-cubic phase
transition was observed, which may be correlated to reduction in both Co and Mn
valence states. Meanwhile, joint density-functional theory (JDFT) calculations
provide insight into how reactive adsorbates induce strain in spinel oxide
nanoparticles. Through this work, strain and oxidation state changes that are
possible sources of degradation during the ORR in Co-Mn oxide electrocatalysts
are uncovered, and the unique capabilities of combining structural and chemical
characterization of electrocatalysts in multimodal operando X-ray studies are
demonstrated.

Using the Bethe ansatz (BA) solution, we rigorously determine non-equilibrium
dynamics of quantum flutter and revival of an injected impurity with a large
initial momentum $Q$ into the one-dimensional (1D) interacting bosonic medium.
We show that two types of BA excited eigenstates drastically dominate the
oscillation nature of the quantum flutter with a periodicity which is simply
given by the charge and spin dressed energies $\varepsilon_{\rm c,s}(0)$ at
zero quasi-momentum $\tau_{\rm QF} = 2\pi/(|\varepsilon_{\rm c}(0)|-
|\varepsilon_{\rm s}(0)|)$. While we also determine quantum revival dynamics
with a larger periodicity $\tau_{L} = L/\left(v_{\rm c}(Q-k^*)-v_{\rm
s}(k^*)\right)$ than $\tau_{\rm QF}$, revealing the quantum reflection of
excitations induced by the periodic boundary conditions of a finite length $L$.
Here $v_{\rm c,s}$ are the sound velocities of charge and spin excitations,
respectively, and $k^*$ is determined by the rapidity of the impurity. Our
results reveals a microscopic origin of quantum supersonic phenomenon and shed
light on quantum magnon metrology for a measure of the gravitational force.

Applying a magnetic field to a solid changes its thermal-transport
properties. Although such magneto-thermal-transport phenomena are usually small
effects, giant magneto-thermal resistance has recently been observed in
spintronic materials1,2 and superconductors3,4, opening up new possibilities in
thermal management technologies. However, the thermal conductivity
conventionally changes only when a magnetic field is applied due to the absence
of nonvolatility, which limits potential applications of thermal switching
devices5,6. Here, we report the observation of nonvolatile thermal switching
that changes the thermal conductivity when a magnetic field is applied and
retains the value even when the field is turned off. This unconventional
magneto-thermal switching, surprisingly, arises in commercial Sn-Pb solders and
is realized by phase-separated superconducting states and resultant nonuniform
magnetic flux distributions. This result confirms the versatility of the
observed phenomenon and aids the development of active solid-state thermal
management devices.

We propose an efficient algorithm that combines column generation and quantum

difficult to solve because they are NP-hard. An attempt to solve binary
quadratic problems efficiently by column generation has been studied, but it
demands successively solving quadratic unconstrained binary optimization
problems. We solve the bottleneck by using quantum annealing or simulated

Anomalous Hall effect (AHE) emerged in antiferromagnetic metals shows
intriguing physics and application potential. In contrast to certain
noncollinear antiferromagnets, rutile RuO$_2$ has been proposed recently to
exhibit a crystal-assisted AHE with collinear antiferromagnetism. However, in
RuO$_2$, the on-site magnetic moment accompanying itinerant 4d electrons is
quite small, and more importantly, the AHE at zero external field is prohibited
by symmetry because of the high-symmetry [001] direction of the N\'eel vector.
Here, we show the AHE at zero field in the collinear antiferromagnet, Cr-doped
RuO$_2$. The appropriate doping of Cr at Ru sites results in a rotation of the
N\'eel vector from [001] to [110] and enhancement of the on-site magnetic
moment by one order of magnitude while maintaining a metallic state with the
collinear antiferromagnetism. The AHE with vanishing net moment in the
Ru$_{0.8}$Cr$_{0.2}$O$_2$ exhibits an orientation dependence consistent with
the [110]-oriented N\'eel vector. These results open a new avenue to manipulate
AHE in antiferromagnetic metals.

The canonical $\,NLT\,$ partition function of a quasi-one dimensional (q1D)
one-file system of equal hard disks [J. Chem Phys. \textbf{153}, 144111 (2020)]
provides an analytical description of the thermodynamics and ordering in this
system (a pore) as a function of linear density $\,Nd/L\,$ where $\,d\,$ is the
disk diameter. We derive the analytical formulae for the distance dependence of
the translational pair distribution function and the distribution function of
distances between next neighbor disks, and then demonstrate their use by
calculating the translational order in the pore. In all cases, the order is
found to be of a short range and to exponentially decay with the disks'
separation. The correlation length presented for different pore widths and
densities shows a non-monotonic dependence with a maximum at $\,Nd/L = 1\,$ and
tends to the 1D value for a vanishing pore width. The results indicate a
special role of this density when the pore length $\,L\,$ is equal exactly to
$N$ disk diameters. A comparison between the theoretical results for an
infinite system and the results of a molecular dynamics simulation for a finite
system with periodic boundary conditions is presented and discussed.

Selenium is experiencing renewed interest as a promising candidate for the
wide bandgap photoabsorber in tandem solar cells. However, despite the
potential of selenium-based tandems to surpass the theoretical efficiency limit
of single junction devices, such a device has never been demonstrated. In this
study, we present the first monolithically integrated selenium/silicon tandem
solar cell. Guided by device simulations, we investigate various
carrier-selective contact materials and achieve encouraging results, including
an open-circuit voltage of V$_\text{oc}$=1.68 V from suns-V$_\text{oc}$
measurements. The high open-circuit voltage positions selenium/silicon tandem
solar cells as serious contenders to the industrially dominant single junction
technologies. Furthermore, we quantify a pseudo fill factor of more than 80%
using injection-level-dependent open-circuit voltage measurements, indicating
that a significant fraction of the photovoltaic losses can be attributed to
parasitic series resistance. This work provides valuable insights into the key
challenges that need to be addressed for realizing higher efficiency
selenium/silicon tandem solar cells.

Flat electronic bands near the Fermi level provide a fertile playground for
realizing interaction-driven correlated physics. To date, related experiments
have mostly been limited to engineered multilayer systems (e.g., moir\'e

across the Fermi level in monolayer MoTe2-x by fabricating a uniformly ordered
mirror-twin boundary superlattice (corresponding to a stoichiometry of
MoTe56/33). The kagome flat bands are discovered by combining scanning
tunnelling microscopy and theoretical calculations. The partial filling nature
of flat bands yields a correlated insulating state exhibiting a hard gap as
large as 15 meV. Moreover, we observe pronounced responses of the correlated
states to magnetic fields, providing evidence for a spin-polarized ground
state. Our work introduces a monolayer platform that manifests strong
correlation effects arising from flattened electronic bands.

The shape of crystalline nanoparticles (NP) can often be described by
polyhedra with flat facet surfaces. Thus, structural studies of polyhedral
bodies can help to describe geometric details of NPs. Here we consider compact
polyhedra of cubic point symmetry Oh.as simple models. Their surfaces are
described by facets with normal vectors along selected directions (a, b, c)
together with their symmetry equivalents forming a direction family {abc}. For
given {abc} this yields generic polyhedra with up to 48 facets where we focus
on polyhedra with facets of {abc} = {100}, {110}, and {111}, suggested for
metal NPs with cubic lattices. The resulting generic polyhedra, cubic,
rhombohedral, and octahedral, can serve for the description of non-generic
polyhedra as intersections of corresponding generic species. Their structural
properties are shown to be fully determined by only three structure parameters,
facet distances R100, R110, and R111 of three types of facets. This provides a
phase diagram to completely classify the corresponding Oh symmetry polyhedra.
Structural properties of all polyhedra, such as shape, size, and facet
geometries, are discussed in analytical and numerical detail with visualization
of characteristic examples. The results may be used for respective nanoparticle
simulations but also as a repository assisting the interpretation of structures
of real compact nanoparticles observed by experiment.

<h3>Higgs amplitude mode in ballistic superconducting hybrid junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06019" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06019</a>
<br>
<i>Pierre Vallet, Jérôme Cayssol</i>
<br>
<br>
In superconductors (SC), the Higgs amplitude mode is a coherent oscillation
of the order parameter typically generated by THz laser irradiation. In this
paper we propose to probe the Higgs mode using electronic transport in
ballistic superconducting hybrid devices. We first confirm the existence of a
non-zero amplitude mode in the clean case using the Keldysh-Eilenberger
formalism. We then investigate two different geometries, respectively a
normal-insulating-superconductor (NIS) tunnel junction and a NSN junction with
transparent interfaces, the superconductor being irradiated in both situations.
In the NIS case, the Higgs manifests itself in the second-order AC current
response which is resonant at the Higgs frequency. In the NSN case, the DC
differential conductance allows to probe the gaps generated by the Higgs mode
in the Floquet spectrum.

<h3>Disassociation of a one-dimensional cold molecule via quantum scattering</h3>

<i>Wen-Liang Li, Hai-Jing Song, Tie-Ling Song, D. L. Zhou</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the recent experimental developments on ultracold molecules and
atoms, we propose a simplest theoretical model to address the disassociation,
reflection and transmission probability of a 1-dimensional cold molecule via
quantum scattering. First, we give the Born approximation results in the weak
interaction regime. Then, employing the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, we give
the numerical solution and investigate the disassociation's dependence on the
injection momentum and the interaction strengths. We find that the maximum
disassociation rate has a limit as increasing the interaction strengths and
injection momentum. We expect that our model can be realized in experiments in
the near future.

<br>
<br>
This study investigates the temperature-dependent quasi-static
magnetoelectric (ME) response of electrically poled lead-free
Na$_{0.4}$K$_{0.1}$Bi$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$-NiFe$_2$O$_4$ (NKBT-NFO) laminated
composites. The aim is to understand the temperature stability of ME-based
sensors and devices. The relaxor ferroelectric nature of NKBT is confirmed
through impedance and polarization-electric (PE) hysteresis loop studies, with
a depolarization temperature (Td) of approximately 110$^\circ$C. Heating causes
a decrease and disappearance of planar electromechanical coupling, charge
coefficient, and remnant polarization above Td. The temperature rise also leads
to a reduction in magnetostriction and magnetostriction coefficient of NFO by
approximately 33% and 25%, respectively, up to approximately 125$^\circ$C. At
room temperature, the bilayer and trilayer configurations exhibit maximum ME
responses of approximately 33 mV/cm.Oe and 80 mV/cm.Oe, respectively, under low
magnetic field conditions (300-450 Oe). The ME response of NKBT/NFO is highly
sensitive to temperature, decreasing with heating in accordance with the
individual temperature-dependent properties of NKBT and NFO. This study
demonstrates a temperature window for the effective utilization of
NKBT-NFO-based laminated composite ME devices.

<h3>Microwave conductivity due to impurity scattering in cuprate  superconductors</h3>

<br>
<i>Minghuan Zeng, Xiang Li, Yongjun Wang, Shiping Feng</i>
<br>
<br>
The microwave surface impedance measurements on cuprate superconductors
provide the crucial information of the effect of the impurity scattering on the
quasiparticle transport, however, the full understanding of the effect of the
impurity scattering on the quasiparticle transport is still a challenging
issue. Here based on the microscopic octet scattering model, the effect of the
impurity scattering on the low-temperature microwave conductivity in cuprate
superconductors is investigated in the self-consistent $T$-matrix approach. The
impurity-dressed electron propagator obtained in the Fermi-arc-tip
approximation of the quasiparticle excitations and scattering processes is
employed to derive the electron current-current correlation function by taking
into account the impurity-induced vertex correction. It is shown that the
microwave conductivity spectrum is a non-Drude-like, with a sharp cusp-like
peak extending to zero-energy and a high-energy tail falling slowly with
energy. Moreover, the microwave conductivity decreases with the increase of the
impurity concentration or with the increase of the strength of the impurity
scattering potential. In a striking contrast to the dome-like shape of the
doping dependence of the superconducting transition temperature, the microwave
conductivity exhibits a reverse dome-like shape of the doping dependence. The
theory also show that the highly unconventional features of the microwave
conductivity are generated by both the strong electron correlation and
impurity-scattering effects.

<h3>Giant non-volatile electric field control of proximity induced magnetism  in the spin-orbit semimetal SrIrO3</h3>

<br>
<br>
With its potential for drastically reduced operation power of information
processing devices, electric field control of magnetism has generated huge
research interest. Recently, novel perspectives offered by the inherently large
spin-orbit coupling of 5d transition metals have emerged. Here, we demonstrate
non-volatile electrical control of the proximity induced magnetism in SrIrO3
based back-gated heterostructures. We report up to a 700 % variation of the
anomalous Hall conductivity {\sigma}_AHE and Hall angle {\theta}_AHE as
function of the applied gate voltage Vg. In contrast, the Curie temperature TC
= 100K and magnetic anisotropy of the system remain essentially unaffected by
Vg indicating a robust ferromagnetic state in SrIrO3 which strongly hints to
gating-induced changes of the anomalous Berry curvature. The electric-field
induced ferroelectric-like state of SrTiO3 enables non-volatile switching
behavior of {\sigma}_AHE and {\theta}_AHE below 60 K. The large tunability of
this system, opens new avenues towards efficient electric-field manipulation of
magnetism.

<h3>Successive magnetic phase transitions with magnetoelastic and  magnetodielectric coupling in the ordered triple perovskite  Sr$_3$CaRu$_2$O$_9$</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report a comprehensive temperature-dependent investigation of the 1:2
ordered triple perovskite system Sr$_3$CaRu$_2$O$_9$. It crystallizes in the
monoclinic structure with space group $P21/c$, consisting of corner-sharing
CaO$_6$ and RuO$_6$ octahedra. Using DC magnetization and neutron diffraction
measurements, we show that this system undergoes successive magnetic
transitions ~190 K and ~160 K. From the analysis of the temperature-dependent
neutron diffraction and dielectric data, we demonstrate two distinguishing
features of the Sr$_3$CaRu$_2$O$_9$ system: (i) magnetoelastic coupling
associated with the two magnetic transitions, as revealed by a change in the
unit cell volume, direct Ru-Ru distance, and bond angles and (ii)
magnetodielectric coupling, as revealed by the anomalies across the two
magnetic transitions. The present results would add significantly to the
current understanding of the triple perovskites with incipient spin-orbit
coupling.

<h3>Experimental detectability of spin current shot noise</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06103" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06103</a>
<br>
<i>Luise Siegl, Michaela Lammel, Akashdeep Kamra, Hans Huebl, Wolfgang Belzig, Sebastian T. B. Goennenwein</i>
<br>
<br>
A magnonic spin current crossing a ferromagnet-metal interface is accompanied
by spin current shot noise arising from the discrete quanta of spin carried by
magnons. In thin films, e.g., the spin of so-called squeezed magnons have been
shown to deviate from the common value $\hbar$, with corresponding changes in
the spin noise. In experiments, spin currents are typically converted to charge
currents via the inverse spin Hall effect. We here analyze the magnitude of the
spin current shot noise in the charge channel for a typical electrically
detected spin pumping experiment, and find that the voltage noise originating
from the spin current shot noise is much smaller than the inevitable
Johnson-Nyquist noise. Furthermore, due to the local nature of the spin-charge
conversion, the ratio between spin current shot noise and Johnson-Nyquist noise
does not scale with sample geometry and sensitively depends on
material-specific transport properties. Our analysis thus provides guidance for
the experimental detection of squeezed magnons through spin pumping shot noise.

<br>
<br>
We report the detailed study of the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in a
dipolar-Heisenberg magnet LiGdF$_4$ using magnetization measurements performed
on a single crystal sample. Entropy variation on isothermal demagnetization
from the magnetic field up to 3 T is determined in the temperature range 2-10 K
for two principal directions of the applied field (parallel and perpendicular
to the tetragonal $c$-axis of the crystal). The MCE is found to be highly
anisotropic, with the cooling efficiency being up to twice higher at
$H\parallel c$. The results are nicely interpreted in the frame of a
conventional molecular field approach taking into account considerable
anisotropy of the paramagnetic Curie-Weiss temperature. These results are
compared to earlier studies of MCE in powder samples of LiGdF$_4$ [T. Numazawa
et al., AIP Conf. Proc. 850, 1579 (2006)] as well as with analogous data for
other well known magnetocaloric materials. Our findings may open new
possibilities to enhance the efficiency of magnetic refrigeration in the liquid
helium-4 temperature range.

<h3>Stationary state of harmonic chains driven by boundary resetting</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06127" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06127</a>
<br>
<i>Ritwick Sarkar, Pritam Roy</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of an ordered harmonic chain
of $N$ oscillators connected to two walls which undergo diffusive motion with
stochastic resetting. The intermittent resettings of the walls effectively
emulate two nonequilibrium reservoirs that exert temporally correlated forces
on the boundary oscillators. These reservoirs are characterized by the
diffusion constant and resetting rates of the walls. We find that, for any
finite $N$, the velocity distribution remains non-Gaussian, as evidenced by a
non-zero bulk kurtosis that decays $\sim N^{-1}$. We calculate the
spatio-temporal correlation of the velocity of the oscillators $\langle v_l(t)
v_{l'}(t') \rangle$ both analytically as well as using numerical simulation.
The signature of the boundary resetting is present at the bulk in terms of the
two-time velocity correlation of a single oscillator and the equal-time spatial
velocity correlation. For the resetting driven chain, the two-time velocity
correlation decay as $t^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ at the large time, and there exists a
non-zero equal-time spatial velocity correlation $\langle v_l(t) v_{l'}(t')
\rangle$ when $l \neq l'$. A non-zero average energy current will flow through
the system when the boundary walls reset to their initial position at different
rates. This average energy current can be computed exactly in the thermodynamic
limit. Numerically we show that the distribution of the instantaneous energy
current at the boundary is independent of the system size. However, the
distribution of the instantaneous energy current in the bulk approaches a
stationary distribution in the thermodynamic limit.

<h3>Theory of Elastic Microphase Separation</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Elastic microphase separation refers to equilibrium patterns that form by
phase separation in elastic gels. Recent experiments revealed a continuous
phase transition from the homogeneous phase to a regularly patterned phase,
whose period decreased for stiffer systems. We here propose a model that
captures these observations. The model combines a continuous field of the
elastic component to describe phase separation with nonlocal elasticity theory
to capture the gel's microstructure. Analytical approximations unveil that the
pattern period is determined by the geometric mean between the elasto-capillary
length and a microscopic length scale of the gel. Our theory highlights the
importance of nonlocal elasticity in soft matter systems, reveals the mechanism
of elastic microphase separation, and will improve the engineering of such
systems.

<br>
<br>
High quality scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) data
acquisition and analysis has become increasingly important due to the
commercial demand for investigating the properties of complex materials such as
battery cathodes; however, multidimensional techniques (such as 4-D STEM) which
can improve resolution and sample information are ultimately limited by the
beam-damage properties of the materials or the signal-to-noise ratio of the
result. subsampling offers a solution to this problem by retaining high signal,
but distributing the dose across the sample such that the damage can be
reduced. It is for these reasons that we propose a method of subsampling for
4-D STEM, which can take advantage of the redundancy within said data to
recover functionally identical results to the ground truth. We apply these
ideas to a simulated 4-D STEM data set of a LiMnO2 sample and we obtained high
quality reconstruction of phase images using 12.5% subsampling.

The spin dynamics in the block magnetic phase of the iron-based ladder

scattering. Using linear spin wave theory and Monte-Carlo simulations, our
analysis points to a magnetic Heisenberg model with effective frustrated
antiferromagnetic couplings only, able to describe both the exotic block order
and its dynamics. This new and purely antiferromagnetic picture offers a
fruitful perspective to describe multiferroic properties but also understand
the origin of the stripe-like magnetic instability observed under pressure as

<i>Jan M. van Ruitenbeek, Richard Korytár, Ferdinand Evers</i>
<br>
<br>
Chirality-induced spin selectivity has been reported in many experiments, but
a generally accepted theoretical explanation has not yet been proposed. Here,
we introduce a simple model system of a straight cylindrical free-electron
wire, containing a helical string of atomic scattering centers, with spin-orbit
interaction. The advantage of this simple model is that it allows deriving
analytical expressions for the spin scattering rates, such that the origin of
the effect can be easily followed. We find that spin-selective scattering can
be viewed as resulting from constructive interference of partial waves
scattered by the spin-orbit terms. We demonstrate that forward scattering rates
are independent of spin, while back scattering is spin dependent over wide
windows of energy. Although the model does not represent the full details of
electron transmission through chiral molecules, it clearly reveals a mechanism
that could operate in chiral systems.

We propose a generalization of the stochastic resetting mechanism for a
Brownian particle diffusing in a one-dimensional periodic potential: randomly
in time, the particle gets reset at the bottom of the potential well it was in.
Numerical simulations show that in mirror asymmetric potentials, stochastic
resetting rectifies the particle's dynamics, with maximum drift speed for an
optimal average resetting time. Accordingly, an unbiased Brownian tracer
diffusing on an asymmetric substrate can rectify its motion by adopting an
adaptive stop-and-go strategy. Our proposed ratchet mechanism can model
directed autonomous motion of molecular motors and micro-organisms

<br>
<br>
Recent experimental reports on the realizations of two-dimensional (2D)
networks of the C60-based fullerenes with anisotropic and nanoporous lattices
represent a significant advance, and create exciting prospects for the
development of a new class of nanomaterials. In this work, we employed
theoretical calculations to explore novel C60-based fullerene lattices and
subsequently evaluate their stability and key physical properties. After the
energy minimization of extensive structures, we could detect novel 2D, 1D and
porous carbon C60-based networks, with close energies to that of the isolated
C60 cage. Density functional theory results confirm that the C60-based networks
can exhibit remarkable thermal stability, and depending on their atomic
structure show metallic, semimetallic or semiconducting electronic nature.
Using the machine learning interatomic potentials, thermal and mechanical
responses of the predicted nanoporous 2D lattices were investigated. The
estimated thermal conductivity of the quasi-hexagonal-phase of C60 fullerene is
shown to be in an excellent agreement with the experimental measurements.
Despite of different atomic structures, the anisotropic room temperature
lattice thermal conductivity of the fullerene nanosheets are estimated to be in
the order of 10 W/mK. Unlike the majority of carbon-based 2D materials,
C60-based counterparts noticeably are predicted to show positive thermal
expansion coefficients. Porous carbon C60-based networks are found to exhibit
superior mechanical properties, with tensile strengths and elastic modulus
reaching extraordinary values of 50 and 300 GPa, respectively. The theoretical
results presented in this work provide a comprehensive vision on the
structural, energetic, electronic, thermal and mechanical properties of the
C60-based fullerene networks.

<br>
Two triangular lattice antiferromagnets Sr$_3$Co(Nb,Ta)$_2$O$_9$ with an
effective $j_{\rm eff}=1/2$ of Co$^{2+}$ are synthesized and their magnetic
properties are investigated via magnetization and heat capacity measurements.
The leading in-plane antiferromagnetic exchange coupling is estimated to be
$J/k_{\rm B} \simeq 4.7$ K and 5.8 K, respectively. Both the compounds feature
two-step magnetic transitions at low temperatures [($T_{\rm N1} \simeq 1.47$ K
and $T_{\rm N2} \simeq 1.22$ K) and ($T_{\rm N1} \simeq 0.88$ K and $T_{\rm N2}
\simeq 0.67$ K), respectively], driven by weak easy-axis anisotropy. Under
magnetic field Sr$_3$CoNb$_2$O$_9$ evinces a plateau at $1/3$ magnetization.
Interestingly, the high field magnetization of Sr$_3$CoTa$_2$O$_9$ reveals an
exotic regime (between $H_{\rm S1}$ and $H_{\rm S2}$), below the fully
polarized state in which the heat capacity at low temperatures is governed by a
power law ($C_{\rm p} \propto T^{\alpha}$) with a reduced exponent $\alpha
\simeq 2$. These results demonstrate an unusual field induced state with
gapless excitations in the strongly frustrated magnet Sr$_3$CoTa$_2$O$_9$. The
complete $T-H$ phase diagram is discussed for both the compounds.

Kagome metals are topological materials with a rich phase diagram featuring
various charge density wave orders and even unconventional superconductivity.
However, little is still known about possible spin-polarized responses in these
non-magnetic compounds. Here, we perform ab-initio calculations of the
intrinsic spin Hall effect (SHE) in the kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb,
K), CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ and ScV$_6$Sn$_6$. We report large spin Hall conductivities,
comparable with the Weyl semimetal TaAs. Additionally, in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ the SHE
is strongly renormalized by the CDW order. We can understand these results
based on the topological properties of band structures, demonstrating that the
SHE is dominated by the position and shape of the Dirac nodal lines in the
kagome sublattice. Our results suggest kagome materials as a promising, tunable
platform for future spintronics applications.

The area enclosed by the planar Brownian motion was studied by L\'evy, who
found the characteristic function and probability density of this random
variable. For other planar diffusions, in particular linear ergodic diffusions,
only the expected value of the stochastic area is known. Here, we calculate the
generating function of the stochastic area for linear ergodic diffusions and
extract from the result the large deviation functions characterising the
dominant part of its probability density in the long-time limit. We also obtain
the asymptotic mean of the stochastic area, which is known to be related to the
probability current, as well as the asymptotic variance, which is important for
determining from observed trajectories whether or not a diffusion is
reversible. Examples of reversible and irreversible linear diffusions are
studied to illustrate our results.

In this paper, we investigate the physical properties of the type II
multiferroic GdMn$_2$O$_5$ material by means of neutrons scattering, electric
polarization and magnetization measurements. A complex $(T,H)$ phase diagram
shows up, with especially a field induced magnetic transition around 12 T at
low temperature. The high field phase is accompanied by an additional electric
polarization along both the $a$ and $$b directions, as authorized by symmetry,
but never observed experimentally up to now. While the magnetic properties
recover their initial states after driving the field back to zero, the
polarization along $a$ shows a significant increase. This behavior is observed
for all directions of the magnetic field. It constitutes a novel and striking
manifestation of the magneto-electric coupling, resulting in the establishment
of a new ground state at zero magnetic field.

We present a theoretical analysis of heat transport through a single-molecule

between electrons on the molecule and phonons in the nuclear environment is

that within the steady state regime the competition between transport channels
may result in negative differential heat conductance and cooling of the

Topological quantum many-body systems, such as Hall insulators, are
characterized by a hidden order encoded in the entanglement between their
constituents. Entanglement entropy, an experimentally accessible single number
that globally quantifies entanglement, has been proposed as a first signature
of topological order. Conversely, the full description of entanglement relies
on the entanglement Hamiltonian, a more complex object originally introduced to
formulate quantum entanglement in curved spacetime. As conjectured by Li and
Haldane, the entanglement Hamiltonian of a many-body system appears to be
directly linked to its boundary properties, making it particularly useful for
characterizing topological systems. While the entanglement spectrum is commonly
used to identify complex phases arising in numerical simulations, its
measurement remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we perform a variational
approach to realize experimentally, as a genuine Hamiltonian, the entanglement
Hamiltonian of a synthetic quantum Hall system. We use a synthetic dimension,
encoded in the electronic spin of dysprosium atoms, to implement spatially
deformed Hall systems, as suggested by the Bisognano-Wichmann prediction. The
spectrum of the optimal variational Hamiltonian exhibits a chiral dispersion
akin to a topological edge mode, revealing the fundamental link between
entanglement and boundary physics. Our variational procedure can be easily
generalized to interacting many-body systems on various platforms, marking an
important step towards the exploration of exotic quantum systems with
long-range correlations, such as fractional Hall states, chiral spin liquids
and critical systems.

The ideal honeycomb lattice, featuring sublattice and SU(2) spin rotation
symmetries, is a fundamental model for investigating quantum matters with
topology and correlations. With the rise of the moir\'e-based design of model
systems, realizing a tunable and symmetric honeycomb lattice system with a
narrow bandwidth can open access to new phases and insights. We propose the
ABBA-stacked twisted double bilayer WSe$_2$ as a realistic and tunable platform
for reaching this goal. Adjusting the twist angle allows the bandwidth and the
ratio between hopping parameters of different ranges to be tuned. Moreover, the
system's small bandwidth and spin rotation symmetry enable effective control of
the electronic structure through an in-plane magnetic field. We construct an
extended Hubbard model for the system to demonstrate this tunability and
explore possible ordered phases using the Hartree-Fock approximation. We find
that at a hole filling of $\nu = 2$ (two holes per moir\'e unit cell), an
in-plane magnetic field of a few Tesla can ``dope" the system from a semimetal
to a metal. Interactions then drive an instability towards a canted
antiferromagnetic insulator ground state. Additionally, we observe a competing
insulating phase with sublattice charge polarization. Finally, we discuss the
experimental signatures of these novel insulating phases.

Provided is a comprehensive description of a band gap thermodynamic model,
which predicts and explains key features of photosegregation in lead-based,
mixed-halide perovskites. The model provides a prescription for illustrating
halide migration driven by photocarrier energies. Where possible, model
predictions are compared to experimental results. Free energy derivations are
provided for three assumptions: (1) halide mixing in the dark, (2) a fixed
number of photogenerated carriers funneling to and localizing in low band gap
inclusions of the alloy, and (3) the statistical occupancy of said inclusions
from a bath of thermalized photocarriers in the parent material. Model
predictions include: excitation intensity ($I_{\textrm{exc}}$)-dependent
terminal halide stoichiometries ($x_{\textrm{terminal}}$), excitation intensity
thresholds ($I_{\textrm{exc,threshold}}$) below which photosegregation is
suppressed, reduced segregation in nanocrystals as compared to thin films, the
possibility to kinetically manipulate photosegregation rates via control of
underlying mediators, asymmetries in forward and reverse photosegregation rate
constants/activation energies, and a preference for high band gap products to
recombine with the parent phase. What emerges is a cohesive framework for
understanding ubiquitous photosegregation in mixed-halide perovskites and a
rational basis by which to manage the phenomenon.

We present high field magnetotransport studies of Ge1-x-y(SnxMny)Te bulk
multiferroics with diamagnetic Sn and paramagnetic Mn concentration x = 0.38 to
0.79 and y = 0.02 to 0.086, respectively. The zero field resistivity, {\rho}(T)
takes significant contribution from defects below T = 20 K however, a mixed
scattering contribution from dynamic disorder and unusual sources is estimated
from T = 20 K to 300 K. The carrier mobility shows anomalous temperature
dependence from T0.2 to T0.5 which hints towards possible presence of polaronic
effects resulting from coupling of holes with phonons. This anomalous behavior
cannot be understood in terms of pure phononic scattering mechanism at high
temperature. From point of view of high field results, the transverse component
of magnetoresistivity manifests anomalous Hall effect originating from
extrinsic scattering sources, particularly the side jump mechanism reveals a
larger contribution. We also find that the correlation between the transverse
and longitudinal conductivities follow the universal scaling law {\sigma}xy ~
{\sigma}xxn where n = 1.6 in the low conductivity limit. The values n = 1.5 to
1.8 obtained for the present GSMT alloys justify the bad metal hopping regime
since the results fall in the low conductivity ferromagnetic family with
{\sigma}xx ~ 104 ohmcm-1. The interpretation of the n = 1.6 scaling in the low
conductivity regime is thus far not fully understood. However, the anomalous
Hall resistivity scaling with modified relation by Tian et al is indicative of
the dominant side jump scattering along with noticeable role of skew
scattering.

Spintronics has become a broad and important research field that intersects
with magnetism, nano-electronics, and materials science. Its overarching aim is
to provide a fundamental understanding of spin-dependent phenomena in
solid-state systems that can enable a new generation of spin-based logic
devices. Over the past decade, graphene and related 2D van der Waals crystals
have taken center stage in expanding the scope and potential of spintronic
materials. Their distinctive electronic properties and atomically thin nature
have opened new opportunities to probe and manipulate internal electronic
degrees of freedom. Purely electrical control over conduction-electron spins
can be attained in graphene-transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures,
due to proximity effects combined with graphene's high electronic mobility.
Specifically, graphene experiences a proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling that
enables efficient spin-charge interconversion processes; the two most
well-known and at the forefront of current research are the spin Hall and
inverse spin galvanic effects, wherein an electrical current yields a spin
current and non-equilibrium spin polarization, respectively. This article
provides an overview of the basic principles, theory, and experimental methods
underpinning the nascent field of 2D material-based spintronics.

<h3>First Hitting Time of a One-Dimensional Levy Flight to Small Targets</h3>

First hitting times (FHTs) describe the time it takes a random "searcher" to
find a "target" and are used to study timescales in many applications. FHTs
have been well-studied for diffusive search, especially for small targets,
which is called the narrow capture or narrow escape problem. In this paper, we
study the first hitting time to small targets for a one-dimensional
superdiffusive search described by a Levy flight. By applying the method of
matched asymptotic expansions to a fractional differential equation we obtain
an explicit asymptotic expansion for the mean FHT (MFHT). For fractional order
$s\in(0,1)$ (describing a $(2s)$-stable Levy flight whose squared displacement
scales as $t^{1/s}$ in time $t$) and targets of radius $\varepsilon\ll1$, we
show that the MFHT is order one for $s\in(1/2,1)$ and diverges as
$\log(1/\varepsilon)$ for $s=1/2$ and $\varepsilon^{2s-1}$ for $s\in(0,1/2)$.
We then use our asymptotic results to identify the value of $s\in(0,1]$ which
minimizes the average MFHT and find that (a) this optimal value of $s$ vanishes
for sparse targets and (b) the value $s=1/2$ (corresponding to an inverse
square Levy search) is optimal in only very specific circumstances. We confirm
our results by comparison to both deterministic numerical solutions of the
associated fractional differential equation and stochastic simulations.

The simultaneous influence of electronic correlations and magnetic ordering
on the theoretical estimation of phonons and related properties of Ni is
investigated. The work includes a comparative DFT and DFT+U study, where
on-site Coulomb interaction parameter for 3$d$ electrons, $U$($U_{full}$)=
0.516 eV obatined from constarined random phase approximation (cRPA)
calculations, is considered for DFT+U calculations. The analysis of phonon
frequency estimates along high symmetric k-directions and sampled full-BZ
(Brillouin zone) using Frozen phonon displacement method suggests the
importance of both on-site Coulomb correlations and magnetism to account for
the experimental frequencies. Further, prominent role of both the aspects is
observed in the derived thermodynamic properties - Free-energy, specific heat
\& entropy, within quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) specially at high
temperatures. The temperature dependent evaluation of thermal expansion
coefficient($\alpha$) and phonon density of states is performed together with
the equilibrium elastic constants. The results obtained for Ni, suggest the
significance of electronic energy correction due to both on-site Coulomb
correlations and magnetic phase incorporation, to account for realistic
description of experimental findings. This study realizes the inevitable role
of correlation effects in studying the phononic properties of a correlated
transition metal, hence directing a way to explore various other correlated
electron systems for their lattice dynamics.

We report a study on low-temperature heat transport of Kitaev magnet
Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, with the heat current and magnetic fields along the
honeycomb spin layer (the $ab$ plane). The zero-field thermal conductivity of
$\kappa^a_{xx}$ and $\kappa^{a*}_{xx}$ display similar temperature dependence
and small difference in their magnitudes; whereas, their magnetic field
(parallel to the heat current) dependence are quite different and are related
to the field-induced magnetic transitions. The $\kappa^a_{xx}(B)$ data for $B
\parallel a$ at very low temperatures have an anomaly at 10.25--10.5 T, which
reveals an unexplored magnetic transition. The planar thermal Hall conductivity
$\kappa^a_{xy}$ and $\kappa^{a*}_{xy}$ show very weak signals at low fields and
rather large values with sign change at high fields. This may point to a
possible magnetic structure transition or the change of the magnon band
topology that induces a radical change of magnon Berry curvature distribution
before entering the spin polarized state. These results put clear constraints
on the high-field phase and the theoretical models for Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$.
