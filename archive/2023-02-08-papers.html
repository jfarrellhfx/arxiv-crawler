<h3>The interplay of geometry and coarsening in multicomponent lipid  vesicles under the influence of hydrodynamics</h3>

We consider the impact of surface hydrodynamics on the interplay between
curvature and composition in coarsening processes on model systems for
biomembranes. This includes scaling laws and equilibrium configurations, which
are investigated by computational studies of a surface two-phase flow problem
with additional phase-depending bending terms. These additional terms
geometrically favor specific configurations. We find that as in 2D the effect
of hydrodynamics strongly depends on the composition. In situations where the
composition allows a realization of a geometrically favored configuration, the
hydrodynamics enhances the evolution into this configuration. We restrict our
model and numerics to stationary surfaces and validate the numerical approach
with various benchmark problems and convergence studies.

<h3>Reversible stepwise condensation polymerization with cyclization:  strictly alternating co-polymerization and homopolymerization based upon two  orthogonal reactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04082" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04082</a>

<i>Michael Lang, Kiran Suresh Kumar</i>
<br>
<br>
In a preceding work [M. Lang, K. Kumar, A simple and general approach for
reversible condensation polymerization with cyclization, Macromolecules 54
(2021) 7021], we have introduced a simple recursive scheme that allows to treat
stepwise linear reversible polymerizations of any kind with cyclization. This
approach is used to discuss the polymerization of linear Gaussian strands (LGS)
with two different reactive groups $A$ and $B$ on either chain end that
participate in two orthogonal reactions and the strictly alternating
copolymerization of LGS that carry $A$ reactive groups with LGS equipped with
type $B$ reactive groups. The former of these cases has not been discussed
theoretically in literature, the latter only regarding some special cases. We
provide either analytical expressions or exact numerical solutions for the
general cases with and without cyclization. Weight distributions, averages,
polydispersity, and the weight fractions of cyclic and linear species are
computed. All numerical solutions were tested by Monte-Carlo simulations.

Tissue dynamics and collective cell motion are crucial biological processes.
Their biological machinery is mostly known, and simulation models such as the
"active vertex model" (AVM) exist and yield reasonable agreement with
experimental observations like tissue fluidization or fingering. However, a
good and well-founded continuum description for tissues remains to be
developed. In this work we derive a macroscopic description for a
two-dimensional cell monolayer by coarse-graining the vertex model through the
Poisson bracket approach. We obtain equations for cell density, velocity and
the cellular shape tensor. We then study the homogeneous steady states, their
stability (which coincides with thermodynamic stability), and especially their
behavior under an externally applied shear. Our results contribute to elucidate
the interplay between flow and cellular shape. The obtained macroscopic
equations present a good starting point for adding cell motion, morphogenetic
and other biologically relevant processes.

<h3>Self-solidifying active droplets showing memory-induced chirality</h3>

<br>
<br>
Most synthetic microswimmers do not reach the autonomy of their biological
counterparts in terms of energy supply and diversity of motion. Here we report
the first all-aqueous droplet swimmer powered by self-generated polyelectrolyte
gradients, which shows memory-induced chirality while self-solidifying. An
aqueous solution of surface tension-lowering polyelectrolytes self-solidifies
on the surface of acidic water, during which polyelectrolytes are gradually
emitted into the surrounding water and induce linear self-propulsion via
spontaneous symmetry breaking. The low diffusion coefficient of the
polyelectrolytes leads to long-lived chemical trails which cause memory effects
that drive a transition from linear to chiral motion without requiring any
imposed symmetry breaking. The droplet swimmer is capable of highly efficient
removal (up to 85%) of uranium from aqueous solutions within 90 min, benefiting
from self-propulsion and flow-induced mixing. Our results provide a route to
fueling self-propelled agents which can autonomously perform chiral motion and
collect toxins.

<h3>Three Dimensional Spontaneous Flow Transition in Active Polar Fluids</h3>

Active liquid crystals exhibit spontaneous flow when sufficient active stress
is generated by internal molecular mechanisms. This is also referred to as
active Fr\'{e}edericksz transition. We show this transition in three dimensions
and study its dependence on the boundary conditions. Using nonlinear numerical
solutions and linear perturbation analysis, we find an out-of-plane transition
under extensile active stress for perpendicular polarity anchoring at the
boundary, whereas parallel anchoring permits both in-plane flow under
contractile stress and out-of-plane wrinkling under extensile stress.

<h3>XY* transition and extraordinary boundary criticality from fractional  exciton condensation in quantum Hall bilayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03703" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03703</a>
<br>
<i>Ya-Hui Zhang, Zheng Zhu, Ashvin Vishwanath</i>
<br>
<br>
XY* transitions represent one of the simplest examples of unconventional
quantum criticality, in which fractionally charged excitations condense into a
superfluid, and display novel features that combine quantum criticality and
fractionalization. Nevertheless their experimental realization is challenging.
Here we propose to study the XY* transition in quantum Hall bilayers at filling
$(\nu_1,\nu_2)=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3})$ where the exciton condensate (EC)
phase plays the role of the superfluid. Supported by exact diagonalization
calculation, we argue that there is a continuous transition between an EC phase
at small bilayer separation to a pair of decoupled fractional quantum Hall
states, at large separation. The transition is driven by condensation of a
fractional exciton, a bound state of Laughlin quasiparticle and quasihole, and
is in the XY* universality class. The fractionalization is manifested by
unusual properties including a large anomalous exponent and fractional
universal conductivity, which can be conveniently measured through inter-layer
tunneling and counter-flow transport, respectively. We also show that the edge
is likely to realize the newly predicted extra-ordinary boundary criticality.
Our work highlights the promise of quantum Hall bilayers as an ideal platform
for exploring exotic bulk and boundary critical behaviors, that are amenable to
immediate experimental exploration in dual-gated bilayer systems.

<h3>$U(1)$ symmetry-enriched toric code</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03707" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03707</a>
<br>
<i>Kai-Hsin Wu, Alexey Khudorozhkov, Guilherme Delfino, Dmitry Green, Claudio Chamon</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose and study a generalization of Kitaev's $\mathbb Z_2$ toric code on
a square lattice with an additional global $U(1)$ symmetry. Using Quantum Monte
Carlo simulation, we find that the system exhibits topological order with clear
indications of UV/IR mixing, i.e., the topological degeneracy of the ground
state depends on the microscopic details of the lattice akin to models with
fractonic topological order. Unlike typical fractonic models, the topological
degeneracy of our model depends on the direction of the lattice tilt relative
to the directions of the torus cycles. In particular, we observe that while the
usual compactification along the vertical/horizontal lines of the square
lattice shows a two-fold degeneracy, compactifying the lattice at $45^\circ$
leads to a three-fold topological degeneracy. We cannot rule out that the
topological order is non-Abelian. In addition to its unusual topological
properties, this system also exhibits Hilbert space fragmentation. Finally, we
propose a candidate experimental realization of the model in an array of
superconducting quantum wires.

<h3>Rydberg Excitons and Trions in Monolayer MoTe$_2$</h3>

Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) semiconductors exhibit
strong excitonic optical resonances which serve as a microscopic, non-invasive
probe into their fundamental properties. Like the hydrogen atom, such excitons
can exhibit an entire Rydberg series of resonances. Excitons have been
extensively studied in most TMDCs (MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$), but
detailed exploration of excitonic phenomena has been lacking in the important
TMDC material molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe$_2$). Here, we report an
experimental investigation of excitonic luminescence properties of monolayer
MoTe$_2$ to understand the excitonic Rydberg series, up to 3s. We report
significant modification of emission energies with temperature (4K to 300K),
quantifying the exciton-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we observe a strongly
gate-tunable exciton-trion interplay for all the Rydberg states governed mainly
by free-carrier screening, Pauli blocking, and band-gap renormalization in
agreement with the results of first-principles GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation
approach calculations. Our results help bring monolayer MoTe$_2$ closer to its
potential applications in near-infrared optoelectronics and photonic devices.

<h3>Computationally efficient Monte Carlo electron transport algorithm for  nanostructured thermoelectric material configurations</h3>

Monte Carlo statistical ray-tracing methods are commonly employed to simulate
carrier transport in nanostructured materials. In the case of a large degree of
nanostructuring and under linear response (small driving fields), these
simulations tend to be computationally overly expensive due to the difficulty
in gathering the required flux statistics. Here, we present a novel MC
ray-tracing algorithm with computational efficiency of at least an order of
magnitude compared to existing algorithms. Our new method, which is a hybrid of
analytical Boltzmann transport equation and Monte Carlo uses a reduced number
of ray-tracing particles, avoids current statistical challenges such as the
subtraction of two opposite going fluxes, the application of a driving force
altogether, and the large simulation time required for low energy carriers. We
demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency and power in accurate simulations in
large domain nanostructures with multiple defects. We believe that the new
method we present is indeed more robust and user friendly compared to common
methods, and can enable the efficient study of transport in nanostructured
materials under low-field steady-state conditions.

Motivated by recent interests in fracton topological phases, we explore
interplay between gapped 2D $\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological phases which admit
fractional excitations with restricted mobility and geometry of the lattice on
which such phases are placed. We investigate the properties of the phases in a
new geometric context -- graph theory. By placing the phases on a 2D lattice
consisting of two arbitrary connected graphs, $G_x\boxtimes G_y$, we study the
behavior of fractional excitations of the phases. We derive the formula of the
ground state degeneracy of the phases, which depends on invariant factors of
the Laplacian.

<h3>Sputtered terbium iron garnet films with perpendicular magnetic  anisotropy for spintronic applications</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03758" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03758</a>

We report the structural, magnetic, and interfacial spin transport properties
of epitaxial terbium iron garnet (TbIG) ultrathin films deposited by magnetron
sputtering. High crystallinity was achieved by growing the films on gadolinium
gallium garnet (GGG) substrates either at high temperature, or at room
temperature followed by thermal annealing, above 750 {\deg}C in both cases. The
films display large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) induced by
compressive strain, and tunable structural and magnetic properties through
growth conditions or the substrate lattice parameter choice. The ferrimagnetic
compensation temperature (TM) of selected TbIG films was measured through
temperature-dependent anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in Pt/TbIG heterostructures.
In the studied films, TM was found to be between 190-225 K, i.e., approximately
25-60 K lower than the bulk value, which is attributed to the combined action
of Tb deficiency and oxygen vacancies in the garnet lattice evidenced by x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Sputtered TbIG ultrathin films with
large PMA and highly tunable properties reported here can provide a suitable
material platform for a wide range of spintronic experiments and device
applications.

<h3>PyRates -- A Code-Generation Tool for Dynamical Systems Modeling</h3>

Systems of differential equations are commonly used to model real-world
dynamical systems. In most cases, numerical methods are needed to study these
systems. There are many freely available software solutions that implement
numerical methods for dynamical systems analysis. However, these different
software solutions have different requirements for user-supplied models, which
makes it difficult to set up dynamical system analysis workflows using multiple
tools and complicates sharing of workflows within the scientific community.
PyRates is a software tool for modeling and analyzing dynamical systems using a
variety of programming languages. It provides a unified interface for defining
complex, hierarchical models, either via simple YAML files or via a Python user
interface. PyRates uses code generation to translate user-defined models into
"backend" implementations in languages such as Python, Fortran, and Julia,
providing access to a wide range of dynamical system analysis methods. We
demonstrate the capabilities of PyRates in three use cases, showing how it can
generate (i) NumPy code for numerical simulations via SciPy, (ii) Fortran code
for bifurcation analysis and parameter continuations via PyCoBi, and (iii)
PyTorch code for neural network optimization via RectiPy. Furthermore, we show
that PyRates is well suited as a model definition interface for other dynamical
systems tools. To this end, we introduce PyCoBi and RectiPy, two software
packages that we developed as extensions of PyRates for specific dynamical
systems modeling applications.

<h3>Computational capability for physical reservoir computing using a  spin-torque oscillator with two free layers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03769" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03769</a>
<br>
<i>Terufumi Yamaguchi, Sumito Tsunegi, Kohei Nakajima, Tomohiro Taniguchi</i>
<br>
<br>
A numerical analysis on the computational capability of physical reservoir
computing utilizing a spin-torque oscillator with two free layers is reported.
Conventional spintronics devices usually consist of two ferromagnets, where the
direction of magnetization in one layer, called the free layer, can move while
that of the other, the reference layer, is fixed. Recently, however, devices
with two free layers, where the reference layer is replaced by another free
layer, have been developed for various practical applications. Adding another
free layer drastically changes the dynamical response of the device through the
couplings via the spin-transfer effect and the dipole magnetic field. A
numerical simulation of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation and a statistical
analyses of the Lyapunov exponent and the synchronization index reveal the
appearance of an amplitude-modulated oscillation and chaos in the oscillators
with two free layers. Such complex dynamics qualitatively change the
computational capability of physical reservoir computing because the
computational resource is dynamics of the physical system. An evaluation of the
short-term memory capacity clarifies that oscillators with two free layers have
a larger capacity than those of conventional oscillators. An enhancement in
capacity near the edge of echo state property, i.e., the boundary between zero
and finite synchronization index, is also found.

<h3>Single and two-cells shape analysis from energy functionals for  three-dimensional vertex models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03785" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03785</a>

Vertex models have been extensively used for simulating the evolution of
multicellular systems, and have given rise to important global properties
concerning their macroscopic rheology or jamming transitions. These models are
based on the definition of an energy functional, which fully determines the
cellular response and conclusions. While two-dimensional vertex models have
been widely employed, three-dimensional models are far more scarce, mainly due
to the large amount of configurations that they may adopt and the complex
geometrical transitions they undergo. We here investigate the shape of single
and two-cells configurations as a function of the energy terms, and we study
the dependence of the final shape on the model parameters: namely the exponent
of the term penalising cell-cell adhesion and surface contractility. In single
cell analysis, we deduce analytically the radius and limit values of the
contractility for linear and quadratic surface energy terms, in 2D and 3D. In
two-cells systems, we deduce the evolution of the aspect ratio. While in
functionals with linear surface terms yield the same aspect ratio in 2D and 3D,
the configurations when using quadratic surface terms are distinct. We relate
our results with well-known solutions from capillarity theory, and verify our
analytical findings with a three-dimensional vertex model.

<h3>Impurity-induced phonon thermal Hall effect in the antiferromagnetic  phase of Sr2IrO4</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03796" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03796</a>
<br>
<i>Amirreza Ataei, Gael Grissonnanche, Marie-Eve Boulanger, Lu Chen, Etienne Lefrancois, Veronique Brouet, Louis Taillefer</i>
<br>
<br>
A thermal Hall effect is observed in an increasing number of insulators often
attributed to phonons, but the underlying mechanism is in most cases unknown. A
coupling of phonons to spins has been invoked and scattering of phonons by
impurities or defects has been proposed, but there is no systematic evidence to
support either scenario. Here we present a study on the effect of adding Rh
impurities to the antiferromagnetic insulator Sr2IrO4, substituting for the
spin-carrying Ir atoms. We find that adding small concentrations of Rh
impurities increases the thermal Hall conductivity dramatically, but adding
enough Rh to suppress the magnetic order eventually decreases the thermal Hall
conductivity until it nearly vanishes. We conclude that the thermal Hall effect
in this material is caused by the scattering of phonons by impurities embedded
within a magnetic environment.

<h3>Microstructure-dependent magnetic properties of iron silicon single, bi-  and oligo-crystals measured with a miniaturised Single-Sheet-Tester</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03808" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03808</a>

<br>
Electrical iron silicon steel is the most commonly used soft magnetic
material in electrical energy conversion and transmission, and its demand is
expected to increase with the need for electrification of the transportation
sector and the transition to renewable energy to combat climate change.
Although iron silicon steel has been used for more than 100 years, some
fundamental relationships between microstructure and magnetic performance
remain vague, especially with regard to the role of crystal defects such as
grain boundaries and dislocations that are induced during the final cutting
step of the process chain. In this paper we present first results of a new
approach to quantify the effects of orientation, grain boundaries and
deformation on the magnetic properties of single, bi- and oligo-crystals using
a miniaturised Single-Sheet-Tester. In this way, we were able to better resolve
the orientation-dependent polarisation curves at low field strengths, revealing
an additional intersection between the medium and hard axis. Furthermore, we
were able to distinguish the effects of different deformation structures - from
single dislocations to tangles to localised deformation and twins - on
different magnetic properties such as on coercivity, remanence and
susceptibility, and we found that our particular grain boundary strongly
reduces the remanence.

<h3>pyTDGL: Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau in Python</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03812" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03812</a>
<br>
<i>Logan Bishop-Van Horn</i>
<br>
<br>
Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) theory is a phenomenological model for
the dynamics of superconducting systems. Due to its simplicity in comparison to
microscopic theories and its effectiveness in describing the observed
properties of the superconducting state, TDGL is widely used to interpret or
explain measurements of superconducting devices. Here, we introduce
$\texttt{pyTDGL}$, a Python package that solves a generalized TDGL model for
superconducting thin films of arbitrary geometry, enabling simulations of
vortex and phase dynamics in mesoscopic superconducting devices.
$\texttt{pyTDGL}$ can model the nonlinear magnetic response and dynamics of
multiply connected films, films with multiple current bias terminals, and films
with a spatially inhomogeneous critical temperature. We demonstrate these
capabilities by modeling quasi-equilibrium vortex distributions in irregularly
shaped films, and the dynamics and current-voltage-field characteristics of
nanoscale superconducting quantum interference devices (nanoSQUIDs).

<h3>Cluster Toroidal Multipoles Formed by Electric-Quadrupole and  Magnetic-Octupole Trimers: A Possible Scenario for Hidden Orders in  Ca$_5$Ir$_3$O$_{12}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Cluster multipole orderings composed of atomic high-rank multipole moments
are theoretically investigated with a 5$d$-electron compound
Ca$_5$Ir$_3$O$_{12}$ in mind. Ca$_5$Ir$_3$O$_{12}$ exhibits two hidden orders:
One is an intermediate-temperature phase with time-reversal symmetry and the
other is a low-temperature phase without time-reversal symmetry. By performing
the symmetry and augmented multipole analyses for a $d$-orbital model under the
hexagonal point group $D_{\rm 3h}$, we find that the 120$^{\circ}$-type
ordering of the electric quadrupole corresponds to cluster electric toroidal
dipole ordering with the electric ferroaxial moment, which can become the
microscopic origin of the intermediate-temperature phase in
Ca$_5$Ir$_3$O$_{12}$. Furthermore, based on ${}^{193}$Ir
synchrotron-radiation-based M\"{o}ssbauer spectroscopy, we propose that the
low-temperature phase in Ca$_5$Ir$_3$O$_{12}$ is regarded as a coexisting state
with cluster electric toroidal dipole and cluster magnetic toroidal quadrupole,
the latter of which is formed by the 120$^{\circ}$-type ordering of the
magnetic octupole and accompanies a small uniform magnetization as a secondary
effect. Our results provide a clue to two hidden phases in
Ca$_5$Ir$_3$O$_{12}$.

<h3>Phase transitions and spin dynamics of the quasi-one dimensional  Ising-like antiferromagnet BaCo$_{2}$V$_{2}$O$_{8}$ in a longitudinal  magnetic field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03833" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03833</a>
<br>
<i>Shintaro Takayoshi, Quentin Faure, Virginie Simonet, Béatrice Grenier, Sylvain Petit, Jacques Ollivier, Pascal Lejay, Thierry Giamarchi</i>
<br>
<br>
By combining inelastic neutron scattering and numerical simulations, we study
the quasi-one dimensional Ising-like quantum antiferromagnet
BaCo$_{2}$V$_{2}$O$_{8}$ in a longitudinal magnetic field applied along the
magnetic anisotropy axis, which is also the chain direction. The external field
closes the excitation gap due to the magnetic anisotropy, inducing a transition
from the N\'eel ordered state to an incommensurate longitudinal spin density
wave phase. If the field is increased further, another transition into a
transverse antiferromagnetic phase takes place at 9 T due to the competition
between longitudinal and transverse correlations. We numerically and
experimentally show that the model of XXZ chains connected by a weak interchain
interaction well reproduces this transition. We also calculate the dynamical
susceptibility and demonstrate that it agrees quantitatively with inelastic
neutron scattering measurements. In contrast to the abrupt change of magnetic
ordering, the spectra do not change much at the transition at 9 T, and the spin
dynamics can be described as a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. We also refine the
modeling of BaCo$_{2}$V$_{2}$O$_{8}$ by including a four-site periodic term
arising from the crystal structure which enables to account for an anomaly of
the magnetic susceptibility appearing at 19 T as well as for the anticrossing
observed in the inelastic neutron scattering spectra.

<h3>Data-Driven Prediction of Complex Crystal Structures of Dense Lithium</h3>

Lithium (Li) is a prototypical simple metal at ambient conditions, but
exhibits remarkable changes in structural and electronic properties under
compression. There has been intense debate about the structure of dense Li, and
recent experiments offered fresh evidence for new yet undetermined crystalline
phases near the enigmatic melting minimum region in the pressure-temperature
phase diagram of Li. Here, we report on an extensive exploration of the energy
landscape of Li using an advanced crystal structure search method combined with
a machine learning approach, which greatly expands the scale of structure
search, leading to the prediction of four complex Li crystal phases containing

<h3>Impact of Zr substitution on the electronic structure of ferroelectric  hafnia</h3>

$\mathrm{HfO_2}$-based dielectrics are promising for nanoscale ferroelectric
applications, and the most favorable material within the family is
Zr-substituted hafnia, i.e., $\mathrm{Hf_{1-x}Zr_xO_2}$ (HZO). The extent of Zr
substitution can be great, and x is commonly set to 0.5. However, the band gap
of $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ is lower than $\mathrm{HfO_2}$, thus it is uncertain how
the Zr content should influence the electronic band structure of HZO. A reduced
band gap is detrimental to the cycling endurance as charge injection and
dielectric breakdown would become easier. Another issue is regarding the
comparison on the band gaps between $\mathrm{HfO_2}$/$\mathrm{ZrO_2}$
superlattices and HZO solid-state solutions. In this work we systematically
investigated the electronic structures of $\mathrm{HfO_2}$, $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$
and HZO using self-energy corrected density functional theory. In particular,
the conduction band minimum of $Pca2_1$-$\mathrm{HfO_2}$ is found to lie at an
ordinary k-point on the Brillouin zone border, not related to any interlines
between high-symmetry k-points. Moreover, the rule of HZO band gap variation
with respect to x has been extracted. The physical mechanisms for the
exponential reduction regime and linear decay regime have been revealed. The
band gaps of $\mathrm{HfO_2}$/$\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ ferroelectric superlattices are
investigated in a systematic manner, and the reason why the superlattice could
possess a band gap lower than that of $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ is revealed through
comprehensive analysis.

Strongly correlated ground states and exotic quasiparticle excitations in
low-dimensional systems are central research topics in the solid state research
community. The present work develops a new layered material and explores the
physical properties. Single crystals of 3R-Na2MnTeO6 were synthesized via a
flux method. Single crystal x-ray diffraction and transmission electron
microscopy reveal a crystal structure with ABC-type stacking and an R-3 space
group, which establishes this material as a stacking polytype to previously
reported 2H-Na2MnTeO6. Magnetic and heat capacity measurements demonstrate
dominant antiferromagnetic interactions, the absence of long-range magnetic
order down to 0.5 K, and field-dependent short range magnetic correlations. A
structural transition at ~ 23 K observed in dielectric measurements may be
related to displacements of the Na positions. Our results demonstrate that
3R-Na2MnTeO6 displays low-dimensional magnetism, disordered structure and
spins, and the system displays a rich structure variety.

Electrons and holes can spontaneously form excitons and condense in a
semimetal or semiconductor, as predicted decades ago. This type of Bose
condensation can happen at much higher temperatures in comparison with dilute
atomic gases. Two-dimensional (2D) materials with reduced Coulomb screening
around the Fermi level are promising for realizing such a system. Here we
report a change of the band structure accompanied by a phase transition at
about 180 K in single-layer ZrTe2 based on angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements. Below the transition temperature, gap
opening and development of an ultra-flat band top around the zone center are
observed. This gap and the phase transition are rapidly suppressed with extra
carrier densities introduced by adding more layers or dopants on the surface.
The results suggest the formation of an excitonic insulating ground state in
single-layer ZrTe2, and the findings are rationalized by first? principles
calculations and a self-consistent mean-field theory. Our study provides
evidence for exciton condensation in a 2D semimetal and demonstrates strong
dimensionality effects on the formation of intrinsic bound electron-hole pairs
in solids.

<h3>Variational Tensor Wavefunctions for the Interacting Quantum Spin Hall  Phase</h3>

The quantum spin hall (QSH) phase, also known as the two-dimensional
topological insulator, hosts helical edge modes protected by time-reversal
symmetry. While first proposed as a band insulator, this phase can also be
realized in strongly-correlated systems, where the band theory fails to be a
good description. To simulate such a phase in realistic correlated models, it
is necessary to provide a generic variational ansatz for the interacting QSH
phase. In this work, we propose a framework to construct variational
wavefunctions for this phase using fermionic tensor network states. Based on
the exactly solvable model built from commuting projectors, we construct a
tensor representation of the fixed point wavefunction and extract a set of
tensor equations describing symmetry transformation rules on this tensor
network. From these equations, we derive the anomalous edge theory, which
indicates that such equations indeed give a complete description of the phase.
Solutions of tensor equations then give variational ansatz for the QSH phase.
Our method would serve as the first step to simulate this phase with tensor
algorithms in strongly-correlated systems.

The concept of chirality is of great relevance in nature, from chiral
molecules such as sugar to parity transformations in particle physics. In
condensed matter physics, recent studies have demonstrated chiral fermions and
their relevance in emergent phenomena closely related to topology. The
experimental verification of chiral phonons (bosons) remains challenging,
however, despite their expected strong impact on fundamental physical
properties. Here we show experimental proof of chiral phonons using resonant
inelastic X-ray scattering with circularly polarized X rays. Using the
prototypical chiral material, quartz, we demonstrate that circularly polarized
X rays, which are intrinsically chiral, couple to chiral phonons at specific
positions in reciprocal space, allowing us to determine the chiral dispersion
of the lattice modes. Our experimental proof of chiral phonons demonstrates a
new degree of freedom in condensed matter that is both of fundamental
importance and opens the door to exploration of novel emergent phenomena based
on chiral bosons

<br>
<br>
A quaternary compound with the composition Mo$_{3}$ReRuC is obtained in a
previously unexplored MoReRu-Mo$_{2}$C system. According to x-ray structural
analysis, Mo$_{3}$ReRuC crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space group
$P$4$_{1}$32 (cubic $\beta$-Mn type structure, $a$ = 6.8107(1) {\AA}). Below
7.7 K, Mo$_{3}$ReRuC becomes a bulk type-II superconductor with an upper
critical field close to the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The specific heat data
gives a large normalized jump $\Delta$$C_{\rm p}$/$\gamma$$T_{\rm c}$ = 2.3 at
$T_{\rm c}$, which points to a strongly coupled superconducting state. First
principles calculations show that its electronic states at the Fermi level are
mainly contributed by Mo, Re and Ru atoms and strongly increased by the
spin-orbit coupling. Our finding suggests that the intermediate phase between
alloys and carbides may be a good place to look for $\beta$-Mn type
noncentrosymmetric superconductors.

<h3>First-principles studies of oxygen defects in RbPbI$_3$ halide for  perovskite solar cells</h3>

<br>
<br>
Recently research on perovskite solar cells has caught much attention for new
energy materials. Defects such as oxygen or water are important for the
stability of structural and electrical properties as well as the performance of
perovskite solar cells. Here we have explored the use of density-functional
theory in combination with dispersion forces to study the effect of oxygen atom
and molecule on the crystal structure, and hence the electronic structure of
RbPbI$_3$, which is rather unexplored material for defects. A significant
reduction in the optical band gap (from 2 eV to < 1 eV) has been found due to
the formation of defect levels dominated by oxygen and iodine when there are
interstitial oxygen defects. This would in turn compromise the optical
properties for harvesting light. The density of states suggested the oxygen
defects would trap the electrons, thus affecting the electron transport as
well. The comparison between oxygen atom and molecules is consistent with the
previous report about oxygen molecule passivation of perovskite solar cells.
Our work has, therefore, provided an important and timely theoretical insight
and guidance to materials processing and fabrication for preventing performance
degradation by eliminating oxygen defects in perovskite solar cells.

<h3>Generalized Langevin equation with shear flow and its  fluctuation-dissipation theorems derived from a Caldeira-Leggett Hamiltonian</h3>

<br>
<br>
We provide a first-principles derivation of the Langevin equation with shear
flow and its corresponding fluctuation-dissipation theorems. Shear flow of
simple fluids has been widely investigated by numerical simulations. Most
studies postulate a Markovian Langevin equation with a simple shear drag term
\`a la Stokes. However, this choice has never been justified from first
principles. We start from a particle-bath system described by a classical
Caldeira-Leggett Hamiltonian modified by adding a term proportional to the
strain-rate tensor according to Hoover's DOLLS method, and we derive a
generalized Langevin equation for the sheared system. We then compute,
analytically, the noise time-correlation functions in different regimes. Based
on the intensity of the shear-rate, we can distinguish between
close-to-equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium states. According to the results
presented here, the standard, simple and Markovian form of the Langevin
equation with shear flow postulated in the literature is valid only in the
limit of extremely weak shear rates compared to the effective vibrational
temperature of the bath. For even marginally higher shear rates, the
(generalized) Langevin equation is strongly non-Markovian and non-trivial
fluctuation-dissipation theorems are derived.

<h3>Tunable correlation effects of magnetic impurities by the cubic Rashba  spin-orbit couplings</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03993" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03993</a>

<i>Peng Xiong-Tao, Lin Fang, Chen Liang, Li Lin, Xu Dong-Hui, Sun Jin-Hua</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically study the influence of the $k$-cubic Rashba spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) on the correlation effects of magnetic impurities by combining
the variational method and the Hirsch-Fye quantum Monte Carlo (HFQMC)
simulations. Markedly different from the normal $k$-linear Rashba SOC, even a
small cubic Rashba term can greatly alter the band structure and induce a Van
Hove singularity in a wide range of energy, thus the single impurity local
moment becomes largely tunable. The cubic Rashba SOC adopted in this work
breaks the rotational symmetry, but the host material is still invariant under
the operations $\mathcal{R}^z(\pi)$, $\mathcal{IR}^z(\pi/2)$,
$\mathcal{M}_{xz}$, $\mathcal{M}_{yz}$, where $\mathcal{R}^z(\theta)$ is the
rotation of angle $\theta$ about the $z$-axis, $\mathcal{I}$ is the inversion
operator and $\mathcal{M}_{xz}$ ($\mathcal{M}_{yz}$) is the mirror reflection
about the $x$-$z$ ($y$-$z$) principal plane. Saliently, various components of
spin-spin correlation between the single magnetic impurity and the conduction
electrons show three- or six-fold rotational symmetry. This unique feature is
due to the triple winding of the spins with a $2\pi$ rotation of $\mathbf{k}$,
which is a hallmark of the cubic Rashba effect and can possibly be an
identifier to distinguish the cubic Rashba SOC from the normal $k$-linear
Rashba term in experiments. Although the cubic Rashba term drastically alters
the electronic properties of the host, we find that the spatial decay rate of
the spin-spin correlation function remains essentially unchanged. Moreover, the
carrier-mediated Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions between two
magnetic impurities show twisted features, the ferromagnetic diagonal terms
dominate when two magnetic impurities are very close, but the off-diagonal
terms become important at long distances.

<h3>Transport properties of a 1000-nm HgTe film: the interplay of surface  and bulk carriers</h3>

<i>M. L. Savchenko, D. A. Kozlov, N. N. Mikhailov, S. A. Dvoretsky, Z. D. Kvon</i>
<br>
<br>
We report on systematic study of transport properties of a 1000-nm HgTe film.
Unlike to thinner and strained HgTe films, which are known as high-quality
three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators, the film under study is much
thicker than the limit of pseudomorphic growth of HgTe on a CdTe substrate.
Therefore, it is expected to be fully relaxed and has the band structure of
bulk HgTe, i.e., a zero gap semiconductor. Nevertheless, since the bands
inversion the two-dimensional (2D) topological surface states are still
expected to exist. To check this claim we studied classical and quantum
transport response of the system. We demonstrate that by tuning the top-gate
voltage one can change the electron-dominating transport to the hole one. The
highest electron mobility is found to be more than $300 \times 10^3$ cm$^2$/Vs.
The system exhibits Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations with a complicated
pattern and shows up to 5 independent frequencies in corresponding Fourier
spectra. They are attributed to the topological surface states,
Volkov-Pankratov states and spin-degenerate bulk states in the accumulation
layer near the gate. The observed peculiarities of the quantum transport are
the strong SdH oscillations of the Hall resistance, and the suppressed
oscillatory response of the topological surface states.

<h3>Diffusionless relaxation of half-skyrmion liquid, hexatic, and  crystalline states in a chiral molecular crystal</h3>

Particles in a crowded environment exhibit slow anomalous diffusion, as seen
in biological systems, polymer solutions, glass-forming liquids and granular
materials, and our daily experiences. In crystals, constituent particles do not
diffuse, but skyrmions and half-skyrmions, spatially localised quasiparticles,
exhibit normal diffusion in dilute conditions. However, the cooperative
dynamics and diffusion of (half-)skyrmions in liquid, hexatic, and crystalline
phases are elusive. Here we show that the fusion and fission of half-skyrmions,
not their diffusion, are responsible for the primary structural relaxation in
these condensed phases. The diffusion, which contributes to the secondary
structural relaxation, is suppressed by cages formed by surrounding
half-skyrmions, whereas enhanced by Mermin-Wagner fluctuation characteristic to
two-dimensional systems, leading to subdiffusive motion. Large displacement of
half-skyrmions is locally induced by fusion-fission and bond-breaking between
adjacent half-skyrmions. Furthermore, the motion of half-skyrmions couples with
transverse and longitudinal sound wave excitation differently. Our result
provides a qualitative difference in dynamical properties between skyrmion
gaseous and condensed phases, suggesting the efficient manipulation of
high-density (half-)skyrmions in molecular crystals, liquid crystals, and
magnets.

<h3>Geometrical optics of first-passage functionals of random acceleration</h3>

Random acceleration is a fundamental stochastic process encountered in many
applications. In a one-dimensional version of the process a particle is
randomly accelerated according to the Langevin equation $\ddot{x}(t) =
\sqrt{2D} \xi(t)$, where $x(t)$ is the particle's coordinate, $\xi(t)$ is
Gaussian white noise with zero mean, and $D$ is the particle velocity diffusion
constant. Here we evaluate the $A\to 0$ tail of the distribution $P_n(A|L)$ of
the functional $I[x(t)]=\int_0^{T} x^n(t) dt=A$, where $T$ is the first-passage
time of the particle from a specified point $x=L$ to the origin, and $n\geq 0$.
We employ the optimal fluctuation method akin to geometrical optics. Its
crucial element is determination of the optimal path -- the most probable
realization of the random acceleration process $x(t)$ which dominates the
probability distribution $P_n(A|L)$. We show that the $A\to 0$ tail of this
distribution has a universal essential singularity, $P_n(A\to 0|L) \sim
\exp\left(-\frac{\alpha_n L^{3n+2}}{DA^3}\right)$, where $\alpha_n$ is an
$n$-dependent number which we calculate analytically for $n=0,1$ and $2$ and
numerically for other $n$. For $n=0$ the result agrees with the asymptotic of
the previously found first-passage time distribution.

obtain the Z2 invariant using the eigenvalues of the space inversion operator
in the Fu Kane framework. We also show novel quantum spin Hall state with

We study a gate-tunable superconducting qubit (gatemon) based on a thin
InAs-Al hybrid nanowire. Using a gate voltage to control its Josephson energy,
the gatemon can reach the strong coupling regime to a microwave cavity. In the
dispersive regime, we extract the energy relaxation time $T_1\sim$0.56 $\mu$s
and the dephasing time $T_2^* \sim$0.38 $\mu$s. Since thin InAs-Al nanowires
can have fewer or single sub-band occupation and recent transport experiment
shows the existence of nearly quantized zero-bias conductance peaks, our result
holds relevancy for detecting Majorana zero modes in thin InAs-Al nanowires
using circuit quantum electrodynamics.

<h3>Orbitally driven spin reorientation in Mn doped YBaCuFeO$_{5}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Oxygen-deficient layered perovskite YBaCuFeO$_{5}$ (YBCFO) is one rare
type-II multiferroic material where ferroelectricity, driven by incommensurate
spiral magnetic order, is believed to be achievable up to temperatures higher
than room temperature. A cycloidal spiral rather than helical spiral order is
essential ingredient for the existence of ferroelectricity in this material.
Motivated by a recent experimental work on Mn-doped YBCFO where the spiral
plane is observed to cant more towards the crystallographic $c$ axis upon Mn
doping at Fe sites compared to that in the parent compound, we performed a
detailed theoretical investigation using the density functional theory
calculations to understand the mechanism behind such spin reorientation. Our
total energy calculations, within GGA+U+SO approximation, reveal that Fe/Cu
spin moments indeed align more towards $c$ axis in the Mn-doped compounds than
they were in parent compound YBCFO. Largest exchange interaction (Cu-Cu in the
$ab$-plane) is observed to decrease systematically with Mn doping concentration
reflecting the lowering of transition temperature seen in experiment. Further,
the inter-bilayer Cu-Mn exchange interaction becomes ferromagnetic in the doped
compound whereas the corresponding Cu-Fe exchange was antiferromagnetic in the
parent compound giving rise to frustration in the commensurate magnetic order.
Most importantly, our electronic structure calculations reveal that in the
doped compounds because of hybridization with the d$_{z^2}$ orbital of Mn, the
highest occupied Cu orbital becomes d$_{z^2}$ as opposed to the parent compound
where the highest occupied Cu orbital is d$_{x^2-y^2}$. Therefore, we believe
that the occupancy of out of plane oriented Cu d$_{z^2}$ orbital in place of
planar d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital along with the frustrating exchange interaction
drive the spins to align along $c$ in doped compound.

<br>
Correlated two-dimensional (2D) layers, like 1T-phases of TaS2, TaSe2 and
NbSe2, exhibit rich tunability through varying interlayer couplings, which
promotes the understanding of electron-correlation in the 2D limit. However,
the coupling mechanism is, so far, poorly understood and was tentatively
ascribed to interactions among the d_(z^2 ) orbitals of Ta or Nb atoms. Here,
we theoretically show that the interlayer hybridization and localization
strength of interfacial Se pz orbitals, rather than Nb d_(z^2 ) orbitals,
govern the variation of electron-correlated properties upon interlayer sliding
or twisting in correlated magnetic 1T-NbSe2 bilayers. Each of the both layers
is in a star-of-David (SOD) charge-density-wave phase. Geometric and electronic
structures, and magnetic properties of 28 different stacking configurations
were examined and analyzed using density-functional-theory calculations. We
found that the SOD contains a localized region (Reg-L), in which interlayer Se
pz hybridization plays a paramount role in varying the energy levels of the two
Hubbard bands. These variations lead to three electronic transitions among four
insulating states, which demonstrated the effectiveness of interlayer
interactions to modulate correlated magnetic properties in a prototypical
correlated magnetic insulator.

<h3>Size effect on the thermal conductivity of a type-I clathrate</h3>

<br>
<br>
Clathrates are a materials class with an extremely low phonon thermal
conductivity, which is a key ingredient for a high thermoelectric conversion
efficiency. Here we present a study on the type-I clathrate La$_
{1.2}$Ba$_{6.8}$Au$_{5.8}$Si3$_{8.8}\square_{1.4}$ directed at lowering the
phonon thermal conductivity even further by forming mesoscopic wires out of it.
Our hypothesis is that the interaction of the low-energy rattling modes of the
guest atoms (La and Ba) with the acoustic phonons of the type-I clathrate
framework (formed by Au and Si atoms, with some vacancies $\square$) cuts off
their dispersion and thereby tilts the balance of phonons relevant for thermal
transport to long-wavelength ones. Thus, size effects are expected to set in at
relatively long length scales. The structuring was done using a top-down
approach, where the wires, ranging from 1200 nm to 600 nm in diameter, were cut
from a piece of single crystal using a focused ion beam technique. Measurements
of the thermal conductivity were performed with a self-heating 3$\omega$
technique down to 80 K. Indeed they reveal a reduction of the room-temperature
phonon thermal conductivity by a sizable fraction of about 40 % for our
thinnest wire, thereby confirming our hypothesis.

If we stack up two layers of graphene while changing their respective
orientation by some twisting angle, we end up with a system that has striking
differences when compared to single-layer graphene. For a very specific value
of this twist angle, known as magic angle, twisted bilayer graphene displays a
unique phase diagram that cannot be found in other systems. Recently, high
harmonic generation spectroscopy has been successfully applied to elucidate the
electronic properties of quantum materials. The purpose of the present work is
to exploit the nonlinear optical response of magic-angle twisted bilayer
graphene to unveil its electronic properties. We show that the band structure
of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene is imprinted onto its high-harmonic
spectrum. Specifically, we observe a drastic decrease of harmonic signal as we
approach the magic angle. Our results show that high harmonic generation can be
used as a spectroscopy tool for measuring the twist angle and also the
electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene, paving the way for an
all-optical characterization of moir\'e materials.

<br>
<br>
To study controlled evolution of non-autonomous matter-wave solitons in
spinor Bose-Einstein condensates with spatiotemporal modulation, we focus on a
system of three coupled Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations with
space-time-dependent external potentials and temporally modulated gain/loss
distributions. An integrability condition and a non-isospectral Lax pair for
the coupled GP equations are obtained. Using it, we derive an infinite set of
dynamical invariants, the first two of which are the mass and momentum. The
Darboux transform is used to generate one- and two-soliton solutions. Under the
action of different external potentials and gain/loss distributions, various
solutions for controlled non-autonomous matter-wave solitons of both
ferromagnetic and polar types are obtained, such as self-compressed, snake-like
and stepwise solitons, and as well as breathers. In particular, the formation
of states resembling rogue waves, under the action of a sign-reversible
gain-loss distribution, is demonstrated too. Shape-preserving and changing
interactions between two non-autonomous matter-wave solitons and bound states
of solitons are addressed too. In this context, spin switching arises in the
polar-ferromagnetic interaction. Stability of the non-autonomous matter-wave
solitons is verified by means of systematic simulations of their perturbed
evolution.

by an all-to-all coupling Hamiltonian and by dissipation featuring collective
``state-dependent" rates. The latter encodes local incoherent transitions that
depend on average properties of the system. This type of open quantum dynamics
can be seen as a generalization of classical (mean-field) stochastic Markov
dynamics, in which transitions depend on the instantaneous configuration of the
system, to the quantum domain. We study the time evolution in the limit of
infinitely large systems, and we demonstrate the exactness of the mean-field
equations for the dynamics of average operators. We further derive the
effective dynamical generator governing the time evolution of (quasi-)local
operators. Our results allow for a rigorous and systematic investigation of the
impact of quantum effects on paradigmatic classical models, such as quantum
generalized Hopfield associative memories or (mean-field)
kinetically-constrained models.

Motivated by the recent synthesis of a number of Mott insulating
square-kagome materials, we explore the rich phenomenology of frustrated
magnetism induced by this lattice geometry, also referred to as the squagome or
shuriken lattice. On the classical level, square-kagome antiferromagnets are
found to exhibit extensive degeneracies, order-by-disorder, and non-coplanar
ordering tendencies, which we discuss for an elementary, classical Heisenberg
model with nearest-neighbor and cross-plaquette interactions. Having in mind
that upon introducing quantum fluctuations non-coplanar order can melt into
chiral quantum spin liquids, we provide detailed information on the multitude
of non-coplanar orders, including some which break rotational symmetry
(possibly leading to nematic quantum orders), as well as a number of
(incommensurate) spin spiral phases. Using extensive numerical simulations, we
also discuss the thermodynamic signatures of these phases, which often show
multi-step thermal ordering. Our comprehensive discussion of the classical
square-kagome Heisenberg model, often drawing comparisons to the conventional
kagome antiferromagnet, sets the stage for future explorations of quantum
analogs of the various phases, either conceptually such as in quantum spin-1/2
generalizations of our model or experimentally such as in the Cu-based
candidate materials.

We analyze quantum fluctuation effects at the onset of charge or spin density
wave order with a $2k_F$ wave vector $\mathbf{Q}$ in two-dimensional metals --
for the special case where $\mathbf{Q}$ connects a pair of hot spots situated
at high symmetry points of the Fermi surface with a vanishing Fermi surface
curvature. We compute the order parameter susceptibility and the fermion
self-energy in one-loop approximation. The susceptibility has a pronounced peak
at $\mathbf{Q}$, and the self-energy displays non-Fermi liquid behavior at the
hot spots, with a linear frequency dependence of its imaginary part. The real
part of the one-loop self-energy exhibits logarithmic divergences with
universal prefactors as a function of both frequency and momentum, which may be
interpreted as perturbative signatures of power laws with universal anomalous
dimensions. As a result, one obtains a non-Fermi liquid metal with a vanishing
quasiparticle weight at the hot spots, and a renormalized dispersion relation
with anomalous algebraic momentum dependencies near the hot spots.

We adapt and optimize the projected-pair-entangled-state (PEPS) algorithm on
finite lattices (fPEPS) for two-dimensional Hubbard models and apply the
algorithm to the Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hopping on a square
lattice. In particular, we formulate the PEPS algorithm using projected
entangled pair operators, incorporate SU(2) symmetry in all tensor indices, and
optimize the PEPS using both iterative-diagonalization-based local bond
optimization and gradient-based optimization of the PEPS. We discuss the
performance and convergence of the algorithm for the Hubbard model on lattice
sizes of up to 8x8 for PEPS states with U(1) symmetric bond dimensions of up to
D = 8 and SU(2) symmetric bond dimensions of up to D = 6. Finally, we comment
on the relative and overall efficiency of schemes for optimizing fPEPS.

The current-driven motion of magnetic skyrmions, as topologically protected
winding vector fields of local magnetization, has attracted considerable
attention due to both fundamental interest in the dynamics of topological
solitons, and potential spintronic applications. While widely-used Thiele
equation with zero skyrmion mass captures its rigid motion under the assumption
of preserved skyrmion shape, experiments on realistic skyrmions find deviation
due to inertial mass with numerous attempts to account for it by invoking
internal skyrmion dynamics, geometry of the nanowire, and interaction with
magnons or phonons. However, experimentally observed skyrmion mass is often
much larger than predicted by these theories. In this Letter, we employ
Schwinger-Keldysh field-theoretical approach to study conduction electrons
interacting with localized magnetic moments comprising a skyrmion to obtain a
stochastic differential equation of its motion. By analyzing its time-retarded
damping kernel, we extract an anisotropic mass governed by conduction electrons
and demonstrate its substantial effect on the current-driven skyrmion motion,
even in the absence of any skyrmion deformation.

Quantifying uncertainty associated with the microstructure variation of a
material can be a computationally daunting task, especially when dealing with
advanced constitutive models and fine mesh resolutions in the crystal
plasticity finite element method (CPFEM). Numerous studies have been conducted
regarding the sensitivity of material properties and performance to the mesh
resolution and choice of constitutive model. However, a unified approach that
accounts for various fidelity parameters, such as mesh resolutions, integration
time-steps, and constitutive models simultaneously is currently lacking. This
paper proposes a novel uncertainty quantification (UQ) approach for computing
the properties and performance of homogenized materials using CPFEM, that
exploits a hierarchy of approximations with different levels of fidelity. In
particular, we illustrate how multi-level sampling methods, such as multi-level
Monte Carlo (MLMC) and multi-index Monte Carlo (MIMC), can be applied to assess
the impact of variations in the microstructure of polycrystalline materials on
the predictions of homogenized materials properties. We show that by adaptively
exploiting the fidelity hierarchy, we can significantly reduce the number of
microstructures required to reach a certain prescribed accuracy. Finally, we
show how our approach can be extended to a multi-fidelity framework, where we
allow the underlying constitutive model to be chosen from either a
phenomenological plasticity model or a dislocation-density-based model.

<h3>Reduced-order approach for soft material inertial cavitation rheometry</h3>

An understanding of inertial cavitation is crucial for biological and
engineering applications such as non-invasive tissue surgeries and the
mitigation of potential blast injuries. However, predictive modeling of
inertial cavitation in biological tissues is hindered by the difficulties of
characterizing fluids and soft materials at high strain rates, and the
computational cost of calibrating biologically-relevant viscoelastic models. By
incorporating a reduced-order model of inertial cavitation in the inertial
microcavitation rheometry (IMR) experimental technique, we present an efficient
procedure to inversely characterize viscoelastic material subjected to inertial
cavitation. Instead of brute-force iteration of constitutive model parameters,
the present approach directly estimates the elastic and viscous moduli
according to the size-dependent scaling of bubble dynamics. Through
reproduction of numerical-simulated inertial cavitation kinematics and
experimental characterization of benchmark materials, we demonstrate that the
proposed framework can determine the complex rate-dependent properties of soft
solid with a small number of numerical simulations. The availability of this
procedure will broaden the applicability of IMR for localized characterization
of fluids and soft biological materials at high strain rates.

Correct prediction of the behavior of UO2 crystal, which is an
antiferromagnet system with strongly-correlated electrons, is possible by using
a modified density functional theory, the DFT+U method. In the context of
DFT+U, the energy of crystal turns out to be a function with several local
minima, the so-called meta-stable states, and the lowest energy state amongst
them is identified as the ground state. OMC was a method that were used in
DFT+U to determine the ground state. Recently the SMC method was proposed which
also revealed the multi-minima structure of energy in the DFT+U approach and
led to results in good agreement with experiment. In this work, we compare the
SMC and OMC results and show that although the ground states of the two methods
have similar energies and geometries, the electronic structures have
significant differences. Moreover, the energy band gap of SMC is in better
agreement with experiments.

We report the experimental observation of dielectric relaxation by quantum
critical magnons. Complex capacitance measurements reveal a dissipative feature
with a temperature-dependent amplitude due to low-energy lattice excitations
and an activation behavior of the relaxation time. The activation energy
softens close to a field-tuned magnetic quantum critical point at $H=H_c$ and
follows single-magnon energy for $H>H_c$, showing its magnetic origin. Our
study demonstrates the electrical activity of coupled low-energy spin and
lattice excitations, an example of quantum multiferroic behavior.

<h3>Quantum sensing of magnetic fields with molecular color centers</h3>

Molecular color centers, such as $S=1$ Cr($o$-tolyl)$_{4}$, show promise as
an adaptable platform for magnetic quantum sensing. Their intrinsically small
size, i.e., 1-2 nm, enables them to sense fields at short distances and in
various geometries. This feature, in conjunction with tunable optical read-out
of spin information, offers the potential for molecular color centers to be a
paradigm shifting materials class beyond diamond-NV centers by accessing a
distance scale opaque to NVs. This capability could, for example, address
ambiguity in the reported magnetic fields arising from two-dimensional magnets
by allowing for a single sensing technique to be used over a wider range of
distances. Yet, so far, these abilities have only been hypothesized with
theoretical validation absent. We show through simulation that
Cr($o$-tolyl)$_{4}$ can spatially resolve proximity-exchange versus direct
magnetic field effects from monolayer CrI$_{3}$ by quantifying how these
interactions impact the excited states of the molecule. At short distances,
proximity exchange dominates through molecule-substrate interactions, but at
further distances the molecule behaves as a typical magnetic sensor, with
magnetostatic effects dominating changes to the energy of the excited state.
Our models effectively demonstrate how a molecular color center could be used
to measure the magnetic field of a 2D magnet and the role different
distance-dependent interactions contribute to the measured field.

<h3>Spontaneous momentum polarization and diodicity in Bernal bilayer  graphene</h3>

Driven by the exchange interaction, charge carriers in Bernal-stacked bilayer
graphene are expected to undergo a spontaneous condensation in the momentum
space. Such instability in the momentum space offers a key ingredient for
understanding spontaneously broken symmetries and isospin-ordered phases in
bilayer graphene. In this work, we report direct identification of spontaneous
momentum polarization, which gives rise to reduced rotational symmetry and
broken time-reversal symmetry throughout the phase space of BLG. Using
angle-resolved nonlinear transport measurement, we identify a cascade of
transitions arising from momentum space instability, which points towards an
intriguing interplay between momentum polarization and isospin-ordered phases.
We show that such interplay offers key constraints for better understanding the
nature of other emergent phenomena, such as superconductivity.

Coherent tunneling processes of multiple Cooper pairs across a Josephson
junction give rise to higher harmonics in the current phase relation. In this
work, we propose and study Josephson junctions based on
semiconductor-superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator heterostructures to
engineer nonsinusoidal current-phase relations. The gate-tunability of charge
carriers density in the semiconductor, together with the adjustable
magnetization of the ferromagnetic insulator, provides control over the content
of the supercurrent harmonics. At finite exchange field, hybrid junctions can
undergo a 0\,--\,$\pi$ phase transition, resulting in the supercurrent
reversal. Close to the transition, single-pair tunneling is suppressed and the
current-phase relation is dominated by the second-harmonic, indicating
transport primarily by pairs of Cooper pairs. Finally, we demonstrate that
non-collinear magnetization or spin-orbit coupling in the leads and the
junction can lead to a gate-tunable Josephson diode effect with efficiencies of
up to $\sim30\%$.
