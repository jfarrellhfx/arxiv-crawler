<h3>Bound-state confinement after trap-expansion dynamics in integrable  systems</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17623" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17623</a>
<br>
</p><i>Leonardo Biagetti, Vincenzo Alba</i>
<p>Integrable systems possess stable families of quasiparticles, which are
composite objects (bound states) of elementary excitations. Motivated by recent
quantum computer experiments, we investigate bound-state transport in the
spin-$1/2$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain ($XXZ$ chain). Specifically, we
consider the sudden vacuum expansion of a finite region $A$ prepared in a
non-equilibrium state. In the hydrodynamic regime, if interactions are strong
enough, bound states remain confined in the initial region. Bound-state
confinement persists until the density of unbound excitations remains finite in
the bulk of $A$. Since region $A$ is finite, at asymptotically long times bound
states are "liberated" after the "evaporation" of all the unbound excitations.
Fingerprints of confinement are visible in the space-time profiles of local
spin-projection operators. To be specific, here we focus on the expansion of
the $p$-N\'eel states, which are obtained by repetition of a unit cell with $p$
up spins followed by $p$ down spins. Upon increasing $p$, the bound-state
content is enhanced. In the limit $p\to\infty$ one obtains the domain-wall
initial state. We show that for $p<4$, only bound states with $n>p$ are
confined at large chain anisotropy. For $p\gtrsim 4$, also bound states with
$n=p$ are confined, consistent with the absence of transport in the limit
$p\to\infty$. The scenario of bound-state confinement leads to a hierarchy of
timescales at which bound states of different sizes are liberated, which is
also reflected in the dynamics of the von Neumann entropy.

<h3>Local heat current flow in the ballistic phonon transport of graphene  nanoribbons</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17639" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17639</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yin-jie Chen, Jing-tao Lü</i>
<p>Utilizing nonequilibrium Green's function method, we study the phonon local
heat current flow in nanoscale graphene nanoribbons. Ballistic transport and
boundary scattering lead to formation of atomic scale current vortices. Using
the B\"uttiker probe approach, we further map out the temperature distribution
in the junction. From the heat current and temperature distribution, we observe
negative local resistance of the junctions, where heat current direction goes
from colder to hotter regime. Moreover, we show that atomic scale defect can
generate heat vortex at certain frequency, but it is averaged out when
including contributions from all the phonon modes. These results extend the
study of local heat vortex and negative temperature response in bulk
hydrodynamic regime to atomic-scale ballistic regime, further confirming
boundary scattering is crucial to generate backflow of heat current.

<h3>Expansion dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates in a synthetic magnetic  field</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17691" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17691</a>
<br>
</p><i>Juan Wang, Hongguang Liang, Yan Li, Chuan-Hsun Li, Chunlei Qu</i>
<p>We investigate the expansion dynamics of spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein
condensates subjected to a synthetic magnetic field, after their release from
an external harmonic trap. Our findings reveal that the condensate experiences
a spin-dependent rotation and separation due to the rigid-like rotational
velocity field, which leads to a spin density deflection. The deflection angle
reaches a peak at a time that is inversely related to the frequency of the
harmonic trap. When the detuning gradient is below a critical value for vortex
nucleation, our analytical results derived from a spinor hydrodynamic theory
align closely with numerical results using the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii
equations. Beyond this critical value, we also numerically simulated the
expansion dynamics of the condensates containing vortices with negative
circulation. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of the rigid-like
rotational velocity field on the dynamics of the condensate and may stimulate
further experimental investigations into the rich superfluid dynamics induced
by synthetic magnetic fields.

<h3>Negative magnetoresistance induced by longitudinal photons in Dirac/Weyl  semimetals</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16859" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16859</a>
<br>
</p><i>J. L. Acosta Avalo, H. Pérez Rojas</i>
<p>A low-energy model is built to study systems such as Dirac/Weyl semimetals,
according to statistical quantum electrodynamics formalism. We report that the
introduction of a pseudoscalar, associated to longitudinal photons propagating
along a magnetic field B, could transforms a Dirac semimetal into a Weyl
semimetal with a pair of Weyl nodes for each point of Dirac. The nodes are
separated by a pseudovector electric field induced dynamically along B
associated to a chiral effect on the Fermi surface. A topological quantum
transition is produced between a chiral-and non chiral symmetry phase. A
general expression to the longitudinal magnetoconductivity is found. It
provides the possibility of generalizing the usual expressions of the
magnetoconductivity reported in the literature. This has a quadratic dependence
on B, which is associated with a positive contribution to the
magnetoconductivity. This is a prominent signature of the chiral magnetic
effect in Dirac/Weyl systems in parallel electric and magnetic fields. We
report a chiral effect induced by longitudinal photons associated to a negative
longitudinal magnetoresistance in Dirac systems via an axial anomaly relation.
We show some numerical results, and reproduced with a high level of accuracy
some of the experimental results, in the low temperature region, obtained to
the magnetoresistance of ZrTe5 and Na3Bi. We believe that a wide variety of
these semimetals can be studied by using our general expression to the negative
longitudinal magnetoresistance.

</p><i>P. Hernández-Gómez, D. Martín-González, C. Torres, J. M. Muñoz</i>
<p>Single phase multiferroics in which ordered magnetic and ferroelectricity
coexist, are of great interest for new multifunctional devices, and among them
Y-type hexaferrites are good candidates. Transverse susceptibility
measurements, which have been proved to be a versatile tool to study singular
properties of bulk and nanoparticle magnetic systems, have been carried out
with a broadband system on polycrystalline Y type hexaferrites with composition
Ba0.5Sr1.5Co2Fe2O22, optimal to exhibit multiferroic properties. In the
temperature range 80-350 K transverse susceptibility measurements with DC
fields up to +-5000 Oe reveal different behaviour depending on the sintering
temperature. The thermal evolution of the anisotropy field peak exhibit four
regions with different slopes: positive in 80-130 K, negative in 130-200 K,
constant in 200-280 K and negative in 280-350 K, which can be considered a
signature of spin transitions in this compound.

<h3>Exact Calculations of Coherent Information for Toric Codes under  Decoherence: Identifying the Fundamental Error Threshold</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16937" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16937</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jong Yeon Lee</i>
<p>The toric code is a canonical example of a topological error-correcting code.
Two logical qubits stored within the toric code are robust against local
decoherence, ensuring that these qubits can be faithfully retrieved as long as
the error rate remains below a certain threshold. Recent studies have explored
such a threshold behavior as an intrinsic information-theoretic transition,
independent of the decoding protocol. These studies have shown that
information-theoretic metrics, calculated using the Renyi (replica)
approximation, demonstrate sharp transitions at a specific error rate. However,
an exact analytic expression that avoids using the replica trick has not been
shown, and the connection between the transition in information-theoretic
capacity and the random bond Ising model (RBIM) has only been indirectly
established. In this work, we present the first analytic expression for the
coherent information of a decohered toric code, thereby establishing a rigorous
connection between the fundamental error threshold and the criticality of the
RBIM.

<h3>Orbital selective order and $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Potts nematicity from a  non-Fermi liquid</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16952" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16952</a>
<br>
</p><i>YuZheng Xie, Andrew Hardy, Arun Paramekanti</i>
<p>Motivated by systems where a high temperature non-Fermi liquid gives way to
low temperature $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Potts nematic order, we studied a three-orbital
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model in the large-$N$ limit. In the single-site limit,
this model exhibits a spontaneous orbital-selective transition which preserves
average particle-hole symmetry, with two orbitals becoming insulators while the
third orbital remains a non-Fermi liquid down to zero temperature. We extend
this study to lattice models of three-orbital SYK dots, exploring uniform
symmetry broken states on the triangular and cubic lattices. At high
temperature, these lattice models exhibit an isotropic non-Fermi liquid metal
phase. On the three-dimensional (3D) cubic lattice, the low temperature uniform
$\mathbb{Z}_3$ nematic state corresponds to an orbital selective layered state
which preserves particle-hole symmetry at small hopping and spontaneously
breaks the particle-hole symmetry at large hopping. Over a wide range of
temperature, the transport in this layered state shows metallic in-plane
resistivity but insulating out-of-plane resistivity. On the 2D triangular
lattice, the low temperature state with uniform orbital order is also a
correlated $\mathbb{Z}_3$ nematic with orbital-selective transport but it
remains metallic in both principal directions. We discuss a Landau theory with
$\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock terms which captures salient features of the phase diagram
and nematic order in all these models. We also present results on the
approximate wavevector dependent orbital susceptibility of the isotropic
non-Fermi liquid states.

<h3>Thermal evolution of spin excitations in honeycomb Ising  antiferromagnetic FePSe3</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Lebing Chen, Xiaokun Teng, Ding Hu, Feng Ye, Garrett E. Granroth, Ming Yi, Jae-Ho Chung, Robert J. Birgeneau, Pengcheng Dai</i>
<p>We use elastic and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) to study the
antiferromagnetic (AF) phase transitions and spin excitations in the
two-dimensional (2D) zig-zag antiferromagnet FePSe$_3$. By determining the
magnetic order parameter across the AF phase transition, we conclude that the
AF phase transition in FePSe$_3$ is first-order in nature. In addition, our INS
measurements reveal that the spin waves in the AF ordered state have a large
easy-axis magnetic anisotropy gap, consistent with an Ising Hamiltonian, and
possible biquadratic magnetic exchange interactions. On warming across $T_N$,
we find that dispersive spin excitations associated with three-fold rotational
symmetric AF fluctuations change into FM spin fluctuations above $T_N$. These
results suggest that the first-order AF phase transition in FePSe$_3$ may arise
from the competition between $C_3$ symmetric AF and $C_1$ symmetric FM spin
fluctuations around $T_N$, in place of a conventional second-order AF phase
transition.

<h3>Thermodynamic Overfitting and Generalization: Energetic Limits on  Predictive Complexity</h3>

<p>Efficiently harvesting thermodynamic resources requires a precise
understanding of their structure. This becomes explicit through the lens of
information engines -- thermodynamic engines that use information as fuel.
Maximizing the work harvested using available information is a form of
physically-instantiated machine learning that drives information engines to
develop complex predictive memory to store an environment's temporal
correlations. We show that an information engine's complex predictive memory
poses both energetic benefits and risks. While increasing memory facilitates
detection of hidden patterns in an environment, it also opens the possibility
of thermodynamic overfitting, where the engine dissipates additional energy in
testing. To address overfitting, we introduce thermodynamic regularizers that
incur a cost to engine complexity in training due to the physical constraints
on the information engine. We demonstrate that regularized thermodynamic
machine learning generalizes effectively. In particular, the physical
constraints from which regularizers are derived improve the performance of
learned predictive models. This suggests that the laws of physics jointly
create the conditions for emergent complexity and predictive intelligence.

<h3>Giant quantum oscillations in thermal transport in low-density metals  via electron absorption of phonons</h3>

<p>Oscillations of conductance observed in strong magnetic fields are a striking
manifestation of the quantum dynamics of charge carriers in solids. The large
charge carrier density in typical metals sets the scale of oscillations in both
electrical and thermal conductivity, which characterize the Fermi surface. In
semimetals, thermal transport at low-charge carrier density is expected to be
phonon dominated, yet several experiments observe giant quantum oscillations in
thermal transport. This raises the question of whether there is an overarching
mechanism leading to sizable oscillations that survives in phonon-dominated
semimetals. In this work, we show that such a mechanism exists. It relies on
the peculiar phase-space allowed for phonon scattering by electrons when only a
few Landau levels are filled. Our measurements on the Dirac semimetal ZrTe5
support this counter-intuitive mechanism through observation of pronounced
thermal quantum oscillations, since they occur in similar magnitude and phase
in directions parallel and transverse to the magnetic field. Our phase-space
argument applies to all low-density semimetals, topological or not, including
graphene and bismuth. Our work illustrates that phonon absorption can be
leveraged to reveal degrees of freedom through their imprint on longitudinal
thermal transport.

<h3>Mechanics and wrinkling patterns of pressurized bent tubes</h3>

<p>Take a drinking straw and bend it from its ends. After sufficient bending,
the tube buckles forming a kink, where the curvature is localized in a very
small area. This instability, known generally as the Brazier effect, is
inherent to thin-walled cylindrical shells, which are particularly ubiquitous
in living systems, such as rod-shaped bacteria. However, tubular biological
structures are often pressurized, and the knowledge of the mechanical response
upon bending in this scenario is limited. In this work, we use a computational
model to study the mechanical response and the deformations as a result of
bending pressurized tubes. In addition, we employ tension-field theory to
describe the mechanical behaviour before and after the wrinkling transition.
Furthermore, we investigate the development and evolution of wrinkle patterns
beyond the instability, showing different wrinkled configurations. We discover
the existence of a multi-wavelength mode following the purely sinusoidal
wrinkles and anticipating the kinked configuration of the tube.

<p>The control of antiferromagnets with ultrashort optical pulses has emerged as
a prominent field of research. Tailored laser excitation can launch coherent
spin waves at terahertz frequencies, yet a comprehensive description of their
generation mechanisms is still lacking despite extensive efforts. Using
terahertz emission spectroscopy, we investigate the generation of a coherent
magnon mode in the van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$ under a range of
photoexcitation conditions. By tuning the pump photon energy from transparency
to resonant with a $d$-$d$ transition, we reveal a striking change in the
coherent magnon's dependence on the pump polarization, indicating two distinct
excitation mechanisms. Our findings provide a strategy for the manipulation of
magnetic modes via photoexcitation around sub-gap electronic states.

<h3>Disorder-induced local strain distribution in Y-substituted TmVO4</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17049" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17049</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yuntian Li, Mark P. Zic, Linda Ye, W. Joe Meese, Pierre Massat, Yanbing Zhu, Rafael M. Fernandes, Ian R. Fisher</i>
<p>We report an investigation of the effect of substitution of Y for Tm in
$Tm_{1-x}Y_xVO4$ via low-temperature heat capacity measurements, with the
yttrium content $x$ varying from $0$ to $0.997$. Because the Tm ions support a
local quadrupolar (nematic) moment, they act as reporters of the local strain
state in the material, with the splitting of the ion's non-Kramers crystal
field groundstate proportional to the quadrature sum of the in-plane tetragonal
symmetry-breaking transverse and longitudinal strains experienced by each ion
individually. Analysis of the heat capacity therefore provides detailed
insights into the distribution of local strains that arise as a consequence of
the chemical substitution. These local strains suppress long-range quadrupole
order for $x>0.22$, and result in a broad Schottky-like feature for higher
concentrations. Heat capacity data are compared to expectations for a
distribution of uncorrelated (random) strains. For dilute Tm concentrations,
the heat capacity cannot be accounted for by randomly distributed strains,
demonstrating the presence of significant strain correlations between sites.
For intermediate Tm concentrations, these correlations must still exist, but
the data cannot be distinguished from that which would be obtained from a 2D
Gaussian distribution. The cross-over between these limits is discussed in
terms of the interplay of key length scales in the substituted material. The
central result of this work, that local strains arising from chemical
substitution are not uncorrelated, has implications for the range of validity
of theoretical models based on random effective fields that are used to
describe such chemically substituted materials, particularly when electronic
nematic correlations are present.

<p>The propagation of electromagnetic waves in unmagnetized periodic plasma

</p><i>James Maldaner, Mitja Fridman, Saurya Das, Gil Porat</i>
<p>We present an analysis of the sensitivity limits of a proposed experimental
search for quantum gravity, using a novel approach based on optical
magnetometry in the noble gas isotope $^{129}$Xe. The analysis relies on a
general uncertainty principle model that is consistent with most formulations
of quantum gravity theory, where the canonical uncertainty relations are
modified by a leading-order correction term that is linear in momentum. In
turn, this correction modifies the magnetic moment of the spin-polarized
$^{129}$Xe atoms that are immersed in a magnetic field in the proposed
experiment, which results in a velocity-dependent variation of their Larmour
frequency, that is detected via two-photon laser spectroscopy. The thermal
distribution of atomic velocities, in conjunction with the Doppler effect, is
used to scan the interrogating laser over different atomic velocities, and
search for a corresponding variation in their Larmor frequencies. We show that
the existing bounds on the leading-order quantum gravity correction can be
improved by $10^{7}$ with existing technology, where another factor of $10^{2}$
is possible with near-future technical capabilities.

<h3>Charge-State Stabilization of Neutral Group-IV Impurity-Vacancy Color  Centers in Hydrogen-Terminated Diamond</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17083" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17083</a>
<br>
</p><i>Rodrick Kuate Defo, Steven L. Richardson</i>
<p>Charge-state stabilization of the neutral group-IV impurity-vacancy color
centers in diamond has thus far proved difficult to achieve reliably. The
neutral group-IV color centers, however, provide a robust alternative to the
NV$^-$ center in diamond given their inversion symmetry which renders them less
susceptible to spectral diffusion. In this work, we show that the ratio for the
occurrences of SiV$^0$ in hydrogen-terminated and oxygen-terminated diamond
[see Zi-Huai Zhang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 166902 (2023)] can be
accurately estimated from knowledge of the surface levels for the two
terminations and we propose adsorption of halogens on diamond to further
enhance the occurrence of SiV$^0$. We leverage the notion presented in our
earlier work [see Rodrick Kuate Defo et al. Phys. Rev. B 108, 235208 (2023)]
that surface defects can modulate the donor levels of near-surface point
defects to determine the influence of surface termination on the production of
Si$V^0$, and we additionally further elaborate our earlier work's
carrier-capture formalism.

<h3>Renormalization Group flow, Optimal Transport and Diffusion-based  Generative Model</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Artan Sheshmani, Yi-Zhuang You, Baturalp Buyukates, Amir Ziashahabi, Salman Avestimehr</i>
<p>Diffusion-based generative models represent a forefront direction in
generative AI research today. Recent studies in physics have suggested that the
renormalization group (RG) can be conceptualized as a diffusion process. This
insight motivates us to develop a novel diffusion-based generative model by
reversing the momentum-space RG flow. We establish a framework that interprets
RG flow as optimal transport gradient flow, which minimizes a functional
analogous to the Kullback-Leibler divergence, thereby bridging statistical
physics and information theory. Our model applies forward and reverse diffusion
processes in Fourier space, exploiting the sparse representation of natural
images in this domain to efficiently separate signal from noise and manage
image features across scales. By introducing a scale-dependent noise schedule
informed by a dispersion relation, the model optimizes denoising performance
and image generation in Fourier space, taking advantage of the distinct
separation of macro and microscale features. Experimental validations on
standard datasets demonstrate the model's capability to generate high-quality
images while significantly reducing training time compared to existing
image-domain diffusion models. This approach not only enhances our
understanding of the generative processes in images but also opens new pathways
for research in generative AI, leveraging the convergence of theoretical
physics, optimal transport, and machine learning principles.

<h3>Improved understanding of the growth of blocky alpha in welded  Zircaloy-4</h3>

</p><i>Ruth M. Birch, T. Ben Britton</i>
<p>Zirconium alloys are widely used in nuclear reactors as fuel cladding
materials. Fuel cladding is used to contain the nuclear fuel and cladding tubes
are typically sealed using welds. Welding of zirconium alloys can result in
changes in the local microstructure, with the potential to grow so called
'blocky {\alpha}' grains in the welded region during subsequent thermal
processing and these blocky {\alpha} grains have the potential to be
detrimental to the integrity of the component. In this work, complimentary
heating experiments with ex situ and in situ electron backscatter diffraction
(EBSD) analysis are used to aid understanding of the blocky {\alpha} grain
growth within the weld region. These experiments reveal that blocky {\alpha}
grain growth is related to the parent \b{eta} (high temperature)
microstructure, as grains grow adjacent to a prior \b{eta} grain boundary and
the orientation of the growing {\alpha} grain can be explained using
neighbourhood orientations from this prior \b{eta} grain. This growth mechanism
is explained via a simple mechanism which is related to the {\alpha} grain
orientations, grain boundary structures and local stored energy. Ultimately,
our findings indicate that the likely grain growth (size and morphology) across
the weld region can now be predicted from the initial as-welded microstructure.

<p>The equation of state for an ideal gas is simple, which is $P=nk_{\rm B}T$.
In the case of imperfect gases where mutual interactions among the constituents
are important, pressure $P$ can be expressed as the series expansion of density
$n$ with appropriate coefficients, known as virial coefficients $B_m$. In this
paper, we have obtained the first four virial coefficients for a model
interaction potential $\Phi(r)$ using multidimensional Monte-Carlo integration
and importance sampling methods. Next, we perform molecular dynamics
simulations with the same $\Phi(r)$ for a many-particle system to obtain $P$ as
a function of $T$ and $n$. We compare our numerical data with the virial
equation of state.

<p>We present a theoretical study of the directionality effects in spontaneous
emission and resonance fluorescence of a quantum two-level dipole emitter near
an ultrathin closely packed periodically aligned single-wall carbon nanotube
film. Such films present an example of highly anisotropic flexible metasurfaces
that are now available experimentally. The nanotube alignment is shown to
provide an extra measure for quantum control of dipolar spontaneous emission
and resonance fluorescence in such systems, in addition to film thickness and
composition parameters such as tube diameter, chirality and translational
period. The processes studied are shown to be highly anisotropic, being
enhanced by orders of magnitude in the direction perpendicular to the alignment
and metasurface plane, contrasting with the commonly believed viewpoint of
their uncontrollably random directionality.

<p>In materials science, a wide range of properties of materials are governed by
various types of energies, including thermal, physicochemical, structural, and
mechanical energies. In 2005, Dr. Frans Spaepen used crystalline
face-centered-cubic (fcc) copper as an example to discuss a variety of
phenomena that are associated with energies. Inspired by his pioneering work,
we broaden our analysis to include a selection of representative pure metals
with fcc, hexagonal close-packed (hcp), and body-centered cubic (bcc)
structures. Additionally, we extend our comparison to energies between pure
metals and equiatomic binary, ternary, and multi-principal element alloys
(sometimes also known as high-entropy alloys). Through an extensive collection
of data and calculations, we compile energy tables that provide a comprehensive
view of how structure and alloying influence the energy profiles of these
metals and alloys. We highlight the significant impact of constituent elements
on the energies of alloys compared to pure metals and reveal a notable
disparity in mechanical energies among materials in fcc-, hcp- and
bcc-structured metals and alloys. Furthermore, we discuss the underlying
mechanisms behind these patterns and discuss the implications for structural
transformations, providing insights into the broader context of these energy
variations.

</p><i>Juan Han, Yiwei Sun, Xiamin Huang, Wenjun Shuai, Guangyou Fang, Zhou Li</i>
<p>We have investigated both inter-band and intra-band second order nonlinear
optical conductivity based on the velocity correlation formalism and the
spectral expansion technique. We propose a scenario in which the second order
intra-band process is nonzero while the inter-band process is zero. This occurs
for a band structure with momentum asymmetry in the Brillouin zone. Very
low-energy photons are blocked by the Pauli exclusion principle from
participating in the inter-band process; however, they are permitted to
participate in the intra-band process, with the band smeared by some impurity
scattering. We establish a connection between the inter-band nonlinear optical
conductivity in the velocity gauge and the shift vector in the length gauge for
a two-band model. Using a quasiclassical kinetic approach, we demonstrate the
importance of intra-band transitions in high harmonic generations for the
single tilted Dirac cone model and hexagonal warping model. We confirm that the
Kramers-Kronig relations break down for the limit case of ($\omega$, $-\omega$)
in the nonlinear optical conductivity. Finally, we calculate the
superconducting transition temperature of NbN and the dielectric function of
AlN, and the resistance of the NbN/AlN junction. The natural non-linearity of
the Josephson junction brings a Josephson plasma with frequency in the
Terahertz region.

<p>Large-scale computer simulations of chemical atoms are used in a wide range
of applications, including batteries, drugs, and more. However, there is a
problem with efficiency as it takes a long time due to the large amount of
calculation. To solve these problems, machine learning interatomic potential
(ML-IAP) technology is attracting attention as an alternative. ML-IAP not only
has high accuracy by faithfully expressing the density functional theory (DFT),
but also has the advantage of low computational cost. However, there is a
problem that the potential energy changes significantly depending on the
environment of each atom, and expansion to a wide range of compounds within a
single model is still difficult to build in the case of a kernel-based model.
To solve this problem, we would like to develop a universal ML-IAP using this
active Bayesian Committee Machine (BCM) potential methodology for
carbon-nitrogen-hydrogen (CNH) with various compositions. ML models are trained
and generated through first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics
simulations for molecules with only CNH. Using long amine structures to test an
ML model trained only with short chains, the results show excellent consistency
with DFT calculations. Consequently, machine learning-based models for organic
molecules not only demonstrate the ability to accurately describe various
physical properties but also hold promise for investigating a broad spectrum of
diverse materials systems.

<h3>Layer Coherence Origin of Intrinsic Planar Hall Effect in 2D Limit</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Huiyuan Zheng, Dawei Zhai, Cong Xiao, Wang Yao</i>
<p>The intrinsic planar Hall effect has attracted intensive interest inspired by
recent experiments. Existing theories of this effect require three dimensional
orbital motion, or strong spin-orbit coupling of certain forms, which do not
exist in van der Waals thin films. Here, we uncover a new origin of the planar
Hall effect - as an intrinsic property of layer coherent electrons - that
allows its presence even in bilayer and trilayer atomically thin limit. As
examples, we show that the effect can be triggered by strain and interlayer
sliding respectively in twisted bilayer graphene and trilayer transition metal
dichalcogenides, where the effect features rich tunability and even stronger
magnitude than those induced by topological nodal structures in bulk materials.
The layer mechanism also provides a new route towards quantized Hall response
upon a topological phase transition induced by in-plane magnetic field. These
results unveil the unexplored potential of quantum layertronics and moir\'e
flat band for planar Hall transport.

<p>Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) produced by means of bottom-up chemical
self-assembly are considered promising candidates for the next-generation
nanoelectronic devices. We address the electronic transport properties of
angled two-terminal GNR junctions, which are inevitable in the interconnects in
graphene-based integrated circuits. We construct a library of over 400000
distinct configurations of 60$^\circ$ and 120$^\circ$ junctions connecting
armchair GNRs of different widths. Numerical calculations combining the
tight-binding approximation and the Green's function formalism allow
identifying numerous junctions with conductance close to the limit defined by
the GNR leads. Further analysis reveals underlying structure-property
relationships with crucial roles played by the bipartite symmetry of graphene
lattice and the presence of resonant states localized at the junction. In
particular, we discover and explain the phenomenon of binary conductance in
120$^\circ$ junctions connecting metallic GNR leads that guarantees maximum
possible conductance. Overall, our study defines the guidelines for engineering
GNR junctions with desired electrical properties.

<p>We systematically study the acousto-current of two-dimensional electron
systems in the integer and fractional quantum Hall regimes using surface
acoustic waves. We are able to separate the co-existing acoustic scattering and
drag, when phonons induce drag current and tune the electron conductivity,
respectively. At large acoustic power, the drag current is finite when the
system is compressible and exhibits minima when incompressible quantum Hall
effects appear. Surprisingly, it exhibits anomalously large bipolar spikes
within the quantum Hall plateaus while it vanishes linearly with reduced
acoustic power at compressible phases. The current peaks reverse their polarity
at the two flanks of exact integer or fractional fillings, consistent with the
opposite electric charge of the quasiparticle/quasihole.

<h3>A computational method for angle-resolved photoemission spectra from  repeated-slab band structure calculations</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17199" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17199</a>
<br>
</p><i>Misa Nozaki, Peter Krüger</i>
<p>A versatile method for angle-resolved photoemission spectra (ARPES)
calculations is reported within the one-step model of photoemission. The
initial states are obtained from a repeated-slab calculation using the
projector-augmented wave (PAW) method. ARPES final states are constructed by
matching the repeated-slab eigenstates of positive energy with free electron
states that satisfy the time-reversed low-energy electron diffraction boundary
conditions. Nonphysical solutions of the matching equations, which do not
respect the flux conservation, are discarded. The method is applied to
surface-normal photoemission from graphene as a function of photon energy from
threshold up to 100 eV. The results are compared with independently performed
multiple scattering calculations and very good agreement is obtained, provided
that the photoemission matrix elements are computed with all-electron waves
reconstructed from the PAW pseudo-waves. However, if the pseudo-waves are used
directly, the relative intensity between $\sigma$- and $\pi$-band emission is
wrong by an order of magnitude. The graphene ARPES intensity has a strong
photon energy dependence including resonances. The normal emission spectrum
from the $\pi$-band shows a hitherto unreported, sharp resonance at a photon
energy of 31 eV. The resonance is due to a 2$D$ interband transitions and
highlights the importance of matrix element effects beyond the final state
plane-wave approximation.

<h3>Corner entanglement of a resonating valence bond wavefunction</h3>

</p><i>Giacomo Torlai, Roger G. Melko</i>
<p>We perform a quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the resonating valence bond
wavefunction on a two-dimensional square lattice with periodic boundary
conditions. Using two replicas of the system, we calculate the second Renyi
entropy on a spatial bipartition with a square geometry. Through a finite-size
scaling analysis, we extract the logarithmic correction to the area law due to
the presence of the sharp corners in the entangling surface. We find that the
coefficient of this logarithm is positive with a value of 0.073 for a single
$90^{\circ}$ corner.

</p><i>Azim Fitri Zainul Abidin, Ikutaro Hamada</i>
<p>We present a density functional theory study of the oxygen reduction reaction
(ORR) on a single atom catalyst embedded in graphene, namely, TM-N$_{4}$-C (TM
= Fe and Co), using the effective screening medium method combined with the
reference interaction site model (ESM-RISM). It was found that Fe-N$_{4}$-C and
Co-N$_{4}$-C show comparable ORR activities from the constant electrode
potential simulations, in contrast to the results obtained using the constant
(neutral) charge simulation, in which the superior performance of Co-N$_{4}$-C
has been predicted. The constant potential method allows the variable charge
and thus results in a potential dependence of the reaction-free energies
different from that with the constant charge method in which the potential
dependence is included as an ad hoc manner. We suggest the importance of the
variable charge in the simulation of the electrochemical reaction, which is
enabled by ESM-RISM.

<h3>Mobility edges in non-Hermitian models with slowly varying  quasi-periodic disorders</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Qiyun Tang, Yan He</i>
<p>We investigate the appearance of mobility edges in a one-dimensional
non-Hermitian tight-banding model with alternating hopping constants and slowly
varying quasi-periodic on-site potentials. Due to the presence of slowly
varying exponent, the parity-time (PT) symmetry of this model is broken and its
spectra is complex. It is found that the spectrum of this model can be divided
into three different types of patterns depending on the magnitude of the
quasi-periodic potential. As the amplitude of the potential increases from
small to large, the initially well defined mobility edges become blurred
gradually and then eventually disappear for large enough potential. This
behavior of the mobility edges is also confirmed by a detailed study of the
winding number of the complex spectra of this non-Hermitian model.

<h3>Myelin figures from microbial glycolipid biosurfactant amphiphiles</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Debdyuti Roy, Vincent Chaleix, Atul N. Parikh, Niki Baccile</i>
<p>Myelin figures (MFs) -- cylindrical lyotropic liquid crystalline structures
consisting of concentric arrays of bilayers and aqueous media -- arise from the
hydration of the bulk lamellar phase of many common amphiphiles. Prior efforts
have concentrated on the formation, structure, and dynamics of myelin produced
by phosphatidylcholine (PC)-based amphiphiles. Here, we study the myelinization
of glycolipid microbial amphiphiles, commonly addressed as biosurfactants,
produced through the process of fermentation. The hydration characteristics
(and phase diagrams) of these biological amphiphiles are atypical (and thus
their capacity to form myelin) because unlike typical amphiphiles, their
molecular structure is characterized by two hydrophilic groups (sugar,
carboxylic acid) on both ends with a hydrophobic moiety in the middle. We
tested three different glycolipid molecules: C18:1 sophorolipids and
single-glucose C18:1 and C18:0 glucolipids, all in their nonacetylated acidic
form. Neither sophorolipids (too soluble) nor C18:0 glucolipids (too insoluble)
displayed myelin growth at room temperature (RT, 25 C). The glucolipid C18:1
(G-C18:1), on the other hand, showed dense myelin growth at RT below pH 7.0.
Examining their growth rates, we find that they display a linear L $\alpha$ t
(L, myelin length; t, time) growth rate, suggesting ballistic growth,
distinctly different from the L $\alpha$ t^(1/2) dependence, characterizing
diffusive growth such as what occurs in more conventional phospholipids. These
results offer some insight into lipidic mesophases arising from a previously
unexplored class of amphiphiles with potential applications in the field of
drug delivery.

<h3>Eigenstate switching of topologically ordered states using non-Hermitian  perturbations</h3>

</p><i>Cheol Hun Yeom, Beom Hyun Kim, Moon Jip Park</i>
<p>Topologically ordered phases have robust degenerate ground states against the
local perturbations, providing a promising platform for fault-tolerant quantum
computation. Despite of the non-local feature of the topological order, we find
that local non-Hermitian perturbations can induce the transition between the
topologically ordered ground states. In this work, we study the toric code in
the presence of non-Hermitian perturbations. By controlling the
non-Hermiticity, we show that non-orthogonal ground states can exhibit an
eigenstate coalescence and have the spectral singularity, known as an
exceptional point (EP). We explore the potential of the EPs in the control of
topological order. Adiabatic encircling EPs allows for the controlled switching
of eigenstates, enabling dynamic manipulation between the ground state
degeneracy. Interestingly, we show a property of our scheme that arbitrary
strengths of local perturbations can induce the EP and eigenstate switching.
Finally, we also show the orientation-dependent behavior of non-adiabatic
transitions (NAT) during the dynamic encirclement around an EP. Our work shows
that control of the non-Hermiticity can serve as a promising strategy for
fault-tolerant quantum information processing.

</p><i>Jianhao Sun, Tao Ying, Richard T. Scalettar, Rubem Mondaini</i>
<p>The interplay of spin and motional degrees of freedom forms a key element in
explaining stripe formation accompanied by sublattice reversal of local
antiferromagnetic ordering in interacting fermionic models. A long-standing
question aims to relate pairing to stripe formation, intending to discern the
applicability of simple models that observe this phenomenon in understanding
cuprate physics. By departing from fermionic statistics, we show that the
formation of stripes is rather generic, allowing one to unveil its competition
with superfluid behavior. To that end, we use a combination of numerical
methods to solve a model of interacting hardcore bosons in ladder geometries,
finding that once stripes are formed, either via external pinning or
spontaneously, a sublattice reversal ($\pi$-phase shift) of \textit{charge}
ordering occurs, suppressing the superfluid weight. Lastly, we show that when
the Cooper pairs are not local, as in the attractive Hubbard model with finite
interactions, auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations show evidence of
fluctuating stripes, but these are seen to coexist with superfluidity. Our
results corroborate the picture that static stripes cannot be reconciled with
pairing, unlike the case of fluctuating ones.

<p>What factors fundamentally determine the value of superconducting transition
temperature (Tc) in high temperature superconductors has been the subject of
intense debate. Following the establishment of an empirical law known as
Homes'law, there is a growing consensus in the community that the Tc value of
the cuprate superconductors is closely linked to its superfluid density and
conductivity. However, all the data supporting this empirical law have been
obtained from the ambient-pressure superconductors. In this study, we present
the first high-pressure results about the connection of these two quantities
with Tc, through the studies on the Bi1.74Pb0.38Sr1.88CuO6+delta and
Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta, in which the value of their high-pressure resistivity (the
reciprocal of conductivity) is achieved by adopting our newly established
method, while the value of superfluid density is extracted using the Homes'law.
We highlight that the Tc values are strongly linked the two joint response
factors of magnetic field and electric field, i.e. superfluid density and
conductivity, respectively, implying that the physics governing the
determination of Tc is influenced by the intrinsic electromagnetic fields of
the system.

<p>When doped into a certain range of charge carrier concentrations, MoS2
departs from its pristine semiconducting character to become a strongly
correlated material characterized by exotic phenomena such as charge density
waves or superconductivity. However, the required doping levels are typically
achieved using ionic-liquid gating or air-sensitive alkali-ion intercalation,
which are not compatible with standard device fabrication processes. Here, we
report on the emergence of superconductivity and a charge density wave phase in
air-stable organic cation intercalated MoS2 crystals. By selecting two
different molecular guests, we show that these correlated electronic phases
depend dramatically on the intercalated cation, demonstrating the potential of
organic ion intercalation to finely tune the properties of 2D materials.
Moreover, we find that a fully developed zero-resistance state is not reached
in few-nm-thick flakes, indicating the presence of three-dimensional
superconductive paths which are severed by the mechanical exfoliation. We
ascribe this behavior to an inhomogeneous charge carrier distribution, which we
probe at the nanoscale using scanning near-field optical microscopy. Our
results establish organic-ion intercalated MoS2 as a platform to study the
emergence and modulation of correlated electronic phases.

<p>We systematically derive the quantum kinetic equation in full phase space for
any quadratic hamiltonian of bosonic fields, including in the absence of
translational invariance. This enables the treatment of boundaries,
inhomogeneous systems and states with non-trivial textures, such as skyrmions
in the context of magnetic bosons. We relate the evolution of the distribution
of bosons in phase space to single-electron, band-diagonal, physical quantities
such as Berry curvature and energy magnetization, by providing a procedure to
"diagonalize" the Hamiltonian in phase space, using the formalism of the Moyal
product. We obtain exact equations, which can be expanded order by order, for
example in the "smallness" of the spatial gradients, providing a
"semiclassical" approximation. In turn, at first order, we recover the usual
full Boltzmann equation and give a self-contained and exact derivation of the
intrinsic thermal Hall effect of bosons. The formulation clarifies the
contribution from "energy magnetization" in natural manner, and does not
require the inclusion of Luttinger's pseudo-gravitational field to obtain
thermal transport quantities.

<p>Recent research has made significant progress in understanding the non-phonon

their vibrational density of states follows non-Debye scaling laws. Here, we
show that the non-Debye scaling laws play a crucial role in determining
material properties of a broad range of amorphous solids, from ``hard"
amorphous solids like structural glasses to ``soft" amorphous solids such as
foams and emulsions. We propose a unified framework of viscoelasticity and
sound damping for these materials. Although these properties differ
significantly between hard and soft amorphous solids, they are determined by
the non-Debye scaling laws. We also validate our framework using numerical
simulations.

<p>The phenomenon of nonlinear transport has attracted tremendous interest
within the condensed matter community. We present a theoretical framework for
nonlinear transport based on the nonequilibrium retarded Green's function, and
examine the impact of disorder on nonlinear magnetotransport in Weyl semimetals
(WSMs). It is demonstrated that bilinear magnetoconductivity can be induced in
disordered WSMs by several mechanisms, including impurity-induced tilting of
the Weyl cones, Lorentz-force-induced normal orbital magnetic moment, and
chiral anomaly arising from the Berry-curvature-induced anomalous orbital
magnetic moment. Additionally, we observe that the localization of Weyl
fermions by impurity scattering will lead to resonant dips in both the chiral
chemical potential and magnetoconductivity when the Fermi energy approaches the
impurity resonance states. Our findings offer a theoretical proposition for
modulating nonreciprocal transport in topological semimetals.

semiclassical molecular dynamics approach. This system undergoes a quantum
phase transition from a ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic state under a
transverse magnetic field, and the magnetic responses reflecting this
transition is well described by our semiclassical method. We show that at
low-temperature the transverse component of the dynamical structure factor
depicts clearly the magnon dispersion, and the longitudinal component exhibits
two continua associated with single- and two-magnon excitations, respectively.
These spin excitation spectra show interesting temperature dependence as
effects of magnon interactions.Our findings shed light on experimental

<p>Motivated by recent progress on the experimental realization of proximate
deconfined quantum critical point in a frustrated quantum magnet, we study the
low-energy spin dynamics of a related checkerboard $J$-$Q$ model by using
quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The ground state of this model undergoes a
weakly first-order quantum phase transition with an emergent $O(4)$ symmetry
between an antiferromagnetic state and a plaquette valence bond solid. The
calculated spin lattice relaxation rate of nuclear magnetic resonance, $1/T_1$,
exhibits distinct low-temperature behaviors depending on the ground states.
With decreasing the temperature, $1/T_1$ rises up on the antiferromagnetic
side, characterizing a crossover to the renormalized classical regime, whereas
$1/T_1$ drops exponentially on the side of valence bond solid, reflecting the
gap opening in the plaquette ordered phase. The extracted spin gap scales with
the distance to the transition point as a power-law with an exponent
$\phi\approx0.3$, consistent with the scaling ansatz $\phi=\nu z$ with
$\nu\approx0.3$ and $z=1$. Near the quantum phase transition, the temperature
dependent $1/T_1$ shows a broad crossover regime where a universal scaling
$1/T_1\sim T^{\eta}$ with $\eta\approx0.6$ is found. Our results suggest a
quantum scaling regime associated with the emergent enhanced symmetry near this
first-order quantum phase transition.

<h3>Nuclear spin relaxation mediated by donor-bound and free electrons in  wide CdTe quantum wells</h3>

<p>The nuclear spin systems in CdTe/(Cd,Zn)Te and CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te quantum wells
(QW) are studied using a multistage technique combining optical pumping and
Hanle effect-based detection. The samples demonstrate drastically different
nuclear spin dynamics in zero and weak magnetic fields. In CdTe/(Cd,Zn)Te, the
nuclear spin relaxation time is found to strongly increase with the magnetic
field, growing from 3 s in zero field to tens of seconds in a field of 25 G. In
CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te the relaxation is an order of magnitude slower, and it is
field-independent up to at least 70 G. The differences are attributed to the
nuclear spin relaxation being mediated by different kinds of resident electrons
in these QWs. In CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te, a residual electron gas trapped in the QW
largely determines the relaxation dynamics. In CdTe/(Cd,Zn)Te, the fast
relaxation in zero field is due to interaction with localized donor-bound
electrons. Nuclear spin diffusion barriers form around neutral donors when the
external magnetic field exceeds the local nuclear field, which is about
$B_L\approx $0.4 G in CdTe. This inhibits nuclear spin diffusion towards the
donors, slowing down relaxation. These findings are supported by theoretical
modeling. In particular, we show that the formation of the diffusion barrier is
made possible by several features specific to CdTe: (i) the large donor binding
energy (about 10 meV), (ii) the low abundance of magnetic isotopes (only
$\approx$30% of nuclei have nonzero spin), and (iii) the absence of nuclear
quadrupole interactions between nuclei. The two latter properties are also
favorable to nuclear spin cooling via optical pumping followed by adiabatic
demagnetization. Under non-optimized conditions we have reached sub-microkelvin
nuclear spin temperatures in both samples, lower than all previous results
obtained in GaAs.

<h3>Altermagnetism in NiSi with non-collinear spins</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17451" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17451</a>
<br>
</p><i>Deepak K. Singh, Sang-Wook Cheong, Jiasen Guo</i>
<p>Recently, a new class of magnetic phenomenon, called altermagnetism, was
proposed where the underlying spin configuration resembles antiferromagnetic
structure, but the system violates \textbf{PT} (PT: Parity times Time reversal)
symmetry due to the alternation of crystalline symmetry across magnetic ions.
Although the original idea was proposed for the collinear spin structure, a
recent report by Cheong et al. has suggested that antiferromagnetic materials
with non-collinear spin structure and local alternation of crystalline
arrangement can also manifest altermagnetism. Besides breaking the \textbf{PT}
symmetry, altermagnetic compounds are also expected to exhibit anomalous Hall
effects of odd orders. Here, we discuss possible candidates in this regard. One
example is nickel monosilicide, which was recently shown to exhibit high
temperature antiferromagnetism with non-collinear spin structure. It fulfills
both criteria of breaking the \textbf{PT} symmetry and linear anomalous Hall
effect. In addition to NiSi, we also discuss two other potential experimental
venues for the exploration of altermagnetic states.

<h3>Field, frequency and temperature dependence of the surface resistance of  nitrogen diffused niobium superconducting radio frequency cavities</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17458" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17458</a>
<br>
</p><i>P. Dhakal, B.D. Khanal, A. Gurevich, G. Ciovati</i>
<p>We report the RF performance of several single-cell superconducting
radio-frequency cavities subjected to low temperature heat treatment in
nitrogen environment. The cavities were treated at temperature 120 - 165 C for
an extended period of time (24 - 48 hours) either in high vacuum or in a low
partial pressure of ultra-pure nitrogen. The improvement in Q0 with a Q-rise
was observed when nitrogen gas was injected at 300 C during the cavity cooldown
from 800 C and held at 165 C, without any degradation in accelerating gradient
over the baseline performance. The treatment was applied to several elliptical
cavities with frequency ranging from 0.75 GHz to 3.0 GHz, showing an improved
quality factor as a result of low temperature nitrogen treatments. The Q-rise
feature is similar to that achieved by nitrogen alloying Nb cavities at higher
temperature, followed by material removal by electropolishing. The surface
modification was confirmed by the change in electronic mean free path and tuned
with the temperature and duration of heat treatment. The decrease of the
temperature-dependent surface resistance with increasing RF field, resulting in
a Q-rise, becomes stronger with increasing frequency and decreasing
temperature. The data suggest a crossover frequency of 0.95 GHz above which the
Q-rise phenomenon occurs at 2 K. Some of these results can be explained
qualitatively with an existing model which calculates the intrinsic field
dependence of the surface resistance, considering both equilibrium and
nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution functions.

<p>Spin filtering is a fundamental operation in spintronics, enabling the
generation and detection of spin-polarized carriers. Here, we proposed and
theoretically demonstrated that a 3d transition metal (TM) doped silicon
quantum dot (SiQD) is a suitable candidate for spin filter device at room
temperature. Using density functional theory (DFT), we investigate the
structure, electronic properties, and magnetic behavior of TM-SiQD. Our
calculations demonstrate that Mn-doped SiQD exhibits the highest stability. The
designed spin-filter device using Mn-doped SiQD shows a spin-filtering
efficiency of 99.9% at 300K electrode temperature along with very high
conductance. This remarkable efficiency positions it as a promising candidate
for room-temperature spintronic devices.

<h3>Solitary cluster waves in periodic potentials: Formation, propagation,  and soliton-mediated particle transport</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Alexander P. Antonov, Artem Ryabov, Philipp Maass</i>
<p>Transport processes in crowded periodic structures are often mediated by
cooperative movements of particles forming clusters. Recent theoretical and
experimental studies of driven Brownian motion of hard spheres showed that
cluster-mediated transport in one-dimensional periodic potentials can proceed
in form of solitary waves. We here give a comprehensive description of these
solitons. Fundamental for our analysis is a static presoliton state, which is
formed by a periodic arrangements of basic stable clusters. Their size follows
from a geometric principle of minimum free space. Adding one particle to the
presoliton state gives rise to solitons. We derive the minimal number of
particles needed for soliton formation, number of solitons at larger particle
numbers, soliton velocities and soliton-mediated particle currents. Incomplete
relaxations of the basic clusters are responsible for an effective repulsive
soliton-soliton interaction seen in measurements. Our results provide a
theoretical basis for describing experiments on cluster-mediated particle
transport in periodic potentials.

<h3>Wave mechanics in an ionic liquid mixture</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Timothy S. Groves, Susan Perkin</i>
<p>Experimental measurements of interactions in ionic liquids and concentrated
electrolytes over the past decade or so have revealed simultaneous monotonic
and oscillatory decay modes. These observations have been hard to interpret
using classical theories, which typically allow for just one electrostatic
decay mode in electrolytes. Meanwhile, substantial progress in the theoretical
description of dielectric response and ion correlations in electrolytes has
illuminated the deep connection between density and charge correlations and the
multiplicity of decay modes characterising a liquid electrolyte. The challenge
in front of us is to build connections between the theoretical expressions for
pair correlation functions and the directly measured free energy of interaction
between macroscopic surfaces in experiments. Towards this aim, we here present
measurements and analysis of the interactions between macroscopic bodies across
a fluid mixture of two ionic liquids of widely diverging ionic size. The
measured oscillatory interaction forces in the liquid mixtures are
significantly more complex than for either of the pure ionic liquids, but can
be fitted to a superposition of two oscillatory and one monotonic mode with
parameters matching those of the pure liquids. We discuss this empirical
finding, which hints at a kind of wave mechanics for interactions in liquid
matter.

<br>
</p><i>Gerard Pelegrí, Stuart Flannigan, Andrew J. Daley</i>
<p>We investigate the properties of few interacting bosons in a Creutz ladder,
which has become a standard model for topological systems, and which can be
realised in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices. At the
single-particle level, this system may exhibit a completely flat energy
landscape with non-trivial topological properties. In this scenario, we
identify topological two-body edge states resulting from the bonding of
single-particle edge and flat-band states. We also explore the formation of
two- and three-body bound states in the strongly-interacting limit, and we show
how these quasi-particles can be engineered to replicate the flat-band and
topological features of the original single-particle model. Furthermore, we
show that in this geometry perfect Aharonov-Bohm caging of two-body bound
states may occur for arbitrary interaction strengths, and we provide numerical
evidence that the main features of this effect are preserved in an interacting
many-body scenario resulting in many-body Aharonov-Bohm caging.

<h3>Study of quantum non-locality by CHSH function and its extension in  disordered fermions</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Yoshihito Kuno</i>
<p>Quantum non-locality is an important concept in quantum physics. In this
work, we study the quantum non-locality in a fermion many-body system under
quasi-periodic disorders. The Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality is
systematically investigated, which quantifies quantum non-locality between two
sites. We find that the quantum non-locality explicitly characterize the
extended and critical phase transitions, and further that in the globally
averaged picture of maximum value of the quantum non-locality the CHSH
inequality is not broken, but for a local pair in the internal of the system
the violation probability of the CHSH inequality becomes sufficiently finite.
Further we investigate an extension of the CHSH inequality,
Mermin-Klyshko-Svetlichny (MKS) polynomials, which can characterize
multipartite quantum non-locality. We also find a similar behavior to the case
of CHSH inequality. In particular, in the critical regime and on a transition
point, the adjacent three qubit MKS polynomial in a portion of the system
exhibits a quantum non-local violation regime with a finite probability.

<p>Controlling electrically-stimulated quantum light sources (QLS) is key for
developing integrated and low-scale quantum devices. The mechanisms leading to
quantum emission are complex, as a large number of electronic states of the
system impacts the emission dynamics. Here, we use a scanning tunneling
microscope (STM) to excite a model QLS, namely a single molecule. The
luminescence spectra reveal two lines, associated to the emission of the
neutral and positively charged molecule, both exhibiting single-photon source
behavior. In addition, we find a correlation between the charged and neutral
molecule's emission, the signature of a photon cascade. By adjusting the
charging/discharging rate, we can control these emission statistics. This
generic strategy is further established by a rate equation model revealing the
complex internal dynamics of the molecular junction.

<p>Driving molecular assembly into micrometer-scale patterns is key for defining
advanced materials of interest in various fields, including life sciences,
photovoltaics, and quantum photonics. However, the driving process competes
with other forces, such as Brownian motion, ripening phenomena, capillary
forces, and non-specific adsorption. Here we report on a guided diffusion
mechanism of luminescent dye molecules encapsulated inside boron nitride
nanotubes (BNNTs). Correlative measurements between BNNT bending and molecular
position along the BNNT axis reveal an efficient and long-range migration of
dyes from curved to straight regions of the nanotube. This curvature activated
diffusion forms clusters of bright J-aggregates in periodic patterns of
well-defined spacing and length. A phenomenological model of guided molecular
transport in bended BNNTs is used to describe this directed 1D diffusion inside
BNNT. It is shown to accurately predict the position and morphologies of a
J-aggregate as a function of nanotube length. Coupling topological stimuli to
1D molecular diffusion at the nanoscale is here presented as an interesting
tool capable of reconfiguring various emissive patterns of functional molecules
at the mesoscopic scale.

<p>We report on the observation of the circular ratchet effect excited by
terahertz laser radiation in a specially designed two-dimensional metamaterial
consisting of a graphene monolayer deposited on a graphite gate patterned with
an array of triangular antidots. We show that a periodically driven Dirac
fermion system with spatial asymmetry converts the a.c. power into a d.c.
current, whose direction reverses when the radiation helicity is switched. The
circular ratchet effect is demonstrated for room temperature and a radiation
frequency of 2.54 THz. It is shown that the ratchet current magnitude can be
controllably tuned by the patterned and uniform back gate voltages. The results
are analyzed in the light of the developed microscopic theory considering
electronic and plasmonic mechanisms of the ratchet current formation.

<p>Ionic conductors have great potential for interesting tunable physical
properties via ionic liquid gating and novel energy storage applications such
as all-solid-state lithium batteries. In particular, low migration barriers and
high hopping attempt frequency are the keys to achieve fast ion diffusion in
solids. Taking advantage of the oxygen-vacancy channel in
$\mathrm{Li}_{x}\mathrm{{Sr}_{2}{Co}_{2}{O}_{5}}$, we show that migration
barriers of lithium ion are as small as 0.28~0.17eV depending on the lithium
concentration rates. Our first-principles calculation also investigated hopping
attempt frequency and concluded the room temperature ionic diffusivity and ion
conductivity is high as ${10}^{-7}\sim{10}^{-6}~\mathrm{{cm}^{2}~s^{-1}}$ and
${10}^{-3}\sim{10}^{-2}~\mathrm{S\cdot{cm}^{-1}}$ respectively, which
outperform most of perovskite-type, garnet-type and sulfide Li-ion solid-state
electrolytes. This work proves
$\mathrm{Li}_{x}\mathrm{{Sr}_{2}{Co}_{2}{O}_{5}}$ as a promising solid-state
electrolyte.

<p>MXene, the two-dimensional derivatives of MAX compounds, due to their
structural and compositional flexibility, is an ideal family of compounds to
study a number of structure-property relations. In this work, we have
investigated the tunability of magnetic properties in Cr-based MXenes that have
an in-plane ordering arising out of alloying Cr with another non-magnetic
transition metal atom. Using Density Functional Theory based calculations we
have explored the effects of composition and surface functionalisations on the
electronic and magnetic properties of these in-plane ordered MXenes known as
i-MXenes. We found that the electronic and magnetic ground states are quite
sensitive to the structure and composition. This provides enough tunability in
these compounds so that they can be used for practical applications. Our
calculated results of magnetic transition temperatures and magnetic anisotropy
energies are comparable to many a established two-dimensional magnets. These
put together widen the prospect of these i-MXenes for multiple usage as
magnetic devices making them attractive for further investigation.

<p>We present a comprehensive study of small-scale three-dimensional (3D)
tetrahedral CoFe nanostructure arrays prepared by focused electron beam-induced
deposition (FEBID) and placed in two distinct orientations with respect to the
direction of an external magnetic field. Using ultra-sensitive micro-Hall
magnetometry we obtain angular-dependent magnetic stray field hysteresis loops
that show characteristic cascading magnetic switching close to zero magnetic
field. By employing micromagnetic simulations we could reproduce the hysteresis
loops and identify characteristic field dependent magnetic configurations
including a vortex-type groundstate. From this we derive a coarse-graining
macrospin model and show that the complex switching behavior can be explained
by the reorientation dynamics of non-interacting uniaxial anisotropic magnetic
grains modeled as a superposition of Stoner-Wohlfarth particles.

<h3>Many-body perturbation theory for strongly correlated effective  Hamiltonians using effective field theory methods</h3>

</p><i>Raphaël Photopoulos, Antoine Boulet</i>
<p>Introducing low-energy effective Hamiltonians is usual to grasp most
correlations in quantum many-body problems. For instance, such effective
Hamiltonians can be treated at the mean-field level to reproduce some physical
properties of interest. Employing effective Hamiltonians that contain many-body
correlations renders the use of perturbative many-body techniques difficult
because of the overcounting of correlations. In this work, we develop a
strategy to apply an extension of the many-body perturbation theory, starting
from an effective interaction that contains correlations beyond the mean field
level. The goal is to re-organize the many-body calculation to avoid the
overcounting of correlations originating from the introduction of correlated
effective Hamiltonians in the description. For this purpose, we generalize the
formulation of the Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory by including free
parameters adjusted to reproduce the appropriate limits. In particular, the
expansion in the bare weak-coupling regime and the strong-coupling limit serves
as a valuable input to fix the value of the free parameters appearing in the
resulting expression. This method avoids double counting of correlations using
beyond-mean-field strategies for the description of many-body systems. The
ground state energy of various systems relevant for ultracold atomic, nuclear,
and condensed matter physics is reproduced qualitatively beyond the domain of
validity of the standard many-body perturbation theory. Finally, our method
suggests interpreting the formal results obtained as an effective field theory
using the proposed reorganization of the many-body calculation. The results,
like ground state energies, are improved systematically by considering higher
orders in the extended many-body perturbation theory while maintaining a
straightforward polynomial expansion.

<h3>Classification of electronic nematicity in three-dimensional crystals  and quasicrystals</h3>

</p><i>Matthias Hecker, Anant Rastogi, Daniel F. Agterberg, Rafael M. Fernandes</i>
<p>Electronic nematic order has been reported in a rich landscape of materials,
encompassing not only a range of intertwined correlated and topological
phenomena, but also different underlying lattice symmetries. Motivated by these
findings, we investigate the behavior of electronic nematicity as the spherical
symmetry of three-dimensional (3D) space is systematically lowered by the
lattice environment. We consider all 32 crystallographic point groups as well
as 4 major classes of quasicrystalline point groups, given the recent
observations of electronic phases of interest in quasicrystalline materials and
artificial twisted quasicrystals. Valuable insights are gained by establishing
a mapping between the five-component charge-quadrupolar nematic order parameter
of the electronic fluid and the 3D tensorial order parameter of nematic liquid
crystals. We find that a uniaxial nematic state is only generically realized in
polyhedral point groups (icosahedral and cubic), with the nematic director
pointing along different sets of rotational symmetry axes. Interestingly,
icosahedral point groups are the only ones in which the five nematic order
parameter components transform as the same irreducible representation, making
them the closest analog of 3D isotropic nematics. In axial point groups, one of
the nematic components is always condensed, whereas the other four components
decompose into an in-plane and an out-of-plane nematic doublet, resulting in
biaxial nematic ground states. Because these two nematic doublets behave as
$Z_q$-clock order parameters, this allows us to identify the types of crystals
and quasicrystals that can host interesting electronic nematic phenomena
enabled by the critical properties of the $q\geq 4$ clock model, such as
emergent continuous nematic fluctuations in 3D, critical phases with
quasi-long-range nematic order in 2D, and Ashkin-Teller nematicity in 2D.

<p>The interaction of surfaces in relative motion in wet environments is
dominated by lubrication forces. Lubrication plays a pivotal role in biological
processes and is key for the development of dynamic microscopic systems. Here,
we develop motile vesicles that exploit lubrication forces to roll on
substrates. The activity of the vesicle comes from the confined rotational flow
generated by an externally-driven rotating particle, which is encapsulated
within the vesicle by droplet-microfluidics. This confined fluid flows control
vesicle rotation and enable vesicle rolling on a substrate. Lubrication forces
driving vesicle rolling correlate with the frequency dependent shear behavior
of the membrane. Our findings shed light on the principles of lubricated
friction, offering insights for the design of motile vesicles that take
advantage of frictional forces to target specific locations. Our system also
opens an avenue to understand membrane confined fluid flows and their relevance
for force transduction in biological systems.

<p>Spin-flip methods applied to excited-state approaches like the Bethe-Salpeter
Equation allow access to the excitation energies of open-shell systems, such as
molecules and defects in solids. The eigenstates of these solutions, however,
are generally not eigenstates of the spin operator $\hat{S}^2$. Even for simple
cases where the excitation vector is expected to be, for example, a triplet
state, the value of $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$ may be found to differ from
2.00; this difference is called ``spin contamination.'' The expectation values
$\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$ must be computed for each excitation vector, to
assist with the characterization of the particular excitation and to determine
the amount of spin contamination of the state. Our aim is to provide for the
first time in the spin-flip methods literature a comprehensive resource on the
derivation of the formulas for $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$ as well as its
computational implementation. After a brief discussion of the theory of the
Spin-Flip Bethe-Salpeter Equation and some examples further illustrating the
need for calculating $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$, we present the derivation for
the general equation for computing $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$ with the
eigenvectors from an SF-BSE calculation, how it is implemented in a Python
script, and timing information on how this calculation scales with the size of
the SF-BSE Hamiltonian.

<p>The metallurgy and materials communities have long known and exploited
fundamental links between chemical and structural ordering in metallic solids
and their mechanical properties. The highest reported strength achievable
through the combination of multiple metals (alloying) has rapidly climbed and
given rise to new classifications of materials with extraordinary properties.
Metallic glasses and high-entropy alloys are two limiting examples of how
tailored order can be used to manipulate mechanical behavior. Here, we show
that the complex electronic-structure mechanisms governing the peak strength of
alloys and pure metals can be reduced to a few physically-meaningful parameters
based on their atomic arrangements and used (with no fitting parameters) to
predict the maximum strength of any metallic solid, regardless of degree of
structural or chemical ordering. Predictions of maximum strength based on the
activation energy for a stress-driven phase transition to an amorphous state is
shown to accurately describe the breakdown in Hall-Petch behavior at the
smallest crystallite sizes for pure metals, intermetallic compounds, metallic
glasses, and high-entropy alloys. This activation energy is also shown to be
directly proportional to interstitial (electronic) charge density, which is a
good predictor of ductility, stiffness (moduli), and phase stability in
high-entropy alloys, and in solid metals generally. The proposed framework
suggests the possibility of coupling ordering and intrinsic strength to
mechanisms like dislocation nucleation, hydrogen embrittlement, and transport
properties. It additionally opens the prospect for greatly accelerated
structural materials design and development to address materials challenges
limiting more sustainable and efficient use of energy.

<p>AeAFe4As4 (Ae = Ca, A = K; 1144) having a transition temperature of 35 K is a
stoichiometric family of iron-based superconductors (FBS). Here, we present a
detailed study of a high-pressure synthesis of CaKFe4As4 bulks to investigate
the impact of these conditions on the superconducting properties of the 1144
family. Additionally, these samples are also prepared by conventional synthesis
method at ambient pressure (CSP) and studied the influence of impurities on the
superconducting properties of CaKFe4As4. Structural, microstructural, transport
and magnetization measurements have been performed to reach the final
conclusions. Interestingly, the high-pressure synthesis of the parent CaKFe4As4
compound enhances the transition temperature (Tc) by 2 K and the critical
current density (Jc) by one order of magnitude in the whole magnetic field
range of 9 T than that of the 1144 bulks prepared by CSP. It suggests the
improvement of the pinning centers and grain connections by the high-pressure
synthesis approach. Interestingly, our results depict the superconducting onset
transition temperature (Tconset) of this stoichiometric 1144 family is robust
with the presence of the common 122 (CaFe2As2 or KFe2As2) impurity phases,
which is a different behavior compared to other FBS families. However, these
impurity phases reduce the grain connections and lead to the phase separation
during the formation of the superconducting (1144) phase.

<p>Ensemble Density Functional Theory (EDFT) is a generalization of ground-state
Density Functional Theory (GS DFT), which is based on an exact formal theory of
finite collections of a system's ground and excited states. EDFT in various
forms has been shown to improve the accuracy of calculated energy level
differences in isolated model systems, atoms, and molecules, but it is not yet
clear how EDFT could be used to calculate band gaps for periodic systems. We
extend the application of EDFT toward periodic systems by estimating the
thermodynamic limit with increasingly large finite one-dimensional
\enquote{particle in a box} systems, which approach the uniform electron gas.
Using ensemble-generalized Hartree and Local Spin Density Approximation (LSDA)
exchange-correlation functionals, we find that corrections go to zero in the
infinite limit, as expected for a metallic system. However, there is a
correction to the effective mass, as estimated from bi- and tri-ensembles,
indicating promise for non-trivial results for EDFT on periodic systems.
Singlet excitation energies are found to be positive, but triplet excitation
energies are sometimes negative (a triplet instability), pointing to
deficiencies of the approximations.
