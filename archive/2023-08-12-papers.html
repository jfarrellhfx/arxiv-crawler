<h3>Some information on acoustic topological insulator</h3>

In this exceedingly short review article, we have provided some information
on acoustic topological insulator for pedagogical purpose. Since, intrinsically
acoustic systems do not have Kramers doublets due to spin-zero status,
artificially acoustic spin-half states could be engineered as reported in refs.

<h3>Berry curvature and quantum metric in copper-substituted lead phosphate  apatite</h3>

The recent discovery of copper-substituted lead phosphate apatite, also known
as LK-99, has caught much attention owing to certain experimental evidence of
room-temperature superconductivity, although this claim is currently under
intensive debate. Be it superconducting or not, we show that the normal state
of this material has peculiar quantum geometrical properties that may be
related to the magnetism and the mechanism for flat band superconductivity.
Based on a recently proposed spinless two-band tight-binding model for the
Pb-Cu hexagonal lattice subset of the crystalline structure, which
qualitatively captures the two flat bands in the band structure, we elaborate
the highly anisotropic Berry curvature and quantum metric in the regions of
Brillouin zone where one flat band is above and the other below the Fermi
surface. In these regions, the Berry curvature has a pattern in the planar
momentum that remains unchanged along the out-of-plane momentum. Moreover, the
net orbital magnetization contributed from the Berry curvature is zero,
signifying that the magnetism in this material should come from other sources.
The quantum metric has a similar momentum dependence, and its two planar
components are found to be roughly the same but the out-of-plane component
vanishes, hinting that the superfluid stiffness of the flat band
superconductivity, shall it occur, may be quite anisotropic.

Recent reports of a possible room temperature superconductor called LK99 have
generated a lot of attention worldwide. In just a few days, a large amount of
experimental works attempted to reproduce this sample and verify its
properties. At the same time a large amount of theoretical and computational
works have also been reported. However, many experiments have drawn different
conclusions, and many theoretical and calculation results are not consistent
with experimental results. For one of the structures of LK99 with the chemical
formula as Pb9Cu(PO4)6O, many first-principles calculations did not consider
spin-orbit coupling and concluded that it is a flat-band metal. We performed
calculations of electronic structure with spin-orbit coupling, and the results
show that Pb9Cu(PO4)6O is an indirect bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of
0.292 eV in PBE+U level when Hubbard interaction U = 4 eV, and its conduction
band is a flat-band. Its ground state is ferromagnetic and has a small positive
magnetic anisotropy energy. After electron doping at the level of 0.5e/unit
cell, Pb9Cu(PO4)6O becomes metallic and has a flat-band with a width of only
0.025 eV at the Fermi level.

In a series of recent reports, doped lead apatite (LK-99) has been proposed
as a candidate ambient temperature and pressure superconductor. However, from
both an experimental and theoretical perspective, these claims are largely
unsubstantiated. To this end, our synthesis and subsequent analysis of an LK-99
sample reveals a multiphase material that does not exhibit high-temperature
superconductivity. We study the structure of this phase with single-crystal
X-ray diffraction (SXRD) and find a structure consistent with doped
$\text{Pb}_{10}(\text{PO}_4)_6(\text{OH})_2$. However, the material is
transparent which rules out a superconducting nature. From ab initio defect
formation energy calculations, we find that the material likely hosts
$\text{OH}^-$ anions, rather than divalent $\text{O}^{2-}$ anions, within the
hexagonal channels and that Cu substitution is highly thermodynamically
disfavored. Phonon spectra on the equilibrium structures reveal numerous
unstable phonon modes. Together, these calculations suggest it is doubtful that
Cu enters the structure in meaningful concentrations, despite initial attempts
to model LK-99 in this way. However for the sake of completeness, we perform ab
initio calculations of the topology, quantum geometry, and Wannier function
localization in the Cu-dominated flat bands of four separate doped structures.
In all cases, we find they are atomically localized by irreps, Wilson loops,
and the Fubini-Study metric. It is unlikely that such bands can support strong
superfluidity, and instead are susceptible to ferromagnetism (or out-of-plane
antiferromagnetism) at low temperatures, which we find in ab initio studies. In
sum, $\text{Pb}_{9}\text{Cu}(\text{PO}_4)_6(\text{OH})_2$ could more likely be
a magnet, rather than an ambient temperature and pressure superconductor.

<h3>The field theory of a superconductor with repulsion</h3>

<br>
A superconductor emerges as a condensate of electron pairs, which bind
despite their strong Coulomb repulsion. Eliashberg's theory elucidates the
mechanisms enabling them to overcome this repulsion and predicts the transition
temperature and pairing correlations. However, a comprehensive understanding of
how repulsion impacts the phenomenology of the resulting superconductor remains
elusive. We present a formalism that addresses this challenge by applying the
Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to an interaction including instantaneous
repulsion and retarded attraction. We first decompose the interaction into
frequency scattering channels and then integrate out the fermions. The
resulting bosonic action is complex and the saddle point corresponding to
Eliashberg's equations generally extends into the complex plane and away from
the physical axis. Using this understanding we develop an improved numerical
solver that outperforms standard techniques to solve the non-linear equations.
We then turn to consider fluctuations around this complex saddle point. The
matrix controlling fluctuations about the saddle point is found to be a
non-Hermitian symmetric matrix, which generally suffers from exceptional points
that are tuned by different parameters. These exceptional points may influence
the thermodynamics of the superconductor. For example, within the quadratic
approximation the upper critical field sharply peaks at a critical value of the
repulsion strength related to an exceptional point appearing at $T_c$. Our work
facilitates the mapping between microscopic and phenomenological theories of
superconductivity, particularly in the presence of strong repulsion. It has the
potential to enhance the accuracy of theoretical predictions for experiments in
systems where the pairing mechanism is unknown.

<h3>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomalies as obstructions to gauging (non-on-site)  symmetries</h3>

We study 't Hooft anomalies of global symmetries in 1+1d lattice Hamiltonian
systems. We consider anomalies in internal and lattice translation symmetries.
We derive a microscopic formula for the "anomaly cocycle" using topological
defects implementing twisted boundary conditions. The anomaly takes value in
the cohomology group $H^3(G,U(1)) \times H^2(G,U(1))$. The first factor
captures the anomaly in the internal symmetry group $G$, and the second factor
corresponds to a generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomaly involving $G$ and
lattice translation. We present a systematic procedure to gauge internal
symmetries (that may not act on-site) on the lattice. We show that the anomaly
cocycle is the obstruction to gauging the internal symmetry while preserving
the lattice translation symmetry. As an application, we construct anomaly-free
chiral lattice gauge theories. We demonstrate a one-to-one correspondence
between (locality-preserving) symmetry operators and topological defects, which
is essential for the results we prove. We also discuss the generalization to
fermionic theories. Finally, we construct non-invertible lattice translation
symmetries by gauging internal symmetries with a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomaly.

<h3>Gate-controlled anyon generation and detection in Kitaev spin liquids</h3>

Reliable manipulation of non-Abelian Ising anyons supported by Kitaev spin
liquids may enable intrinsically fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here, we
introduce a standalone scheme for both generating and detecting individual
Ising anyons using tunable gate voltages in a heterostructure containing a
non-Abelian Kitaev spin liquid and a monolayer semiconductor. The key
ingredients of our setup are a Kondo coupling to stabilize an Ising anyon in
the spin liquid around each electron in the semiconductor, and a large charging
energy to allow control over the electron numbers in distinct gate-defined
regions of the semiconductor. In particular, a single Ising anyon can be
generated at a disk-shaped region by gate tuning its electron number to one,
while it can be interferometrically detected by measuring the electrical
conductance of a ring-shaped region around it whose electron number is allowed
to fluctuate between zero and one. We provide concrete experimental guidelines
for implementing our proposal in promising candidate materials like
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.

<h3>Universal conductivity at a 2d superconductor-insulator transition: the  effects of quenched disorder and Coulomb interaction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05155" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05155</a>
<br>
<i>Chao-Jung Lee, Michael Mulligan</i>
<br>
<br>
We calculate the zero-temperature universal electrical conductivity at a
superconductor-insulator transition in two spatial dimensions. We focus on
transitions in the universality class of the dirty 3d XY model. We use a dual
model consisting of a single Dirac fermion at zero density coupled to a
Chern-Simons gauge field in the presence of a quenched random mass, with or
without an unscreened Coulomb interaction. Our calculation is performed in a
$1/N_f$ expansion, where $N_f$ is the number of Dirac fermions. At zeroth
order, the model exhibits particle-vortex self-dual electrical transport with
$\sigma_{xx} \lesssim (2e)^2/h$ and small, but finite $\sigma_{xy}$.
Corrections of $\mathcal{O}(1/N_f)$ due to fluctuations in the Chern-Simons
gauge field and disorder produce violations of self-duality. We find these
violations to be milder when the Coulomb interaction is present.

<h3>Neural network potentials for modeling nonstoichiometric materials: a  case of Chromium Sulfides Cr$_{(1-x)}$S</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05163" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05163</a>

<br>
<br>
Deviation from stoichiometry can yield a diverse range of stable phases with
distinct physical and chemical properties. To comprehensively explore
nonstoichiometric materials, it is crucial to investigate their compositional
and structural domains with precision and cost-effectiveness. However, the
extensive diversity in these domains render first-principles methods, such as
density functional theory (DFT), inappropriate for such endeavors. In this
study, we propose a generic framework that utilizes neural network potentials
(NNPs) to model nonstoichiometric materials with chemical accuracy at realistic
length and time scales. We apply our framework to analyze nonstoichiometric
Cr$_{(1-x)}$S materials, a compelling material category with significant
potential in the field of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials applications.
The efficacy of the NNP model is shown to outperform the conventional cluster
expansion (CE) model, exhibiting near-DFT accuracy and robust transferability
to unexplored crystal structures and compositions. Furthermore, we employ the
NNP model in simulated annealing (SA) optimizations to predict the low-energy
Cr$_{(1-x)}$S structures across diverse compositions. A notable structural
transition is discerned at the Cr$_{0.5}$S composition, characterized by a
preferential migration of half of the Cr atoms to the van der Waals (vdW) gaps.
This highlights the experimentally observed non-vdW nature of CrS$_2$ and
emphasizes the pivotal role of excess Cr atoms beyond the composition ratio of
Cr/S = $1/2$ in stabilizing the vdW gaps. Additionally, we employ the NNP model
in a large-scale vacancy diffusion Monte Carlo (MC) simulation to emphasize the
impact of lateral compressive strains in catalyzing the formation of vdW gaps
within 2D CrS$_2$ slabs. This provides a direct pathway for more facile
exfoliation of ultrathin CrS$_2$ nanosheets through strain engineering.

<h3>Interacting holes in gated WSe$_2$ quantum dots</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05169" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05169</a>
<br>
<i>Daniel Miravet, Abdulmenaf Altıntaş, Alina Wania Rodrigues, Maciej Bieniek, Marek Korkusinski, Paweł Hawrylak</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop here a theory of the electronic properties of a finite number of
valence holes in gated WSe$_2$ quantum dots, considering the influence of spin,
valley, electronic orbitals, and many-body interactions. The single-particle
wave functions are constructed by combining the spin-up and down states of the
highest valence bulk bands employing a multi-million atom ab-initio based
tight-binding model solved in the wave-vector space, allowing to study up to
100 nm radius quantum dots atomistically. The effects of the many-body
interactions are determined using the configuration interaction (CI) technique,
applied up to $N = 6$ holes occupying up to 6 electronic shells with 42
orbitals. Our results show that N=2 holes are in valley and spin
anti-ferromagnetic ground state, independent of the interaction strength and
the quantum dot size. However, we predict that higher number of holes can
undergo a transition to spontaneously broken symmetry valley and spin polarized
ferromagnetic phases, highlighting the interplay between the many-body effects
and the quantum dot lateral size and confining potential depth.

<h3>Effect of long-range interaction on dynamic quantum phase transitions of  an exactly solvable free-fermion model: non-analyticities at almost all times</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05182" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05182</a>
<br>
<i>J. C. Xavier, José A. Hoyos</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we investigate quenches in a free-fermion chain with long-range
hopping which decay with the distance with an exponent $\nu$ and has range $D$.
By exploring the exact solution of the model, we found that the dynamic free
energy is non-analytical, in the thermodynamic limit, whenever the sudden
quench crosses the equilibrium quantum critical point. We were able to
determine the non-analyticities of dynamic free energy $f(t)$ at some critical
times $t^{c}$ by solving nonlinear equations. We also show that the
Yang-Lee-Fisher (YLF) zeros cross the real-time axis at those critical times.
We found that the number of nontrivial critical times, $N_{s},$ depends on
$\nu$ and $D$. In particular, we show that for small $\nu$ and large $D$ the
dynamic free energy presents non-analyticities in any time interval $\Delta
t\sim1/D\ll1$, i.e., there are \emph{non-analyticities at almost all times}.
For the spacial case $\nu=0$, we obtain the critical times in terms of a simple
expression of the model parameters and also show that $f(t)$ is non-analytical
even for finite system under anti-periodic boundary condition, when we consider
some special values of quench parameters. We also show that, generically, the
first derivative of the dynamic free energy is discontinuous at the critical
time instant when the YLF zeros are non-degenerate. On the other hand, when
they become degenerate, all derivatives of $f(t)$ exist at the associated
critical instant.

<h3>High-dimensional reinforcement learning for optimization and control of  ultracold quantum gases</h3>

<br>
<br>
Machine-learning techniques are emerging as a valuable tool in experimental
physics, and among them, reinforcement learning offers the potential to control
high-dimensional, multistage processes in the presence of fluctuating
environments. In this work, we apply reinforcement learning to the preparation
of an ultracold quantum gas to realize a consistent and large number of atoms
at microkelvin temperatures. This reinforcement learning agent determines an
optimal set of thirty control parameters in a dynamically changing environment
that is characterized by thirty sensed parameters. By comparing this method to
that of training supervised-learning regression models, as well as to
human-driven control schemes, we find that both machine learning approaches
accurately predict the number of cooled atoms and both result in occasional
superhuman control schemes. However, only the reinforcement learning method
achieves consistent outcomes, even in the presence of a dynamic environment.

<h3>Phase transition of copper (I) sulfide and its implication for purported  superconductivity of LK-99</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05222" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05222</a>
<br>
<i>Prashant K. Jain</i>
<br>
<br>
Lee, Kim, and coworkers have recently claimed ambient temperature and
pressure superconductivity in a modified lead apatite material named LK-99.
However, the polycrystalline material synthesized has a significant fraction of
copper (I) sulfide. Copper (I) sulfide has a known phase transition at 104
degrees C from an ordered low-temperature phase to a high-temperature
superionic phase. As a result of this phase transition, copper (I) sulfide
exhibits sharp transitions in electrical resistivity and heat capacity, which
are expected to coincide with the temperature-induced transitions reported for
LK-99. This implies that LK-99 must be synthesized without any Cu$_2$S to allow
unambiguous validation of the superconducting properties of LK-99.

<br>
Anyonic Fabry-P\'erot and Mach-Zehnder interferometers have been proposed
theoretically and implemented experimentally as tools to probe electric charges
and statistics of anyons. The experimentally observed visibility of
Aharonov-Bohm oscillations is maximal at a high transmission through an
interferometer but simple theoretical expressions for the electric currents and
noises are only available at low visibility. We consider an alternative version
of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, in which anyons tunnel between co-propagating
chiral channels on the edges of quantum Hall liquids at the filling factors
$n/(2n+1)$. We find simple exact solutions for any transmission. The solutions
allow a straight-forward interpretation in terms of fractional charges and
statistics.

<h3>Quasi-one- and quasi-two-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures from weak  coupling to unitarity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05248" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05248</a>
<br>
<i>Pardeep Kaur, Sandeep Gautam, S. K. Adhikari</i>
<br>
<br>
We study ultracold superfluid Bose-Fermi mixtures in three dimensions, with
stronger confinement along one or two directions, using a non-perturbative
beyond-mean-field model for bulk chemical potential valid along the
weak-coupling to unitarity crossover. Although bosons are considered to be in a
superfluid state, we consider two possibilities for the fermions --
spin-polarized degenerate state and superfluid state. Simplified reduced
analytic lower-dimensional models are derived along the weak-coupling to
unitarity crossover in quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) and
quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) settings. The only parameters in these models
are the constants of the beyond-mean-field Bose-Bose and Fermi-Fermi
Lee-Huang-Yang interactions and the respective universal Bertsch parameter at
unitarity. In addition to the numerical results for a fully-trapped system, we
also present results for quasi-2D Bose-Fermi mixtures where one of the
components is untrapped but localized due to the interaction mediated by the
other component. We demonstrate the validity of the reduced quasi-1D and
quasi-2D models via a comparison of the numerical solutions for the ground
states obtained from the reduced models and the full three-dimensional (3D)
model.

<h3>An interaction-driven quantum many-body engine enabled by atom-atom  correlations</h3>

<br>
<br>
Quantum heat engines are capable of utilizing uniquely quantum many-body
effects to enhance the performance of classical engine cycles, implying a
quantum advantage. Here we propose and investigate the performance of a quantum
many-body Otto cycle operating under a sudden interaction quench protocol, with
a one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas as a working fluid. We show that the very
operation of this Otto cycle as an engine is enabled by atom-atom correlations
in the system. These correlations are different from those in a classical ideal
gas, and are a result of the interplay between quantum statistics,
interparticle interactions, and thermal fluctuations; extracting positive net
work from the system without such correlations would be impossible. We also
demonstrate how the performance of the engine can be further enhanced by
allowing particle exchange between the system and the thermal reservoirs, in
addition to heat exchange. We evaluate the performance of the engine using
approximate analytic and exact thermodynamic Bethe ansatz results available for
the Lieb-Liniger model that describes the 1D Bose gas, but we emphasise that
the broad conclusions arrived at here are not limited to this particular model.

<br>
Theoretical studies predicted possible superconductivity in electron-doped
chromium pnictides isostructural to their iron counterparts. Here, we report
the synthesis and characterization of a new ZrCuSiAs-type Cr-based compound
ThCrAsN, as well as its oxygen-doped variants. All samples of
ThCrAsN$_{1-x}$O$_x$ show metallic conduction, but no superconductivity is
observed above 30 mK even though the oxygen substitution reaches 75\%. The
magnetic structure of ThCrAsN is determined to be G-type antiferromagnetic by
magnetization measurements and first-principles calculations jointly. The
calculations also indicate that the in-plane Cr--Cr direct interaction of
ThCrAsN is robust against the heavy electron doping. The calculated density of
states of the orbital occupations of Cr for ThCrAs(N,O) is strongly
spin-polarized. Our results suggest the similarities between chromium pnictides
and iron-based superconductors shouldn't be overestimated.

<br>
<br>
The ability to transport single electrons on a quantum dot array dramatically
increases the freedom in designing quantum computation schemes that can be
implemented on solid-state devices. So far, however, routing schemes to
precisely control the transport paths of single electrons have yet to be
established. Here, we propose a silicon single-electron router that transports
pumped electrons along the desired route on the branches of a T-shaped quantum
dot array by inputting a synchronous phase-controlled signal to multiple gates.
Notably, we show that it is possible to achieve a routing accuracy above 99% by
implementing assist gates in front of the branching paths. The results suggest
new possibilities for fast and accurate transport of single electrons on
quantum dot arrays.

<br>
<br>
The time-evolving matrix product operators (TEMPO) method, which makes full
use of the Feynman-Vernon influence functional, is the state-of-the-art tensor
network method for bosonic impurity problems. However, for fermionic impurity
problems the Grassmann path integral prohibits application of this method. We
develop Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operators, a full fermionic
analog of TEMPO, that can directly manipulates Grassmann path integrals with
similar numerical cost as the bosonic counterpart. We further propose a zipup
algorithm to compute expectation values on the fly without explicitly building
a single large augmented density tensor, which boosts the efficiency of our
method on top of the vanilla TEMPO. We demonstrate our method on the
non-equilibrium dynamics of the single impurity Anderson models, and find a
favorable performance against existing tensor network influence functional
methods. Our method could significantly change the application landscape of
tensor network based impurity solvers.

<h3>Ferromagnetic monolayer with interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya  interaction: magnon spectrum and effect of quenched disorder</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05283" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05283</a>
<br>
<i>Oleg I. Utesov, Arseny V. Syromyatnikov</i>
<br>
<br>
We discuss theoretically a ferromagnetic monolayer with an interfacial
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) and a small axial anisotropy. It is
shown that the system has a long-period cycloid magnetic order slightly
distorted by the anisotropy whose modulation vector $\bf k$ can have several
orientations. We find that due to iDMI-induced umklapp terms in the
Hamiltonian, the spectrum of long-wavelength magnons is essentially
anisotropic: it is linear and quadratic for momenta directed along and
perpendicular to $\bf k$, respectively. Due to such a quasi-1D spectrum, the
temperature correction to the mean spin value has a power-law singularity
hampering the magnetic ordering at $T\ne0$. We demonstrate that the umklapps
lead to a peculiar band structure of the magnon spectrum similar to electronic
bands in solids. We discuss also the effect of vacancies and defect bonds on
system properties at $T=0$. Owing to the quasi-1D character of the spectrum,
the distortion of the cycloid structure by a single defect bond is described by
the field of 1D electric dipole. As a result, even infinitesimal concentrations
of defects $c$ destroy the long-range order and establish a short-range order
whose correlation length shows a power-law dependence on $1/c$. Our findings
should also be applicable to ultra-thin films with strong enough iDMI.

We investigated the temperature- and frequency-dependent optical scattering
rates in the pseudogap phase of cuprates using model pseudogap and
electron-boson spectral density (EBSD) functions. We obtained the scattering
rates at various temperatures below and above a given pseudogap temperature
using a generalized Allen's (or Sharapov's) formula, which has been used to
analyse the measured optical spectra of correlated electron systems with a
non-constant density of states at finite temperatures. The pseudogap and EBSD
functions should be temperature dependent to simulate the Fermi liquid-like
behaviour of underdoped cuprate systems observed in optical studies. Therefore,
the observed Fermi liquid-like behaviour can be understood by considering the
combined contribution from the T-dependent EBSD function and the T-dependent
pseudogap. We also obtained the optical conductivity spectra from the optical
scattering rates and analyzed them to investigate intriguing electronic
properties. We expect that our results will aid in understanding the Fermi
liquid-like optical response in the pseudogap phase and in revealing the
microscopic pairing mechanism for superconductivity in cuprates.

Planckian behavior has been recently observed in La1.76Sr0.24CuO4 at the
pseudogap critical point. The Planckian behavior takes place in an intriguing
quantum metallic state at a quantum critical point. Here, the Planckian
behavior was simulated with an energy-independent (or flat) and weakly
temperature-dependent electron-boson spectral density (EBSD) function by using
a generalized Allen's (Shulga's) formula. We obtained various optical
quantities from the flat EBSD function, such as the optical scattering rate,
the optical effective mass, and the optical conductivity. These quantities are
well fitted with the recently observed Planckian behavior. Fermi-liquid
behavior was also simulated with an energy-linear and temperature-independent
EBSD function. The EBSD functions agree well with the overall doping- and
temperature-dependent trends of the EBSD function obtained from the optically
measured spectra of cuprate systems, which can be crucial for understanding the
microscopic electron-pairing mechanism for high-Tc superconductivity in
cuprates.

We report synthesis, characterization, and physical properties of layered
bismuth-sulfide compounds La2O2Bi3-xPb1+xS6. We synthesized a new La2O2Bi3PbS6
compound, whose crystal structure is similar to those of the La2O2Bi3AgS6
superconductor or La2O2Bi2Pb2S6 (insulator) with a four-layer-type conducting
layer. The crystal structure of La2O2Bi3PbS6 is characterized in a tetragonal
P4/nmm space group, and the lattice parameters are a = 4.084(1) {\AA} and c =
19.71(2) {\AA}. The obtained La2O2Bi3PbS6 sample exhibits narrow gap
semiconductor (metallic-like) transport behavior with an anomaly near the 160
K. A metallic-like to insulator transition has been observed through Pb
substitution, with increasing x in La2O2Bi3-xPb1+xS6. Furthermore, we applied
external pressure for x = 0 and observed pressure-induced superconductivity.
The onset of superconductivity appeared at 0.93 GPa, and the highest transition
temperature was 3.1 K at 2.21 GPa.

The exchange-correlation (XC) functional in density functional theory is used
to approximate multi-electron interactions. A plethora of different functionals
is available, but nearly all are based on the hierarchy of inputs commonly
referred to as "Jacob's ladder." This paper introduces an approach to construct
XC functionals with inputs from convolutions of arbitrary kernels with the
electron density, providing a route to move beyond Jacob's ladder. We derive
the variational derivative of these functionals, showing consistency with the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and provide equations for variational
derivatives based on multipole features from convolutional kernels. A
proof-of-concept functional, PBEq, which generalizes the PBE$\alpha$ framework
where $\alpha$ is a spatially-resolved function of the monopole of the electron
density, is presented and implemented. It allows a single functional to use
different GGAs at different spatial points in a system, while obeying PBE
constraints. Analysis of the results underlines the importance of error
cancellation and the XC potential in data-driven functional design. After
testing on small molecules, bulk metals, and surface catalysts, the results
indicate that this approach is a promising route to simultaneously optimize
multiple properties of interest.

<h3>The nematic susceptibility of the ferroquadrupolar metal TmAg2 measured  via the elastocaloric effect</h3>

Elastocaloric measurements of the ferroquadrupolar/nematic rare-earth
intermetallic TmAg$_2$ are presented. TmAg$_2$ undergoes a cooperative
Jahn-Teller-like ferroquadrupolar phase transition at 5K, in which the
Tm$^{3+}$ ion's local $4f$ electronic ground state doublet spontaneously splits
and develops an electric quadrupole moment which breaks the rotational symmetry
of the tetragonal lattice. The elastocaloric effect, which is the temperature
change in the sample induced by adiabatic strains the sample experiences, is
sensitive to quadrupolar fluctuations in the paranematic phase which couple to
the induced strain. We show that elastocaloric measurements of this material
reveal a Curie-Weiss like nematic susceptibility with a Weiss temperature of
$\approx 2.7K$, in agreement with previous elastic constant measurements.
Furthermore, we establish that a magnetic field along the c-axis acts as an
effective transverse field for the quadrupole moments.

In contrast to hole-doped cuprates, electron-doped cuprates consistently
exhibit strong antiferromagnetic correlations with a commensurate ({\pi},
{\pi}) ordering wave vector, leading to the prevalent belief that
antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations mediate Cooper pairing in these
unconventional superconductors. However, early investigations produced two
paradoxical findings: while antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations create the
largest pseudogap at "hot spots" in momentum space, Raman scattering and
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements using the leading-edge
method seem to suggest the superconducting gap is also maximized at these
locations. This presented a dilemma for spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing:
Cooper pairing is strongest at momenta where normal state low energy spectral
weight is most suppressed. Here we investigate this dilemma in Nd2-xCexCuO4
using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy under significantly improved
experimental conditions. The unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio and resolution
allow us to directly observe the Bogoliubov quasiparticles, demonstrating the
existence and importance of two sectors of states: 1. The reconstructed main
band and the states gapped by the antiferromagnetic pseudogap around the hot
spots. 2. The gossamer Fermi surface states with distinct dispersion inside the
pseudogap, from which Bogoliubov quasiparticle coherence peaks emerge below Tc.
Supported by numerical results, we propose that the non-zero modulus of the
antiferromagnetic order parameter causes the former, while fluctuations in the
antiferromagnetic order parameter orientation are responsible for the latter.
Our revelations of the gossamer Fermi surface reconcile the paradoxical
observations, deepening our understanding of superconductivity in
electron-doped cuprates in particular, and unconventional superconductivity in
general.

spectrum from the measured spectrum using an extended Drude-Lorentz model for
the normal state and a two-parallel-channel approach for the superconducting
(SC) state, based on the generalized Allen formula. The coupling constant,
maximum SC transition temperature, SC coherence length, and upper critical
field were extracted from the bosonic spectrum. The superfluid plasma frequency
and the London penetration depth were obtained from the optical conductivity.
We compared the physical quantities of Co-doped Ba122 and K-doped Ba122 and
found some interesting differences. Our results may be helpful for
understanding superconductivity in doped Ba122 systems and may provide useful
information on doped Ba122 systems for their applications.

We study the magneto-photoluminescence of an optically trapped
exciton-polariton condensate in a planar semiconductor microcavity with
multiple In0.08Ga0.92As quantum wells. Extremely high condensate coherence time
and continuous control over the polariton confinement are amongst the
advantages provided by optical trapping. This allows us to resolve magnetically
induced {\mu}eV fine energy shifts in the condensate, and identify unusual
dynamical regions in its parameter space. We observe polariton Zeeman splitting
and, in small traps with tight confinement, demonstrate its full parametric
screening when the condensate density exceeds a critical value, reminiscent of
the spin- Meissner effect. For larger optical traps, we observe a complete
inversion in the Zeeman splitting as a function of power, underlining the
importance of condensate confinement and interactions with its background
reservoir excitons.

<br>
<br>
Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) are a novel type of topological
phases which supports $d$-dimensional topological boundary states in
$D$-dimensional systems with $D-d>1$. In this work, we theoretically predict
that interlayer couplings in AB-stacked bilayer transition-metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) lead to the emergence of extrinsic second-order
topological phases, where corner states are induced by the band inversion of
zigzag edge bands. We find that the systems feature a quantized multiband Berry
phase defined for a zigzag nanoribbon geometry, unveiling the nontrivial
topological properties of its two zigzag edges. With detailed investigation
into the bilayer TMDs under different geometries, we find two types of
boundary-obstructed corner states arising from different corner terminations of
either the same type of or heterogeneous zigzag edges. The topological nature
of these corner states and their degeneracy is further analyzed with both the
crystalline symmetries of different geometries, and a topological phase
transition of the Berry phase induced by a layer-dependent onsite energy.

characteristics expected from solar cells at radiative detailed balance limits.
Transient as well as steady state intensity dependent measurements indicate
that our solar cells are indeed operating at such limits with interface
passivation comparable to the champion c-Si technology. Remarkably, our
analysis also facilitates novel characterization schemes which enable
consistent back extraction of important recombination parameters from
opto-electrical measurements. These results have significant implications
towards fundamental electronic processes in perovskite solar cells and further
efficiency optimization towards Shockeley-Queisser limits.

Superconductors based on transition metal dichalcogenides are of substantial
current relevance, towards attaining topological superconductivity. Here we
report a detailed study on the synthesis and electromagnetic characterization
of high-quality single crystals of TaSeS. A superconducting transition is
confirmed at 4.15K with coexisting charge density wave onset at 66K. The
temperature dependence of RF penetration depth indicates s-wave characteristics
in the weak coupling limit. A moderate electronic anisotropy is observed in
upper critical fields with a value of 1.52. DFT calculations confirm the
possibility of superconducting behavior of TaSeS and also suggest that the most
stable structure belongs to P63mc space group. Negative values in phonon
dispersion curves verify the possibility of co-existing CDW in 2H-TaSeS.
Arrhenius plots show power law dependence of activation energy with respect to
magnetic field. Overall all characteristics imply TaSeS to be a classic Type-II
superconductor without any evidence for topological superconductivity.

Understanding the reactivity of carbon surfaces is crucial for the
development of advanced functional materials. In this study, we systematically
investigate the reactivity of graphene surfaces with the Stone-Wales (SW)
defect using Density Functional Theory calculations. We explore the atomic
adsorption of various elements, including rows 1-3 of the Periodic Table,
potassium, calcium, and selected transition metals. Our results demonstrate
that the SW defect enhances binding with the studied adsorbates when compared
to pristine graphene, with carbon and silicon showing the most significant
differences. Additionally, we examine the effects of mechanical deformation on
the lattice by constraining the system with the SW defect to the pristine
graphene cell. Interestingly, these constraints lead to even stronger binding
interactions. Furthermore, for carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen adsorbates, we
observe that mechanical deformation triggers the incorporation of adatoms into
the carbon bond network, leading to the reorganization of the SW defect
structure. This work establishes a foundation for future studies in the defect
and strain engineering of graphene, opening avenues for developing advanced
materials and catalysts with enhanced reactivity and performance.

Among exciting recent advances in the field of two-dimensional (2D)
materials, the successful fabrications of the C60 fullerene networks has been a
particularly inspiring accomplishment. Motivated by the recent achievements,
herein we explore the stability and physical properties of novel hexagonal
boron-carbon fullerene 2D heterostructures, on the basis of already synthesized
B40 and C36 fullerenes. By performing extensive structural minimizations of
diverse atomic configurations using the density functional theory method, for
the first time, we could successfully detect thermally and dynamically stable
boron-carbon fullerene 2D heterostructures. Density functional theory results
confirm that the herein predicted 2D networks exhibit very identical
semiconducting electronic natures with topological flat bands. Using the
machine learning interatomic potentials, we also investigated the mechanical
and thermal transport properties. Despite of different bonding architectures,
the room temperature lattice thermal conductivity of the predicted nanoporous
fullerene heterostructures was found to range between 4 to 10 W/mK.
Boron-carbon fullerene heterostructures are predicted to show anisotropic but
also remarkable mechanical properties, with tensile strengths and elastic
modulus over 8 and 70 GPa, respectively. This study introduces the possibility
of developing a novel class of 2D heterostructures based on the fullerene
cages, with attractive electronic, thermal and mechanical features.

<br>
<br>
Finite-temperature ductility-brittleness and electronic structures of
Al$_3$Sc, Al$_2$Sc and AlSc are studied comparatively by first-principles
calculations and ab-initio molecular dynamics. Results show that Al$_3$Sc and
Al$_2$Sc are inherently brittle at both ground state and finite temperatures.
By contrast, AlSc possesses a significantly superior ductility evaluated from
all Pugh's, Pettifor's and Poisson's ductility-brittleness criteria. At ground
state, AlSc meets the criteria of ductile according to Pugh's and Poisson's
theories, while it is categorized as the brittle in the frame of Pettifor's
picture. With the increasing temperature, the ductility of all the studied
compounds exhibits a noticeable improvement. In particular, as the temperature
rises, the Cauchy pressure of AlSc undergoes a transition from negative to
positive. Thus, at high temperatures (T > 600 K), AlSc is unequivocally
classified as the ductile from all criteria considered. In all Al$_3$Sc,
Al$_2$Sc and AlSc, the Al-Al bond, originated from s-p and p-p orbital
hybridizations, and the Al-Sc bond, dominated by p-d covalent hybridization,
are the first and second strongest chemical bonds, respectively. To explain the
difference in mechanical properties of the studied compounds, the mean bond
strength (MBS) is evaluated. The weaker Al-Al bond in AlSc, leading to a
smaller MBS, could be the origin for the softer elastic stiffness and superior
intrinsic ductility. The longer length of the Al-Al bond in AlSc is responsible
for its weaker bond strength. Furthermore, the enhanced metallicity of the
Al-Al bond in AlSc would also contribute to its exceptional ductility.

<br>

A quantum system constrained to a degenerate energy eigenspace can undergo a
nontrival time evolution upon adiabatic driving, described by a non-Abelian
Berry phase. This type of dynamics may provide logical gates in quantum
computing that are robust against timing errors. A strong candidate to realize
such holonomic quantum gates is an electron or hole spin qubit trapped in a
spin-orbit-coupled semiconductor, whose twofold Kramers degeneracy is protected
by time-reversal symmetry. Here, we propose and quantitatively analyze
protocols to measure the non-Abelian Berry phase by pumping a spin qubit
through a loop of quantum dots. One of these protocols allows to characterize
the local internal Zeeman field directions in the dots of the loop. We expect a
near-term realisation of these protocols, as all key elements have been already
demonstrated in spin-qubit experiments. These experiments would be important to
assess the potential of holonomic quantum gates for spin-based quantum
information processing.

While bacterial swarms can exhibit active turbulence in vacant spaces, they
naturally inhabit crowded environments. We numerically show that driving
disorderly active fluids through porous media enhances Darcy's law. While
purely active flows average to zero flux, hybrid active/driven flows display
greater drift than pure-driven fluids. This enhancement is non-monotonic with
activity, leading to an optimal activity to maximize flow rate. We incorporate
the active contribution into an active Darcy's law, which may serve to help
understand anomalous transport of swarming in porous media.

<br>
<br>
Electronic conductance through a single molecule is sensitive towards its
structural orientation between two electrodes, owing to the distribution of
molecular orbitals and their coupling to the electrode levels, that are
governed by quantum confinement effects. Here, we vary the contact geometry of
the porphine molecule by attaching two Au tip electrodes that resemble the
mechanical break junction, via thiol anchoring groups. We investigate the
current-voltage characteristics of all the contact geometries using
non-equilibrium Green's function formalism along with density functional theory
and tight-binding framework. We observe varying current responses with changing
contact sites, originating from varied wave-function delocalization and quantum
interference effect. Our calculations show asymmetric current-voltage
characteristics under forward and reverse biases due to structural asymmetry of
the tip electrodes in either sides of the molecule. We establish this
phenomenon as a universal feature for any molecular electronic device,
irrespective of the inherent structural symmetry of a molecule. This will
provide fundamental insights of electronic transport through single molecule in
real experimental setup. Furthermore, our observations of varying current
response can further motivate the fabrication of sensor devices with porphine
based biomolecules that control important physiological activities, in view of
their applications in advanced diagnostics.

Soliton molecules, bound states of two solitons, can be important for the
informatics using solitons and the quest for exotic particles in a wide range
of physical systems from unconventional superconductors to nuclear matter and
Higgs field, but have been observed only in temporal dimension for classical
wave optical systems. Here, we identify a topological soliton molecule formed
spatially in an electronic system, a quasi 1D charge density wave of indium
atomic wires. This system is composed of two coupled Peierls chains, which are
endowed with a Z$_4$ topology and three distinct, right-chiral, left-chiral,
and non-chiral, solitons. Our scanning tunneling microscopy measurements
identify a bound state of right- and left-chiral solitons with distinct in-gap
states and net zero phase shift. Our density functional theory calculations
reveal the attractive interaction of these solitons and the hybridization of
their electronic states. This result initiates the study of the interaction
between solitons in electronic systems, which can provide novel manybody
electronic states and extra data-handling capacity beyond the given soliton

WTe$_2$ recently attracted considerable attention as a layered material

WTe$_2$, including the unreported low frequency region. A novel Raman peak (P0)
was found at approximately 9 cm$^{-1}$ in addition to the seven already known
peaks. Furthermore, the angular and polarization dependence of the spectra
revealed that the novel peak had $A_1$ symmetry. The existence of this novel
peak is consistent with first principles calculations by another group. Our

<br>
<br>
We compute the Renyi entropy in a one-dimensional transverse-field quantum
Ising model by employing a swapping operator acting on the states which are
prepared from the neural network methods. In the static ground state, Renyi
entropy can uncover the critical point of the quantum phase transition from
paramagnetic to ferromagnetic. At the critical point, the relation between the
Renyi entropy and the subsystem size satisfies the predictions from conformal
field theory. In the dynamical case, we find coherent oscillations of the Renyi
entropy after the end of the linear quench. These oscillations have universal
frequencies which may come from the superpositions of excited states. The
asymptotic form of the Renyi entropy implies a new length scale away from the
critical point. This length scale is also verified by the overlap of the
reduced Renyi entropy against the dimensionless subsystem size.

Recent preprints claimed that the copper doped lead apatite
Pb$_9$CuP$_6$O$_{25}$ (LK99) might be a high-temperature superconductor because
of its strong diamagnetism and transport properties. Motivated by the strongly
correlated effects that can arise from a triangular lattice of Cu atoms with
narrow bandwidth, we calculated the maximally projected Wannier functions from
density functional theory simulations, and constructed a minimal two-orbital
triangular model with Cu ($3d_{xz},3d_{yz}$) basis, and a four-orbital buckled
honeycomb model with Cu ($3d_{xz},3d_{yz}$), O ($2p_x,2p_y$). Since the Coulomb
interaction Ud is much larger than potential energy difference between Cu and
O, charge transfer will occur for hole filling fraction $n_h > 1$. We further
calculate the interaction parameters, and discuss the possible insulating state
and corresponding spin exchange coupling.

The existence of spontaneous magnetization that fingerprints a ground-state
ferromagnetic order was recently observed in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals
materials. Despite progress in the fabrication and manipulation of the
atom-thick magnets, investigation of nanoscale magnetization properties is
still challenging due to the concomitant technical issues. We propose a
promising approach for a direct visualization of the domain walls formed in 2D
magnetic materials. By interfacing 2D magnet with a transition metal
dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayer, the strong proximity effects enable pinning the
TMD excitons on the domain wall. The emergent localization stems from the
proximity-induced exchange mixing between spin-dark and spin-bright TMD
excitons due to the local in-plane magnetization characteristic of the domain
wall in the magnetic monolayer.

Materials with complex inner structure can be challenging to characterize in
an effective way. First, it is difficult to determine the representative volume
for such a heterogeneous material. Second, the effective material parameters
significantly depend on the structure, and thus on the interface properties. In
the present paper, we focus on composite metal foams, and we attempt to
determine the effective thermal parameters. We use the heat pulse experiment to
study its transient thermal response. We observed deviation from Fourier's law,
and thus we propose an evaluation procedure for such experimental data using
the Guyer--Krumhansl heat equation. Furthermore, we studied the effective
parameters, the specific heat, mass density, thermal conductivity and thermal
diffusivity, and we propose a method for deducing a more reliable thermal
diffusivity and thermal conductivity based on the transient temperature
history.

We present a novel experimental protocol using Cathodoluminescence
measurements as a function of the electron incident energy to study both
exciton diffusion in a directional way and surface exciton recombination. Our
approach overcomes the challenges of anisotropic diffusion and the limited
applicability of existing methods to the bulk counterparts of 2D materials. The
protocol is then applied at room and at cryogenic temperatures to four bulk
hexagonal boron nitride crystals grown by different synthesis routes. The
exciton diffusivity depends on the sample quality but not on the temperature,
indicating it is limited by defect scattering even in the best quality
crystals. The lower limit for the diffusivity by phonon scattering is 0.2
cm$^{2}$.s$^{-1}$. Diffusion lengths were as much as 570 nm. Finally, the
surface recombination velocity exceeds 10$^{5}$ cm$^{2}$.s$^{-1}$, at a level
similar to silicon or diamond. This result reveals that surface recombination
could strongly limit light-emitting devices based on 2D materials.

We report on the experimental realization and characterization of an
exciton-polariton qubit prototype. In our system, a Bose-Einstein condensate of
semiconductor exciton-polaritons is confined by a spatially-patterned pump
laser in an annular trap that supports energy-degenerate circulating currents
of the polariton superfluid. Using non-invasive temporal interference
measurements, we observe coherent oscillations between a pair of
counter-circulating superfluid vortex states of the polaritons coupled by
elastic scattering off the laser-imprinted potential. The qubit basis states
correspond to the symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of the two vortex
states forming orthogonal double-lobe spatial wavefunctions. By engineering the
potential, we tune the coupling and coherent oscillations between the two
circulating current states, control the energies of the qubit basis states and
thereby initialize the qubit in the desired state. The dynamics of the system
is accurately reproduced by our theoretical two-state model, and we discuss
potential avenues to achieve complete control over our polaritonic qubit and
implement controllable interactions and quantum gates between such qubits.

Phototaxis is a light driven self-locomotion of mass and a common phenomenon
in motile organisms with varieties of motility such as in bacteria, algae, etc.
In naturally occurring organisms, mechanical force is generated utilising their
metabolic energy to propel and swim in presence of light, performing important
bio-chemical reactions. Herein, we report a new class of micro-swimmers that
exhibit captivating and complicated micro-swimming mediated colony formation
properties resembling green algae. A facile pyrolysis reaction is explored
leading to homogeneous organic Nano-structures forming patterned
self-assemblies among themselves. A delicate balance of colloid surface forms
interesting architectures such as dynamic colonies, thallus like patterning and
cilia like micro-arms. In presence of weak light both positive and negative
phototaxis are seen moving the micro-swimmers propelling towards and away from
the light respectively. During swimming helical motion and electrostatic
interactions of colloidal micro-swimmers with neighbouring assemblies are
observed. The nature of assembly formation is found to be fractal and can be
disintegrated using strong light. Strong exposure stimulates predominately fast
negative phototaxis leading to directional propulsion along the light path. All
these algae life-like behaviour of the colloidal carbonaceous lyophilic
colloids are stable in alcohol and can be reversibly discontinued with water
due to super-hydrophilicity. We therefore introduce a class of life-like
colloidal chemical architecture. Our discovery may entice studies for creation
of a diverse programmable micro-swimmers for microscopic understanding and
manipulating collective effect of the assemblies for bio-mimetic and catalytic
applications.

Allosterism traditionally refers to local changes in an extended object, for
instance the binding of a ligand to a macromolecule, leading to a localized
response at some other, possibly quite remote position. Here, we show that such
fascinating effects may already occur in very simple and common quantum
many-body systems, such as an anisotropic Heisenberg spin chain: Introducing an
impurity at one end of a sufficiently long chain may lead to quite significant
changes of the observable behavior near the other end, but not in the much
larger region in between. Specifically, spin autocorrelation functions at
thermal equilibrium are found to exhibit a pronounced allosterism of this type.

<h3>Loss of memory of an elastic line on its way to limit cycles</h3>

Under an oscillating mechanical drive, an amorphous material progressively
forgets its initial configuration and might eventually converge to a limit
cycle. Beyond quasistatic drivings, how structurally disordered systems lose or
record such memory remains theoretically challenging. Here we investigate these
issues in a minimal model system -- with quenched disorder and memory encoded
in a spatial pattern -- where the oscillating protocol can formally be replaced
by finite positive-velocity driving. We consider an elastic line driven at zero
temperature in a fixed disordered landscape, with bi-periodic boundary
conditions and tunable system size. This setting allows us to control the area
swept by the line at each cycle in a given disorder realisation, as would the
amplitude of an oscillating drive. We find that the line converges to
disorder-dependent limit cycles, jointly for its geometrical \emph{and}
velocity profiles. Moreover, the way it forgets its initial condition is
strongly coupled to the nature of the velocity dynamics it displays depending
on system size. We conclude on the implications of these results for the
response of amorphous materials under \emph{non}-quasistatic oscillating
protocols.

Superconducting materials with high critical temperature have the potential
to revolutionize many fields, including military, electronic communications,
and power energy. Therefore, Scientists around the world have been tirelessly
working with the ultimate goal of achieving high temperature superconductivity.
In 2023, a preprint by S. Lee et al in South Korea claimed the discovery of
ultra-high-temperature superconductivity with a critical temperature of up to
423 K in Cu-doped lead-apatite (LK-99) (arXiv:2307.12008, arXiv:2307.12037),
which caused a worldwide sensation and attention. Herein, the electronic
structures, phonon dynamics, and electrical conductivities of LK-99 and its
parent compound lead-apatite have been calculated using first-principles
methods. The results show that the lead-apatite compound and the LK-99 compound
are insulator and half-metal respectively. The flat band characteristic is
consistent with previous calculations. The electrical conductivity of LK-99
compound shows two extreme point, and the electrical conductivity along the
C-axis increases significantly after 400 K. The phonon dispersion spectra of
the compounds were investigated, demonstrating their dynamic instability.

Recently synthesized novel phase of germanium selenide ({\gamma}-GeSe) adopts
a hexagonal lattice and a surprisingly high conductivity than graphite. This
triggers great interests in exploring its potential for thermoelectric
applications. Herein, we explored the thermoelectric performance of monolayer
{\gamma}-GeSe and other isostructural {\gamma}-phase of group-IV
monochalcogenides {\gamma}-GeX (X = S, Se and Te) using the density functional
theory and the Boltzmann transport theory. A superb thermoelectric performance
of monolayer {\gamma}-GeSe is revealed with figure of merit ZT value up to
1.13-2.76 for n-type doping at a moderate carrier concentration of
4.73-2.58x10^12 cm-2 between 300 and 600 K. This superb performance is rooted
in its rich pocket states and flat plateau levels around the electronic band
edges, leading to promoted concentrations and electronic conductivity, and
limited thermal conductivity. Our work suggests that monolayer {\gamma}-GeSe is
a promising candidate for high performance medium-temperature thermoelectric
applications.

Linear algebraic primitives are at the core of many modern algorithms in
engineering, science, and machine learning. Hence, accelerating these
primitives with novel computing hardware would have tremendous economic impact.
Quantum computing has been proposed for this purpose, although the resource
requirements are far beyond current technological capabilities, so this
approach remains long-term in timescale. Here we consider an alternative
physics-based computing paradigm based on classical thermodynamics, to provide
a near-term approach to accelerating linear algebra.
At first sight, thermodynamics and linear algebra seem to be unrelated
fields. In this work, we connect solving linear algebra problems to sampling
from the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution of a system of coupled harmonic
oscillators. We present simple thermodynamic algorithms for (1) solving linear
systems of equations, (2) computing matrix inverses, (3) computing matrix
determinants, and (4) solving Lyapunov equations. Under reasonable assumptions,
we rigorously establish asymptotic speedups for our algorithms, relative to
digital methods, that scale linearly in matrix dimension. Our algorithms
exploit thermodynamic principles like ergodicity, entropy, and equilibration,
highlighting the deep connection between these two seemingly distinct fields,
and opening up algebraic applications for thermodynamic computing hardware.

and we calculate the density-density linear-response function in the limit of
large number of (fracton) flavours. We show how to construct its random-phase

<h3>Fatigue behavior of Cu-Zr metallic glasses under cyclic loading</h3>

The effect of oscillatory shear deformation on the fatigue life, yielding
transition, and flow localization in metallic glasses is investigated using
molecular dynamics simulations. We study a well-annealed Cu-Zr amorphous alloy
subjected to periodic shear at room temperature. We find that upon loading for
hundreds of cycles at strain amplitudes just below a critical value, the
potential energy at zero strain remains nearly constant and plastic events are
highly localized. By contrast, at strain amplitudes above the critical point,
the plastic deformation is gradually accumulated upon continued loading until
the yielding transition and the formation of a shear band across the entire
system. Interestingly, when the strain amplitude approaches the critical value
from above, the number of cycles to failure increases as a power-law function,
which is consistent with the previous results on binary Lennard-Jones glasses.

In an absorptive system the Wigner reaction $K-$matrix (directly related to
the impedance matrix in acoustic or electromagnetic wave scattering) is
non-selfadjoint, hence its eigenvalues are complex. The most interesting regime
arises when the absorption, taken into account as an imaginary part of the
spectral parameter, is of the order of the mean level spacing. I show how to
derive the mean density of the complex eigenvalues for reflection problems in
disordered or chaotic systems with broken time-reversal invariance. The
computations are done in the framework of nonlinear $\sigma-$ model approach,
assuming fixed $M$ and $N\to \infty$. Some explicit formulas are provided for
zero-dimensional quantum chaotic system as well as for a semi-infinite quasi-1D
system with fully operative Anderson localization.

<i>Ignacio del Amo, Peter Ditlevsen</i>
<br>
<br>
Many physical and chemical phenomena are governed by stochastic escape across
potential barriers. The escape time depends on the structure of the noise and
the shape of the potential barrier. By applying $\alpha$-stable noise from the
$\alpha=2$ Gaussian noise limit to the $\alpha<2$ jump processes, we find a
continuous transition of the mean escape time from the usual dependence on the
height of the barrier for Gaussian noise to a dependence solely on the width of
the barrier for $\alpha$-stable noise. We consider the exit problem of a
process driven by $\alpha$-stable noise in a double well potential. We study
individually the influences of the width and the height of the potential
barrier in the escape time and we show through scalings that the asymptotic
laws are described by a universal curve independent of both parameters. When
the dependence in the stability parameter is considered, we see that there are
two different diffusive regimes in which diffusion is described either by
Kramer's time or by the corresponding asymptotic law for $\alpha$-stable noise.
We determine the regions of the noise parameter space in which each regime
prevails, and exploit this result to construct an anomalous example in which a
double well potential exhibit a different diffusion regime in each well for a
wide range of parameters.

<h3>Anomalous Coherence Length in Superconductors with Quantum Metric</h3>

<br>
<br>
The coherence length $\xi$ is a fundamental length scale of superconductors
which governs the sizes of Cooper pairs, vortices, Andreev bound states and
more. In existing microscopic theories of superconductivity, it is expected
that as the attractive interaction increases, $\xi$ decreases as the electrons
are bound together more strongly. In BCS theory, for example, the coherence
length is $\xi_\mathrm{BCS} = \hbar v_{F}/\Delta$, where $v_{F}$ is the Fermi
velocity and $\Delta$ is the pairing gap. It is clear that increasing $\Delta$
will shorten $\xi_\mathrm{BCS}$. However, the situation is puzzling for
superconductors with completely flat bands in which $v_{F}$ goes to zero and
$\xi_\mathrm{BCS}$ is expected to be zero. In this work, we show that the
quantum metric, which is the real part of the quantum geometric tensor, gives
rise to an anomalous contribution to the coherence length. Specifically, $\xi =
\sqrt{\xi_\mathrm{BCS}^2 +\ell_{\mathrm{qm}}^{2}}$ for a superconductor where
$\ell_{\mathrm{qm}}$ is the quantum metric contribution. In the flat band
limit, $\xi$ does not vanish but bound by $\ell_{\mathrm{qm}}$. Incredibly, for
the nontrivial flat bands with Chern number $C$, $\xi$ has a topological bound
of $\xi\geq a\sqrt{\vert C \vert/4\pi}$ where $a$ is the lattice constant.
Physically, the Cooper pair size of a superconductor cannot be squeezed down to
a size smaller than $\ell_{\mathrm{qm}}$ which is a fundamental length scale
determined by the quantum geometry of the bands. Finally, we calculate the
quantum metric contributions for the superconducting moir\'e graphene family
and show that the quantum metric effects are very important in these
superconductors.

We study a system where the two edges of a non-Hermitian lattice with
asymmetric nearest-neighbor hopping are connected with two Hermitian lattices
with symmetric nearest-neighbor hopping.
In the absence of those Hermitian lattices, the majority of the eigenstates
of the system will be localized at the edges, the phenomena known as the
non-Hermitian skin effect. We show that once we connect it with the Hermitian
lattices, for open boundary conditions (OBC), the localized states exist at the
junction of the non-Hermitian and Hermitian lattice; moreover, the spectrum
shows mobility edges that separate delocalized and localized states. On the
contrary, mobility edges vanish for periodic boundary conditions (PBC), and the
delocalized phase turns into a scale-invariant localized phase, where the
localized states are still peaked at the junctions. We also find that if the
connected Hermitian lattices are thermodynamically large, in OBC, most of the
states become delocalized, while in PBC, the system still shows the
scale-invariant localized phase.

Bernal bilayer graphene hosts even denominator fractional quantum Hall states
thought to be described by a Pfaffian wave function with nonabelian
quasiparticle excitations. Here we report the quantitative determination of
fractional quantum Hall energy gaps in bilayer graphene using both thermally
activated transport and by direct measurement of the chemical potential. We
find a transport activation gap of 5.1K at B = 12T for a half-filled N=1 Landau
level, consistent with density matrix renormalization group calculations for
the Pfaffian state. However, the measured thermodynamic gap of 11.6K is smaller
than theoretical expectations for the clean limit by approximately a factor of
two. We analyze the chemical potential data near fractional filling within a
simplified model of a Wigner crystal of fractional quasiparticles with
long-wavelength disorder, explaining this discrepancy. Our results
quantitatively establish bilayer graphene as a robust platform for probing the
non-Abelian anyons expected to arise as the elementary excitations of the
even-denominator state.

We explore the rich landscape of higher-form and non-invertible symmetries
that emerge at low energies in generic ordered phases. Using that their charge
is carried by homotopy defects (i.e., domain walls, vortices, hedgehogs, etc.),
we find the fusion higher category that describes them when there are finitely
many types of homotopy defects, which depends only on the spontaneous
symmetry-breaking (SSB) pattern of the ordered phase. These emergent symmetries
are not spontaneously broken in the ordered phase. We show that spontaneously
breaking them induces a phase transition into a nontrivial, defect-suppressed
disordered phase that can have symmetry-enriched (non-)abelian topological
orders, photons, and even more emergent symmetries. This SSB transition is
between two distinct SSB phases$\unicode{x2013}$an ordinary and generalized
one$\unicode{x2013}$making it a possible generalized deconfined quantum
critical point. We also investigate the 't Hooft anomalies of these emergent
symmetries and conjecture that there is always a mixed anomaly between them and
the microscopic symmetry spontaneously broken in the ordered phase. One way
this anomaly can manifest is through the fractionalization of the microscopic
symmetry's quantum numbers. Our results demonstrate that even the most exotic
generalized symmetries emerge in ordinary phases and provide a valuable
framework for characterizing them and their transitions.

Quasiparticles are emergent excitations of matter that underlie much of our
understanding of quantum many-body systems. Therefore, the prospect of
manipulating their properties with external fields -- or even destroying them
-- has both fundamental and practical implications. However, in solid-state
materials it is often challenging to understand how quasiparticles are modified
by external fields owing to their complex interplay with other collective
excitations, such as phonons. Here, we take advantage of the clean setting of
homogeneous quantum gases and fast radio-frequency control to manipulate Fermi
polarons -- quasiparticles formed by impurities interacting with a
non-interacting Fermi gas -- from weak to ultrastrong drives. Exploiting two
internal states of the impurity species, we develop a steady-state
spectroscopy, from which we extract the energy of the driven polaron. We
measure the decay rate and the quasiparticle residue of the driven polaron from
the Rabi oscillations between the two internal states. At large drive
strengths, the so-extracted quasiparticle residue exceeds unity, raising
intriguing questions on the relationship between the Rabi oscillations and the
impurity's spectral functions. Our experiment establishes the driven Fermi
polaron as a promising platform for studying controllable quasiparticles in
strongly driven quantum matter.
