<i>Xiaoyang Huang, Andrew Lucas, Umang Mehta, Marvin Qi</i>
<p>We apply "hydrodynamic" effective field theory techniques to an ersatz Fermi
liquid. Our effective theory, which captures the correlation functions of
density operators at each angle on the Fermi surface, can only deviate from
conventional Fermi liquid behavior if the effective theory is non-local.
Neglecting non-local effects, the ersatz Fermi liquid's effective action is the
Legendre transform of the effective action for Fermi liquids, based on the
coadjoint orbit method, up to irrelevant corrections.

<p>We determine the hydrodynamic relaxation times $\tau_\eta$ for the shear
viscosity and $\tau_\kappa$ for the thermal conductivity in the normal phase of
a unitary Fermi gas confined in a box potential. Using a kinetic theory
relaxation model, we extract $\tau_\eta$ and $\tau_\kappa$ from the
time-dependent free-decay of a spatially periodic density perturbation,
yielding the universal density-shift coefficients for the shear viscosity and
thermal conductivity.

<h3>Enhanced Superconductivity in SrTiO$_3$-based Interfaces via Amorphous  Al2O3 Capping</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14051" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14051</a>

<p>Oxide interfaces feature unique two-dimensional (2D) electronic systems with
diverse electronic properties such as tunable spin-orbit interaction and
superconductivity. Conductivity emerges in these interfaces when the thickness
of an epitaxial polar layer surpasses a critical value, leading to charge
transfer to the interface. Here, we show that depositing amorphous alumina on
top of the polar oxide can reduce the critical thickness and enhance the
superconducting properties for the (111) and the (100) SrTiO$_3$-based
interfaces. A detailed transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals that
the enhancement of the superconducting properties is linked to the expansion of
the LaAlO$_3$ lattice in a direction perpendicular to the interface. We propose
that the increase in the superconducting critical temperature, Tc, is a result
of epitaxial strain

<h3>The Thermoelectric Effect and Its Natural Heavy Fermion Explanation in  Twisted Bilayer and Trilayer Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14057" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14057</a>
<br>
<i>Dumitru Călugăru, Haoyu Hu, Rafael Luque Merino, Nicolas Regnault, Dmitri K. Efetov, B. Andrei Bernevig</i>
<p>We study the interacting transport properties of twisted bilayer graphene
(TBG) using the topological heavy-fermion (THF) model. In the THF model, TBG
comprises localized, correlated $f$-electrons and itinerant, dispersive
$c$-electrons. We focus on the Seebeck coefficient, which quantifies the
voltage difference arising from a temperature gradient. We find that the TBG's
Seebeck coefficient shows unconventional (strongly-interacting) traits:
negative values with sawtooth oscillations at positive fillings, contrasting
typical band-theory expectations. This behavior is naturally attributed to the
presence of heavy (correlated, short-lived $f$-electrons) and light
(dispersive, long-lived $c$-electrons) electronic bands. Their longer lifetime
and stronger dispersion lead to a dominant transport contribution from the
$c$-electrons. At positive integer fillings, the correlated TBG insulators
feature $c$- ($f$-)electron bands on the electron (hole) doping side, leading
to an overall negative Seebeck coefficient. Additionally, sawtooth oscillations
occur around each integer filling due to gap openings. Our results highlight
the essential importance of electron correlations in understanding the
transport properties of TBG and, in particular, of the lifetime asymmetry
between the two fermionic species (naturally captured by the THF model). Our
findings are corroborated by new experiments in both twisted bilayer and
trilayer graphene, and show the natural presence of strongly-correlated heavy
and light carriers in the system.

<h3>Many-body effects on superconductivity mediated by double-magnon  processes in altermagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14061" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14061</a>
<br>
<i>Kristian Mæland, Bjørnulf Brekke, Asle Sudbø</i>
<p>Altermagnets exhibit a large electron spin splitting which can be understood
as a result of strong coupling between itinerant electrons and localized spins.
We consider superconductivity due to electron-magnon scattering, using
strong-coupling Eliashberg theory to capture many-body effects that are not
covered by a weak-coupling approach. The characteristic band structure of
altermagnets puts significant constraints on the spin structure of electron
scattering on the Fermi surface. We emphasize the role of spin-preserving,
double-magnon scattering processes compared to conventional spin-flip processes
involving a single magnon. Then, we derive the Eliashberg equations for a
situation where double-magnon scattering mediates spin-polarized Cooper pairs,
while both double-magnon and single-magnon scatterings contribute to many-body
effects. These many-body effects impact superconducting properties in a way
that differs significantly from systems where conventional spin-flip processes
mediate superconductivity. To highlight the role of $d$-wave magnetism on
superconductivity in altermagnets, we compare our results to those found in
ferromagnetic half-metals and conventional antiferromagnetic metals.

<h3>Absence of localization in Weyl semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14063" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14063</a>
<br>
<i>Jinmin Yi, A.A. Burkov</i>
<p>One of the fundamental facts of condensed matter physics is that sufficient
amount of disorder always turns a Fermi liquid metal into an Anderson
insulator: a compressible, but non-conducting phase of matter. Recently,
topological semimetals have emerged as another way a metallic phase may be
realized. In this paper we point out that, unlike ordinary metals, at least
some topological semimetals are immune to localization, provided certain
conditions are satisfied. We present several physical arguments, based on
diagrammatic perturbation theory and Keldysh field theory, as well as domain
wall network construction, to back up this claim.

<h3>Origins of temperature-dependent magnetism in open-shell 4$d$ and 5$d$  halide perovskites</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14064" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14064</a>
<br>
<i>Ying Li, Ram Seshadri, Stephen D. Wilson, Anthony K. Cheetham, Roser Valenti</i>
<p>A few $4d$ and $5d$ transition metal compounds with various electron fillings
were recently found to exhibit magnetic susceptibilities $\chi$ and magnetic
moments that deviate from the well-established Kotani model. This model has
been considered for decades to be the canonical expression to describe the
temperature dependence of magnetism in systems with non-negligible spin-orbit
coupling effects. In this work, we uncover the origin of such discrepancies and
determine the applicability and limitations of the Kotani model by calculating
the temperature dependence of the magnetic moments of a series of $4d$
(Ru-based) and $5d$ (W-based) systems at different electron fillings. For this
purpose, we perform exact diagonalization of $ab~initio$-derived relativistic
multiorbital Hubbard models on finite clusters and compute their magnetic
susceptibilities. Comparison with experimentally measured magnetic properties
indicates that contributions such as a temperature independent $\chi_0$
background, crystal field effects, Coulomb and Hund's couplings, and intersite
interactions - not included in the Kotani model - are specially crucial to
correctly describe the temperature dependence of $\chi$ and magnetic moments at
various electron fillings in these systems. Based on our results, we propose a
generalized approach to describe their magnetism.

<h3>Altermagnetic superconducting diode effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14071" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14071</a>
<br>
<i>Sayan Banerjee, Mathias S. Scheurer</i>
<p>Non-reciprocal superconductivity, also known as the superconducting diode
effect, has been extensively studied in the presence of a magnetic field or
some form of ferromagnetic order breaking time-reversal symmetry. We here show
that another class of magnetic order known as altermagnetism, which also breaks
time-reversal symmetry but does not exhibit a finite net magnetic moment, can
also give rise to a superconducting diode effect. Whether this is the case
depends on the combination of the system's point group and altermagnetic order
parameter which we explore systematically for two-dimensional crystalline
systems. If the superconducting electrons are in a centrosymmetric crystalline
environment, an electric field $E_z$ (or other sources of inversion symmetry
breaking) can be used to turn on and tune the non-reciprocity, yielding an
electric-field tunable diode effect; there are also non-centrosymmetric point
groups, which are not reached by applying $E_z \neq 0$ in a centrosymmetric
crystal, but still allow for an altermagnetic order parameter with
non-reciprocal superconductivity. Depending on the residual magnetic point
group, the zeros of the critical current asymmetry, $J_c(\hat{n}) -
J_c(-\hat{n})$, are pinned along high-symmetry crystalline directions
$\hat{n}=\hat{e}_j$ or are free to rotate in the plane of the system. In some
cases, the zeros can be rotated by tuning the electric field $E_z$. We discuss
all of these phenomena both on the general level using exact symmetry arguments
and more explicitly by constructing and solving minimal lattice models. We
provide experimental setups to realize the altermagnetic superconducting diode
effect.

<h3>Itinerant magnetism and magnetic polarons in the triangular lattice  Hubbard model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14074" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14074</a>
<br>
<i>Ivan Morera, Eugene Demler</i>
<p>We use density matrix renormalization group to investigate the phase diagram
of the Fermi Hubbard model on a triangular lattice with densities above
half-filling, $1 \leq n < 2$. We discuss the important role of kinetic
magnetism and magnetic polarons. For strong interactions and low doublon
dopings, attractive interaction between polarons results in phase separation
between the fully polarized state at finite doping and the commensurate
spin-density wave state at half-filling. For intermediate interaction strength
and small doping, competition between antiferromagnetic superexchange and
kinetic magnetism gives rise to the incommensurate spin density wave (I-SDW)
phase. Fully polarized ferromagnetic (FPF) phase for weak interactions is
limited to dopings close to the van Hove singularity in the density of states.
With increasing interactions the FPF phase expands to lower dopings. For strong
interactions it reaches the low doping regime and is better understood as
arising from proliferation of Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic polarons. Other phases
that we find include a partially polarized phase, another type of I-SDW at high
densities, and M\"uller-Hartmann ferromagnetism close to the band insulating
regime.

<h3>On dualities of paired quantum Hall bilayer states at $ν_T =  \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14088" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14088</a>
<br>
<i>Luca Rüegg, Gaurav Chaudhary, Robert-Jan Slager</i>
<p>Density-balanced, widely separated quantum Hall bilayers at $\nu_T = 1$ can
be described as two copies of composite Fermi liquids (CFLs). The two CFLs have
interlayer weak-coupling BCS instabilities mediated by gauge fluctuations, the
resulting pairing symmetry of which depends on the CFL hypothesis used. If both
layers are described by the conventional Halperin-Lee-Read (HLR) theory-based
composite electron liquid (CEL), the dominant pairing instability is in the
$p+ip$ channel; whereas if one layer is described by CEL and the other by a
composite hole liquid (CHL, in the sense of anti-HLR), the dominant pairing
instability occurs in the $s$-wave channel. Using the Dirac composite fermion
(CF) picture, we show that these two pairing channels can be mapped onto each
other by particle-hole (PH) transformation. Furthermore, we derive the CHL
theory as the non-relativistic limit of the PH-transformed massive Dirac CF
theory. Finally, we prove that an effective topological field theory for the
paired CEL-CHL in the weak-coupling limit is equivalent to the exciton
condensate phase in the strong-coupling limit.

<h3>Excitation Spectrum and Spin Hamiltonian of the Frustrated Quantum Ising  Magnet Pr$_3$BWO$_9$</h3>

<i>J. Nagl, D. Flavián, S. Hayashida, K. Yu. Povarov, M. Yan, N. Murai, S. Ohira-Kawamura, G. Simutis, T. J. Hicken, H. Luetkens, C. Baines, A. Hauspurg, B. V. Schwarze, F. Husstedt, V. Pomjakushin, T. Fennell, Z. Yan, S. Gvasaliya, A. Zheludev</i>
<p>We present a thorough experimental investigation on single crystals of the
rare-earth based frustrated quantum antiferromagnet Pr$_3$BWO$_9$, a purported
spin-liquid candidate on the breathing kagome lattice. Despite its disordered
ground state and unusual excitation spectrum involving a coexistence of sharp
spin-waves and broad continuum excitations, we show through a combination of
thermodynamic, magnetometric, neutron- and muon spectroscopy experiments with
detailed theoretical modeling that this material should be understood in a
completely different framework. The crystal field splits the lowest
quasi-doublet states into two singlets moderately coupled through frustrated
superexchange, resulting in a simple effective Hamiltonian of an Ising model in
a transverse magnetic field. While our neutron spectroscopy data do point to
significant correlations within the kagome planes, the dominant interactions
are out-of-plane, forming frustrated triangular spin-tubes through two
competing ferro-antiferromagnetic bonds. The resulting ground state is a simple
quantum paramagnet, but with significant modifications to both thermodynamic
and dynamic properties due to small perturbations to the transverse field Ising
model in the form of hyperfine enhanced nuclear moments and weak structural
disorder.

<h3>Nonlinear longitudinal current of band-geometric origin in wires of  finite thickness</h3>

<br>
<i>Robin Durand, Louis-Thomas Gendron, Théo Nathaniel Dionne, Ion Garate</i>
<p>The miniaturization of integrated circuits is facing an obstruction due to
the escalating electrical resistivity of conventional copper interconnects. The
underlying reason for this problem was unveiled by Fuchs and Sondheimer, who
showed that thinner wires are more resistive because current-carrying electrons
encounter the rough surfaces of the wire more frequently therein. Here, we
present a generalization of the Fuchs-Sondheimer theory to Dirac and Weyl
materials, which are candidates for next-generation interconnects. We predict a
nonlinear longitudinal electric current originating from the combined action of
the Berry curvature and non-specular surface-scattering.

<h3>Bound states in the continuum in a tangential ring with pointlike  impurities</h3>

<br>
<i>M.A. Figueroa, Vladimir Juricic, P.A. Orellana</i>
<p>Quantum rings coupled to external nanowires offer a versatile platform for
the manipulation of the quantum mesoscopic transport. We here study such a
system including periodically distributed pointlike impurities along the ring.
Based on an exact expression for the conductance found here, we demonstrate
that the bound-states in continuum (BICs) form from the ring states at the
high-symmetry momenta in the ring's Brillouin zone. Furthermore, the presence
of the inversion symmetry allows for a selective decoupling of resonant states,
favoring the BIC generation and therefore allowing an extra tunability in the
quantum transport of the system. Finally, we suggest that the magnetic fluxes
and Rashba spin-orbit coupling offer other possible routes for the BIC
formation in laterally coupled quantum rings.

<h3>Quantum state preparation of topological chiral spin liquids via Floquet  engineering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14141" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14141</a>
<br>
<i>Matthieu Mambrini, Didier Poilblanc</i>
<p>In condensed matter, Chiral Spin Liquids (CSL) are quantum spin analogs of
electronic Fractional Quantum Hall states (in the continuum) or Fractional
Chern Insulators (on the lattice). As the latter, CSL are remarquable states of
matter, exhibiting topological order and chiral edge modes. Preparing CSL on
quantum simulators like cold atom platforms is still an open challenge. Here we
propose a simple setup on a finite cluster of spin-1/2 located at the sites of
a square lattice. Using a Resonating Valence Bond (RVB) non-chiral spin liquid
as initial state on which fast time-modulations of strong nearest-neighbor
Heisenberg couplings are applied, following different protocols
(out-of-equilibrium quench or semi-adiabatic ramping of the drive), we show the
slow emergence of such a CSL phase. An effective Floquet dynamics, obtained
from a high-frequency Magnus expansion of the drive Hamiltonian, provides a
very accurate and simple framework fully capturing the out-of-equilibrium
dynamics. An analysis of the resulting prepared states in term of Projected
Entangled Pair states gives further insights on the topological nature of the
chiral phase. Finally, we discuss possible applications to quantum computing.

<h3>Discrete slip plane analysis of ferrite microtensile tests: On the  influence of dislocation source distribution and non-Schmid effects on slip  system activity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14168" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14168</a>
<br>
<i>J. Wijnen, J.P.M. Hoefnagels, M.G.D. Geers, R.H.J. Peerlings</i>
<p>The slip system activity in microtensile tests of ferrite single crystals is
compared with predictions made by the discrete slip plane model proposed by
Wijnen et al. (International Journal of Solids and Structures 228, 111094,
2021). This is an extension of conventional crystal plasticity in which the
stochastics and physics of dislocation sources are taken into account in a
discrete slip band. This results in discrete slip traces and non-deterministic
mechanical behavior, similar to what is observed in experiments. A detailed
analysis of which slip systems are presumed to be active in experiments is
performed. In small-scale mechanical tests on BCC metals and alloys, non-Schmid
effects are often needed to explain the observed response. Therefore, these
effects are incorporated into the model by extending a non-Schmid framework
commonly used to model {110} slip to {112} planes. The slip activity in the
simulations is compared to the slip activity in single crystal ferrite
microtensile tests. This is done for the discrete slip plane model with and
without non-Schmid effects, as well as for a conventional crystal plasticity
model. The conventional crystal plasticity model fails to predict the diversity
in active slip systems that is observed experimentally. The slip activity
obtained with the discrete slip plane model is in convincingly better agreement
with the experiments. Including non-Schmid effects only entails minor
differences. This suggests that stochastic effects dominate the behavior of
ferrite crystals with dimensions in the order of a few micrometers and that
non-Schmid effects may not play a large role.

<h3>Ferroelectricity at the extreme thickness limit in the archetypal  antiferroelectric PbZrO$_3$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14176" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14176</a>
<br>
<i>Nikhilesh Maity, Milan Haddad, Nazanin Bassiri-Gharb, Amit Kumar, Lewys Jones, Sergey Lisenkov, Inna Ponomareva</i>
<p>Size-driven transition of an antiferroelectric into a polar ferroelectric or
ferrielectric state is a strongly debated issue from both experimental and
theoretical perspectives. While critical thickness limits for such transitions
have been explored, a bottom-up approach in the ultrathin limit considering few
atomic layers could provide insight into the mechanism of stabilization of the
polar phases over the antipolar phase seen in bulk PbZrO$_3$. Here, we use
first-principles density functional theory to predict the stability of polar
phases in Pt/PbZrO$_3$/Pt nanocapacitors. In a few atomic layer thick slabs of
PbZrO$_3$ sandwiched between Pt electrodes, we find that the polar phase
originating from the well established R3c phase of bulk PbZrO$_3$ is
energetically favorable over the antipolar phase originating from the Pbam
phase of bulk PbZrO$_3$. The famous triple-well potential of antiferroelectric
PbZrO$_3$ is modified in the nanocapacitor limit in such a way as to swap the
positions of the global and local minima, stabilizing the polar phase relative
to the antipolar one. The size effect is decomposed into the contributions from
dimensionality reduction, surface charge screening, and interfacial relaxation,
which reveals that it is the creation of well-compensated interfaces that
stabilizes the polar phases over the antipolar ones in nanoscale PbZrO$_3$.

<h3>Inclined junction in monolayer graphene: A gateway toward tailoring  valley polarization of Dirac fermions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14210" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14210</a>
<br>
<i>Shrushti Tapar, Bhaskaran Muralidharan</i>
<p>Generating discernible valley contrasts and segregating valley-indexed
fermions in real space within graphene poses considerable challenges due to the
isotropic transport within the continuum energy range for degenerate valleys.
This study unveils an interesting finding: introducing valley contrast through
anisotropic chiral transport in isotropic Dirac systems like graphene, achieved
by implementing a tilted PN junction. The tilted junction shifts the angular
spectrum to larger angles in accordance with the tilt angle. This modifies the
pseudospin-conserved modes across the junction, resulting in valley-resolved
chiral transport. This approach not only induces valley splitting within the
real space but also preserves the remarkable mobility of fermions, offering
distinct advantages over alternative strategies. The comprehensive analysis
includes optimizing the experimental setup, scrutinizing factors such as the
sequence of the doped region, and examining critical parameters like the tilt
angle delta and transition width d across the junction. Surprisingly, an
increased transition width enhances transmission, attributed to specular edge
scattering. Importantly, the system remains resilient to Anderson short-range
edge disorder. The broader implication lies in the transformative potential of
inducing analogous anisotropic chiral transport behaviors in isotropic Dirac
systems, resembling the characteristics of tilted Dirac-Weyl semimetals, by
incorporating a tilted PNJ.

<h3>On Gibbs Equilibrium and Hillert Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14231" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14231</a>
<br>
<i>Zi-Kui Liu</i>
<p>During his time at Royal Institute of Technology (Kungliga Tekniska
Hogskolan, KTH) in Sweden, the present author learned nonequilibrium
thermodynamics from Mats Hillert. The key concept is the separation of internal
and external variables of a system. In equilibrium thermodynamics derived by
Gibbs, the internal variables are not independent and can be fully evaluated
from given external variables. While irreversible thermodynamics led by Onsager
focuses on internal variables though often mixed with external variables.
Hillert integrated them together by first emphasizing their differences and
then examining their connections. His philosophy was reflected by the title of
his book "Phase Equilibria, Phase Diagrams and Phase Transformations" that puts
equilibrium, nonequilibrium, and internal processes on equal footing. In the
present paper honoring Hillert, the present author reflects his experiences
with Hillert in last 35 years and expresses his gratitude for all the wisdom
and support from him in terms of "Hillert nonequilibrium thermodynamics" and
discusses some recent topics that the present author has been working on.

<h3>Non-equilibrium theory of the linear viscoelasticity of glass and gel  forming liquids</h3>

<br>
<i>R. Peredo-Ortiz, O. Joaquín-Jaime, L. López-Flores, M. Medina-Noyola, L.F. Elizondo-Aguilera</i>
<p>We propose a first-principles theoretical approach for the description of the
aging of the linear viscoelastic properties of a colloidal liquid after a
sudden quench into a dynamically arrested (glass or gel) state. Specifically,
we couple a general expression for the time-evolving shear-stress relaxation
function $\eta(\tau;t)$ (whose $\tau$-integral is the instantaneous viscosity
$\eta(t)$), written in terms of the non-equilibrium structure factor $S(k;t)$
and intermediate scattering function $F(k,\tau;t)$, with the equations that
determine $S(k;t)$ and $F(k,\tau;t)$, provided by the non-equilibrium
self-consistent generalized Langevin equation (NE-SCGLE) theory. In this
manner, we obtain a closed theoretical scheme that directly connects
inter-particle forces with experimentally accessible rheological properties of
non-equilibrium amorphous states of matter. The predictive capability of the
resulting theoretical formalism is illustrated here with its concrete
application to the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) model of a soft-sphere fluid.

<h3>Irregular Bloch Zener oscillations in two-dimensional flat-band Dirac  materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14243" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14243</a>
<br>
<i>Li-Li Ye, Ying-Cheng Lai</i>
<p>When a static electrical field is applied to a two-dimensional (2D) Dirac
material, Landau-Zener transition (LZT) and Bloch-Zener oscillations can occur.
Employing alpha-T3 lattices as a paradigm for a broad class of 2D Dirac
materials, we uncover two phenomena. First, due to the arbitrarily small energy
gaps near a Dirac point that make it more likely for LZTs to occur than in
other regions of the Brillouin zone, the distribution of differential LZT
probability in the momentum space can form a complicated morphological pattern.
Second, a change in the LZT morphology as induced by a mutual switching of the
two distinct Dirac points can lead to irregular Bloch-Zener oscillations
characterized by a non-smooth behavior in the time evolution of the electrical
current density associated with the oscillation. These phenomena are due to
mixed interference of quantum states in multiple bands modulated by the
geometric and dynamic phases. We demonstrate that the adiabatic-impulse model
describing Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg interferometry can be exploited to
calculate the phases, due to the equivalence between the alpha-T3 lattice
subject to a constant electrical field and strongly periodically driven two- or
three-level systems. The degree of irregularity of Bloch-Zener oscillations can
be harnessed by selecting the morphology pattern, which is potentially
experimentally realizable.

<h3>Spin-dependent edge states in two-dimensional Dirac materials with a  flat band</h3>

<i>Li-Li Ye, Chen-Di Han, Ying-Cheng Lai</i>
<p>The phenomenon of spin-dependent quantum scattering in two-dimensional (2D)
pseudospin-1/2 Dirac materials leading to a relativistic quantum chimera was
recently uncovered. We investigate spin-dependent Dirac electron optics in 2D
pseudospin-1 Dirac materials, where the energy-band structure consists of a
pair of Dirac cones and a flat band. In particular, with a suitable combination
of external electric fields and a magnetic exchange field, electrons with a
specific spin orientation (e.g., spin-down) can be trapped in a class of
long-lived edge modes, generating resonant scattering. The spin-dependent edge
states are a unique feature of flat-band Dirac materials and have no classical
correspondence. However, electrons with the opposite spin (i.e., spin up)
undergo conventional quantum scattering with a classical correspondence, which
can be understood in the framework of Dirac electron optics. A consequence is
that the spin-down electrons produce a large scattering probability with broad
scattering angle distribution in both near- and far-field regions, while the
spin-up electrons display the opposite behavior. Such characteristically
different behaviors of the electrons with opposite spins lead to spin
polarization that can be as high as nearly 100%.

<h3>Unexpected versatile electrical transport behaviors of ferromagnetic  nickel films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14275" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14275</a>
<br>
<i>Kai-Xuan Zhang, Hanshu Xu, Jihoon Keum, Xiangqi Wang, Meizhuang Liu, Zuxin Chen</i>
<p>Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of magnets is paramount for
electrically controlled spintronics due to their intrinsic potentials for
higher memory density, scalability, thermal stability and endurance, surpassing
an in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). Nickel film is a long-lived fundamental
element ferromagnet, yet its electrical transport behavior associated with
magnetism has not been comprehensively studied, hindering corresponding
spintronic applications exploiting nickel-based compounds. Here, we
systematically investigate the highly versatile magnetism and corresponding
transport behavior of nickel films. As the thickness reduces within the general
thickness regime of a magnet layer for a memory device, the hardness of nickel
films' ferromagnetic loop of anomalous Hall effect increases and then
decreases, reflecting the magnetic transitions from IMA to PMA and back to IMA.
Additionally, the square ferromagnetic loop changes from a hard to a soft one
at rising temperatures, indicating a shift from PMA to IMA. Furthermore, we
observe a butterfly magnetoresistance resulting from the anisotropic
magnetoresistance effect, which evolves in conjunction with the thickness and
temperature-dependent magnetic transformations as a complementary support. Our
findings unveil the rich magnetic dynamics and most importantly settle down the
most useful guiding information for current-driven spintronic applications
based on nickel film: The hysteresis loop is squarest for the ~8 nm-thick
nickel film, of highest hardness with Rxyr/Rxys~1 and minimum Hs-Hc, up to 125
K; otherwise, extra care should be taken for a different thickness or at a
higher temperature.

<h3>Non-relativistic spin splitting in compensated magnets that are not  altermagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14321" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14321</a>
<br>
<i>Lin-Ding Yuan, Alexandru B. Georgescu, James M. Rondinelli</i>
<p>The non-relativistic spin-splitting (NRSS) of electronic bands in
"altermagnets" has sparked renewed interest in antiferromagnets (AFMs) that
have no net magnetization. However, altermagnets with collinear and compensated
magnetism are not the only type of NRSS AFMs. In this study, we identify the
symmetry conditions and characteristic signatures of a distinct group of NRSS
AFMs that go beyond the description of altermagnets. These compounds exhibit a
broken spin-degeneracy among the spin-polarized bands at the $\Gamma$ point in
the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We use density functional theory
calculations to validate these models in ternary magnetic nitrides,
specifically MnXN$_2$ (X = Si, Ge, Sn), and their cation ordered variants. By
removing the previous NRSS constraint on $\Gamma$, these compounds may
facilitate the generation of spin currents without cancellation arising from
the alternating spin polarizations. Our findings expand the scope of NRSS
eligible materials.

<br>
<i>Jaume Calvo-de la Rosa, Antoni García-Santiago, Joan Manel Hernàndez, Marc Vazquez-Aige, Jose Maria Lopez-Villegas, Javier Tejada</i>
<p>The present work reports experimental evidence of random magnetic behavior
observed in modified barium hexagonal ferrites. A significant transition in the
magnetic properties of this system is observed when divalent cations (Ni2+,
Cu2+, Mn2+) are introduced in the structure and give rise to a magnetic
nanocomposite. Such introduction takes place in a random manner throughout each
sample and creates the conditions for such materials to behave as random
magnets. We verify the occurrence of such behavior in our samples by fitting
the magnetization in approaching saturation to the corresponding theoretical
model. We therefore analyze the microwave absorption capacities of random
magnets in the GHz range and predict large and broad absorption signals under
certain conditions. The findings presented here postulate, for the first time,
ceramic materials as promising random magnets and underline their potential as
microwave absorbers, in good agreement with recent theoretical models.

<h3>Vibrational lifetimes and viscoelastic properties of ultrastable glasses</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14336" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14336</a>
<br>
<i>Jan Grießer, Lars Pastewka</i>
<p>Amorphous solids are viscoelastic. They dissipate energy when deformed at
finite rate and finite temperature. We here use analytic theory and molecular
simulations to demonstrate that linear viscoelastic dissipation can be directly
related to the static and dynamic properties of the fundamental vibrational
excitations of an amorphous system. We study ultrastable glasses that do not
age, i.e. that remain in stable minima of the potential energy surface at
finite temperature. Our simulations show four types of vibrational modes, which
differ in spatial localization, similarity to plane waves and vibrational
lifetimes. At frequencies below the Boson peak, the viscoelastic response can
be split into contributions from plane-wave and quasilocalized modes. We derive
a parameter-free expression for the viscoelastic storage and loss moduli for
both of these modes. Our results show that the dynamics of microscopic
dissipation, in particular the lifetimes of the modes, determine the
viscoelastic response only at high frequency. Quasilocalized modes dominate the
linear viscoelastic response at intermediate frequencies below the Boson peak.

<h3>Light-Metal Functionalized Boron Monoxide Monolayers as Efficient  Hydrogen Storage Material: Insights from DFT Simulations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14342" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14342</a>
<br>
<i>Wael Othman, Wadha Al Falasi, Tanveer Hussain, Nacir Tit</i>
<p>Exceptionally high energy density by mass, natural abundance, widespread
applications, and environmental friendliness make hydrogen (H2) a front-runner
among clean energy options. However, the transition toward clean and renewable
energy applications and the actualization of H2 economy require an efficient H2
storage medium. Material-based H2 storage is a viable option, as liquefaction
and storage under pressure require ultra-low temperature (-253{\deg}C) and
tremendously high pressure (700 atm), respectively. In this work, we highlight
the exceptional H2 storage capabilities of recently synthesized boron monoxide
(BO) monolayer functionalized with light metals (Li, Na, K, and Ca). Our
computational approach, employing density functional theory (DFT), ab initio
molecular dynamics (AIMD), and thermodynamic analysis, reveals promising
results. We found that up to four metal dopants (Li, Na, K, and Ca) can be
adsorbed onto BO monolayer with significantly strong binding energies.
Importantly, these bindings surpass the cohesive counterparts of the parental
metal bulks, consequently stabilizing the crystal integrities, as confirmed by
AIMD simulations. Each metal dopant on BO efficiently adsorbs multiple H2
molecules through electrostatic and van der Waals interactions. Interestingly,
the metal-functionalized BO monolayers exhibit exceptionally high H2
gravimetric capacities up to 11.75 wt%. These promising capacities exceed the
5.50 wt% target set by the US Department of Energy for 2025. Following the same
guidelines, the average binding energy per H2 molecule is within the range of
-0.17 to -0.32 eV. The adsorption and desorption of H2 under practical working
conditions are investigated by Langmuir adsorption model based statistical
thermodynamic analysis, further supporting the potential of
metal-functionalized BO monolayers for material-based H2 storage applications.

<h3>Efficient construction of the Feynman-Vernon influence functional as  matrix product states</h3>

<br>
<i>Chu Guo, Ruofan Chen</i>
<p>The time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method has become a very
competitive numerical method for studying the real-time dynamics of quantum
impurity problems. For small impurities, the most challenging calculation in
TEMPO is to construct the matrix product state representation of the
Feynman-Vernon influence functional. In this work we propose an efficient
method for this task, which exploits the time-translationally invariant
property of the influence functional. The required number of matrix product
state multiplication in our method is almost independent of the total evolution
time, as compared to the method originally used in TEMPO which requires a
linearly scaling number of multiplications. The accuracy and efficiency of this
method are demonstrated for the Toulouse model and the single impurity Anderson
model.

<h3>The Architecture of Sponge Choanocyte Chambers Maximizes Mechanical  Pumping Efficiency</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14364" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14364</a>
<br>
<i>Takumi Ogawa, Shuji Koyama, Toshihiro Omori, Kenji Kikuchi, Helene de Maleprade, Raymond E. Goldstein, Takuji Ishikawa</i>
<p>Sponges, the basalmost members of the animal kingdom, exhibit a range of
complex architectures in which microfluidic channels connect multitudes of
spherical chambers lined with choanocytes, flagellated filter-feeding cells.
Choanocyte chambers can possess scores or even hundreds of such cells, which
drive complex flows entering through porous walls and exiting into the sponge
channels. One of the mysteries of the choanocyte chamber is its spherical
shape, as it seems inappropriate for inducing directional transport since many
choanocyte flagella beat in opposition to such a flow. Here we combine direct
imaging of choanocyte chambers in living sponges with computational studies of
many-flagella models to understand the connection between chamber architecture
and directional flow. We find that those flagella that beat against the flow
play a key role in raising the pressure inside the choanocyte chamber, with the
result that the mechanical pumping efficiency, calculated from the pressure
rise and flow rate, reaches a maximum at a small outlet opening angle.
Comparison between experimental observations and the results of numerical
simulations reveal that the chamber diameter, flagellar wave number and the
outlet opening angle of the freshwater sponge $E. muelleri$, as well as several
other species, are related in a manner that maximizes the mechanical pumping
efficiency. These results indicate the subtle balances at play during
morphogenesis of choanocyte chambers, and give insights into the physiology and
body design of sponges.

<h3>Exact non-Hermitian mobility edges and robust flat bands in  two-dimensional Lieb lattices with imaginary quasiperiodic potentials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14370" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14370</a>
<br>
<i>Xiang-Ping Jiang, Weilei Zeng, Yayun Hu, Peng Liu</i>
<p>The mobility edge (ME) is a critical energy delineates the boundary between
extended and localized states within the energy spectrum, and it plays a
crucial role in understanding the metal-insulator transition in disordered or
quasiperiodic systems. While there have been extensive studies on MEs in
one-dimensional non-Hermitian (NH) quasiperiodic lattices recently, the
investigation of exact NH MEs in two-dimensional (2D) cases remains rare. In
the present study, we introduce a 2D dissipative Lieb lattice (DLL) model with
imaginary quasiperiodic potentials applied solely to the vertices of the Lieb
lattice. By mapping this DLL model to the 2D NH Aubry-Andr{\'e}-Harper (AAH)
model, we analytically derive the exact ME and find it associated with the
absolute eigenenergies. We find that the eigenvalues of extended states are
purely imaginary when the quasiperiodic potential is strong enough.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the introduction of imaginary quasiperiodic
potentials does not disrupt the flat bands inherent in the system. Finally, we
propose a theoretical framework for realizing our model using the Lindblad
master equation. Our results pave the way for further investigation of exact NH
MEs and flat bands in 2D dissipative quasiperiodic systems.

<h3>Uniform large-area surface patterning achieved by metal dewetting for  the top-down fabrication of GaN nanowire ensembles</h3>

<i>Jingxuan Kang, Rose-Mary Jose, Miriam Oliva, Thomas Auzelle, Mikel Gómez Ruiz, Abbes Tahraoui, Jonas Lähnemann, Oliver Brandt, Lutz Geelhaar</i>
<p>The dewetting of thin Pt films on different surfaces is investigated as a
means to provide the patterning for the top-down fabrication of GaN nanowire
ensembles. The transformation from a thin film to an ensemble of nanoislands
upon annealing proceeds in good agreement with the void growth model. With
increasing annealing duration, the size and shape uniformity of the nanoislands
improves. This improvement speeds up for higher annealing temperature. After an
optimum annealing duration, the size uniformity deteriorates due to the
coalescence of neighboring islands. By changing the Pt film thickness, the
nanoisland diameter and density can be quantitatively controlled in a way
predicted by a simple thermodynamic model. We demonstrate the uniformity of the
nanoisland ensembles for an area larger than 1 cm$^2$. GaN nanowires are
fabricated by a sequence of dry and wet etching steps, and these nanowires
inherit the diameters and density of the Pt nanoisland ensemble used as a mask.
Our study achieves advancements in size uniformity and range of obtainable
diameters compared to previous works. This simple, economical, and scalable
approach to the top-down fabrication of nanowires is useful for applications
requiring large and uniform nanowire ensembles with controllable dimensions.

<i>Marcel Reutzel, G. S. Matthijs Jansen, Stefan Mathias</i>
<p>Excitons -- two-particle correlated electron-hole pairs -- are the dominant
low-energy optical excitation in the broad class of semiconductor materials,
which range from classical silicon to perovskites, and from two-dimensional to
organic materials. Recently, the study of excitons has been brought on a new
level of detail by the application of photoemission momentum microscopy -- a
technique that has dramatically extended the experimental capabilities of time-
and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES). Here, we review how
the energy- and momentum-resolved photoelectron detection scheme enables direct
access to the energy landscape of bright and dark excitons, and, more
generally, to the momentum-coordinate of the exciton that is fundamental to its
wavefunction. Focusing on two-dimensional materials and organic semiconductors
as two tuneable platforms for exciton physics, we first discuss the typical
photoemission fingerprint of excitons in momentum microscopy and highlight that
is is possible to obtain information not only on the electron- but also
hole-component of the former exciton. Second, we focus on the recent
application of photoemission orbital tomography to such excitons, and discuss
how this provides a unique access to the real-space properties of the exciton
wavefunction. Throughout the review, we detail how studies performed on
two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides and organic semiconductors
lead to very similar conclusions, and, in this manner, highlight the strength
of time-resolved momentum microscopy for the study of optical excitations in
semiconductors.

<p>Gd2GaSbO7 and Gd2InSbO7 pyrochlore compounds have exhibited spin ice
behavior. These compounds have not been reported adequately based on the
concept of magnetic frustration. Here we have synthesized and characterized
Gd2GaSbO7 and Gd2InSbO7 to study the ground state magnetic properties. We
confirmed the cubic pyrochlore structure via X-ray powder diffraction. Magnetic
and heat capacity measurements show an absence of magnetic order down to 400
mK. Interestingly, the low-temperature magnetic heat capacity exhibited a broad
maximum around Tmax = 0.9 K for Gd2GaSbO7 and Tmax = 1 K for Gd2InSbO7,
suggesting the presence of spin fluctuations and followed the T^1.71 and T^1.49
dependence for Gd2GaSbO7 and Gd2InSbO7. We scale the ratio between
nearest-neighbor exchange and dipolar interaction of all the reported Gd-based
pyrochlores. Where Gd2InSbO7 has the lowest and weaker exchange interaction of
all among others. It states that chemical pressure has an impact on exchange
interaction due to different pathways of mediators between magnetic ions. This
study reveals the robust spin ice behavior in the ground state like Dy2Ti2O7
and Ho2Ti2O7. It is in stark contrast with other Gd-Pyrochlore compounds that
hold the long-range magnetic order.

<p>A series of tetragonal Fe$_{1-x}$Co${_x}$Se single crystals with a complete
Co doping range (0$\leq$x$\leq$0.52) up to its solid solubility limit in FeSe
have been grown by an eutectic AlCl${_3}$/KCl molten salt method. The typical

chemical composition and homogeneity of the crystals was examined by both
inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and energy dispersive
spectrometer. X-ray diffraction analysis demonstrates that the crystal lattice
parameters $a$ and $c$ are both linearly decreased with increasing Co doping
level x. In the whole doping range, all the samples show metallic behaviour in

<p>Understanding and mastering the control of surface states in topological
materials are crucial steps for the development of future electronic devices
and technologies that leverage the unique properties of these materials. Here,
using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we provide a good case study
of this by visualizing the electronic structure of a magnetic Weyl semimetal on
both flat and uneven surfaces. Our observations reveal that the preparation of
an uneven sample surface can effectively suppress all surface states in the
Weyl semimetal NdAlSi, including topological surface Fermi arcs. This results
in the observation of pure bulk states devoid of any Fermi energy shift. This
discovery not only opens up a new avenue to directly study the pure bulk states
of a Weyl semimetal using low photon energies in ARPES but also provides key
insights into the control of the surface states in topological materials.

<p>Extensive efforts have been undertaken to combine superconductivity and the
quantum Hall effect so that Cooper-pair transport between superconducting
electrodes in Josephson junctions is mediated by one-dimensional (1D) edge
states. This interest has been motivated by prospects of finding new physics,
including topologically-protected quasiparticles, but also extends into
metrology and device applications. So far it has proven challenging to achieve
detectable supercurrents through quantum Hall conductors. Here we show that
domain walls in minimally twisted bilayer graphene support exceptionally robust
proximity superconductivity in the quantum Hall regime, allowing Josephson
junctions operational in fields close to the upper critical field of
superconducting electrodes. The critical current is found to be
non-oscillatory, practically unchanging over the entire range of quantizing
fields, with its value being limited by the quantum conductance of ballistic
strictly-1D electronic channels residing within the domain walls. The described
system is unique in its ability to support Andreev bound states in high fields
and offers many interesting directions for further exploration.

addition, this model unravels a surprising dichotomy between MO coupling to

<p>In a magnetic skyrmion phase, magnetic moments form vortex-like topological
textures which are of both fundamental and industrial interests. In
$\beta$-Mn-type Co-Zn-Mn alloys, chrial magnetic skyrmions emerge above room
temperature, providing a unique system for studying the skrymion physics and
exploring spintronics applications. However, the magnetic skyrmion phase is
typically confined in a narrow and limited temperature ($T$) and magnetic field
($H$) range. Here, we demonstrate that hydrostatic pressure can expand the
skyrmion phase in the $T-H$ phase diagram of single-crystalline
Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$. At ambient pressure, signatures of skyrmions are seen
within $T\sim302-308$ K and $H\sim50-100$ Oe. Applying a moderate pressure of 6
kbar extends this range to $T\sim300-310$ K and $H\sim50-150$ Oe. However,
further escalation of pressure to 10 kbar results in a slight contraction of
the skyrmion phase. These findings underscore the sensitivity of the skyrmion
phase in Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$ to external pressures, and hint at the potential of
strain engineering, particularly in $\beta$-Mn-type Co-Zn-Mn thin films, as a
promising avenue to customize the skyrmion phase.

<i>Yun Yen, Gian Parusa, Michael Schüler</i>
<p>Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is one of the most powerful
techniques to study the electronic structure of materials. To go beyond the
paradigm of band mapping and extract aspects of the Bloch wave-functions, the
intricate interplay of experimental geometry, crystal structure, and photon
polarization needs to be understood. In this work we discuss several model
approaches to computing ARPES signals in a unified fashion. While we represent
the Bloch wave-functions by first-principle Wannier functions, we introduce
different approximations to the final states and discuss the implications for
the predictive power. We also introduce various light-matter gauges and explain
the role of the inevitable breaking of gauge invariance.Finally, we benchmark
the different models for the two-dimensional semiconductor WSe$_2$, known for
its strong Berry curvature, orbital angular momentum (OAM), and nontrivial
orbital texture. The models are compared based on their ability to simulate
photoemission intensity and interpret circular dichroism in ARPES (CD-ARPES).
We show that interference effects are crucial to understanding the circular
dichroism, and explain their photon-energy dependence. Our in-depth analysis
provides insights into the advantages and limitations of various model
approaches in clarifying the complex interplay between experimental observables
and underlying orbital texture in materials.

<p>Accurate and scalable universal interatomic potentials are key for
understanding material properties at the atomic level, a task often hindered by
the steep computational scaling. Although recent developments of machine
learning potential has made significant progress, the flexibility and expansion
to a wide range of compounds within a single model seems still challenging to
build in particular for the kernel-based models. Here, we introduce the
Bayesian Committee Machine (BCM) potential to handle a wide array of
hydrocarbons in various phases (gas, clusters, liquid, and solid). The BCM
potential leverages the committee approach to bypass the poor scaling of kernel
regressors when dealing with large datasets. Its committee-based structure
allows for easy and cost-effective expansion, maintaining both transferrability
and scalability. Demonstrating its robustness, the BCM accurately models
challenging examples like the Diels-Alder reaction, structural strains, and
pi-pi interactions. Our systematic benchmarking positions the sparse BCM
potential as a promising candidate in the quest for a universal ab initio
machine learning potential.

<p>Ferroelectric materials display exotic polarization textures at the nanoscale
that could be used to improve the energetic efficiency of electronic
components. The vast majority of studies were conducted in two dimensions on
thin films, that can be further nanostructured, but very few studies address
the situation of individual isolated nanocrystals synthesized in solution,
while such structures could open other field of applications. In this work, we
experimentally and theoretically studied the polarization texture of
ferroelectric barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$, BTO) nanocrystals (NC) attached to a
conductive substrate and surrounded by air. We synthesized NC of well defined
quasi-cubic shape and 160 nm average size, that conserve the tetragonal
structure of BTO at room temperature.
We then investigated the inverse piezoelectric properties of such pristine
individual NC by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), taking particular care
of suppressing electrostatic artifacts. In all the NC studied, we could not
detect any vertical PFM signal, and the maps of the lateral response all
displayed larger displacements on the edges. Using field-phase simulations
dedicated to ferroelectric nanostructures, we were able to predict the
equilibrium polarization texture. These simulations revealed that the NC core
is composed of 180{\deg} up and down domains defining the polar axis, that
rotate by 90{\deg} in the two facets orthogonal to this axis, eventually lying
within these planes forming a layer of about 10 nm thickness mainly composed of
180{\deg} domains along an edge. From this polarization distribution we
predicted the lateral PFM response, that revealed to be in very good
qualitative agreement with the experimental observations. This work positions
PFM as a relevant tool to evaluate the potential of complex ferroelectric
nanostructures to be used as sensors.

<p>The bulk boundary correspondence in the context of Weyl semimetals is a
fundamental topological principle that establishes a connection between the
bulk properties of the material and the emergence of specific surface states.
In Weyl semimetals, the bulk boundary correspondence is manifested by the
presence of surface Fermi arcs connecting pairs of Weyl nodes with opposite
chirality. Here we demonstrate that this bulk boundary correspondence is
challenged in the case of the surface selectively reconstructed
noncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal NdAlSi. By comparing angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy measurements with surface projected density
functional theory calculations and scanning tunneling microscope measurements,
the existence of surface selective spontaneous reconstruction is demonstrated.
The surface reconstruction in NdAlSi not only leads to the reconstruction of
the surface Fermi arcs, but also generates new surface Fermi arcs that do not
connect corresponding Weyl nodes. This observation challenges the conventional
view of the bulk boundary correspondence in Weyl semimetals.

<i>Dominick S. Scaletta, Albert F. Rigosi</i>
<p>A previous mathematical approach adopted for optimizing the number of total
device elements required for obtaining high effective quantized resistances in
graphene-based quantum Hall array devices (QHARS) has been further explored
with partial recursion patterns. Designs would assume the use of epitaxial
graphene elements, whose quantized Hall resistance at the {\nu}=2 plateau (R_H
\approx 12906.4 \Ohm) becomes the building block for larger effective,
quantized resistances. Auxiliary calculations suggest the importance of
applying full recursions at least once to maximize the reduction of total QHARS
elements needed for high resistances.

<p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials have gained increasing prominence not only in
fundamental research but also in daily applications. However, to fully harness
their potential, it is crucial to optimize their properties with an external
parameter and track the electronic structure simultaneously. Magnetotransport
over a wide magnetic field range is a powerful method to probe the electronic
structure and, for metallic 2D materials, quantum oscillations superimposed on
the transport signals encode Fermi surface parameters. In this manuscript, we
utilize biaxial strain as an external tuning parameter and investigate the
effects of strain on the electronic properties of two quasi-2D superconductors,
MoTe$_2$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$, by measuring their magnetoresistance in pulsed
magnetic fields up to 60 T. With a careful selection of insulating substrates,
we demonstrate the possibility of both the compressive and tensile biaxial
strain, imposed on MoTe$_2$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$, respectively. For both systems,
the applied strain has led to superconducting critical temperature enhancement
compared to their free-standing counterparts, proving the effectiveness of this
biaxial strain method at cryogenic temperatures. Clear quantum oscillations in
the magnetoresistance -- the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) effect -- are obtained in
both samples. In strained MoTe$_2$, the magnetoresistance exhibits a nearly
quadratic dependence on the magnetic field and remains non-saturating even at
the highest field. Whereas in strained RbV$_3$Sb$_5$, two SdH frequencies
showed a substantial enhancement in effective mass values, hinting at a
possible enhancement of charge fluctuations. Our results demonstrate that
combining biaxial strain and pulsed magnetic field paves the way for studying
2D materials under unprecedented conditions.

<h3>Unraveling the origin of antiferromagnetic coupling at YIG/permalloy  interface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14553" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14553</a>
<br>
<i>Jiangchao Qian, Yi Li, Zhihao Jiang, Robert Busch, Hsu-Chih Ni, Tzu-Hsiang Lo, Axel Hoffmann, Andre Schleife, Jian-Min Zuo</i>
<p>We investigate the structural and electronic origin of antiferromagnetic
coupling in the Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and permalloy (Py) bilayer system at
the atomic level. Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) reveal unique hybrid modes in
samples prepared with surface ion milling, indicative of antiferromagnetic
exchange coupling at the YIG/Py interface. Using scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM), we highlight significant interfacial differences introduced
by ion-milling. The observations suggests that the antiferromagnetic coupling
in YIG/Py bilayers is predominantly driven by an oxygen-mediated super-exchange
coupling mechanism on the tetrahedral Fe terminated YIG surface, which is
supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This research
provides critical insight into the fundamental mechanisms governing the
efficiency of coupling in magnetic bilayers and underscores the pivotal role of
oxide surface termination in modulating magnetic interfacial dynamics.

<i>Ruby A. Shi, Bai Yang Wang, Yusuke Iguchi, Motoki Osada, Kyuho Lee, Berit H. Goodge, Lena F. Kourkoutis, Harold Y. Hwang, Kathryn A. Moler</i>
<p>Infinite-layer nickelates $R_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$NiO$_{2}$ ($R$ = La, Pr, Nd) are a
class of superconductors with structural similarities to cuprates. Although
long-range antiferromagnetic order has not been observed for these materials,
magnetic effects such as antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations and spin-glass
behavior have been reported. Different experiments have drawn different
conclusions about whether the pairing symmetry is $s$- or $d$ wave. In this
paper, we applied a scanning superconducting quantum interference device
(SQUID) to probe the magnetic behavior of film samples of three infinite-layer
nickelates (La$_{0.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$NiO$_2$, Pr$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$, and
Nd$_{0.775}$Sr$_{0.225}$NiO$_2$) grown on SrTiO$_3$ (STO), each with a nominal
thickness of 20 unit cells. In all three films, we observed a ferromagnetic
background. We also measured the magnetic susceptibility above the
superconducting critical temperature in Pr$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ and
La$_{0.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$NiO$_2$ and identified a non-Curie-Weiss dynamic
susceptibility. Both magnetic features are likely due to NiO$_x$ nanoparticles.
Additionally, we investigated superconductivity in Pr$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$
and Nd$_{0.775}$Sr$_{0.225}$NiO$_2$, which exhibited inhomogeneous diamagnetic
screening. The superfluid density inferred from the diamagnetic susceptibility
in relatively homogeneous regions shows $T$-linear behavior in both samples.
Finally, we observed superconducting vortices in
Nd$_{0.775}$Sr$_{0.225}$NiO$_2$. We determined a Pearl length of 330 $\upmu$m
for Nd$_{0.775}$Sr$_{0.225}$NiO$_2$ at 300 mK both from the strength of the
diamagnetism and from the size and shape of the vortices. These results
highlight the importance of considering NiO$_x$ particles when interpreting
experimental results for these films.

<h3>Impact of Magnon Interactions on Transport in Honeycomb Antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14572" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14572</a>
<br>
<i>Konstantinos Sourounis, Aurélien Manchon</i>
<p>The thermal transport of magnons has attracted substantial attention as an
energy-efficient alternative to the transport of electrons. Most theoretical
studies so far have been carried out within the frame of the linear spin-wave
theory, which dramatically fails upon increasing the temperature and in the
presence of competing interactions. In this work, we consider the impact of
three- and four-magnon interactions in a honeycomb antiferromagnet, where such
interactions are remarkably strong even at zero temperature. Using a
combination of quantum field theory and mean-field theory, we compute the band
structure of the interacting magnons and investigate the spin Nernst effect. We
find that in the presence of in-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction, the
three-magnon interaction induces a non-reciprocal band splitting, even at zero
temperature, leading to an enhancement of the spin Nernst conductivity. In
contrast, the four-magnon interaction renormalizes the magnon spectrum at high
temperatures, leading to a reduction of the overall magnon spin Nernst effect.
These results suggest that interactions can massively influence the transport
properties of magnons in antiferromagnets, even at zero temperature, and should
be taken into account for predictive modeling.

<p>Motivated by advances in spintronic devices, an extensive exploration is
underway to uncover materials that host topologically protected spin textures,
exemplified by skyrmions. One critical challenge involved in the potential
application of skyrmions in van der Waals (vdW) materials is the attainment and
manipulation of skyrmions at room temperature. In this study, we report the
creation of intrinsic skyrmion state in van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2. By
employing variable temperature magnetic force microscopy, the skyrmion lattice
can be locally manipulated on Fe3GaTe2 flake. The ordering of skyrmion state is
further analyzed. Our result suggest Fe3GaTe2 emerges as a highly promising
contender for the realization of skyrmion-based layered spintronic memory
devices.

<h3>Spin-dependent interactions in orbital-density-dependent functionals:  non-collinear Koopmans spectral functionals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14575" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14575</a>
<br>
<i>Antimo Marrazzo, Nicola Colonna</i>
<p>The presence of spin-orbit coupling or non-collinear magnetic spin states can
have dramatic effects on the ground-state and spectral properties of materials,
in particular on the band structure. Here, we develop non-collinear
Koopmans-compliant functionals based on Wannier functions and
density-functional perturbation theory, targeting accurate spectral properties
in the quasiparticle approximation. Our non-collinear Koopmans-compliant theory
involves functionals of four-component orbitals densities, that can be obtained
from the charge and spin-vector densities of Wannier functions. We validate our
approach on three emblematic and diverse semiconductors where the effect of
spin-orbit coupling goes from small to very large: the III-IV semiconductor
GaAs, the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$, and the cubic perovskite
CsPbBr$_3$. The predicted band gaps are comparable in accuracy to
state-of-the-art many-body perturbation theory and include spin-dependent
interactions and screening effects that are missing in standard diagrammatic
approaches based on the random phase approximation. While the inclusion of
orbital- and spin-dependent interactions in many-body perturbation theory
requires self-screening or vertex corrections, that emerges naturally in the
Koopmans-functionals framework.

<h3>Small electron polarons bound to interstitial tantalum defects in  lithium tantalate</h3>

<br>
<i>Anton Pfannstiel, Tobias Hehemann, Nils A. Schäfer, Simone Sanna, Yuriy Suhak, Laura Vittadello, Felix Sauerwein, Niklas Dömer, Julian Koelmann, Holger Fritze, Mirco Imlau</i>
<p>The absorption features of optically generated, short-lived small bound
electron polarons are inspected in congruent lithium tantalate, LiTaO$_3$ (LT),
in order to address the question whether it is possible to localize electrons
at interstitial Ta$_{\rm V}$:V$_{\rm Li}$ defect pairs by strong, short-range
electron-phonon coupling. Solid-state photoabsorption spectroscopy under light
exposure and density functional theory are used for an experimental and
theoretical access to the spectral features of small bound polaron states and
to calculate the binding energies of the small bound Ta$_{\rm Li}^{4+}$
(antisite) and Ta$_{\rm V}^{4+}$:V$_{\rm Li}$ (interstitial site) electron
polarons. As a result, two energetically well separated ($\Delta E \approx 0.5$
eV) absorption features with a distinct dependence on the probe light
polarization and peaking at 1.6 eV and 2.1 eV are discovered. We contrast our
results to the interpretation of a single small bound Ta$_{\rm Li}^{4+}$
electron state with strong anisotropy of the lattice distortion and discuss the
optical generation of interstitial Ta$_{\rm V}^{4+}$:V$_{\rm Li}$ small
polarons in the framework of optical gating of Ta$_{\rm V}^{4+}$:Ta$_{\rm
Ta}^{4+}$ bipolarons. We can conclude that the appearance of carrier
localization at Ta$_{\rm V}$:V$_{\rm Li}$ must be considered as additional
intermediate state for the 3D hopping transport mechanisms at room temperature
in addition to Ta$_{\rm Li}$, as well, and, thus, impacts a variety of optical,
photoelectrical and electrical applications of LT in nonlinear photonics.
Furthermore, it is envisaged that LT represents a promising model system for
the further examination of the small-polaron based photogalvanic effect in
polar oxides with the unique feature of two, energetically well separated small
polaron states.

<h3>Observation of the antiferromagnetic phase transition in the fermionic  Hubbard model</h3>

<p>The fermionic Hubbard model (FHM)[1], despite its simple form, captures
essential features of strongly correlated electron physics. Ultracold fermions
in optical lattices[2, 3] provide a clean and well-controlled platform for
simulating FHM. Doping its antiferromagnetic ground state at half filling,
various exotic phases are expected to arise in the FHM simulator, including
stripe order[4], pseudogap[5], and d-wave superconductors[6], offering valuable
insights into high-temperature superconductivity[7{9]. Although notable
progress, such as the observation of antiferromagnetic correlations over
short[10] and extended distances[11], has been obtained, the antiferromagnetic
phase has yet to be realized due to the significant challenges of achieving low
temperatures in a large and uniform quantum simulator. Here, we report the
observation of the antiferromagnetic phase transition in a three-dimensional
fermionic Hubbard system comprising lithium-6 atoms in a uniform optical
lattice with approximately 800,000 sites. When the interaction strength,
temperature, and doping concentration are finely tuned to approach their
respective critical values, sharp increases in the spin structure factor (SSF)
are observed. These observations can be well described by a power-law
divergence, with a critical exponent of 1.396 from the Heisenberg universality
class[12]. At half filling and with optimal interaction strength, the measured
SSF reaches 123(8), signifying the establishment of an antiferromagnetic phase.
Our results set the stage for exploring the low-temperature phase diagram of
FHM.

<h3>On the origin of the above-room-temperature magnetism in the 2D van der  Waals ferromagnet Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$</h3>

<br>
<i>Alberto M. Ruiz, Dorye L. Esteras, Diego López-Alcalá, José J. Baldoví</i>
<p>Recent advancements in 2D magnetic materials have attracted a growing
interest driven by their unique properties and potential applications in
spintronic devices. However, the scarcity of systems that exhibit magnetism at
room-temperature has limited their practical implementation into functional
devices. In this work we focus on the recently synthetised van der Waals (vdW)
ferromagnet Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$, which exhibits above-room-temperature magnetism
(T$_{\mathrm{c}}$ = 350-380 K) and strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.
Through first-principles calculations, we examine the magnetic properties of
Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ and compare them with the widely known Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$
ferromagnet. Our calculations unveil the complex microscopic mechanisms
governing their magnetic behaviour, emphasizing the pivotal role of the
ferromagnetic in-plane exchange interactions in the stabilization of the
elevated T$_{\mathrm{c}}$ in Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$. Additionally, we predict the
stability, strong perpendicular anisotropy and high T$_{\mathrm{c}}$ of
single-layer Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$. We also demonstrate the potential of strain
engineering and electrostatic doping to modulate its magnetic exchange
interactions and anisotropy. Our results incentivise the isolation of the
monolayer and pave the way for the future optimization of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ in
magnetic and spintronic nanodevices.

<h3>Tunable transport in bi-disperse porous materials with vascular  structure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14628" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14628</a>
<br>
<i>Olivier Vincent, Théo Tassin, Erik J. Huber, Abraham D. Stroock</i>
<p>We study transport in synthetic, bi-disperse porous structures, with arrays
of microchannels interconnected by a nanoporous layer. These structures are
inspired by the xylem tissue in vascular plants, in which sap water travels
from the roots to the leaves to maintain hydration and carry micronutrients. We
experimentally evaluate transport in three conditions: high pressure-driven
flow, spontaneous imbibition, and transpiration-driven flow. The latter case
resembles the situation in a living plant, where bulk liquid water is
transported upwards in a metastable state (negative pressure), driven by
evaporation in the leaves; here we report stable, transpiration-driven flows
down to $\sim -15$ MPa of driving force. By varying the shape of the
microchannels, we show that we can tune the rate of these transport processes
in a predictable manner, using a simple analytical (effective medium) approach
and numerical simulations of the flow field in the bi-disperse media. We also
show that the spontaneous imbibition behavior of a single structure - with
fixed geometry - can behave very differently depending on its preparation
(filled with air, vs. evacuated), because of a dramatic change in the
conductance of vapor in the microchannels; this change offers a second way to
tune the rate of transport in bi-disperse, xylem-like structures, by switching
between air-filled and evacuated states.

<h3>Temporal Talbot interferometer of strongly interacting molecular  Bose-Einstein condensate</h3>

<i>Fansu Wei, Zhengxi Zhang, Yuying Chen, Hongmian Shui, Yun Liang, Chen Li, Xiaoji Zhou</i>
<p>Talbot interferometer, as a periodic reproduction of momentum distribution in
the time domain, finds significant applications in multiple research. The
inter-particle interactions during the diffraction and interference process
introduce numerous many-body physics problems, leading to unconventional
interference characteristics. This work investigates both experimentally and
theoretically the influence of interaction in a Talbot interferometer with a
$^{6}\rm Li_2$ molecular Bose-Einstein condensate in a one-dimensional optical
lattice, with interaction strength directly tunable via magnetic Feshbach
resonance. A clear dependence of the period and amplitude of signal revivals on
the interaction strength can be observed. While interactions increase the decay
rate of the signal and advance the revivals, we find that over a wide range of
interactions, the Talbot interferometer remains highly effective over a certain
evolutionary timescale, including the case of fractional Talbot interference.
This work provides insight into the interplay between interaction and the
coherence properties of a temporal Talbot interference in optical lattices,
paving the way for research into quantum interference in strongly interacting
systems.

<br>
<i>Tilman Richter, Paolo Malgaretti, Thomas M. Koller, Jens Harting</i>
<p>Catalyst particles or complexes suspended in liquid films can trigger
chemical reactions leading to inhomogeneous concentrations of reactants and
products in the film. We demonstrate that the sensitivity of the liquid film's
gas-liquid surface tension to these inhomogeneous concentrations strongly
impacts the film stability. Using linear stability analysis, we identify novel
scenarios in which the film can be either stabilized or destabilized by the
reactions. Furthermore, we find so far unrevealed rupture mechanisms which are
absent in the chemically inactive case. The linear stability predictions are
confirmed by numerical simulations, which also demonstrate that the shape of
chemically active droplets can depart from the spherical cap and that unsteady
states such as traveling and standing waves might appear. Finally, we
critically discuss the relevance of our predictions by showing that the range
of our selected parameters is well accessible by typical experiments.

<br>
<i>Alexander Gorfer, Rainer Abart, Christoph Dellago</i>
<p>The diffusive phase transformations occurring in feldspar, a common mineral
in the crust of the Earth, are essential for reconstructing the thermal
histories of magmatic and metamorphic rocks. Due to the long timescales over
which these transformations proceed, the mechanism responsible for sodium
diffusion and its possible anisotropy has remained a topic of debate. To
elucidate this defect-controlled process, we have developed a Neural Network
Potential (NNP) trained on first-principle calculations of Na-feldspar (Albite)
and its charged defects. This new force field reproduces various experimentally
known properties of feldspar, including its lattice parameters, elastic
constants as well as heat capacity and DFT-calculated defect formation
energies. A new type of dumbbell interstitial defect is found to be most
favorable and its free energy of formation at finite temperature is calculated
using thermodynamic integration. The necessity of including electrostatic
corrections before training an NNP is demonstrated by predicting more
consistent defect formation energies.

<p>Thermoelectric films and periodic structures have particularly intriguing
electrical and thermal transport features due to their low dimensionality. As a
result, they have piqued the attention of researchers from across the spectrum
of disciplines. Their applications span from cooling fast CPUs to providing
energy for wearable devices. The progress in the techniques for synthesizing TE
materials and fabricating thin films has facilitated the emergence of a
flourishing research domain in the field of electrical and thermal transport at
the nanoscale. Further, a significant proportion of contemporary electronic,
opto-electronic, and solar energy components are composed of materials
featuring numerous interfaces and nanoscale contacts. Consequently, it is
imperative to explore the thermal energy transfer and charge carrier transport
across the films with thickness dimensions in the nanometer range. The
development of cutting-edge approaches for grasping complicated processes at
the nanoscale is critical. This review provides a concise overview of the
prevalent methodologies developed over the last two decades and employed for
the characterization of the Seebeck coefficient and electrical and thermal

<br>
<i>Giorgio De Simoni, Francesco Giazotto</i>
<p>We suggest using a device called the Bootstrap Superconducting Quantum
Interference Device (BS-SQUID) to break the reciprocity in charge transport.
This device uses magnetic flux back-action to create a nonreciprocal
current-voltage characteristic, which results in a supercurrent rectification
coefficient of up to approximately 95\%. The BS-SQUID works as a quasi-ideal
supercurrent diode (SD) and maintains its efficiency up to about 40\% of its
critical temperature. The external magnetic flux can be used to adjust or
reverse the rectification polarity. Finally, we discuss the finite-voltage
operation regime of the SD and present a possible application of our device as
a half- and full-wave signal rectifier in the microwave regime.

<i>Guoling Yin, Chi-Kin Lai, Nana Chang, Yi Liang, Dekai Mao, Xiaoji Zhou</i>
<p>Advancements in the experimental toolbox of cold atoms have enabled the
meticulous control of atomic Bloch oscillation within optical lattices, thereby
enhancing the capabilities of gravity interferometers. This work delves into
the impact of thermal effects on Bloch oscillation in 1D accelerated optical
lattices aligned with gravity by varying the system's initial temperature.
Through the application of Raman cooling, we effectively reduce the
longitudinal thermal effect, stabilizing the longitudinal coherence length over
the timescale of its lifetime. The atomic losses over multiple Bloch
oscillation is measured, which are primarily attributed to transverse
excitation. Furthermore, we identify two distinct inverse scaling behaviors in
the oscillation lifetime scaled by the corresponding density with respect to
temperatures, implying diverse equilibrium processes within or outside the
Bose-Einstein condensate regime. The competition between the system's coherence
and atomic density leads to a relatively smooth variation in the actual
lifetime versus temperature. Our findings provide valuable insights into the
interaction between thermal effects and Bloch oscillation, offering avenues for
the refinement of quantum measurement technologies.

<p>Artificial monopoles have been engineered in various systems, yet there has
been no systematic study on the singular vector potentials associated with the
monopole field. We show that the Dirac string, the line singularity of the
vector potential, can be engineered, manipulated, and made manifest in a spinor
atomic condensate. We elucidate the connection among spin, orbital degrees of
freedom, and the artificial gauge, and reveal that there exists a mapping
between the vortex filament and the Dirac string. We also devise a proposal
where preparing initial spin states with relevant symmetries can result in
different vortex patterns, revealing an underlying correspondence between the
internal spin states and the spherical vortex structures. Such a mapping also
leads to a new way of constructing monopole harmonics. Our observation provides
significant insights in quantum matter possessing internal symmetries in curved
spaces.

<i>Amin Barzegar, Firas Hamze, Christopher Amey, Jonathan Machta</i>
<p>Annealing algorithms such as simulated annealing and population annealing are
widely used both for sampling the Gibbs distribution and solving optimization
problems (i.e. finding ground states). For both statistical mechanics and
optimization, additional parameters beyond temperature are often needed such as
chemical potentials, external fields or Lagrange multipliers enforcing
constraints. In this paper we derive a formalism for optimal annealing
schedules in multidimensional parameter spaces using methods from
non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. The results are closely related to work
on optimal control of thermodynamic systems [Sivak and Crooks, PRL 108, 190602
(2012)]. Within the formalism, we compare the efficiency of population
annealing and multiple weighted runs of simulated annealing ("annealed
importance sampling") and discuss the effects of non-ergodicity on both
algorithms. Theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations of spin
glasses.

<i>R. K. P. Zia</i>
<p>The evolution of physical systems are often modeled by simple Markovian
processes. When settled into stationary states, the probability distributions
of such systems are time independent, by definition. However, they do not
necessarily fall within the framework of equilibrium statistical mechanics.
Instead, they may be non-equilibrium steady states (NESS). One distinguished
feature of NESS is the presence of time reversal asymmetry (TRA) and persistent
probability current loops. These loops lead naturally to the notion of
probability angular momenta, which play a role on the same footing as the noise
covariance in stochastic processes. Illustrating with simulations of simple
models and physical data, we present ways to detect these signals of TRA, from
the subtle to the prominent.

<h3>Inequality indices for heterogeneous systems: a tool for failure  prediction</h3>

<br>
<i>Tarun Ram Kanuri, Subhadeep Roy, Soumyajyoti Biswas</i>
<p>We have numerically studied a mean-field fiber bundle model of fracture at a
non-zero temperature and acted by a constant external tensile stress. The
individual fibers fail (local damage) due to creep-like dynamics that lead up
to a catastrophic breakdown (global failure). We quantify the variations in
sizes of the resulting avalanches by calculating the Lorenz function and two
inequality indices -- Gini ($g$) and Kolkata ($k$) indices -- derived from the
Lorenz function. We show that the two indices cross just prior to the failure
point when the dynamics goes through intermittent avalanches. For a continuous
failure dynamics (finite numbers of fibers breaking at each time step), the
crossing does not happen. However, in that phase, the usual prediction method
i.e., linear relation between the time of minimum strain-rate and failure time,
holds. The boundary between continuous and intermittent dynamics is very close
to the boundary between crossing and non-crossing of the two indices in the
temperature-stress phase space.

charge noise during logical operations in silicon quantum dot spin qubits. Our
method does not require ancillary spectator qubits but makes use of the valley
degree of freedom in silicon. Sharp interface steps or alloy disorder in the
well provide a valley transition dipole element that couples to the field of an
on-chip microwave resonator, allowing rapid reflectometry of valley splitting
fluctuations caused by charge noise. We derive analytic expressions for the
signal-to-noise ratio that can be expected and use tight binding simulations to
extract the key parameters (valley splitting and valley dipole elements) under
realistic disorder. We find that unity signal-to-noise ratio can often be
obtained with measurement times below 1ms, faster than typical decoherence
times, opening the potential for closed-loop control, real-time recalibration,
and feedforward circuits

<p>Geometric frustration is a phenomenon in a lattice system where not all
interactions can be satisfied, the simplest example being antiferromagnetically
coupled spins on a triangular lattice. Frustrated systems are characterized by
their many nearly degenerate ground states, leading to non-trivial phases such
as spin ice and spin liquids. To date most studies are on geometric frustration
of spins; much less explored is orbital geometric frustration. For electrons in
twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) at denominator 3 fractional filling, Coulomb
interactions and the Wannier orbital shapes are predicted to strongly constrain
spatial charge ordering, leading to geometrically frustrated ground states that
produce a new class of correlated insulators (CIs). Here we report the
observation of dominant denominator 3 fractional filling insulating states in
large angle tBLG; these states persist in magnetic fields and display magnetic
ordering signatures and tripled unit cell reconstruction. These results are in
agreement with a strong-coupling theory of symmetry-breaking of geometrically
frustrated fractional states.

<p>We realize a Laughlin state of two rapidly rotating fermionic atoms in an
optical tweezer. By utilizing a single atom and spin resolved imaging
technique, we sample the Laughlin wavefunction, thereby revealing its
distinctive features, including a vortex distribution in the relative motion,
correlations in the particles' relative angle, and suppression of the
inter-particle interactions. Our work lays the foundation for atom-by-atom
assembly of fractional quantum Hall states in rotating atomic gases.

<p>Predicting the emergent properties of impurities immersed in a quantum bath
is a fundamental challenge that can defy quasiparticle treatments. Here, we
measure the spectral properties and real-time dynamics of mobile impurities
injected into a homogeneous Bose--Einstein condensate, using two Feshbach
resonances to tune both the impurity-bath and intrabath interactions. We map
out both attractive and repulsive branches of polaron quasiparticles, resolving
the repulsive polaron and the molecular state associated with the Feshbach
resonance in the strongly interacting regime, and show that the latter also has
a many-body character. Our measurements reveal remarkably universal behavior,
controlled by the bath density and a single dimensionless interaction
parameter; for near-resonant interactions the polarons are no longer well
defined, but the universality still holds.
