<h3>Equilibrium dynamics of infinite-range quantum spin glasses in a field</h3>

We determine the low-energy spectrum and Parisi replica symmetry breaking
function for the spin glass phase of the quantum Ising model with
infinite-range random exchange interactions and transverse and longitudinal
($h$) fields. We show that, for all $h$, the spin glass state has full replica
symmetry breaking, and the local spin spectrum is gapless with a spectral
density which vanishes linearly with frequency. These results are obtained
using an action functional$\unicode{x2014}$argued to yield exact results at low
frequencies$\unicode{x2014}$that expands in powers of a spin glass order
parameter, which is is bilocal in time, and a matrix in replica space. We also
present the exact solution of the infinite-range spherical quantum $p$-rotor
model at nonzero $h$: here, the spin glass state has one-step replica symmetry
breaking, and gaplessness only appears after imposition of an additional
marginal stability condition. Possible connections to experiments on random
arrays of trapped Rydberg atoms are noted.

<h3>The Floquet Fermi Liquid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03268" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03268</a>

<i>Li-kun Shi, Oles Matsyshyn, Justin C. W. Song, Inti Sodemann Villadiego</i>
<br>
<br>
We demonstrate the existence of a non-equilibrium "Floquet Fermi Liquid"
state arising in partially filled Floquet Bloch bands weakly coupled to ideal
fermionic baths, which possess a collection of "Floquet Fermi surfaces"
enclosed inside each other, resembling matryoshka dolls. We elucidate several
properties of these states, including their quantum oscillations under magnetic
fields which feature slow beating patterns of their amplitude reflecting the
different areas of the Floquet Fermi surfaces, consistent with those observed
in microwave induced resistance oscillation experiments. We also investigate
their specific heat and thermodynamic density of states and demonstrate how by
controlling properties of the drive, such as its frequency, one can tune some
of the Floquet Fermi surfaces towards non-equilibrium van-Hove singularities
without changing the electron density.

<h3>Dynamic scaling relation in quantum many-body systems</h3>

In delocalized systems, particle number fluctuations, also known as quantum
surface roughness, and the mean-square displacement exhibit a temporal
power-law growth followed by a saturation to a system-size-dependent value. We
use simple scaling arguments to show that these quantities satisfy the
Family-Vicsek scaling law and derive a dynamic scaling relation between the
dynamical exponents, assuming that the saturation times of both quantities
scale similarly with the system size. This relation clarifies the mechanism
behind quantum surface roughness growth and suggests that diffusive quantum
many-body systems belong to the Edwards-Wilkinson universality class. Moreover,
it provides a convenient way to assess quantum transport in cold-atom
experiments. We numerically verify our results by studying two non-interacting
models and one interacting model having regimes with distinct dynamical
exponents.

<h3>Universal spin wavepacket transport in van der Waals antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03278" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03278</a>

<br>
<br>
Antiferromagnets (AFMs) are promising platforms for the transmission of
quantum information via magnons (the quanta of spin waves), offering advantages
over ferromagnets with regard to dissipation, speed of response, and immunity
to external fields. Recently, it was shown that in the insulating van der Waals
(vdW) semiconductor, CrSBr, strong spin-exciton coupling enables readout of
magnon density and propagation using photons of visible light. This exciting
observation came with a puzzle: photogenerated magnons were observed to
propagate 10$^3$ times faster than the velocity inferred from neutron
scattering, leading to a conjecture that spin wavepackets are carried along by
coupling to much faster elastic modes. Here we show, through a combination of
theory and experiment, that the propagation mechanism is, instead, coupling
within the magnetic degrees of freedom through long range dipole-dipole
coupling. This mechanism is an inevitable consequence of Maxwell's equations,
and as such, will dominate the propagation of spin at long wavelengths in the
entire class of vdW magnets currently under intense investigation. Moreover,
identifying the mechanism of spin propagation provides a set of optimization
rules, as well as caveats, that are essential for any future applications of
these promising systems.

<h3>Nodal topological superconductivity in nodal-line semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03285" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03285</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We analyze possible nodal superconducting phases that emerge from a doped
nodal-line semimetal. We show that nodal-line superconducting phases are
favored by interactions mediated by short-range ferromagnetic fluctuations or
Hund's coupling. It is found that the leading pairing channels are
momentum-independent, orbital-singlet and spin-triplet. In the pairing state,
we show that the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian hosts a pair of
topologically protected nodal rings on the equators of the torus Fermi surface
(FS). Using a topological classification for gapless systems with inversion
symmetry, we find that these nodal rings are topologically nontrivial and
protected by integer-valued monopole charges $\nu = \pm 2$. In the scenario of
pairing driven by ferromagnetic fluctuations, we analyze the fate of
superconductivity in the magnetically ordered phase. Based on Ginzburg-Landau
free energy analysis, we find the energetically favored superconducting state
is characterized by the coexistence of two pairing orders whose $\bf d$-vectors
are perpendicular to the magnetization axis $\bf M$ with their phases unfixed.
In this case, each nodal loop in the pairing state splits into two, carrying a
$\pm 1$ monopole charge. For bulk-boundary correspondence, these nodal rings
enclose flat-band Majorana zero modes on top and bottom surface Brillouin Zones
with distinct $\mathbb{Z}$-valued topological invariants.

<h3>Intertwined van-Hove Singularities as a Mechanism for Loop Current Order  in Kagome Metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03288" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03288</a>
<br>
<i>Heqiu Li, Yong Baek Kim, Hae-Young Kee</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent experiments on Kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs,Rb,K) indicated
spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking in the charge density wave state in
the absence of static magnetization. The loop current order (LCO) is proposed
as its cause, but a microscopic model explaining the emergence of LCO through
electronic correlations has not been firmly established. We show that the
coupling between van-Hove singularities (vHS) with distinct mirror symmetries
is a key ingredient to generate LCO ground state. By constructing an effective
model, we find that when multiple vHS with opposite mirror eigenvalues are
close in energy, the nearest-neighbor electron repulsion favors a ground state
with coexisting LCO and charge bond order. It is then demonstrated that this
mechanism applies to the Kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our findings provide an
intriguing mechanism of LCO and pave the way for a deeper understanding of
complex quantum phenomena in Kagome systems.

<h3>Extreme Value Statistics of Jump Processes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03301" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03301</a>
<br>
<i>Jérémie Klinger, Raphaël Voituriez, Olivier Bénichou</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate extreme value statistics (EVS) of general discrete time and
continuous space symmetric jump processes. We first show that for unbounded
jump processes, the semi-infinite propagator $G_0(x,n)$, defined as the
probability for a particle issued from $0$ to be at position $x$ after $n$
steps whilst staying positive, is the key ingredient needed to derive a variety
of joint distributions of extremes and times at which they are reached. Along
with exact expressions, we extract novel universal asymptotic behaviors of such
quantities. For bounded, semi-infinite jump processes killed upon first
crossing of zero, we introduce the \textit{strip probability}
$\mu_{0,\underline{x}}(n)$, defined as the probability that a particle issued
from 0 remains positive and reaches its maximum $x$ on its $n^{\rm th}$ step
exactly. We show that $\mu_{0,\underline{x}}(n)$ is the essential building
block to address EVS of semi-infinite jump processes, and obtain exact
expressions and universal asymptotic behaviors of various joint distributions.

<h3>Hidden composite (multi)ferroic order</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03312" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03312</a>
<br>
<i>R. Matthias Geilhufe</i>
<br>
<br>
Various complex materials develop ordered states that are not detectable by
conventional experimental probes. Yet, hidden orders typically exhibit indirect
signs of their existence, even if their full microscopic nature has not been
unraveled. Recently, the formalism of composite and intertwined orders has been
remarkably successful in discussing the complex phase diagrams of strongly
correlated materials and high-$T_c$ superconductors. A generalization of the
formalism to other ordered states of matter has remained largely unexplored.
Here, we show that conventional ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials can
exhibit quadrupole orders, emerging above the critical temperature for the
transition into the ferroic phase. The existence of this transition depends on
the anisotropy of the ferroic phase. We show that the quadrupole magnetic and
electric orders couple to the shear elastic constant, which explains
experimental findings for elastic precursors of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric
phase transitions, showing a softening of shear modes in various materials.
Furthermore, we extend our formalism to strongly coupled multiferroic
materials, which can form composites of magnetic and ferroelectric orders. This
gives rise to novel kinds of truly hidden orders, not interacting with
electric, magnetic, or strain as well as insights into the formation of
toroidal moments in multiferroics. As the multipolar and composite orders
discussed here are emerging above the ferroic transition temperatures, they
might be relevant for explaining precursor phenomena in incipient
(multi)ferroic materials.

<br>
We present and characterize a new member of the $R$Cd$_3$P$_3$ ($R$= rare
earth) family of materials, NdCd$_3$P$_3$, which possesses Nd$^{3+}$ cations
arranged on well-separated triangular lattice layers. Magnetic susceptibility
and heat capacity measurements demonstrate a likely $S_{\mathrm{eff}}$ = 1/2
ground state, and also reveal the formation of long-range antiferromagnetic
order at $T_{N} = 0.34$ K. Via measurements of magnetization, heat capacity,
and electrical resistivity, we characterize the electronic properties of
NdCd$_3$P$_3$ and compare results to density functional theory calculations.

<h3>Supercluster states and phase transitions in aggregation-fragmentation  processes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03339" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03339</a>

<i>Wendy Otieno, Nikolai V. Brilliantov, P. L. Krapivsky</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the evolution of aggregates triggered by collisions with monomers
that either lead to the attachment of monomers or the break-up of aggregates
into constituting monomers. Depending on parameters quantifying addition and
break-up rates, the system falls into a jammed or a steady state. Supercluster
states (SCSs) are very peculiar non-extensive jammed states that also arise in
some models. Fluctuations underlie the formation of the SCSs. Conventional
tools, such as the van Kampen expansion, apply to small fluctuations. We go
beyond the van Kampen expansion and determine a set of critical exponents
quantifying SCSs. We observe continuous and discontinuous phase transitions
between the states. Our theoretical predictions are in good agreement with
numerical results.

<h3>Comment on "Two-component density functional theory study of quantized  muons in solids"</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03345" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03345</a>
<br>
<i>Mohammad Goli, Nahid Sadat Riyahi, Shant Shahbazian</i>
<br>
<br>
In [Phys. Rev. B 107, 094433 (2023)], Deng et al. have proposed an
electron-muon correlation functional within the context of the two-component
density functional theory (TC-DFT) for crystals/molecules containing positively
charged muons. In order to verify its performance, we applied the functional in
conjunction with the B3LYP, as a hybrid electronic exchange-correlation
functional, to a benchmark set of molecules. The results demonstrate that the
proposed functional is not capable of reproducing the correct one-muon
densities as well as some other key properties like muon's kinetic energy, the
total energies and the mean muonic bond lengths. Using the muonium atom in a
double-harmonic trap as a model we also demonstrate that the successful
reproduction of the electron-muon contact hyperfine coupling constants by Deng
et al. is probably the result of error cancellations. We also discuss some
theoretical intricacies with the very definition of the electron-muon
correlation energy within the context of the TC-DFT that must be taken into
account in future efforts to design electron-muon correlation functionals.

<h3>Vector spin Seebeck effect and spin swapping effect in antiferromagnetic  insulators with non-collinear spin structure</h3>

<br>
<br>
Antiferromagnets (AFs) are prospective for next-generation high-density and
high-speed spintronic applications due to their negligible stray field and
ultrafast spin dynamics, notwithstanding the challenges in detecting and
manipulating AF order with no magnetization (M = 0). Among the AFs,
non-collinear AFs are of particular interest because of their unique properties
arising from the non-collinear spin structure and the small magnetization M. In
this work, we describe the recently observed vector spin Seebeck effect in
non-collinear LuFeO$_3$, where the magneto-thermovoltage under an in-plane
temperature gradient, not previously observed, is consistent with the predicted
spin swapping effect. Our results shed light on the importance of the
non-collinear spin structure in the emerging spin phenomena in non-collinear
AFs and offer a new class of materials for AF spintronics and spin
caloritronics.

While many piezoelectric materials are known, there is still great potential
to improve on the figures of merit of existing materials through compositional
doping, forming solid solutions. Specifically, it has been shown that doping
and alloying wurtzite-structured materials can improve the piezoelectric
response; however, a vast compositional space has remained unexplored. In this
work, we apply a multi-level screening protocol combining machine learning,
chemical intuition, and thermodynamics to systematically discover dopant
combinations in wurtzite material space that improve the desired piezoelectric
response. Through our protocol, we use computationally inexpensive screening
calculations to consider more than 3000 possible ternary wurtzite solid
solutions from 9 different wurtzite base systems: AlN, BeO, CdS, CdSe, GaN,
ZnO, ZnS, ZnSe, and AgI. Finally, based on thermodynamic analysis and explicit
piezoelectric response calculations, we predict 11 materials with improved
piezoelectric response, due to the incorporation of electropositive dopants.

<h3>Polaritonic Bottleneck in Colloidal Quantum Dots</h3>

Controlling the relaxation dynamics of excitons is key to improve the
efficiencies of semiconductor--based applications. Confined semiconductor
nanocrystals (NCs) offer additional handles to control the properties of
excitons, for example, by changing the size or the shape of the NC, resulting
in a mismatch between the excitonic gaps and the phonon frequencies. This has
led to the hypothesis of a significant slowing down of exciton relaxation in
strongly confined NC, but in practice due to increasing exciton-phonon coupling
and rapid multiphonon relaxation channels, the relaxation of excitons depends
only weakly on the size or shape of the NC. In this work, we focus on
elucidating the nonradiative relaxation of excitons in NC placed in an optical
cavity. We find that as the photon fraction of the lowest polariton state
increases, the relaxation to thermal equilibrium is significantly slowed down,
resulting in a polariton--induced phonon bottleneck, with relaxation timescales
that are slower by orders of magnitude compared to the cavity-free case. This
is achieved by either decreasing the cavity energy below the onset of
absorption or by increasing the coupling between the excitons and the photon
mode.

<h3>Automated Characterization of a Double Quantum Dot using the Hubbard  Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03400" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03400</a>

Semiconductor quantum dots are favorable candidates for quantum information
processing due to their long coherence time and potential scalability. However,
the calibration and characterization of interconnected quantum dot arrays have
proven to be challenging tasks. One method to characterize the configuration of
such an array involves using the Hubbard model. In this paper, we present an
automated characterization algorithm that efficiently extracts the Hubbard
model parameters, including tunnel coupling and capacitive coupling energy,
from experimental stability diagrams. Leveraging the dual annealing optimizer,
we determine the set of Hubbard parameters that best characterize the
experimental data. We compare our method with an alternate, well-established
measure of the tunnel coupling and find good agreement within the investigated
regime. Our extracted tunnel couplings range from 69 to 517 $\mu$eV, and we
discuss the limiting factors of our method.

<h3>Topological Mixed Valence Model in Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03416" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03416</a>
<br>
<i>Yantao Li, Benjamin M. Fregoso, Maxim Dzero</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a model to describe the mixed valence regime in magic-angle
twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) using the recently developed heavy-fermion
framework. By employing the large-$N$ slave-boson approach, we derive the
self-consistent mean field equations and solve them numerically. We find that
the SU(8) symmetry constraint moir\'e system exhibits novel mixed-valence
properties which are different from conventional heavy-fermions systems. We
find the solutions describing the physics at the filling near the Mott
insulator regime in the limit of strong Coulomb interactions between the
flat-band fermions. Our model can provide additional insight into the possible
microscopic origin of unconventional superconductivity in MATBG.

<h3>Quantized Hall conductance in graphene by nonperturbative  magnetic-field-containing relativistic tight-binding approximation method</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03444" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03444</a>
<br>
<i>Md. Abdur Rashid, Masahiko Higuchi, Katsuhiko Higuch</i>
<br>
<br>
In this study, we conducted a numerical investigation on the Hall conductance
($\sigma_{Hall}$) of graphene based on the magnetic energy band structure
calculated using a nonperturbative magnetic-field-containing relativistic
tight-binding approximation (MFRTB) method. The nonperturbative MFRTB can
revisit two types of plateaus for the dependence of $\sigma_{Hall}$ on Fermi
energy. One set is characterized as wide plateaus (WPs). These WPs have filling
factors (FFs) of 2, 6, 10, 14, etc. and are known as the half-integer quantum
Hall effect. The width of WPs decreases with increasing FF, which exceeds the
decrease expected from the linear dispersion relation of graphene. The other
set is characterized by narrow plateaus (NPs), which have FFs of 0, 4, 8, 12,
etc. The NPs correspond to the energy gaps caused by the spin-Zeeman effect and
spin-orbit interaction. Furthermore, it was discovered that the degeneracy of
the magnetic energy bands calculated using the nonperturbative MFRTB method
leads to a quantized $\sigma_{Hall}$.

hopes that the target readers of undergraduate level students can find
fascinating aspects of surface tension as the boundary of macroscopic and

<h3>Dynamical phase transition and scaling in the chiral clock Potts chain</h3>

<i>Xue-Jia Yu</i>
<br>
<br>
Based on time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) techniques, we
investigate the dynamical critical behavior of quantum three-state Potts chains
with chiral interactions. Using Loschmidt echo, order parameter, and
entanglement entropy as an indicator, we show that as the chiral interaction
$\theta$ increases, the first critical time $t_{1}^{*}$ shift towards lower
values, indicating a chirality-enhanced dynamical phase transition. Moreover,
we perform dynamical scaling for the Loschmidt echo and obtain the critical
exponent $\nu$ at the non-conformal critical point. The results show that as
the chiral interaction $\theta$ increases, the correlation length exponent
$\nu$ decreases, which is similar to the long-range interaction case. Finally,
we give a simple physical argument to understand the above numerical results.
This work provides a useful reference for further research on many-body physics
out of equilibrium with chiral interaction.

<h3>Transition metal single-atom anchored on MoSi2N4 monolayer as highly  efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction</h3>

Single-atom catalysts are considered as a promising method for efficient
energy conversion, owing to their advantages of high atom utilization and low
catalyst cost. However, finding a stable two-dimensional structure and high
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance is a current research hotspot.
Herein, based on the first-principles calculations, we identify the HER
properties of six catalysts (TM@MoSi2N4, TM = Sc, Ti, V, Fe, Co, and Ni)
comprising transition metal atoms anchored on MoSi2N4 monolayer. The results
show that the spin-polarized states appear around the Fermi level after
anchoring TM atoms. Therefore, the energy level of the first available
unoccupied state for accommodating hydrogen drops, regulating the bonding
strength of hydrogen. Thus, the single transition metal atom activates the
active site of the MoSi2N4 inert base plane, becoming a quite suitable site for
the HER. Based on {\Delta}GH*, the exchange current density and volcano diagram
of the corresponding catalytic system were also calculated. Among them,
V@MoSi2N4 ({\Delta}GH* = -0.07 eV) and Ni@MoSi2N4 ({\Delta}GH* = 0.06 eV)
systems show efficient the HER property. Our study confirms that the transition
metal atom anchoring is an effective means to improve the performance of
electrocatalysis, and TM@MoSi2N4 has practical application potential as a high
efficiency HER electrocatalyst.

<h3>Giant Apparent Flexoelectricity in Semiconductors Driven by  Insulator-to-metal Transition</h3>

<i>Ya-Xun Wang, Jian-Gao Li, Gotthard Seifert, Kai Chang, Dong-Bo Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
We elucidate the flexoelectricity of materials in the high strain gradient
regime, of which the underlying mechanism is less understood. By using the
generalized Bloch theorem, we uncover a strong flexoelectric-like effect in
bent thinfilms of Si and Ge due to a high strain gradient-induced
insulator-to-metal transition. We show that an unusual type-II band alignment
is formed between the compressed and elongated sides of the bent film,
resulting in a spatial separation of electron and hole. Therefore, upon the
insulator-to-metal transition, electrons transfer from the compressed side to
the elongated side to reach the thermodynamic equilibrium, leading to
pronounced polarization along the film thickness dimension. The obtained
transverse flexoelectric coefficients are unexpectedly high, with a quadratic
dependence on the film thickness. This new mechanism is extendable to other
semiconductor materials with moderate energy gaps. Our findings have important
implications for the future applications of flexoelectricity in semiconductor
materials.

<h3>Machine learning of kinetic energy densities with target and feature  averaging: better results with fewer training data</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03482" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03482</a>

<br>
<br>
Machine learning of kinetic energy functionals (KEF), in particular kinetic
energy density (KED) functionals, has recently attracted attention as a
promising way to construct KEFs for orbital-free density functional theory
(OF-DFT). Neural networks (NN) and kernel methods including Gaussian process
regression (GPR) have been used to learn Kohn-Sham (KS) KED from density-based
descriptors derived from KS DFT calculations. The descriptors are typically
expressed as functions of different powers and derivatives of the electron
density. This can generate large and extremely unevenly distributed datasets,
which complicates effective application of machine learning techniques. Very
uneven data distributions require many training data points, can cause
overfitting, and ultimately lower the quality of a ML KED model. We show that
one can produce more accurate ML models from fewer data by working with
partially averaged density-dependent variables and KED. Averaging palliates the
issue of very uneven data distributions and associated difficulties of
sampling, while retaining enough spatial structure necessary for working within
the paradigm of KEDF. We use GPR as a function of partially spatially averaged
terms of the 4th order gradient expansion and the Kohn-Sham effective potential
and obtain accurate and stable (with respect to different random choices of
training points) kinetic energy models for Al, Mg, and Si simultaneously from
as few as 2000 samples (about 0.3% of the total KS DFT data). In particular,
accuracies on the order of 1% in a measure of the quality of energy-volume
dependence B' = \frac{E(V_0-\Delta V)-2E(V_0)+E(V_0 + \Delta
V)}{\big(\frac{\Delta V}{V_0}\big)^2} are obtained simultaneously for all three
materials.

Markovian open many-body quantum systems display complicated relaxation
dynamics. The spectral gap of the Liouvillian characterizes the asymptotic
decay rate towards the stationary state, but it has recently been pointed out
that the spectral gap does not necessarily determine the overall relaxation
time. Our understanding on the relaxation process before the asymptotically
long-time regime is still limited. We here present a collective relaxation
dynamics of autocorrelation functions in the stationary state. As a key
quantity in the analysis, we introduce the instantaneous decay rate, which
characterizes the transient relaxation and converges to the conventional
asymptotic decay rate in the long-time limit. Our theory predicts that a
bulk-dissipated system generically shows an accelerated decay before the
asymptotic regime due to the scrambling of quantum information associated with
the operator spreading.

Topological quantum materials (TQMs) have symmetry protected band structures
with useful electronic properties that have applications in information,
sensing, energy, and other technologies. In the past 10 years, the applications
of TQMs in the field of energy conversion and storage mainly including water
splitting, ethanol electro-oxidation, battery, supercapacitor, and relative
energy-efficient devices have attracted increasing attention. The novel quantum
states in TQMs provide a stable electron bath with high conductivity and
carrier mobility, long lifetime, and determined spin states, making TQMs an
ideal platform for understanding the surface reactions and looking for highly
efficient materials for energy conversion and storage. In this Perspective, we
present an overview of the recent progress regarding topological quantum
catalysis. We describe the open problems, and the potential applications of
TQMs in water splitting, batteries, supercapacitors, and other prospects in
energy conversion and storage.

We present a formulation of spin-conserving and spin-flip, hybrid
time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), including the calculation of
analytical forces, which allows for efficient calculations of excited state
properties of solid-state systems with hundreds to thousands of atoms. We
discuss an implementation on both GPU and CPU based architectures, along with
several acceleration techniques. We then apply our formulation to the study of
several point defects in semiconductors and insulators, specifically the
negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy and neutral silicon-vacancy centers in
diamond, the neutral divacancy center in 4H silicon carbide, and the neutral
oxygen-vacancy center in magnesium oxide. Our results highlight the importance
of taking into account structural relaxations in excited states, in order to
interpret and predict optical absorption and emission mechanisms in
spin-defects.

Electrons in two-dimensional (2D) Dirac materials carry local band geometric
quantities, such as the Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moments, which,
combined with electron-phonon coupling, may affect the phonon dynamics in an
unusual way. Here, we propose intrinsic nonreciprocal linear and circular
phonon dichroism in magnetic 2D Dirac materials, which originate from nonlocal
band geometric quantities of electrons and reduce to pure Fermi-surface
properties for acoustic phonons. We find that to acquire the nonreciprocity,
the Fermi pocket anisotropy rather than the chirality of electrons is crucial.
Two possible mechanisms of Fermi pocket anisotropy are suggested: (i) trigonal
warping and out-of-plane magnetization or (ii) Rashba spin-orbit interaction
and in-plane magnetization. As a concrete example, we predict appreciable and
tunable nonreciprocal phonon dichroism in 2H-MoTe 2 on a EuO substrate. Our
finding points to a different route towards electrical control of phonon
nonreciprocity for acoustoelectronics applications based on 2D quantum
materials.

Non-Hermitian systems exhibit many novel dynamical behaviors, such as
entanglement phase transitions due to non-Hermitian skin effects. In this work,
we delve into the entanglement dynamics of the non-Hermitian
Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) chain. With the quasiperiodic strength increases, a
transition occurs from area laws induced by the skin effect to area laws
arising from Anderson localization. Two different mechanisms for generating the
area law are revealed through early stage entanglement dynamics. Under the skin
effect, the entanglement entropy exhibits a non-monotonic process,
characterized by initial growth, subsequent oscillations, and eventual
convergence to a stable value. In contrast, within the Anderson localization
regime, where particle diffusion is absent, the entanglement entropy remains
consistently low. The sharp contrast in the early stage behavior highlights
these two area law regions as distinct phases. Interestingly, at the critical
line between these two regimes of area laws, a volume law emerges. Our study
reveals that the area law induced by the skin effect and the Anderson
localization is two different phases, and that a volume law can emerge at the
phase transition point. The understanding of the entanglement phase transition
induced by disorder and skin effect is thus deepened.

<h3>Strong coupling between WS$_2$ monolayer excitons and a hybrid plasmon  polariton at room temperature</h3>

Light-matter interactions in solid-state systems have attracted considerable
interest in recent years. Here, we report on a room-temperature study on the
interaction of tungsten disulfide (WS$_2$) monolayer excitons with a hybrid
plasmon polariton (HPP) mode supported by nanogroove grating structures milled
into single-crystalline silver flakes. By engineering the depth of the
nanogroove grating, we can modify the HPP mode at the A-exciton energy from
propagating surface plasmon polariton-like (SPP-like) to localized surface
plasmon resonance-like (LSPR-like). Using reflection spectroscopy, we
demonstrate strong coupling between the A-exciton mode and the lower branch of
the HPP for a SPP-like configuration with a Rabi splitting of 68 meV. In
contrast, only weak coupling between the constituents is observed for LSPR-like
configurations. These findings demonstrate the importance to consider both the
plasmonic near-field enhancement and the plasmonic damping during the design of
the composite structure since a possible benefit from increasing the coupling
strength can be easily foiled by larger damping.

<br>
A topological insulator is a quantum material which possesses conducting
surfaces and an insulating bulk. Despite extensive researches on the properties
of Dirac surface states, the characteristics of bulk states have remained
largely unexplored. Here we report the observation of spinor-dominated
magnetoresistance anomalies in the topological insulator $\beta $-Ag$_2$Se,
induced by a magnetic-field-driven band topological phase transition. These
anomalies are caused by intrinsic orthogonality in the wave-function spinors of
the last Landau bands of the bulk states, in which backscattering is strictly
forbidden during a band topological phase transition. This new type of
longitudinal magnetoresistance, purely controlled by the wave-function spinors
of the last Landau bands, highlights a unique signature of electrical transport
around the band topological phase transition. With further reducing the quantum
limit and gap size in $\beta $-Ag$_2$Se, our results may also suggest possible
device applications based on this spinor-dominated mechanism and signify a rare
case where topology enters the realm of magnetoresistance control.

Carbazole-based self-assembled monolayers (PACz-SAMs), anchored via their
phosphonic acid group on a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) have demonstrated
excellent performance as hole-selective layers in inverted perovskite solar
cells. However, the influence of the TCO microstructure on the effective work
function (WF) shift after SAM anchoring and WF variations at the
micro/nanoscale have not been extensively studied yet. Herein, we used Kelvin
probe force microscopy (KPFM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and
ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to investigate the effect of
microstructure of Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO) on the WF distribution upon 2PACz-SAMs
and NiOx/2PACz-SAMs application. For this, ITO substrates with amorphous and
polycrystalline (with nanoscale and microscale-sized grains) microstructures
are studied. A correlation between the ITO crystal grain orientation and
2PACz-SAMs local potential distribution was found via KPFM and EBSD. These
variations vanish for amorphous ITO or when adding an amorphous NiOx buffer
layer, where a uniform and homogeneous surface potential distribution is
mapped. UPS confirmed the overall ITO WF increase after 2PACz-SAMs deposition.
Considering the importance of polycrystalline TCOs as high mobility and
broadband transparent electrodes, we provide insights to ensure uniform WF
distribution and enhance the performance of hole transport SAMs in perovskite
solar cells.

We studied the influence of a magnetic field (MF) on epitaxial growth and
magnetic properties of Fe(001) films deposited on MgO(001). Thanks to modular
sample holders and a specialized manipulator in our multi-chamber ultrahigh
vacuum system, the films could be deposited and annealed in an in-plane MF of
100 mT. In situ scanning tunnelling microscopy showed that MF had a strong
influence on the film morphology, and, in particular, on the structure of
surface steps. The magnetic properties were studied ex situ using magneto-optic
Kerr effect (MOKE) magnetometry and microscopy. We showed that the moderate
in-plane magnetic field applied during growth has the visible impact on the
magnetic properties. The observed angular dependence of the MOKE loops and
domain structures were discussed based on a magnetization reversal model. In
particular we found that magnetization reversal occurs via 90{\deg} domains and
the reversal differs for the no-field and in-field grown samples, in
correlation with the film morphology.

Silicon-oxygen compounds are among the most important ones in the natural
sciences, occurring as building blocks in minerals and being used in
semiconductors and catalysis. Beyond the well known silicon dioxide, there are
phases with different stoichiometric composition and nanostructured composites.
One of the key challenges in understanding the Si-O system is therefore to
accurately account for its nanoscale heterogeneity beyond the length scale of
individual atoms. Here we show that a unified computational description of the
full Si-O system is indeed possible, based on atomistic machine learning
coupled to an active-learning workflow. We showcase applications to
very-high-pressure silica, to surfaces and aerogels, and to the structure of
amorphous silicon monoxide. In a wider context, our work illustrates how
structural complexity in functional materials beyond the atomic and
few-nanometre length scales can be captured with active machine learning.

The small footprint of semiconductor qubits is favourable for scalable
quantum computing. However, their size also makes them sensitive to their local
environment and variations in gate structure. Currently, each device requires
tailored gate voltages to confine a single charge per quantum dot, clearly
challenging scalability. Here, we tune these gate voltages and equalize them
solely through the temporary application of stress voltages. In a double
quantum dot, we reach a stable (1,1) charge state at identical and
predetermined plunger gate voltage and for various interdot couplings. Applying
our findings, we tune a 2$\times$2 quadruple quantum dot such that the
(1,1,1,1) charge state is reached when all plunger gates are set to 1 V. The
ability to define required gate voltages may relax requirements on control
electronics and operations for spin qubit devices, providing means to advance
quantum hardware.

<h3>Non-equilibrium time evolution in the sine-Gordon model revisited</h3>

We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of the quantum sine-Gordon model
describing a pair of Josephson-coupled one-dimensional bosonic
quasi-condensates. Motivated by experimentally accessible quench procedures
where the zero mode of the quasi-condensates is weakly coupled to finite
momentum modes, we develop a novel Hamiltonian truncation scheme relying on a
mini-superspace treatment of the zero mode (MSTHA). We apply this method to
simulate the time evolution after both weak and strong quantum quenches,
injecting a low or high energy density into the system, and demonstrate that
MSTHA accurately captures the dynamics from the hard core boson limit to the
experimentally relevant weakly interacting regime for sufficiently mild
quenches. In the case of high energy densities, MSTHA breaks down for weak
interaction but still extends the range of validity of previous Hamiltonian
truncation schemes. We also compare these results to the semiclassical
truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) and establish that the dynamics can be
well approximated by the semiclassical description in the weakly interacting
regime realised in the experiments. In addition, we clarify the importance of
the phononic modes depending on the sine-Gordon interaction strength.

Attractive $p$-wave one-dimensional fermions are studied in the fermionic
Tonks-Girardeau regime in which the diagonal properties are shared with those
of an ideal Bose gas. We study the off-diagonal properties and present
analytical expressions for the eigenvalues of the one- and two-body density
matrices. One striking aspect is the universality of the occupation numbers
which are independent of the specific shape of the external potential. We show
that the occupation of natural orbitals occurs in pairs, indicating the
formation of molecules, each consisting of two attractive fermions. Those
molecules, being composite bosons, experience Bose-Einstein condensation. To
quantify the amount of molecular condensation, we explicitly evaluate the
largest eigenvalue of the two-body density matrix and demonstrate that the
molecular condensation is complete.

<h3>Probing Hilbert space fragmentation and the block Inverse Participation  Ratio</h3>

<br>
We consider a family of quantum many-body Hamiltonians that show exact
Hilbert space fragmentation in certain limits. The question arises whether
fragmentation has implications for Hamiltonians in the vicinity of the subset
defined by these exactly fragmented models, in particular in the thermodynamic
limit. We attempt to illuminate this issue by considering distinguishable
classes of transitional behaviour between fragmented and non-fragmented regimes
and employing a set of numerical observables that indicate this transition. As
one of these observables we present a modified inverse participation ratio
(IPR) that is designed to capture the emergence of fragmented block structures.
We compare this block IPR to other definitions of inverse participation ratios,
as well as to the more traditional measures of level spacing statistics and
entanglement entropy. In order to resolve subtleties that arise in the
numerics, we use perturbation theory around the fragmented limit as a basis for
defining an effective block structure. We find that our block IPR predicts a
boundary between fragmented and non-fragmented regimes that is compatible with
results based on level statistics and bipartite entanglement. A scaling
analysis indicates that a finite region around the exactly fragmented limit is
dominated by effects of approximate fragmentation, even in the thermodynamic
limit, and suggests that fragmentation constitutes a phase. We provide evidence
for the universality of our approach by applying it to a different family of
Hamiltonians, that features a fragmented limit due to emergent
dipole-conservation.

x = 0.05 to 30 mol % for x = 0.30) at the Fe3+ sites of Fe2-xGexO3 system by
chemical coprecipitation route. The charge state of Fe and Ge ions has been
modified into lower values, in addition to their normal +3 and +4 states, to
stabilize the rhombohedral phase of hematite ({\alpha}-Fe2O3) structure. X-ray
photoelectron spectra and optical band gap measurements indicated a combination
of ionic and covalence character of metal-oxygen bonds as an effect of Ge
doping in hematite structure. The Ge doped hematite samples have exhibited wide
band gap semiconductor properties with band gap 4.50-4.70 eV and remarkably
enhanced electrical conductivity ({\sigma} ~ 10-4 S/m) in comparison to
{\alpha}-Fe2O3 (10-11 S/m). The thermo-conductivity measurements using warming
and cooling modes showed a highly irreversible feature in the semiconductor
regime at higher temperatures. Some of the samples indicated metal-like state
at lower temperature, in addition to semiconductor state. Our experimental
results confirmed the strategy of enhancing electrical conductivity by doping
tetravalent ions in hematite structure. It has been understood that combination
of ionic and covalence character of the metal-oxygen bonds has played an
important role in modifying the semiconductor properties in Ge doped Fe2O3
system.

<h3>Detecting Hidden Order in Fractional Chern Insulators</h3>

Topological phase transitions go beyond Ginzburg and Landau's paradigm of
spontaneous symmetry breaking and occur without an associated local order
parameter. Instead, such transitions can be characterized by the emergence of
non-local order parameters, which require measurements on extensively many
particles simultaneously - an impossible venture in real materials. On the
other hand, quantum simulators have demonstrated such measurements, making them
prime candidates for an experimental confirmation of non-local topological
order. Here, building upon the recent advances in preparing few-particle
fractional Chern insulators using ultracold atoms and photons, we propose a
realistic scheme for detecting the hidden off-diagonal long-range order
(HODLRO) characterizing Laughlin states. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
existence of this hidden order in fractional Chern insulators, specifically for
the $\nu=\frac{1}{2}$-Laughlin state in the isotropic Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard
model. This is achieved by large-scale numerical density matrix renormalization
group (DMRG) simulations based on matrix product states, for which we formulate
an efficient sampling procedure providing direct access to HODLRO in close
analogy to the proposed experimental scheme. We confirm the characteristic
power-law scaling of HODLRO, with an exponent $\frac{1}{\nu} = 2$, and show
that its detection requires only a few thousand snapshots. This makes our
scheme realistically achievable with current technology and paves the way for
further analysis of non-local topological orders, e.g. in topological states
with non-Abelian anyonic excitations.

<h3>Ultraviolet-ozone treatment: an effective method for fine-tuning optical  and electrical properties of suspended and substrate-supported MoS2</h3>

<br>
<br>
Ultraviolet-ozone (UV-O3) treatment is a simple but effective technique for
surface cleaning, surface sterilization, doping and oxidation, and is
applicable to a wide range of materials. In this study, we investigated how
UV-O3 treatment affects the optical and electrical properties of molybdenum
disulfide (MoS2), with and without the presence of a dielectric substrate. We
performed detailed photoluminescence (PL) measurements on 1-7 layers of MoS2
with up to 8 minutes of UV-O3 exposure. Density functional theory (DFT)
calculations were carried out to provide insight into oxygen-MoS2 interaction
mechanisms. Our results showed that the influence of UV-O3 treatment on PL
depends on whether the substrate is present, as well as the number of layers.
The PL intensity of the substrate-supported MoS2 decreased dramatically with
the increase of UV-O3 treatment time and was fully quenched after 8 mins.
However, the PL intensity of the suspended flakes was less affected. 4 minutes
of UV-O3 exposure was found to be optimal to produce p-type MoS2, while
maintaining above 80% of the PL intensity and the emission wavelength, compared
to pristine flakes (intrinsically n-type). Our electrical measurements showed
that UV-O3 treatment for more than 6 minutes not only caused a reduction in the
electron density but also deteriorated the hole-dominated transport. It is
revealed that the substrate plays a critical role in the manipulation of the
electrical and optical properties of MoS2, which should be considered in future
device fabrication and applications.

In recent years, higher-order topological phases have attracted great
interest in various fields of physics. These phases have protected boundary
states at lower-dimensional boundaries than the conventional first-order
topological phases due to the higher-order bulk-boundary correspondence. In
this review, we summarize current research progress on higher-order topological
phases in both crystalline and non-crystalline systems. We firstly introduce
prototypical models of higher-order topological phases in crystals and their
topological characterizations. We then discuss effects of quenched disorder on
higher-order topology and demonstrate disorder-induced higher-order topological
insulators. We also review the theoretical studies on higher-order topological
insulators in amorphous systems without any crystalline symmetry and
higher-order topological phases in nonperiodic lattices including quasicrystals
and hyperbolic lattices, which have no crystalline counterparts. We conclude
the review by a summary of experimental realizations of higher-order
topological phases and discussions on potential directions for future study.

<br>
<br>
We analyze the ``ferron" excitations in order-disorder ferroelectrics by a
microscopic pseudo-spin model. We demonstrate that analogous to magnons, the
quanta of spin waves in magnetic materials, ferrons carry both static and
oscillating electric dipole moments, exhibit a Stark effect, and may be
parametrically excited by THz radiation. The anti-crossing gap of the
ferron-photon hybrid depends strongly on propagation direction and an applied
static electric field. We predict ferron diffusion lengths that can reach
centimeters, which implies efficient transport of electric polarization by
temperature gradients. These properties suggest that ferroelectric materials
may be useful for information technology beyond data storage applications.

<br>
<br>
Synthetic antiferromagnets have great potential as skyrmion carriers in which
new properties are expected for these spin textures, owing to changed
magnetostatics and the absence of net topological charge. Here we numerically
simulate the static and dynamic behaviour of skyrmions in these systems and
clearly highlight the benefits compared to ferromagnetic single layers. In
particular, our results show a reduction of the skyrmion radius, an increase of
their velocity under current, and a vanishing of their topological deflection.
We also provide a robust and straightforward analytical model that captures the
physics of such skyrmions. Finally, by extending the model to the case of an
unbalanced SAF, we show some conditions for the system that optimise the
properties of the skyrmion for potential spintronic devices.

Topological nodal-line semimetals are always characterized by the drumhead
surface states at the open boundaries. In this paper we first derive an
analytical expression for the surface Green's function of a nodal-line
semimetal. By making use of this result, we explore the charge and spin
transport properties of a metallic chain on the surface of a nodal-line
semimetal, as functions of the gate voltage applied on the top of the material.
According to the size of the nodal loop, due to the coupling to the surface
modes, the charge conductance in the chain is found to show a robust plateau at
$e^{2}/h$, or to exhibit multiple valleys at $e^{2}/h$. Correspondingly, the
spin polarization of the transmitted current is $100\%$ at the plateau region,
or exhibits multiple peaks at nearly $100\%$. This feature can be viewed as a
transport signature of the topological nodal-line semimetals.

Oxide dispersion strengthened FeCrAl alloys dispersed high-density
nano-oxides in the matrix show outstanding corrosion resistance and mechanical
properties. However, ODS FeCrAl alloys achieve the high strength generally at
the expense of ductility in some way. Here, a method by introducing a bimodal
grain structure was designed to overcome the strength-ductility tradeoff. In
this work, ODS FeCrAl alloys were successfully fabricated through various
mechanical alloying time, combined with spark plasma sintering under the vacuum
of less than 4Pa. Microstructural characterization showed that the average
grains size and nano-oxides size decrease gradually, and the density of
nano-oxides increases, as the milling time increases. Mechanical properties
revealed that both the strength and ductility were significantly synergistic
enhanced with increasing milling time. The bimodal grain distribution
characterized by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) (vacuum degree was
less than 5E-5pa) was beneficial for the activation of the back stress
strengthening and the annihilation of these microcracks, thus achieving the
excellent ductility (27.65%). In addition, transmission electron microscope
(TEM) characterization under the vacuum degree of less than 10-6pa illustrated
that ultra-high-density nano-oxides (9.61E22/m3) was crucial for enhancing the
strength of ODS FeCrAl alloys (993MPa). The strengthening mechanism
superposition, based on the model of nano-oxides interrelated with the
dislocation, illustrated an excellent agreement with experimental results from
yield strength strengthening mechanisms. To our best knowledge, H40 (milled for
40h, and sintered at 1100C) alloy presents the outstanding strength with the
exceptional ductility among all studied ODS FeCrAl alloys, which makes it the
promising cladding materials for the accident tolerant fuel cladding.

The quicker freezing of hotter water, than a colder sample, when quenched to
a common lower temperature, is referred to as the Mpemba effect (ME). While
this counter-intuitive fact remains a surprize since long, efforts have begun
to identify similar effect in other systems. Here we investigate the ME in a
rather general context concerning magnetic phase transitions. From Monte Carlo
simulations of model systems, viz., the $q$-state Potts model and the Ising
model, with varying range of interaction and space dimension, we assert that
hotter paramagnets undergo ferromagnetic ordering faster than the colder ones.
The above conclusion we have arrived at following the analyses of the
simulation results on decay of energy and growth in ordering following quenches
from different starting temperatures, to fixed final temperatures below the
Curie points. We have obtained a unique scaling picture, on the strength of the
effect, with respect to the variation in spatial correlation in the initial
states. These results are valid irrespective of the order of transition and
relevant to the understanding of ME in other systems, including water.

The nuclear spin, being much more isolated from the environment than its
electronic counterpart, enables quantum experiments with prolonged coherence
times and presents a gateway towards uncovering the intricate dynamics within
an atom. These qualities have been demonstrated in a variety of nuclear spin
qubit architectures, albeit with limited control over the direct environment of
the nuclei. As a contrasting approach, the combination of electron spin
resonance (ESR) and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) provides a bottom-up
platform to study the fundamental properties of nuclear spins of single atoms
on a surface. However, access to the time evolution of these nuclear spins, as
was recently demonstrated for electron spins, remained a challenge. Here, we
present an experiment resolving the nanosecond coherent dynamics of a
hyperfine-driven flip-flop interaction between the spin of an individual
nucleus and that of an orbiting electron. We use the unique local
controllability of the magnetic field emanating from the STM probe tip to bring
the electron and nuclear spins in tune, as evidenced by a set of avoided level
crossings in ESR-STM. Subsequently, we polarize both spins through scattering
of tunnelling electrons and measure the resulting free evolution of the coupled
spin system using a DC pump-probe scheme. The latter reveals a complex pattern
of multiple interfering coherent oscillations, providing unique insight into
the atom's hyperfine physics. The ability to trace the coherent hyperfine
dynamics with atomic-scale structural control adds a new dimension to the study
of on-surface spins, offering a pathway towards dynamic quantum simulation of
low-dimensional magnonics.

<br>
<br>
First-principles calculations for two twisted bismuth bilayers, each with 120
atoms, were studied by means of the electronic density of states and
vibrational density of states. Metallic character at the Fermi level was found
for the non-rotated sample as well as for each sample rotated 0.5{\deg},
1.0{\deg}, 1.5{\deg}, 2.0{\deg}, 2.5{\deg}, 3.0{\deg}, 4.0{\deg}, 5.0{\deg},
6.0{\deg}, 7.0{\deg}, 8.0{\deg} and 10{\deg} with respect to the static
bilayer. Assuming that the superconductivity is BCS-type and the invariance of
the Cooper pairing potential, we predict a maximum superconducting temperature
T_c ~ 1.8 K for a magic angle of 0.5{\deg} degrees between the two bilayers,
increasing the superconducting transition temperature from the experimentally
measured value of 0.53 mK for the Wyckoff structure of crystalline bismuth.

Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures composed of two-dimensional (2D)
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) and vdW magnetic materials offer an
intriguing platform to functionalize valley and excitonic properties in
non-magnetic TMDs. Here, we report magneto-photoluminescence (PL)
investigations of monolayer (ML) MoSe$_2$ on the layered A-type
antiferromagnetic (AFM) semiconductor CrSBr under different magnetic field
orientations. Our results reveal a clear influence of the CrSBr magnetic order
on the optical properties of MoSe$_2$, such as an anomalous linear-polarization
dependence, changes of the exciton/trion energies, a magnetic-field dependence
of the PL intensities, and a valley $g$-factor with signatures of an asymmetric
magnetic proximity interaction. Furthermore, first principles calculations
suggest that MoSe$_2$/CrSBr forms a broken-gap (type-III) band alignment,
facilitating charge transfer processes. The work establishes that
antiferromagnetic-nonmagnetic interfaces can be used to control the valley and
excitonic properties of TMDs, relevant for the development of opto-spintronics
devices.

<h3>Study of non-equilibrium Green's functions beyond Born approximation in  open quantum systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03776" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03776</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We provide a systematic approach to compute different kinds of
non-equilibrium Green's functions for open quantum systems which are
essentially two-point correlation functions in time. We reveal that the
definition of Green's functions based on the Born approximation does not
provide the correct results in the leading order of the system-bath coupling.
We next provide a systematic correction term in Green's functions by going
beyond the Born approximation and incorporating a finite correlation between
the system and the bath. We primarily focus on two paradigmatic models of open
quantum systems, namely, the dissipative Caldeira-Leggett model and the
dissipative spin-boson model. We show that the inclusion of such a correction
correctly reproduces the Kadanoff-Baym type equation for the so-called lesser
or greater components of the Green's functions and provides the correct
long-time result up to the first non-zero order of the system-bath coupling,
satisfying the detailed balance condition in thermal equilibrium. We further
extend our study to a system coupled to multiple reservoirs simultaneously that
are maintained at different temperatures and obtain expressions for
non-equilibrium steady-state energy current, once again correct up to the first
non-zero order of the system-bath coupling.

<br>
<br>
The emergence of patterns from simple physical laws belongs to the most
striking topics in natural science. In particular, the spontaneous formation of
structures from an initially homogeneous state can eventually lead to stable,
non-homogeneous states of matter. Here we report on the spontaneous formation
of square lattice patterns in a rotationally symmetric and driven Bose-Einstein
condensate, confined in a two-dimensional box potential with absorptive
boundaries. The drive is realized by globally modulating the two-particle
interaction periodically in time. After a primary phase of randomly oriented
stripes that emerge as a consequence of the Faraday instability, we observe the
subsequent formation of persistent square lattice patterns in the highly
occupied regime, where phonon-phonon interactions become relevant. We show
theoretically that this state can be understood as an attractive fixed point of
coupled nonlinear amplitude equations. Establishing the existence of this fixed
point opens the perspective for engineering new, highly correlated states of
matter in driven superfluids.

<h3>The Anderson mobility edge as a percolation transition</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The location of the mobility edge is a long standing problem in Anderson
localization. In this paper, we show that the effective confining potential
introduced in the localization landscape (LL) theory predicts the onset of
delocalization in 3D tight-binding models, in a large part of the
energy-disorder diagram. The delocalization transition corresponds to the
percolation of the classically-allowed region of the LL-based potential
throughout the system, which is very different from the percolation of the
original potential. This approach, shown to be valid both in the cases of
uniform and binary disorders despite their very different phase diagrams,
allows us to reinterpret the Anderson transition in the tight-binding model:
the mobility edge appears to be composed of two branches, one being understood
as a percolation transition while the second branch, going to the critical
disorder at zero energy, is a consequence of the discrete lattice.

<br>
<br>
Arrays of artificial spin ices exhibit reconfigurable ferromagnetic resonance
frequencies that can be leveraged and designed for potential
applications.However, analytical and numerical studies of the frequency
response of artificial spin ices have remained somewhat limited due to the need
of take into account nonlocal dipole fields in theoretical calculations or by
long computation times in micromagnetic simulations. Here, we introduce
Gaenice, a framework to compute magnon dispersion relations of arbitrary
artificial spin ice configurations. Gaenice makes use of a tight-binding
approach to compute the magnon bands. It also provides the user complete
control of the interaction terms included, e.g., external field, anisotropy,
exchange, and dipole, making it useful also to compute ferromagnetic resonances
for a variety of structures, such as multilayers and ensembles of weakly or
non-interacting nanoparticles. Because it relies on a semi-analytical model,
Gaenice is computationally inexpensive and efficient, making it an attractive
tool for the exploration of large parameter spaces.

<h3>Proposal for all-electrical skyrmion detection in van der Waals tunnel  junctions</h3>

Magnetic skyrmions in atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) materials provide
an ideal playground to push skyrmion technology to the single-layer limit.
However, a major challenge is reliable skyrmion detection. Here, we show, based
on rigorous first-principles calculations, that all-electrical detection of
skyrmions in two-dimensional (2D) vdW magnets is feasible via scanning
tunneling microscopy as well as in planar tunnel junctions with straightforward
implementation into device architectures. We use the nonequilibrium Green's
function method for quantum transport in planar junctions, including
self-energy due to electrodes and working conditions, going beyond the standard
Tersoff-Hamann approximation. An extremely large noncollinear magnetoresistance
(NCMR) of above 10,000 % and a giant tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance
(TAMR) of 200 % are observed for a vdW tunnel junction based on
graphite/Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/germanene/graphite. The NCMR is more than two orders of
magnitude higher than that obtained for conventional transition-metal
interfaces. We trace the origin of the NCMR to spin-mixing between spin-up and
-down states of $p_z$ and $d_{z^2}$ character at the Fe and Te surface atoms
and the orbital matching effect at the interface. Our work paves the way for
all-electrical detection of skyrmionic spin textures in 2D vdW tunnel
junctions.

<h3>Square Pattern Formation as Stable Fixed Point in Driven Two-Dimensional  Bose-Einstein Condensates</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate pattern formation in two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates
(BECs) caused by temporal periodic modulation of the interatomic interaction.
Temporal modulation of the interaction causes the so-called Faraday instability
in the condensate, which we show generically leads to a stable square grid
density pattern. We take the amplitudes in each of the two directions spanning
the two-dimensional density pattern as order parameters in pattern formation
and derive a set of simultaneous time evolution equations for those order
parameters from the Gross--Pitaevskii (GP) equation with a time-periodic
interaction. We identify the fixed points of the time evolution and show by
stability analysis that the inhomogeneous density exhibits a square grid
pattern as a stable fixed point.

The interplay of topology and disorder in non-equilibrium quantum systems is
an intriguing subject. Here, we look for a suitable platform that enables an
in-depth exploration of the topic. To this end, We analyze the topological and
localization properties of a dimerized one-dimensional Kitaev chain in the
presence of an onsite quasiperiodic potential with its amplitude being
modulated periodically in time. The topological features have been explored via
computing the real-space winding numbers corresponding to both the Majorana
zero and the $\pi$ energy modes. We enumerate the scenario at different driving
frequencies. In particular, at some intermediate frequency regime, the phase
diagram concerning the zero mode involves two distinct phase transitions, one
from a topologically trivial to a non-trivial phase, and another from a
topological phase to an Anderson localized phase. On the other hand, the study
of the $\pi$ modes reveals the emergence of a unique topological phase, with
the bulk and the edges being fully localized, which may be called as the
Floquet topological Anderson phase. Furthermore, we study the localization
properties of the bulk states by computing the inverse and normalized
participation ratios, while the critical phase is ascertained by computing the
fractal dimension. We have observed extended, critical, and localized phases at
intermediate frequencies, which are further confirmed via a finite-size scaling
analysis. Finally, fully extended and localized phases are respectively
observed at lower and higher frequencies.

<h3>Hyperbolic lattices and two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory</h3>

Hyperbolic lattices are a new type of synthetic quantum matter emulated in
circuit quantum electrodynamics and electric-circuit networks, where particles
coherently hop on a discrete tessellation of two-dimensional negatively curved
space. While real-space methods and a reciprocal-space hyperbolic band theory
have been recently proposed to analyze the energy spectra of those systems,
discrepancies between the two sets of approaches remain. In this work, we
reconcile those approaches by first establishing an equivalence between
hyperbolic band theory and $U(N)$ topological Yang-Mills theory on higher-genus
Riemann surfaces. We then show that moments of the density of states of
hyperbolic tight-binding models correspond to expectation values of Wilson
loops in the quantum gauge theory and become exact in the large-$N$ limit.

<h3>The $(2+δ)$-dimensional theory of the electromechanics of lipid  membranes: II. Balance laws</h3>

<i>Yannick A. D. Omar, Zachary G. Lipel, Kranthi K. Mandadapu</i>
<br>
<br>
This article is the second of a three-part series that derives a
self-consistent theoretical framework of the electromechanics of arbitrarily
curved lipid membranes. Existing continuum theories commonly treat lipid
membranes as strictly two-dimensional surfaces. While this approach is
successful in many purely mechanical applications, strict surface theories fail
to capture the electric potential drop across lipid membranes, the effects of
surface charges, and electric fields within the membrane. Consequently, they do
not accurately resolve Maxwell stresses in the interior of the membrane and its
proximity. Furthermore, surface theories are generally unable to capture the
effects of distinct velocities and tractions at the interfaces between lipid
membranes and their surrounding bulk fluids. To address these shortcomings, we
apply a recently proposed dimension reduction method to the three-dimensional,
electromechanical balance laws. This approach allows us to derive an effective
surface theory without taking the limit of vanishing thickness, thus
incorporating effects arising from the finite thickness of lipid membranes. We
refer to this effective surface theory as $(2 + \delta)$-dimensional, where
$\delta$ indicates the thickness. The resulting $(2 + \delta)$-dimensional
equations of motion satisfy velocity and traction continuity conditions at the
membrane-bulk interfaces, capture the effects of Maxwell stresses, and can
directly incorporate three-dimensional constitutive models.

<h3>Fate of Quadratic Band Crossing under quasiperiodic modulation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03896" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03896</a>
<br>
<i>Raul Liquito, Miguel Gonçalves, Eduardo V. Castro</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the fate of two-dimensional quadratic band crossing topological
phases under a one-dimensional quasiperiodic modulation. By employing
numerically exact methods, we fully characterize the phase diagram of the model
in terms of spectral, localization and topological properties. Unlike in the
presence of regular disorder, the quadratic band crossing is stable towards the
application of the quasiperiodic potential and most of the topological phase
transitions occur through a gap closing and reopening mechanism, as in the
homogeneous case. With a sufficiently strong quasiperiodic potential, the
quadratic band crossing point splits into Dirac cones which enables transitions
into gapped phases with Chern numbers $C=\pm1$, absent in the homogeneous
limit. This is in sharp contrast with the disordered case, where gapless
$C=\pm1$ phases can arise by perturbing the band crossing with any amount of
disorder. In the quasiperiodic case, we find that the $C=\pm1$ phases can only
become gapless for a very strong potential. Only in this regime, the subsequent
quasiperiodic-induced topological transitions into the trivial phase mirror the
well-known ``levitation and annihilation'' mechanism in the disordered case.
