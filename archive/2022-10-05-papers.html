<h3>The BKT Transition and its Dynamics in a Spin Fluid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01838" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01838</a>
<br>
<i>Thomas Bissinger, Matthias Fuchs</i>
<br>
We study the effect of particle mobility on phase transitions in a spin fluid
in two dimensions. The presence of a phase transition of the BKT universality
class is shown in an off-lattice model of particles with purely repulsive
interaction employing computer simulations. A critical spin wave region $0 < T
< T_{\textrm{BKT}}$ is found with a non-universal exponent $\eta(T)$ that
follows the shape suggested by BKT theory, including a critical value
consistent with $\eta_{\textrm{BKT}} = 1/4$. One can observe a transition from
power-law decay to exponential decay in the static correlation functions at the
transition temperature $T_{\textrm{BKT}}$, which is supported by finite-size
scaling analysis. A critical temperature $T_{\textrm{BKT}} = 0.17(1)$ is
suggested. Investigations into the dynamic aspects of the phase transition are
carried out. The short-time behavior of the incoherent spin autocorrelation
function agrees with the Nelson-Fisher prediction, whereas the long-time
behavior differs from the finite-size scaling known for the static XY model.
Analysis of coherent spin wave dynamics shows that the spin wave peak is a
propagating mode that can be reasonably well fitted by hydrodynamic theory. The
mobility of the particles strongly enhances damping of the spin waves, but the
model lies still within the dynamic universality class of the standard XY
model.

<h3>Validity of path thermodynamic description of reactive systems:  Microscopic simulations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01952" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01952</a>
<br>
<i>F. Baras, A.L. Garcia, M. Malek Mansour</i>
<br>
Traditional stochastic modeling of reactive systems limits the domain of
applicability of the associated path thermodynamics to systems involving a
single elementary reaction at the origin of each observed change in
composition. An alternative stochastic modeling has recently been proposed to
overcome this limitation. These two ways of modeling reactive systems are in
principle incompatible. The question thus arises about choosing the appropriate
type of modeling to be used in practical situations. In the absence of
sufficiently accurate experimental results, one way to address this issue is
through the microscopic simulation of reactive fluids, usually based on
hard-sphere dynamics in the Boltzmann limit. In this paper, we show that
results obtained through such simulations unambiguously confirm the predictions
of traditional stochastic modeling, invalidating a recently proposed
alternative.

<h3>The magnetic properties of the iron phthalocyanine molecule grafted to  the Ti$_2$C MXene layer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02141" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02141</a>
<br>

<br>
The magnetic tetrapyrrole molecules (such as porphyrins and phthalocyanines)
with an active transition metal atom in their centre are currently intensively
studied as prosperous potential elements of devices for high-density
information storage and processing. It has been recently proved that by means
of external factors one could induce two stable fully controllable molecular
states. Therefore, hybrid systems consisting of such magnetic molecules and
suitable carriers from the family of two-dimensional materials are often
considered as promising highly scalable spintronic systems that could in the
near future lead to novel industrial applications. Here, we perform the spin
polarised density functional theory (DFT) studies of the hybrid system, which
is the iron phthalocyanine molecule (FePc) on the top of the titanium carbide
Ti$_2$C MXene layer. The most relevant issue in this part is the interaction
between magnetic atoms: Ti from MXene substrate and iron from FePc. Four
various magnetic configurations of FePc/Ti$_2$C were considered. The
significant ferromagnetic interaction between the iron atom and the upper
titanium layer plays important role in the reorientation of the iron atom's
magnetic moment. We also analyse a model of the system in which the FePc
molecule is in a quintet state (the ground state of an isolated molecule is a
triplet). To get a better understanding of the physics of the FePc/Ti$_2$C
hybrid system, we studied the hybrid systems with a single iron atom and
non-magnetic H$_2$Pc on the Ti$_2$C layer, Fe/Ti$_2$C and H$_2$Pc/Ti$_2$C,
respectively, which nicely explains the role of the Pc ligand in the
FePc/Ti$_2$C hybrid system.

<h3>Domain wall melting across a defect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02162" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02162</a>
<br>
<i>Luca Capizzi, Stefano Scopa, Federico Rottoli, Pasquale Calabrese</i>
<br>
We study the melting of a domain wall in a free-fermionic chain with a
localised impurity. We find that the defect enhances quantum correlations in
such a way that even the smallest scatterer leads to a linear growth of the
entanglement entropy contrasting the logarithmic behaviour in the clean system.
Exploiting the hydrodynamic approach and the quasiparticle picture, we provide
exact predictions for the evolution of the entanglement entropy for arbitrary
bipartitions. In particular, the steady production of pairs at the defect gives
rise to non-local correlations among distant points. We also characterise the
subleading logarithmic corrections, highlighting some universal features.

<h3>Stochastic dynamics of an impurity with spin-orbit coupling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01829" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01829</a>
<br>
<i>Areg Ghazaryan, Alberto Cappellaro, Mikhail Lemeshko, Artem G. Volosniev</i>
<br>
Brownian dynamics of a mobile impurity in a bath is affected by spin-orbit
coupling~(SOC). Here, we discuss a Caldeira-Leggett-type model that can be used
to propose and analyze quantum simulators of this dynamics in cold Bose gases.
In particular, we derive a master equation and explore it in a one-dimensional
setting. To validate the standard assumptions needed for our derivation, we
analyze available experimental data without SOC; as a byproduct, this analysis
suggests that the quench dynamics of the impurity is beyond the Bose-polaron
approach at temperatures currently accessible in a cold-atom laboratory --
motion of the impurity is mainly driven by dissipation. For systems with SOC,
we demonstrate that one-dimensional spin-orbit coupling can be `gauged out'
even in the presence of dissipation -- the information about SOC is
incorporated in the initial conditions. Observables sensitive to this
information (such as spin densities) can be used to study formation of steady
spin polarization domains during quench dynamics.

<h3>Exceptional van Hove Singularities in Pseudogapped Metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01830" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01830</a>
<br>
<i>Indranil Paul, Marcello Civelli</i>
<br>
Motivated by the pseudogap state of the cuprates, we introduce the concept of
an "exceptional" van Hove singularity that appears when strong
electron-electron interaction splits an otherwise simply connected Fermi
surface into multiply connected pieces. The singularity describes the touching
of two pieces of the split Fermi surface. We show that this singularity is
proximate to a second order van Hove singularity, which can be accessed by
tuning a dispersion parameter. We argue that, in a wide class of cuprates, the
end-point of the pseudogap is accessed only by triggering the exceptional van
Hove singularity. The resulting Lifshitz transition is characterized by
enhanced specific heat and nematic susceptibility, as seen in experiments.

<h3>Mapping quantum Hall edge states in graphene by scanning tunneling  microscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01831" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01831</a>
<br>
<i>T. Johnsen, C. Schattauer, S. Samaddar, A. Weston, M. Hamer, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, R. Gorbachev, F. Libisch, M. Morgenstern</i>
<br>
Quantum Hall edge states are the paradigmatic example of the bulk-boundary
correspondence. They are prone to intricate reconstructions calling for their
detailed investigation at high spatial resolution. Here, we map quantum Hall
edge states of monolayer graphene at a magnetic field of 7 T with scanning
tunneling microscopy. The graphene sample features a gate-tunable lateral
interface between areas of different filling factor. We compare the results
with detailed tight-binding calculations quantitatively accounting for the
perturbation by the tip-induced quantum dot. We find that the edge state
pattern is mapped with little perturbation by adequate choice of gate voltage.
We observe extended compressible regions, the antinodal structure of edge
states and their meandering along the lateral interface.

<h3>Disentangling Growth and Decay of Domains During Phase Ordering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01836" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01836</a>
<br>
<i>Suman Majumder</i>
<br>
Using Monte Carlo simulations we study the phase ordering dynamics of a
\textit{multi}-species system modeled via the prototype $q$-state Potts model.
In such a \textit{multi}-species system, we identify a spin states or species
as the \textit{winner} if it has survived as the majority in the final state,
otherwise we mark them as \textit{loser}. We disentangle the time ($t$)
dependence of the domain length of the \textit{winner} from \textit{losers},
rather than monitoring the average domain length obtained by treating all spin
states or species alike. The kinetics of domain growth of the \textit{winner}
at a finite temperature in space dimension $d=2$ reveal that the expected
Lifshitz-Cahn-Allen scaling law $\sim t^{1/2}$ can be observed with no
early-time corrections, even for system sizes much smaller than what is
traditionally used. Up to a certain period, all the others species, i.e., the
\textit{losers}, also show a growth that, however, is dependent on the total
number of species, and slower than the expected $\sim t^{1/2}$ growth.
Afterwards, the domains of the \textit{losers} start decaying with time, for
which our data strongly suggest the behavior $\sim t^{-z}$, where $z=2$ is the
dynamical exponent for nonconserved dynamics. We also demonstrate that this new
approach of looking into the kinetics also provides new insights for the
special case of phase ordering at zero temperature, both in $d=2$ and $d=3$.

<h3>Wettability alteration in thiolene-based polymer microfluidics: surface  characterization and advanced fabrication techniques</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01843" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01843</a>
<br>
<i>Mahtab Masouminia, Kari Dalnoki-Veress, Benzhong Zhao</i>
<br>
Wettability plays a significant role in controlling multiphase flow in porous
media for many industrial applications, including geologic carbon dioxide
sequestration, enhanced oil recovery, and fuel cells. Microfluidics is a
powerful tool to study the complexities of interfacial phenomena involved in
multiphase flow in well-controlled geometries. Recently, the thiolene-based
polymer called NOA81 emerged as an ideal material in the fabrication of
microfluidic devices, since it combines the versatility of conventional soft
photolithography with a wide range of achievable wettability conditions.
Specifically, the wettability of NOA81 can be continuously tuned through
exposure to high-energy UV. Despite its growing popularity, the exact physical
and chemical mechanisms behind the wettability alteration have not been fully
characterized.
Here, we apply different characterization techniques, including contact angle
measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force
microscopy (AFM) to investigate the impact of high-energy UV on the chemical
and physical properties of NOA81 surfaces. We find that high-energy UV exposure
increases the oxygen-containing polar functional groups, which enhances the
surface energy and hydrophilicity of NOA81. Additionally, our AFM measurements
show that spin-coated NOA81 surfaces have a roughness less than a nanometer,
which is further reduced after high-energy UV irradiation. Lastly, we advance
the state-of-the-art of NOA81-based microfluidic systems by creating i) a 2D
surface with controlled wettability gradient and ii) a 3D column packed with
monodisperse NOA81 beads of controlled size and wettability.

<h3>Crystal Nucleation in Al-Ni Alloys: an Unsupervised Chemical and  Topological Learning Approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01894" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01894</a>
<br>
<i>Sébastien Becker, Emilie Devijver, Rémi Molinier, Noël Jakse</i>
<br>
Crystallization represents a fundamental process engendering solidification
of a material and determines its microstructure. Driven by complex phenomena at
the atomic scale, its understanding for alloys still remains elusive. The
present work proposes a large scale molecular dynamics simulation study of the
homogeneous crystal nucleation pathways of prototypical undercooled Al-Ni
binary alloys. An unsupervised topological learning analysis shows that the
nucleation sets in first from a chemical ordering, followed by a
bond-orientational ordering of the underlying crystal phase. Our results
indicate also a different polymorph selection that depends on composition.
While the nucleation pathway of Al50 Ni50 displays a single step with the
emergence of B2 short-range order, a step-wise nucleation toward the L12 phase
is seen for Al25 Ni75 . The influence of the nucleation of pure Al and Ni
counterparts is further discussed.

<h3>Low-temperature theory of inversion and quantum oscillations in Kondo  insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01929" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01929</a>
<br>
<i>Arnav Pushkar, Brijesh Kumar</i>
<br>
The half-filled Kondo lattice model is studied at low temperatures on simple
cubic lattice using the self-consistent theory developed in Phys. Rev. B 96,
075115 (2017). It is found to have three distinct insulating phases in the
temperature-hopping plane, namely, the strong coupling Kondo singlet (KS)
phase, the inverted Kondo singlet (iKS) phase distinguished from the KS by
inversion, and the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase. The quasiparticle density of
states across the inversion transition is noted to exhibit dimensional
reduction, which can differentiate between the KS and iKS insulators in
experiments. Magnetic quantum oscillations obtained in the iKS and AFM phases
are found to show Lifshitz-Kosevich like behaviour with temperature as well as
inverse hopping.

<h3>Zero flat band electronic modes of twisted bilayer graphene: 3/2  quantization magic-angle rule and the hidden connection with coherent Landau  level states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01931" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01931</a>
<br>
<i>Leonardo A. Navarro-Labastida, Gerardo G. Naumis</i>
<br>
Flat band electronic modes in twisted graphene bilayers are responsible for
superconducting and other highly correlated electron-electron phases. Although
some hints were known of a possible connection between the lowest Landau level
and zero flat band modes, it was not clear how such connection appears. Here
the electronic behavior in twisted bilayer graphene is studied using the chiral
model Hamiltonian. As a result it is proved that for high-order magic angles,
the zero flat band modes converge into coherent Landau states with a dispersion
$\sigma^2=1/3\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is a coupling parameter that incorporates
the twist angle and energetic scales. Then it is proved that the square of the
hamiltonian, which is a $2\times 2$ matrix operator, turns out to be equivalent
to a two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. The interlayer currents
between graphene's bipartite lattices are identified with the angular momentum
term while the confinement potential is an effective quadratic potential. From
there it is proved a limiting quantization rule for high-order magic angles,
i.e., $\alpha_{m+1}-\alpha_{m}=(3/2)m$ where $m$ is the order of the angle. All
these results are in very good agreement with numerical calculations.

<h3>Non-simple flow behavior in a polar van der Waals liquid: structural  relaxation under scope</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01947" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01947</a>
<br>
<i>Silvia Arrese-Igor, Angel Alegria, Juan Colmenero</i>
<br>
The non-exponential character of the structural relaxation is considered one
of the hallmarks of the glassy dynamics and in this context, the singular shape
observed by dielectric techniques has attracted the attention of the community
for long time. Particularly, the exceptionally narrow dielectric response of
polar glass formers has been attributed so far to dipolar cross correlations.
Here we show that dipole interactions can couple to shear stress and modify the
flow behavior preventing the occurrence of the simple liquid behavior. We
discuss our findings in the general framework of the glassy dynamics and the
role of intermolecular interactions.

<h3>Generic Maximum-Valence Model for Fluid Polyamorphism</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01968" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01968</a>
<br>
<i>Nikolay A. Shumovskyi, Sergey V. Buldyrev</i>
<br>
Recently, maximal valence model has been proposed to model liquid-liquid
phase transition induced by polymerization in sulfur. In this paper we present
a simple generic model to describe liquid polyamorphism in single-component
fluids using a maximum-valence approach for any arbitrary coordination number.
The model contains three types of interactions: i) atoms attract each other by
van der Waals forces that generate a liquid-gas transition at low pressures,
ii) atoms may form covalent bonds that induce association, and iii) additional
repulsive forces between atoms with maximal valence and atoms with any valence.
This additional repulsion generates liquid-liquid phase separation. We show the
existence of liquid-liquid phase transitions for dimerization, polymerization,
gelation and network formation for corresponding coordination numbers z = 1, 2,
..6 and discuss the limits of this generic model for producing fluid
polyamorphism.

<h3>Selective coupling of coherent optical phonons in  YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ with electronic transitions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01983" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01983</a>
<br>
<i>Kunie Ishioka, Alexej Pashkin, Christian Bernhard, Hrvoje Petek, Xin Yao, Jure Demsar</i>
<br>
We investigate coherent lattice dynamics in optimally doped
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ driven by ultrashort ($\sim$ 12 fs) near infrared
(NIR) and near ultraviolet (NUV) pulses. Transient reflectivity experiments,
performed at room temperature and under moderate ($<$0.1 mJ/cm$^2$) excitation
fluence, reveal phonon modes related to the O(2,3) bending in the CuO$_2$
planes and to the apical O(4) stretching at frequencies between 10 and 15 THz,
in addition to the previously reported Ba and Cu(2) vibrations at 3.5 and 4.5
THz. The relative coherent phonon amplitudes are in stark contrast to the
relative phonon intensities in the spontaneous Raman scattering spectrum
excited at the same wavelength. This contrast indicates mode-dependent
contributions of the Raman and non-Raman mechanisms to the generation of the
coherent phonons. The particularly intense amplitude of the coherent Cu(2)
phonon, together with its initial phase, supports its generation to be
dominated by non-Raman mechanism involving charge transfer within the CuO$_2$
plane. By contrast, the coherent out-of-phase O(2,3) bending mode is
unproportionally weak compared with its Raman counterpart, suggesting that the
charge transfer is ineffective in generating such an "asymmetric" atomic
displacement. When the pump light has the polarization component normal to the
CuO$_2$ plane, the coherent O(4) mode is strongly enhanced compared to the
in-plane excitation, probably by the charge transfer from the apical oxygen to
the Cu-O chains. Our findings demonstrate that the charge transfer excitations
in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ strongly contribute to the electron-phonon
coupling on a femtosecond timescale.

<br>
Granular material in a silo with two openings can display a `flow rate dip',
where a non-monotonic relationship between flow rate and orifice separation
occurs. In this paper we study continuum modelling of the silo with two
openings. We find that the $\mu(I)$ rheology can capture the flow rate dip if
physically relevant friction parameters are used. We also extend the model by
accounting for wall friction, dilatancy, and non-local effects. We find that
accounting for the wall friction using a Hele-Shaw model better replicates the
qualitative characteristics of the flow rate dip seen in experimental data,
while dilatancy and non-local effects have very little effect on the
qualitative characteristics of the mass flow rate dip. However, we find that
all three of these factors have a significant impact on the mass flow rate,
indicating that a continuum model which accurately predicts flow rate will need
to account for these effects.

<br>
The quantum spin liquid (QSL) state has been searched intensively in
Kitaev-like materials, such as the Iridium oxides $A_2$IrO$_3$ and
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. The half-filled Kitaev-Hubbard model with bond dependent
hopping terms is used to describe the Kitaev-like materials, which is
calculated using the state-of-the-art fermionic projected entangled pair states
(fPEPS) method. We find a QSL phase near the Mott insulator transition, which
has a strong first-order transition to the semi-metal phase with the decrease
of Hubbard $U$. We suggest that a promising routine to find the QSL is to find
the Iridium oxides that are near the Mott insulator transitions.

<h3>Partial Equilibration Scenario in 3D athermal martensites quenched below  first-order transition temperatures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01997" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01997</a>
<br>
<i>N. Shankaraiah, K.P.N. Murthy, S.R. Shenoy</i>
<br>
To test a Partial Equilibration Scenario (PES) of Ritort and colleagues, we
do Monte Carlo simulations of discretized-strain spin models, for four 3D
martensitic structural transitions under quenches to a bath temperature $T
<T_0$ below a first-order transition. The ageing system faces entropy barriers,
in {\it searches} for energy-lowering passages between quasi-microcanonical
energy shells. We confirm the PES signature of an exponential-tail distribution
of intermittent heat releases to the bath, scaled in an effective temperature,
that in our case, depends on the quench. When its inverse $\beta_{eff} (T)
\equiv 1/T_{eff} (T) $ vanishes below a `martensite start' temperature $T_1$ of
avalanche conversions, then entropy barriers vanish. When this search
temperature $T_{eff} (T)$ vanishes, PES cooling is arrested, as entropy
barriers diverge. We find a {\it linear} vanishing of $T_{eff}(T)\sim T_d -T$,
below a delay-divergence temperature $T_d$ in between, $T_1 < T_d < T_0$.
Martensitic conversion delays $e^{1/T_{eff}} \sim e^{1/(T_d -T)}$ thus have
Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann like divergences. Post-quench delay data extracted from
simulations and athermal martensitic alloys, are both consistent with
predictions.

<br>
The study of geometrically frustrated magnetic systems with unusual crystal
field ground states offers a possibility of realizing the new aspects of
physics of disordered systems. In this study, we report our results of
structural, magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity measurements, along with
density functional theory calculations on HoVO4; a compound in which the
presence of a distorted kind of HoO8 polyhedral leads to multiple magnetic
interaction paths. The observed broad maximum below 10 K in the temperature
response of DC susceptibility curves implies the presence of short-range
correlations. AC susceptibility rules out the possibility of any kind of spin
freezing. Temperature dependent heat capacity measurement at zero field
indicate towards the absence of long-range ordering, along with the presence of
a broad maximum centered around 14 K. The residual heat capacity exhibits a
characteristic power-law (T{\alpha}) behavior with the exponent {\alpha} nearly
equal to 2, which is analogous to that observed for other 3D quantum spin
liquid systems. The density functional theory calculations signify the presence
of dominant second and third nearest neighbor interactions, which in turn lead
to magnetic frustration in our system. Our investigations suggest that HoVO4
can be a candidate for realizing a 3D quantum spin liquid state.

<h3>Van Vleck paramagnetism and enhancement of effective moment with  magnetic field in rare earth orthovanadate EuVO4</h3>

<br>
The 4f^6 systems were hypothesized to possess non-magnetic (J = 0) ground
state. However, all such systems have distinctly shown the presence of non-zero
effective moment. In this context, a rare earth orthovanadate EuVO4, which in
spite of having J = 0 ground state, possess non-zero magnetic moment. Our
studies reveal three different regions in this compound, boundaries of which
are demarcated from susceptibility data. The high temperature susceptibility
exhibits linear dependence on temperature which arises due to tetragonal
crystal field, followed by a temperature independent plateau like region,
ascribed to Van Vleck paramagnetism. At low temperatures, Curie-Weiss like
behaviour is observed, which arise due to magnetic Eu2+ moments and results in
non-zero effective moment. Our analysis reveals that the separation ({\lambda})
between the J = 0 and J = 1 states decreases on increasing the external
magnetic field which leads to an enhanced effective moment at higher fields.

<br>
The spontaneous formation of electronic orders is a crucial element for
understanding complex quantum states and engineering heterostructures in
two-dimensional materials. We report a novel $\sqrt{19}\times\sqrt{19}$ charge
order in few-layer thick 1T-TaTe$_2$ transition metal dichalcogenide films
grown by molecular beam epitaxy, which has not been realized. Our photoemission
and scanning probe measurements demonstrate that monolayer 1T-TaTe$_2$ exhibits
a variety of metastable charge density wave orders, including the
$\sqrt{19}\times\sqrt{19}$ superstructure, which can be selectively stabilized
by controlling the post-growth annealing temperature. Moreover, we find that
only the $\sqrt{19}\times\sqrt{19}$ order persists in 1T-TaTe$_2$ films thicker
than a monolayer, up to 8 layers. Our findings identify the previously
unrealized novel electronic order in a much-studied transition metal
dichalcogenide and provide a viable route to control it within the epitaxial
growth process.

We propose a highly efficient and accurate numerical scheme named Truncated
Atomic Plane Wave (TAPW) method to determine the subband structure of Twisted
Bilayer Graphene (TBG) inspired by BM model. Our method utilizes real space
information of carbon atoms in the moir\'e unit cell and projects the full
tight binding Hamiltonian into a much smaller subspace using atomic plane
waves. We present accurate electronic band structures of TBG in a wide range of
twist angles together with detailed moir\'e potential and screened Coulomb
interaction at the first magic angle using our new method. Furthermore, we
generalize our formalism to solve the problem of low frequency moir\'e phonons
in TBG.

<br>
CaSb2 is a topological nodal-line semimetal that becomes superconducting
below 1.6 K, providing an ideal platform to investigate the interplay between
topologically nontrivial electronic bands and superconductivity. In this work,
we investigated the superconducting order parameter of CaSb2 by measuring its
magnetic penetration depth change {\Delta}{\lambda}(T) down to 0.07 K, using a
tunneling diode oscillator (TDO) based technique. Well inside the
superconducting state, {\Delta}{\lambda}(T) shows an exponential activated
behavior, and provides direct evidence for a nodeless superconducting gap. By
analyzing the temperature dependence of the superfluid density and the
electronic specific heat, we find both can be consistently described by a
two-gap s-wave model, in line with the presence of multiple Fermi surfaces
associated with distinct Sb sites in this compound. These results demonstrate
fully-gapped superconductivity in CaSb2 and constrain the allowed pairing
symmetry.

<h3>Non-equilibrium dynamics in a three state opinion formation model with  stochastic extreme switches</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02043" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02043</a>
<br>
<i>Kathakali Biswas, Parongama Sen</i>
<br>
We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a three state kinetic exchange
model of opinion formation, where switches between extreme states are possible,
depending on the value of a parameter $q$. The mean field dynamical equations
are derived and analysed for any $q$. The fate of the system under the
evolutionary rules used in \cite{BCS} shows that it is dependent on the value
of $q$ and the initial state in general. For $q=1$, which allows the extreme
switches maximally, a quasi-conservation in the dynamics is obtained which
renders it equivalent to the voter model. For general $q$ values, a "frozen"
disordered fixed point is obtained which acts as an attractor for all initially
disordered states. For other initial states, the order parameter grows with
time $t$ as $\exp[\alpha(q) t]$ where $\alpha = \frac{1-q}{3-q}$ for $q\neq 1$
and follows a power law behaviour for $q=1$. Numerical simulations using a
fully connected agent based model provide additional results like the system
size dependence of the exit probability and consensus times that further
accentuate the different behaviour of the model for $q=1$ and $q\neq 1$. The
results are compared with the non-equilibrium phenomena in other well known
dynamical systems.

<br>
As a system with both profound physics and promising application potentials,
the strain-induced self-assembled semiconductor nanostructures have been
investigated for decades of years. The optical and electrical properties of
this system are mainly determined by the nanostructures, but can be greatly
affected by the generally existent two dimensional structures from which the
nanostructures evolve, the so called wetting layer (WL). The WL configurations
can be varied with different growth conditions, and further influence the
nanostructure morphology and properties. This is a reviewing article
introducing some recent progresses in investigating the evolution of WLs in
InAs/GaAs system with reflectance difference spectroscopy. Different kinds of
WL evolution processes in Stranski-Krastanov growth mode are introduced. The
segregation and desorption of indium atoms and the effect of growth
interruption are mentioned. The existence and the evolution process of wetting
layers in droplet epitaxy method are also discussed.

<h3>Thouless pumping and topology</h3>

<br>
<i>Roberta Citro, Monika Aidelsburger</i>
<br>
Thouless pumping provides one of the simplest manifestations of topology in
quantum systems, and has attracted a lot of recent interest, both theoretically
and experimentally. Since the seminal works by Thouless and Niu in 1983 and
1984, it is argued that the quantization of the pumped charge is robust against
weak disorder, but a clear characterization of the localization properties of
the relevant states, and the breakdown of quantized transport in the presence
of interaction or out of the adiabatic approximation, has been long debated.
Thouless pumping is also the first example of a topological phase emerging in a
periodically-driven system. Driven systems can exhibit exotic topological
phases without any static analogue and have been the subject of many recent
proposals both in fermionic and bosonic systems in diverse platforms ranging
from cold atoms to photonics and condensed matter systems. In this respect,
this review has a twofold purpose: On the one hand, it serves as a basis to
understand the robustness of the topology of slowly-driven systems per se; On
the other hand, it highlights the rich properties of topological pumps and
their diverse range of applications, for instance, in systems with synthetic
dimensions or for understanding higher-order topological phases. These examples
underline the relevance of topological pumping for the fast growing field of
topological quantum matter.

<h3>Direct evidence of a charge depletion region at the interface of Van der  Waals monolayers and dielectric oxides: The case of superconducting FeSe/STO</h3>

<br>

<br>
The discovery of two dimensional Van der Waals materials has opened up
several possibilities for designing novel devices. Yet a more promising way of
designing exotic heterostutures with improved physical properties is to grow a
monolayer of these materials on a substrate. For example, in the field of
superconductivity it has been demonstrated that the superconducting transition
temperature of a monolayer of FeSe grown on some oxide substrates e.g.,
strontium titanate (STO) is by far higher than its bulk counterpart. Although
the system has been considered as a model system for understanding the
phenomenon of high-temperature superconductivity, the physical mechanism
responsible for this high transition temperature is still highly under debate.
Here using momentum and energy resolved high-resolution electron energy-loss
spectroscopy we probe the dynamic charge response of the FeSe/STO(001) system
and demonstrate that the frequency- and momentum-dependent dynamic charge
response is not compatible with a simple film/substrate model. Our analysis
reveals the existence of a depletion region at the interface between this Van
der Waals monolayer and the substrate. The presence of the depletion layer,
accompanied with a considerably large charge transfer from STO into the FeSe
monolayer, leads to a strong renormalization of the STO energy bands and a
substantial band bending at the interface. Our results shed light on the
electronic complexities of the FeSe/oxide interfaces and pave the way of
designing novel low-dimensional high-temperature superconductors through
interface engineering. We anticipate that the observed phenomenon is rather
general and can take place in many two dimensional Van der Waals monolayers
brought in contact with dielectric oxides or semiconducting substrates.

<h3>Impact of substrates and quantum effects on exciton line shapes of 2D  semiconductors at room temperature</h3>

<br>
Exciton resonances in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)
provide exceptionally strong light-matter interaction at room temperature.
Their spectral line shape is critical in the design of a myriad of
optoelectronic devices, ranging from solar cells to quantum information
processing. However, disorder resulting from static inhomogeneities and
dynamical fluctuations can significantly impact the line shape. Many recent
works experimentally evaluate the optical properties of TMD monolayers placed
on a substrate and the line shape is typically linked directly to the
material's quality. Here, we highlight that the interference of the substrate
and TMD reflections can strongly influence the line shape. We further show how
basic, room-temperature reflection measurement allow investigation of the
quantum mechanical exciton dynamics by systematically controlling the substrate
reflection with index-matching oils. By removing the substrate contribution
with a properly chosen oil, we can extract the excitonic decay rates including
the quantum mechanical dephasing rate. The results provide valuable guidance
for the engineering of exciton line shapes in layered nanophotonic systems.

<h3>Fraunhofer pattern in the presence of Majorana zero modes</h3>

<br>
Majorana bound states (MBSs) emerge as zero energy excitations in topological
superconductors. At zero temperature, their presence gives a quantized
conductance in NS junctions and a fractional Josephson effect in Josephson
junctions when the parity is conserved. However, most of current experiments
deviate from the theoretical predictions, yielding for example a non-quantized
conductance or the absence of only few odd Shapiro steps. Although these
results might be compatible with a topological ground state, it is also
possible that a trivial scenario can mimic similar results, by means of
accidental zero energy Andreev bound states (ZEABS) or simply by non-adiabatic
transitions between trivial Andreev bound states. Here, we propose a new
platform to investigate signatures of the presence of MBSs in the Fraunhofer
pattern of Josephson junctions featuring quantum spin Hall edge states on the
normal part and Majorana bound states at the NS interfaces. We use a
tight-binding model to demonstrate a change in periodicity of the Fraunhofer
pattern when comparing trivial and non-trivial regimes. We explain these
results in terms of local and crossed Andreev bound states, which due to the
spin-momentum locking, accumulate different magnetic flux and therefore become
distinguishable in the Fraunhofer periodicity. Furthermore, we introduce a
scattering model that captures the main results of the microscopic calculations
with MBSs and extend our discussion to the main differences found using
accidental ZEABS.

F$_{1}$-ATPase is a rotary molecular motor that \emph{in vivo} is subject to
strong nonequilibrium driving forces. There is great interest in understanding
the operational principles governing its high efficiency of free-energy
transduction. Here we use a near-equilibrium framework to design a non-trivial
control protocol to minimize dissipation in rotating F$_{1}$ to synthesize ATP.
We find that the designed protocol requires much less work than a naive
(constant-velocity) protocol across a wide range of protocol durations. Our
analysis points to a possible mechanism for energetically efficient driving of
F$_{1}$ \emph{in vivo} and provides insight into free-energy transduction for a
broader class of biomolecular and synthetic machines.

<br>
High-temperature cuprate superconductors-based van der Waals heterostructures
hold high technological promise. One of the obstacles hindering progress is the
detrimental effect of disorder on the properties of Josephson junctions (JJ)
realized by the vdW devices. Here we report the new method of fabricating
twisted vdW heterostructures made of Bi2Sr2CuCa2O8+d, crucially improving the
JJ characteristics, pushing them up to those of the intrinsic JJs in bulk
samples. The method combines a cryogenic stacking using a solvent-free stencil
mask technique and covering interface by the insulating hexagonal boron nitride
crystals. Despite the high-vacuum condition down to 10-6 mbar in the
evaporation chamber, the interface appears to be protected from water molecules
during the in-situ metal deposition only when fully encapsulated. Comparing the
current-voltage curves of encapsulated and unencapsulated interfaces, we reveal
that the encapsulated interfaces' characteristics are crucially improved so
that the corresponding JJs demonstrate high critical currents and sharpness of
the superconducting transition comparable to those of the intrinsic JJs.
Finally, we show that the encapsulated heterostructures are more stable in
time.

Gibbs-Thompson effect is the general term referring to the influence of
interfaces on the course of phase transformations such as precipitation or
solidification. Whilst attention is most often focused on the Gibbs-Thomson
effect on nucleation, growth and coarsening, the present study considers the
reverse process of precipitate dissolution in a nickel-base superalloy during
in situ TEM observation. The presence of several distinct populations of
gamma-prime precipitates (primary, secondary, tertiary and grain boundary)
allows the differences due to particle size to be quantified and interpreted.
Important implications arise for the selection of heat treatment schedules for
nickel-base superalloys and other alloy systems.

<h3>Surface State of Inter-orbital Pairing State in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$  Superconductor</h3>

<br>
We study the (001) surface state of a recently proposed $E_g$ symmetry
inter-orbital-odd spin-triplet s-wave superconducting (SC) state in
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ (SRO). We confirm that this pair potential is transformed into a
chiral $d$-wave pair potential and a pseudo-Zeeman field in the band basis for
a low-energy range. Due to the chiral $d$-wave pair potential, the surface
states appear near zero energy in the momentum range enclosed by the nodal
lines of the chiral d-wave pair potential for each band at the (001) surface.
Nevertheless, the pseudo-Zeeman field gives band splitting of the surface
states, and its splitting energy is much smaller than the SC energy gap. The
local density of states (LDOS) at the (001) surface of the SC state has a
pronounced peak structure at zero energy due to the surface states near zero
energy when the order of the resolution is lower than the splitting energy.
This peak structure is robust under perturbations, such as an orbital Rashba
coupling or an $E_u$ SC pair potential at the surface.

Defects and impurities strongly affect the timing and the character of the
(re)ordering or disordering transitions of thermodynamic systems captured in
metastable states. In this paper we analyze the case of two-dimensional
magnetic systems. We adapt the classical JMAK theory to account for the effects
of defects on the free energy barriers, the critical droplet area and the
associated metastable time. The resulting predictions are successfully tested
against the Monte-Carlo simulations performed by adopting Glauber dynamics, to
obtain reliable time-dependent results during the out-of-equilibrium
transformations. We also focus on finite-size effects, and study how the
spinodal line (separating the single-droplet from the multi-droplet regime)
depends on the system size, the defect fraction, and the external field.

<i>Shintaro Hoshino, Michi-To Suzuki, Hiroaki Ikeda</i>
<br>
In solid state physics, any phase transition is commonly observed as a change
in the microscopic distribution of charge, spin, or current. Here we report the
nature of an exotic order parameter inherent in the localized electron orbitals
that cannot be primarily captured by these three fundamental quantities. This
order parameter is described as the electric toroidal multipoles connecting
different total angular momenta under the spin-orbit coupling. The
corresponding microscopic physical quantity is the spin current tensor on an
atomic scale, which induces spin-derived electric polarization and the
chirality of the Dirac equation. We stress that the chirality intrinsic to the
elementary particle is the essence of electric toroidal multipoles. These
findings link microscopic spin currents and chirality in the Dirac theory to
the concept of multipoles and provide a new perspective for quantum states of
matter.

<br>
We theoretically study the optical conductivity of the tightbinding model
which has two types of the hopping integrals arranged in the Fibonacci
sequence. Due to the lack of the translational symmetry, many peak structures
appear in the optical conductivity as well as the density of states. When the
ratio of two hopping integrals is large, the self-similar structure appears in
the optical conductivity. This implies that the optical response between the
high-energy bands is related to that within the low-energy bands, which should
originate from critical behavior in the wave functions. The effects of
disorders on the optical conductivity are also analyzed in order to show the
absence of the self-similarity in the tightbinding model with the random
sequence.

<br>
Low-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) exhibit great
photocatalytic performance and tunability. In this work, using first-principles
simulations based on density functional theory (DFT), we demonstrate that
external electric bias can be employed to further improve the photocatalytic
hydrogen production efficiency of the six AB$_{2}$ (A=Mo, W and B=S, Se, Te)
TMDC monolayers by exploiting their piezoelectric response. In particular, when
subjected to a proper amount of electrically induced tensile biaxial strain,
most TMDC monolayers turn into potentially ideal photocatalyst towards the
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The beneficial effects of introducing
tensile biaxial strain on the TMDC monolayers are not limited to the reduction
of the band gap and proper adjustment of the band edge positions, but also to
the modification of the H adsorption free energy in such a way that the HER
reaction is noticeably favored.

techniques to characterize chemical bonding at surfaces and are often used to
identify the strength and nature of adsorbate-substrate interactions. In this
study, we judge the ability of x-ray spectroscopic techniques to identify
different regimes of chemical bonding at metal-organic interfaces. To achieve
this, we sample different interaction strength regimes in a comprehensive and
systematic way by comparing two topological isomers, azulene and naphthalene,
adsorbed on three metal substrates with varying reactivity, namely the (111)
facets of Ag, Cu, and Pt. Using density functional theory, we simulate
core-level binding energies and x-ray absorption spectra of the molecular
carbon species. The simulated spectra reveal three distinct characteristics
based on the molecule-specific spectral features which we attribute to types of
surface chemical bonding with varying strength. We find that weak physisorption
only leads to minor changes compared to the gas-phase spectra, weak
chemisorption leads to charge transfer and significant spectral changes, while
strong chemisorption leads to a loss of the molecule-specific features in the
spectra. The classification we provide is aimed at assisting interpretation of
experimental x-ray spectra for complex metal-organic interfaces.

Y$_{0.9}$Gd$_{0.1}$Fe$_{2}$, which crystallizes in a C15 cubic structure, can
absorb up to 5 H/f.u. and its pressure-composition isotherm displays a
multiplateau behavior related to the existence of several hydrides with
different crystal structures. At room temperature
Y$_{0.9}$Gd$_{0.1}$Fe$_{2}$H$_{x}$ hydrides (2.9 $\le$ x $\le$ 5) crystallize
in three phases with cubic structure (C1, C2 and C3), two phases with
monoclinic structures (M1 and M2), and one phase with orthorhombic structure
(O), with the following sequence for increasing H concentration: C1, M1, C2,
M2, C3, O. Each phase exists as single phase within a H homogeneity range, and
they are separated from each other by two-phase domains. The reductions of
crystal symmetry are related to various hydrogen orders into interstitial
sites. Weak superstructure peaks were indexed by doubling the cubic cell
parameter of the cubic C2 phase. Upon heating, the monoclinic M1 and M2 and the
cubic C2 phases undergo order-disorder (O-D) transitions toward a disordered
cubic structure CDis. These O-D transitions are reversible with thermal
hysteresis effects. The cubic C3 and orthorhombic O phases transform into a
disordered cubic phase accompanied by H desorption.

<h3>Bayesian optimization of discrete dislocation plasticity of  two-dimensional precipitation hardened crystals</h3>

<br>
<i>Mika Sarvilahti, Lasse Laurson</i>
<br>
Discovering relationships between materials' microstructures and mechanical
properties is a key goal of materials science. Here, we outline a strategy
exploiting Bayesian optimization to efficiently search the multidimensional
space of microstructures, defined here by the size distribution of precipitates
(fixed impurities or inclusions acting as obstacles for dislocation motion)
within a simple two-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics model. The aim is
to design a microstructure optimizing a given mechanical property, e.g.,
maximizing the expected value of shear stress for a given strain. The problem
of finding the optimal discretized shape for a distribution involves a norm
constraint, and we find that sampling the space of possible solutions should be
done in a specific way in order to avoid convergence problems. To this end, we
propose a general mathematical approach that can be used to generate trial
solutions uniformly at random while enforcing an Euclidean norm constraint.
Both equality and inequality constraints are considered. A simple technique can
then be used to convert between Euclidean and other Lebesgue $p$-norm (the
1-norm in particular) constrained representations. Considering different
dislocation-precipitate interaction potentials, we demonstrate the convergence
of the algorithm to the optimal solution and discuss its possible extensions to
the more complex and realistic case of three-dimensional dislocation systems
where also the optimization of precipitate shapes could be considered.

<br>
We investigated magnetic vortices in two stoichiometric LiFeAs samples by
means of scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. The vortices were
revealed by measuring the local electronic density of states (LDOS) at zero
bias conductance of samples in magnetic fields between 0.5 and 12 T. From
single vortex spectroscopy we extract the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length of
both samples as $4.4\pm0.5$ nm and $4.1\pm0.5$ nm, in accordance with previous
findings. However, in contrast to previous reports, our study reveals that the
reported hexagonal to square-like vortex lattice transition is absent up to 12
T both in field-cooling and zero-field-cooling processes. Remarkably, a highly
ordered zero field cooled hexagonal vortex lattice is observed up to 8 T. We
argue that several factors are likely to determine the structure of the vortex
lattice in LiFeAs such as (i) details of the cooling procedure (ii) sample
stoichiometry that alters the formation of nematic fluctuations, (iii) details
of the order parameter and (iv) magnetoelastic coupling.

<h3>Magnetic, structural and magnetocaloric properties of  Y$_{0.9}$Gd$_{0.1}$Fe$_{2}$H$_{x}$ hydrides</h3>

<br>
At 300 K, Y$_{0.9}$Gd$_{0.1}$Fe$_{2}$H$_{x}$ hydrides crystallize
sequentially with increasing H concentration in various structures related to a
lowering of the cubic MgCu$_{2}$ type structure of the parent alloy: cubic C1,
monoclinic M1, cubic C2, monoclinic M2, cubic C3, orthorhombic O. Above 300 K,
they undergo a first-order transition at a T$_{O-D}$ temperature driven by
order-disorder of hydrogen atoms into interstitial sites. Their magnetic,
structural and magnetocaloric properties have been investigated through
magnetic measurements, and high-resolution synchrotron diffraction experiments.
The magnetization at 5 K decreases slightly from 4 to 3.8 ${\mu}_{B}$ for x = 3
to 3.9 H f.u., then with a larger slope for higher H content. A discontinuous
decrease of the magnetic transition temperature is observed: M1 and C2 hydrides
are ferrimagnetic with T$_{C}$ near 300 K, M2 hydride displays a sharp
ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic transition at T$_{FM-AFM}$ =144 K, whereas C3
and O hydrides present only a sharp increase of the magnetization below 15 K
and a weak magnetization up to RT. Negative magnetic entropy variations
(${\Delta}$S$_{M}$) are measured near T$_{C}$ for the M1 and C2 phases, near
T$_{FM-AFM}$ for the M2 phase, whereas positive ${\Delta}$S$_{M}$ peaks due to
inverse MCE effect are found near T$_{O-D}$. A structural and magnetic phase
diagram is proposed.

<h3>Chemical diffusion master equation: formulations of reaction--diffusion  processes on the molecular level</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02268" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02268</a>
<br>
<i>Mauricio J. del Razo, Stefanie Winkelmann, Rupert Klein, Felix Höfling</i>
<br>
The chemical diffusion master equation (CDME) describes the probabilistic
dynamics of reaction--diffusion systems at the molecular level [del Razo et
al., Lett. Math. Phys. 112:49, 2022]; it can be considered the master equation
for reaction--diffusion processes. The CDME consists of an infinite ordered
family of Fokker--Planck equations, where each level of the ordered family
corresponds to a certain number of particles and each particle represents a
molecule. The equations at each level describe the spatial diffusion of the
corresponding set of particles, and they are coupled to each other via reaction
operators --linear operators representing chemical reactions. These operators
change the number of particles in the system, and thus transport probability
between different levels in the family. In this work, we present three
approaches to formulate the CDME and show the relations between them. We
further deduce the non-trivial combinatorial factors contained in the reaction
operators, and we elucidate the relation to the original formulation of the
CDME, which is based on creation and annihilation operators acting on
many-particle probability density functions. Finally we discuss applications to
multiscale simulations of biochemical systems among other future prospects.

<h3>Detection of long-range orbital-Hall torques</h3>

<br>
We report and quantify a large orbital-Hall torque generated by Nb and Ru,
which we identify from a strong dependence of torques on the ferromagnets. This
is manifested as a sign reversal and strong enhancement in the damping-like
torques measured in Nb (or Ru)/Ni bilayers as compared to Nb (or Ru)/FeCoB
bilayers. The long-range nature of orbital transport in the ferromagnet is
revealed by the thickness dependences of Ni in Nb (or Ru)/Ni bilayers which are
markedly different from the regular spin absorption in the ferromagnet that
takes place within a few angstroms and thus it uniquely distinguishes the
orbital Hall torque from the spin Hall torque.

<h3>Particle zoo in a doped spin chain: Correlated states of mesons and  magnons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02320" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02320</a>
<br>
<i>Petar Čubela, Annabelle Bohrdt, Markus Greiner, Fabian Grusdt</i>
<br>
It is a widely accepted view that the interplay of spin- and charge-degrees
of freedom in doped antiferromagnets (AFMs) gives rise to the rich physics of
high-temperature superconductors. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how
effective low-energy degrees of freedom and the corresponding field theories
emerge from microscopic models, including the $t-J$ and Hubbard Hamiltonians. A
promising view comprises that the charge carriers have a rich internal parton
structure on intermediate scales, but the interplay of the emergent partons
with collective magnon excitations of the surrounding AFM remains unexplored.
Here we study a doped one-dimensional spin chain in a staggered magnetic field
and demonstrate that it supports a zoo of various long-lived excitations. These
include magnons; mesonic pairs of spinons and chargons, along with their
ro-vibrational excitations; and tetra-parton bound states of mesons and
magnons. We identify these types of quasiparticles in various spectra using
DMRG simulations. Moreover, we introduce a strong-coupling theory describing
the polaronic dressing and molecular binding of mesons to collective magnon
excitations. The effective theory can be solved by standard tools developed for
polaronic problems, and can be extended to study similar physics in
two-dimensional doped AFMs in the future. Experimentally, the doped spin-chain
in a staggered field can be directly realized in quantum gas microscopes.

<h3>Pairing of holes by confining strings in antiferromagnets</h3>

<br>
<i>Fabian Grusdt, Eugene Demler, Annabelle Bohrdt</i>
<br>
In strongly correlated quantum materials, the behavior of charge carriers is
dominated by strong electron-electron interactions. These can lead to
insulating states with spin order, and upon doping to competing ordered states
including unconventional superconductivity. The underlying pairing mechanism
remains poorly understood however, even in strongly simplified theoretical
models. Recent advances in quantum simulation allow to study pairing in
paradigmatic settings, e.g. in the $t-J$ and $t-J_z$ Hamiltonians. Even there,
the most basic properties of paired states of only two dopants, such as their
dispersion relation and excitation spectra, remain poorly studied in many
cases. Here we provide new analytical insights into a possible string-based
pairing mechanism of mobile holes in an antiferromagnet. We analyze an
effective model of partons connected by a confining string and calculate the
spectral properties of bound states. Our model is equally relevant for
understanding Hubbard-Mott excitons consisting of a bound doublon-hole pair or
confined states of dynamical matter in lattice gauge theories, which motivates
our study of different parton statistics. Although an accurate semi-analytic
estimation of binding energies is challenging, our theory provides a detailed
understanding of the internal structure of pairs. For example, in a range of
settings we predict heavy states of immobile pairs with flat-band dispersions
-- including for the lowest-energy $d$-wave pair of fermions. Our findings shed
new light on the long-standing question about the origin of pairing and
competing orders in high-temperature superconductors.

<br>
A key step in unraveling the mysteries of materials exhibiting unconventional
superconductivity is to understand the underlying pairing mechanism. While it
is widely agreed upon that the pairing glue in many of these systems originates
from antiferromagnetic spin correlations, a microscopic description of pairs of
charge carriers remains lacking. Here we use state-of-the art numerical methods
to probe the internal structure and dynamical properties of pairs of charge
carriers in quantum antiferromagnets in four-legged cylinders. Exploiting the
full momentum resolution in our simulations, we are able to distinguish two
qualitatively different types of bound states: a highly mobile, meta-stable
pair, which has a dispersion proportional to the hole hopping $t$, and a heavy
pair, which can only move due to spin exchange processes and turns into a flat
band in the Ising limit of the model. Understanding the pairing mechanism can
on the one hand pave the way to boosting binding energies in related models,
and on the other hand enable insights into the intricate competition of various
phases of matter in strongly correlated electron systems.

Bottom-up assembly of optically nonlinear and magnetically anisotropic
lanthanide materials involving precisely placed spin carriers and optimized
metal-ligand coordination offers a potential route to developing electronic
architectures for coherent radiation generation and spin-based technologies,
but the chemical design historically has been extremely hard to achieve. To
address this, we developed a worthwhile avenue for creating new
noncentrosymmetric chiral Ln3+ materials Ln2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2 (Ln = Sm, Dy,
Yb) by mixed-ligand design. The materials exhibit phase-matching nonlinear
optical responses, elucidating the feasibility of the heteroanionic strategy.
Ln2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2 displays paramagnetic property with strong magnetic
anisotropy facilitated by large spin-orbit coupling. This study demonstrates a
new chemical pathway for creating previously unknown polar chiral magnets with
multiple functionalities.

<h3>Cavity control of the metal-to-insulator transition in 1T-TaS$_{2}$</h3>

<br>
The hybridization between light and matter in the strong and weak coupling
regime, which can be obtained by placing materials into optical cavities
resonant to different material excitations, can determine the onset of
macroscopic functionalities which are proper of the "light-matter" hybrids and
are different from those of its constituents. We show here the experimental
evidence of the reversible control of the metal-to-insulator phase transition
in the correlated dichalcogenide charge density wave 1T-TaS$_{2}$ embedded in
low energy Terahertz cavities. We reveal that, while long wavelength cavities
(up to ~ 25 GHz) favour the metallic phase, the coupling with cavities at
higher frequencies results in a stabilization of the insulating charge density
wave phase. Overall, for the present setting the measured critical temperature
associated to the metal-to-insulator transition in 1T-TaS$_{2}$ can be shifted
by more than 70 K by tuning the cavity resonant frequency. Such a giant
modification overcomes the intrinsic hysteresis in the material and enables a
reversible touchless control of the metal-to-insulator phase transition. A
switch between conductive and insulating behaviour is obtained by mechanically
tuning the distance between the cavity mirrors and their alignment. Our finding
and the indication that cavity modes can couple to charged domain wall
fluctuations, and thereby selectively affect the properties of the conductive
state, uncover a new path to control the macroscopic transport properties of
quantum materials by changing their electromagnetic environment.

<h3>Twisted bilayered graphenes at magic angles and Casimir interactions:  correlation-driven effects</h3>

<i>Pablo Rodriguez-Lopez, Dai-Nam Le, María J. Calderón, Elena Bascones, Lilia M. Woods</i>
<br>
Twisted bilayered graphenes at magic angles are systems housing long ranged
periodicity of Moir\'e pattern together with short ranged periodicity
associated with the individual graphenes. Such materials are a fertile ground
for novel states largely driven by electronic correlations. Here we find that
the ubiquitous Casimir force can serve as a platform for macroscopic
manifestations of the quantum effects stemming from the magic angle bilayered
graphenes properties and their phases determined by electronic correlations. By
utilizing comprehensive calculations for the electronic and optical response,
we find that Casimir torque can probe anisotropy from the Drude conductivities
in nematic states, while repulsion in the Casimir force can help identify
topologically nontrivial phases in magic angle twisted bilayered graphenes.

In this paper, we investigate how the temperature calculated from the
microcanonical entropy compares with the canonical temperature, for finite
isolated quantum systems accessible to numerical exact diagonalization. We thus
characterize the deviations from ensemble equivalence at finite sizes. We
describe multiple ways to compute the microcanonical entropy, and present
numerical results for the entropy and temperature computed in these various
ways. We show that using an energy window whose width has a particular energy
dependence, results in a temperature that has minimal deviations from the
canonical temperature.

<h3>Structure of saturated RSA ellipse packings</h3>

<br>
<i>Pedro Abritta, Robert S. Hoy</i>
<br>
Motivated by the recent observation of liquid glass in suspensions of
ellipsoidal colloids, we examine the structure of (asymptotically) saturated
RSA ellipse packings. We determine the packing fractions $\phi_{\rm s}(\alpha)$
to high precision, finding an analytic expression that predicts $\phi_{\rm
s}(\alpha)$ to within less than $0.1\%$ for all $\alpha \leq 10$. Then we
explore how these packings' positional-orientational order varies with
$\alpha$. We find a transition from tip/side- to side/side-contact-dominated
structure at $\alpha = \alpha_{\rm TS} \simeq 2.4$. At this aspect ratio, the
peak value $g_{\rm max}$ of packings' positional-orientational paircorrelation
functions is minimal, and systems can be considered maximally disordered. For
smaller (larger) $\alpha$, $g_{\rm max}$ increases exponentially with deceasing
(increasing) $\alpha$. Local nematic order and structures comparable to the
precursor domains observed in experiments gradually emerge as $\alpha$
increases beyond $3$. For $\alpha \gtrsim 5$, single-layer lamellae become more
prominent, and long-wavelength density fluctuations increase with $\alpha$ as
packings gradually approach the rod-like limit.

<h3>Percolation properties of the neutron population in nuclear reactors</h3>

<br>
Reactor physics aims at studying the neutron population in a reactor core
under the influence of feedback mechanisms, such as the Doppler temperature
effect. Numerical schemes to calculate macroscopic properties emerging from
such coupled stochastic systems however require to define intermediate
quantities (e.g. the temperature field), which are bridging the gap between the
stochastic neutron field and the deterministic feedback. By interpreting the
branching random walk of neutrons in fissile media under the influence of a
feedback mechanism as a directed percolation process and by leveraging on the
statistical field theory of birth death processes, we will build a stochastic
model of neutron transport theory and of reactor physics. The critical
exponents of this model, combined to the analysis of the resulting field
equation involving a fractional Laplacian will show that the critical diffusion
equation cannot adequately describe the spatial distribution of the neutron
population and shifts instead to a critical super-diffusion equation. The
analysis of this equation will reveal that non-negligible departure from mean
field behavior might develop in reactor cores, questioning the attainable
accuracy of the numerical schemes currently used by the nuclear industry.

<br>
We study Bose-Hubbard models in a family of diamond necklace lattices with
$n$ central sites. The single-particle spectrum of these models presents
compact localized states (CLSs) that occupy the up and down sites of each
diamond. By performing an appropriate basis rotation, the fragmentation of the
many-boson Hilbert space becomes apparent in the adjacency graph of the
Hamiltonian, showing disconnected sub-sectors with a wide range of dimensions.
The models present a conserved quantity related to the occupation of the
single-particle CLSs that uniquely identifies the different sub-sectors of the
many-boson Hilbert space. Due to the fragmentation of the Hilbert space, the
entanglement spectrum of the system presents a nested-dome structure. We find
weak thermalization through sub-sector-restricted entanglement evolution and a
wide range of entanglement entropy scalings from area-law to logarithmic
growth. Additionally, we observe how the distinguishability between the
different domes increases with the number of central sites and we explain the
mechanism behind this fact by analyzing the graph structure of the Hamiltonian.

<br>
In the recent study of the metal-insulator transition (MIT) in the disordered
crystalline solid SrNbO$_{3-x}$N$_x$ by Daichi Oka et al. [Commun. Phys. 4, 269
(2021)], the data evaluation relies on the Al'tshuler-Aronov theory of the
interference of electron-electron interaction and elastic impurity scattering
of electrons. The present comment shows that this evaluation approach is
inappropriate. For that aim, we reconsider data for the samples with $x = 0.96$
and $x = 1.02$ from three different perspectives: (i) analysis of the
logarithmic temperature derivative of the conductivity, (ii) study of the
deviations of the measured conductivity data from the Al'tshuler-Aronov
approximation of the temperature dependence, and (iii) comparison of the
measured temperature data with the values obtained treating the sample as
secondary thermometer in terms of that approximation.
This way, for the sample with $x = 0.96$, classified as metallic by Daichi
Oka et al., qualitative contradictions between the measurements and the
zero-temperature extrapolation according to the Al'tshuler-Aronov theory are
uncovered. Thus, this sample very likely exhibits activated instead of metallic
conduction. In consequence, our findings question the continuity of the MIT
resulting from the highly cited scaling theory of localization.

<h3>Quantifying hole-motion-induced frustration in doped antiferromagnets by  Hamiltonian reconstruction</h3>

<br>
Unveiling the microscopic origins of quantum phases dominated by the
interplay of spin and motional degrees of freedom constitutes one of the
central challenges in strongly correlated many-body physics. When holes move
through an antiferromagnetic spin background, they displace the positions of
spins, which in turn induces effective frustration in the magnetic environment.
However, a concrete characterization of this effect in a quantum many-body
system is still an unsolved problem. Here we introduce a Hamiltonian
reconstruction scheme that allows for a precise quantification of
hole-motion-induced frustration. In particular, we access non-local correlation
functions through projective measurements of the many-body state, from which
effective spin-Hamiltonians can be recovered after detaching the magnetic
background from dominant charge fluctuations. The scheme is applied to systems
of mixed dimensionality, where holes are restricted to move in one dimension
(1D), but $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ superexchange is two-dimensional (2D). We
demonstrate that hole motion drives the spin background into a highly
frustrated spin liquid regime, reminiscent of Anderson's resonating valence
bond paradigm in doped cuprates. We exemplify the direct applicability of the
reconstruction scheme to ultracold atom experiments by recovering effective
spin-Hamiltonians of experimentally obtained 1D Fermi-Hubbard snapshots. Our
method can be generalized to fully 2D systems, enabling an unprecedented
microscopic perspective on the doped Hubbard model.

<h3>Anomaly of $(2+1)$-Dimensional Symmetry-Enriched Topological Order from  $(3+1)$-Dimensional Topological Quantum Field Theory</h3>

<i>Weicheng Ye, Liujun Zou</i>
<br>
Symmetry acting on a (2+1)$D$ topological order can be anomalous in the sense
that they possess an obstruction to being realized as a purely (2+1)$D$ on-site
symmetry. In this paper, we develop a (3+1)$D$ topological quantum field theory
to calculate the anomaly indicators of a (2+1)$D$ topological order with a
general finite group symmetry $G$, which may contain anti-unitary elements
and/or permute anyons. These anomaly indicators are partition functions of the
(3+1)$D$ topological quantum field theory on a specific manifold equipped with
some $G$-bundle, and they are expressed using the data characterizing the
topological order and the symmetry actions. Combined with the relative anomaly
formalism, our framework actually enables us to calculate the anomaly of a
given topological order with a fully general symmetry. Our framework is applied
to derive the anomaly indicators for various symmetry groups, including
$\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_2^T\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$, etc,
where $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ denote a unitary and anti-unitary
order-2 group, respectively.
