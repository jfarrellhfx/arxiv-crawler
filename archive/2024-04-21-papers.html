<h3>Exciton-polariton ring Josephson junction</h3>

<p>The macroscopic coherence of quantum fluids enables for the observation of
interference effects in their wavefunctions and leads to practical applications
based on Josephson tunnelling such as superconductor quantum interference
devices. The Josephson effect manifests in both fermionic and bosonic systems
and it has been extensively studied in superfluid helium and atomic
Bose-Einstein condensates. Exciton-polaritons can facilitate the transition to
integrated semiconductor platforms, but realizing weak links in ring geometries
has proven to be challenging. Here we realize a Josephson junction in a
polariton ring condensate and, leveraging the optical control of the barrier,
we impose a net circulation around the ring. Our experiments reveal two
distinct regimes of the polariton weak link: a hydrodynamic regime with a
linear relation between the phase jump at the barrier and the average current
around the ring, and a Josephson regime characterised by a sinusoidal behaviour
for which the mass transport through the barrier drops to zero. Our theory in
terms of the 'tilted washboard' potential explains the appearance of these
regimes from energy considerations using experimental values. These findings
show that weak links in ring condensates can be investigated using all-optical
configurations and hold potential for exploration even at room temperature.

<h3>Interpreting neural operators: how nonlinear waves propagate in  non-reciprocal solids</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12918" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12918</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jonathan Colen, Alexis Poncet, Denis Bartolo, Vincenzo Vitelli</i>
<p>We present a data-driven pipeline for model building that combines
interpretable machine learning, hydrodynamic theories, and microscopic models.
The goal is to uncover the underlying processes governing nonlinear dynamics
experiments. We exemplify our method with data from microfluidic experiments
where crystals of streaming droplets support the propagation of nonlinear waves
absent in passive crystals. By combining physics-inspired neural networks,
known as neural operators, with symbolic regression tools, we generate the
solution, as well as the mathematical form, of a nonlinear dynamical system
that accurately models the experimental data. Finally, we interpret this
continuum model from fundamental physics principles. Informed by machine
learning, we coarse grain a microscopic model of interacting droplets and
discover that non-reciprocal hydrodynamic interactions stabilise and promote
nonlinear wave propagation.

<h3>Hydrodynamic Attractor in Ultracold Atoms</h3>

<p>The hydrodynamic attractor is a concept that describes universal
equilibration behavior in which systems lose microscopic details before
hydrodynamics becomes applicable. We propose a setup to observe hydrodynamic
attractors in ultracold atomic gases, taking advantage of the fact that driving
the two-body $s$-wave scattering length causes phenomena equivalent to
isotropic fluid expansions. We specifically consider two-component fermions
with contact interactions in three dimensions and discuss their dynamics under
a power-law drive of the scattering length in a uniform system, employing a
hydrodynamic relaxation model. We analytically solve their dynamics and find
the hydrodynamic attractor solution. Our results establish the cold atom
systems as a new platform for exploring hydrodynamic attractors.

<h3>Reclassification of thermal equilibrium phase transitions in  thermodynamic limit systems</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12393" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12393</a>
<br>
</p><i>Lai Wei, Li-Li Zhang, Yi-Neng Huang</i>
<p>For relaxor-ferroelectrics and relaxor-ferromagnets, Ehrenfest classification
of phase transitions based on the discontinuity of entropy or specific heat
etc. with temperature (T) gives no transition that contradicts the measured
order parameter, i.e. spontaneous polarization and magnetization, at low
temperatures, while Landau classification based on the minimum derivative of
the order parameter to T raises the question about the relationships between
the phase transition and the specific heat peak above and near the transition
temperature. Here, based on the free energy of the thermodynamic limit systems
with T when the external field tends to 0, thermal equilibrium phase
transitions are reclassified into three categories, i.e. 1) First-order phase
transition, 2) Second-order phase transition, and 3) Diffuse phase transition,
naturally giving the the relation of the phase transition to the specific heat
peak. Deep analyses indicate that the classification of this paper is based on
both the long-range and short-range correlation orders of the systems, while
the Ehrenfest's or Landau's independently on the short-range or long-range
order, respectively.

<h3>Semitransparent perovskite solar cells with an evaporated ultra-thin  perovskite absorber</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12410" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12410</a>
<br>
</p><i>Zongbao Zhang, Ran Ji, Xiangkun Jia, Shu-Jen Wang, Marielle Deconinck, Elena Siliavka, Yana Vaynzof</i>
<p>Metal halide perovskites are of great interest for application in
semitransparent solar cells due to their tunable bandgap and high performance.
However, fabricating high-efficiency perovskite semitransparent devices with
high average visible transmittance (AVT) is challenging because of their high
absorption coefficient. Here, we adopt a co-evaporation process to fabricate
ultrathin CsPbI3 perovskite films. Due to the smooth surface and orientated
crystal growth of the evaporated perovskite films, we are able to achieve 10 nm
thin films with compact and continuous morphology without pinholes. When
integrated into a p-i-n device structure of
glass/ITO/PTAA/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Al/Ag with an optimized transparent
electrode, these ultrathin layers result in an impressive open-circuit voltage
(VOC) of 1.08 V and a fill factor (FF) of 80%. Consequently, a power conversion
efficiency of 3.6% with an AVT above 50% is demonstrated, achieved in the 10 nm
semitransparent perovskite solar cells, which is the first report for a
perovskite device of 10 nm active layer with higher VOC, FF and AVT. These
findings demonstrate that evaporation process is a possible way for compact
ultrathin perovskite film, which has the potential for future smart windows,
light emitting diodes, and tandem device applications.

<h3>Alloyed Re$_x$Mo$_{1-x}$S$_2$ Nanoflakes with Enlarged Interlayer  Distances for Hydrogen Evolution</h3>

<p>Molybdenum sulfide (MoS$_2$) has attracted significant attention due to its
great potential as a low-cost and efficient catalyst for the hydrogen evolution
reaction. Developing a facile, easily upscalable, and inexpensive approach to
produce catalytically active nanostructured MoS$_2$ with a high yield would
significantly advance its practical application. Colloidal synthesis offers
several advantages over other preparation techniques to overcome the low
reaction yield of exfoliation and drawbacks of expensive equipment and
processes used in chemical vapor deposition. In this work, we report an
efficient synthesis of alloyed Re$_x$Mo$_{1-x}$S$_2$ nanoflakes with an
enlarged interlayer distance, among which the composition
Re$_{0.55}$Mo$_{0.45}$S$_2$ exhibits excellent catalytic performance with
overpotentials as low as 79 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a small Tafel slope of 42
mV/dec. Density functional theory calculations prove that enlarging the
distance between layers in the Re$_x$Mo$_{1-x}$S$_2$alloy can greatly improve
its catalytic performance due to a significantly reduced free energy of
hydrogen adsorption. The developed approach paves the way to design advanced
transition metal dichalcogenide-based catalysts for hydrogen evolution and to
promote their large-scale practical application.

<h3>Band theory for heterostructures with interface superlattices</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12420" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12420</a>
<br>
</p><i>Bernhard Putzer, Lucas V. Pupim, Mathias S. Scheurer</i>
<p>Motivated by recent experiments demonstrating the creation of atomically
sharp interfaces between hexagonal sapphire and cubic SrTiO$_3$ with finite
twist, we here develop and study a general electronic band theory for this
novel class of moir\'e heterostructures. We take into account the
three-dimensional nature of the two crystals, allow for arbitrary combinations
of Bravais lattices, finite twist angles, and different locations in momentum
space of the low-energy electronic bands of the constituent materials. We
analyze the general condition for a well-defined crystalline limit in the
interface electron system and classify the associated "crystalline reference
points". We discuss this in detail for the example of the two-dimensional
lattice planes being square and triangular lattices on the two sides of the
interface; we reveal non-trivial reference points at finite twist angle and
lattice mismatch and the possibility of band structures of mixed
dimensionality, where quasi-one- and two-dimensional pockets coexist. Explicit
computations for different bulk Bloch Hamiltonians yield a collection of
interesting features, such as isolated bands localized at interfaces of
non-topological insulators, Dirac cones, van Hove singularities, a non-trivial
evolution of the band structures with Zeeman-field, and topological interface
bands. Our work illustrates the potential of these heterostructures and is
anticipated to provide the foundation for moir\'e interface design and for the
analysis of correlated physics in these systems.

<h3>Fermionic Quantum Simulation on Andreev Bound State Superlattices</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12430" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12430</a>
<br>
</p><i>Peter D. Johannsen, Constantin Schrade</i>
<p>Arrays of superconducting qubits and cavities offer a promising route for
realizing highly controllable artificial materials. However, many analog
simulations of superconducting circuit hardware have focused on bosonic
systems. Fermionic simulations, on the other hand, have largely relied on
digital approaches that require non-local qubit couplings, which could limit
their scalability. Here, we propose and study an alternative approach for
analog fermionic quantum simulation based on arrays of coherently coupled
mesoscopic Josephson junctions. These Josephson junction arrays implement an
effective superlattice of Andreev bound state "atoms" that can trap individual
fermionic quasiparticles and, due to their wavefunction overlap, mediate
quasiparticle hoppings. By developing a Wannier function approach, we show that
these Andreev bound state arrays form an all-superconducting and circuit
QED-compatible platform for emulating lattice models of fermionic
quasiparticles that are phase- and gate-programmable. Interestingly, we also
find that the junction lattices can undergo a topological transition and host
fermionic boundary modes that can be probed by conductance measurements. We
hope our results will inspire the realization of artificial and possibly
topological materials on Andreev bound state quantum simulators.

<h3>Singlet polaron theory of low-energy optical excitations in NiPS$_3$</h3>

<br>
</p><i>I. J. Hamad, C. S. Helman, L. O. Manuel, A. E. Feiguin, A. A. Aligia</i>
<p>Light-matter interactions can be used as a tool to realize novel many-body
states of matter and to study the interplay between electronic and magnetic
degrees of freedom. In particular, tightly bound many-body states that behave
as coherent quasi-particles are rare, and may lead to unconventional
technological applications beyond the semi-conductor paradigm, particularly if
these excitations are bosonic and can condense. Two-dimensional magnetic
systems present a pristine platform to realize and study such states. We
construct a theory that explains the low-energy optical excitations at 1.476 eV
and 1.498 eV observed by photoluminiscence, optical absorption, and RIXS in the
van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$. Using \textit{ab initio} methods, we
construct a two-band Hubbard model for two \textit{effective} Ni orbitals of
the original lattice. The dominant effective hopping corresponds to
third-nearest neighbours. This model exhibits two triplet-singlet excitations
of energy near two times the Hund exchange. From perturbation theory, we obtain
an effective model for the movement of the singlets in an antiferromagnetic
background, that we solve using a generalized self-consistent Born
approximation. These singlet excitations, dressed by a cloud of magnons, move
coherently as polaronic-like quasi-particles, "singlet polarons". Our theory
explains the main features of the observed spectra.

<h3>Exploring interlayer coupling in the twisted bilayer PtTe$_{2}$</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12461" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12461</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jeonghwan Ahn, Seoung-Hun Kang, Mina Yoon, Jaron T. Krogel</i>
<p>We have investigated interlayer interactions in the bilayer PtTe$_{2}$
system, which influence the electronic energy bands near the Fermi levels. Our
diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations for the high-symmetry bilayer
stackings (AA, AB, AC) manifest distinct interlayer binding characteristics
among the stacking modes by revealing significantly different interlayer
separations depending on the stackings, which is critical to understanding the
interlayer coupling of the twisted bilayers consisting of various local
stacking arrangements. Furthermore, a comparison between the interlayer
separations obtained from DMC and density functional theory (DFT) shows that
meta-GGA-based vdW-DFT results agree with DMC for different layer stackings,
including twisted bilayers, but only the ground-state AA stacking matches well
with GGA-based DFT predictions. This underscores the importance of accurate
exchange-correlation potentials even for capturing the stacking-dependent
interlayer binding properties. We further show that the variability in
DFT-predicted interlayer separations is responsible for the large discrepancy
of band structures in the 21.79$^{\circ}$-twisted bilayer PtTe$_{2}$, affecting
its classification as metallic or semiconducting. These results demonstrate the
importance of obtaining a correct description of stacking-dependent interlayer
coupling in modeling delicate bilayer systems at finite twists.

<h3>Coil-to-globule collapse of active polymers: a Rouse perspective</h3>

<br>
</p><i>P. Malgaretti, E. Locatelli, C. Valeriani</i>
<p>We derive an effective Rouse model for tangentially active polymers,
characterized by a constant active force tangent to their backbone. In
particular, we show that, once extended to account for finite bending rigidity,
such active Rouse model captures the reduction in the gyration radius, or
coil-to-globule-like transition, that has been observed numerically in the
literature for such active filaments. Interestingly, our analysis identifies
the proper definition of the Peclet number, that allows to collapse all
numerical data onto a master curve.

<h3>Tuning exciton emission via ferroelectric polarization at a  heterogeneous interface between a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide  and a perovskite oxide membrane</h3>

</p><i>Jaehong Choi, Kevin J. Crust, Lizhong Li, Kihong Lee, Jialun Luo, Jae-Pil So, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Harold Y. Hwang, Kin Fai Mak, Jie Shan, Gregory D. Fuchs</i>
<p>We demonstrate the integration of a thin BaTiO$_3$ (BTO) membrane with
monolayer MoSe$_2$ in a dual gate device that enables in-situ manipulation of
the BTO ferroelectric polarization with a voltage pulse. While two-dimensional
(2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer remarkable adaptability,
their hybrid integration with other families of functional materials beyond the
realm of 2D materials has been challenging. Released functional oxide membranes
offer a solution for 2D/3D integration via stacking. 2D TMD excitons can serve
as a local probe of the ferroelectric polarization in BTO at a heterogeneous
interface. Using photoluminescence (PL) of MoSe$_2$ excitons to optically
readout the doping level, we find that the relative population of charge
carriers in MoSe$_2$ depends sensitively on the ferroelectric polarization.
This finding points to a promising avenue for future-generations versatile
sensing devices with high sensitivity, fast read-out, and diverse applicability
for advanced signal processing.

<h3>Incorporation of the intensive and extensive entropy contributions in  the disk intersection theory of a hard disk system</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12506" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12506</a>
<br>
</p><i>V.M. Pergamenshchik</i>
<p>The one-body free volume, which determines the entropy of a hard disk system,
has extensive (cavity) and intensive (cell) contributions. So far these
contributions have not been unified and considered separately. The presented
theory incorporates both contributions, and their sum is shown to determine the
free volume and partition function. The approach is based on multiple
intersections of the circles concentric with the disks but of twice larger
radius. The result is exact formulae for the extensive and intensive entropy
contributions in terms of the intersections of just two, three, four, and five
circles. The method has an important advantage for applications in numerical
simulations: the formulae enable one to convert the disk coordinates into the
entropy contribution directly without any additional geometric construction.
The theory can be straightforwardly applied to a system of hard spheres.

<h3>Harmonic Oscillator Staging for Efficient Path Integral Simulations</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12551" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12551</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sabry G. Moustafa, Andrew J. Schultz</i>
<p>Imaginary-time path integral (PI) is a rigorous quantum mechanical tool to
compute static properties. However, the stiff nature of the internal PI modes
poses a sampling challenge. This is commonly tackled using staging coordinates,
in which the free particle (FP) contribution of the PI action is diagonalized.
We introduce novel and simple staging coordinates that diagonalize the entire
action of the harmonic oscillator (HO), rendering it efficiently applicable to
systems with a harmonic character, such as quantum oscillators and crystals.
Unlike FP staging, the HO staging provides a unique treatment of the centroid
mode. We provide implementation schemes for PIMC and PIMD simulations. Sampling
efficiency is assessed in terms of precision and accuracy of estimating the
energy and heat capacity of a 1D HO, along with an anharmonic oscillator (AO)
to investigate anharmonic effects. In PIMC, the HO coordinates propose
collective moves that perfectly sample the HO contribution, then (for AO) the
residual anharmonic term is sampled using Metropolis method. This results in a
high acceptance rate and, hence, high precision, in comparison to the FP
staging. In PIMD, the HO coordinates naturally prescribe definitions for the
fictitious masses, yielding equal frequencies of all modes when applied to the
HO model. This allows for a substantially larger time step sizes relative to
standard staging, without affecting accuracy. For completeness, we also present
results using normal mode (NM) coordinates, based on both HO and FP models.
While staging and NM coordinates show similar performance, staging is
computationally cheaper due to its linear, rather than quadratic, scaling with
system size. The simplicity and the enhanced sampling gained by the HO
coordinates open avenues for efficient estimation of nuclear quantum effects in
more complex systems, such as molecular bonds and quantum crystals.

<h3>Nonlocality and Strength of Interatomic Interactions Inducing the  Topological Phonon Phase Transition</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12557" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12557</a>
<br>
</p><i>Daosheng Tang</i>
<p>Understanding the phonon behavior in semiconductors from a topological
physics perspective provides more opportunities to uncover extraordinary
physics related to phonon transport and electron-phonon interactions. While
various kinds of topological phonons have been reported in different
crystalline solids, their microscopic origin has not been quantitatively
uncovered. In this work, four typical analytical interatomic force constant
(IFC) models are employed for wurtzite GaN and AlN to help establish the
relationships between phonon topology and real-space IFCs. In particular,
various nearest neighbor IFCs, i.e., different levels of nonlocality, and IFC
strength controlled by characteristic coefficients, can be achieved in these
models. The results demonstrate that changes in the strength of both the IFCs
and nonlocal interactions can induce phonon phase transitions in GaN and AlN,
leading to the disappearance of existing Weyl phonons and the appearance of new
Weyl phonons. These new Weyl phonons are the result of a band reversal and have
a Chern number of 1. Most of them are located in the kz=0 plane in pairs, while
some of them are inside or at the boundary of the irreducible Brillouin zone.
Among the various Weyl points observed, certain ones remain identical in both
materials, while others exhibit variability depending on the particular case.
Compared to the strength of the IFC, nonlocal interactions show much more
significant effects in inducing the topological phonon phase transition,
especially in cases modeled by the IFC model and SW potential. The larger
number of 3NN atoms provides more space for variations in the topological
phonon phase of wurtzite AlN than in GaN, resulting in a greater abundance of
changes in AlN.

<h3>Mixed polytype/polymorph formation and its effects on the electronic  properties in InSe films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on GaAs(111)B</h3>

</p><i>Maria Hilse, Justin Rodriguez, Jennifer Gray, Jinyuan Yao, Shaoqing Ding, Derrick Shao Heng Liu, Mo Li, Joshua Young, Ying Liu, Roman Engel-Herbert</i>
<p>The top-down synthesis of inherently ferroelectric semiconductors and their
integration with traditional material platforms have the potential to enable
new low power logic devices, and to harness the bulk photoelectric effect for
more efficient photovoltaic cells. InSe is a layered van der Waals compound
exhibiting multiple polytypes, with semiconducting gamma-InSe revealing a
non-centrosymmetric space group and showing a high carrier mobility at room
temperature. Here we report the growth of InSe films on close to lattice
matched semi-insulating GaAs(111)B substrates by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).
Excellent nucleation behavior resulted in the growth of smooth, single phase
InSe films. The dominant polytype determined from X-ray diffraction was the
targeted gamma-InSe, however Raman spectroscopy revealed spatial variations in
the overall low-intensity non-centrosymmetric vibration modes. Transmission
electron microscopy uncovered the presence of the three bulk polytypes beta,
gamma, and epsilon-InSe coexisting in the films arranging in nanosized domains.
The different polytypes can be interpreted as sequences of stacking faults and
rotational twin boundaries of gamma-InSe made from individual
non-centrosymmetric Se-In-In-Se layers with P-6m2 symmetry. A second,
centrosymmetric Se-In-In-Se layer polymorph was identified with P-3m symmetry,
which is typically not present in InSe bulk phases. First principles
calculations revealed small formation energy differences between the InSe
polymorphs and polytypes, yet sizeable differences in their electronic
properties. Nanoscale domain sizes of varying polytypes thus resulted in
sizeable electronic disorder in the grown films that dominated the electronic
transport properties. Our results indicate that bottom-up thin film synthesis
is a viable synthesis route towards stabilization of InSe polytypes not present
in the bulk.

<h3>Molecular heat transport across a time-periodic temperature gradient</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12579" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12579</a>
<br>
</p><i>Renai Chen, Tammie Gibson, Galen T. Craven</i>
<p>The time-periodic modulation of a temperature gradient can alter the heat
transport properties of a physical system. Oscillating thermal gradients give
rise to behaviors such as modified thermal conductivity and controllable
time-delayed energy storage that are not present in a system with static
temperatures. Here, we examine how the heat transport properties of a molecular
lattice model are affected by an oscillating temperature gradient. We use
analytical analysis and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the
vibrational heat flow in a molecular lattice system consisting of a chain of
particles connected to two heat baths at different temperatures, where the
temperature difference between baths is oscillating in time. We derive
expressions for heat currents in this system using a stochastic energetics
framework and a nonequilibrium Green's function approach that is modified to
treat the nonstationary average energy fluxes. We find that emergent energy
storage, energy release, and thermal conductance mechanisms induced by the
temperature oscillations can be controlled by varying the frequency, waveform,
and amplitude of the oscillating gradient. The developed theoretical approach
provides a general framework to describe how vibrational heat transmission
through a molecular lattice is affected by temperature gradient oscillations.

<p>YMn$_6$Sn$_6$ consists of two types of Mn-based kagome planes stacked along
$c$-axis having a complex magnetic interactions. We report a spin
reconstruction in YMn$_6$Sn$_6$ from ferromagnet (FM) into a combination of two
incommensurate spin spirals (SSs) originating from two different type of Mn
kagome planes driven by frustrated magnetic exchanges along the $c$-axis with
inclusion of Hubbard U. The pitch angle and wave vector of the incommensurate
SSs are $\sim$89.3$^{\circ}$ and $\sim$ (0 0 0.248) respectively which are in
excellent agreement with experiment. We employed an effective model Hamiltonian
constructed out of exchange interactions to capture experimentally observed
non-equivalent nature of the two incommensurate SSs which also explain FM-SS
crossover due to antiferromagntic spin exchange with correlation. We further
report the existence of topological magnon with spin-orbit coupling in
incommensurate SS phase of YMn$_6$Sn$_6$ by calculating the topological
invariants and Berry curvature profile. The location of Dirac magnon in energy
landscape at 73 meV matches with another experimental report. We demonstrate
the accuracy of our results by highlighting experimental features in
YMn$_6$Sn$_6$.

<p>We consider nonreciprocal supercurrent effects in Josephson junctions based
on multiband superconductors with a pairing structure that can break
time-reversal symmetry. We demonstrate that a nonreciprocal supercurrent can be
generally achieved by the cooperation of interband superconducting phase
mismatch and interband scattering as well as by multiband phase frustration.
The effect of interband impurity scattering indicates that the amplitude and
sign of the nonreciprocal supercurrent are sensitive to the interband phase
relation. For the case of a three-band superconductor, due to phase
frustration, we show that the profile of the supercurrent rectification is
marked by a hexagonal pattern of nodal lines with vanishing amplitude.
Remarkably, around the nodal lines, the supercurrent rectification amplitude
exhibits three-fold structures with an alternating sign. We show that the
hexagonal pattern and the three-fold structure in the interband phase space
turn out to be dependent on the tunneling amplitude of each band. These
findings provide hallmarks of the supercurrent rectification which can be
potentially employed to unveil the occurrence of spin-singlet multiband
superconductivity with time-reversal symmetry breaking.

<h3>First-principles study on tunnel magnetoresistance effect with Cr-doped  RuO$_{2}$ electrode</h3>

<p>We investigate the functionality of the $\mathrm{Cr}$-doped
$\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ as an electrode of the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ),
motivated by the recent experiment showing that $\mathrm{Cr}$-doping into the
rutile-type $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ will be an effective tool to control its
antiferromagnetic order and the resultant magnetotransport phenomena easily. We
perform first-principles calculation of the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR)
effect in the MTJ based on the $\mathrm{Cr}$-doped $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$
electrodes. We find that a finite TMR effect appears in the MTJ originating
from the momentum-dependent spin splitting in the electrodes, which suggests
that $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ with Cr-doping will work as the electrode of the MTJ.
We also show that this TMR effect can be qualitatively captured using the local
density of states inside the tunnel barrier.

<p>We present Ir $4f$ core-level hard-x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES)
experiments conducted across antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering transition in
Ruddlesden-Popper iridates Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$. The Ir $4f$
spectra exhibit distinct changes between the AFM and paramagnetic (PM) phases,
with the spectral difference $I_\text{PM}-I_\text{AFM}$ showing a contrasting
behavior in the two compounds. By employing computational simulations using the
local-density approximation combined with the dynamical mean-field theory
method, we elucidate that $I_\text{PM}-I_\text{AFM}$ primary reflects the
Slater or Mott-Hubbard character of the AFM insulating state rather than
material specific details. This sensitivity to fine low-energy electronic
structure arises from the dependence of charge-transfer responses to the sudden
creation of a localized core hole on both metal-insulator transitions and
long-range AFM ordering. Our result broadens the applications of core-level
HAXPES as a tool for characterization of electronic structure.

<p>A comprehensive photoluminescence and mechanoluminescence analysis of
ZnS:Mn2+ nano-phosphor with zinc blende structure is presented. The sample
containing quantum dot-sized nanocrystallites were synthesized by the chemical
precipitation method and shows excellent orange luminescence at ambient
conditions related to the 4T1->6A1 transition. The sample shows stable and
identical luminescence behavior under both UV and X-ray excitation at ambient
conditions and also shows excellent self-powered mechanoluminescence
properties. The pressure and temperature-induced luminescence mechanism of the
phosphor is also established. The shift of the 4T1->6A1 luminescence band of
Mn2+ with both pressure and temperature and the luminescence mechanism is
explained via the d5 Tanabe Sugano diagram. The broad luminescence band of
4T1->6A1 transition shifts from visible to near-infrared range at a rate of
-35.8 meV/GPa with the increase of pressure and it is subsequently quenched
completely at a pressure of 16.41 GPa due to a reversible phase transition from
zinc blende to rocksalt phase. The high-pressure and temperature-dependent
decay kinetics measurements of the sample luminescence are also reported.

<h3>Floquet engineering tunable periodic gauge fields and simulating real  topological phases in cold alkaline-earth atom optical lattice</h3>

<p>We propose to synthesize tunable periodic gauge fields via Floquet
engineering cold alkaline-earth atoms in one-dimensional optical lattice. The
artificial magnetic flux is designed to emerge during the combined process of
Floquet photon assisted tunneling and internal state transitions. By varying
initial phases of driving protocol, our proposal presents the ability to
smoothly tune the periodic flux. Moreover, we demonstrate that the effective
two-leg flux ladder model can simulate one typical real topological insulator,
which is described by the first Stiefel Whitney class and protected by the $PT$
symmetry. Benefiting from the long lifetime of excited states of alkaline-earth
atoms, our work opens new possibilities for exploiting the physics related to
gauge fields, such as topological phases, in the current cold atom platform.

<p>We have investigated the electronic structure of the transition metal oxide
Ca3Ru2O7 within density functional theory using the generalized gradient
approximation while considering strong Coulomb correlations in the framework of
the fully relativistic spin-polarized Dirac linear muffin-tin orbital
band-structure method. Ca3Ru2O7 can be classified as a Mott insulator since it
was expected to be metallic from band structure calculations. We have
investigated the resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra at the Ru and Ca
K, L3, and M3 edges as well as at the O K edge. The experimentally measured
resonance inelastic x-ray spectrum of Ca3Ru2O7 at the Ru L3 edge possesses a
sharp feature below 2 electron-volts corresponding to transitions within the Ru
t_2g levels. The excitation located from 2 to 4 electron-volts is due to t2g ->
e_g transitions. The third wide structure situated at 4.5-11 electron-volts
appears due to transitions between the Ru 4dO states derived from the tails of
oxygen 2p states and t_2g and e_g states. The measured resonance inelastic
x-ray spectra at the Ru L3 and M3 edges are very similar. However, the
corresponding measured resonance inelastic x-ray spectra at the Ca site quite
differ from each other due to the significant difference in the widths of
core-levels.

<h3>Understanding the anomalous thermoelectric behaviour of Fe-V-W-Al based  thin films</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12700" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12700</a>

</p><i>Kavita Yadav, Yuya Tanaka, Kotaro Hirose, Masahiro Adachi, Masaharu Matsunami, Tsunehiro Takeuchi</i>
<p>We have investigated the thermoelectric and thermal behaviour of Fe-V-W-Al
based thin films prepared using radio frequency magnetron sputtering technique
at different base pressures (0.1 ~ 1.0 X 10-2 Pa) and on different substrates
(n, p and undoped Si). Interestingly, at lower base pressure, formation of bcc
type of Heusler structure was observed in deposited samples, whereas at higher
base pressure, we have noted the development of non-Heusler amorphous structure
in these samples. Our findings indicates that the moderately oxidized Fe-V-W-Al
amorphous thin film deposited on n-Si substrate, possesses large magnitude of
absoulte S ~ 1098 microvolt per kelvin near room temperature, which is almost
the double the previously reported value for thin films. Additionally, the
power factor indicated enormously large values ~ 33.9 milliwatt per meter per
kelvin sqaure near 320 K. The thermal conductivity of the amorphous thin film
is also found to be 2.75 watt per meter per kelvin, which is quite lower
compared to bulk alloys. As a result, the maximum figure of merit is estimated
to be extremely high i.e. ~ 3.9 near 320 K, which is among one of the highest
reported values so far. The anomalously large value of Seebeck coefficient and
power factor has been ascribed to formation of amorphous structure and
composite effect of thin film and substrate.

<p>We investigate the magnetic-field dependent evolution of the zero-bias
conductance peaks (ZBCPs) on the nanoscale bismuth islands grown on the
FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$ substrate. The ZBCPs can be observed throughout the
entire region on these islands, and their characteristics align with the
signatures of Majorana zero modes. Remarkably, the evolution of ZBCPs on these
islands exhibits anomalous behavior under varying magnetic fields: The
magnitude of ZBCPs is first enhanced at weak fields lower than 2 T and then
suppressed as the fields further increase. We attribute the non-monotonic
evolution of the ZBCPs to the magnetic-field-enhanced topological edge states
on these Bi islands. Our findings provide valuable insights into the probable
origin of the Majorana zero modes in the Bi-island platform and the
magnetic-field response of topological edge states.

<h3>Enumerating low-frequency nonphononic vibrations in computer glasses</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Edan Lerner, Avraham Moriel, Eran Bouchbinder</i>
<p>In addition to Goldstone phonons that generically emerge in the low-frequency
vibrational spectrum of any solid, crystalline or glassy, structural glasses
also feature other low-frequency vibrational modes. The nature and statistical
properties of these modes -- often termed `excess modes' -- have been the
subject of decades-long investigation. Studying them, even using
well-controlled computer glasses, has proven challenging due to strong spatial
hybridization effects between phononic and nonphononic excitations, which
hinder quantitative analyses of the nonphononic contribution ${\cal D}_{\rm
G}(\omega)$ to the total spectrum ${\cal D}(\omega)$, per frequency $\omega$.
Here, using recent advances indicating that ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)\!=\!{\cal
D}(\omega)-{\cal D}_{\rm D}(\omega)$, where ${\cal D}_{\rm D}(\omega)$ is
Debye's spectrum of phonons, we present a simple and straightforward scheme to
enumerate nonphononic modes in computer glasses. Our analysis establishes that
nonphononic modes in computer glasses indeed make an additive contribution to
the total spectrum, including in the presence of strong hybridizations.
Moreover, it cleanly reveals the universal ${\cal D}_{\rm
G}(\omega)\!\sim\!\omega^4$ tail of the nonphononic spectrum, and opens the way
for related analyses of experimental spectra of glasses.

<h3>Kitaev-Heisenberg cobaltates: Coulomb exchange as leading  nearest-neighbor interaction mechanism</h3>

<p>A range of honeycomb Co oxide compounds has been proposed and investigated in
the search for a topological Kitaev spin liquid. Analyzing the quantum
chemistry of interacting magnetic moments in Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$, a
representative $LS$-coupled $t_{2g}^5e_g^2$ magnet, we find that the Kitaev and
off-diagonal $\Gamma$ interactions are sizable and antiferromagnetic but still
weaker than the Heisenberg contribution. Except $\Gamma$', all nearest-neighbor
couplings are mainly determined by Coulomb exchange, different from current
representations of anisotropic interaction terms. This highlights the
limitations of existing anisotropic models and the need for systematic
wave-function quantum chemical studies to clarify exchange mechanisms in
Kitaev-Heisenberg systems.

<h3>2D synthetic ferrimagnets by magnetic proximity coupling</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Paul Rosenberger, Moumita Kundu, Andrei Gloskovskii, Christoph Schlueter, Ulrich Nowak, Martina Müller</i>
<p>Proximity effects allow for the adjustment of magnetic properties in a
physically elegant way. If two thin ferromagnetic (FM) films are brought into
contact, electronic coupling alters their magnetic exchange interaction at
their interface. For a low-TC rare-earth FM coupled to a 3d transition metal
FM, even room temperature magnetism is within reach. In addition, magnetic
proximity coupling is particularly promising for increasing the magnetic order
of metastable materials such as europium monoxide (EuO) beyond their bulk TC,
since neither the stoichiometry nor the insulating properties are modified.
We investigate the magnetic proximity effect at Fe/EuO and Co/EuO interfaces
using hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. By exciting the FM layers with
circularly polarized light, magnetic dichroism is observed in angular
dependence on the photoemission geometry. In this way, the depth-dependence of
the magnetic signal is determined element-specifically for the EuO and 3d FM
parts of the bilayers. In connection with atomistic spin dynamics simulations,
the thickness of EuO layer is found to be crucial, indicating that the observed
antiferromagnetic proximity coupling is a short-ranged and genuine interface
phenomenon. This fact turns the bilayer into a strong synthetic ferrimagnet.
The increase in magnetic order in EuO occurs in a finite spatial range and is
therefore particularly strong in the 2D limit-a counterintuitive but very
useful phenomenon for spin-based device applications.

<h3>Universality of giant diffusion in tilted periodic potentials</h3>

</p><i>Kento Iida, Andreas Dechant, Takuma Akimoto</i>
<p>Giant diffusion, where the diffusion coefficient of a Brownian particle in a
periodic potential with an external force is significantly enhanced by the
external force, is a non-trivial non-equilibrium phenomenon. We propose a
simple stochastic model of giant diffusion, which is based on a biased
continuous-time random walk (CTRW). In this model, we introduce a flight time
in the biased CTRW. We derive the diffusion coefficients of this model by the
renewal theory and find that there is a maximum diffusion coefficient when the
bias is changed. Giant diffusion is universally observed in the sense that
there is a peak of the diffusion coefficient for any tilted periodic potentials
and the degree of the diffusivity is greatly enhanced especially for
low-temperature regimes. The biased CTRW models with flight times are applied
to diffusion under three tilted periodic potentials. Furthermore, the
temperature dependence of the maximum diffusion coefficient and the external
force that attains the maximum are presented for diffusion under a tilted
sawtooth potential.

<p>We investigate the excitonic species in WS$_{2}$ monolayers transferred onto
III-V semiconductor substrates with different surface treatments. When the
III-V substrates were covered with amorphous native oxides, negatively charged
excitons dominate the spectral weight in low-temperature near-resonance
photoluminescence (PL) measurements. However, when the native oxides of the
III-V substrates were reduced, neutral excitons begin to dominate the spectral
weight, indicating a reduction in the electron density in the WS$_{2}$
monolayers. The removal of the native oxides enhanced the electron transfer
from the WS$_{2}$ monolayer to the III-V substrate. In addition, an additional
shoulder-like PL feature appeared $\sim$50 meV below the emission of neutral
excitons, which can be attributed to the emission of localized excitons. When
the III-V substrate surface was passivated by sulfur after the reduction of the
native oxides, neutral excitons still dominated the spectral weight. However,
the low energy PL shoulder disappeared again, suggesting the effective
delocalization of excitons through the substrate surface passivation. Surface
engineering of the semiconductor substrates for two-dimensional (2D) materials
can provide a novel approach to control the carrier density of the 2D
materials, to implement deterministic carrier localization or delocalization
for the 2D materials, and to facilitate the interlayer transfer of charge,
spin, and valley currents. These findings open the avenue for novel device
concepts and phenomena in mixed-dimensional semiconductor heterostructures.

<p>Recent advances in the field of condensed-matter physics have unlocked the
potential to realize and control emergent material phases that do not exist in
thermal equilibrium. One of the most promising concepts in this regard is
Floquet engineering, the coherent dressing of matter via time-periodic
perturbations. However, the broad applicability of Floquet engineering to
quantum materials is still unclear. For the paradigmatic case of monolayer
graphene, the theoretically predicted Floquet-induced effects, despite a
seminal report of the light-induced anomalous Hall effect, have been put into
question. Here, we overcome this problem by using electronic structure
measurements to provide direct experimental evidence of Floquet engineering in
graphene. We report light-matter-dressed Dirac bands by measuring the
contribution of Floquet sidebands, Volkov sidebands, and their quantum path
interference to graphene's photoemission spectral function. Our results finally
demonstrate that Floquet engineering in graphene is possible, paving the way
for the experimental realization of the many theoretical proposals on
Floquet-engineered band structures and topological phases.

<p>A generalized approach derived from Blochs equation of motion of nuclear
magnetic moments is presented to model the frequency, magnetic field, spin
density, and temperature dependencies in the electromagnetic permeability
tensor for materials with magnetic resonances. The resulting tensor model
predicts characteristic polarization signatures which can be observed, for
example, in fully polarization-resolved Mueller matrix element spectra measured
across magnetic resonances as a function of frequency, magnetic field, magnetic
moment density, and temperature. When augmented with thermodynamic
considerations and suitable Hamiltonian description of the magnetic eigenvalue
spectrum, important parameters such as zero-frequency magnetization, spectral
amplitude distribution, relaxation time constants, and geometrical orientation
parameters of the magnetic moment density can be obtained from comparing the
generalized model approach to experimental data. We demonstrate our approach by
comparing model calculations with full Mueller matrix element spectra measured
at oblique angle of incidence in the terahertz spectral range, across electron
spin resonance quintuplet transitions observed in wurtzite-structure GaN doped
with iron. Measurements were performed by ellipsometry, using a superconducting
cryostat magnet at magnetic fields of 7.23 T and at temperatures of 20 K and 30
K. We detail the occurrence of linear and circular birefringence and dichroism
associated with each of the zero-field split spin transitions in the S = 5/2
defect system. We derive the spectral dependence of the magnetic susceptibility
function and obtain the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the spin
Hamiltonian. Our model correctly predicts the complexity of the polarization
signatures observed in the 15 independent elements of the normalized Mueller
matrix for both positive and negative magnetic fields.

<p>Cubic rocksalt structured transition-metal carbides, nitrides, and related
alloys (TMC/Ns) are attractive for a wide variety of applications, notably as
hard, wear-resistant material. To-date, valence electron concentration (VEC) is
used as a good indicator of stability and mechanical properties of these
refractory compounds. In this perspective, we argue for the need for electronic
descriptors beyond VEC to explain and predict the mechanical behavior of the
cubic TMC/Ns. As such, we point out that descriptors that highlight differences
between constituent have been underused, along with semi-empirical models of
mechanical properties. Additionally, it appears promising to partition VEC into
contribution to ionic, covalent, and metallic bonds and we suggest that such
partition could provide more insight into predicting mechanical properties in
the future.

</p><i>Kexin Wang, Chengyu Yan, Butian Zhang, Shun Wang</i>
<p>Centrosymmetric materials with site inversion asymmetries possess hidden spin
polarization, which remains challenging to be converted into spin currents
because the global inversion symmetry is still conserved. This study
demonstrates the spin-polarized DC circular photocurrents (CPC) in
centrosymmetric transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) at normal incidence
without applying electric bias. The global inversion symmetry is broken by
using a spatially-varying circularly polarized light beam, which could generate
spin gradient owing to the hidden spin polarization. The dependences of CPC on
electrode configuration, illumination position, and beam spot size indicate an
emergence of circulating electric current under spatially inhomogeneous light,
which is associated with the spin-to-charge conversion through the inverse spin
Hall effect (ISHE). The CPC is subsequently utilized to probe the spin
polarization and ISHE under different excitation wavelengths and temperatures.
The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of using centrosymmetric
materials with hidden spin polarization and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for
spintronic device applications.

<p>Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are highly promising
candidates for various applications due to their unique electrical, optical,
mechanical, and chemical properties. Furthermore, heterostructures consisting
of TMDs with metals, oxides, and conductive materials have attracted
significant research interest due to their exceptional electronic properties.
In this study, we utilized density functional theory to investigate those
electronic and transport properties, which are relevant for the application of
tribo-piezoelectricity in creating novel nanogenerators: an interdisciplinary
approach with promising implications. The results of the study demonstrate that
the enhancement of charge transfer between layers and the orbital contribution
to the Fermi level under applied strain in MoS/IrO, MoS/TiO, MoS/WTe, and
MoTe/WS heterostructures is noteworthy. Additionally, non-equilibrium Green's
function calculations of electron transport properties provide valuable
insights into the behavior of these materials under different conditions. While
MoS/IrO and MoS/TiO hetero-bilayers are unsuitable due to their tendency to
exhibit large current flow with increasing voltage, others like MoS/WTe and
MoTe/WS hetero bilayers show promise due to their ability to prevent voltage
drop. The presented innovative concept of utilizing compressive strain of TMD
bilayers to generate a tribo-piezoelectric effect for nanogenerators has a
potential to contribute to the development of efficient and sustainable energy
harvesting devices.

<h3>Wrinkling instability of 3D auxetic bilayers in tension</h3>

<p>Bilayers (soft substrates coated with stiff films) are commonly found in
nature with examples including skin tissue, vesicles, or organ membranes. They
exhibit various types of instabilities when subjected to compression, depending
on the contrast in material properties between the two components. We present
wrinkling instabilities for 3D hyperelastic bilayer systems, including auxetics
(materials with negative Poisson's ratio), under uni-axial tension. In tension,
a soft bilayer can experience large lateral contraction, and we find that with
an adequate contrast in the Poisson ratios, compressive stresses may develop
and generate wrinkles aligned with the tensile direction. We rely on an
analytic modelling of the phenomenon, and validate it with a user-defined
Python script with periodic boundary conditions and constitutive relation
implementation in advanced Finite Element simulations. Our findings reveal that
wrinkles are observed when the Poisson ratio of the substrate is greater than
that of the film. As the two Poisson ratios converge to a common value, the
critical stretch of instability shoots up rapidly, and the wrinkling
disappears. We also confirm these results by asymptotic analysis. This
wrinkling analysis has significant potential in controlling surface patterns of
auxetic skin grafts and hydrogel organ patches under mechanical loads.
Moreover, the asymptotic expressions in this work can be used under finite
strain for buckling-based metrology applications.

</p><i>Luke Wernert, Bastián Pradenas, Oleg Tchernyshyov, Hua Chen</i>
<p>Noncollinear antiferromagnets (AFMs) in the family of Mn$_3X$ ($X$=Ir, Sn,
Ge, Pt, etc.) have recently attracted attention in the emerging field of
antiferromagnetic spintronics because of their various interesting transport,
magnetic, and optical properties. Due to the noncollinear magnetic order, the
localized electron spins on different magnetic sublattices are not conserved
even when spin-orbit coupling is neglected, making it difficult to understand
the transport of spin angular momentum. Here we study the conserved Noether
current associated with spin-rotation symmetry of the local spins in
noncollinear AFMs. We found that a Hall component of the d.c. spin current can
be created by a longitudinal driving force associated with a propagating spin
wave, and is proportional to a response coefficient that we denote as the Hall
(inverse) mass. Such a Hall spin current can be generated by spin pumping in a
ferromagnet (FM)-noncollinear AFM bilayer structure as we demonstrated
numerically. Finally we showed that the Hall mass is an isotropic quantity,
similar to the isotropic spin Hall conductivity, and should generally exist in
noncollinear AFMs and their polycrystals. Our results shed light on the
potential of noncollinear AFMs in manipulating the polarization and flow of
spin currents in general spintronic devices.

<p>Scientific advancement is universally based on the dynamic interplay between
theoretical insights, modelling, and experimental discoveries. However, this
feedback loop is often slow, including delayed community interactions and the
gradual integration of experimental data into theoretical frameworks. This
challenge is particularly exacerbated in domains dealing with high-dimensional
object spaces, such as molecules and complex microstructures. Hence, the
integration of theory within automated and autonomous experimental setups, or
theory in the loop automated experiment, is emerging as a crucial objective for
accelerating scientific research. The critical aspect is not only to use theory
but also on-the-fly theory updates during the experiment. Here, we introduce a
method for integrating theory into the loop through Bayesian co-navigation of
theoretical model space and experimentation. Our approach leverages the
concurrent development of surrogate models for both simulation and experimental
domains at the rates determined by latencies and costs of experiments and
computation, alongside the adjustment of control parameters within theoretical
models to minimize epistemic uncertainty over the experimental object spaces.
This methodology facilitates the creation of digital twins of material
structures, encompassing both the surrogate model of behavior that includes the
correlative part and the theoretical model itself. While demonstrated here
within the context of functional responses in ferroelectric materials, our
approach holds promise for broader applications, the exploration of optical
properties in nanoclusters, microstructure-dependent properties in complex
materials, and properties of molecular systems. The analysis code that supports

<p>In nonequilibrium statistical physics, quantifying the nearest (and
higher-order) neighbors and free volumes of particles in many-body systems is
crucial to elucidating the origin of macroscopic collective phenomena, such as
glass/granular jamming transitions and various aspects of the behavior of
active matter. However, conventional techniques (based on a fixed-distance
cutoff or the Voronoi construction) have mainly been applied to equilibrated,
homogeneous, and monodisperse particle systems. In this paper, we implement
simple and efficient methods for local structure analysis in nonequilibrium,
inhomogeneous, and polydisperse hard disk systems. We show how these novel
methods can overcome the difficulties encountered by conventional techniques,
as well as demonstrating some applications.

<br>
</p><i>Galor Geva, Tamir Admon, Maayan Levin, Yael Roichman</i>
<p>We study the relaxation process of two driven colloidal suspensions in
diffusive contact to a steady state, similar to thermalization. We start by
studying a single suspension, subjecting it to random driving forces via
holographic optical tweezers, which agitate it to a higher effective
temperature. Interestingly, the effective temperature of the suspension,
defined by the Einstein relation, exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the
driving frequency. Next, we follow the flux of particles between two such
suspensions in diffusive contact, starting from a uniform density and relaxing
to a state with zero net particle flux. The density remains uniform for systems
with different frequencies but equal effective temperatures. At high driving
frequencies, we show that the density distribution at steady state is
determined by equating the ratio of the chemical potential to the effective
temperature in both systems, mirroring thermal equilibrium behavior.

<h3>Collective entanglement in quantum materials with competing orders</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Giacomo Mazza, Costantino Budroni</i>
<p>We investigate entanglement detection in quantum materials through criteria
based on the simultaneous suppression of collective matter excitations. Unlike
other detection schemes, these criteria can be applied to continuous and
unbounded variables. By considering a system of interacting dipoles on a
lattice, we show the detection of collective entanglement arising from two
different physical mechanisms, namely, the ferroelectric ordering and the
dressing of matter degrees of freedom by light. In the latter case, the
detection shows the formation of a collective entangled phase not directly
related to spontaneous symmetry breaking. These results open a new perspective
for the entanglement characterization of competing orders in quantum materials,
and have direct application to quantum paraelectrics with large polariton
splittings.

<p>We investigate the magnetic properties of Fe Phthalocyanines (FePc) that are
experimentally arranged in quasi one-dimensional chains when they are grown in
thin films or powders. By means of DFT calculations we reproduce the structural
parameters found in experiments, and then we build a generalized Heisenberg
magnetic model with single ion anisotropy, and calculate its parameters. The
results show a anisotropic exchange interaction $J$ between FePc molecules, and
an easy plane single ion anisotropy $D$. By means of Monte Carlo simulations,
with this model, we found an explanation to the non-saturation of the
magnetization found at high fields, which we interpret is due to the
anisotropic exchange interaction $J$. Finally, we also investigate the presence
of magnetic solitons versus temperature and magnetic field. This results
provide additional evidence that FePc is a soliton bearing molecular compound,
with solitons easily excited mainly in the molecular $xy$ plane.

<h3>Enhanced controllable triplet proximity effect in superconducting  spin-orbit coupled spin valves with modified superconductor/ferromagnet  interfaces</h3>

<p>In a superconductor/ferromagnet hybrid, a magnetically controlled
singlet-to-triplet Cooper pair conversion can modulate the superconducting
critical temperature. In these triplet superconducting spin valves, such
control usually requires inhomogeneous magnetism. However, in the presence of
spin-orbit coupling from an interfacial heavy-metal layer, the singlet/triplet
conversion rate and thus the critical temperature, can be controlled via the
magnetization direction of a single homogeneous ferromagnet. Here, we report
significantly enhanced controllable pair conversion to a triplet state in a
Nb/Pt/Co/Pt superconducting spin valve in which Pt/Co/Pt is homogeneously
magnetized and proximity-coupled to a superconducting layer of Nb. The Co/Pt
interface furthest away from Nb is modified by a sub-nanometer-thick layer of
Cu or Au. We argue that the enhancement is most likely associated from an
improvement of the Co/Pt interface due to the insertion of Cu and Au layers.
Additionally, the higher normalized orbital moments in Au measured using X-ray
magnetic circular dichroism shows that increasing spin-orbit coupling enhances
the triplet proximity effect - an observation supported by our theoretical
calculations. Our results provide a pathway to enhancing triplet pair creation
by interface engineering for device development in superspintronics.

<p>Two-dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites offer
enhanced stability for perovskite-based applications. Their crystal structure's
soft and ionic nature gives rise to strong interactions between charge carriers
and ionic rearrangements. Here, we investigate the interaction of
photo-generated electrons and ionic polarizations in single-crystal 2D
perovskite butylammonium lead iodide, varying the inorganic lammelae thickness
in the 2D single crystals. We determined the directionality of the transition
dipole moments of the relevant phonon modes (in the 0.3-3 THz range) by
angle-and-polarization dependent THz transmission measurements. We find a clear
anisotropy of the in-plane photoconductivity, with a 10% reduction along the
axis parallel with the transition dipole moment of the most strongly coupled
phonon. Detailed calculations, based on Feynman polaron theory, indicate that
the anisotropy originates from directional electron-phonon interactions.

<h3>Intrinsic Limits of Charge Carrier Mobilities in Layered Halide  Perovskites</h3>

<p>Layered halide perovskites have emerged as potential alternatives to
three-dimensional halide perovskites due to their improved stability and larger
material phase space, allowing fine-tuning of structural, electronic, and
optical properties. However, their charge carrier mobilities are significantly
smaller than that of three-dimensional halide perovskites, which has a
considerable impact on their application in optoelectronic devices. Here, we
employ state-of-the-art ab initio approaches to unveil the electron-phonon
mechanisms responsible for the diminished transport properties of layered
halide perovskites. Starting from a prototypical ABX$_{3}$ halide perovskite,
we model the case of $n=1$ and $n=2$ layered structures and compare their
electronic and transport properties to the three-dimensional reference. The
electronic and phononic properties are investigated within density functional
theory (DFT) and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), while transport
properties are obtained via the ab initio Boltzmann transport equation. The
vibrational modes contributing to charge carrier scattering are investigated
and associated with polar-phonon scattering mechanisms arising from the
long-range Fr\"ohlich coupling and deformation potential scattering processes.
Our investigation reveals that the lower mobilities in layered systems
primarily originates from the increased electronic density of states at the
vicinity of the band edges, while the electron-phonon coupling strength remains
similar. Such increase is caused by the dimensionality reduction and the break
in octahedra connectivity along the stacking direction. Our findings provide a
fundamental understanding of the electron-phonon coupling mechanisms in layered
perovskites and highlight the intrinsic limitations of the charge carrier
transport in these materials.

<h3>Quantum entanglement in the multicritical disordered Ising model</h3>

<p>Here, the entanglement entropy is calculated at the quantum multicritical
point of the random transverse-field Ising model (RTIM). We use an efficient
implementation of the strong disorder renormalization group method in two and
three dimensions for two types of disorder. For cubic subsystems we find a
universal logarithmic corner contribution to the area law b*ln(l) that is
independent of the form of disorder. Our results agree qualitatively with those
at the quantum critical points of the RTIM, but with new b prefactors due to
having both geometric and quantum fluctuations at play. By studying the
vicinity of the multicritical point, we demonstrate that the corner
contribution serves as an `entanglement susceptibility', a useful tool to
locate the phase transition and to measure the correlation length critical
exponents.

<br>
</p><i>Reko P. S. Penttilä, Kukka-Emilia Huhtinen, Päivi Törmä</i>
<p>Flat bands may offer a route to high critical temperatures of
superconductivity. It has been predicted that the quantum geometry of the band
as well as the ratio of the number of flat bands to the number of orbitals
determine flat band superconductivity. However, such results have assumed at
least one of the following: an isolated flat band, zero temperature, mean-field
theory, and/or uniform pairing. Here, we explore flat band superconductivity
when these assumptions are relaxed. We consider an attractive Hubbard model for
different extensions of the Lieb lattice. The superconducting order parameter,
critical temperature, superfluid weight, and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
temperature are calculated within cluster dynamical mean-field theory. We find
that while the flat-band ratio and quantum geometry are good indicators of
superconductivity near zero temperature, at finite temperatures the behavior is
more complicated. Our results suggest that the properties of the other bands
near the flat band(s) are crucial.

<h3>The Hydrophobic Interaction Induced Strengthening of Hydrogen Bond in  Water-DMSO Binary Mixture</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13001" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13001</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sangita Mondal, Biman Bagchi</i>
<p>The lifetime of a hydrogen bond between water and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
is found to be considerably longer than that between two water molecules in the
neat water. This is counter-intuitive because the charge on the oxygen in DMSO
is considerably less than that in water. Additionally, the strength of the
water-dimethyl sulfoxide (w-D) hydrogen bond is found to be strongly
composition dependent; the lifetime of the hydrogen bond is ten times larger at
30% over that at very low concentration. Using computer simulations, we perform
microscopic structural and dynamic analysis to find that these anomalies arise
at least partly from an action-at-a-distance effect where the attraction
between the hydrophobic methyl groups results in self-aggregation of DMSO
molecules that cages both rotational and linear motions of molecules involved.
This is reflected in the observed strong correlation of the lifetime with the
local coordination number of the associated methyl groups. The elongated w-D
h-bond lifetime causes a slowdown of collective dynamics and affects the
lifetime of the w-w h-bond. This nonlinear feedback mechanism explains the
strong composition dependence of viscosity and anticipated to play a dominant
role in many self-assemblies. Furthermore, the w-D hydrogen bond breaking
mechanism changes from low to high DMSO concentration, a phenomenon not
anticipated a priori. We introduce a new order parameter-based free energy
surface of the bond breaking pathway. A two-dimensional transition state rate
theory (TSRT) calculation is performed for the lifetime of the w-D h-bond that
is found to be semi-quantitatively accurate

<p>Extending the scope of the self-imaging phenomenon, traditionally associated
with linear optics, to the domain of magnonics, this study presents the
experimental demonstration and numerical analysis of spin-wave (SW)
self-imaging in an in-plane magnetized yttrium iron garnet film. We explore
this phenomenon using a setup in which a plane SW passes through a diffraction
grating, and the resulting interference pattern is detected using Brillouin
light scattering. We have varied the frequencies of the source dynamic magnetic
field to discern the influence of the anisotropic dispersion relation and the
caustic effect on the analyzed phenomenon. We found that at low frequencies and
diffraction fields, the caustics determine the interference pattern. However,
at large distances from the grating, when the waves of high diffraction order
and number of slits contribute to the interference pattern, the self-imaging
phenomenon and Talbot-like patterns are formed. This methodological approach
not only sheds light on the behavior of SW interference under different
conditions but also enhances our understanding of the SW self-imaging process
in both isotropic and anisotropic media.

<p>(111)NiO epitaxial films are grown on c-sapphire substrates at various growth
temperatures ranging from room-temperature to 600C using pulsed laser
deposition (PLD) technique. Two series of samples, where different laser
fluences are used to ablate the target, are studied here. Films grown with
higher laser fluence, are found to be embedded with Ni-clusters
crystallographically aligned with the (111)NiO matrix. While the layers grown
with lower laser energy density exhibit p-type conductivity specially at low
growth temperatures. X-ray diffraction study shows the coexistence of biaxial
compressive and tensile hydrostatic strains in these samples, which results in
an expansion of the lattice primarily along the growth direction. This
effective uniaxial expansion {epsilon}_perpendicular increases with the
reduction of the growth temperature. Band gap of these samples is found to
decrease linearly with {epsilon}_perpendicular. This result is validated by
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Experimental findings and the
theoretical study further indicate that V_Ni + O_I and V_O + Ni_I complexes
exist as the dominant native defects in samples grown with Ni-deficient (low
laser fluence) and Ni-rich (high laser fluence) conditions, respectively.
P-type conductivity observed in the samples grown in Ni-deficient condition is
more likely to be resulting from V_Ni + O_I defects than Ni-vacancies (V_Ni).

<p>Magnetic skyrmions are topological magnetic textures that hold great promise
as nanoscale bits of information in memory and logic devices. Although
room-temperature ferromagnetic skyrmions and their current-induced manipulation
have been demonstrated, their velocity has been limited to about 100 meters per
second. In addition, their dynamics are perturbed by the skyrmion Hall effect,
a motion transverse to the current direction caused by the skyrmion topological
charge. Here, we show that skyrmions in compensated synthetic antiferromagnets
can be moved by current along the current direction at velocities of up to 900
meters per second. This can be explained by the cancellation of the net
topological charge leading to a vanishing skyrmion Hall effect. Our results
open an important path toward the realization of logic and memory devices based
on the fast manipulation of skyrmions in tracks.

<p>Magnesium alloys are emerging as promising alternatives to traditional
orthopedic implant materials thanks to their biodegradability,
biocompatibility, and impressive mechanical characteristics. However, their
rapid in-vivo degradation presents challenges, notably in upholding mechanical
integrity over time. This study investigates the impact of high-temperature
thermal processing on the mechanical and degradation attributes of a lean
Mg-Zn-Ca-Mn alloy, ZX10. Utilizing rapid, cost-efficient characterization
methods like X-ray diffraction and optical, we swiftly examine microstructural
changes post-thermal treatment. Employing Pearson correlation coefficient
analysis, we unveil the relationship between microstructural properties and
critical targets (properties): hardness and corrosion resistance. Additionally,
leveraging the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), we
pinpoint the dominant microstructural factors among closely correlated
variables. Our findings underscore the significant role of grain size
refinement in strengthening and the predominance of the ternary Ca2Mg6Zn3 phase
in corrosion behavior. This suggests that achieving an optimal blend of
strength and corrosion resistance is attainable through fine grains and reduced
concentration of ternary phases. This thorough investigation furnishes valuable
insights into the intricate interplay of processing, structure, and properties
in magnesium alloys, thereby advancing the development of superior
biodegradable implant materials.

<p>We provide effective tight-binding models of monolayer and bilayer hexagonal
boron nitride (h-BN) informed by ab initio density functional theory
calculations within the local density approximation using maximally localized
Wannier functions centered at the boron and nitrogen sites. An effective
intra-layer tight-binding model with up to four distant hopping neighbors
captures the band energies near the K-point and M-point in the Brillouin zone,
including the indirect nature of the band gap for certain stackings. We then
propose a two-center interlayer tight-binding model that can be used for any
stacking in bilayer h-BN based on the relative distance between two atomic
sites which can be used to model twisted h-BN structures.
