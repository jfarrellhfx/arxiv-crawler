<h3>Phase separation of active Brownian particles on curved surfaces</h3>

The effect of curvature on an ensemble of repulsive active Brownian particles
(ABPs) moving on a spherical surface is studied. Surface curvature strongly
affects the dynamics of ABPs, as it introduces a new time scale $\tau=R/v_0$,
with curvature radius $R$ and propulsion velocity $v_0$, in addition to the
rotational diffusion time $\tau_r$. This implies that motility-induced phase
separation (MIPS) disappears for small $R$. Furthermore, it causes a narrowing
of the MIPS regime in the phase diagram of P{\'e}clet number $\text{Pe}$ and
particle area fraction $\phi$. Also, the phase-separation boundary at low
$\phi$ attains a turning point at small $R$, allowing for the possibility of a
reentrant behavior. These results characterize the effect of curvature on ABP
dynamics and MIPS, and will help to better understand the preferred occupation
of certain niches by bacterial colonies in porous media.

<h3>Universal equation of state for wave turbulence in a quantum gas</h3>

Boyle's 1662 observation that the volume of a gas is, at constant
temperature, inversely proportional to pressure, offered a prototypical example
of how an equation of state (EoS) can succinctly capture key properties of a
many-particle system. Such relations are now cornerstones of equilibrium
thermodynamics. Extending thermodynamic concepts to far-from-equilibrium
systems is of great interest in various contexts including glasses, active
matter, and turbulence, but is in general an open problem. Here, using a
homogeneous ultracold atomic Bose gas, we experimentally construct an EoS for a
turbulent cascade of matter waves. Under continuous forcing at a large length
scale and dissipation at a small one, the gas exhibits a non-thermal, but
stationary state, which is characterised by a power-law momentum distribution
sustained by a scale-invariant momentum-space energy flux. We establish the
amplitude of the momentum distribution and the underlying energy flux as
equilibrium-like state variables, related by an EoS that does not depend on the
details of the energy injection or dissipation, or the history of the system.
Moreover, we show that the equations of state for a wide range of interaction
strengths and gas densities can be empirically scaled onto each other. This
results in a universal dimensionless EoS that sets benchmarks for the theory
and should also be relevant for other turbulent systems.

<h3>Spin-pumping from a ferromagnetic insulator to an unconventional  superconductor with interfacial Andreev bound-states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08091" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08091</a>
<br>
<i>Chi Sun, Jacob Linder</i>
<br>
<br>
Spin-pumping from a ferromagnetic insulator into a high-$T_c$ superconductor
with a $d$-wave superconducting order parameter has recently been
experimentally observed. Such unconventional superconducting order is known to
produce interfacial bound-states for certain crystallographic orientations.
Here, we present a methodology which can be used to study spin-pumping into
unconventional superconductors, including the role of interfacial bound-states.
As an example, we determine how the crystallographic orientation of the
$d$-wave order parameter relative the interface changes the spin-pumping
effect. We find that the spin-pumping effect is slightly enhanced at low
temperatures for orientations hosting interfacial bound-states compared to
other superconducting states. However, the spin-pumping effect does not show a
coherence peak close to $T_c$ for such orientations, and instead remains
smaller than the normal state value for all $T$. For orientations not hosting
interfacial bound-states, we find that the pumped spin current can be increased
to several times the normal-state spin current at frequencies that are small
compared to the superconducting gap. Our results show that the spin-pumping
dependency on frequency and temperature changes qualitatively depending on the
crystallographic orientation of unconventional superconducting order parameters
relative the interface.

<h3>Dynamical renormalization of electron-phonon coupling in conventional  superconductors</h3>

The adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation is considered to be a robust
approach that very rarely breaks down. Consequently, it is predominantly
utilized to address various electron-phonon properties in condensed matter
physics. By combining many-body perturbation and density functional theories we
demonstrate the importance of dynamical (nonadiabatic) effects in estimating
superconducting properties in various bulk and two-dimensional materials. Apart
from the expected long-wavelength nonadiabatic effects, we found sizable
nonadiabatic Kohn anomalies away from the Brillouin zone center for materials
with strong intervalley electron-phonon scatterings. Compared to the adiabatic
result, these dynamical phonon anomalies can significantly modify
electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda$ and superconducting transition
temperature $T_c$. Further, the dynamically-induced modifications of $\lambda$
have a strong impact on transport properties, where probably the most
interesting is the rescaling of the low-temperature and low-frequency regime of
the scattering time $1/\tau$ from about $T^3$ to about $T^2$, resembling the
Fermi liquid result for electron-electron scattering. Our goal is to point out
the potential implications of these nonadiabatic effects and reestablish their
pivotal role in computational estimations of electron-phonon properties.

<h3>Superconductivity by alloying the topological insulator SnBi2Te4</h3>

<br>
<br>
Alloying indium into the topological insulator Sn1-xInxBi2Te4 induces bulk
superconductivity with critical temperatures Tc up to 1.85 K and upper critical
fields up to about 14 kOe. This is confirmed by electrical resistivity, heat
capacity, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The heat capacity shows a
discontinuity at Tc and temperature dependence below Tc consistent with weak
coupling BCS theory, and suggests a superconducting gap near 0.25 meV. The
superconductivity is type-II and the topological surface states have been
verified by photoemission. A simple picture suggests analogies with the
isostructural magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4, in which a natural
heterostructure hosts complementary properties on different sublattices, and
motivates new interest in this large family of compounds. The existence of both
topological surface states and superconductivity in Sn1-xInxBi2Te4 identifies
these materials as promising candidates for the study of topological
superconductivity.

<h3>Competition of glass and crystal: phase-field model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08133" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08133</a>

<i>M. G. Vasin, V. Ankudinov</i>
<br>
<br>
The phase-field model for the description of the solidification processes
with the glass-crystal competition is suggested. The model combines the
first-order phase transition model in the phase-field formalism and gauge-field
theory of glass transition. We present a self-consistent system of stochastic
motion equations for unconserved order parameters describing the crystal-like
short-range ordering and vitrification. It is shown, that the model
qualitatively describes the glass-crystal competition during quenching with
finite cooling speed. The nucleation of the crystalline phase at slow cooling
speeds and low undercoolings proceeds by a fluctuation mechanism. The model
demonstrates the tendency to amorphization with the increase of its cooling
rate.

<h3>Nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution in superconducting resonators:  analytical approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08155" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08155</a>
<br>
<i>P. B. Fischer, G. Catelani</i>
<br>
<br>
In the superconducting state, the presence of a finite gap in the excitation
spectrum implies that the number of excitations (quasiparticles) is
exponentially small at temperatures well below the critical one. Conversely,
minute perturbations can significantly impact both the distribution in energy
and number of quasiparticles. Typically, the interaction with the
electromagnetic environment is the main perturbation source driving
quasiparticles out of thermal equilibrium, while a phonon bath is responsible
for restoration of equilibrium. Here we derive approximate analytical solutions
for the quasiparticle distribution function in superconducting resonators and
explore the impact of nonequilibrium on two measurable quantities: the
resonator's quality factor and its resonant frequency. Applying our results to
experimental data, we conclude that while at intermediate temperatures there is
clear evidence for the nonequilibrium effects due to heating of the
quasiparticles by photons, the low-temperature measurements are not explained
by this mechanism.

<h3>Coreless vortices as direct signature of chiral $d$-wave  superconductivity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08156" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08156</a>
<br>
<i>Patric Holmvall, Annica M. Black-Schaffer</i>
<br>
<br>
Chiral $d$-wave superconductivity has been proposed in a number of different
materials, but characteristic experimental fingerprints have been largely
lacking. We show that quadruply quantized coreless vortices are prone to form
and offer distinctive signatures of the chiral $d$-wave state in both the local
density of states and the total magnetic moment. Their dissimilarity in
positive versus negative magnetic fields further leads to additional
spontaneous symmetry breaking, producing clear evidence of time-reversal
symmetry breaking, chiral superconductivity, and the Chern number.

Moir\'e systems provide a highly tunable platform for engineering band
structures and exotic correlated phases. Here, we theoretically study a model
for a single layer of graphene subject to a smooth moir\'e electrostatic
potential, induced by a insulating substrate layer. For sufficiently large
moir\'e unit cells, we find that ultra-flat bands coexist with a triangular
network of chiral one-dimensional (1D) channels. These channels mediate an
effective interaction between localized modes with spin-, orbital- and valley
degrees of freedom emerging from the flat bands. The form of the interaction
reflects the chiralilty and 1D nature of the network. We study this interacting
model within an $SU(4)$ mean-field theory, focusing on commensurate order
stabilized by local two-site and chiral three-site interactions. By tuning gate
voltage, one can trigger a non-coplanar phase characterized by a peculiar
coexistence of three different types of order: ferromagnetic spin order in one
valley, non-coplanar chiral spin order in the other valley and 120$^\circ$
order in remaining spin and valley-mixed degrees of freedom.

<h3>Spectral Emission Properties of a Nitrogen-doped Diamond(001)  Photocathode: Hot Electron Transport and Transverse Momentum Filtering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08201" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08201</a>

<br>
<br>
The electron emission properties of a single-crystal nitrogen-doped
diamond(001) photocathode inserted in a 10kV DC photoelectron gun are
determined using a tunable (235-410nm) ultraviolet laser radiation source for
photoemission from both the back nitrogen-doped substrate face and the front
homo-epitaxially grown and undoped diamond crystal face. The measured spectral
trends of the mean transverse energy (MTE) and quantum efficiency (QE) of the
emitted electrons are both anomalous and non-monotonic, but are shown to be
consistent with (i) the known physics of electron photoexcitation from the
nitrogen substitution states into the conduction bands of diamond, (ii) the
energy position and dispersion characteristics of the conduction bands of
diamond in the (001) emission direction, (iii) the effective electron affinity
of the crystal faces, (iv) the strong electron-(optical)phonon coupling in
diamond, and (v) the associated hot electron transport dynamics under energy
equipartition with the optical phonons. Notably, the observed hot electron
emission is shown to be restricted parallel to the photocathode surface by the
low transverse effective masses of the emitting band states - a transverse
momentum filtering effect.

<h3>Weyl excitations and arc surface states via helicon-phonon mixing in  conducting materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08213" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08213</a>
<br>
<i>Dmitry K. Efimkin, and Sergey Syzranov</i>
<br>
<br>
Quasiparticles with Weyl dispersion can display an abundance of novel
topological, thermodynamic and transport phenomena, which is why novel Weyl
materials and platforms for Weyl physics are being intensively looked for in
electronic, magnetic, photonic and acoustic systems. We demonstrate that
conducting materials in magnetic fields generically host Weyl excitations due
to the hybridization of phonons with helicons, collective neutral modes of
electrons interacting with electromagnetic waves propagating in the material.
Such Weyl excitations are, in general, created by the interactions of helicons
with longitudinal acoustic phonons. In polar crystals, an additional type of
Weyl excitations comes from the interaction between helicons and longitudinal
optical phonons. Such excitations can be detected in X-ray and Raman scattering
experiments. The existence of the Weyl excitations involving optical phonons in
the bulk of the materials also leads to the formation of topologically
protected surface arc states that can be detected via surface plasmon
resonance.

<h3>Scaling law for three-body collisions near a narrow s-wave Feshbach  resonance</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08257" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08257</a>
<br>
<i>Yirou Xu, Shiyin Kuang, Shuai Peng, Jiaming Li, Le Luo</i>
<br>
<br>
Generalized Efimov physics can be applied to describe three-body collisions
in ultracold gases, revealing a scattering length scaling law of three-body
recombination rate. Previously such scaling law has been intensively studied in
the bosonic systems, but its behavior with fermionic atoms remains elusive. In
this paper, we report on an experimental study of the scaling law for the
three-body atomic loss rate $L_3$ near the narrow $s$-wave Feshbach resonance
in a two-component ultracold $^6$Li Fermi gas. The scaling law in the regime
with the scattering length $a<0$ is validated, where $L_3$ is scaling as
$T|a|^{2.46 +- 0.05}$ as predicted by the adiabatical hyperspherical
respresentation with the gas temperature $T$. The observation of such scaling
law is limited by two effects. When $a\rightarrow \infty$, the three-body
heating as well as the unitary behavior shifts the power-law relation to a more
smooth scattering length dependence. In the vicinity of $a\rightarrow 0$, we
study the finite range correction by deriving $L_3$ dependence on the effective
collision length $L_e$, and observe the finite range effects on the scaling
law. Our studies on the collisional behavior near the narrow Feshbach resonance
help to explore the few-body physics with a realistic interatomic potential
with a finite range.

<br>
<br>
Electronic resonances can significantly enhance the photon-phonon coupling in
cavity optomechanics, but are normally avoided due to absorption losses and
dephasing by inhomogeneous broadening. We experimentally demonstrate that
exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities enable GHz optomechanics with
single-particle resonant couplings reaching record values in the 10s of MHz
range. Moreover, this resonant enhancement is protected from inhomogeneous
broadening by the Rabi gap. Single-polariton non-linearities and the
optomechanical strong-coupling regime become accessible in this platform.

<h3>Transverse currents in spin transistors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08301" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08301</a>
<br>
<i>Bijay Kumar Sahoo, Abhiram Soori</i>
<br>
<br>
In a variety of systems such as topological insulators and spin-orbit coupled
materials, it is known that Hall conductance arises due to an in-plane Zeeman
field. This effect known as planar Hall effect is rooted in spin-orbit coupling
of the system. A spin transistor proposed by Datta and Das on the other hand
consists of ferromagnetic leads connected to spin-orbit coupled central region
and its conductance can be controlled by tuning the strength of spin-orbit
coupling. In this work, we investigate transverse currents in a system where
two-dimensional ferromagnets are connected to a central spin-orbit coupled
two-dimensional electron gas. We find that the spin transistor exhibits a
nonzero transverse conductivity which depends on the direction of polarization
in ferromagnets and the location. We study the conductivities for the system
with finite and infinite widths. The conductivities exhibit Fabry-P\'erot type
oscillations as the length of the spin-orbit coupled regions is varied.

<h3>Percolation critical exponents in cluster kinetics of pulse-coupled  oscillators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08313" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08313</a>
<br>
<i>Gangyong Gwon, Young Sul Cho</i>
<br>
<br>
Transient dynamics leading to the synchrony of pulse-coupled oscillators has
previously been studied as an aggregation process of synchronous clusters, and
a rate equation for the cluster size distribution has been proposed. However,
the evolution of the cluster size distribution for general cluster sizes has
not been solved yet. In this paper, we study the evolution of the cluster size
distribution from the perspective of a percolation model by regarding the
number of aggregations as the number of attached bonds. Specifically, we derive
the scaling form of the cluster size distribution with specific values of the
critical exponents using the property that the characteristic cluster size
diverges as the percolation threshold is approached from below. Through
simulation, it is confirmed that the scaling form well explains the evolution
of the cluster size distribution. Based on the distribution behavior, we find
that a giant cluster of all oscillators is formed discontinuously at the
threshold and also that further aggregation does not occur like in a
one-dimensional bond percolation model. Finally, we discuss the origin of the
discontinuous formation of the giant cluster from the perspective of global
suppression in explosive percolation models. For this, we approximate the
aggregation process as a cluster--cluster aggregation with a given collision
kernel. We believe that the theoretical approach presented in this paper can be
used to understand the transient dynamics of a broad range of synchronizations.

<h3>Topological Edge Conduction Induced by Strong Anisotropic Exchange  Interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08316" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08316</a>
<br>
<i>Shehrin Sayed, Pratik Brahma, Cheng-Hsiang Hsu, Sayeef Salahuddin</i>
<br>
<br>
We predict that an interplay between isotropic and anisotropic exchange
interactions in a honeycomb lattice structure can lead to topological edge
conduction when the anisotropic interaction is at least twice the strength of
the isotropic interaction. For materials like Na$_2$IrO$_3$, such a strong
anisotropic exchange interaction simultaneously induces a zigzag type of
antiferromagnetic order that breaks the time-reversal symmetry of the
topological edge conductor. We show that the electronic transport in such
topological conductors will exhibit a quantized Hall conductance without any
external magnetic field when the Fermi energy lies within a particular energy
range.

<h3>Chirality inversion and radius blow-up of a Néel-type skyrmion by a  Pearl vortex</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08351" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08351</a>
<br>
<i>S. S. Apostoloff, E. S. Andriyakhina, P. A. Vorobyev, Oleg A. Tretiakov, I. S. Burmistrov</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a theory for the coaxial configuration of a N\'eel-type skyrmion
and a Pearl vortex in thin superconductor-chiral ferromagnetic
heterostructures. Using direct numerical solution of the Euler-Lagrange
equation and micromagnetic simulations we demonstrate that the inhomogeneous
magnetic field of the Pearl vortex significantly modifies the skyrmion profile
with respect to the one in the absence of the vortex. We discover drastic
enlargement of the skyrmion's radius and inversion of the skyrmion's chirality.
To unravel physics behind these effects we invent novel two-parameter ansatz
for the magnetization profile of the skyrmion in the presence of the vortex.
Chirality inversion and radius blow-up are controlled not only by the material
parameters of the heterostructure but also by the thickness of the
superconductor. Our findings can have implications for Majorana modes localized
at skyrmion-vortex pairs.

We develop the rheology of a dilute granular gas mixture. Motivated by the
interaction of charged granular particles, we assume that the grains interact
via a square shoulder and well potential. Employing kinetic theory, we compute
the temperature and the shear viscosity as functions of the shear rate.
Numerical simulations confirm our results above the critical shear rate. At a
shear rate below a critical value, clustering of the particles occurs.

LiFePO$_4$ (LFPO) is an archetypical and well-known cathode material for
rechargeable Li-ion batteries. However, its quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D)
structure along with the Fe ions, LFPO also displays interesting
low-temperature magnetic properties. Our team has previously utilized the muon
spin rotation ($\mu^+$SR) technique to investigate both magnetic spin order as
well as Li-ion diffusion in LFPO. In this initial study we extend our
investigation and make use of high-pressure $\mu^+$SR to investigate effects on
the low-$T$ magnetic order. Contrary to theoretical predictions we find that
the magnetic ordering temperature as well as the ordered magnetic moment
increase at high pressure (compressive strain).

Exciton dynamics dictate the evolution of photoexcited carriers in
photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices. However, interpreting their
experimental signatures is a challenging theoretical problem due to the
presence of both electron-phonon and many-electron interactions. We develop and
apply here a first-principles approach to exciton dynamics resulting from
exciton-phonon coupling in monolayer MoS2 and reveal the highly selective
nature of exciton-phonon coupling due to the internal spin structure of
excitons, which leads to a surprisingly long lifetime of the lowest energy
bright A exciton. Moreover, we show that optical absorption processes
rigorously require a second-order perturbation theory approach, with photon and
phonon treated on an equal footing, as proposed by Toyozawa and Hopfield. Such
a treatment, thus far neglected in first-principles studies, gives rise to
off-diagonal exciton-phonon coupling matrix elements, which are critical for
the description of dephasing mechanisms, and yields exciton linewidths in
excellent agreement with experiment.

<h3>A two-scale FEM-BAM approach for fingerpad friction under  electroadhesion</h3>

<br>
<br>
The complex physics behind electroadhesion-based tactile displays poses an
enormous modeling challenge since not only the fingerpad structure with
multiple nonlinear layers, but also the roughness at the microscopic scale play
a decisive role. To investigate tactile perception, a potential model should
also offer the possibility to extract mechanical stimuli at the sites of the
relevant mechanoreceptors. In this paper, we present a two-scale approach that
involves a finite element model (FEM) at the macroscopic scale and a simple
bearing area model (BAM) that accounts for the measured roughness on the
papillary ridges. Both separate scales couple in an iterative way using the
concept of an equivalent air gap. We show that the electroadhesion-induced
changes in friction and contact area predicted by the proposed model are in
qualitative agreement with recent experimental studies. In a simple example, we
demonstrate that the model can readily be extended by a neural dynamics model

<h3>Compositional phase stability in medium-entropy and high-entropy  Cantor-Wu alloys from an ab initio all-electron, Landau-type theory and  atomistic modelling</h3>

We describe implementation and analysis of a first-principles theory, derived
in an earlier work, for the leading terms in an expansion of a Gibbs free
energy of a multi-component alloy in terms of order parameters that
characterize potential, compositional phases. The theory includes effects of
rearranging charge and other electronics from changing atomic occupancies on
lattice sites. As well as the rigorous description of atomic short-range order
in the homogeneously disordered phase, pairwise interaction parameters suited
for atomistic modelling in a multicomponent setting can be calculated. From our
study of an indicative series of the Cantor-Wu alloys, NiCo, NiCoCr, NiCoFeCr,
and NiCoFeMnCr, we find that the interactions are not approximated well either
as pseudobinary or restricted to nearest neighbour range. Our computed
order-disorder transition temperatures are low, consistent with experimental
observations, and the nature of the ordering is dominated by correlations
between Ni, Co, and Cr, while Fe and Mn interact weakly. Further atomistic
modelling suggests that there is no true single-phase low-temperature ground
state for these multicomponent systems. Instead the single-phase solid solution
is kept stable to low temperatures by the large configurational entropy and the
Fe, Mn dilution effects. The computationally cost-effectiveness of our method
makes it a good candidate for further exploration of the space of
multicomponent alloys.

<br>
<br>
We have synthesized single-crystal samples of $\beta$-VOSO$_4$ and fully
characterized their magnetic properties. Our magnetic susceptibility, high
field magnetization and inelastic neutron scattering results are in excellent
agreement with theoretical expressions for a one-dimensional spin-1/2
Heisenberg chain with an exchange parameter of 3.83(2) meV. Ab-initio
calculations identify the superexchange pathway, revealing that the spin-chain
does not run along the expected crystallographic chain a-direction but instead
between V4+O6 octahedra linked via SO4 tetrahedra along the b-axis. We do not
detect any phase transition to a long-range magnetic order within our
experimental conditions, indicating $\beta$-VOSO$_4$ is very close to an ideal
one-dimensional magnetic system.

<h3>Universal properties of single particle excitations across the many-body  localization transition</h3>

Understanding the nature of the transition from the delocalized to the
many-body localized (MBL) phase is an important unresolved issue. To probe the
nature of the MBL transition, we investigate the universal properties of
single-particle excitations produced in highly excited many-body eigenstates of
a disordered interacting quantum many-body system. In a class of
one-dimensional spinless fermionic models, we study the finite size scaling of
the ratio of typical to average values of the single-particle local density of
states and the scattering rates across the MBL transition. Our results indicate
that the MBL transition in this class of one-dimensional models of spinless
fermions is continuous in nature. The critical exponent $\nu$ with which the
correlation length $\xi$ diverges at the transition point $W_c$, $\xi \sim
|W-W_c|^{-\nu}$, satisfies the Chayes-Chayes-Fisher-Spencer(CCFS) bound $\nu
\ge 2/d$ where $d$ is the physical dimension of the system. The transition
point $W_c$ and the critical exponent $\nu$ do not change significantly with
the range of interactions between fermions as long as the hopping is short
range.

<h3>Entanglement negativity in a nonequilibrium steady state</h3>

<br>
<i>Viktor Eisler</i>
<br>
<br>
We study entanglement properties in a nonequilibrium steady state of a
free-fermion chain, that emerges after connecting two half-chains prepared at
different temperatures. The entanglement negativity and the R\'enyi mutual
information between two adjacent intervals scale logarithmically in the system
size, with prefactors that we calculate analytically as a function of the bath
temperatures. In particular, we show that the negativity and the R\'enyi mutual
information with index $\alpha=1/2$ are described by different prefactors, and
thus the two quantities provide inequivalent information about the state.
Furthermore, we show that the logarithmic growth of the negativity during time
evolution is also governed by the steady-state prefactor.

<h3>Mesh d-refinement: a data-based computational framework to account for  complex material response</h3>

Model-free data-driven computational mechanics (DDCM) is a new paradigm for
simulations in solid mechanics. The modeling step associated to the definition
of a material constitutive law is circumvented through the introduction of an
abstract phase space in which, following a pre-defined rule,
physically-admissible states are matched to observed material response data
(coming from either experiments or lower-scale simulations). In terms of
computational resources, the search procedure that performs these matches is
the most onerous step in the algorithm. One of the main advantages of DDCM is
the fact that it avoids regression-based, bias-prone constitutive modeling.
However, many materials do display a simple linear response in the small-strain
regime while also presenting complex behavior after a certain deformation
threshold. Motivated by this fact, we present a novel refinement technique that
turns regular elements (equipped with a linear-elastic constitutive law) into
data-driven ones if they are expected to surpass the threshold known to trigger
material non-linear response. We term this technique ``data refinement'',
``d-refinement'' for short. Starting from an initially regular FEM mesh, the
proposed algorithm detects where the refinement is needed and iterates until
all elements presumed to display non-linearity become data-driven ones.
Insertion criteria are discussed. The scheme is well-suited for simulations
that feature non-linear response in relatively small portions of the domain
while the rest remains linear-elastic. The method is validated against a
traditional incremental solver (i.e., Newton-Raphson method) and we show that
the d-refinement framework can outperform it in terms of speed at no loss of
accuracy. We provide an application that showcases the advantage of the new
method: bridging scales in architected metamaterials.

The structures of equimolar mixtures of the commonly used polar aprotic
solvents dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylacetamide (DMAc) in
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) have been investigated via neutron diffraction
augmented by extensive hydrogen/deuterium isotopic substitution. Detailed
3-dimensional structural models of these solutions have been derived from the
neutron data via Empirical Potential Structure Refinement (EPSR).The
intermolecular Centre-of-Mass (CoM) distributions show that the first
coordination shell of the amides comprises 13-14 neighbours, of which
approximately half are DMSO. In spite of this near ideal coordination shell
mixing, the changes to the amide-amide structure are found to be relatively
subtle when compared to the pure liquids. Analysis of specific intermolecular
atom-atom correlations allows quantitative interpretation of the competition
between weak interactions in solution. We find a hierarchy of formic and methyl
C-H to O hydrogen bonds form the dominant local motifs, with peak positions in
the range 2.5-3.0 {\AA}. We also observe a rich variety of steric and
dispersion interactions, including those involving the amide pi-backbones. This
detailed insight into the structural landscape of these important liquids
demonstrates the versatility of DMSO as a solvent and the unparalleled
resolution of neutron diffraction, which is critical for understanding weak
intermolecular interactions at the nanoscale and thereby tailoring solvent
properties to specific applications.

The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator is a topological quantum state
with quantized Hall resistance and zero longitudinal resistance in the absence
of an external magnetic field. The QAH insulator carries spin-polarized
dissipation-free chiral edge current and thus provides a unique opportunity to
develop energy-efficient transformative information technology. Despite
promising advances on the QAH effect over the past decade, the QAH insulator
has thus far eluded any practical applications. In addition to its low working
temperature, the QAH state in magnetically doped topological insulator (TI)
films/heterostructures usually deteriorates with time in ambient conditions. In
this work, we prepare three QAH devices with similar initial properties and
store them in different environments to investigate the evolution of their
transport properties. The QAH device without a protection layer in air show
clear degradation and becomes hole-doped with the charge neutral point shifting
significantly to positive gate voltages. The QAH device kept in an argon glove
box without a protection layer shows no measurable degradation after 560 hours
and the device protected by a 3 nm AlOx protection layer in air shows minimal
degradation with stable QAH properties. Our work shows a route to preserve the
dissipation-free chiral edge state in QAH devices for potential applications in
quantum information technology.

<h3>Geometric scaling behaviors of the Fortuin-Kasteleyn Ising model in high  dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08544" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08544</a>
<br>
<i>Sheng Fang, Zongzheng Zhou, Youjin Deng</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, we argued [Chin. Phys. Lett. $39$, 080502 (2022)] that the Ising
model simultaneously exhibits two upper critical dimensions $(d_c=4, d_p=6)$ in
the Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) random-cluster representation. In this paper, we
perform a systematic study of the FK Ising model on hypercubic lattices with
spatial dimensions $d$ from 5 to 7, and on the complete graph. We provide
detailed data analysis to the critical behaviors of a variety of quantities at
and near the critical points. Our results clearly show that many quantities
exhibit distinct critical phenomena for $4 < d < 6$ and $d\geq 6$, and thus
strongly support the argument that $6$ is also an upper critical dimension.
Moreover, in each spatial dimension, there are simultaneous existence of two
configuration sectors, of two length scales as well as of two scaling windows,
and thus, two sets of critical exponents are needed to describe these
behaviors. Our finding enriches the understanding of the critical phenomena in
the Ising model.

<h3>Unraveling effects of electron correlation in two-dimensional  Fe$_{n}$GeTe$_{2}$ (n=3, 4, 5) by dynamical mean field theory</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Fe$_{n}$GeTe$_{2}$ systems are newly discovered two-dimensional
van-der-Waals materials, exhibiting magnetism at room temperature. The
sub-systems belonging to Fe$_{n}$GeTe$_{2}$ class are special because they show
site-dependent magnetic behavior. We focus on the critical evaluation of
magnetic properties and electron correlation effects in Fe$_{n}$GeTe$_{2}$
($n$= 3, 4, 5) (FGT) systems performing first-principles calculations. Three
different ab-initio approaches have been used, viz., i) standard density
functional theory (DFT), ii) incorporating static electron correlation (DFT+U)
and iii) inclusion of dynamic electron correlation effect (DFT+DMFT). Our
results show that DFT+DMFT is the most accurate technique to correctly
reproduce the magnetic interactions and experimentally observed transition
temperatures. The inaccurate values of structural parameters, magnetic moments
and exchange interactions obtained from DFT+U make this method inapplicable for
the FGT family. Correct determination of magnetic properties for this class of
materials is important since they are promising candidates for spin transport
and spintronic applications at room temperature.

<h3>Electronic Structure and Core Spectroscopy of Scandium Fluoride  Polymorphs</h3>

<br>
<br>
The microscopic knowledge of the structural, energetic, and electronic
properties of scandium fluoride is still incomplete, despite the relevance of
this material as an intermediate for the manufacturing of Al-Sc alloys. In a
work based on first-principles calculations and x-ray spectroscopy, we assess
the stability and the electronic structure of six computationally predicted
ScF$_3$ polymorphs, two of which correspond to experimentally resolved
single-crystal phases. In the theoretical analysis based on density-functional
theory (DFT), we identify similarities among the polymorphs based on their
formation energies, charge-density distribution, and electronic properties
(band gaps and density of states). We find striking analogies between the
results obtained for the low- and high-temperature phases of the material,
indirectly confirming that the transition occurring between them mainly
consists of a rigid rotation of the lattice. With this knowledge, we examine
the x-ray absorption spectra from the Sc and F K-edge contrasting
first-principles results obtained from the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter
equation on top of all-electron DFT with high-energy-resolution fluorescence
detection measurements. The analysis of the computational results sheds light
on the electronic origin of the absorption maxima and provides information on
the prominent excitonic effects that characterize all spectra. Comparison with
measurements confirms that the sample is mainly composed of the high- and
low-temperature polymorphs of ScF$_3$. However, some fine details in the
experimental results suggest that the probed powder sample may contain defects
and/or residual traces of metastable polymorphs.

<i>Leidy Katherin Eraso Hernández, Alejandro Pérez Riascos</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, we study the synchronization of identical phase Kuramoto
oscillators under cumulative stochastic damage on the edges of networks. We
analyze the time that oscillators need to reach a coherent state and how it
changes when damage reduces the connectivity of the network. We explore
different structures, deterministic networks as a wheel or the lattice formed
by the movements of the knight on a chess board, and random networks generated
with the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and Barab\'asi-Albert algorithms. Also, we study the
synchronization times of 109 non-isomorphic graphs with six nodes. We introduce
different quantities that measure the reduction of the capacity of
synchronization allowing us to classify the effect of damage in these
structures. The approach is general and paves the way for the exploration of
the effect of accumulation of damage in different dynamical processes in
complex systems.

We propose and experimentally verify two methods to scale arbitrary units to
photocurrent spectral density (A/eV) in Fourier Transform Photocurrent (FTPC)
spectroscopy. We also propose the FTPC scaling to responsivity (A/W), provided
a narrow-band optical power measurement is available. The constant background
of the interferogram provides a precise determination of the photocurrent
spectral density. The second method relies on the scaled amplitude of the
interferogram. Although the latter method leads to more significant errors, it
still provides good order of magnitude estimates of the total photocurrent. We
demonstrate the technique on a calibrated InGaAs diode and weak responsivity
SiC interdigital sensors. We identify a series of impurity-band and interband
transitions in the SiC sensors.

Kagome-lattice materials have attracted tremendous interest due to the broad
prospect for seeking superconductivity, quantum spin liquid states, and
topological electronic structures. Among them, the transition-metal Kagome
lattices are high-profile objects for the combination of topological
properties, rich magnetism, and multiple orbital physics. Here we report an
inelastic neutron scattering study on the spin dynamics of a Kagome-lattice
antiferromagnetic metal Fe$_{0.89}$Co$_{0.11}$Sn. Although the magnetic
excitations can be observed up to $\sim$250 meV, well-defined spin waves are
only identified below $\sim$90 meV, and can be modeled using Heisenberg
exchange with ferromagnetic in-plane nearest-neighbor coupling ($J_1$),
in-plane next-nearest-neighbor coupling ($J_2$), and antiferromagnetic (AFM)
interlayer coupling ($J_c$) under linear spin-wave theory. Above $\sim$90 meV,
the spin waves enter the itinerant Stoner continuum and become highly damped
particle-hole excitations. At the K point of the Brillouin zone, we reveal a
possible band crossing of the spin wave, which indicates a potential Dirac
magnon. Our results uncover the evolution of the spin excitations from the
planar AFM state to the axial AFM state in Fe$_{0.89}$Co$_{0.11}$Sn, solve the
magnetic Hamiltonian for both states, and confirm the significant influence of
the itinerant magnetism on the spin excitations.

Nonlinear sigma models appear in a wide variety of physics contexts, such as
the long-range order with spontaneously broken continuous global symmetries.
There are also large classes of quantum criticality admit sigma model
descriptions in their phase diagrams without known UV complete quantum field
theory descriptions. We investigate defects in general nonlinear sigma models
in any spacetime dimensions, which include the ``electric" defects that are
characterized by topological interactions on the defects, and the ``magnetic"
defects that are characterized by the isometries and homotopy groups. We use an
analogue of the charge-flux attachment to show that the magnetic defects are in
general non-invertible, and the electric and magnetic defects form junctions
that combine defects of different dimensions into analogues of higher-group
symmetry. We explore generalizations that couple nonlinear sigma models to
topological quantum field theories (TQFT) by defect attachment, which modifies
the non-invertible fusion and braiding of the defects. We discuss several
applications, including constraints on energy scales and scenarios of low
energy dynamics with spontaneously symmetry breaking in gauge theories, and
axion gauge theories.

<h3>Thermal expansion and the glass transition</h3>

<br>
Melting is well understood in terms of the Lindemann criterion, essentially
stating that crystalline materials melt when the thermal vibrations of their
atoms become such vigorous that they shake themselves free of the binding
forces. However, how about another common type of solids: glasses, where the
nature of the solid-liquid crossover is highly controversial? The Lindemann
criterion implies that the thermal expansion coefficients alpha of crystals are
inversely proportional to their melting temperatures. Here we find that,
unexpectedly, alpha of glasses decreases much stronger with increasing
glass-transition temperature Tg marking the liquid-solid crossover in this
material class. However, scaling alpha by the fragility m, a measure of
particle cooperativity, restores the proportionality, i.e., alpha/m ~ 1/Tg.
Obviously, for a glass to become liquid, it is not sufficient to simply
overcome the interparticle binding energies. Instead, more energy has to be
invested to break up the typical cooperative particle network which is
considered a hallmark feature of glassy materials. Surprisingly, alpha of the
liquid phase reveals similar anomalous behaviour and is universally enhanced by
a constant factor of ~3. The found universalities allow estimating
glass-transition temperatures from thermal expansion and vice versa.

Quantum annealing is a contender to solve combinatorial optimization problems
based on quantum dynamics. While significant efforts have been undertaken to
investigate the quality of the solutions and the required runtimes, much less
attention has been paid to understanding the dynamics of quantum annealing and
the process leading to the solution during the sweep itself. In this
comprehensive study, we investigate various aspects of the quantum annealing
dynamics using different approaches. We perform quantum annealing, simulated
quantum annealing, and classical annealing on several hundred instances of the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with intermediate system sizes up to 22 spins
using numerical simulations. We observe qualitative differences between the
quantum and classical methods, in particular at intermediate times, where a
peak in the fidelity, also known as diabatic bump, appears for hard instances.
Furthermore, we investigate the two-point correlation functions, which feature
differences at intermediate times as well. At short times, however, the methods
are similar again, which can be explained by relating the short-time expansion
of quantum annealing to a high-temperature expansion, thus allowing in
principle to find the classical solution already at short times, albeit at
prohibitive sampling cost.

<h3>Dynamical vortex transitions in a gate-tunable Josephson junction array</h3>

We explore vortex dynamics in a two-dimensional Josephson junction array of
micron-size superconducting islands fabricated from an epitaxial Al/InAs
superconductor-semiconductor heterostructure, with a global top gate
controlling Josephson coupling and vortex pinning strength. With applied dc
current, minima of differential resistance undergo a transition, becoming local
maxima at integer and half-integer flux quanta per plaquette, $f$. The
zero-field transition from the superconducting phase is split, but unsplit for
the anomalous metal phase, suggesting that pinned vortices are absent or sparse
in the superconducting phase, and abundant but frozen in the anomalous metal.
The onset of the transition is symmetric around $f=1/2$ but skewed around
$f=1$, consistent with a picture of dilute vortices/antivortices on top of a
checkerboard ($f = 1/2$) or uniform array of vortices ($f = 1$). Transitions
show good scaling but with exponents that differ from Mott values obtained
earlier. Besides the skewing at $f=1$, transitions show an overall even-odd
pattern of skewing around integer $f$ values, which we attribute to vortex
commensuration in the square array leading to symmetries around half-integer
$f$.

Many experimentally-accessible, finite-sized interacting quantum systems are
most appropriately described by the canonical ensemble of statistical
mechanics. Conventional numerical simulation methods either approximate them as
being coupled to a particle bath, or use projective algorithms which may suffer
from non-optimal scaling with system size or large algorithmic prefactors. In
this paper, we introduce a highly stable, recursive Auxiliary Field Quantum
Monte Carlo approach that can directly simulate systems in the canonical
ensemble. We apply the method to the fermion Hubbard model in one and two
spatial dimensions in a regime known to exhibit a significant ``sign'' problem
and find improved performance over existing approaches including rapid
convergence to ground state expectation values. The effects of excitations
above the ground state are quantified using an estimator-agnostic approach
including studying the temperature dependence of the purity and overlap
fidelity of the canonical and grand canonical density matrices. As an important
application, we show that thermometry approaches often exploited in ultra-cold
atoms that employ an analysis of the velocity distribution in the grand
canonical ensemble may be subject to errors leading to an under-estimation of
extracted temperatures with respect to the Fermi temperature.
