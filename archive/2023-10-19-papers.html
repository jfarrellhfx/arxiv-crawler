<h3>Electrically-driven amplification of terahertz acoustic waves in  graphene</h3>

In graphene devices, the electronic drift velocity can easily exceed the
speed of sound in the material at moderate current biases. Under this
condition, the electronic system can efficiently amplify acoustic phonons,
leading to the exponential growth of sound waves in the direction of the
carrier flow. Here, we demonstrate that such phonon amplification can
significantly modify the electrical properties of graphene devices. We observe
a super-linear growth of the resistivity in the direction of the carrier flow
when the drift velocity exceeds the speed of sound, causing up to a 7 times
increase over 8 micrometers. The resistance growth is observable for carrier
densities away from the Dirac point and is enhanced at cryogenic temperatures.
These observations are explained by a theoretical model for the
electrical-amplification of acoustic phonons, which reach frequencies up to 2.2
terahertz with the nanoscale wavelength set by gate-tunable ~kF transitions
across the Fermi surface. These findings offer a route to high-frequency
on-chip sound generation and detection, which can be used to modulate and probe
electronic physics in van der Waals heterostructures in the terahertz frequency
range.

The past decade has witnessed the development of systematic effective
theories for dissipative thermal systems. Here, we describe an analogous
effective theory framework that applies to the classical stochastic dynamics of
nonequilibrium systems. We illustrate this approach using a range of examples,
including nonreciprocal (predator-prey) dynamics, dissipative and driven
rigid-body motion, and active chiral fluids and solids. Many of these systems
exhibit a generalized time-reversal symmetry, which plays a crucial role within
our formalism, and in many cases can be implemented within the
Martin-Siggia-Rose path integral. This effective theory formalism yields
generalizations of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and second law of
thermodynamics valid out of equilibrium. By stipulating a stationary
distribution and a set of symmetries -- rather than postulating the stochastic
equations of motion directly -- this formalism provides an alternative route to
building phenomenological models of driven and active matter. We hope that this
approach facilitates a systematic investigation of the universality classes of
active matter, and provides a common language for nonequilibrium many-body
physics from high energy to condensed matter.

<h3>Giant magnetoresistance in weakly disordered non-Galilean invariant  conductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12195" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12195</a>
<br>
<i>Alex Levchenko, Songci Li, A. V. Andreev</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a hydrodynamic description of electron magnetotransport in
conductors without Galilean invariance in the presence of a weak long-range
disorder potential. We show that magnetoresistance becomes strong (of order 100
%) at relatively small fields, at which the inverse square of the magnetic
length becomes comparable to disorder-induced variations of the electron
density. The mechanism responsible for this anomalously strong
magnetoresistance can be traced to the appearance of magnetic friction force in
liquids with nonvanishing intrinsic conductivity. We derive general results for
the galvanomagnetic and thermomagnetic kinetic coefficients, and obtain their
dependence on the intrinsic dissipative properties of the electron liquid, and
the correlation function of the disorder potential. We apply this theory to
graphene close to charge neutrality and cover the crossover to a high-density
regime.

Nonintegrability plays a crucial role in thermalization and transport
processes in many-body Hamiltonian systems, yet its quantitative effects remain
unclear. To reveal the connection between the macroscopic relaxation properties
and the underlying dynamics, the one-dimensional diatomic hard-point model as
an illustrating example was studied analytically and numerically. We
demonstrate how the system transitions from kinetic behavior to hydrodynamic
behavior as the nonintegrability strength increases. Specifically, for the
thermalization dynamics, we find a power-law relationship between the
thermalization time and the perturbation strength near integrable regime,
whereas in the far from integrable regime, the hydrodynamics dominates and the
thermalization time becomes independent of the perturbation strength and
exhibits a strong size-dependent behavior. Regarding transport behavior, our
results further establish a threshold for the nonintegrable strength of this
transition. Consequently, we can predict which behavior dominates the transport
properties of the system. Especially, an explicit expression of the thermal
conductivity contributed by the kinetics is given. Finally, possible
applications were briefly discussed.

<h3>Nonequilibrium Probability Currents in Optically-Driven Colloidal  Suspensions</h3>

<br>
<br>
In the absence of directional motion it is often hard to recognize athermal
fluctuations. Probability currents provide such a measure in terms of the rate
at which they enclose area in phase space. We measure this area enclosing rate
for trapped colloidal particles, where only one particle is driven. By
combining experiment, theory, and simulation, we single out the effect of the
different time scales in the system on the measured probability currents. In
this controlled experimental setup, particles interact hydrodynamically. These
interactions lead to a strong spatial dependence of the probability currents
and to a local influence of athermal agitation. In a multiple-particle system,
we show that even when the driving acts only on one particle, probability
currents occur between other, non-driven particles. This may have significant
implications for the interpretation of fluctuations in biological systems
containing elastic networks in addition to a suspending fluid.

<h3>Fermi-Bose crossover using engineered disorder potential</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12194" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12194</a>
<br>
<i>Madhuparna Karmakar, Rajesh Narayanan</i>

We present the first instance of a disorder tuned Fermi-Bose crossover that
could be realized in superconducting systems. More specifically, harnessing a
non perturbative numerical technique we analyze the ground state behavior of a
two-dimensional attractive Hubbard model subjected to spin selective disorder
potential. In particular, using spectroscopic properties we provide unambiguous
evidence of the change in the Fermi surface topology as a function of the
disorder, establishing incontrovertibly a Fermi-Bose crossover. Interplay of
strong correlations and strong disorder brings out the spin selectivity in the
properties of this system giving rise to spin selective "Bose metal/insulator"
phase. We propose an experimental set-up where such disorder tuned Fermi-Bose
crossover could be observed in two-dimensional electron gas formed at oxide
interface. Finally, we speculate on the possible implication of such
spin-selective disorder on unraveling signatures of Bose-Fermi cross-over on
doped iron chalcogenide superconductors.

<h3>Dissipationless Nonlinearity in Quantum Material Josephson Diodes</h3>

Dissipationless nonlinearities for three-wave mixing are a key component of
many superconducting quantum devices, such as amplifiers and bosonic qubits. So
far, such third-order nonlinearities have been primarily achieved with circuits
of concatenated Josephson tunnel junctions. In this work, we theoretically
develop an alternative approach to realize third-order nonlinearities from
gate-tunable and intrinsically symmetry-broken quantum material Josephson
junctions. We illustrate this approach on two examples, an Andreev
interferometer and a magnetic Josephson junction. Our results show that both
setups enable Kerr-free three-wave mixing for a broad range of frequencies, an
attribute that is highly desirable for amplifier applications. Moreover, we
also find that the magnetic junction constitutes a paradigmatic example for
three-wave mixing in a minimal single-junction device without the need for any
external biases. We hope that our work will guide the search of dissipationless
nonlinearities in quantum material superconducting devices and inspire new ways
of characterizing symmetry-breaking in quantum materials with microwave
techniques.

<h3>Cold-atom quantum simulators of gauge theories</h3>

Gauge theories represent a fundamental framework underlying modern physics,
constituting the basis of the Standard Model and also providing useful
descriptions of various phenomena in condensed matter. Realizing gauge theories
on accessible and tunable tabletop quantum devices offers the possibility to
study their dynamics from first principles time evolution and to probe their
exotic physics, including that generated by deviations from gauge invariance,
which is not possible, e.g., in dedicated particle colliders. Not only do
cold-atom quantum simulators hold the potential to provide new insights into
outstanding high-energy and nuclear-physics questions, they also provide a
versatile tool for the exploration of topological phases and
ergodicity-breaking mechanisms relevant to low-energy many-body physics. In
recent years, cold-atom quantum simulators have demonstrated impressive
progress in the large-scale implementation of $1+1$D Abelian gauge theories. In
this Review, we chronicle the progress of cold-atom quantum simulators of gauge
theories, highlighting the crucial advancements achieved along the way in order
to reliably stabilize gauge invariance and go from building blocks to
large-scale realizations where \textit{bona fide} gauge-theory phenomena can be
probed. We also provide a brief outlook on where this field is heading, and
what is required experimentally and theoretically to bring the technology to
the next level by surveying various concrete proposals for advancing these
setups to higher spatial dimensions, higher-spin representations of the gauge
field, and non-Abelian gauge groups.

<h3>Helical trilayer graphene: a moiré platform for strongly-interacting  topological bands</h3>

Quantum geometry of electronic wavefunctions results in fascinating
topological phenomena. A prominent example is the intrinsic anomalous Hall
effect (AHE) in which a Hall voltage arises in the absence of an applied
magnetic field. The AHE requires a coexistence of Berry curvature and
spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. These conditions can be realized
in two-dimensional moir\'e systems with broken $xy$-inversion symmetry
($C_{2z}$) that host flat electronic bands. Here, we explore helical trilayer
graphene (HTG), three graphene layers twisted sequentially by the same angle
forming two misoriented moir\'e patterns. Although HTG is globally
$C_{2z}$-symmetric, surprisingly we observe clear signatures of topological
bands. At a magic angle $\theta_\mathrm{m}\approx 1.8^\circ$, we uncover a
robust phase diagram of correlated and magnetic states using magnetotransport
measurements. Lattice relaxation leads to large periodic domains in which
$C_{2z}$ is broken on the moir\'e scale. Each domain harbors flat topological
bands with valley-contrasting Chern numbers $\pm(1,-2)$. We find correlated
states at integer electron fillings per moir\'e unit cell $\nu=1,2,3$ and
fractional fillings $2/3,7/2$ with the AHE arising at $\nu=1,3$ and $2/3,7/2$.
At $\nu=1$, a time-reversal symmetric phase appears beyond a critical electric
displacement field, indicating a topological phase transition. Finally,
hysteresis upon sweeping $\nu$ points to first-order phase transitions across a
spatial mosaic of Chern domains separated by a network of topological gapless
edge states. We establish HTG as an important platform that realizes ideal
conditions for exploring strongly interacting topological phases and, due to
its emergent moir\'e-scale symmetries, demonstrates a novel way to engineer
topology.

<h3>Probing Confinement Through Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions: From  Quantum Spin Models to Lattice Gauge Theories</h3>

Confinement is an intriguing phenomenon prevalent in condensed matter and
high-energy physics. Exploring its effect on the far-from-equilibrium
criticality of quantum many-body systems is of great interest both from a
fundamental and technological point of view. Here, we employ large-scale
uniform matrix product state calculations to show that a qualitative change in
the type of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) accompanies the
confinement-deconfinement transition in three paradigmatic models -- the
power-law interacting quantum Ising chain, the two-dimensional quantum Ising
model, and the spin-$S$ $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link model. By tuning a
confining parameter in these models, it is found that \textit{branch}
(\textit{manifold}) DQPTs arise as a signature of (de)confinement. Whereas
manifold DQPTs are associated with a sign change of the order parameter, their
branch counterparts are not, but rather occur even when the order parameter
exhibits considerably constrained dynamics. Our conclusions can be tested in
modern quantum-simulation platforms, such as ion-trap setups and cold-atom
experiments of gauge theories.

<h3>Theory of moiré magnetism in twisted bilayer $α$-RuCl$_3$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Twisted heterostructures of van der Waals materials have received much
attention for their many remarkable properties. Here, we present a
comprehensive theory of the long-range ordered magnetic phases of twisted
bilayer $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ via a combination of first-principles calculations
and atomistic simulations. While a monolayer exhibits zigzag antiferromagnetic
order with three possible ordering wave vectors, a rich phase diagram is
obtained for moir\'e superlattices as a function of interlayer exchange and
twist angle. For large twist angles, each layer spontaneously picks a single
zigzag ordering wave vector, whereas, for small twist angles, the ground state
involves a combination of all three wave vectors in a complex hexagonal domain
structure. This multi-domain order minimizes the interlayer energy while
enduring the energy cost due to the domain wall formation. Our results indicate
that magnetic frustration due to stacking-dependent interlayer exchange in
moir\'e superlattices can be used to tune the magnetic ground state and enhance
quantum fluctuations in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.

<h3>Scale and conformal invariance in rotating few-fermion systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Viktor Bekassy, Johannes Hofmann</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that rotating two-dimensional Fermi gases possess a nonrelativistic
scale and conformal invariance at weak interactions, where the scale invariance
of universal short-range interactions is not broken by quantum effects. We
demonstrate the symmetry in the excitation spectrum of few-fermion ensembles in
a harmonic trap obtained by exact diagonalization, which are constrained by the
operator-state correspondence. The excitation spectrum is shown to split in a
set of primary states, the energies of which correspond to scaling dimensions
of conformal operators, and derived excited states that consist of breathing
modes as well as two different center-of-mass excitations, which describe
cyclotron and guiding-center excitations of the total particle cloud.
Furthermore, the conformal symmetry is manifest in the many-body wave function,
where it dictates the form of the hyperradial component, which we demonstrate
using Monte Carlo sampling of few-body wave functions.

<h3>Superfluid Stiffness and Josephson Quantum Capacitance: Adiabatic  Approach and Topological Effects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12223" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12223</a>
<br>
<i>Jun-Ang Wang, Mohamed Assili, Panagiotis Kotetes</i>
<br>
<br>
We bring forward a unified framework for the study of the superfluid
stiffness and the quantum capacitance of superconducting platforms exhibiting
conventional spin-singlet pairing. We focus on systems which in their normal
phase contain topological band touching points or crossings, while in their
superconducting regime feature a fully gapped energy spectrum. Our unified
description relies on viewing these two types of physical quantities as the
charge current and density response coefficients obtained for ``slow"
spatiotemporal variations of the superconducting phase. Within our adiabatic
formalism, the two coefficients are given in terms of Berry curvatures defined
in synthetic spaces. Our work lays the foundations for the systematic
description of topological diagonal superfluid responses induced by
singularities dictating the synthetic Berry curvatures. We exemplify our
approach for concrete one- and two-dimensional models of superconducting
topological (semi)metals. We discuss topological phenomena which arise in the
superfluid stiffness of bulk systems and the quantum capacitance of Josephson
junctions. We show that both coefficients become proportional to a topological
invariant which counts the number of topological touchings/crossings of the
normal phase band structure. These topological effects can be equivalently
viewed as manifestations of chiral anomaly. Our predictions are experimentally
testable in graphene-superconductor hybrids.

<h3>Mechanisms of scrambling and unscrambling of quantum information in the  ground state in spin chains: domain-walls, spin-flips and scattering phase  shifts</h3>

The spatiotemporal evolution of the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC)
measures the propagation and scrambling of local quantum information. For the
transverse field Ising model with open boundaries, the local operator
$\sigma^{x}$ shows an interesting picture of the ground state OTOC where the
local information gets scrambled throughout the entire system and, more
strikingly, starts `unscrambling' upon reflection at the other end. Earlier
discussions of OTOCs did not explain the physical processes responsible for
such scrambling and unscrambling of information. We explicitly show that in the
paramagnetic phase, the scrambling and unscrambling is due to the scattering of
a pair of low-energy spin-flip excitations, even in the presence of small
interactions. In the ferromagnetic phase the same phenomena are explained by
the motion of a domain-wall excitation. Thus, in different limits of the system
parameters, we have provided a simple and almost complete understanding of the
space-time pictures of the OTOCs, including the unscrambling, in terms of the
low-energy excitations like one and two spin-flips or a single domain wall.

Iron-based layered systems are of great interest because of their ability to
tune effective material parameters such as magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE).
The influence of the crystallographic structure of Fe, its thickness, and the
presence of other layers above and below the Fe layer on magnetic parameters,
such as the MAE of the studied system, is an intriguing and important topic
from an application point of view. Here, we present a density functional theory
(DFT) study of the magnetic anisotropy of nine-monolayer Fe, FeCo, and FeCo
films with B, C, and N dopants placed in octahedral interstitial positions. The
theoretical study is based on calculations using the full-potential
local-orbital code FPLO and the generalized gradient approximation. The
chemical disorder in the FeCo layers was modeled using the virtual crystal
approximation. The structures of the layers were subjected to optimization of
the geometry of the interlayer spacings and the neighborhood of the dopant
sites. We determined the local magnetic moments and the excess charge at each
layer position. We also identified the influence of dopant atoms on the
magnetic properties of FeCo layers, such as magnetization and magnetic
anisotropy.

<h3>Superconductivity in the Two-Orbital Hubbard Model of Infinite-Layer  Nickelates</h3>

The pairing symmetry in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors has been an
intriguing problem under heated debates. In this work, we study a two-orbital
Hubbard model with one strongly correlated $3d$ orbital and one more itinerant
$5d$ orbital, by using an eight-site cellular dynamic mean field theory study.
We establish a superconducting phase diagram with $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$, $s_{\pm}$
and $d+is$ wave pairing symmetries, based on which we clarify the roles of
various relevant parameters including hybridization $V$, itinerant carrier
density $\langle n_{c}\rangle$ and interaction $U_{c}$. We show that the
inclusion of a less correlated $5d$ band in general suppresses the
$d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ wave pairing. We demonstrate that the $d+is$ wave is
maximized when the $5d$ orbital has a large Coulomb repulsion with intermediate
hybridization parameter. We perform fluctuation diagnostics to show that the
driving force behind the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ wave is the intraband
antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the $3d$ orbital, while for the $s_{\pm}$
wave, the pairing is mainly from the antiferromagnetic correlations residing on
the local $3d$-$5d$ bond in real space.

In this article, we study conditions of continuous emergent symmetries in
gapless states, either as topological quantum critical points (TQCPs) or a
stable phase with protecting symmetries and connections to smooth deformations
of the gapped states around. We illustrate that for a wide class of gapless
states that can be associated with fully-isolated scale invariant fixed points,
there shall always be emergent continuous symmetries that are directly related
to smooth deformations of gapped states with symmetries lower than the
protecting ones $G_p$. For a 3D TQCP in DIII classes with $G_p=Z^T_2$,
$U_{EM}=U(1)$ and $N_f=\frac{1}{2}$ fermions but without charge $U(1)$
symmetry, we explicitly construct a corresponding boundary representation based
on a $4D$ topological state with lattice symmetry $H=Z^T_2 \ltimes U(1)$ and
$N_f={1}$ fermions. Although emergent continuous symmetries appear to be robust
at weakly interacting TQCPs, we further show the breakdown of such one-to-one
correspondence between deformations of gapped states and emergent continuous
symmetries when gapless states become strongly interacting. In a strongly
interacting limit, gapless states can be represented by a smooth manifold of
conformal-field-theory fixed points rather than a fully isolated one. A smooth
manifold of strong coupling fixed points hinders emergence of a continuous
emergent symmetry in the strongly interacting gapless limit, as deformations no
longer leave a gapless state or a TQCP invariant, unlike in the more
conventional weakly interacting case. This typically reduces continuous
emergent symmetries to a discrete symmetry originating from duality
transformations under the protection symmetry $G_p$.

The enigmatic mechanism underlying unconventional high-temperature
superconductivity, especially the role of lattice dynamics, has remained a
subject of debate. Theoretical insights have long been hindered due to the lack
of an accurate first-principles description of the lattice dynamics of
cuprates. Recently, using the r2SCAN meta-GGA functional, we were able to
achieve accurate phonon spectra of an insulating cuprate YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_6$,
and discover significant magnetoelastic coupling in experimentally interesting
Cu-O bond stretching optical modes [Phys. Rev. B 107, 045126 (2023)]. We extend
this work by comparing PBE and r2SCAN performances with corrections from the
on-site Hubbard U and the D4 van der Waals (vdW) methods, aiming at further
understanding on both the materials science side and the density functional
side. We demonstrate the importance of vdW and self-interaction corrections for
accurate first-principles YBa2 Cu3 O6 lattice dynamics. Since r2SCAN by itself
partially accounts for these effects, the good performance of r2SCAN is now
more fully explained. In addition, the performances of the Tao-Mo series of
meta-GGAs, which are constructed in a different way from SCAN/r2SCAN, are also
compared and discussed.

Analytical expressions for radial distribution function (RDF) are of critical
importance for various applications, such as development of the perturbation
theories for equilibrium properties. Theoretically, RDF expressions for
odd-dimensional fluids can be obtained by solving the Percus-Yevick integral
equations. But for even-dimensional cases, such as the hard disk (2D) fluid,
analytical expressions are infeasible. The only 2D RDF is a heuristic
expression proposed by Yuste et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 99, 2020,1993), which
approximates the 2D RDF with an interpolation of the RDFs for hard-rod (1D) and
hard-sphere (3D) fluids and provides acceptable estimations for an intermediate
and low density range. In this work, we employ a simple and empirical
expression for the 2D RDF and the 3D RDF based on the approach proposed by
Trokhymchuk et al. for the 3D RDF (J. Chem. Phys., 123, 024501, 2005). The
parameters are determined in such a way that the final RDF expressions are
thermodynamically consistent, namely the pressure constraint and the isothermal
compressibility constraint are both satisfied. The new RDFs for the 2D and 3D
hard spheres are highly accurate for the entire density range up to the
first-order phase transition points. The predictions of the first coordination
numbers are consistent with simulation results for 3D fluid. Finally, by using
the 2D RDF with a primitive second-order perturbation theory, the
pressure-volume-temperature relation and vapor-liquid equilibrium are
calculated for the 2D Lennard-Jones fluid. Comparisons with the simulation data
show promising results.

<h3>Twisted bilayer graphene revisited: minimal two-band model for  low-energy bands</h3>

An accurate description of the low-energy electronic bands in twisted bilayer
graphene (tBLG) is of great interest due to their relation to correlated
electron phases, such as superconductivity and Mott-insulator behavior at
half-filling. The paradigmatic model of Bistritzer and MacDonald [PNAS 108,
12233 (2011)], based on the moir\'e pattern formed by tBLG, predicts the
existence of "magic angles" at which the Fermi velocity of the low-energy bands
goes to zero, and the bands themselves become dispersionless. Here, we
reexamine the low-energy bands of tBLG from the ab initio electronic structure
perspective, motivated by features related to the atomic relaxation in the
moir\'e pattern, namely circular regions of AA stacking, triangular regions of
AB/BA stacking and domain walls separating the latter. We find that the bands
are never perfectly flat and the Fermi velocity never vanishes, but rather a
"magic range" exists where the lower band becomes extremely flat and the Fermi
velocity attains a non-zero minimum value. We propose a simple $(2+2)$-band
model, comprised of two different pairs of orbitals, both on a honeycomb
lattice: the first pair represents the low-energy bands with high localization
at the AA sites, while the second pair represents highly dispersive bands
associated with domain-wall states. This model gives an accurate description of
the low-energy bands with few (13) parameters which are physically motivated
and vary smoothly in the magic range. In addition, we derive an effective
two-band hamiltonian which also gives an accurate description of the low-energy
bands. This minimal two-band model affords a connection to a Hubbard-like
description of the occupancy of sub-bands and can be used a basis for exploring
correlated states.

<h3>Giant Spin Transport Anisotropy in Magnetic Topological Insulators</h3>

We report on exceptionally long spin transport and giant spin lifetime
anisotropy in the gapped surface states of three-dimensional (3D) magnetic
topological insulators (MTIs). We examine the properties of these states using
the Fu-Kane-Mele Hamiltonian in presence of a magnetic exchange field. The
corresponding spin textures of surface states, which are well reproduced by an
effective two-band model, hint at a considerable enhancement of the lifetime of
out-of-plane spins compared to in-plane spins. This is confirmed by large-scale
spin transport simulations for 3D MTIs with disorder. The energy dependence of
the spin lifetime anisotropy arises directly from the nontrivial spin texture
of the surface states, and is correlated with the onset of the quantum
anomalous Hall phase. Our findings suggest novel spin filtering capabilities of
the gapped surface MTI states, which could be explored by Hanle spin precession
measurements.

<h3>Field theory for mechanical criticality in disordered fiber networks</h3>

Strain-controlled criticality governs the elasticity of jamming and fiber
networks. While the upper critical dimension of jamming is believed to be
$d_u$=2, non mean-field exponents are observed in numerical studies of 2D and
3D fiber networks. The origins of this remains unclear. In this study we
propose a minimal mean-field model for strain-controlled criticality of fiber
networks. We then extend this to a phenomenological field theory, in which non
mean-field behavior emerges as a result of the disorder in the network
structure. We predict that the upper critical dimension for such systems is
$d_u$=4 using a Gaussian approximation. Moreover, we identify an order
parameter for the phase transition, which has been lacking for fiber networks
to date.

We investigate quench dynamics of spin ice after removal of a strong magnetic
field along the [100] crystal direction, using Monte Carlo simulations and
theoretical arguments. We show how the early-time relaxation of the
magnetization can be understood in terms of nucleation and growth of strings of
flipped spins, in agreement with an effective stochastic model that we
introduce and solve analytically. We demonstrate a crossover at longer times to
a regime dominated by approximately isotropic clusters, which we characterize
in terms of their morphology, and present evidence for a percolation transition
as a function of magnetization.

<h3>Correlation between the strength of low-temperature T-linear  normal-state resistivity and $T_{\rm c}$ in overdoped electron-doped cuprate  superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12414" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12414</a>

<br>
<br>
The recently observed an intimate link between the nature of the strange
metallic normal-state and superconductivity in the overdoped electron-doped
cuprate superconductors is calling for an explanation. Here the intrinsic
correlation between the strength of the low-temperature linear-in-temperature
normal-state resistivity and superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$
in the overdoped electron-doped cuprate superconductors is studied within the
framework of the kinetic-energy-driven superconductivity. On the one hand, the
main ingredient is identified into a electron pairing mechanism involving {\it
the spin excitation}, and then $T_{\rm c}$ has a dome-like shape doping
dependence with the maximal $T_{\rm c}$ that occurs at around the optimal
electron doping. On the other hand, in the normal-state above $T_{\rm c}$, the
low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state resistivity in the overdoped
regime arises from the momentum relaxation due to the electron umklapp
scattering mediated by {\it the same spin excitation}. This {\it same spin
excitation} that governs both the electron umklapp scattering responsible for
the low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state resistivity and electron
pairing responsible for superconductivity naturally generates a correlation
between the strength of the low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state
resistivity and $T_{\rm c}$ in the overdoped regime.

<br>
<br>
Previous work on additively-manufactured oxide dispersion strengthened alloys
focused on experimental approaches, resulting in larger dispersoid sizes and
lower number densities than can be achieved with conventional powder
metallurgy. To improve the as-fabricated microstructure, this work integrates
experiments with a thermodynamic and kinetic modeling framework to probe the
limits of the dispersoid sizes and number densities that can be achieved with
powder bed fusion-laser beam. Bulk samples of a Ni-20Cr $+$ 1 wt.\% Y$_2$O$_3$
alloy are fabricated using a range of laser power and scanning velocity
combinations. Scanning transmission electron microscopy characterization is
performed to quantify the dispersoid size distributions across the processing
space. The smallest mean dispersoid diameter (29 nm) is observed at 300 W and
1200 mm/s, with a number density of 1.0$\times$10$^{20}$ m$^{-3}$. The largest
mean diameter (72 nm) is observed at 200 W and 200 mm/s, with a number density
of 1.5$\times$10$^{19}$ m$^{-3}$. Scanning electron microscopy suggests that a
considerable fraction of the oxide added to the feedstock is lost during
processing, due to oxide agglomeration and the ejection of oxide-rich spatter
from the melt pool. After accounting for these losses, the model predictions
for the dispersoid diameter and number density align with the experimental
trends. The results suggest that rapid coarsening of dispersoids in the melt
pool limits the final number density to less than 10$^{21}$ m$^{-3}$, which is
more than 100 times lower than that achievable with powder metallurgy. The
modeling framework is leveraged to propose processing strategies to limit
dispersoid size and increase number density.

<h3>Critical Diagnosis of Electronic Dimensionality Reduction in  Semiconductor Quantum Well Structures</h3>

Two-dimensional (2D) systems, such as high-temperature superconductors,
surface states of topological insulators, and layered materials, have been
intensively studied using vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES). In semiconductor films (heterostructures), quantum well
(QW) states arise due to electron/hole accumulations at the surface
(interface). The quantized states due to quantum confinement can be observed by
VUV-ARPES, while the periodic intensity modulations along the surface normal
(kz) direction of these quantized states are also observable by varying
incident photon energy, resembling three-dimensional (3D) band dispersion. We
have conducted soft X-ray (SX) ARPES measurements on thick and ultrathin III-V
semiconductor InSb(001) films to investigate the electronic dimensionality
reduction in semiconductor QWs. In addition to the dissipation of the kz
dispersion, the SX-ARPES observations demonstrate the changes of the symmetry
and periodicity of the Brillouin zone in the ultrathin film as 2D QW compared
with these of the 3D bulk one, indicating the electronic dimensionality
reduction of the 3D bulk band dispersion caused by the quantum confinement. The
results provide a critical diagnosis using SX-ARPES for the dimensionality
reduction in semiconductor QW structures.

<h3>Detailed and high-throughput measurement of composition dependence of  magnetoresistance and spin-transfer torque using a composition-gradient film:  application to Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$ (0 $\le$ $\textit{x}$ $\le$ 1) system</h3>

We develop a high-throughput method for measuring the composition dependence
of magnetoresistance (MR) and spin-transfer-torque (STT) effects in
current-perpendicular-to-plane giant magnetoresistance (CPP-GMR) devices and
report its application to the CoFe system. The method is based on the use of
composition-gradient films deposited by combinatorial sputtering. This
structure allows the fabrication of devices with different compositions on a
single substrate, drastically enhancing the throughput in investigating
composition dependence. We fabricated CPP-GMR devices on a single GMR film
consisting of a Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$ (0 $\le$ $\textit{x}$ $\le$ 1)
composition-gradient layer, a Cu spacer layer, and a NiFe layer. The MR ratio
obtained from resistance-field measurements exhibited the maximum in the broad
Co concentration range of 0.3 $\le$ $\textit{x}$ $\le$ 0.65. In addition, the
STT efficiency was estimated from the current to induce magnetization reversal
of the NiFe layer by spin injection from the Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$ layer. The STT
efficiency was also the highest around the same Co concentration range as for
the MR ratio, and this correlation was theoretically explained by the change in
the spin polarization of the Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$ layer. The results revealed the
Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$ composition range suitable for spintronic applications,
demonstrating the advantages of the developed method.

<h3>A Machine Learning Approach to Robustly Determine Orientation Fields and  Analyze Defects in Active Nematics</h3>

<br>
<br>
Active nematics are dense systems of rodlike particles that consume energy to
drive motion at the level of the individual particles. They are found in a
variety of natural systems, such as biological tissues, and artificial
materials such as suspensions of self-propelled colloidal particles or
synthetic microswimmers. Active nematics have attracted significant attention
in recent years because of their spectacular nonequilibrium collective
spatiotemporal dynamics, which may enable applications in fields such as
robotics, drug delivery, and materials science. The orientation field, which
measures the direction and degree of alignment of the local nematic director,
is a crucial characteristic of an active nematic and is essential for detecting
and studying topological defects. However, determining the orientation field is
a significant challenge in many experimental systems. Although orientation
fields can be derived from images of active nematics using traditional imaging
processing methods, the results and accuracy of such methods are highly
sensitive to the settings of the algorithm. These settings must be tuned from
image-to-image due to experimental noise, intrinsic noise of the imaging
technology, and perturbations caused by changes in experimental conditions.
This sensitivity currently limits the automatic analysis of active nematics. To
overcome this limitation, we have developed a machine learning model for
extracting reliable orientation fields from raw experimental images, which
enables accurate automatic analysis of topological defects. Application of the
algorithm to experimental data demonstrates that the approach is robust and
highly generalizable to experimental settings that were unseen in the training
data. These results suggest that it will be a useful tool for investigating
active nematics, and the approach may be generalized to other active matter
systems.

<h3>Entropy and de Haas-van Alphen oscillations of a three-dimensional  marginal Fermi liquid</h3>

<br>
<i>P. A. Nosov, Yi-Ming Wu, S. Raghu</i>
<br>
<br>
We study de Haas-van Alphen oscillations in a marginal Fermi liquid resulting
from a three-dimensional metal tuned to a quantum-critical point (QCP). We show
that the conventional approach based on extensions of the Lifshitz-Kosevich
formula for the oscillation amplitudes becomes inapplicable when the
correlation length exceeds the cyclotron radius. This breakdown is due to (i)
non-analytic finite-temperature contributions to the fermion self-energy (ii)
an enhancement of the oscillatory part of the self-energy by quantum
fluctuations, and (iii) non-trivial dynamical scaling laws associated with the
quantum critical point. We properly incorporate these effects within the
Luttinger-Ward-Eliashberg framework for the thermodynamic potential by treating
the fermionic and bosonic contributions on equal footing. As a result, we
obtain the modified expressions for the oscillations of entropy and
magnetization that remain valid in the non-Fermi liquid regime.

<h3>Atomic-scale investigation of gamma-Ga2O3 deposited on MgAl2O4 and its  relationship with beta-Ga2O3</h3>

<br>
<br>
Nominally phase-pure gamma-Ga2O3 was deposited on (100) MgAl2O4 within a
narrow temperature window centered at ~470 degress using metal-organic chemical
vapor deposition (MOCVD). The film deposited at 440 degrees exhibited either
poor crystallization or an amorphous structure; the film grown at 500 degress
contained both beta-Ga2O3 and gamma-Ga2O3. A nominally phase-pure beta-Ga2O3
film was obtained at 530 degrees. Atomic-resolution scanning transmission
electron microscopy (STEM) investigations of the gamma-Ga2O3 film grown at 470
degrees revealed a high density of antiphase boundaries. A planar defect model
developed for gamma-Al2O3 was extended to explain the stacking sequences of the
Ga sublattice observed in the STEM images of gamma-Ga2O3. The presence of the
180-degree rotational domains and 90-degree rotational domains of beta-Ga2O3
inclusions within the gamma-Ga2O3 matrix is discussed within the context of a
comprehensive investigation of the epitaxial relationship between those two
phases in the as-grown film at 470 degrees and the same film annealed at 600
degress. The results led to the hypotheses that (i) incorporation of certain
dopants including Si, Ge, Sn, Mg, Al, and Sc, into beta-Ga2O3, locally
stabilizes the "gamma-phase" and (ii) the site preference(s) for these dopants
promotes the formation of the "gamma-phase" and/or gamma-Ga2O3 solid solutions.
However, in the absence of such dopants, pure gamma-Ga2O3 remains the least
stable Ga2O3 polymorph, as indicated by its very narrow growth window, lower
growth temperatures relative to other Ga2O3 polymorphs, and the largest
calculated difference in Helmholtz free energy per formula unit between
gamma-Ga2O3 and beta-Ga2O3 than all other polymorphs.

The empirical and particle force-based models of granular segregation due to
density differences among the species are compared in this work. Dependency of
the empirical segregation parameters on the initial configuration, the
observation time duration, inclination angle, and mixture composition are
discussed in detail. The parameters obtained from empirical models are used to
predict the steady-state concentration profiles for different density ratios
and compositions. In addition, we utilize the predictions from the particle
force-based segregation model and compare them with the predictions of the
empirical segregation models. Our results show that the linear empirical
segregation model predictions agree well with the simulation results for
mixtures rich in light species where as quadratic empirical segregation model
works better for mixtures rich in heavy species. Particle force-based
segregation model, on the other hand, seems to be in very good agreement with
the DEM simulation data across all mixture compositions.

The influence of attractive boron impurities, embedded on a graphene sheet,
on the phase diagrams of $^4$He and H$_2$ adsorbed on top was studied using the
diffusion Monte Carlo method. The doping of graphene was made by distributing
the boron atoms following the same pattern found in an experimentally
synthesized substrate. Our results show that while the different incommensurate
solid phases of both adsorbates remain largely unchanged after doping, the
liquid/gas equations of state are significanty different from the ones on
pristine graphene. Doping graphene produces new translationally invariant
stable phases for $^4$He, depending on the concentration of boron impurities,
but makes the H$_2$ ground state to remain solid. In addition, several new
registered phases appear for both adsorbates.

Single-molecule tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) under ultra-high
vacuum (UHV) and cryogenic conditions enables exploration of the relations
between the adsorption geometry, electronic state, and vibrational fingerprints
of individual molecules. TERS capability of reflecting spin states in
open-shell molecular configurations is yet unexplored. Here we use the tip of a
scanning probe microscope to lift a perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic
dianhydride (PTCDA) molecule from a metal surface to bring it into an
open-shell spin one-half anionic state. We reveal a correlation between the
appearance of a Kondo resonance in the differential conductance spectroscopy
and concurrent characteristic changes captured by the TERS measurements.
Through a detailed investigation of various adsorbed and tip-contacted PTCDA
scenarios, we infer that the Raman scattering on the suspended PTCDA is
resonant with a higher excited state. Theoretical simulation of the vibrational
spectra enables a precise assignment of the individual TERS peaks to
high-symmetry Ag modes, including the fingerprints of the observed spin state.
These findings highlight the potential of TERS in capturing complex
interactions between charge, spin, and photophysical properties in nanoscale
molecular systems, and suggest a pathway for designing spin-optical devices
using organic molecules.

Complex oxide thin films and heterostructures offer a wide range of
properties originating from the intrinsic coupling between lattice strain and
magnetic/electronic ordering. This article reviews experimental,
phenomenological, and theoretical analyses of the coupling of strain with
electronic and magnetic properties of mixed valence manganite heterostructures.
The influence of epitaxial strain on the magnetic properties of manganite films
is measured using macroscopic magnetization measurements and shown mixed
reports suggesting, both, an increase and decrease in ferromagnetic phases on
the application of the strain. Using polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR), a
simultaneous measurement of transport and magnetic properties of manganite thin
films showed direct evidence of modification in the magnetic properties on the
application of bending strain. The coupling coefficient of strain and magnetism
of manganite heterostructures was estimated using PNR, which not only helped to
understand the correlation of elastic strain with magnetism but also explained
the condition of magnetic phase order change in the phase-separated systems
within a phenomenological Ginzburg Landau theory. An overview is also provided
of the current perspectives and existing studies on the influence of strain on
structure, electronic, magnetic, magnetic anisotropy, phase coexistence and
magnetocaloric properties of mixed valence manganite heterostructures. Based on
the understanding of a diverse range of perovskite functionalities, detailed
perspectives on how the coupling of strain and magnetism open up pathways
toward the emergence of novel device design features including the different
ways of applying uniform strain, are discussed.

Although topological phenomena attract growing interest not only in linear
systems but also in nonlinear systems, the bulk-edge correspondence under the
nonlinearity of eigenvalues has not been established so far. We address this
issue by introducing auxiliary eigenvalues. We reveal that the topological edge
states of auxiliary eigenstates are topologically inherited as physical edge
states when the nonlinearity is weak but finite (i.e., auxiliary eigenvalues
are monotonic as for the physical one). This result leads to the bulk-edge
correspondence with the nonlinearity of eigenvalues.

The accurate description of the structural and thermodynamic properties of
ferroelectrics has been one of the most remarkable achievements of Density
Functional Theory (DFT). However, running large simulation cells with DFT is
computationally demanding, while simulations of small cells are often plagued
with non-physical effects that are a consequence of the system's finite size.
Therefore, one is often forced to use empirical models that describe the
physics of the material in terms of effective interaction terms, that are
fitted using the results from DFT, to perform simulations that do not suffer
from finite size effects. In this study we use a machine-learning (ML)
potential trained on DFT, in combination with accelerated sampling techniques,
to converge the thermodynamic properties of Barium Titanate (BTO) with
first-principles accuracy and a full atomistic description. Our results
indicate that the predicted Curie temperature depends strongly on the choice of
DFT functional and system size, due to the presence of emergent long-range
directional correlations in the local dipole fluctuations. Our findings
demonstrate how the combination of ML models and traditional bottom-up modeling
allow one to investigate emergent phenomena with the accuracy of
first-principles calculations and the large size and time scales afforded by
empirical models.

The intensive development of technology for fabrication semiconducting CVD
diamond layers poses an important task of developing a precise and
non-destructive method for estimation the boron content in thin epitaxial
layers. For bulk and uniformly doped diamond samples, the infrared optical
spectroscopy successfully performs such a role. Here we propose a correct
method to determine the boron concentration in CVD homoepitaxial diamond layers
from FTIR spectra. The method is the natural advancement of the existing
technique for bulk samples. The feature of the novel technique is the accurate
accounting of passing radiation through a multilayered structure with different
thicknesses of absorbing media for special absorbing mechanisms. For this
situation, an expression for the effective optical density is obtained. We have
demonstrated the benefit of the method for a set of samples with CVD
homoepitaxial layers grown on various HPHT substrates with and without nitrogen
impurity. The measured FTIR spectra were subdivided into relevant sections
responsible for the specific absorption mechanisms, and the correct amplitudes
of the boron absorption peaks were derived. The data obtained from FTIR spectra
is thoroughly compared to the charge carrier concentration derived from
electrical capacitance-voltage measurements.

Recent observations of jerky flow in high-entropy alloys (HEA) revealed a
high role of self-organization of dislocations in their plasticity. The present
work reports first results of investigation of stress fluctuations during
plastic deformation of a FeCoNiTiAl alloy, examined in a wide temperature range
covering both smooth and jerky flow. These fluctuations, which accompany the
overall deformation behavior representing an essentially slower stress
evolution controlled by the work hardening, were processed using complementary
approaches comprising the Fourier spectral analysis, the refined composite
multiscale entropy, and multifractal formalisms. The joint analysis at distinct
scales testified that even a macroscopically smooth plastic flow is accompanied
with nonrandom fluctuations, disclosing self-organized dynamics of
dislocations. Qualitative changes in such a fine-scale "noise" were found with
varying temperature. The observed diversity is significant for understanding
the relationships between different scales of plasticity of HEAs and crystal
materials in general.

The Bethe lattice Ising model -- a classical model of statistical mechanics

formulating a holographic renormalization group for the Bethe lattice model, we
demonstrate the underlying mechanism and the exact scaling dimensions for the
power-law decay of boundary spin correlations by introducing the relation
between the lattice network and an effective Poincare metric on a unit disk. We
compare the Bethe lattice model in the high-temperature region with a scalar
field in AdS$_2$, and then discuss its more direct connection to the p-adic
AdS/CFT. In addition, we find that the phase transition in the interior induces
a crossover behavior of boundary spin correlations, depending on the depth of
the corresponding correlation path.

Engineered spin-electric coupling enables spin qubits in semiconductor
nanostructures to be manipulated efficiently and addressed individually. While
synthetic spin-orbit coupling using a micromagnet is widely used for driving
qubits based on single spins in silicon, corresponding demonstration for
encoded spin qubits is so far limited to natural silicon. Here, we demonstrate
fast singlet-triplet qubit oscillation (~100 MHz) in a gate-defined double
quantum dot in $^{28}$Si/SiGe with an on-chip micromagnet with which we show
the oscillation quality factor of an encoded spin qubit exceeding 580. The
coherence time $\textit{T}_{2}$* is analyzed as a function of potential
detuning and an external magnetic field. In weak magnetic fields, the coherence
is limited by fast noise compared to the data acquisition time, which limits
$\textit{T}_{2}$* < 1 ${\mu}$s in the ergodic limit. We present evidence of
sizable and coherent coupling of the qubit with the spin states of a nearby
quantum dot, demonstrating that appropriate spin-electric coupling may enable a
charge-based two-qubit gate in a (1,1) charge configuration.

<br>
<br>
We present a non-reactive force field for molecular dynamics simulations of
interfaces between passivated amorphous surfaces and their interaction with
water. The force field enables large-scale dynamic simulations of dry and
lubricated tribological contacts and is tailored to surfaces with hydrogen,
hydroxyl and aromatic surface passivation. To favour its compatibility with
existing force-field parameterizations for liquids and allow a straightforward
extension to other types of surface passivation species, we adopt the commonly
used OPLS functional form. The optimisation of the force-field parameters is
systematic and follows a protocol that can be reused for other surface-molecule
combinations. Reference data are calculated with gradient- and
dispersion-corrected density functional theory and include the bonding
structure and elastic deformation of bulk and surface structures as well as
surface adhesion and water adsorption energy landscapes. The conventions
adopted to define the different force-field atom types are based on the
hybridisation of carbon orbitals and enable a simple and efficient parameter
optimisation strategy based on quantum-mechanical calculations performed only
on crystalline reference structures. Transferability tests on amorphous
interfaces demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. After testing the
force field, we present two examples of application to tribological problems.
Namely, we investigate relationships between dry friction and the corrugation
of the contact potential energy surface and the dependency of friction on the
thickness of interface water films. We finally discuss the limitations of the
force field and propose strategies for its improvement and extension.

We propose inverse renormalization group transformations to construct
approximate configurations for lattice volumes that have not yet been accessed
by supercomputers or large-scale simulations in the study of spin glasses.
Specifically, starting from lattices of volume $V=8^{3}$ in the case of the
three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model we employ machine learning algorithms
to construct rescaled lattices up to $V'=128^{3}$, which we utilize to extract
two critical exponents. We conclude by discussing how to incorporate numerical
exactness within inverse renormalization group approaches of disordered
systems, thus opening up the opportunity to explore a sustainable and
energy-efficient generation of exact configurations for increasing lattice
volumes without the use of dedicated supercomputers.

Composite topological phases with intriguing topology like M${\"o}$bius
strips emerge in sublattice symmetric non-Hermitian systems due to spontaneous
breaking of time-reversal symmetry at some parameter regime. While these phases
have been characterized by nonadiabatic complex geometric phases of multiple
participating complex bands, the physical properties of these phases largely
remain unknown. We explore the dynamical response of these phases by studying
Loschmidt echo from an initial state of the Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
(SSH) model, which is evolved by a non-Hermitian SSH Hamiltonian after a sudden
quench in parameters. Topology-changing quenches display non-analytical
temporal behavior of return rates (logarithm of the Loschmidt echo) for the
non-Hermitian SSH Hamiltonian in the trivial, M${\"o}$bius and topological
phase. Moreover, the dynamical topological order parameter appears only at one
side of the Brillouin zone for the M${\"o}$bius phase case in contrast to both
sides of the Brillouin zone for quench by the trivial and topological phase of
the non-Hermitian SSH model. The last feature is a dynamical signature of
different symmetry constraints on the real and imaginary parts of the complex
bands in the M${\"o}$bius phase.

Fast, reversible, and low-power manipulation of the spin texture is crucial
for next generation spintronic devices like non-volatile bipolar memories,
switchable spin current injectors or spin field effect transistors.
Ferroelectric Rashba semiconductors (FERSC) are the ideal class of materials
for the realization of such devices. Their ferroelectric character enables an
electronic control of the Rashba-type spin texture by means of the reversible
and switchable polarization. Yet, only very few materials have been established
to belong to this class of multifunctional materials. Here, Pb1-xGexTe is
unraveled as a novel FERSC system down to nanoscale. The ferroelectric phase
transition and concomitant lattice distortion is demonstrated by temperature
dependent X-ray diffraction, and its effect on electronic properties are
measured by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. In few nanometer-thick
epitaxial heterostructures, a large Rashba spin-splitting is exhibiting a wide
tuning range as a function of temperature and Ge content. Our work defines Pb1-
xGexTe as a high-potential FERSC system for spintronic applications.

<h3>Correlation Driven Magnetic Frustration and Insulating Behavior of  TiF$_3$</h3>

We investigate the halide perovskite TiF$_3$, renowned for its intricate
interplay between structure, electronic correlations, magnetism, and thermal
expansion. Despite its simple structure, understanding its low-temperature
magnetic behavior has been a challenge. Previous theories proposed
antiferromagnetic ordering. In contrast, experimental signatures for an ordered
magnetic state are absent down to 10~K. Our current study has successfully
reevaluated the theoretical modeling of TiF$_3$, unveiling the significance of
strong electronic correlations as the key driver for its insulating behavior
and magnetic frustration. In addition, our frequency-dependent optical
reflectivity measurements exhibit clear signs of an insulating state. Analysis
of the calculated magnetic data gives an antiferromagnetic exchange coupling
with a net Weiss temperature of order 25~K as well as a magnetic response
consistent with a $S$=1/2 local moment per Ti$^{3+}$. Yet, the system shows no
susceptibility peak at this temperature scale and appears free of long-range
antiferromagnetic order down to 1~K. Extending ab initio modeling of the
material to larger unit cells shows a tendency for relaxing into a
non-collinear magnetic ordering, with a shallow energy landscape between
several magnetic ground states, promoting the status of this simple, nearly
cubic perovskite structured material as a candidate spin liquid.

<br>
Many-body interactions (MBIs) such as exciton-exciton interactions
significantly affect the optical response of semiconductor nanostructures.
These interactions can be rigorously modeled through microscopic calculations.
However, these calculations can be computationally intensive and often lack
physical insights. An alternative is to use phenomenological many-body
interaction models such as the modified optical Bloch equations (MOBEs) and the
anharmonic oscillator (AO) model. While both these models have separately been
used to interpret experimental data, to the best of our knowledge, an explicit
and direct correspondence between these models has not been established. Here,
we show the empirical equivalence between these two complimentary MBI models
through two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy simulations. A quantitative
correspondence between the MBI parameters used in the two models are obtained.
We also perform a quantitative comparison of these MBI models with experiments,
which highlights the usefulness of these phenomenological models in
interpreting experimental results.

<br>
Epitaxial thin films of SrTiO$_3$(100) doped with 6% and 12% Ni are studied
with resonant angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) at the Ti and
Ni L2,3-edges. We find that the Ni doping shifts the valence band (VB) of
pristine SrTiO$_3$ towards the Fermi level (p-doping) and reduces its band gap.
This is accompanied by an upward energy shift of the Ti t2g-derived mobile
electron system (MES). Thereby, the in-plane dxy-derived bands reduce the
embedded electron density, as evidenced by progressive reduction of their Fermi
momentum with the Ni concentration, and the out-of-plane dxz/yz-derived bands
depopulate, making the MES purely two-dimensional. Furthermore, the Ti and Ni
L2,3-edge resonant photoemission is used to identify the Ni 3d impurity state
in the vicinity of the valence-band maximum, and decipher the full spectrum of
the VO-induced in-gap states originating from the Ni atoms, Ti atoms, and from
their hybridized orbitals. Our experimental information about the dependence of
the valence bands, MES and in-gap states in Ni-doped SrTiO$_3$ may help
development of this material towards its device applications associated with
the reduced optical band gap.

<h3>Emergent Properties of the Periodic Anderson Model: a High-Resolution,  Real-Frequency Study of Heavy-Fermion Quantum Criticality</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12672" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12672</a>
<br>
<i>Andreas Gleis, Seung-Sup B. Lee, Gabriel Kotliar, Jan von Delft</i>
<br>
<br>
We study paramagnetic quantum criticality in the periodic Anderson model
(PAM) using cellular dynamical mean-field theory, with the numerical
renormalization group (NRG) as an impurity solver. The PAM describes an
itinerant $c$ band hybridizing with a localized $f$ band. At $T=0$, it exhibits
a hybridization tuned Kondo breakdown quantum critical point (KB-QCP) from a
Kondo to an RKKY phase. At the KB-QCP, the $f$ band changes character from
itinerant to mainly localized, while the $c$ band remains itinerant. We
elucidate its nature in detail by performing a high-resolution, real-frequency
study of dynamical quantities. NRG allows us to study the quantum critical
non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) regime located between $T_{FL}<T_{NFL}$. Surprisingly,
self-consistency is essential to stabilize the NFL and the QCP. The
Fermi-liquid (FL) scale $T_{FL}$ decreases towards and vanishes at the QCP. At
$T=0$, we find the following properties. The $f$ quasiparticle (QP) weight
$Z_f$ decreases continuously as the QCP is approached from either side,
vanishing only at the QCP. Therefore, $Z_f$ is nonzero in both the Kondo and
the RKKY phase; hence, the FL QP comprise $c$ and $f$ electrons in both phases.
The Fermi surface (FS) volumes in the two phases differ. Whereas the large-FS
Kondo phase has a usual two-band structure, the small-FS RKKY phase has an
unexpected three-band structure. We provide a detailed analysis of
quasiparticle properties of both the Kondo and the RKKY phase. The FS
reconstruction is accompanied by the appearance of a Luttinger surface (LS) on
which the $f$ self-energy diverges. The FS and LS volumes are related to the
density by a generalized Luttinger sum rule. We interpret the small FS volume
and the emergent LS as evidence for $f$-electron fractionalization in the RKKY
phase. Our Hall coefficient and specific heat are in good qualitative agreement
with experiment.

<h3>Characterizing the spontaneous collapse of a wavefunction through  entropy production</h3>

<i>Simone Artini, Mauro Paternostro</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the phenomenology leading to the non-conservation of energy of
the continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) model from the viewpoint of
non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and use such framework to assess the
equilibration process entailed by the dissipative formulation of the model
(dCSL). As a paradigmatic situation currently addressed in frontier experiments
aimed at investigating possible collapse theories, we consider a
one-dimensional mechanical oscillator in a thermal state. We perform our
analysis in the phase space of the oscillator, where the entropy production
rate, a non-equilibrium quantity used to characterize irreversibility, can be
conveniently analyzed. We show that the CSL model violates Clausius law, as it
exhibits a negative entropy production rate, while the dCSL model reaches
equilibrium consistently only under certain dynamical conditions, thus allowing
us to identify the values -- in the parameter space -- where the latter
mechanism can be faithfully used to describe a thermodynamically consistent
phenomenon.

discrete (Ising model) and continuous (Heisenberg model) order parameter.

Recently orbital Hall current has attracted attention as an alternative
method to switch the magnetization of ferromagnets. Here we present our
findings on electrical switching of antiferromagnetic state in Mn3Sn/Cr, where
despite the much smaller spin Hall angle of Cr, the switching current density
is comparable to heavy metal based heterostructures. On the other hand, the
inverse process, i.e., spin-to-charge conversion in Cr-based heterostructures
is much less efficient than the Pt-based equivalents, as manifested in the
almost one order of magnitude smaller terahertz emission intensity and spin
current induced magnetoresistance in Cr-based structures. These results in
combination with the slow decay of terahertz emission against Cr thickness
(diffusion length of ~11 nm) suggest that the observed magnetic switching can
be attributed to orbital current generation in Cr, followed by efficient
conversion to spin current. Our work demonstrates the potential of light metals
like Cr as an efficient orbital/spin current source for antiferromagnetic
spintronics.

<br>
<br>
The role of the Wasserstein distance in the thermodynamic speed limit
inequalities for Markov jump processes is investigated. We elucidate the nature
of the Wasserstein distance in the thermodynamic speed limit inequality from
three different perspectives with resolving three remaining problems. In the
first part, we derive a unified speed limit inequality for a general weighted
graph, which reproduces both the conventional speed limit inequality and the
trade-off relation between current and entropy production as its special case.
In the second part, we treat the setting where the tightest bound with the
Wasserstein distance has not yet been obtained and investigate why such a bound
is out of reach. In the third part, we compare the speed limit inequalities for
Markov jump processes with L$^1$-Wasserstein distance and for overdamped
Langevin systems with L$^2$-Wasserstein distance, and argue that these two have
different origins despite their apparent similarity.

<br>
<br>
Quantum dot (QD) solids are being widely exploited as a solution-processable
technology to develop photovoltaic, light-emission, and photo-detection
devices. Charge transport in these materials is the result of a compromise
between confinement at the individual QD level and electronic coupling among
the different nanocrystals in the ensemble. While this is commonly achieved by
ligand engineering in colloidal-based systems, ligand-free QD assemblies have
recently emerged as an exciting alternative where nanostructures can be
directly grown into porous matrices with optical quality as well as control
over their connectivity and hence charge transport properties. In this context,
we present a complete photophysical study comprising fluence and
temperature-dependent time-resolved spectroscopy to study carrier dynamics in
ligand-free QD networks with gradually varying degrees of interconnectivity,
which we achieve by changing the average distance between the QDs. Analysis of
the photoluminescence and absorption properties of the QD assemblies, involving
both static and time-resolved measurements, allows us to identify the weight of
the different recombination mechanisms, both radiative and non-radiative, as a
function of QD connectivity. We propose a picture where carrier diffusion,
which is needed for any optoelectronic application and implies inter-particle
transport, gives rise to the exposure of carriers to a larger defect landscape
than in the case of isolated QDs. The use of a broad range of fluences permits
extracting valuable information for applications demanding either low or high
carrier injection levels and highlighting the relevance of a judicious design
to balance recombination and diffusion.

<br>
<i>Sören Schweers, David F. Locher, Gunter M. Schütz, Philipp Maass</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that domain walls separating coexisting extremal current phases in
driven diffusive systems exhibit complex stochastic dynamics, with a
subdiffusive temporal growth of position fluctuations due to long-range
anticorrelated current fluctuations and a weak pinning at long times. This weak
pinning manifests itself in a saturated width of the domain wall position
fluctuations that increases sublinearly with the system size. As a function of
time $t$ and system size $L$, the width $w(t,L)$ exhibits a scaling behavior
$w(t,L)=L^{3/4}f(t/L^{9/4})$, with $f(u)$ constant for $u\gg1$ and $f(u)\sim
u^{1/3}$ for $u\ll1$. An Orstein-Uhlenbeck process with long-range
anticorrelated noise is shown to capture this scaling behavior. Results for the
drift coefficient of the domain wall motion point to memory effects in its
dynamics.

<h3>Impact of dephasing probes on incommensurate lattices</h3>

<br>
<i>Bishal Ghosh, Sandipan Mohanta, Manas Kulkarni, Bijay Kumar Agarwalla</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate open quantum dynamics for a one-dimensional incommensurate
Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper lattice chain, a part of which is initially filled with
electrons and is further connected to dephasing probes at the filled lattice
sites. This setup is akin to a step-initial configuration where the non-zero
part of the step is subjected to dephasing. We investigate the quantum dynamics
of local electron density, the scaling of the density front as a function of
time both inside and outside of the initial step, and the growth of the total
number of electrons outside the step. We analyze these quantities in all three
regimes, namely, the de-localized, critical, and localized phases of the
underlying lattice. Outside the initial step, we observe that the density front
spreads according to the underlying nature of single-particle states of the
lattice, for both the de-localized and critical phases. For the localized
phase, the spread of the density front hints at a logarithmic behaviour in time
that has no parallel in the isolated case (\emph{i.e.}, in the absence of
probes). Inside the initial step, due to the presence of the probes, the
density front spreads in a diffusive manner for all the phases. This
combination of rich and different dynamical behaviour, outside and inside the
initial step, results in the emergence of mixed dynamical phases. While the
total occupation of electrons remains conserved, the value outside or inside
the initial step turns out to have a rich dynamical behaviour. Our work is
widely adaptable and has interesting consequences when
disordered/quasi-disordered systems are subjected to a thermodynamically large
number of probes.

<h3>Emergence of a quasi-ergodic steady state in a dissipative  Tavis-Cummings array</h3>

<br>
<br>
In an atom-photon interacting system described by Tavis Cummings Hubbard
(TCH) model, we demonstrate the emergence of a quasi-steady state in a
dissipative environment that exhibits intriguing ergodic behavior. The TCH
model undergoes a dissipative transition from normal to superradiant phase
hosting a gapped Higgs and gapless Goldstone modes. However, in a large region
of the phase diagram, the instability of the Goldstone mode leads to the
disappearance of the stable superradiant phase. In this regime, the
decorrelator dynamics reveals light cone spreading of the perturbations and
positive Lyapunov exponent, indicating enhanced fluctuations. Remarkably, a
quasi-steady state emerges under quench dynamics in this unstable regime; in
this state, a class of collective quantities such as site averaged photon
number and atomic excitations approach a steady value, in spite of large
temporal fluctuations in corresponding microscopic variables. This quasi-steady
state describes an incoherent fluid of photons with significant phase
fluctuation. The phase space dynamics reveals a fascinating ergodic behavior in
presence of dissipation, leading to the characterization of the dynamical
variables into two distinct classes. The first class includes site-averaged
photon numbers and atomic excitations; these exhibit a stationary distribution
regardless of the initial condition indicating ergodic behavior. The second
class of variables, particularly those related to phase in contrast, retain
information about the initial conditions, resulting in a violation of
ergodicity for finite size system. Additionally, the dynamical variables of the
ergodic class exhibit fascinating collective scarring phenomenon as the peak of
their distribution is attracted towards the unstable steady state, analogous to
the single particle quantum scar. We discuss the relevance of our findings in
the current experiments.

We comment on the recent paper ``Floquet non-Abelian topological insulator
and multifold bulk-edge correspondence" by Tianyu Li and Haiping Hu, Nat. Comm.
{\bf 14}, 6418 (2023). Apart from the fact that the authors unjustly imply to
study multi-gap topology in Floquet systems for the first time, only known
homotopic relations are presented. While such insights are used to present
interesting Floquet phenomena and phases, which is an attractive result in
itself, they cannot be used to deduce the total bulk characterization in the
dynamical context without further proof. In fact, the authors essentially
rephrase a Zak phase description. These results should in particular be
contrasted to earlier results, arXiv:2208.12824, in which static-compatible Zak
phases {\it and} dynamical Dirac strings were shown to be able to {\it
distinguish} rather similar non-Abelian Floquet phases in $2+1$ dimensional
systems. As a result, the claim of a sharp multifold bulk-edge correspondence
cannot be concluded from the given arguments.

<br>
In this paper, starting from the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Yvon equations of the
liquid-state theory, we formulate two equivalent approaches for the calculation
of the total density profile and of the charge density profile of ionic fluids
near nonplanar charged surfaces. In the framework of these approaches, we
establish exact conditions, that a particular point of these profiles should
satisfy, in the form of contact theorems. These contact theorems for the total
density profile and the charge density profile are obtained by direct
integration of a system of equations derived from the
Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Yvon equations. The contact theorems for both profiles
have nonlocal character. It is shown that the contact value of the total
density profile for uncharged surfaces is characterized by the bulk pressure
and the surface tension. The contact theorems are applied to the cases of
spherical and cylindrical surfaces. It is shown that the contact theorem for
the total density profile coincides with the recent results obtained by W.

<h3>Roughness and critical force for depinning at 3-loop order</h3>

<i>Mikhail N. Semeikin, Kay Joerg Wiese</i>
<br>

A $d$-dimensional elastic manifold at depinning is described by a
renormalized field theory, based on the Functional Renormalization Group (FRG).
Here we analyze this theory to 3-loop order, equivalent to third order in
$\epsilon=4-d$, where $d$ is the internal dimension. The critical exponent
reads $\zeta = \frac \epsilon3 + 0.04777 \epsilon^2 -0.068354 \epsilon^3 +
{\cal O}(\epsilon^4)$. Using that $\zeta(d=0)=2^-$, we estimate
$\zeta(d=1)=1.266(20)$, $\zeta(d=2)=0.752(1)$ and $\zeta(d=3)=0.357(1)$. For
Gaussian disorder, the pinning force per site is estimated as $f_{\rm c}= {\cal
B} m^{2}\rho_m + f_{\rm c}^0$, where $m^2$ is the strength of the confining
potential, $\cal B$ a universal amplitude, $\rho_m$ the correlation length of
the disorder, and $f_{\rm c}^0$ a non-universal lattice dependent term. For
charge-density waves, we find a mapping to the standard $\phi^4$-theory with
$O(n)$ symmetry in the limit of $n\to -2$. This gives $f_{\rm c} = \tilde {\cal

Layered SnAs-based Zintl compounds exhibit a distinctive electronic
structure, igniting extensive research efforts in areas of superconductivity,
topological insulators and quantum magnetism. In this paper, we systematically
investigate the crystal structures and electronic properties of the Zintl
compound SrSn2As2 under high-pressure. At approximately 20.8 GPa,
pressure-induced superconductivity is observed in SrSn2As2 with a
characteristic dome-like evolution of Tc. Theoretical calculations together
with high pressure synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy have
identified that SrSn2As2 undergoes a structural transformation from a trigonal
to a monoclinic structure. Beyond 28.3 GPa, the superconducting transition
temperature is suppressed due to a reduction of the density of state at the
Fermi level. The discovery of pressure-induced superconductivity, accompanied
by structural transitions in SrSn2As2, greatly expands the physical properties
of layered SnAs-based compounds and provides a new ground states upon
compression.

The thesis discusses micromagnetic simulation studies on high-frequency
magnetic dynamics in three-dimensional ferromagnetic nanoarchitectures made of
interconnected magnetic nanowire networks. Such artificial magnetic materials
with nanoscale features have recently emerged as a vivid topic of research, as
their geometry has a decisive impact on their magnetic properties. By studying
their static magnetization structure, we find that these systems display a
behavior analogous to that of 3D artificial spin ice lattices, with frustrated
interactions and the emergence of monopole-like defect structures at the wires'
intersection points. Our simulations reveal a high activity of these defect
sites in the magnonic high-frequency spectrum. We study various 3D
nanoarchitectures and show that their geometry and magnetization state results
in characteristic high-frequency signatures. Controlling these features could
open new pathways for magnonics research and reprogrammable magnetic
metamaterials.

<br>
<br>
Lu5Rh6Sn18 is one of the caged-type quasiskutterudite superconductors with
superconducting transition temperature Tc = 4.12 K. Here, we investigate the
effect of pressure on the superconductivity in Lu5Rh6Sn18 by combining high
pressure electrical transport, synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD) and chemical
doping. Application of high pressure can enhance both the metallicity and the
superconducting transition temperature in Lu5Rh6Sn18. Tc is found to show a
continuous increase reaching up to 5.50 K at 11.4 GPa. Our high pressure
synchrotron XRD measurements demonstrate the stability of the pristine crystal
structure up to 12.0 GPa. In contrast, Tc is suppressed after the substitution
of La ions in Lu sites, inducing negative chemical pressure. Our study provides
valuable insights into the improvement of superconductivity in caged compounds.

Topological transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have attracted much
attention due to its potential applications in spintronics and quantum
computations. In this work, we systematically investigate the structural and
electronic properties of topological TMDCs candidate ZrTe2 under high pressure.
A pressure-induced Lifshitz transition is evidenced by the change of charge
carrier type as well as the Fermi surface. Superconductivity was observed at
around 8.3 GPa without structural phase transition. A typical dome-shape phase
diagram is obtained with the maximum Tc of 5.6 K for ZrTe2. Furthermore, our
theoretical calculations suggest the presence of multiple pressure-induced
topological quantum phase transitions, which coexists with emergence of
superconductivity. The results demonstrate that ZrTe2 with nontrivial topology
of electronic states display new ground states upon compression.

Functionalized graphene offers great potential in the field of rapid
detection of gases at room temperature. We performed first-principles
calculations to study the suitability of 4-sulfobenzenediazonium salts (4SBD)
as bandgap modifier in graphene. The signature of unpaired spins is evidenced
near the Fermi level owing to the symmetry breaking of graphene sublattices.
4SBD-chemisorbed on graphene is found to be electronically sensitive to the
presence of ammonia NH3 with increasing gas concentration.

<h3>Active Solids: Rigid Body Motion and Shape-changing Mechanisms</h3>

Active solids such as cell collectives, colloidal clusters, and active
metamaterials exhibit diverse collective phenomena, ranging from rigid body
motion to shape-changing mechanisms. The nonlinear dynamics of such active
materials remains however poorly understood when they host zero-energy
deformation modes and when noise is present. Here, we show that stress
propagation in active solids induces the spontaneous actuation of multiple soft
floppy modes, even without exciting vibrational modes. By introducing an
adiabatic approximation, we map the dynamics onto an effective Landau free
energy, predicting mode selection and the onset of collective dynamics. These
results open new ways to study and design living and robotic materials with
multiple modes of locomotion and shape-change.

<h3>Quantifying magnetic field driven lattice distortions in kagome metals  at the femto-scale using scanning tunneling microscopy</h3>

<br>
<br>
A wide array of unusual phenomena has recently been uncovered in kagome
solids. The charge density wave (CDW) state in the kagome superconductor AV3Sb5
in particular intrigued the community -- the CDW phase appears to break the
time-reversal symmetry despite the absence of spin magnetism, which has been
tied to exotic orbital loop currents possibly intertwined with magnetic field
tunable crystal distortions. To test this connection, precise determination of
the lattice response to applied magnetic field is crucial, but can be
challenging at the atomic-scale. We establish a new scanning tunneling
microscopy based method to study the evolution of the AV3Sb5 atomic structure
as a function of magnetic field. The method substantially reduces the errors of
typical STM measurements, which are at the order of 1% when measuring an
in-plane lattice constant change. We find that the out-of-plane lattice
constant of AV3Sb5 remains unchanged (within 10^-6) by the application of both
in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. We also reveal that the in-plane
lattice response to magnetic field is at most at the order of 0.05%. Our
experiments provide further constraints on time-reversal symmetry breaking in
kagome metals, and establish a new tool for higher-resolution extraction of the
field-lattice coupling at the nanoscale applicable to other quantum materials.

In this work, we study unconventional anisotropic topologically ordered
phases in 3d that manifest type-II fractonic physics along sub-manifolds. While
they behave as usual topological order along a preferred spatial direction,
their physics along perpendicular planes is dictated by the presence of fractal
subsystem symmetries, completely restricting the mobility of anyonic
excitations and their bound states. We consider an explicit lattice model
realization of such phases and proceed to study their properties under periodic
boundary conditions and, later, in the presence of boundaries. We find that for
specific lattice sizes, the system possesses line and fractal membrane
symmetries that are mutually anomalous, resulting in a non-trivially gapped
ground state space. This amounts to the spontaneous breaking of the fractal
symmetries, implying a sub-extensive ground state degeneracy. For the remaining
system sizes the fractal symmetries are explicitly broken by the periodic
boundary conditions, which is intrinsically related to the uniqueness of the
ground state. Despite of that, the system is still topologically ordered since
locally created quasi-particles have nontrivial mutual statistics and, in the
presence of boundaries, it still presents anomalous edge modes. The intricate
symmetry interplay dictated by the lattice size is a wild manifestation of
ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing.

<h3>Realization and detection of Kitaev quantum spin liquid with Rydberg  atoms</h3>

The Kitaev chiral spin liquid has captured widespread interest in recent
decades because of its intrinsic non-Abelian excitations, yet the experimental
realization is challenging. Here we propose to realize and detect Kitaev chiral
spin liquid in a deformed honeycomb array of Rydberg atoms. Through a novel
laser-assisted dipole-dipole interaction mechanism to generate both effective
hopping and pairing terms for hard-core bosons, together with van der Waals
interaction, we achieve the Kitaev spin liquid model with high precision. The
gapped non-Abelian spin liquid phase is then obtained. Further, we propose to
probe the chiral Majorana edge modes by light Bragg scattering and by imagining
their chiral motion, in which only spin degree of freedom needs to be measured.
Our work broadens the range of exotic quantum many-body phases that can be
realized and detected in atomic systems, and makes an important step toward
manipulating non-Abelian anyons.

We demonstrate a practical way to perform decomposition of the elasto-plastic
deformation directly from atomistic simulation snapshots. Through molecular
dynamics simulations on a large single crystal, we elucidate the intricate
process of converting plastic strain, atomic strain, and rigid rotation during
irradiation. Our study highlights how prismatic dislocation loops act as
initiators of plastic strain effects in heavily irradiated metals, resulting in
experimentally measurable alterations in lattice strain. We show the onset of
plastic strain starts to emerge at high dose, leading to the spontaneous
emergence of dislocation creep and irradiation-induced lattice swelling. This
phenomenon arises from the agglomeration of dislocation loops into a
dislocation network. Furthermore, our numerical framework enables us to
categorize the plastic transformation into two distinct types: pure slip events
and slip events accompanied by lattice swelling. The latter type is
particularly responsible for the observed divergence in interstitial and
vacancy counts, and also impacts the behavior of dislocations, potentially
activating non-conventional slip systems.

<h3>Plasmon Fizeau drag in 3D Dirac and Weyl semimetals</h3>

<br>
<br>
There is a need for compact, dynamically tunable nonreciprocal optical
elements to enable on-chip-compatible optical isolators and more efficient
radiative energy transfer systems. Plasmon Fizeau drag, the drag of electrical
current on propagating surface plasmon polaritons, has been proposed to induce
nonreciprocal surface modes to enable one-way energy transport. However,
relativistic electron drift velocities are required to induce appreciable
contrast between the dispersion characteristics of co-propagating and
counter-propagating surface plasmon modes. The high electron drift velocity of
graphene previously allowed for the experimental demonstration of
current-induced nonreciprocity in a two-dimensional (2D) Dirac material. The
high electron drift and Fermi velocities in three-dimensional (3D) Dirac
materials make them ideal candidates for the effect, however, both the theory
of the Fizeau drag effect and its experimental demonstrations in 3D Dirac
materials are missing. Here we develop a comprehensive theory of Fizeau drag in
DC-biased 3D Weyl semimetals (WSM) or Dirac semimetals (DSM), both under local
and non-local approximation and with dissipative losses. We predict that under
practical assumptions for loss, Fizeau drag in the DSM Cd$_3$As$_2$ opens
windows of pseudo-unidirectional transport. We additionally introduce new
figures of merit to rank nonreciprocal plasmonic systems by their potential for
directional SPP transport. Further, we propose a new approach for achieving
appreciable plasmonic Fizeau drag via optically pumping bulk inversion symmetry
breaking WSMs or DSMs.

<h3>Flat band effects on the ground-state BCS-BEC crossover in atomic Fermi  gases in a quasi-two-dimensional Lieb lattice</h3>

The ground-state superfluid behavior of ultracold atomic Fermi gases with an
on-site attractive interaction in a quasi-two-dimensional Lieb lattice is
studied using BCS mean-field theory, within the context of BCS-BEC crossover.
We find that the flat band leads to nontrivial exotic effects. As the Fermi
level enters the flat band, both the pairing gap and the in-plane superfluid
density exhibit an unusual power law as a function of interaction, with
strongly enhanced quantum geometric effects, in addition to a dramatic increase
of compressibility as the interaction approaches the BCS limit. As the Fermi
level crosses the van Hove singularities, the character of pairing changes from
particle-like to hole-like or vice versa. We present the computed phase
diagram, in which a pair density wave state emerges at high densities with
relatively strong interaction strength.

We systematically explore the structural and electronic properties of twisted
trilayer graphene systems. In general, these systems are characterized by two
twist angles, which lead to two incommensurate moir\'{e} periods. We show that
lattice relaxation results in the formation of domains of periodic
single-moir\'{e} structures only for twist angles close to the simplest
fractions. For the majority of other twist angles, the incommensurate moir\'{e}
periods lead to a fundamentally quasicrystalline structure. We identify
experimentally relevant magic angles at which the electronic density of states
is sharply peaked and strongly correlated physics is most likely to be
realized.
