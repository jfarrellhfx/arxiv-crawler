<h3>Metallic states in Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O induced by the Cu/O-insertions  and carrier doping</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07345" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07345</a>

The reports of room-temperature superconductivity in Cu-doped Pb-apatite draw
intense interests and debates. Herein, based on the density functional theory,
we show that the Cu-insertion in Pb-apatite is thermodynamically stable and
further carrier doping can convert the system CuPb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O into
metal. The electric conduction is mainly along the one-dimensional (1D) Cu-O
chains in the c-axis (out-of-plane). The calculated conductance along the
c-axis is larger than the in-plane ones by 2 magnitude orders, indicating the
1D conduction behavior. Moreover, the 1D Cu-O chain is an anti-ferromagnetic
Mott insulator at zero-doping point due to the super-exchange. Further
electron/hole-doping will erase the anti-ferromagnetism. Therefore, the
Cu-inserted system CuPb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O show transport and magnetic
features similar to the cuprate superconductors. On the other hand, the
O-insertion can also induce the metallic states, in which the conductance along
the out-of-plane direction is higher than the in-plane direction by 6-folds.
Our results display the metallization of Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O via
Cu/O-insertions, and suggesting the electric conductions along the c-axis might
dominate the transport behaviors.

<h3>Classical Non-Relativistic Fractons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07372" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07372</a>
<br>

<br>
We initiate the study of the classical mechanics of non-relativistic fractons
in its simplest setting - that of identical one dimensional particles with
local Hamiltonians characterized by by a conserved dipole moment in addition to
the usual symmetries of space and time translation invariance. We introduce a
family of models and study the $N$ body problem for them. We find that locality
leads to a ``Machian" dynamics in which a given particle exhibits finite
inertia only if within a specified distance of at least another one. For well
separated particles this leads to immobility, much as for quantum models of
fractons discussed before. For two or more particles within inertial reach of
each other at the start of motion we get an interesting interplay of inertia
and interactions. Specifically for a solvable ``inertia only" model of fractons
we find that $N=2$ particles always become immobile at long times. Remarkably
$N =3$ particles generically evolve to a late time state with one immobile
particle and two that oscillate about a common center of mass with
generalizations of such ``Machian clusters" for $N > 3$ . Interestingly,
Machian clusters exhibit physical limit cycles in a Hamiltonian system even
though mathematical limit cycles are forbidden by Liouville's theorem.

<h3>Transport signatures of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces in normal  metal/time-reversal symmetry broken $d$-wave superconductor junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07376" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07376</a>

<br>

In recent times, Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) in superconductors (SCs)
have drawn significant attention due to a substantial population of Bogoliubov
quasiparticles (BQPs) together with Cooper pairs (CPs) in them. The BQPs as
zero energy excitations give rise to captivating and intricate charge dynamics
within the BFSs. In this theoretical study, we propose to reveal the unique
signatures of the topologically protected BFSs in a normal metal/time-reversal
symmetry (TRS) broken $d$-wave SC, in terms of the differential conductance and
Fano factor (FF). For an isotropic $d$-wave SC, an enhancement in zero-bias
conductance (ZBC) can be identified as a key signature of BFSs. However, for
the anisotropic SC, this feature does not replicate due to the presence of the
localized Andreev bound state (ABS) at the interface. The interplay of ABS and
BFSs gives rise to an anomalous behavior in ZBC. We explain this anomalous
behavior by analyzing the effective charge of the carriers in terms of the FF.
The simplicity of our setup based on $d$-wave SC makes our proposal persuasive.

<h3>Disorder Operator and Rényi Entanglement Entropy of Symmetric Mass  Generation</h3>

In recent years a consensus has gradually been reached that the previously
proposed deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) for spin-1/2 systems, an
archetypal example of quantum phase transition beyond the classic Landau's
paradigm, actually does not correspond to a true unitary conformal field theory
(CFT). In this work we carefully investigate another type of quantum phase
transition supposedly beyond the similar classic paradigm, the so called
``symmetric mass generation" (SMG) transition proposed in recent years. We
employ the sharp diagnosis including the scaling of disorder operator and
R\'enyi entanglement entropy in large-scale lattice model quantum Monte Carlo
simulations. Our results strongly suggest that the SMG transition is indeed an
unconventional quantum phase transition and it should correspond to a true
$(2+1)d$ unitary CFT.

Interfacing superconductors with magnetic or topological materials offers a
playground where novel phenomena like topological superconductivity, Majorana
zero modes, or superconducting spintronics are emerging. In this work, we
discuss recent developments in the Kohn-Sham Bogoliubov-de Gennes method, which
allows to perform material-specific simulations of complex superconducting
heterostructures on the basis of density functional theory. As a model system
we study magnetically-doped Pb. In our analysis we focus on the interplay of
magnetism and superconductivity. This combination leads to Yu-Shiba-Rusinov
(YSR) in-gap bound states at magnetic defects and the breakdown of
superconductivity at larger impurity concentrations. Moreover, the influence of
spin-orbit coupling and on orbital splitting of YSR states as well as the
appearance of a triplet component in the order parameter is discussed. These
effects can be exploited in S/F/S-type devices (S=superconductor,
F=ferromagnet) in the field of superconducting spintronics.

<h3>Trends of electronic structures and $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing for the  rare-earth series in bilayer nickelate superconductor $R_ 3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07386" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07386</a>

<i>Yang Zhang, Ling-Fang Lin, Adriana Moreo, Thomas A. Maier, Elbio Dagotto</i>
<br>
<br>
The recent discovery of pressure-induced superconductivity in the bilayer
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) has opened a new platform for the study of
unconventional superconductors. In this publication, we investigate
theoretically the whole family of bilayer 327-type nickelates $R_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
($R$ = Rare-earth elements) under pressure. From La to Lu, the lattice
constants and volume decrease, leading to enhanced in-plane and out-plane
hoppings, resulting in an ``effectively'' reduced electronic correlation $U/W$.
Furthermore, the Ni's $t_{2g}$ states shift away from the $e_g$ states, while
the crystal-field splitting between $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ is almost
unchanged. In addition, six candidates were found to become stable in the Fmmm
phase, with increasing values of critical pressure as the atomic number
increases. Similar to the case of LNO, the $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing tendency
dominates in all candidates, due to the nesting between the {\bf M}=$(\pi,\pi)$
and the {\bf X}=$(\pi,0)$ and {\bf Y}=$(0,\pi)$ points in the Brillouin zone.
Then, $T_c$ is expected to decrease as the radius of rare-earth (RE) ions
decreases. Our results suggest that LNO is already the ``optimal'' candidate
among the whole RE bilayer nickelates, and to increase $T_c$ we suggest to grow
on special substrates with larger in-plane lattice spacings.

The capacities of various interatomic potentials to reconstruct the
properties of germanene (2D germanium) allotropes were investigated. Structural
and mechanical properties \comm{, as well as phonon dispersion} of the flat
(F), low-buckled (LB), trigonal dumbbell (TD) and large honeycomb dumbbell
(LHD) single-layer germanium (germanene) phases, were obtained using the
density functional theory (DFT) and molecular statics (MS) computations with
Tersoff, MEAM, Stillinger-Weber, EDIP, ReaxFF and machine-learning-based
(ML-IAP) interatomic potentials. A systematic quantitative comparative study
and discussion of the findings are given.

Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) can host an intriguing variety
of gate-tunable correlated states, including superconducting and correlated
insulator states. Junction-based superconducting devices, such as Josephson
junctions and SQUIDs, have been introduced recently and enable the exploration
of the charge, spin, and orbital nature of superconductivity and the coherence
of moir\'e electrons in MATBG. However, complementary fundamental coherence
effects - in particular, the Little-Parks effect in a superconducting and the
Aharonov-Bohm effect in a normal conducting ring - remained to be observed.
Here, we report the observation of both these phenomena in a single
gate-defined ring device where we can embed a superconducting or normal
conducting ring in a correlated or band insulator. We directly observe the
Little-Parks effect in the superconducting phase diagram as a function of
density and magnetic field, confirming the effective charge of $2e$. By
measuring the Aharonov-Bohm effect, we find that in our device, the coherence
length of normal conducting moir\'e electrons exceeds a few microns at 50 mK.
Surprisingly, we also identify a regime characterized by $h/e$-periodic
oscillations but with superconductor-like nonlinear transport. Taken together,
these experiments establish a novel device platform in MATBG, and more
generally in tunable 2D materials, to unravel the nature of superconductivity
and other correlated quantum states in these materials.

<h3>Cu-substituted lead phosphate apatite as an inversion-asymmetric Weyl  semimetal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07408" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07408</a>
<br>
<i>Benjamin T. Zhou, Marcel Franz</i>
<br>
<br>
Based on symmetry arguments and the latest density functional results for the
copper-substituted lead phosphate apatite (`LK-99'), we show that, at the
non-interacting level, the material is an inversion-asymmetric Weyl semimetal.
A pair of Weyl nodes with opposite chiralities emerge at different energies in
the vicinity of the time-reversal-invariant $\Gamma$ and ${\rm A}$ points of
the 3D Brillouin zone. These are characterized by unusual Weyl charges of
$C_{\rm W} = \pm 2$ and are connected by two branches of topologically
protected Fermi arc states on surfaces parallel to the principal $c$-axis. We
further study important effects of the atomic spin-orbit coupling on the band
structure and the electronic properties of the material in general. Possible
implications of the proposed band topology on the strong correlation physics
are also discussed.

<h3>Fokker-Planck equations for a trapped particle in a quantum-thermal  Ohmic bath: General theory and applications to Josephson junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07423" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07423</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We consider a particle trapped by a generic external potential and under the
influence of a quantum-thermal Ohmic bath. Starting from the Langevin equation
we derive the corresponding Schwinger-Keldysh action. Then, within the
path-integral formalism, we obtain both the semiclassical Fokker-Planck
equation and the quantum Fokker-Planck equation for this out-of-equilibrium
system. In the case of an external harmonic potential and in the underdamped
regime, we find that our Fokker-Planck equations contain an effective
temperature $T_{\rm eff}$, which crucially depends on the interplay between
quantum and thermal fluctuations in contrast to the classical Fokker-Planck
equation. In the regime of high temperatures, one recovers the classical
Fokker-Planck equation. As an application of our result, we also provide the
stationary solution of the semiclassical Fokker-Planck equations for a
superconducting Josephson circuit and for a Bose Josephson junction, which are
experimentally accessible.

<h3>Similarity between a many-body quantum avalanche model and the  ultrametric random matrix model</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
In the field of ergodicity-breaking phases, it has been recognized that
quantum avalanches can destabilize many-body localization at a wide range of
disorder strengths. This has in particular been demonstrated by the numerical
study of a toy model, sometimes simply called the ''avalanche model'' or the
''quantum sun model'' [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 060602 (2022)], which consists of
an ergodic seed coupled to a perfectly localized material. In this paper, we
connect this toy model to a well-studied model in random matrix theory, the
ultrametric ensemble. We conjecture that the models share the following
features. 1) The location of the critical point is predicted sharply by
analytics. 2) On the localized site, both models exhibit Fock space
localization. 3) There is a manifold of critical points. On the critical
manifold, the eigenvectors exhibit nontrivial multifractal behaviour that can
be tuned by moving on the manifold. 4) The spectral statistics is intermediate
between Poisson statistics and random matrix statistics, also tunable on the
critical manifold. We confirm numerically these properties.

<h3>Anharmonic Strong-Coupling Effects at the Origin of the Charge Density  Wave in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</h3>

The formation of charge density waves (CDW) is a long-standing open problem
particularly in dimensions higher than one. Various observations in the
vanadium antimonides discovered recently, such as the missing Kohn anomaly in
the acoustic phonons or the latent heat at the transition $T_{\rm CDW}$ = 95 K
, further underpin this notion. Here, we study the Kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$
using polarized inelastic light scattering. The electronic energy gap $2\Delta$
as derived from the redistribution of the continuum is much larger than
expected from mean-field theory and reaches values above 20 for $2\Delta/k_{\rm
B}T_{\rm CDW}$. The A$_{1g}$ phonon has a discontinuity at $T_{\rm CDW}$ and a
precursor starting 20 K above $T_{\rm CDW}$. Density functional theory
qualitatively reproduces the redistribution of the electronic continuum at the
CDW transition and the phonon energies of the pristine and distorted
structures. The linewidths of all A$_{1g}$ and E$_{2g}$ phonon lines including
those emerging below $T_{\rm CDW}$ were analyzed in terms of anharmonic
symmetric decay revealing strong phonon-phonon coupling. In addition, we
observe two CDW amplitude modes (AMs): one in A$_{1g}$ symmetry and one in
E$_{2g}$ symmetry. The temperature dependence of both modes deviates from the
prediction of mean-field theory. The A$_{1g}$ AM displays an asymmetric
Fano-type lineshape, suggestive of strong electron-phonon coupling. The
asymmetric A$_{1g}$ AM, along with the discontinuity of the A$_{1g}$ phonon,
the large phonon-phonon coupling parameters and the large gap ratio, indicate
the importance of anharmonic strong phonon-phonon and electron-phonon coupling
for the CDW formation in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.

<h3>Systematic determination of coupling constants in spin clusters from  broken-symmetry mean-field solutions</h3>

Quantum-chemical calculations aimed at deriving magnetic coupling constants
in exchange-coupled spin clusters commonly utilize a broken-symmetry (BS)
approach. This involves calculating several distinct collinear spin
configurations, predominantly by density-functional theory (DFT). The energies
of these configurations are interpreted in terms of the Heisenberg model to
determine coupling constants for spin pairs. However, this energy-based
procedure has inherent limitations, primarily in its inability to provide
information on isotropic spin interactions beyond those included in the
Heisenberg model. Biquadratic exchange or multi-center terms, for example, are
usually inaccessible and hence assumed to be negligible. The present work
introduces a novel approach employing BS mean-field solutions, specifically
Hartree-Fock wave functions, for the construction of effective spin
Hamiltonians. This expanded method facilitates the extraction of a broader
range of coupling parameters by considering not only the energies, but also
Hamiltonian and overlap elements between different BS states. We demonstrate
how comprehensive s = 1/2 Hamiltonians, including multi-center terms, can be
straightforwardly constructed from a complete set of BS solutions. The approach
is exemplified for small clusters within the context of the half-filled
single-band Hubbard model. This allows to contrast the current strategy against
exact results, thereby offering an enriched understanding of the
spin-Hamiltonian construction from BS solutions.

A series of recent experimental works on twisted MoTe$_2$ homobilayers have
unveiled an abundance of exotic states in this system. Valley-polarized quantum
anomalous Hall states have been identified at hole doping of $\nu = -1$, and
the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect is observed at $\nu = -2/3$ and
$\nu = -3/5$. In this work, we investigate the electronic properties of
AA-stacked twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ at $\nu=-2$ by $k$-space Hartree-Fock
calculations. We find that the phase diagram is qualitatively similar to the
phase diagram of a Kane-Mele-Hubbard with staggered onsite potential. A
noteworthy phase within the diagram is the antiferromagnetic Chern insulator,
stabilized by the external electric field. We attribute the existence of this
Chern insulator to an antiferromagnetic instability at a topological phase
transition between the quantum spin hall phase and a band insulator phase. We
highlight that the antiferromagnetic Chern insulator phase is most evident at a
twist angle of approximately $4^\circ$. Our research proposes the potential of
realizing a Chern insulator beyond $\nu=-1$, and contributes fresh perspectives
on the interplay between band topology and electron-electron correlations in
moir\'e superlattices.

<h3>Universal quantum computing based on magnetic domain wall qubits</h3>

Quantum computers allow to solve efficiently certain problems that are
intractable for classical computers. For the realization of a quantum computer,
a qubit design as the basic building block is a nontrivial starting point. We
propose the utilization of nanoscale magnetic domain walls, which are
stabilized by achiral energy, as the building blocks for a universal quantum
computer made of ferromagnetic racetracks. In contrast to the domain walls
stabilized by conventional Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, these achiral
domain walls are bistable and show two degenerate chirality forms. When the
domain wall is extremely small, it can be viewed as a quantum mechanical object
and the two degenerate chiralities of the domain walls can be used to encode
the qubit states $\lvert 0 \rangle$ and $\lvert 1 \rangle$. We show that the
single-qubit quantum gates are regulated by magnetic and electric fields, while
the Ising exchange coupling facilitates the two-qubit gates. The integration of
these quantum gates allows for a universal quantum computation. Our findings
demonstrate a promising approach for achieving quantum computing through spin
textures that exist in ferromagnetic materials.

<h3>Topological Phases, Local Magnetic Moments, and Spin Polarization  Triggered by C558-Line Defects in Graphene</h3>

We study the electronic properties of a novel topological defect structure
for graphene interspersed with C558-line defects along the Armchair boundary.
This system has the topological property of being topologically three-periodic
and the type-II Dirac-fermionic character of the embedded topological phase. At
the same time, we show computationally that the topological properties of the
system are overly dependent on the coupling of this line defect. Using strain
engineering to regulate the magnitude of hopping at the defect, the position of
the energy level can be easily changed to achieve a topological phase
transition. We also discuss the local magnetic moment and the ferromagnetic
ground state in the context of line defects, which is the conclusion after
considering additional Coulomb interactions. This leads to spin polarization of
the whole system. Finally, by modulating the local magnetic moment at the
position of the line defect, we achieve a tunable spin quantum conductance in a
one-dimensional nanoribbon. Near the Fermi energy level, it also has the
property of complete spin polarization. Consequently, spin filtering can be
achieved by varying the incident energy of the electrons.

<h3>High-Order Topological Phase Diagram Revealed by Anomalous Nernst Effect  in Janus ScClI Monolayer</h3>

Higher-order topological properties of two-dimensional(2D) magnetic materials
have recently been proposed. In 2D ferromagnetic Janus materials, we find that
ScClI is a second-order topological insulator (SOTI). By means of a
multi-orbital tight-binding model, we analyze the orbital contributions of
higher-order topologies. Further, we give the complete high-order topological
phase diagram of ScClI, based on the external field modulation of the
magneto-valley coupling and energy levels. 2D ScClI has a pronounced valley
polarization, which causes different insulating phases to exhibit completely
different anomalous Nernst conductance. As a result, we use the matched
anomalous Nernst effect to reveal the topological phase transition process of
ScClI. We utilize the characteristics of valley electronics to link
higher-order topological materials with the anomalous Nernst effect, which has
potential implications for high-order topological insulators and valley
electronics.

Thin films of HfO2 doped with 4% La were fabricated on LSMO/STO (100)
substrates using pulsed laser deposition. The stability of the ferroelectric
orthorhombic phase in the hafnia films was investigated with respect to varying
oxygen pressure during deposition. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy measurements were carried out to analyze the structure and
composition of the films and correlated with their ferroelectric properties.
Surprisingly, the ferroelectricity of the hafnia films showed a dependence on
oxygen pressure during deposition of LSMO bottom electrode as well. The reason
for this dependence is discussed in terms of the active role of non-lattice
oxygen in the ferroelectric switching of hafnia.

The utilization of polarized neutrons is of great importance in scientific
disciplines spanning materials science, physics, biology, and chemistry.
Polarization analysis offers insights into otherwise unattainable sample
information such as magnetic domains and structures, protein crystallography,
composition, orientation, ion-diffusion mechanisms, and relative location of
molecules in multicomponent biological systems. State-of-the-art multilayer
polarizing neutron optics have limitations, particularly low specular
reflectivity and polarization at higher scattering vectors/angles, and the
requirement of high external magnetic fields to saturate the polarizer
magnetization. Here, we show that by incorporating 11B4C into Fe/Si
multilayers, amorphization and smooth interfaces can be achieved, yielding
higher neutron reflectivity, less diffuse scattering and higher polarization.
Magnetic coercivity is eliminated, and magnetic saturation can be reached at
low external fields (>2 mT). This approach offers prospects for significant
improvement in polarizing neutron optics, enabling; nonintrusive positioning of
the polarizer, enhanced flux, increased data accuracy, and further
polarizing/analyzing methods at neutron scattering facilities.

Cell adhesion proteins typically form stable clusters that anchor the cell
membrane to its environment. Several works have suggested that cell membrane
protein clusters can emerge from a local feedback between the membrane
curvature and the density of proteins. Here, we investigate the effect of such
curvature-sensing mechanism in the context of cell adhesion proteins. We show
how clustering emerges in an intermediate range of adhesion and
curvature-sensing strengths. We identify key differences with the tilt-induced
gradient sensing mechanism we previously proposed (Lin et al.,
arXiv:2307.03670, 2023).

magnetic field, ${\bf B}_\mathrm{fic}$) contribution. We calculate the band
structure of Li atoms in the SDOLP as a function of the laser intensity and an
external magnetic field ${\bf B}_{\mathrm{ext}} = B_{\mathrm{ext}} {\hat {\bf
z}}$. We also calculate the Chern numbers of the SDOLP and show that depending
on $B_{\mathrm{ext}}$, the system is an ordinary insulator, an Abeliean
topological insulator (TI), or a non-Abelian TI. Introducing a blue-detuned
laser potential, $V_{\mathrm{BD}}(y) = V_{\mathrm{BD},0}(y) \Theta (|y| -
L_y/2)$, results in edges for the SDOL. We calculate the resulting edge states
(some of which are topological) and study their density, current density,
spin-current density and correlate the edge states with the Chern numbers.

Multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) are produced by combining metallic
elements in what is a diverse range of proportions. MPEAs reported to date have
revealed promising performance due to their exceptional mechanical properties.
Training a machine learning (ML) model on known performance data is a
reasonable method to rationalise the complexity of composition dependent
mechanical properties of MPEAs. This study utilises data from a specifically
curated dataset, that contains information regarding six mechanical properties
of MPEAs. A parser tool was introduced to convert chemical composition of
alloys into the input format of the ML models, and a number of ML models were
applied. Finally, Gradio was used to visualise the ML model predictions and to
create a user-interactive interface. The ML model presented is an initial
primitive model (as it does not factor in aspects such as MPEA production and
processing route), however serves as a an initial user tool, whilst also
providing a workflow for other researchers.

We perform a theoretical examination of the local electronic structure in the
recently discovered bilayer high-temperature superconductor
${\mathrm{La}_3\mathrm{Ni}_2\mathrm{O}_7}$. Our method begins with a bilayer
two-orbital tight-binding model, incorporating various pairing interaction
channels. We determine superconducting order parameters by self-consistently
solving the real-space Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations, revealing a robust
and stable extended s-wave pairing symmetry. We investigate the single impurity
effect using both self-consistent BdG equations and non-self-consistent
T-matrix methods, uncovering low-energy in-gap states that can be explained
with the T-matrix approach. Additionally, we analyze magnetic vortex states
using a self-consistent BdG technique, which shows a peak-hump structure in the
local density of states at the vortex center. Our results provide identifiable
features that can be used to determine the pairing symmetry of the
superconducting ${\mathrm{La}_3\mathrm{Ni}_2\mathrm{O}_7}$ material.

<br>
<br>
We present the current-induced switching of the internal magnetization
direction in a magnetic topological insulator/topological insulator
heterostructure in the quantum anomalous Hall regime. The switching process is
based on the bias current dependence of the coercive field, which is attributed
to the effect of the spin-orbit torque provided by the unpolarized bias
current. Increasing the bias current leads to a decrease in the magnetic order
in the sample. When the applied current is subsequently reduced, the magnetic
moments align with an externally applied magnetic field, resulting in
repolarization in the opposite direction. This includes a reversal of the spin
polarisation and hence a reversal of the chiral edge mode. Possible
applications in spintronic devices are discussed.

Heterostructures between two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHI)
and superconducting materials can allow for the presence of Majorana Fermions
at their conducting edge states. Although a strong interface hybridization
helps induce a reasonable superconducting gap on the topological material, the
hybridization can modify the material's electronic structure. In this work, we
utilize a realistic low-energy model with tunable interlayer hybridization to
study the edge state physics in a heterostructure between monolayer quantum
spin Hall insulator 1T$^\prime$-WTe$_2$ and s-wave superconductor 2H-NbSe$_2$.
We find that even in the presence of strong inter-layer hybridization that
renders the surface to become conducting, the edge state shows a significantly
enhanced local density of states and induced superconductivity compared to the
surface. We provide an alternate heterostructure geometry that can utilize the
strong inter-layer hybridization and realize a spatial interface between a
regime with a clean QSHI gap and a topological conducting edge state.

We study electron states, bound to topological textures such as skyrmions and
domain walls in a N\'eel antiferromagnet. In certain limits, we find the
dependence of bound states on the geometry of the texture, and estimate the
bound-state contribution to its energy. This contribution proves significant
compared with the purely magnetic energy, and substantially affects the
equilibrium geometry of the texture. The bound-state contribution also induces
a large shift of the transition line between the modulated and the uniform
phase, extending the latter.

<h3>Tuning the confinement potential between spinons in the Ising chain  CoNb2O6 using longitudinal fields and quantitative determination of the  microscopic Hamiltonian</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Ising chain realizes the fundamental paradigm of spin fractionalization,
where locally flipping a spin creates two domain walls (spinons) that can
separate apart at no energy cost. In a quasi-one-dimensional system, the
mean-field effects of the weak three-dimensional couplings confine the spinons
into a Zeeman ladder of two-spinon bound states. Here, we experimentally tune
the confinement potential between spinons in the quasi-one-dimensional Ising
ferromagnet CoNb2O6 by means of an applied magnetic field with a large
component along the Ising direction. Using high-resolution single crystal
inelastic neutron scattering, we directly observe how the spectrum evolves from
the limit of very weak confinement at low field (with many closely-spaced bound
states with energies scaling as the field strength to the power 2/3) to very
strong confinement at high field (where it consists of a magnon and a
dispersive two-magnon bound state, with a linear field dependence). At
intermediate fields, we explore how the higher-order bound states disappear
from the spectrum as they move to higher energies and overlap with the
two-particle continuum. By performing a global fit to the observed spectrum in
zero field and high field applied along two orthogonal directions, combined
with a quantitative parameterization of the interchain couplings, we propose a
refined single chain and interchain Hamiltonian that quantitatively reproduces
all observed dispersions and their field dependence.

Our understanding of physical properties of quasicrystals owes a great deal
to studies of tight-binding models constructed on quasiperiodic tilings. Among
the large number of possible quasiperiodic structures, two dimensional tilings
are of particular importance -- in their own right but also for providing clues
to properties of three dimensional systems. In this review we have provided a
users manual for those wishing to construct and study physical properties of
one of the best-known 2D tilings, the 8-fold Ammann-Beenker quasicrystal. We
describe the methodology in some detail. We also provide a compendium of the
principal geometric properties of the infinite quasicrystal and its periodic
approximants some of which have not previously been published.

electrolyte must possess ionic conductivity comparable to that of conventional
liquid electrolytes. To achieve this conductivity range, the series
Li$_{6.8-y}$Ge$_{0.05}$La$_3$Zr$_{2-y}$Ta$_y$O$_{12}$ ($y = 0, 0.15, 0.25,
0.35, 0.45$) has been synthesized using solid-state reaction method and studied
using various characterization techniques. The highly conducting cubic phase is
confirmed from XRD analysis. Structural information was collected using SEM and
density measurements. The prepared ceramic sample containing 0.25 Ta, sintered
at 1050$^\circ$C for 7.30 hrs shows the maximum ionic conductivity of 6.61 x
10$^{-4}$ S/cm at 25$^\circ$C. The air stability of the same ceramic has also
been evaluated after exposure for 5 months. The minimum activation energy
associated with the maximum conductivity of 0.25 Ta is 0.25 eV. The DC
conductivity measurements were done to confirm the ionic nature of conductivity
for all ceramic samples. The stable result of ionic conductivity makes the 0.25
Ta containing ceramic sample a promising candidate for solid electrolytes for
ASSB applications.

A spinwave Ising machine (SWIM) is a newly proposed type of time-multiplexed
hardware solver for combinatorial optimization that employs feedback coupling
and phase sensitive amplification to map an Ising Hamiltonian into
phase-binarized propagating spin-wave RF pulses in an Yttrium-Iron-Garnet (YIG)
film. In this work, we increase the mathematical complexity of the SWIM by
adding a global Zeeman term to a 4-spin MAX-CUT Hamiltonian using a continuous
external electrical signal with the same frequency as the spin pulses and phase
locked with with one of the two possible states. We are able to induce
ferromagnetic ordering in both directions of the spin states despite
antiferromagnetic pairwise coupling. Embedding a planar antiferromagnetic spin
system in a magnetic field has been proven to increase the complexity of the
graph associated to its Hamiltonian and thus this straightforward
implementation helps explore higher degrees of complexity in this evolving
solver.

Severe plastic deformation changes the microstructure and properties of
steels, which may be favourable for their use in structural components of
nuclear reactors. In this study, high-pressure torsion (HPT) was used to refine
the grain structure of Eurofer-97, a ferritic/ martensitic steel. Electron
microscopy and X-ray diffraction were used to characterise the microstructural
changes. Following HPT, the average grain size reduced by a factor of $\sim$
30, with a marked increase in high-angle grain boundaries. Dislocation density
also increased by more than one order of magnitude. The thermal stability of
the deformed material was investigated via in-situ annealing during synchrotron
X-ray diffraction. This revealed substantial recovery between 450 K - 800 K.
Irradiation with 20 MeV Fe-ions to $\sim$ 0.1 dpa caused a 20% reduction in
dislocation density compared to the as-deformed material. However, HPT
deformation prior to irradiation did not have a significant effect in
mitigating the irradiation-induced reductions in thermal diffusivity and
surface acoustic wave velocity of the material. These results provide a
multi-faceted understanding of the changes in ferritic/martensitic steels due
to severe plastic deformation, and how these changes can be used to alter
material properties.

<h3>Shaping electronic flows with strongly correlated physics</h3>

Nonequilibrium quantum transport is of central importance in nanotechnology.
Its description requires the understanding of strong electronic correlations,
which couple atomic-scale phenomena to the nanoscale. So far, research in
correlated transport focused predominantly on few-channel transport, precluding
the investigation of cross-scale effects. Recent theoretical advances enable
the solution of models that capture the interplay between quantum correlations
and confinement beyond a few channels. This problem is the focus of this study.
We consider an atomic impurity embedded in a metallic nanosheet spanning two
leads, showing that transport is significantly altered by tuning only the phase
of a single, local hopping parameter. Furthermore -- depending on this phase --
correlations reshape the electronic flow throughout the sheet, either funneling
it through the impurity or scattering it away from a much larger region. This
demonstrates the potential for quantum correlations to bridge length scales in
the design of nanoelectronic devices and sensors.

<h3>Electronic and optical properties of boron containing GaN alloys: The  role boron atom clustering</h3>

<br>
<br>
Boron (B) containing III-nitride materials, such as wurtzite (B,Ga)N alloys,
have recently attracted significant interest to tailor the electronic and
optical properties of optoelectronic devices operating in the visible and
ultraviolet spectral range. However, the growth of high quality samples is
challenging and B atom clustering is often observed in (B,Ga)N alloys. To date,
fundamental understanding of the impact of such clustering on electronic and
optical properties of these alloys is sparse. In this work we employ density
functional theory (DFT) in the framework of the meta generalized gradient
approximation (modified Becke Johnson (mBJ) functional) to provide insight into
this question. We use mBJ DFT calculations, benchmarked against
state-of-the-art hybrid functional DFT, on (B,Ga)N alloys in the experimentally
relevant B content range of up to 7.4%. Our results reveal that B atom
clustering can lead to a strong reduction in the bandgap of such an alloy, in
contrast to alloy configurations where B atoms are not forming clusters, thus
not sharing nitrogen (N) atoms. We find that the reduction in bandgap is linked
mainly to carrier localization effects in the valence band, which stem from
local strain and polarization field effects. However, our study also reveals
that the alloy microstructure of a B atom cluster plays an important role: B
atom chains along the wurtzite c-axis impact the electronic structure far less
strongly when compared to a chain formed within the c-plane. This effect is
again linked to local polarization field effects and the orbital character of
the involved valence states in wurtzite BN and GaN. Overall, our calculations
show that controlling the alloy microstructure of (B,Ga)N alloys is of central
importance when it comes to utilizing these systems in future optoelectronic
devices with improved efficiencies.

We theoretically investigate rapid adiabatic passage(RAP)-based
super-resolution imaging in a two-level quantum dot system interacting with two
structured beams. To understand the physical mechanism behind the formation of
super-resolution for the experiment of Kaldewey {\it et. al.,}[Nature Photonics
10.1038/s41566-017-0079-y (2018)], we first use Liouville's density matrix
where photon-mediated radiative and non-radiative decays are incorporated. A
suitably chosen spatiotemporal envelope of the structured beams enables the
formation of a super-resolution image. We also find that the feature size of
the image depends on the intensity of the Laguerre Gaussian beam(LG). However,
the created image resolution undergoes distortion due to the existence of a
low-intensity circular ring. The unwanted circular ring arises from the
dominance of the LG beam tail over the super-Gaussian(SG) beam tail, initiating
the residual population transfer from the ground state to the excited state.
This limitation can be overcome by using the Bessel-modulated truncated
structured LG and SG beams. We next study the dynamics of the semiconductor
quantum dot system at finite temperatures wherein the phonon interaction
becomes imperative. We employ the polaron-transformed master equation to
explore the system at higher temperatures. Our numerical results confirm that
the sharpness of the image remains intact at low temperatures with weak phonon
coupling. Hence, the proposed scheme may open up applications in nano-scale
imaging with quantum dots.

Finite-temperature structures of Cu, Ag, and Au metal nanoclusters are
calculated in the entire temperature range from 0 K to melting using a
computational methodology that we proposed recently [Settem \emph{et al.},
Nanoscale, 2022, 14, 939]. In this method, Harmonic Superposition Approximation
(HSA) and Parallel Tempering Molecular Dynamics (PTMD) are combined in a
complementary manner. HSA is accurate at low temperatures and fails at higher
temperatures. PTMD, on the other hand, effectively samples the high temperature
region and melting. This method is used to study the size- and system-dependent
competition between various structural motifs of Cu, Ag, and Au nanoclusters in
the size range 1 to 2 nm. Results show that there are mainly three types of
structural changes in metal nanoclusters depending on whether a solid-solid
transformation occurs. In the first type, global minimum is the dominant motif
in the entire temperature range. In contrast, when a solid-solid transformation
occurs, the global minimum transforms either completely to a different motif or
partially resulting in a co-existence of multiple motifs. Finally, nanocluster
structures are analyzed to highlight the system-specific differences across the
three metals.

Achieving superconductivity at room temperature can lead to substantially
advancements in industry and technology. Recently, a compound known as Cu-doped
lead-apatite Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O ($0.9 < x < 1.1$), referred to as
LK-99, has been reported to exhibit unusual electrical and magnetic behaviors
that appear to resemble a "superconducting transition" above room temperature.
We collected compound samples containing the nominal
Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O phase, which were synthesized by three
independent groups, and studied their chemical, magnetic, and electrical
properties at the microscale to overcome difficulties in bulk measurements.
Through the utilization of optical, scanning electron, atomic force, and
scanning diamond nitrogen-vacancy microscopy techniques, we are able to
establish a link between local magnetic properties and specific microscale
chemical phases. Our findings indicate that while the
Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O phase seems to have a mixed magnetism
contribution, a significant fraction of the diamagnetic response can be
attributed to Cu-rich regions (e.g., Cu$_2$S from chemical reaction).
Additionally, our micro-region electrical measurements reveal a phenomenon of
current path jumping and a change in resistance states of Cu$_2$S. This
provides a potential explanation for the electrical behavior observed in
compounds related to Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O.

The concept of the energy gap is a fundamental characteristic of the band
structure of a material and it determines its physical properties. Formally the
energy gap appears in the dispersion relation $E_k$, where the vector $k$ is
determined on the whole momentum space. However, today the {\it gapped momentum
materials} are in the focus of research in which the so-called {\it momentum or
$k$-gap} can emerge, i.e. some lacunae of momentum space are excluded from the
domain of the function $E_k$. One of such examples present the non-Hermitian
systems. Within the random phase approximation we study the dielectric
properties of the momentum gapped materials in one, two and three dimensions
for both cases of zero and finite temperatures. We find the corresponding
plasmon modes and determine the unusual behavior of the appropriate dispersion
relations for each dimensionality. Based on these findings we evaluate the
absorption coefficient of gapped momentum media and provide some numerical
estimations of its value for the practical applications.

Hydrogen diffusion in metals and alloys plays an important role in the
discovery of new materials for fuel cell and energy storage technology. While
analytic models use hand-selected features that have clear physical ties to
hydrogen diffusion, they often lack accuracy when making quantitative
predictions. Machine learning models are capable of making accurate
predictions, but their inner workings are obscured, rendering it unclear which
physical features are truly important. To develop interpretable machine
learning models to predict the activation energies of hydrogen diffusion in
metals and random binary alloys, we create a database for physical and chemical
properties of the species and use it to fit six machine learning models. Our
models achieve root-mean-squared-errors between 98-119 meV on the testing data
and accurately predict that elemental Ru has a large activation energy, while
elemental Cr and Fe have small activation energies.By analyzing the feature
importances of these fitted models, we identify relevant physical properties
for predicting hydrogen diffusivity. While metrics for measuring the individual
feature importances for machine learning models exist, correlations between the
features lead to disagreement between models and limit the conclusions that can
be drawn. Instead grouped feature importances, formed by combining the features
via their correlations, agree across the six models and reveal that the two
groups containing the packing factor and electronic specific heat are
particularly significant for predicting hydrogen diffusion in metals and random
binary alloys. This framework allows us to interpret machine learning models
and enables rapid screening of new materials with the desired rates of hydrogen
diffusion.

Fractional diffusion and Fokker-Planck equations are widely used tools to
describe anomalous diffusion in a large variety of complex systems. The
equivalent formulations in terms of Caputo or Riemann-Liouville fractional
derivatives can be derived as continuum limits of continuous time random walks
and are associated with the Mittag-Leffler relaxation of Fourier modes,
interpolating between a short-time stretched exponential and a long-time
inverse power-law scaling. More recently, a number of other
integro-differential operators have been proposed, including the
Caputo-Fabrizio and Atangana-Baleanu forms. Moreover, the conformable
derivative has been introduced. We here study the dynamics of the associated
generalized Fokker-Planck equations from the perspective of the moments, the
time averaged mean squared displacements, and the autocovariance functions. We
also study generalized Langevin equations based on these generalized operators.
The differences between the Fokker-Planck and Langevin equations with different
integro-differential operators are discussed and compared with the dynamic
behavior of established models of scaled Brownian motion and fractional
Brownian motion. We demonstrate that the integro-differential operators with
exponential and Mittag-Leffler kernels are not suitable to be introduced to
Fokker-Planck and Langevin equations for the physically relevant diffusion
scenarios discussed in our paper. The conformable and Caputo Langevin equations
are unveiled to share similar properties with scaled and fractional Brownian
motion, respectively.

Weyl points are three-dimensional linear points between bands that exhibit
unique stability to perturbations and are accompanied by topologically
non-trivial surface states. However, the discovery and control of Weyl points
in nature poses significant challenges. While recent advances have allowed for
engineering Weyl points in photonic crystals and metamaterials, the topological
transition between Weyl semimetals with distinct types of Weyl points remains
yet to be reported. Here, exploiting the flexible measurement-feedback control
of synthetic mechanical systems, we experimentally simulate Weyl semimetals and
observe for the first time the transition between states with type-I and
type-II Weyl points. We directly observe the change in the band structures
accompanying the transition and identify the Fermi arc surface states
connecting the Weyl points. Further, making use of the non-reciprocal feedback
control, we demonstrate that the introduction of non-Hermiticity significantly
impacts the topological transition point, as well as the edge localization of
the Fermi arc surface states. Our findings offer valuable insights into the
design and realization of Weyl points in mechanical systems, providing a
promising avenue for exploring novel topological phenomena in non-Hermitian
physics.

Antiperovskites are a rich family of compounds with applications in battery
cathodes, superconductors, solid-state lighting, and catalysis. Recently, a
novel series of antimonide phosphide antiperovskites (A$_3$SbP, where A = Ca,
Sr, Ba) were proposed as candidate photovoltaic absorbers due to their ideal
band gaps, small effective masses and strong optical absorption. In this work,
we explore this series of compounds in more detail using relativistic hybrid
density functional theory. We reveal that the proposed cubic structures are
dynamically unstable and instead identify a tilted orthorhombic Pnma phase as
the ground state. Tilting is shown to induce charge localisation that widens
the band gap and increases the effective masses. Despite this, we demonstrate
that the predicted maximum photovoltaic efficiencies remain high (24-31% for
200 nm thin films) by bringing the band gaps into the ideal range for a solar
absorber. Finally, we assess the band alignment of the series and suggest hole
and electron contact materials for efficient photovoltaic devices.

discretizes their motional state. This fundamental effect is observed in many
physical systems, ranging from electrons confined in atoms or quantum dots to
ultracold atoms trapped in optical tweezers. In solid-state photonics, a
long-standing goal has been to achieve fully tunable quantum confinement of
optically active electron-hole pairs known as excitons. To confine excitons,
existing approaches mainly rely on material modulation, which suffers from poor
control over the energy and position of trapping potentials. This has severely
impeded the engineering of large-scale quantum photonic systems. In this
doctoral thesis, we demonstrate electrically controlled quantum confinement of
neutral excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors. By combining gate-defined
in-plane electric fields with inherent interactions between excitons and free
charges in a lateral p-i-n junction, we achieve tunable exciton confinement
lengths reaching values below 10 nm. Quantization of excitonic motion manifests
in the measured optical response as a ladder of discrete voltage-dependent
states below the continuum. Moreover, we observe that our confining potentials
lead to a strong modification of the relative wave function of excitons. We
further highlight the versatility of our approach by extending our confinement
scheme to create quantum-dot-like zero-dimensional structures with a fully
tunable confinement length. Our technique provides an experimental route
towards achieving polariton blockade and creating scalable arrays of identical
single-photon sources, which has wide-ranging implications for realizing
strongly correlated photonic phases and on-chip optical quantum information
processors.

Recently, gate-defined Josephson junctions based on magic-angle twisted
bilayer graphene (MATBG) have been fabricated. In such a junction, local
electrostatic gating can create two superconducting regions connected by an
interaction-driven valley-polarized state as the weak link. Due to the
spontaneous time-reversal and inversion symmetry breaking of the
valley-polarized state, novel phenomena such as the Josephson diode effect have
been observed without applying external fields. Importantly, when the so-called
nonreciprocity efficiency (which measures the sign and strength of the
Josephson effect) changes sign, the energy-phase relation of the junction is
approximate $F(\phi) \approx \cos(2\phi)$ where $F$ is the free energy and
$\phi$ is the phase difference of the two superconductors. In this work, we
show that such a MATBG-based Josephson junction, when shunted by a capacitor,
can be used to realize the long-sought-after $0$-$\pi$ qubits which are
protected from local perturbation-induced decoherence. Interestingly, by
changing the junction parameters, transmon-like qubits with large anharmonicity
can also be realized. In short, by utilizing the novel interaction-driven
valley-polarized state in MATBG, a single gate-defined Josephson junction can
be used to replace complicated superconducting circuits for realizing qubits
that are protected from local perturbations.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is an essential technique to determine a material's
crystal structure in high-throughput experimentation, and has recently been
incorporated in artificially intelligent agents in autonomous scientific
discovery processes. However, rapid, automated and reliable analysis method of
XRD data matching the incoming data rate remains a major challenge. To address
these issues, we present CrystalShift, an efficient algorithm for probabilistic
XRD phase labeling that employs symmetry-constrained pseudo-refinement
optimization, best-first tree search, and Bayesian model comparison to estimate
probabilities for phase combinations without requiring phase space information
or training. We demonstrate that CrystalShift provides robust probability
estimates, outperforming existing methods on synthetic and experimental
datasets, and can be readily integrated into high-throughput experimental
workflows. In addition to efficient phase-mapping, CrystalShift offers
quantitative insights into materials' structural parameters, which facilitate
both expert evaluation and AI-based modeling of the phase space, ultimately
accelerating materials identification and discovery.

<h3>Thermoelectric response across the semiconductor-semimetal transition in  black phosphorus</h3>

In spite of intensive studies on thermoelectricity in metals, little is known
about thermoelectric response in semiconductors at low temperature. An even
more fascinating and unanswered question is what happens to the Seebeck
coefficient when the semiconductor turns to a metal. By precisely tuning the
ground state of black phosphorus with pressure from the semiconducting to
semimetallic state, we track a systematic evolution of the Seebeck coefficient.
Thanks to a manifest correlation between the Seebeck coefficient and
resistivity, the Seebeck response in each conduction regime, i.e., intrinsic,
saturation, extrinsic, and variable range hopping (VRH) regimes, is identified.
In the former two regimes, the Seebeck coefficient behaves in accordance with
the present theories, whereas in the later two regimes available theories do
not give a satisfactory account for its response. However, by eliminating the
extrinsic sample dependence in the resistivity $\rho$ and Seebeck coefficient
$S$, the Peltier conductivity $\alpha=S/\rho$ allows to unveil the intrinsic
thermoelectric response, revealing vanishing fate for $\alpha$ in the VRH
regime. The emerged ionized impurity scattering on entry to the semimetallic
state is easily surpassed by electron-electron scattering due to squeezing of
screening length accompanied by an increase of carrier density with pressure.
In the low temperature limit, a small number of carriers enhances a prefactor
of $T$-linear Seebeck coefficient as large as what is observed in prototypical
semimetals. A crucial but largely ignored role of carrier scattering in
determining the magnitude and sign of the Seebeck coefficient is indicated by
the observation that a sign reversal of the $T$-linear prefactor is concomitant
with a change in dominant scattering mechanism for carriers.

<h3>Modulating thermoelectric properties in oxygen-passivated Sb2Te3 thin  film through grain boundary engineering</h3>

The present study demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating oxygen
atoms into the Sb2Te3 thin film, leading to an improved power factor and
reduction in thermal conductivity. Based on the experimental evidence, it can
be inferred that oxygen-related impurities preferentially wet the grain
boundary (GB) and introduce a double Schottky barrier at the GB interface,
promoting energy-dependent carrier scattering, ultimately leading to a rise in
the Seebeck coefficient. Additionally, the introduction of chemisorbed oxygen
creates a high mobility state within the valence band of Sb2Te3, as
corroborated by theoretical calculations, resulting in a significantly
increased electrical mobility. These factors collectively contribute to
improved thermoelectric performance. A set of Scanning probe (SPM) techniques
is used to experimentally confirm the alteration in charge transport resulting
from the oxygen-passivated grain boundary. Additionally, Scanning Thermal
Microscopy (SThM) is employed to observe the spatial variations of thermal
conductivity at the nanoscale regime. This study presents a comprehensive
microscopic investigation of the impact of oxygen on the phonon and charge
carrier transport characteristics of Sb2Te3 thermoelectric materials and
indicates that incorporating oxygen may represent a feasible approach to
improve the thermoelectric efficiency of these materials.

Here we introduce a variation of the trap model of glasses based on softness,
a local structural variable identified by machine learning, in supercooled
liquids. Softness is a particle-based quantity that reflects the local
structural environment of a particle and characterizes the energy barrier for
the particle to rearrange. As in the trap model, we treat each particle's
softness, and hence energy barrier, as evolving independently. We show that
such a model reproduces many qualitative features of softness, and therefore
makes qualitatively reasonable predictions of behaviors such as the dependence
of fragility on density in a model supercooled liquid. We also show failures of
this simple model, indicating features of the dynamics of softness that may
only be explained by correlations.
