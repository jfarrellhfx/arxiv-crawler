<h3>Solution of master equations by fermionic-duality: Time-dependent charge  and heat currents through an interacting quantum dot proximized by a  superconductor</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04973" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04973</a>
<br>
<i>Lara C. Ortmanns, Maarten R. Wegewijs, Janine Splettstoesser</i>
<br>
We analyze the time-dependent solution of master equations by exploiting
fermionic duality, a dissipative symmetry applicable to a large class of open
systems describing quantum transport. Whereas previous studies mostly exploited
duality relations after partially solving the evolution equations, we here
systematically exploit the invariance under the fermionic duality mapping from
the very beginning when setting up these equations. Moreover, we extend the
resulting simplifications -- so far applied to the local state evolution- to
non-local observables such as transport currents. We showcase the exploitation
of fermionic duality for a quantum dot with strong interaction -- covering both
the repulsive and attractive case -- proximized by contact with a large-gap
superconductor which is weakly probed by charge and heat currents into a
wide-band normal-metal electrode. We derive the complete time-dependent
analytical solution of this problem involving non-equilibrium Cooper pair
transport, Andreev bound states and strong interaction. Additionally exploiting
detailed balance we show that even for this relatively complex problem the
evolution towards the stationary state can be understood analytically in terms
of the stationary state of the system itself via its relation to the stationary
state of a dual system with inverted Coulomb interaction, superconducting
pairing and applied voltages.

<h3>Cathodoluminescence monitoring of quantum emitter activation in  hexagonal boron nitride</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05028" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05028</a>
<br>
<i>SÃ©bastien Roux, Clarisse Fournier, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jean-Pierre Hermier, Julien Barjon, Aymeric Delteil</i>
<br>
The ability to locally activate or generate quantum emitters in
two-dimensional materials is of major interest for the realization of
integrated quantum photonic devices. In particular, hexagonal boron nitride
(hBN) has recently been shown to allow a variety of techniques for obtaining
quantum emitters at desired locations. Here, we use cathodoluminescence (CL) to
monitor in situ the local activation of color centers by an electron beam in
hBN. We observe that the CL signal saturates at a given surface dose,
independently of the electron current density. Based on photoluminescence and
photon correlations, we show that the number of photoactive color centers is
proportional to the CL signal, and we estimate the maximum density of quantum
emitters that can be generated by our technique. Our results provide insights
about the activation mechanism and could help to optimize the controlled
generation of single photon sources in hexagonal boron nitride.

<h3>Dynamical fluctuations of a tracer coupled to active and passive  particles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05139" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05139</a>
<br>
<i>Ion Santra</i>
<br>
We study the induced dynamics of an inertial tracer particle elastically
coupled to passive or active Brownian particles. We integrate out the
environment degrees of freedom to obtain generalized Langevin equation for the
tracer dynamics in both cases. In particular, we find the exact form of the
dissipation kernel and effective noise experienced by the tracer and compare it
with the phenomenological modeling of active baths used in previous studies. We
show that the second fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) does not hold at
early times for both cases. However, at finite times, the tracer dynamics
violate (obeys) the FDR for the active (passive) environment. We calculate the
linear response formulas in this regime for both cases and show that the
passive medium satisfies an equilibrium fluctuation response relation (FRR),
while the active medium does not -- we quantify the extent of this violation
explicitly. We show that though the active medium generally renders a
nonequilibrium description of the tracer, an effective equilibrium picture
emerges asymptotically in the small activity limit of the medium. We also
calculate the mean squared velocity and mean squared displacement of the tracer
and report how they vary with time.

<h3>Classical Nucleation Theory for Active Fluid Phase Separation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05263" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05263</a>
<br>
<i>M.E. Cates, C. Nardini</i>
<br>
Classical nucleation theory (CNT), linking rare nucleation events to the free
energy landscape of a growing nucleus, is central to understanding phase-change
kinetics in passive fluids. Nucleation in non-equilibrium systems is much
harder to describe because there is no free energy, but instead a
dynamics-dependent quasi-potential that typically must be found numerically.
Here we extend CNT to a class of active phase separating systems governed by a
minimal field-theoretic model (Active Model B+). In the small noise and
supersaturation limits that CNT assumes, we compute analytically the
quasi-potential, and hence nucleation barrier, for liquid-vapor phase
separation. Crucially to our results, detailed balance, although broken
microscopically by activity, is restored along the instanton trajectory, which
in CNT involves the nuclear radius as the sole reaction coordinate.

<h3>Versatile strain relief pathways in epitaxial films of (001)-oriented  PbSe on III-V substrates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05303" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05303</a>
<br>
<i>Brian B. Haidet, Jarod Meyer, Pooja Reddy, Eamonn T. Hughes, Kunal Mukherjee</i>
<br>
PbSe and related IV-VI rocksalt-structure semiconductors have important
electronic properties that may be controlled by epitaxial strain and
interfaces, thus harnessed in an emerging class of IV-VI/III-V
heterostructures. The synthesis of such heterostructures and understanding
mechanisms for strain-relief is central to achieving this goal. We show that a
range of interfacial defects mediate lattice mismatch in (001)-oriented
epitaxial thin films of PbSe with III-V templates of GaAs, InAs, and GaSb.
While the primary slip system {100}<110> for dislocation glide in PbSe is
well-studied for its facile glide properties, it is inactive in (001)-oriented
films used in our work. Yet, we obtain nearly relaxed PbSe films in the three
heteroepitaxial systems studied with interfaces ranging from incoherent without
localized misfit dislocations on 8.3% mismatched GaAs, a mixture of
semi-coherent and incoherent patches on 1.5% mismatched InAs, to nearly
coherent on 0.8% mismatched GaSb. The semi-coherent portions of the interfaces
to InAs form by 60{\deg} misfit dislocations gliding on higher order {111}<110>
slip systems. On the more closely lattice-matched GaSb, arrays of 90{\deg}
(edge) misfit dislocations form via a climb process. The diversity of
strain-relaxation mechanisms accessible to PbSe makes it a rich system for
heteroepitaxial integration with III-V substrates.

<h3>Three-state Potts nematic order in stacked frustrated spin models with  SO(3) symmetry</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04900" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04900</a>
<br>
<i>Ana-Marija NediÄ, Victor L. Quito, Yuriy Sizyuk, Peter P. Orth</i>
<br>
We propose stacked two-dimensional lattice designs of frustrated and SO(3)
symmetric spin models consisting of antiferromagnetic (AF) triangular and
ferromagnetic (FM) sixfold symmetric sublattices that realize emergent Z3 Potts
nematic order. Considering bilinear-biquadratic spin interactions, our models
describe an SO(3)-symmetric triangular lattice AF subject to a fluctuating
magnetization arising from the FM coupled sublattice. We focus on the classical
AFM-FM windmill model and map out the zero- and finite-temperature phase
diagram using Monte Carlo simulations and analytical calculations. We discover
a state with composite Potts nematic order above the ferrimagnetic
three-sublattice up-up-down ground state and relate it to Potts phases in
SO(3)-broken Heisenberg and Ising AFMs in external magnetic fields. Finally, we
show that the biquadratic exchange in our model is automatically induced by
thermal and quantum fluctuations in the purely bilinear Heisenberg model,
easing the requirements for realizing these lattice designs experimentally.

<h3>Majorana Modes of Giant Vortices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04908" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04908</a>
<br>
<i>Logan Gates, Alexander A. Penin</i>
<br>
We study Majorana zero modes bound to giant vortices in topological
superconductors or topological insulator/normal superconductor
heterostructures. By expanding in inverse powers of a large winding number $n$,
we find an analytic solution for asymptotically all $n$ zero modes required by
the index theorem. Contrary to the existing estimates, the solution is not
pinned to the vortex boundary and is composed of the warped lowest Landau level
states. While the dynamics which shapes the zero modes is a subtle interference
of the magnetic effects and Andreev reflection, the solution is very robust and
is determined by a single parameter, the vortex radius. The resulting local
density of states has a number of features which give remarkable signatures for
an experimental observation of the Majorana fermions in two dimensions.

<h3>Continuous transition from a Landau quasiparticle to a neutral spinon</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04918" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04918</a>
<br>
<i>Jing-Yu Zhao, Shuai A. Chen, Rong-Yang Sun, Zheng-Yu Weng</i>
<br>
We examine a wavefunction ansatz in which a doped hole can experience a
quantum transition from a charge $+e$ Landau quasiparticle to a neutral spinon
as a function of the underlying spin-spin correlation. As shown variationally,
such a wavefunction accurately captures all the essential features revealed by
exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group simulations in a
two-leg $t$-$J$ ladder. Hence its analytic form can provide an explicit
understanding of the mechanism for the unconventional ground state. The
transition in the phase diagram is accompanied by a change of the hole
composite from a tight charge-spin binding to a loosely-bound hole-spin pair.
In the latter, the hole carries a finite spin current but with vanishing charge
current in the degenerate ground states. We show that the charge of the hole
composite here is dynamically diminished due to an internal relative hole-spin
motion, which is fundamentally distinct from a simple charge-spin separation in
a one-dimensional case. We further show that the same novel effect is also
responsible for a strong pairing between two doped holes in such a non-Landau
quasiparticle regime.

<h3>Possible restoration of particle-hole symmetry in the 5/2 Quantized Hall  State at small magnetic field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04925" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04925</a>
<br>
<i>LoÃ¯c Herviou, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Mila</i>
<br>
Motivated by the experimental observation of a quantized 5/2 thermal
conductance at filling $\nu=5/2$, a result incompatible with both the Pfaffian
and the Antipfaffian states, we have pushed the expansion of the effective
Hamiltonian of the $5/2$ quantized Hall state to third-order in the parameter
$\kappa=E_c/\hbar \omega_c$ controlling the Landau level mixing , where $E_c$
is the Coulomb energy and $\omega_c\propto 1/B$ the cyclotron frequency. Exact
diagonalizations of this effective Hamiltonian show that the difference in
overlap with the Pfaffian and the AntiPfaffian induced at second-order is
reduced by third-order corrections and disappears around $\kappa=0.4$,
suggesting that these states are much closer in energy at smaller magnetic
field than previously anticipated. Furthermore, we show that in this range of
$\kappa$ the finite-size spectrum is typical of a quantum phase transition,
with a strong reduction of the energy gap and with level crossings between
excited states. These results point to the possibility of a quantum phase
transition at smaller magnetic field into a phase with an emergent
particle-hole symmetry that would explain the measured $5/2$ thermal
conductance of the $5/2$ quantized Hall state.

<h3>Complete field-induced spectral response of the spin-1/2  triangular-lattice antiferromagnet CsYbSe$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04928" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04928</a>

<br>
Fifty years after Anderson's proposal of the resonating valence-bond state,
the spin-1/2 triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet (TLHAF) remains
perhaps the ultimate platform to explore highly entangled quantum spin states
in proximity to magnetic order. Yb-based delafossites are ideal candidate TLHAF
materials, displaying strong two-dimensionality, pseudospin-1/2 nature and no
structural disorder. We report a systematic neutron scattering study of
CsYbSe$_2$ over the full range of applied in-plane magnetic fields up to
saturation. Above saturation we establish the exact Heisenberg character of the
interactions and a weak second-neighbour coupling, $J_2/J_1 \simeq 0.03$. As
the field drives the system from the 120$^{\circ}$-ordered state through the
up-up-down phase around 1/3-magnetization and towards full polarization, the
corresponding excitation spectra evolve from continuum-like to relatively sharp
spin-wave modes in the up-up-down phase, then back to continua and back to spin
waves. We perform cylinder MPS calculations based on the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg
model that reproduce the experimental spectra with semi-quantitative accuracy,
suggesting an interpretation of the extensive continuum features in terms of
multi-magnon states. Thus our comprehensive experimental and theoretical
analysis of the unconventional field-induced spin excitations in the TLHAF
provides valuable insight into the dynamics of a broad class of quantum
many-body systems.

<h3>$\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion in the double charge-Kondo model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04937" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04937</a>
<br>
<i>D. B. Karki, Edouard Boulat, Winston Pouse, David Goldhaber-Gordon, Andrew K. Mitchell, Christophe Mora</i>
<br>
Quantum impurity models with frustrated Kondo interactions can support
quantum critical points with fractionalized excitations. Recent experiments
[arXiv:2108.12691] on a circuit containing two coupled metal-semiconductor
islands exhibit transport signatures of such a critical point. Here we show
using bosonization that the double charge-Kondo model describing the device can
be mapped in the Toulouse limit to a sine-Gordon model. Its Bethe-ansatz
solution shows that a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion emerges at the critical point,
characterized by a fractional $\tfrac{1}{2}\ln(3)$ residual entropy, and
scattering fractional charges $e/3$. We also present full numerical
renormalization group calculations for the model and show that the predicted
behavior of conductance is consistent with experimental results.

<h3>Inverse thermodynamic uncertainty relations: general upper bounds on the  fluctuations of trajectory observables</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04983" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04983</a>
<br>
<i>George Bakewell-Smith, Federico Girotti, MÄdÄlin GuÅ£Ä, Juan P. Garrahan</i>
<br>
Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) are general lower bounds on the
size of fluctutations of dynamical observables. They have important
consequences, one being that the precision of estimation of a current is
limited by the amount of entropy production. Here we prove the existence of
general upper bounds on the size of fluctuations of any linear combination of
fluxes (including all time-integrated currents or dynamical activities) for
continuous-time Markov chains. We obtain these general relations by means of
concentration bound techniques. These ``inverse TURs'' are valid for all times
and not only in the long time limit. We illustrate our analytical results with
a simple model, and discuss wider implications of these new relations.

<h3>Light emission in delta-T-driven mesoscopic conductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04984" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04984</a>
<br>
<i>Matthias HÃ¼bler, Wolfgang Belzig</i>
<br>
The scattering picture of electron transport in mesoscopic conductors shows
that fluctuations of the current reveal additional information on the
scattering mechanism not available through the conductance alone. The
electronic fluctuations are coupled to the electromagnetic field and a junction
at finite bias or temperature will emit radiation. The nonsymmetrized
current-current correlators characterize the emission and absorption spectrum.
Recent interest is focused on the so-called delta-T noise, which is the
nonequilibrium noise caused by a temperature difference between the terminals.
Here, we generalize the notion of delta-T noise to the nonsymmetrized
current-current correlator at finite frequencies. We investigate the spectral
density for energy-independent scattering and for a resonant level as an
example of energy-dependent scattering. We find that a temperature difference
$\Delta T$ leads to a partial reduction of the noise for certain frequency
ranges. This is a consequence of temperature broadening in combination with a
frequency shift of the involved Fermi distributions. In the case of
energy-independent scattering, the lowest order is a quadratic $\propto (\Delta
T)^2$ correction of the thermal-like noise spectrum. For the resonance,
additional contributions to the delta-T noise spectrum arise that are $\propto
\Delta T$ to the lowest order.

<h3>Microstructure of a heavily irradiated metal exposed to a spectrum of  atomic recoils</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05010" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05010</a>
<br>
<i>Max Boleininger, Daniel R. Mason, Andrea E. Sand, Sergei L. Dudarev</i>
<br>
At temperatures below the onset of vacancy migration, metals exposed to
energetic ions develop dynamically fluctuating steady-state microstructures.
Statistical properties of these microstructures in the asymptotic high exposure
limit are not universal and vary depending on the energy and mass of the
incident ions. We develop a model for the microstructure of an ion-irradiated
metal under athermal conditions, where internal stress fluctuations dominate
the kinetics of structural evolution. The balance between defect production and
recombination depends sensitively not only on the total exposure to
irradiation, defined by the dose, but also on the energy of the incident
particles. The model predicts the defect content in the high dose limit as an
integral of the spectrum of primary knock-on atom energies, with the finding
that low energy ions produce a significantly higher amount of damage than high
energy ions.

We investigate the topological phases of two one-dimensional (1D) interacting
superconducting wires, and propose topological invariants directly measurable
from ground state correlation functions. These numbers remain powerful tools in
the presence of couplings and interactions. We show with the density matrix
renormalization group that the double critical Ising (DCI) phase discovered in
[1] is a fractional topological phase with gapless Majorana modes in the bulk
and a one-half topological invariant per wire. Using both numerics and quantum
field theoretical methods we show that the phase diagram remains stable in the
presence of an inter-wire hopping amplitude $t_{\bot}$ at length scales below
$\sim 1/t_{\bot}$. A large inter-wire hopping amplitude results in the
emergence of two integer topological phases hosting one edge mode per boundary,
shared between both wires. At large interactions the two wires are described by
Mott physics, with the $t_{\bot}$ hopping amplitude resulting in a paramagnetic
order.

<br>
In 1911, J\"uttner proposed the generalization, for a relativistic gas, of
the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of velocities. Here we want to discuss,
among others, J\"uttner probability density function (PDF). Both the velocity
space and, consequently, the momentum space are not flat in special relativity.
The velocity space corresponds to the Lobachevsky one, which has a negative
curvature. This curvature induces a specific power for the Lorentz factor in
the PDF, affecting J\"uttner normalization constant in one, two, and three
dimensions. Furthermore, J\"uttner distribution, written in terms of a more
convenient variable, the rapidity, presents a curvature change at the origin at
sufficiently high energy, which does not agree with our computational dynamics
simulations of a relativistic gas. However, in one dimension, the rapidity
satisfies a simple additivity law. This allows us to obtain, through the
Central Limit Theorem, a new, Lorentz-invariant, PDF whose curvature at the
origin does not change for any energy value and which agrees with our
computational dynamics simulations data. Also, we perform extensive
first-principle simulations of a one-dimensional relativistic gas constituted
by light and heavy particles.

<h3>Carrier thermalization and zero-point bandgap renormalization in halide  perovskites from the Urbach tails of the emission spectrum</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05041" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05041</a>
<br>
<i>Kingshuk Mukhuti, Arnab Mandal, Basabendra Roy, Sayan Bhattacharyya, Bhavtosh Bansal</i>
<br>
We develop techniques to study the temperature dependent localization,
thermalization, and the effects of phonon scattering on the excitons in halide
perovskites from the analysis of the emission spectra. The excitonic Urbach
edge, when inferred from the low energy tails of the temperature dependent
luminescence spectra, is shown to be sensitive to the electron distribution and
thermalization. A method to observe the Urbach focus is devised for halide
perovskites where the temperature dependence of the excitonic gap is anomalous.
The value of the zero-point bandgap renormalization is inferred to be about 33
meV. This small value of the bandgap renormalization rules out the formation of
small polarons and points to weak electron-phonon coupling. The experiments are
performed on the nanosheets of the archetypal halide perovskite, CsPbBr$_3$.

<br>
The ambient-pressure dynamic stability of XB3C3 (X = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba)
compounds in the bipartite sodalite clathrate structure, one of which has been
recently synthesized, is linked to the chemical pressure exerted by the metal
cation, whose size can be tuned to stabilize the B-C framework. High-throughput
density functional theory calculations on 105 analogous Pm-3 symmetry XYB6C6
binary-guest compounds find 22 that are dynamically stable at 1 atmosphere,
expanding the number of potentially synthesizable phases by 19 (18 metals and 1
insulator). The density of states at the Fermi level and concomitant
superconducting critical temperature, Tc, can be tuned by changing the average
oxidation state of the metal atoms, with Tc being highest for an average
valence of +1.5. KPbB6C6, with an ambient-pressure Eliashberg Tc of 88 K, is
predicted to be the highest-Tc compound. Density functional theory calculations
suggest KPbB6C6 may be synthesized using high-pressure high-temperature
techniques and quenched to ambient conditions.

<br>
Amorphous carbon nanotubes (a-CNT) with up to four walls and sizes ranging
from 200 to 3200 atoms have been simulated, starting from initial random
configurations and using the Gaussian Approximation Potential [Phys. Rev. B 95,
094203 (2017)]. The important variables (like density, height, and diameter)
required to simulate a-CNTs successfully, were predicted by implementing the
machine learning random forest technique. The models were validated \textit{ex
post facto} using density functional codes. The a-CNT models ranged from 0.55
nm - 2 nm wide with an average inter-wall spacing of 0.31 nm. The topological
defects in a-CNTs were discussed and for the first time, new defect
configurations were observed. The electronic density of states and localization
in these phases were discussed and the delocalized electrons in the $\pi$
subspace were identified as an important factor for inter-layer cohesion.
Spatial projection of the electronic conductivity favors axial transport along
connecting hexagons, while non-hexagonal parts of the network either hinder or
bifurcate the electronic transport. A vibrational density of states was
calculated and is potentially an experimentally testable fingerprint of the
material and the appearance of a low-frequency radial breathing mode was
discussed. The thermal conductivity at 300 K was also calculated using the
Green-Kubo formula.

<h3>Multiple Topological Magnetism in van der Waals Heterostructure of  MnTe2/ZrS2</h3>

<br>
Topological magnetism in low-dimensional systems is of fundamental and
practical importance in condensed-matter physics and material science. Here,
using first-principles and Monte-Carlo simulations, we present that multiple
topological magnetism (i.e., skyrmion and bimeron) can survive in van der Waals
Heterostructure of MnTe2ZrS2. Arising from interlayer coupling, MnTe2ZrS2 can
harbor a large Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This, combined with
ferromagnetic exchange interaction, yields an intriguing skyrmion phase
consisting of sub-10 nm magnetic skyrmions under a tiny magnetic field of 75
mT. Meanwhile, upon harnessing a small electric field, magnetic bimeron can be
observed in MnTe2ZrS2 as well, suggesting the existence of multiple topological
magnetism. Through interlayer sliding, both topological spin textures can be
switched on-off, suggesting their stacking-dependent character. In addition,
the impacts of d and Keff on these spin textures are revealed, and a
dimensionless parameter is utilized to describe their joint effect. These
explored phenomena and insights not only are useful for fundamental research in
topological magnetism, but also enable novel applications in nanodevices.

<br>
The effects of doping on the electronic evolution of the Mott insulating
state have been extensively studied in efforts to understand mechanisms of
emergent quantum phases of materials. Here, we present a comprehensive study of
the effect of charge doping in the double perovskite Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$, a Mott
insulator with both strong electron correlations and SOC, utilizing muon spin
relaxation ($\mu$SR), magnetization, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
measurements. We establish that the insulating magnetic ground state evolves
from canted antiferromagnet (AF) to N\'eel order for dopant levels exceeding
$\approx 10 \%$, indicating the enhancement of electron-electron correlations
with doping. Furthermore, we determine that a broken local point symmetry
(BLPS) phase, precursor to the magnetically ordered state, occupies an extended
portion of the ($H{-}T$) phase diagram with increased doping. This finding
reveals that the breaking of the local cubic symmetry is driven by a multipolar
order, most-likely of the antiferro-quadrupolar type.

<br>
We report on the temperature evolution of the polarization-dependent Raman
spectrum of exfoliated MoI$_3$, a van der Waals material with a "true
one-dimensional" crystal structure that can be exfoliated to individual atomic
chains. The temperature evolution of several Raman features reveals anomalous
behavior suggesting a phase transition of a magnetic origin. Theoretical
considerations indicate that MoI$_3$ is an easy-plane antiferromagnet with
alternating spins along the dimerized chains and with inter-chain helical spin
ordering. The calculated frequencies of the phonons and magnons are consistent
with the interpretation of the experimental Raman data. The obtained results
shed light on the specifics of the phononic and magnonic states in MoI$_3$ and
provide a strong motivation for future study of this unique material with
potential for spintronic device applications.

<h3>Criterions of Phase Transitions in Dispersed Multiphase Systems Based on  an Extended Lattice Model</h3>

<i>Yiran Li, Yunfan Huang, Xukang Lu, Moran Wang</i>
<br>
Agglomeration, adsorption, and extraction in dispersed multiphase systems are
ubiquitously encountered in biological systems, energy industry, and medical
science. In this work, a novel lattice model is extended to the three-component
complex systems and criterions based on the determinant \Delta_i=F_i-K_c,i are
accordingly proposed to predict the aforementioned behaviors based on a
Helmholtz free energy formulation. Here, three characteristic factors F_i's are
introduced to describe the internal energy effect, i.e.,F_1=A^11+A^22-2A^12
(agglomeration), F_2=A^22+A^13-A^12-A^23 (adsorption) and
F_3=A^22+2A^13-A^33-2A^12 (extraction), where A_ij denotes the conservative
potential coefficient between liquid particles in phase i and j, while the
entropy factors K_c,i's in the determinants depend on the local structure of
the liquid. To verify the theoretical criterions, many-body dissipative
particle dynamics (mDPD) are employed to simulate the phase transition
phenomena in various many-body dissipative systems, including agglomeration in
a binary system, adsorption on solid surfaces from the liquid phase, and
extraction-adsorption around an immiscible liquid-liquid interface. The
simulation results show the notable dependence of the dispersed phase
distribution transition on the quasi-order parameters \Delta_i's, which
indicates the great potential of our model to analyzing various dispersed
multiphase systems. The criterions are expected to be extended to study the
structure effect induced by the temperature and dispersed particle shape on the
phase transition phenomena in those complex systems.

<h3>New Gd-based magnetic compound GdPt$_2$B with a chiral crystal structure</h3>

<br>
Herein, we report the discovery of a novel Gd-based magnetic compound
GdPt$_2$B with a chiral crystal structure. X-ray diffraction and chemical
composition analyses reveal a CePt$_2$B-type crystal structure (space group:
$P6_422$) for GdPt$_2$B. Moreover, we successfully grew single crystals of
GdPt$_2$B using the Czochralski method. Magnetization measurements and the
Curie$-$Weiss analysis demonstrate that the ferromagnetic interaction is
dominant in GdPt$_2$B. A clear transition is observed in the temperature
dependence of electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific
heat at $T_{\rm O}$ = 87 K. The magnetic phase diagram of GdPt$_2$B, which
consists of a field-polarized ferromagnetic region and a magnetically ordered
region, resembles those of known chiral helimagnets. Furthermore, magnetic
susceptibility measurements reveal a possible spin reorientation within the
magnetically ordered phase in magnetic fields perpendicular to the screw axis.
The results demonstrate that GdPt$_2$B is a suitable platform for investigating
the competing effects of ferromagnetic and antisymmetric exchange interactions
in rare-earth-based chiral compounds.

<h3>Polar Metals Taxonomy for Materials Classification and Discovery</h3>

<br>
Over the past decade, materials that combine broken inversion symmetry with
metallic conductivity have gone from a thought experiment to one of the fastest
growing research topics. In 2013, the observation of the first uncontested
polar transition in a metal, LiOsO$_3$, inspired a surge of theoretical and
experimental work on the subject, uncovering a host of materials which combine
properties previously thought to be contraindicated [Nat. Mater. \textbf{12},
1024 (2013)]. As is often the case in a nascent field, the sudden rise in
interest has been accompanied by diverse (and sometimes conflicting)
terminology. Although ``ferroelectric-like" metals are well-defined in theory,
i.e., materials that undergo a symmetry-lowering transition to a polar phase
while exhibiting metallic electron transport, real materials find a myriad of
ways to push the boundaries of this definition. Here, we review and explore the
burgeoning polar metal frontier from the perspectives of theory, simulation,
and experiment while introducing a unified taxonomy. The framework allows one
to describe, identify, and classify polar metals; we also use it to discuss
some of the fundamental tensions between theory and models of reality inherent
in the terms ``ferroelectric" and ``metals.'' In addition, we highlight
shortcomings of electrostatic doping simulations in modeling different
subclasses of polar metals, noting how the assumptions of this approach depart
from experiment. We include a survey of known materials that combine polar
symmetry with metallic conductivity, classified according to the mechanisms
used to harmonize those two orders and their resulting properties. We conclude
by describing opportunities for the discovery of novel polar metals by
utilizing our taxonomy.

<h3>Universal cover-time distribution of heterogeneous random walks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05122" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05122</a>
<br>
<i>Jia-Qi Dong, Wen-Hui Han, Yisen Wang, Xiao-Song Chen, Liang Huang</i>
<br>
The cover-time problem, i.e., time to visit every site in a system, is one of
the key issues of random walks with wide applications in natural, social, and
engineered systems. Addressing the full distribution of cover times for random
walk on complex structures has been a long-standing challenge and has attracted
persistent efforts. Yet, the known results are essentially limited to
homogeneous systems, where different sites are on an equal footing and have
identical or close mean first-passage times, such as random walks on a torus.
In contrast, realistic random walks are prevailingly heterogeneous with
diversified mean first-passage times. Does a universal distribution still
exist? Here, by considering the most general situations, we uncover a
generalized rescaling relation for the cover time, exploiting the diversified
mean first-passage times that have not been accounted for before. This allows
us to concretely establish a universal distribution of the rescaled cover times
for heterogeneous random walks, which turns out to be the Gumbel universality
class that is ubiquitous for a large family of extreme value statistics. Our
analysis is based on the transfer matrix framework, which is generic that
besides heterogeneity, it is also robust against biased protocols, directed
links, and self-connecting loops. The finding is corroborated with extensive
numerical simulations of diverse heterogeneous non-compact random walks on both
model and realistic topological structures. Our new technical ingredient may be
exploited for other extreme value or ergodicity problems with nonidentical
distributions.

<h3>Self organized criticality of magnetic avalanches in disordered  ferrimagnetic material</h3>

<br>
We observe multiple step-like jumps in a Dy-Fe-Ga-based ferrimagnetic alloy
in its magnetic hysteresis curve at 2 K. The observed jumps have a stochastic
character with respect to their magnitude and the critical field of occurrence,
and the jumps do not show any temporal effect. The jump size distribution
follows a power law variation indicating the scale invariance nature of the
jumps. We have invoked a simple two-dimensional random bond Ising-type spin
system to model the dynamics. Our computational work can qualitatively
reproduce the jumps and their scale invariant character. It also elucidates
that the flipping of antiferromagnetically coupled Dy and Fe clusters is
responsible for the observed discrete avalanche-like features in the hysteresis
loop. These characteristics indicate that the present phenomenon can be well
described within the realm of self-organized criticality

<br>
Recently, log-periodic quantum oscillations have been detected in topological
materials zirconium pentatelluride (ZrTe5) and hafnium pentatelluride (HfTe5),
displaying intriguing discrete scale invariance (DSI) characteristic. In
condensed materials, the DSI is considered to be related to the quasi-bound
states formed by massless Dirac fermions with strong Coulomb attraction,
offering a feasible platform to study the long-pursued atomic-collapse
phenomenon. Here, we demonstrate that a variety of atomic vacancies in the
topological material HfTe5 can host the geometric quasi-bound states with DSI
feature, resembling the artificial supercritical atom collapse. The density of
states of these quasi-bound states are enhanced and the quasi-bound states are
spatially distributed in the "orbitals" surrounding the vacancy sites, which
are detected and visualized by low-temperature scanning tunneling
microscope/spectroscopy (STM/S). By applying the perpendicular magnetic fields,
the quasi-bound states at lower energies become wider and eventually invisible,
meanwhile the energies of quasi-bound states move gradually towards the Fermi
energy (EF). These features are consistent with the theoretical prediction of a
magnetic-field-induced transition from supercritical to subcritical states. The
direct observation of geometric quasi-bound states sheds light on the deep
understanding of the DSI in quantum materials.

weak-coupling limit of the system with slightly depleted Bose condensate and
almost ideal Fermi gas, the (meta)stable phase with dimers composed exactly of
one boson and one fermion. The peculiarities of the fermion-dimer and the
boson-dimer three-body effective interactions and their impact on the

<h3>Nonequilibrium thermodynamics of uncertain stochastic processes</h3>

<i>Jan Korbel, David H. Wolpert</i>
<br>
Stochastic thermodynamics is formulated under the assumption of perfect
knowledge of all thermodynamic parameters. However, in any real-world
experiment, there is non-zero uncertainty about the precise value of
temperatures, chemical potentials, energy spectrum, etc. Here we investigate
how this uncertainty modifies the theorems of stochastic thermodynamics. We
consider two scenarios: in the (called effective) scenario, we fix the
(unknown, randomly generated) experimental apparatus and then repeatedly
observe (stochastic) trajectories of the system for that fixed apparatus. In
contrast, in a (called phenomenological) scenario, the (unknown) apparatus is
re-generated for each trajectory. We derive expressions for thermodynamic
quantities in both scenarios. We also discuss the physical interpretation of
effective (scenario) entropy production (EP), derive the effective mismatch
cost, and provide a numerical analysis of the effective thermodynamics of a
quantum dot implementing bit erasure with uncertain temperature. We then
analyze the protocol for moving between two state distributions that maximizes
effective work extraction. Next, we investigate the effective thermodynamic
value of information, focusing on the case where there is a delay between the
initialization of the system and the start of the protocol. Finally, we derive
the detailed and integrated fluctuation theorems (FTs) for the phenomenological
EP. In particular, we show how the phenomenological FTs account for the fact
that the longer a trajectory runs, the more information it provides concerning
the precise experimental apparatus and, therefore, the less EP it generates.

<h3>Two-dimensional ferromagnetic semiconductors of rare-earth Janus  2$\textit{H}$-GdXY (X, Y=Cl, Br, I, X$\neq$Y) monolayers with large valley  polarization</h3>

<br>
<i>Cunquan Li, Yukai An</i>
<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic semiconductors show great potentials for
their potential applications in next-generation information devices. In this
work, using first-principles calculations, the Janus 2$H$-GdXY (X, Y = Cl, Br,
I, X$\neq$Y) monolayers based on rare-earth element with $4f^{7}+5d^{1}$ of
Gd$^{2+}$ are predicted. The results suggest that the Janus 2$H$-GdXY
monolayers exhibit small exfoliation energy of less than 0.25 J/m$^{2}$,
excellent dynamical/thermal stabilities and ferromagnetic semiconductor
characters with large spin-orbit coupling effect and high Curie temperatures
(T$_{c}$) above 260 K based on the Monte Carlo simulations. Under proper
tensile strains (5-6%), the transition from bipolar magnetic semiconductor
(BMS) to half-semiconductor (HSC) phase is observed for the Janus 2$H$-GdXY
monolayers. In addition, both the 2$H$-GdICl and 2$H$-GdIBr monolayers show
in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) character, while the 2$H$-GdBrCl monolayer
exhibits perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) character, which can be
attributed to the competition between Gd-$p/d$ and halogen atom-$p$ orbitals.
Calculated valley optical actions of the Janus 2$H$-GdXY monolayers exhibit
distinguished valley-selective circular dichroisms, which is expected to
realize the special valley excitation by polarized light. Spontaneously
valley-Zeeman effect in the valance band for the Janus 2$H$-GdXY monolayers
induces a giant valley splitting of 60-120 meV, which is also robust against
various external biaxial strains. Tunable valley degree of freedom in the Janus
2$H$-GdXY systems is very necessary for encoding and processing information.
This work paves the way to design ferro-valley materials for practical
application in multifunctional valleytronic devices.

<h3>Topological superconductivity from doping a triplet quantum spin liquid  in a flat band system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05275" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05275</a>
<br>
<i>Manuel FernÃ¡ndez LÃ³pez, Ben J. Powell, Jaime Merino</i>
<br>
We explore superconductivity in strongly interacting electrons on a decorated
honeycomb lattice (DHL). An easy-plane ferromagnetic interaction arises from
spin-orbit coupling in the Mott insulating phase, which favors a triplet
resonance valence bond spin liquid state. Hole doping leads to partial
occupation of a flat band and to triplet superconductivity. The order parameter
is highly sensitive to the doping level and the interaction parameters, with
$p+ip$, $f$ and $p+f$ superconductivity found, as the flat band leads to
instabilities in multiple channels. Typically, first order transitions separate
different superconducting phases, but a second order transition separates two
time reversal symmetry breaking $p+ip$ phases with different Chern numbers
($\nu=0$ and 1). The Majorana edge modes in the topological ($\nu=1$)
superconductor are almost localized due to the strong electronic correlations
in a system with a flat band at the Fermi level. This suggests that these modes
could be useful for topological quantum computing. The `hybrid' $p+f$ state
does not require two phase transitions as temperature is lowered. This is
because the symmetry of the model is lowered in the $p$-wave phase, allowing
arbitrary admixtures of $f$-wave basis functions as overtones. We show that the
multiple sites per unit cell of the DHL, and hence multiple bands near the
Fermi energy, lead to very different nodal structures in real and reciprocal
space. We emphasize that this should be a generic feature of
multi-site/multi-band superconductors.

<br>
We keep track of the orbital degree of freedom of an exciton polariton
condensate, confined in an optical trap, and reveal the stochastic switching of
persistent annular polariton currents in the pulse-periodic excitation
regime.In an elliptic trap, the low-lying in energy polariton current states
are inherent in a two-petalled density distribution and swirling phase. In the
stochastic regime, the averaged over multiple excitation pulses density
distribution gets homogenised in the azimuthal direction, while the weighted
phase extracted from interference experiments experiences two compensating each
other jumps, when varying around the center of the trap. Breaking the
reciprocity of the system with a supplemental control optical pulse makes it
possible to switch the system from the stochastic regime to the deterministic
regime of an arbitrary polariton circulation.

<br>
We study formation of superfluid currents of exciton polaritons in annular
polariton condensates in a cylindrical micropillar cavity under the spatially
localised nonresonant optical pumping. Since polariton condensates are strongly
nonequilibrium systems, the trapping potential for polaritons, formed by the
pillar edge and the reservoir of optically induced incoherent excitons, is
complex in general case. Its imaginary part includes the spatially distributed
gain from the pump and losses of polaritons in the condensate. We show that
engineering the gain-loss balance in the micropillar plane gives access to the
excited states of the polariton condensate. We demonstrate both theoretically
and experimentally formation of vortices in double concentric ring polariton
condensates in the complex annular trap potential.

currents of polaritons. The trapping potential is formed by a cylindrical
micropillar etched in a semiconductor microcavity with embedded quantum wells
and a repulsive cloud of optically excited excitons under the pump spot. The
symmetry of the potential is subject to external control via manipulation by
its pump-induced component. In the manuscript, we demonstrate excitation of
concentric ring polariton current states with predetermined vorticity which we
trace using interferometry measurements with a spherical reference wave. We
also observe the polariton condensate dynamically changing its vorticity during
observation, which results in pairs of fork-like dislocations on the
time-averaged interferogram coexisting with azimuthally homogeneous
photoluminescence distribution in the micropillar.

We investigate from first principles screening effects in endohedral
complexes when small molecules, characterized by a finite electronic dipole
moment, such as HF, LiF, NaCl, and H$_2$O, are encapsulated into different
nanoscale cages. We find that screening effects crucially depend on the nature
of the intramolecular bonds of the cage: screening is maximum in covalent-bond
carbon nanocages, while it is reduced in partially-ionic ones. Interestingly,
in the case of the ionic-bond nanocages, an antiscreening effect is observed:
due to the relative displacement of positive and negative ions, induced by the
dipole moment of the encapsulated molecule, these cages act as dipole-field
amplifiers. Our results open the way to the possibility of tuning the dipole
moment of nanocages and of generating electrostatic fields at the nanoscale
without the aid of external potentials. Moreover, we can expect some
transferability of the observed screening effects also to nanotubes and 2D
materials.

The non-equilibrium Fokker-Planck dynamics in an arbitrary force field $\vec
f(\vec r)$ in dimension $N$ is revisited via the correspondence with the
non-hermitian quantum mechanics in a scalar potential $V(\vec r)$ and a vector
potential $\vec A(\vec r)$. The relevant parameters of irreversibility are then
the $\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$ magnetic matrix elements $B_{nm}(\vec x ) =-B_{mn} (\vec
x ) = \partial_n A_m (\vec x ) - \partial_m A_n (\vec x )$, while it is
enlightening to explore the corresponding gauge transformations of the vector
potential $\vec A(\vec r) $. This quantum interpretation is even more fruitful
to study the statistics of all the time-additive observables of the stochastic
trajectories, since their generating functions correspond to the same quantum
problem with additional scalar and/or vector potentials. Our main conclusion is
that the analysis of their large deviations properties and the construction of
the corresponding Doob conditioned processes can be drastically simplified via
the choice of an appropriate gauge for each purpose. This general framework is
then applied to the special time-additive observables of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
trajectories in dimension $N$, whose generating functions correspond to quantum
propagators involving quadratic scalar potentials and linear vector potentials,
i.e. to quantum harmonic oscillators in constant magnetic matrices. As simple
illustrative example, we finally focus on the Brownian gyrator in dimension
$N=2$ in order to compute the large deviations properties of the entropy
production of its stochastic trajectories and to construct the corresponding
conditioned processes having a given value of the entropy production per unit
time.

<br>
Superfluid 4He, the first superfluid ever discovered, is in some ways the
least well understood. Unlike 3He superfluid, or the variety of Bose-Einstein
condensates of ultracold gases, superfluid 4He is a very dense liquid of
strongly interacting quasiparticles. The theory is then necessarily
phenomenological: the quasiparticle properties are found from experiment, and
controversies over their description still remain, notably regarding vortex
dynamics and the nature of rotons and roton pair creation. It is therefore
important to develop new experimental tools for probing the system far from
equilibrium. Here we describe a method for locally perturbing the density of
superfluid helium through the excitation of roton pairs with ultrashort laser
pulses. By measuring the time dependence of this perturbation, we track the
non-equilibrium evolution of the two-roton states on a picosecond timescale.
Our results reveal an ultrafast cooling of hot roton pairs as they thermalize
with the colder gas of other quasiparticles. We anticipate that these findings,
as well as future applications of the introduced ultrafast laser technique to
different temperature and pressure regimes in bulk liquid 4He, will stimulate
further experimental and theoretical investigations towards better
understanding of superfluidity.

<h3>Beyond the effective length: How to analyse magnetic interference  patterns of thin film planar Josephson junctions with finite lateral  dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05388" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05388</a>
<br>
<i>Remko Fermin, Bob de Wit, Jan Aarts</i>
<br>
The magnetic field dependent critical current $I_{\text{c}}(B)$ of a
Josephson junction is determined by the screening currents in its electrodes.
In macroscopic junctions, a local vector potential drives the currents,
however, in thin film planar junctions, with electrodes of finite size and
various shapes, they are governed by non-local electrodynamics. This
complicates the extraction of parameters such as the geometry of the effective
junction area, the effective junction length and, the critical current density
distribution from the $I_{\text{c}}(B)$ interference patterns. Here we provide
a method to tackle this problem by simulating the phase differences that drive
the shielding currents and use those to find $I_{\text{c}}(B)$. To this end, we
extend the technique proposed by John Clem [Phys. Rev. B, $\textbf{81}$, 144515
(2010)] to find $I_{\text{c}}(B)$ for Josephson junctions separating a
superconducting strip of length $L$ and width $W$ with rectangular, ellipsoid
and rhomboid geometries. We find the periodicity of the interference pattern
($\Delta B$) to have geometry independent limits for $L \gg W$ and $L \ll W$.
By fabricating elliptically shaped S$-$N$-$S junctions with various aspect
ratios, we experimentally verify the $L/W$ dependence of $\Delta B$. Finally,
we incorporate these results to correctly extract the distribution of critical
currents in the junction by the Fourier analysis of $I_{\text{c}}(B)$, which
makes these results essential for the correct analysis of topological channels
in thin film planar Josephson junctions.

Combinations of advanced X-ray sources and zero-noise detector of enormous
dynamic range have significantly increased the opportunity of mapping the
reciprocal space of crystal lattices. It is particularly important in the
design of new devices based on epitaxial thin films. In this work, we present a
simple approach to the three-dimensional geometry involved in plotting
reciprocal space maps, along with an example of computer codes to allow X-ray
users to write their own codes. Experimental data used to illustrate an
application of the codes are from antimony telluride epitaxial film on barium

We investigate non-linear transport signatures stemming from linear and cubic
spin-orbit interactions in one- and two-dimensional systems. The analytical
zero-temperature response to external fields is complemented by finite
temperature numerical analysis, establishing a way to distinguish between
linear and cubic spin-orbit interactions. We also propose a protocol to
determine the relevant material parameters from transport measurements
attainable in realistic conditions, illustrated by values for Ge
heterostructures. Our results establish a method for the fast benchmarking of

The coupling of light to electrical charge carriers in semiconductors is the
foundation of many technological applications. Attosecond transient absorption
spectroscopy measures simultaneously how excited electrons and the vacancies
they leave behind dynamically react to the applied optical fields. In compound
semiconductors, these dynamics can be probed via any of their atomic
constituents. Often, the atomic species forming the compound contribute
comparably to the relevant electronic properties of the material. One therefore
expects to observe similar dynamics, irrespective of the choice of atomic
species via which it is probed. Here, we show in the two-dimensional transition
metal dichalcogenide semiconductor $MoSe_2$, that through a selenium-based
transition we observe charge carriers acting independently from each other,
while when probed through molybdenum, the collective, many-body motion of the
carriers dominates. Such unexpectedly contrasting behavior can be traced back
to a strong localization of electrons around molybdenum atoms following
absorption of light, which modifies the local fields acting on the carriers. We
show that similar behavior in elemental titanium metal carries over to
transition metal-containing compounds and is expected to play an essential role
for a wide range of such materials. Knowledge of independent particle and
collective response is essential for fully understanding these materials.

Viscosity, as a physical property of fluids, reflects an average effect over

<h3>Disorder effects on the metastability of classical Heisenberg  ferromagnets</h3>

<br>
<i>Moumita Naskar, Muktish Acharyya, Erol Vatansever, Nikolaos G Fytas</i>
<br>
In the present work we investigate the effects of disorder on the reversal
time ($\tau$) of classical anisotropic Heisenberg ferromagnets in three
dimensions by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Starting from the pure system,
our analysis suggests that $\tau$ increases with increasing anisotropy
strength. On the other hand, for the case of randomly distributed anisotropy,
generated from various statistical distributions, a set of results is obtained:
(i) For both bimodal and uniform distributions the variation of $\tau$ with the
strength of anisotropy strongly depends on temperature. (ii) At lower
temperatures, the decrement in $\tau$ with increasing width of the distribution
is more prominent. (iii) For the case of normally distributed anisotropy, the
variation of $\tau$ with the width of the distribution is non-monotonic,
featuring a minimum value which decays exponentially with the temperature.
Finally, we elaborate on the joint effect of longitudinal ($h_z$) and
transverse ($h_x$) fields on $\tau$, which appears to obey a scaling behavior
of the form $\tau h_z^{n} \sim f(h_xh_z^{m})$.

<h3>Topological charge pumping with subwavelength Raman lattices</h3>

Recent experiments demonstrated deeply subwavelength lattices using atoms
with $N$ internal states Raman-coupled with lasers of wavelength $\lambda$. The
resulting unit cell was $\lambda/2N$ in extent, an $N$-fold reduction compared
to the usual $\lambda/2$ periodicity of an optical lattice. For resonant Raman
coupling, this lattice consists of $N$ independent sinusoidal potentials (with
period $\lambda/2$) displaced by $\lambda/2N$ from each other. We show that
detuning from Raman resonance induces tunneling between these potentials.
Periodically modulating the detuning couples the $s$- and $p$-bands of the
potentials, creating a pair of coupled subwavelength Rice--Mele chains. This
operates as a novel topological charge pump that counter-intuitively can give
half the displacement per pump cycle of each individual Rice--Mele chain
separately. We analytically describe this behavior in terms of infinite-system
Chern numbers, and numerically identify the associated finite-system edge
states.

A quantum Hall interferometer containing a grounded superconducting terminal
is proposed. This geometry allows to control the Andreev and normal scattering
amplitudes of sub-gap Bogoliubov quasiparticles with the Aharonov-Bohm phase,
as well as with the constrictions defining the interferometer loop. The
conductance matrix of a three-terminal interferometer exhibits a much richer
behavior as compared to its two-terminal Fabry-P\'erot counterpart. In
particular, an arbitrarily small Andreev reflection probability can be
resonantly enhanced up to 1 by the interference.

<br>
Systems with strong electronic Coulomb correlations often display rich phase
diagrams exhibiting different ordered phases involving spin, charge, or orbital
degrees of freedom. The theoretical description of the interplay of the
corresponding collective fluctuations giving rise to this phenomenology remains
however a tremendous challenge. Here, we introduce a multi-channel extension of
the recently developed fluctuating field approach to competing collective
fluctuations in correlated electron systems. The method is based on a
variational optimization of a trial action that explicitly contains the order
parameters of the leading fluctuation channels. It gives direct access to the
free energy of the system, facilitating the distinction between stable and
meta-stable phases of the system. We apply our approach to the extended Hubbard
model in the weak to intermediate coupling regime where we find it to capture
the interplay of competing charge density wave and antiferromagnetic
fluctuations with qualitative agreement with more computationally expensive
methods. The multi-channel fluctuation field approach thus offers a promising
new route for a numerically cheap treatment of the interplay between collective
fluctuations in large systems.

<h3>On the chemical potential of many-body perturbation theory in extended  systems</h3>

Many methods for computing electronic correlation effects at finite
temperature are related to many-body perturbation theory in the grand-canonical
ensemble. In most applications, however, the average number of electrons is
known rather than the chemical potential, requiring that expensive correlation
calculations must be repeated iteratively in search for the chemical potential
that yields the desired average number of electrons. In theory, however, the
long-ranged electrostatic interaction should guarantee that the average number
of electrons in extended systems equals the number of positive charges for any
finite chemical potential. All properties per electron are virtually
independent of the chemical potential, as for instance in an electric wire at
different voltage potentials.
This work shows that the infinite-size limit of the exchange-correlation free
energy agrees with the infinite-size limit of the exchange-correlation grand
potential at a non-interacting chemical potential. The latter requires only one
expensive correlation calculation for each system size. Analogous to classical
simulations of long-range-interacting particles, this work uses a
regularization of the Coulomb interaction such that each electron on average
interacts only with as many electrons as there are electrons in the simulation,
avoiding interactions with periodic images.
Numerical calculations of the warm uniform electron gas have been conducted
with the Spencer--Alavi regularization employing the finite-temperature Hartree
approximation for the self-consistent field and linearized finite-temperature
direct-ring coupled cluster doubles for treating correlation.

Hund's rule coupling (J) has attracted much attention recently for its role
in the description of the novel quantum phases of multi orbital materials.
Depending on the orbital occupancy, J can lead to various intriguing phases.
However, experimental confirmation of the orbital occupancy dependency has been
difficult as controlling the orbital degrees of freedom normally accompanies
chemical inhomogeneities. Here, we demonstrate a method to investigate the role
of orbital occupancy in J related phenomena without inducing inhomogeneities.
By growing SrRuO3 monolayers on various substrates with symmetry-preserving
interlayers, we gradually tune the crystal field splitting and thus the orbital
degeneracy of the Ru t2g orbitals. It effectively varies the orbital
occupancies of two-dimensional (2D) ruthenates. Via in-situ angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, we observe a progressive metal-insulator transition
(MIT). It is found that the MIT occurs with orbital differentiation: concurrent
opening of a band insulating gap in the dxy band and a Mott gap in the dxz/yz
bands. Our study provides an effective experimental method for investigation of
orbital-selective phenomena in multi-orbital materials.

We complete measurements of interconversions among the full triad of thermal
gradients, charge currents, and spin currents in the topological insulator
Bi$_2$Se$_3$ by quantifying the efficiency with which thermal gradients can
generate transverse spin currents. We accomplish this by comparing the spin
Nernst magneto-thermopower to the spin Hall magnesistance for bilayers of
Bi$_2$Se$_3$/CoFeB. We find that Bi$_2$Se$_3$ does generate substantial
thermally-driven spin currents. A lower bound for the ratio of spin current to
thermal gradient is $J_s/\nabla_x T$ = (4.9 $\pm$ 0.9) $\times$ 10$^{6}$
($\hbar/2e$) A m$^{-2}$ / K $\mu$m$^{-1}$, and a lower bound for the magnitude
of the spin Nernst ratio is $-$0.61 $\pm$ 0.11. The spin Nernst ratio for
Bi$_2$Se$_3$ is the largest among all materials measured to date, 2-3 times
larger compared to previous measurements for the heavy metals Pt and W.

Rare-earth pyrochlore iridates host two interlocking magnetic sublattices of
corner-sharing tetrahedra and can harbour a unique combination of frustrated
moments, exotic excitations and highly correlated electrons. We have measured
the transport and magnetotransport properties of single-crystal
Sm$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ up to and beyond the pressure-induced quantum critical point
(QCP) for all-in-all-out (AIAO) Ir order at $p_$ = 63~kbar previously
identified by resonant X-ray scattering. Contrary to prior predictions, we do
not find a crossover from insulating to metallic behavior at low temperatures
above $p_$. Instead, the metal-insulator transition temperature, which
tracks the decrease in the AIAO ordering temperature for pressures up to
30~kbar, begins to increase under further application of pressure, pointing to
the presence of an as-yet unidentified localization mechanism. The
magnetotransport does track the suppression of Ir magnetism, however, with a
strong hysteresis observed only within the AIAO phase boundary, similar to that
found for Ho$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ and attributed to plastic deformation of Ir
domains. Around $p_$ we find the emergence of a new type of electronic
behavior, characterized by a negative magnetoresistance with small hysteresis
at the lowest temperatures, and hysteresis-free positive magnetoresistance
above 5~K. A Weyl semimetal phase is predicted to occur in the vicinity of the
QCP. The temperature dependence of our low-temperature transport data, however,
are found to be best described by a model consistent with a Weyl semimetal
across the entire pressure range.

<h3>Influence of chemistry and structure on interfacial segregation in  NbMoTaW with high-throughput atomistic simulations</h3>

Refractory multi-principal element alloys exhibiting promising mechanical
properties such as excellent strength retention at elevated temperatures have
been attracting increasing attention. Although their inherent chemical
complexity is considered a defining feature, a challenge arises in predicting
local chemical ordering, particularly in grain boundary regions with enhanced
structural disorder. In this study, we use atomistic simulations of a large
group of bicrystal models to sample a wide variety of interfacial sites (grain
boundary) in NbMoTaW and explore emergent trends in interfacial segregation and
the underlying structural and chemical driving factors. Sampling hundreds of
bicrystals along the [001] symmetric tilt axis and analyzing more than one
hundred and thirty thousand grain boundary sites with a variety of local atomic
environments, we uncover segregation trends in NbMoTaW. While Nb is the
dominant segregant, more notable are the segregation patterns that deviate from
expected behavior and mark situations where local structural and chemical
driving forces lead to interesting segregation events. For example, incomplete
depletion of Ta in low-angle boundaries results from chemical pinning due to
favorable local compositional environments associated with chemical short-range
ordering. Finally, machine learning models capturing and comparing the
structural and chemical features of interfacial sites are developed to weigh
their relative importance and contributions to segregation tendency, revealing
a significant increase in predictive capability when including local chemical
information. Overall, this work, highlighting the complex interplay between
local grain boundary structure and chemical short-range ordering, suggest
tunable segregation and chemical ordering by tailoring grain boundary structure
in multi-principal element alloys.
