<h3>Codimension-2 defects and higher symmetries in (3+1)D topological phases</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07367v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07367v1</a>
<br>
<i>Maissam Barkeshli, Yu-An Chen, Sheng-Jie Huang, Ryohei Kobayashi, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Guanyu Zhu</i>

(3+1)D topological phases of matter can host a broad class of non-trivial
topological defects of codimension-1, 2, and 3, of which the well-known point
charges and flux loops are special cases. The complete algebraic structure of
these defects defines a higher category, and can be viewed as an emergent
higher symmetry. This plays a crucial role both in the classification of phases
of matter and the possible fault-tolerant logical operations in topological
quantum error correcting codes. In this paper, we study several examples of
such higher codimension defects from distinct perspectives. We mainly study a
class of invertible codimension-2 topological defects, which we refer to as
twist strings. We provide a number of general constructions for twist strings,
in terms of gauging lower dimensional invertible phases, layer constructions,
and condensation defects. We study some special examples in the context of
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with fermionic charges, in $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times
\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with bosonic charges, and also in non-Abelian
discrete gauge theories based on dihedral ($D_n$) and alternating ($A_6$)
groups. The intersection between twist strings and Abelian flux loops sources
Abelian point charges, which defines an $H^4$ cohomology class that
characterizes part of an underlying 3-group symmetry of the topological order.
The equations involving background gauge fields for the 3-group symmetry have
been explicitly written down for various cases. We also study examples of twist
strings interacting with non-Abelian flux loops (defining part of a
non-invertible higher symmetry), examples of non-invertible codimension-2
defects, and examples of interplay of codimension-2 defects with codimension-1
defects. We also find an example of geometric, not fully topological, twist
strings in (3+1)D $A_6$ gauge theory.

Microscopically understanding competing orders in strongly correlated systems
is a key challenge in modern quantum many-body physics. For example, the origin
of stripe order and its relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model remains
one of the central questions, and may help to understand the origin of
high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we analyze stripe
formation in the doped mixed-dimensional (mixD) variant of the $t-J$ model,
where charge carriers are restricted to move only in one direction, whereas
magnetic $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ interactions are two-dimensional. Using the density
matrix renormalization group at finite temperature, we find a stable vertical
stripe phase in the absence of pairing, featuring incommensurate magnetic order
and long-range charge density wave profiles over a wide range of dopings. We
find high critical temperatures on the order of the magnetic coupling $J$,
hence being within reach of current quantum simulators. Snapshots of the
many-body state, accessible to quantum simulators, reveal hidden spin
correlations in the mixD setting, whereby antiferromagnetic correlations are
enhanced when considering purely the magnetic background. The proposed model
can be viewed as realizing a parent Hamiltonian of the stripe phase, whose
hidden spin correlations lead to the predicted resilience against quantum and
thermal fluctuations.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07361v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07361v1</a>

<i>Clement Delcamp</i>

We consider a higher gauge topological model in three spatial dimensions
whose input datum is a 2-group encoding the mixing of a 0-form $\mathbb Z_2$-
and 1-form $\mathbb Z_3$-symmetry. We study the excitation content of the
theory on the symmetry-preserving boundary. We show that boundary operators are
organised into the fusion 2-category of 2-representations of the 2-group. These
can be interpreted as categorical charges for an effective boundary model that
inherits a global 2-group symmetry from the bulk topological order.
Interestingly, we find that certain simple 2-representations are physically
interpreted as composites of intrinsic excitations and condensation defects.

</body><h3>A statistical mechanics framework for polymer chain scission, based on the concepts of distorted bond potential and asymptotic matching</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07352v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07352v1</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
To design increasingly tough, resilient, and fatigue-resistant elastomers and
hydrogels, the relationship between controllable network parameters at the
molecular level to macroscopic quantities that govern damage and failure must
be established. Constitutive models based upon statistical mechanics have used
variants of the freely jointed chain (FJC) model with rigid links. However,
since the free energy state of a polymer chain is dominated by enthalpic bond
distortion effects as the chain approaches its rupture point, bond
extensibility ought to be accounted for if the model is intended to capture
chain rupture. To that end, a new bond potential is supplemented to the FJC
model (as derived in the uFJC framework of Buche and colleagues), which we have
extended to yield a tractable, closed-form model that is amenable to
constitutive model development. Inspired by the asymptotically matched uFJC
model response, a simple, quasi-polynomial, and anharmonic bond potential
energy function is derived. Using this bond potential, approximate yet
highly-accurate analytical functions for bond stretch and chain force dependent
upon chain stretch are established. Then, using this polymer chain model, a
stochastic thermal fluctuation-driven chain rupture framework is developed.
This framework is based upon a force-modified tilted bond potential that
accounts for distortional bond potential energy, allowing for the calculation
of dissipated chain scission energy. The model is fit to single-chain
mechanical response data collected from atomic force microscopy tensile tests
for validation and to glean deeper insight into the molecular physics taking
place. Due to their analytical nature, this polymer chain model and the
associated rupture framework can be straightforwardly implemented in finite
element models accounting for fracture and fatigue in polydisperse elastomer
networks.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07320v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07320v1</a>
<br>
<i>Aidan Zabalo, Ang-Kun Wu, J. H. Pixley, Emil A. Yuzbashyan</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that the classical (mean-field) description of far from equilibrium
superconductivity is exact in the thermodynamic limit for local observables but
breaks down for global quantities, such as the entanglement entropy or
Loschmidt echo. We do this by solving for and comparing exact quantum and exact
classical long-time dynamics of a BCS superconductor with interaction strength
inversely proportional to time and evaluating local observables explicitly. We
further identify a regime where nonequilibrium quantum fluctuations of
anomalous averages (superconducting order) are unusually strong, such that the
thermodynamic limit does not commute with the adiabatic and strong initial
coupling limits for these local observables. The long-time steady state of the
system is a gapless superconductor whose superfluid properties are only
accessible through energy resolved measurements. This state is non-thermal but
conforms to an emergent Generalized Gibbs Ensemble. Our study clarifies the
nature of symmetry-broken many-body states in and out of equilibrium and fills
a crucial gap in the theory of time-dependent quantum integrability.

</body><h3>Nonperturbative approach to interfacial spin-orbit torques induced by Rashba effect</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07296v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07296v1</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Current-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) in normal metal/ferromagnet (NM/FM)
bilayers bears great promise for technological applications, but the
microscopic origin of purely interfacial SOTs in ultra-thin systems is not yet
fully understood. Here, we show that a linear response theory with a
nonperturbative treatment of spin-dependent interactions and impurity
scattering potential predicts damping-like SOTs that are strictly absent in
perturbative approaches. The technique is applied to a two-dimensional
Rashba-coupled ferromagnet (the paradigmatic model of a NM/FM interface), where
higher-order scattering processes encoding skew scattering from nonmagnetic
impurities allow for current-induced spin polarization with nonzero components
along all spatial directions. This is in stark contrast to previous results of
perturbative methods (neglecting skew scattering), which predict a coplanar
spin-polarization locked perpendicular to the charge current as a result of
conventional Rashba-Edelstein effect. Furthermore, the angular dependence of
ensuing SOTs and their dependence upon the scattering potential strength is
analysed numerically. Simple analytic expressions for the
spin-density--charge-current response function, and related SOT efficiencies,
are obtained in the weak scattering limit. We find that the extrinsic
damping-like torques driven by impurity scattering reaches efficiencies of up
to 7% of the field-like (Rashba-Edelstein) torque. Our microscopic theory shows
that bulk phenomena, such as the spin Hall effect, are not a necessity in the
generation of the damping-like SOTs of the type observed in experiments on
ultra-thin systems.

</body><h3>Absorption of Transverse Spin Current in Ferromagnetic NiCu: Dominance of Bulk Dephasing over Spin-Flip Scattering</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07294v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07294v1</a>
<br>
<i>Youngmin Lim, Shuang Wu, David A. Smith, Christoph Klewe, Padraic Shafer, Satoru Emori</i>
<br>
<br>
In ferromagnetic metals, transverse spin currents are thought to be absorbed
via dephasing -- i.e., destructive interference of spins precessing about the
strong exchange field. Yet, due to the ultrashort coherence length of
$\approx$1 nm in typical ferromagnetic thin films, it is difficult to
distinguish dephasing in the bulk from spin-flip scattering at the interface.
Here, to assess which mechanism dominates, we examine transverse spin-current
absorption in ferromagnetic NiCu alloy films with reduced exchange fields. We
observe that the coherence length increases with decreasing Curie temperature,
as weaker dephasing in the film bulk slows down spin absorption. Moreover,
nonmagnetic Cu impurities do not diminish the efficiency of spin-transfer
torque from the absorbed spin current. Our findings affirm that transverse spin
current is predominantly absorbed by dephasing inside the nanometer-thick
ferromagnetic metals, even with high impurity contents.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07288v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07288v1</a>
<br>
<i>Taro Kimura, Ali Zahabi</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the universal scaling limit of random partitions obeying the Schur
measure. Extending our previous analysis [arXiv:2012.06424], we obtain the
higher-order Pearcey kernel describing the multi-critical behavior in the cusp
scaling limit. We explore the gap probability associated with the higher
Pearcey kernel, and derive the coupled nonlinear differential equation and the
asymptotic behavior in the large gap limit.

</body><h3>Quantum transport and magnetism of Dirac electrons in solids</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07255v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07255v1</a>
<br>
<i>Hiroki Isobe, Naoto Nagaosa</i>
<br>
<br>
The relativistic Dirac equation covers the fundamentals of electronic
phenomena in solids and as such it effectively describes the electronic states
of the topological insulators like Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Bi$_2$Te$_3$. Topological
insulators feature gapless surface states and, moreover, magnetic doping and
resultant ferromagnetic ordering break time-reversal symmetry to realize
quantum anomalous Hall and Chern insulators. Here we focus on the bulk and
investigate the mutual coupling of electronic and magnetic properties of Dirac
electrons. Without carrier doping, spiral magnetic orders cause a ferroelectric
polarization through the spin-orbit coupling. In a doped metallic state, the
anisotropic magnetoresistance arises without uniform magnetization. We find
that electric current induces uniform magnetization and conversely an
oscillating magnetic order induces electric current. Our model provides a
coherent and unified description of all those phenomena. The mutual control of
electric and magnetic properties demonstrates implementations of
antiferromagnetic spintronics. We also discuss the stoichiometric magnetic
topological insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$.

</body><h3>Full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo for coupled electron--boson systems and infinite spaces</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07205v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07205v1</a>
<br>
<i>Robert J. Anderson, Charles C. J. Scott, George H. Booth</i>
<br>
<br>
We extend the scope of full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo
(FCIQMC) to be applied to coupled fermion-boson hamiltonians, alleviating the a
priori truncation in boson occupation which is necessary for many other wave
function based approaches to be tractable. Detailing the required algorithmic
changes for efficient excitation generation, we apply FCIQMC in two contrasting
settings. The first is a sign-problem-free Hubbard--Holstein model of local
electron-phonon interactions, where we show that with care to control for
population bias via importance sampling and/or reweighting, the method can
achieve unbiased energies extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit, without
suffering additional computational overheads from relaxing boson occupation
constraints. Secondly, we apply the method as a `solver' within a quantum
embedding scheme which maps electronic systems to local electron-boson
auxiliary models, with the bosons representing coupling to long-range
plasmonic-like fluctuations. We are able to sample these general electron-boson
hamiltonians with ease despite a formal sign problem, including a faithful
reconstruction of converged reduced density matrices of the system.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07192v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07192v1</a>
<br>
<i>Jannes Nys, Giuseppe Carleo</i>
<br>
<br>
Local Hamiltonians of fermionic systems on a lattice can be mapped onto local
qubit Hamiltonians. Maintaining the locality of the operators comes at the
expense of increasing the Hilbert space with auxiliary degrees of freedom. In
order to retrieve the lower-dimensional physical Hilbert space that represents
fermionic degrees of freedom, one must satisfy a set of constraints. In this
work, we introduce quantum circuits that exactly satisfy these stringent
constraints. We demonstrate how maintaining locality allows one to carry out a
Trotterized time-evolution with constant circuit depth per time step. Our
construction is particularly advantageous to simulate the time evolution
operator of fermionic systems in d>1 dimensions. We also discuss how these
families of circuits can be used as variational quantum states, focusing on two
approaches: a first one based on general constant-fermion-number gates, and a
second one based on the Hamiltonian variational ansatz where the eigenstates
are represented by parametrized time-evolution operators. We apply our methods
to the problem of finding the ground state and time-evolved states of the
spinless 2D Fermi-Hubbard model.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07184v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07184v1</a>
<br>
<i>David Ziemkiewicz, Sylwia Zieliska-Raczyska</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the propagation of surface plasmons (SPPs) in a thin layer of
copper surrounded by copper oxide Cu$_2$O. It is shown that particularly strong
excitons in Cu$_2$O can have considerable impact on plasmon propagation,
providing many opportunities for plasmon-exciton and plasmon-plasmon
interactions. It is demonstrated that by the use of sufficiently thin metal
layer, one can excite the so-called long range plasmons (LRSPPs) which can
overcome the inherently high ohmic losses of Cu as compared to usual plasmonic
metals such as silver. Analytical results are confirmed by numerical
calculations.

</body><h3>Emergent chiral symmetry in non-bipartite kagome and pyrochlore lattices with spin-orbit coupling</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07171v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07171v1</a>
<br>
<i>Hiroki Nakai, Masataka Kawano, Chisa Hotta</i>
<br>
<br>
Chiral symmetry in energy bands appears as perfectly symmetric anti-bonding
and bonding pairs of energy levels. It has only been observed in a few classes
of models with a bipartite lattice structure or Bogoliubov-de-Gennes systems
having the pairwise basis. We show that the non-bipartite kagome and pyrochlore
lattices can host chiral symmetric bands when the strong spin-orbit coupling is
introduced. There, the electrons hop to their neighbors by always converting
the spin orientation up-side-down, which allows the up and down spin bases to
form fictitious bipartite connections. The gauge invariant Wilson loop operator
defined on a triangular unit serves as a marker to detect the presence of
chiral symmetry, and using this property, the chiral operator is constructed.
This allows us to access their topological symmetry classes that can easily
change with small perturbations.

The quest for realizing and manipulating ever smaller man-made movable
structures and dynamical machines has spurred tremendous endeavors, led to
important discoveries, and inspired researchers to venture to new grounds.
Scientific feats and technological milestones of miniaturization of mechanical
structures have been widely accomplished by advances in machining and
sculpturing ever shrinking features out of bulk materials such as silicon. With
the flourishing multidisciplinary field of low-dimensional nanomaterials,
including one-dimensional (1D) nanowires/nanotubes, and two-dimensional (2D)
atomic layers such as graphene/phosphorene, growing interests and sustained
efforts have been devoted to creating mechanical devices toward the ultimate
limit of miniaturization--genuinely down to the molecular or even atomic scale.
These ultrasmall movable structures, particularly nanomechanical resonators
that exploit the vibratory motion in these 1D and 2D nano-to-atomic-scale
structures, offer exceptional device-level attributes, such as ultralow mass,
ultrawide frequency tuning range, broad dynamic range, and ultralow power
consumption, thus holding strong promises for both fundamental studies and
engineering applications. In this Review, we offer a comprehensive overview and
summary of this vibrant field, present the state-of-the-art devices and
evaluate their specifications and performance, outline important achievements,
and postulate future directions for studying these miniscule yet intriguing
molecular-scale machines.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07139v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07139v1</a>

The Pauli limiting field represents fundamental magnetic field at which
superconducting state collapses due to the spin-paramagnetic Cooper
pair-breaking effect. Cao et al [1] reported that the upper critical field
(i.e., the magnetic field at which the superconducting state collapses in
experiment) in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATNG, N=3) in 2-3 times
exceeds the Pauli limiting field in this material. This observation was
interpreted as a violation of the Pauli-limiting field in MAT3G. Similar
conclusions were recently reported by the same research group in MATNG (N=4,5)
superlattices [2,3]. Here we point out that Cao et al [1] calculated the Pauli
limiting field by the use of reduce (to the weak-coupling limit) full equation
of the electron-phonon mediated superconductivity. Considering, that in the
same paper, Cao et al [1] reported that MATNGs are strong coupled
superconductors, we calculate the Pauli limiting field for strong coupled case
and show that the observed upper critical fields in MATNGs comply with the
Pauli limit. This implies that there is no violation of the Pauli limiting
field in the Moir\'e multilayer graphene superlattices.

</body><h3>On the new universality class in structurally disordered $n$-vector model with long-range interactions</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07136v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07136v1</a>
<br>
<i>Dmytro Shapoval, Maxym Dudka, Yurij Holovatch</i>
<br>
<br>
We study a stability border of a region where nontrivial critical behaviour
of an $n$-vector model with long-range power-law decaying interactions is
induced by the presence of a structural disorder (e.g. weak quenched dilution).
This border is given by the marginal dimension of the order parameter $n_c$
dependent on space dimension, $d$, and a control parameter of the interaction
decay, $\sigma$, below which the model belongs to the new dilution-induced
universality class. Exploiting the Harris criterion and recent
field-theoretical renormalization group results for the pure model with
long-range interactions we get $n_c$ as a three loop
$\epsilon=2\sigma-d$-expansion. We provide numerical values for $n_c$ applying
series resummation methods. Our results show that not only the Ising systems
($n=1$) can belong to the new disorder-induced long-range universality class at
$d=2$ and $d=3$.
