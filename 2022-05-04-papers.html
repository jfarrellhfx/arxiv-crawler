<h3>The rheology of confined colloidal hard discs</h3>

Colloids may be treated as `big atoms' so that they are good models for
atomic and molecular systems. Colloidal hard disks are therefore good models
for 2d materials and although their phase behavior is well characterized,
rheology has received relatively little attention. Here we exploit a novel,
particle-resolved, experimental set-up and complementary computer simulations
to measure the shear rheology of quasi-hard-disc colloids in extreme
confinement. In particular, we confine quasi-2d hard discs in a circular
`corral' comprised of 27 particles held in optical traps. Confinement and shear
suppress hexagonal ordering that would occur in the bulk and create a layered
fluid. We measure the rheology of our system by balancing drag and driving
forces on each layer. Given the extreme confinement, it is remarkable that our
system exhibits rheological behavior very similar to unconfined 2d and 3d hard
particle systems, characterized by a dynamic yield stress and shear-thinning of
comparable magnitude. By quantifying particle motion perpendicular to shear, we
show that particles become more tightly confined to their layers with no
concomitant increase in density upon increasing shear rate. Shear thinning is
therefore a consequence of a reduction in dissipation due to a weakening in
interactions between layers as the shear rate increases. We reproduce our
experiments with Brownian Dynamics simulations with Hydrodynamic Interactions
(HI) included at the level of the Rotne-Prager tensor. That the inclusion of HI
is necessary to reproduce our experiments is evidence of their importance in
transmission of momentum through the system.
