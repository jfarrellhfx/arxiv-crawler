<h3>Negative electrohydrostatic pressure between superconducting bodies</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04903" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04903</a>

Despite being largely limited to bulk phenomena, well-known theoretical
models of superconductivity like the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer and
Ginzburg-Landau theories have played a key role in the development of
superconducting quantum devices. In this letter, we present a hydrodynamic
non-relativistic scalar electrodynamic theory capable of describing systems
comprising superconducting materials of arbitrary shape and apply it to predict
the existence of a negative (attractive) pressure between planar
superconducting bodies. For conventional superconductors with London
penetration depth $\lambda_\text{L} \approx 100 \text{ nm}$, the pressure
reaches tens of $\text{N/mm}^2$ at angstrom separations.

<h3>Three-stage thermalisation of a quasi-integrable system</h3>

We consider a system of classical hard rods or billiard balls in one
dimension, initially prepared in a Bragg-pulse state and subjected to external
periodic fields. We show that at late times the system always thermalises in
the thermodynamic limit via a 3-stages process characterised by: an early phase
where the dynamics is well described by Euler hydrodynamics, a subsequent where
a (weak) turbulent phase is observed and where hydrodynamics is broken, and a
final one where the gas quickly thermalise by diffusively spreading in the
phase space, and where (diffusive) hydrodynamics is restored. As the hard rod
gas share the same large-scale hydrodynamics as other quantum and classical
integrable systems, we expect these features to universally characterise all
many-body integrable system in generic external potentials.

Discovery of electron hydrodynamics in graphene system has opened a new scope
of analytic calculations in condensed matter physics, which was traditionally
well cultivated in science and engineering as a non-relativistic hydrodynamics
and in high energy nuclear and astro physics as relativistic hydrodynamics.
Electrons in graphene follow neither non-relativistic nor relativistic
hydrodynamics and thermodynamics. Present article has gone through systematic
microscopic calculations of thermodynamical quantities like pressure, energy
density, etc. of electron-fluid in graphene and compared with corresponding
estimations for non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic cases. Identifying the
Dirac fluid and Fermi liquid domains, we have sketched the transition of
temperature and Fermi energy dependency of electron thermodynamics for graphene
and other cases. An equivalent transition for quark matter is also discussed.
The most exciting part is the general expression of specific heat, whose Fermi
to Dirac fluid domain transition can be realized as a transition from a
solid-based to a fluid-based picture. This understanding may be connected to
the experimentally observed Wiedemann-Franz Law violation in the Dirac fluid
domain of graphene system.

<h3>Intrinsically/Purely Gapless-SPT from Non-Invertible Duality  Transformations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04788" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04788</a>
<br>
<i>Linhao Li, Masaki Oshikawa, Yunqin Zheng</i>

The Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformation was used to construct the gapped
symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase from the symmetry breaking phase
with open boundary condition, and was generalized in our proceeding work [L. Li
et al. arXiv:2301.07899] on a ring by sacrificing the unitarity, and should be
understood as a non-invertible duality transformation. In this work, we further
apply the KT transformation to systematically construct gapless symmetry
protected topological phases. This construction reproduces the known examples
of (intrinsically) gapless SPT where the non-trivial topological features come
from the gapped sectors by means of decorated defect constructions. We also
construct new (intrinsically) purely gapless SPTs where there are no gapped
sectors, hence are beyond the decorated defect construction. This construction
elucidates the field theory description of the various gapless SPTs, and can
also be applied to analytically study the stability of various gapless SPT
models on the lattice under certain symmetric perturbations.

<h3>Anomalous Andreev Bound States in Non-Hermitian Josephson Junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04789" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04789</a>

<i>Chang-An Li, Hai-Peng Sun, Björn Trauzettel</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a non-Hermitian Josephson junction composed of two s-wave
superconductors separated by a non-Hermitian barrier. We discover that the
Andreev bound states in such a non-Hermitian Josephson junction exhibit several
anomalous features: (i) the spectrum of Andreev bound states becomes
complex-valued; (ii) the spectrum exhibits a Josephson gap, a finite phase
window in which the existence of Andreev bound states is forbidden; and (iii)
the Andreev bound states give rise to a complex supercurrent, the imaginary
part of which signifies dissipative supercurrent. Moreover, in the case where
the two superconductors are of p-wave type, we observe the destruction of
Majorana zero modes due to the complex nature of Andreev bound state spectrum.
Our predictions should be observable in Josephson junctions coupled to the
environment.

<h3>Out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems with long-range  interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04802" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04802</a>
<br>
<i>Nicolò Defenu, Alessio Lerose, Silvia Pappalardi</i>
<br>
<br>
Experimental progress in atomic, molecular, and optical platforms in the last
decade has stimulated strong and broad interest in the quantum coherent
dynamics of many long-range interacting particles. The prominent collective
character of these systems enables novel non-equilibrium phenomena with no
counterpart in conventional quantum systems with local interactions. Much of
the theory work in this area either focussed on the impact of variable-range
interaction tails on the physics of local interactions or relied on
mean-field-like descriptions based on the opposite limit of all-to-all
infinite-range interactions. In this Report, we present a systematic and
organic review of recent advances in the field. Working with prototypical
interacting quantum spin lattices without disorder, our presentation hinges
upon a versatile theoretical formalism that interpolates between the few-body
mean-field physics and the many-body physics of quasi-local interactions. Such
a formalism allows us to connect these two regimes, providing both a formal
quantitative tool and basic physical intuition. We leverage this unifying
framework to review several findings of the last decade, including the peculiar
non-ballistic spreading of quantum correlations, counter-intuitive slowdown of
entanglement dynamics, suppression of thermalization and equilibration,
anomalous scaling of defects upon traversing criticality, dynamical phase
transitions, and genuinely non-equilibrium phases stabilized by periodic
driving. The style of this Report is on the pedagogical side, which makes it
accessible to readers without previous experience in the subject matter.

<h3>Controlling the electron-phonon heat exchange in a metallic film by its  position in a dielectric slab</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04814" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04814</a>
<br>
<i>D. V. Anghel, M. Dolineanu, J. Bergli, I. J. Maasilta</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically study the heat flux between electrons and phonons in a thin
metallic film embedded in a suspended dielectric slab (called a
\textit{membrane}, in accordance with the established nomenclature), forming a
layered structure. The thickness of the membrane is much smaller than the other
two dimensions and, in the considered temperature range, is comparable to the
dominant phonon wavelength. The thickness of the metallic layer is an order of
magnitude smaller than the thickness of the membrane. While the dependence of
the heat exchange on the thicknesses of the film and of the membrane has been
studied before, it is not yet known how this depends on the position of the
film inside the membrane. Here we show that the position strongly influences
the heat exchange. If we denote by $T_e$ the effective temperature of the
electrons in the metal and by $T_{ph}$ the effective temperature of the phonons
(assumed to be uniform in the entire system), then we may write in general the
heat power as $P \equiv P^{(0)}(T_e) - P^{(0)}(T_{ph})$, where $P^{(0)}(T)
\equiv P_s^{(0)}(T) + P_a^{(0)}(T)$, with $P_s^{(0)}(T)$ and $P_a^{(0)}(T)$
being the contributions of the symmetric and antisymmetric Lamb modes,
respectively. In the low-temperature limit, we may write $P_s^{(0)}(T) \equiv
C_s T^4$ and $P_a^{(0)}(T) \equiv C_a T^{3.5}$, where $C_s$ is independent of
the position of the film inside the membrane, whereas $C_a$ increases with the
distance between the mid-plane of the film and the mid-plane of the membrane,
being zero when the film is at the center of the membrane. Our examples show
that by changing the position of the film inside the membrane one may change
the electron-phonon heat power by orders of magnitude, depending on the
dimensions and the temperature range.

<h3>Double-Fourier engineering of Josephson energy-phase relationships  applied to diodes</h3>

<i>A. Mert Bozkurt, Jasper Brookman, Valla Fatemi, Anton R. Akhmerov</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a systematic method to design arbitrary energy-phase relations
using parallel arms of two series Josephson tunnel junctions each. Our approach
employs Fourier engineering in the energy-phase relation of each arm and the
position of the arms in real space. We demonstrate our method by engineering
the energy-phase relation of a near-ideal superconducting diode, which we find
to be robust against the imperfections in the design parameters. Finally, we
show the versatility of our approach by designing various other energy-phase
relations.

<h3>On the nature of the Schmid transition in a resistively shunted  Josephson junction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04835" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04835</a>
<br>
<i>Romain Daviet, Nicolas Dupuis</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the phase diagram of a resistively shunted Josephson junction (RSJJ)
in the framework of the boundary sine-Gordon model. Using the non-perturbative
functional renormalization group (FRG) we find that the transition is not
controlled by a single fixed point but by a line of fixed points, and compute
the continuously varying critical exponent $\nu$. We argue that the conductance
also varies continuously along the transition line. In contrast to the
traditional phase diagram of the RSJJ -- an insulating ground state when the
shunt resistance $R$ is larger than $R_q=h/(2e)^2$ and a superconducting one
when $R<R_q$ -- the FRG predicts the transition line in the plane
$(\alpha,E_J/E_C)$ to bend in the region $\alpha=R_q/R<1$ but we cannot discard
the possibility of a vertical line at $\alpha=1$ ($E_J$ and $E_C$ denote the
Josephson and charging energies of the junction, respectively). Our results
regarding the phase diagram and the nature of the transition are compared with
Monte Carlo simulations and numerical renormalization group results.

The simultaneous occurrence of electric-field controlled superconductivity
and spin-orbit interaction makes two-dimensional electron systems (2DES)
constructed from perovskite transition metal oxides promising candidates for
the next generation of spintronics and quantum computing. It is, however,
essential to understand the electronic bands thoroughly and verify the
predicted electronic states experimentally in these 2DES to advance
technological applications. Here, we present novel insights into the electronic
states of the 2DES at oxide interfaces through comprehensive investigations of
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in two different systems: EuO/KTaO$_3$ (EuO/KTO)
and LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ (LAO/STO). To accurately resolve these oscillations, we
conducted transport measurements in high magnetic fields up to 60 T and low
temperatures down to 100 mK. For 2D confined electrons at both interfaces, we
observed a progressive increase of oscillations frequency and cyclotron mass
with the magnetic field. We interpret these intriguing findings by considering
the existence of non-trivial electronic bands, for which the $E-k$ dispersion
incorporates both linear and parabolic dispersion relations. In addition to
providing experimental evidence for topological-like electronic states in
KTO-2DES and STO-2DES, the unconventional oscillations presented in this study
establish a new paradigm for quantum oscillations in 2DES based on perovskite
transition metal oxides, where the oscillations frequency exhibits quadratic
dependence on the magnetic field.

<h3>Doping driven metal-insulator transition in disordered graphene</h3>

Controlling the metal-insulator transition in graphene-based material is a
crucial topic as it directly impacts its potential applications. Inspired by
recent experiments, we study the effects of doping and bond disorder on
metal-insulator transition in graphene within the Hubbard model on a honeycomb
lattice. By using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we first conduct
tests on the value of <sign> under various parameters, such as electron
density, on-site interactions, temperature, and lattice size, so as to select
the appropriate parameters to alleviate the impact of the sign problem. Given
the knowledge that bond disorder can lead to a mental-insulator transition, our
study has revealed, after ruling out the influence of size effects, that the
critical strength of disorder increases as the electron density decreases while
decreasing as the on-site interactions increase. Furthermore, we compared our
results with experimental data and concluded that, in actual graphene
materials, the localization effect induced by doping plays a dominant role,
resulting in an insulating phase.

<h3>The angular dependence of spin-orbit torque in monolayer $Fe_3GeTe_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04900" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04900</a>
<br>
<i>Fei Xue, Mark D. Stiles, Paul M. Haney</i>
<br>
<br>
In ferromagnetic systems lacking inversion symmetry, an applied electric
field can control the ferromagnetic order parameters through the spin-orbit
torque. The prototypical example is a bilayer heterostructure composed of a
ferromagnet and a heavy metal that acts as a spin current source. In addition
to such bilayers, spin-orbit coupling can mediate spin-orbit torques in
ferromagnets that lack bulk inversion symmetry. A recently discovered example
is the two-dimensional monolayer ferromagnet $Fe_3GeTe_2$. In this work, we use
first-principles calculations to study the spin-orbit torque and ensuing
magnetic dynamics in this material. By expanding the torque versus
magnetization direction as a series of vector spherical harmonics, we find that
higher order terms (up to $\ell=4$) are significant and play important roles in
the magnetic dynamics. They give rise to deterministic, magnetic field-free
electrical switching of perpendicular magnetization.

<h3>Verifying a quasi-classical spin model of perturbed quantum rewinding in  a Fermi gas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04901" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04901</a>

<i>J. Huang, Camen A. Royse, I. Arakelyan, J. E. Thomas</i>
<br>

We systematically test a quasi-classical spin model of a large spin-lattice
in energy space, with a tunable, reversible Hamiltonian and effective
long-range interactions. The system is simulated by a weakly interacting Fermi
gas undergoing perturbed quantum rewinding using radio-frequency(RF) pulses.
The model reported here is found to be in a quantitative agreement with
measurements of the ensemble-averaged energy-resolved spin density. This work
elucidates the effects of RF detunings on the system and measurements, pointing
the way to new correlation measurement methods.

<h3>A theorem of Kohn applied to quantum oscillations in Cuprates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04919" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04919</a>
<br>
<i>Sudip Chakravarty</i>
<br>
<br>
In this note I apply a theorem of Kohn to quantum oscillations in cuprates. I
show that when combined with Gell-Mann and Low theorem, there is rigorous
justification of quantum oscillations as in a Fermi liquid for cuprates. The
Gell-Man-Low theorem is not perturbative, and applies more generally as long as
the adiabatic evolution from an isolated non-degenerate state is the case.
Oscillation frequencies are identical to the non-interacting problem. Thus,
quantum oscillations protect the Fermi liquid and is in turn protected by it.
This is not to imply that other properties of the cuprates that do not have a
gap in the spectrum could not exhibit non-Fermi liquid behavior, for example,
angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy.

<h3>Periodicity staircase in a Fe/Gd magnetic thin film</h3>

<br>
<br>
Presence of multiple competing periodicities may result in a system to go
through states with modulated periodicities, an example of which is the
self-similar staircase-like structure called the Devil's staircase. Herein we
report on a novel staircase structure of domain periodicity in an amorphous and
achiral Fe/Gd magnetic thin film wherein the reciprocal space wavevector
\textbf{Q} due to the ordered stripe domains does not evolve continuously,
rather exhibits a staircase structure. Resonant X-ray scattering experiments
show jumps in the periodicity of the stripe domains as a function of an
external magnetic field. When resolved in components, the step change along
Q$_x$ was found to be an integral multiple of a minimum step height of 7 nm,
which resembles closely to the exchange length of the system. Modeling the
magnetic texture in the Fe/Gd thin film as an achiral spin arrangement, we have
been able to reproduce the steps in the magnetization using a Landau-Lifshitz
spin dynamics calculation. Our results indicate that anisotropy and not the
dipolar interaction is the dominant cause for the staircase pattern, thereby
revealing the effect of achiral magnetism.

<h3>Viscous tweezers: controlling particles with viscosity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04948" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04948</a>
<br>
<i>Tali Khain, Michel Fruchart, Vincenzo Vitelli</i>
<br>
<br>
Control of particle motion is generally achieved by applying an external
field that acts directly on each particle. Here, we propose a global way to
manipulate the motion of a particle by dynamically changing the properties of
the fluid in which it is immersed. We exemplify this principle by considering a
small particle sinking in an anisotropic fluid whose viscosity depends on the
shear axis. In the Stokes regime, the motion of an immersed object is fully
determined by the viscosity of the fluid through the mobility matrix, which we
explicitly compute for a pushpin-shaped particle. Rather than falling upright
under the force of gravity, as in an isotropic fluid, the pushpin tilts to the
side, sedimenting at an angle determined by the viscosity anisotropy axis. By
changing this axis, we demonstate control over the pushpin orientation as it
sinks, even in the presence of noise, using a closed feedback loop. This
strategy to control particle motion, that we dub viscous tweezers, could be
experimentally realized in a fluid comprised of elongated molecules by suitably
changing their global orientation.

<h3>Ultra-fast Vacancy Migration: A Novel Approach for Synthesizing Sub-10  nm Crystalline Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanocrystals</h3>

<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs),
have the potential to revolutionize the field of electronics and photonics due
to their unique physical and structural properties. This research presents a
novel method for synthesizing crystalline TMDCs crystals with < 10 nm size
using ultra-fast migration of vacancies at elevated temperatures. Through
in-situ and ex-situ processing and using atomic-level characterization
techniques, we analyze the shape, size, crystallinity, composition, and strain
distribution of these nanocrystals. These nanocrystals exhibit electronic
structure signatures that differ from the 2D bulk i.e., uniform mono and
multilayers. Further, our in-situ, vacuum-based synthesis technique allows
observation and comparison of defect and phase evolution in these crystals
formed under van der Waals heterostructure confinement versus unconfined
conditions. Overall, this research demonstrates a solid-state route to
synthesizing uniform nanocrystals of TMDCs and lays the foundation for
materials science in confined 2D spaces under extreme conditions.

<h3>Tunable ferroelectricity in oxygen-deficient perovskites</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04972" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04972</a>
<br>
<i>Yongjin Shin, Giulia Galli</i>
<br>
<br>
Using first-principles calculations, we predict that tunable ferroelectricity
can be realized in oxide perovskites with the Grenier structure and ordered
oxygen vacancies. Specifically, we show that
$R_{1/3}A_{2/3}\mathrm{FeO}_{2.67}$ solids (where $R$ is a rare-earth ion and
$A$ an alkaline-earth cation) exhibit stable polar phases, with a spontaneous
polarization tunable by an appropriate choice of $R$ and $A$. We find that
larger cations combined with small $R$ elements lead to a maximum in the
polarization and to a minimum in the energy barriers required to switch the
sign of the polarization. Ferroelectricity arises from cooperative distortions
of octahedral and tetrahedral units, where a combination of rotational and
sliding modes controls the emergence of polarization within three-dimensional
connected layers. Our results indicate that polar Grenier phases of oxide
perovskites are promising materials for microelectronic applications and, in
general, for the study of phenomena emerging from breaking inversion symmetry
in solids.

<h3>Enhancement of Superconductivity in the Fibonacci Chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05009" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05009</a>
<br>
<i>Meng Sun, Tilen Čadež, Igor Yurkevich, Alexei Andreanov</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the interplay between quasi-periodic disorder and superconductivity
in a 1D tight-binding model with the quasi-periodic modulation of on-site
energies that follow the Fibonacci rule and all the eigenstates are
multifractal. As a signature of multifractality, we observe the power-law
dependence of the correlation between different single-particle eigenstates as
a function of their energy difference. By computing numerically the
superconducting transition temperature, we find the distribution of critical
temperatures, analyze their statistics and estimate the mean value and variance
of critical temperatures for various regimes of the attractive coupling
strength and quasi-periodic disorder. We find an enhancement of the critical
temperature as compared to the analytical results that are based on strong
assumptions of absence of correlations and self-averaging of multiple
characteristics of the system, which are not justified for the Fibonacci chain.
For the very weak coupling regime, we observe a crossover where the
self-averaging of the critical temperature breaks down completely and a strong
sample-to-sample fluctuations emerge.

<h3>Spin-splitting in electric-potential-difference antiferromagnetism</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05010" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05010</a>

<i>San-Dong Guo</i>
<br>
<br>
The antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials are robust to external magnetic
perturbation due to missing any net magnetic moment. In general, the spin
splitting in the band structures disappears in these antiferromagnets. However,
the altermagnetism can achieve spin-split bands in collinear
symmetry-compensated antiferromagnet with special magnetic space group. Here,
we propose a new mechanism that can achieve spin splitting in two-dimensional
(2D) Janus A-type AFM materials. Since the built-in electric field caused by
Janus structure creates a layer-dependent electrostatic potential, the
electronic bands in different layers will stagger, producing the spin
splitting, which can be called electric-potential-difference antiferromagnetism
(EPD-AFM). We demonstrate that Janus monolayer $\mathrm{Mn_2ClF}$ is a possible
candidate to achieve the EPD-AFM by the first-principles calculations. It is
proposed that the spin splitting can be tuned in EPD-AFM by piezoelectric
effect. Our works provide a new design principle for generating spin
polarization in 2D AFM materials.

lutetium hydride (LuH$_{3-\delta}$N$_{\epsilon}$) . Unfortunately, all
follow-up research still cannot find superconductivity signs in successfully
synthesized lutetium dihydride (LuH$_2$) and N-doped LuH$_{2\pm x}$N$_y$.
However, a similar intriguing observation was the pressure-induced color
changes (from blue to pink and subsequent red). The physical understanding of
its origin and the correlation between the color, crystal structure, and
chemical composition of Lu-H-N is still lacking. In this work, we theoretically
study the optical properties of LuH$_2$, LuH$_3$, and some potential N-doped
compounds using the first-principles calculations by considering both interband
and intraband contributions. Our results show that LuH$_2$ has an optical
reflectivity peak around blue light up to 10 GPa. Under higher pressure, the
reflectivity of red light gradually becomes dominant. This evolution is driven
by changes in the direct band gap and the Fermi velocity of free electrons
under pressure. In contrast, LuH$_3$ exhibits gray and no color change up to 50
GPa. Furthermore, we considered different types of N-doped LuH$_2$ and LuH$_3$.
We find that N-doped LuH$_2$ with the substitution of a hydrogen atom at the
tetrahedral position maintains the color change when the N-doping concentration
is low. As the doping level increases, this trend becomes less obvious. While
other N-doped structures do not show significant color change. Our results can
clarify the origin of the experimental observed blue-to-red color change in
lutetium hydride and also provide a further understanding of the potential
N-doped lutetium dihydride.

The influence of microstructure on thermoelectricity is increasingly
recognized. Approaches for microstructural engineering can hence be exploited
to enhance thermoelectric performance, particularly through manipulating
crystalline defects, their structure, and composition. Here, we focus on a
full-Heusler Fe2VAl-based compound that is one of the most promising
thermoelectric materials containing only Earth-abundant, non-toxic elements. A
Fe2VTa0.05Al0.95 cast alloy was atomized under a nitrogen-rich atmosphere to
induce nitride precipitation. Nanometer- to micrometer-scale microstructural
investigations by advanced scanning electron microscopy and atom probe
tomography (APT) are performed on the powder first and then on the material
consolidated by spark-plasma sintering for an increasing time. APT reveals an
unexpected pick-up of additional impurities from atomization, namely W and Mo.
The microstructure is then correlated with local and global measurements of the
thermoelectric properties. At grain boundaries, segregation and precipitation
locally reduce the electrical resistivity, as evidenced by in-situ four-point
probe measurements. The final microstructure contains a hierarchy of structural
defects, including individual point defects, dislocations, grain boundaries,
and precipitates, that allow for a strong decrease in thermal conductivity. In
combination, these effects provide an appreciable increase in thermoelectric
performance.

Semiconductor quantum dots are useful for controlling and observing quantum
states and can also be used as sensors for reading out quantum bits and
exploring local electronic states in nanostructures. However, challenges remain
for the sensor applications, such as the trade-off between sensitivity and
dynamic range and the issue of instability due to external disturbances. In
this study, we demonstrate proportional-integral-differential feedback control
of the radio-frequency reflectometry in GaN nanodevices using a
field-programmable gate array. This technique can maintain the operating point
of the charge sensor with high sensitivity. The system also realizes a wide
dynamic range and high sensor sensitivity through the monitoring of the
feedback signal. This method has potential applications in exploring dynamics
and instability of electronic and quantum states in nanostructures.

<h3>The curvature-induced magnetization in CrI3 bilayer: flexomagnetic  effect enhancement in van der Waals antiferromagnets</h3>

<br>
<br>
The bilayer of CrI3 is a prototypical van der Waals 2D antiferromagnetic
material with magnetoelectric effect. It is not generally known, however, that
for symmetry reasons the flexomagnetic effect, i.e., the strain
gradient-induced magnetization, is also possible in this material. In the
present paper, based on the first principle calculations, we estimate the
flexomagnetic effect to be 200 {\mu}B{\AA} that is two orders of magnitude
higher than it was predicted for the referent antiperovskite flexomagnetic
material Mn3GaN. The two major factors of flexomagnetic effect enhancement
related to the peculiarities of antiferromagnetic structure of van der Waals
magnets is revealed: the strain-dependent ferromagnetic coupling in each layer
and large interlayer distance separating antiferromagnetically coupled ions.
Since 2D systems are naturally prone to mechanical deformation, the emerging
field of flexomagnetism is of special interest for application in spintronics
of van der Waals materials and straintronics in particular.

<br>
<br>
We present a group theoretical and ab-initio analysis of lattice point
defects in fluorographene, with a focus on neutral and negative
$\text{V}_{\text{CF}}$ vacancies. By using a combination of density functional
theory calculations and group theory analysis, we investigate the many-body
configurations of the defects and calculate the vertical absorption and
zero-phonon line energies of the excited states and their dependence with
strain. The description of the defects is extended by computing their formation
energy, as well as further relevant parameters as the Jahn-Teller energy for
neutral $\text{V}_{\text{CF}}$ and the zero field splitting for negative
$\text{V}_{\text{CF}}$ vacancies. Based on our results, we discuss possible
quantum applications of these color centers when coupled to mechanical
oscillation modes of the hosting two-dimensional material. The symmetry and
active orbitals of the defects exhibit a parallelism with those of the
extensively studied NV centers in diamond. In this context, the studied defects
emerge as interesting candidates for the development of two-dimensional quantum
devices based on fluorographene.

Conductance of metallic heterostructures can be controlled by applying a gate
voltage to a region in the transport channel. For sufficiently long phase
coherent channels, oscillations appear in conductance versus chemical potential
plot, which can be explained by Fabry-P\'erot interference. In this work, we
study DC Josephson effect in a superconductor-normal metal-superconductor
junctions. The chemical potential of the normal metal (NM) region can be tuned
by an applied gate voltage. We numerically obtain the Andreev bound states
formed within the superconducting gap and calculate Josephson current by
summing up the currents carried by the occupied Andreev bound states. We find
that the Josephson current oscillates as a function of the chemical potential
in the NM region, and these oscillations can be explained by Fabry-P\'erot
interference condition. We find that Josephson current carried by one bound
state can be higher than that carried by two or more bound states.

<h3>Pseudomagnetic suppression of non-Hermitian skin effect</h3>

<br>
<i>Hau Tian Teo, Subhaskar Mandal, Yang Long, Haoran Xue, Baile Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
It has recently been shown that the non-Hermitian skin effect can be
suppressed by magnetic fields. In this work, using a two-dimensional
tight-binding lattice, we demonstrate that a pseudomagnetic field can also lead
to the suppression of the non-Hermitian skin effect. With an increasing
pseudomagnetic field, the skin modes are found to be pushed into the bulk,
accompanied by the reduction of skin topological area and the restoration of
Landau level energies. Our results provide a time-reversal invariant route to
localization control and could be useful in various classical wave devices that
are able to host the non-Hermitian skin effect but inert to magnetic fields.

<h3>Charge conservation in spin torque oscillators leads to a self-induced  torque</h3>

<br>
<br>
Spin torque oscillators are conventionally described by the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation. However, at the onset of
oscillations, the predictions of the conventional LLGS equation differ
qualitatively from experimental results and thus appear to be incomplete. In
this work we show that taking charge conservation into account leads to a
previously-overlooked self-induced torque, which modifies the LLGS equation. We
show that the self-induced torque originates from the pumping current that a
precessing magnetization drives through a magnetic tunnel junction. To
illustrate the importance of the self-induced torque, we consider an in-plane
magnetized nanopillar, where it gives clear qualitative corrections to the
conventional LLGS description.

Generating photogalvanic effects in centrosymmetric materials can provide new
opportunities for developing passive photodetectors and energy harvesting
devices. In this work, we investigate the photogalvanic effects in
centrosymmetric two-dimensional materials, AA- and AB-stacked bilayer graphene,
by applying an external gate voltage to break the symmetry. Using a
tight-binding model to describe the electronic states, the injection
coefficients for circular photogalvanic effects and shift conductivities for
linear photogalvanic effects are calculated for both materials with light
wavelengths ranging from THz to visible. We find that gate voltage induced
photogalvanic effects can be very significant for AB-stacked bilayer graphene,
with generating a maximal dc current in the order of mA for a 1 $\mu$m wide
sample illuminated by a light intensity of 0.1 GW/cm$^2$, which is determined
by the optical transition around the band gap and van Hove singularity points.
Although such effects in AA-stacked bilayer graphene are about two orders of
magnitude smaller than those in AB-stacked bilayer graphene, the spectrum is
interestingly limited in a very narrow photon energy window, which is
associated with the interlayer coupling strength. A detailed analysis of the
light polarization dependence is also performed. The gate voltage and chemical
potential can be used to effectively control the photogalvanic effects.

<h3>Dynamics of orbital degrees of freedom probed via isotope $^{121,123}$  Sb nuclear quadrupole moments in Sb-substituted iron-pnictide superconductors</h3>

<br>
<br>
Isotope $^{121,123}$Sb nuclei with large electric quadrupole moments are
applied to investigate the dynamics of orbital degrees of freedom in
Sb-substituted iron(Fe)-based compounds. In the parent compound
LaFe(As$_{0.6}$Sb$_{0.4}$)O, the nuclear spin relaxation rate
$^{121,123}(T_{1}^{-1})$ at $^{121,123}$Sb sites was enhanced at structural
transition temperature ($T_{s}\sim$ 135 K), which is higher than N\'eel
temperature ($T_{\rm N}\sim$125 K). The isotope ratio
$^{123}(T_{1}^{-1})/^{121}(T_{1}^{-1})$ indicates that the electric quadrupole
relaxation due to the dynamical electric field gradient at Sb site increases
significantly toward $T_{s}$. It is attributed to the critically enhanced
nematic fluctuations of stripe-type arrangement of Fe-$3d_{xz}$ (or $3d_{yz}$)
orbitals. In the lightly electron-doped superconducting (SC) compound
LaFe(As$_{0.7}$Sb$_{0.3}$)(O$_{0.9}$F$_{0.1}$), the nematic fluctuations are
largely suppressed in comparison with the case of the parent compound, however,
it remains a small enhancement below 80 K down to the $T_c$($\sim$ 20 K). The
results indicate that the fluctuations from both the spin and orbital degrees
of freedom on the $3d_{xz}$(or $3d_{yz}$) orbitals can be seen in lightly
electron-doped SC state of LaFeAsO-based compounds. We emphasize that isotope
$^{121,123}$Sb quadrupole moments are sensitive local probe to identify the
dynamics of orbital degrees of freedom in Fe-pnictides, which provides with a
new opportunity to discuss the microscopic correlation between the
superconductivity and both nematic and spin fluctuations simultaneously even in
the polycrystalline samples.

<h3>Topological interface states -- a possible path towards a Landau-level  laser in the THz regime</h3>

<br>
<br>
Volkov-Pankratov surface bands arise in smooth topological interfaces, i.e.
interfaces between a topological and a trivial insulator, in addition to the
chiral surface state imposed by the bulk-surface correspondence of topological
materials. These two-dimensional bands become Landau-quantized if a magnetic
field is applied perpendicular to the interface. I show that the energy scales,
which are typically in the 10-100 meV range, can be controlled both by the
perpendicular magnetic field and the interface width. The latter can still be
varied with the help of a magnetic-field component in the interface. The Landau
levels of the different Volkov-Pankratov bands are optically coupled, and their
arrangement may allow one to obtain population inversion by resonant optical
pumping. This could serve as the elementary brick of a multi-level laser based
on Landau levels. Moreover, the photons are absorbed and emitted either
parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field, respectively in the Voigt and
Faraday geometry, depending on the Volkov-Pankratov bands and Landau levels
involved in the optical transitions.

<h3>Coherent phonon and unconventional carriers in the magnetic kagome metal  Fe$_3$Sn$_2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Temperature- and fluence-dependent carrier dynamics of the magnetic Kagome
metal Fe$_3$Sn$_2$ were studied using the ultrafast optical pump-probe
technique. Two carrier relaxation processes ($\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$) and a laser
induced coherent optical phonon were observed. By using the two-temperature
model for metals, we ascribe the shorter relaxation $\tau_1$ (~1 ps) to hot
electrons transferring their energy to the crystal lattice via electron-phonon
scattering. $\tau_2$ (~25 ps), on the other hand, cannot be explained as a
conventional process and is attributed to the unconventional (localized)
carriers in the material. The observed coherent oscillation is assigned to be a
totally symmetric A$_{1g}$ optical phonon dominated by Sn displacements out of
the Kagome planes, and possesses a prominently large amplitude, on the order of
10$^{-3}$, comparable to the maximum of the reflectivity change ($\Delta$R/R).
This amplitude is equivalent to charge-density-wave (CDW) systems, although no
signs of such an instability were hitherto reported in Fe$_3$Sn$_2$. Our
results set an unexpected connection between Fe$_3$Sn$_2$ and kagome metals
with CDW instabilities, and suggest a unique interplay between phonon and
electron dynamics in this compound.

<h3>Shot Noise as a Diagnostic in the Fractional Quantum Hall Edge Zoo</h3>

Bulk-boundary correspondence allows one to probe the bulk topological order
by studying the transport properties of the edge modes. However, edge modes in
a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state can undergo edge reconstruction;
moreover, they can be in the coherent regime or exhibit varying degrees of
charge and thermal equilibration, giving rise to a zoo of intriguing scenarios.
Even more possibilities arise when a quantum point contact (QPC) is introduced
and tuned into a conductance plateau. Distinguishing among the different models
and equilibration regimes is an outstanding problem, which cannot be resolved
by dc electrical conductance measurement. In this work we show that
\emph{electrical shot noise} at a QPC conductance plateau can serve as such
diagnostic. As a prototypical example we consider the $\nu=2/3$ FQH state, and
show that different inequalities between the auto- and cross-correlation
electrical shot noise hold for different edge models. In particular, our
results offer several possible scenarios for the QPC conductance plateaus
$e^2/3h$ (observed previously), $e^2/2h$ (recently observed), and $5e^2/9h$
(our prediction), as well as how to distinguish among them via shot noise.

The $\nu = 2/3$ filling is the simplest paradigmatic example of a fractional
quantum Hall state, which contains counter-propagating edge modes. These modes
can be either in the coherent or equilibrated to different extents, on top of
the possible edge reconstruction. In the coherent regime, two distinct
renormalization group fixed points have been previously proposed, namely
Kane-Fischer-Polchinski and Wang-Meir-Gefen. In the equilibration regime,
different degree of thermal equilibration can exist, while charge is fully
equilibrated. Here, we show that these rich variety of models can give rise to
three possible conductance plateaus at $e^2/2h$ (recently observed in
experiments), $5e^2/9h$ (we predict), and $e^2/3h$ (observed earlier in
experiments) in a quantum point contact geometry. We identify different
mechanisms for \emph{electrical shot noise} generation at these plateaus, which
provides an experimentally accessible venue for distinguishing among the
distinct models.

We present a general method to identify topological materials by studying the
local electronic density $\delta \rho \left(\boldsymbol{r}\right)$. More
specifically, certain types of defects or spatial textures such as vacancies,
turn graphene into a topological material characterised by invariant Chern or
winding numbers. We show that these numbers are directly accessible from a
dislocation pattern of $\delta \rho \left(\boldsymbol{r}\right)$, resulting
from an interference effect induced by topological defects. For non topological
defects such as adatoms, this pattern is scrambled by Friedel oscillations
absent in topological cases. A Kekule distortion is discussed and shown to be
equivalent to a vacancy.

The interrelationship between localization, quantum transport, and disorder
has remained a fascinating focus in scientific research. Traditionally, it has
been widely accepted in the physics community that in one-dimensional systems,
as disorder increases, localization intensifies, triggering a metal-insulator
transition. However, a recent theoretical investigation [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126,
106803] has revealed that the interplay between dimerization and disorder leads
to a reentrant localization transition, constituting a remarkable theoretical
advancement in the field. Here, we present the experimental observation of
reentrant localization using an experimentally friendly model, a photonic SSH
lattice with random-dimer disorder, achieved by incrementally adjusting
synthetic potentials. In the presence of correlated on-site potentials, certain
eigenstates exhibit extended behavior following the localization transition as
the disorder continues to increase. We directly probe the wave function in
disordered lattices by exciting specific lattice sites and recording the light
distribution. This reentrant phenomenon is further verified by observing an
anomalous peak in the normalized participation ratio. Our study enriches the
understanding of transport in disordered mediums and accentuates the
substantial potential of integrated photonics for the simulation of intricate
condensed matter physics phenomena.

Additive manufacturing (AM) of multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) has
gained significant attention in recent years. However, the intricate nature of
phenomena such as rapid solidification, heat gradients, and residual stresses
presents challenges in controlling the properties of printed components. To
overcome these challenges, this study utilized machine learning (ML) approach
to investigate the correlations between composition, processing parameters,
testing conditions, and yield strength of single-phase MPEAs within the
CoCrFeMnNi system, produced via laser-melt deposition and laser powder-bed
fusion. Multiple algorithms, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and
Extreme Gradient Boosting, were trained, and tested. SHapley Additive
exPlanations algorithm was employed to analyze the contributions of input
features. All models exhibited reasonable accuracy, with Random Forest
performing the best. The impact of data sparsity was examined, and minimal
sensitivity to data splitting was observed. Notably, the research yielded
valuable insights into the key features influencing the yield strength of
MPEAs, showcasing the potential of ML in accurately modeling the material
properties of additively manufactured components.

We have looked into the structural, mechanical, optoelectronic,
superconducting state and thermophysical aspects of intermetallic compound
Zr$_3$Ir using the density functional theory (DFT). Many of the physical
properties, including direction dependent mechanical properties, Vickers
hardness, optical properties, chemical bonding nature, and charge density
distributions, are being investigated for the first time. According to this
study, Zr$_3$Ir exhibits ductile features, high machinability, significant
metallic bonding, a low Vickers hardness with low Debye temperature, and a
modest level of elastic anisotropy. The mechanical and dynamical stabilities of
Zr$_3$Ir have been confirmed. The metallic nature of Zr$_3$Ir is seen in the
electronic band structures with a high electronic energy density of states at
the Fermi level. The bonding nature has been explored by the charge density
mapping and bond population analysis. The tetragonal Zr$_3$Ir shows a
remarkable electronic stability, as confirmed by the presence of a pseudogap in
the electronic energy density of states at the Fermi level between the bonding
and antibonding states. Optical parameters show very good agreement with the
electronic properties. The reflectivity spectra reveal that Zr$_3$Ir is a good
reflector in the infrared and near-visible regions. Zr$_3$Ir is an excellent
ultra-violet (UV) radiation absorber. High refractive index at visible photon
energies indicates that Zr$_3$Ir could be used to improve the visual aspects of
electronic displays. All the optical constants exhibit a moderate degree of
anisotropy. Zr$_3$Ir has a moderate melting point, high damage tolerance, and
very low minimum thermal conductivity. The thermomechanical characteristics of
Zr$_3$Ir reveal that it is a potential thermal barrier coating material. The
superconducting state parameters of Zr$_3$Ir are also explored.

We combine ab-initio calculations based on many-body perturbation theory and
the cumulant expansion with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)
to quantify the electron-plasmon interaction in the highly-doped semiconducting
transition metal dichalcogenide 1$T$-HfS$_2$. ARPES reveals the emergence of
satellite spectral features in the vicinity of quasiparticle excitations at the
bottom of the conduction band, suggesting coupling to bosonic excitations with
a characteristic energy of 200 meV. Our first-principles calculations of the
photoemission spectral function reveal that these features can be ascribed to
electronic coupling to carrier plasmons (doping-induced collective
charge-density fluctuations). We further show that reduced screening at the
surface enhances the electron-plasmon interaction and is primarily responsible
for the emergence of plasmonic polarons.

The expanded phthalocyanine (EPc) single-layer sheets with double transition
metals (labeled as TM2EPc, TM = Sc-Zn) are predicted to be a new class of
two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic materials with a series of favorable
functional properties by means of systematic first-principle calculations and
molecular dynamics simulations. The strong coordination between metal and EPc
substrate accounts for the excellent structural stability. Chemical bonding
analysis has demonstrated the absence of TM-TM bonding. Each metal center is
isolated, but connected to the organic framework by four 2c-2e TM-N
{\sigma}-bonds to form an extended 2D network. Unexpectedly, it is found that
the V2EPc is an antiferromagnetic metal with Dirac cone, while Cr2EPc exhibits
ferromagnetic Dirac half-metallicity, which is not common in 2D materials.
Excitingly, the ferromagnetic Cr2EPc and antiferromagnetic Mn2- and Fe2-EPc
have high magnetic transition temperatures of 223, 217, and 325 K,
respectively, which are crucial for the practical applications of spintronics.
Cr2EPc can maintain the Dirac half-metallicity under -6 % ~ 2 % biaxial
strains, and Fe2EPc can transform from semiconductor to half-metal by applying
-6 % ~ -10 % compressive strains. Additionally, the TM2EPc monolayers exhibit a
full response to visible light and some materials have strong absorption in the
ultraviolet and infrared regions in addition to visible light, showing
extraordinary solar light-harvesting ability. Notably, the designed type-II
heterojunctions Fe2EPc/SnC, Co2EPc/GeS, and Ni2EPc/2H-WSe2 have high power
conversion efficiency (PCE > 15%), especially the PCE of Ni2EPc/2H-WSe2 reaches
25.19%, which has great potential in solar cell applications. All these desired
properties render 2D TM2EPc monolayers promising candidates for future
applications in nanoelectronics, spintronics,optoelectronics, and photovoltaic

immersed in active nematics. This is illustrated for discs with tilted
anchoring and chiral cogs, for which we determine the nematic director through
conformal mappings. Our analysis identifies two regimes of behaviour for chiral
cogs: orientation-dependent handedness and persistent active rotation. Finally,
we provide design principles for active nematic colloids to achieve desired
rotational dynamics.

<br>
The Brownian gyrator (BG) is a minimal model of a nano-engine performing a
rotational motion, judging solely upon the fact that in non-equilibrium
conditions its torque, angular momentum ${\cal L}$ and angular velocity $\cal
W$ have non-zero mean values. For a time-discretized model, we calculate the
previously unknown probability density functions (PDFs) of ${\cal L}$ and $\cal
W$. We find that when the time-step $\delta t \to 0$, both PDFs converge to
uniform distributions with diverging variances. For finite $\delta t$, the PDF
of ${\cal L}$ has exponential tails and all moments, but its noise-to-signal
ratio is generically much bigger than $1$. The PDF of ${\cal W}$ exhibits heavy
power-law tails and its mean ${\cal W}$ is the only existing moment. The BG is
therefore not an engine in common sense: it does not exhibit regular rotations
on each run and its fluctuations are not only a minor nuisance.
Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations and
experimental data. We discuss some improvements of the model which may result
in a more systematic behavior.

Inorganic/organic hybrid systems offer great technological potential for
novel solar cell design due to the combination of high charge carrier
mobilities in the inorganic semiconductor with the chemical tuneability of
organic chromophore absorption properties. While ZnO basically exhibits all
necessary properties for a successful application in light-harvesting, it was
clearly outpaced by TiO$_2$ in terms of charge separation efficiency. The
physical origin of this deficiency is still under debate. Here, we use a
combination of femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy with
many-body ab initio calculations to demonstrate that optical excitation of the
chromophore is followed by (1) ultrafast electron transfer into the ZnO bulk
(350 fs), (2) electron relaxation, and (3) delayed (100 ps) recapture of the
electrons at a 1 nm distance from the interface in (4) a strongly bound (0.7
eV) hybrid exciton state with a lifetime exceeding 5 $\mu$s that is analysed by
taking into account pump-probe delay-dependent photostationary population
dynamics. Beyond this identification and quantification of all elementary steps
leading to the suppression of charge separation at ZnO interfaces, our key
finding is the substantially delayed hybrid exciton formation. It opens up a
sufficiently large time window for counter-measures with the potential to
finally successfully implement ZnO in light-harvesting or optoelectronic
devices without significant efficiency losses.

<h3>Kibble-Zurek Mechanism for Nonequilibrium Generation of Magnetic  Monopoles in Spin Ices</h3>

<br>
<br>
The proliferation of topological defects is a common out-of-equilibrium
phenomenon when a system is driven into a phase of broken symmetry. The
Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) provides a theoretical framework for the critical
dynamics and generation of topological defects in such scenarios. One of the
early applications of KZM is the estimation of heavy magnetic monopoles left
behind by the cosmological phase transitions in the early universe. The
scarcity of such relic monopoles, which contradicts the prediction of KZM, is
one of the main motivations for cosmological inflationary theories. On the
other hand, magnetic monopoles as emergent quasi-particles have been observed
in spin ices, a peculiar class of frustrated magnets that remain disordered at
temperatures well below the energy scale of exchange interaction. Here we study
the annihilation dynamics of magnetic monopoles when spin ice is cooled to zero
temperature in a finite time. Through extensive Glauber dynamics simulations,
we find that the density of residual monopole follows a power law dependence on
the annealing rate. A kinetic reaction theory that precisely captures the
annihilation process from Monte Carlo simulations is developed. We further show
that the KZM can be generalized to describe the critical dynamics of spin ice,
where the exponent of the power-law behavior is determined by the dynamic
critical exponent $z$ and the cooling protocol.

We describe the formation of swift heavy ion tracks in polyethylene (PE) by
combining the Monte Carlo code TREKIS, which models electronic excitation in
nanometric proximity of the ion trajectory, with the molecular dynamics
simulating a response of the atomic system to the perturbation. The model
predicts circular tracks in amorphous PE but elliptical ones in crystalline PE
caused by preferential propagation of excitation along polymer chains during
the cooling stage. The obtained track sizes and shapes agree well with the
high-resolution microscopy of tracks in PE. The velocity effect in PE is shown:
the track parameters differ for ions with the same energy losses but different
velocities.

We present first-principles quantum transport simulations of single-walled
carbon nanotubes based on the NEGF method and including carrier-carrier
interactions within the self-consistent GW approximation. Motivated by the
characteristic enhancement of interaction between charge carriers in
one-dimensional systems, we show that the developed framework can predict Auger
recombination, hot carrier relaxation, and impact ionization in this type of
nanostructures. Using the computed scattering rates, we infer the inverse
electron-hole pair lifetimes for different Auger processes in several device

<h3>Phases of (2+1)D SO(5) non-linear sigma model with a topological term on  a sphere: multicritical point and disorder phase</h3>

<br>
Novel critical phenomena beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm have been
long sought after. Among many candidate scenarios, the deconfined quantum
critical point (DQCP) constitutes the most fascinating one, and its lattice
model realization has been debated over the past two decades. Here we apply the
spherical Landau level regularization upon the exact (2+1)D SO(5) non-linear
sigma model with a topological term to study the potential DQCP therein.
Utilizing the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group method with
explicit $\text{SU(2)}_\text{spin}\times\text{U(1)}_\text{charge}$ symmetries,
accompanied by quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we accurately obtain the
comprehensive phase diagram of the model on a sphere with unprecedentedly large
system sizes. We find various novel quantum phases, including a N\'eel state, a
ferromagnet (FM), a valence bond solid (VBS) state, a valley polarized (VP)
state and quantum disordered phase occupying extended area of the phase
diagram. However, notably missing in the phase diagram is the DQCP between
different symmetry-breaking phases. Instead, our results show that two
different symmetry-breaking phases, i.e., the SO(2)-breaking VBS and the
SO(3)-breaking N\'eel states, are separated by either a weakly first-order
transition or the disordered region with a multicritical point in between, thus
opening up more interesting questions on this two-decade long debate on the
nature of DQCP.

<h3>Raman spectroscopy of active-carbon electrodes when Au colloids are  placed at the electrolyte/electrode interface</h3>

<br>
<br>
In the past, when Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) were placed just above (but not
included in) active carbon (A-C) electrodes, a 10-fold amplification of
gravitational specific capacitance were demonstrated, despite the small
mass-ratio between the AuNPs and A-C; a ratio of 1:5000. We use surface enhance
Raman spectroscopy (SERS) in further studying this system. Supercapacitors are
volumetric elements while SERS is a surface interrogating method, whose signal
could be impacted by many factors, including local colloid's preferential
points (hot spots). Here, we use the ratio between the D- and G-lines of the
A-C electrode, ID/IG, as a marker to eliminate the surface inconsistencies. At
some concentration levels of AuNPs, the A-C Raman signature shows a clear
preference towards the 1600 cm-1 vibration mode (G-line). Following that point,
the cell exhibits a large specific capacitance.

<br>
Slip intermittency and stress oscillations in titanium alloy Ti-7Al-O that
were observed using in-situ far-field high energy X-ray diffraction microscopy
(ff-HEDM) are investigated using a discrete dislocation plasticity (DDP) model.
The mechanistic foundation of slip intermittency and stress oscillations are
shown to be dislocation escape from obstacles during stress holds, governed by
a thermal activation constitutive law. The stress drop events due to <a>-basal
slip are larger in magnitude than those along <a>-prism, which is a consequence
of their differing rate sensitivities, previously found from micropillar
testing. It is suggested that interstitial oxygen suppresses stress
oscillations by inhibiting the thermal activation process. Understanding of
these mechanisms is of benefit to the design and safety assessment of jet
engine titanium alloys subjected to dwell fatigue.

We study charge and heat transport in the square lattice Hubbard model at
strong coupling using the finite-temperature Lanczos method. We construct the
diffusion matrix and estimate the effect of thermoelectric terms on the
diffusive time evolution. The thermoelectric terms prevent the interpretation
of the diffusion in terms of a single time scale. We discuss our results in
relation to cold-atom experiments and measurements of heat conductivity based
on the measurements of heat diffusion.

state in a three-dimensional (3D) photonic crystal (PhC) with a complete
photonic bandgap. Two types of cubic lattices were designed with different
topological invariants, which were theoretically and numerically confirmed by
the finite difference of their Zak phases. Topological boundary states in the
two-dimensional interfaces and hinge states in the one-dimensional corners were
formed according to the higher-order of bulk-boundary correspondence. Microwave
measurements of the fabricated 3D PhC containing two boundaries and one corner
showed a localized intensity, which confirmed the boundary and hinge states.

<br>
The binary fluorite oxide Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 tends to grab a significant amount of
notice due to the distinct and superior ferroelectricity found in its
metastable phase. Stabilizing the metastable ferroelectric phase and
delineating the underlying growth mechanism, however, are still challenging.
Recent discoveries of metastable ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 epitaxially grown
on structurally dissimilar perovskite oxides have triggered intensive
investigations on the ferroelectricity in materials that are nonpolar in bulk
form. Nonetheless, the growth mechanism for the unique fluorite/perovskite
heterostructures has yet to be fully explored. Here we show that the metastable
ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 films can be stabilized even on a
one-unit-cell-thick perovskite La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 buffer layer. In collaboration
with scanning transmittance electron microscopy (STEM) based characterizations,
we show that monolayer reconstruction driven by interfacial redox reactions
plays a vital role in the formation of a unique heterointerface between the two
structurally dissimilar oxides, providing the template monolayer that
facilitates the epitaxial growth of the metastable HZO films. Our findings
offer significant insights into the stabilization mechanism of the
ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2, and this mechanism could be extended for exploring
functional metastable phases of various metal oxides.

<br>
<br>
The Tauc plot method is widely used to determine the bandgap of
semiconductors via UV-visible optical spectroscopy due to its simplicity and
perceived accuracy. However, the actual Tauc plot often exhibits significant
baseline absorption below the expected bandgap, leading to discrepancies in the
calculated bandgap depending on whether the linear fit is extrapolated to zero
or non-zero baseline. In this study, we show that both extrapolation methods
can produce significant errors by simulating Tauc plots with varying levels of
baseline absorption. To address this issue, we propose a new method that
involves idealizing the absorption spectrum by removing its baseline before
constructing the Tauc plot. Experimental verification of this method using a
gallium phosphide (GaP) wafer with intentionally introduced baseline
absorptions shows promising results. Furthermore, we apply this new method to
cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs) and resolve discrepancies in c-BAs bandgap values
reported by different groups, obtaining a converging bandgap of 1.835 eV based
on both previous and new transmission spectra. The method is applicable to both
indirect and direct bandgap semiconductors, regardless of whether the
absorption spectrum is measured via transmission or diffuse reflectance, will
become essential to obtain accurate values of their bandgaps.

We introduce M$^2$Hub, a toolkit for advancing machine learning in materials
discovery. Machine learning has achieved remarkable progress in modeling
molecular structures, especially biomolecules for drug discovery. However, the
development of machine learning approaches for modeling materials structures
lag behind, which is partly due to the lack of an integrated platform that
enables access to diverse tasks for materials discovery. To bridge this gap,
M$^2$Hub will enable easy access to materials discovery tasks, datasets,
machine learning methods, evaluations, and benchmark results that cover the
entire workflow. Specifically, the first release of M$^2$Hub focuses on three
key stages in materials discovery: virtual screening, inverse design, and
molecular simulation, including 9 datasets that covers 6 types of materials
with 56 tasks across 8 types of material properties. We further provide 2
synthetic datasets for the purpose of generative tasks on materials. In
addition to random data splits, we also provide 3 additional data partitions to
reflect the real-world materials discovery scenarios. State-of-the-art machine
learning methods (including those are suitable for materials structures but
never compared in the literature) are benchmarked on representative tasks. Our
codes and library are publicly available at https://github.com/yuanqidu/M2Hub.

Graph neural networks are widely used in machine learning applied to
chemistry, and in particular for material science discovery. For crystalline
materials, however, generating graph-based representation from geometrical
information for neural networks is not a trivial task. The periodicity of
crystalline needs efficient implementations to be processed in real-time under
a massively parallel environment. With the aim of training graph-based
generative models of new material discovery, we propose an efficient tool to
generate cutoff graphs and k-nearest-neighbours graphs of periodic structures
within GPU optimization. We provide pyMatGraph a Pytorch-compatible framework
to generate graphs in real-time during the training of neural network
architecture. Our tool can update a graph of a structure, making generative
models able to update the geometry and process the updated graph during the
forward propagation on the GPU side. Our code is publicly available at

Machine Learning models have emerged as a powerful tool for fast and accurate
prediction of different crystalline properties. Exiting state-of-the-art models
rely on a single modality of crystal data i.e. crystal graph structure, where
they construct multi-graph by establishing edges between nearby atoms in 3D
space and apply GNN to learn materials representation. Thereby, they encode
local chemical semantics around the atoms successfully but fail to capture
important global periodic structural information like space group number,
crystal symmetry, rotational information, etc, which influence different
crystal properties. In this work, we leverage textual descriptions of materials
to model global structural information into graph structure and learn a more
robust and enriched representation of crystalline materials. To this effect, we
first curate a textual dataset for crystalline material databases containing
descriptions of each material. Further, we propose CrysMMNet, a simple
multi-modal framework, which fuses both structural and textual representation
together to generate a joint multimodal representation of crystalline
materials. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets across
ten different properties to show that CrysMMNet outperforms existing
state-of-the-art baseline methods with a good margin. We also observe that
fusing the textual representation with crystal graph structure provides
consistent improvement for all the SOTA GNN models compared to their own
vanilla versions. We have shared the textual dataset, that we have curated for
both the benchmark material databases, with the community for future use.

<h3>Simplicial Message Passing for Chemical Property Prediction</h3>

Recently, message-passing Neural networks (MPNN) provide a promising tool for
dealing with molecular graphs and have achieved remarkable success in
facilitating the discovery and materials design with desired properties.
However, the classical MPNN methods also suffer from a limitation in capturing
the strong topological information hidden in molecular structures, such as
nonisomorphic graphs. To address this problem, this work proposes a Simplicial
Message Passing (SMP) framework to better capture the topological information
from molecules, which can break through the limitation within the vanilla
message-passing paradigm. In SMP, a generalized message-passing framework is
established for aggregating the information from arbitrary-order simplicial
complex, and a hierarchical structure is elaborated to allow information
exchange between different order simplices. We apply the SMP framework within
deep learning architectures for quantum-chemical properties prediction and
achieve state-of-the-art results. The results show that compared to traditional
MPNN, involving higher-order simplex can better capture the complex structure
of molecules and substantially enhance the performance of tasks. The SMP-based
model can provide a generalized framework for GNNs and aid in the discovery and
design of materials with tailored properties for various applications.

Atomic diffusion in solids is an important process in various phenomena.
However, atomistic simulations of diffusion processes are confronted with the
timescale problem: the accessible simulation time is usually far shorter than
that of experimental interests. In this work, we developed a long-timescale
method using reinforcement learning that simulates diffusion processes. As a
testbed, we simulate hydrogen diffusion in pure metals and a medium entropy
alloy, CrCoNi, getting hydrogen diffusivity reasonably consistent with previous
experiments. We also demonstrate that our method can accelerate the sampling of
low-energy configurations compared to the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm using
hydrogen migration to copper (111) surface sites as an example.

<br>
<br>
We study the diffusivity of a tagged particle in a binary mixture of Brownian
particles with non-reciprocal interactions. Numerical simulations reveal that,
for a broad class of interaction potentials, non-reciprocity can significantly
increase the effective diffusion coefficient of tracer particles, and that this
diffusion enhancement is associated with a breakdown of the Einstein relation.
These observations are quantified and confirmed via two different and
complementary analytical approaches: (i) a linearized stochastic density field
theory, which is particularly accurate in the limit of soft interactions; (ii)
a reduced two-body description, which is exact at leading order in the density
of particles. The latter reveals that diffusion enhancement can be attributed
to the formation of transiently propelled dimers of particles, whose cohesion
and speed are controlled by the non-reciprocal interactions.

Vector magnetometry provides more information than scalar measurements for
magnetic surveys utilized in space, defense, medical, geological and industrial
applications. These areas would benefit from a mobile vector magnetometer that
can operate in extreme conditions. Here we present a scanning fiber-coupled
nitrogen vacancy (NV) center vector magnetometer. Feedback control of the
microwave excitation frequency is employed to improve dynamic range and
maintain sensitivity during movement of the sensor head. Tracking of the
excitation frequency shifts for all four orientations of the NV center allow us
to image the vector magnetic field of a damaged steel plate. We calculate the
magnetic tensor gradiometry images in real time, and they allow us to detect
smaller damage than is possible with vector or scalar imaging.

<br>
<br>
The melting curve of pure silica (SiO$_2$) was determined using {\it ab
initio} density functional theory together with the solid-liquid coexistence
approach, thermodynamic integration and the Z method. The melting curves show a
smooth slow increase in a large region from 50 GPa (dT/dP $\approx$ 10 K/GPa)
to about 500 GPa (dT/dP $\approx$ 6 K/GPa) without any abrupt changes at around
120 GPa and 300 GPa as seen in some recent experimental and computational
studies. The topography of the melting curve above 50 GPa is consistent with a
gradual change in the distribution of the Si coordination numbers in the liquid
state and the absence of large changes in the density following solid-solid
phase transitions. The pair distribution functions show that the structural
correlation in the liquid is mainly short-ranged and that the Si-O bond is
stiff. The densification of the melt structure with pressure above 50 GPa is
therefore due to an increase in 7- and 8-fold coordinated silicon.

<i>Praveen Kumar, Rajarshi Chakrabarti</i>
<br>
<br>
We perform computer simulations to explore the escape dynamics of a
self-propelled (active) nanorod from circular confinement with narrow
opening(s). Our results clearly demonstrate how the persistent and directed
motion of the nanorod helps it to escape. Such escape events are absent if the
nanorod is passive. To quantify the dynamics, we compute the radial probability
density function (RPDF) and mean escape time (MFET) and show how the activity
is responsible for the bimodality of RPDF, which is clearly absent if the
nanorod is passive. Broadening of displacement distributions with activity has
also been observed. The computed mean first escape time decreases with
activity. In contrast, the fluctuations of the first escape times vary in a
non-monotonic way. This results high values of the coefficient of variation and
indicates the presence of multiple timescales in first escape time
distributions and multimodality in uniformity index distributions. We hope our
study will help in differentiating activity-driven escape dynamics from purely
thermal passive diffusion in confinement.

<h3>Wiedemann-Franz law in graphene in the presence of a weak magnetic field</h3>

<i>Yi-Ting Tu, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<br>
<br>
The experimental work [J. Crossno et al., Science 351, 1058 (2016)], which
reported the violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in monolayer graphene
characterized by a sharp peak of the Lorenz ratio at a finite temperature, has
not been fully explained. Our previous work [Y.-T. Tu and S. Das Sarma, Phys.
Rev. B 107, 085401 (2023)] provided a possible explanation through a
Boltzmann-transport model with bipolar diffusion and an energy gap possibly
induced by the substrate. In this paper, we extend our calculation to include a
weak magnetic field perpendicular to the graphene layer, which is
experimentally relevant, and may shed light on the possible violation or not of
the Wiedemann-Franz law. We find that the magnetic field enhances the size of
the peak of the Lorenz ratio but has little effect on its position, and that
the transverse component of the Lorenz ratio can be either positive or negative
depending on the parameter regime. In addition, we do the same calculation for
bilayer graphene in the presence of a magnetic field and show the qualitative
similarity with monolayer graphene. Our work should motivate
magnetic-field-dependent experiments elucidating the nature of the charge
carriers in graphene layers.
