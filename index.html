<h3>Odd Cosserat elasticity in active materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13606" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13606</a>

Stress-strain constitutive relations in solids with an internal angular
degree of freedom can be modelled using Cosserat (also called micropolar)
elasticity. In this paper, we explore the phenomenology for a natural extension
of Cosserat materials that includes chiral active components and odd
elasticity. We calculate static elastic properties of such a solid, where we
show that static response to rotational stresses leads to strains that depend
on both Cosserat and odd elasticity. We then compute the dispersion of linear
solutions in these odd Cosserat materials in the overdamped regime and find the
presence of \emph{exceptional points} in the dispersion relation. We discover
that these exceptional points create a sharp boundary between a
Cosserat-dominated regime of complete wave attenuation and an
odd-elasticity-dominated regime of propagating waves. We conclude by showing
the effect of Cosserat and odd elastic terms on the polarization of Rayleigh
surface waves.

<h3>High-yield exfoliation of MoS2 nanosheets by a novel spray technique and  the importance of soaking and surfactants</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13813" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13813</a>

<br>
Liquid-phase exfoliation of two-dimensional materials is very attractive for
large-scale applications. Although used extensively, isolating MoS2 layers
(<10) with high efficiency is reported to be extremely difficult. Further, the
importance of soaking has not yet been studied, and the surfactants' role in
stabilizing MoS2 nanosheets is poorly understood1. Herein, we report a novel
approach to exfoliating large quantities of MoS2 via high-pressure (HP)
liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) in deionized (DI) water. 4 to 7 layers of MoS2
nanosheets were obtained from 60 days-soaked samples and they were found to be
stable in solvents for periods of up to six months. Studies on the effect of
three surfactants, namely sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate (SDBS), sodium
cholate (SC), and tetra-butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB), indicate that
exfoliation of MoS2 nanosheets in SDBS is highly efficient than the other two
surfactants. The estimated yield reaches up to 7.25%, with a nanosheet
concentration of 1.45 mg/ml, which is one of the highest ever reported. Our
studies also suggest that the nanosheets' concentration and the lateral size
depend on exfoliation cycles, applied pressure and surfactant concentration.
Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and ion-transport study show that the
nanosheets prepared by our method are stable in an acidic medium and free from
surfactants. A high hydrogen evolution rate of 30.13 mmol g-1 h-1 was estimated
under ambient laboratory conditions.

<h3>Towards Structural Reconstruction from X-Ray Spectra</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13909" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13909</a>
<br>

We report a statistical analysis of Ge K-edge X-ray emission spectra
simulated for amorphous GeO$_2$ at elevated pressures. We find that employing
machine learning approaches we can reliably predict the statistical moments of
the K$\beta''$ and K$\beta_2$ peaks in the spectrum from the Coulomb matrix
descriptor with a training set of $\sim 10^4$ samples.
Spectral-significance-guided dimensionality reduction techniques allow us to
construct an approximate inverse mapping from spectral moments to
pseudo-Coulomb matrices. When applying this to the moments of the ensemble-mean
spectrum, we obtain distances from the active site that match closely to those
of the ensemble mean and which moreover reproduce the pressure-induced
coordination change in amorphous GeO$_2$. With this approach utilizing
emulator-based component analysis, we are able to filter out the artificially
complete structural information available from simulated snapshots, and
quantitatively analyse structural changes that can be inferred from the changes
in the K$\beta$ emission spectrum alone.

<h3>Runaway Transition in Irreversible Polymer Condensation with Cyclisation</h3>

<br>
<br>
The process of polymer condensation, i.e. the formation of bonds between
reactive end-groups, is ubiquitous in both industry and biology. Here we study
generic systems undergoing polymer condensation in competition with
cyclisation. Using a generalised Smoluchowski theory, molecular dynamics
simulations and experiments using DNA and T4 ligase, we find that this system
displays a transition, from a regime with finite-length chains at infinite time
and dominated by rings to one dominated by linear polymers that grow in time.
Finally, we show that fluids prepared close to the transition may have
profoundly different compositions and rheology at large condensation times.

<h3>Theory of Charge Regulation of Colloidal Particles in Electrolyte  Solutions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14034" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14034</a>
<br>
<i>Amin Bakhshandeh, Derek Frydel, Yan Levin</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a theory that enables us to calculate the effective surface charge
of colloidal particles and to efficiently obtain titration curves for different
salt concentrations. The theory accounts for the shift of pH of solution due to
the presence of 1:1 electrolyte. It also accounts self-consistently for the
electrostatic potential produced by the deprotonated surface groups. To examine
the accuracy of the theory we have performed extensive reactive Monte Carlo
simulations, which show excellent agreement between theory and simulations
without any adjustable parameters.

<h3>Terahertz Ionic Kerr Effect</h3>

<br>
<br>
The ultrafast optical Kerr effect has been widely used for investigating the
nonlinear optical properties of liquid, molecular and solid-state compounds.
Here we provide experimental evidence and theoretical description that in
insulating SrTiO3 its THz counterpart admits a sizeable response due to lattice
degrees of freedom. Such a ionic Kerr effect exploits the ability of strong THz
light pulses to excite multiple infrared phonons at an intermediate step before
or after the usual off-resonant electronic excitations responsible for the
electronic THz Kerr effect. We are able to identify the mechanism thanks to a
quantitative theoretical model of the time and polarization dependence of both
the electronic and phononic responses. The ionic Kerr effect represents an
alternative up-conversion scheme to modulate the refractive index of a system
on ultrashort time-scales.

<h3>Disentangling electronic transport and hysteresis at individual grain  boundaries in hybrid perovskites via automated scanning probe microscopy</h3>

Underlying the rapidly increasing photovoltaic efficiency and stability of
metal halide perovskites (MHPs) is the advance in the understanding of the
microstructure of polycrystalline MHP thin film. Over the past decade, intense
efforts have aimed to understand the effect of microstructure on MHP
properties, including chemical heterogeneity, strain disorder, phase impurity,
etc. It has been found that grain and grain boundary (GB) are tightly related
to lots of microscale and nanoscale behavior in MHP thin film. Atomic force
microscopy (AFM) is widely used to observe grain and boundary structures in
topography and subsequently to study the correlative surface potential and
conductivity of these structures. For now, most AFM measurements have been
performed in imaging mode to study the static behavior, in contrast, AFM
spectroscopy mode allows us to investigate the dynamic behavior of materials,
e.g. conductivity under sweeping voltage. However, a major limitation of AFM
spectroscopy measurements is that it requests manual operation by human
operators, as such only limited data can be obtained, hindering systematic
investigations of these microstructures. In this work, we designed a workflow
combining the conductive AFM measurement with a machine learning (ML) algorithm
to systematically investigate grain boundaries in MHPs. The trained ML model
can extract GBs locations from the topography image, and the workflow drives
the AFM probe to each GB location to perform a current-voltage (IV) curve
automatically. Then, we are able to IV curves at all GB locations, allowing us
to systematically understand the property of GBs. Using this method, we
discover that the GB junction points are more photoactive, while most previous
works only focused on the difference between GB and grains.

<h3>Single-atom anchored novel two-dimensional MoSi2N4 monolayers for  efficient electroreduction of CO2 to formic acid and methane</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14211" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14211</a>
<br>
<i>Wei Xun, Xiao Yang, Qing-Song Jiang, Ming-Jun Wang, Yin-Zhong Wu, Ping Li</i>
<br>
<br>
Efficient and selective CO2 electroreduction into value-added chemicals and
fuels emerged as a significant approach for CO2 conversion, however, it relies
on catalysts with controllable product selectivity and reaction paths. In this
work, by means of first-principles calculations, we identify five catalysts
(TM@MoSi2N4, TM = Sc, Ti, Fe, Co and Ni) comprising transition-metal atoms
anchored on a MoSi2N4 monolayer, whose catalytic performance can be controlled
by adjusting the d-band center and occupation of supported metal atoms. During
CO2 reduction, the single metal atoms function as the active sites activates
the MoSi2N4 inert basal-plane, and as-designed electrocatalysts exhibit
excellent activity in CO2 reduction. Interestingly, HCOOH is the preferred
product of CO2 reduction on the Co@MoSi2N4 catalyst with a rate-determining
barrier of 0.89 eV, while the other four catalysts prefer to reduce CO2 to CH4
with a rate-determining barrier of 0.81-1.24 eV. Moreover, MoSi2N4 is an
extremely-air-stable material, which will facilitate its application in various
environments. Our findings provide a promising candidate with high activity,
catalysts for renewable energy technologies, and selectivity for experimental
work.

<h3>A multi-category inverse design neural network and its application to  diblock copolymers</h3>

In this work, we design a multi-category inverse design neural network to map
ordered periodic structure to physical parameters. The neural network model
consists of two parts, a classifier and Structure-Parameter-Mapping (SPM)
subnets. The classifier is used to identify structure, and the SPM subnets are
used to predict physical parameters for desired structures. We also present an
extensible reciprocal-space data augmentation method to guarantee the rotation
and translation invariant of periodic structures. We apply the proposed network
model and data augmentation method to two-dimensional diblock copolymers based
on the Landau-Brazovskii model. Results show that the multi-category inverse
design neural network is high accuracy in predicting physical parameters for
desired structures. Moreover, the idea of multi-categorization can also be
extended to other inverse design problems.

<h3>Exact Many-Body Ground States from Decomposition of Ideal Higher Chern  Bands: Applications to Chirally Twisted Graphene Multilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13477" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13477</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Motivated by the higher Chern bands of twisted graphene multilayers, we
consider flat bands with arbitrary Chern number $C$ with ideal quantum
geometry. While $C>1$ bands differ from Landau levels, we show that these bands
host exact fractional Chern insulator (FCI) ground states for short range
interactions. We show how to decompose ideal higher Chern bands into separate
ideal bands with Chern number $1$ that are intertwined through translation and
rotation symmetry. The decomposed bands admit an $SU(C)$ action that combines
real space and momentum space translations. Remarkably, they also allow for
analytic construction of exact many-body ground states, such as generalized
quantum Hall ferromagnets and FCIs, including flavor-singlet Halperin states
and Laughlin ferromagnets in the limit of short-range interactions. In this
limit, the $SU(C)$ action is promoted to a symmetry on the ground state
subspace. While flavor singlet states are translation symmetric, the flavor
ferromagnets correspond to translation broken states and admit charged skyrmion
excitations corresponding to a spatially varying density wave pattern. We
confirm our analytic predictions with numerical simulations of ideal bands of
twisted chiral multilayers of graphene, and discuss consequences for
experimentally accessible systems such as monolayer graphene twisted relative
to a Bernal bilayer.

<h3>Absence of a BCS-BEC crossover in the cuprate superconductors</h3>

We examine key aspects of the theory of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)
to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover, focusing on the temperature
dependence of the chemical potential, $\mu$. We identify an accurate method of
determining the change of $\mu$ in the cuprate high temperature superconductors
from angle-resolved-photoemission data (along the "nodal'' direction), and show
that $\mu$ varies by less than a few percent of the Fermi energy over a range
of temperatures from far below to several times above the superconducting
transition temperature, $T_c$. This shows, unambiguously, that not only are
these materials always on the BCS side of the crossover (which is a phase
transition in the $d$-wave case), but are nowhere near the point of the
crossover (where the chemical potential approaches the band bottom).

<h3>Uncovering conformal symmetry in the $3D$ Ising transition:  State-operator correspondence from a fuzzy sphere regularization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13482" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13482</a>
<br>
<i>Wei Zhu, Chao Han, Emilie Huffman, Johannes S. Hofmann, Yin-Chen He</i>
<br>
<br>
The $3D$ Ising transition, the most celebrated and unsolved critical
phenomenon in nature, has long been conjectured to have emergent conformal
symmetry, similar to the case of the $2D$ Ising transition. Yet, the emergence
of conformal invariance in the $3D$ Ising transition has rarely been explored
directly, mainly due to unavoidable mathematical or conceptual obstructions.
Here, we design an innovative way to study the quantum version of the $3D$
Ising phase transition on spherical geometry, using the ``fuzzy
(non-commutative) sphere" regularization. We accurately calculate and analyze
the energy spectra at the transition, and explicitly demonstrate the
state-operator correspondence (i.e. radial quantization), an important property
of conformal field theory. In particular, we have identified 13 parity-even
primary operators within a high accuracy and 2 parity-odd operators that were
not known before. Our result directly elucidates the emergent conformal
symmetry of the $3D$ Ising transition, a conjecture made by Polyakov half a
century ago.

<h3>Photocurrent as a multi-physics diagnostic of quantum materials</h3>

The photoexcitation life-cycle from incident photon (and creation of
photoexcited electron hole pair) to ultimate extraction of electrical current
is a complex multi-physics process spanning across a range of spatio-temporal
scales of quantum materials. While often viewed through a device-technology
lens, photocurrent is a key observable of the life-cycle that is sensitive to a
myriad of physical processes across these scales. As a result, photocurrent is
emerging as a versatile probe of electronic states, Bloch band quantum
geometry, quantum kinetic processes, and device characteristics of quantum
materials. This review outlines the key multi-physics principles of
photocurrent diagnostics. In particular, we describe how the fundamental link
between light-matter interaction and quantum geometry renders photocurrent a
wavefunction-sensitive probe capable of resolving bandstructure and
characterizing topological materials. We further highlight the sensitivity of
the photoexcitation life-cycle to relaxational processes which in turn enables
photocurrent to disentangle distinct types of carrier scattering that can range
from femtosecond to nanosecond timescales. We survey the intrinsically nonlocal
character of photocurrent collection that allows new types remote sensing
protocols and photocurrent nanoscopy. These distinctive features underscore
photocurrent diagnostics as a novel multi-physics probe for a growing class of
quantum materials with properties governed by physics spanning multiple
spatio-temporal scales.

<h3>Origin of Model Fractional Chern Insulators in All Topological Ideal  Flatbands: Explicit Color-entangled Wavefunction and Exact Density Algebra</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13487" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13487</a>

<br>
<br>
It is commonly believed that nonuniform Berry curvature destroys the
Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra and as a consequence destabilizes fractional
Chern insulators. In this work we disprove this common lore by presenting a
theory for all topological ideal flatbands with nonzero Chern number C. The
smooth single-particle Bloch wavefunction is proved to admit an exact
color-entangled form as a superposition of C lowest Landau level type
wavefunctions distinguished by boundary conditions. Including repulsive
interactions, Abelian and non-Abelian model fractional Chern insulators of
Halperin type are stabilized as exact zero-energy ground states no matter how
nonuniform Berry curvature is, as long as the quantum geometry is ideal and the
repulsion is short-ranged. The key reason behind is the existence of an
emergent Hilbert space in which Berry curvature can be exactly flattened by
adjusting wavefunction's normalization. In such space, the flatband-projected
density operator obeys a closed Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman type algebra, making
exact mapping to C-layered Landau levels possible. In the end we discuss
applications of the theory to moire flatband systems with a particular focus on
the fractionalized phase and spontaneous symmetry breaking phase recently
observed in graphene based twisted materials.

<h3>Area-law entanglement from quantum geometry</h3>

Quantum geometry, which encompasses both Berry curvature and the quantum
metric, plays a key role in multi-band interacting electron systems. We study
the entanglement entropy of a region of linear size $\ell$ in fermion systems
with nontrivial quantum geometry, i.e. whose Bloch states have nontrivial $k$
dependence. We show that the entanglement entropy scales as $S = \alpha
\ell^{d-1} \ln\ell + \beta \ell^{d-1} + \cdots$ where the first term is the
well-known area-law violating term for fermions and $\beta$ contains the
leading contribution from quantum geometry. We compute this for the case of
uniform quantum geometry and cubic domains and provide numerical results for
the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, 2D massive Dirac cone, and 2D Chern bands. An
experimental probe of the quantum geometric entanglement entropy is proposed
using particle number fluctuations. We offer an intuitive account of the
area-law entanglement related to the spread of maximally localized Wannier
functions.

<h3>$\mathrm{O_2}$ reduction at a DMSO/Cu(111) model battery interface</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13528" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13528</a>
<br>
<i>Angelika Demling, Sarah B. King, Philip Shushkov, Julia Stähler</i>
<br>
<br>
In order to develop a better understanding of electrochemical $\mathrm{O_2}$
reduction in non-aqueous solvents, we apply two-photon photoelectron
spectroscopy to probe the dynamics of $\mathrm{O_2}$ reduction at a
DMSO/Cu(111) model battery interface. By analyzing the temporal evolution of
the photoemission signal, we observe the formation of $\mathrm{O_2^-}$ from a
trapped electron state at the DMSO/vacuum interface. We find the vertical
binding energy of $\mathrm{O_2^-}$ to be 3.80 $\pm$ 0.05 eV, in good agreement
with previous results from electrochemical measurements, but with improved
accuracy, potentially serving as a basis for future calculations on the
kinetics of electron transfer at electrode interfaces. Modelling the
$\mathrm{O_2}$ diffusion through the DMSO layer enables us to quantify the
activation energy of diffusion (31 $\pm$ 6 meV), the diffusion constant (1
$\pm$ 1$\cdot 10^{-8}$ cm$^2$/s), and the reaction quenching distance for
electron transfer to $\mathrm{O_2}$ in DMSO (12.4 $\pm$ 0.4 $\unicode{x212B}$),
a critical value for evaluating possible mechanisms for electrochemical side
reactions. These results ultimately will inform the development and
optimization of metal-air batteries in non-aqueous solvents.

<h3>Kramers nodal lines and Weyl fermions in SmAlSi</h3>

<br>
<br>
Kramers nodal lines (KNLs) have recently been proposed theoretically as a
special type of Weyl line degeneracy that connects time reversal invariant
momenta, are robust to spin orbit coupling (SOC), and are inherent to all
non-centrosymmetric achiral crystal structures. Through lattice symmetry
breaking, they can be regarded as the parent phase of Kramers Weyl semimetals
via topological phase tuning, leading to unusual spin, magneto-electric, and
optical properties. Here we identify experimentally the existence of novel KNLs
in SmAlSi, a non-centrosymmetric metal that develops incommensurate spin
density wave order at low temperatures. Using angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and magneto-transport
methods, we provide evidence for the symmetry-protected KNLs, as well as Weyl
fermions under the broken inversion symmetry in the paramagnetic phase of
SmAlSi. We discuss the nesting possibilities regarding the emergent magnetic
orders in SmAlSi. More generally, we establish SmAlSi and the large family of
isostructural analogs as a rich material platform for tuning topological phases
and exploring correlated topology.

<h3>Nanostructural polymorphism in the low-birefringence chiral phase of an  achiral bent-shaped dimer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13544" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13544</a>

<br>
<br>
Polymorphism, the phenomenon that a species can exist in many discrete forms,
is common in nature, such as hair colors in an animal species, flower colors in
a tree species, and blood types in humans, etc. In materials science, it refers
to a solid that can exist in multiple forms with different crystalline
structures. In the liquid crystals field, however, polymorphism is hard to find
because a discontinuous structural variation is basically impossible because of
their fluid or partially fluid nature. Herein we show that the B4 and DC phases
that for many years have been classified as distinctive phases are connected,
in terms of their nano-architectures, based on the study of a single compound,
a flexible bent-shaped dimer. The surrounding solvent is the key to assisting
the dimeric molecules in morphing and adopting different supramolecular
structures at the mesoscale. Furthermore, we accidentally find a novel
nanotube-like structure that has not yet been reported in view of the B4/DC
phases. Together with the known sponge (DC) and the helical filament (B4)
structures, they are just some of the manifestations of the polymorphism in a
class of low-birefringence, chiral phase from achiral liquid crystals.

<h3>Amorphous and polycrystalline routes towards a chiral spin liquid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13548" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13548</a>
<br>
<i>Adolfo G. Grushin, Cécile Repellin</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that a chiral spin liquid spontaneously emerges in partially
amorphous, polycrystalline or ion-irradiated Kitaev materials. In these
systems, time-reversal symmetry is broken spontaneously due to a non-zero
density of plaquettes with an odd number of edges, $n_{odd}$. This mechanism
opens a sizeable gap, at small $n_{odd}$ compatible with that of typical
amorphous materials and polycrystals, and which can alternatively be induced by
ion-irradiation. We find that the gap is proportional to $n_{odd}$, saturating
at $n_{odd}\sim 40\%$. Using exact diagonalization, we find that the chiral
spin liquid is approximately as stable to Heisenberg interactions as Kitaev's
honeycomb spin liquid model. Our results open up a significant number of
non-crystalline systems where chiral spin liquids can emerge without external
magnetic fields.

<h3>Chiral superconductivity in the doped triangular-lattice Fermi-Hubbard  model in two dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13551" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13551</a>
<br>
<i>Vinicius Zampronio, Tommaso Macrì</i>
<br>
<br>
The triangular-lattice Fermi-Hubbard model has been extensively investigated
in the literature due to its connection to chiral spin states and
unconventional superconductivity. Previous simulations of the ground state of
the doped system rely on quasi-one-dimensional lattices where true long-range
order is forbidden. Here we simulate a 12x12 triangular lattice using
state-of-the-art Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo. Upon doping a
non-magnetic chiral spin state, we observe evidence of chiral superconductivity
at filling n=5/6 supported by long-range order in Cooper-pair correlation and a
finite value of the chiral order parameter. With this aim, we first locate the
transition from the metallic to the non-magnetic insulating phase where we see
competition between chiral and magnetic orders. Our results pave the way
towards a better understanding of strongly correlated lattice systems with
magnetic frustration.

<br>
<br>
We study the low-energy collective properties of a 1D spin-1 Bose gas using
bosonization. After giving an overview of the technique, emphasizing the
physical aspects, we apply it to the $S=1$ Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian and find a
novel separation of the quadrupole-spin-charge sectors, confirmed by time-MPS
numerical simulations. Additionally, through the single particle spectrum, we
show the existence of the superfluid-Mott insulator transition and the point at
which the physics are described by a Heisenberg-like Hamiltonian. The magnetic
phase diagrams are found for both the superfluid and insulating regimes; the
latter is determined by decomposing the complete Heisenberg
bilinear-biquadratic Hamiltonian, which describes the Mott insulator, into
simpler, effective Hamiltonians. This allows us to keep our methods flexible
and transferable to other interesting interacting condensed matter systems.

<br>

The predictive capabilities of machine learning (ML) models used in materials
discovery are typically measured using simple statistics such as the
root-mean-square error (RMSE) or the coefficient of determination ($r^2$)
between ML-predicted materials property values and their known values. A
tempting assumption is that models with low error should be effective at
guiding materials discovery, and conversely, models with high error should give
poor discovery performance. However, we observe that no clear connection exists
between a "static" quantity averaged across an entire training set, such as
RMSE, and an ML property model's ability to dynamically guide the iterative
(and often extrapolative) discovery of novel materials with targeted
properties. In this work, we simulate a sequential learning (SL)-guided
materials discovery process and demonstrate a decoupling between traditional
model error metrics and model performance in guiding materials discoveries. We
show that model performance in materials discovery depends strongly on (1) the
target range within the property distribution (e.g., whether a 1st or 10th
decile material is desired); (2) the incorporation of uncertainty estimates in
the SL acquisition function; (3) whether the scientist is interested in one
discovery or many targets; and (4) how many SL iterations are allowed. To
overcome the limitations of static metrics and robustly capture SL performance,
we recommend metrics such as Discovery Yield ($DY$), a measure of how many
high-performing materials were discovered during SL, and Discovery Probability
($DP$), a measure of likelihood of discovering high-performing materials at any
point in the SL process.

Hot carrier-based energy conversion systems could double the efficiency of
conventional solar energy technology or drive photochemical reactions that
would not be possible using fully thermalized, ``cool'' carriers, but current
strategies require expensive multi-junction architectures. Using an
unprecedented combination of photoelectrochemical and in situ transient
absorption spectroscopy measurements, we demonstrate ultrafast (<50 fs) hot
exciton and free carrier extraction under applied bias in a proof-of-concept
photoelectrochemical solar cell made from earth-abundant and potentially
inexpensive monolayer (ML) MoS2. Our approach facilitates ultrathin 7\AA charge
transport distances over 1 cm^2 areas by intimately coupling ML-MoS2 to an
electron-selective solid contact and a hole-selective electrolyte contact. Our
theoretical investigations of the spatial distribution of exciton states
suggest greater electronic coupling between hot exciton states located on
peripheral S atoms and neighboring contacts likely facilitates ultrafast charge
transfer. Our work delineates future 2D semiconductor design strategies for
practical implementation in ultrathin photovoltaic and solar fuels
applications.

<h3>A critical examination of robustness and generalizability of machine  learning prediction of materials properties</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13597" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13597</a>

<i>Kangming Li, Brian DeCost, Kamal Choudhary, Michael Greenwood, Jason Hattrick-Simpers</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent advances in machine learning (ML) methods have led to substantial
improvement in materials property prediction against community benchmarks, but
an excellent benchmark score may not imply good generalization of performance.
Here we show that ML models trained on the Materials Project 2018 (MP18)
dataset can have severely degraded prediction performance on new compounds in
the Materials Project 2021 (MP21) dataset. We document performance degradation
in graph neural networks and traditional descriptor-based ML models for both
quantitative and qualitative predictions. We find the source of the predictive
degradation is due to the distribution shift between the MP18 and MP21
versions. This is revealed by the uniform manifold approximation and projection
(UMAP) of the feature space. We then show that the performance degradation
issue can be foreseen using a few simple tools. Firstly, the UMAP can be used
to investigate the connectivity and relative proximity of the training and test
data within feature space. Secondly, the disagreement between multiple ML
models on the test data can illuminate out-of-distribution samples. We
demonstrate that the simple yet efficient UMAP-guided and query-by-committee
acquisition strategies can greatly improve prediction accuracy through adding
only 1~\% of the test data. We believe this work provides valuable insights for
building materials databases and ML models that enable better prediction
robustness and generalizability.

<h3>Cut-offs and light-spin flips in surface plasmon resonance between a  chiral medium and a metal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13603" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13603</a>
<br>
<i>Hyoung-In Lee, Christopher Gaul</i>
<br>
<br>
We have derived a dispersion relation governing the surface plasmon resonance
established along a planar interface between a metal and a chiral medium
(chiral case). Resulting numerical solutions are compared with the well-known
results obtained for a metal-dielectric interface (achiral case). Comparisons
show that the chiral case exhibits smaller phase speeds than the achiral case.
Such a longitudinal deceleration in the chiral case is caused by the energy
expended on establishing the longitudinal spin density, which turns out
anti-symmetric with respect to medium chirality. Moreover, the low-frequency
range is disallowed in the chiral case. Relevant energy redistributions,
spin-orbital couplings, and applications are discussed.

<i>Fei Gao, Rodrigo E. Menchón, Aran Garcia-Lekue, Mads Brandbyge</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, porphyrin units have been attached to graphene nanoribbons
(Por-GNR) enabling a multitude of possible structures. Here we report first
principles calculations of two prototypical, experimentally feasible, Por-GNR
hybrids, one of which displays a small band gap relevant for its use as
electrode in a device. Embedding a Fe atom in the porphyrin causes spin
polarization with a spin ground state $S=1$. We employ density functional
theory and nonequilibrium Green's function transport calculations to examine a
2-terminal setup involving one Fe-Por-GNR between two metal-free, small band
gap, Por-GNR electrodes. The coupling between the Fe-$d$ and GNR band states
results in a Fano anti-resonance feature in the spin transport close to the
Fermi energy. This feature makes transport highly sensitive to the Fe spin
state. We demonstrate how mechanical strain or chemical adsorption on the Fe
give rise to a spin-crossover to $S=1$ and $S=0$, respectively, directly
reflected in a change in transport. Our theoretical results provide a clue for
the on-surface synthesis of Por-GNRs hybrids, which can open a new avenue for
carbon-based spintronics and chemical sensing.

<h3>Strained topological insulator spin field effect transistor</h3>

<br>
<br>
The notion of a spin field effect transistor, where transistor action is
realized by manipulating the spin degree of freedom of charge carriers instead
of the charge degree of freedom, has captivated researchers for at least three
decades. These transistors are usually implemented by modulating the spin orbit
interaction in a two- or one-dimensional semiconductor structure with an
electrostatic potential, which then causes controlled spin precession in the
transistor's channel that modulates the current flowing between two
ferromagnetic (spin-polarized) source and drain contacts. Here, we introduce a
new concept for a spin field effect transistor whose channel is made of a
strained topological insulator
(strained-topological-insulator-field-effect-transistor or STI-SPINFET), which
does not exploit spin-orbit interaction. Instead, the transistor function is
elicited by straining the topological insulator (TI) with a gate voltage which
modifies the energy dispersion relation, or the Dirac velocity, to vary the
interference between the two spin eigenstates on the surface of the TI. This
modulates the current flowing between two ferromagnetic source and drain
contacts. The conductance on/off ratio of this transistor is too poor to be
useful as a switch, but it may have other uses, such as an extremely
energy-efficient stand-alone frequency multiplier.

We address the degeneracy of the ground state multiplet on the 5$d^1$
Re$^{6+}$ ion in double perovskite Ba$_{2}$MgReO$_{6}$ using a combination of
specific heat measurements and density functional calculations. For
Ba$_{2}$MgReO$_{6}$, two different ground state multiplets have previously been
proposed - a quartet (with degeneracy $N$=4) [1] and a doublet ($N$=2) [2].
Here we employ two independent methods for the estimation of phonon
contribution in heat capacity data to obtain the magnetic entropy $S_{mag}$,
which reflects the degeneracy of the ground state multiplet $N$ through
$S_{mag}=R$ln$N$. In both cases, we obtain a better fit to $S_{mag}=R$ln2
indicating evidence of $N$=2 degeneracy in the range from 2 to 120~K. The
detailed nature of the ground state multiplet in Ba$_{2}$MgReO$_{6}$ remains an
open question.

<h3>Integrable heat conduction model</h3>

<br>
<i>Chiara Franceschini, Rouven Frassek, Cristian Giardinà</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider a stochastic process of heat conduction where energy is
redistributed along a chain between nearest neighbor sites via an improper beta
distribution. Similar to the well-known Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti (KMP) model,
the finite chain is coupled at its ends with two reservoirs that break the
conservation of energy when working at different temperatures. At variance with
KMP, the model considered here is integrable and one can write in a closed form
the $n$-point correlation functions of the non-equilibrium steady state. As a
consequence of the exact solution one can directly prove that the system is in
a `local equilibrium' and described at the macro-scale by a product measure.
Integrability manifests itself through the description of the model via the
open Heisenberg chain with non-compact spins. The algebraic formulation of the
model allows to interpret its duality relation with a purely absorbing particle
system as a change of representation.

<h3>Switching between Mott-Hubbard and Hund physics in moiré quantum  simulators</h3>

<i>Siheon Ryee, Tim O. Wehling</i>
<br>
<br>
Mott-Hubbard and Hund electron correlations have been realized thus far in
separate classes of materials. Here, we show that a single moir\'e homobilayer
encompasses both kinds of physics in a controllable manner. We develop a
microscopic multiband model which we solve by dynamical mean-field theory to
nonperturbatively address the local many-body correlations. We demonstrate how
tuning with twist angle, dielectric screening, and hole density allows to
switch between Mott-Hubbard and Hund correlated states in twisted WSe$_2$
bilayer. The underlying mechanism bases on controlling
Coulomb-interaction-driven orbital polarization and energetics of concomitant
local singlet and triplet spin configurations. From comparison to recent
experimental transport data, we find signatures of a filling-controlled
transition from a triplet charge-transfer insulator to a Hund-Mott metal. Our
finding establishes twisted transition metal dichalcogenides as a tunable
platform for exotic phases of quantum matter emerging from large local spin
moments.

<br>
<br>
Many soft and biological materials display so-called 'soft glassy' dynamics;
their constituents undergo anomalous random motion and intermittent cooperative
rearrangements. Stock prices show qualitatively similar dynamics, whose origins
also remain poorly understood. Recent simulations of a foam have revealed that
such motion is due to the system evolving in a high-dimensional configuration
space via energy minimization on a slowly changing, fractal energy landscape.
Here we show that the salient geometrical features of such energy landscapes
can be explored and quantified not only in simulation but empirically using
real-world, high-dimensional data. In a mayonnaise-like dense emulsion, the
experimentally observed motion of oil droplets shows that the fractal geometry
of the configuration space paths and energy landscape gives rise to the
anomalous random motion and cooperative rearrangements, confirming
corresponding simulations in detail. Our empirical approach allows the same
analyses to be applied to the component stock prices of the Standard and Poor's
500 Index. This analysis yields remarkably similar results, revealing that
stock return dynamics also appear due to prices moving on a similar, slowly
evolving, high-dimensional fractal landscape.

All van der Waals (vdW) Fe3GeTe2/Cr2Ge2Te6/graphite magnetic heterojunctions
have been fabricated via mechanical exfoliation and stacking, and their
magnetotransport properties are studied in detail. At low bias voltages large
negative junction magnetoresistances have been observed and are attributed to
spin-conserving tunneling transport across the insulating Cr2Ge2Te6 layer. With
increasing bias, a crossover to Fowler-Nordheim tunneling takes place. The
negative sign of the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) suggests that the bottom
of conduction band in Cr2Ge2Te6 belongs to minority spins, opposite to the
findings of some first-principles calculations. This work shows that the vdW
heterostructures based on 2D magnetic insulators are a valuable platform to
gain further insight into spin polarized tunneling transport, which is the
basis for pursuing high performance spintronic devices and a large variety of
quantum phenomena.

<br>
Phase evolution during the selenization is crucial for high-quality kesterite
Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 (CZTSSe) absorbers and efficient solar cells. Herein, we
regulate kinetic process of phase evolution from Cu+-Sn4+-MOE (MOE:
2-methoxyethanol) system by precisely controlling positive chamber pressure. We
found that, at the heating-up stage, Se vapor concentration is intentionally
suppressed in low-temperature region, which effectively reduces collision
probability between the CZTS and Se atoms, thus remarkably inhibiting formation
of secondary phases on the surface and multiple-step phase evolution processes.
This strategy enables the phase evolution to start at relatively higher
temperature and thereby leading to high crystalline quality CZTSSe absorber
with fewer defects, and corresponding CZTSSe solar cell can present 14.1%
efficiency (total area), which is the highest result so far. This work provides
important insights into selenization mechanism of CZTSSe absorbers and explores
a new way of kinetic regulation strategy to simplify the phase evolution path
to efficient CZTSSe solar cells.

In recent years, hole-spin qubits based on semiconductor quantum dots have

give a general theoretical framework describing them. The basic features of
spin-orbit coupling and hyperfine interaction in the valence band are
discussed, together with consequences on coherence and spin manipulation. In

An $ab$ $initio$ investigation of the family of molecular compounds TM$_2$$X$
are conducted, where TM is either TMTSF or TMTTF and $X$ takes centrosymmetric
monovalent anions. By deriving the extended Hubbard-type Hamiltonians from
first-principles band calculations and estimating not only the intermolecular
transfer integrals but also the Coulomb parameters, we discuss their material
dependence in the unified phase diagram. Furthermore, we apply the
many-variable variational Monte Carlo method to accurately determine the
symmetry-breaking phase transitions, and show the variation of the charge and
spin orderings. We show that the material-dependent parameter can be taken as
the correlation effect, represented by the on-site Coulomb interaction $U$, for
the comprehensive understanding of the spin and charge ordering in this system.

Two-dimensional (2D) half-metallic materials that have sparked intense
interest in advanced spintronic applications are essential to the developing
next-generation nanospintronic devices. Here we have adopted a first-principles
calculation method to predict the magnetic properties of intrinsic, Se-doped,
and biaxial strain tuning Cr$_2$AsP monolayer. The Janus Cr$_2$AsP monolayer is
proved to be an intrinsic ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductor with a exchange
splitting bandgap of 0.15 eV at the PBE+U level. Concentration-dependent Se
doping such as Cr$_2$As$_{1-x}$Se$_x$P (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) can regulate
Cr$_2$AsP from FM semiconductor to FM half-metallicity. Specifically, the
spin-up channel crosses the Fermi level, while the spin-down channel has a
bandgap. More interestingly, the wide half-metallic bandgaps and spin bandgaps
make them have important implications for the preparation of spintronic
devices. At last, we also explore the effect of biaxial strain from -14% to 10%
on the magnetism of the Cr$_2$AsP monolayer. There appears a transition from FM
to antiferromagnetic (AFM) at a compressive strain of -10.7%, originating from
the competition between the indirect FM superexchange interaction and the
direct AFM interaction between the nearest-neighbor Cr atoms. Additionally,
when the compressive strain to -2% or the tensile strain to 6%, the
semiconducting Cr$_2$AsP becomes a half-metallic material. These charming
properties render the Janus Cr$_2$AsP monolayer with great potential for
applications in spintronic devices.

Polymer Physics: Phenomenology of Polymeric Fluid Simulations is a review
volume that I am writing. I anticipate it will take a while to complete, so I
am supplying individual chapters when each is more-or-less completed.
This Chapter considers collective coordinates and collective models for
isolated polymer chains. Collective coordinates can be effective tools for
isolating aspects of polymer motion that are less obvious if only the Cartesian
coordinates of the individual atoms or monomers are viewed. I treat Fourier,
Rouse, and Haar wavelets as suppliers of collective coordinates. One of the
sets of collective coordinates that i consider, the Rouse coordinates, follows
naturally from the Rouse model of polymer dynamics. We therefore consider the
Rouse model as well as its more important predecessor, the Kirkwood-Riseman
model. Haar wavelets are noteworthy because they allow one to isolate
individual regions of a polymer

A $d$-dimensional, $n$th-order topological insulator or superconductor has
localized eigenmodes at its $(d-n)$-dimensional boundaries ($n\leq d$). In this
work, we apply periodic driving fields to two-dimensional superconductors, and
obtain a wide variety of Floquet second-order topological superconducting
(SOTSC) phases with many Majorana corner modes at both zero and $\pi$
quasienergies. Two distinct Floquet SOTSC phases are found to be separated by
three possible kinds of transformations, i.e., a topological phase transition
due to the closing/reopening of a bulk spectral gap, a topological phase
transition due to the closing/reopening of an edge spectral gap, or an entirely
different phase in which the bulk spectrum is gapless. Thanks to the strong
interplay between driving and intrinsic energy scales of the system, all the
found phases and transitions are highly controllable via tuning a single
hopping parameter of the system. Our discovery not only enriches the possible
forms of Floquet SOTSC phases, but also offers an efficient scheme to generate
many coexisting Majorana zero and $\pi$ corner modes that may find applications
in Floquet quantum computation.

<h3>Strong manipulation of the valley splitting upon twisting and gating in  MoSe$_2$/CrI$_3$ and WSe$_2$/CrI$_3$ van der Waals heterostructures</h3>

We investigate the twist-angle and gate dependence of the proximity-induced
exchange coupling in the monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)
MoSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ due to the vdW coupling to the ferromagnetic semiconductor
CrI$_3$, from first-principles calculations. A model Hamiltonian, that captures
the relevant band edges at the $K/K^{\prime}$ valleys of the proximitized
TMDCs, is employed to quantify the proximity-induced exchange. Upon twisting
from 0{\deg} to 30{\deg}, we find a transition of the TMDC valence band (VB)
edge exchange splitting from about $-2$ to $2$ meV, while the conduction band
(CB) edge exchange splitting remains nearly unchanged at around $-3$ meV. For
the VB of WSe$_2$ (MoSe$_2$) on CrI$_3$, the exchange coupling changes sign at
around 8{\deg} (16{\deg}). We find that even at the angles with almost zero
spin splittings of the VB, the real-space spin polarization profile of holes at
the band edge is highly non-uniform, with alternating spin up and spin down
orbitals. Furthermore, a giant tunability of the proximity-induced exchange
coupling is provided by a transverse electric field of a few V/nm. We
complement our \textit{ab initio} results by calculating the excitonic valley
splitting to provide experimentally verifiable optical signatures of the
proximity exchange. Specifically, we predict that the valley splitting
increases almost linearly as a function of the twist angle. Furthermore, the
proximity exchange is highly tunable by gating, allowing to tailor the valley
splitting in the range of 0 to 12 meV in WSe$_2$/CrI$_3$, which is equivalent
to external magnetic fields of up to about 60 Tesla. Our results highlight the
important impact of the twist angle and gating when employing magnetic vdW
heterostructures in experimental geometries.

We investigate both the longitudinal thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{xx}$) and
the planar thermal Hall conductivity ($\kappa_{xy}$) in the Kitaev spin liquid
candidate of Co-based honeycomb antiferromagnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ in a
magnetic field ($B$) applied along the $a$ and $a^*$ axes. A finite
$\kappa_{xy}$ is resolved for both field directions in the antiferromagnetic
(AFM) phase below the N\'eel temperature of 27 K. The temperature dependence of
$\kappa_{xy}/T$ shows the emergence of topological bosonic excitations. In
addition, the field dependence of $\kappa_{xy}$ shows sign reversals at the
critical fields in the AFM phase, suggesting the changes in the Chern number
distribution of the topological magnons. Remarkably, a finite $\kappa_{xy}$ is
observed in $B \parallel a^*$ between the first-order transition field in the
AFM phase and the saturation field, which is prohibited in a disordered state
by the two-fold rotation symmetry around the $a^*$ axis of the honeycomb
lattice, showing the presence of a magnetically ordered state that breaks the
two-fold rotation symmetry. Our results demonstrate the presence of topological
magnons in this compound in the whole field range below the saturation field.

We study quasi-particle dynamics in a quasi-periodic Ising model with
temporally fluctuating transverse fields. Specifically, we calculate the
dynamical exponents of the variance of a quasi-particle spreading under a field
chosen randomly from binary values $\pm h$ at every time interval. We find that
the short-time behavior of the dynamical exponents depends on the interval of
the temporally fluctuating fields. We also reveal how the quasi-particle
dynamics affects the relaxation of spin-spin correlation functions. The
dynamics can be explained via the overlap between the eigenvectors of a
Hamiltonian with $\pm h$.

is assessed by the contact orientational order, $\tilde{Q}_{\ell}$, that
quantifies the contribution of each contact configuration (Large-Large,
Small-Small, Large-Small, Small-Large) in the jammed structure. The partial
values of $\tilde{Q}_{\ell}$ are calculated with respect to known ordered
lattices that are fixed by the size ratio, $\delta$, of the particles. We find
that the packing undergoes a structural transition at $\phi_J$, manifested by a
sudden jump in the partial $\tilde{Q}_{\ell}$. Each contact configuration
contributes to the jammed structure in a different way, changing with $\delta$
and concentration of small particles, $X_{\mathrm{S}}$. The results show not
only that the packing undergoes a structural change upon jamming, but also that
bidisperse packings exhibit local HCP and FCC structures also found in
monodisperse packings. This suggests that the jammed structure of bidisperse
systems is inherently endowed with local structural order. These results are
relevant in understanding how the arrangement of particles determines the
strength of bidisperse granular packings.

Diffusion currents are theoretically examined in two-dimensional Dirac
materials, such as those of the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) family.
The transversal effects are analogues of the valley Hall (VHE) and
photogalvanic (PGE) transport phenomena in case when the electron driving force
is not an electric field but a gradient of electron density distribution in the
sample. The latter can be created by a finite-sized laser spot or by the
injection of electrons from other materials. We develop the theory of diffusive
VHE effect assuming the anisotropic electron-short-range-impurity skew
scattering. The electron PGE-like transport caused by higher electron-density
derivatives is analyzed assuming the trigonal warping anisotropy of electron
valleys in a TMD monolayer. The nonlinear responses on electron-density
gradient are studied as well. The isotropic processes of electron scattering
off the short-range and Coulomb centers are taken into account in the PGE-like
transport theory.

Calculations are presented to describe the dynamic of a growing bubble in a
single and simple formulation for R(t). The calculations show clearly that the
behavior of the growing bubble is exponentially increasing with the time
constant {\tau} showing a universal behavior as a function of the reduced
superheat. Experimental data from other researchers are used to verify the
description and are in good agreement with the results. The main motivation for
this study was to find R(t)that is accurate and at the same time uncomplicated
enough in solving the dynamic of the bubble growth to calculate the far-field
pressure for superheated liquids.

Spintronic artificial spiking neurons are promising due to their ability to
closely mimic the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) dynamics of the biological LIF
spiking neuron. However, the neuron needs to be reset after firing. Few of the
spintronic neurons that have been proposed in the literature discuss the reset
process in detail. In this article, we discuss the various schemes to achieve
this reset in a magnetic domain wall (DW) based spintronic neuron in which the
position of the DW represents the membrane potential. In all the spintronic
neurons studied, the neuron enters a refractory period and is reset when the DW
reaches a particular position. We show that the self-reset operation in the
neuron devices consumes energy that can vary from of several pJ to a few fJ,
which highlights the importance of the reset strategy in improving the energy
efficiency of spintronic artificial spiking neurons.

<h3>Two Distinct Charge Density Wave Orders and Emergent Superconductivity  in Pressurized CuTe</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present a high-pressure study of quasi-one-dimensional charge-density-wave
(CDW) material CuTe through ultralow-temperature (400 mK) electrical transport
and temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy measurements as well as the
first-principles calculations. We provide compelling evidence that the pristine
CDW order (CDW1) transforms into a distinctly different CDW order (CDW2) at ca.
6.5 GPa by a change of dip-like to peak-like anomalies in the d\r{ho}/dT curve
as well as reemergence of CDW amplitude and zone-folded mode in Raman
spectroscopy. Different from previously verified mechanism driven by
electron-phonon coupling for the CDW1 phase, the CDW2 phase rises from
electronic correlated interaction. This is supported by compatible emergence of
four tiny hole-like pockets with nearly full weight and quite localization of
pz orbital of Te atoms from the first-principles calculations. In addition,
superconductivity is induced along with the suppression of the CDW1, while the
superconducting transition displays an extraordinary broadening associated with
unusual competition between superconductivity and the CDW2 state. Our findings
of two distinct CDW orders and superconductivity in the pressurized CuTe
provide a promising platform for understanding the complicated relationship
between CDW and superconductivity.

<h3>Enhanced Thermoelectric Performance of Nanostructured Nickel Doped Ag2Te</h3>

We report on the thermoelectric properties of nickel doped Ag2-xNixTe (x = 0,
0.015, 0.025 & 0.055, 0.115, 0.155) nanostructures in the temperature (T) range
of 5 K to 575 K. The electrical resistivity of Ag2Te nanostructure shows
metallic behaviour in 5 K to 300 K initially that evolves into two metal to
insulator transitions (MITs) at low and mid-temperature regimes with increasing
x due to Mott-variable range hopping (VRH) and Arrhenius transports,
respectively. Their Seebeck coefficient varies nearly in a linear fashion in
this temperature range, showing metallic or doped-degenerate semiconducting
behaviour. Notably, this behaviour of the Seebeck coefficient is in contrast to
Mott VRH conduction as observed in resistivity. The steady increase in
resistivity and S with the sharp decrease in thermal conductivity between 410 K
to 425 K associated with the structural phase transition accomplishes a maximum
thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of 0.86 near 480 K in x = 0.155. This is
about 83 % more compared to that of bulk Ag2Te, and shows a significant
improvement over the best value reported for Ag2Te nanostructures thus far.
This study, therefore, shows that simultaneous nanocomposite formation, doping
and nanostructuring could be an effective strategy for tuning the electron and
phonon transports to improve the thermoelectric properties of a material.

<h3>Wave function of a photoelectron and its collapse in the photoemission  process</h3>

Based on the first-order perturbation theory, we show that the wave function
of a photoelectron is a wave packet with the same width as the incident light
pulse. Photoelectron detection measurements revealed that the widths of signal
pulses were much shorter than the light pulse and independent of the origin
(photoemission or other noises), which is an experimental observation of the
wave function collapse. Signal pulses of photoelectrons were distributed along
the time axis within the same width as the light pulse, consistent with the
interpretation of a wave function as a probability distribution.

<h3>Dynamics in the ordered and disordered phases of barocaloric adamantane</h3>

<br>
<br>
High-entropy order-disorder phase transitions can be used for efficient and
eco-friendly barocaloric solid-state cooling. Here the barocaloric effect is
reported in an archetypal plastic crystal, adamantane. Adamantane has a
colossal isothermally reversible entropy change of 106 J K-1 kg-1 . Extremely
low hysteresis means that this can be accessed at pressure differences less
than 200 bar. Configurational entropy can only account for about 40% of the
total entropy change; the remainder is due to vibrational effects. Using
neutron spectroscopy and supercell lattice dynamics calculations, it is found
that this vibrational entropy change is mainly caused by softening in the
high-entropy phase of acoustic modes that correspond to molecular rotations. We
attribute this behaviour to the contrast between an 'interlocked' state in the
low-entropy phase and sphere-like behaviour in the high-entropy phase. Although
adamantane is a simple van der Waals solid with near-spherical molecules, this
approach can be leveraged for the design of more complex barocaloric molecular
crystals. Moreover, this study shows that supercell lattice dynamics
calculations can accurately map the effect of orientational disorder on the
phonon spectrum, paving the way for studying the vibrational entropy, thermal
conductivity, and other thermodynamic effects in more complex materials.

<h3>Molecular mechanisms of self-mated hydrogel friction</h3>

<br>
<i>Jan Mees, Rok Simič, Thomas C. O'Connor, Nicholas D. Spencer, Lars Pastewka</i>
<br>
<br>
Self-mated hydrogel contacts show extremely small friction coefficients at
low loads but a distinct velocity dependence. Here we combine mesoscopic
simulations and experiments to test the polymer-relaxation hypothesis for this
velocity dependence, where a velocity-dependent regime emerges when the
perturbation of interfacial polymer chains occurs faster than their relaxation
at high velocity. Our simulations reproduce the experimental findings, with
speed-independent friction at low velocity, followed by a friction coefficient
that rises with velocity to some power of order unity. We show that the
velocity-dependent regime is characterized by reorientation and stretching of
polymer chains in the direction of shear, leading to an entropic stress that
can be quantitatively related to the shear response. The detailed exponent of
the power law in the velocity dependent regime depends on how chains interact:
We observe a power close to $1/2$ for chains that can stretch, while pure
reorientation leads to a power of unity. Our simulations quantitatively match
experiments and show that the velocity dependence of hydrogel friction at low
loads can be firmly traced back to the morphology of near-surface chains.

<h3>Conventional Half-Heusler Alloys Advance State-of-the-Art Thermoelectric  Properties</h3>

<br>
<br>
Half-Heusler (HH) phases have garnered much attention as thermally stable and
non-toxic thermoelectric materials for power conversion. The most studied
alloys to date utilize Hf, Zr, and Ti as the base components. These alloys can
achieve a moderate dimensionless figure of merit, ZT, near 1. Recent studies
have advanced the thermoelectric performance of HH alloys by employing
nanostructures and novel compositions to achieve larger ZT, reaching as high as
1.5. Herein, we report that traditional alloying techniques applied to the
conventional HfZr-based half-Heusler alloys can also lead to exceptional ZT.
Specifically, we present the well-studied p-type Hf0.3Zr0.7CoSn0.3Sb0.7,
previously reported to have a ZT~0.8, resonantly doped with less than 1 at. %
metallic Al on the Sn/Sb site, touting a remarkable ZT near 1.5 at 980 K. This
is achieved through a significant increase in power factor, by ~65%, and a
notable but smaller decrease in thermal conductivity, by ~13%, at high
temperatures. These favorable thermoelectric properties are discussed in terms
of a local anomaly in the density of states near the Fermi energy designed to
enhance the Seebeck coefficient, as revealed by first-principles calculations,
as well as the emergence of a highly heterogeneous grain structure that can
scatter phonons across different length scales, effectively suppressing the
thermal conductivity. Consequently, the effective mass is significantly
enhanced from ~ 7 to 10me within a single parabolic band model, consistent with
the result from first-principles calculations. The discovery of high ZT in a
commonly studied half-Heusler alloy through a conventional and non-complex
approach opens a new path for further discoveries in similar types of alloys.
Furthermore, it is reasonable to believe that the study will reinvigorate
effort in exploring high thermoelectric performance in conventional alloy
systems.

Controlling the interplay between localized spins and itinerant electrons at
the oxide interfaces can lead to exotic magnetic states. Here we devise
SrTiO3/LaTiO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures with varied thickness of the LaTiO3 layer
(n monolayers) to investigate the magnetic interactions in the two-dimensional
electron gas system. The heterostructures exhibit significant Kondo effect when
the LaTiO3 layer is rather thin (n = 2, 10), manifesting the strong interaction
between the itinerant electrons and the localized magnetic moments at the
interfaces, while the Kondo effect is greatly inhibited when n = 20. Notably,
distinct Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations are observed and a nonzero Berry phase
of {\pi} is extracted when the LaTiO3 layer is rather thin (n = 2, 10), which
is absent in the heterostructure with thicker LaTiO3 layer (n = 20). The
observed phenomena are consistently interpreted as a result of sub-band
splitting and symmetry breaking due to the interplay between the interfacial
Rashba spin-orbit coupling and the magnetic orderings in the heterostructures.
Our findings provide a route for exploring and manipulating nontrivial
electronic band structures at complex oxide interfaces.

Small spin systems at the interface between analytical studies and
experimental application have been intensively studied in recent decades. The
spin ring consisting of four spins with uniform antiferromagnetic Heisenberg
interaction is an example of a completely integrable system, in the double
sense: quantum mechanical and classical. However, this does not automatically
imply that the thermodynamic quantities of the classical system can also be
calculated explicitly. In this work, we derive analytical expressions for the
density of states, the partition function, specific heat, entropy, and
susceptibility. These theoretical results are confirmed by numerical tests.
This allows us to compare the quantum mechanical quantities for increasing spin
quantum numbers $s$ with their classical counterparts in the classical limit
$s\to \infty$. As expected, a good agreement is obtained, except for the low
temperature region. However, this region shrinks with increasing $s$, so that
the classical state variables emerge as envelopes of the quantum mechanical
ones.

<h3>Double and Quadruple Flat Bands tuned by Alternative magnetic Fluxes in  Twisted Bilayer Graphene</h3>

Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) can host the moir\'{e} energy flat bands with
two-fold degeneracy serving as a fruitful playground for strong correlations
and topological phases. However, the number of degeneracy is not limited to
two. Introducing a spatially alternative magnetic field, we report that the
induced magnetic phase becomes an additional controllable parameter and leads
to the emergence of four-fold degenerate flat bands. This emergence stems from
the band inversion at $\Gamma$ point near the Fermi level with a variation of
both twisted angle and magnetic phase. Using holomorphic functions, which
explain the origin of the double flat bands in the conventional TBG, we can
generate analytical wave functions in the magnetic TBG to show absolutely flat
bands with four-fold degeneracy. In contrast, the conventional TBG has only two
moir\'{e} energy flat bands, and the highly degenerate flat bands in this
magnetic platform might bring richer correlation physics.

The antiferromagnetic (AFM) topological insulator MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ was
believed to have a topological surface state (TSS) with large band gap due to
the ferromagnetic (FM) order on the surface, and be able to host the
long-sought axion states. However, recent angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments indicate that the TSS is gapless,
contradicting the theoretical predictions. Meanwhile, several experiments have
suggested that there is robust out-of-plane FM order on the surface of
MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$. To understand these seemingly contradictory results, we
carry out comprehensive first-principles calculations to investigate the
interplay between the surface magnetism and the TSS. Our calculations provide
direct evidence that in a wide range of parameters, the (nearly) gapless TSS
can coexist with the surface FM order, therefore solving the paradox of the
surface magnetism and the gapless TSS. We further show that proximity effects
can be a promising route to open the gap in the TSS of MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$. Our
research deepens the understanding of the relationship between surface
magnetism and TSS.

<br>
<br>
Friction at water-carbon interfaces remains a major puzzle with theories and
simulations unable to explain experimental trends in nanoscale waterflow. A
recent theoretical framework -- quantum friction (QF) -- proposes to resolve
these experimental observations through nonadiabatic coupling between
dielectric fluctuations in water and graphitic surfaces. Here, using a
classical model that enables fine-tuning of the solid's power spectrum, we
provide evidence from simulations in general support of QF. In particular, as
the principal peak in the solid's power spectrum begins to overlap with water's
Debye and librational modes, we find an increase in friction comparable to that
proposed by QF. At the microscopic level, we find that this contribution to
friction manifests more distinctly in the dynamics of the solid's charge
density than that of water. Our results advocate for experimental verification
of QF by probing the carbon substrate's electronic response, rather than
water's structure or dynamics.

In these lecture notes, we discuss the physics of a two-dimensional binary
mixture of Bose gases at zero temperature, close to the point where the two
fluids tend to demix. We are interested in the case where one of the two fluids
(the bath) fills the whole space, while the other one (the minority component)
contains a finite number of atoms. We discuss under which condition the
minority component can form a stable, localized wave packet, which we relate to
the celebrated "Townes soliton". We discuss the formation of this soliton and
the transition towards a droplet regime that occurs when the number of atoms in
the minority component is increased. Our investigation is based on a
macroscopic approach based on coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations, and it is
complemented by a microscopic analysis in terms of bath-mediated interactions
between the particles of the minority component.

Metallic Mn-based alloys with a nearest-neighbor Mn-Mn distance greater than
0.4 nm exhibit large, well-localized magnetic moments. Here we investigate the
magnetism of tetragonal Au4Mn with a Curie temperature of 385 K, where
manganese has a spin moment of 4.1 muB and its orbital moment is quenched.
Since 80% of the atoms are gold, the spin orbit interaction is strong and Au4Mn
exhibits uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy with surface maze domains at
room temperature. The magnetic hardness parameter of 1.0 is sufficient to
maintain the magnetization along the c-axis for a sample of any shape. Au also
reduces the spin moment of Mn through 5d-3d orbital hybridization. An induced
moment of 0.05 muB was found on Au under a pulsed field of 40 T. Density
functional theory calculations indicate that the Mn-Mn exchange is mediated by
spin-polarized gold 5d and 6p electrons. The distance-dependence shows that it
is ferromagnetic or zero for the first ten shells of Mn neighbors out to 1.041
nm (64 atoms), and very weak and oscillatory thereafter.

Two$-$dimensional (2D) triangular lattices antiferromagnets (2D$-$TLA) often
manifest intriguing physical and technological properties, due to the strong
interplay between lattice geometry and electronic properties. The recently
synthesized 2$-$dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide LiCrTe$_2$, being a
2D$-$TLA, enriched the range of materials which can present such properties. In
this work, muon spin rotation ($\mu^+$SR) and neutron powder diffraction (NPD)
have been utilized to reveal the true magnetic nature and ground state of
LiCrTe$_2$. From high$-$resolution NPD the magnetic spin order at
base$-$temperature is not, as previously suggested, helical, but rather
collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) with ferromagnetic (FM) spin coupling within
the $ab-$plane and AFM coupling along the $c-$axis. The ordered magnetic Cr
moment is established as $\mu_{\rm Cr}=$ 2.36 $\mu_{\rm B}$. From detailed
$\mu^+$SR measurements we observe an AFM ordering temperature $T_{\rm
N}\approx$ 125 K. This value is remarkably higher than the one previously
reported by magnetic bulk measurements. From $\mu^+$SR we are able to extract
the magnetic order parameter, whose critical exponent allows us to categorize
LiCrTe$_2$ in the 3D Heisenberg AFM universality class. Finally, by combining
our magnetic studies with high$-$resolution synchrotron X$-$ray diffraction
(XRD), we find a clear coupling between the nuclear and magnetic spin lattices.
This suggests the possibility for a strong magnon$-$phonon coupling, similar to
what has been previously observed in the closely related compound LiCrO$_2$.

Vacancy ordered halide double perovskites (VODP) have been widely explored
throughout the past few years as promising lead-free alternatives for
optoelectronic applications. Yet, the atomic-scale mechanisms that underlie
their optical properties remain elusive. In this work, a throughout
investigation of the excitonic properties of key members within the VODP family
is presented. We employ ab-initio calculations and unveil critical details
regarding the role of electron-hole interactions in the electronic and optical
properties of VODP. The materials family is sampled based on the electronic
configuration of the tetravalent metal at the center of the octahedron. Hence,
groups with a valence comprised of s, p and d closed-shells are represented by
the known materials Cs$_{2}$SnX$_{6}$, Cs$_{2}$TeX$_{6}$ and Cs$_{2}$ZrX$_{6}$
(with X=Br, I), respectively. The electronic structure is investigated within
the G$_{0}$W$_{0}$ method, while the Bethe-Salpeter equation is solved to
account for electron-hole interactions that play a crucial role in the optical
properties of the family. A detailed symmetry analysis unravels the fine
structure of excitons for all compounds. The exciton binding energy, excitonic
wavefunctions and the dark-bright splitting are also reported for each
material. It is shown that these quantities can be tuned over a wide range,
form Wannier to Frenkel-type excitons, through for example substitutional
engineering. In particular, Te-based materials, which share the electronic
valency of corner-sharing Pb halide perovskites, are predicted to have exciton
binding energies of above 1 eV and a dark-bright splitting of the excitons
reaching over 100 meV. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the
optical properties of the entire family of VODP materials and highlight how
these are not in fact suitable Pb-free alternatives to traditional halide
perovskites.

Motivated by the recent experimental discovery of strongly
surface-plane-dependent superconductivity at surfaces of KTaO$_3$ single
crystals, we calculate the electron-phonon coupling strength, $\lambda$, of
doped KTaO$_3$ along the reciprocal-space high-symmetry directions. Using the
Wannier-function approach implemented in the EPW package, we calculate
$\lambda$ across the experimentally covered doping range and compare its
mode-resolved distribution along the [001], [110] and [111] directions. We find
that the electron-phonon coupling is strongest in the optical modes around the
$\Gamma$ point, with some distribution to higher $k$ values in the [001]
direction. The electron-phonon coupling strength as a function of doping has a
dome-like shape in all three directions, and is largest in the [001] direction
and weakest in the [111] direction. This is in contrast to the experimentally
measured critical temperatures, which are highest for the (111) plane, pointing
to a non-BCS character of the superconductivity. The strong localization of
$\lambda$ in the soft optical modes around $\Gamma$ suggests an importance of
ferroelectric soft-mode fluctuations.

the flow rate $Q$ by up to 70% compared to stationary bottom, but the flow rate
shows a modest increase by further increasing the external shear. Focusing on
the dependency of flow rate $Q$ on orifice diameter $D$, the spheres and rods
show two distinct trends. For rods, in the small aperture limit $Q$ seems to
follow an exponential trend, deviating from the classical power-law dependence.
These macroscopic observations are in good agreement with our earlier
experimental findings [Phys. Rev. E $\textbf{103}$, 062905 (2021)]. With the
help of the coarse-graining methodology we obtain the spatial distribution of
the macroscopic density, velocity, kinetic pressure, and orientation fields.
This allows us detecting a transition from funnel to mass flow pattern, caused
by the external shear. Additionally, averaging these fields in the region of
the orifice reveals that the strong initial decrease in $Q$ is mostly
attributed to changes in the flow velocity, while the weakly increasing trend
at higher rotation rates is related to increasing packing fraction. Similar
analysis of the grain orientation at the orifice suggests a correlation of the
flow rate magnitude with the vertical orientation and the packing fraction at
the orifice with the order of the grains. Lastly, the vertical profile of mean
acceleration at the center of the silo denotes that the region where the
acceleration is not negligible shrinks significantly due to the strong
perturbation induced by the moving wall.

In spintronics, it is important to be able to manipulate magnetization
rapidly and reliably. Several methods can control magnetization, such as by
applying current pulses or magnetic fields. An applied current can reverse
magnetization with nanosecond speed through the spin torque effect. For faster
switching, subpicosecond switching with femtoseconds laser pulse has been
achieved in amorphous rare-earth transition-metal ferrimagnets. In this study,
we employed atomistic simulations to investigate ultrafast switching in a
synthetic antiferromagnet with bilayer amorphous FeGd ferrimagnets. Using a
two-temperature model, we demonstrated ultrafast switching in this synthetic
antiferromagnet without external magnetic fields. Furthermore, we showed that
if we initially stabilize a skyrmion in this heterostructure, the ultrafast
laser can switch the skyrmion state using the same mechanism. Furthermore, this
bilayer design allows the control of each ferrimagnetic layer individually and
opens the possibility for a magnetic tunnel junction.

Structural strain severely impacts material properties such as the linear and
non-linear optical response. Moreover, strain plays a key role, e.g., in the
physics of ferroelectrics and in particular of their domain walls. $\mu$-Raman
spectroscopy is a well-suited technique for the investigation of such strain
effects, as it allows to measure the lattice dynamics locally. However,
quantifying and reconstructing strain fields from Raman maps requires knowledge
on the strain dependence of phonon frequencies. In this work, we have analyzed
both theoretically and experimentally the phonon frequencies in the widely used
ferroelectrics lithium niobate and lithium tantalate as a function of uniaxial
strain via density functional theory and $\mu$-Raman spectroscopy. Overall, we
find a good agreement between our $ab$ $initio$ models and the experimental
data performed with a stress cell. The majority of phonons show an increase in
frequency under compressive strain, while the opposite is observed for tensile
strains. Moreover, for E-type phonons, we observe the lifting of degeneracy
already at moderate strain fields (i.e. at $\pm0.2~\%$) along the x and y
directions. This work hence allows for the systematic analysis of 3D strains in
modern-type bulk and thin-film devices assembled from lithium niobate and
tantalate.

Magnetic topological materials, in which strong correlations between magnetic
and electronic properties of matter, give rise to various exotic phenomena such
as anomalous Hall effect (AHE), topological Hall effect (THE), and skyrmion
lattice. Here, we report on the electronic, magnetic, and topological
properties of Mn$_{3-\it{x}}$Fe$_{\it{x}}$Sn single crystals ($\it{x}$=0, 0.25,
and 0.35). Low temperature magnetic properties have been significantly changed
with Fe doping. Most importantly, we observe that large uniaxial
magnetocrystalline anisotropy that is induced by the Fe doping in combination
with competing magnetic interactions at low temperature produce nontrivial
spin-texture, leading to large topological Hall effect in the doped systems at
low temperatures. Our studies further show that the topological properties of
Mn$_{3-\it{x}}$Fe$_{\it{x}}$Sn are very sensitive to the Fe doping.

Topological Interlocking Structures (TIS) are assemblies of interlocking
building blocks that hold together solely through contact and friction at the
blocks' interfaces, and thus do not require any connective elements. This
salient feature makes them highly energy-absorbing, resistant to crack
propagation, geometrically versatile, and re-usable. It also gives rise to
failure mechanisms that, differently from ordinary structures, are governed by
multiple contact interactions between blocks and frictional slip at their
interfaces. Commonly-used modeling tools for structural analysis severely
struggle to capture and quantify these unusual failure mechanisms. Here, we
propose a different approach that is well suited to model the complex failure
of TIS. It is based on the Level-Set-Discrete-Element-Method, originally
developed for granular mechanics applications. After introducing the basic
assumptions and theoretical concepts underlying our model, we show that it
well-captures experimentally observed slip-governed failure in TIS slabs and
that it estimates the force-displacement curves better than presently available
modeling tools. The theoretical foundation together with the results of this
study provide a proof-of-concept for our new approach and point to its
potential to improve our ability to model and to understand the behavior of
interlocked structural forms.

Strange metals develop near quantum critical points (QCPs) in a variety of
strongly correlated systems. Some of the important issues include how the
quantum critical state loses quasiparticles, how it drives superconductivity,
and to what extent the strange-metal physics in different classes of correlated
systems are connected with each other. In this article, we confront some of
these issues from the vantage point of heavy fermion metals. We will describe
the notion of Kondo destruction and how it leads to a transformation of the
Fermi surface from ``large" to ``small" across the QCP, a loss of
quasiparticles everywhere on the Fermi surface at the QCP, and a dynamical
Planckian scaling in various properties including charge responses. We close
with a brief discussion about the connections between the strange-metal physics
in heavy fermion metals and its counterparts in the cuprates and other
correlated materials.

High-throughput screening of large hypothetical databases of metal-organic
frameworks (MOFs) can uncover new materials, but their stability in real-world
applications is often unknown. We leverage community knowledge and machine
learning (ML) models to identify MOFs that are thermally stable and stable upon
activation. We separate these MOFs into their building blocks and recombine
them to make a new hypothetical MOF database of over 50,000 structures that
samples orders of magnitude more connectivity nets and inorganic building
blocks than prior databases. This database shows an order of magnitude
enrichment of ultrastable MOF structures that are stable upon activation and
more than one standard deviation more thermally stable than the average
experimentally characterized MOF. For the nearly 10,000 ultrastable MOFs, we
compute bulk elastic moduli to confirm these materials have good mechanical
stability, and we report methane deliverable capacities. Our work identifies
privileged metal nodes in ultrastable MOFs that optimize gas storage and
mechanical stability simultaneously.

<h3>Extended Dynamical Mean Field Theory for Correlated Electron Models</h3>

An overarching question in strongly correlated electron systems is how the
landscape of quantum phases emerges from electron correlations. The method of
extended dynamical mean field theory (EDMFT) has been developed for clean
lattice models of the correlated electrons. For such models, not only onsite
Hubbard-like interactions are important, but so are intersite interactions.
Importantly, the EDMFT method treats the interplay between the onsite and
intersite interactions dynamically. It was initially formulated for models of
the two-band Anderson-lattice type with intersite interactions, as well as for
the one-band Hubbard type with intersite Heisenberg-like terms that are often
called Hubbard-Heisenberg models. In the case of Kondo lattice models, the
EDMFT method incorporates a dynamical competition between the local Kondo and
intersite Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions. In these models,
the EDMFT-based analyses led to the notion of Kondo destruction, which has
played a central role in the understanding of quantum critical heavy fermion
metals. In this article, we summarize the EDMFT method, and survey its
applications, particularly for Kondo/Anderson lattice models. We also discuss
the prospect for further developing the EDMFT method, as well as for applying
it to address the correlation physics in a variety of new settings. Among the
latter are the orbital-selective Mott physics that arises both in iron-based
superconductors and in frustrated bulk systems with topological flat bands.

<br>

We analyse the change in the hyperradial Efimovian three-body potential as
the two-body interaction is tuned from the broad to narrow Feshbach resonance
regime. Here, it is known from both theory and experiment that the three-body
dissociation scattering length $a_-$ shifts away from the universal value of
$-9.7 \ r_{\mathrm{vdW}}$, with $r_{\mathrm{vdW}} = \frac{1}{2} \left(m
C_6/\hbar^2 \right)^{1/4}$ the two-body van der Waals range. We model the
three-body system using a separable two-body interaction that takes into
account the full zero-energy behaviour of the multichannel wave function. We
find that the short-range repulsive barrier in the three-body potential
characteristic for single-channel models remains universal for narrow
resonances, whilst the change in the three-body parameter originates from a
strong decrease in the potential depth. From an analysis of the underlying spin
structure we further attribute this behavior to the dominance of the two-body
interaction in the resonant channel compared to other background interactions.

<h3>Observation of the massive Lee-Fukuyama phason in a charge density wave  insulator</h3>

<br>
The lowest-lying fundamental excitation of an incommensurate charge density
wave (CDW) material is widely believed to be a massless phason -- a collective
modulation of the phase of the CDW order parameter. However, as first pointed
out by Lee and Fukuyama, long-range Coulomb interactions should push the phason
energy up to the plasma energy of the CDW condensate, resulting in a massive
phason and a fully gapped spectrum. Whether such behavior occurs in a CDW
system has been unresolved for more than four decades. Using time-domain THz
emission spectroscopy, we investigate this issue in the material
(TaSe$_4$)$_2$I, a classical example of a quasi-one-dimensional CDW insulator.
Upon transient photoexcitation at low temperatures, we find the material
strikingly emits coherent, narrow-band THz radiation. The frequency,
polarization and temperature-dependence of the emitted radiation imply the
existence of a phason that acquires mass by coupling to long-range Coulomb
interaction. Our observations constitute the first direct evidence of the
massive "Lee-Fukuyama" phason and highlight the potential applicability of
fundamental collective modes of correlated materials as compact and robust
sources of THz radiation.

We characterize the self-assembly of colloidal particles with surface mobile
DNA linkers under kinetically limited valence conditions. For this, we put
forward a computer simulation model that captures quantitatively the interplay
between the main dynamic processes governing these systems and allows the
simulation of the long time scales reached in experiments. The model is
validated by direct comparison with available experimental results, showing an
overall good agreement that includes measurements of the average effective
valence and its probability distribution as a function of the density of DNA
linkers on the particles surface. Finally, simulation results are used to
evidence the opposite impact of particle density and characteristic DNA
hybridization time on the effective valence.

Many-body cavity QED experiments are established platforms to tailor and
control the collective responses of ensembles of atoms, interacting through one
or more common photonic modes. The rich diversity of dynamical phases they can
host, calls for a unified framework. Here we commence this program by showing
that a cavity QED simulator assembled from $N$-levels bosonic atoms, can
reproduce and extend the possible dynamical responses after a quench, as a
result of the bosonic statistics of its individual constituents. Specifically,
by initializing the atoms in classical or quantum states, or by leveraging
intra-levels entanglement, we craft on demand the entire
synchronization/desynchronization dynamical crossover of an exchange model for
$SU(N)$ spins. We quantitatively predict the onset of different dynamical
responses by combining the Liouville-Arnold theorem on classical integrability
with an ansatz for reducing the collective evolution to an effective few-body
dynamics. Among them, we discover a synchronized chaotic phase induced by
entangled coherent states and associated to a first order non-equilibrium
transition in the Lyapunov exponent of collective atomic dynamics. Our outreach
includes extensions to other spin-exchange quantum simulators and an universal
conjecture for the dynamical reduction of non-integrable all-to-all interacting
systems.
