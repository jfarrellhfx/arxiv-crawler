<h3>Hydrodynamic pursuit by cognitive self-steering microswimmers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13359" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13359</a>

The properties of biological microswimmers are to a large extent determined
by fluid-mediated interactions, which govern their propulsion, perception of
their surrounding, and the steering of their motion for feeding or in pursuit.
Transferring similar functionalities to synthetic microswimmers poses major
challenges, and the design of favorable steering and pursuit strategies is
fundamental in such an endeavor. Here, we apply a squirmer model to investigate
the pursuit of pursuer-target pairs with an implicit sensing mechanism and
limited hydrodynamic steering abilities of the pursuer. Two hydrodynamic
steering strategies are applied for the pursuer's propulsion direction by
adaptation of its surface flow field, (i) reorientation toward the target with
limited maneuverability, and (ii) alignment with the target's propulsion
direction combined with speed adaptation. Depending on the nature of the
microswimmer propulsion (puller, pusher) and the velocity-adaptation scheme,
stable cooperatively moving states can be achieved, characterized by specific
squirmer arrangements and controllable trajectories. Importantly, pursuer and
target mutually affect their motion and trajectories.

<h3>Universal Correlation Profiles in Single-File Systems</h3>

Single-file transport refers to the motion of particles in a narrow channel,
such that they cannot bypass each other. This constraint leads to strong
correlations between the particles, described by correlation profiles, which
have recently been shown to play a central role in single-file systems. Up to
now, these correlations have only been determined for diffusive systems in the
hydrodynamic limit. Here, we consider a model of reflecting point particles on
the infinite line, with a general individual stochastic dynamics. We show that
the correlation profiles take a simple universal form, at arbitrary time. We
illustrate our approach by the study the integrated current of particles
through the origin, and apply our results to representative models such as
Brownian particles, run-and-tumble particles and L\'evy flights. We further
emphasise the generality of our results by showing that they also apply beyond
the 1d case, and to other observables.

<h3>Transport signatures of plasmon fluctuations in electron hydrodynamics</h3>

In two-dimensional electron systems, plasmons are gapless and long-lived
collective excitations of propagating charge density oscillations. We study the
fluctuation mechanism of plasmon-assisted transport in the regime of electron
hydrodynamics. We consider pristine electron liquids where charge fluctuations
are thermally induced by viscous stresses and intrinsic currents, while
attenuation of plasmons is determined by the Maxwell mechanism of charge
relaxation. We show that while the contribution of plasmons to the shear
viscosity and thermal conductivity of a Fermi liquid is small, plasmon
resonances in the bilayer devices enhance the drag resistance. In systems
without Galilean invariance, fluctuation-driven contributions to dissipative
coefficients can be described only in terms of hydrodynamic quantities:
intrinsic conductivity, viscosity, and plasmon dispersion relation.

<h3>Onion-like Fe3O4/MgO/CoFe2O4 magnetic nanoparticles: new ways to control  magnetic coupling between soft/hard phases</h3>

The control of the magnetization inversion dynamics is one of the main
challenges driving the design of new nanostructured magnetic materials for
magnetoelectronic applications. Nanoparticles with onion-like architecture
offer a unique opportunity to expand the possibilities allowing to combine
different phases at the nanoscale and also modulate the coupling between
magnetic phases by introducing spacers in the same structure. Here we report
the fabrication, by a three-step high temperature decomposition method, of
Fe3O4/MgO/CoFe2O4 onio-like nanoparticles and their detailed structural
analysis, elemental compositional maps and magnetic response. The
core/shell/shell nanoparticles present epitaxial growth and cubic shape with
overall size of (29+-6) nm. These nanoparticles are formed by cubic iron oxide
core of (22+-4) nm covered by two shells, the inner of magnesium oxide and the
outer of cobalt ferrite of ~1 and ~2.5 nm of thickness, respectively. The
magnetization measurements show a single reversion magnetization curve and the
enhancement of the coercivity field, from HC~608 Oe for the Fe3O4/MgO to
HC~5890 Oe to the Fe3O4/MgO/CoFe2O4 nanoparticles at T=5 K, ascribed to the
coupling between both ferrimagnetic phases with a coupling constant of =2
erg/cm2. The system also exhibits exchange bias effect, where the exchange bias
field increases up to HEB~2850 Oe at 5 K accompanied with the broadening of the
magnetization loop of HC~6650 Oe. This exchange bias effect originates from the
freezing of the surface spins below the freezing temperature TF=32 K that
pinned the magnetic moment of the cobalt ferrite shell.

In the present work, we study the dynamics of a magnetic nanoparticle coupled
through the magnetoelectric coupling to the ferroelectric crystal. The model of
our interest is nonlinear, and we explore the problem under different limits of
weak and strong linearity. By applying two electric fields with different
frequencies, we control the form of the confinement potential of the
ferroelectric subsystem and realize different types of dynamics. We proved that
the system is more sensitive to magnetoelectric coupling in the case of
double-well potential. In particular, in the case of strong nonlinearity,
arbitrary small values of magnetoelectric coupling lead to chaotic dynamics. In
essence, magnetoelectric coupling plays a role akin to the small perturbations
destroying invariant tors according to the KAM theorem. We showed that
bifurcations in the system are of Hopf's type. We observed the formation of
magnetoelectric fractals in the system. In the limit of weak nonlinearity, we
studied a problem of parametric nonlinear resonance and enhancement of magnetic
oscillations through magnetoelectric coupling.

<h3>On-off switch and sign change for non-local Josephson diode in  spin-valve Andreev molecules</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13124" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13124</a>
<br>
<i>Erik Wegner Hodt, Jacob Linder</i>
<br>
<br>
Andreev molecules consist of two coherently coupled Josephson junctions and
permit non-local control over supercurrents. By making the barriers magnetic
and thus creating a spin-valve, we predict that a non-local Josephson diode
effect occurs that is switchable via the magnetic configuration of the
barriers. The diode effect is turned on, off, or changes its sign depending on
whether the spin-valve is in a parallel, normal, or antiparallel configuration.
These results offer a way to exert complete control over a non-local Josephson
diode effect via the spin degree of freedom rather than varying a global
magnetic flux which affects the entire system and likely neighbouring
components in a device architecture.

<h3>Accurate temperature evolution of the Kondo peak beyond Fermi liquid  theory</h3>

<br>
<br>
The limitation of Fermi liquid theory to very low energies and temperatures
poses a fundamental problem for describing the temperature evolution of the
Kondo peak. Here Fermi liquid theory for the single impurity Anderson model is
extended beyond the low-energy and low-temperature regime by means of an ansatz
for the impurity self-energy based on the accurate description of the Kondo
peak by the Frota function, the similarity between energy and temperature in
the second-order self-energy, and by exploiting Fermi liquid conditions.
Analytic expressions for the temperature dependence of the Kondo peak height
and width derived from this ansatz are in excellent agreement with numerical
renormalization group data for temperatures beyond the Kondo temperature. The
derived expression thus allows to unambiguously determine the intrinsic Kondo
peak width and Kondo temperature from finite temperature measurements of the
Kondo resonance.

<h3>Spectral Form Factors of Topological Phases</h3>

Signatures of dynamical quantum phase transitions and chaos can be found in
the time evolution of generalized partition functions such as spectral form
factors (SFF) and Loschmidt echos. While a lot of work has focused on the
nature of such systems in a variety of strongly interacting quantum theories,
in this work, we study their behavior in short-range entangled topological
phases - particularly focusing on the role of symmetry protected topological
zero modes. We show, using both analytical and numerical methods, how the
existence of such zero modes in any representative system can mask the SFF with
large period (akin to generalized Rabi) oscillations hiding any behavior
arising from the bulk of the spectrum. Moreover, in a quenched disordered
system these zero modes fundamentally change the late time universal behavior
reflecting the chaotic signatures of the zero energy manifold. Our study
uncovers the rich physics underlying the interplay of chaotic signatures and
topological characteristics in a quantum system.

<h3>Kinked linear response from non-Hermitian pumping</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13139" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13139</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Non-Hermiticity is known to give rise to modified topological bulk-boundary
correspondences, which predict the presence of topological boundary modes
through appropriately modified topological invariants. Yet, little is currently
known about how non-Hermiticity affects the precise linear response of
wavepackets beyond their overall spectral flow. In this work, we discover that
generically, non-Hermiticity gives rise to abrupt and prominent kinks in the
semi-classical wavepacket trajectories of quantum gases, despite the absence of
sudden physical impulses. This physically stems from a hitherto
under-appreciated intrinsic non-locality from non-Hermitian pumping, even if
all physical couplings are local, thereby resulting in enigmatic singularities
in the band structure that lead to discontinuous band geometry and Berry
curvature. For concrete experimental demonstration, we propose an ultracold
atomic setup in a two-dimensional optical lattice with laser-induced loss, such
that response kinks can be observed without fine-tuning in the physical atomic
cloud dynamics. Our results showcases unique non-monotonic behavior from
non-Hermitian pumping beyond the non-Hermitian skin effect, and suggests new
avenues for investigating non-Hermitian dynamics in ultracold atomic platforms.

<h3>Ising Fracton Spin Liquid on the Honeycomb Lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13151" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13151</a>
<br>
<i>Benedikt Placke, Owen Benton, Roderich Moessner</i>
<br>
<br>
We study a classical Ising model on the honeycomb lattice with local two-body
interactions and present strong evidence that at low temperature it realizes a
higher-rank Coulomb liquid with fracton excitations. We show that the
excitations are (type-I) fractons, appearing at the corners of membranes of
spin flips. Because of the three-fold rotational symmetry of the honeycomb
lattice, these membranes can be locally combined such that no excitations are
created, giving rise to a set of ground states described as a liquid of
membranes. We devise a cluster Monte-Carlo algorithm purposefully designed for
this problem that moves pairs of defects, and use it to study the
finite-temperature behavior of the model. We show evidence for a first order
transition from a high-temperature paramagnet to a low-temperature phase whose
correlations precisely match those predicted for a higher-rank Coulomb phase.

<br>
<br>
This paper focuses on creation of a model with explicitly defined symmetry
protected topological (SPT) phases on a triangular lattice, based on $Z_2$
Ising model's ferromagnetic phase. It results in emergence of massless edge
states in non-trivial SPT phases. The Hamiltonian for these edge states
contains four-point spin interactions between next-to-next nearest neighbors. A
generic technique for creating SPT models is developed, allowing for the
construction of translation-invariant edge models.

We report new heat capacity measurements on single crystal Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$
down to $\sim$ 0.1 K in a magnetic field along the $[1,\bar{1}, 0]$ direction.
These new measurements show that the broad hump in the zero-field heat capacity
moves higher in temperature with increasing field strength and is split into
two humps by the $[1,\bar{1}, 0]$ field at $\sim$ 2 T. These separate features
are due to the decomposition of the pyrochlore lattice into effectively
decoupled chains for fields in this direction: one set of chains
($\alpha$-chains) is polarized by the field while the other ($\beta$-chains)
remains free. Our theoretical modelling suggests that the $\beta$-chains are
close to a critical state, with nearly-gapless excitations. We also report new
elastic and inelastic neutron scattering measurements on single crystal
Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ in $[1, \bar{1}, 0]$ and $[0, 0, 1]$ magnetic fields at
temperatures down to 0.03 K. The elastic scattering behaves consistently with
the formation of independent chains for a $[1, \bar{1}, 0]$ field, while the
$[0, 0, 1]$ field produces a single field-induced magnetic Bragg peak at $(0,
2, 0)$ and equivalent wavevectors, indicating a polarized spin ice for fields
above $\sim$ 3 T. For both $[1, \bar{1}, 0]$ and $[0, 0, 1]$ fields, our
inelastic neutron scattering results show an approximately-dispersionless
continuum of scattering that increases in both energy and intensity with
increasing field strength. By modelling the complete set of experimental data
using numerical linked cluster and semiclassical molecular dynamics
calculations, we demonstrate the dominantly multipolar nature of the exchange
interactions in Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and the smallness of the parameter $\theta$
which controls the mixing between dipolar and octupolar degrees of freedom.
These results support previous estimates of the microscopic exchange
parameters.

<h3>The crumpling transition of active tethered membranes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13190" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13190</a>
<br>
<i>M. C. Gandikota, A. Cacciuto</i>
<br>
<br>
We perform numerical simulations of active ideal and self-avoiding tethered
membranes. Passive ideal membranes with bending interactions are known to
exhibit a continuous crumpling transition between a low temperature flat phase
and a high temperature crumpled phase. Conversely, self-avoiding membranes
remain in an extended (flat) phase for all temperatures even in the absence of
a bending energy. We find that the introduction of active fluctuations into the
system produces a phase behavior that is overall consistent with that observed
for passive membranes. The phases and the nature of the transition for ideal
membranes is unchanged and active fluctuations can be remarkably accounted for
by a simple rescaling of the temperature. For the self-avoiding membrane, we
find that the extended phase is preserved even in the presence of very large
active fluctuations.

Nuclear spins and paramagnetic centers in a solid randomly group to form
clusters featuring nearly-degenerate, hybrid states whose dynamics are central
to processes involving nuclear spin-lattice relaxation and diffusion. Their
characterization, however, has proven notoriously difficult mostly due to their
relative isolation and comparatively low concentration. Here, we combine
field-cycling experiments, optical spin pumping, and variable radio-frequency
(RF) excitation to probe transitions between hybrid multi-spin states formed by
strongly coupled electronic and nuclear spins in diamond. Leveraging bulk
nuclei as a collective time-integrating sensor, we probe the response of these
spin clusters as we simultaneously vary the applied magnetic field and RF
excitation to reconstruct multi-dimensional spectra. We uncover complex nuclear
polarization patterns of alternating sign that we qualitatively capture through
analytical and numerical modeling. Our results unambiguously expose the impact
that strongly-hyperfine-coupled nuclei can have on the spin dynamics of the
crystal, and inform future routes to spin cluster control and detection.

<h3>Interplay between self-assembly and phase separation in a  polymer-complex model</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present a theoretical model for predicting the phase behavior of polymer
solutions in which phase separation competes with oligomerization.
Specifically, we consider scenarios in which the assembly of polymer chains
into stoichiometric complexes prevents the chains from phase-separating via
attractive polymer-polymer interactions. Combining statistical associating
fluid theory with a two-state description of self-assembly, we find that this
model exhibits rich phase behavior, including re-entrance, and we show how
system-specific phase diagrams can be derived graphically. Importantly, we
discuss why these phase diagrams can resemble -- and yet are qualitatively
distinct from -- phase diagrams of polymer solutions with lower critical
solution temperatures.

<br>
<br>
Kagome metals with magnetic order offer the possibility of tuning topological
electronic states via external control parameters such as temperature or
magnetic field. ErMn$_6$Sn$_6$ (Er$166$) is a member of a group of $R166$,
$R=$~rare earth, compounds hosting ferromagnetic Mn kagome nets whose magnetic
moment direction and layer-to-layer magnetic correlations are strongly
influenced by coupling to $R$ magnetic moments in neighboring triangular
layers. Here, we use neutron diffraction and magnetization data to examine the
temperature-driven transition in Er$166$ from a planar-ferrimagnetic to
distorted-triple-spiral magnetic order. These data inform mean-field
calculations which highlight the fragile, tunable nature of the magnetism
caused by competing Mn-Mn and Mn-Er interlayer magnetic exchange couplings and
Mn and Er magnetic anisotropies. This competition results in the near
degeneracy of a variety of collinear, non-collinear, and non-coplanar magnetic
phases which we show are readily selected and adjusted via changing temperature
or magnetic field. Thermal fluctuations of the Er moment direction provide the
key to this tunability.

<h3>Planckian dissipation and $c$-axis superfluid density in cuprate  superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13235" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13235</a>
<br>
<i>Sudip Chakravarty</i>
<br>
<br>
An interesting concept in condensed matter physics is Planckian dissipation,
in particular its manifestation in a remarkable phenomenology of superfluid
density as a function of superconducting transition temperature. The concept
was ontroduced for $ab$-plane properties. However, when suitably interpreted,
it can also be applicable to the incoherent $c$-axis resistivity, which has not
been adequately addressed previously. There are two results in this note: the
first is a derivation using Kubo formula as to how Planckian dissipation could
arise. It is aided by the fact that the $c$-axis tunneling matrix element is so
small that a second order perturbation theory combined with presumed non-Fermi
liquid behavior is sufficient to illuminate the phenomonon. In addition, the
notion of quantum criticality plays an important role.

<br>
<br>
Using spin-echo Nuclear Magnetic Resonance in the model Transverse-Field
Ising system TmVO$_4$, we show that low frequency quantum fluctuations at the
quantum critical point have a very different effect on $^{51}$V nuclear-spins
than classical low-frequency noise or fluctuations that arise at a finite
temperature critical point. Spin-echos filter out the low frequency classical
noise but not the quantum fluctuations. This allows us to directly visualize
the quantum critical fan and demonstrate the persistence of quantum
fluctuations at the critical coupling strength in TmVO$_4$ to high temperatures
in an experiment that remains transparent to finite temperature classical phase
transitions. These results show that while dynamical decoupling schemes can be
quite effective in eliminating classical noise in a qubit, a quantum critical
environment may lead to rapid entanglement and decoherence.

We present an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of the
single-layer T*-type structured cuprate SmLa$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ with unique
five-fold pyramidal oxygen coordination. Upon varying oxygen content,
T*-SmLa$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ evolved from a Mott-insulating to a metallic state
where the Luttinger sum rule breaks down under the assumption of a large
hole-like Fermi surface. This is in contrast with the known doping evolution of
the structural isomer La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ with six-fold octahedral
coordination. In addition, quantitatively characterized Fermi surface suggests
that the empirical $T_\mathrm{c}$ rule for octahedral oxygen-coordination
systems does not apply to T*-SmLa$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. The present results
highlight unique properties of the T*-type cuprates possibly rooted in its
oxygen coordination, and necessitate thorough investigation with careful
evaluation of disorder effects.

Coupled two-dimensional electron-hole bilayers provide a unique platform to
study strongly correlated Bose-Fermi mixtures in condensed matter. Electrons
and holes in spatially separated layers can bind to form interlayer excitons,
composite Bosons expected to support high-temperature exciton superfluids. The
interlayer excitons can also interact strongly with excess charge carriers when
electron and hole densities are unequal. Here, we use optical spectroscopy to
quantitatively probe the local thermodynamic properties of strongly correlated
electron-hole fluids in MoSe2/hBN/WSe2 heterostructures. We observe a
discontinuity in the electron and hole chemical potentials at matched electron
and hole densities, a definitive signature of an excitonic insulator ground
state. The excitonic insulator is stable up to a Mott density of ~$0.8\times
{10}^{12} \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ and has a thermal ionization temperature of ~70 K.
The density dependence of the electron, hole, and exciton chemical potentials
reveals strong correlation effects across the phase diagram. Compared with a
non-interacting uniform charge distribution, the correlation effects lead to
significant attractive exciton-exciton and exciton-charge interactions in the
electron-hole fluid. Our work highlights the unique quantum behavior that can
emerge in strongly correlated electron-hole systems.

Recent studies have shown that nonlinear magnetization dynamics excited in
nanostructured ferromagnets are applicable to brain-inspired computing such as
physical reservoir computing. The previous works have utilized the
magnetization dynamics driven by electric current and/or magnetic field. This
work proposes a method to apply the magnetization dynamics driven by voltage
control of magnetic anisotropy to physical reservoir computing, which will be
preferable from the viewpoint of low-power consumption. The computational
capabilities of benchmark tasks in single MTJ are evaluated by numerical
simulation of the magnetization dynamics and found to be comparable to those of
echo-state networks with more than 10 nodes.

(STO) driven by a series of random magnetic field are studied through a
numerical simulation of the Thiele equation. It is found that input-driven
synchronization occurs in the weak perturbation limit, as found recently. As
well, chaotic behavior is newly found to occur in the vortex core dynamics for
a wide range of parameters, where synchronized behavior is disrupted by an
intermittency. Ordered and chaotic dynamical phases are examined by evaluating
the Lyapunov exponent. The relation between the dynamical phase and the
computational capability of physical reservoir computing is also studied.

The dynamics of wire frame particles in concentrated suspension are studied
by means of a 2D model and compared to those of rod-like particles. The wire
frames have bent or branched structures constructed from infinitely thin rigid
rods. In the model, a particle is surrounded by diffusing points that it cannot
cross. We derive a formal expression for the mean squared displacement (MSD)
and, by using a self-consistent approximation, we find markedly different
dynamics for wire frames and rods. For wire frames, there exists a critical
concentration of points above which they become frozen with the long time MSD
reaching a plateau. Rods, on the other hand, always diffuse by reptation. We
also study the rheology through the elastic stress, and more striking
differences are found; the initial magnitude of the stress for wire frames is
much larger than for rods, scaling like the square of the point concentration,
and above the critical concentration, the stress for wire frames appears to
persist indefinitely while for rods it always decays.

Beyond the framework of the bulk-boundary correspondence, we predict the
emergence of a Majorana zero mode that is not bounded at one end of a
topological superconductor as conventional, but splits into multiple parts
which are located at the distant ends of different topological superconductors.
We refer to this remarkable zero mode, which exhibits simultaneously the
Majorana property and extreme nonlocality, as a multi-locational Majorana zero
mode. Specifically, we discuss multi-locational Majorana zero modes in a
three-terminal Josephson junction consisting of topological superconductors,
which forms an elemental qubit of fault-tolerant topological quantum computers.
The multi-locational Majorana zero modes give rise to highly entangled and
anomalously long-ranged nonlocal resonant transport phenomena, which can be
utilized to verify conclusively the realization of a fully functional
topological three-terminal Josephson junction.

The screening response of vortices in kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ was
measured using the ac mutual inductance technique. Besides confirming the
absence of gapless quasiparticles in zero external magnetic field, we observe
the peak effect, manifested in enhanced vortex pinning strength and critical
current, in a broad intermediate range of magnetic field. The peaks are
followed by another crossover from strong to weak pinning, unlike the usual
peak effect that diminishes smoothly at $H_{c2}$. Hysteresis in the screening
response allows the identification of a vortex glass phase which strongly
correlates with the onset of the peaks. A variety of features in the
temperature- and field-dependence of the screening response, corroborated by
resistance and dc magnetization measurements, have allowed us to extract an
$H$-$T$ phase diagram of the vortex states and to infer the irreversibility
line $H_\text{irr}(T)$.

Numerical treatment of two dimensional strongly-correlated systems is both
extremely challenging and of fundamental importance. Infinite projected
entangled-pair states (PEPS), a class of tensor networks, have demonstrated
cutting-edge performance for ground state calculations, working directly in the
thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, in recent years the application of PEPS has
been extended to also low-lying excited states, using an ansatz that targets
quasiparticle states above the ground state with high accuracy. A major
technical challenge for those simulations is the accurate evaluation of
summations of two- and three-point correlation functions with reasonable
computational cost. In this work, we show how a reformulation of $n$-point
functions in the context of PEPS leads to extra contributions to the results
that prove to play an important role. Benchmarks for the frustrated $J_1-J_2$
Heisenberg model illustrate the improved precision, efficiency and stability of
the simulations compared to previous approaches. Leveraging automatic
differentiation to generate the most tedious and error-prone parts of the
computation, the straightforward implementation presented here is a step
towards broader adoption of the PEPS excitation ansatz in future applications.

Numerically exact methods addressing the dynamics of coupled electron--phonon
systems have been intensively developed. Nevertheless, the corresponding
results for the electron mobility $\mu_\mathrm{dc}$ are scarce, even for the
one-dimensional (1d) Holstein model. Building on our recent progress on
single-particle properties, here, we develop the momentum-space hierarchical
equations of motion (HEOM) method to evaluate real-time two-particle
correlation functions of the 1d Holstein model at finite temperature. We
compute numerically exact dynamics of the current--current correlation function
up to real times sufficiently long to capture the electron's diffusive motion
and provide reliable results for $\mu_\mathrm{dc}$ in a wide range of model
parameters. In contrast to the smooth ballistic-to-diffusive crossover in the
weak-coupling regime, we observe a temporally limited slow-down of the electron
on intermediate time scales already in the intermediate-coupling regime, which
translates to a finite-frequency peak in the optical response. Our
momentum-space formulation lowers the numerical effort with respect to existing
HEOM-method implementations, while we remove the numerical instabilities
inherent to the undamped-mode HEOM by devising an appropriate hierarchy closing
scheme. Still, our HEOM remains unstable at too low temperatures, for too
strong electron--phonon coupling, and for too fast phonons.

Noisy and ac forcing can cooperatively lead to the emergence of sine-Gordon
breathers robust to dissipation. This phenomenon is studied, for both Neumann
and periodic boundary conditions (NBC and PBC, respectively), at different
values of the main system parameters, such as the noise intensity and the ac
frequency-amplitude pair. In all the considered cases, nonmonotonicities of the
probability of generating only breathers versus the noise strength are
observed, implying that optimal noise ranges for the breather formation process
exist. Within the latter scenarios, the statistics of the breathers' number,
position, and amplitude are analyzed. The number of breathers is found to grow,
on average, with the noise amplitude. The breathers' spatial distribution is
sharply peaked at the system's edges for NBC, whereas it is essentially uniform
for PBC. The average breather amplitude is dictated by the ac
frequency-amplitude pair. Finally, a size analysis shows that the minimum
system length for the generation mechanism is given by the typical breather
half-width (width) in NBC (PBC).

We present an artificial intelligence (AI) method for automatically computing
the melting point based on coexistence simulations in the NPT ensemble. Given
the interatomic interaction model, the method makes decisions regarding the
number of atoms and temperature at which to conduct simulations, and based on
the collected data predicts the melting point along with the uncertainty, which
can be systematically improved with more data. We demonstrate how incorporating
physical models of the solid-liquid coexistence evolution enhances the AI
method's accuracy and enables optimal decision-making to effectively reduce
predictive uncertainty. To validate our approach, we compare our results with
approximately 20 melting point calculations from the literature. Remarkably, we
observe significant deviations in about one-third of the cases, underscoring
the need for accurate and reliable AI-based algorithms for materials property
calculations.

<h3>Phonon Frequency and its Modification by Magnon-Phonon Coupling from  All-Temperature Theory of Magnon</h3>

<br>
The all-temperature magnon (ATM) theory [J. Phys. Condens. Matter 21,
336003/1-14, 2009] has been used to analyze the temperature dependence of
magnetization as well as the internal energy components of a mono-domain
ferromagnetic solid. The critical exponents have been in better agreement with
experiment than their mean-field theory and critical phenomenon theory
counterparts, and unlike in the latter theories, vary from one ferromagnet to
another. Expressions have been derived for the thermally averaged spin-center
force constants and their break-up in terms of the base-line related (solid)
and exchange-cum-field mediated (magnetic) components. These components give
rise to expressions for phonon frequencies and their modifications by
magnon-phonon coupling. The derived expressions are suitable for a correct
quantum chemical evaluation of the involved properties. A detailed numerical
calculation using spin configurations at varying crystal geometries is hardly
possible even today and beyond the scope of the present work. The focus here is
on the correctness and explaining the trends of properties. It has been shown
that the frequency modification by magnon-phonon interaction can be negative
for certain phonon branches near the ferromagnetic transition temperature.
Also, the ratio of frequency modification and phonon frequency is approximately
proportional to the ratio of curvatures of the involved energy surfaces.

Being able to control the neutral excitonic flux is a mandatory step for the
development of future room-temperature two-dimensional excitonic devices.
Semiconducting Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMD-ML) with
extremely robust and mobile excitons are highly attractive in this regard.
However, generating an efficient and controlled exciton transport over long
distances is a very challenging task. Here we demonstrate that an atomically
sharp TMD-ML lateral heterostructure (MoSe$_{2}$-WSe$_{2}$) transforms the
isotropic exciton diffusion into a unidirectional excitonic flow through the
junction. Using tip-enhanced photoluminescence spectroscopy (TEPL) and a
modified exciton transfer model, we show a discontinuity of the exciton density
distribution on each side of the interface. We introduce the concept of exciton
Kapitza resistance, by analogy with the interfacial thermal resistance referred
to as Kapitza resistance. By comparing different heterostructures with or
without top hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layer, we deduce that the transport
properties can be controlled, over distances far greater than the junction
width, by the exciton density through near-field engineering and/or laser power
density. This work provides a new approach for controlling the neutral exciton
flow, which is key toward the conception of excitonic devices.

The unique physical, mechanical, chemical, optical, and electronic properties
of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) make it a promising two-dimensional material
for electronic, optoelectronic, nanophotonic, and quantum devices. Here we
report on the changes in hBN's properties induced by isotopic purification in
both boron and nitrogen. Previous studies on isotopically pure hBN have focused
on purifying the boron isotope concentration in hBN from its natural
concentration (approximately 20 at$\%$ $^{10}$B, 80 at$\%$ $^{11}$B) while
using naturally abundant nitrogen (99.6 at$\%$ $^{14}$N, 0.4 at$\%$ $^{15}$N),
i.e. almost pure $^{14}$N. In this study, we extend the class of
isotopically-purified hBN crystals to $^{15}$N. Crystals in the four
configurations, namely h$^{10}$B$^{14}$N, h$^{11}$B$^{14}$N, h$^{10}$B$^{15}$N,
and h$^{11}$B$^{15}$N, were grown by the metal flux method using boron and
nitrogen single isotope ($>99\%$) enriched sources, with nickel plus chromium
as the solvent. In-depth Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies demonstrate
the high quality of the monoisotopic hBN crystals with vibrational and optical
properties of the $^{15}$N-purified crystals at the state of the art of
currently available $^{14}$N-purified hBN. The growth of high-quality
h$^{10}$B$^{14}$N, h$^{11}$B$^{14}$N, h$^{10}$B$^{15}$N, and h$^{11}$B$^{15}$N
opens exciting perspectives for thermal conductivity control in heat

It is commonly believed that the most efficient way to pack a finite number
of equal-sized spheres is by arranging them tightly in a cluster. However,
mathematicians have conjectured that a linear arrangement may actually result
in the densest packing. Here, our combined experimental and simulation study
provides a realization of the finite sphere packing problem by studying
non-close-packed arrangements of colloids in a flaccid lipid vesicle. We map
out a state diagram displaying linear, planar and cluster conformations of
spheres, as well as bistable states which alternate between cluster-plate and
plate-linear conformations due to membrane fluctuations. Finally, by
systematically analyzing truncated polyhedral packings, we identify clusters of
$56\leq N \leq 70$ spheres, excluding $N=57$ and 63, that pack more efficiently
than linear arrangements.

In the field of plane elasticity, complexities arising from geometric
properties and applied forces often present substantial challenges to existing
methods. Some specific situations where these limitations emerge are when
considering problems with a non-vanishing traction, non-zero forces of specific
forms, and ring-shaped domains. This paper addresses these issues by developing
an approach that leverages established knowledge of the Neumann problem for the
inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann problem. We propose an integral representation
method for solutions applicable to domains that can be conformally mapped from
a unit disk or an annulus. We demonstrate the practicality and applicability of
this method through specific examples, including a notch problem in a cardioid
domain, a ring domain with shifted hole, and gear-like domain. We hope the
techniques presented in this work will find themselves useful for people
working on isotropic planar elastostatics problems.

We investigate theoretically the momentum-dependent frequency and damping of
low-lying collective excitations of superconductors and charged superfluids in
the BCS-BEC crossover regime. The study is based on the Gaussian
pair-and-density fluctuation method for the propagator of Gaussian fluctuations
of the pair and density fields. Eigenfrequencies and damping rates are
determined in a mutually consistent nonperturbative way as complex poles of the
fluctuation propagator. Particular attention is paid to new features with
respect to preceding theoretical studies, which were devoted to collective
excitations of superconductors in the far BCS regime. We find that at a
sufficiently strong coupling, new branches of collective excitations appear,
which manifest different behavior as functions of the momentum and the
temperature.

X-ray diffraction from dislocation half-loops consisting of a misfit segment
and two threading arms extending from it to the surface is calculated by the
Monte Carlo method. The diffraction profiles and reciprocal space maps are
controlled by the ratio of the total lengths of the misfit and the threading
segments of the half-loops. A continuous transformation from the diffraction
characteristic of misfit dislocations to that of threading dislocations with
increasing thickness of an epitaxial film is studied. Diffraction from
dislocations with edge and screw threading arms is considered and the
contributions of both types of dislocations are compared.

Although well described by mean-field theory in the thermodynamic limit,
scaling has long been puzzling for finite systems in high dimensions. This
raised questions about the efficacy of the renormalization group and
foundational concepts such as universality, finite-size scaling and
hyperscaling, until recently believed not to be applicable above the upper
critical dimension. Significant theoretical progress has been made resolving
these issues, and tested in numerous simulational studies of spin models. This
progress rests upon superlinearity of correlation length, a notion that for a
long time encountered resistance but is now broadly accepted. Percolation
theory brings added complications such as proliferation of interpenetrating
clusters in apparent conflict with suggestions coming from random-graph
asymptotics and a dearth of reliable simulational guidance. Here we report on
recent theoretical progress in percolation theory in the renormalization group
framework in high dimensions that accommodates superlinear correlation and
renders most of the above concepts mutually compatible under different boundary
conditions. Results from numerical simulations for free and periodic boundary
conditions which differentiate between previously competing theories are also
presented. Although still fragmentary, these Monte Carlo results support the
new framework which restores the renormalization group and foundational
concepts on which it rests.

We model the isotropic depinning transition of a domain-wall using a two
dimensional Ginzburg-Landau scalar field instead of a directed elastic string
in a random media. An exact algorithm accurately targets both the critical
depinning field and the critical configuration for each sample. For random bond
disorder of weak strength $\Delta$, the critical field scales as $\Delta^{4/3}$
in agreement with the predictions for the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson elastic
model. However, critical configurations display overhangs beyond a
characteristic length $l_{\tt 0} \sim \Delta^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha\approx
2.2$, indicating a finite-size crossover. At the large scales, overhangs
recover the orientational symmetry which is broken by directed elastic
interfaces. We obtain quenched Edwards-Wilkinson exponents below $l_{\tt 0}$
and invasion percolation depinning exponents above $l_{\tt 0}$. A full picture
of domain wall isotropic depinning in two dimensions is hence proposed.

Jamming is a ubiquitous phenomenon that appears in many soft matter systems,
including granular materials, foams, colloidal suspensions, emulsions,
polymers, and cells -- when jamming occurs, the system undergoes a transition
from flow-like to solid-like states. Conventionally, the jamming transition
occurs when the system reaches a threshold jamming density under isotropic
compression, but recent studies reveal that jamming can also be induced by
shear. Shear jamming has attracted much interest in the context of
non-equilibrium phase transitions, mechanics and rheology of amorphous
materials. Here we review the phenomenology of shear jamming and its related
physics. We first describe basic observations obtained in experiments and
simulations, and results from theories. Shear jamming is then demonstrated as a
"bridge" that connects the rheology of athermal soft spheres and thermal hard
spheres. Based on a generalized jamming phase diagram, a universal description
is provided for shear jamming in frictionless and frictional systems. We
further review the isostaticity and criticality of the shear jamming
transition, and the elasticity of shear jammed solids. The broader relevance of
shear jamming is discussed, including its relation to other phenomena such as
shear hardening, dilatancy, fragility, and discrete shear thickening.

<br>
<br>
Modulation of magnetic properties through voltage-driven ion motion and redox
processes, i.e., magneto-ionics, is a unique approach to control magnetism with
electric field for low-power memory and spintronic applications. So far,
magneto-ionics has been achieved through direct electrical connections to the
actuated material. Here we evidence that an alternative way to reach such
control exists in a wireless manner. Induced polarization in the conducting
material immersed in the electrolyte, without direct wire contact, promotes
wireless bipolar electrochemistry, an alternative pathway to achieve
voltage-driven control of magnetism based on the same electrochemical processes
involved in direct-contact magneto-ionics. A significant tunability of
magnetization is accomplished for cobalt nitride thin films, including
transitions between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states. Such effects can be
either volatile or non-volatile depending on the electrochemical cell
configuration. These results represent a fundamental breakthrough that may
inspire future device designs for applications in bioelectronics, catalysis,
neuromorphic computing, or wireless communications.

Spin-glasses constitute a well-grounded framework for evolutionary models. Of
particular interest for (some of) these models is the lack of self-averaging of
their order parameters (e.g. the Hamming distance between the genomes of two
individuals), even in asymptotic limits, much as like the behavior of the
overlap between the configurations of two replica in mean-field spin-glasses.
In the latter, this lack of self-averaging is related to peculiar fluctuations
of the overlap, known as Ghirlanda-Guerra identities and Aizenman-Contucci
polynomials, that cover a pivotal role in describing the ultrametric structure
of the spin-glass landscape. As for evolutionary models, such identities may
therefore be related to a taxonomic classification of individuals, yet a full
investigation on their validity is missing. In this paper, we study ultrametric
identities in simple cases where solely random mutations take place, while
selective pressure is absent, namely in {\em flat landscape} models. In
particular, we study three paradigmatic models in this setting: the {\em one
parent model} (which, by construction, is ultrametric at the level of single
individuals), the {\em homogeneous population model} (which is replica
symmetric), and the {\em species formation model} (where a broken-replica
scenario emerges at the level of species). We find analytical and numerical
evidence that in the first and in the third model nor the Ghirlanda-Guerra
neither the Aizenman-Contucci constraints hold, rather a new class of
ultrametric identities is satisfied; in the second model all these constraints
hold trivially. Very preliminary results on a real biological human genome
derived by {\em The 1000 Genome Project Consortium} and on two artificial human
genomes (generated by two different types neural networks) seem in better
agreement with these new identities rather than the classic ones.

Most iterative neural network training methods use estimates of the loss
function over small random subsets (or minibatches) of the data to update the
parameters, which aid in decoupling the training time from the (often very
large) size of the training datasets. Here, we show that a minibatch approach
can also be used to train neural network ensembles (NNEs) via trajectory
methods in a highly efficent manner. We illustrate this approach by training
NNEs to classify images in the MNIST datasets. This method gives an improvement
to the training times, allowing it to scale as the ratio of the size of the
dataset to that of the average minibatch size which, in the case of MNIST,
gives a computational improvement typically of two orders of magnitude. We
highlight the advantage of using longer trajectories to represent NNEs, both
for improved accuracy in inference and reduced update cost in terms of the
samples needed in minibatch updates.

which permits flexible fabrications of non-Hermitian systems by introducing
non-Hermitian terms. Here, nonreciprocal coupling terms are realized by
utilizing a voltage follower module in non-Hermitian topological electric
circuits. We report the experimental realization of one- and two- dimensional
non-Hermitian skin interface states in electric circuits, where interface
states induced by non-Hermitian skin effects are localized at the interface of
different domains carrying different winding numbers. Our electric circuit
system provides a readily accessible platform to explore non-Hermitian-induced
topological phases, and paves a new road for device applications.

Oxidation of graphite and subsequent exfoliation leads to single layer
graphene oxide (GO). GO has found many applications across diverse fields
including medicinal chemistry, catalysis as well as a precursor for graphene.
One of the key structural features of GO is the presence of different kinds of
defects. Molecular dynamics simulations with ReaxFF force fields have been
widely used to model realistic representations of GO that include defects of
various types. In these simulations, one can vary the extent and distribution
of the defects by changing the initial O/C ratio. It is therefore very
important to employ a proper measure of the defect density. Traditionally, the
total number of non-graphitic carbon atoms have been employed to quantify the
amount of defects. Our simulations suggest that this parameter may not be a
good measure at low defect densities. Herein, we introduce a hitherto
unexplored metric, relative area of the defects, to gauge the defect density.
We show that this metric has desirable properties at both low and high defect
densities. Additionally, we investigate the changes in the defect distribution
and mechanical properties upon varying the size of the simulation cell.

<h3>Role of Dimensionality and Size in Controlloing the Drag Seebeck  Coefficient of Doped Silicon Nanostructures: A Fundamental Understanding</h3>

In this theoretical study, we examine the influence of dimensionality, size
reduction, and heattransport direction on the phonon-drag contribution to the
Seebeck coefficient of silicon nanostructures. Phonon-drag contribution arises
from the momentum transfer between out-of-equilibrium phonon populations and
charge carriers, and significantly enhances the thermoelectric coefficient. Our
implementation of the phonon drag term accounts for the anisotropy of
nanostructures such as thin films and nanowires through the boundary- and
momentum-resolved phonon lifetime. Our approach also takes into acconout the
spin-orbit coupling, which turns out to be crucial for hole transport. We
reliably quantify the phonon drag contribution at various doping levels,
temperatures, and nanostructure geometries for both electrons and holes in
silicon nanstructures. Our results support the recent experimental findings,
showing that a part of phonon drag contribution survives in 100 nm silicon
nanostructures.

Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy was used to study the features
of the electronic structure of an epitaxial La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 film in the range of
1.2 - 4 eV. The study of the temperature behavior of the MCD spectra made it
possible to establish a correlation between the magnetooptical and transport
properties of the sample. The data obtained were analyzed in comparison with
MCD data for polycrystalline manganite films of various RE1-xAxMnO3
compositions. The MCD spectra of the films were compared with the spectra of
the off-diagonal component of the permittivity tensor calculated from the data
of the magneto-optical Kerr effect for films of the same composition. A unified
set of ground and excited electronic states characteristic of RE1-xAxMnO3
manganites in the visible and near infrared ranges has been identified. These
results are important for a qualitative theoretical description of the
electronic structure of strongly correlated magnetic oxides.

We investigate the conformational properties of a multi-branched polymer
structure with a dendrimer-like topology, known as a snowflake polymer. This
polymer is characterized by two parameters: $f_s$, which represents the
functionality of the central star-like core, and $f$, which represents the
functionality of the side branching points. To analyze the conformational
properties, we have employed various approaches, including analytical methods
based on direct polymer renormalization and the Wei's approach as well as
numerical molecular dynamics simulations. These methods have allowed us to
estimate a size and shape characteristics of the snowflake polymer as functions
of $f$ and $f_s$. Our findings consistently demonstrate the effective
compactification of the typical polymer conformation as the number of branching
points increases. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the
conformational behavior of the snowflake polymer and highlights the impact of
branching parameters on its overall compactness.

<br>
<i>Siyuan Wang, Yanyan Chen, Hongyu Wang, Yuting Hu, Yidun Wan</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, we apply the method of Fourier transform and basis rewriting
developed in arXiv:1910.13441 for the two-dimensional quantum double model of
topological orders to the three-dimensional gauge theory model (with a gauge
group $G$) of three-dimensional topological orders. We find that the gapped
boundary condition of the gauge theory model is characterized by a Frobenius
algebra in the representation category $\mathcal Rep(G)$ of $G$, which also
describes the charge splitting and condensation on the boundary. We also show
that our Fourier transform maps the three-dimensional gauge theory model with
input data $G$ to the Walker-Wang model with input data $\mathcal Rep(G)$ on a
trivalent lattice with dangling edges, after truncating the Hilbert space by
projecting all dangling edges to the trivial representation of $G$. This
Fourier transform also provides a systematic construction of the gapped
boundary theory of the Walker-Wang model. This establishes a correspondence
between two types of topological field theories: the extended Dijkgraaf-Witten
and extended Crane-Yetter theories.

<h3>Spin transport between polarized Fermi gases near the ferromagnetic  phase transition</h3>

<i>Tingyu Zhang, Daigo Oue, Hiroyuki Tajima, Mamoru Matsuo, Haozhao Liang</i>
<br>

We theoretically study the spin current between two polarized Fermi gases
with repulsive interactions near the itinerant ferromagnetic phase transition.
We consider a two-terminal model where the left reservoir is fixed to be fully
polarized while the polarization of the right reservoir is tuned through a
fictitious magnetic field defined by the chemical-potential difference between
different atomic hyperfine states. We calculate the spectra of the spin-flip
susceptibility function, which displays a magnon dispersion emerging from the
Stoner continuum at low momentum in the ferromagnetic phase. Based on the
spin-flip susceptibility and using Keldysh Green's function formalism, we
investigate the spin current induced by quasiparticle and spin-flip tunneling
processes, respectively, and show their dependence on the polarization bias
between two reservoirs. The one-body (quasiparticle) tunneling demonstrates a
linear dependence with respect to the polarization bias. In contrast, the
spin-flip process manifests a predominantly cubic dependence on the bias. While
indicating an enhanced magnon tunneling in the strong-coupling regime, our
results also demonstrate a characteristic behavior around the critical
repulsive strength for ferromagnetic phase transition at low temperatures.

<h3>A coupled approach to predict cone-cracks in spherical indentation tests  with smooth or rough indenters</h3>

<br>
<br>
Indentation tests are largely exploited in experiments to characterize the
mechanical and fracture properties of the materials from the resulting crack
patterns. This work proposes an efficient theoretical and computational
framework, whose implementation is detailed for 2D axisymmetric and 3D
geometries, to simulate indentation-induced cracking phenomena caused by
non-conforming contacts with indenter profiles of arbitrary shape. The
formulation hinges on the coupling of the MPJR (eMbedded Profile for Joint
Roughness) interface finite elements which embed the indenter profile to solve
the contact problem between non-planar bodies efficiently and the phase-field
for brittle fracture to simulate crack evolution and nonlocal damage in the
substrate. The novel framework is applied to predict cone-crack formation in
the case of indentation tests with smooth spherical indenters, with validation
against experimental data. Then, the methodology is employed for the very first
time in the literature to assess the effect of surface roughness superimposed
on the shape of the smooth spherical indenter. In terms of physical insights,
numerical predictions quantify the dependencies of the critical load for crack
nucleation and the crack radius on the amplitude of roughness in comparison
with the behavior of smooth indenters. Again, the consistency with available
experimental trends is noticed.

Spins confined to atomically-thin semiconductors are being actively explored
as quantum information carriers. In transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs),
the hexagonal crystal lattice gives rise to an additional valley degree of
freedom with spin-valley locking and potentially enhanced spin life- and
coherence times. However, realizing well-separated single-particle levels, and
achieving transparent electrical contact to address them has remained
challenging. Here, we report well-defined spin states in a few-layer MoS$ _2$
transistor, characterized with a spectral resolution of $\sim{50~\mu}$eV at
${T_\textrm{el} = 150}$~mK. Ground state magnetospectroscopy confirms a finite
Berry-curvature induced coupling of spin and valley, reflected in a pronounced
Zeeman anisotropy, with a large out-of-plane $g$-factor of ${g_\perp \simeq
8}$. A finite in-plane $g$-factor (${g_\parallel \simeq 0.55-0.8}$) allows us
to quantify spin-valley locking and estimate the spin-orbit splitting
${2\Delta_{\rm SO} \sim 100~\mu}$eV. The demonstration of spin-valley locking
is an important milestone towards realizing spin-valley quantum bits.

<h3>De Haas-van Alphen effect and a giant temperature peak in heavy fermion  SmB$_6$ compound</h3>

<br>
<i>Vladimir A. Zyuzin</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper we give a possible explanation of the giant temperature peak in
the temperature dependence of the amplitude of the dHvA oscillations
experimentally observed in heavy fermion SmB$_6$ compound. We propose a
theoretical model when two species of fermions, one much heavier than the other
and both with electron-like dispersing energy bands, although hybridize to open
up an energy gap at their degeneracy point, but nevertheless keep the system
metallic with a heavy fermion hybrid at the Fermi energy. It is shown that the
heavy fermion hybrid oscillates in the dHvA effect not only with its own Fermi
surface, but also with a surface which does not correspond to any existing
fermion state. The experiment suggests that the values are such that the
surface of the cross-section of the fermion energy bands before they hybridize
approximately equals to the Fermi surface of this unexisting fermion state
after the hybridization. It is exactly this heavy fermion hybrid which results
in the giant temperature peak. A number of new signatures for the experiments
to look for in order to confirm or rule out our explanation is given.

<h3>Correlations in randomly stacked solids</h3>

Packing of spheres is a problem with a long history dating back to Kepler's
conjecture in 1611. The highest density is realized in face-centred-cubic (FCC)
and hexagonal-close-packed (HCP) arrangements. These are only limiting examples
of an infinite family of maximal-density structures called Barlow stackings.
They are constructed by stacking triangular layers, with each layer shifted
with respect to the one below. At the other extreme, Torquato-Stillinger
stackings are believed to yield the lowest possible density while preserving
mechanical stability. They form an infinite family of structures composed of
stacked honeycomb layers. In this article, we characterize layer-correlations
in both families when the stacking is random. To do so, we take advantage of
the H\"agg code -- a mapping between a Barlow stacking and a one-dimensional
Ising magnet. The layer-correlation is related to a moment-generating function
of the Ising model. We first determine the layer-correlation for random Barlow
stacking, finding exponential decay. We next introduce a bias favouring one of
two stacking-chiralities -- equivalent to a magnetic field in the Ising model.
Although this bias favours FCC ordering, there is no long-ranged order as
correlations still decay exponentially. Finally, we consider
Torquato-Stillinger stackings, which map to a combination of an Ising magnet
and a three-state Potts model. With random stacking, the correlations decay
exponentially with a form that is similar to the Barlow problem. We discuss
relevance to ordering in clusters of stacked solids and for
layer-deposition-based synthesis methods.

<h3>Improved Flexible Coaxial Ribbon Cable for High-Density Superconducting  Arrays</h3>

Superconducting arrays often require specialized, high-density cryogenic
cabling capable of transporting electrical signals across temperature stages
with minimal loss, crosstalk, and thermal conductivity. We report improvements
to the design and fabrication of previously published superconducting 53 wt%
Nb-47 wt% Ti (Nb47Ti) FLexible coAXial ribbon cables (FLAX). We used 3D
electromagnetic simulations to inform design changes to improve the
characteristic impedance of the cable and the connector transition. We
increased the center conductor diameter from 0.003 inches to 0.005 inches which
lowered the cable characteristic impedance from $\sim$60 $\Omega$ to $\sim$53
$\Omega$. This change had a negligible impact on the computed heat load which
we estimate to be 5 nW per trace from 1 K to 100 mK with a 1-ft cable. This is
approximately half the heat load calculated for the smallest commercially
available superconducting coax. We also modified the transition board to
include a capacitive coupling between the upper ground plane and signal traces
that mitigates the inductive transition. We tested these changes in a 5-trace,
1-ft long cable at 4 K and found the microwave transmission improved from 6 dB
to 1.5 dB of attenuation at 8 GHz. This loss is comparable to commercial
superconducting coax and 3$\times$ lower than commercial NbTi-on-polyimide flex
cables at 8 GHz. The nearest-neighbor forward crosstalk remained less than -40
dB at 8 GHz. We compare key performance metrics with commercially available
superconducting coax and NbTi-on-polyimide flex cables and we share initial
progress on commercialization of this technology by Maybell Quantum Industries.

<h3>First-principles study of intrinsic and hydrogen point defects in the  earth-abundant photovoltaic absorber Zn3P2</h3>

Zinc phosphide (Zn3P2) has had a long history of scientific interest largely
because of its potential for earth-abundant photovoltaics. To realize
high-efficiency Zn3P2 solar cells, it is critical to understand and control
point defects in this material. Using hybrid functional calculations, we assess
the energetics and electronic behavior of intrinsic point defects and hydrogen
impurities in Zn3P2. All intrinsic defects are found to act as compensating
centers in p-type Zn3P2 and have deep levels in the band gap, except for zinc
vacancies which are shallow acceptors and can act as a source of doping. Our
work highlights that zinc vacancies rather than phosphorus interstitials are
likely to be the main source of p-type doping in as-grown Zn3P2. We also show
that Zn-poor and P-rich growth conditions, which are usually used for enhancing
p-type conductivity of Zn3P2, will facilitate the formation of certain
deep-level defects (P_Zn and P_i) which might be detrimental to solar cell
efficiency. For hydrogen impurities, which are frequently present in the growth
environment of Zn3P2, we study interstitial hydrogen and hydrogen complexes
with vacancies. The results suggest small but beneficial effects of hydrogen on
the electrical properties of Zn3P2.

<br>
<br>
We report a detailed study of the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility
of single crystals of a spin liquid candidate: the hyper-honeycomb Cu oxalate
framework compound [(C$_2$H$_5$)$_3$NH]$_2$Cu$_2$(C$_2$O$_4$)$_3$. The specific
heat shows no anomaly associated with a magnetic transition at low temperatures
down to $T\sim$ 180 mK in zero magnetic field. We observe a large linear-in-$T$
contribution to the specific heat $\gamma T$, $\gamma = 98(1)$ mK/mol K$^{2}$,
at low temperatures, indicative of the presence of fermionic excitations
despite the Mott insulating state. The low-$T$ specific heat is strongly
suppressed by applied magnetic fields $H$, which induce an energy gap, $\Delta
(H)$, in the spin-excitation spectrum. We use the four-component relativistic
density-functional theory (DFT) to calculate the magnetic interactions,
including the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya antisymmetric exchange, which causes an
effective staggered field acting on one copper sublattice. The magnitude and
field dependence of the field-induced gap, $\Delta (H) \propto H^{2/3}$, are
accurately predicted by the soliton mass calculated from the sine-Gordon model
of weakly coupled antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chains with all parameters
determined by our DFT calculations. Thus our experiment and calculations are
entirely consistent with a model of
[(C$_2$H$_5$)$_3$NH]$_2$Cu$_2$(C$_2$O$_4$)$_3$ in which anisotropic magnetic
exchange interactions due to Jahn-Teller distortion cause one copper sublattice
to dimerize, leaving a second sublattice of weakly coupled antiferromagnetic
chains. We also show that this model quantitatively accounts for the measured
temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility. Thus
[(C$_2$H$_5$)$_3$NH]$_2$Cu$_2$(C$_2$O$_4$)$_3$ is a canonical example of a
one-dimensional spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet and not a
resonating-valence-bond quantum spin liquid, as previously proposed.

<i>Stephy Jose, Alberto Rosso, Kabir Ramola</i>
<br>
<br>
We present exact results for the fluctuations in the number of particles
crossing the origin up to time $t$ in a collection of non-interacting run and
tumble particles in one dimension. In contrast to passive systems, such active
particles are endowed with two inherent degrees of freedom: positions and
velocities, which can be used to construct density and magnetization fields. We
introduce generalized disorder averages associated with both these fields and
perform annealed and quenched averages over various initial conditions. We show
that the variance $\sigma^2$ of the current in annealed versus quenched
magnetization situations exhibits a surprising difference at short times:
$\sigma^2 \sim t$ versus $\sigma^2 \sim t^2$ respectively, with a $\sqrt{t}$
behavior emerging at large times. Our analytical results demonstrate that in
the strictly quenched scenario, where both the density and magnetization fields
are initially frozen, the fluctuations in the current are strongly suppressed.
Importantly, these anomalous fluctuations cannot be obtained solely by freezing
the density field.

<h3>Ergodic properties of Brownian motion under stochastic resetting</h3>

<br>
<i>Eli Barkai, Rosa Flaquer-Galmes, Vicenç Méndez</i>
<br>
<br>
We study ergodic properties of one-dimensional Brownian motion with
resetting. Using generic classes of statistics of times between resets, we find
respectively for thin/fat tailed distributions, the normalized/non-normalised
invariant density of this process. The former case corresponds to known results
in the resetting literature and the latter to infinite ergodic theory. Two
types of ergodic transitions are found in this system. The first is when the
mean waiting time between resets diverges, when standard ergodic theory
switches to infinite ergodic theory. The second is when the mean of the square
root of time between resets diverges and the properties of the invariant
density are drastically modified. We then find a fractional integral equation
describing the density of particles. This finite time tool is particularly
useful close to the ergodic transition where convergence to asymptotic limits
is logarithmically slow. Our study implies rich ergodic behaviors for this
non-equilibrium process which should hold far beyond the case of Brownian
motion analyzed here.

<br>
<br>
While the search for topological triplet-pairing superconductivity has
remained a challenge, recent developments in optically stabilizing metastable
superconducting states suggest a new route to realizing this elusive phase.
Here, we devise a testable theory of competing superconducting orders that
permits ultrafast switching to an opposite-parity superconducting phase in
centrosymmetric crystals with strong spin-orbit coupling. Using both
microscopic and phenomenological models, we show that dynamical inversion
symmetry breaking with a tailored light pulse can induce odd-parity (spin
triplet) order parameter oscillations in a conventional even-parity (spin
singlet) superconductor, which when driven strongly can send the system to a
competing minimum in its free energy landscape. Our results provide new guiding
principles for engineering unconventional electronic phases using light,
suggesting a fundamentally non-equilibrium route toward realizing topological
superconductivity.

<br>
The Si/SiO$_2$ interface is populated by isolated trap states which modify
its electronic properties. These traps are of critical interest for the
development of semiconductor-based quantum sensors and computers, as well as
nanoelectronic devices. Here, we study the electric susceptibility of the
Si/SiO$_2$ interface with nm spatial resolution using frequency-modulated
atomic force microscopy to measure a patterned dopant delta-layer buried 2 nm
beneath the silicon native oxide interface. We show that surface charge
organization timescales, which range from 1-150 ns, increase significantly
around interfacial states. We conclude that dielectric loss under time-varying
gate biases at MHz and sub-MHz frequencies in metal-insulator-semiconductor
capacitor device architectures is highly spatially heterogeneous over nm length
scales.

<h3>Classical time crystal Ginzburg-Landau study of coupled parametric  oscillators</h3>

<i>Stuart N. Thomas, Jay D. Sau</i>
<br>
<br>
Discrete time crystals, which are phases of matter that break the discrete
time translational symmetry of a periodically driven system, have generated a
wave of recent interest and activity. In this work, we propose a classical
system of weakly nonlinear parametrically driven coupled oscillators as a
testbed to understand these phases. Such a system of oscillators in the
presence of dissipation has a period-doubling instability only at long
wavelengths where a large number of oscillators are in phase. To show that this
instability leads to a discrete time crystal when exposed to noise and
non-linearity, we derive a general condition to predict when a Markov process
will break time-translation symmetry. The first requirement of this condition
is that the Markov chain over doubled time steps has a stationary probability
distribution that spontaneously breaks a local symmetry. The second requirement
is that the order parameter flips sign over a single time step. We show that
our system of oscillators features period-doubling and yields a stationary
probability distribution given by a spatially continuous Ginzburg-Landau
Hamiltonian with spontaneous symmetry breaking. We then discuss applications of
the general condition to existing time crystal platforms.

<br>
<br>
London penetration depth was measured in niobium foils, thin films, single
crystals, and superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavity pieces cut out from
different places. The low-temperature (T<Tc/3) variation, sensitive to the
low-energy quasiparticles with states inside the superconducting gap, differs
dramatically between different types of samples. With the help of
phenomenological modeling, we correlate these different behaviors with known
pair-breaking mechanisms and show that such measurements may help distinguish
between different pair-breaking mechanisms, such as niobium hydrides and
two-level systems (TLS). The conclusions also apply to SRF cavities when
tracking the temperature-dependent quality factor and the resonant frequency.
