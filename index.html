<h3>Josephson effect in altermagnets</h3>

The ability of magnetic materials to modify superconducting systems is an
active research area for possible applications in thermoelectricity, quantum
sensing, and spintronics. We consider the fundamental properties of the
Josephson effect in a third class of magnetic materials beyond ferromagnets and
antiferromagnets: altermagnets. We show that despite having no net
magnetization, altermagnets induce $0$-$\pi$ oscillations. The decay length and
oscillation period of the Josephson coupling are qualitatively different from
ferromagnetic junctions and depend on the crystallographic orientation of the
altermagnet. The Josephson effect in altermagnets thus serves a dual purpose:
it acts as a signature that distinguishes altermagnetism from conventional
(anti)ferromagnetism and offers a way to tune the supercurrent via flow
direction anisotropy.

<h3>Composite-boson formalism applied to strongly bound fermion pairs in a  one-dimensional trap</h3>

We analyze a system of fermions in a one-dimensional harmonic trap with
attractive delta-interactions between different fermions species, as an
approximate description of experiments involving atomic dimers. We solve the
problem of two fermion pairs numerically using the so-called ''coboson
formalism'' as an alternative to techniques which are based on the
single-particle basis. This allows us to explore the strongly bound regime,
approaching the limit of infinite attraction in which the composite particles
behave as hard-core bosons. Our procedure is computationally inexpensive and
illustrates how the coboson toolbox is useful for ultracold atom systems even
in absence of condensation.

<h3>Inert gas as electronic impurity in semiconductors: The case for active  infrared absorption in silicon</h3>

Inert (noble gas) elements are extremely inactive to surrounding chemical
environment and are frequently employed as protective gas in various
semiconductor fabrication processes. In this work, we surprisingly discover
that high doses of argon up to $10^{17}-10^{20} cm^{-3}$ can be measured in
silicon exposed by laser pulses even after 1300 days. First-principles
calculations and molecular dynamics identify a unique argon-locking-vacancy
(ALV) defect atomic model in silicon. The ALV defect is dynamically robust in
contrast to the frequently moving pure Si vacancy. While argon is chemically
inert, it readily modulates defect states of the occupied vacancy via steric
repulsion and rattling motions, leading to significant band splitting within
bandgap and thus strong infrared absorptions. Moreover, the repulsion between
substitutional argon and dangling bonds results in shallow donors which
explains the confusion of enhanced n-type carriers in experiments. The work
paves a way of using noble gas element to produce active infrared absorption
source for the non-heteroepitaxy photonic detectors directly on silicon wafer
at infrared communication wavelength.

<h3>Strain-programmable van der Waals magnetic tunnel junctions</h3>

The magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) is a backbone device for spintronics.
Realizing next generation energy efficient MTJs will require operating
mechanisms beyond the standard means of applying magnetic fields or large
electrical currents. Here, we demonstrate a new concept for programmable MTJ
operation via strain control of the magnetic states of CrSBr, a layered
antiferromagnetic semiconductor used as the tunnel barrier. Switching the CrSBr
from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic order generates a giant tunneling
magnetoresistance ratio without external magnetic field at temperatures up to ~
140 K. When the static strain is set near the phase transition, applying small
strain pulses leads to active flipping of layer magnetization with controlled
layer number and thus magnetoresistance states. Further, finely adjusting the
static strain to a critical value turns on stochastic switching between
metastable states, with a strain-tunable sigmoidal response curve akin to the
stochastic binary neuron. Our results highlight the potential of
strain-programmable van der Waals MTJs towards spintronic applications, such as
magnetic memory, random number generation, and probabilistic and neuromorphic
computing.

<h3>Impurity induced Modulational instability in Bose-Einstein condensates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03806" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03806</a>
<br>
<i>Ishfaq Ahmad Bhat, Bishwajyoti Dey</i>
<br>
<br>
By means of linear stability analysis (LSA) and direct numerical simulations
of the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii(GP)equations, we address the impurity induced
modulational instability (MI) and the associated nonlinear dynamics in
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). We explore the dual role played by the
impurities within the BECs -- the instigation of MI and the dissipation of the
initially generated solitary waves. Because of the impurities, the repulsive
BECs are even modulationally unstable and this tendency towards MI increases
with increasing impurity fraction and superfluid-impurity coupling strength.
However, the tendency of a given BEC towards the MI decreases with the
decreasing mass of the impurity atoms while the sign of the superfluid-impurity
interaction plays no role. The above results are true even for attractive BECs
except for a weak superfluid-impurity coupling, where the MI phenomenon is
marginally suppressed by the presence of impurities. The dissipation of the
solitons reduce their lifetime and is eminent for a larger impurity fraction
and strong superfluid-impurity strength respectively.

<h3>Deposition of Ga2O3 thin films by liquid metal target sputtering</h3>

<br>
<br>
This paper reports on the deposition of amorphous and crystalline thin films
of Ga2O3 by reactive pulsed direct current magnetron sputtering from a liquid
gallium target onto fused (f-) quartz and c plane (c-) sapphire substrates,
where the temperature of the substrate is varied from room temperature (RT) to
800{\deg}C. The deposition rate (up to 37 nm/min at RT on f-quartz and 5 nm/min
at 800{\deg}C on c-sapphire) is two to five times higher than the data given in
the literature for radio frequency sputtering. Deposited onto unheated
substrates, the films are X-ray amorphous. Well-defined X-ray diffraction peaks
of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 start to appear at a substrate temperature of 500{\deg}C.
Films grown on c-sapphire at temperatures above 600{\deg}C are epitaxial.
However, the high rocking curve full width at half maximum values of {\approx}
2.4-2.5{\deg} are indicative of the presence of defects. A dense and void-free
microstructure is observed in electron microscopy images. Composition analysis
show stoichiometry close to Ga2O3 and no traces of impurities. The optical
properties of low absorptance (<1%) in the visible range and an optical band
gap of approximately 5 eV are consistent with the data in the literature for
Ga2O3 films produced by other deposition methods.

<h3>External screening and lifetime of exciton population in single-layer  ReSe$_2$ probed by time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</h3>

<br>
<br>
The semiconductor ReSe$_2$ is characterized by a strongly anisotropic optical
absorption and is therefore promising as an optically active component in
two-dimensional heterostructures. However, the underlying femtosecond dynamics
of photoinduced excitations in such materials has not been sufficiently
explored. Here, we apply an infrared optical excitation to single-layer
ReSe$_2$ grown on a bilayer graphene substrate and monitor the temporal
evolution of the excited state signal using time- and angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy. We measure an optical gap of $(1.53 \pm 0.02)$ eV,
consistent with resonant excitation of the lowest exciton state. The exciton
distribution is tunable via the linear polarization of the pump pulse and
exhibits a biexponential decay with time constants given by $\tau_1 = (110 \pm
10)$ fs and $\tau_2 = (650 \pm 70)$ fs, facilitated by recombination via an
in-gap state that is pinned at the Fermi level. By extracting the
momentum-resolved exciton distribution we estimate its real-space radial extent
to be greater than 17.1 \AA, implying significant exciton delocalization due to
screening from the bilayer graphene substrate.

<h3>Multi-species generalization of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion  process</h3>

Exclusion processes in one dimension first appeared in the 70s and have since
dragged much attention from communities in different domains: stochastic
processes, out-of-equilibriums statistical physics, and more recently
integrable systems. While the state of the art for a single species totally
asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) can be described, from different
aspects as mature, much less is known when multiple interacting species are
present. Using tools from integrable systems and hydrodynamics in the first
place and stochastic processes in the second place, this work attempts to study
the behavior of a novel version of the model with different species of
particles having hierarchical dynamics that depend on arbitrary parameters.
While Burger's equation famously represents the hydrodynamic limit of TASEP
with a single species, we present a counterpart coupled system of PDE
representing the hydrodynamic limit for a model with two species. The solutions
of these PDEs display a rich phenomenology of solutions best characterized
through the underlying normal modes. This system with two species can be used
as a toy model for studying driven diffusive systems with open boundaries.
Using heuristics, we present results suggesting a general principle governing
the boundary-induced phase diagram of systems with multiple coupled driven
conserved quantities, generalizing thus the extremal current principle known
for the case of a single driven quantity. Using integrability tools, we develop
a formalism allowing the computation of the finite-time probability
distribution of particle positions on the 1D lattice, generalizing therefore
known results for TASEP and other multi-species models. We finally study the
behavior and the impact of a single second-class impurity initially located at
the interface separating two regions of different densities of first-class
particles.

<h3>Study of the de Almeida-Thouless (AT) line in the one-dimensional  diluted power-law XY spin glass</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03615" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03615</a>
<br>
<i>Bharadwaj Vedula, M. A. Moore, Auditya Sharma</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the AT line in the one-dimensional power-law diluted XY spin glass
model, in which the probability that two spins separated by a distance $r$
interact with each other, decays as $1/r^{2\sigma}$. We develop a heat bath
algorithm to equilibrate XY spins; using this in conjunction with the standard
parallel tempering and overrelaxation sweeps, we carry out large scale Monte
Carlo simulations. For $\sigma=0.6$ which is in the mean-field regime, we find
clear evidence for an AT line. For $\sigma = 0.75$, there is evidence from
finite size scaling studies for an AT transition but for $\sigma = 0.85$, the
evidence for a transition is non-existent. We have also studied these systems
at fixed temperature varying the field and discovered that at both $\sigma =
0.75$ and at $\sigma =0.85$ there is evidence of an AT transition! Confusingly,
the correlation length and spin glass susceptibility as a function of the field
are both entirely consistent with the predictions of the droplet picture and
hence the non-existence of an AT line. The evidence from our simulations points
to the complete absence of the AT line in dimensions outside the mean-field
region and to the correctness of the droplet picture. Previous simulations
which suggested there was an AT line can be attributed to the consequences of
studying systems which are just too small. The collapse of our data to the
droplet scaling form is poor for $\sigma = 0.75$ and to some extent also for
$\sigma = 0.85$, when the correlation length becomes of the order of the length
of the system, due to the existence of excitations which only cost a free
energy of $O(1)$, just as envisaged in the TNT picture of the ordered state of
spin glasses. However, for the case of $\sigma = 0.85$ we can provide evidence
that for larger system sizes, droplet scaling will prevail even when the
correlation length is comparable to the system size.

<h3>All Local Conserved Quantities of the One-Dimensional Hubbard Model</h3>

We present the exact expression for all the local conserved quantities of the
one-dimensional Hubbard model. We identify the operators constructing the local
conserved quantities and find they have non-trivial coefficients in the higher
order case. We derive the recursion equation for the coefficients, and some of
them are explicitly given. We also prove the local conserved quantities
obtained in this work are complete.

<h3>Topological order in interacting semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03628" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03628</a>
<br>
<i>Jinmin Yi, Xuzhe Ying, Lei Gioia, A.A. Burkov</i>
<br>
<br>
It has recently been demonstrated that it is possible to open a gap in a
magnetic Weyl semimetal, while preserving the chiral anomaly along with the
charge conservation and translational symmetries, which all protect the gapless
nodes in a weakly interacting semimetal. The resulting state was shown to be a
nontrivial generalization of a nonabelian fractional quantum Hall liquid to
three dimensions. Here we point out that a second fractional quantum Hall state
exists in this case. This state has exactly the same electrical and thermal
Hall responses as the first, but a distinct (fracton) topological order.
Moreover, the existence of this second fractional quantum Hall state
necessarily implies a gapless phase, which has identical topological response
to a noninteracting Weyl semimetal, but is distinct from it. This may be viewed
as a generalization (in a weaker form) of the known duality between a
noninteracting two-dimensional Dirac fermion and QED$_3$ to $3+1$ dimensions.
In addition we discuss a $(3+1)$-dimensional topologically ordered state,
obtained by gapping a nodal line semimetal without breaking symmetries.

<h3>Topological surface states in the Kondo insulator YbB$_{12}$ revealed  via planar tunneling spectroscopy</h3>

<br>
<br>
Planar tunneling spectroscopy of the Kondo insulator SmB$_6$ suggests that an
interaction between the surface Dirac fermions and the bulk spin excitons
results in incompletely protected topological surface states. To gain further
insight into their true nature, it is necessary to study other topological
Kondo insulator candidates. Calculations of electronic energy bands predict
that the Kondo insulator YbB$_{12}$ hosts topological surface states protected
by crystalline mirror symmetry. In this study, we present tunneling conductance
spectra obtained from the (001) surface of YbB$_{12}$ single crystals and
discuss them in comparison to SmB$_6$. The linear conductance at low bias
provides strong evidence for the existence of surface Dirac fermions. The
double-hump structure in the negative bias region is associated with hybridized
band edges, in agreement with a calculated band structure. While these
similarities with SmB6 are suggestive of the existence of topological surface
states in YbB$_{12}$, in agreement with other experiments, some discrepancies
are also observed, which we attribute to a difference in their exact nature
from those in SmB$_6$.

<h3>Dislocation-induced structural and luminescence degradation in InAs  quantum dot emitters on silicon</h3>

<br>
<br>
We probe the extent to which dislocations reduce carrier lifetimes and alter
luminescence and growth morphology in InAs quantum dots (QD) grown on silicon.
These heterostructures are key ingredients to achieving a highly reliable
monolithically integrated light source on silicon necessary for photonic
integrated circuits. We find up to 20-30% shorter carrier lifetimes at
spatially resolved individual dislocations from both the QD ground and excited
states at room temperature using time-resolved cathodoluminescence
spectroscopy. These lifetimes are consistent with differences in the intensity
measured under steady-state excitation suggesting that trap-assisted
recombination limits the minority carrier lifetime, even away from
dislocations. Our techniques also reveal the dramatic growth of misfit
dislocations in these structures under carrier injection fueled by
recombination-enhanced dislocation glide and III-V/Si residual strain. Beyond
these direct effects of increased nonradiative recombination, we find the
long-range strain field of misfit dislocations deeper in the defect filter
layers employed during III-V/Si growth alter the QD growth environment and
introduce a crosshatch-like variation in the QD emission color and intensity
when the filter layer is positioned close to the QD emitter layer. Sessile
threading dislocations generate even more egregious hillock defects that also
reduce emission intensities by altering layer thicknesses, as measured by
transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography. Our work presents a
more complete picture of the impacts of dislocations relevant for the
development of light sources for scalable silicon photonic integrated circuits.

<h3>The distribution of the number of cycles in directed and undirected  random 2-regular graphs</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03686" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03686</a>
<br>
<i>Ido Tishby, Ofer Biham, Eytan Katzav, Reimer Kühn</i>
<br>
<br>
We present analytical results for the distribution of the number of cycles in
directed and undirected random 2-regular graphs (2-RRGs) consisting of $N$
nodes. In directed 2-RRGs each node has one inbound link and one outbound link,
while in undirected 2-RRGs each node has two undirected links. Since all the
nodes are of degree $k=2$, the resulting networks consist of cycles. These
cycles exhibit a broad spectrum of lengths, where the average length of the
shortest cycle in a random network instance scales with $\ln N$, while the
length of the longest cycle scales with $N$. The number of cycles varies
between different network instances in the ensemble, where the mean number of
cycles $\langle S \rangle$ scales with $\ln N$. Here we present exact
analytical results for the distribution $P_N(S=s)$ of the number of cycles $s$
in ensembles of directed and undirected 2-RRGs, expressed in terms of the
Stirling numbers of the first kind. In both cases the distributions converge to
a Poisson distribution in the large $N$ limit. The moments and cumulants of
$P_N(S=s)$ are also calculated. The statistical properties of directed 2-RRGs
are equivalent to the combinatorics of cycles in random permutations of $N$
objects. In this context our results recover and extend known results. In
contrast, the statistical properties of cycles in undirected 2-RRGs have not
been studied before.

<h3>Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics with Hyperbolic van der Waals Materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03712" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03712</a>
<br>
<i>Yuto Ashida, Atac Imamoglu, Eugene Demler</i>
<br>
<br>
The ground-state properties and excitation energies of a quantum emitter can
be modified in the ultrastrong coupling regime of cavity quantum
electrodynamics (QED) where the light-matter interaction strength becomes
comparable to the cavity resonance frequency. Recent studies have started to
explore the possibility to control an electronic material by embedding it in a
cavity that confines electromagnetic fields in deep subwavelength scales.
Currently, there is a strong motivation to realize ultrastrong-coupling cavity
QED in the terahertz (THz) range, since most of the elementary excitations of
quantum materials are in this frequency window. We propose and analyze an ideal
platform to achieve this aim where a two-dimensional electronic material is
encapsulated by a planar cavity consisting of ultrathin polar van der Waals
crystals. As a concrete setup, we show that nanometer-thick hexagonal boron
nitride layers allow for reaching the ultrastrong coupling regime for
single-electron cyclotron resonance in a bilayer graphene. The proposed cavity
setting can be realized by a wide variety of thin dielectric materials with
hyperbolic dispersions. Consequently, van der Waals heterostructures could
provide an ideal playground for exploring the ultrastrong-coupling physics of
cavity QED materials.

<h3>Quantifying Rare Events in Stochastic Reaction-Diffusion Dynamics Using  Tensor Networks</h3>

<br>
<br>
The interplay between stochastic chemical reactions and diffusion can
generate rich spatiotemporal patterns. While the timescale for individual
reaction or diffusion events may be very fast, the timescales for organization
can be much longer. That separation of timescales makes it particularly
challenging to anticipate how the rapid microscopic dynamics gives rise to
macroscopic rates in the non-equilibrium dynamics of many reacting and
diffusing chemical species. Within the regime of stochastic fluctuations, the
standard approach is to employ Monte Carlo sampling to simulate realizations of
random trajectories. Here, we present an alternative numerically tractable
approach to extract macroscopic rates from the full ensemble evolution of
many-body reaction diffusion problems. The approach leverages the Doi-Peliti
second-quantized representation of reaction-diffusion master equations along
with compression and evolution algorithms from tensor networks. By focusing on
a Schl\"{o}gl model with one-dimensional diffusion between $L$ otherwise
well-mixed sites, we illustrate the potential of the tensor network approach to
compute rates from many-body systems, here with approximately $3 \times
10^{15}$ microstates. Specifically, we compute the rate for switching between
metastable macrostates, with the time to compute those rates growing
subexponentially in $L$. Because we directly work with ensemble evolutions, we
crucially bypass many of the difficulties encountered by rare event sampling
techniques$\unicode{x2013}$detailed balance and reaction coordinates are not

<h3>Geometric Study on Canonical Nonlinearity for FCC-based Binary Alloys</h3>

For classical discrete systems under constant composition (typically reffered
to as substitutional alloys), canonical average phi typically provides a
complicated nonlinear map from a set of potential energy surface to that of
macroscropic structure in thermodynamic equilibrium, the so-called canonical
nonlinearity: CN. Although our recent study reveals that the CN can be
reasonablly addressed for individual microscopic configuration by two different
ways of special vector field on configuration space, anharmonicity in the
structural degree of freedoms (ASDF), and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence DKL,
that is the conceptual extention of ASDF to statistical manifold to include
further non-local information about CN, their direct correlation on real
lattices, is still totally unclear. We here tuckle this problem for fcc-based
equiatomic binary alloys that have been most studied in the CN-based context.
We confirm that while one of the contribution to CN of DdG for each
configuration, due to difference in CDOS from Gaussian, exhibits significant
positive correlation with ASDF, another contribution of Dns due to
non-separability in structural degee of freedoms (SDFs) exhibit no effective
correlation with ASDF, which can be naturally accepted since the former
contribution depends on ASDF itself, while the latter is independent. We find
that average of Dns over all configurations for sets of SDFs can be
well-characterized by information about asymmetric Hausdorff distance between
configurational polyhedra (CP) for practical and ideally separable system, and
CP hypervolumes. This fact certainly indicates that non-local information about
CN has profound connection to the geometric configuration for ground-state
structures of alloys on configuration space.

this study, we investigate the gate current and breakdown characteristics of
Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/Si ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs) by using
carrier separation measurements to analyze electron and hole leakage currents
during time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) tests. Rapidly increasing
substrate hole currents and stress-induced leakage current (SILC)-like electron
currents can be observed before the breakdown of the ferroelectric gate
insulator of FeFETs. This apparent degradation under voltage stress is
recovered and the time-to-breakdown is significantly improved by interrupting
the TDDB test with gate voltage pulses with the opposite polarity, suggesting
that defect redistribution, rather than defect generation, is responsible for
the trigger of hard breakdown.

The influence of illumination on a high mobility two-dimensional electron gas
with high concentration of charge carriers is studied in selectively doped
single GaAs quantum wells with short-period AlAs/GaAs superlattice barriers at
a temperature T = 4.2 K in magnetic fields B < 2 T. It is shown that
illumination at low temperatures in the studied heterostructures leads to an
increase in the concentration, mobility, and quantum lifetime of electrons. An
increase in the quantum lifetime due to illumination of single GaAs quantum
wells with modulated superlattice doping is explained by a decrease in the
effective concentration of remote ionized donors.

Spintronic nano-oscillators with reduced non-linearity could offer key
benefits for realizing neuromorphic applications such as spike-based neurons
and frequency multiplexing in neural networks. Here, we experimentally
demonstrate the reduction in non-linearity of a spin-Hall nano-oscillator
(SHNO) by compensation of its effective magnetic anisotropy. The study involves
optimization of Co/Ni multilayer growth to achieve the compensation, followed
by spin diode measurements on patterned microstrips to quantify their
anisotropy. The relation between the second ($H_{k2}$ = 0.47 mT) and the first
order ($H_{k1}^{eff}$ = $-$0.8 mT) anisotropy fields reveals the existence of
an easy cone, thereby validating the presence of compensation. Furthermore, we
demonstrate a synapse based on the compensated spin diode which has a fixed
frequency when the input power is varied. We then study the current-induced
auto-oscillation properties of SHNOs on compensated films by patterning
nano-constrictions of widths 200 and 100 nm. The invariance of the resonance
frequency and linewidth of the compensated SHNO with applied dc current
indicates the absence of non-linearity. This independence is maintained
irrespective of the applied external fields and its orientations. The
compensated SHNO obtained has a linewidth of 1.1 MHz and a peak output power of
up to 1 pW/MHz emulating a nano-neuron with a low linewidth and a fixed
frequency.

<br>
The noncentrosymmetric $R$Al$Pn$ ($R$ = rare earth elements, $Pn$ = Si or Ge)
with space-inversion (SI) and/or time-reversal (TR) symmetry breaking host
multiple types of Weyl fermions, providing a fertile platform for the
exploration of novel topological states. In particular, when the magnetic
configuration is coupled to electronic wavefunctions, exotic anomalous
transverse transport phenomena emerge. Here, by employing electrical and
thermoelectrical transport, we systematically study the ferromagnetic Weyl
semimetal CeAlSi and its nonmagnetic analog LaAlSi. For LaAlSi, an anomalous
Nernst effect (ANE) with an anomalous Nernst angle of $\sim$ 15.4% at 15.3 K is
revealed. In addition, quantum oscillations reveal five frequencies, some of
which possess nontrivial Berry phase. Moreover, a possible temperature-induced
Lifshitz transition is unveiled. For CeAlSi, in addition to the anomalous Hall
effect (AHE), an ANE is also discovered. The AHE and ANE arise in the
paramagnetic state, and then are enhanced when temperature approaches the
ferromagnetic ordering temperature, evidencing the interplay between magnetism
and topology in CeAlSi. High-pressure electrical transport and x-ray
diffraction measurements demonstrate multiple phase transitions, i.e., a
pressure-induced Lifshitz transition at $\sim$ 10 GPa, a magnetic transition
from the ferromagnetic state to a paramagnetic state beyond $\sim$ 20 GPa, and
a structural phase transition at $\sim$ 40 GPa. Under pressure, a sign change
in anomalous Hall resistivity takes place at $\sim$ 5.6 GPa with an enhancement
of anomalous Hall angle. These findings indicate that LaAlSi and CeAlSi provide
unique and tunable platforms to explore exotic topological physics, phase
transitions, and potential platforms for an array of promising applications.

The improved photocatalytic water splitting using 2D materials has
technological importance for economically viable renewable energy. The present
study focuses on the effect of uniaxial, biaxial, and vertical strain on the
energy gap and band edge positions of C2N/MoS2 van der Waals heterostructures
through first-principles density functional theory using PBE and SCAN
functionals. The calculations establish that SCAN functional provides
comparatively much better results as compared to the PBE for the band gap and
band alignment study. The heterostructure exhibits a type- II band alignment
which is beneficial for the efficient separation of charge carriers. For a good
photocatalyst, the band edge positions should straddle the water redox
potentials. It is observed that for both compressive and tensile vertical
strain, the water redox potential values lie within the valence band maximum
(VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) of the heterostructure. On the other
hand, for uniaxial and biaxial strain, the system can be used as a useful
photocatalyst only for larger compressive strain, whereas for tensile strain,
the energy gap between VBM and CBM keeps on decreasing and lie within the water
oxidation/reduction potential. Our study also establishes that the meta-GGA
SCAN functional shows similar results as compared to the computationally
expensive hybrid HSE functionals. The present work can be extremely useful for
experimentalists to design artificial heterostructure devices for better
performance in photocatalytic water splitting.

Vanadium atoms in layered LiVO2 form in-plane periodic vanadium trimers at
low temperatures, but the trimers appear randomly in the stacking direction
because there are many trimer configurations with comparable lattice energy. We
detailed an original modeling scheme to represent glassy states with a
completely disordered trimer configuration in the stacking structure. Through
PDF analysis using this model, we show that the synthesis method can yield two
types of low-temperature stacking structures: a completely disordered stacking
structure and a short-range order in the stacking structure. The phase
transition temperature of the former sample is about 15 K lower than that of
the latter. We discuss that this is due to the strong trimer frustration that
appears in the sample without short-range order, which suppresses the phase
transition temperature, similar to the frustration effect in conventional spin
systems.

<h3>Persistent Josephson tunneling between Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$  flakes twisted by 45$^\circ$ across the superconducting dome</h3>

<br>
<br>
There is a heated debate on the Josephson effect in twisted
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ flakes. Recent experimental results suggest the
presence of either anomalously isotropic pairing or exotic $d$+i$d$-wave
pairing, in addition to the commonly believed $d$-wave one. Here, we address
this controversy by fabricating ultraclean junctions with uncompromised
crystalline quality and stoichiometry at the junction interfaces. In the
optimally doped regime, we obtain prominent Josephson coupling (2-4 mV) in
multiple junctions with the twist angle of 45$^\circ$, in sharp contrast to a
recent report that shows two orders of magnitude suppression around 45$^\circ$
from the value at 0$^\circ$. We further extend this study to the previously
unexplored overdoped regime and observe pronounced Josephson tunneling at
45$^\circ$ together with Josephson diode effect up to 50 K. Our work helps
establish the persistent presence of an isotropic pairing component across the
entire superconducting phase diagram.

Active loop extrusion - the process of formation of dynamically growing
chromatin loops due to the motor activity of DNA-binding protein complexes - is
firmly established mechanism responsible for chromatin spatial organization at
different stages of cell cycle in eukaryotes and bacteria. The theoretical
insight into the effect of loop extrusion on the experimentally measured
statistics of chromatin conformation can be gained with an appropriately chosen
polymer model. Here we consider the simplest analytically solvable model of
interphase chromosome which is treated as ideal chain with disorder of
sufficiently sparse random loops whose conformations are sampled from the
equilibrium ensemble. This framework allows us to arrive at the closed-form
analytical expression for the mean-squared distance between pairs of genomic
loci which is valid beyond the one-loop approximation in diagrammatic
representation. Besides, we analyse the loops-induced deviation of chain
conformations from the Gaussian statistics by calculating kurtosis of
probability density of the pairwise separation vector. The presented results
suggest the possible ways of estimating the characteristics of the loop
extrusion process based on the experimental data on the scale-dependent
statistics of intra-chromosomal pair-wise distances.

<h3>Robust mutual synchronization in long spin Hall nano-oscillator chains</h3>

<br>
Mutual synchronization of N serially connected spintronic nano-oscillators
increases their coherence by a factor $N$ and their output power by $N^2$.
Increasing the number of mutually synchronized nano-oscillators in chains is
hence of great importance for better signal quality and also for emerging
applications such as oscillator-based neuromorphic computing and Ising machines
where larger N can tackle larger problems. Here we fabricate spin Hall
nano-oscillator chains of up to 50 serially connected nano-constrictions in
W/NiFe, W/CoFeB/MgO, and NiFe/Pt stacks and demonstrate robust and complete
mutual synchronization of up to 21 nano-constrictions, reaching linewidths of
below 200 kHz and quality factors beyond 79,000, while operating at 10 GHz. We
also find a square increase in the peak power with the increasing number of
mutually synchronized oscillators, resulting in a factor of 400 higher peak
power in long chains compared to individual nano-constrictions. Although chains
longer than 21 nano-constrictions also show complete mutual synchronization, it
is not as robust and their signal quality does not improve as much as they
prefer to break up into partially synchronized states. The low current and low
field operation of these oscillators along with their wide frequency tunability
(2-28 GHz) with both current and magnetic fields, make them ideal candidates
for on-chip GHz-range applications and neuromorphic computing.

The integration of ferroelectrics that exhibit high dielectric,
piezoelectric, and thermal susceptibilities with the mainstream semiconductor
industry will enable novel device types for widespread applications, and yet
there are few silicon-compatible ferroelectrics suitable for device
downscaling. We demonstrate with first-principles calculations that the
enhanced depolarization field at the nanoscale can be utilized to soften
unswitchable wurtzite III-V semiconductors, resulting in ultrathin
two-dimensional (2D) sheets possessing reversible polarization states. A 2D
sheet of AlSb consisting of three atomic planes is identified to host both
ferroelectricity and antiferroelectricity, and the tristate switching is
accompanied by a metal-semiconductor transition. The thermodynamics stability
and potential synthesizability of the triatomic layer are corroborated with
phonon spectrum calculations, ab initio molecular dynamics, and
variable-composition evolutionary structure search. We propose a 2D AlSb-based
homojunction field effect transistor that supports three distinct and
nonvolatile resistance states. This new class of III-V semiconductor-derived 2D
materials with dual ferroelectricity and antiferroelectricity opens up the
possibility for nonvolatile multibit-based integrated nanoelectronics.

AMX$_3$ compounds are structurally diverse, a notable example being the
post-perovskite structure which adopts a two-dimensional framework with corner-
and edge-sharing octahedra. Few molecular post-perovskites are known and of
these, none have reported magnetic structures. Here we report the synthesis,
structure and magnetic properties of molecular post-perovskites: CsNi(NCS)$_3$,
a thiocyanate framework, and two new isostructural analogues CsCo(NCS)$_3$ and
CsMn(NCS)$_3$. Magnetisation measurements show that all three compounds undergo
magnetic order. CsNi(NCS)$_3$ (Curie temperature, $T_\mathrm{C} = 8.5(1)\;$K)
and CsCo(NCS)$_3$ ($T_\mathrm{C} = 6.7(1)\;$K) order as weak ferromagnets. On
the other hand, CsMn(NCS)$_3$ orders as an antiferromagnet (N\'eel temperature,
$T_\mathrm{N}=16.8(8)\;$K). Neutron diffraction data of CsNi(NCS)$_3$ and
CsMn(NCS)$_3$, show that both are non-collinear magnets. These results suggest
molecular frameworks are fruitful ground for realising the spin textures
required for the next generation of information technology.

<h3>Generational variance reduction in Monte Carlo criticality simulations  as a way of mitigating unwanted correlations</h3>

<br>
Monte Carlo criticality simulations are widely used in nuclear safety
demonstrations, as they offer an arbitrarily precise estimation of global and
local tallies while making very few assumptions. However, since the inception
of such numerical approaches, it is well known that bias might affect both the
estimation of errors on these tallies and the tallies themselves. In
particular, stochastic modeling approaches developed in the past decade have
shed light on the prominent role played by spatial correlations through a
phenomenon called neutron clustering. This effect is particularly of great
significance when simulating loosely coupled systems (i.e., with a high
dominance ratio). In order to tackle this problem, this paper proposes to
recast the power iteration technique of Monte Carlo criticality codes into a
variance reduction technique called Adaptative Multilevel Splitting. The
central idea is that iterating over neutron generations can be seen as pushing
a sub-population of neutrons towards a generational detector (instead of a
spatial detector as variance reduction techniques usually do). While both
approaches allow for neutron population control, the former blindly removes or
splits neutrons. In contrast, the latter optimizes spatial, generational, and
spectral attributes of neutrons when they are removed or split through an
adjoint flux estimation, hence tempering both generational and spatial
correlations. This is illustrated in the present article with a simple case of
a bare slab reactor in the one speed theory on which the Adaptive Multilevel
Splitting was applied and compared to variations of the Monte Carlo power
iteration method used in neutron transport. Besides looking at the resulting
efficiency of the methods, this work also aims at highlighting the main
mechanisms of the Adaptive Multilevel Splitting in criticality calculations.

Most theoretical descriptions of stresses induced by freezing are rooted in
the (generalized) Clapeyron equation, which predicts the pressure that a solid
can exert as it cools below its melting temperature. This equation is central
for topics ranging beyond glaciology to geomorphology, civil engineering, food
storage, and cryopreservation. However, it has inherent limitations, requiring
isotropic solid stresses and conditions near bulk equilibrium. Here, we examine
when the Clapeyron equation is applicable by providing a rigorous derivation
that details all assumptions. We demonstrate the natural extension for
anisotropic stress states, and we show how the temperature and pressure ranges
for validity depend on well-defined material properties. Finally, we
demonstrate how the range of applicability of the (linear) Clapeyron equation
can be extended by adding higher-order terms, yielding results that are in good
agreement with experimental data for the pressure melting of ice.

We image and characterize the mechanical modes of a 2D drum resonator made of
hBN suspended over a high-stress Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane. Our measurements
demonstrate hybridization between various modes of the hBN resonator and those
of the Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane. The measured resonance frequencies and spatial
profiles of the modes are consistent with finite-element simulations based on
an idealized geometry. Spectra of the thermal motion reveal that, depending on
the degree of hybridization with modes of the heavier and higher-quality-factor
Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane, the quality factors and the motional mass of the hBN drum
modes can be shifted by orders of magnitude. This effect could be exploited to
engineer hybrid drum/membrane modes that combine the low motional mass of 2D
materials with the high quality factor of Si$_3$N$_4$ membranes for
optomechanical or sensing applications.

We analyze the statistical properties of radiative transitions for a

distribution analyzed. It is shown analytically that, neglecting molecular
collisions, the velocity distribution function cannot be Gaussian, as the
equilibrium value for the kurtosis $\kappa$ is different from $\kappa=3$. A
Maxwellian velocity distribution can be recovered in the limit of small
radiative friction.

<br>
<br>
A distributional route to Gaussianity, associated with the concept of
Conservative Mixing Transformations in ensembles of random vector-valued
variables, is proposed. This route is completely different from the additive
mechanism characterizing the application of Central Limit Theorem, as it is
based on the iteration of a random transformation preserving the ensemble
variance. Gaussianity emerges as a ``supergeneric'' property of ensemble
statistics, in the case the energy constraint is quadratic in the norm of the
variables. This result puts in a different light the occurrence of equilibrium
Gaussian distributions in kinetic variables (velocity, momentum), as it shows
mathematically that, in the absence of any other dynamic mechanisms, almost
Gaussian distributions stems from the low-velocity approximations of the
physical conservation principles. Whenever, the energy constraint is not
expressed in terms of quadratic functions (as in the relativistic case), the
Juttner distribution is recovered from CMT.

We study the optimal performance of an endoreversible quantum dot heat
engine, in which the heat transfer between the system and baths is mediated by
qubits, operating under the conditions of a trade-off objective function known
as maximum efficient power function defined by the product of power and
efficiency of the engine. First, we numerically study the optimization of the
efficient power function for the engine under consideration. Then, we obtain
some analytic results by applying hightemperature limit and compare the
performance of the engine at maximum efficient power functionto the engine
operating in the maximum power regime. We find that the engine operating at
maximum efficient power function produces at least 88.89% of the maximum power
output while at the same time reduces the power loss due to entropy production
by considerable amount. We conclude by studying the stochastic simulations of
the efficiency of the engine in maximum power and maximum efficient power
regime. We find that the engine operating at maximum power is subjected to less
power fluctuations as compared to the on one operating at maximum efficient
power function.

<br>
The discovery of superconductivity in the quantum critical Kondo-lattice
system YbRh2Si2 at an extremely low temperature of 2 mK has inspired efforts to
perform high-resolution electrical resistivity measurements down to this
temperature range in highly conductive materials. Here we show that control
over the sample geometry by microstructuring using focused-ion-beam (FIB)
techniques allows to reach ultra-low temperatures and increase signal-to-noise
ratios (SNR) tenfold, without adverse effects to sample quality. In five
experiments we show four-terminal sensing resistance and magnetoresistance
measurements which exhibit sharp phase transitions at the N\'eel temperature,
and Shubnikov-de-Haas (SdH) oscillations between 13 T and 18 T where we
identified a new SdH frequency of 0.39 kT. The increased SNR allowed resistance
fluctuation (noise) spectroscopy that would not be possible for bulk crystals,
and confirmed intrinsic 1/f-type fluctuations. Under controlled strain, two
thin microstructured samples exhibited a large increase of T_N from 67 mK up to
188 mK while still showing clear signatures of the phase transition and SdH
oscillations. SQUID-based thermal noise spectroscopy measurements in a nuclear
demagnetisation refrigerator down to 0.95 mK, show a sharp superconducting
transition at T_c = 1.2 mK. These experiments demonstrate microstructuring as a
powerful tool to investigate the resistance and the noise spectrum of highly
conductive correlated metals over wide temperature ranges.

Ni-Mn-based Heusler alloys, in particular all-d-metal Ni(-Co)-Mn-Ti, are
highly promising materials for energy-efficient solid-state refrigeration as
large multicaloric effects can be achieved across their magnetostructural
martensitic transformation. However, no comprehensive study on the crucially
important transition entropy change $\Delta s_t$ exists so far for
Ni(-Co)-Mn-Ti. Here, we present a systematic study analyzing the composition
and temperature dependence of $\Delta s_t$. Our results reveal a substantial
structural entropy change contribution of approximately 65 J(kgK)$^{-1}$, which
is compensated at lower temperatures by an increasingly negative entropy change
associated with the magnetic subsystem. This leads to compensation temperatures
$T_{comp}$ of 75 K and 300 K in Ni$_{35}$Co$_{15}$Mn$_{50-y}$Ti$_{y}$ and
Ni$_{33}$Co$_{17}$Mn$_{50-y}$Ti$_{y}$, respectively, below which the
martensitic transformations are arrested. In addition, we simultaneously
measured the responses of the magnetic, structural and electronic subsystems to
the temperature- and field-induced martensitic transformation near $T_{comp}$,
showing an abnormal increase of hysteresis and consequently dissipation energy
at cryogenic temperatures. Simultaneous measurements of magnetization and
adiabatic temperature change $\Delta T_{ad}$ in pulsed magnetic fields reveal a
change in sign of $\Delta T_{ad}$ and a substantial positive and irreversible
$\Delta T_{ad}$ up to 15 K at 15 K as a consequence of increased dissipation
losses and decreased heat capacity. Most importantly, this phenomenon is
universal, it applies to any first-order material with non-negligible
hysteresis and any stimulus, effectively limiting the utilization of their
caloric effects for gas liquefaction at cryogenic temperatures.

The residual stress plays a vital role in determination of the device
performance that uses thin films coating and thus the accurate determination of
stress and its optimization with process parameters is an ongoing research work
for many decades. In line with this, the microscopic origin of the stress at
the atomic scale and its development during the thin film deposition is a
matter of major scientific interests. The development of stress is a complex
phenomenon and has a complex dependence to process parameters, film
microstructure and its morphology. In this work, by utilizing a custom-designed
cathodic arc deposition system and synchrotron radiation based 2D x-ray
diffraction (XRD) technique, we determine the real-time evolution of stress,
crystallite sizes and their preferential orientations of
Aluminum-Titanium-Nitride (AlxTi1-xN) films with varied Al-content (x=0.0,
0.25, 0.50, and 0.67) on Si-100 substrate. The energies of incoming ions and
hence stress in the films is tuned by applying different direct current
substrate bias (Vs = floating potential, -20, -40, -60, -80, and -100 V). The
instantaneous stress is evaluated by the well-known d vs. sin2{\psi} technique,
while crystallite sizes are determined by analyzing line profiles of x-ray
diffractograms. The evolution of stress and crystallite sizes are modelled with
multiple numerical models from which kinetic parameters associated with the
thin film depositions are extracted. The ex-situ microstructure
characterizations of AlxTi1-xN coatings are carried out by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The formation of
ex-situ microstructure of the films is discussed considering the results
obtained from in-situ XRD data. Finally, we demonstrate that the method
utilized here is a powerful approach towards estimation of the fracture
toughness of thin film coatings.

Majorana fermions that emerge on the surface of topological superconductors
are charge neutral but can have higher-rank electric multipoles by allowing for
account time-reversal and crystalline symmetries. Applying the general
classification of these multipoles, we show that the spin current of Majorana
fermions is driven by spatially nonuniform dynamic strains on the (001) surface
of superconducting antiperovskite Sr3SnO. We also find that the frequency
dependence of the Majorana spin current reflects the energy dispersion of
Majorana fermions. Our results suggest that the spin current can be a probe for
Majorana fermions.

Electroluminescence properties of epitaxially grown n-ZnO/p-GaN
pn-heterojunctions are investigated as functions of applied bias and
temperature. The study reveals the existence of indirect interfacial excitons
at sufficiently low temperatures. Electroluminescence feature associated with
these excitons redshifts with increasing forward bias. It has been found that
the binding energy of these entities can be controlled through applied forward
bias and can even be made higher than that of the excitons in ZnO bulk (60
meV). However, formation of these excitons becomes unsustainable when either
the applied bias or the temperature crosses a threshold. This has been
explained in terms of leakage and thermal escape of electrons (holes) into GaN
(ZnO) side. Calculations for the band diagram and the binding energy of these
spatially indirect electron-hole coulomb-coupled entities are carried out.
Theoretical results are found to explain the experimental findings quite well.

<h3>Subgap states and quantum phase transitions in one-dimensional  superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator heterostructures</h3>

We theoretically study the spectral properties of a one dimensional
semiconductor-superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator (SE-SU-FMI) hybrid
nanostructure, motivated by recents experiments where such devices have been
fabricated using epitaxial growing techniques. We model the hybrid structure as
a one-dimensional single-channel semiconductor nanowire under the simultaneous
effect of two proximity-induced interactions: superconducting pairing and a
(spatially inhomogeneous) Zeeman exchange field. The coexistence of these
competing interactions generates a rich quantum phase diagram and a complex
subgap Andreev bound state (ABS) spectrum. By exploiting the symmetries of the
problem, we classify the solutions of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations into
even and odd ABS with respect to the spatial inversion symmetry $x\to -x$. We
find the ABS spectrum of the device as a function of the different parameters
of the model: the length $L$ of the coexisting SU-FMI region, the induced
Zeeman exchange field $h_0$, and the induced superconducting coherence length
$\xi$. In particular we analyze the evolution of the subgap spectrum as a
function of the length $L$. Interestingly, we have found that depending on the
ratio $h_0/\Delta$, the emerging ABS can eventually cross below the Fermi
energy at certain critical values $L_c$, and induce spin-and fermion
parity-changing quantum phase transitions. We argue that this type of device
constitute a promising highly-tunable platform to engineer subgap ABS.

In this letter we report on the electrical transport properties of
Bi$_4$Te$_3$ in a Josephson junction geometry using superconducting Al
electrodes with a Ti interdiffusion barrier. Bi$_4$Te$_3$ is proposed to be a
dual topological insulator, for which due to time-reversal and mirror symmetry
both a strong topological insulator phase as well as a crystalline topological
phase co-exist. The formation of a supercurrent through the Bi$_4$Te$_3$ layer
is explained by a two-step process. First, due to the close proximity of the
Al/Ti electrodes a superconducting gap is induced within the Bi$_4$Te$_3$ layer
right below the electrodes. The size of this gap is determined by analysing
multiple Andreev reflections (MARs) identified within the devices differential
resistance at low voltage biases. Second, based on the Andreev reflection and
reverse Andreev reflection processes a supercurrent establishes in the weak
link region in between these two proximity coupled regions. Analyses of the
temperature dependency of both the critical current as well as MARs indicate
mostly ballistic supercurrent contributions in between the proximitized
Bi$_4$Te$_3$ regions even though the material is characterized by a
semi-metallic bulk phase. The presence of these ballistic modes gives
indications on the topological nature of Bi$_4$Te$_3$.

Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique to characterize materials. It
probes non-destructively chemical composition, crystallinity, defects, strain
and coupling phenomena. However, the Raman response of surfaces or thin films
is often weak and obscured by dominant bulk signals. Here we overcome this
limitation by placing a transferable porous gold membrane (PAuM) on top of the
surface of interest. Slot-like nanopores in the membrane act as plasmonic slot
antennas and enhance the Raman response of the surface or thin film underneath.
Simultaneously, the PAuM suppresses the penetration of the excitation laser
into the bulk, efficiently blocking the bulk Raman signal. Using graphene as a
model surface, we show that these two simultaneous effects lead to an increase
in the surface-to-bulk Raman signal ratio by three orders of magnitude. We find
that 90% of the Raman enhancement occurs within the top 2.5 of the material,
demonstrating truly surface-sensitive Raman scattering. To validate our
approach, we analyze the surface of a LaNiO3 thin film. We observe a Raman mode
splitting for the LaNiO3 surface-layer, which is spectroscopic evidence that
the surface structure differs from the bulk. This result underpins that PAuM
give direct access to Raman signatures of surfaces and their structural
properties.

<h3>A simple theory for quantum quenches in the ANNNI model</h3>

In a recent numerical study [1] it was shown that signatures of proximate
quantum critical points can be observed at early and intermediate times after
certain quantum quenches. Said work focused mainly on the case of the axial
next-nearest neighbour Ising (ANNNI) model. Here we construct a simple
time-dependent mean-field theory that allows us to obtain a quantitatively
accurate description of these quenches at short times and a surprisingly good
approximation to the thermalization dynamics at late times. Our approach
provides a simple framework for understanding the reported numerical results as
well as fundamental limitations on detecting quantum critical points through
quench dynamics. We moreover explain the origin of the peculiar oscillatory
behaviour seen in various observables as arising from the formation of a
long-lived bound state.

<h3>Diffusion Properties of a Brownian Ratchet with Coulomb Friction</h3>

The motion of a Brownian particle in the presence of Coulomb friction and an
asymmetric spatial potential was evaluated in this study. The system exhibits a
ratchet effect, i.e., an average directed motion even in the absence of an
external force, induced by the coupling of non-equilibrium conditions with the
spatial asymmetry. Both the average motion and the fluctuations of the Brownian
particle were analysed. The stationary velocity shows a non-monotonic behaviour
as a function of both the temperature and the viscosity of the bath. The
diffusion properties of the particle, which show several time regimes, were
also investigated. To highlight the role of non-linear friction in the
dynamics, a comparison is presented with a linear model of a Brownian particle
driven by a constant external force, which allows for analytical treatment. In
particular, the study unveils that the passage times between different temporal
regimes are strongly affected by the presence of Coulomb friction.

<h3>One-particle density matrix and momentum distribution of the  out-of-equilibrium 1D Tonks-Girardeau gas: exact results at large $N$</h3>

In 1D quantum gases, the momentum distribution (MD) of the atoms is a
standard experimental observable, routinely measured in various experimental
setups. The MD is sensitive to correlations, and it is notoriously hard to
compute theoretically for large numbers of atoms $N$, which often prevents
direct comparison with experimental data. Here we report significant progress
on this problem for the 1D Tonks-Girardeau gas in the asymptotic limit of large
$N$, at zero temperature and driven out of equilibrium by a quench of the
confining potential. We find an exact formula for the time-dependent
one-particle density matrix $\langle \hat{\Psi}^\dagger(x) \hat{\Psi}(x')
\rangle$ of the out-of-equilibrium TG gas in the $N \rightarrow \infty$ limit,
valid on distances $|x-x'| $ much larger than the interparticle distance. By
comparing with numerical results for $N=33$ atoms, we demonstrate that the new
asymptotically exact formula can be used to compute the out-of-equilibrium MD
with great accuracy for a wide range of momenta (except in the tails of the
distribution at very large momenta). For a quench from a double-well potential
to a single harmonic well,which mimics a `quantum Newton cradle' setup, our
method predicts the periodic formation of peculiar, multiply peaked, momentum
distributions. Our results open up new perspectives for precision
out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body physics and confrontation between theory
and experiments in 1D quantum gases.

We study the commensuration torques and layer sliding energetics of
alternating twist trilayer graphene (t3G) and twisted bilayer graphene on
hexagonal boron nitride (t2G/BN) that have two superposed moire interfaces.
Lattice relaxations for typical graphene twist angles of $\sim 1^{\circ}$ in
t3G or t2G/BN are found to break the out-of-plane layer mirror symmetry, give
rise to layer rotation energy local minima dips of the order of $\sim 10^{-1}$
meV/atom at double moire alignment angles, and have sliding energy landscape
minima between top-bottom layers of comparable magnitude. Moire superlubricity
is restored for twist angles as small as $\sim 0.03^\circ$ away from alignment
resulting in suppression of sliding energies by several orders of magnitude of
typically $\sim 10^{-4}$ meV/atom, hence indicating the precedence of rotation
over sliding in the double moire commensuration process.
