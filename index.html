<h3>Improved data analysis for molecular dynamics in liquid CCl4</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00462" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00462</a>

<i>Shinya Hosokawa, Koji Yoshida</i>

Previously reported inelastic x-ray scattering spectra of a typical van der
Waals molecular liquid CCl4 were reanalyzed by using a generalized Langevin
formalism with a memory function including a thermal and two viscoelastic
relaxation processes together with a simple sparse modeling. The obtained
excitations of longitudinal acoustic phonons show a largely positive deviation
from the hydrodynamic value by about 57%, much larger than about 37% by the
previously reported damped harmonic oscillator result. Such large values of
fast sounds in molecular liquids being larger than about 15-20% of typical
liquid metals are interpreted as extra energy-losses for terahertz phonons by
vibrational and rotational motions of molecules. The rates of the fast and slow
viscoelastic relaxations in the memory function at low Q indicate large values,
about 0.5 and 2 ps, which correspond to the vibrational and rotational motions
of CCl4 molecules, respectively. These values are larger than those of the
typical polar molecular liquid acetone, which may reflect the heavier atomic
mass of CCl4. The Q dependences of the viscoelastic relaxation rates are
discussed in terms of lifetime and propagating length of the terahertz phonon
oscillations. The microscopic kinematic longitudinal viscosity rapidly
decreases with Q from a reasonable macroscopic value.

<h3>Fracton Self-Statistics</h3>

Fracton order describes novel quantum phases of matter that host
quasiparticles with restricted mobility, and thus lie beyond the existing
paradigm of topological order. In particular, excitations that cannot move
without creating other excitations are called fractons. Here we address a
fundamental open question -- can the notion of self-exchange statistics be
naturally defined for fractons, given their complete immobility as isolated
excitations? Surprisingly, we demonstrate how fractons can be exchanged, and
show their self-statistics is a key part of the characterization of fracton
orders. We derive general constraints satisfied by the fracton self-statistics
in a large class of abelian fracton orders. Finally, we show the existence of
nontrivial fracton self-statistics in some twisted variants of the checkerboard
model and Haah's code, establishing that these models are in distinct quantum
phases as compared to their untwisted cousins.

<h3>Current-Induced Spin Accumulation and Magnetoresistance in Chiral  Semimetals</h3>

Weyl fermions possess the property of spin-momentum locking: the expectation
value of the spin is parallel or antiparallel to the momentum at any given
point in the Brillouin zone in the vicinity of a Weyl node. This is a direct
consequence of the fact that Weyl nodes are monopoles of the Berry curvature,
and in this sense an expression of the nontrivial Weyl electronic structure
topology. Thanks to this property, an isolated Weyl node produces a large spin
accumulation in response to a charge current, $\hbar/2$ per electron, similar
to surface states of time-reversal invariant topological insulators. However,
in bulk Weyl semimetals, the nodes must occur in pairs of opposite chirality
and, when the nodes are at the same energy, the effect cancels out. Here we
show that this cancellation is avoided in chiral semimetals, in which Weyl
nodes of opposite chirality occur at different energies due to broken mirror
symmetry. We find that the spin accumulation is maximized when the Fermi energy
coincides with one of the nodes in a pair and reaches the same value as for an
isolated node in this case. Moreover, we demonstrate the existence of a
distinct magnetoresistance mechanism, closely related to this current-induced
spin accumulation.

<h3>Emus live on the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa archipelago</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00034" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00034</a>

It is expected that the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) chiral Ising transition of
$N$ Majorana (or $N_f=N/4$ four-component Dirac) fermions coupled with scalar
field in (2+1)D will be the first fermionic quantum critical point that various
methods such as conformal bootstrap [1], perturbative renormalization group [2]
and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations [3], would yield the converged
critical exponents -- serving the same textbook role as the Ising and $O(N)$
models in the statistical and quantum phase transition. However, such
expectation has not been fully realized from the lattice QMC simulations due to
the obstacles introduced by the UV finite size effect. In this work, by means
of the elective-momentum ultra-size (EMUS) QMC method [4], we compute the
critical exponents of the GNY $N=8$ chiral Ising transition on a 2D $\pi$-flux
fermion lattice model between Dirac semimetal and quantum spin Hall insulator
phases [3, 5]. With the matching of fermionic and bosonic momentum transfer and
collective update in momentum space, our QMC results provide the fully
consistent exponents with those obtained from the bootstrap and perturbative
approaches. In this way, the Emus now live happily on the $N=8$ island and
could explore the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa archipelago [1] with ease.

<h3>Natural optical activity from density-functional perturbation theory</h3>

<i>Asier Zabalo, Massimiliano Stengel</i>
<br>
<br>
We present an accurate and computationally efficient first-principles
methodology to calculate the natural optical activity. Our approach is based on
the long-wave density-functional perturbation theory and includes
self-consistent field (SCF) terms naturally in the formalism, which are found
to be of crucial importance. The final result is expressed exclusively in terms
of response functions to uniform field perturbations and avoids troublesome
summations over empty states. Our strategy is validated by computing the
natural optical activity tensor in representative chiral crystals (trigonal Se,
$\alpha$-HgS and $\alpha$-SiO$_2$) and molecules (C$_4$H$_4$O$_2$), finding
excellent agreement with experiment and previous theoretical calculations.

<h3>Effects of Thermal Modification on the Flexure Properties, Fracture  Energy, and Hardness of Western Hemlock</h3>

<br>
<br>
This study investigates the effect of thermal modification on the flexural
properties, transverse fracture energy, and hardness of western hemlock, a
material which is finding increasing applications in construction. Flexure
tests on specimens featuring longitudinal and transverse grains showed that
thermal modification at 167C slightly improves the flexural modulus and
strength and leads to less statistical variability compared to unmodified
samples. On the other hand, the fracture and Janka hardness tests revealed a
more pronounced brittleness of the thermally modified samples. In fact, the
total mode I fracture energy of modified Single Edge Notch Bending (SENB)
samples was about 47% lower for radial-longitudinal systems and 60% lower for
tangential-longitudinal systems. Similarly, the average Janka hardness in the
tangential, radial, and transverse planes was 8.5%, 3.9%, and 9.4% lower in the
modified specimens, respectively. The results presented in this work show that
thermal modification can have a significant effect on the fracturing behavior
of western hemlock and its energy dissipation capabilities. For design, this
must be taken into serious consideration as these properties significantly
influence the damage tolerance of this wood in the presence of stress
concentrations such as e.g., those induced in bolted joints and cut outs.
Fracture energy and hardness are also strongly correlated to ballistic
performance.

<h3>Chemical Principles of Intrinsic Topological Superconductors</h3>

The concept of topological superconductivity has attracted immense interest
in the physics community recently for several reasons: First, topological
superconductors represent new phases of matter, topologically distinct from any
other known phase of matter. Second, their discovery would present the first
realization of Majorana zero modes. Third, intrinsic topological
superconductors promise to become an important ingredient for next-generation
quantum technologies. There are a handful of candidates to date considered as
potential intrinsic topological superconductors. All of these display signs of
unconventional, potentially topological superconductivity. However, the results
from different experimental methods are inconclusive. One of the major
challenges in the field of topological superconductivity has been the scarcity
of potential materials, in contrast to the many exciting, theoretical
predictions of properties that could be unraveled by such a discovery.
Currently, it should be far to say that a material that convincingly displays
intrinsic topological superconductivity, and Majorana zero modes, has so far
not been discovered. This perspective aims at summarizing the results of the
most actively discussed potential topological superconductors for chemists.
But, I will also compile the essential physical and chemical design principles
of these materials from a chemists' perspective in order to motivate synthetic
chemists to join the quest for the discovery of the first intrinsic topological
superconductor.

<h3>Normal forms, universal scaling functions, and extending the validity of  the RG</h3>

Our community has a deep and sophisticated understanding of phase transitions
and their universal scaling functions. We outline and advocate an ambitious
program to use this understanding as an anchor for describing the surrounding
phases. We explain how to use normal form theory to write universal scaling
functions in systems where the renormalization-group flows cannot be
linearized. We use the 2d Ising model to demonstrate how to calculate
high-precision implementations of universal scaling functions, and how to
extend them into a complete description of the surrounding phases. We discuss
prospects and challenges involved into extending these early successes to the
many other systems where the RG has successfully described emergent scale
invariance, making them invaluable tools for engineers, biologists, and social
scientists studying complex systems.

<h3>Investigation of Cu-site disorder in undoped and doped BiCuSeO</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We carried out X-ray diffraction and Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure
(EXAFS) studies to investigate the origin of the low lattice thermal
conductivity in BiCuSeO, and the role of silver (Ag) doping in doped samples.
BiCuSeO is a promising thermoelectric material with high thermoelectric
efficiency, which is significantly enhanced by doping either single Ag dopants
or dual dopants (Pb and Ag). We verified that the thermal displacement
parameters associated with copper (Cu) are significantly large in undoped
BiCuSeO. Ag dopant, which replaces Cu, was also found to have similarly large
thermal displacement parameters, that remain large down to low temperatures.
Our results point towards significant disorder on Cu-site in both undoped and
doped BiCuSeO, which is retained by Ag dopant on replacing Cu. The disorder is
observed to be localized on the Cu-site and seems to be independent of other
atoms in the crystal structure. Our observation of the disorder, which could be
either static or quasi-static, is consistent with a rattling mode scenario.

<h3>Significant Phonon Drag Effect in Wide Bandgap GaN and AlN</h3>

A thorough understanding of electrical and thermal transport properties of
group-III nitride semiconductors is essential for their electronic and
thermoelectric applications. Despite extensive previous studies, these
transport properties were typically calculated without considering the
nonequilibrium coupling effect between electrons and phonons, which can be
particularly strong in group-III nitride semiconductors due to the high
electric fields and high heat currents in devices based on them. In this work,
we systematically examine the phonon drag effect, namely the momentum exchange
between nonequilibrium phonons and electrons, and its impact on charge mobility
and Seebeck coefficient in GaN and AlN by solving the fully coupled electron
and phonon Boltzmann transport equations with ab initio scattering parameters.
We find that, even at room temperature, the phonon drag effect can
significantly enhance mobility and Seebeck coefficient in GaN and AlN,
especially at higher carrier concentrations. Furthermore, we show that the
phonon drag contribution to mobility and Seebeck coefficient scale differently
with the carrier concentration and we highlight a surprisingly important
contribution to the mobility enhancement from the polar optical phonons. We
attribute both findings to the distinct mechanisms the phonon drag affects
mobility and Seebeck coefficient. Our study advances the understanding of the
strong phonon drag effect on carrier transport in wide bandgap GaN and AlN and
gives new insights into the nature of coupled electron-phonon transport in
polar semiconductors.

Nonequilibrium states of quantum materials can exhibit exotic properties and
enable novel functionality and applications. These transient states are thought
to be highly inhomogeneous, involving metastable, self-organized, topologically
protected structures, which are inaccessible by most time-resolved
measurements. Using ultrafast total x-ray scattering at a free electron laser
and a sophisticated scaling analysis, we gain unique access to the dynamics on
the relevant mesoscopic length scales. Our results show that ultrafast
excitation of LaTe$_3$ leads to formation of vortex strings of the charge
density wave, which exhibit anomalous, subdiffusive dynamics. These findings
provide rare insight into the nonequilibrium mesoscopic response in a quantum
material and establish a general framework to investigate properties of
topological defects, which can arrest equilibration and enhance competing
orders.

<h3>Geometric phases of Topological Systems under Quench Process</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00187" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00187</a>
<br>
<i>Zhan Gao, Yan He</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the time evolution of geometric phases of one dimensional
topological models under the quench dynamics. Taking the Creutz ladder model as
an example, it is found that the Berry phase is fixed as the parameter is
suddenly tuned across the topological phase boundary, given that the chiral
symmetry of the model is preserved. At finite temperature, the Uhlmann phase
displays abrupt jumps between the two quantized values, which indicates the
topological transition at certain times after the quench. Both the Berry and
Uhlmann phase will deviate from quantized values if the chiral symmetry of the
model is broken. The relation between the Uhlmann phase and Loshmidt rate
function under the quench process is also discussed.

<h3>Enormous variation in homogeneity of room temperature superconductor  samples: a Comment on Nature 615, 244 (2023)</h3>

The resistive transition width of a recently discovered room temperature
near-ambient-pressure superconductor [1] changes by more than three orders of
magnitude between different samples, with the transition temperature nearly
unchanged. For the narrowest transitions, the transition width relative to T_c
is only 0.014%. This anomalous behavior and other issues indicate that this
system is not a superconductor.

<h3>Effect of the resonant ac-drive on the spin-dependent recombination of  polaron pairs: Relation to organic magnetoresistance</h3>

The origin of magnetoresistance is bipolar organic materials is the influence
of magnetic field on the dynamics of recombination within localized
electron-hole pairs. Recombination from the $S$ spin-state of the pair in
preceded by the beatings between the states $S$ and $T_0$. Period of the
beating is set by the the random hyperfine field. For the case when
recombination time from $S$ is shorter than the period, we demonstrate that a
{\em weak} resonant ac drive, which couples $T_0$ to $T_+$ and $T_{-}$ affects
dramatically the recombination dynamics and, thus, the current A distinctive
characteristics of the effect is that the current versus the drive amplitude
exhibits a {\em maximum}.

Understanding and controlling fracture propagation is one of the most
challenging engineering problems, especially in the oil and gas sector,
groundwater hydrology and geothermal energy applications. Predicting the
fracture orientation while also possessing a non-linear material response
becomes more complex when the medium is non-homogeneous and anisotropic.
Fracturing behaviour in geological porous media that exhibit high leak-off
potential is not clearly understood. In this context, a novel testing technique
is used to simulate the ground conditions in the laboratory and study the
instability characteristics of such geo-materials. The bespoke apparatus
designed and developed in this research programme is capable of applying true
anisotropic boundary stresses, injecting fluid at a predefined flow rate and
viscosity while also imaging the instability/ fracture propagation in a porous
medium such as sand and weak rock. Pressure profiles and the progression of
fracture are recorded simultaneously during the fluid injection process into
specimens subjected to different boundary stresses. The fracture propagation
data are analysed, which provides information on the evolution of fracture
morphology and expansion velocity during the injection event.

<h3>Synthesis and EOS study of orthorhombic (Fe,Ni)$_{7}$(C,Si)$_{3}$ and  its importance as a possible constituent of Earth's core</h3>

<br>
<br>
We have synthesized an orthorhombic phase of nickel and silicon doped
Fe$_{7}$C$_{3}$ at high-pressure and high temperature using a laser-heated
diamond anvil cell. The synthesized material is characterized using X-ray
diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM) measurements. High-pressure XRD measurement at room temperature up to
around 121 GPa is performed. The anomaly observed in the pressure evolution of
unit cell volume around 79 GPa along with a slight elastic softening might be
associated with a magnetic transition present in the material. The estimated
bulk modulus shows a higher value due to the presence of less compressible
nickel in the material. Density at core condition is calculated from the
thermal pressure corrected equation of state (EOS), which gives an excellent
match with the PREM data.

<h3>A coupled magneto-structural continuum model for multiferroic  $\mathrm{BiFeO}_3$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00270" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00270</a>

<br>
<br>
A continuum approach to study magnetoelectric multiferroic $\mathrm{BiFeO}_3$
(BFO) is proposed. Our modeling effort marries the ferroelectric (FE) phase
field method and micromagnetic simulations in order to describe the entire
multiferroic order parameter sector (polarization, oxygen antiphase tilts,
strain, and magnetism) self-consistently on the same time and length scale. In
this paper, we discuss our choice of ferroelectric and magnetic energy terms
and demonstrate benchmarks against known behavior. We parameterize the lowest
order couplings of the structural distortions against previous predictions from
density functional theory calculations giving access to simulations of the FE
domain wall (DW) topology. This allows us to estimate the energetic hierarchy
and thicknesses of the numerous structural DWs. We then extend the model to the
canted antiferromagnetic order and demonstrate how the ferroelectric domain
boundaries influence the resulting magnetic DWs. We also highlight some
capabilities of this model by providing two examples relevant for applications.
We demonstrate spin wave transmission through the multiferroic domain
boundaries which identify rectification in qualitative agreement with recent
experimental observations. As a second example of application, we model
fully-dynamical magnetoelectric switching, where we find a sensitivity on the
Gilbert damping with respect to switching pathways. We envision that this
modeling effort will set the basis for further work on properties of arbitrary
3D nanostructures of BFO (and related multiferroics) at the mesoscale.

<h3>Itinerant ferromagnetism entrenched by the anisotropy of spin-orbit  coupling in a dipolar Fermi gas</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the the itinerant ferromagnetism in a dipolar Fermi atomic
system with the anisotropic spin-orbit coupling (SOC),which is traditionally
explored with isotropic contact interaction.We first study the ferromagnetism
transition boundaries and the properties of the ground states through the
density and spin-flip distribution in momentum space, and we find that both the
anisotropy and the magnitude of the SOC play an important role in this process.
We propose a helpful scheme and a quantum control method which can be applied
to conquering the difficulties of previous experimental observation of
itinerant ferromagnetism. Our further study reveals that exotic Fermi surfaces
and an abnormal phase region can exist in this system by controlling the
anisotropy of SOC, which can provide constructive suggestions for the research
and the application of a dipolar Fermi gas. Furthermore, we also calculate the
ferromagnetism transition temperature and novel distributions in momentum space
at finite temperature beyond the ground states from the perspective of
experiment.

Future fusion nuclear reactors will produce sustainable energy form the
fusion of deuterium and tritium. In order to do so, the reactors will need to
produce their own tritium through the neutron bombardment of lithium. Such
reaction will produce tritium and helium inside the breeding blanket of the
reactor. Helium can trigger nucleation mechanisms due to its very low
solubility inside liquid metals. Consequently, the knowledge and understanding
of the microscopic processes of helium nucleation is crucial to improve the
efficiency, sustainability and safety of the fusion energy production. The
formation of helium bubbles inside the liquid metal used as breeding material
may be a serious issue that has yet to be fully understood. We provide further
insight on the behavior of lithium and helium mixtures at experimentally
corresponding operating conditions (800~K and pressures between 1 and 100 bar)
using a suitable microscopic model able to describe the helium and lithium
atomic interactions, in excellent agreement with available experimental data.
The simulations predict the formation of helium bubbles with radii around 10
Angstroem at ambient pressure and with surface tension values between 0.6-1.0
N/m, with a dependency of the concentration of helium. We also report cohesive
energies of helium as well as a quantitative estimation of the Hildebrand and
Kumar cohesion parameters.

<h3>Modelling how curved active proteins and shear flow pattern cellular  shape and motility</h3>

Cell spreading and motility on an adhesive substrate are driven by the active
physical forces generated by the actin cytoskeleton. We have recently shown
that coupling curved membrane complexes to protrusive forces, exerted by the
actin polymerization that they recruit, provides a mechanism that can give rise
to spontaneous membrane shapes and patterns. In the presence of an adhesive
substrate, this model was shown to give rise to an emergent motile phenotype,
resembling a motile cell. Here, we utilize this ``minimal-cell" model to
explore the impact of external shear flow on the cell shape and migration on a
uniform adhesive flat substrate. We find that in the presence of shear the
motile cell reorients such that its leading edge, where the curved active
proteins aggregate, faces the shear flow. The flow-facing configuration is
found to minimize the adhesion energy by allowing the cell to spread more
efficiently over the substrate. For the non-motile vesicle shapes, we find that
they mostly slide and roll with the shear flow. We compare these theoretical
results with experimental observations, and suggest that the tendency of many
cell types to move against the flow may arise from the very general, and
non-cell-type-specific mechanism predicted by our model.

<h3>Interference induced anisotropy in a two-dimensional dark state optical  lattice</h3>

We describe a two-dimensional optical lattice for ultracold atoms with
spatial features below the diffraction limit created by a bichromatic optical
standing wave. At every point in space these fields couple the internal atomic
states in a three-level Lambda coupling configuration. Adiabatically following
the local wavefunction of the resulting dark state yields a spatially uniform
Born-Oppenheimer potential augmented by geometric scalar and vector potentials
appearing due to spatially rapid changes of the wavefunction. Depending on
system parameters, we find that the geometric scalar potential can interpolate
from a 2D analogue of the Kronig-Penney lattice, to an array of tubes with a
zig-zag shaped barrier. The geometric vector potential induces a spatially
periodic effective magnetic field (the Berry's curvature) that can be tuned to
cause destructive interference between neighboring tubes, thereby decoupling
them at a critical point in parameter space. We numerically investigate the
energy spectrum including decay from the excited state, and find that the
adiabatic approximation is sound for strong coupling strengths, leading to
negligible loss in the dark state manifold. Furthermore, the spectrum is
well-described by a non-Hermitian tight binding model with on-site losses, and
hopping characterized by both loss and, surprisingly, gain.

This chapter on the rheology of active fluids is an attempt to correlate
theoretical and experimental work. A considerable amount of theoretical work
and most of the experimental data focus on the rheology of active fluids in a
Newtonian matrix, which displays uncommon macroscopic rheological behaviors,
such as the apparent superfluid-like state of the pusher suspensions. The
failure of the "scallop theorem" for reciprocal swimmers in a non-Newtonian
matrix is highlighted. Finally, recent findings concerning the turbulent-like
behaviour in concentrated systems are described in detail.

Bright excitons in ferromagnetic monolayers CrI$_3$ efficiently interact with
lattice magnetization, which makes possible all-optical resonant magnetization
control in this material. Using the combination of ab-initio simulations within
Bethe-Salpeter approach, semiconductor Bloch equations and Landau-Lifshitz
equations, we construct a microscopic theory of this effect. Solving
numerically the resulting system of the coupled equations describing the
dynamics of atomic spins and spins of the excitons, we demonstrate the
possibility of a tunable control of macroscopic magnetization of a sample.

Physically relevant field-theoretic quantities are usually derived from
perturbation techniques. These quantities are solved in the form of an
asymptotic series in powers of small perturbation parameters related to the
physical system, and calculating higher powers typically results in a higher
amount of computational complexity. Such divergent expansions were handled
using hyper-geometric functions, continued functions, and Borel-Leroy
transforms. Hypergeometric functions are expanded as series, and a rough
estimate of next-order information is predicted using information from known
orders. Continued functions are used for the resummation of these series. The
effective nature of extrapolation using such functions is illustrated by taking
different examples in field theories. In the vicinity of second-order phase
transitions, critical exponents are the most interesting numerical quantities
corresponding to a wide range of physical systems. Using the techniques
mentioned in this work, precise estimates are obtained for these critical
exponents in {\phi}^4 and {\phi}^3 field models.

Full-shell nanowires (a semiconducting core fully wrapped by an epitaxial
superconducting shell) have recently been introduced as promising hybrid
quantum devices. Despite this, however, their properties when forming a
Josephson junction (JJ) have not been elucidated yet. We here fill this void by
theoretically studying the physics of JJs based on full-shell nanowires. In the
hollow-core limit, where the thickness of the semiconducting layer can be
ignored, we demonstrate that the critical supercurrent $I^{c}$ can be tuned by
an external magnetic flux $\Phi$. Specifically, $I^{c}(\Phi)$ does not follow
the Little-Parks modulation of the superconducting pairing ${\Delta}(\Phi)$,
and exhibits steps for realistic values of nanowire radii. The position of the
steps can be understood from the underlying symmetries of the orbital
transverse channels which contribute to the supercurrent for a given chemical
potential.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials provide a platform for developing novel
spintronic devices and circuits for low-power electronics. In particular,
inducing magnetism and injecting spins in graphene have promised the emerging
field of graphene spintronics. This review focuses on the magnetic proximity
effect at the interface of 2D materials and magnetic oxide insulators. We
highlight the unique spin-related phenomena arising from magnetic exchange
interaction and spin-orbital coupling in 2D materials coupled with magnetic
oxides. We also describe the fabrication of multifunctional hybrid devices
based on spin transport. We conclude with a perspective of the field and
highlight challenges for the design and fabrication of 2D spintronic devices
and their potential applications in information storage and logic devices.

Soft ferromagnetic NiFe thin films are promising for applications in
spintronic devices because of their constituent electrical and magnetic
properties. Electron beam evaporation and sputtering techniques have been used
to deposit NiFe thin films. For in-situ stacking of NiFe with functional
complex oxides, the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method is highly desirable.
However, the growth of high-quality NiFe (and non-oxide thin films in general)
by PLD remains a formidable task. Here, we report high-quality NiFe thin films
of various thicknesses on oxide/non-oxide substrates with desirable magnetic
properties by PLD at room temperature. The magnetic properties are found to be
strongly dependent on the laser fluence of the deposition process. The laser
fluence of 4 Joule/cm$^2$ produces the highest magnetization of ~547 emu/cc.
The small coercivity (few Oersted) and sharp ferromagnetic switching behaviour
indicate uniaxial anisotropy with an easy axis along the in-plane direction. In
addition, thickness-dependent magnetodynamics characterizations are studied via
ferromagnetic resonance. Our findings indicate the ferromagnetic
characteristics are sensitive to the quality of the oxide/non-oxide substrate
surface. These results offer significant insight into the PLD-based development
of thin metal magnetic films.

<h3>Effects of Poly(styrene/pentafluorostyrene-block-vinylpyrrolidone)  Amphiphilic Kinetic Hydrate Inhibitors on the Dynamic Viscosity of Methane  Hydrate Systems at High-Pressure Driving Forces</h3>

<br>
<br>
Reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization with a
switchable chain-transfer agent was employed to synthesize amphiphilic block
copolymers poly(styrene-b-vinylpyrrolidone) and
poly(pentafluorostyrene-b-vinylpyrrolidone) at 10 wt.% hydrophobic content as
kinetic hydrate inhibitors for methane hydrates. The dynamic viscosity of
methane hydrate slurries was measured in a high-pressure rheometer up to 15
MPag. At 700 ppm of additives in aqueous media, the relative time for slurries
to grow to 200 mPa s was 2.2-2.4 times longer than water reference values for
the block copolymers. In contrast, it was only 1.3 for the
poly(vinylpyrrolidone) homopolymer, demonstrating a reduced tendency for
hydrate particle adhesion in block copolymer solutions. By increasing the
concentration to 7000 ppm, however, the relative time only increased to
2.6-2.7. On the other hand, a block copolymer with 5 wt.%
poly(pentafluorostyrene) block at 7000 ppm reached 3.5, which may indicate that
the optimal hydrophobic content differs for each amphiphilic polymer and
depends on monomer selection. No significant effect of polymer aggregation on
hydrate growth was observed for the copolymers used in this study, which had
the same hydrophobic percentage and molecular weights between 10,000 and 40,000
g/mol.

<h3>Peak Effect, Melting, and Transport in Skyrmion Crystals</h3>

<br>
<br>
We numerically examine the transport of skyrmions driven over weak random
quenched disorder using a modified Thiele approach that includes the thermal
softening of skyrmion pairwise interactions introduced by Wang et al., Phys.
Rev. Appl. 18, 044024 (2022). The depinning transition is elastic at low
temperatures but becomes plastic with a reduced threshold at higher
temperatures due to the competition between thermal creep and thermal
softening, indicating a temperature-induced order to disorder transition into a
glass state. The resulting non-monotonic critical depinning forces and crossing
of the velocity-force curves are similar to what is observed in the peak effect
for type-II superconducting vortex lattices, where the softening of
vortex-vortex interactions with temperature leads to an order-disorder
transition. For low skyrmion densities the peak effect is absent since the
system is always in a disordered state. We map the dynamical phase transition
as a function of temperature, density, drive, and materials parameters, and
show that the signatures are similar to those of the superconducting peak
effect. Our results are consistent with recent experiments.

<br>
<br>
We explore the application of excitation correlation spectroscopy to detect
nonlinear photophysical dynamics in two distinct semiconductor classes through
time-integrated photoluminescence and photocurrent measurements. In this
experiment, two variably delayed femtosecond pulses excite the semiconductor,
and the time-integrated photoluminescence or photocurrent component arising
from the nonlinear dynamics of the populations induced by each pulse is
measured as a function of inter-pulse delay by phase-sensitive detection with a
lock-in amplifier. We focus on two limiting materials systems with contrasting
optical properties: a prototypical lead-halide perovskite (LHP) solar cell, in
which primary photoexcitations are charge photocarriers, and a single-component
organic-semiconductor diode, which features Frenkel excitons as primary
photoexcitations. The photoexcitation dynamics perceived by the two detection
schemes in these contrasting systems are distinct. Nonlinear-dynamic
contributions in the photoluminescence detection scheme arise from
contributions to radiative recombination in both materials systems, while
photocurrent arises directly in the LHP but indirectly following exciton
dissociation in the organic system. Consequently, the basic photophysics of the
two systems are reflected differently when comparing measurements with the two
detection schemes.

<h3>Effective exponents for the diffusive coarsening of wet foams and  analogous materials</h3>

<br>
<br>
Empirical exponents for the growth of average domain size commonly lie
between the known limits of 1/2 and 1/3. Here, a framework is developed in the
context of foams to quantitatively explain such intermediate exponents, based
on a model of gas diffusion and microstructure in which bubbles are
approximately spherical and meet at approximately-circular films. This predicts
growth that is only logarithmically different from a 1/3 power law for
nearly-kissing spheres at jamming. It also predicts the variation of effective
exponents with liquid content. These predictions compare well with experimental
data for two foaming systems with different degrees of bubble-bubble cohesion.

<br>
<br>
The interplay between charge order (CO) and nontrivial band topology has
spurred tremendous interest in understanding topological excitations beyond the
single-particle description. In a quasi-one-dimensional nonsymmorphic crystal
TaTe$_4$, the (2a$\times$2b$\times$3c) charge ordered ground state drives the
system into a space group where the symmetry indicator features the emergence
of unconventional double Dirac fermions. Using angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we decipher the electronic
structure of TaTe4 in its CO state. We observe evidence of band folding at the
Fermi level that is compatible with the new periodicity dictated by the CO,
indicating that the electrons near the Fermi level follow the crystalline
symmetries needed to host 8-fold fermions in this system.

Molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) nanoribbons have attracted increased interest
due to their properties which can be tailored by tuning their dimensions.
Herein, we demonstrate the growth of highly crystalline quasi-one-dimensional
(1D)MoS$_2$ nanoribbons and aligned 3D triangular crystals with predominantly
3R or 2H stacking orientation. The synthesis method relies on the reaction
between an ultra-thin MoO3-x film grown by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) and
NaF in a sulfur-rich environment. The quasi-1D MoS$_2$ nanoribbons can reach
several micrometres in length, and feature single-layer (1L) edges aligned with
the nanoribbon core, thereby forming a 1L-multilayer (ML) homojunction due to
abrupt discontinuity in thickness. The 1L edges of the nanostructures show a
pronounced second harmonic generation (SHG) due to the symmetry breaking, in
contrast to the centrosymmetric ML structure, which is unsusceptible to the
second-order nonlinear process. A pronounced splitting of the Raman spectra was
observed in quasi-1D MoS$_2$ nanoribbons arising from distinct contributions
from the 2D edges and a multilayer core. Nanoscale imaging reveals the
blue-shifted exciton emission of the monolayer nanoribbon compared to the
triangular MoS$_2$ counterpart due to built-in local strain and disorder. We
further report on a versatile and ultrasensitive photodetector made of a single
quasi-1D MoS$_2$ nanoribbon with a maximum responsivity of 872 A/W at the
wavelength of 532 nm. The optoelectronic performance of the MoS$_2$ nanoribbon
is superior to the previously reported single-nanoribbon photodetectors. Our
findings can inspire the design of TMD semiconductors with tunable geometries
for efficient optoelectronic devices.

Quantum spin-hall insulator (QSHI) processes nontrivial topology. We notice
that the electronic structures of some particular QSHIs are favorable for
realization of excitonic insulators (EIs). Using first-principles many-body
perturbation theory ($GW$+BSE) and $k \cdot p$ model, we show that
high-temperature ($T$) topological EIs with unlike spin can exist in such QSHIs
with non-vanishing band gaps, e.g. 2D AsO and
$\text{Mo}_2\text{Ti}\text{C}_2\text{O}_2$. Spin-triplet type EI phase induced
by strong electron-hole interaction preserves time-reversal symmetry and the
topological characteristics. A novel optical selection rule exists, upon going
through the phase transition from the normal QSHIs to the topological EIs,
absorption spectroscopy shows pronounced $T$-dependent changes, providing
guidance for future experimental detections. The demonstrated coupling between
EIs and topology also means that rich physics exists in such materials which
retain such interdisciplinary features.

The Josephson diode (JD) is a non-reciprocal circuit element that supports a
larger critical current in one direction compared to the other. This effect has
gained a growing interest because of promising applications in superconducting
electronic circuits with low power consumption. Some implementations of a JD
rely on breaking the inversion symmetry in the material used to realize
Josephson junctions (JJs), but a recent theoretical proposal has suggested that
the effect can also be engineered by combining two JJs hosting highly
transmitting Andreev bound states in a Superconducting Quantum Interference
Device (SQUID) at a small, but finite flux bias [1]. We realized a SQUID with
two JJs fabricated in a proximitized InAs two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG).
We demonstrate gate control of the diode efficiency from zero up to around
$30$\% for different flux biases which comes close to the maximum of $\sim
40$\% predicated in Ref. [1]. The key ingredient to the JD effect in the SQUID
arrangement is the presence of an asymmetry between the two SQUID arms.

The Kitaev model offers a platform for quantum spin liquids (QSLs) with
fractional excitations, itinerant Majorana fermions and localized fluxes. Since
these fractional excitations could be utilized for quantum computing, how to
create, observe, and control them through the spin degree of freedom is a
central issue. Here, we study dynamical spin transport in the Kitaev-Heisenberg
model by applying an AC magnetic field to an edge of the system. We find that,
in the Kitaev QSL phase, spin polarizations at the other edge are resonantly
induced in a specific spin component, even though the static spin correlations
are vanishingly small. This inter-edge spin resonance appears around the input
frequency over the broad frequency range. Comparing with the dynamical spin
correlations, we clarify that the resonance is governed by the itinerant
Majorana fermions with a broad continuum excitation spectrum, which can
propagate over long distances, although it vanishes for the pure Kitaev model
because of accidental degeneracy and requires weak Heisenberg interactions. We
also find that the spin polarizations in the other spin components are weakly
induced at an almost constant frequency close to the excitation gap of the
localized fluxes, irrespective of the input frequency. These results
demonstrate that the dynamical spin transport is a powerful probe of the
fractional excitations in the Kitaev QSL. Possible experimental realization of
the inter-edge spin resonance is discussed.

The possible existence of a quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase, an exotic state
of matter with long-range quantum entanglement and fractionalized excitations,
in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has sparked widespread interests in exploring QSLs in
various Kitaev models under magnetic fields. Recently, a
$K$-$J$-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ model has been proposed to accurately describe the
compound by fitting the measured thermodynamic data, where $J$ is Heisenberg
interaction, and $\Gamma$, $\Gamma'$ are off-diagonal exchanges on top of the
dominant Kitaev coupling $K$. Based on this effective model, an intermediate
QSL phase in presence of an out-of-plane fields along the $[1 1 1]$ direction,
between the low-field zigzag order and high-field polarized phase, has been
predicted. By combining density matrix renormalization group (DMRG),
exponential tensor renormalization group (XTRG), and variational Monte Carlo
(VMC) calculations, we address the nature of this QSL phase in the honeycomb
$K$-$J$-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ model under the $[1 1 1]$-direction field. Our DMRG
calculations find the algebraic-like decay of spin correlation function, the
finite spin scalar chiral order, and lattice nematic order. Together with the
XTRG results of power-law specific heat at low temperature, our findings
naturally suggest a gapless nematic chiral spin liquid. On the other hand, our
VMC study finds a gapped nematic chiral spin liquid with the variational energy
very close to that obtained in DMRG. As VMC finds a very small gap that is
beyond the current resolution of both ground-state DMRG and finite-temperature
XTRG calculations on finite-width cylinders, we resort the full clarification
for the nature of the intermediate QSL to future studies. Lastly, we discuss
the implications of our results to the recent experiment on $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$
and the QSL-like phase in a similar $K$-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ model.

<br>
<br>
The stoichiometric bulk LuH2 is a paramagnetic metal with high electrical
conductivity comparable to simple metals. Here we show that the resistivity of
cold-pressed (CP) LuH2 samples varies sensitively upon modifying the grain size
or surface conditions via the grinding process, i.e., the CP pellets made of
commercially purchased LuH2 powder remain metallic but exhibit thousands of
times higher resistivity, while additional grinding of LuH2 powders in air
further enhances the resistivity and even results in weakly localized
behaviors. For these CP samples, interestingly, we can occasionally observe
abrupt resistivity drops at high temperatures, which also show dependences on
magnetic fields and electrical current. Measurements of variable-temperature
XRD, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat exclude the possibilities of
structural, magnetic, and superconducting transitions for the observed
resistivity drops. Instead, we tentatively attribute these above observations
to the presence of insulating layers on the grain surface due to the
modification of hydrogen stoichiometry or the pollution by oxygen/nitrogen.
Percolation of the metallic grains through the insulating surfaces can explain
the sudden drop in resistivity. The present results thus call for caution in
asserting the resistivity drops as superconductivity and invalidate the
background subtraction in analyzing the resistivity data.

One challenge of physics is to explain how collective properties arise from
microscopic interactions. Indeed, interactions form the building blocks of
almost all physical theories and are described by polynomial terms in the
action. The traditional approach is to derive these terms from elementary
processes and then use the resulting model to make predictions for the entire
system. But what if the underlying processes are unknown? Can we reverse the
approach and learn the microscopic action by observing the entire system? We
use invertible neural networks (INNs) to first learn the observed data
distribution. By the choice of a suitable nonlinearity for the neuronal
activation function, we are then able to compute the action from the weights of
the trained model; a diagrammatic language expresses the change of the action
from layer to layer. This process uncovers how the network hierarchically
constructs interactions via nonlinear transformations of pairwise relations. We
test this approach on simulated data sets of interacting theories. The network
consistently reproduces a broad class of unimodal distributions; outside this
class, it finds effective theories that approximate the data statistics up to
the third cumulant. We explicitly show how network depth and data quantity
jointly improve the agreement between the learned and the true model. This work
shows how to leverage the power of machine learning to transparently extract
microscopic models from data.

In conformal field theories, when the conformal symmetry is enhanced by a
global Lie group symmetry, the original Virasoro algebra can be extended to the
Kac-Moody algebra. In this paper, we extend the lattice construction of the
Kac-Moody generators introduced in [Wang et al., Phys. Rev. B. 106, 115111
(2022)] to continuous systems and apply it to one-dimensional continuous boson
systems. We justify this microscopic construction of Kac-Moody generators in
two ways. First, through phenomenological bosonization, we express the
microscopic construction in terms of the boson operators in the bosonization
context, which can be related to the Kac-Moody generators in the conformal
field theories. Second, we study the behavior of the Kac-Moody generators in
the integrable Lieb-Liniger model, and reveal its underlying particle-hole
excitation picture through the Bethe ansatz solutions. Finally, we test the
computation of the Kac-Moody generator in the cMPS simulations, paving the way
for more challenging non-integrable systems.

Modeling the full-range deformation behaviors of materials under complex
loading and materials conditions is a significant challenge for constitutive
relations (CRs) modeling. We propose a general encoder-decoder deep learning
framework that can model high-dimensional stress-strain data and complex
loading histories with robustness and universal capability. The framework
employs an encoder to project high-dimensional input information (e.g., loading
history, loading conditions, and materials information) to a lower-dimensional
hidden space and a decoder to map the hidden representation to the stress of
interest. We evaluated various encoder architectures, including gated recurrent
unit (GRU), GRU with attention, temporal convolutional network (TCN), and the
Transformer encoder, on two complex stress-strain datasets that were designed
to include a wide range of complex loading histories and loading conditions.
All architectures achieved excellent test results with an RMSE below 1 MPa.
Additionally, we analyzed the capability of the different architectures to make
predictions on out-of-domain applications, with an uncertainty estimation based
on deep ensembles. The proposed approach provides a robust alternative to
empirical/semi-empirical models for CRs modeling, offering the potential for
more accurate and efficient materials design and optimization.

<br>
<br>
We report a comprehensive single-crystal neutron diffraction investigation of
the Kitaev quantum magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ under hydrostatic pressure.
Utilizing a He-gas pressure cell, we successfully applied an ideal hydrostatic
pressure in situ at low temperatures, which allows to effectively eliminate any
possible influences from the structural transition occurring between 200 K and
50 K under ambient conditions. Our experiments reveal a gradual suppression of
the ziagzag antiferromagnetic order as hydrostatic pressure increases.
Furthermore, a reversible pressure-induced structural transition occurs at a
critical pressure of $P_d$ = 0.15 GPa at 30 K, as evidenced by the absence of
magnetic order and non-uniform changes in lattice constants. The decrease in
magnetic transition temperature is discussed in relation to a pressure-induced
change in the trigonal distortion of the Ru-Cl octahedra in this compound. Our
findings emphasize the significance of the trigonal distortion in Kitaev
materials, and provide a new perspective on the role of hydrostatic pressures
in the realization of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid state in
$\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$.

Black holes are objects that have a large mass and curve space time,
characterized by their event horizon and singularity. Recently, an interesting
concept of analogous black holes has emerged in the field of condensed matter
physics. In this work, the possibility of realizing analogous black holes in
topological material is Ni$_3$In$_2$X$_2$ (X = S, Se) discussed. This work
shows that the type-III Dirac cones of the material can lead to the emergence
of an event horizon and the formation of a black hole-like region near the
Dirac point. In addition, possible experimental signatures of such a system are
discussed and the potential implications of an analogous black hole for the
study of black hole physics in condensed matter systems.

<br>
Can quantum mechanical thermodynamic engines outperform their classical
counterparts? To address one aspect of this question, we experimentally realize
and characterize an isentropic thermodynamic engine that uses a Bose-condensed
working fluid. In this engine, an interacting quantum degenerate gas of bosonic
lithium is subjected to trap compression and relaxation strokes interleaved
with strokes strengthening and weakening interparticle interactions. We observe
a significant enhancement in efficiency and power when using a Bose-condensed
working fluid, compared to the case of a non-degenerate thermal gas. We
demonstrate reversibility, and measure power and efficiency as a function of
engine parameters including compression ratio and cycle time. Results agree
quantitatively with interacting finite temperature field-theoretic simulations
that closely replicate the length and energy scales of the working fluid.

Magnetic skyrmions in two-dimensional lattice are a prominent topic of
condensed matter physics and material science. Current research efforts in this
field are exclusively constrained to Neel-type and antiskyrmion, while
Bloch-type magnetic skyrmions are rarely explored. Here, we report the
discovery of Bloch-type magnetic skyrmions in two-dimensional lattice of
MnInP2Te6, using firstprinciples calculations and Monte-Carlo simulations.
Arising from the joint effect of broken inversion symmetry and strong
spin-orbit coupling, monolayer MnInP2Te6 presents large Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction. This, along with ferromagnetic exchange interaction and
out-ofplane magnetic anisotropy, gives rise to skyrmion physics in monolayer
MnInP2Te6, without needing magnetic field. Remarkably, different from all
previous works on two-dimensional lattice,the resultant magnetic skyrmions
feature Bloch-type, which is protected by D3 symmetry.Furthermore, the
Bloch-type magnetic bimerons are also identified in monolayer MnTlP2Te6. The
phase diagrams of these Bloch-type topological magnetisms under magnetic field,
temperature and strain are mapped out. Our results greatly enrich the research
on magnetic skyrmions in twodimensional lattice.

We investigate a mechanism of multiple-$q$ states consisting of magnetic
dipole and electric quadrupole degrees of freedom in spin-1 triangular-lattice
systems. By systematically analyzing a minimal effective multipole model with
bilinear multipole-multipole interactions in momentum space on a triangular
lattice, we find minimum conditions of multipole interactions leading to the
multiple-$q$ instability at zero temperature even without single-ion magnetic
anisotropy and higher-order interactions. We present six types of triple-$q$
states with different magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole configurations
depending on the model parameters. Our results indicate that the interplay
between dipole and quadrupole degrees of freedom provides another source of
inducing rich multiple-$q$ states.

Magnetic materials with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are of great
interest for the development of nonvolatile magnetic memory and computing
technologies due to their high stabilities at the nanoscale. However,
electrical switching of such perpendicular magnetization in an
energy-efficient, deterministic, scalable manner has remained a big challenge.
This problem has recently attracted enormous efforts in the field of
spintronics. Here, I review recent advances and challenges in the understanding
of the electrical generation of spin currents, the switching mechanisms and the
switching strategies of perpendicular magnetization, the switching current
density by spin-orbit torque of transverse spins, the choice of perpendicular
magnetic materials, and summarize the progress in prototype perpendicular SOT
memory and logic devices toward the goal of energy-efficient, dense, fast
perpendicular spin-orbit torque applications.

<h3>Spin waves in layered antiferromagnets with honeycomb structure</h3>

We develop a description of spin waves in a $3D$ quantum $XY$ antiferromagnet
(AFM) in terms of macroscopic variables, magnetization and N\'eel vector
densities. We consider a layered AFM with spins located on the honeycomb
lattice. In the discussed system, the spectrum of spin waves consists of four
modes, all well captured by our macroscopic description. The gapless mode of
the spin waves, i.e., magnons, is described by a system of equations, which has
a structure general for the Goldstone mode in AFMs. We demonstrate that the
parameters in the spin Hamiltonian can be evaluated by fitting the experimental
data with the results obtained for the four modes using the macroscopic
variable approach. The description of AFM in terms of macroscopic variables can
be easily extended to the case when the lattice of the magnetic substance is
deformed by an external strain or acoustic wave.

The development of many optical quantum technologies depends on the
availability of solid-state single quantum emitters with near-perfect optical
coherence. However, a standing issue that limits systematic improvement is the
significant sample heterogeneity and lack of mechanistic understanding of
microscopic energy flow at the single emitter level and ultrafast timescales.
Here we develop solution-phase single-particle pump-probe spectroscopy with
photon correlation detection that captures sample-averaged dynamics in single
molecules and/or defect states with unprecedented clarity at femtosecond
resolution. We apply this technique to single quantum emitters in
two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride, which suffers from significant
heterogeneity and low quantum efficiency. From millisecond to nanosecond
timescales, the translation diffusion, metastable-state-related bunching
shoulders, rotational dynamics, and antibunching features are disentangled by
their distinct photon-correlation timescales, which collectively quantify the
normalized two-photon emission quantum yield. Leveraging its femtosecond
resolution, spectral selectivity and ultralow noise (two orders of magnitude
improvement over solid-state methods), we visualize electron-phonon coupling in
the time domain at the single defect level, and discover the acceleration of
polaronic formation driven by multi-electron excitation. Corroborated with
results from a theoretical polaron model, we show how this translates to
sample-averaged photon fidelity characterization of cascaded emission
efficiency and optical decoherence time. Our work provides a framework for
ultrafast spectroscopy in single emitters, molecules, or defects prone to
photoluminescence intermittency and heterogeneity, opening new avenues of
extreme-scale characterization and synthetic improvements for quantum
information applications.

Efficient synthesis recipes are needed both to streamline the manufacturing
of complex materials and to accelerate the realization of theoretically
predicted materials. Oftentimes the solid-state synthesis of multicomponent
oxides is impeded by undesired byproduct phases, which can kinetically trap a
reaction in an incomplete non-equilibrium state. We present a thermodynamic
strategy to navigate high-dimensional phase diagrams in search of precursors
that circumvent low-energy competing phases, while maximizing the reaction
energy to drive fast phase transformation kinetics. Using a robotic inorganic
materials synthesis laboratory, we perform a large-scale experimental
validation of our precursor selection principles. For a set of 35 target
quaternary oxides with chemistries representative of intercalation battery
cathodes and solid-state electrolytes, we perform 224 reactions spanning 27
elements with 28 unique precursors. Our predicted precursors frequently yield
target materials with higher phase purity than when starting from traditional
precursors. Robotic laboratories offer a valuable platform for data-driven
experimental synthesis science, and our empirically-validated strategies for
efficient materials synthesis offer a theoretical foundation to guide synthesis
planning algorithms for closed-loop autonomous robotic inorganic materials
synthesis.

Nonlinear optical materials possess wide applications, ranging from terahertz
and mid-infrared detection to energy harvesting. Recently, the correlations
between nonlinear optical responses and topological properties, such as Berry
curvature and the quantum metric tensor, have stimulated great interest. Here,
we report giant room-temperature nonlinearities in an emergent
non-centrosymmetric two-dimensional topological material, the Janus transition
metal dichalcogenides in the 1T' phase, which are synthesized by an advanced
atomic-layer substitution method. High harmonic generation, terahertz emission
spectroscopy, and second harmonic generation measurements consistently reveal
orders-of-the-magnitude enhancement in terahertz-frequency nonlinearities of
1T' MoSSe (e.g., > 50 times higher than 2H MoS$_2$ for 18th order harmonic
generation; > 20 times higher than 2H MoS$_2$ for terahertz emission). It is
elucidated that such colossal nonlinear optical responses come from topological
band mixing and strong inversion symmetry breaking due to the Janus structure.
Our work defines general protocols for designing materials with large
nonlinearities and preludes the applications of topological materials in
optoelectronics down to the monolayer limit. This two-dimensional form of
topological materials also constitute a unique platform for examining origin of
the anomalous high-harmonic generation, with potential applications as building
blocks for scalable attosecond sources.

Elastic recoil detection analysis of transmission layout (T-ERDA) has been
used to determine the ratios of deuterium to hydrogen content in mylar and PPS
films. The determined values of (1.64--1.65)$\times 10^{-4}$ are only slightly
higher than the Standard Mean Ocean Water value ($1.55\cdots \times 10^{-4}$),
indicating that no appreciable concentration of D occurs in the production
process of these films. Because of its one-dimensional layout and thereby
simplified analysis procedure, T-ERDA might be advantageous for common use in
the analysis of deuterium in precious solid samples such as meteorites or those
taken from a planet by a space probe. Furthermore, the present T-ERDA has
provided the differential cross sections of the $^{32}$S($\alpha, {\rm
p})^{35}$Cl nuclear reaction at a recoil angle of 0$^{\circ}$, which contribute
to the database of nuclear reactions.

<h3>Symmetry-based requirement for the measurement of electrical and thermal  Hall conductivity under an in-plane magnetic field</h3>

<br>
<br>
The in-plane (thermal) Hall effect is an unconventional transverse response
when the applied magnetic field is in the (heat) current plane. In contrast to
the normal Hall effect, the in-plane Hall effect requires the absence of
certain crystal symmetries, and possibly manifests a non-trivial topology of
quantum materials. An accurate estimation of the intrinsic in-plane (thermal)
Hall conductivity is crucial to identify the underlying mechanisms as in the
case of the Kitaev spin-liquid candidate alpha-RuCl3. Here, we give the
symmetry conditions for the in-plane Hall effect and discuss the implications
that may impede the experimental evaluation of the in-plane (thermal) Hall
conductivity within the single-device measurement. First, the lack of symmetry
in crystals can create merohedral twin domains that cancel the total Hall
signal. Second, even in a twin-free crystal, the intrinsic response is
potentially contaminated by the out-of-plane conduction in three-dimensional
systems, which is systematically unavoidable in the in-plane Hall systems.
Third, even in a quasi-two-dimensional system, the conversion of (thermal)
resistivity, rho (lambda), to (thermal) conductivity, sigma (kappa) requires
protocols beyond the widely-used simplified formula due to the lack of
in-plane-rotational symmetry. In principle, two independent sample devices are
necessary to accurately estimate the s_xy (k_xy). As a case study, we discuss
the half-integer quantization of the in-plane thermal Hall effect in the
spin-disordered state of alpha-RuCl3. For an accurate measurement of the
thermal Hall effect, it is necessary to avoid crystals with the merohedral
twins contributing oppositely to k_xy, while the out-of-plane transport may
have a negligible effect. To deal with the field-induced rotational-symmetry
breaking, we propose two symmetry-based protocols, improved single-device and
two-device methods.

We consider a system comprising two groups of quantum dimers placed in a
common electromagnetic cavity, and controlled by selectively applying a static
external potential to one of the groups. We show that in the regime of deep
strong coupling to vacuum electromagnetic fluctuations, the emergent
photon-assisted interaction between the dimers leads to a strongly non-linear
quantized cross-polarization response of the first, unbiased group of dimers to
the potential applied to the second group. The total polarization shows a
series of almost ideal steps whose number and position depends on the parity of
the numbers of dimers in the groups. This non-perturbative effect is a
distinctive feature of mesoscopic systems comprising finite number of dimers
and disappears in the thermodynamic limit which is commonly used in the
desciption of the generalized Dicke models.

The computational research that will be presented compares the coherent
states of multiple layer graphene versus the coherent states of lithium ions
diffused within this multilayer graphene. Unlike the prevailing research on
graphene coherent states that uses an external magnetic vector potential, this
research will utilize an electric vector potential that is inherent from the
electron current density that transverses the {\pi}-bonds on the graphene
surface. The results from this study will display that the electric vector
potential produces energies that can lead to coherent states for graphene and
lithiated graphene without the necessity of a strong applied magnetic vector
potential. Two excited states will be analyzed for each material. The first
excited state (n=1) the graphene coherent state energies lags behind the
energies of the lithiated graphene coherent state where as the second excited
state (n=2) the coherent state energies of graphene exceeds that of the
lithiated graphene coherent state.

Understanding phase competition and phase separation in quantum materials
requires access to the spatiotemporal dynamics of electronic ordering phenomena
on a micro- to nanometer length- and femtosecond timescale. While time- and
angle-resolved photoemission (trARPES) experiments provide sensitivity to the
femtosecond dynamics of electronic ordering, they typically lack the required
spatial resolution. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast dark-field photoemission
microscopy (PEEM) using a momentum microscope, providing access to ultrafast
electronic order on the microscale. We investigate the prototypical
charge-density wave (CDW) compound TbTe3 in the vicinity of a buried crystal
defect, demonstrating real- and reciprocal-space configurations combined with a
pump-probe approach. We find CDW order to be suppressed in the region covered
by the crystal defect, most likely due to locally imposed strain. Comparing the
ultrafast dynamics in different areas of the sample reveals a substantially
smaller response to optical excitation and faster relaxation of excited
carriers in the defect area, which we attribute to enhanced particle-hole
scattering and defect-induced relaxation channels.

The charge density wave (CDW) state of 2H-NbSe$_2$ features commensurate
domains separated by domain boundaries accompanied by phase slips known as
discommensurations. We have unambiguously visualized the structure of CDW
domains using a displacement-field measurement algorithm on a scanning
tunneling microscopy image. Each CDW domain is delimited by three vertices and
three edges of discommensurations and is designated by a triplet of integers
whose sum identifies the types of commensurate structure. The observed
structure is consistent with the alternating triangular tiling pattern
predicted by a phenomenological Landau theory. The domain shape is affected by
crystal defects and also by topological defects in the CDW phase factor. Our
results provide a foundation for a complete understanding of the CDW state and
its relation to the superconducting state.

Bosonic condensates of spin-less non-interacting particles confined on a ring
cannot propagate circular periodic currents once rotation symmetry of the
system is broken. However a persistent current may appear due to inter-particle
interactions exceeding some critical strength. In this up-critical regime
breaking of the symmetry between the clockwise and anticlockwise rotations
takes place. We consider this symmetry-breaking scenario in the case of a
spinor condensate of exciton polaritons trapped on a ring split by a potential
barrier. Due to the intrinsic symmetry of the effective spin-orbit interaction
which stems from the linear splitting between transverse-electric and
transverse-magnetic microcavity modes, the potential barrier blocks the
circulating current and imposes linear polarization patterns. On the other
hand, circularly polarized polaritons form circular currents propagating in
opposite directions with equal absolute values of angular momentum. In the
presence of inter-particle interactions, the symmetry of clockwise and
anticlockwise currents can be broken spontaneously. We describe several
symmetry-breaking scenarios which imply either restoration of the global
condensate rotation or the onset of the circular polarization in the
symmetry-broken state.

We investigate dark solitons in two-component Bose systems with competing

the beyond-mean field corrections. Using the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii

solitons in both of them can be engineered to be arbitrarily wide. One family
of solutions, however, has got an anomalous dispersion relation. These
anomalous solitons are able to exist inside quantum droplets and can be treated
as solitonic excitations thereof.

Lowest Landau level wavefunctions are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian of a

known to be holomorphic both in real and momentum spaces, and also exhibit
uniform, translationally invariant, geometrical properties in momentum space.
In this paper, using the Stone-von Neumann theorem, we show that lowest Landau
level wavefunctions are indeed the only possible states with unit Chern number
satisfying these conditions. We also prove the uniqueness of their direct
analogs with higher Chern numbers and provide their expressions.

The first-principles calculations predict a stable biphenylene carbon network
(BPN) like the Boron-nitride structure named inorganic biphenylene network
(I-BPN). A comparison has been done between BPN and I-BPN to examine the
stability of the I-BPN monolayer. We calculate the formation energy, phonon
dispersion and mechanical parameters: young modulus and Poisson ratio for
mechanical stability. It has been found that the stability of I-BPN is
comparable with the BPN. The lattice transport properties reveal that the
phonon thermal conductivity of I-BPN is 10th order low than the BPN. The
electronic band structure reveals that I-BPN is a semiconductor with an
indirect bandgap of 1.88 eV with valence band maximum (VBM) at Y and conduction
band maximum (CBM) at the X high symmetry point. In addition, the
thermoelectric parameters, such as the seebeck coefficient, show the highest
peak value of 0.00292 V/K at 324K. Electronic transport properties reveal that
I-BPN is highly anisotropic along the x and y-axes. Furthermore, the
thermoelectric power factor as a function of chemical potential shows a peak
value of 0.0056 W/mK2 (900K) along the x-axis in the p-type doping region. An
electronic figure of merit shows an amplified peak approach to 1. The total
figure of merit (including lattice transport parameters) shows peak values of
0.378 (0.21) for p-type and 0.24 (0.198) n-type regions along the x(y)
direction. It is notice that the obtain ZT peaks values are higher than any B-N

We study operator correlations of a spinful Luttinger liquid after
introducing a non-Hermitian interaction quench, yielding supersonic modes and
dominant superconducting correlations as signatures of the non-unitary dynamics
as well as spin-charge separation. A comparative analysis with the Hermitian
counterpart, i.e, when the quench is Hermitian, shows a significant difference
in the behavior of the model. We derive exact expressions for different
operator correlations and show that the superconducting correlations decay
slower than the charge and spin-density wave correlations, especially, within
the short-time limit, and at the long-time limit all the operator correlations
merge differed only by phase factors in the case of non-hermitian interaction
quench whereas they do not merge in the case of Hermitian interaction quench.
In both cases known Luttinger liquid universality is retained at the long time
limit. We also analyze how the dynamics of operator correlations vary in the
presence of anisotropy in the quenching parameters.

Flat, non-dispersive bands and topological phase transition in multiple

points are explored within a tight binding framework. We give analytic
prescription, based on a real space decimation scheme, that extracts the energy
eigenvalues corresponding to the flat bands along with their degeneracy. The
topological phase transition is confirmed through the existence of quantized
Zak phase for all the Bloch bands, and the edge states that are protected by
chiral symmetry, consistent with the bulk-boundary correspondence. In addition
to the edge states, the entangled systems are shown to give rise to clusters of
localized eigenstates in the bulk of the system, in contrast to a purely one
dimensional SSH system.

classically forbidden regions and the allowed region. The only hypothesis is
that all exponentially growing components are negligible, which is appropriate
for not narrow wells. Applications including the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and

One of the main degradation mechanisms of the zirconium alloys used in
nuclear reactors is hydrogen embrittlement and hydride formation. The formation
of zirconium hydrides is accompanied by a transformation strain, the effects of
which on the development of localized deformation zones are not
well-understood. This study uses a crystal plasticity finite element model that
is coupled with diffusion subroutines to quantify such effects. For this
purpose, a zirconium specimen was hydrided in the absence of any external
mechanical loads. With the use of electron backscatter diffraction, the
rotation fields around the inter and intragranular hydrides as well as those
located at grain boundaries or triple points were measured at a high spatial
resolution. The as-measured zirconium and hydride morphologies were mapped to
the model for numerical simulation. Both numerical and experimental results
show that hydride precipitation induces large rotation fields within the
zirconium matrix, where such rotations are at their maximum in the vicinity of
hydride tips. While the crystallographic orientations and shapes of hydrides
affect the magnitude of rotation fields, both experimental and modeling results
revealed the development of discrete and parallel geometrically necessary
dislocation fields. It is shown that the stress field resulting from hydride
precipitation affects the patterning of hydrogen distribution, which in return
affects further hydride interlinking.

We study the current-voltage characteristics of a superconducting junction
with particle losses at the contacts. We adopt the Keldysh formalism to compute
the steady-state current for varying transmission of the contact. In the low
transmission regime, the dissipation leads to an enhancement of the current at
low bias, a nonmonotonic dependence of current on dissipation, and the
emergence of new structures in the current-voltage curves. The effect of
dissipation by particle loss is found to be qualitatively different from that
of a finite temperature and a finite inelastic scattering rate in the
reservoirs.

Spontaneously broken symmetries are at the heart of many phenomena of quantum
matter and physics more generally. However, determining the exact symmetries
broken can be challenging due to imperfections such as strain, in particular
when multiple electronic orders form complex interactions. This is exemplified
by charge order in some kagome systems, which are speculated to show nematicity
and flux order from orbital currents. We fabricated highly symmetric samples of
a member of this family, CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, and measured their transport
properties. We find the absence of measurable anisotropy at any temperature in
the unperturbed material, however, a striking in-plane transport anisotropy
appears when either weak magnetic fields or strains are present. A symmetry
analysis indicates that a perpendicular magnetic field can indeed lead to
in-plane anisotropy by inducing a flux order coexisting with more conventional
bond order. Our results provide a unifying picture for the controversial charge
order in kagome metals and highlight the need for microscopic materials control
in the identification of broken symmetries.

Bilayer graphene (BLG) is emerging as a promising host material for
electrically controllable qubits in a two-dimensional system. Of particular
interest is the ability to encode quantum information not only as spin qubits
but also in the so-called valley degree of freedom, a two-fold orbital
degeneracy that arises from the symmetry of the hexagonal Bravais lattice.
Known spin-mixing and orbital-mixing mechanisms are unlikely to be at work for
valleys. Moreover, the topological nature of valley states in BLG promises
unique routes for coherent qubit manipulation. Gate-defined BLG quantum-dot
devices have been recently established as a versatile building block for
accessing high-quality spin and valley quantum states. However, measurements of
the relaxation time of valley states -- which ultimately limits these qubits'
coherence properties and therefore their suitability as practical qubits --
remained so far elusive. Here we report the first measurement of the
characteristic relaxation times of spin and valley states, obtained in a
high-quality BLG device containing gate-defined double quantum dots. We show
that valley states can be distinguished with a fidelity of well above
$99\,\text{%}$ and report remarkably long relaxation time between valley
triplets and singlets, exceeding $500\,\text{ms}$ at $B=250\,\text{mT}$, more
than one order of magnitude longer than the relaxation times we measure for
spin states. Our approach to isolating valley states paves the way to measuring
coherent valley-qubit oscillations and, in combination with the recently
demonstrated electrical tunability of the valley $g$-factor, could provide a
practical platform for the electrical control of long-lived valley qubits in
BLG.

We report the experimental observation of the spin-wave moir\'e edge and
cavity modes using Brillouin light scattering spectro-microscopy in a
nanostructured magnetic moir\'e lattice consisting of two twisted triangle
antidot lattices based on an yttrium iron garnet thin film. Spin-wave moir\'e
edge modes are detected at an optimal twist angle and with a selective
excitation frequency. At a given twist angle, the magnetic field acts as an
additional degree of freedom for tuning the chiral behavior of the magnon edge
modes. Micromagnetic simulations indicate that the edge modes emerge within the
original magnonic band gap and at the intersection between a mini-flatband and
a propagation magnon branch. Our theoretical estimate for the Berry curvature
of the magnon-magnon coupling suggests a non-trivial topology for the chiral
edge modes and confirms the key role played by the dipolar interaction. Our
findings shed light on the topological nature of the magnon edge mode for
emergent moir\'e magnonics.

Various techniques have been applied to visualize superconducting vortices,
providing clues to their electromagnetic response. Here, we present a
wide-field, quantitative imaging of the stray field of the vortices in a
superconducting thin film using perfectly aligned diamond quantum sensors. Our
analysis, which mitigates the influence of the sensor inhomogeneities,
visualizes the magnetic flux of single vortices in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$
with an accuracy of $\pm10~\%$. The obtained vortex shape is consistent with
the theoretical model, and penetration depth and its temperature dependence
agree with previous studies, proving our technique's accuracy and broad
applicability. This wide-field imaging, which in principle works even under
extreme conditions, allows the characterization of various superconductors.

<h3>Chiral filtration and Faraday rotation in multi-Weyl semimetals</h3>

<i>René Côté, Rémi N. Duchesne, Gautier D. Duchesne, Olivier Trépanier</i>
<br>
<br>
In Weyl semimetals with broken inversion and time-reversal symmetries, the
Maxwell equations are modified by the presence of the axion terms $\mathbf{b} $
and $b_{0}$ where, in the simplest case of a two-node Weyl semimetal, $%
2\hslash \mathbf{b}$ is the vector that connects two Weyl nodes in momentum
space and $2\hslash b_{0}$ is the separation in energy of the two Dirac points
of these nodes. These axion terms modify the behavior of electromagnetic waves
inside a Weyl semimetal leading to a number of unique optical properties such
as non-reciprocal propagation, circular and linear dichroism, birefringence and
Faraday and Kerr rotations in the absence of a magnetic field. These effects
can be used to design optical devices that act as broadband chiral filters,
circular polarizers or tunable optical isolators. In this paper, we study in
detail how the Faraday and Kerr rotations as well as the transmission and
reflection of light incident on a slab of Weyl semimetal can be controlled by
varying the different parameters characterizing the Weyl semimetal such as the
axion terms, the Fermi level and Fermi velocity, the background dielectric
constant, the scattering time for intraband scattering, the width of the
semimetal and the dielectric constant of the dielectrics on each side of the
semimetal slab. We extend our analysis to Weyl nodes with Chern number
$n=1,2,3$.

Most properties of solid materials are defined by their internal electric
field and charge density distributions which so far have been difficult to
measure with sufficient spatial resolution. For 2D materials, the electric
field at the atomic level in particular influences the optoelectronic
properties. In this study, the atomic-scale electric field and charge density
distribution of 2D WSe$_2$ are revealed by using an emerging microscopy
technique, differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging in the scanning
transmission electron microscope (STEM). Combined with high-angle annular
dark-field imaging the charge density distribution of bi- and trilayers of
WSe$_2$ is mapped. A measured higher positive charge density located at the
selenium atomic columns compared to the tungsten atomic columns is reported,
and possible reasons are discussed. Furthermore, the change in the electric
field distribution of a selenium point defect in a trilayer is investigated
exhibiting a characteristic electric field distribution in the vicinity of the
defect: there are characteristic regions with locally enhanced and with locally
reduced electric field magnitudes compared to the pristine lattice.

In single-molecule experiments, the dynamics of molecular motors are often
observed indirectly by measuring the trajectory of an attached bead in a
motor-bead assay. In this work, we propose a method to extract the step size
and stalling force for a molecular motor without relying on external control
parameters. We discuss this method for a generic hybrid model that describes
bead and motor via continuous and discrete degrees of freedom, respectively.
Our deductions are solely based on the observation of waiting times and
transition statistics of the observable bead trajectory. Thus, the method is
non-invasive, operationally accessible in experiments and can, in principle, be
applied to any model describing the dynamics of molecular motors. We briefly
discuss the relation of our results to recent advances in stochastic
thermodynamics on inference from observable transitions. Our results are
confirmed by extensive numerical simulations for parameters values of an
experimentally realized F1-ATPase assay.

Materials with AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs) stoichiometry are recently
discovered kagome superconductors with the electronic structure featuring a
Dirac band, van Hove singularities and flat bands. These systems undergo
anomalous charge-density-wave (CDW) transitions at $T_{\rm CDW}$~80-100 K,
resulting in the reconstruction of the Fermi surface from the pristine phase.
Although comprehensive investigations of the electronic structure via quantum
oscillations (QOs) have been performed on the sister compounds CsV$_3$Sb$_5$
and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$, a detailed QO study of KV$_3$Sb$_5$ is so far absent. Here,
we report the Shubnikov-de Haas QO study in KV$_3$Sb$_5$. We resolve a large
number of new frequencies with the highest frequency of 2202 T (occupying ~54%
of the Brillouin zone area in the $k_x$-$k_y$ plane). The Lifshitz-Kosevich
analysis further gives relatively small cyclotron effective masses, and the
angular dependence study reveals the two-dimensional nature of the frequencies
with a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we compare the QO spectra for
all three AV$_3$Sb$_5$ compounds collected under the same conditions, enabling
us to point out the similarities and differences across these systems. Our
results fill in the gap of the QO study in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and provide valuable
data to understand the band structure of all three members of AV$_3$Sb$_5$.

The maximum-weight matching problem and the behavior of its energy landscape
is numerically investigated. We apply a perturbation method adapted from the
analysis of spin glasses. This gives inside into the complexity of the energy
landscape of different ensembles. Erd\"os-Renyi graphs and ring graphs with
randomly added edges are considered and two types of distributions for the
random edge weighs are used. For maximum-weight matching, fast and scalable
algorithms exist, such that we can study large graphs of more than $10^5$
nodes. Our results show that the structure of the energy landscape for standard
ensembles of matching is simple, comparable to the energy landscape of a
ferromagnet. Nonetheless, for some of the here presented ensembles our results
allow for the presence of complex energy landscapes in the spirit of
Replica-Symmetry Breaking.

Detection of effects of the parameters of the synthetic process on the

the resulting plutonium oxide, which match the literature well. We also detect

The newly discovered kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) offer an
exciting route to study exotic phases arising due to interplay between
electronic correlations and topology. Besides superconductivity, these
materials exhibit a charge-density wave (CDW) phase occurring at around 100 K,
whose origin still remains elusive. The robust multi-component $2 \times 2$ CDW
phase in these systems is of great interest due to the presence of an unusually
large anomalous Hall effect. In quasi-2D systems with weak inter-layer coupling
fluctuation driven exotic phases may appear. In particular in systems with
multi-component order parameters fluctuations may lead to establishment of
composite order when only products of individual order parameters condense
while the individual ones themselves remain disordered. We argue that such
fluctuation-driven regime of composite CDW order may exist in thin films of
kagome metals above the CDW transition temperature. We also find that the
transition from the composite to individual CDW order is in the $\mathbb{Z}_3$
Potts universality class. Our findings suggest possible presence of exotic
phases in the weakly coupled layered kagome metals, more so in the newly
synthesized thin films of kagome metals.

Superconductivity in square BX$_2$-plane-based materials currently is only
found in $d^9$ configuration. This raises a question that whether other
configurations $d^{n}$ ($n\neq 9$) of transition metals in the prototype of
square BX$_2$ plane can also host superconductivity. We systematically explore
this question via analyzing the electronic structure of materials from $d^{8}$
to $d^5$ platforms using density-functional calculation, including existing
materials SrFeO$_2$ and SrFeO$_2$F, and proposed ones LaNiO$_2$F and
LaCoO$_2$F. Results show a good commonality between these materials and the
cuprate and nickelate superconductors in their high-energy electronic
structure, namely dominant low-energy states by ligand $p$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$
orbitals. Other $d$ orbitals are all in the high-energy channel due to strong
intra-atomic repulsion resulting in similar low-energy effective Hamiltonian
except for the different number of local spins. These results hopefully suggest
the possible superconductivity besides the prototype of $d^9$. Superconducting
phases found in these sets of materials will be highly valuable to understand
the high-temperature superconductivity and even to find better superconducting
families than the cuprates.

We propose and discuss two variants of kinetic particle models - cellular
automata in 1+1 dimensions, which have some appeal due to their simplicity and
intriguing properties which could warrant further research and applications.
The first model is a deterministic and reversible automaton describing two
species of quasiparticles: stable massless matter particles moving with
velocity $\pm 1$ and unstable, standing (zero velocity) field particles. We
discuss two distinct continuity equations for three conserved charges of the
model. While the first two charges and the corresponding currents have support
three (3) lattice sites and represent a lattice analogue of conserved
energy-momentum tensor, we find an additional conserved charge and current with
support of nine (9) sites, implying non-ergodic behaviour and potentially
signalling integrability of the model with a highly nested R-matrix structure.
The second model represents a quantum (or stochastic) deformation of a recently
introduced and studied charged hardpoint lattice gas, where particles of
different binary charge ($\pm 1$) and binary velocity ($\pm 1$) can
nontrivially mix upon elastic collisional scattering. We show that while the
unitary evolution rule of this model does not satisfy the full Yang-Baxter
equation, it still satisfies an intriguing related identity which gives birth
to an infinite set of local conserved operators, the-so-called glider
operators.

Despite successful use in a wide variety of disciplines for data analysis and
prediction, machine learning (ML) methods suffer from a lack of understanding
of the reliability of predictions due to the lack of transparency and black-box
nature of ML models. In materials science and other fields, typical ML model
results include a significant number of low-quality predictions. This problem
is known to be particularly acute for target systems which differ significantly
from the data used for ML model training. However, to date, a general method
for characterization of the difference between the predicted and training
system has not been available. Here, we show that a simple metric based on
Euclidean feature space distance and sampling density allows effective
separation of the accurately predicted data points from data points with poor
prediction accuracy. We show that the metric effectiveness is enhanced by the
decorrelation of the features using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. To
demonstrate the generality of the method, we apply it to support vector
regression models for various small data sets in materials science and other
fields. Our method is computationally simple, can be used with any ML learning
method and enables analysis of the sources of the ML prediction errors.
Therefore, it is suitable for use as a standard technique for the estimation of
ML prediction reliability for small data sets and as a tool for data set
design.

Stacking of two-dimensional (2D) materials has emerged as a facile strategy
for realising exotic quantum states of matter and engineering electronic
properties. Yet, developments beyond the proof-of-principle level are impeded
by the vast size of the configuration space defined by layer combinations and
stacking orders. Here we employ a density functional theory (DFT) workflow to
calculate interlayer binding energies of 8451 homobilayers created by stacking
1052 different monolayers in various configurations. Analysis of the stacking
orders in 247 experimentally known van der Waals crystals is used to validate
the workflow and determine the criteria for realizable bilayers. For the 2586
most stable bilayer systems, we calculate a range of electronic, magnetic, and
vibrational properties, and explore general trends and anomalies. We identify
an abundance of bistable bilayers with stacking order-dependent magnetic or
electrical polarisation states making them candidates for slidetronics
applications.

Intensive research is carried out on two-dimensional materials, in particular

The emergence of fractonic topological phases and novel universality classes
for quantum dynamics highlights the importance of dipolar symmetry in condensed
matter systems. In this work, we study the properties of symmetry-breaking
phases of the dipolar symmetries in fermionic models in various spatial
dimensions. In such systems, fermions obtain energy dispersion through dipole
condensation. Due to the nontrivial commutation between the translation
symmetry and dipolar symmetry, the Goldstone modes of the dipolar condensate
are strongly coupled to the dispersive fermions and naturally give rise to
non-Fermi liquids at low energies. The IR description of the dipolar
symmetry-breaking phase is analogous to the well-known theory of a Fermi
surface coupled to an emergent U(1) gauge field. We also discuss the crossover
behavior when the dipolar symmetry is slightly broken and the cases with
anisotropic dipolar conservation.
