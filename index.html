<h3>Resolving the Corbino Shockley-Ramo Paradox for Hydrodynamic Current  Noise</h3>

Johnson noise thermometry enables direct measurement of the electron
temperature, a valuable probe of many-body systems. Practical use of this
technique calls for non-equilibrium generalizations of the Johnson-Nyquist
theorem. For a hydrodynamic Corbino device, however, a na\"ive use of the
Shockley-Ramo theorem alongside the "Corbino paradox" leads to yet another
paradox: bulk velocity fluctuations cannot be measured by the contacts. In this
work, we resolve the unphysical "Corbino Shockley-Ramo paradox" by correctly
formulating the hydrodynamic Shockley-Ramo problem. This allows us to properly
formulate the problem of current noise in an hydrodynamic multi-terminal device
of arbitrary geometry, as well as validate a previously unjustified assumption
for rectangular geometry results. As an example, we compute the Johnson noise
in a hydrodynamic Corbino device, where we find a suppression of Johnson noise
with magnetic field. This unusual characteristic serves as a strong signature
of viscous hydrodynamic behavior.

It has been established that the Coulomb interactions can transform the
electron gas into a viscous fluid. This fluid is realized in a number of
platforms, including graphene and two-dimensional semiconductor
heterostructures. The defining characteristic of the electron fluid is the
formation of layers of charge carriers that are in local thermodynamic
equilibrium, as in classical fluids. In the presence of nonuniformities,
whirlpools and nontrivial flow profiles are formed, which have been directly
imaged in recent experiments. In this paper, we theoretically study the
response of the electron fluid to localized magnetic fields. We find that the
electric current is suppressed by viscous vortices in regions where magnetic
field is sharply varying, causing strong transport signatures. Experimentally,
our considerations are relevant since local magnetic fields can be applied to
the system through implanting adatoms or embedding micromagnets in the
top-gate. Our theory is essential for the characterization and future
applications of electron fluids in hydrodynamic spin transport.

Many eukaryotic microorganisms propelled by multiple flagella can swim very
rapidly with distinct gaits. Here, we model a three-dimensional mutiflagellate
swimming strategy, resembling the microalgae, and investigate the effects of
interflagella hydrodynamic interactions (iHIs) on the swimming performance.
When the flagella are actuated synchronously, the swimming efficiency can be
enhanced or reduced by iHIs, determined by the intrinsic tilting angle of the
flagella. The asynchronous gait with a phase difference between neighboring
flagella is found to be important by both utilizing the iHIs and reducing the
oscillatory motion via the basal mechanical coupling. We further demonstrate
that an optimal number of flagella could arise when the microswimmer is loaded
with a swimmer body. Apart from understanding the role of iHIs in the
multiflagellate swimming, this work could also guide laboratory fabrications of
novel microswimmers.

<h3>Floquet-engineering the exceptional points in parity-time-symmetric  magnonics</h3>

Magnons serve as a testing ground for fundamental aspects of Hermitian and
non-Hermitian wave mechanics and are of high relevance for information
technology. This study presents setups for realizing spatio-temporally driven
parity-time (PT) symmetric magnonics based on coupled magnetic waveguides and
magnonic crystals. A charge current in a metal layer with strong spin-orbit
coupling sandwiched between two insulating magnetic waveguides leads to gain or
loss in the magnon amplitude depending on the directions of the magnetization
and the charge currents. When gain in one waveguide is balanced by loss in the
other waveguide a PT-symmetric system hosting non-Hermitian degeneracies (or
exceptional points (EPs)) is realized. For AC current multiple EPs appear for a
certain gain/loss strength and mark the boundaries between the preserved
PT-symmetry and the broken PT-symmetry phases. The number of islands of broken
PT-symmetry phases and their extensions is tunable by the frequency and the
strength of the spacer current. At EP and beyond, the induced and amplified
magnetization oscillations are strong and self-sustained. In particular, these
magnetization auto-oscillations in broken PT-symmetry phase occur at low
current densities and do not require further adjustments such as tilt angle
between electric polarization and equilibrium magnetization direction in
spin-torque oscillators, pointing to a new design of these oscillators and
their utilization in computing and sensoric. It is also shown how the periodic
gain/loss mechanism allows for the generation of high-frequency spin waves with
low-frequency currents. For spatially-periodic gain/loss acting on a magnonic
crystal, magnon modes approaching each other at the Brillouin-zone boundaries
are highly susceptible to PT-symmetry, allowing for a wave-vector-resolved
experimental realization at very low currents.

<h3>The interplay between exciton- and phonon-induced superconductivity  might explain the phenomena observed in LK-99</h3>

<br>
<br>
The experimental results hinting at the room temperature and ambient pressure
superconductivity and magnetic levitation in LK-99 attracted an unprecedented
interest. While attempts of other teams to reproduce the reported observations
on similar samples failed so far, it seems worthwhile to try building a
theoretical model that would explain the ensemble of the available data. One of
important features that needs to be explained is an apparent contradiction
between an extremely high critical temperature Tc and rather modest critical
magnetic field Bc and critical current jc reported for LK-99. We show
theoretically, that these data may be quantitatively reproduced assuming the
interplay between exciton- and phonon-induced superconductivity, while the
conventional BCS or Brinkman-Rice-Bardeen-Cooper-Schriefer (BR-BCS) mechanisms
would result in a much higher Bc for the same Tc.

<h3>Weyl points and spin-orbit coupling in copper-substituted lead phosphate  apatite</h3>

<br>
We study the impact of spin-orbit coupling on the topological band-properties
of copper-substituted lead phosphate apatite using a combination of
group-theoretical analysis and full-relativistic density-functional theory
calculations. We characterize Weyl points at time-reversal invariant momenta
and find that a band-inversion due to spin-orbit coupling leads to additional
Weyl points close to the Fermi-edge at general momenta. To determine the
position of the altogether 66 Weyl points in the Brilouin-zone, we develop an
algorithm that follows a Berry-curvature-derived vector field to its monopole:
the Weyl point. The emerging surface Fermi-arcs and their spin-polarization
reveal avoided crossings and a Fermi-loop detached from the Weyl points.

<h3>Supercurrent-induced spin switching via indirect exchange interaction</h3>

Localized spins of single atoms adsorbed on surfaces have been proposed as
building blocks for spintronics and quantum computation devices. However,
identifying a way to achieve current-induced switching of spins with very low
dissipation is an outstanding challenge with regard to practical applications.
Here, we show that the indirect exchange interaction between spin impurities
can be controlled by a dissipationless supercurrent. All that is required is a
conventional superconductor and two spin impurities placed on its surface. No
triplet Cooper pairs or exotic material choices are needed. This finding
provides a new and accessible way to achieve the long-standing goal of
supercurrent-induced spin switching.

At low temperatures, the interaction of a nanoscale magnet with a Fermi gas
can give rise to the Kondo effect. This is signaled by a zero-bias resonance
with a characteristic temperature evolution of its linewidth. In order to prove
the Kondo nature of the zero-bias peak and to determine the Kondo temperature
in scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), the extrinsic contributions to the
measured linewidth have to be properly taken into account. In this paper, by
combination of precise STS measurements of an ideal spin-1/2 Kondo system,
phenalenyl on Au(111), and by theoretical considerations, we show how to
efficiently extract accurate intrinsic Kondo linewidths from finite-temperature
STS measurements. The extracted linewidths fit very well with a recently
derived expression for the intrinsic Kondo linewidth as a function of
temperature, thus proving the validity of the theory. Finally, we show that the
developed methodology allows to reliably extract the intrinsic Kondo width from
a single spectrum measured at finite temperature, thus considerably reducing
the experimental effort.

<h3>Thermal Phase Diagram of the Square Lattice Ferro-antiferromagnetic  $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg Model</h3>

Using state of the art tensor network computations combined with spin wave
theory, we compute the finite temperature phase diagram of the spin 1/2
$J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice with ferromagnetic $J_1 < 0$
and antiferromagnetic $J_2 > 0$. We localize the first order line originating
from the first order zero temperature point as well as the second order thermal
transition at large $J_2$ associated with spontaneous lattice rotation symmetry
breaking. This second order line terminates at a critical end point where it
meets the first order line. We found no evidence for an intermediate phase.

<h3>Anomalous Hall effect in the antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal SmAlSi</h3>

<br>
The intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) has been reported in numerous
ferromagnetic (FM) Weyl semimetals. However, AHE in the antiferromagnetic (AFM)
or paramagnetic (PM) state of Weyl semimetals has been rarely observed
experimentally, and only in centrosymmetric materials. Different mechanisms
have been proposed to establish the connection between the AHE and the type of
magnetic order. In this paper, we report AHE in both the AFM and PM states of
non-centrosymmetric compound SmAlSi. To account for the AHE in
non-centrosymmetric Weyl semimetals without FM, we introduce a new mechanism
based on magnetic field-induced Weyl nodes evolution. Angle-dependent quantum
oscillations in SmAlSi provide evidence for the Weyl points and large AHE in
both the PM and the AFM states. The proposed mechanism qualitatively explains
the temperature dependence of the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC), which
displays unconventional power law behavior of the AHC in both AFM and PM states
of SmAlSi.

<h3>The normal Casimir force for lateral moving planes with isotropic  conductivities</h3>

<br>
<br>
We consider the two planes with isotropic conductivity that are in relative
lateral motion with velocity $v$ and inter-plane distance $a$. Two models of
conductivity are taken into account -- the constant and frequency-dependent
Drude model. The normal (perpendicular to planes) Casimir force is analysed in
detail for two systems -- i) two planes with identical conductivity and ii) one
of the planes is a perfect metal. The velocity correction to the Casimir energy
$\Delta_v\mathcal{E} \sim v^2$ for small velocity for all considered cases. In
the case of the constant conductivity $\eta$, the energy correction is $
\Delta_v\mathcal{E} \sim \frac{\eta}{a^3} \left(\frac{v}{\eta}\right)^2$for
$v\ll \eta \ll 1$.

<h3>Quantitative predictions of the thermal conductivity in transition metal  dichalcogenides: The impact of point defects in MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$ monolayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09405" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09405</a>

<br>
<br>
Transition metal dichalcogenides are investigated for various applications at
the nanoscale thanks to their unique combination of properties and
dimensionality. For many of the anticipated applications, heat conduction plays
an important role. At the same time, these materials often contain relatively
large amounts of point defects. Here, we provide a systematic analysis of the
impact of intrinsic and selected extrinsic defects on the lattice thermal
conductivity of MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$ monolayers. We combine Boltzmann transport
theory and the Green's function-based T-matrix approach for the calculation of
scattering rates. The force constants for the defect configurations are
obtained from density functional theory calculations via a regression approach,
which allows us to sample a rather large number of defects at a moderate
computational cost and to systematically enforce both the translational and
rotational acoustic sum rules. The calculated lattice thermal conductivity is
in quantitative agreement with experimental data for heat transport and defect
concentrations for both MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$. Crucially, this demonstrates that
the strong deviation from a 1/T-temperature dependence of the lattice thermal
conductivity observed experimentally, can be fully explained by the presence of
point defects. We furthermore predict the scattering strengths of the intrinsic
defects to decrease in the sequence $V_{Mo}\approx
V_{2S}^=>V_{2S}^\perp>V_S>S_{ad}$ in both materials, while the scattering rates
for the extrinsic (adatom) defects decrease with increasing mass such that
Li$_{ad}$>Na$_{ad}$>K$_{ad}$. Compared to earlier work, we find that both
intrinsic and extrinsic adatoms are relatively weak scatterers. We attribute
this difference to the treatment of the translational and rotational acoustic
sum rules, which if not enforced can lead to spurious contributions in the
zero-frequency limit.

<h3>Topological properties of nearly flat bands in $Œ±-\mathcal{T}3$  lattice bilayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09415" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09415</a>

We study the effect of Haldane flux in bilayer $\alpha-\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice
system for possible non-equivalent, commensurate stacking configurations with
tight-binding formalism. Bilayer $\alpha-\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice has six
sublattices in a unit cell and its spectrum comprises six bands.
In the absence of Haldane flux, there are threefold band-crossings at the two
Dirac points for both valance and conduction bands. Introduction of Haldane
flux in a cyclically stacked bilayer $\alpha-\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice system
makes all six bands including two low-energy corrugated partial-flat bands
separated and each band possesses non-zero Chern numbers, making the system
topological.
It is shown that the topological evolution can be incorporated by modifying
the hopping strength between sublattice $B$ and $C$ along all three directions,
keeping those between $A$ and $B$ sublattices unchanged, or in other words,
changing the parameter $\alpha$ in each layer.
In the dice lattice limit of the Chern-insulating phase, the Chern numbers of
the three pairs of bands from low energy to higher energies are $\pm 2$, $\pm
3$, and $\pm 1$. Continuous change of parameter $\alpha$ invokes a phase
transition through a band crossing between the two lower energy bands, at
different values for conduction and valance bands, which further depend on the
next nearest neighbor (NNN) hopping strength.
The Chern numbers of the two lower conduction and valance bands
discontinuously change from $\pm2$ to $\pm 6$, $\pm 3$ to $0$ at the transition
point, leaving the Chern number of the third band intact

<h3>Unveiling UV/IR Mixing via Symmetry Defects: A View from Topological  Entanglement Entropy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09425" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09425</a>
<br>
<i>Jintae Kim, Yun-Tak Oh, Daniel Bulmash, Jung Hoon Han</i>
<br>
<br>
Some topological lattice models in two spatial dimensions have been found to
exhibit intricate system size dependence in their ground state degeneracy
(GSD), often known as UV/IR mixing. We distinguish between two explanations for
this phenomenon by explicitly calculating the topological entanglement entropy
(TEE) of a model system, the rank-2 toric code, for a bi-partition of the torus
into two cylinders. Focusing on the fact that the rank-2 toric code is a
translation symmetry-enriched topological phase, we show that viewing distinct
system sizes as different translation symmetry defects can explain both our TEE
results and the GSD of the rank-2 toric code. Our work establishes the symmetry
defect framework as the most complete description of this system size
dependence.

<h3>Memristive response and capacitive spiking in the aqueous ion transport  through 2D nanopore arrays</h3>

<i>Yechan Noh, Alex Smolyanitsky</i>
<br>
<br>
In living organisms, information is processed in interconnected symphonies of
ionic currents spiking through protein ion channels. As a result of dynamically
switching their conductive states, ion channels exhibit a variety of
current-voltage nonlinearities and memory effects. Fueled by the promise of
computing architectures entirely different from von Neumann, recent attempts to
identify and harness similar phenomena in artificial nanofluidic environments
focused on demonstrating analog circuit elements with memory. Here we explore
aqueous ionic transport through two-dimensional (2D) membranes featuring arrays
of ion-trapping crown-ether-like pores. We demonstrate that for aqueous salts
featuring ions with different ion-pore binding affinities, memristive effects
emerge through coupling between the time-delayed state of the system and its
transport properties. We also demonstrate a nanopore array that behaves as a
capacitor with a strain-tunable built-in barrier, yielding behaviors ranging
from current spiking to ohmic response. By focusing on the illustrative
underlying mechanisms, we demonstrate that realistically observable memory
effects may be achieved in nanofluidic systems featuring crown-porous 2D
membranes.

<br>
<br>
We report terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (TDTS) experiments demonstrating
strong light-matter coupling in a terahertz (THz) LC-metamaterial in which the
phonon resonance of a topological insulator (TI) thin film is coupled to the
photonic modes of an array of electronic split-ring resonators. As we tune the
metamaterial resonance frequency through the frequency of the low frequency
$\alpha$ mode of (Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_2$Te$_3$ (BST), we observe strong mixing
and level repulsion between phonon and metamaterial resonance. This hybrid
resonance is a phonon polariton. We observe a normalized coupling strength,
$\eta$ = $\Omega_R$/$\omega_c$ $\approx$ 0.09, using the measured vacuum Rabi
frequency and cavity resonance. Our results demonstrate that one can tune the
mechanical properties of materials by changing their electromagnetic
environment and therefore modify their magnetic and topological degrees of
freedom via coupling to the lattice in this fashion.

<h3>Anyon Condensation Web and Multipartite Entanglement in 2D Fracton-like  Theories</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09490" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09490</a>
<br>
<i>Guilherme Delfino, Yizhi You</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we introduce an anyon condensation web that interconnects a
broad class of 2D fracton gauge theories with multipolar conservation laws at a
microscopic level. We find that condensation of anyons triggers the emergence
of additional spatially modulated symmetries, which has the general effect of
increasing the number of super-selection anyon sectors, as well as the ground
state degeneracy for systems with periodic boundary conditions. As explicit
examples, we start with the rank-2 toric code model and implement various anyon
condensation protocols, resulting in a range of 2D fracton-like theories, each
with a distinct gauge structure. We also expand the scope of anyon condensation
by introducing lattice defects into spatially modulated gauge theories and
demonstrate that these geometric defects can be viewed as effective anyon
condensations along the branch cut. Furthermore, we introduce the Multipartite
Entanglement Mutual Information measure as a diagnostic tool to differentiate
among various distinct multipole conserving phases. A captivating observation
is the UV sensitivity of the mutual information sourced from multipartite
entanglement in such spatially modulated gauge theories, which depends on the
geometric cut and the system size, and exhibits periodic oscillations at large
distances.

<br>
Electrical control of the non-trivial topology in Weyl antiferromagnet is of
great interests to develop next-generation spintronic devices. Recent works
suggest that spin Hall effect can switch the topological antiferromagnetic
order. However, the switching efficiency remains relatively low. Here, we
demonstrate effective manipulation of antiferromagnetic order in Weyl semimetal
Mn3Sn by orbital Hall effect originated from metal Mn or oxide CuOx. While
Mn3Sn is proven to be able to convert orbit current to spin current by itself,
we find that inserting a heavy metal layer like Pt with proper thickness can
effectively reduce the critical switching current density by one order of
magnitude. In addition, we show that the memristor-like switching behavior of
Mn3Sn can mimic the potentiation and depression processes of a synapse with
high linearity, which is beneficial for constructing artificial neural network
with high accuracy. Our work paves an alternative way to manipulate topological
antiferromagnetic order and may inspire more high-performance antiferromagnetic
functional devices.

Superconductivity has been found in RuN films obtained by reactive magnetron
sputtering. This is a novel member of the metal nitride superconductors family.
The critical temperature of the superconducting transition varies depending on
the substrate and ranges from 0.77 K to 1.29 K. The parameters of the crystal
lattice of superconducting films have been determined: the lattice is distorted
cubic with parameters $a = b = c = 4.5586$ \AA , $\alpha =\beta =\gamma
=87.96^\circ$. A zero temperature upper critical magnetic field $H_{c2}(0)$ and
the coherence length were found from the experimental data using WHH model.
$H_{c2}(0) = 2.3$ T- 4.1 T for different substrates and exceeds the upper
paramagnetic limit, as well as $\xi = 12$ nm. An s-wave single band energy gap
$\Delta(0) = 0.19$ meV was revealed by self-field critical current experiment
at temperatures down to 10 mK, $2\Delta /kT_c =5.5$ exceeding the BCS ratio
3.5.

Networks composed of nanoscale memristive components, such as nanowire and
nanoparticle networks, have recently received considerable attention because of
their potential use as neuromorphic devices. In this study, we explore the
connection between ergodicity in memristive and nanowire networks, showing that
the performance of reservoir devices improves when these networks are tuned to
operate at the edge between two global stability points. The lack of ergodicity
is associated with the emergence of memory in the system. We measure the level
of ergodicity using the Thirumalai-Mountain metric, and we show that in the
absence of ergodicity, two memristive systems show improved performance when
utilized as reservoir computers (RC). In particular, we highlight that it is
also important to let the system synchronize to the input signal in order for
the performance of the RC to exhibit improvements over the baseline.

Reliable and controllable switches are crucial in nanofluidics and
iontronics. Ion channels in nature serve as a rich source of inspiration due to
their intricate mechanisms modulated by stimuli like pressure, temperature,
chemicals, and voltage. The artificial replication of the properties of these
channels is challenging due to their complex chemistry, limited stability
range, and intricate moving parts, allosterically modulated. Nonetheless, we
can harness some of their gating mechanisms for nanofluidic and iontronic
purposes. This theoretical and computational study explores the use of
electrowetting in hydrophobic nanopores to control their conductance using an
external applied voltage. We employ restrained molecular dynamics to calculate
the free energy required for wetting a model nanopore under different voltages.
Utilizing a simple theory, we generate free energy profiles across a wide
voltage range. We also computed transition rates between conductive and
non-conductive states, showing their voltage dependence and how this behaviour
can impair memory to the system, resembling the memristor behaviour
voltage-gated channels in the brain. These findings offer a promising avenue
for designing and controlling hydrophobic nanopores via electrowetting,
enabling potential applications in neuromorphic iontronics.

Vortex matter in layered high-$T_c$ superconductors, including
iron-pnictides, undergo several thermodynamic phase transitions due to the
complex interplay of pinning energy, thermal energy and elastic energy.
Moreover, the presence of anisotropy makes their vortex physics even more
intriguing. Here, we report a detailed vortex dynamics study, using dc
magnetization measurements, in a triclinic iron-pnictide superconductor
(Ca$_{0.85}$La$_{0.15}$)$_{10}$(Pt$_3$As$_8$)(Fe$_2$As$_2$)$_5$, with a
superconducting transition temperature, T$_c$ $\sim$ 31 K. A second
magnetization peak (SMP) feature is observed for magnetic field perpendicular
($H$$\parallel$$c$) and parallel ($H$$\parallel$$ab$) to the crystal plane.
However, its fundamental origin is quite different in both directions. For
$H$$\parallel$$c$, the SMP can be well explained using an elastic-to-plastic
vortex creep crossover, using collective creep theory. In addition, a possible
rhombic-to-square vortex lattice phase transition is also observed for fields
in between the onset-field and peak-field related to the SMP. On the other
hand, for $H$$\parallel$$ab$, a clear signature of an order-disorder vortex
phase transition is observed in the isothermal $M$($H$) measurements at $T$
$\geq$ 6 K. The disordered phase exhibits the characteristics of entangled
pinned vortex-liquid. We construct a comprehensive vortex phase diagram by
displaying characteristic temperatures and magnetic fields for both crystal
geometries in this unique superconducting compound. Our study sheds light on
the intricate vortex dynamics and pinning in an iron-pnictide superconductor
with triclinic symmetry.

We analyze the two-body spectrum within the Hofstadter-Hubbard model on a
square lattice through an exact variational ansatz and study the topological
properties of its low-lying two-body bound-state branches. In particular we
discuss how the Hofstadter-Hubbard butterfly of the two-body branches evolves
as a function of onsite interactions and how to efficiently calculate their
Chern numbers using the Fukui-Hatsugai-Suzuki approach. Our numerical results
are fully consistent with the simple picture that appears in the
strong-coupling limit, where the attraction between fermions forms a composite
boson characterized by an effective hopping parameter and an effective
magnetic-flux ratio.

Wigner's seminal work on the Poincar\'e group revealed one of the fundamental
principles of quantum theory: symmetry groups are projectively represented. The
condensed-matter counterparts of the Poincar\'e group could be the spacetime
groups of periodically driven crystals or spacetime crystals featuring
spacetime periodicity. In this study, we establish the general theory of
projective spacetime symmetry algebras of spacetime crystals, and reveal their
intrinsic connections to gauge structures. As important applications, we
exhaustively classify (1,1)D projective symmetry algebras and systematically
construct spacetime lattice models for them all. Additionally, we present three
consequences of projective spacetime symmetry that surpass ordinary theory: the
electric Floquet-Bloch theorem, Kramers-like degeneracy of spinless Floquet
crystals, and symmetry-enforced crossings in the Hamiltonian spectral flows.
Our work provides both theoretical and experimental foundations to explore
novel physics protected by projective spacetime symmetry of spacetime crystals.

We use junctions of critical spin-1 chains as the basic elements to construct
a honeycomb network that harbors a gapless chiral spin liquid phase. The
low-energy modes are described by spin-1 Majorana fermions that form a
two-dimensional Fermi surface when the interactions at the junctions are tuned
to the vicinity of chiral fixed points with staggered chirality. We discuss the
physical properties and the stability of this chiral spin liquid phase against
perturbations from the point of view of the effective field theory for the
network. We find clear connections with the excitation spectrum obtained in
parton constructions on the kagome lattice.

Antiferromagnetic antiperovskites, where magnetically active 3$d$ metal
cations are placed in the octahedral corners of a perovskite structure, are in
the spotlight due to their intertwined magnetic structure and topological
properties. Especially their anomalous Hall conductivity, which can be
controlled by applied strain and/or electric field, makes them highly
attractive in different electronic applications. Here, we present the study and
theoretical understanding of a new antiperovskite compound that can offer
enormous opportunities in a broad set of applications. Using first-principles
calculations, we investigated the structure, lattice dynamics, noncollinear
magnetic ordering, and electronic behavior in the Vanadium-based antiperovskite
V$_3$AuN. We found an antiperovskite structure centered on N similar to the
Mn$_3A$N family as the structural ground state. In such a phase, a
\emph{Pm$\bar{3}$m} ground state was found in contrast to the \emph{Cmcm}
post-antiperovskite layered structure, as in the V$_3A$N, $A$ = Ga, Ge, As, and
P. We studied the lattice dynamics and electronic properties, demonstrating its
vibrational stability in the cubic structure and a chiral antiferromagnetic
noncollinear ordering as a magnetic ground state. Finally, we found that the
anomalous Hall conductivity, associated with the topological features induced
by the magnetic symmetry, is $\sigma_{xy}$ = $-$291 S$\cdot$cm$^{-1}$
($\sigma_{111}$ = $-$504 S$\cdot$cm$^{-1}$). The latter is the largest reported
in the antiferromagnetic antiperovskite family of compounds.

<h3>Reduced probability densities of long-lived metastable states as those  of distributed thermal systems: possible experimental implications for  supercooled fluids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09641" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09641</a>

<i>Zohar Nussinov</i>
<br>
<br>
When liquids are cooled sufficiently rapidly below their melting temperature,
they may bypass crystalization and, instead, enter a long-lived metastable
supercooled state that has long been the focus of intense research. Although
they exhibit strikingly different properties, both the (i) long-lived
supercooled liquid state and (ii) truly equilibrated (i.e., conventional
equilibrium fluid or crystalline) phases of the same material share an
identical Hamiltonian. This suggests a mapping between dynamical and other
observables in these two different arenas. We formalize these notions via a
simple theorem and illustrate that given a Hamiltonian defining the dynamics:
(1) the {\em reduced} probability densities of all possible stationary states
are linear combinations of reduced probability densities associated with
thermal equilibria at different temperatures, chemical potentials, etc. (2)
Excusing special cases, amongst all of these stationary states, a clustering of
correlations is only consistent with conventional thermal equilibrium states
(associated with a sharp distribution of the above state variables). (3) Other
stationary states may be modified so as to have local correlations. These
deformations concomitantly lead to metastable (yet possibly very long-lived)
states. Since the lifetime of the supercooled state is exceptionally long
relative to the natural microscopic time scales, their reduced probability
densities may be close to those that we find for exact stationary states (i.e.,
a weighted average of equilibrium probability densities at different state
variables). This form suggests several new predictions such as the existence of
dynamical heterogeneity stronger than probed for thus far and a relation
between the specific heat peak and viscosities. Our theorem may further place
constraints on the putative "ideal glass" phase.

<i>V. G. M. Duarte, D. R. da Costa, N. M. R. Peres, L. K. Teles, A. J. Chaves</i>
<br>
<br>
Using the tight-binding model, we report a gap opening in the energy spectrum
of the twisted bilayer graphene under the application of pressure, that can be
further amplified by the presence of a perpendicular bias voltage. The valley
edges are located along the K-Gamma path of the superlattice Brillouin Zone,
with the bandgap reaching values up to 200 meV in the single-particle picture.
Employing the formalism of the semiconductor Bloch equations, we observe an
enhancement of the bandgap due to the electron-electron interaction, with a
renormalization of the bandgap of about 160 meV. From the solution of the
corresponding Bethe-Salpeter equation, we show that this system supports highly
anisotropic bright excitons whose electrons and holes are strongly hybridized
between the adjacent layers.

<br>
Spectral diffusion (SD) represents a substantial obstacle towards
implementation of solid-state quantum emitters as a source of indistinguishable
photons. By performing high-resolution emission spectroscopy for individual
colloidal quantum dots at cryogenic temperatures, we prove the causal link
between the quantum-confined Stark effect and SD. Statistically analyzing the
wavelength of emitted photons, we show that increasing the sensitivity of the
transition energy to an applied electric field results in amplified spectral
fluctuations. This relation is quantitatively fit to a straightforward model,
indicating the presence of a stochastic electric field on a microscopic scale
whose standard deviation is 9 kV/cm, on average. Compensating the commonly
observed intrinsic electric bias with an external one, we find that SD can be
suppressed by up to a factor of three in CdSe/CdS core/shell nanorods. The
current method will enable the study of SD in multiple types of quantum
emitters, such as solid-state defects or organic lead-halide perovskite quantum
dots, for which spectral instability is a critical barrier for applications in
quantum sensing.

<br>
Nonlinear optical (NLO) responses have garnered tremendous interest for
decades due to their fundamental and technological interests. The theory and
calculations of NLO responses including electron-hole interactions, which is
especially crucial for reduced-dimensional materials, however, remain
underdeveloped. Here, we develop an ab initio approach to calculate
second-order nonlinear responses (such as second harmonic generation (SHG) and
shift current) with excitonic effects in an exciton-state basis, going beyond
the independent-particle approximation. We compute SHG in monolayer h-BN and
MoS2 employing exciton states from GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE)
calculations and show both materials exhibit huge excitonic enhancement. The
physical origin of the enhancement is directly understood through the coupling
amplitudes among exciton states, assisted with diagrammatic representations.
Our method provides an accurate and ab initio description of second-order NLO
responses, capturing self-energy and electron-hole interaction effects.

Holes in silicon quantum dots are promising for spin qubit applications due
to the strong intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. The spin-orbit coupling produces
complex hole-spin dynamics, providing opportunities to further optimize spin
qubits. Here, we demonstrate a singlet-triplet qubit using hole states in a
planar metal-oxide-semiconductor double quantum dot. We observe rapid qubit
control with singlet-triplet oscillations up to 400 MHz. The qubit exhibits
promising coherence, with a maximum dephasing time of 600 ns, which is enhanced
to 1.3 us using refocusing techniques. We investigate the magnetic field
anisotropy of the eigenstates, and determine a magnetic field orientation to
improve the qubit initialisation fidelity. These results present a step forward
for spin qubit technology, by implementing a high quality singlet-triplet
hole-spin qubit in planar architecture suitable for scaling up to 2D arrays of

<br>
<br>
In the half-filled one-orbital Hubbard model on a square lattice, we study
the effect of next-nearest neighbor hopping on the single-particle spectral
function at finite temperature using an exact-diagonalization + Monte-Carlo
based approach to the simulation process. We find that the pseudogap-like dip,
existing in the density of states in between the N\'{e}el temperature $T_N$ and
a relatively higher temperature $T^*$, is accompanied with a significant
asymmetry in the hole- and particle-excitation energy along the high-symmetry
directions as well as along the normal-state Fermi surface. On moving from
($\pi/2, \pi/2$) toward $(\pi, 0)$ along the normal state Fermi surface, the
hole-excitation energy increases, a behavior remarkably similar to what is
observed in the $d$-wave state and pseudogap phase of high-$T_c$ cuprates,
whereas the particle-excitation energy decreases. The quasiparticle peak height
is the largest near ($\pi/2, \pi/2$) whereas it is the smallest near $(\pi,
0)$. These spectral features survive beyond $T_N$. The temperature window $T_N
\lesssim T \lesssim T^*$ shrinks with an increase in the next-nearest neighbor
hopping, which indicates that the next-nearest neighbor hopping may not be
supportive to the pseudogap-like features.

difference between the signal received by the FET source and drain

In a sheared steady state, glasses reach a nonequilibrium criticality called
yielding. In this letter, we report that the qualitative nature of this
nonequilibrium critical phenomenon depends on the details of the system and
that responses and fluctuations are governed by different critical correlation
lengths in specific situations. This scale separation of critical lengths
arises when the screening of elastic propagation of mechanical signals is not
negligible. We also explain that the impact of the screening effects is
crucially determined by the microscopic dissipation mechanism.

The relatively low thermal conductivity of biodegradable polylactic acid
(PLA) has limited its applications in various fields. To address this issue,
the incorporation of nanofillers, such as boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs), has
emerged as an effective method to enhance PLA's thermal properties. However,
the thermal conduction of polymer-based nanocomposites is strongly influenced
by interfacial thermal resistance. In this study, we investigate the impact of
pristine and surface-treated BNNSs on the thermal behavior of PLA using
molecular dynamics simulations. To enhance interfacial interactions and reduce
chain mobility during heat transfer, we chemically modify the surface of BNNSs
by introducing three different functional groups (NH2, OH, and COOH) with
varying polarities. Our findings suggest that oxygen-containing groups, namely
OH and COOH, exhibit stronger interfacial interactions compared to the other
cases. We also systematically apply different percentages of these functional
groups (i.e., 2.5, 5, and 7.5) and observe that a higher number of functional
groups leads to a greater improvement in interfacial thermal transport,
attributed to the enhanced phonon coupling effect. To complete the discussion,
we thoroughly study the influence of random and agglomerated patterns of
functional groups distribution.

We study the equilibrium properties of the spin-$1/2$ XY chain with an
infinite-range transverse interaction. At zero temperature, competition between
the XY- and the $z$-ordered phases induced by the infinite-range interactions
gives rise to a first-order transition upon increasing the transverse coupling.
We show that the two gapless points of the XY model behave in fundamentally
different ways: isotropic spin chains experience a first-order transition at
finite coupling; maximal anisotropic chains overcome a non-algebraic phase
transition at zero coupling strength. The phase diagram depicts a first-order
reentrant transition that turns second-order along a tricritical line
separating a paramagnetic phase from an ordered one at finite temperature. The
mean-field approach captures the local properties of the eigenstates and
reveals the appearance of a magnetization gap in the spectrum. Global
properties, e.g., entanglement entropy, are well approximated only at spectral
boundaries. The mean entanglement entropy and the level-spacing ratio deviate
from the Gaussian results, revealing the interacting nature of the problem.

We examine charge correlations and instabilities in the pseudogap phase of
high-$T_c$ cuprates modeled by $d$-density wave ordering. The latter has a gap
symmetry similar to the one observed in the $d$-wave superconductor. We use
$t$-$J$ model to describe the charge correlations in the presence of
electron-phonon interaction. Our finding suggest that the charge instability in
the normal state is dominating at an incommensurate wavevector along (1, 1)
instead of (1, 0) for a realistic interaction parameter. The dominance at the
diagonal wavevector is further enhanced if the coupling between electron and
bond-buckling $B_{1g}$ phonon is incorporated. On the other hand, a dominating
charge-density correlation develops along (1, 0) at an incommensurate
wavevector in the $d$-density wave ordered state, which shows a qualitative
agreement with the experiments. The correlation becomes robust only in the
presence of $B_{1g}$ phonon.

Tensor network based methods are promising candidates to solve quantum
impurity problems, which are free of sampling noises and the sign problem
compared to state-of-the-art continuous time quantum Monte Carlo methods. A
recent progress made in tensor network based impurity solvers is to use the
Feynman-Vernon influence functional to integrate out the bath analytically,
retaining only the impurity dynamics and representing it compactly as a matrix
product state. The recently proposed Grassmann time-evolving matrix product
operator (GTEMPO) method is one of the representative methods in this
direction. In this work we systematically study the performance of GTEMPO in
solving equilibrium quantum impurity problems at a finite temperature with
semicircular spectrum density of the bath. Our results show that its
computational cost would generally increase as the temperature goes down and
scale exponentially with the number of orbitals. In particular, the
single-orbital Anderson impurity model can be efficiently solved with this
method, for two orbitals we estimate that one could possibly reach inverse
temperature $\beta\approx 20$ if high performance computing techniques are
utilized, while beyond that only very high temperature regimes can be reached
in the current formalism. Our work paves the way to apply GTEMPO as an
imaginary-time impurity solver.

Point defects may introduce defect levels into the fundamental band gap of
the host semiconductors that alter the electrical properties of the material.
As a consequence, the in-gap defect levels and states automatically lower the
threshold energy of optical excitation associated with the optical gap of the
host semiconductor. It is, therefore, a common assumption that solid state
defect emitters in semiconductors ultimately alter the conductivity of the
host. Here we demonstrate on a particular defect in 4H silicon carbide that a
yet unrecognized class of point defects exists which are optically active but
electrically inactive in the ground state.

<h3>Memory switching due to thermal noise in amorphous solids subject to  cyclic shear</h3>

<br>
The discovery that memory of particle configurations and plastic events can
be stored in amorphous solids subject to oscillatory shear has spurred research
into methods for storing and retrieving information from these materials.
However, it is unclear to what extent the ability to store memory is affected
by thermal fluctuations and other environmental noise, which are expected to be
relevant in realistic situations. Here, we show that while memory has a long
lifetime at low temperatures, thermal fluctuations eventually lead to a
catastrophic loss of memory, resulting in the erasure of most or all of the
stored information within a few forcing cycles. We observe that an escape from
the memory-retaining state (limit cycle) is triggered by a change in the
switching of plastic events, leading to a cascade of new plastic events that
were not present in the original limit cycle. The displacements from the new
plastic events change the particle configuration which leads to the loss of
memory. We further show that the rate of escaping from a limit cycle increases
in a non-Arrhenius manner as a function of temperature, and the probability of
staying in a limit cycle decays exponentially with an increase in the shearing
frequency. These results have important implications for memory storage since
increasing the temperature offers a means of effectively erasing existing
memories and allowing for the imprinting of new ones that can then be stored
for a long time at low temperatures.

We report a study of the structural, magnetic, transport, and thermodynamic
properties of polycrystalline samples of CeRhC$_2$. CeRhC$_2$ crystallizes in a
tetragonal structure with space group $P4_1$ and it orders
antiferromagnetically below $T_\textrm{N1} \approx$ 1.8 K. Powder neutron
diffraction measurements reveal a chiral magnetic structure with a single
propagation vector $Q_m = (1/2,1/2,0.228(5))$, indicating an antiferromagnetic
arrangement of Ce magnetic moments in the $ab$-plane and incommensurate order
along the $c$-axis with a root-mean-square ordered moment of $m_\textrm{ord}$=
0.68 $\mu_\textrm{B}$/Ce. Applying a magnetic field suppresses the N\'{e}el
temperature $T_\textrm{N1}$ to zero near $\mu_0H_\textrm{c1}\sim$0.75 T. A
second antiferromagnetic phase ($T_\textrm{N2}$), however, becomes apparent in
electrical resistivity, Hall and heat capacity measurements in fields above 0.5
T and extrapolates to zero temperature at $\mu_0H_\textrm{c2}\sim$ 1 T.
Electrical resistivity measurements reveal that LaRhC$_2$ is a semiconductor
with a bandgap of $E_\textrm{g}\sim24$ meV; whereas, resistivity and Hall
measurements indicate that CeRhC$_2$ is a semimetal with a low carrier
concentration of $n\sim10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$. With applied hydrostatic pressure,
the zero-field antiferromagnetic transition of CeRhC$_2$ is slightly enhanced
and CeRhC$_2$ becomes notably more metallic up to 1.36 GPa. The trend toward
metallicity is in line with density-functional calculations that indicate that
both LaRhC$_2$ and CeRhC$_2$ are semimetals, but the band overlap is larger for
CeRhC$_2$, which has a smaller unit cell volume that its La counterpart. This
suggests that the bandgap closes due to a lattice contraction when replacing La
with Ce in RRhC$_2$ (R = rare-earth), in agreement with experimental results.

In this paper we investigate the emergence of a laboratory glass transition
in two different physical systems: a uniformly heated granular gas and a
molecular fluid with non-linear drag. Despite the profound differences between
the two systems, their behaviour in thermal cycles share strong similarities.
When the driving intensity -- for the granular gas -- or the bath temperature
-- for the molecular fluid -- is decreased to sufficiently low values, the
kinetic temperature of both systems becomes ``frozen" at a value that depends
on the cooling rate through a power law with the same exponent. Interestingly,
this frozen glassy state is universal in the following sense: for a suitable
rescaling of the relevant variables, its velocity distribution function becomes
independent of the cooling rate. Upon reheating, i.e. when either the driving
intensity or the bath temperature is increased from this frozen state,
hysteresis cycles arise and the apparent heat capacity displays a maximum. We
develop a boundary layer perturbative theory that accurately explains the
behaviour observed in the numerical simulations.

particles rearrangements enabling the system to transition between these
meta-stable states. A dramatic consequence of these transitions is that
quasistatic deformation cycles modify the reference state, facilitating the
storage and release of mechanical energy. Here we develop a continuum theory
that generalizes classical elasticity by accounting both for the absence of
reference state, and the lack of conserved potential energy. Our theory
includes a new modulus describing non-conservative mechanical screening. We
derive predictions in closed analytic form for the deformation field for
various perturbations and geometries. While our theory applies to general
disordered solids, we focus on a two-dimensional disordered granular system and
predict accurately the non-affine displacement fields observed in experiments
for both small and large deformations. The new proposed moduli satisfy
universal relations that are independent of the specific experimental
realization. Our work thus forms the basis of an entirely new family of
continuum descriptions of the mechanics of disordered solids.

We investigate how topological Chern numbers can be defined when
single-particle states hybridize with continua. We do so exemplarily in a
bosonic Haldane model at zero temperature modified by an additional on-site
decay of one boson into two and the conjugate fusion of two bosons into one.
Restricting the Hilbert space to two bosons at maximum, the exact self-energy
is accessible. We use the bilinear Hamiltonian $H_0$ corrected by the
self-energy $\Sigma$ to compute Chern numbers by two different approaches. The
results are gauged against a full many-body calculation in the restricted
Hilbert space. We find evidence that the effective Hamiltonian $H_0(\vec k)
+\Sigma(\omega,\vec k)$ reproduces the correct many-body topology even if the
considered band overlaps with the continuum. However, in the latter case the
bulk-boundary correspondence appears to be no longer valid and the edge modes
delocalize.

Devices for performing computation and logic operations with low-energy
consumption are of key importance for environmentally friendly data-processing
and information technology. Here, we present a design for magnetic elements
that use excess heat to perform logic operations. The basic information channel
is coupled non-conductive magnetic stripes with a normal metal spacer. The
thermal information signal is embodied in magnetic excitations and it can be
transported, locally enhanced, and controllably steered by virtue of charge
current pulses in the spacer. Functionality of essential thermal logic gates is
demonstrated by material-specific simulations. The operation principle takes
advantage of the special material architecture with a balanced gain/loss
mechanism for magnetic excitation which renders the circuit parity-time
symmetric with exceptional points tunable by the current strength in the
spacer. Heat flow at these points can be enhanced, be non-reciprocal, or may
oscillate between the information channels enabling so controlled thermal diode
and thermal gate operations. The findings point to a new route for exploiting
heat for useful work on the nanoscale.

$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ is a semiconductor with bandgap in the deep-UV ~ 5 eV.
Due to its strong phonon-hole coupling, holes are self-trapped inhibiting
bandgap luminescence at the deep-UV. In contrast, the self-trapped holes (STH)
can exhibit a strong luminescence at ~ 3.5 eV. This research addresses the
thermal response of the STH photoluminescence (PL), and the role of phonon
interactions at temperatures 77 K - 622 K in nanocrystalline films. It was
found that the PL intensity strongly diminishes as a function of increasing
temperature with activation energy ~ 72 meV. A study of the Raman modes
revealed that the intensity of the high frequency modes of the Ga$_I$O$_4$ site
decrease with temperature, implying a phonon annihilation process. These modes,
which have comparable energy to the STH activation energy, thus can couple to
the STH and transition them from a radiative to a non-radiative regime in
accordance with the configurational coordinate model at the strong phonon
coupling limit. The significantly broad Gaussian linewidth of the PL is also a
manifestation of a strong STH-phonon coupling. Furthermore, the peak position
of the STH exhibited a negligible temperature response, in contrast to the
redshift of ~ 220 meV of the bandedge of the film. In contrast to the intensity
behavior of the high frequency Raman modes, the low frequency ones were found
to follow the thermal Bose-Einstein phonon population.

Homogeneous suspensions of red blood cells (RBCs or erythrocytes) in blood
plasma are unstable in the absence of driving forces and form elongated stacks,
called rouleau. These erythrocyte aggregates are often branched porous networks
-- a feature that existing red blood cell aggregation models and simulations
fail to predict exactly. Here we establish that alignment-dependent attractive
forces in a system of dimers can precisely generate branched structures similar
to RBC aggregates observed under a microscope. Our simulations consistently
predict that the growth rate of typical mean rouleau size remains sub-linear --
a hallmark from past studies -- which we also confirm by deriving a reaction
kernel taking into account appropriate collision cross-section, approach
velocities, and an area-dependent sticking probability. The system exhibits
unique features such as the existence of percolated and/or single giant cluster
states, multiple coexisting mass-size scalings, and transition to a branched
phase upon fine-tuning of model parameters. Upon decreasing the depletion
thickness we find that the percolation threshold increases and the morphology
of the structures opens up towards an increased degree of branching. Remarkably
the system self-organizes to produce a universal power-law size distribution
scaling irrespective of the model parameters.

Nonlinear transport enabled by symmetry breaking in quantum materials has
aroused considerable interests in condensed matter physics and
interdisciplinary electronics. However, the nonlinear optical response in
centrosymmetric Dirac semimetals via the defect engineering has remained
extremely challenging. Here, we observe the helicity-dependent terahertz (THz)
emission in Dirac semimetal PtTe2 thin films via circular photogalvanic effect
(CPGE) under normal incidence. This is activated by artificially controllable
Te-vacancy defect gradient, which is unambiguously evidenced by the electron
ptychography. The defect gradient lowers the symmetry, which not only induces
the band spin splitting, but also generates the Berry curvature dipole (BCD)
responsible for the CPGE. Such BCD-induced helicity-dependent THz emission can
be manipulated by the Te-vacancy defect concentration. Furthermore, temperature
evolution of the THz emission features the minimum of the THz amplitude due to
the carrier compensation. Our work provides a universal strategy for symmetry
breaking in centrosymmetric Dirac materials for nonlinear transport and
facilitates the promising device applications in integrated optoelectronics and
spintronics.

<h3>Variations of Interatomic Force Constants in the Topological Phonon  Phase Transition of AlGaN</h3>

The topological effects of phonons have been extensively studied in various
materials, particularly in the wide-bandgap semiconductor GaN, which has the
potential to improve heat dissipation in power electronics due to its
intrinsic, topologically-protected, non-dissipative phonon surface states.
Nevertheless, the phase transition of the Weyl phonons in nitrides and their
composite alloys has yet to be elucidated. To unveil the microscale origin,
topological phonon properties in AlGaN alloys are investigated using the
virtual crystal approximation (VCA) and special quasi-random structure (SQS)
approaches in this work. It is found that phase transitions in Weyl phonons are
evidently present in AlGaN alloys and nitride single crystals. Under strain
states, both GaN and AlN show a more prominent phase transition of Weyl phonons
when subjected to biaxial compressive and uniaxial tensile strains. And it has
been observed that the zz components in the self-term and the transverse 1NN
force constants (FCs) are the most influential during the phase transition. The
nonlinear Weyl phonon transition in AlGaN alloys, as modeled by the VCA, is
reflected in the normalized self-term and first-nearest-neighbor (1NN) FCs,
which vary in a nonlinear fashion with an increasing magnitude. This nonlinear
phenomenon is also confirmed in the SQS modeling, where the unfolded phonon
dispersions are consistent with those in the VCA modeling. With increased
branches, hundreds of Weyl phonons are present accompanied by significant
disorders in normalized FCs, which mainly occur for N atoms in self-terms and
for all components in normalized 1NN FCs.

Ternary nitride ZnSnN$_2$ is a promising photovoltaic absorber material. In
this work, using first-principles calculations, we investigate the stability
and electronic properties of "4-8"-type ZnSnN$_2$ thin films. We find that
below a certain thickness "4-8"-type thin films have lower total energy than
polar films. For 4-layer ZnSnN$_2$ thin film, the Pna2$_1$/Pmc2$_1$
$\rightarrow$ 4-8 transition can spontaneously occur at finite temperatures.
All "4-8"-type thin films studied are semiconducting and free of spontaneous
polarization, the bandgaps of which can be tuned by the thickness of films,
ranging from 1.4 eV to 1.8 eV. Furthermore, these films show light electron
effective masses, and octet-rule-preserving disorder has insignificant effects
on the electronic properties. Our results provide new insights into the
structure of ZnSnN$_2$ in the thin film form and guidance for the experimental
investigation.

We demonstrate a fiber-type optomechanical array consisting of elastically
interconnected silica microbottle resonators with high-Q optical and mechanical
modes. In total, fifty optomechanical resonators fabricated by fine glass
processing are uniformly arrayed on a silica fiber. Evanescent coupling of a
tapered optical fiber to an arbitrary resonator allows for highly sensitive
readout and efficient actuation of mechanical motion at an arbitrary position
in the array. Phonon propagation through the fifty microbottles is achieved by
both linearly and parametrically driving a mechanical mode at one end and by
detecting it at the other end. This optomechanical array is scalable, tunable,
and lithography-free and can be extended to fiber-based sensory applications
with structural flexibility and operability in various environments.

The two-dimensional (2D) spin-1/2 kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet is
believed to host quantum spin liquid (QSL) states with no magnetic order, but
its ground state remains largely elusive. An important outstanding question
concerns the presence or absence of the 1/9 magnetization plateau, where exotic
quantum states, including topological ones, are expected to emerge. Here we
report the magnetization of a recently discovered kagome QSL candidate
YCu$_3$(OH)$_{6.5}$Br$_{2.5}$ up to 57 T. Above 50 T, a clear magnetization
plateau at 1/3 of the saturation moment of Cu$^{2+}$ ions is observed,
supporting that this material provides an ideal platform for the kagome
Heisenberg antiferromagnet. Remarkably, we found another magnetization plateau
around 20 T, which is attributed to the 1/9 plateau. The temperature dependence
of this plateau reveals the distinct spin gap, whose magnitude estimated by the
plateau width is approximately 10% of the exchange interaction. The observation
of 1/9 and 1/3 plateaus highlights the emergence of novel states in quantum
spin systems.

Many large-scale phenomena in our Universe, such as gravitational waves, are
challenging to reproduce in laboratory settings. However, parallels with
condensed matter systems can provide alternative routes for experimental
accessibility. Here we show how spin nematic phases provide a low-energy avenue
for accessing the physics of linearized gravity, and in particular that their
Goldstone modes are relativistically-dispersing massless spin-2 excitations,
analogous to gravitational waves. We show at the level of the action that the
low-energy effective field theory describing a spin nematic is in
correspondence with that of linearized gravity. We then explicitly identify a
microscopic model of a spin-1 magnet whose excitations in the low energy limit
are relativistically dispersing, massless spin-2 Bosons which are in one-to-one
correspondence with gravitational waves and, supported by simulation, outline a
procedure for directly observing these analogue waves in a cold gas of
$^{23}$Na atoms.

The investigation of the processes of mineral deposit formation and their
history is a fundamental task. Solving this task can increase mining efficiency
and make a significant contribution to understanding the formation of the
Earth's crust. The main approach to solving this task is determining the values
of thermodynamic functions for phases present in deposits. One of the most
promising and flexible methods for studying thermodynamic properties is the EMF
method. This article describes the basic principles of the EMF method and
provides all possible interpretations of the obtained results. It has also been
demonstrated that direct EMF measurements can determine the composition of a
solid solution or alloy in a multicomponent system if its EMF dependencies are
known. Based on this fact, it can be concluded that any alloy or solid solution
in a multi-phase association, which undergoes composition changes with
temperature and can be quenched, can be used as a geothermometer or
geobarometer.

<br>
Interfaces between a water droplet and a network of pillars produce
eventually superhydrophobic, self-cleaning properties. Considering the surface
fraction of the surface in interaction with water, it is possible to tune
precisely the contact angle hysteresis (CAH) to low values, which is at the
origin of the poor adhesion of water droplets, inducing their high mobility on
such a surface. However, if one wants to move and position a droplet, the lower
the CAH, the less precise will be the positioning on the surface. While rigid
surfaces limit the possibilities of actuation, smart surfaces have been devised
with which a stimulus can be used to trigger the displacement of a droplet.
Light, electron beam, mechanical stimulation like vibration, or magnetism can
be used to induce a displacement of droplets on surfaces and transfer them from
one position to the targeted one. Among these methods, only few are reversible,
leading to anisotropy-controlled orientation of the structured interface with
water. Magnetically driven superhydrophobic surfaces are the most promising
reprogramming surfaces that can lead to the control of wettability and droplet
guidance.

We present a table-top setup for femtosecond time-resolved X-ray diffraction
based on a Cu K{\alpha} (8.05 keV) laser driven plasma X-ray source. Due to its
modular design it provides high accessibility to its individual components
(e.g. X-ray optics and sample environment). The K{\alpha}-yield of the source
is optimized using a pre-pulse scheme. A magnifying multilayer X-ray mirror
with Montel-Helios geometry is used to collect the emitted radiation, resulting
in a quasi-collimated flux of more than 105 Cu K{\alpha} photons/pulse
impinging on the sample under investigation at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. A
gas ionization chamber detector is placed right after the X-ray mirror and used
for normalization of the diffraction signals enabling the measurement of
relative signal changes of less than 1% even at the given low repetition rate.
Time-resolved diffraction experiments on laser-excited epitaxial Bi films serve
as an example to demonstrate the capabilities of the set-up. The set-up can
also be used for Debye-Scherrer type measurements on poly-crystalline samples.

Ferroelastic twin walls in nonpolar materials can give rise to a spontaneous
polarization due to symmetry breaking. Nevertheless, the bi-stable polarity of
twin walls and its reversal have not yet been demonstrated. Here, we report
that the polarity of SrTiO$_3$ twin walls can be switched by ultra-low strain
gradient. Using first-principles-based machine-learning potential, we
demonstrate that the twin walls can be deterministically rotated and realigned
in specific directions under strain gradient, which breaks the inversion
symmetry of a sequence of walls and leads to a macroscopic polarization. The
system can maintain polarity even after the strain gradient is removed. As a
result, the polarization of twin walls can exhibit ferroelectric-like
hysteresis loop upon cyclic bending, namely ferro-flexoelectricity. Finally, we
propose a scheme to experimentally detect the polarity of twin wall by
measuring the bulk photovoltaic responses. Our findings suggest a
twin-wall-mediated ferro-flexoelectricity in SrTiO$_3$, which could be
potentially exploited as functional elements in nano-electronic devices design.

We investigate the staggered correlation of the on-site pairs, the so-called
$\eta$-pairing correlation, induced by pump electric fields in the Hubbard
model on the ladder lattice. Employing the time-evolution method based on exact
diagonalization, we compute the photoinduced $\eta$-pairing correlation with
different strengths of the interchain hopping. When the pump field is polarized
along the chain direction, the $\eta$-pairing correlation is noticeably induced
in the weakly coupled double-chain region, where the pairing property is
similar to the $\eta$-pairing in the single-chain Hubbard model. On the other
hand, the pump field polarized along the rung direction prominently induces the
$\eta$-pairing correlation in the strong interchain coupling regime, where the
pair correlations developing across rungs strongly contribute to the
$\eta$-pairing. Based on the local rung approximation, which is valid in the
strong interchain coupling regime, we discuss the origin of the photoinduced
pair.

elucidated through Raman spectroscopy. Temperature-dependent resistivity of
Mn$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ resulted in metallic behaviour of the same with an up-turn
at below around 20K. Further, the magneto-transport R(T) vs H of the same
exhibited negative magneto-resistance (MR) at low temperatures below 20K and
small positive at higher temperatures. The low Temperature -ve MR starts
decreasing at higher fields. The magnetic moment as a function of temperature
at 100Oe and 1kOe showed AFM like down turn cusps at around 20K and 10K. The
isothermal magnetization (MH) showed AFM like loops with some embedded FM/PM
domains at 5K and purely paramagnetic (PM) like at 100K. The studied

The current-dipole conductivity formula for doped three-dimensional Dirac
semimetals is derived by using a modified gauge-invariant tight-binding
approach. In a heavily doped regime, the effective number of charge carriers
$n_{\alpha \alpha}^{\rm eff}$ in the Drude contribution is found to be by a
factor of 4 larger than the nominal electron concentration $n$. However, its
structure is the same as in standard Fermi liquid theory. In a lightly doped
regime, on the other hand, the ratio $n_{\alpha \alpha}^{\rm eff}/n$ is much
larger, with much more complex structure of $n_{\alpha \alpha}^{\rm eff}$. It
is shown that the dc resistivity and reflectivity date measured in two TlBiSSe
samples can be easily understood, even in the relaxation-time approximation,
provided that finite quasiparticle lifetime effects in the momentum
distribution functions are properly taken into account.

The metal-insulator transition (MIT) in vanadium dioxide VO$_2$ due to V-V
dimerization has been extensively discussed for decades. While it is widely
acknowledged that electron correlations, Peierls instabilities, and molecular
orbital formations are crucial for understanding the MIT of VO$_2$, the primary
origin of the MIT remains controversial. In this study, we delve into the
crystal structure and orbital state of VO$_2$ through synchrotron x-ray
diffraction experiments. The molecular orbital formation corresponding to the
V-V dimerization is directly observed in the low-temperature insulating
monoclinic phase, called the M1 phase, as indicated by the valence electron
density distribution. Moreover, diffuse scattering observed in the
high-temperature metal phase of rutile structure suggests the presence of
short-range correlation of V displacements, which is not directly attributed to
the structural fluctuation of the M1 phase. The short-range order in the rutile
phase will be the key to understanding the MIT in this system.

A transverse thermoelectric generator for magnetic-field-free and

constructed and its performance is characterized. By alternately stacking two
different permanent magnets with the large coercivity and anomalous Nernst
coefficients of opposite sign, transverse thermoelectric voltage and power can
be generated in the absence of external magnetic fields and enhanced owing to a
thermopile structure without useless electrode layers. In the
permanent-magnet-based stack, the magnetic attractive force enables easy
construction of the thermopile structure with a high fill factor. In this

and negative anomalous Nernst coefficients, whose fill factor reaches ~80%,
whereas that of conventional thermoelectric modules based on the Seebeck effect
is typically 30-60%. We demonstrate magnetic-field-free anomalous Nernst power
generation up to 177 $\mu$W at a temperature difference of 75 K around room
temperature, which corresponds to the largest anomalous Nernst power density of
65 $\mu$W/cm$^2$. The presented module structure concept will provide a design
guideline for high-performance transverse thermoelectric power generation.

We report quantum Monte Carlo results of harmonically confined quantum Bose
dipoles within a range of interactions covering the evolution from a gas phase
to the formation of an array of droplets. Scaling the experimental setup to a
computationally accessible domain we characterize that evolution in qualitative
agreement with experiments. Our microscopic approach generates ground-state
results free from approximations, albeit with some controlled statistical
noise. The simultaneous estimation of the static structure factor and the
one-body density matrix allows for a better knowledge of the quantum coherence
between droplets. Our results show a narrow window of interaction strengths
where diagonal and off-diagonal long-range order can coexist. This domain,
which is the key signal of a supersolid state, is reduced with respect to the
one predicted by the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Differences are
probably due to an increase of attraction in our model, observed previously in
the calculation of critical atom numbers for single dipolar drops.

We determine the phase diagrams of anisotropic Kitaev-Heisenberg models on
the honeycomb lattice using parton mean-field theories based on different
Majorana fermion representations of the $S=1/2$ spin operators. Firstly, we use
a two-dimensional Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT) involving a semi-infinite
snake string operator. In order to ensure that the fermionized Hamiltonian
remains local we consider the limit of extreme Ising exchange anisotropy in the
Heisenberg sector. Secondly, we use the conventional Kitaev representation in
terms of four Majorana fermions subject to local constraints, which we enforce
through Lagrange multipliers. For both representations we self-consistently
decouple the interaction terms in the bond and magnetization channels and
determine the phase diagrams as a function of the anisotropy of the Kitaev
couplings and the relative strength of the Ising exchange. While both
mean-field theories produce identical phase boundaries for the topological
phase transition between the gapless and gapped Kitaev quantum spin liquids,
the JWT fails to correctly describe the the magnetic instability and
finite-temperature behavior. Our results show that the magnetic phase
transition is first order at low temperatures but becomes continuous above a
certain temperature.

Functional materials such as magnetic, thermoelectric, and battery materials
have been revolutionized through nanostructure engineering. However, spin
caloritronics, an advancing field based on spintronics and thermoelectrics with
fundamental physics studies, has focused only on uniform materials without
complex microstructures. Here, we show how nanostructure engineering enables
transforming simple magnetic alloys into spin-caloritronic materials displaying
significantly large transverse thermoelectric conversion properties. The
anomalous Nernst effect (ANE), a promising transverse thermoelectric phenomenon
for energy harvesting and heat sensing, has been challenging to utilize due to
the scarcity of materials with large anomalous Nernst coefficients. We
demonstrate a remarkable improvement in the anomalous Nernst coefficients in
flexible Fe-based amorphous materials through nanostructural engineering,
without altering their composition. This surpasses all reported amorphous
alloys and is comparable to single crystals showing large ANE. The enhancement
is attributed to Cu nano-clustering, facilitating efficient transverse
thermoelectric conversion. This discovery advances the materials science of
spin caloritronics, opening new avenues for designing high-performance
transverse thermoelectric devices for practical applications.

Recently, an extremely-air-stable one-dimensional 7-9-7-AGNR was successfully
fabricated. To further reveal its potential application in sub-5-nm
field-effect transistors (FETs), there is an urgent need to develop integrated
circuits. Here, we report first-principles quantum-transport simulations on the
performance limits of n- and p-type sub-5-nm one-dimensional 7-9-7-AGNR FET. We
find that the on-state current (Ion) in 7-9-7-AGNR FET can be effectively
manipulated by the length of the gate and underlap. Particularly, the optimized
Ion in n-type (p-type) device can reach up to 2423 (4277) and 1988 (920)
{\mu}A/{\mu}m for high-performance and low-power applications, respectively.
The large Ion values are in the first class among the LD FETs, which can well
satisfy the ITRS requirements. We also find that the 7-9-7-AGNR FET can have
ultralow subthreshold swing below 60mV/dev, ultrashort delay time (<0.01 ps),
and very small power-delay product (<0.01 fJ/{\mu}m). Our results show that the
7-9-7-AGNR based FETs have great potential applications in the high-speed and
low-power consumption chips.

In the cuprates, the opening of a d-wave superconducting (SC) gap is
accompanied by a redistribution of spectral weight at energies two orders of
magnitude larger than this gap. This indicates the importance to the pairing
mechanism of on-site electronic excitations, such as orbital transitions or
charge transfer excitations. Here, we resort to a three-pulse pump-probe scheme
to study the broadband non-equilibrium dielectric function in optimally-doped
$Bi_2Sr_2Ca_{0.92}Y_{0.08}Cu_2O_{8+{\delta}}$ and we identify two distinct
dynamical responses: i) a blueshift of the central energy of an interband
excitation peaked at 2 eV and ii) a change in spectral weight in the same
energy range. Photoexcitation with near-IR and mid-IR pulses, with photon
energies respectively above and below the SC gap, reveals that the transient
changes in the central energy are not modified by the onset of
superconductivity and do not depend on the pump photon energy. Conversely, the
spectral weight dynamics strongly depends on the pump photon energy and has a
discontinuity at the critical temperature. The picture that emerges is that,
while high-energy pulses excite quasiparticles in both nodal and thermally
inaccessible antinodal states, photoexcitation by low-energy pulses mostly
accelerates the condensate and creates excitations predominantly at the nodes
of the SC gap. These results, rationalized by kinetic equations for d-wave
superconducting gaps, indicate that dynamical control of the momentum-dependent
distribution of non-thermal quasiparticles may be achieved by the selective
tuning of the photoexcitation.

Existence of nontrivial topological phases in a tight binding Haldane-like
model on the depleted Lieb lattice is reported. This two-band model is
formulated by considering the nearest-neighbor, next-nearest-neighbor and
next-next-nearest-neighbor hopping terms along with complex phase which breaks
the time reversal symmetry of this semi-metallic system. Topological feature of
this model is studied along with the presence of sublattice symmetry breaking
staggered onsite energy. Combined effect of these two broken symmetries is
found crucial for an additional transition between nontrivial and trivial
phases. System exhibits two types of phase transitions, say, between two
nontrivial phases and nontrivial to trivial phases. Nonzero Chern numbers,
existence of Hall plateau and symmetry protected edge states confirm the
presence of the nontrivial phases. This two-band system hosts four different
types of phases where two are topological. Additionally topological properties
of stacked bilayer of the depleted Lieb lattices is also studied with similar
Haldane-like Hamiltonian. This four-band system is found to host Chern
insulating phases, with higher values of Chern numbers supported by in-gap edge
states.

We present a theory of the realization of a ferromagnetic Haldane state in a
spin-2 bilinear-biquadratic spin system on an orthogonal-dimer chain. The
coexistence of a ferromagnetic state and a Haldane state is due to the rigorous
correspondence between the eigenstates of a spin-2 model and a spin-1/2
Heisenberg model; i.e., "eigensystem embedding." Numerical
exact-diagonalization calculations indicate that the ground state in the model
is a fractionally magnetized M = 3/4 Haldane state. Moreover, a
ferromagnetic-dimer multiplet state is an exact ground state on a lattice,
where the direct product of dimer singlet states is the ground state in a
spin-1/2 Heisenberg model that includes one-, two-, and three-dimensional
orthogonal-dimer lattices. Eigensystem embedding demonstrates that a quantum
ferromagnet can be obtained for an arbitrary spin S >= 2 in any dimension and
for any lattice in which anomalous ground states are realized in a spin-1/2
Heisenberg model.

Utilizing ultrafast light-matter interaction to manipulate electronic states
of quantum materials is an emerging area of research in condensed matter
physics. It has significant implications for the development of ultrafast
electronic devices of the future. However, the ability to induce long-lasting
metastable electronic states yet in a fully reversible manner is a long
standing challenge. Here, by using ultrafast laser excitation with distinct
pulse sequences and fluences, we were able to regulate the symmetry and
electronic properties in a polar charge-density-wave material EuTe4. We
demonstrated the capability of nonvolatile writing and erasing the polar order,
a process that is completely reversible and is achieved at room temperature in
an all optical manner. Each induced state brings about modifications to the
electric resistance and second harmonic generation intensity. The results point
to a distinct dynamical symmetry inversion mechanism in which photoexcitation
mediates the polar phases of long-range electronic order. Our finding extends
the scope of nonvolatile all-optical control of electronic states to ambient
conditions, thus providing possibilities for applications in ultrafast
optoelectronics.

<h3>Tunneling density of states of fractional quantum Hall edges: an  unconventional bosonization approach</h3>

An unconventional bosonization approach that employs a modified Fermi-Bose
correspondence is used to obtain the tunneling density of states (TDOS) of
fractional quantum Hall (FQHE) edges in the vicinity of a point contact. The
chiral Luttinger liquid model is generally used to describe FQHE edge
excitations. We introduce a bosonization procedure to study edge state
transport in Laughlin states at filling $\nu = 1/m$ with $m$ odd (single edge
mode) in the presence of a point contact constriction that brings the top and
bottom edges of the sample into close proximity. The unconventional
bosonization involves modifying the Fermi-Bose correspondence to incorporate
backscattering at the point contact, leaving the action of the theory purely
quadratic even in presence of the inhomogeneity. We have shown convincingly in
earlier works that this procedure correctly reproduces the most singular parts
of the Green functions of the system even when mutual forward scattering
between fermions are included. The most singular part of the density-density
correlation function (DDCF) relevant to TDOS calculation is computed using a
generating functional approach. The TDOS for both the electron tunneling as
well as the Laughlin quasiparticle tunneling cases is obtained and is found to
agree with previous results in the literature. For electron tunneling the
well-known universal power laws for TDOS viz. $ \sim \mbox{ }\omega^{ m-1 }$
and for quasi-particle tunneling the power law $ \sim \mbox{ } \omega^{
\frac{1}{m}-1 } $ are both correctly recovered using our unconventional
bosonization scheme. This demonstrates convincingly the utility of the present
method which unlike conventional approaches, does not treat the point-contact
as an afterthought and yet remains solvable so long as only the most singular
parts of the correlation functions are desired.

<br>
In ferromagnet/superconductor bilayer systems, dipolar fields from the
ferromagnet can create asymmetric energy barriers for the formation and
dynamics of vortices through flux pinning. Conversely, the flux emanating from
vortices can pin the domain walls of the ferromagnet, thereby creating
asymmetric critical currents. Here, we report the observation of a
superconducting diode effect in a NbSe$_2$/CrGeTe$_3$ van der Waals
heterostructure in which the magnetic domains of CrGeTe$_3$ control the
Abrikosov vortex dynamics in NbSe$_2$. In addition to extrinsic vortex pinning
mechanisms at the edges of NbSe$_2$, flux-pinning-induced bulk pinning of
vortices can alter the critical current. This asymmetry can thus be explained
by considering the combined effect of this bulk pinning mechanism along with
the vortex tilting induced by the Lorentz force from the transport current in
the NbSe$_2$/CrGeTe$_3$ heterostructure. We also provide evidence of critical
current modulation by flux pinning depending on the history of the field
setting procedure. Our results suggest a method of controlling the efficiency
of the superconducting diode effect in magnetically coupled van der Waals
superconductors, where dipolar fields generated by the magnetic layer can be
used to modulate the dynamics of the superconducting vortices in the
superconductors.

This study introduces silicon substrates with a switchable magnetic contrast
layer (MCL) for polarised neutron reflectometry experiments (PNR) at
solid/liquid interface to study soft matter surface layers. The advantage with
neutron reflectometry (NR) data is that structural and compositional
information can be enhanced by using different isotopic contrast on the same
sample. This approach is normally referred to as contrast matching, which can
be achieved by using solvents with different isotopic contrast, e. g. different
H2O/D2O ratio, and/or by selective deuteration of the molecules. However, some
soft matter system might be perturbed by this approach, or it might not be
possible, particularly for biological samples. In this scenario, solid
substrates with a MCL are an appealing alternative, as the magnetic contrast
with the substrate can be used to partially recover the information on the
sample structure. More specifically, in this study, a magnetically soft Fe
layer coated with SiO2 was produced by ion-beam sputter deposition on silicon
substrates of different sizes. The structure was evaluated using XRR, AFM, VSM,
and PNR. The collected data showed high quality and repeatability of the MCL
parameters, regardless of the substrate size and thickness of the capping SiO2
layers. As compared to other kinds of substrates with MCL layer previously
proposed, which used Au capping layer, the SiO2 capping layer allows to
reproduce the typical surface of standard silicon substrate used for NR
experiment and compatible with a large variety of soft matter samples. We
demonstrated such application, by using ready-to-measure 50*50*10 mm3
substrates in PNR experiments for the characterisation of a lipid bilayer in a
single solvent contrast. Overall, the article highlights the potential of PNR
with MCL for investigation of soft matter samples.

<h3>Axionic Instability of Periodic Weyl-Semimetal Superstructures</h3>

Weyl-semimetal superstructures with a spiraling position of a pair of Weyl
nodes of opposite chirality can host a chiral-symmetry preserving Fermi-arc
metal state, where the chirality is carried by cylindrical Fermi surfaces,
electron- and hole-like depending on the chirality. The Fermi surfaces nest at
vanishing momentum separation (zero nesting vector) at the
electron-hole-compensation energy because the nesting is topologically
protected by vanishing spatial overlap of any pair of equal-momentum
opposite-chirality states. In this work we show that the nesting and Coulomb
interaction drive a spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in such a Fermi arc
metal, which leads to a dynamical axion insulator state but without breaking
translational symmetry (no charge-density-wave order) as in a conventional Weyl
semimetal. As for material realization, we discuss magnetically doped
Bi$_2$Se$_3$, for which the Weyl-node positions depend on the order of the
magnetic dopands. In this case, the axionic condensation can itself stabilize a
spiral order of the magnetization, and hence the spiraling node positions, even
if the magnetic interaction is intrinsically ferromagnetic.

<h3>A mono-atomic orbital-based 1D topological crystalline insulator</h3>

<br>
<br>
Topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) are classified by topological
invariants defined with respect to the crystalline symmetries of their gapped
bulk. The bulk-boundary correspondence then links the topological properties of
the bulk to robust observables on the edges, e.g., the existence of robust edge
modes or fractional charge. In one dimension, TCIs protected by reflection
symmetry have been realized in a variety of systems where each unit cell has
spatially distributed degrees of freedom (SDoF). However, these realizations of
TCIs face practical challenges stemming from the sensitivity of the resulting
edge modes to variations in edge termination and to the local breaking of the
protective spatial symmetries by inhomogeneity. Here we demonstrate
topologically protected edge states in a mono-atomic, orbital-based TCI that
mitigates both of these issues. By collapsing all SDoF within the unit cell to
a singular point in space, we eliminate the ambiguity in unit cell definition
and hence remove a prominent source of boundary termination variability. The
topological observables are also more tolerant to disorder in the orbital
energies. To validate this concept, we experimentally realize a lattice of
mechanical resonators where each resonator acts as an "atom" that harbors two
key orbital degrees of freedom having opposite reflection parity. Our
measurements of this system provide direct visualization of the
$sp$-hybridization between orbital modes that leads to a non-trivial band
inversion in the bulk. Furthermore, as the spatial width of the resonators is
tuned, one can drive a transition between a topological and trivial phase. In
the future we expect our approach can be extended to realize orbital-based
obstructed atomic insulators and TCIs in higher dimensions.

<h3>Multiplicative noise induced bistability and stochastic resonance</h3>

Stochastic resonance is a well established phenomenon, which proves relevant
for a wide range of applications, of broad trans-disciplinary breath. Consider
a one dimensional bistable stochastic system, characterized by a deterministic
double well potential and shaken by an additive noise source. When subject to
an external periodic drive, and for a proper choice of the noise strength, the
system swings regularly between the two existing deterministic fixed points,
with just one switch for each oscillation of the imposed forcing term. This
resonant condition can be exploited to unravel weak periodic signals, otherwise
inaccessible to conventional detectors. Here, we will set to revisit the
stochastic resonance concept by operating in a modified framework where
bistability is induced by the nonlinear nature of the multiplicative noise. A
candidate model is in particular introduced which fulfils the above
requirements while allowing for analytical progress to be made. Working with
reference to this case study, we elaborate on the conditions for the onset of
the generalized stochastic resonance mechanism. As a byproduct of the analysis,
a novel resonant regime is also identified which displays no lower bound for
the frequencies that can be resolved, at variance with the traditional setting.

As the size and ubiquity of artificial intelligence and computational machine
learning (ML) models grow, their energy consumption for training and use is
rapidly becoming economically and environmentally unsustainable. Neuromorphic
computing, or the implementation of ML in hardware, has the potential to reduce
this cost. In particular, recent laboratory prototypes of self-learning
electronic circuits, examples of ``physical learning machines," open the door
to analog hardware that directly employs physics to learn desired functions
from examples. In this work, we show that this hardware platform allows for
even further reduction of energy consumption by using good initial conditions
as well as a new learning algorithm. Using analytical calculations, simulation
and experiment, we show that a trade-off emerges when learning dynamics attempt
to minimize both the error and the power consumption of the solution--greater
power reductions can be achieved at the cost of decreasing solution accuracy.
Finally, we demonstrate a practical procedure to weigh the relative importance
of error and power minimization, improving power efficiency given a specific
tolerance to error.

Three-terminal phonon-thermoelectric devices have the potential to operate as
heat engines, converting absorbed heat from one terminal into useful output
work. This study explores one periodic driven quantum-dot thermoelectric heat
engine within the framework of quantum master equations with full counting
statistics, and discusses the impact of quantum coherence on the thermodynamic
performance of heat engines. By applying external modulations, we not only
observe the dynamic current induced by thermodynamic bias but also uncover a
Berry-phase-like current with adiabatic geometric pump. It is found that heat
absorption and inelastic thermoelectric currents can be enhanced by quantum
coherence effect. In particular, this geometric effect proves crucial in
achieving maximal values of generated output work and energy conversion
efficiency, especially in moderate coupling regimes. The Berry curvature
boosted by quantum coherence unveils the underlying mechanism of quantum heat
engines. Our findings demonstrate that heat engines including quantum coherence
outperform their incoherent counterparts by enhancing both generated average
output work and efficiency.

We study the Hall constant in a homogeneous two-dimensional fluid of
correlated electrons immersed in a perpendicular magnetic field, with special
focus on the regime of low carrier density. The model consists of a one-band
tight-binding model and a momentum-independent causal self-energy, representing
interaction-induced correlations effects that are restricted to be local in
space. We write general gauge-invariant equations for the conductivity tensor
at first order in the magnetic field and solve them numerically (analytically
when possible) in a minimal model of anisotropic square lattice with constant
self-energy. Our results show that deviations from the universal behavior of
the Hall constant, as observed in the semiclassical regime, appear upon
entering the quantum regime, where the Fermi energy and interaction are
comparable energy scales.

<br>
<br>
An experimental study of Landau levels (LLs) in a system of two-dimensional
massless Dirac fermions based on a critical thickness HgTe quantum well has
been carried out. The magnetotransport and the capacitive response have been
investigated simultaneously. It is shown that the formation of Shubnikov-de
Haas (SdH) oscillations associated with odd v filling factors occurs in a
magnetic field whose strength grows monotonically with v. This behavior is
consistent with calculations of the electron spectrum, which predicts a
decrease in cyclotron gaps with increasing v. Oscillations with even filling
factors, corresponding to spin gaps, behave less trivially. First, the SdH
oscillations with filling factors of 4 and higher are resolved in a magnetic
field that is 2-2.5 times smaller than the field required to resolve
neighboring SdH oscillations with odd filling factors of 3 and higher. This
indicates a significant increase in the size of the spin gap caused by an
interface inversion asymmetry (IIA) leading to Dirac cone splitting in a zero
magnetic field. Using the spin splitting value gamma as a fitting parameter, we
obtained the best agreement between experimental data and calculations at
gamma=1.5 meV. Next, spin splitting for the zeroth and first LLs is observed in
2-3 times stronger magnetic fields than for the other levels, indicating an
increase in disorder near the Dirac point, due to the lack of screening.

The critical behavior of the order-disorder phase transition in the buckled

$c(4 {\times} 2)$- to the high-temperature $p(2 {\times} 1)$-reconstructed
surface is followed through the intensity and width of the superstructure spots
within the temperature range of 78-400 K. Near the critical temperature
$T_\mathrm{c} = 190.6$ K, we observe universal critical behavior of spot
intensities and correlation lengths which falls into the universality class of
the two-dimensional (2D) Ising model. From the ratio of correlation lengths
along and across the dimer rows we determine effective nearest-neighbor
couplings of an anisotropic 2D Ising model, $J_\parallel = (-24.9 \pm
0.9_\mathrm{stat} \pm 1.3_\mathrm{sys})$ meV and $J_\perp = (-0.8 \pm
0.1_\mathrm{stat})$ meV. We find that the experimentally determined coupling
constants of the Ising model can be reconciled with those of the more complex
lattice Hamiltonian from DFT when the critical behavior is of primary interest.
The anisotropy of the interactions derived from the experimental data via the
2D Ising model is best matched by DFT calculations using the PBEsol functional.
The trends in the calculated anisotropy are consistent with the surface stress
anisotropy predicted by the DFT functionals, pointing towards the role of
surface stress reduction as a driving force for establishing the $c(4 {\times}
2)$-reconstructed ground state.

Uranium ditelluride (UTe$_2$) has attracted recent interest due to its unique
superconducting properties, which include the potential for a topological
odd-parity superconducting state. Recently, ac-calorimetry measurements under
pressure indicate a change in the ground state of UTe$_2$ from superconducting
to antiferromagnetic at 1.4 GPa. Here, we investigate the effect of pressure on
the crystal structure of UTe$_2$ up to 25 GPa at room temperature using x-ray
diffraction. We find that UTe$_2$, which at ambient conditions has an
orthorhombic ($Immm$) structure, transforms to a body-centered tetragonal
($I4/mmm$) structure at 5 GPa in a quasi-hydrostatic neon (Ne) pressure
transmitting medium. In the absence of a pressure-transmitting medium, this
transformation occurs between 5 and 8 GPa. The data were fit with a third-order
Birch-Murnaghan equation of state resulting in values of $B_0$=46.0 $\pm$ 0.6
GPa, $B^{\prime}$=9.3 $\pm$ 0.5 (no pressure medium) and $B_0$=42.5 $\pm$ 2.0
GPa, $B^{\prime}$=9.3 (fixed) (neon pressure medium) for the $Immm$ phase. For
the $I4/mmm$ phase, $B_0$=78.9 $\pm$ 0.5 GPa and $B^{\prime}$=4.2 $\pm$ 0.1 (no
pressure transmitting medium), and $B_0$=70.0 $\pm$ 1.1 GPa and
$B^{\prime}$=4.1 $\pm$ 0.2 (neon pressure medium). The high-pressure tetragonal
phase is retained after decompression to ambient pressure, with approximately
30% remaining after 2 days. We argue that the observed phase transition into a
higher symmetry structure at P~5 GPa (orthorhombic to tetragonal), is
accompanied by an increase in the shortest distance between uranium atoms from
3.6 Angstrom (orthorhombic) to 3.9 Angstrom (tetragonal), which suggests
localization of the 5f electrons, albeit with a 10.7% decrease in volume.

The charge density wave (CDW) is a condensate that often forms in layered
materials. It is known to carry electric current \emph{en masse}, but the
transport mechanism remains poorly understood at the microscopic level. Its
quantum nature is revealed by several lines of evidence. Experiments often show
lack of CDW displacement when biased just below the threshold for nonlinear
transport, indicating the CDW never reaches the critical point for classical
depinning. Quantum behavior is also revealed by oscillations of period $h/2e$
in CDW conductance vs. magnetic flux, sometimes accompanied by telegraph-like
switching, in $\text{TaS}_3$ rings above 77 K. Here we discuss further evidence
for quantum CDW electron transport. We find that, for temperatures ranging from
9 to 474 K, CDW current-voltage plots of three trichalcogenide materials agree
almost precisely with a modified Zener-tunneling curve and with time-correlated
soliton tunneling model simulations. In our model we treat the Schr\"{o}dinger
equation as an emergent classical equation that describes fluidic
Josephson-like coupling of paired electrons between evolving topological
states. We find that an extension of this \lq classically robust' quantum
picture explains both the $h/2e$ magnetoconductance oscillations and switching
behavior in CDW rings. We consider potential applications for thermally robust
quantum information processing systems.

Exciting new fundamental scientific questions are currently being raised
regarding nonequilibrium dynamics in spin systems, as this directly relates to
low power and low loss energy transport for spintronics. Inelastic neutron
scattering (INS) is an indispensable tool to study spin excitations in complex
magnetic materials. However, conventional INS spectrometers currently only
perform steady-state measurements and probe averaged properties over many
collision events between spin excitations in thermodynamic equilibrium, while
the exact picture of re-equilibration of these excitations remains unknown. In
this work, we designed and implemented a time-resolved laser-neutron pump-probe
capability at HYSPEC (Hybrid Spectrometer, beamline 14-B) at the Spallation
Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This capability allows
us to excite out-of-equilibrium magnons with a nanosecond pulsed laser source
and probe the resulting dynamics using INS. Here, we discussed technical
aspects to implement such a capability in a neutron beamline, including choices
of suitable neutron instrumentation and material systems, laser excitation
scheme, experimental configurations, and relevant firmware and software
development to allow for time-synchronized pump-probe measurements. We
demonstrated that the laser-induced nonequilibrium structural factor is able to
be resolved by INS in a quantum magnet. The method developed in this work will
provide SNS with advanced capabilities for performing out-of-equilibrium
measurements, opening up an entirely new research direction to study
out-of-equilibrium phenomena using neutrons.

We have discovered that two significant quantities within hard particle
systems: the probability of successfully inserting an additional particle at
random and the scale distribution function, can be connected by a concise
relation. We anticipate that this relation holds universal applicability for
convex hard particles. Our investigations encompassed a range of particle
shapes, including one-dimensional line segments, two-dimensional disks,
equilateral and non-equilateral triangles, squares, rectangles, and
three-dimensional spheres. Remarkably, we have observed a close alignment
between the two sides of the relation in all cases we examined. Furthermore, we
show that this relation can be derived from the fundamental thermodynamic
relation that connects entropy, pressure, and chemical potential. Our study
unveils a geometrically rooted relation that underpins essential thermodynamic
relations, shedding light on the intricate interplay of geometry and
thermodynamics in hard particle systems.

Ga$_2$O$_3$ is a wide-bandgap material of interest for a wide variety of
devices, many of these requiring heterostructures, for instance to achieve
carrier confinement. A common method to create such heterostructures is to
alloy with In$_2$O$_3$ or Al$_2$O$_3$. However, the lattice constants of these
materials are significantly different from those of Ga$_2$O$_3$, leading to
large amounts of strain in the resulting heterostructure. By considering alloys
of In$_2$O$_3$ and Al$_2$O$_3$, the lattice constants can be tailored to those
of Ga$_2$O$_3$, while still keeping a sizeable conduction-band offset. We use
density functional theory with hybrid functionals to investigate the structural
and electronic properties of In$_2$O$_3$ and Al$_2$O$_3$ alloys in the
bixbyite, corundum, and monoclinic structures. We find that the lattice
constants increase with In incorporation. Bandgaps decrease with increasing In
concentration, demonstrating bowing, with $b=1.98$ eV for monoclinic, $b=4.27$
eV for corundum, and $b=4.9$ eV for bixbyite. We find the (In$_{\rm
0.25}$Al$_{\rm 0.75}$)$_{\rm 2}$O$_{\rm 3}$ 25% In, 75% Al monoclinic structure
to be of particular interest, as it closely matches the Ga$_2$O$_3$ lattice
constants while providing a conduction-band offset of 1 eV.

Ferromagnetism can be characterized by various unique phenomena such as
non-zero magnetization (inducing magnetic attraction/repulsion), diagonal
piezomagnetism, nonreciprocal circular dichroism (such as Faraday effect),
odd-order (including linear) anomalous Hall effect, and magneto-optical Kerr
effect. We identify all broken symmetries requiring each of the above
phenomena, and also the relevant magnetic point groups (MPGs) with those broken
symmetries. All of ferromagnetic point groups, relevant for ferromagnets,
ferri-magnets and weak ferromagnets, can certainly exhibit all of these
phenomena, including non-zero magnetization. Some of true antiferromagnets,
which are defined as magnets with MPGs that do not belong to ferromagnetic
point groups, can display these phenomena through magnetization induced by
external perturbations such as applied current, electric fields, light
illumination, and strain. Such MPGs are identified for each external
perturbation. Since high-density and ultrafast spintronic technologies can be
enabled by antiferromagnets, our findings will be an essential guidance for the
future magnetism-related science as well as technology.

<h3>Corrections to diffusion in interacting quantum systems</h3>

Transport and the approach to equilibrium in interacting classical and
quantum systems is a challenging problem of both theoretical and experimental
interest. One useful organizing principle characterizing equilibration is the
dissipative universality class, the most prevalent one being diffusion. In this
paper, we use the effective field theory (EFT) of diffusion to systematically
obtain universal power-law corrections to diffusion. We then employ large-scale
simulations of classical and quantum systems to explore their validity. In
particular, we find universal scaling functions for the corrections to the
dynamical structure factor $\langle n(x,t)n\rangle$, in the presence of a
single $U(1)$ or $SU(2)$ charge in systems with and without particle-hole
symmetry, and present the framework to generalize the calculation to multiple
charges. Classical simulations show remarkable agreement with EFT predictions
for subleading corrections, pushing precision tests of effective theories for
thermalizing systems to an unprecedented level. Moving to quantum systems, we
perform large-scale tensor-network simulations in unitary and noisy 1d Floquet
systems with conserved magnetization. We find a qualitative agreement with EFT
which becomes quantitative in the case of noisy systems. Additionally, we show
how the knowledge of EFT corrections allows for fitting methods, which can
improve the estimation of transport parameters at the intermediate times
accessible by simulations and experiments. Finally, we explore non-linear
response in quantum systems and find that EFT provides an accurate prediction
for its behavior. Our results provide a basis for a better understanding of the
non-linear phenomena present in thermalizing systems.

Lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$, LN) is a ferroelectric crystal of interest for
integrated photonics owing to the ability to impart periodic or chirped poling
via an external electric field and its large second-order optical nonlinearity
compared to other photonic materials like SiN. The introduction of thin-film
lithium niobate (TFLN) based on ion-slicing has enabled photonic circuits with
improved figures of merit on account of the greater refractive index contrast
than is achievable in bulk LN. However, TFLN device performance is presently
limited by surface roughness scattering induced by Ar$^+$ milling and the lack
of adequately precise etch depth control. Atomic layer etching (ALE) could
potentially overcome these limitations, but no ALE process has been reported
for LN. Here, we report a directional ALE process for x-cut MgO-doped LN using
sequential exposures of H$_2$ and SF$_6$ plasma. We observe etch rates up to
$1.01 \pm 0.05$ nm/cycle with a synergy of $94$%. This process has the
potential to serve as a post-processing step to achieve sub-nanometer-scale
etch depth control for TFLN devices, which may both increase the photonic
performance of existing TFLN devices and ultimately enable novel devices not
attainable in other integrated photonic platforms.

A comprehensive study of the electronic and structural phase transition from
1T` to Td in the bulk Weyl semimetal Mo1-xWxTe2 at different doping
concentrations has been carried out using time-of-flight momentum microscopy
(including circular and linear dichroism), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), X-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPD), X-ray diffraction (XRD),
angle-resolved Raman spectroscopy, transport measurements, density functional
theory (DFT) and Kikuchi pattern calculations. High-resolution angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) at 20 K reveals surface electronic states,
which are indicative of topological Fermi arcs. Their dispersion agrees with
the position of Weyl points predicted by DFT calculations based on the
experimental crystal structure of our samples determined by XRD. Raman
spectroscopy confirms the inversion symmetry breaking for the Td -phase, which
is a necessary condition for the emergence of topological states. Transport
measurements show that increasing the doping concentration from 2 to 9% leads
to an increase in the temperature of the phase transition from 1T` to Td from
230 K to 270 K. Magnetoresistance and longitudinal elastoresistance show
significantly increased values in the Td -phase due to stimulated inter-pocket
electron backscattering. The results demonstrate the close relationship between
electronic properties and elastic deformations in MoTe2.

Quantum criticality within Dirac fermions harbors a plethora of exotic
phenomena, attracting sustained attention in the past decades. Nevertheless,
the nonequilibrium dynamics therein has rarely been studied. To fill in the
gap, we explore the imaginary-time relaxation dynamics in a typical Dirac
quantum criticality belonging to chiral Heisenberg universality class.
Performing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we unveil rich
nonequilibrium critical phenomena from different initial states. Particularly,
a new dynamic exponent characterizing the non-stationary evolution in the
short-time state is determined as $\theta=-0.84(4)$, in sharp contrast with the
prevalent belief that $\theta$ is positive as demonstrated in classical cases.
Furthermore, we propose a universal dynamic scaling theory governing the
fruitful nonequilibrium properties in Dirac quantum criticality. Armed with the
scaling theory, we develop a new framework to investigate fermionic quantum
criticality based on short-time dynamics, paving a promising avenue to
fathoming quantum criticality in diverse fermionic systems with high
efficiency.

Through evolution, nature has presented a set of remarkable protein
materials, including elastins, silks, keratins and collagens with superior
mechanical performances that play crucial roles in mechanobiology. However,
going beyond natural designs to discover proteins that meet specified
mechanical properties remains challenging. Here we report a generative model
that predicts protein designs to meet complex nonlinear mechanical
property-design objectives. Our model leverages deep knowledge on protein
sequences from a pre-trained protein language model and maps mechanical
unfolding responses to create novel proteins. Via full-atom molecular
simulations for direct validation, we demonstrate that the designed proteins
are novel, and fulfill the targeted mechanical properties, including unfolding
energy and mechanical strength, as well as the detailed unfolding
force-separation curves. Our model offers rapid pathways to explore the
enormous mechanobiological protein sequence space unconstrained by biological
synthesis, using mechanical features as target to enable the discovery of
protein materials with superior mechanical properties.

We report a comprehensive study on the electronic transport properties of
SrZn$_2$Ge$_2$ single crystals. The in-plane electrical resistivity of the
compound exhibits linear temperature dependence for 80 K < T < 300 K, and T^2
dependence below 40 K, consistent with the Fermi liquid behavior. Both the
transverse and longitudinal magnetoresistance exhibit a crossover at critical
field B* from weak-field quadratic-like to high-field unsaturated linear field
dependence at low temperatures (T \leq 50 K). Different interpretations of this
magnetoresistance crossover behavior are presented based on the quantum limit
of Dirac Fermions and the specific topology of the Fermi surface of the
compound. Abrikosov's theory is employed to explain linear behavior of
magnetoresistance at low temperatures. The Hall resistivity data establish
SrZn$_2$Ge$_2$ as a multiband system with contributions from both the electrons
and holes. The Hall coefficient is observed to decrease with increasing
temperature and magnetic field, changing its sign from positive to negative.
The negative Hall coefficient observed at low temperatures in high fields and
at high temperatures over the entire field range suggests that the highly
mobile electron charge carriers dominate the electronic transport. Our
first-principles calculations show that nontrivial topological surface states
exist in SrZn$_2$Ge$_2$ within the bulk gap along the {\Gamma}-M path. Notably,
these surface states extend from the valence to conduction band with their
number varying based on the Sr and Ge termination plane. The Fermi surface of
the compound exhibits a distinct tetragonal petal-like structure, with one open
and several closed surfaces. Overall, these findings offer crucial insights
into the mechanisms underlying the electronic transport of the compound.

The topological properties of quasiparticles, such as skyrmions and vortices,
have the potential to offer extraordinary metastability through topological
protection, and drive motion with minimal electrical current excitation. This
has promising implications for future applications in spintronics. Skyrmions
frequently appear either in lattice form or as separate, isolated
quasiparticles \cite{Tokura21}. Magnetic ferroelectrics, a subset of
multiferroics that exhibit magnetically induced ferroelectricity, possess
intriguing characteristics like magnetic (electric) field-controlled
ferroelectric (magnetic) responses. Previous research based on Landau theory
indicated the potential to stabilize metastable phases in multiferroic barium
hexaferrite \cite{Karpov19}. We have successfully stabilized these meta-stable
phases through magnetic quenching of hexaferrite nanoparticles, leading to the
creation of compelling topological structures. The structural changes in
individual BaFe$_{12}$O$_{19}$ nanocrystals were scrutinized using Bragg
coherent diffractive imaging, granting us insight into the emergent topological
structures in field-quenched multiferroics. Additionally, we explored why these
structures are energetically preferable for the formation of metastable
topological structures.

In a growing number of materials, phonons have been found to generate a
thermal Hall effect, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Inspired by
previous studies that revealed the importance of Tb$^{3+}$ ions in generating
the thermal Hall effect of Tb$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$O$_{7}$, we investigated the role of
Tm$^{3+}$ ions in TmVO$_{4}$, a paramagnetic insulator with a different crystal
structure. We observe a negative thermal Hall conductivity in TmVO$_{4}$ with a
magnitude such that the Hall angle, $|\kappa_{xy}$/$\kappa_{xx}|$, is
approximately 1 x 10$^{-3}$ at $H$ = 15 T and $T$ = 20 K, typical for a
phonon-generated thermal Hall effect. In contrast to the negligible
$\kappa_{xy}$ found in Y$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$O$_{7}$, we observe a negative
$\kappa_{xy}$ in YVO$_{4}$ with a Hall angle of magnitude comparable to that of
TmVO$_{4}$. This shows that the Tm$^{3+}$ ions are not essential for the
thermal Hall effect in this family of materials. Interestingly, at an
intermediate Y concentration of 30 % in Tm$_{1-x}$Y$_{x}$VO$_{4}$,
$\kappa_{xy}$ was found to have a positive sign, pointing to the possible
importance of impurities in the thermal Hall effect of phonons.
