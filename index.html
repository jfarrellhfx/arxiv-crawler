<p>Living systems display complex behaviors driven not only by physical forces,
but also decision-making guided by information processing and molded by
cultural and/or biological evolution. Hydrodynamic theories hold promise for
simplified, universal descriptions of these collective behaviors. However,
incorporating the individual preferences of decision-making organisms into a
hydrodynamic theory is an open problem. Here, we develop a data-driven pipeline
that links micromotives to macrobehavior by augmenting hydrodynamics with
utility functions that describe individual preferences in microeconomics. We
show how to systematically validate the hypotheses underlying this construction
from data using statistical tools based on neural networks. We illustrate this
pipeline on the case study of human residential dynamics in the United States,
for which census and sociological data is available, and show how trends in
sociological surveys can be related to trends seen in racial segregation. In
particular, we highlight that a history-dependence in the
segregation-integration transition can arise even when agents have no memory.
Beyond residential segregation, our work paves the way for systematic
investigations of social-driven motility in real space from micro-organisms to
humans, as well as fitness-mediated motion in more abstract genomic spaces.

<h3>Influence of Rhenium Concentration on Charge Doping and Defect Formation  in MoS2</h3>

<p>Substitutionally doped transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are the next
step towards realizing TMD-based field effect transistors, sensors, and quantum
photonic devices. Here, we report on the influence of Re concentration on
charge doping and defect formation in MoS2 monolayers grown by metal-organic
chemical vapor deposition. Re-MoS2 films can exhibit reduced sulfur-site
defects; however, as the Re concentration approaches 2 atom%, there is
significant clustering of Re in the MoS2. Ab Initio calculations indicate that
the transition from isolated Re atoms to Re clusters increases the ionization
energy of Re dopants, thereby reducing Re-doping efficacy. Using
photoluminescence spectroscopy, we show that Re dopant clustering creates
defect states that trap photogenerated excitons within the MoS2 lattice. These
results provide insight into how the local concentration of metal dopants
affect carrier density, defect formation, and exciton recombination in TMDs,
which can aid the development of future TMD-based devices with improved
electronic and photonic properties.

<h3>Quantum circuits with multiterminal Josephson-Andreev junctions</h3>

<i>F. J. Matute-Cañadas, L. Tosi, A. Levy Yeyati</i>
<p>We explore superconducting quantum circuits where several leads are
simultaneously connected beyond the tunneling regime, such that the fermionic
structure of Andreev bound states in the resulting multiterminal Josephson
junction influences the states of the full circuit. Using a simple model of
single channel contacts and a single level in the middle region, we discuss
different circuit configurations where the leads are islands with finite
capacitance and/or form loops with finite inductance. We find situations of
practical interest where the circuits can be used to define noise protected
qubits, which map to the bifluxon and $0{-}\pi$ qubits in the tunneling regime.
We also point out the subtleties of the gauge choice for a proper description
of these quantum circuits dynamics.

<h3>Spectral sum rules reflect topological and quantum-geometric invariants</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17318" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17318</a>
<br>
<i>Alexander Kruchkov, Shinsei Ryu</i>
<p>Topological invariants are fundamental characteristics reflecting global
properties of quantum systems, yet their exploration has predominantly been
limited to the static (DC) transport and transverse (Hall) channel. In this
work, we extend the spectral sum rules for frequency-resolved electric
conductivity $\sigma (\omega)$ in topological systems, and show that the sum
rule for the longitudinal channel is expressed through topological and
quantum-geometric invariants. We find that for dispersionless (flat) Chern
bands, the rule is expressed as, $ \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} d\omega \,
\text{Re}(\sigma_{xx} + \sigma_{yy}) = C \Delta e^2$, where $C$ is the Chern
number, $\Delta$ the topological gap, and $e$ the electric charge. In scenarios
involving dispersive Chern bands, the rule is defined by the invariant of the
quantum metric, and Luttinger invariant, $\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} d\omega \,
\text{Re}(\sigma_{xx} + \sigma_{yy}) = 2 \pi e^2 \Delta \sum_{\boldsymbol{k}}
\text{Tr} \, \mathcal{G}_{ij}(\boldsymbol{k})$+(Luttinger invariant), where
$\text{Tr} \, \mathcal {G}_{ij}$ is invariant of the Fubini-Study metric
(defining spread of Wannier orbitals). We further discuss the physical role of
topological and quantum-geometric invariants in spectral sum rules. Our
approach is adaptable across varied topologies and system dimensionalities.

<h3>Skyrmion and incommensurate spin dynamics in centrosymmetric  Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$</h3>

<p>Skyrmions are particle-like vortices of magnetization with non-trivial
topology, which are usually stabilized by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions
(DMI) in noncentrosymmetric bulk materials. Exceptions are centrosymmetric Gd-
and Eu-based skyrmion-lattice (SkL) hosts with net zero DMI, where both the
dominant SkL stabilization mechanisms and ground-state magnetic properties
remain controversial. In this Letter we use muon spectroscopy ($\mu$SR) to
address these by investigating both static and dynamic spin properties of the
most-studied centrosymmetric SkL host, Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$. We find that spin
fluctuations in the non-coplanar SkL phase are highly anisotropic, implying
that spin anisotropy plays a prominent role in stabilizing this phase.
Intriguingly, we also observe strongly-anisotropic spin fluctuations in the
ground-state (IC-1) incommensurate magnetic phase of the material, indicating
that it is a complex multi-$q$ magnetic structure. On the other hand, the
higher-field coplanar IC-2 phase is found to be single-$q$ with mostly
isotropic spin dynamics.

<h3>Coupling of structure and magnetism to spin splitting in hybrid  organic-inorganic perovskites</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17352" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17352</a>

<i>Ravi Kashikar, D. DeTellem, P. S. Ghosh, Yixuan Xu, S. Ma, S. Witanachchi, Manh-Huong Phan, S. Lisenkov, I. Ponomareva</i>
<p>Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites are famous for the diversity of their
chemical compositions, phases and phase transitions, and associated physical
properties. We use a combination of experimental and computational techniques
to reveal strong coupling between structure, magnetism, and spin splitting in a
representative of the largest family of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites:
the formates. With the help of first-principles simulations, we find spin
splitting in both conduction and valence bands of [NH$_2$NH$_3$]Co(HCOO)$_3$,
induced by spin-orbit interactions, which can reach up to 14~meV. Our magnetic
measurements reveal that this material exhibits canted antiferromagnetism below
15.5 K. The direction of the associated antiferromagnetic order parameter is
strongly coupled with the spin splitting already in the centrosymmetric phase,
allowing for the creation and annihilation of spin splitting through the
application of a magnetic field. Furthermore, the structural phase transition
into experimentally observed polar Pna2$_1$ phase completely changes the
aforementioned spin splitting and its coupling to magnetic degrees of freedom.
This reveals that in [NH$_2$NH$_3$]Co(HCOO)$_3$, the structure and magnetism
are strongly coupled to spin splitting in a way that allows for its
manipulation through both magnetic and electric fields. As an example, for a
given point inside the Brillouin zone of centrosymmetric Pnma phase of
[NH$_2$NH$_3$]Co(HCOO)$_3$, spin splitting can be turned on/off by aligning the
antiferromagnetic vector along certain crystallographic directions or through
inducing a polar phase by the application of an electric field. We believe that
our findings offer an important step toward fundamental understanding and
practical applications of materials with coupled properties.

<h3>Topological transitions in the site-diluted Yao-Lee spin-orbital model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17359" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17359</a>
<br>
<i>Vladislav Poliakov, Wen-Han Kao, Natalia B. Perkins</i>
<p>The Yao-Lee (YL) model is an example of exactly solvable spin-orbital models
that are generalizations of the original Kitaev honeycomb model with extra
local orbital degrees of freedom. Similar to the Kitaev model, both spin and
orbital degrees of freedom are effectively represented using sets of
three-flavored Majorana fermions. The YL model exhibits a quantum spin liquid
ground state with gapped and immobile Z$_2$ fluxes and three-fold degenerate
itinerant Majorana fermions. Our work demonstrated that by introducing
different time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking fields one can split the
degeneracy of Majorana fermions and close the gap for some of the bands, thus
changing its topology. We calculated a comprehensive topological phase diagram
for the YL model by considering various combinations of TRS breaking fields.
This investigation revealed the emergence of distinct topological regions, each
separated by nodal lines, signifying an evolution in the model's topological
properties. We also investigated the impact of vacancies in the system. Our
findings revealed that while vacancies modify the low-energy spectrum of the
model, their presence has a limited impact on the topological properties of the
model, at least for small enough concentrations.

<h3>Josephson current through the SYK model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17366" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17366</a>
<br>
<i>Luca Dell'Anna</i>
<p>We calculate the equilibrium Josephson current through a disordered
interacting quantum dot described by a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model contacted by two
BCS superconductors. We show that, at zero temperature and at the conformal
limit, i.e. in the strong interacting limit, the Josephson current is strongly
suppressed by $U$, the strength of the interaction, as $\ln(U)/U$ and becomes
universal, namely it gets independent on the superconducting pairing. At finite
temperature $T$, instead, it depends on the ratio between the gap and the
temperature and vanishes as $1/T^2$ upon increasing the temperature. A
proximity effect exists but the self-energy corrections induced by the coupling
with the superconducting leads seem subleading as compared to the self-energy
due to interaction for large number of particles.

<h3>Theory of Quantum Light-Matter Interaction in Cavities: Extended Systems  and the Long Wavelength Approximation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17374" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17374</a>
<br>
<i>Mark Kamper Svendsen, Michael Ruggenthaler, Hannes Hübener, Christian Schäfer, Martin Eckstein, Angel Rubio, Simone Latini</i>
<p>When light and matter interact strongly, the coupled system inherits
properties from both constituents. It is consequently possible to alter the
properties of either by engineering the other. This intriguing possibility has
lead to the emergence of the cavity-materials-engineering paradigm which seeks
to tailor material properties by engineering the fluctuations of a dark
electromagnetic environment. The theoretical description of hybrid light-matter
systems is complicated by the combined complexity of a realistic description of
the extended electronic and quantum electromagnetic fields. Here we derive an
effective, non-perturbative theory for low dimensional crystals embedded in a
paradigmatic Fabry-P\'erot resonator in the long-wavelength limit. The theory
encodes the multi-mode nature of the electromagnetic field into an effective
single-mode scheme and it naturally follows from requiring a negligible
momentum transfer from the photonic system to the matter. Crucially, in the
effective theory the single light mode is characterized by a finite effective
mode volume even in the limit of bulk cavity-matter systems and can be directly
determined by realistic cavity parameters. As a consequence, the coupling of
the effective mode to matter remains finite for bulk materials. By leveraging
on the realistic description of the cavity system we make our effective theory
free from the double counting of the coupling of matter to the electromagnetic
vacuum fluctuations of free space. Our results provide a substantial step
towards the realistic description of interacting cavity-matter systems at the
level of the fundamental Hamiltonian, by effectively including the
electromagnetic environment and going beyond the perfect mirrors approximation.

<h3>Confined Meson Excitations in Rydberg-Atom Arrays Coupled to a Cavity  Field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17385" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17385</a>
<br>
<i>Tharnier O. Puel, Tommaso Macrì</i>
<p>Confinement is a pivotal phenomenon in numerous models of high-energy and
statistical physics. In this study, we investigate the emergence of confined
meson excitations within a one-dimensional system, comprising Rydberg-dressed
atoms trapped and coupled to a cavity field. This system can be effectively
represented by an Ising-Dicke Hamiltonian model. The observed ground-state
phase diagram reveals a first-order transition from a ferromagnetic-subradiant
phase to a paramagnetic-superradiant phase. Notably, a quench near the
transition point within the ferromagnetic-subradiant phase induces meson
oscillations in the spins and leads to the creation of squeezed-vacuum light
states. We suggest a method for the photonic characterization of these confined
excitations, utilizing homodyne detection and single-site imaging techniques to
observe the localized particles. The methodologies and results detailed in this
paper are feasible for implementation on existing cavity-QED platforms,
employing Rydberg-atom arrays in deep optical lattices or optical tweezers.

<h3>Quantum bicritical point and phase separation in a frustrated Heisenberg  ladder</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17399" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17399</a>
<br>
<i>D. S. Almeida, R. R. Montenegro-Filho</i>
<p>We use the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and a hard-core boson
map to investigate the quantum phase transitions present in the phase diagram
of the frustrated Heisenberg ladder in a magnetic field. The quantum bicritical
point is observed at the end of a first-order transition line, which is at the
meeting of the two second-order transition lines that bound the fully polarized
plateau. The characterization of the bicritical point was made using a
hard-core boson mapping of the low-energy excitations from the fully polarized
phase and through DMRG by studying the probability density of finding the rung
spins in a singlet or a triplet state with zero spin component along the
magnetic field. In particular, we give conditions for the exchange couplings
for the presence of the first-order transition line and the bicritical point in
the phase diagram. Moreover, we unveil the phase-separated states for
magnetization values inside the magnetization jump and, in particular, the
dependence on the system size of the energy curve as a function of
magnetization. Finite-size scaling analysis of the transverse spin correlation
functions has been used to estimate the critical points of the
Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions from the fractional magnetization plateau
$m=1/2$ to the respective gapless Luttinger liquid phases for some sets of
parameters.

<h3>Thermotropic reentrant isotropy and antiferroelectricity in the  ferroelectric nematic realm: Comparing RM734 and DIO</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17400" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17400</a>
<br>
<i>Bingchen Zhong, Min Shuai, Xi Chen, Vikina Martinez, Eva Korblova, Matthew A. Glaser, Joseph E. Maclennan, David M. Walba, Noel A. Clark</i>
<p>The current intense study of ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals was
initiated by the observation of the same ferroelectric nematic phase in two
independently discovered organic rod-shaped mesogenic compounds, RM734 and DIO.
We recently reported that the compound RM734 also exhibits a monotropic,
low-temperature, antiferroelectric phase having reentrant isotropic symmetry
(the $I_A$ phase), the formation of which is facilitated to a remarkable degree
by doping with small (below $1\%$) amounts of the ionic liquid ${\rm
BMIM-PF}_6$. Here we report similar phenomenology in DIO, showing that this
reentrant isotropic behavior is not only a property of RM734 but is rather a
more general, material-independent feature of ferroelectric nematic mesogens.
We find that the reentrant isotropic phases observed in RM734 and DIO are
similar but not identical, adding two new phases to the ferroelectric nematic
realm. The two $I_A$ phases exhibit similar, strongly peaked, diffuse x-ray
scattering in the WAXS range $(1<q<2 \, \AA^{-1})$ indicative of a distinctive
mode of short-ranged, side-by-side molecular packing. The scattering of the
$I_A$ phases at small $q$ is quite different in the two materials, however,
with RM734 exhibiting a strong, single, diffuse peak at $q \sim 0.08 \,\AA
^{-1}$ indicating mesoscale modulation with $\sim 80 \,\AA$ periodicity, and
DIO a sharper diffuse peak at $q \sim 0.27 \,\AA ^{-1} \sim (2\pi/{\rm
molecular length})$, with second and third harmonics, indicating that in the
$I_A$ phase of DIO, short-ranged molecular positional correlation is smectic
layer-like.

<h3>In-Plane Magnon Valve Effect in Magnetic Insulator/Heavy Metal/ Magnetic  Insulator Device</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17413" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17413</a>
<br>
<i>Tianyi Zhang, Caihua Wan, Xiufeng Han</i>
<p>We propose an in-plane magnon valve (MV), a sandwich structure composed of
ferromagnetic insulator/heavy metal/ferromagnetic insulator (MI/HM/MI). When
the magnetizations of the two MI layers are parallel, the longitudinal
conductance in the HM layer is greater than that in the antiparallel state
according to the magnetic proximity effect, termed as the in-plane magnon valve
effect. We investigate the dependence of MV ratio (MVR), which is the relative
change in longitudinal conductance between the parallel and antiparallel MV
states, on the difference in electronic structure between magnetized and
non-magnetized metal atoms, revealing that MVR can reach 100%. Additionally,
the dependence of MVR on the thickness of metal layer is analyzed, revealing an
exponential decrease with increasing thickness. Then we investigate the
dependence of HM layer conductance on the relative angle between the
magnetizations of two MI layers, illustrating the potential of MV as a
magneto-sensitive magnonic sensor. We also investigate the effect of Joule
heating on the measurement signal based on the spin Seebeck effect. Two
designed configurations are proposed according to whether the electron current
is parallel or perpendicular to the magnetization of the MI layer. In the
parallel configuration, the transverse voltage differs between the parallel and
antiparallel MV states. While in the perpendicular configuration, the
longitudinal resistance differs. Quantitative numerical results indicate the
feasibility of detecting a voltage signal using the first configuration in
experiments. Our work contributes valuable insights for the design, development
and integration of magnon devices

<h3>Understanding the magnetic interactions of the zig-zag honeycomb  lattice: Application to $α$-RuCl$_3$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17433" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17433</a>
<br>
<i>E.M. Wilson, J.T. Haraldsen</i>
<p>This investigation covers the effects of variable exchange interactions on
the spin dynamics of the zig-zag honeycomb lattice. Using a Holstein-Primakoff
expansion of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian with easy-axis anisotropy, we
characterize the effects of multiple nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor
interactions with asymmetry within the context of a frustrated and
non-frustrated zig-zag magnetic configuration. Furthermore, we compare to the
known inelastic neutron scattering data for the proximate quantum spin liquid
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and we provide insight into the evolution of the spin
dynamics, showing that the Heisenberg interaction dominates the majority of the
spin excitation behavior. By analyzing the frustrated system with multiple
interactions, direction-dependent Dirac nodes present themselves, and we can
demonstrate that a standard Heisenberg model can accurately describe the
observed magnon spectra.

<h3>Non-thermal electron-photon steady-states in open  cavity-quantum-materials</h3>

<br>
<i>R. Flores-Calderón, Francesco Piazza</i>
<p>Coupling a system to two different baths can lead to novel phenomena escaping
the constraints of thermal equilibrium. In quantum materials inside optical
cavities, this feature can be exploited as electrons and cavity-photons are
easily pulled away from their mutual equilibrium, even in the steady state.
This offers new routes for a non-invasive control of material properties and
functionalities. We show how the absence of thermal equilibrium between
electrons and photons leads to qualitative modifications of the material's
properties, as the standard Sommerfeld expansion for observables near the Fermi
surface is modified by a leading-order correction linearly proportional to the
temperature difference. This modification arises from the breaking of a
symmetry underlying the thermal description and thus can't be predicted within
the latter.

<h3>Bilayer Vanadium Dioxide Thin Film with Elevated Transition Temperatures  and High Resistance Switching</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17437" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17437</a>
<br>
<i>Achintya Dutta, Ashok P, Amit Verma</i>
<p>Despite widespread interest in the phase-change applications of vanadium
dioxide (VO$_2$), the fabrication of high-quality VO$_2$ thin films with
elevated transition temperatures (TIMT) and high Insulator-Metal-Transition
resistance switching still remains a challenge. This study introduces a
two-step atmospheric oxidation approach to fabricate bilayer VO$_{2-x}$/VO$_2$
films on a c-plane sapphire substrate. To quantify the impact of the VO$_2$
buffer layer, a single-layer VO$_2$ film of the same thickness was also
fabricated. The bilayer VO$_{2-x}$/VO$_2$ films wherein the top VO$_{2-x}$ film
was under-oxidized demonstrated an elevation in TIMT reaching ~97 $^\circ$C,
one of the highest reported to date for VO$_2$ films and is achieved in a
doping-free manner. Our results also reveal a one-order increase in resistance
switching, with the optimum bilayer VO$_2$/VO$_2$ film exhibiting ~3.6 orders
of switching from 25 $^\circ$C to 110 $^\circ$C, compared to the optimum
single-layer VO$_2$ reference film. This is accompanied by a one-order decrease
in the on-state resistance in its metallic phase. The elevation in TIMT,
coupled with increased strain extracted from the XRD characterization of the
bilayer film, suggests the possibility of compressive strain along the c-axis.
These VO$_{2-x}$/VO$_2$ films also demonstrate a significant change in the
slope of their resistance vs temperature curves contrary to the conventional
smooth transition. This feature was ascribed to the rutile/monoclinic
quasi-heterostructure formed due to the top VO$_{2-x}$ film having a reduced
TIMT. Our findings carry significant implications for both the lucid
fabrication of VO$_2$ thin film devices as well as the study of phase
transitions in correlated oxides.

<h3>Electrochemical transport in Dirac nodal-line semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17439" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17439</a>
<br>
<i>R. Flores-Calderón, Leonardo Medel, A. Martín-Ruiz</i>
<p>Nodal-line semimetals are topological phases where the conduction and the
valence bands cross each other along one-dimensional lines in the Brillouin
zone, which are symmetry protected by either spatial symmetries or
time-reversal symmetry. In particular, nodal lines protected by the combined
$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry exhibits the parity anomaly of 2D Dirac fermions. In
this Letter, we study the electrochemical transport in a
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Dirac nodal line semimetals by using the semiclassical
Boltzmann equation approach. We derive a general formula for the topological
current that includes both the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment.
We first evaluate the electrochemical current by introducing a small
$\mathcal{PT}$-breaking mass term (which could be induced by inversion-breaking
uniaxial strain, pressure, or an external electric field) and apply it to the
hexagonal pnictide CaAgP. The electrochemical current vanishes in the zero-mass
limit. Introducing a tilting term that does not spoil $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry
that protects the nodal ring, we obtain a finite electrochemical current in the
zero-mass limit, which can be regarded as a direct consequence of the parity
anomaly. We show that the parity anomaly induced electrochemical transport is
also present at nonzero temperatures.

<h3>Out-of-equilibrium interactions and collective locomotion of colloidal  spheres with squirming of nematoelastic multipoles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17470" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17470</a>
<br>
<i>Bohdan Senyuk, Jin-Sheng Wua, Ivan I. Smalyukh</i>
<p>Many living and artificial systems show a similar emergent behavior and
collective motions on different scales, starting from swarms of bacteria to
synthetic active particles, herds of mammals and crowds of people. What all
these systems often have in common is that new collective properties like
flocking emerge from interactions between individual self-propelled or
externally driven units. Such systems are naturally out-of-equilibrium and
propel at the expense of consumed energy. Mimicking nature by making
self-propelled or externally driven particles and studying their individual and
collective motility may allow for deeper understanding of physical
underpinnings behind the collective motion of large groups of interacting
objects or beings. Here, using a soft matter system of colloids immersed into a
liquid crystal, we show that resulting so-called nematoelastic multipoles can
be set into a bidirectional locomotion by external periodically oscillating
electric fields. Out-of-equilibrium elastic interactions between such colloids
lead to collective flock-like behaviors, which emerge from time-varying
elasticity-mediated interactions between externally driven propelling
particles. The repulsive elastic interactions in the equilibrium state can be
turned into attractive interactions in the out-of-equilibrium state under
applied electric fields. We probe this behavior at different number densities
of colloidal particles and show that particles in a dense dispersion
collectively select the same direction of a coherent motion due to elastic
interactions between near neighbors. In our experimentally implemented design,
their motion is highly ordered and without clustering or jamming often present
in other colloidal transport systems, which is promising for technological and
fundamental-science applications, like nano-cargo transport, out-of-equilibrium
assembly and microrobotics.

<h3>Quantum logarithmic multifractality</h3>

<i>Weitao Chen, Olivier Giraud, Jiangbin Gong, Gabriel Lemarié</i>
<p>Through a combination of rigorous analytical derivations and extensive
numerical simulations, this work reports an exotic multifractal behavior,
dubbed "logarithmic multifractality", in effectively infinite-dimensional
systems undergoing the Anderson transition. In marked contrast to conventional
multifractal critical properties observed at finite-dimensional Anderson
transitions or scale-invariant second-order phase transitions, in the presence
of logarithmic multifractality, eigenstate statistics, spatial correlations,
and wave packet dynamics can all exhibit scaling laws which are algebraic in
the logarithm of system size or time. Our findings offer crucial insights into
strong finite-size effects and slow dynamics in complex systems undergoing the
Anderson transition, such as the many-body localization transition.

<p>We present theoretical and experimental studies of superconductivity and low
temperature structural phase boundaries in lithium. We mapped the structural
phase diagram of 6Li and 7Li under hydrostatic conditions between 5 top 55GPa
and within the temperature range of 15 to 75K, observing the FCC-hR1-cI16 phase
transitions. 6Li and 7Li show some differences at the structural boundaries,
with a potential shift of the phase boundaries of 6Li to lower pressures.
Density functional theory calculations and topological analysis of the electron
density elucidates the superconducting properties and interatomic interactions
within these phases of lithium.

<h3>Experimental evidence of seismic ruptures initiated by aseismic slip</h3>

<p>Seismic faults release the stress accumulated during tectonic movement
through rapid ruptures or slow slip events. The slow slip events play a crucial
role in the seismic cycle as they impact the occurrence of earthquakes.
However, the mechanisms by which a slow-slip region affects the dynamics of
frictionally locked regions remain elusive. Here, building on model laboratory
experiments, we establish that a slow-slip region acts as a nucleation center
for seismic rupture, thereby enhancing earthquakes' frequency. We emulate
slow-slip regions by introducing a granular material patch along part of a
laboratory fault. By measuring the response of the fault to shear, we show that
the role of the heterogeneity is to serve as a seed crack for rapid ruptures,
reducing fault shear resistance. Additionally, by varying the external normal
load, we show that the slow-slip region extends beyond the heterogeneity,
demonstrating that fault composition is not the only requirement for slow-slip,
but that load also plays a role. Our findings demonstrate that fracture
concepts single out the very origin of earthquake nucleation and slip dynamics
in seismic faults. The interplay between slowly-slipping and locked regions
that we identify provides a promising avenue to monitor fault propagation and
mitigate seismic hazards.

<h3>Surface-Driven and Strain-Induced Modulation of Point Defect  Distribution in Solid Ion Conductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17534" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17534</a>
<br>
<i>Md Salman Rabbi Limon, Zeeshan Ahmad</i>
<p>Alkali metal anodes coupled with solid ion conductors present a compelling
material combination for improving the energy density of batteries. The solid
ion conductor must facilitate rapid ion transport through point defects for
fast charging and discharging. Here, we advance the understanding of point
defects by quantifying the heterogeneity of defect distribution in Li$_3$OCl
ion conductor. We calculate the defect formation energy (DFE) of charged
lithium vacancies and interstitials under the presence of strain and as a
function of the distance from the surface using first-principles simulations.
The interstitial DFE reduces by 8.0 % under 2 % tensile strain and increases by
7.3 % under 2 % compressive strain. The surface DFE is typically lower than the
bulk, the difference being as high as 0.85 eV, indicating the aggregation of
defects at surfaces. We further determine that the DFE changes exponentially on
moving from the surface towards the inner bulk-like layers.

<h3>Effect of Point Defects and Lattice Distortions on the Structural,  Electronic, and Magnetic properties of Co$_2$MnAl Heusler alloy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17545" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17545</a>
<br>
<i>Amar Kumar, Sujeet Chaudhary, Sharat Chandra</i>
<p>The effects of various point defects and lattice distortions on the
structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of Co$_2$MnAl alloy are
investigated using density functional theory calculations. For the point
defects, six types of binary antisites, three types of ternary antisites, and
three kinds of vacancies have been simulated with different disorder degrees,
up to a maximum of 12.50%. For the lattice distortions, cubic strain within
-10% $\leq$$\Delta{V/V_0}$$\leq$ 10% (corresponding to 5.50\r{A} $\leq$ a
$\leq$5.88\r{A}) and tetragonal distortions with
0.5$\leq$$\textit{c/a}$$\leq$1.5 at three different unit-cell volumes -
$\textit{V}_0$ and ($\textit{V}_0$$\pm5$%$\textit{V}_0$) have been considered.
The Co$_{Al}$ and Mn$_{Al}$ binary antisite disordered structures (namely,
Co$_{2.0625}$MnAl$_{0.9375}$, Co$_{2.125}$MnAl$_{0.875}$,
Co$_2$Mn$_{1.0625}$Al$_{0.9375}$ and Co$_2$Mn$_{1.125}$Al$_{0.875}$) and
(Co$_{Al}$+Mn$_{Al}$) ternary antisite disordered structure
(Co$_{2.0625}$Mn$_{1.0625}$Al$_{0.875}$) exhibit perfect half-metallicity. The
rest of the antisite disorders have a marginal effect on the half-metallic
properties of Co$_2$MnAl, along with high spin polarization ($\textit{P}$
$\geq$ 70%) and nearly same magnetization ($\textit{M$_s$}$) as that for ideal
structure. Conversely, the vacancy defects significantly affect the electronic
and magnetic properties. The cubic strained structures exhibit high
$\textit{P}$ and constant $\textit{M$_s$}$. Under negative strain within -10%
$\leq$$\Delta{V/V_0}$$\leq$ -7% (for 5.50\r{A} $\leq$ a $\leq$ 5.58\r{A}), the
strained structures have perfect half-metallicity. On the other hand,
tetragonal distortions lead to significant degradation in half-metallic
behavior, except for small distortion values $\Delta{c/a}$, irrespective of
their volume.

<i>Hideki Matsuoka, Yukako Fujishiro, Susumu Minami, Takashi Koretsune, Ryotaro Arita, Yoshinori Tokura, Yoshihiro Iwasa</i>
<p>Manipulating carrier density through gate effects, both in electrostatic
charge storage and electrochemical intercalation mode, offers powerful control
over material properties, although commonly restricted to ultra-thin films or
van der Waals materials. Here we demonstrate the application of gate-driven
carrier modulation in the microdevice of magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2,
fabricated from a bulk single crystal via focused ion beam (FIB). We discovered
a Li-intercalated phase LixCo3Sn2S2 featuring electron doping exceeding 5*1021
cm-3, resulting in the Fermi energy shift of 200 meV. The carrier density
dependent anomalous Hall conductivity shows fair agreement with density
functional theory (DFT) calculation, which also predicts intercalated Li+ ion
stabilization within the anion layer while maintaining the kagome-lattice
intact. This likely explains the observed rigid band behavior and constant
Curie temperature, contrasting with magnetic site substitution experiments. Our
findings suggest ionic gating on FIB devices broadens the scope of gate-tuning
in quantum materials.

<p>Tuning magnetic properties in layered van der Waals (vdW) materials has
captured a significant attention due to the efficient control of ground-states
by heterostructuring and external stimuli. Electron doping by electrostatic
gating, interfacial charge transfer and intercalation is particularly effective
in manipulating the exchange and spin-orbit properties, resulting in a control
of Curie temperature ($T_{\text{C}}$) and magnetic anisotropy. Here, we
discover an uncharted role of intercalation to generate magnetic frustration.
As a model study, we intercalate Na atoms into the vdW gaps of pristine
Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ (CGT) where generated magnetic frustration leads to emerging
spin-glass states coexisting with a ferromagnetic order. A series of dynamic
magnetic susceptibility measurements/analysis confirms the formation of
magnetic clusters representing slow dynamics with a distribution of relaxation
times. The intercalation also modifies other macroscopic physical parameters
including the significant enhancement of $T_{\text{C}}$ from 66K\, to 240\,K
and the switching of magnetic easy-hard axis direction. Our study identifies
intercalation as a unique route to generate emerging frustrated spin states in
simple vdW crystals.

<h3>Effect of Exchange Interaction and Spin-Orbit Coupling on Spin Splitting  in CdSnX (X = S, Se and Te) nanoribbons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17562" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17562</a>
<br>
<i>Sutapa Chattopadhyay, Vikas Kashid, P. Durganandini, Anjali Kshirsagar</i>
<p>We have studied the topological properties of free standing Sn doped cadmium
chalcogenide (CdSnX, X = S, Se and Te) nanoribbons of varying widths and three
types of edges viz., distorted armchair, normal armchair and normal zigzag
edges. The unsatisfied bonds of X and Sn atoms at the edges cause non-zero
values of the magnetic moment. This introduces an exchange field leading to
inverted band structure. The electronic band structures of distorted armchair
edge nanoribbons also exhibit different types of spin splitting property for
different X atoms due to the different local orbital angular momentum at
specific X atomic site with the inclusion of spin orbit coupling (SOC). The gap
opening at the band crossings near the Fermi level after inclusion of SOC are
mainly due to SOC of Sn atom and are responsible for the electron and hole
pockets making the system topologically exotic. All the distorted edge
nanoribbons show metallic behaviour with non-zero magnetic moments. Amongst CdX
(X = S, Se and Te) nanoribbons, systems containing S atoms exhibit Weyl-like
semi-metallic behavior and not much change with width, that of Se atoms exhibit
Zeeman-type spin splitting and significant change with varying width, whereas
systems containing Te atoms show signature of Rashba spin splitting along with
Zeeman-type spin splitting and moderate change with varying width. The armchair
edge nanoribbons show wide gap semiconducting behaviour. Zeeman-type spin
splitting is seen in the valence band region for systems containing S atoms and
Rashba spin splitting is visible in the conduction band region for systems
containing Se and Te atoms. For zigzag edge nanoribbons, no such signature of
spin splitting is observed although all the nanoribbons acquire very high
magnetic moments.

<h3>Modeling polyelectrolyte hydration from a multi scale polarizable pseudo  particle solvent coarse grained approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17580" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17580</a>
<br>
<i>Michel Masella, Fabien Léonforté</i>
<p>We investigate the reliability of simulations of polyelectrolyte systems in
aqueous environments, simulations that are performed using an efficient multi
scale coarse grained polarizable pseudo-particle particle approach, denoted as
pppl, to model the solvent water, whereas the solutes are modeled using a
polarizable all atom force field. We focus our study on issues tied to two key
parameters of the pppl approach, namely the extension of the solvent domain SD
at the close vicinity of a solute (domain in which each solvent particle
corresponds to a single water molecule) and the magnitude of solute/solvent
short range polarization damping effects. To this end we built a new pppl
models from which we simulate NaCl aqueous solutions at the molar concentration
scale. We also re investigate the hydration of a hydrophobic polyelectrolyte
polymer that we showed in an earlier study [J Chem Phys, 114903 (155) 2021] to
evolve towards a counter intuitive globular form surrounded by a spherical
counter ion cloud along pppl-based simulations. Strong short range damping is
pivotal to simulate NaCl aqueous solutions. The extension of the domain SD (as
well as short range damping) has a weak effect on the conformation of the
polymer, but it plays a pivotal role to compute accurate solute/solvent
interaction energies. In all our results lead us to recommend to simulate
polyelectrolyte polymers as dissolved alone in pppl fluids (i.e. without
explicitly accounting for their counter ions) to investigate their behavior at
infinite dilution conditions, and to systematically consider strong
solute/solvent polarization short range damping to model charged species.

<p>We explore the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation in two and
one-dimensional Dunkl-boson gases confined within a power-law potential,
employing the framework of Dunkl-deformed boson theory. Our investigation
involves the calculation of particle numbers and phase transition temperatures
using the Dunkl formalism. To assess the validity of our findings, we compare
them with the corresponding results obtained from the standard approach. We
find that the impact of the Dunkl-formalism on the condensate fractions is
similar in one and two-dimensional cases. However, we see that this conclusion
is not fully valid for the phase transition temperature.

<br>
<i>Yun-Pin Chiu, Hsin-Wen Huang, Yuh-Renn Wu</i>
<p>Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (JTMDs) have attracted much attention
because of their outstanding electronic and optical properties. The additional
out-of-plane dipole in JTMDs can form n- and p-like Ohmic contacts, and this
may be used in device applications such as pin diodes and photovoltaic cells.
In this study, we exploit this property to design n- and p-type
metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs). First, we use
density-functional theory calculations to study the inherent dipole field
strength in the trilayer JTMD MoSSe. The intrinsic dipole of MoSSe causes band
bending at both the metal/MoSSe and MoSSe/metal interfaces, resulting in
electron and hole accumulation to form n- and p-type Ohmic contact regions. We
incorporate this property into a 2D finite-element-based
Poisson-drift-diffusion solver to perform simulations, on the basis of which we
design complementary MOSFETs. Our results demonstrate that JTMDs can be used to
make n- and p-MOSFETs in the same layer without the need for any extra doping.

<h3>An accurate machine learning interatomic potential for FCC and HCP  nickel</h3>

<br>
<i>Xiaoguo Gong, Zhuoyuan Li, A. S. L. Subrahmanyam Pattamatta, Tongqi Wen, David J. Srolovitz</i>
<p>Nickel (Ni) is a commonly used metal and critical component in various
structural alloys such as superalloys. It exhibits two allotropy phases, namely
stable face-centered cubic (FCC) and metastable hexagonal close-packed (HCP)
phases. Recent studies, both experimental and computational, have focused on
the phase transformation and defect properties in allotropic Ni. However,
accurate density functional theory (DFT) calculations are computationally
inefficient and insufficient for studying the material behavior which often
necessitates the system size exceeding one thousand atoms and simulation time
surpassing one nanosecond. In this study, we implement a straightforward
strategy to deal with atomic spin polarization in Ni for developing a
machine-learning Deep Potential (DP) model for Ni FCC and HCP phases, using
training datasets derived from spin-polarized DFT calculations. The resulting
DP-Ni model demonstrates high transferability and representability across
various properties among allotropies, such as (finite-temperature) lattice
parameters, elastic constants, phonon spectra, and defect properties. The
examination of the FCC-HCP allotropic transition under uniaxial tensile
conditions unveiled a substantial critical strain requirement, in which the
orientation relationship is {100}FCC // {0001}HCP and <010>FCC // <11-20>HCP.
The DP-Ni model not only facilitates accurate large-scale atomistic simulations
for complex mechanical behaviors, but also serves as a foundation for
developing interatomic potentials for Ni-based superalloys and other
multi-principal component alloys.

<i>Bing Yang, Yanting Wang</i>
<p>Flocking and vortical are two typical motion modes in active matter. Although
it is known that the two modes can spontaneously switch between each other in a
finite-size system, the switching dynamics remain elusive. In this work, by
computer simulation of a two-dimensional Vicsek-like system with 1000
particles, we find from the perspective of classical nucleation theory that the
forward and backward switching dynamics are asymmetric: from flocking to
vortical is a one-step nucleation process, while the opposite is a two-step
nucleation process with the system staying in a metastable state before
reaching the final flocking state.

<i>Kousuke Nakano, Michele Casula, Giacomo Tenti</i>
<p>Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is a state-of-the-art numerical approach
for evaluating accurate expectation values of many-body wavefunctions. However,
one of the major drawbacks that still hinders widespread QMC applications is
the lack of an affordable scheme to compute unbiased atomic forces. In this
study, we propose a very efficient method to obtain unbiased atomic forces and
pressures in the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) framework with the
Jastrow-correlated Slater determinant ansatz, exploiting the gauge-invariant
and locality properties of its geminal representation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for H$_2$ and Cl$_2$ molecules and for the cubic
boron nitride crystal. Our framework has a better algorithmic scaling with the
system size than the traditional finite-difference method, and, in practical
applications, is as efficient as single-point VMC calculations. Thus, it paves
the way to study dynamical properties of materials, such as phonons, and is
beneficial for pursuing more reliable machine-learning interatomic potentials
based on unbiased VMC forces.

<br>
<i>Ji-Hui Pei, Jin-Fu Chen, H. T. Quan</i>
<p>Fluctuation theorems establish connections between fluctuations and
irreversibility by considering stochastic thermodynamic quantities. In this
study, we derive special relativistic covariant fluctuation theorems by
defining covariant work, heat, and entropy. We focus on a driven scalar field
in contact with a Markovian heat bath. For moving inertial observers relative
to the heat bath, both the energy components and the momentum components of
work and heat must be included to formulate the corresponding fluctuation
theorems, and the four-velocity of the heat bath plays an important role. It
turns out that, the irreversibility is characterized by the conventional
thermodynamic quantities in the rest reference frame of the heat bath,
regardless of the reference frame of the observer. Even in the nonrelativistic
case, the above identification is nontrivial. We study the work statistics for
a Klein-Gordon field in a driving process measured by a moving inertial
observer to explicitly verify the covariant version of the Jarzynski equality.

<i>Joaquin Almeira, Tomas S. Grigera, Daniel A. Martin, Dante R. Chialvo, Sergio A. Cannas</i>
<p>We present a mean field solution of the dynamics of a Greenberg-Hastings
neural network with both excitatory and inhibitory units. We analyse the
dynamical phase transitions that appear in the stationary state as the model
parameters are varied. Analytical solutions are compared with numerical
simulations of the microscopic model defined on a fully connected network. We
found that the stationary state of this system exhibits a first order dynamical
phase transition (with the associated hysteresis) when the fraction of
inhibitory units $f< f_t \leq 1/2$, even for a finite system. In finite
systems, when $f > f_t$ the first order transition is replaced by a pseudo
critical one, namely a continuous crossover between regions of low and high
activity that resembles the finite size behaviour of a continuous phase
transition order parameter. However, in the thermodynamic limit, we found that
$f_t\to 1/2$ and the activity for $f\geq f_t$ becomes negligible for any value
of $T>0$, while the first order transition for $f<f_t$ remains.

<p>Light transition metals have recently emerged as a sustainable material class
for efficient spin-charge interconversion. We report measurements of
current-induced spin-orbit torques generated by Ni$_{1-x}$Cu$_{x}$ alloys in
perpendicularly magnetized ferrimagnetic Gd/Fe multilayers. We show that the
spin-orbit torque efficiency of Ni$_{1-x}$Cu$_{x}$ increases with the Ni/Cu
atomic ratio, reaching values comparable to those of Pt for Ni$_{55}$Cu$_{45}$.
Furthermore, we demonstrate magnetization switching of a 20-nm-thick Gd/Fe
multilayer with a threshold current that decreases with increasing Ni
concentration, similar to the spin-orbit torque efficiency. Our findings show
that Ni$_{1-x}$Cu$_{x}$$-$based magnetic heterostructures allow for efficient

<i>M.C. Gordillo</i>
<p>The structure of self-bound one-dimensional droplets containing a mixture of
Ytterbium fermionic isotopes ($^{173}$Yb, $^{171}$Yb) is calculated by means of
a diffusion Monte Carlo technique. We considered only balanced setups in which
all the atoms of one isotope are spin-polarized, while the atoms of the other
can have up to three different spin values, that difference being a necessary
requirement to achieve stable systems. Our results indicate that these droplets
consist of consecutive "molecules" made up of one $^{173}$Yb and one $^{171}$Yb
atom. In other words, we have up to three different kinds of composite bosons,
corresponding to the number of spin components in the non-polarized isotope.
The fermionic nature of those Yb atoms makes pairs with identical spin
composition avoid each other, creating a Pauli-like-hole filed by another
molecule in which at least one of the Yb atoms has a different spin from that
of their closest neighbors. This effective repulsion is akin to an
antiferromagnetic short-range interaction between different kinds of composite
bosons.

<br>
<i>Surasree Sadhukhan, Sudipta Kanungo</i>
<p>The coupling between electron orbital momentum and spin momentum, known as
spin-orbit coupling (SOC), is a fundamental origin of a multitude of
fascinating physical phenomena, especially it holds paramount significance in
the realm of topological materials. In our work, we have predicted the
topological phase in Hg-based chalcopyrite compounds using the first principles
density functional theory. The initial focus was on HgSnN 2 , revealing it to
be a nonmagnetic Weyl semimetal, while HgSnP 2 displayed characteristics of a
strong topological insulator. What makes our work truly unique is that despite
both compounds having the same SOC strength, arises from Hg, they exhibit
distinct topological phases due to the distinct hybridization effect of the
Hg-5d and X-p bands. This finding can address a significant factor, i.e., the
effect of the band hybridization in deriving distinct topological phases,
keeping the symmetry aspect intact. Our results indicate that due to the
presence of band hybridization between the dominant X-np orbitals n=2 and 3 for
X=N and P respectively and a minor contribution from Hg-5d, we can tune the
topological phase by manipulating SOC strength, which equivalently achievable
by chemical substitutions. This investigation stands as a remarkable
illustration of the unique roles that hybridization plays in sculpting the
topological properties of these compounds while simultaneously preserving their
underlying symmetries.

<h3>Chiral anomaly induced monopole current and nonlinear circular dichroism</h3>

<br>
<i>Nikolai Peshcherenko, Claudia Felser, Yang Zhang</i>
<p>We propose a topological probe for detecting chirality imbalance in time
reversal invariant Weyl and Dirac semimetals via nonlinear Hall response. The
chiral anomaly effect, occurring in parallel electric and magnetic fields,
causes a energy shift between Weyl cones of different chirality, which leads to
chirally asymmetric intra-node relaxation. Due to this asymmetry, nonlinear
Hall currents induced by Berry curvature in different Weyl nodes do not
perfectly compensate. Hence, the net current is determined by the quantized
monopole charge, weighted by the transport relaxation time. We predict that the
current arising from this chiral asymmetry could also be detected in nonlinear
circular dichroism measurements.

<br>
<i>Yihao Chen, Simon A. Rogers, Suresh Narayanan, James L. Harden, Robert L. Leheny</i>
<p>An intrinsic feature of disordered and out-of-equilibrium materials, such as
glasses, is the dependence of their properties on their history. An important
example is rheological memory, in which disordered solids obtain properties
based on their mechanical history. Here, we employ x-ray photon correlation
spectroscopy (XPCS) with \textit{in situ} rheometry to characterize memory
formation in a nanocolloidal soft glass due to cyclic shear. During a cycle,
particles undergo irreversible displacements composed of a combination of
shear-induced diffusion and strain fields. The magnitudes of these
displacements decrease with each cycle before reaching a steady state where the
microstructure has become trained to achieve enhanced reversibility. The
displacements resemble a random walk in which the directions in each cycle are
independent of those in preceding cycles. Associated with these displacements
is a gradual evolution in the amplidute of the residual stress after each cycle
towards a steady state value. Memory of this training is revealed by
measurements in which the amplitude of the shear is changed after steady state
is reached. The magnitude of the particle displacements as well as the change
in residual stress vary non-monotonically with the new strain amplitude, having
minima near the training amplitude, thereby revealing both microscopic and
macroscopic signatures of memory.

<p>We present an analytically solvable model for correlated electrons, which is
able to capture the major Fermi surface modifications occurring in both hole-
and electron-doped cuprates as a function of doping. The proposed Hamiltonian
qualitatively reproduces the results of numerically demanding many-body
calculations, here obtained using the dynamical vertex approximation. Our
analytical theory provides a transparent description of the formation of
disconnected segments along the Fermi surface (the highly debated "Fermi arcs")
as well as of the opening of a pseudogap at hole- and electron-doping. This
occurs through a specific mechanism: The electronic states on the Fermi arcs
remain intact, while the Fermi surface part where the gap opens transforms into
a Luttinger arc.

<p>A few years ago, a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) has been found
in Anderson and Kondo 2-channel spin-1 impurity models that include a hard-axis
anisotropy term $DS_z^2$ with $D > 0$. The most remarkable manifestation of the
TQPT is a jump in the spectral density of localized electrons, at the Fermi
level, from very high to very low values as $D$ is increased. If the two
conduction channels are equivalent, the transition takes place at the critical
anisotropy $D_c \sim 2.5\; T_K$, where $T_K$ is the Kondo temperature for
$D=0$. This jump might be important to develop a molecular transistor. The jump
is due to a corresponding one in the Luttinger integral, which has a
topological non-trivial value $\pi/2$ for $D > D_c$. Here, we review the main
results for the spectral density and highlight the significance of the theory
for the interpretation of measurements conducted on magnetic atoms or molecules
on metallic surfaces. In these experiments, where $D$ is held constant, the
energy scale $T_K$ is manipulated by some parameters. The resulting variation
gives rise to a differential conductance $dI/dV$, measured by
scanning-tunneling spectroscopy, which is consistent with a TQPT at an
intermediate value of $T_K$. We also show that the theory can be extended to
integer spin $S>1$ and two-impurity systems. This is also probably true for
half-integer spin and non-equivalent channels in some cases.

<h3>Evidence for $π$-shifted Cooper quartets in PbTe nanowire  three-terminal Josephson junctions</h3>

<p>Josephson junctions are typically characterized by a single phase difference
across two superconductors. This conventional two-terminal Josephson junction
can be generalized to a multi-terminal device where the Josephson energy
contains terms that result from entanglement of multiple independent phase
variables. It was recently proposed that such multi-terminal couplings should
result in a $\pi$-shifted quartet supercurrent. We show for the first time
experimental signature of this $\pi$-shifted supercurrent, by using a
three-terminal Josephson junction based on selective-area-grown PbTe nanowires.
We further observe conductance steps at zero magnetic field co-existent with
supercurrent in both two- and three-terminal devices, indicating ballistic
superconductivity in the few quantum modes regime. Superconducting transport in
the few-modes regime is a necessary condition for realizing topologically
protected bound states such as Majorana zero modes in one-dimensional nanowires
and Weyl nodes in multi-terminal Josephson junctions.

<p>Developing novel lead-free ferroelectric materials is crucial for
next-generation microelectronic technologies that are energy efficient and
environment friendly. However, materials discovery and property optimization
are typically time-consuming due to the limited throughput of traditional
synthesis methods. In this work, we use a high-throughput combinatorial
synthesis approach to fabricate lead-free ferroelectric superlattices and solid
solutions of (Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 (BCT) and Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 (BZT) phases with
continuous variation of composition and layer thickness. High-resolution X-ray
diffraction (XRD) and analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM) demonstrate high film quality and well-controlled compositional
gradients. Ferroelectric and dielectric property measurements identify the
optimal property point achieved at the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) with a
composition of 48BZT-52BCT. Displacement vector maps reveal that ferroelectric
domain sizes are tunable by varying {BCT-BZT}N superlattice geometry. This
high-throughput synthesis approach can be applied to many other material
systems to expedite new materials discovery and properties optimization,
allowing for the exploration of a large area of phase space within a single
growth.

<h3>Surface fields and emergence of long-range couplings in classical  uniaxial ferromagnetic arrays</h3>

<p>Critical wetting is of crucial importance for the phase behaviour of a simple
fluid or Ising magnet confined between walls that exert opposing surface fields
so that one wall favours liquid (spin up), while the other favours gas (spin
down). We show that arrays of boxes filled with fluid or Ising magnet and
linked by channels with such ``opposing'' walls can exhibit long-range
cooperative effects, on a length scale far exceeding the bulk correlation
length. We give the theoretical foundations of these long-range couplings by
using a lattice gas (Ising model) description of a system.

<h3>Contrastive learning through non-equilibrium memory</h3>

<i>Martin Falk, Adam Strupp, Benjamin Scellier, Arvind Murugan</i>
<p>Learning algorithms based on backpropagation have enabled transformative
technological advances but alternatives based on local energy-based rules offer
benefits in terms of biological plausibility and decentralized training. A
broad class of such local learning rules involve \textit{contrasting} a clamped
configuration with the free, spontaneous behavior of the system. However,
comparisons of clamped and free configurations require explicit memory or
switching between Hebbian and anti-Hebbian modes. Here, we show how a simple
form of implicit non-equilibrium memory in the update dynamics of each
``synapse'' of a network naturally allows for contrastive learning. During
training, free and clamped behaviors are shown in sequence over time using a
sawtooth-like temporal protocol that breaks the symmetry between those two
behaviors when combined with non-equilibrium update dynamics at each synapse.
We show that the needed dynamics is implicit in integral feedback control,
broadening the range of physical and biological systems naturally capable of
contrastive learning. Finally, we show that non-equilibrium dissipation
improves learning quality and determine the Landauer energy cost of contrastive
learning through physical dynamics.

<h3>Universality classes for purification in nonunitary quantum processes</h3>

<p>We consider universal aspects of two problems: (I) the slow purification of a
large number of qubits by repeated quantum measurements, and (II) the singular
value structure of a product ${m_t m_{t-1}\ldots m_1}$ of many large random
matrices. Each kind of process is associated with the decay of natural measures
of entropy as a function of time or of the number of matrices in the product.
We argue that, for a broad class of models, each process is described by
universal scaling forms for purification, and that (I) and (II) represent
distinct ``universality classes'' with distinct scaling functions. Using the
replica trick, these universality classes correspond to one-dimensional
effective statistical mechanics models for a gas of ``kinks'', representing
domain walls between elements of the permutation group. (This is an instructive
low-dimensional limit of the effective statistical mechanics models for random
circuits and tensor networks.) These results apply to long-time purification in
spatially local monitored circuit models on the entangled side of the
measurement phase transition.
