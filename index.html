We solve a hydrodynamic model of active chromatin dynamics, within a confined
geometry simulating the cell nucleus. Using both analytical and numerical
methods, we describe the behavior of the chromatin polymer driven by the
activity of motors having polar symmetry, both in the linear response regime as
well as in the long-term, fully nonlinear regime of the flows. The introduction
of a boundary induces a particular geometry in the flows of chromatin, which we
describe using vector spherical harmonics, a tool which greatly simplifies both
our analytical and numerical approaches. We find that the long-term behavior of
this model in confinement is dominated by steady, transverse flows of chromatin
which circulate around the spherical domain. These circulating flows are found
to be robust to perturbations, and their characteristic size is set by the size
of the domain. This gives us further insight into active chromatin dynamics in
the cell nucleus, and provides a foundation for development of further, more
complex models of active chromatin dynamics.

<h3>A Chern-Simons theory for dipole symmetry</h3>

We present effective field theories for dipole symmetric topological matters
that can be described by the Chern-Simons theory. Unlike most studies using
higher-rank gauge theory, we develop a framework with both U(1) and dipole
gauge fields. As a result, only the highest multipole symmetry can support the
t' Hooft anomaly. We show that with appropriate point group symmetries, the
dipolar Chern-Simons theory can exist in any dimension and, moreover, the
bulk-edge correspondence can depend on the boundary. As two applications, we
draw an analogy between the dipole anomaly and the torsional anomaly and
generalize particle-vortex duality to dipole phase transitions. All of the
above are in the flat spacetime limit, but our framework is able to
systematically couple dipole symmetry to curved spacetime. Based on that, we
give a proposal about anomalous dipole hydrodynamics. Moreover, we show that
the fracton-elasticity duality arises naturally from a non-abelian Chern-Simons
theory in 3D.

Two-dimensional Fermi systems is an appealing platform to explore
exceptionally long-lived excitations arising due to collinear scattering
governed by phase-space constraints. Recently it was shown that the lifetimes
of these excitations surpass the fundamental bound set by Landau's Fermi-liquid
theory by a factor as large as $(T_F/T)^\alpha$ with $\alpha\approx 2$. As
always, long-lived degrees of freedom can amplify the response to a weak
perturbation, producing long-lasting collective memory effects. This leads to
new hydrodynamics in 2D electron fluids, which includes several viscous modes
with non-newtonian viscosity not anticipated by previous work. Here we present
a detailed analysis of these modes and and discuss their experimental
implications.

<h3>Theory of shot noise in strange metals</h3>

<br>
<i>Alexander Nikolaenko, Subir Sachdev, Aavishkar A. Patel</i>

We extend the theory of shot noise in metals to shot noise in strange metals
without quasiparticle excitations. This requires a generalization of the
Boltzmann equation with a noise source to distribution functions which depend
independently on the excitation momentum and energy. We apply this theory to a
model of a strange metal describing a Fermi surface with a spatially random
Yukawa coupling to a critical boson. We find a suppression of the Fano factor
in the strange metal, and describe the dependence of the shot noise on
temperature and applied voltage. At low temperatures, we obtain a Fano factor
equal to $1/6$, in contrast to the $1/3$ Fano factor in diffusive metals with
quasiparticles. Our results are in general agreement with recent observations
by Chen et al. (arXiv:2206.00673).

<h3>Nontrivial Quantum Geometry and the Strength of Electron-Phonon Coupling</h3>

The coupling of electrons to phonons (electron-phonon coupling) is crucial
for the existence of various phases of matter, in particular superconductivity
and density waves. While the consequences of nontrivial quantum
geometry/topology are well-established in electronic bands, countless studies
of the bulk electron-phonon coupling strength performed in the pre-topological
era missed a crucial aspect of multi-band electron systems coupled to phonons:
the effect of electron band geometry and/or topology on the electron-phonon
coupling. We devise a theory that incorporates the quantum geometry of the
electron bands into the electron-phonon coupling. We find that the Fubini-Study
quantum metric contributes indispensably to the dimensionless electron-phonon
coupling constant, and we generalize the fundamental concept of quantum
geometry to take into account orbital selective quantities, which also can play
a dominant role in the electron-phonon coupling. More specifically, we show, in
a simple analytic model, why the electron quantum geometry is essential to a
deep understanding of the bulk electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we apply
the theory to two of the famous materials, graphene and MgB$_2$ where the
geometric contributions account for approximately 50% and 90% of the total
electron-phonon coupling constant, respectively. The quantum geometric
contributions in the two systems are further bounded from below by topological
contributions, arising from the winding numbers of nodal points/lines or the
effective Euler number -- topological aspects previously unknown in MgB$_2$.
Given that MgB$_2$ is a phonon-mediated superconductor with critical
temperature about 39K, our results suggest that the nontrivial electron band
geometry/topology might favor superconductivity with relatively high critical
temperature.

<h3>Failure of Topological Invariants in Strongly Correlated Matter</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We show exactly that standard `invariants' advocated to define topology for
non-interacting systems deviate strongly from the Hall conductance whenever the
excitation spectrum contains zeros of the single-particle Green function, $G$,
as in general strongly correlated systems. Namely, we show that if the chemical
potential sits atop the valence band, the `invariant' changes without even
accessing the conduction band but by simply traversing the band of zeros that
might lie between the two bands. Since such a process does not change the
many-body ground state, the Hall conductance remains fixed. This disconnect
with the Hall conductance arises from the replacement of the Hamiltonian,
$h(\bb k)$, with $G^{-1}$ in the current operator, thereby laying plain why
perturbative arguments fail.

<h3>Kinetic-to-magnetic frustration crossover and linear confinement in the  doped triangular $t-J$ model</h3>

Microscopically understanding competing orders in strongly correlated systems
is a key challenge in modern quantum many-body physics. For example, the study
of magnetic polarons and their relation to pairing in the Fermi-Hubbard model
in different geometries remains one of the central questions, and may help to
understand the mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity in
cuprates or transition metal dichalcogenides. With recent advances in analog
quantum simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model on non-bipartite lattices,
frustrated physics can now be explored experimentally in systems lacking
particle-hole symmetry. Here, we study the singly doped $t-J$ model on the
triangular lattice, focusing on the competition between kinetic and magnetic
frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover
a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high
temperature and exchange mediated antiferromagnetic (AFM) order around the
doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic
Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions
at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic
correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence
of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates
confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the
presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments,
supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$
model.

<h3>Absence of Mobility Edge in Short-range Uncorrelated Disordered Model:  Coexistence of Localized and Extended States</h3>

Unlike the well-known Mott's argument that extended and localized states
should not coexist at the same energy in a generic random potential, we provide
an example of a nearest-neighbor tight-binding disordered model which carries
both localized and extended states without forming the mobility edge (ME).
Unexpectedly, this example appears to be given by a well-studied
$\beta$-ensemble with independently distributed random diagonal potential and
inhomogeneous kinetic hopping terms. In order to analytically tackle the
problem, we locally map the above model to the 1D Anderson model with
matrix-size- and position-dependent hopping and confirm the coexistence of
localized and extended states, which is shown to be robust to the perturbations
of both potential and kinetic terms due to the separation of the above states
in space. In addition, the mapping shows that the extended states are
non-ergodic and allows to analytically estimate their fractal dimensions.

<h3>Universal Hypothesis of Autocorrelation Function from Krylov Complexity</h3>

In a quantum many-body system, autocorrelation functions can determine linear
responses nearby equilibrium and quantum dynamics far from equilibrium. In this
letter, we bring out the connection between the operator complexity and the
autocorrelation function. In particular, we focus on a particular kind of
operator complexity called the Krylov complexity. We find that a set of Lanczos
coefficients $\{b_n\}$ computed for determining the Krylov complexity can
reveal the universal behaviors of autocorrelations, which are otherwise
impossible. When the time axis is scaled by $b_1$, different autocorrelation
functions obey a universal function form at short time. We further propose a
characteristic parameter deduced from $\{b_n\}$ that can largely determine the
behavior of autocorrelations at the intermediate time. This parameter can also
largely determine whether the autocorrelation function oscillates or
monotonically decays in time. We present numerical evidences and physical
intuitions to support these universal hypotheses of autocorrelations. We
emphasize that these universal behaviors are held across different operators
and different physical systems.

<h3>Universal Aspect of Relaxation Dynamics in Random Spin Models</h3>

The concept of universality is a powerful tool in modern physics, allowing us
to capture the essential features of a system's behavior using a small set of
parameters. In this letter, we unveil universal spin relaxation dynamics in
anisotropic random Heisenberg models with infinite-range interactions at high
temperatures. Starting from a polarized state, the total magnetization can
relax monotonically or decay with long-lived oscillations, determined by the
sign of a universal single function $A=-\xi_1^2+\xi_2^2-4\xi_2\xi_3+\xi_3^2$.
Here $(\xi_1,\xi_3,\xi_3)$ characterizes the anisotropy of the Heisenberg
interaction. Furthermore, the oscillation shows up only for $A>0$, with
frequency $\Omega \propto \sqrt{A}$. To validate our theory, we compare it to
numerical simulations by solving the Kadanoff-Baym (KB) equation with a melon
diagram approximation and the exact diagonalization (ED). The results show our
theoretical prediction works in both cases, regardless of a small system size
$N=8$ in ED simulations. Our study sheds light on the universal aspect of
quantum many-body dynamics.

<h3>Ion Transport Mechanisms in Pectin-containing EC-LiTFSI Electrolytes</h3>

Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we report the structure and
ion transport characteristics of a new class of solid polymer electrolytes that
contain biodegradable and mechanically stable biopolymer pectin. We simulate a
highly conducting ethylene carbonate (EC) as a solvent for
lithium-trifluoromethanesulfonimide (LiTFSI) salt containing different weight
percentages of pectin. Our simulations reveal that the pectin chains reduce the
coordination numbers of lithium ions around the counterions (and vice-versa)
because of stronger lithium-pectin interactions compared to lithium-TFSI
interactions. Further, the pectin is found to promote smaller ionic aggregates
over larger ones, contrary to results typically reported for liquid and polymer
electrolytes. We observe that the loading of pectin in EC-LiTFSI electrolytes
increases the viscosity ($\eta$) and relaxation timescales ($\tau_c$),
indicating higher mechanical stability and, consequently, the mean squared
displacements, diffusion coefficients (D), and the Nernst-Einstein conductivity
($\sigma_{NE}$) decrease. Interestingly, while the lithium diffusivities are
related to the ion-pair relaxation timescales as $D_+\sim \tau_c^{-3.1}$, the
TFSI$^-$ diffusivities exhibit excellent correlations with ion-pair relaxation
timescales as $D_-\sim \tau_c^{-0.95}$. On the other hand, the NE
conductivities are dictated by distinct transport mechanisms and scales with
ion-pair relaxation timescale as $\sigma_{NE}\sim \tau_c^{-1.85}$.

<h3>Universal sublinear resistivity in vanadium kagome materials hosting  charge density waves</h3>

The kagome system of ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ displays a transition towards a charge
density (CDW) state at $T_{\textrm{CDW}}$ = 91 K. By comparing to the
isostructural non-CDW compound LuV$_6$Sn$_6$, we unravel interesting electrical
transport properties in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, above and below the charge ordering
temperature.
We observed that by applying a magnetic field along the $a$ axis, the
temperature behavior of the longitudinal resistivity in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ changes
from metal-like to insulator-like up to 200 K above the CDW transition. We
observe an anomalous Hall-like behavior in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ below
$T_{\textrm{CDW}}$, which is absent in the Lu compound.
We further show that in the charge ordered state ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ follows the
Fermi liquid behavior while above that, it transforms into a non-Fermi liquid
phase in which the resistivity varies sublinearly over a broad temperature
range. The sublinear resistivity is a common feature among other
vanadium-containing kagome compounds exhibiting charge density waves. Comparing
the transport properties ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ and LuV$_6$Sn$_6$ is valuable to
highlight the impacts of the unusual CDW in the Sc compound.

<h3>Bridging Heterogeneity Dictates the Microstructure and Yielding Response  of Polymer-Linked Emulsions</h3>

Soft materials possessing tunable rheological properties are desirable in
applications ranging from 3D printing to biological scaffolds. Here, we use a
telechelic, triblock copolymer polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide)-b-polystyrene
(SEOS) to form elastic networks of polymer-linked droplets in
cyclohexane-in-water emulsions. The SEOS endblocks partition into the dispersed
cyclohexane droplets while the midblocks remain in the aqueous continuous
phase, resulting in each chain taking on either a looping or bridging
conformation. We examine the yield transition of these polymer-linked emulsions
through large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) and probe the emulsion
structure through confocal microscopy, concluding that polymers that more
readily form bridges generate a strongly percolated network, whereas those that
are less prone to form bridges tend to produce networks composed of
weakly-linked clusters of droplets. When yielded, the emulsions consisting of
linked clusters break apart into individual clusters that can rearrange upon
the application of further shear. By contrast, when the systems containing a
more homogeneous bridging density are yielded, the system remains percolated
but with a reduced elasticity and bridging density. The demonstrated ability of
telechelic triblock copolymers to tune not only the linear viscoelasticity of
complex fluids but also their nonlinear yield transition enables the use of
these polymers as versatile and robust rheological modifiers. We expect our
findings to therefore aid the design of the next generation of complex fluids
and soft materials.

<h3>Replicating Higgs fields in Ising gauge theory: the registry order</h3>

We consider $Z_2$ gauge field theory coupled to "Higgs" matter fields
invoking several copies of such matter, interacting entirely through the gauge
fields, the $Z_2 \times Z_2 \times Z_2\cdots / Z_2$ and the $O(N) \times O(N)
\times O(N) \cdots / Z_2$ families of theories. We discover that the Higgs
phase of such theories is characterized by a hitherto unidentified "registry"
order parameter. This is characterized by a gauge invariant $p =
2^{N_{\text{rep}}}/2$ Potts type symmetry where $N_{\text{rep}}$ is the number
of matter copies. The meaning of this registry is that the different matter
copies align their vectors locally in strictly parallel or anti-parallel
fashion, even dealing with the continuous $O(2)$ symmetry. Supported by
Monte-Carlo simulations, we identify the origin of this registry order in terms
of the gauge interactions mediated by the fluxes ("visons") associated with the
$Z_2$ gauge fields, indirectly imposing the discrete symmetry in the gauge
invariant global symmetry controlled effective order parameter theory. In
addition, it appears that our simulations reveal a hitherto unidentified
"pseudo-universality" associated with the very similar form of the overall
phase diagrams of the various theories suggesting a remarkable "governance" by
the gauge field part of the dynamics.

<br>
The metallic compound Mn$_5$Si$_3$ hosts a series of antiferromagnetic phases
which can be controlled by external stimuli such as temperature and magnetic
field. In this work, we investigate the spin-excitation spectrum of bulk
Mn$_5$Si$_3$ by combining inelastic neutron scattering measurements and density
functional theory calculations. We study the evolution of the dynamical
response under external parameters and demonstrate that the spin dynamics of
each phase is robust against any combination of temperature and magnetic field.
In particular, the high-energy spin dynamics is very characteristic of the
different phases consisting of either spin waves or broad fluctuations
patterns.

<h3>Catastrophic magnetic flux avalanches in NbTiN superconducting  resonators</h3>

<br>
The impact of the magnetic field penetration on the resonance frequency of
NbTiN superconducting resonators is investigated by a combination of
magneto-optical imaging and high-frequency measurements. At temperatures below
approximately half of the superconducting critical temperature, the development
of magnetic flux avalanches manifests itself as jumps in the resonance
frequency of the coplanar resonators. A clear change in the rate of decreasing
resonance frequency with magnetic field is observed when a magnetic perforation
event regime sets the transition between a Meissner-like phase in the ground
plane and flux injection into the central feedline. These regimes are directly
visualized by magneto-optical imaging and the impact of avalanches in the
ground plane and the resonator is discerned. At high working temperatures, a
smooth flux penetration is shown to prevail. We propose some hints and
strategies to mitigate the influence of avalanches on the response of the
resonators and to improve the magnetic resilience of coplanar resonators. Our
findings demonstrate that superconducting resonators represent a valuable tool
to investigate the magnetic flux dynamics in superconducting materials.
Moreover, the current blooming of niobiumbased superconducting radio-frequency
devices makes this report timely by unveiling the severe implications of
magnetic flux dynamics.

<h3>Quantum phase transition between symmetry enriched topological phases in  tensor-network states</h3>

Quantum phase transitions between different topologically ordered phases
exhibit rich structures and are generically challenging to study in microscopic
lattice models. In this work, we propose a tensor-network solvable model that
allows us to tune between different symmetry enriched topological (SET) phases.
Concretely, we consider a decorated two-dimensional toric code model for which
the ground state can be expressed as a two-dimensional tensor-network state
with bond dimension $D=3$ and two tunable parameters. We find that the
time-reversal (TR) symmetric system exhibits three distinct phases (i) an SET
toric code phase in which anyons transform non-trivially under TR, (ii) a toric
code phase in which TR does not fractionalize, and (iii) a topologically
trivial phase that is adiabatically connected to a product state. We
characterize the different phases using the topological entanglement entropy
and a membrane order parameter that distinguishes the two SET phases. Along the
phase boundary between the SET toric code phase and the toric code phase, the
model has an enhanced $U(1)$ symmetry and the ground state is a quantum
critical loop gas wavefunction whose squared norm is equivalent to the
partition function of the classical $O(2)$ model. By duality transformations,
this tensor-network solvable model can also be used to describe transitions
between SET double-semion phases and between $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$

The simplicity of hard spheres as a model system is deceptive. Although
particles interact solely through volume exclusion, that suffices for a wealth
of static and dynamical phenomena to emerge, making the model an important
target for achieving a comprehensive understanding of matter. In addition,
while real colloidal suspensions are typically governed by complex
interactions, Pusey and Van Megen [Nature 320 340-342 (1986)] have demonstrated
that carefully tuning these interactions can result in hard-sphere--like
suspensions, thus bringing a valuable experimental complement to the celebrated
theoretical model. Colloidal hard spheres are a material in their own right as
well as a platform in which phenomena exhibited by simple materials can be
explored in great detail. These various purposes enable a particular synergy
between experiment, theory and computer simulation. Here we review the
extensive body of work on hard spheres, ranging from their equilibrium
properties such as phase behavior, interfaces and confinement to
non--equilibrium phenomena they exhibit such as sedimentation, glass formation
and nucleation.

SmB6 is a mixed-valence compound with flat f-electron bands that have a
propensity to magnetism. Since the paramagnetic phase of SmB6 has a nontrivial
Z2 topology, one may expect interesting band topologies for the magnetic phases
too. Here we show that as the Sm valence increases with pressure, SmB6
undergoes a first-order phase transition into a metallic antiferromagnetic
state, whose symmetry depends on the model parameters. The magnetic orderings
give rise to distinct band topologies: while the A-type order leads to an
overlap between valence and conduction bands in the form of Dirac nodal lines,
the G-type order has a negative indirect gap with weak Z2 indices. We also
investigate the spin polarized phase, which can be realized in a strong
magnetic field, and find that it exhibits Weyl points as well as nodal lines
close to the Fermi level. The magnetic phases show markedly different surface
states and tunable bulk transport properties, with important implications for
experiments.

<br>
<br>
Surface structures on radio-frequency (RF) superconductors are crucially
important in determining their interaction with the RF field. Here we
investigate the surface compositions, structural profiles, and valence
distributions of oxides, carbides, and impurities on niobium (Nb) and Nb3Sn in
situ under different processing conditions. We establish the underlying
mechanisms of vacuum baking and nitrogen-processing in Nb and demonstrate that
carbide formation induced during high-temperature baking, regardless of gas
environment, determines subsequent oxide formation upon air exposure or
low-temperature baking, leading to modifications of the electron population
profile. Also, we observe that vapor-diffused Nb3Sn contains thick metastable
oxides, while electrochemically synthesized Nb3Sn only has a thin oxide layer.
Our findings reveal fundamental mechanisms of baking and processing Nb and
Nb3Sn surface structures for high-performance superconducting RF and quantum
applications.

Topological insulator lie at the forefront of condensed matter physics.
However strong disorder can destroy the topological states and make all states
become localized. In this paper, we investigate the competition between
topology and localization in the one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)
model with controllable off-diagonal quasi-periodic modulations on
superconducting circuits. By utilizing external ac magnetic fluxes, each
transmon can be driven and all coupling strengths can be tuned independently.
Based on this model we construct phase diagrams that illustrate the extended
topologically nontrivial, critical localization, and coexisting topological and
critical localization phases. The dynamics of the qubits' excitations are also
discussed in this paper, revealing distinct quantum state transfers resulting
from the interplay between topology and localization. Furthermore, we propose a
method for detecting different quantum phases using current experimental
setups.

<br>
The few-body problem (with $N \leq 6$ fermionic charge carriers) in isolated
Moir\'{e} quantum dots in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superlattices
with integral fillings, $\nu > 1$, is investigated by employing large-scale
configuration interaction (exact-diagonalization) computations, and by
performing a comparative analysis of the ensuing first-order (charge densities,
CDs) and second-order (conditional probability distributions, CPDs) correlation
functions. Our investigations reveal the determining role of the strong
inter-particle Coulombic repulsion in bringing about Wigner molecularization,
which is associated with many-body physics beyond both that described by the
aufbau principle of natural atoms, as well as by the widely used Hubbard model
for strongly-interacting condensed-matter systems. In particular, our use of
the CPDs brings to light the geometrical polygonal-ring configurations
underlying the Wigner molecules (WMs) that remain hidden at the level of a
charge-density analysis, apart from the case of $N=3$ when a pinned WM emerges
in the charge density due to the coincidence of the $C_3$ symmetries associated
with both the WM intrinsic geometry and that of the confining TMD potential.

Electric manipulation of skyrmions in 2D magnetic materials has garnered
significant attention due to the potential in energy-efficient spintronic
devices. In this work, using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo
simulations, we report the electric-field-tunable magnetic skyrmions in
MnIn2Te4 monolayer. By adjusting the magnetic parameters, including the
Heisenberg exchange interaction, DMI, and MAE, through applying an electric
field, the formation or annihilation of skyrmions can be achieved. Our work
suggests a platform for experimental realization of the electric-field-tunable
magnetic skyrmions in 2D magnets.

<h3>A fresh look at the vibrational and thermodynamic properties of liquids  within the soft potential model</h3>

<br>
<br>
Contrary to the case of solids and gases, where Debye theory and kinetic
theory offer a good description for most of the physical properties, a complete
theoretical understanding of the vibrational and thermodynamic properties of
liquids is still missing. Liquids exhibit a density of state (VDOS) which does
not obey Debye law, and a heat capacity which decreases monotonically with
temperature, rather than growing as in solids. Despite several attempts, a
complete and widely accepted theoretical framework able to formally derive the
aforementioned properties has not been found yet. Here, we revisit one of the
theoretical proposals, and in particular we re-analyze the properties of
liquids within the soft-potential model, originally formulated for glasses. We
confirm that, at least at a qualitative level, many characteristic properties
of liquids can be rationalized within this model. We discuss the validity of
several phenomenological expressions proposed in the literature for the density
of unstable modes, and in particular for its temperature and frequency
dependence. We discuss the role of negative curvature regions and unstable
modes as fundamental ingredients to have a linear in frequency VDOS. Finally,
we compute the heat capacity within the soft potential model for liquids and we
show that it decreases with temperature, in agreement with experimental and
simulation data.

Two-particle lattice states are important for physics of magnetism,
superconducting oxides, and cold quantum gases. The quantum-mechanical lattice
problem is exactly solvable for finite-range interaction potentials. A two-body
Schroedinder equation can be reduced to a system of linear equations whose
numbers scale with the number of interacting sites. For the simplest cases such
as on-site or nearest-neighbor attractions, many pair properties can be derived
analytically, although final expressions can be quite complicated. In this
work, we systematically investigate bound pairs in one-, two-, and
three-dimensional lattices. We derive pairing conditions, plot phase diagrams,
and compute effective masses, radii, and energies. Along the way, we analyze
nontrivial physical effects such as light pairs and the dependence of binding
thresholds on pair momenta. At the end, we discuss the preformed-pair mechanism
of superconductivity and stability of many-pair systems against phase
separation. The paper is a combination of original work and pedagogical
tutorial.

<h3>Ultra-high-density double-atom catalyst with spin moment as activity  descriptor for oxygen reduction reaction</h3>

<br>
<br>
One of the great challenges facing atomically dispersed catalysts, including
single-atom catalyst (SAC) and double-atom catalyst (DAC) is their ultra-low
metal loading (typically less than 5 wt%), basically limiting the practical
catalytic application, such as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) crucial to
hydrogen fuel cell and metal-air battery. Although some important progresses
have been achieved on ultra-high-density (UHD) SACs, the reports on UHD-DACs
with stable uniform dispersion is still lacking. Herein, based on the
experimentally synthesized M2N6 motif (M = Sc-Zn), we theoretically
demonstrated the existence of the UHD-DACs with the metal loading > 40 wt%,
which were confirmed by systematic analysis of dynamic, thermal, mechanical,
thermodynamic, and electrochemical stabilities. Furthermore, ORR activities of
the UHD-DACs are comparable with or even better than those of the
experimentally synthesized low-density (LD) counterparts, and the Fe2N6 and
Co2N6 UHD-DACs locate at the peak of the activity volcano with ultra-low
overpotentials of 0.31 and 0.33 V, respectively. Finally, spin magnetic moment
of active center is found to be a catalytic descriptor for ORR on the DACs. Our
work will stimulate the experimental exploration of the ultra-high-density DACs
and provides the novel insight into the relationship between ORR activity of
the DACs and their spin states.

<br>
<br>
Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is a powerful tool for
probing the momentum-resolved single-particle spectral function of materials.
Historically, $\textit{in situ}$ magnetic fields have been carefully avoided as
they are detrimental to the control of photoelectron trajectory during the
photoelectron detection process. However, magnetic field is an important
experimental knob for both probing and tuning symmetry-breaking phases and
electronic topology in quantum materials. In this paper, we introduce an easily
implementable method for realizing an $\textit{in situ}$ tunable magnetic field
at the sample position in an ARPES experiment and analyze magnetic field
induced artifacts in ARPES data. Specifically, we identified and quantified
three distinct extrinsic effects of a magnetic field: Fermi surface rotation,
momentum shrinking, and momentum broadening. We examined these effects in three
prototypical quantum materials, i.e., a topological insulator (Bi$_2$Se$_3$),
an iron-based superconductor (LiFeAs), and a cuprate superconductor
(Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$), and demonstrate the feasibility of ARPES
measurements in the presence of a controllable magnetic field. Our studies lay
the foundation for the future development of the technique and interpretation
of ARPES measurements of field-tunable quantum phases.

Topological solitons are crucial to many branches of physics, such as models
of fundamental particles in quantum field theory, information carriers in
nonlinear optics, and elementary entities in quantum and classical
computations. Chiral magnetic materials are a fertile ground for studying
solitons. In the past a few years, a huge number of all kinds of topologically
protected localized magnetic solitons have been found. The number is so large,
and a proper organization and classification is necessary for their future
developments. Here we show that many topological magnetic solitons can be
understood from the duality of particle and elastic continuum-medium nature of
skyrmions. In contrast to the common belief that a skyrmion is an elementary
particle that is indivisible, skyrmions behave like both particle and continuum
media that can be tore apart to bury other objects, reminiscing particle-wave
duality in quantum mechanics. Skyrmions, like indivisible particles, can be
building blocks for cascade skyrmion bags and target skyrmions. They can also
act as bags and glues to hold one or more skyrmions together. The principles
and rules for stable composite skyrmions are explained and presented, revealing
their rich and interesting physics.

<br>
<br>
Chalcogenides, which refer to chalcogen anions, have attracted considerable
attention in multiple fields of applications, such as optoelectronics,
thermoelectrics, transparent contacts, and thin film transistors. In comparison
to oxide counterparts, chalcogenides have demonstrated higher mobility and
\textit{p}-type dopability, owing to larger orbital overlaps between metal-X
covalent chemical bondings and higher-energy valence bands derived by
p-orbitals. Despite the potential of chalcogenides, the number of successfully
synthesized compounds remains relatively low compared to oxides, suggesting the
presence of numerous unexplored chalcogenides with fascinating physical
characteristics. In this study, we implemented a systematic high-throughput
screening process combined with first-principles calculations on ternary
chalcogenides using 34 crystal structure prototypes. We generated a
computational material database containing over 400,000 compounds by exploiting
the ion-substitution approach at different atomic sites with elements in the
periodic table. The thermodynamic stabilities of the candidates were validated
using the chalcogenides included in the Open Quantum Materials Database.
Moreover, we trained a model based on Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural
Networks to predict the thermodynamic stability of novel materials.
Furthermore, we theoretically evaluated the electronic structures of the stable
candidates using accurate hybrid functionals. A series of in-depth
characteristics, including the carrier effective masses, electronic
configuration, and photovoltaic conversion efficiency, was also investigated.
Our work provides useful guidance for further experimental research in the
synthesis and characterization of such chalcogenides as promising candidates,
as well as charting the stability and optoelectronic performance of ternary
chalcogenides.

<h3>Weak vs. strong breaking of integrability in interacting scalar quantum  field theories</h3>

The recently proposed classification of integrability-breaking perturbations
according to their strength is studied in the context of quantum field
theories. Using random matrix methods to diagnose the resulting quantum chaotic
behaviour, we investigate the $\phi^4$ and $\phi^6$ interactions of a massive
scalar, by considering the crossover between Poissonian and Wigner-Dyson
distributions in systems truncated to a finite-dimensional Hilbert space. We
find that a naive extension of the scaling of crossover coupling with the
volume observed in spin chains does not give satisfactory results for quantum
field theory. Instead, we demonstrate that considering the scaling of the
crossover coupling with the number of particles yields robust signatures, and
is able to distinguish between the strengths of integrability breaking in the
$\phi^4$ and $\phi^6$ quantum field theories.

<h3>Influence of high pressure on the remarkable itinerant electron  behaviour in Y$_{0.7}$Er$_{0.3}$Fe$_2$D$_{4.2}$ compounds</h3>

<br>
<br>
Monoclinic Y$_{0.7}$Er$_{0.3}$Fe$_2$D$_{4.2}$ compound exhibits unusual
magnetic properties with different field induced magnetic transitions. The
deuteride is ferrimagnetic at low temperature and the Er and Fe sublattices
present magnetic transitions at different temperatures. The Er moments are
ordered below T$_{Er}$=55 K, whereas the Fe moments remain ferromagnetically
coupled up to T$_{M0}$ = 66 K. At T$_{M0}$ the Fe moments display a sharp
ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic transition (FM-AFM) through an itinerant
electron metamagnetic (IEM) behaviour very sensitive to any volume change.
Y$_{0.7}$Er$_{0.3}$Fe$_2$D$_{4.2}$ becomes paramagnetic above T$_N$=125 K. The
pressure dependence of T$_{Er}$ and T$_{M0}$ have been extracted from magnetic
measurements under hydrostatic pressure up to 0.49 GPa. Both temperatures
decrease linearly upon applied pressure with dT$_{Er}$/dP=-126 and dTM0/dP=-140
K.GPa$^{-1}$ for a field of B=0.03 T. Both magnetic Er and ferromagnetic Fe
order disappear at P=0.44(4) GPa. However, under a larger applied field B=5 T,
dT$_{M0}$/dP=-156 K.GPa$^{-1}$ whereas dT$_{Er}$/dP=-134 K.GPa$^{-1}$ showing a
weaker sensitivity to pressure and magnetic field. At 2 K the decrease of the
saturation magnetization under pressure can be attributed to a reduction of the
mean Er moment due to canting and/or crystal field effect. Above T$_{M0}$ the
magnetization curves display a metamagnetic behaviour from AFM to FM state,
which is also very sensitive to the applied pressure. The transition field
B$_{trans}$, which increases linearly upon heating, is shifted to lower
temperature upon applied pressure with dT=-17 K between 0 and 0.11 GPa. These
results show a strong decoupling of the Er and Fe magnetic sublattices versus
temperature, applied field and pressure.

GaGeTe is a layered topological semimetal that has been recently found to
exist in at least two different polytypes, $\alpha$-GaGeTe ($R\bar{3}m$) and
$\beta$-GaGeTe ($P6_3 mc$). Here we report a joint experimental and theoretical
study of the structural, vibrational, and electronic properties of these two
polytypes at high pressure. Both polytypes show anisotropic compressibility and
two phase transitions, above 7 and 15 GPa, respectively, as confirmed by XRD
and Raman spectroscopy measurements. Although the nature of the high-pressure
phases is not confirmed, comparison with other chalcogenides and total-energy
calculations allow us to propose possible high-pressure phases for both
polytypes with an increase in coordination for Ga and Ge atoms from 4 to 6. In
particular, the simplification of the X-ray patterns for both polytypes above
15 GPa suggests a transition to a structure of relatively higher symmetry than
the original one. This result is consistent with the rocksalt-like
high-pressure phases observed in parent III-VI semiconductors, such as GaTe,
GaSe, and InSe. Pressure-induced amorphization is observed upon pressure
release. The electronic band structures of $\alpha$-GaGeTe and $\beta$-GaGeTe
and their pressure dependence also show similarities to III-VI semiconductors,
thus suggesting that the germanene-like sublayer induces a semimetallic
character in both GaGeTe polytypes. Above 3 GPa, both polytypes lose their
topological features, due to the opening of the direct band gap, while the
reduction of the interlayer space increases the thermal conductivity at high
pressure.

The coexistence of the charge-density wave (CDW) and superconducting phases
and their tunability under external pressure remains one of the key points in
understanding the electronic structure of $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs)
kagome metals. Here, we employ synchrotron-based infrared spectroscopy assisted
by density-functional calculations to study the pressure evolution of the
electronic structure at room temperature up to 17 GPa experimentally. The
optical spectrum of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is characterized by the presence of localized
carriers seen as a broad peak at finite frequencies in addition to the
conventional metallic Drude response. The pressure dependence of this
low-energy peak reflects the re-entrant behavior of superconductivity and may
be interpreted in terms of electron-phonon coupling, varying with the growth
and shrinkage of the Fermi surface (FS). Moreover, drastic modifications in the
low-energy interband absorptions are observed upon the suppression of CDW.
These changes are related to the upward shift of the Sb2 $p_x+p_y$ band that
eliminates part of the FS around the $M$-point, whereas band saddle points do
not move significantly. These observations shed new light on the mixed
electronic and lattice origin of the CDW in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.

The Warburg open and short impedances, $W_{o}$ and $W_{s}$, are widely used
to interpret electrochemical impedance spectroscopy experiments on fuel cells,
solar cells, batteries, and supercapacitors. In the context of porous
electrodes, $R_b+W_{o}$ is the solution of the transmission line (TL) equation,
which models the charging of a finite-length pore in contact with an
electrolyte reservoir of resistance $R_b$. We show here that the usual
derivations of $R_b+W_{o}$ from the TL equation do not correctly account for
current conservation at the electrode-reservoir interface but that correcting
this shortcoming leads to the same impedance. We also show that $W_{o}$ and
$W_{s}$ can be derived directly from their corresponding ladder circuits,
completely bypassing the TL equation. These circuits for the charging of
electrolyte-filled pores are based on the assumption that equipotential lines
in the pores are straight, which is not the case near the pore entrance and
end. To determine the importance of these regions, we numerically simulated the
charging of electrolyte-filled pores of different lengths $\ell_p$ and radii
$\rho_p$ through the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations. We find that pores with
aspect ratios beyond $\ell_p/\rho_p\gtrapprox5$ have impedances in good
agreement with $W_{o}$. The impedance of shorter pores tends towards that of a
pure capacitance.

We develop and harness a phase field simulation method to study liquid
filling on grooved surfaces. We consider both short-range and long-range
liquid-solid interactions, with the latter including purely attractive and
repulsive interactions, as well as those with short-range attraction and
long-range repulsion. This allows us to capture complete, partial and
pseudo-partial wetting states, demonstrating complex disjoining pressure
profiles over the full range of possible contact angles as previously proposed
in the literature. Applying the simulation method to study liquid filling on
grooved surfaces, we compare the filling transition for the three different
classes of wetting states as we vary the pressure difference between the liquid
and gas phases. The filling and emptying transition is reversible for the
complete wetting case, while significant hysteresis is observed for the partial
and pseudo-partial cases. In agreement with previous studies, we also show that
the critical pressure for the filling transition follows the Kelvin equation
for the complete and partial wetting scenarios. Finally, we find the filling
transition can display a number of distinct morphological pathways for the
pseudo-partial wetting cases, as we demonstrate here for varying groove
dimensions.

We demonstrate that quantum correlations can emerge from the statistical
correlations of random discrete models, without an a priori assumption that the
random models are quantum mechanical in nature, that is without considering
superpositions of the random structures. We investigate the correlations
between the number of neighbors(degree) for pairs of vertices in Erdos-Renyi
uniform random graphs. We use the joint probabilities for the appearance of
degree numbers between the vertices in the pairs, in order to calculate the
respective Bell's inequalities. We find that the inequalities are violated for
sparse random graphs with ratio of edges over vertices $R<2$, signifying the
emergence of quantum correlations for these random structures. The quantum
correlations persist independently of the graph size or the geodesic distance
between the correlated vertices. For $R>2$, as the graph becomes denser by
adding more edges between its vertices, the Bell's inequalities are satisfied
and the quantum correlations disappear. Relations to our previous works
concerning the emergence of spacetime and its geometrical properties from
uniform random graphs, are also briefly discussed.

Based on the algebraic equation of motion (AEOM) method, we investigate the
transport properties of a quantum dot. We obtain an analytical expression for
the dot electron single-particle Green's function, and based on this
expression, we plot the dot electron density of states under different biases.
We find that the Kondo resonance splits and is suppressed as the bias is
increased. In addition, we calculate the differential conductance of the dot
and obtain the zero-bias Kondo resonance at different temperatures, which is
found to be suppressed as the temperature is increased.

present, and because of the different work functions of graphene and ZnO,
charge transfer takes place. Graphene's superior conductivity is not impacted
by its interaction with ZnO, since its Dirac point is unaffected despite its
adsorption on ZnO. In hybrid systems, excited electrons with energies between 0
and 3 eV (above Fermi energy) are primarily accumulated on graphene. The
calculations offer a theoretical justification for the successful operation of
graphene / ZnO hybrid materials as photocatalysts and solar cells. ZnO
semiconductor is found to be a suitable material with modest band gap, ($\sim$
3 eV), having high transparency in visible region and a high optical
conductivity.

<h3>Emergence of curved momentum-spacetime and its effect on the cyclotron  motion in the antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal</h3>

We show that anisotropic quantum corrections can dynamically give rise to
curved momentum-spacetimes for quasiparticles in metals. In the
(2+1)-dimensional antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal, a curved
momentum-spacetime arises as the critical spin fluctuations generate red shift
that dilates frequency of electron unevenly on the Fermi surface. As the
disparity of the momentum-dependent red shift is controlled by the shape of the
Fermi surface, the momentum-spacetime geometry that emerges at low energies
depends on the bare nesting angle of the Fermi surface. With increasing nesting
angle, the region in which electron motion is slowed down by critical spin
fluctuations shrinks. On the other hand, the increasing nesting angle makes the
red shift stronger near the hot spots due to the weakened screening of the
interaction. These competing effects result in a non-monotonic dependence of
the cyclotron frequency of electron on the nesting angle of the Fermi surface.
The red shift that becomes more singular at the hot spots with increasing
nesting angle creates a possibility of realizing a momentum-space black hole
horizon beyond a critical nesting angle : the electron motion becomes
`perpetually' slowed down as it approaches a hot spot in the same way that the
motion of a free falling object freezes near the event horizon of a black hole
with respect to an asymptotic observer. However, the analogous horizon in
momentum space does not lead to a vanishing cyclotron frequency because the
metric singularity at the hot spots is cut off by thermal effects present above
the non-zero superconducting transition temperature.

We report the discovery and detailed investigation of superconductivity in
Mo$_4$Ga$_{20}$As. Mo$_4$Ga$_{20}$As crystallizes in the space group of $I4/m$
(No. 87), with lattice parameters $a$ = 12.86352 \AA and $c$ = 5.30031 \AA. The
resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat data reveal Mo$_4$Ga$_{20}$As to
be a type-II superconductor with $T_c$ = 5.6 K. The upper and lower critical
fields are estimated to be 2.78 T and 22.0 mT, respectively. In addition,
electron-phonon coupling in Mo$_4$Ga$_{20}$As is possibly stronger than the BCS
weak-coupling limit. First-principles calculations suggest the Fermi level
being dominated by the Mo-4$d$ and Ga-4$p$ orbitals.

Defects can strongly influence the electronic, optical and mechanical
properties of 2D materials, making defect stability under different
thermodynamic conditions crucial for material-property engineering. In this
paper, we present an account of the structural and electronic characteristics
of point defects in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides $MX_2$ with
$M$=Mo/W and $X$= S/Se, calculated with density-functional theory using the
hybrid HSE06 exchange correlation functional including many-body dispersion
corrections. For the simulation of charged defects, we employ a charge
compensation scheme based on the virtual crystal approximation (VCA). We relate
the stability and the electronic structure of charged vacancy defects in
monolayer MoS$_2$ to an explicit calculation of the S monovacancy in MoS$_2$
supported on Au(111), and find convincing indication that the defect is
negatively charged. Moreover, we show that the finite-temperature vibrational
contributions to the free energy of defect formation can change the stability
transition between adatoms and monovacancies by 300--400 K. Finally, we probe
defect vibrational properties by calculating a tip-enhanced Raman scattering
image of a vibrational mode of a MoS$_2$ cluster with and without an S
monovacancy.

Hybrid van der Waals heterostructures of organic semiconductors and
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising candidates for various
optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells and biosensors. Energy-transfer
processes in these materials are crucial for the efficiency of such devices,
yet they are poorly understood. In this work, we develop a fully microscopic
theory describing the effect of the F\"{o}rster interaction on exciton dynamics
and optics in a WSe$_2$/tetracene heterostack. We demonstrate that the
differential absorption and time-resolved photoluminescence can be used to
track the real-time evolution of excitons. We predict a strongly unidirectional
energy transfer from the organic to the TMD layer. Furthermore, we explore the
role temperature has in activating the F\"{o}rster transfer and find a good
agreement to previous experiments. Our results provide a blueprint to tune the
light-harvesting efficiency through temperature, molecular orientation and
interlayer separation in TMD/organic heterostructures.

Semi-flexible polymers in crowded environments exhibit complex dynamics that
play a crucial role in various biological and material design processes. Based
on the classic reptation theory, it is generally believed that semiflexible
polymers are trapped within static confinements. Here we demonstrate that
semi-flexible polymers are indeed trapped in short-lived kinetic cages. We have
developed a novel scaling law for rotational diffusion through the examination
of the polymer network at the level of an individual nanofiber and quantify the
onset of entanglement and entanglement itself by introducing an effective tube
diameter. We also show that understanding these dynamics is critical for
interpreting the macroscopic behavior of such systems, as evidenced by our
micro-rheology analysis. The insight from our study provides a rectified
microscopic understanding of the dynamics of semi-flexible polymers in complex
environments, yielding new principles to better understand the macroscopic
behavior of crowded systems, from biophysics to materials science.

<h3>Magnetic properties of Nd6Fe13Cu single crystals</h3>

<br>
<br>
The understanding of coercivity mechanism in high performance Nd-Fe-B
permanent magnets relies on the analysis of the magnetic properties of all
phases present in the magnets. By adding Cu in such compounds, a new Nd6Fe13Cu
grain boundary phase is formed, however, the magnetic properties of this phase
and its role in the magnetic decoupling of the matrix Nd2Fe14B grains are still
insufficiently studied. In this work, we have grown Nd6Fe13Cu single crystals
by the reactive flux method and studied their magnetic properties in detail. It
is observed that below the N\'eel temperature (TN = 410 K), the Nd6Fe13Cu is
antiferromagnetic in zero magnetic field; whereas when a magnetic field is
applied along the a-axis, a spin-flop transition occurs at approx. 6 T,
indicating a strong competition between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic
interactions in two Nd layers below and above the Cu layers. Our atomistic spin
dynamics simulation confirms that an increase in temperature and/or magnetic
field can significantly change the antiferromagnetic coupling between the two
Nd layers below and above the Cu layers, which, in turn, is the reason for the
observed spin-flop transition. These results suggest that the role of
antiferromagnetic Nd6Fe13Cu grain boundary phase in the coercivity enhancement
of Nd-Fe-B-Cu magnets is more complex than previously thought, mainly due to
the competition between its antiferro- and ferro-magnetic exchange
interactions.

An essential ingredient for the production of Majorana fermions that can be
used for quantum computing is the presence of topological superconductivity. As
bulk topological superconductors remain elusive, the most promising approaches
exploit proximity-induced superconductivity making systems fragile and
difficult to realize. Weyl semimetals due to their intrinsic topology belong to
potential candidates too, but search for Majorana fermions has always been
connected with the superconductivity in the bulk, leaving the possibility of
intrinsic superconductivity of the Fermi surface arcs themselves practically
without attention, even from the theory side.Here, by means of angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy and ab-initio calculations, we unambiguously
identify topological Fermi arcs on two opposing surfaces of the
non-centrosymmetric Weyl material PtBi2. We show that these states become
superconducting at different temperatures around 10K. Remarkably, the
corresponding coherencepeaks appear as the strongest and sharpest excitations
ever detected by photoemission from solids, suggesting significant
technological relevance. Our findings indicate that topological
superconductivity in PtBi2 occurs exclusively at the surface, which not only
makes it an ideal platform to host Majorana fermions, but may also lead to a
unique quantum phase - an intrinsic topological SNS Josephson junction.

<h3>Dynamics of magnetoelastic robots in water-saturated granular beds</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the dynamics of a magnetoelastic robot with a dipolar magnetic
head and a slender elastic body as it performs undulatory strokes and burrows
through water-saturated granular beds. The robot is actuated by an oscillating
magnetic field and moves forward when the stroke amplitude increases above a
critical threshold. By visualizing the medium, we show that the undulating body
fluidizes the bed, resulting in the appearance of a dynamic burrow, which
rapidly closes in behind the moving robot as the medium loses energy. We
investigate the applicability of Lighthill's elongated body theory of fish
locomotion, and estimate the contribution of thrust generated by the undulating
body and the drag incorporating the granular volume fraction-dependent
effective viscosity of the medium. The projected speeds are found to be
consistent with the measured speeds over a range of frequencies and amplitudes
above the onset of forward motion. However, systematic deviations are found to
grow with increasing driving, pointing to a need for further sophisticated
modelling of the medium-structure interactions.

We theoretically investigate the F\"orster transfer of an exciton in an
ensemble of self-assembled quantum dots randomly distributed on a circular
mesa. We use the stochastic simulation method to solve the equation of~motion
for the density matrix with a given decay rate. We express the diffusion in
terms of the mean square displacement from the initially excited quantum dot.
The mean square displacement follows three time stages: ballistic, normal
diffusion, and saturation. In addition, the exciton exhibits power-law
localization. Using an approximate analytical approach, we provide the formulas
that follow the results of numerical studies.

Developing methods to understand and control defect formation in
nanomaterials offers a promising route for materials discovery. Monolayer MX2
phases represent a particularly compelling case for defect engineering of
nanomaterials due to the large variability in their physical properties as
different defects are introduced into their structure. However, effective
identification and quantification of defects remains a challenge even as
high-throughput scanning tunneling electron microscopy (STEM) methods improve.
This study highlights the benefits of employing first principles calculations
to produce digital twins for training deep learning segmentation models for
defect identification in monolayer MX2 phases. Around 600 defect structures
were obtained using density functional theory calculations, with each monolayer
MX2 structure being subjected to multislice simulations for the purpose of
generating the digital twins. Several deep learning segmentation architectures
were trained on this dataset, and their performances evaluated under a variety
of conditions such as recognizing defects in the presence of unidentified
impurities, beam damage, grain boundaries, and with reduced image quality from
low electron doses. This digital twin approach allows benchmarking different
deep learning architectures on a theory dataset, which enables the study of
defect classification under a broad array of finely controlled conditions. It
thus opens the door to resolving the underpinning physical reasons for model
shortcomings, and potentially chart paths forward for automated discovery of
materials defect phases in experiments.

Ferroelectrics and ionic conductors are important functional materials, each
supporting a plethora of applications in information and energy technology. The
underlying physics governing their functional properties is ionic motion, and
yet studies of ferroelectrics and ionic conductors are often considered
separate fields. Based on first-principles calculations and
deep-learning-assisted large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we
report ferroelectric-switching-promoted oxygen ion transport in HfO2, a
wide-band-gap insulator with both ferroelectricity and ionic conductivity.
Applying a unidirectional bias can activate multiple switching pathways in
ferroelectric HfO2, leading to polar-antipolar phase cycling that appears to
contradict classical electrodynamics. This apparent conflict is resolved by the
geometric-quantum-phase nature of electric polarization that carries no
definite direction. Our MD simulations demonstrate bias-driven successive
ferroelectric transitions facilitate ultrahigh oxygen ion mobility at moderate
temperatures, highlighting the potential of combining ferroelectricity and
ionic conductivity for the development of advanced materials and technologies.

The interplay of magnetic interactions in chiral multilayer films gives rise
to nanoscale topological spin textures, which form attractive elements for
next-generation computing. Quantifying these interactions requires several
specialized, time-consuming, and resource-intensive experimental techniques.
Imaging of ambient domain configurations presents a promising avenue for
high-throughput extraction of the parent magnetic interactions. Here we present
a machine learning-based approach to determine the key interactions --
symmetric exchange, chiral exchange, and anisotropy -- governing chiral domain
phenomenology in multilayers. Our convolutional neural network model, trained
and validated on over 10,000 domain images, achieved $R^2 > 0.85$ in predicting
the parameters and independently learned physical interdependencies between
them. When applied to microscopy data acquired across samples, our
model-predicted parameter trends are consistent with independent experimental
measurements. These results establish ML-driven techniques as valuable,
high-throughput complements to conventional determination of magnetic
interactions, and serve to accelerate materials and device development for
nanoscale electronics.

<br>
It is found that single-cycle THz electromagnetic fields efficiently excite a
GHz spin resonance mode in ferrimagnetic Tm$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$, despite the near
absence of GHz spectral components in the exciting THz pulse. By analyzing how
the efficiency of excitation depends on the orientation and strength of the THz
electric field, we show that it can be explained in terms of the nonlinear THz
inverse Cotton-Mouton effect. Here, the THz electric field gets effectively
rectified and acts on the ferrimagnetic spins as a uni-polar effective magnetic
field pulse. This interpretation is confirmed by a theoretical model based on
the phenomenological analysis of the effective magnetic field, combined with
the equations of motion derived from the effective Lagrangian for a
ferrimagnet. Moreover, by using the outcome of two-dimensional THz
spectroscopy, we conjecture a quantum-mechanical interpretation of the observed
effect in terms of stimulated Raman scattering of THz photons by the
crystal-field split f-f electronic transitions of Tm$^{3+}$.

Ring-shaped superfluids with weak links provide a perfect environment for
studying persistent currents and dynamic stirring protocols. Here, we
investigate the effects of a weak-link system on dipolar supersolids. By
calculating the ground state energy at fixed angular momenta, we find that
metastable persistent currents may exist in the supersolid phase near the
superfluid transition point. When stirring the weak link rapidly enough, we
show that vortices can enter the supersolid. These vortex entries cause phase
slips, emitting solitonic excitations that interfere with the crystalline
structure of the supersolid, leading to a continuous melting and
recrystallization of the droplets. Finally, we examine the release of
vortex-carrying supersolids from the trap, observing that the released density
exhibits a discrete structure associated with the density modulation and a
central hole resulting from the vortex core.

<br>
<br>
The dice lattice, containing a stack of three triangular lattices, has been
proposed to exhibit nontrivial flat bands with nonzero Chern numbers, but
unlike the honeycomb lattice it is much less studied. By employing
density-functional theory (DFT) calculations with an on-site Coulomb repulsion
term, we explore systematically the electronic and topological properties of
(La$X$O$_3$)$_3$/(LaAlO$_3$)$_3$(111) superlattices with $X=$ Ti, Mn and Co,
where a LaAlO$_3$ trilayer spacer confines the La$X$O$_3$ (L$X$O) dice lattice.
In the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) with symmetry constrained to P3,
the ferromagnetic (FM) phase of the L$X$O(111) trilayers exhibits a distinct
spin-polarized half-metallic state with multiple Dirac crossings and coupled
electron-hole pockets around the Fermi energy. Symmetry lowering induces a
significant rearrangement of bands and triggers a metal-to-insulator
transition. Inclusion of SOC leads to a substantial anomalous Hall conductivity
(AHC) around the Fermi energy reaching values up to $\sim-3e^2/h$ for $X=$ Mn
and Co in P3 symmetry and both in- and out-of-plane magnetization directions in
the first case and along [001] in the latter. The dice lattice emerges as a
promising playground to realise nontrivial topological phases with high Chern
numbers.

This study investigated the formation of multi-voids in polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) using a multi-pulse irradiation method and explored the impact of laser
energy, number of pulses per micron (writing speed), and laser spot size (NA)
on the process. The experimental results revealed that multi-void formation
occurred due to multi-pulse irradiation in the bulk of PDMS. Additionally,
increasing laser energy led to an increase in the number of voids, while the
number of voids did not change with an increase in the number of pulses per
micron for a fixed laser parameter. However, the size of the voids increased
with the number of pulses per micron, and tighter focusing conditions (higher
NA) resulted in smaller voids with a shorter distance between them.
Furthermore, Finite-Difference-Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations reproduced the
generation of void arrays in PDMS using a similar multi-laser pulse approach.
By modeling the voids as concentric spheres with densified shells and
simulating the laser interaction with the voids, we showed that void array
generation in PDMS is a linear mechanism. This study provides valuable insight
into the mechanism behind the formation of void arrays in PDMS. The simulation
results agrees well with the experimental results to further validate the model
and gain a better understanding of the physical processes involved in the
generation of void arrays in PDMS.

<h3>Accelerating GW calculations through machine learned dielectric matrices</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The GW approach produces highly accurate quasiparticle energies, but its
application to large systems is computationally challenging, which can be
largely attributed to the difficulty in computing the inverse dielectric
matrix. To address this challenge, we develop a machine learning approach to
efficiently predict density-density response functions (DDRF) in materials. For
this, an atomic decomposition of the DDRF is introduced as well as the
neighbourhood density-matrix descriptor both of which transform in the same way
under rotations. The resulting DDRFs are then used to evaluate quasiparticle
energies via the GW approach. This technique is called the ML-GW approach. To
assess the accuracy of this method, we apply it to hydrogenated silicon
clusters and find that it reliably reproduces HOMO-LUMO gaps and quasiparticle
energy levels. The accuracy of the predictions deteriorates when the approach
is applied to larger clusters than those included in the training set. These
advances pave the way towards GW calculations of complex systems, such as
disordered materials, liquids, interfaces and nanoparticles.

<h3>Lifetime of locally stable states near a phase transition in the  Thirring model</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the lifetime of locally stable states in the Thirring model, which
describes a system of particles whose interactions are long-range. The model
exhibits first-order phase transitions in the canonical ensemble and,
therefore, a free energy barrier separates two free energy minima. The energy
of the system diffuses as a result of thermal fluctuations and we show that its
dynamics can be described by means of a Fokker-Planck equation. Considering an
initial state where the energy takes the value corresponding to one of the
minima of the free energy, we can define the lifetime of the initial state as
the mean first-passage time for the system to reach the top of the free energy
barrier between the minima. We use an analytical formula for the mean
first-passage time which is based on the knowledge of the exact free energy of
the model, even at a finite number of particles. This formula shows that the
lifetime of locally stable states increases exponentially in the number of
particles, which is a typical feature of systems with long-range interactions.
We also perform Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble in order to
obtain the probability distribution of the first-passage time, which turns out
to be exponential in time in a long time limit. The numerically obtained mean
first-passage time agrees with the theoretical prediction. Combining theory and
simulations, our work provides a new insight in the study of metastability in
many-body systems with long-range interactions.

<br>
<br>
In two-dimensional superlattice materials, the nonlinear current response to
a large applied electric field can feature a strong angular dependence. This
nonperturbative regime encodes information about the band dispersion and Berry
curvature of isolated electronic Bloch minibands. Within the relaxation-time
approximation, we obtain analytic expressions for the current in a
band-projected theory with time-reversal and trigonal symmetry, up to infinite
order in the driving field. For a fixed field strength, the dependence of the
current on the direction of the applied field is given by rose curves whose
petal structure is symmetry constrained and is obtained from an expansion in
real-space translation vectors. We illustrate our theory with calculations on
periodically-buckled graphene and twisted double bilayer graphene, wherein the
discussed physics can be accessed at experimentally-relevant field strengths.

<br>
<br>
Chiral field theories describe large classes of matter, from the edges of
Quantum Hall systems to the electroweak sector of the Standard Model, but
defining them on the lattice has been an ongoing challenge due to a no-go
theorem precluding free local models, the potential of symmetry anomalies, and
sign problems. Some approaches define a $1+1$d chiral field theory as the edge
of a $2+1$d system and argue that the edge decouples from the bulk, but this
can be difficult to verify due to finite size effects and strong interactions.
On the other hand, recent work has shown how to define the $2+1$d bulk theory
as an exactly solvable model with zero correlation length, in which case the
edge theory may be extracted exactly. We use these techniques to derive a
lattice field theory on a $1+1$d spacetime lattice which carries an anomalous
chiral $U(1)$ symmetry with zero chiral central charge. The lattice theory with
anomalous chiral $U(1)$ symmetry is always gapless, regardless of lattice
interactions. We demonstrate the chiral anomaly by coupling to a background
gauge field, develop a field theory which demonstrates the chiral behavior, and
show how to assemble a chiral, anomaly-free theory where the gauge field may be
taken to be dynamical.

We propose helical trilayer graphene (HTG), a helical structure featuring
identical rotation angles $\theta\approx 1.5^\circ$ between three consecutive
layers of graphene, as a unique and experimentally accessible platform for
realizing exotic correlated topological states of matter. While nominally
forming a supermoir\'e (or moir\'e-of-moir\'e) structure, we show that HTG
locally relaxes into large regions of a periodic single-moir\'e structure in
which $C_{2z}$ is broken, giving rise to flat topological bands carrying
valley-Chern numbers $C=\pm(1,-2)$. These bands feature near-ideal quantum
geometry and are isolated from remote bands by a large gap
$E_{\mathrm{gap}}\sim 100$ meV, making HTG a promising platform for
experimental realization of correlated topological states such as integer and
fractional quantum anomalous Hall states in $C=1$ and $2$ bands.

The advent of iron-based superconductors in 2008 came as a complete surprise
to the condensed matter community. Now 15 years later, they are beginning to
impart some of their new-found wisdom on a slew of emerging superconductors
that boast similar traits.
