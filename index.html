<h3>Sound, superfluidity and layer compressibility in a ring dipolar  supersolid</h3>

We propose a protocol to excite the Goldstone modes of a supersolid dipolar
Bose-Einstein condensed gas confined in a ring geometry. By abruptly removing
an applied periodic modulation proportional to cos($\varphi$), where $\varphi$
is the azimuthal angle, we explore the resulting oscillations of the gas, by
solving the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The value of the two
longitudinal sound velocities exhibited in the supersolid phase are analyzed
using the hydrodynamic theory of supersolids at zero temperature. This approach
allows for the determination of the layer compressibility modulus as well as of
the superfluid fraction $f_S$, in agreement with the Leggett estimate of the
non-classical moment of inertia.

We measure electron transport through point contacts in an electron gas in
AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures and graphene for a range of temperatures, magnetic
fields and electron densities. We find a magnetoconductance peak around B = 0.
With increasing temperature, the width of the peak increases monotonically,
while its amplitude first increases and then decreases. For GaAs point contacts
the peak is particularly sharp at relatively low temperatures $T\approx$1.5 K:
the curve rounds on a scale of few tens of $\mu$T hinting at length scales of
several millimeters for the corresponding scattering processes. We propose a
model based on the transition between different transport regimes with
increasing temperature: from ballistic transport to few electron-electron
scatterings to hydrodynamic superballistic flow to hydrodynamic Poiseuille-like
flow. The model is in qualitative and, in many cases, quantitative agreement
with the experimental observations.

<h3>On the synthesis methodologies to prepare Pb$_9$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O --  phase, composition, magnetic analysis and absence of superconductivity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05776" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05776</a>

<br>
We present the results of our various attempts to prepare the presumably
room-temperature and ambient-pressure superconducting compound
Pb$_9$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O (LK-99). We experimented with various starting materials,
and used several synthesis techniques like, sealed quartz tubes and
air-sintering pathways to prepare the reported phase. Repetition of the exact
synthesis process followed by Lee et al failed to reproduce the superconducting
phase yielding only a multiphase sample. None of our prepared samples exhibits
Meissner effect or Levitation. Very importantly, no copper (or only a trace
amount) could be detected in any of the designated LK-99 phase with PXRD
pattern identical to the reported one. Additionally, some dark greyish flakes
in some samples responded towards the magnet in a way imitating
half-levitation. The magnetic measurement on those sample suggest it is
diamagnetic in the measured temperature range of 2-325 K but show a weak soft
ferromagnetic behavior at 2 K, the origin of which is still unknown to us.

<h3>Current percolation model for the special resistivity behavior observed  in Cu-doped Apatite</h3>

Since the initial report of the potential occurrence of room-temperature
superconductivity under normal pressure [arXiv: 2307.12008], there has been
significant interest in the field of condensed matter physics regarding
Cu-doped Apatite (Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O). In this study, we performed
temperature-dependent resistivity measurements on the synthesized
Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O samples. The structure of the sample was confirmed to match
the reference literature through X-ray diffraction analysis. Remarkably, we
observed four distinct types of resistivity behaviors within samples from the
same pellet: (1) A semiconductor-like behavior characterized by a decrease in
resistivity as the temperature is lowered. (2) A gradual reduction in
resistivity, reaching an exceptionally small value that falls below the
resolution limits of our measurement equipment. (3) An abrupt drop in
resistivity to a low value at ~ 250 K. (4) An almost linear reduction in
resistivity exhibiting a transition at approximately 7 K (possibly associated
with Pb). Following a thorough compositional analysis, we proposed a current
percolation model, based on the formation of a Cu/Pb current channel, to
elucidate the observed special resistivity behaviors. It is important to note
that the Meissner effect was not observed in our magnetization measurements.
Consequently, we reached the conclusion that the presence of superconductivity
in Cu-doped Apatite has yet to be substantiated.

Neuromorphic computing aims to emulate the architecture and information
processing mechanisms of the mammalian brain. This includes the implementation
by hardware of neural networks. Oxide-based memristor arrays with cross-bar
architecture appear as a possible physical implementation of neural networks.In
this paper, we obtain experimental potentiation-depression (P-D) curves on
different manganite-based memristive systems and simulate the learning process
of perceptrons for character recognition. We analyze how the specific
characteristics of the P-D curves affect the convergence time -- characterized
by the EPOCHs-to-convergence (ETC) parameter -- of the network. Our work shows
that ETC is reduced for systems displaying P-D curves with relatively low
granularity and non-linear and asymmetric response. In addition, we also show
that noise injection during the synaptic weight actualization further reduces
the ETC. The results obtained here are expected to contribute to the
optimization of hardware neural networks based on memristors cross-bar arrays.

<h3>Ferromagnetism and insulating behavior with a logarithmic temperature  dependence of resistivity in $Pb_{10-x}Cu_x\left( PO_4 \right) _6O$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05786" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05786</a>

Recent claim of discovering above-room-temperature superconductivity (Tc
about 400 K) at ambient pressure in copper doped apatite $Pb_{10}\left( PO_4
\right) _6O$ has stimulated world-wide enthusiasm and impulse of motion. A lot
of follow-up works have been carried out with controversial conclusions. To
check whether superconductivity is really present or absent in the material, we
need samples which should have a rather pure phase of $Pb_{10-x}Cu_x\left( PO_4
\right) _6O$. Here we report the characterization results from the
$Pb_{10-x}Cu_x\left( PO_4 \right) _6O$ with a volume of about 97% inferred from
the fitting to the x-ray diffraction pattern. The resistivity measurements show
that it is a semiconductor characterized roughly by a ln(1/T) temperature
dependence in wide temperature region without trace of superconductivity.
Magnetization measurements show that it has a general ferromagnetic signal with
a weak superparamagnetic background. Many grains of the sample show clear
interactions with a NbFeB magnet. The detected Cu concentration is much lower
than the expected nominal one and the conduction may be improved if more Cu
atoms are successfully doped into the system. Our results show the absence of
metallicity and superconductivity in $Pb_{10-x}Cu_x\left( PO_4 \right) _6O$ at
ambient pressure, and suggest the presence of strong correlation effect.

<h3>Correlated electrons tunneling through pseudo Fermi arcs in hyperbolic  Fermi surfaces of topological materials</h3>

<br>
<br>
In the last few decades, basic ideas of topology have completely transformed
the prediction of quantum transport phenomena. Following this trend, we go
deeper into the incorporation of modern mathematics into quantum material
science focusing on geometry. Here we formulate geometrical conditions of the
Fermi surface for a Fermi liquid breakdown and corresponding correlated
transport phenomena. As a mechanism to recognize these correlations, we
introduce pseudo Fermi arcs connecting separate pockets of a hyperbolic Fermi
surface. Tunneling through these pseudo arcs and corresponding time-reversal
symmetry breaking of purely geometrical origin is referred to as the Fermi
Surface Geometry Effect (FS-GE). The reliability of the FS-GE is tested on the
spin and anomalous Hall effects, traditionally associated with intrinsic
time-reversal symmetry breaking. An index, H, quantifying the FS-GE in a
particular direction, shows a universal correlation (R^2 = 0.97) with the
experimentally measured intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity, of 16 different
compounds spanning a wide variety of crystal, chemical, and electronic
structure families, including those where topological methods give R$^2$ =
0.52. This raises a question about the predictive limits of topological physics
and its transformation into a wider study of bandstructures' and Fermi
surfaces' geometries, opening horizon for prediction of phenomena beyond
topological understanding.

<h3>High-Resolution Tunneling Spectroscopy of Fractional Quantum Hall States</h3>

<br>
<br>
Strong interaction among electrons in two-dimensional systems in the presence
of high magnetic fields gives rise to fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states that
host quasi-particles with fractional charge and statistics. We perform
high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy of FQH states in
ultra-clean Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) devices. Our experiments show
that the formation of FQH states coincides with the appearance of sharp
excitations in tunneling experiments that have been predicted to occur for
electron fractionalizing into bound states of quasi-particles. From these
measurements and their comparison to theoretical calculations, we find large
local energy gaps that protect quasi-particles of FQH states predicted to host
non-abelian anyons, making BLG an ideal setting for the exploration of these
novel quasi-particles. STM studies not only provide a way to characterize the
bulk properties of FQH states in the absence of disorder but also reveal
previous undiscovered states in such ultra-clean samples.

<h3>Transport anomalies in multiband superconductors near quantum critical  point</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05791" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05791</a>
<br>
<i>Maxim Dzero, Maxim Khodas, Alex Levchenko</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the effects of quantum fluctuations on the transport properties of
multiband superconductors near a pair-breaking quantum critical point. For this
purpose, we consider a minimal model of the quantum phase transition in a
system with two nested two-dimensional Fermi surfaces. Under the assumption
that doping the system adds nonmagnetic impurities but does not change the
densities of carriers, we include disorder potentials that render both intra-
and interband collisions. Interband scattering leads to a full suppression of
the unconventional $s^{\pm}$ superconducting order similar to the effect of
paramagnetic impurities in isotropic single-band superconductors. We use the
diagrammatic technique of quantum field theory to compute the corrections to
electrical conductivity in a normal state due to superconducting fluctuations
in the entire low-temperature quantum regime. We show that the sign of the
conductivity correction depends on how the quantum critical point is approached
in the phase diagram. We contrast our findings to existing approaches to this
problem based on the renormalization group, time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau
phenomenology, and effective bosonic action field theories.

<h3>Delicate Topology of Luttinger Semimetal</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Recent advances in delicate topology have expanded the classification of
topological bands, but its presence in solid-state materials remains elusive.
Here we show that delicate topology naturally emerges in the Luttinger-Kohn
model that describes many semiconductors and semimetals. In particular, the
Luttinger semimetal is found to be a quantum critical point leading to a
quantized jump of an integer-valued delicate topological invariant. Away from
this criticality, we have identified new types of electronic insulators and
semimetals with intertwined stable and delicate topologies. They all carry
gapless surface states that transform anomalously under rotation symmetry. Our
work provides a starting point for exploring delicate topological phenomena in
quantum materials.

<h3>Crystalline-electromagnetic responses of higher order topological  semimetals</h3>

Previous work has shown that time-reversal symmetric Weyl semimetals with a
quadrupolar arrangement of first-order Weyl nodes exhibit a mixed
crystalline-electromagnetic response. For systems with higher order Weyl nodes,
which are attached to both surface and hinge Fermi arcs, additional phenomena
appear on surfaces of codimension $n>1$, such as electromagnetic responses of
the hinges. Here we construct a model possessing a quadrupole of higher order
Weyl nodes to study the interplay between higher order topology and mixed
crystalline-electromagnetic responses. We show that the higher order nature of
the Weyl nodes yields a dipole of Dirac nodes on certain surfaces, leading to a
mixed crystalline-electromagnetic \emph{surface} response that binds charge to
dislocations and momentum-density to magnetic fields. In addition, we show that
the model possesses a bulk quadrupole moment of crystal-momentum that provides
a link between the bulk and surface responses of the system.

<h3>Nature of the current-induced insulator-to-metal transition in  Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ as revealed by transport-ARPES</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Mott insulator Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ exhibits a rare insulator-to-metal
transition (IMT) induced by DC current. While structural changes associated
with this transition have been tracked by neutron diffraction, Raman
scattering, and x-ray spectroscopy, work on elucidating the response of the
electronic degrees of freedom is still in progress. Here we unveil the
current-induced modifications of the electronic states of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ by
employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) in conjunction with
four-probe transport. Two main effects emerge: a clear reduction of the Mott
gap and a modification in the dispersion of the Ru-bands. The changes in
dispersion occur exclusively along the $XM$ high-symmetry direction, parallel
to the $b$-axis where the greatest in-plane lattice change occurs. These
experimental observations are reflected in dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT)
calculations simulated exclusively from the current-induced lattice constants,
indicating a current driven structural transition as the primary mechanism of
the IMT. Furthermore, we demonstrate this phase is distinct from the
high-temperature zero-current metallic phase. Our results provide insight into
the elusive nature of the current-induced IMT of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ and advance the
challenging, yet powerful, technique of transport-ARPES.

<h3>Atomistic insights into texture, segregation, and binding in magnesium  alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05811" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05811</a>
<br>
<i>F. Mouhib, Z. Xie, A. Atila, J. Guénolé, S. Korte-Kerzel, T. Al-Samman</i>
<br>
<br>
This study aims at illuminating different solute effects, by comparing RE and
Ca solute additions to binary and ternary MgXZn alloys. A multi-scale approach
featureing atom probe tomography and ab initio calculations was employed. In
terms of texture, a pole spread in both RD and TD was observed in binary MgCa
alloys, whileMgGd shows a pronounced RD split and no TD texture component.
However, Zn additions to MgGd lead to a dominant TD pole spread, while the
counterpart Ca ternary alloy is less effected by Zn additions. A complementary
trend in segregation was observed by atom probe tomography, showing a
significant Ca segregation in binary systems. However, the Ca segregation was
not effected by the addition of Zn, while added to MgGd, Zn greatly increases
the Gd segregation, and significant Zn segregation can be observed. A possible
reason was identified by ab initio calculations, which showed significant
differences in binding energies. High binding energies between Ca and vacancies
were observed, indicating that Ca, rather than Gd, preferably segregates to
defect-rich regions, e.g., grain boundaries. However, in the ternary state
Gd-Zn binding was found to be more favorable than Ca-Zn binding, indicating
strong ternary effects in MgGdZn.

<h3>Predictions and correlation analyses of Ellingham diagrams in binary  oxides</h3>

Knowing oxide-forming ability is vital to gain desired or avoid deleterious
oxides formation through tuning oxidizing environment and materials chemistry.
Here, we have conducted a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis of 137 binary
oxides using the presently predicted Ellingham diagrams. It is found that the
active elements to form oxides easily are the f-block elements (lanthanides and
actinides), elements in the groups II, III, and IV (alkaline earth, Sc, Y, Ti,
Zr, and Hf), and Al and Li; while the noble elements with their oxides
nonstable and easily reduced are coinage metals (Cu, Ag, and especially Au),
Pt-group elements, and Hg and Se. Machine learning based sequential feature
selection indicates that oxide-forming ability can be represented by electronic
structures of pure elements, for example, their d- and s-valence electrons,
Mendeleev numbers, and the groups, making the periodic table a useful tool to
tailor oxide-forming ability. The other key elemental features to correlate
oxide-forming ability are thermochemical properties such as melting points and
standard entropy at 298 K of pure elements. It further shows that the present
Ellingham diagrams enable qualitatively understanding and even predicting
oxides formed in multicomponent materials, such as the Fe-20Cr-20Ni alloy (in
wt.%) and the equimolar high entropy alloy of AlCoCrFeNi, which are in
accordance with thermodynamic calculations using the CALPHAD approach and
experimental observations in the literature.

In two dimensions, the average electrical conductance from a point in a
percolating network to the network boundary should be related by a conformal
transformation to the conductance from one point to another in an unbounded

Van der Waals layered and 2D materials constitute an extraordinary playground
for condensed matter physics, since the strong confinement of wavefunctions to
two dimensions supports a diverse set of correlated phenomena. By creating
carefully designed heterostructures, these can be readily manipulated. In this
Perspective, we advance the viewpoint that heterostructures from from these
materials with thin layers of organic molecules offer an opportunity for
creating and manipulating the correlated degrees of freedom in unprecedented
ways. We briefly survey what has been accomplished thus far, including proposed
mechanisms, before concentrating on unique opportunities offered by the vast
selection of available organic molecules. We further introduce the notion of
proximitization in combination with symmetry breaking as a fertile and
potentially unifying conceptual vantage point from which to consider
opportunities for tailoring correlations in van der Waals layered materials.

<h3>Piezostrain-induced in-plane anisotropy of superconducting transition  temperature for FeSe0.5Te0.5 thin films</h3>

<br>
<br>
Superconductivity is a macroscopic quantum phenomenon and it is commonly
believed that the in-plane superconducting transition temperature (Tc) should
be isotropic for superconductors with crystal structures of stacking layers
(quasi two-dimensional). Here, we report the observation of piezostrain-induced
in-plane anisotropy of Tc in FeSe0.5Te0.5 (FST) thin films grown on
ferroelectrics. The as-prepared FST shows tetragonal phase with equal in-plane
lattice parameters and absence of in-plane anisotropy of Tc. Upon applying
electric fields, piezostrain induces difference of the in-plane lattice
parameters (a-b) and in-plane anisotropy of Tc. The in-plane anisotropy of Tc
correlates with a-b and becomes more remarkable for larger values of a-b. Some
possible extrinsic effects were ruled out by experiments and analysis. It is
suggested that electronic nematicity with one direction induced by piezostrain
and inhomogeneous superconductivity in FST are involved in this unusual
phenomenon. This work reveals the exotic behavior of FST and will stimulate
exploration of similar behavior in other unconventional superconductors.

We study a dynamical spin response of surface Majorana fermions in a
topological superconductor-magnet hybrid under microwave irradiation. We find a
method to toggle between dissipative and non-dissipative Majorana Ising spin
dynamics by adjusting the external magnetic field angle and the microwave
frequency. This reflects the topological nature of the Majorana fermions,
enhancing the Gilbert damping of the magnet, thereby, providing a detection
method for the Majorana Ising spins. Our findings illuminate a magnetic probe
for Majorana fermions, paving the path to innovative spin devices.

<h3>Metallic Quantized Anomalous Hall Effect without Chiral Edge States</h3>

The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a topological state of matter
with a quantized Hall resistance. It has been observed in some two-dimensional
insulating materials such as magnetic topological insulator films and twisted
bilayer graphene. These materials are insulating in the bulk, but possess
chiral edge states carrying the edge current around the systems. Here we
discover a metallic QAHE in a topological insulator film with magnetic sandwich
heterostructure, in which the Hall conductance is quantized to $e^{2}/h$, but
the longitudinal conductance remains finite. This effect is attributed to the
existence of a pair of massless Dirac cones of surface fermions, with each
contributing half of the Hall conductance due to quantum anomaly. It is not
characterized by a Chern number and not associated to any chiral edge states.
Our study offers novel insights into topological transport phenomena and
topological metallic states of matter.

This work focuses on the fabrication of niobium through silicon vias (TSV)
superconductors interconnects. The effect of supercycle of sequential oxidation
and chemical etching process on the through-etch wall quality was investigated.
It was experimentally shown that the use of supercycle in the fabrication
process leads to significant improvement of the TSV wall quality and removal of
the defect type - scallops. After 12 times repetitions of supercycles a
dissipative bonding of superconducting strips on the front and back side of the
sample is observed. The critical current density of such coupling is 5x104

Valleytronics, that uses the valley index or valley pseudospin to encode
information, has emerged as an interesting field of research in two-dimensional
(2D) systems with promising device applications. Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and
inversion symmetry breaking leads to spin-splitting of bands near the energy
extrema (valleys). In order to find a new 2D material useful for valleytronics,
we have designed hexagonal planar monolayers of cadmium chalcogenides (CdX, X =

structure study reveals valence band local maxima at symmetry point K and its
time reversal conjugate point K$\textquotesingle$. Application of SOC initiates
spin-splitting in the valleys that lifts the energy degeneracy and shows strong
valley-spin coupling character. We have substituted two Cd atoms in the planar
monolayers by Sn atoms which increases the spin-splitting significantly. The
structural, dynamic, mechanical and thermal stability of all the monolayers has
been confirmed. Values of formation energies indicate that it may be feasible
to synthesize the Sn-doped CdSe and CdTe monolayers using bottom-up approach.
Zeeman-type spin-splitting is observed in the valley region and Rashba
spin-splitting is observed at the $\Gamma$ point for Sn-doped CdSe and CdTe
monolayers. Berry curvature values are more in all the Sn-doped monolayers than
the pristine monolayers. These newly designed monolayers are thus found to be
suitable for valleytronics applications. Sn-doped monolayers show band
inversion deep in the valence and conduction bands between Sn~$s$ and $p$ and
X~$p$ states but lack topological properties.

<h3>Polarization sensitivity in scattering-type scanning near-field optical  microscopy -- towards nanoellipsometry</h3>

Electric field enhancement mediated through sharp tips in scattering-type
scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) enables optical material
analysis down to the 10-nm length scale, and even below. Nevertheless, mostly
the out-of-plane electric field component is considered here due to the
lightning rod effect of the elongated s-SNOM tip being orders of magnitude
stronger as compared to any in-plane field component. Nonetheless, the
fundamental understanding of resonantly excited near-field coupled systems
clearly allows us to take profit from all vectorial components, especially also
from the in-plane ones. In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally
explore how linear polarization control of both near-field illumination and
detection, can constructively be implemented to (non-)resonantly couple to
selected sample permittivity tensor components, e.g. explicitly also to the
in-plane directions. When applying the point-dipole model, we show that
resonantly excited samples respond with a strong near-field signal, to all
linear polarization angles. We then experimentally investigate the
polarization-dependent responses for both non-resonant (Au) and phonon-resonant
(3C-SiC) sample excitations at a 10.6~$\mu$m and 10.7~$\mu$m incident
wavelength using a tabletop CO$_2$ laser. Varying the illumination polarization
angle thus allows for quantitatively comparing the scattered near-field
signatures for the two wavelengths. Finally, we compare our experimental data
to simulation results, and thus gain the fundamental understanding of the
polarization's influence on the near-field interaction. As a result, the
near-field components parallel and perpendicular to the sample surface can be
easily disentangled and quantified through their polarization signatures,
connecting them directly to the sample's local permittivity.

<h3>Role of higher-order spin interactions in the emergence of chiral  magnetic configurations in lithium-decorated monolayer CrTe$_{2}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Chiral magnetic states in two-dimensional (2D) layered noncentrosymmetric
magnets, which are of promising advanced spintronic applications, are usually
attributed to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), yet the role of
underlying higher-order spin couplings on the emergence of chiral spin textures
is rarely reported. In this work, taking lithium-decorated monolayer CrTe$_{2}$
(LiCrTe$_{2}$) as an example, we proposed a comprehensive
first-principles-based spin model using the symmetry-adapted cluster expansion
method. Based on this spin model, we identified the ground state of monolayer
LiCrTe$_{2}$ to be a chiral labyrinth domain (LD) state, and various
higher-order spin interactions are essentially responsible for stabilizing this
LD state. Meanwhile, some higher-order couplings are identified to play the
role of DMI due to their nontrivial spin spiral chirality selectivity. In
addition, skyrmions emerge under either external magnetic field or finite
temperature. Our study sheds light on the complex magnetic couplings in 2D
magnets.

<h3>Nodal line semimetals through boundary</h3>

We study the properties of a spinless Hamiltonian which describes topological
nodal line semimetals at zero temperature. Our Hamiltonian has some resemblance
with the usual Hamiltonian for this type of materials, with that of Weyl
semimetals and is some sort of a generalisation of Kitaev Hamiltonian on
honeycomb lattice. As the interaction parameter of the Hamiltonian is varied,
it shows a transition from a gapless phase to a semimetal phase and then to
another semimetal phase. These transitions show up as non-analytic behaviour of
ground state energy. We find that one type of the semimetal is characterised by
a single closed loop of nodal line, while the other, by two such loops both
crossing the boundary of the first Brillouin zone. Surface states with non-zero
winding number are found to exist in both of these phases, but over two
topologically different regions. We also study the length of nodal line, the
area and perimeter of the region over which the winding number is non-zero and
the low-frequency electrical conductivity.

<h3>The Rheology of Granular Mixtures with Varying Size, Density, Particle  Friction and Flow Geometry</h3>

<br>
<br>
Employing the discrete element method, we study the rheology of dense
granular media mixtures, varying in size, density, and frictional properties of
particles, across a spectrum from quasi-static to inertial regimes. By
accounting for the volumetric contribution of each solid phase, we find that
the stress ratio, $\mu$, and concentration $\phi$, scale with the inertial
number when using volume averaging to calculate mean particle density, friction
and size. Moreover, the critical packing fraction correlates with skewness,
polydispersity, and particle friction, irrespective of the size distribution.
Notably, following the work of Kim and Kamrin [2020] we introduce a rheological
power-law scaling to collapse all or monodisperse and polydisperse data,
reliant on concentration, dimensionless granular temperature, and the inertial
number. This model seamlessly merges the $\mu(I)$-rheology and Kinetic Theory,
enabling the unification of all local and non-local rheology data onto a single
master curve.

<br>
<br>
The excitation of quasi-particles near the extrema of the electronic band
structure is a gateway to electronic phase transitions in condensed matter. In
a many-body system, quasi-particle dynamics are strongly influenced by the
electronic single-particle structure and have been extensively studied in the
weak optical excitation regime. Yet, under strong optical excitation, where
light fields coherently drive carriers, the dynamics of many-body interactions
that can lead to new quantum phases remain largely unresolved. Here, we induce
such a highly non-equilibrium many-body state through strong optical excitation
of charge carriers near the van Hove singularity in graphite. We investigate
the system's evolution into a strongly-driven photo-excited state with
attosecond soft X-ray core-level spectroscopy. Surprisingly, we find an
enhancement of the optical conductivity of nearly ten times the quantum
conductivity and pinpoint it to carrier excitations in flat bands. This
interaction regime is robust against carrier-carrier interaction with coherent
optical phonons acting as an attractive force reminiscent of superconductivity.
The strongly-driven non-equilibrium state is markedly different from the
single-particle structure and macroscopic conductivity and is a consequence of
the non-adiabatic many-body state.

<br>
Density-functional-theory calculations were performed to investigate the
magnetism in a series of triangular-lattice monolayer MCl2 (M=V, Mn, and Ni).
The magnetic stability manifests a distinct chemical trend; VCl2 and MnCl2 show
the antiferromagnetic ground states and NiCl2 shows the ferromagnetic ground
state. The microscopic mechanism behind the magnetic interaction is explained
by the so-called Goodenough-Kanamori-Anderson rules and by the virtual-hopping
process through the hopping integrals between the 3d-orbital maximally
localized Wannier functions. Our result highlights the role of the direct
exchange interaction and the superexchange interaction in the magnetic
stabilization in two-dimensional magnets.

<h3>Emergent inductance from spin fluctuations in strongly correlated  magnets</h3>

<i>Taekoo Oh, Naoto Nagaosa</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, the intriguing phenomenon of emergent inductance has been
theoretically proposed and experimentally observed in nanoscale spiral spin
systems subjected to oscillating currents. Building upon these recent
developments, we put forward the concept of emergent inductance in strongly
correlated magnets in the normal state with spin fluctuations. It is argued
that the inductance shows a positive peak at temperatures above the ordering
temperature. As for the frequency dependence, in systems featuring a
single-band structure or a gapped multi-band, we observe a Drude-type, while in
gapless multi-band systems, a non-Drude inductance with a sharp dip near zero
frequency. These results offer valuable insights into the behavior of strongly
correlated magnets and open up new possibilities for harnessing emergent
inductance in practical applications.

The growth of monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) on Ir(110) through
low-pressure chemical vapor deposition is investigated using low energy
electron diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy. We find that the growth
of aligned single hexagonal boron nitride on Ir(110) requires a growth
temperature of 1500 K, whereas lower growth temperatures result in coexistence
of aligned h-BN with twisted h-BN The presence of the h-BN overlayer suppresses
the formation of the nano-faceted ridge pattern known from clean Ir(110).
Instead, we observe the formation of a (1 $\times$ n) reconstruction, with n
such that the missing rows are in registry with the h-BN/Ir(110) moir\'{e}
pattern. Our moir\'{e} analysis showcases a precise methodology for determining
both the moir\'{e} periodicity and the h-BN lattice parameter on an fcc(110)

<br>
<i>Léo Touzo, Pierre Le Doussal</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider N run and tumble particles in one dimension interacting via a
linear 1D Coulomb potential, an active version of the rank diffusion problem.
It was solved previously for N = 2 leading to a stationary bound state in the
attractive case. Here the evolution of the density fields is obtained in the
large N limit in terms of two coupled Burger's type equations. In the
attractive case the exact stationary solution describes a non-trivial
N-particle bound state, which exhibits transitions between a phase where the
density is smooth with infinite support, a phase where the density has finite
support and exhibits "shocks", i.e. clusters of particles, at the edges, and a
fully clustered phase. In presence of an additional linear potential, the phase
diagram, obtained for either sign of the interaction, is even richer, with
additional partially expanding phases, with or without shocks. Finally, a
general self-consistent method is introduced to treat more general
interactions. The predictions are tested through extensive numerical
simulations.

<h3>Are nucleation bubbles in a liquid all independent?</h3>

<br>
<i>Joël Puibasset</i>
<br>
<br>
The spontaneous formation of tiny bubbles in a liquid is at the root of the
nucleation mechanism during the liquid-to-vapor transition of a metastable
liquid. The smaller the bubbles the larger their probability to appear, and
even for moderately metastable liquid, it is frequent to observe several tiny
bubbles close to each other, suggesting that they are not all independent. It
is shown that these spatially correlated bubbles should be seen as belonging to
one single density depression of the liquid due to fluctuations (called LDR for
Low Density Region) and should be counted as one event instead of several. This
has a major impact on the characterization of the bubble density in a liquid,
with consequences (i) for understanding liquid-to-vapor transitions which
proceed through growing and merging of these correlated bubbles, and (ii) for
free energy profile and barrier calculations with molecular simulation
techniques which require to convert the calculated size distribution of the
largest bubble into the size distribution of any bubble. Remarkably, the
average number of LDRs in a given volume simply relates to the probability of
not having bubbles in the liquid.

<h3>Topological properties of gap and supercurrent, and Anderson  localization of quasiparticles, in a Kitaev ring threaded by a magnetic flux</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06170" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06170</a>

<br>
<br>
We study a superconducting Kitaev ring pierced by a magnetic flux, with and
without disorder, in a quantum ring configuration, and in a rf-SQUID one, where
a weak link is present. In all cases we find in the ground state a finite
supercurrent in the thermodynamic limit. This current is periodic in the flux,
with a period strictly associated with the chosen configuration. In the
rf-SQUID the supercurrent shows jumps at a fixed value $\Phi^*$ of the flux,
when the system is topological. In the thermodynamic limit $\Phi^*$ is constant
inside the topological phase, independently of disorder, and we analytically
predict it using a perturbative approach in the weak-link coupling. We find
that the weak link breaks the ground-state degeneracy due to the boundary
Majorana modes, and opens a topological spectral gap for $\Phi\neq \Phi^*$,
that vanishes at $\Phi^*$ with a cusp providing the current jump. Looking at
the quasiparticle excitations, we see that they are Anderson localized, so they
cannot carry a resistive contribution to the current, and the localization
length stays finite also for very small disorder strength, for a specific value
of the superconducting coupling. In the absence of disorder, we analytically
and numerically find that the chemical-potential derivative of the supercurrent
logarithmically diverges at the topological/trivial transition, in agreement
with the transition being of the second order.

<br>
The interplay between strong correlations and topology can lead to the
emergence of intriguing quantum states of matter. One well-known example is the
factional quantum Hall effect, where exotic electron fluids with fractional
charge excitations form in partially filled landau levels. The emergence of
topological moir\'e flat bands provides exciting opportunities to realize the
lattice analogs of both the integer and fractional quantum Hall states without
the need for an external magnetic field. These states are known as the integer
and fractional quantum anomalous Hall (IQAH and FQAH) states. Here, we present
direct transport evidence of the existence of both IQAH and FQAH states in
twisted bilayer MoTe2 (AA stacked). At zero magnetic field, we observe
well-quantized Hall resistance of h/e2 around moir\'e filling factor {\nu} = -1
(corresponding to one hole per moir\'e unit cell), and nearly-quantized Hall
resistance of 3h/2e2 around {\nu} = -2/3, respectively. Concomitantly, the
longitudinal resistance exhibits distinct minima around {\nu} = -1 and -2/3.
The application of an electric field induces topological quantum phase
transition from the IQAH state to a charge transfer insulator at {\nu} = -1,
and from the FQAH state to a generalized Wigner crystal state, further
transitioning to a metallic state at {\nu} = -2/3. Our study paves the way for
the investigation of fractional charge excitations and anyon statistics at zero
magnetic field based on semiconductor moir\'e materials.

Here, we report a novel AuSb 2D superstructure on Au(111) that shows
agreements and discrepancies to the expected electronic features of the ideal
2D surface alloys with $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ periodicity. Using spin- and
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we find a significant spin splitting
of the alloy bands with antiparallel spin polarization. The band structure
originates from the hybridization between the Sb and the Au orbitals at the 2D
Sb-Au interface. Taking advantage of the good agreement between the
experimental results and DFT calculations, we find the broadening of the band
is due to the perturbations introduced by the 3-pointed-star-shaped defects as
nonresonant impurities in the $8\times8$ superstructure. The periodic defect
can properly adjust the energy position of the Rashba band while not breaking
the in-plane symmetry.

<br>
<br>
Given the growing significance of 2D materials in various optoelectronic
applications, it is imperative to have simulation tools that can accurately and
efficiently describe electron correlation effects in these systems. Here, we
show that the recently developed bootstrap embedding (BE) accurately predicts
electron correlation energies and structural properties for 2D systems. Without
explicit dependence on the reciprocal space sum ($k$-points) in the correlation
calculation, BE can typically recover $\sim$99.5% of the total electron
correlation energy in 2D semi-metal, insulator and semiconductors. We
demonstrate that BE can predict lattice constants and bulk moduli for 2D
systems with high precision. Furthermore, we highlight the capability of BE to
treat electron correlation in twisted bilayer graphene superlattices with large
unit cells containing hundreds of carbon atoms. We find that as the twist angle
decreases towards the magic angle, the correlation energy initially decreases
in magnitude, followed by a subsequent increase. We conclude that BE is a
promising electronic structure method for future applications to 2D materials.

<h3>Enhancement of Zener tunneling rate via electron-hole attraction within  a time-dependent quasi-Hartree-Fock method</h3>

<br>
<br>
The tunneling process, a prototypical phenomenon of nonperturbative dynamics,
is a natural consequence of photocarrier generation in materials irradiated by
a strong laser. Common treatments for Zener tunneling are based on a one-body
problem with a field-free electronic structure. In a literature (Ikemachi et
al., Phys. Rev. A 98, 023415 (2018)), a characteristic of gap shrinking or
excitation can occur due to the electron-hole interaction for slow and strong
time-varying electric fields. We have developed a theoretical framework called
the quasi-Hartree-Fock (qHF) method to enable a more flexible imitation of the
electronic structures and electron-hole attraction strength of materials
compared to the original Hartree-Fock method. In the qHF framework, band gap,
reduced effective mass, and electron-hole interaction strength can be
independently selected to reproduce common crystals. In this study, we
investigate the effect of electron-hole attraction on Zener tunneling subjected
to a DC electric field for four different systems using the qHF method. Our
findings demonstrate that the electron-hole attraction promotes the tunneling
rates in all four material systems assumed as examples. Specifically, systems
that have a strong electron-hole interaction show a few factor enhancements for
tunneling rates under DC fields, while systems with a weak interaction show
higher enhancements of a few tens of percent.

<br>
<br>
Experimental quest for high-temperature and room-temperature
superconductivity (SC) at ambient pressure has been a long-standing research
theme in physics. It has also been desired to construct reliable microscopic
mechanisms that may achieve high-temperature SC. Here we systematically explore
SC in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) electron-phonon coupling models by
performing numerically-exact quantum Monte-Carlo simulations. Our results
reliably showed that superconducting $T_c$ of the SSH models is high,
remarkably higher than those in the Holstein models, particularly in strong
electron-phonon coupling regime. This is mainly because SSH phonons can not
only induce strong pairing between electrons but also help the phase coherence
of Cooper pairs, thus realizing higher $T_c$. As mechanism of higher-$T_c$ of
the SSH models could be potentially relevant to realistic materials, it paves a
promising way to find higher-temperature SC in the future.

The broken inversion symmetry at the ferromagnet (FM)/heavy-metal (HM)
interface leads to spin-dependent degeneracy of the energy band, forming
spin-polarized surface states. As a result, the interface serves as an
effective medium for converting spin accumulation into two-dimensional charge
current through the inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect. Exploring and assessing
this spin-to-charge conversion (SCC) phenomenon at the FM/HM interface could
offer a promising avenue to surpass the presumed limits of SCC in bulk HM
layers. We utilize spintronic heterostructures as a platform to measure the
spin-to-charge conversion (SCC) experienced by photoexcited spin currents.
These heterostructures emit terahertz electric field when illuminated by
femtosecond laser pulses, enabling us to quantitatively assess the ultrafast
SCC process. Our results demonstrate a robust interfacial spin-to-charge
conversion (iSCC) within a synthetic antiferromagnetic heterostructure,
specifically for the NiFe/Ru/NiFe configuration, by isolating the SCC
contribution originating from the interface itself, separate from the bulk
heavy-metal (HM) region. Moreover, the iSCC at the NiFe/Ru interface is
discovered to be approximately 27% of the strength observed in the highest
spin-Hall conducting heavy-metal, Pt. Our results thus highlight the
significance of interfacial engineering as a promising pathway for achieving
efficient ultrafast spintronic devices.

<h3>The reshape of three-body interactions: Observation of the survival of  an Efimov state in the atom-dimer continuum</h3>

Efimov states are exotic and counterintuitive three-body quantum states that
emerge in the vicinity of two-atom Feshbach resonances. These states exhibit
remarkable characteristics as their large spatial extent and extremely weak
binding energies following an infinite geometric series, and exist even when
interactions are not strong enough to bind two atoms. Efimov states are
universal and produce observable effects at critical values of the interaction
strength across the two-body resonance when approaching their threshold for
dissociation into the different types of three-body continua. In particular, as
the strength of the interaction is decreased, an Efimov state merges into the
atom-dimer threshold and eventually dissociates into an unbound atom-dimer
pair. Here we explore this critical point using refined coherent few-body
spectroscopy in $^7$Li atoms near a narrow two-body Feshbach resonance.
Contrary to the expectation set by universality, we find that the $^7$Li Efimov
trimer does not immediately dissociate when passing the threshold, and survives
as a metastable state embedded in the atom-dimer continuum. We identify this
behavior with a novel phenomena related to the emergence of a repulsive
interaction in the atom-dimer channel which reshapes the three-body
interactions in systems characterized by narrow Feshbach resonances. Our
results shed new light on the nature of $^7$Li Efimov states and provide a new
path to understand various puzzling phenomena observed here, as well as in
other previous experimental studies.

We report the direct observation of superconductivity in nitridized-aluminum

nitrogen directly determines the properties of the superconducting thin films.
We observe samples displaying critical temperatures up to 3.38$\pm$0.01 K and
resilience to in-plane magnetic fields well above 1 T, with good
reproducibility of the results. To our knowledge, this work represents the

<br>
The recent claim of superconductivity above room temperature in
Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O with 0.9 < $x$ < 1 (referred to as LK-99) has
sparked considerable interest. To minimize the influence of structural defects
and impurity phases on the physical properties, we have synthesized phase-pure
single crystals with $x \sim 1$. We find that the crystals are highly
insulating and optically transparent. X-ray analysis reveals an uneven
distribution of the substituted Cu throughout the sample. Temperature ($T$)
dependent magnetization measurements for $ 2 \leq T \leq 800$ K reveal the
diamagnetic response characteristic of a non-magnetic insulator, as well as a
small ferromagnetic component, possibly originating from frustrated exchange
interactions in Cu-rich clusters in the Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O
structure. No anomalies indicative of phase transitions are observed. We
therefore rule out the presence of superconductivity in Pb$_{9}$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O
crystals, and provide some considerations on the origin of anomalies previously
reported in experiments on polycrystalline specimen.
