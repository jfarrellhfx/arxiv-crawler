Multipole symmetries are of interest in multiple contexts, from the study of
fracton phases, to nonergodic quantum dynamics, to the exploration of new
hydrodynamic universality classes. However, prior explorations have focused on
continuum systems or hypercubic lattices. In this work, we systematically
explore multipole symmetries on arbitrary crystal lattices. We explain how,
given a crystal structure (specified by a space group and the occupied Wyckoff
positions), one may systematically construct all consistent multipole groups.
We focus on two-dimensional crystal structures for simplicity, although our
methods are general and extend straightforwardly to three dimensions. We
classify the possible multipole groups on all two-dimensional Bravais lattices,
and on the kagome and breathing kagome crystal structures to illustrate the
procedure on general crystal lattices. Using Wyckoff positions, we provide an
in-principle classification of all possible multipole groups in any space
group. We explain how, given a valid multipole group, one may construct an
effective Hamiltonian and a low-energy field theory. We then explore the
physical consequences, beginning by generalizing certain results originally
obtained on hypercubic lattices to arbitrary crystal structures. Next, we
identify two seemingly novel phenomena, including an emergent, robust subsystem
symmetry on the triangular lattice, and an exact multipolar symmetry on the
breathing kagome lattice that does not include conservation of charge
(monopole), but instead conserves a vector charge. This makes clear that there
is new physics to be found by exploring the consequences of multipolar
symmetries on arbitrary lattices, and this work provides the map for the
exploration thereof, as well as guiding the search for emergent multipolar
symmetries and the attendant exotic phenomena in real materials based on
nonhypercubic lattices.

<h3>Collisionless dynamics of general non-Fermi liquids from hydrodynamics  of emergent conserved quantities</h3>

Given the considerable theoretical challenges in understanding strongly
coupled metals and non-Fermi liquids, it is valuable to have a framework to
understand properties of metals that are universal, in the sense that they must
hold in any metal. It has previously been argued that an infinite-dimensional
emergent symmetry group is such a property, at least for clean, compressible
metals. In this paper, we will show that such an emergent symmetry group has
very strong implications for the dynamics of the metal. Specifically, we show
that consideration of the hydrodynamics of the associated infinitely many
emergent conserved quantities automatically recovers the collisionless
Boltzmann equation that governs the dynamics of a Fermi liquid. Therefore, the
hydrodynamic prediction is that in the low-temperature, collisionless regime
where the emergent conservation laws hold, the dynamics and response to
external fields of a general spinless metal will be identical to a Fermi
liquid. We discuss some potential limitations to this general statement,
including the possibility of non-hydrodynamic modes. We also report some
interesting differences in the case of spinful metals.

<h3>Deformations of an active liquid droplet</h3>

A fluid droplet in general deforms, if subject to active driving, such as a
finite slip velocity or active tractions on its interface. We show that these
deformations and their dynamics can be computed analytically in a perturbation
theory in the inverse surface tension using an approach based on vector
spherical harmonics. In lowest order, the deformation is of first order, yet it
affects the flow fields inside and outside of the droplet in zeroth order.
Hence a correct description of the flow has to allow for shape fluctuations,
even in the limit of large surface tension.

Ion migration in perovskite solar cells is usually analyzed and understood in
terms of charge neutrality condition. However, several recent reports indicate
possibility of ionic imbalance in the active layer due to external ion
migration and/or chemical reactions. In this context, here we explore the
influence of ionic charge neutrality on the performance of perovskite solar
cells. Our results indicate that ionic imbalance leads to an asymmetry in the
device electrostatics, which have interesting implications on the impact of
material/interface degradation, hysteresis, and finally on the long-term
stability and influence of optimal device architecture (NIP vs. PIN).

<h3>Improving the crystallinity and texture of oblique-angle-deposited AlN  thin films using reactive synchronized HiPIMS</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11183" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11183</a>

<br>
<br>
Many technologies require highly-oriented and textured functional thin films.
The most common synthe-sis approaches use on-axis sputter geometries. However,
in some scenarios, on-axis sputtering is not feasible. During ionized physical
vapor deposition (PVD), in contrast to conventional PVD, the film-forming
species can be accelerated onto the growing film using substrate-bias
potentials. This increas-es the ad-atom mobility, but also deflects the
trajectory of ions towards the substrate increasing the texture of the growing
film. However, potential gas-ion incorporation in the films limits the
feasibility of such approaches for the deposition of defect-sensitive
materials. In this work, we report on the oblique-angle deposition of highly
c-axis oriented AlN (0002) films, enabled by reactive metal-ion syn-chronized
HiPIMS. The effect of critical deposition parameters, such as the magnetic
configuration, ion kinetic energies and substrate biasing are investigated. The
films deposited using HiPIMS show a more pronounced texture and orientation
compared to DCMS films. We find that combining the HiPIMS dep-ositions with a
moderate substrate bias of -30 V is sufficient to improve the crystalline
quality and tex-ture of the films significantly. To reduce process-gas
incorporation, and the formation of point defects, the negative substrate-bias
potential is synchronized to the Al-rich fraction of each HiPIMS pulse. This
leads to reduced Ar-Ion incorporation and improves the structural properties.
The films also show uni-form polarization of the grains making this synthesis
route suitable for piezoelectric applications. While the compressive stress in
the films is still high, the results demonstrate, that synchronized HiPIMS can
yield promising results for the synthesis under oblique-angle deposition
conditions - even with low substrate-bias potentials.

<h3>Chirality Reversing Active Brownian Motion in Two Dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11194" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11194</a>
<br>
<i>Santanu Das, Urna Basu</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the dynamics of a chirality reversing active Brownian particle,
which models the chirality reversing active motion common in many
microorganisms and microswimmers. We show that, for such a motion, the presence
of the two time-scales set by the chirality reversing rate $\gamma$ and
rotational diffusion constant $D_R$ gives rise to four dynamical regimes,
namely, (I) $t \ll \text{min}(\gamma^{-1}, D_R^{-1})$, (II) $\gamma^{-1} \ll t
\ll D_R^{-1}$, (III) $D_R^{-1} \ll t \ll \gamma^{-1}$ and (IV) $t \gg
\text{max}(\gamma^{-1}, D_R^{-1})$, each showing different behaviour. The
short-time regime (I) is characterized by a strongly anisotropic and
non-Gaussian position distribution, which crosses over to a diffusive Gaussian
behaviour in the long-time regime (IV) via an intermediate regime (II) or
(III), depending on the relative strength of $\gamma$ and $D_R$. In regime
(II), the chirality reversing active Brownian motion reduces to that of an
ordinary active Brownian particle, with an effective rotation diffusion
coefficient which depends on the angular velocity. Finally, we find that, the
regime (III) is characterized by an effective chiral active Brownian motion.

<h3>Microscopically grounded constitutive model for dense suspensions of  soft particles below jamming</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11234" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11234</a>
<br>
<i>N. Cuny, E. Bertin, R. Mari</i>
<br>
<br>
We derive from particle-level dynamics a constitutive model describing the
rheology of two-dimensional dense soft suspensions below the jamming
transition, in a regime where hydrodynamic interactions between particles are
screened. Based on a statistical description of particle dynamics, we obtain
through a set of physically plausible approximations a non-linear tensorial
evolution equation for the deviatoric part of the stress tensor, involving the
strain-rate and vorticity tensors. This tensorial evolution equation involves
singular terms usually not taken into account in phenomenological constitutive
models, which most often assume a regular expansion in terms of the stress
tensor. All coefficients appearing in the equation have known expressions in
terms of the microscopic parameters of the model. The predictions of this
microscopically grounded constitutive model have several qualitative features
that are specific to the rheology of soft suspensions measured in experiments
or simulations. The model shows a typical behavior of polymeric visco-elastic
materials, such as normal stress differences quadratic in the shear rate
$\dot\gamma$, as well as typical behaviors of suspensions of stiff particles,
such as a particle pressure linear in $\dot\gamma$ and a zero-shear viscosity
diverging at the jamming transition. The model also predicts a sharper shear
thinning than other visco-elastic models at small shear rates, in qualitative
agreement with experimental observations. Furthermore the shear thinning
follows a critical scaling close to the jamming transition.

<h3>Room-temperature spin glass behavior in zinc ferrite epitaxial thin  films</h3>

<br>
<br>
Zinc ferrite (ZnFe$_{\text{2}}$O$_{\text{4}}$) epitaxial thin films were
grown by reactive magnetron sputtering on MgAl$_{\text{2}}$O$_{\text{4}}$ and
Al$_{\text{2}}$O$_{\text{3}}$ substrates varying a range of preparation
parameters. The resulting structural and magnetic properties were investigated
using a range of experimental techniques confirming epitaxial growth of
ZnFe$_{\text{2}}$O$_{\text{4}}$ with the nominal stoichiometric composition and
long range magnetic order at and above room temperature. The main preparation
parameter influencing the temperature $T_{\text{f}}$ of the bifurcation between
$M(T)$ curves under field cooled and zero-field cooled conditions was found to
be the growth rate of the films, while growth temperature or the Ar:O$_2$ ratio
did not systematically influence $T_{\text{f}}$. Furthermore $T_{\text{f}}$ was
found to be systematically higher for MgAl$_{\text{2}}$O$_{\text{4}}$ as
substrate and $T_{\text{f}}$ extends to above room temperature. While in some
samples $T_{\text{f}}$ seems to be more likely correlated with
superparamagentism, the highest $T_{\text{f}}$ occurs in
ZnFe$_{\text{2}}$O$_{\text{4}}$ epitaxial films where experimental signatures
of magnetic glassiness can be found. Element-selective X-ray magnetic circular
dichroism measurements aim at associating the magnetic glassiness with the
occurrence of a different valence state and lattice site incorporation of Fe
pointing to a complex interplay of various competing magnetic interactions in
ZnFe$_{\text{2}}$O$_{\text{4}}$.

<h3>$T-$linear resistivity from magneto-elastic scattering: application to  PdCrO$_2$</h3>

An electronic solid with itinerant carriers and localized magnetic moments
represents a paradigmatic strongly correlated system. The electrical transport
properties associated with the itinerant carriers, as they scatter off these
local moments, has been scrutinized across a number of materials. Here we
analyze the transport characteristics associated with ultra-clean PdCrO$_2$ --
a quasi two-dimensional material consisting of alternating layers of itinerant
Pd-electrons and Mott-insulating CrO$_2$ layers -- which shows a pronounced
regime of $T-$linear resistivity over a wide-range of intermediate
temperatures. By contrasting these observations to the transport properties in
a closely related material PdCoO$_2$, where the CoO$_2$ layers are
band-insulators, we can rule out the traditional electron-phonon interactions
as being responsible for this interesting regime. We propose a previously
ignored electron-magnetoelastic interaction between the Pd-electrons, the Cr
local-moments and an out-of-plane phonon as the main scattering mechanism that
leads to the significant enhancement of resistivity and a $T-$linear regime in
PdCrO$_2$ at temperatures far in excess of the magnetic ordering temperature.
We suggest a number of future experiments to confirm this picture in PdCrO$_2$,
as well as other layered metallic/Mott-insulating materials.

<h3>Creating long-range Majorana pairs: from spin-1/2 Kitaev to generalized  XY chains</h3>

Entangling a pair of far-distance qubits in many-body systems has been a
challenging task in quantum computing. A persistent entanglement was suggested
in the rainbow states and generating nonlocal Bell pairs protected by a mirror
symmetry was recently proposed. We investigate a way to create entangled
Majorana fermions in the spin-1/2 Kitaev chain with open boundary conditions.
The spin-1/2 Kitaev chain, a one-dimensional version of the honeycomb lattice
with bond-dependent Ising interactions, has a macroscopic degeneracy related to
the zero modes containing non-local spin strings. We show that applying a pair
pulse sequence on the central unit cell of the chain promotes long distance
spin correlations and maximal bipartite entanglement entropy. We extend this
method to the generalized bond-dependent spin-1/2 chain by introducing another
set of Majorana fermions and make a comparison to the entangled Bell pairs. The
time to reach maximal bipartite entanglement entropy is shorter in the Kitaev
chain as the zero modes do not participate in the entangled pairs. An
application of our results to a recently proposed twisted Kitaev chain,
CoNb2O6, is presented and future directions are also discussed.

<h3>Two-photon excitation with finite pulses unlocks pure dephasing-induced  degradation of entangled photons emitted by quantum dots</h3>

Semiconductor quantum dots have emerged as an especially promising platform
for the generation of polarization-entangled photon pairs. However, it was
demonstrated recently that the two-photon excitation scheme employed in
state-of-the-art experiments limits the achievable degree of entanglement by
introducing which-path information. In this work, the combined impact of
two-photon excitation and longitudinal acoustic phonons on photon pairs emitted
by strongly-confining quantum dots is investigated. It is found that phonons
reduce the achievable degree of entanglement even further due to phonon-induced
pure dephasing and phonon-assisted one-photon processes, which increase the
re-excitation probability. As a consequence, the degree of entanglement, as
measured by the concurrence, decreases with rising temperature and/or pulse
duration, even if the excitonic fine-structure splitting is absent and when
higher electronic states are out of reach. Furthermore, in the case of finite
fine-structure splittings, phonons enlarge the discrepancy in concurrence for
different laser polarizations.

<h3>Origin of ultra-low thermal conductivity in unconventional clathrates:  Strong scattering from extremely low-frequency rattling modes</h3>

<br>
<br>
Recent discoveries of materials with ultra-low thermal conductivity open a
pathway to significant developments in the field of thermoelectricity. Here, we
conduct a comparative study of three chemically similar antimonides to
establish the root causes of their extraordinarily low thermal conductivity
($0.4-0.6$ Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at 525 K). The materials of interest are: the
unconventional type-XI clathrate K$_{58}$Zn$_{122}$Sb$_{207}$, the tunnel
compound K$_{6.9}$Zn$_{21}$Sb$_{16}$, and the type-I clathrate
K$_8$Zn$_{15.5}$Cu$_{2.5}$Sb$_{28}$ discovered herein. Calculations of the
phonon dispersions show that the type-XI compound exhibits localized (i.e.,
rattling) phonon modes with unusually low frequencies that span the entire
acoustic regime. In contrast, rattling in the type-I clathrate is observed only
at higher frequencies, and no rattling modes are present in the tunnel
structure. Modeling reveals that low-frequency rattling modes profoundly limit
the acoustic scattering time; the scattering time of the type-XI clathrate is
half that of the type-I clathrate and a quarter of the tunnel compound. For all
three materials, the thermal conductivities are additionally suppressed by soft
framework bonding that lowers the acoustic group velocities, and structural
complexity that leads to diffusonic character of the optical modes.
Understanding details of thermal transport in structurally complex materials
will be crucial for developing the next generation of thermoelectrics.

<h3>Superconductor-quantum dot hybrid coolers</h3>

We propose a refrigeration scheme in a mesoscopic superconductor-quantum dot
hybrid device. The setup can significantly cool down a normal metal coupled to
the device by applying a bias voltage across the system. We demonstrate that
the cooling power can be as large as 0.05$\Delta_0^2/h$ where $\Delta_0$ is the
absolute value of superconducting order parameter. In contrast to previous
proposals, our device operates without any magnetic elements such as
ferromagnetic reservoirs or Zeeman splittings. The refrigeration scheme works
over a broad parameter range and can be optimized by tuning system parameters
such as level position and bias voltage. Our theory self-consistently
determines the temperature drop of the normal reservoir in the nonlinear
transport regime including electron-electron interactions at the mean field
level. Finally, we evaluate the refrigeration performance and find efficiencies
as large as half of the Carnot bound for realistic values of the coupling
strength.

Traditional approaches to identify ion-transport pathways often presume equal
probability of occupying all hopping sites and focus entirely on finding the
lowest migration barrier channels between them. Although this strategy has been
applied successfully to solid-state Li battery materials, which historically
have mostly been ordered frameworks, in the emerging class of disordered
electrode materials some Li-sites can be significantly more stable than others
due to a varied distribution of transition metal (TM) environments. Using
kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we show that in such cation-disordered
compounds only a fraction of the Li-sites connected by the so-called
low-barrier ``0-TM" channels actually participate in Li-diffusion. The
Li-diffusion behavior through these sites, which are determined primarily by
the voltage applied during Li-extraction, can be captured using an effective
migration barrier larger than that of the 0-TM barrier itself. The suppressed
percolation due to cation disorder can decrease the ionic diffusion coefficient
at room temperature by over 2 orders of magnitude.

<h3>Does cluster encapsulation inhibit sintering? Stabilization of  size-selected Pt clusters on Fe$_3$O$_4$(001) by SMSI</h3>

The metastability of supported metal nanoparticles limits their application
in heterogeneous catalysis at elevated temperatures due to their tendency to
sinter. One strategy to overcome these thermodynamic limits on reducible oxide
supports is encapsulation via strong metal-support interaction (SMSI). While
annealing-induced encapsulation is a well-explored phenomenon for extended
nanoparticles, it is as yet unknown whether the same mechanisms hold for
sub-nanometer clusters, where concomitant sintering and alloying might play a
significant role. In this article, we explore the encapsulation and stability
of size-selected Pt$_5$, Pt$_{10}$ and Pt$_{19}$ clusters deposited on
Fe$_3$O$_4$(001). In a multimodal approach using temperature-programmed
desorption (TPD), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM), we demonstrate that SMSI indeed leads to the formation of a
defective, FeO-like conglomerate encapsulating the clusters. By stepwise
annealing up to 1023 K, we observe the succession of encapsulation, cluster
coalescence and Ostwald ripening, resulting in square-shaped crystalline Pt
particles, independent of the initial cluster sizes. The respective sintering
onset temperatures scale with the cluster footprint and thus size. Remarkably,
while small encapsulated clusters can still diffuse as a whole, atom detachment
and thus Ostwald ripening are successfully suppressed up to 823 K, i.e. 200 K
above the H\"uttig temperature that indicates the thermodynamic stability
limit.

<h3>Generalized multifractality in 2D disordered systems of chiral symmetry  classes</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We study generalized multifractality that characterizes eigenstate
fluctuations and correlations in disordered systems of chiral symmetry classes
AIII, BDI, and CII. By using the non-linear sigmamodel field theory, we
construct pure-scaling composite operators and eigenfunction observables that
satisfy Abelian fusion rules. The observables are labelled by two multi-indices
$\lambda$, $\lambda'$ referring to two sublattices, at variance with other
symmetry classes, where a single multi-index $\lambda$ (that can be viewed as a
generalized version of a Young diagram) is needed. Further, we analyze Weyl
symmetries of multifractal exponents, which are also peculiar in chiral
classes, in view of a distinct root system associated with the sigma-model
symmetric space. The analytical results are supported and complemented by
numerical simulations that are performed for a 2D lattice Hamiltonian of class
AIII, both in the metallic phase and at the Anderson transition. Both in the
metallic phase and at the transition, the numerically obtained exponents
satisfy Weyl symmetry relations, confirming that the sigma-model is the right
theory of the problem. Furthermore, in the metallic phase, we observe the
generalized parabolicity (proportionality to eigenvalues of the quadratic
Casimir operator), as expected in the one-loop approximation. On the other
hand, the generalized parabolicity is strongly violated at the metal-insulator
transition, implying violation of local conformal invariance.

We develop a machine-learning method for coarse-graining condensed-phase
molecular systems using anisotropic particles. The method extends currently
available high-dimensional neural network potentials by addressing molecular
anisotropy. We demonstrate the flexibility of the method by parametrizing
single-site coarse-grained models of a rigid small molecule (benzene) and a
semi-flexible organic semiconductor (sexithiophene), attaining structural
accuracy close to the all-atom models for both molecules at considerably lower
computational expense. The machine-learning method of constructing the
coarse-grained potential is shown to be straightforward and sufficiently robust
to capture anisotropic interactions and many-body effects. The method is
validated through its ability to reproduce the structural properties of the
small molecule's liquid phase and the phase transitions of the semi-flexible
molecule over a wide temperature range.

Phase pure \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 thin films are grown on (001) oriented
\b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrates via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). By
systematically tuning the precursor molar flow rates, the epitaxial growth of
coherently strained \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 films are demonstrated with up to 25%
Al compositions as evaluated by high resolution x-ray diffraction (XRD). The
asymmetrical reciprocal space mapping confirms the growth of coherent
\b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 films (x < 25%) on (001) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrates. While
the films show smooth surface morphologies, the alloy inhomogeneity with local
segregation of Al along (-201) plane is observed from atomic resolution STEM
imaging, resulting in wavy and inhomogeneous interfaces in
\b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 superlattice structure. Room temperature
Raman spectra of \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 films show similar characteristics peaks
as (001) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrate without obvious Raman shifts for films with
different Al compositions. Atom probe tomography (APT) was used to investigate
the atomic level structural chemistry with increasing Al content in the
\b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 films. A monotonous increase in chemical heterogeneity is
observed from the in-plane Al/Ga distributions which was further confirmed via
statistical frequency distribution analysis (FDA). Although the films exhibit
alloy fluctuations, n-type doping with good electrical properties are
demonstrated for films with various Al compositions. The determined valence and
conduction band offsets at \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterojunctions
using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveal the formation of type-II
(staggered) band alignment.

We examine the equilibrium configurations of a nematic liquid crystal with an
immersed body in two-dimensions. A complex variables formulation provides a
means for finding analytical solutions in the case of strong anchoring. Local
tractions, forces, and torques on the body are discussed in a general setting.
For weak (finite) anchoring strengths, an effective boundary technique is
proposed which is used to determine asymptotic solutions. The energy-minimizing
locations of topological defects on the body surface are also discussed. A
number of examples are provided, including circular and triangular bodies, and
a Janus particle with hybrid anchoring conditions. Analogues to classical
results in fluid dynamics are identified, including d'Alembert's paradox,
Stokes' paradox, and the Kutta condition for circulation selection.

Nano particles of pure ZnO, pure SnO$_2$, and nanocomposites of ZnO/SnO$_2$
were synthesized using microwave hydrothermal technique starting from aqueous
solutions. Nanocomposites with different molar ratios of ZnO and SnO$_2$ were
prepared. Structural, morphological and optical properties of these samples
were investigated using XRD, SEM and UV-visible technique, respectively. The
single phases of ZnO and SnO$_2$ could be fabricated according to XRD patterns.
The relative intensities of different XRD peaks in different nanocomposite
samples were different by indicating that there are some preferred orientations
in different samples. In XRD patterns of nanocomposites, peaks of both pure ZnO
and pure SnO$_2$ samples appear. Particle size was in the range of nano-range
according to SEM micrographs. Optical bang gap was measured by UV-visible
spectrometer. Optical band gaps of nano composites are less than those of pure
ZnO and SnO$_2$ due to the increase of particle size.

<h3>Study of magnetism in MgO/FeCoB/MgO trilayers using x-ray standing wave  techniques</h3>

<br>
<br>
Interfaces in the MgO-FeCoB-MgO trilayer have been studied with grazing
incident nuclear resonance scattering (GINRS) using the x-ray standing waves
(XSW) technique. High depth selectivity of the present method allows one to
measure magnetism and structure at the two interfaces of FeCoB, namely,
FeCoB-on-MgO and MgO-on-FeCoB, independently, yielding an intriguing result
that both interfaces are not symmetric. A high-density layer with an increased
magnetic hyperfine field at the FeCoB-on-MgO interface suggests different
growth mechanisms at the two interfaces. The azimuthal angle-dependent
magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements reveal the presence of unusual uniaxial
magnetic anisotropy (UMA) in the trilayer. An in-situ temperature-dependent
study discovered that this UMA systematically reduces with temperature. The
trilayer becomes isotropic at 450C with an order-of-magnitude increase in
coercivity. The asymmetry at the interfaces is, in turn, explained by boron
diffusion from the FeCoB interface layer into the nearby MgO layer.
Stress-induced UMA is observed in the boron-deficient FeCoB layer, superimposed
with the bulk FeCoB layer, and found to be responsible for unusual UMA. The
temperature-dependent variation in the UMA and coercivity can be understood in
terms of variations in the internal stresses and coupling between FeCoB bulk
and the interface layer.

<h3>Valley current reversal in partially overlapped graphene layers</h3>

<br>
Using the tight-binding model, we investigate the valley current of partially
overlapped graphene layers with the two arrangements, $\Box \,_-\,_-^-\,^-\Box$
and $\Box \,_-\,_-^-\,_-\Box$, where symbols $\Box$, $\,_-$ ($\,^-$) and
$\,_-^-$ represent the current probe, the lower (upper) monolayer region, and
the AB stacking bilayer region, respectively. In the arrangement $\Box
\,_-\,_-^-\,^-\Box$, there is no intra-layer current path connecting both the
current probes; thus, the total current must flow through the interlayer path.
We measure valley current reversal (VCR) by the average of $\frac{1}{2}
\sum_{\nu =\pm}(T_{\nu,-\nu}-T_{\nu,\nu})$ per lateral wave number, where
$T_{\nu,\nu'}$ denotes the electron transmission rate from the left $K_{\nu'}$
valley to the right $K_{\nu}$ valley. Without the vertical electric field, the
VCR is less than half in both arrangements. As the vertical field intensifies,
the VCR increases to about 0.8 in the $\Box \,_-\,_-^-\,^-\Box$ arrangement,
but declines in the other arrangement. We derive an analytic scattering matrix
$S_\downarrow$ ($S_\uparrow$) between the monolayer $\,_-$ ($\,^-$ ) and
bilayer regions for the normal incidence. These $S_\downarrow$ and $S_\uparrow$
are real symmetric unitary matrixes ($S^{-1}=S=\;^tS=S^*$) and elucidate the
vertical field effects on the VCR.

<h3>A pair of FRET dyes designed to measure nano-scale contact and the  associated adhesion force</h3>

<br>
Interfacial adhesion is caused by intermolecular forces that only occur
between surfaces at nano-scale contact (NSC) i.e., 0.1-0.4nm. To evaluate NSC
and its influence on adhesion, F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET)
spectroscopy has been used. FRET is a technique capable to measure nanometric
distances between surfaces by taking advantage of the interaction amid some
specific fluorescence molecules, named donor and acceptor. The F\"orster radius
(R0) of the FRET pair indicates the distance detection range (0.5R0-2R0) of the
system and, must be selected considering the final purpose of each study. Here,
we propose a new FRET pair: 7-Amino-4-methyl-cumarin (C120) and
5(6)-Carboxy-2',7'-dichlor-fluorescein (CDCF) with high quantum yield (QY,
QYC120=0.91 and QYCDCF=0.64) and a distance range of 0.6-2.2nm (0.1 mM)
specifically developed to measure NSC between soft surfaces. For this,
polymeric thin films were bonded using different loads, from 1.5 to 150 bar, to
create different degrees of NSC, analyzed by FRET spectroscopy, and later
pulled apart to measure their interfacial separation energy (adhesion force).
Our experiments showed that NSC increases with the applied pressure in the
bonded thin films, leading to higher FRET intensity and adhesion
force/separation energy. Thus, we have validated a new FRET pair, suitable to
measure the degree of NSC between surfaces and establish a linear relationship
between FRET and adhesion force; which can be of interest for any type of study
with soft materials interfaces that include NSC and its influence on adhesion,
as sealants, adhesives or sensors.

<h3>Lee-Yang theory of Bose-Einstein condensation</h3>

Bose-Einstein condensation happens as a gas of bosons is cooled below its
transition temperature, and the ground state becomes macroscopically occupied.
The phase transition occurs in the thermodynamic limit of many particles.
However, recent experimental progress has made it possible to assemble quantum
many-body systems from bottom up, for example, by adding single atoms to an
optical lattice one at a time. Here, we show how one can predict the
condensation temperature of a Bose gas from the energy fluctuations of a small
number of bosons. To this end, we make use of recent advances in Lee-Yang
theories of phase transitions, which allow us to determine the zeros and the
poles of the partition function in the complex plane of the inverse temperature
from the high cumulants of the energy fluctuations. By increasing the number of
bosons in the trapping potential, we can predict the convergence point of the
partition function zeros in the thermodynamic limit, where they reach the
inverse critical temperature on the real axis. Using less than 100 bosons, we
can estimate the condensation temperature for a Bose gas in a harmonic
potential in two and three dimensions, and we also find that there is no phase
transition in one dimension as one would expect.

Emerging applications of self-assembled semiconductor quantum dot (QD)-based
nonclassical light sources emitting in the telecom C-band (1530 to 1565 nm)
present challenges in terms of controlled synthesis of their low-density
ensembles, critical for device processing with an isolated QD. This work shows
how to control the surface density and size of InAs/InP quantum dots over a
wide range by tailoring the conditions of Stranski-Krastanow growth. We
demonstrate that in the near-critical growth regime, the density of quantum
dots can be tuned between $10^7$ and $10^{10} cm^{-2}$. Furthermore, employing
both experimental and modeling approaches, we show that the size (and therefore
the emission wavelength) of InAs nanoislands on InP can be controlled
independently from their surface density. Finally, we demonstrate that our
growth method gives low-density ensembles resulting in well-isolated
QD-originated emission lines in the telecom C-band.

<h3>Striking universalities in stochastic resetting processes</h3>

Given a random process $x(\tau)$ which undergoes stochastic resetting at a
constant rate $r$ to a position drawn from a distribution ${\cal P}(x)$, we
consider a sequence of dynamical observables $A_1, \dots, A_n$ associated to
the intervals between resetting events. We calculate exactly the probabilities
of various events related to this sequence: that the last element is larger
than all previous ones, that the sequence is monotonically increasing, etc.
Remarkably, we find that these probabilities are ``super-universal'', i.e.,
that they are independent of the particular process $x(\tau)$, the observables
$A_k$'s in question and also the resetting distribution ${\cal P}(x)$.

We develop a microscopic theory of tunneling spin transport at the magnetic
interface between a ferromagnetic insulator and a ferromagnetic superconductor

of the FSC can be extracted from the spin currents by tuning the easy axis of
the FSC, and thus the spin currents can be a probe for the symmetries of the
spin-triplet Cooper pairing. Our results will offer a route to exploiting the
synergy of magnetism and superconductivities for spin devices.

<h3>Exceptional Points in the Baxter-Fendley Free Parafermion Model</h3>

Certain spin chains, such as the quantum Ising chain, have free fermion
spectra which can be expressed as the sum of decoupled two-level fermionic
systems. \textit{Free parafermions} are a simple generalisation of this idea to
$Z(N)$-symmetric models. In 1989 Baxter discovered a non-Hermitian but
$PT$-symmetric model directly generalising the Ising chain which was much later
recognised by Fendley to be a free parafermion spectrum. By extending the
model's magnetic field parameter to the complex plane, we show that a series of
exceptional points emerges, where the quasienergies defining the free spectrum
become degenerate. An analytic expression for the locations of these points is
derived, and various numerical investigations are performed. These exceptional
points also exist in the Ising chain with a complex transverse field. Although
the model is not in general $PT$-symmetric at these exceptional points, their
proximity can have a profound impact on the model on the $PT$-symmetric real
line. Furthermore, in certain cases of the model an exceptional point may
appear on the real line (with negative field).

<h3>Hematite Clusters on Anatase TiO2 Surface and Effect of Oxygen Vacancy:  A First Principles Study</h3>

<br>
<br>
It has been observed that small Fe2O3 clusters at low coverage on TiO2 can
enhance the photocatalytic activity, while increase in concentration and size
of the iron oxides can hinder it. Previously, TiO2/Fe2O3 composites have been
studied using DFT methods and explained a photo electron transfer from TiO2 to
Fe2O3. Nevertheless, a systematic study by increasing the size and coverage
concentration of Fe2O3 clusters on the anatase surface can give more insights
into observed photocatalytic activity. In this scenario, keeping this as a
guideline, we have simulated adsorption of Fe2O3 clusters at the anatase TiO2
(101) surface. We investigated the structural, electronic and magnetic
properties to understand the photocatalytic system. Adsorption of the clusters
at the surface is exothermic and generates impurity states in the band gap
which narrows the band gap. Notable charge transfer is attributed to a
formation of heterojunction between TiO2 and Fe2O3 cluster. These findings
indicate TiO2 to be a better photocatalyst with hematite clusters at low
coverage. We also introduced oxygen vacancy in the heterostructure to study the
possibility of altering the photocatalytic properties. We find that oxygen
vacancy further alters the electronic properties, and also locally affects the
magnetic properties. The results suggest that introduction of oxygen vacancy
can be a promising routine to modify the photocatalytic performance of TiO2.

Hydrated proteins undergo a transition in the deeply supercooled regime,
which is attributed to rapid changes in hydration water and protein structural
dynamics. Here, we investigate the nanoscale stress relaxation in hydrated
lysozyme proteins stimulated and probed by X-ray Photon Correlation
Spectroscopy (XPCS). This approach allows us to access the nanoscale dynamic
response in the deeply supercooled regime (T = 180 K) which is typically not
accessible through equilibrium methods. The relaxation time constants exhibit
Arrhenius temperature dependence upon cooling with a minimum in the
Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts exponent at T = 227 K. The observed minimum is
attributed to an increase in dynamical heterogeneity, which coincides with
enhanced fluctuations observed in the two-time correlation functions and a
maximum in the dynamic susceptibility quantified by the normalised variance
$\chi_T$. Our study provides new insights into X-ray stimulated stress
relaxation and the underlying mechanisms behind spatio-temporal fluctuations in
biological granular materials.

Networks of solution-processed nanomaterials are important for multiple
applications in electronics, sensing and energy storage/generation. While it is
known that network morphology plays a dominant role in determining the physical
properties of printed networks, it remains difficult to quantify network
structure. Here, we utilise FIB-SEM nanotomography to characterise the
morphology of nanostructured networks. Nanometer-resolution 3D-images were
obtained from printed networks of graphene nanosheets of various sizes, as well
as networks of WS2 nanosheets, silver nanosheets and silver nanowires.
Important morphological characteristics, including network porosity,
tortuosity, pore dimensions and nanosheet orientation were extracted and linked
to network resistivity. By extending this technique to interrogate the
structure and interfaces within vertical printed heterostacks, we demonstrate
the potential of this technique for device characterisation and optimisation.

We use the principles of cavity opto-mechanics to design a resonant
mechanical force sensor for atomic force microscopy. The sensor is based on a
new type of electro-mechanical coupling, dual to traditional capacitive
coupling, whereby the motion of a cantilever induces surface strain that causes
a change in the kinetic inductance of a superconducting nanowire. The cavity is
realized by a compact microwave plasma mode with an equivalent LC circuit
involving the nanowire's kinetic inductance. The device is fully co-planar and
we show how to transform the cavity impedance for optimal coupling to the
transmission line and readout circuit. For the device presented here, we
estimate the bare Kinetic Inductive Mechano-Electric Coupling (KIMEC) rate
$g_0/2\pi \sim$ 3-10 Hz. We demonstrate phase-sensitive detection of cantilever
motion using a multifrequency pumping and measurement scheme.

Nucleation, the birth of a stable cluster from disorder, is inherently
stochastic. Yet up to date, there are no quantitative studies on NaCl
nucleation that accounts for its stochastic nature. Here, we report the first
stochastic treatment of NaCl-water nucleation kinetics. Using a recently
developed microfluidic system and evaporation model, our measured interfacial
energies extracted from a modified Poisson distribution of nucleation time show
an excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, analysis of
nucleation parameters in 0.5 pL, 1.5pL and 5.5 pL microdroplets reveals an
interesting interplay between kinetic confinement and shifting of nucleation
mechanisms. Overall, our findings highlight the need to treat nucleation
stochastically rather deterministically to bridge the gap between theory and

We consider the classical field integrable system whose evolution equation is
the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with defocusing non-linearities, which is
the classical limit of the quantum Lieb-Liniger model. We propose a simple
derivation of the relation between two sets of conserved quantities: on the one
hand the trace of the monodromy matrix, parameterized by the spectral parameter
and introduced in the inverse-scattering framework, and on the other hand the
rapidity distribution, a concept imported from the Lieb-Liniger model. To do so
we use the definition of the rapidity distribution as the asymptotic momentum
distribution after an expansion. More precisely we use thought experiments
implementing an expansion and we present two different ways to derive our
result, based on different thought experiments which lead to different
calculations.

We study sample-to-sample fluctuations of the gap ratio in the energy spectra
in finite disordered spin chains. The chains are described by the random-field
Ising model and the Heisenberg model. We show that away from the
ergodic/nonergodic crossover, the fluctuations are correctly captured by the
Rosenzweig-Porter (RP) model. However, fluctuations in the microscopic models
significantly exceed those in the RP model in the vicinity of the crossover. We
show that upon introducing an extension to the RP model, one correctly
reproduces the fluctuations in all regimes, i.e., in the ergodic and nonergodic
regimes as well as at the crossover between them. Finally, we demonstrate how
to reduce the sample-to-sample fluctuations in both studied microscopic models.

The exciton recombination and spin dynamics in (In,Al)As/AlAs quantum dots
(QDs) with indirect band gap and type-I band alignment are studied. The
negligible (less than $0.2~\mu$eV) value of the anisotropic exchange
interaction in these QDs prevents a mixing of the excitonic basis states with
pure spin and allows for the formation of spin polarized bright excitons for
quasi-resonant circularly polarized excitation. In a longitudinal magnetic
field, the recombination and spin dynamics of the excitons are controlled by
the hyperfine interaction between the electron and nuclear spins. A QD blockade
by dark excitons is observed in magnetic field eliminating the impact of the
nuclear spin fluctuations. A kinetic equation model, which accounts for the
population dynamics of the bright and dark exciton states as well as for the
spin dynamics, has been developed, which allows for a quantitative description
of the experimental data.

Accurate first-principles predictions of the structural, electronic,

Li$_x$Mn$_2$O$_4$ and Li$_x$Mn$_{1.5}$Ni$_{0.5}$O$_4$ are promising candidates
for Li-ion battery technologies, but they present serious challenges when it
comes to their first-principles modeling. Here, we use density-functional
theory with extended Hubbard functionals - DFT+$U$+$V$ with on-site $U$ and
inter-site $V$ Hubbard interactions - to study the properties of these
transition-metal oxides. The Hubbard parameters are computed from
first-principles using density-functional perturbation theory. We show that
while $U$ is crucial to obtain the right trends in properties of these
materials, $V$ is essential for a quantitative description of the structural
and electronic properties, as well as the Li-intercalation voltages. This work
paves the way for reliable first-principles studies of other families of

this work were previously observed in epitaxy experiments. A non-equilibrium
interface can transform to a more stable state by a mechanism that we call
interface-induced recrystallization. Diffusion of both Al and Si atoms in
stable Al-Si interfaces is surprisingly slow compared with diffusion of both
elements in Al grain boundaries but can be accelerated in the presence of
interface disconnections. A qualitative explanation of the sluggish interphase
boundary diffusion is proposed. Atomic mechanisms of interphase boundary
diffusion are similar to those in metallic grain boundaries and are dominated
by correlated atomic rearrangements in the form of strings and rings of
collectively moving atoms.

Characterizing long-range electric fields and built-in potentials in
functional materials at nano- to micrometer scales is of supreme importance for
optimizing devices. E.g., the functionality of semiconductor heterostructures
or battery materials is determined by the electric fields established at
interfaces which can also vary spatially. In this study, we propose
momentum-resolved four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy
(4D-STEM) for the quantification of these potentials and show the optimization
steps required to reach quantitative agreement with simulations for the GaAs /
AlAs hetero-junction model system. Using STEM the differences in the mean inner
potentials (DELTA MIP) of two materials forming an interface and resulting
dynamic diffraction effects have to be considered. We show that the measurement
quality is significantly improved by precession, energy filtering and a
non-zone-axis alignment of the specimen. Complementary simulations yielding a
DELTA MIP of 1.3 V confirm that the potential drop due to charge transfer at
the intrinsic interface is about 0.1 V, in agreement with experimental and
theoretical values found in literture. These results show the feasibility of
accurately measuring built-in potentials across hetero-interfaces of real
device structures and its promising application for more complex interfaces of
other polycrystalline materials on the nanometer scale.

Due to the Klein tunneling effect in graphene, it is impossible to confine or
permanently localize electrons inside the graphene quantum dot. However, an
electron can be transiently trapped inside the quantum dot under the effect of
a constant magnetic field, which will have the so-called "quasi-bound states"
characterized by a finite lifetime. In order to improve the trapping time of
the electrons inside the quantum dot, we will add a mass term to the
Hamiltonian, creating an energy gap. We solve the Dirac equation to determine
the energy spectrum, using the continuity of the eigenspinors at the edges to
study the scattering phenomenon. We find that the energy gap can increase the
lifetime of the quasi bound states inside the quantum dot. In addition, we show
that even in the absence of the magnetic field, the scattering efficiency can
reach considerable levels when the energy gap is closed to the incident energy
of the electron passing through the quantum dot. It is found that the density
inside the quantum dot is enhanced, resulting in an improvement in the trapping
time of the electrons.

Liquid structure carries deep imprints of an inherent thermal invariance
against a spatial transformation of the underlying classical many-body
Hamiltonian. At first order in the transformation field the Noether theorem
yields the local force balance. Three distinct two-body correlation functions
emerge at second order, namely the standard two-body density, the localized
force-force correlation function, and the localized force gradient. An exact
Noether sum rule interrelates these correlators. Simulations of Lennard-Jones
and Weeks-Chandler-Andersen liquids, of monatomic water and of a colloidal gel
former demonstrate their fundamental role in the characterization of spatial
structure.

Uncertainty quantification (UQ) plays a critical role in verifying and
validating forward integrated computational materials engineering (ICME)
models. Among numerous ICME models, the crystal plasticity finite element
method (CPFEM) is a powerful tool that enables one to assess
microstructure-sensitive behaviors and thus, bridge material structure to
performance. Nevertheless, given its nature of constitutive model form and the
randomness of microstructures, CPFEM is exposed to both aleatory uncertainty
(microstructural variability), as well as epistemic uncertainty (parametric and
model-form error). Therefore, the observations are often corrupted by the
microstructure-induced uncertainty, as well as the ICME approximation and
numerical errors. In this work, we highlight several ongoing research topics in
UQ, optimization, and machine learning applications for CPFEM to efficiently
solve forward and inverse problems.

<h3>Quantum exploration of high-dimensional canyon landscapes</h3>

Canyon landscapes in high dimension can be described as manifolds of small,
but extensive dimension, immersed in a higher dimensional ambient space and
characterized by a zero potential energy on the manifold. Here we consider the
problem of a quantum particle exploring a prototype of a high-dimensional
random canyon landscape. We characterize the thermal partition function and
show that around the point where the classical phase space has a satisfiability
transition so that zero potential energy canyons disappear, moderate quantum
fluctuations have a deleterious effect and induce glassy phases at temperature
where classical thermal fluctuations alone would thermalize the system.
Surprisingly we show that even when, classically, diffusion is expected to be
unbounded in space, the interplay between quantum fluctuations and the
randomness of the canyon landscape conspire to have a confining effect.

<h3>Collective Vortical Motion and Vorticity Reversals of Self-Propelled  Particles on Circularly Patterned Substrates</h3>

The collective behavior of self-propelled particles (SPPs) under the combined
effects of a circularly patterned substrate and circular confinement is
investigated through coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of polarized
and disjoint ring polymers. The study is performed over a wide range of values
of the SPPs packing fraction $\bar\phi$, motility force $F_D$, and area
fraction of the patterned region. At low packing fractions, the SPPs are
excluded from the system's center and exhibit a vortical motion that is
dominated by the substrate at intermediate values of $F_D$. This exclusion zone
is due to the coupling between the driving force and torque induced by the
substrate, which induces an outward spiral motion of the SPPs. For high values
of $F_D$, the SPPs exclusion from the center is dominated by the confining
boundary. At high values of $\bar\phi$, the substrate pattern leads to
reversals in the vorticity, which become quasi-periodic with increasing
$\bar\phi$. We also found that the substrate pattern is able to separate SPPs
based on their motilities.

Two-dimensional coherent terahertz spectroscopy (2DCS) emerges as a valuable
tool to probe the nature, couplings, and lifetimes of excitations in quantum
materials. It thus promises to identify unique signatures of spin liquid states
in quantum magnets by directly probing properties of their exotic
fractionalized excitations. Here, we calculate the second-order 2DCS of the
Kitaev honeycomb model and demonstrate that distinct spin liquid fingerprints
appear already in this lowest-order nonlinear response
$\chi^{(2)}_{yzx}(\omega_1, \omega_2)$ when using crossed light polarizations.
We further relate the off-diagonal 2DCS peaks to the localized nature of the
matter Majorana excitations trapped by $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux excitations and show
that 2DCS thus directly probes the inverse participation ratio of Majorana
wavefunctions. By providing experimentally observable features of spin liquid
states in the 2D spectrum, our work can guide future 2DCS experiments on Kitaev
magnets.

<h3>Lattice models for ballistic aggregation: cluster-shape dependent  exponents</h3>

We study ballistic aggregation on a two dimensional square lattice, where
particles move ballistically in between momentum and mass conserving coalescing
collisions. Three models are studied based on the shapes of the aggregates: in
the first the aggregates remain point particles, in the second they retain the
fractal shape at the time of collision, and in the third they assume a
spherical shape. The exponents describing the power law temporal decay of
number of particles and energy as well as dependence of velocity correlations
on mass are determined using large scale Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown
that the exponents are universal only for the point particle model. In the
other two cases, the exponents are dependent on the initial number density and
correlations vanish at high number densities. The fractal dimension for the
second model is close to 1.49.

We perform cluster aggregation simulations to model the structure of
anisotropic aerogel. By biasing the diffusion process, we are able to obtain
two distinct types of globally anisotropic aerogel structures which we call
"nematic", with long strands along the anisotropy axis, and "planar", with long
strands in planes perpendicular to the anisotropy axis. We calculate the
auto-correlation function, the structure factor, and the angular dependence of
the free-path distribution for these samples. The calculated structure factor
from simulated aerogels can be compared with data from small-angle X-ray
scattering (SAXS) of lab-grown aerogel allowing us to classify the spatial
structure of the lab-grown samples. We find that the simulated "nematic"
aerogel has a structure factor consistent with lab-grown, axially-compressed
silica aerogel while the simulated "planar" aerogel has a structure factor
consistent with lab-grown "stretched" silica aerogel. Unexpectedly, compressing
previously isotropic silica aerogel leads to the formation of long strands
along the compression axis while stretching silica aerogel leads to formation
of planes perpendicular to the stretching axis. We discuss the implication of
this determination on experiments of superfluid $^3$He in anisotropic aerogel,
in particular the orbital analog of the spin-flop transition.

The assignment of an exact space group to the tetragonal CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$
perovskite structure is experimentally challenging and controversial in the
literature. Average orientation of the methylammonium ion that gives symmetry
to the experimental measurement is not captured in a static density functional
theory calculation, although the quasi-I4cm and quasi-I4/mcm structures are
commonly used in calculations. In this work we have developed a methodology to
quantify the hidden symmetry of these structures using group theory, to enable
use of symmetries in understanding spectroscopy and other properties. We study
the approximate symmetry of vibrational modes, including analysis of degenerate
representations, as well as the dielectric, elastic, electro-optic, Born
effective charge, and Raman tensors and the dynamical matrix. Comparing to each
subgroup of the full tetragonal D$_{4h}$, our results show that the quasi-I4cm
is best described by the expected corresponding point group C$_{4v}$, whereas
the quasi-I4/mcm (despite corresponding to point group D$_{4h}$) is best
described by the lower symmetry C$_{2v}$. Our methodology can be useful
generally for analysis of other soft hybrid materials or any approximately
symmetric material.

The ability to tune quantum tunneling is key for achieving selectivity in
manipulation of individual particles in quantum technology applications. In
this work we count electron escape events out of a time-dependent confinement
potential, realized as a dynamic quantum dot in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure.
A universal scaling relation of the escape probability as a function of
potential barrier risetime and depth is established and developed as a method
to probe tunneling rates over many orders of magnitude reaching limits of WKB
approximation as the anharmonicity of shallow confinement becomes relevant.
Crossover to thermally activated transport is used to estimate the single
time-energy scale of the universal model. In application to metrological single
electron sources, in-situ calibrated control signals greatly extend the
accessible dynamical range for probing the quantization mechanism. Validation
of the cubic potential approximation sets a foundation for microscopic modeling
of quantum tunneling devices in the shallow confinement regime.

We present the exact dimer ground state of a quantum antiferromagnet defined
on a quasicrystal constructed from the Bronze-mean hexagonal quasicrystal. A
coupling isotropy on the first and second-neighbor bonds is sufficient to
stabilize a product state of singlets on the third-neighbor bonds. We also
provide a systematic approach for constructing additional crystals,
quasicrystals, and amorphous structures that can sustain an exact dimer ground
state.
