<h3>Dispersion of run-and-tumble microswimmers through disordered media</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04538" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04538</a>

<i>David Saintillan</i>

Understanding the transport properties of microorganisms and self-propelled
particles in porous media has important implications for human health as well
as microbial ecology. In free space, most microswimmers perform diffusive
random walks as a result of the interplay of self-propulsion and orientation
decorrelation mechanisms such as run-and-tumble dynamics or rotational
diffusion. In an unstructured porous medium, collisions with the microstructure
result in a decrease in the effective spatial diffusivity of the particles from
its free-space value. Here, we analyze this problem for a simple model system
consisting of non-interacting point particles performing run-and-tumble
dynamics through a two-dimensional disordered medium composed of a random
distribution of circular obstacles, in the absence of Brownian diffusion or
hydrodynamic interactions. The particles are assumed to collide with the
obstacles as hard spheres and subsequently slide on the obstacle surface with
no frictional resistance while maintaining their orientation, until they either
escape or tumble. We show that the variations in the long-time diffusivity can
be described by a universal dimensionless hindrance function
$f(\phi,\mathrm{Pe})$ of the obstacle area fraction $\phi$ and P\'eclet number
$\mathrm{Pe}$, or ratio of the swimmer run length to the obstacle size. We
analytically derive an asymptotic expression for the hindrance function valid
for dilute media ($\mathrm{Pe}\,\phi\ll 1$), and its extension to denser media
is obtained using stochastic simulations.

<h3>Effective model for Pb9Cu(PO4)6O</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04480" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04480</a>

<br>
<br>
The copper substituted Pb-apatite has attracted a great deal of attention
recently, due to the claim of the observation of room temperature
superconductivity. Based on LDA calculations in the literature, we propose an
effective model that describe the low energy physics. It consists of stacks of
buckled honeycomb lattices, with Cu and O occupying the A and B sites
respectively. In addition to the narrow Cu bands that have been emphasized, we
call attention to the relatively small energy separation between the Cu and O
orbitals. Thus despite the small hoping energies, the model may be in an
interesting regime near the metal insulator transition driven by the charge
transfer mechanism. Relationship with cuprates and the organic superconductors
are discussed.

<h3>Landau Theory of Altermagnetism</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04484" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04484</a>
<br>
<i>Paul A. McClarty, Jeffrey G. Rau</i>
<br>
<br>
We formulate a Landau theory for altermagnets, a class of colinear
compensated magnets with spin-split bands. Starting from the non-relativistic
limit, this Landau theory goes beyond a conventional analysis by including
spin-space symmetries, providing a simple framework for understanding the key
features of this family of materials. We find a set of multipolar secondary
order parameters connecting existing ideas about the spin symmetries of these
systems, their order parameters and the effect of non-zero spin-orbit coupling.
We account for several features of canonical altermagnets such as RuO$_2$, MnTe
and CuF$_2$ that go beyond symmetry alone, relating the order parameter to key
observables such as magnetization, anomalous Hall conductivity and
magneto-elastic and magneto-optical probes. Finally, we comment on
generalizations of our framework to a wider family of exotic magnetic systems
deriving from the zero spin-orbit coupled limit.

<h3>Gapped Interfaces in Fracton Models and Foliated Fields</h3>

<i>Po-Shen Hsin, Zhu-Xi Luo, Ananth Malladi</i>
<br>
<br>
This work investigates the gapped interfaces of 3+1d fracton phases of matter
using foliated gauge theories and lattice models. We analyze the gapped
boundaries and gapped interfaces in X cube model, and the gapped interfaces
between the X-cube model and the toric code. The gapped interfaces are either
"undecorated" or "decorated", where the "decorated" interfaces have additional
Chern-Simons like actions for foliated gauge fields. We discover many new
gapped boundaries and interfaces, such as (1) a gapped boundary for X-cube
model where the electric lineons orthogonal to the interface become the
magnetic lineons, the latter are the composite of magnetic planons; (2) a
Kramers-Wannier-duality type gapped interface between the X-cube model and the
toric code model from gauging planar subsystem one-form symmetry; and (3) an
electromagnetic duality interface in the X-cube model that exchanges the
electric and magnetic lineons.

<h3>A tensor density measure of topological charge in three dimensional  nematic phases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04496" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04496</a>
<br>
<i>Cody D. Schimming, Jorge Vi√±als</i>
<br>
<br>
A path independent measure in order parameter space is introduced such that,
when integrated along any closed contour in a three dimensional nematic phase,
it yields the topological charge of any line defects encircled by the contour.
A related measure, when integrated over either closed or open surfaces, reduces
to known results for the charge associated with point defects (hedgehogs) or
Skyrmions. We further define a tensor density, the disclination density tensor
$\mathbf{D}$, from which the location of a disclination line can be determined.
This tensor density has a dyadic decomposition near the line into its tangent
and its rotation vector, allowing a convenient determination of both. The
tensor $\mathbf{D}$ may be nonzero in special configurations in which there are
no defects (double-splay or double-twist configurations), and its behavior
there is provided. The special cases of Skyrmions and hedgehog defects are also
examined, including the computation of their topological charge from $
\mathbf{D}$.

<h3>Magnetic Phases of Bilayer Quantum-Dot Hubbard Model Plaquettes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04504" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04504</a>
<br>
<i>Donovan Buterakos, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<br>
<br>
It has been demonstrated that small plaquettes of quantum dot spin qubits are
capable of simulating condensed matter phenomena which arise from the Hubbard
model, such as the collective Coulomb blockade and Nagaoka ferromagnetism.
Motivated by recent materials developments, we investigate a bilayer
arrangement of quantum dots with four dots in each layer which exhibits a
complex ground state behavior. We find using a generalized Hubbard model with
long-range Coulomb interactions, several distinct magnetic phases occur as the
Coulomb interaction strength is varied, with possible ground states that are
ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, or having both one antiferromagnetic and one
ferromagnetic layer. We map out the full phase diagram of the system as it
depends on the inter- and intra-layer Coulomb interaction strengths, and find
that for a single layer, a similar but simpler effect occurs. We also predict
interesting contrasts among electron, hole, and electron-hole bilayer systems
arising from complex correlation physics. Observing the predicted magnetic
configuration in already-existing few-dot semiconductor bilayer structures
could prove to be an important assessment of current experimental quantum dot
devices, particularly in the context of spin-qubit-based analog quantum
simulations.

<h3>Spectral structure and doublon dissociation in the two-particle  non-Hermitian Hubbard model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04505" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04505</a>
<br>
<i>Stefano Longhi</i>
<br>
<br>
Strongly-correlated systems in non-Hermitian models are an emergent area of
research. Here we consider a non-Hermitian Hubbard model, where the
single-particle hopping amplitudes on the lattice are not reciprocal, and
provide exact analytical results of the spectral structure in the two-particle
sector of Hilbert space under different boundary conditions. The analysis
unveils some interesting spectral and dynamical effects of purely non-Hermitian
nature and that deviate from the usual scenario found in the single-particle
regime. Specifically, we predict a spectral phase transition of the
Mott-Hubbard band on the infinite lattice as the interaction energy is
increased above a critical value, from an open to a closed loop in complex
energy plane, and the dynamical dissociation of doublons, i.e. instability of
two-particle bound states, in the bulk of the lattice, with a sudden revival of
the doublon state when the two particles reach the lattice edge. Particle
dissociation observed in the bulk of the lattice is a clear manifestation of
non-Hermitian dynamics arising from the different lifetimes of single-particle
and two-particle states, whereas the sudden revival of the doublon state at the
boundaries is a striking burst edge dynamical effect peculiar to non-Hermitian
systems with boundary-dependent energy spectra, here predicted for the first
time for correlated particles.

<h3>Superconductivity from incoherent Cooper pairs in strong-coupling regime</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04508" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04508</a>
<br>
<i>Alexander A. Zyuzin, A. Yu. Zyuzin</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a scenario for superconductivity at strong electron-electron
attractive interaction, in the situation when the increase of interaction
strength promotes the nucleation of the local Cooper pairs and forms a state
with a spatially phase incoherent Cooper pair order parameter. We show that
this state can be characterized by a pseudogap and a scattering rate, which are
determined by the self-energy due to electron scattering on phase fluctuations.
At low temperatures, however, long-range correlations between the regions with
different phases become important and establish global phase coherence hence
superconductivity in the system. We develop a mean-field theory to describe a
phase transition between the preformed Cooper pair and superconducting states.
This scenario of superconductivity applies not only to conductors with
parabolic bands but also to the flat-band systems in which flat and dispersive
bands coexist and responsible for the Cooper pair formation as well as their
phase synchronization.

<h3>Independent characterization of the elastic and the mixing parts of  hydrogel osmotic pressure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04533" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04533</a>
<br>
<i>Zefan Shao, Qihan Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
Osmotic pressure is the driving force for the swelling of hydrogels. The
hydrogel osmotic pressure can be decomposed into two parts: the mixing part due
to polymer-solvent interaction and the elastic part due to polymer chain
stretching. While the two components are distinguished in existing constitutive
models, they have not been independently characterized in experiments. This
paper reports a novel method to independently measure these two components
using a fully constrained swelling test. The test allows the crosslink density
to be varied at a fixed polymer content, thus varying the elastic part
independently of the mixing part. Our measurement shows that the widely used
Flory-Rehner model predicts the mixing part accurately for polyacrylamide
hydrogel of a wide range of swelling ratios but predicts the elastic part with
orders-of-magnitude error.

<h3>Spin-polarized superconducting phase in semiconducting system with  next-nearest-neighbor hopping on the honeycomb lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04547" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04547</a>
<br>
<i>Agnieszka Cichy, Konrad J. Kapcia, Andrzej Ptok</i>
<br>
<br>
The particles in the honeycomb lattice with on-site $s$-wave pairing exhibit
many interesting behaviors, which can be described in the framework of the
Hubbard model. Among others, at the half-filling, some critical value $|U_c|$
of pairing interaction $U<0$ exists that, for $U<U_c$, the superconducting
phase becomes unstable. Introduction of the nonzero hopping $t'$ between
next-nearest-neighbor sites strongly modifies the physical properties of the
system. Here, we discuss the behavior of the system for $t' \neq 0$ (at the
ground state), where the hopping between next-nearest neighbors leads to change
of the order of phase transition between superconducting and normal phases from
discontinuous to continuous one in the external magnetic field $h$. We show
that this behavior is strongly dependent on $t'$ and associated with the Dirac
cones in the non-interacting band structure of the system. For non-zero
magnetic field and for some range of $t'$, a spin-polarized superconducting
phase occurs in the ground state phase diagram (only at the half-filling and
for $h\neq 0$).

<h3>Effect of dynamics on anomalous thermal relaxations and information  exchange</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04557" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04557</a>
<br>
<i>Saikat Bera, Matthew R. Walker, Marija Vucelja</i>
<br>
<br>
The Mpemba effect, an example of anomalous thermal relaxations, occurs when a
system prepared at a hot temperature overtakes an identical system prepared at
a warm temperature and cools down faster to the environment's temperature. We
study the Mpemba effect in Markov jump processes on linear reaction networks as
a function of the relaxation dynamics. The dynamics are characterized by a load
distribution factor introduced to control the transition rates in a manner that
obeys detailed balance. We provide analytical results and insights on when the
Mpemba effect happens in the unimolecular reactions of three species as a
function of the dynamics. In particular, we derive that the regions of the
Strong Mpemba effect in cooling and heating are non-overlapping and that there
is, at most, a single Strong Mpemba temperature. Next, we illustrate our
results on a Maxwell demon setup, where we show that one can utilize the strong
variant of the Mpemba effect to have shorter cycles of the Maxwell demon
device, leading to increased power output, and stable device operation, without
sacrificing efficiency.

<br>
<br>
MnSiN$_2$ is a transition metal nitride with Mn and Si ions displaying an
ordered distribution on the cation sites of a distorted wurtzite-derived
structure. The Mn$^{2+}$ ions reside on a 3D diamond-like covalent network with
strong superexchange pathways. We simulate its electronic structure and find
that the N anions in MnSiN$_2$ act as $\sigma$- and $\pi$-donors, which serve
to enhance the N-mediated superexchange, leading to the high N\'{e}el ordering
temperature of $T_N$ = 443 K. Polycrystalline samples of MnSiN$_2$ were
prepared to reexamine the magnetic structure and resolve previously reported
discrepancies. An additional magnetic canting transition is observed at
$T_\mathrm{cant}$ = 433 K and the precise canted ground state magnetic
structure has been resolved using a combination of DFT calculations and powder
neutron diffraction. The calculations favor a $G$-type antiferromagnetic spin
order with lowering to $Pc^\prime$. Irreducible representation analysis of the
magnetic Bragg peaks supports the lowering of the magnetic symmetry. The
computed model includes a 10$^\circ$ rotation of the magnetic spins away from
the crystallographic $c$-axis consistent with measured powder neutron
diffraction data modeling and a small canting of 0.6$^\circ$.

<h3>Decoding the Mechanisms of Reversibility Loss in Rechargeable Zinc-Air  Batteries</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04572" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04572</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Attaining high reversibility of electrodes and electrolyte is essential for
the longevity of secondary batteries. Rechargeable zinc-air batteries (RZABs),
however, encounter drastic irreversible changes in the zinc anodes and air
cathodes during cycling. To uncover the mechanisms of reversibility loss in
RZABs, we investigate the evolution of zinc anode, alkaline electrolyte, and
air electrode through experiments and first-principles calculations. Morphology
diagrams of zinc anodes under versatile operating conditions reveal that the
nano-sized mossy zinc dominates the later cycling stage. Such anodic change is
induced by the increased zincate concentration due to hydrogen evolution, which
is catalyzed by the mossy structure and results in oxide passivation on
electrodes, and eventually leads to low true Coulombic efficiencies and short
lifespans of batteries. Inspired by these findings, we finally present a novel
overcharge-cycling protocol to compensate the Coulombic efficiency loss caused
by hydrogen evolution and significantly extend the battery life.

<h3>Geometrical frustration and incommensurate magnetic order in  Na$_3$RuO$_4$ with two triangular motifs</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04573" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04573</a>
<br>
<i>Vera P. Bader, Clemens Ritter, Elias Papke, Philipp Gegenwart, Alexander A. Tsirlin</i>
<br>
<br>
Incommensurate magnetic order in the spin-3/2 antiferromagnet Na$_3$RuO$_4$
is uncovered by neutron diffraction combined with ab initio calculations. The
crystal structure of Na$_3$RuO$_4$ contains two triangular motifs on different
length scales. The magnetic Ru$^{5+}$ ions form a lozenge (diamond)
configuration, with tetramers composed of two isosceles triangles. These
tetramers are further arranged in layers, such that an effective triangular
lattice is formed. The tetramers are nearly antiferromagnetic but frustration
between them leads to an incommensurately modulated magnetic structure
described by the propagation vector $\vec{k}=(0.242(1), 0, 0.313(1))$. We show
that the long-range Ru-O-O-Ru couplings between the tetramers play a major role
in Na$_3$RuO$_4$ and suggest an effective description in terms of the spatially
anisotropic triangular lattice if the tetramers are treated as single sites.

<h3>Random packing dynamics of $Œ£_{2v}(2œÄ/3)$-triplets</h3>

<br>
<i>Carlos Handrey Araujo Ferraz</i>
<br>
<br>
In this letter, we used a combination of DEM and the multi-sphere method to
investigate the random packing dynamics of $\Sigma_{2v}(2\pi/3)$-triplets.
These triplets consist of three overlapping primary spheres, forming a bent
structure with a bond angle of $2\pi/3$ and belonging to the $C_{2v}$ symmetry
group. The selection of this specific structure was motivated by its similarity
to molecules such as water, which displays crucial physicochemical properties
and finds extensive application in various fields. To ensure non-overlapping
particles at the beginning of the simulations, the rectangular confinement box
was divided into basic cells. Each triplet was then inserted into a basic cell
with a random orientation. After that, the system is allowed to settle under
gravity towards the bottom of the box. An implicit leapfrog algorithm with
quaternion acceleration was used to numerically integrate the rotational motion
equations. By assuming a molecular approach, we account for the long-range
cohesive forces using a Lennard-Jones (LJ)-like potential. The packing
processes are studied assuming different long-range interaction strengths. We
performed statistical calculations of the different quantities studied
including packing density, radial distribution function, and orientation pair
correlation function. In addition, the force probability distributions in the
random packing structures have been analyzed.

<h3>Giant magnetic and optical anisotropy in cerium-substituted M-type  strontium hexaferrite driven by 4$f$ electrons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04594" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04594</a>
<br>
<i>Churna Bhandari, Durga Paudyal</i>
<br>
<br>
By performing density functional calculations, we find a giant
magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) constant in abundant element cerium (Ce)
substituted M-type hexaferrite, in the energetically favorable strontium site,
assisted by a quantum confined electron transfer from Ce to specific iron (2a)
site. Remarkably, the calculated electronic structure shows that the electron
transfer leads to the formation of Ce$^{3+}$ and Fe$^{2+}$ at the $2a$ site
producing an occupied Ce($4f^1$) state below the Fermi level that adds a
significant contribution to MCA and magnetic moment. A half Ce-substitution
forms a metallic state, while a full substitution retains the semiconducting
state of the strontium-hexaferrite (host). In the latter, the band gap is
reduced due to the formation of charge transferred states in the gap region of
the host. The optical absorption coefficient shows an enhanced anisotropy
between light polarization in parallel and perpendicular directions. Calculated
formation energies, including the analysis of probable competing phases, and
elastic constants confirm that both compositions are chemically and
mechanically stable. With successful synthesis, the Ce-hexaferrite can be a new
high-performing critical-element-free permanent magnet material adapted for use
in devices such as automotive traction drive motors.

This paper presents the topological analysis of the complex
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model using two methods: Berry phase and topological
data analysis. We demonstrate how both methods can effectively generate
topological phase diagrams for the model, revealing two distinct regions based
on the relative magnitudes of the parameters $|v|$ and $|w|$. Specifically,
when $|v| > |w|$, the system is found to be topologically trivial, whereas for
$|v| < |w|$, it exhibits topologically non-trivial behaviour. Our results
contribute to building the groundwork for topological analysis of more
complicated SSH-type models.

<h3>Topological interfacial states in ferroelectric domain walls of  two-dimensional bismuth</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04633" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04633</a>
<br>
<i>Wei Luo, Yang Zhong, Hongyu Yu, Muting Xie, Yingwei Chen, Hongjun Xiang, Laurent Bellaiche</i>
<br>
<br>
Using machine learning method, we investigate various domain walls for the
recently discovered single-element ferroelectrics bismuth monolayer (Nature
617, 67 (2023)). We find the charged domain wall configuration has a lower
energy than the uncharged domain wall structure due to its low electrostatic
repusion potential. Two stable charged domain wall configurations exhibit
topological interfacial states near their domain walls, which is caused by the
change of the Z_2 number between ferroelectric and paraelectric states.
Interestingly, different from the edge states of topological insulators, the
energies of topological interfacial states for these two structure are splited
due to the build-in electric fields in ferroelectrics. We also find a stable
uncharged domain wall configutation can reduce band gap which is caused by the
domain wall. Our works indicate that domain walls in two-dimensional bismuth
may be a good platform for ferroelectric domain wall devices.

<h3>Adsorption superlattice stabilized by elastic interactions in a soft  porous crystal</h3>

<br>
<i>Kota Mitsumoto, Kyohei Takae</i>
<br>
<br>
We numerically show that molecules adsorbed in a soft porous crystal form a
superlattice (SL) stabilized by elastic interactions. In a mechanically
flexible honeycomb lattice model, when the elastic interactions between the
next nearest neighboring lattice sites are strong, a long-range ordered
1/3-filling SL state emerges. By calculating the thermodynamic stability, it is
found that the SL state is robust against thermal fluctuation. Our results
provide a mechanism of elasticity-driven SL formation, which can be utilized
for controlling the distribution of adsorbed molecules.

<h3>Collective deformation modes promote fibrous self-assembly in  protein-like particles</h3>

<br>
<br>
The self-assembly of particles into organized structures is a key feature of
living organisms and a major engineering challenge. While it may proceed
through the binding of perfectly matched, puzzle-pieces-like particles, many
other instances involve ill-fitting particles that must deform to fit together.
These include some pathological proteins, which have a known propensity to form
fibrous aggregates. Despite this observation, the general relationship between
the individual characteristics of the particles and the overall structure of
the aggregate is not understood. To elucidate it, we analytically and
numerically study the self-assembly of two-dimensional, deformable ill-fitting
particles. We find that moderately sticky particles tend to form equilibrium
self-limited aggregates whose size is set by an elastic boundary layer
associated with collective deformations that may extend over many particles.
Particles with a soft internal deformation mode thus give rise to large
aggregates. Besides, when the particles are incompressible, their aggregates
tend to be anisotropic and fiber-like. Our results are preserved in a more
complex particle model with randomly chosen elastic properties. This indicates
that generic protein characteristics such as allostery and incompressibility
could favor the formation of fibers in protein aggregation, and suggests design
principles for artificial self-assembling structures.

<br>
<br>
Here, using unique in-situ liquid secondary ion mass spectroscopy on
isotope-labelled solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI), assisted by cryogenic
transmission electron microscopy and constrained ab initio molecular dynamics
simulation, for the first time we answer the question regarding Li+ transport
mechanism across SEI, and quantitatively determine the Li+-mobility therein. We
unequivocally unveil that Li+ transport in SEI follows a mechanism of
successive displacement, rather than "direct-hopping". We further reveal, in
accordance with spatial-dependence of SEI structure across the thickness, the
apparent Li+ self-diffusivity varies from 6.7*10-19 m2/s to 1.0*10-20 m2/s,
setting a quantitative gauging of ionic transport behavior of SEI layer against
the underlining electrode as well as the rate limiting step of battery
operation. This direct study on Li+ kinetics in SEI fills part of the
decade-long knowledge gap about the most important component in advanced
batteries and provides more precise guidelines to the tailoring of interphasial
chemistries for future battery chemistries.

The pursuit of understanding parity anomaly in condensed matter systems has
led to significant advancements in both theoretical and experimental research
in recent years. In this study, we explore the parity anomaly of massless Dirac
fermions in a semimagnetic topological insulator (TI) thin film subjected to a
finite magnetic field. Our findings reveal an anomalous half-quantized Hall
conductance arising from the occupied electronic states far below the Fermi
level, which is directly associated with the parity anomaly. This observation
demonstrates a crossover from one-half quantized Hall conductance in a metallic
phase at zero field to one or zero quantized Hall conductance in the insulating
phase at a strong field in the presence of disorders, serving as a key
indicator for confirming parity anomaly. Our work provides valuable insights
into the intricate relationship between band topology in condensed matter
systems and quantum anomaly in quantum field theory.

We theoretically investigate in-medium three-body correlations in
one-dimensional spinless fermions with antisymmetrized two- and three-body
attractive interactions. By investigating the variational problem of three-body
states above the Fermi sea, we illuminate the fate of the in-medium three-body
cluster states both in the special case with pure attractive three-body
interaction as well as in the case with the coexistence of two- and three-body
interactions. Our results testify that the fermion-dimer repulsion is canceled
by including the three-body interactions, and stable three-body clusters can be
formed. We further feature a phase diagram consisting of the $p$-wave Cooper
pairing and Cooper tripling phases in a plane of $p$-wave two- and three-body
coupling strengths.

Considering bosonic atoms immersed in a dilute Fermi gas, we theoretically
investigate medium-induced bosonic clusters associated with fermion-mediated
two- and three-body interactions. Using the variational approach combined with
the fermion-mediated interactions, we numerically calculate the binding
energies of two- and three-body bosonic clusters in a one-dimensional system.
It is found that the bosonic clusters can be formed even with a repulsive
boson-boson interaction due to the fermion-mediated interactions. Our results
would be relevant for ultracold atomic systems as well as analogue quantum
simulations of alpha clusters in neutron-rich matter.

<h3>Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulations of Sodium Ion Transport in NaSICON  Electrodes</h3>

<br>
<br>
The development of high-performance sodium (Na) ion batteries requires
improved electrode materials. The energy and power densities of Na superionic
conductor (NaSICON) electrode materials are promising for large-scale energy
storage applications. However, several practical issues limit the full
utilization of the theoretical energy densities of NaSICON electrodes. A
pressing challenge lies in the limited sodium extraction in low Na content
NaSICONs, e.g., $\rm Na_1V^{IV}V^{IV}(PO_4)_3 \leftrightarrow
V^{V}V^{IV}(PO_4)_3 + 1e^- + 1Na^+$. Hence, it is important to quantify the
Na-ion mobility in a broad range of NaSICON electrodes. Using a kinetic Monte
Carlo approach bearing the accuracy of first-principles calculations, we
elucidate the variability of Na-ion transport vs. Na content in three important
NaSICON electrodes, Na$_{\rm x}$Ti$_{2}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$, Na$_{\rm
x}$V$_{2}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$, and Na$_{\rm x}$Cr$_{2}$(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$. Our study
suggests that Na$^+$ transport in NaSICON electrodes is almost entirely
determined by the local electrostatic and chemical environment set by the
transition metal and the polyanionic scaffold. The competition with the
ordering-disordering phenomena of Na-vacancies also plays a role in influencing
Na-transport. We link the variations in the Na$^+$ kinetic properties by
analyzing the competition of ligand field stabilization transition metal ions
and their ionic radii. We interpret the limited Na-extraction at $x = 1$
observed experimentally by gaining insights into the local Na-vacancy
interplay. We propose that targeted chemical substitutions of transition metals
disrupting local charge arrangements will be critical to reducing the
occurrence of strong Na$^+$-vacancy orderings at low Na concentrations, thus,
expanding the accessible capacities of these electrode materials.

<h3>Liner response theories for interatomic exchange interactions</h3>

In 1987, Liechtenstein et al. came up with the idea to formulate the problem
of interatomic exchange interactions, which would describe the energy change
caused by the infinitesimal rotations of spins, in terms of the magnetic
susceptibility. The formulation appears to be very generic and, for isotropic
systems, expresses the energy change in the form of the Heisenberg model,
irrespectively on which microscopic mechanism stands behind the interaction
parameters. Moreover, this approach establishes the relationship between the
exchange interactions and the electronic structure obtained, for instance, in
the first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory. The
purpose of this review is to elaborate basic ideas of the linear response
theories for the exchange interactions as well as more resent developments. The
special attention is paid to the approximations underlying the original method
of Liechtenstein et al. in comparison with its more recent and more rigorous
extensions, the roles of the on-site Coulomb interactions and the ligand
states, and calculations of antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions,
which can be performed alongside with the isotropic exchange, within one
computational scheme. The abilities of the linear response theories as well as
many theoretical nuances, which may arise in the analysis of interatomic
exchange interactions, are illustrated on magnetic van der Walls materials
Cr$X_3$ ($X$$=$ Cl, I), half-metallic ferromagnet CrO$_2$, ferromagnetic Weyl
semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$, and orthorhombic manganites $A$MnO$_3$ ($A$$=$ La,
Ho), known for the peculiar interplay of the lattice distortion, spin, and
orbital ordering.

<h3>The Geometry of Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relations in Chemical Reaction  Networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04806" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04806</a>
<br>
<i>Dimitri Loutchko, Yuki Sughiyama, Tetsuya J. Kobayashi</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, Hessian geometry - an extension of information geometry - has
emerged as a framework to naturally connect the geometries appearing in the
theory of chemical reaction networks (CRN) to their inherent thermodynamical
and kinetic properties. This framework is used in this letter to derive
multivariate thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TUR) for CRN. The matrices
featured in the TUR are shown to be representations of Riemmanian metric
tensors, whereby one tensor characterizes the pseudo entropy production rate
and the other the current fluctuations. It is shown that the latter tensor is a
restriction of the former one to a linear subspace in the flux tangent space.
Therefore, in addition to clarifying the geometric origin of TUR in CRN, the
Hessian geometric setup yields a characterization of the error term in the TUR
as the norm of a linear subspace component of the flux vector and thus
characterizes the fluxes where TUR become equalities.

<h3>Competing itinerant and local spin interactions in kagome metal FeGe</h3>

<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional kagome metals consisting of corner-sharing triangles offer a
unique platform for studying strong electron correlations and band topology due
to its geometrically frustrated lattice structure. The similar energy scales
between spin, lattice, and electronic degrees of freedom in these systems give
rise to competing quantum phases such as charge density wave (CDW), magnetic
order, and superconductivity. For example, kagome metal FeGe first exhibits
A-type collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at T_N ~ 400 K, then establishes
a CDW phase coupled with AFM ordered moment below T_CDW ~ 100 K, and finally
forms a $c$-axis double cone AFM structure around T_Canting ~ 60 K. Here we use
neutron scattering to demonstrate the presence of gapless incommensurate spin
excitations associated with the double cone AFM structure at temperatures well
above T_Canting and T_CDW that merge into gapped commensurate spin waves from
the A-type AFM order. While commensurate spin waves follow the Bose population
factor and can be well described by a local moment Heisenberg Hamiltonian, the
incommensurate spin excitations first appear below T_N where AFM order is
commensurate, start to deviate from the Bose population factor around T_CDW,
and peaks at T_Canting, consistent with a critical scattering of a second order
magnetic phase transition, as a function of decreasing temperature. By
comparing these results with density functional theory calculations, we
conclude that the incommensurate magnetic structure arises from the nested
Fermi surfaces of itinerant electrons and the formation of a spin density wave
order. The temperature dependence of the incommensurate spin excitations
suggests a coupling between spin density wave and CDW order, likely due to flat
electronic bands near the Fermi level around T_N and associated electron
correlation effects.

<h3>Josephson transistor from the superconducting diode effect in domain  wall and skyrmion magnetic racetracks</h3>

In superconductors, the combination of broken time-reversal and broken
inversion symmetries can result in a critical current being dependent on the
direction of current flow. This phenomenon is known as superconducting diode
effect (SDE) and has great potential for applications in future low-temperature
electronics. Here, we investigate how magnetic textures such as domain walls or
skyrmions on a racetrack can be used to control the SDE in a Josephson junction
and how the SDE can be used as a low-temperature read-out of the data in
racetrack memory devices. First, we consider a two-dimensional electron gas
(2DEG) with strong spin-orbit-interaction (SOI) coupled to a magnetic
racetrack, which forms the weak-link in a Josephson junction. In this setup,
the exchange coupling between the magnetic texture and the itinerant electrons
in the 2DEG breaks time-reversal symmetry and enables the SDE. When a magnetic
texture, such as a domain wall or skyrmion enters the Josephson junction, the
local exchange field within the junction is changed and, consequently, the
strength of the SDE is altered. In particular, depending on the position and
form of the magnetic texture, moving the magnetic texture can cause the SDE
coefficient to change its sign, enabling a Josephson transistor effect with
potentially fast switching frequencies. Further, we find that the SDE is
enhanced if the junction length-scales are comparable with the length-scale of
the magnetic texture. Furthermore, we show that, under certain circumstances,
the symmetry breaking provided by particular magnetic textures, such as
skyrmions, can lead to an SDE even in the absence of Rashba SOI in the 2DEG.
Our results provide a basis for new forms of readout in low-temperature memory
devices as well as demonstrating how a Josephson transistor effect can be
achieved even in the absence of an external magnetic field and intrinsic Rashba
SOI.

<h3>Tuning the Stability of a Model Quasicrystal and its Approximants with a  Periodic Substrate</h3>

<br>
<br>
Quasicrystals and their periodic approximants are complex phases, which have
by now been observed in many metallic alloys, soft matter systems, and particle
simulations. In recent experiments of thin-film perovskites on solid
substrates, the type of complex phase was found to change depending on
thermodynamic conditions and the type of substrate used. Here, we investigate
the effect of a substrate on the relative stability of a two-dimensional model
quasicrystal and its approximants. Our numerical methods are molecular dynamics
simulations and free energy calculations that take into account phason flips
explicitly. For weak substrates, we observe an incommensurate-commensurate
transition, in which a continuous series of QC approximants locks into a
discrete number of approximants. For stronger substrates, an enhancement of the
stability of the dodecagonal quasicrystal and a variants of square lattices
were found. All phenomena can be explained by the interplay of the model system
with the substrate. Our results demonstrate that designing novel complex
periodic and quasiperiodic structures by choice of suitable substrates is a
promising strategy.

In cuprates, as doping $p$ is reduced from the overdoped side through the
quantum critical point $p^*$, a transition in Hall number density of carriers
is observed, in which this number of carriers reduces from $1+p$ holes per
copper site to $p$ holes per copper site. The connection of this $1+p$ to $p$
transition with pseudogap and with superconductivity is discussed. A
"panoramic" view or a "broad-brush" discussion is presented in which Anderson's
"unhappy" electrons take on a central stage.

<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric (FE) materials are promising compounds for
next-generation nonvolatile memories, due to their low energy consumption and
high endurance. Among them, {\alpha}-In$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ has drawn particular
attention due to its in- and out-of-plane ferroelectricity, whose robustness
has been demonstrated down to the monolayer limit. This is a relatively
uncommon behavior since most bulk FE materials lose their ferroelectric
character at the 2D limit due to depolarization field. Using angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we unveil another unusual 2D phenomena
appearing in 2H \alpha-In$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ single crystals, the occurrence of a
highly metallic two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the surface of
vacuum-cleaved crystals. This 2DEG exhibits two confined states which
correspond to an electron density of approximatively 10$^{13}$
electrons/cm$^{3}$, also confirmed by thermoelectric measurements. Combination
of ARPES and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals a direct band
gap of energy equal to 1.3 +/- 0.1 eV, with the bottom of the conduction band
localized at the center of the Brillouin zone, just below the Fermi level. Such
strong n-type doping further supports the quantum confinement of electrons and
the formation of the 2DEG.

<br>
The layered, air-stable van der Waals antiferromagnetic compound CrSBr
exhibits pronounced coupling between its optical, electronic, and magnetic
properties. As an example, exciton dynamics can be significantly influenced by
lattice vibrations through exciton-phonon coupling. Using low-temperature
photoluminescence spectroscopy, we demonstrate the effective coupling between
excitons and phonons in nanometer-thick CrSBr. By careful analysis, we identify
that the satellite peaks predominantly arise from the interaction between the
exciton and an optical phonon with a frequency of 118 cm-1 (~14.6 meV) due to
the out-of-plane vibration of Br atoms. Power-dependent and
temperature-dependent photoluminescence measurements support exciton-phonon
coupling and indicate a coupling between magnetic and optical properties,
suggesting the possibility of carrier localization in the material. The
presence of strong coupling between the exciton and the lattice may have
important implications for the design of light-matter interactions in magnetic
semiconductors and provides new insights into the exciton dynamics in CrSBr.
This highlights the potential for exploiting exciton-phonon coupling to control
the optical properties of layered antiferromagnetic materials.

We numerically study the dynamics of a passive fluid droplet confined within
a microchannel whose walls are covered with a thin layer of active gel. The
latter represents a fluid of extensile material modelling, for example, a
suspension of cytoskeletal filaments and molecular motors. Our results show
that the layer is capable of producing a spontaneous flow triggering a
rectilinear motion of the passive droplet. For a hybrid design (a single wall
covered by the active layer), at the steady state the droplet attains an
elliptical shape, resulting from an asymmetric saw-toothed structure of the
velocity field. On the contrary, if the active gel covers both walls, the
velocity field exhibits a fully symmetric pattern considerably mitigating
morphological deformations. We further show that the structure of the
spontaneous flow in the microchannel can be controlled by the anchoring
conditions of the active gel at the wall. These findings are also confirmed by
selected 3D simulations. Our results may stimulate further research addressed
to design novel microfludic devices whose functioning relies on the collective
properties of active gels.

The crystal structure of Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O, the proposed matrix for the
potential room-temperature superconductor LK-99, Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O
($x = 0.9-1.0$), has been reinvestigated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction
using crystals prepared by Merker and Wondratschek (Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 1960,
306, 25-29). The crystal structure is trigonal, P-3, a = 9.8109(6), c =
14.8403(12) A, V = 1237.06(15) A3, R1 = 0.0413 using 3456 unique observed
reflections. The crystal structure of Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O is a
superstructure with regard to the standard P63/m apatite structure type. The
doubling of the c parameter is induced by the ordering of additional O atoms
within the structure channels running parallel to the c axis and centered at
(00z). The O atoms form short bonds to the Pb1 atoms, resulting in splitting
the Pb1 site into two, Pb1A and Pb1B. The structural distortions are further
transmitted to the Pb phosphate framework formed by four Pb2 sites and PO$_4$
groups. The structure data previously reported by Krivovichev and Burns (Z.
Kristallogr. 2003, 218, 357-365) may either correspond to the
Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O$_x$(OH)$_{2-x}$ ($x = 0.4$) member of the
Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O-Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$(OH)$_2$ solid solution series, or

The confliction between the stable interface in phase-separated active
Brownian particles and its negative surface tension, obtained mechanically via
the active pressure, has sparked considerable debate about the formula of
active surface tension. Based on the intrinsic pressure of active system, we
here derive a proper mechanical expression of active surface tension by
calculating the work required to create a differential interface area, while
remaining interfacial profile invariant (not considered previously). Our
expression yields a significantly positive surface tension that increases with
the particle actvity, which is supported by mechanical analysis on the
interface. Our results thus fundamentally resolve the contradiction related to
active surface tension.

We report the high-pressure optical floating-zone growth of GdInO$_3$ single
crystals and show its magnetic phase diagram down to the mK-regime as
determined by magnetization measurements. The centered-honeycomb lattice
structure shows considerable magnetic frustration ($\lvert\Theta\rvert /T_{\rm
N}\simeq 5$) and develops long-range magnetic order below $T_{\rm N}$~=~2.1 K
from a short-range ordered paramagnetic phase. Concomitantly, a small net
magnetic moment evolves at $T_{\rm N}$ which points along the crystallographic
$c$ direction. Upon cooling, the net moment reorients at $T^{**}\simeq 1.7$ K
and $T^{*}\simeq 1$ K. A broad 1/3 plateau indicative of the up-up-down ($uud$)
spin configuration appears for $B||c$ but is absent for $B||ab$, thereby
suggesting easy axis anisotropy. At $T=0.4$ K, a jump in magnetization at
$\simeq 3/5$ of the saturation magnetization signals a discontinuous transition
to a high field phase and we find evidence for a possible tricritical point.
Small energy and field scales in the accessible regimes render GdInO$_3$ a
prime example to study the phase diagram of a semiclassical frustrated
hexagonal lattice in the presence of weak easy axis anisotropy of mainly
dipolar origin.

Recent breakthroughs in the transport spectroscopy of 2-D material
quantum-dot platforms have engendered a fervent interest in spin-valley qubits.
In this context, Pauli blockades in double quantum dot structures form an
important basis for multi-qubit initialization and manipulation. Focusing on
double quantum dot structures, and the experimental results, we first build
theoretical models to capture the intricate interplay between externally fed
gate voltages and the physical properties of the 2-D system in such an
architecture, allowing us to effectively simulate Pauli blockades. Employing
the master equations for transport and considering extrinsic factors such as
electron-photon interactions, we thoroughly investigate all potential
occurrences of Pauli blockades. Notably, our research reveals two remarkable
phenomena: (i) the existence of multiple resonances within a bias triangle, and
(ii) the occurrence of multiple Pauli blockades. Leveraging our model to train
a machine learning algorithm, we successfully develop an automated method for
real-time detection of multiple Pauli blockade regimes. Through numerical
predictions and validations against test data, we identify where and how many
Pauli blockades are likely to occur. We propose that our model can effectively
detect the generic class of Pauli blockades in practical experimental setups
and hence serves as the foundation for future experiments on qubits that
utilize 2-D material platforms.

What is the major difference between large and small systems? At small
length-scales the dynamics is dominated by fluctuations, whereas at large
scales fluctuations are irrelevant. Therefore, any thermodynamically consistent
description of quantum systems necessitates a thorough understanding of the
nature and consequences of fluctuations. In this chapter, we outline two
closely related fields of research that are commonly considered separately --
fluctuation forces and fluctuation theorems. Focusing on the main gist of these
exciting and vivid fields of modern research, we seek to provide a instructive

The interactions between charges and excitons involve complex many-body
interactions at high densities. The exciton-polaron model has been adopted to
understand the Fermi sea screening of charged excitons in monolayer transition
metal dichalcogenides. The results provide good agreement with absorption
measurements, which are dominated by dilute bright exciton responses. Here we
investigate the Fermi sea dressing of spin-forbidden dark excitons in monolayer
WSe2. With a Zeeman field, the valley-polarized dark excitons show distinct
p-doping dependence in photoluminescence when the carriers reach a critical
density. This density can be interpreted as the onset of strongly modified
Fermi sea interactions and shifts with increasing exciton density. Through
valley-selective excitation and dynamics measurements, we also infer an
intervalley coupling between the dark trions and exciton-polarons mediated by
the many-body interactions. Our results reveal the evolution of Fermi sea
screening with increasing exciton density and the impacts of polaron-polaron
interactions, which lay the foundation for understanding electronic
correlations and many-body interactions in 2D systems.

<br>
<br>
Recently, above-room temperature superconductivity was reported in the Cu
doped lead apatite Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO4)$_6$O, dubbed LK-99. By relaxing the
structure with Cu substitution, we derive a four-band low-energy model with two
3/4 filled bands of predominantly Cu $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ character and two
filled O $p_x$ and $p_y$ bands. This model is further downfolded to a two-band
Cu-$d_{xz/yz}$ model. Using {\it ab-initio} derived interaction parameters, we
perform dynamical mean field theory calculations to determine the correlated
electronic structure in the normal state. These calculations yield a Mott
insulator at $x=1$ and a strongly correlated non-Fermi liquid metal upon
doping. The very large interaction versus bandwidth ratio $U/W\approx 30$-$50$
and the local moment paramagnetic behavior in the relevant filling regime are
hard to reconcile with diamagnetism and high-temperature superconductivity.
Hence, our calculations suggest that this behavior should come from a component
with a different stoichiometry.

with respect to grain's diameter. Polycrystalline aggregates are considered
within single- and two-phase models that correspond to the presence of
crystalline and grain-boundary (porous) phases. The scalar dislocation density
is derived. Analytic and graphic forms of the generalized Hall-Petch relations
for yield strength are produced for single-mode samples with BCC ($\alpha$-Fe),
FCC (Cu, Al, Ni) and HCP ($\alpha$-Ti, Zr) crystal lattices at T=300 K with
different values of the grain-boundary phase. We derived new form of the
temperature-dimensional effect. The values of extremal grain and maximum of
yield strength are decreased with raising the temperature in accordance with
experiments up to NC region.

It has recently been shown that thermal active glasses can display physical
aging behavior comparable to that of passive glasses, although there are some
notable distinctions due to the intrinsic non-equilibrium nature of active
matter. The question whether active disordered materials can also exhibit
rejuvenation and memory effects, akin to the phenomenology of e.g.\ spin
glasses, has thus far remained unexplored. Here we address this question by
numerical simulations of active glasses composed of active Brownian particles
that are subjected to a thermal or active cycling protocol. We find that an
active system undergoing thermal cycling indeed shows rejuvenation and memory
effects, with the strength of rejuvenation depending on the persistence time.
In contrast, however, a passive Brownian system subjected to the same thermal
cycle lacks the rejuvenation effect. We attribute this to the enhanced motility
of active particles, which enables them to escape from their cages and restart
aging at the new temperature, thus rejuvenating the material. Finally, we also
demonstrate that both rejuvenation and memory effects can be induced by an
activity cycle which quenches the material from an active to passive glass and
back, providing a unique means to rejuvenate active matter.

<h3>Observation of abnormal resistance-temperature behavior along with  diamagnetic transition in Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O-based composite</h3>

Recently, Sukbae Lee et al.reported that material
Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O (LK-99) has a series of characteristics of room
temperature superconductors, including diamagnetic transition, resistance jump,
nearly zero-resistance, magnetic field-dependent IV characteristics and so on
(10.6111/JKCGCT.2023.33.2.061, arXiv:2307.12008, arXiv:2307.12037). However,
whether LK-99 is really a room temperature superconductor is still
controversial. On the one hand, some people think that the relatively weak
diamagnetism of LK-99 reported by Sukbae Lee et al. is not the Meissner effect.
On the other hand, there are doubts about the authenticity of its
zero-resistance test results. Global replication studies have shown that LK-99
does have a large diamagnetic (arXiv:2308.01516), and also found a
zero-resistance behavior at a low temperature of 110 $^\circ$K
(arXiv:2308.01192). However, up to now, there is still no direct reproducible
evidence to support Sukbae Lee et al.'s conclusion that LK-99 is a room
temperature superconductor. Here, a distinct resistance jump was observed at
about 387 $^\circ$K under ambient pressure in our experiment for unclear reason
including possible impurity's contribution. The overall resistance of the test
LK-99 sample still shows semiconductivity, and the resistance cannot really
drop to zero. Our findings indicate that to identify the true potential of
LK-99, high quality crystals without impurity are very important.

Training materials through periodic drive allows to endow materials and
structures with complex elastic functions. As a result of the driving, the
system explores the high dimensional space of structures, ultimately converging
to a structure with the desired response. However, increasing the complexity of
the desired response results in ultra-slow convergence and degradation. Here,
we show that by constraining the search space we are able to increase
robustness, extend the maximal capacity, train responses that previously did
not converge, and in some cases to accelerate convergence by many orders of
magnitude. We identify the geometrical constraints that prevent the formation
of spurious low-frequency modes, which are responsible for failure. We argue
that these constraints are analogous to regularization used in machine
learning. Our results present a unified understanding of the relations between
complexity, degradation, convergence, and robustness.

<h3>Motility induced phase separation of deformable cells</h3>

Using a multi-phase field model, we examine how particle deformability, which
is a proxy for cell stiffness, affects motility induced phase separation
(MIPS). We show that purely repulsive deformable, i.e., squishy, cells phase
separate more effectively than their rigid counterparts. This can be understood
as due to the fact that deformability increases the effective duration of
collisions. In addition, the dense regions become increasingly disordered as
deformability increases. Our results contextualize the applicability of MIPS to
biological systems and have implications for how cells in biological systems
may self-organize

<h3>Coherence measurements of polaritons in thermal equilibrium reveal a new  power law for two-dimensional condensates</h3>

We have created a spatially homogeneous polariton condensate in thermal
equilibrium, up to very high condensate fraction. Under these conditions, we
have measured the coherence as a function of momentum, and determined the total
coherent fraction of this boson system from very low density up to density well
above the condensation transition. These measurements reveal a consistent power
law for the coherent fraction over nearly three orders of magnitude of density
variation. The same power law is seen in numerical simulations solving the
two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the equilibrium coherence. This
power law has not been predicted by prior analytical theories.
