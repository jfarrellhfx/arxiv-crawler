<h3>Thermal transfer enhancement by hydrodynamic plasmons in electron  bilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10674" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10674</a>

We develop a theory of heat transfer induced by thermal charge fluctuations
in two-dimensional electron double layers. We consider pristine systems
comprised of identical layers, and focus on the regime of sufficiently high
temperatures and interlayer distances $d$, where the relevant charge
fluctuations may be described using the hydrodynamic approach. In this limit
heat transfer is dominated by the plasmon resonances. For systems with
Galilean-invariant electron dispersion the interlayer thermal conductance
$\varkappa$ is proportional to the kinematic viscosity of the electron liquid,
and decreases as $1/d^4$. In the absence of Galilean invariance $\varkappa
\propto \sigma/d^3$, where $\sigma$ is the intrinsic conductivity of the
liquid. This strong enhancement can be traced to a drastically different
broadening of plasmon resonances in systems with and without Galilean
invariance.

<h3>The chiral limits of moiré semiconductors: origin of flat bands and  topology in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides homobilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10477" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10477</a>

We explore all the chiral limits of perturbed Dirac field theories applicable
to $C_3$-symmetric moir\'e materials, and uncover the similar origin of flat
bands in both twisted bilayer graphene and twisted transition metal
dichalcogenides homobilayers. In the latter, the non-trivial topology of the
flat bands is due to layer-orbit coupling, the analog of spin-orbit coupling
for relativistic Dirac fermions, which we show is non-perturbative on the
moir\'e scale. Owing to significant corrugation effects, transition metal
dichalcogenides are arguably more natural realization of the chiral limit than
twisted bilayer graphene itself. We finally develop an approximate magic rule
that enables to quickly localize the flat band regime in these moir\'e
semiconductors.

<h3>Topological Superconductivity in Two-Dimensional Altermagnetic Metals</h3>

Bringing magnetic metals into superconducting states represents an important
approach for realizing unconventional superconductors and potentially even
topological superconductors. Altermagnetism, classified as a third basic
collinear magnetic phase, gives rise to intriguing momentum-dependent
spin-splitting of the band structure, and results in an even number of
spin-polarized Fermi surfaces due to the symmetry-enforced zero net
magnetization. In this work, we investigate the effect of this new magnetic
order on the superconductivity of a two-dimensional metal with $d$-wave
altermagnetism and Rashba spin-orbital coupling. Specifically we determine the
types of superconducting pairing that can occur in this system and ascertain
whether they possess topological properties. Through self-consistent mean-field
calculations, we find that the system in general favors a mixture of
spin-singlet $s$-wave and spin-triplet $p$-wave pairings, due to the absence of
time-reversal symmetry and inversion symmetry. Using symmetry arguments
supported by detailed calculations, we show that a number of topological
superconductors, including both first-order and second-order ones, can emerge
when the $p$-wave pairing dominates. In particular, we find that the
second-order topological superconductor is enforced by a
$\mathcal{C}_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, which renders the spin polarization of
Majorana corner modes into a unique entangled structure. Our study demonstrates
that altermagnetic metals are fascinating platforms for the exploration of
intrinsic unconventional superconductivity and topological superconductivity.

<h3>Introducing the monoclinic polymorph of the Kitaev magnet  Na$_{2}$Co$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10484" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10484</a>

<br>
<br>
Recent theoretical studies have suggested that the low-energy Hamiltonian of
honeycomb cobaltate systems could be dominated by anisotropic Kitaev
interactions. Motivated by the theory, a honeycomb layered material
Na$_{2}$Co$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$ with a hexagonal unit cell has been studied and found
to exhibit antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering at 27 K with two spin reorientation
transitions at 15 and 5 K. Here we report a monoclinic polymorph of
Na$_{2}$Co$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$, also with honeycomb layered structure but with a
single AFM transition at 9.6 K and without spin reorientation transitions at
lower temperatures. Using neutron diffraction, we identify an in-plane zigzag
AFM order in the ground-state with the spins canted out of the honeycomb planes
and ferromagnetically coupled between them. The zigzag order is suppressed by a
magnetic field of 6 T.

<h3>Exact large-scale fluctuations of the phase field in the sine-Gordon  model</h3>

<i>Giuseppe Del Vecchio Del Vecchio, Márton Kormos, Benjamin Doyon, Alvise Bastianello</i>
<br>
<br>
We present an exact theory and analytical formulas for the large-scale phase
fluctuations in the sine-Gordon model, valid in all regimes of the field
theory, for arbitrary temperatures and interaction strengths. Our result is
based on the Ballistic Fluctuation Theory combined with Generalized
Hydrodynamics, and can be seen as an exact ``dressing" of the phenomenological
soliton-gas picture first introduced by Sachdev and Young [S. Sachdev and A. P.
Young, PRL 78, 2220 (1997)], to the modes of Generalised Hydrodynamics. We
provide extensive numerical checks of our analytical predictions within the
classical regime of the field theory by using Monte Carlo methods. We discuss
how our results are of ready applicability to experiments on tunnel-coupled
quasicondensates.

<h3>Supercurrent mediated by helical edge modes in bilayer graphene</h3>

<br>
Bilayer graphene encapsulated in tungsten diselenide can host a weak
topological phase with pairs of helical edge states. The electrical tunability
of this phase makes it an ideal platform to investigate unique topological
effects at zero magnetic field, such as topological superconductivity. Here we
couple the helical edges of such a heterostructure to a superconductor. The
inversion of the bulk gap accompanied by helical states near zero displacement
field leads to the suppression of the critical current in a Josephson geometry.
Using superconducting quantum interferometry we observe an even-odd effect in
the Fraunhofer interference pattern within the inverted gap phase. We show
theoretically that this effect is a direct consequence of the emergence of
helical modes that connect the two edges of the sample. The absence of such an
effect at high displacement field, as well as in bare bilayer graphene
junctions, confirms this interpretation and demonstrates the topological nature
of the inverted gap. Our results demonstrate the coupling of superconductivity
to zero-field topological states in graphene.

<h3>A new method for reactive constant pH simulations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10521" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10521</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We present a simulation method that allows us to calculate the titration
curves for systems undergoing protonation/deprotonation reactions -- such as
charged colloidal suspensions with acidic/basic surface groups,
polyelectrolytes, polyampholytes, proteins, etc. The new approach allows us to
simultaneously obtain titration curves both for systems in contact with salt
and acid reservoir (semi-grand canonical ensemble) and for isolated suspensions
(canonical ensemble). To treat the electrostatic interactions, we present a new
method based on Ewald summation -- which accounts for the existence of both
Bethe and Donnan potentials within the simulation cell. We show that that the
Donnan potential affects dramatically the pH of suspension. Counter
intuitively, we find that for concentrated suspensions of low ionic strength,
the number of deprotonated groups can be 100\% larger in an isolated system,
compared to a system connected to a reservoir by a semi-permeable membrane --
with both systems being at exactly the same pH.

<br>
<br>
Using low-temperature cathodoluminescence spectroscopy, we study the
properties of N- and Al-polar AlN layers grown by molecular beam epitaxy on
bulk AlN{0001}. Compared to the bulk AlN substrate, layers of both polarities
feature a suppression of deep-level luminescence, a total absence of the
prevalent donor with an exciton binding energy of 28 meV, and a much increased
intensity of the emission from free excitons. The dominant donor in these
layers is characterized by an associated exciton binding energy of 13 meV. The
observation of excited exciton states up to the exciton continuum allows us to
directly extract the $\Gamma_{5}$ free exciton binding energy of 57 meV.

<h3>Recycling Silicon Scrap for Spherical Si-C composite as High-Performance  Lithium-ion Battery Anodes</h3>

<br>
The growth of the semiconductor and solar industry has been exponential in
the last two decades due to the computing and energy demands of the world.
Silicon (Si) is one of the main constituents for both sectors and, thus, is
used in large quantities. As a result, a lot of Si waste is generated mainly by
these two industries. For a sustainable world, the circular economy is the key;
thus, the waste produced must be upcycled/recycled/reused to complete the
circular chain. Herein, we show that an upcycled/recycled Si can be used with
carbon as a composite anode material, with high Si content (~40 wt.%) and
loading of 3-4 mAh/cm^2 for practical use in lithium-ion batteries. The unique
spherical jackfruit-like structure of the Si-C composite can minimize the total
lithium inventory loss compared to the conventional Si-C composite and pure Si,
resulting in superior electrochemical performance. The superior electrochemical
performance of Si-C composites enables the cell energy density of ~325 Wh/kg
(with NMC cathode) and ~260 Wh/kg (with LFP cathode), respectively. The results
demonstrate that Si-based industrial waste can be upcycled for high-performance
Li-ion battery anodes through a controllable, scalable, and energy-efficient
route.

<h3>On the Topological Protection of the Quantum Hall Effect in a Cavity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10558" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10558</a>

<br>
<br>
We study the quantum Hall effect in a two-dimensional homogeneous electron
gas coupled to a quantum cavity field. As initially pointed out by Kohn,
Galilean invariance for a homogeneous quantum Hall system implies that the
electronic center of mass (CM) decouples from the electron-electron
interaction, and the energy of the CM mode, also known as Kohn mode, is equal
to the single particle cyclotron transition. In this work, we point out that
strong light-matter hybridization between the Kohn mode and the cavity photons
gives rise to collective hybrid modes between the Landau levels and the
photons. We provide the exact solution for the collective Landau polaritons and
we demonstrate the weakening of topological protection at zero temperature due
to the existence of the lower polariton mode which is softer than the Kohn
mode. This provides an intrinsic mechanism for the recently observed
topological breakdown of the quantum Hall effect in a cavity [Appugliese et
al., Science 375, 1030-1034 (2022)]. Importantly, our theory predicts the
cavity suppression of the thermal activation gap in the quantum Hall transport.
Our work paves the way for future developments in the cavity control of quantum
materials.

<h3>Breaking the chains: extreme value statistics and localization in random  spin chains</h3>

Despite a very good understanding of single-particle Anderson localization in
one-dimensional (1D) disordered systems, many-body effects are still full of
surprises, a famous example being the interaction-driven many-body localization
(MBL) problem, about which much has been written, and perhaps the best is yet
to come. Interestingly enough the non-interacting limit provides a natural
playground to study non-trivial multiparticle physics, offering the possibility
to test some general mechanisms with very large-scale exact diagonalization
simulations. In this work, we first revisit the 1D many-body Anderson insulator
through the lens of extreme value theory, focusing on the extreme polarizations
of the equivalent spin chain model in a random magnetic field. A
many-body-induced chain breaking mechanism is explored numerically, and
compared to an analytically solvable toy model. A unified description, from
weak to large disorder strengths $W$ emerges, where the disorder-dependent
average localization length $\xi(W)$ governs the extreme events leading to
chain breaks. In particular, tails of the local magnetization distributions are
controlled by $\xi(W)$. Remarkably, we also obtain a quantitative understanding
of the full distribution of the extreme polarizations, which is given by a
Fr\'echet-type law. In a second part, we explore finite interaction physics and
the MBL question. For the available system sizes, we numerically quantify the
difference in the extreme value distributions between the interacting problem
and the non-interacting Anderson case. Strikingly, we observe a sharp
"extreme-statistics transition" as $W$ changes, which may coincide with the MBL
transition.

<h3>Crystal structure informed mesoscale deformation model for HCP Cu6Sn5  intermetallic compound</h3>

In the electronic packaging and energy storage sectors, the study of Cu6Sn5
intermetallic compound (IMC) is getting more attention. At temperatures above
186 oC, this IMC exists in a hexagonal closed packed (HCP) crystalline
structure. Crystal plasticity finite element simulations are performed on
Cu6Sn5 IMC by taking the information about its lattice parameters and direction
dependent elastic properties. Three types of models corresponding to
deformations in basal, prismatic and pyramidal modes are developed. With the
same type of loading in the elastic regime and boundary conditions, the results
of the computations reveal the differences in displacement magnitudes among the
three model types.

<h3>Observation of Large-Number Corner Modes in $\mathbb{Z}$-class  Higher-Order Topolectrical Circuits</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10585" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10585</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Topological corner states are exotic topological boundary states that are
bounded to zero-dimensional geometry even the dimension of systems is large
than one. As an elegant physical correspondence, their numbers are dictated by
the bulk topological invariants. So far, all previous realizations of HOTIs are
hallmarked by $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants and therefore have only one
corner state at each corner. Here we report an experimental demonstration of
$\mathbb{Z}$-class HOTI phases in electric circuits, hosting $N$ corner modes
at each single corner structure. By measuring the impedance spectra and
distributions, we clearly demonstrate the $\mathbb{Z}$-class HOTI phases,
including the zero-energy corner modes and their density distributions.
Moreover, we reveal that the local density of states (LDOS) at each corner for
$N=4$ are equally distributed at four corner unit cells, prominently differing
from $\mathbb{Z}_2$-class case where the LDOS only dominates over one corner
unit cell. Our results extend the observation of HOTIs from $\mathbb{Z}_2$
class to $\mathbb{Z}$ class and the coexistence of spatially overlapped large
number of corner modes which may enable exotic topological devices that require
high degeneracy boundary states.

<h3>Tailoring the electron and hole Landé factors in lead halide  perovskite nanocrystals by quantum confinement and halide exchange</h3>

<br>
<br>
The tunability of the optical properties of lead halide perovskite
nanocrystals makes them highly appealing for applications. Both, halide anion
exchange and quantum confinement pave the way for tailoring their band gap
energy. For spintronics applications, the Land{\'e} g-factors of electrons and
hole are of great importance. By means of the empirical tight-binding and
k$\cdot$p methods, we calculate them for nanocrystals of the class of
all-inorganic lead halide perovskites CsPbX$_3$ (X = I, Br, Cl). The hole
g-factor as function of the band gap follows the universal dependence found for
bulk perovskites, while for the electrons a considerable modification is
predicted. Based on the k$\cdot$p analysis we conclude that this difference
arises from the interaction of the bottom conduction band with the spin-orbit
split electron states. The model predictions are confirmed by experimental data
for the electron and hole g-factors in CsPbI3 nanocrystals placed in a glass
matrix, measured by time-resolved Faraday ellipticity in a magnetic field at
cryogenic temperatures.

<h3>Measuring Non-local Brane Order with Error-corrected Parity Snapshots</h3>

<br>
Exotic quantum many-body states, such as Haldane and spin liquid phases, can
exhibit remarkable features like fractional excitations and non-abelian
statistics and offer new understandings of quantum entanglement in many-body
quantum systems. These phases are classified by non-local correlators that can
be directly measured in atomic analog quantum simulating platforms, such as
optical lattices and Rydberg atom arrays. However, characterizing these phases
in large systems is experimentally challenging because they are sensitive to
local errors like atom loss, which suppress its signals exponentially.
Additionally, protocols for systematically identifying and mitigating
uncorrelated errors in analog quantum simulators are lacking. Here, we address
these challenges by developing an error correction method for large-scale
neutral atom quantum simulators using optical lattices. Our error correction
method can distinguish correlated particle-hole pairs from uncorrelated holes
in the Mott insulator. After removing the uncorrelated errors, we observe a
dramatic improvement in the non-local parity correlator and find the perimeter
scaling law. Furthermore, the error model provides a statistical estimation of
fluctuations in site occupation, from which we measure the generalized brane
correlator and confirm that it can be an order parameter for Mott insulators in
two dimensions. Our work provides a promising avenue for investigating and
characterizing exotic phases of matters in large-scale quantum simulators.

<h3>How to train your demon to do fast information erasure without heat  production</h3>

<i>Stephen Whitelam</i>
<br>
<br>
Time-dependent protocols that perform irreversible logical operations, such
as memory erasure, cost work and produce heat, placing bounds on the efficiency
of computers. Here we use a prototypical computer model of a physical memory to
show that it is possible to learn feedback-control protocols to do fast memory
erasure without input of work or production of heat. These protocols, which are
enacted by a neural-network "demon", do not violate the second law of
thermodynamics because the demon generates more heat than the memory absorbs.
The result is a form of nonlocal heat exchange in which one computation is
rendered energetically favorable while a compensating one produces heat
elsewhere, a tactic that could be used to rationally design the flow of energy
within a computer.

<h3>Majorana-fermion origin of the planar thermal Hall effect in the Kitaev  magnet $α$-RuCl$_3$</h3>

<br>
<br>
The field-induced quantum disordered state of layered honeycomb magnet
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is a prime candidate for Kitaev spin liquids hosting Majorana
fermions and non-Abelian anyons. Recent observations of anomalous planar
thermal Hall effect demonstrate a topological edge mode, but whether it
originates from Majorana fermions or bosonic magnons remains controversial.
Here we distinguish these origins from low-temperature measurements of
high-resolution specific heat and thermal Hall conductivity with rotating
in-plane fields. In the honeycomb bond direction, a distinct closure of the
low-energy bulk gap is observed concomitantly with the sign reversal of the
Hall effect. General discussions of topological bands show that this is the
hallmark of an angle-rotation-induced topological transition of fermions,
providing conclusive evidence for the Majorana-fermion origin of the thermal
Hall effect in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.

<br>
<br>
Empirical studies on the landscape of neural networks have shown that
low-energy configurations are often found in complex connected structures,
where zero-energy paths between pairs of distant solutions can be constructed.
Here we consider the spherical negative perceptron, a prototypical non-convex
neural network model framed as a continuous constraint satisfaction problem. We
introduce a general analytical method for computing energy barriers in the
simplex with vertex configurations sampled from the equilibrium. We find that
in the over-parameterized regime the solution manifold displays simple
connectivity properties. There exists a large geodesically convex component
that is attractive for a wide range of optimization dynamics. Inside this
region we identify a subset of atypically robust solutions that are
geodesically connected with most other solutions, giving rise to a star-shaped
geometry. We analytically characterize the organization of the connected space
of solutions and show numerical evidence of a transition, at larger constraint
densities, where the aforementioned simple geodesic connectivity breaks down.

<h3>Nonsingular increase in magnetic susceptibility and transition in  universality in site-diluted Ising model in two dimensions</h3>

<i>Eduardo C. Cuansing</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the effects of dilution to the critical properties of site-diluted
Ising model in two dimensions using Monte Carlo simulations. Quenched disorder
from the dilution is incorporated into the Ising model via random empty sites
on the square lattice of Ising spins. Thermodynamic quantities such as the
magnetization $M$ per spin, energy $E$ per spin, magnetic susceptibility $\chi$
per spin, and specific heat $C$ per spin are then calculated after the system
has equilibrated. At small dilution concentrations $d<0.1$, we find that the
value of the critical exponent $\beta$ does not deviate from its pure Ising
value. At higher dilution concentrations $d>0.1$, however, we find $\beta$ to
strongly depend on the value of $d$. We are able to locate a critical
temperature $T_c$ and a critical dilution concentration $d_c$ where the phase
transition occurs. We find $T_c$ to depend linearly on $d$. In the phase
diagrams of $M$, $E$, $\chi$, and $C$, we find that the phase transition line
eventually disappears at high dilutions. Our results suggest that there is a
transition from Strong Universality at low dilution to Weak Universality at
high dilution. Lastly, we find a wide and nonsingular increase in the magnetic
susceptibility $\chi$ at the low temperature and high dilution region.

<h3>A Framework Based on Symbolic Regression Coupled with eXtended  Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Gray-Box Learning of Equations of Motion  from Data</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10706" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10706</a>
<br>
<i>Elham Kiyani, Khemraj Shukla, George Em Karniadakis, Mikko Karttunen</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a framework and an algorithm to uncover the unknown parts of
nonlinear equations directly from data. The framework is based on eXtended
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (X-PINNs), domain decomposition in space-time,
but we augment the original X-PINN method by imposing flux continuity across
the domain interfaces. The well-known Allen-Cahn equation is used to
demonstrate the approach. The Frobenius matrix norm is used to evaluate the
accuracy of the X-PINN predictions and the results show excellent performance.
In addition, symbolic regression is employed to determine the closed form of
the unknown part of the equation from the data, and the results confirm the
accuracy of the X-PINNs based approach. To test the framework in a situation
resembling real-world data, random noise is added to the datasets to mimic
scenarios such as the presence of thermal noise or instrument errors. The
results show that the framework is stable against significant amount of noise.
As the final part, we determine the minimal amount of data required for
training the neural network. The framework is able to predict the correct form
and coefficients of the underlying dynamical equation when at least 50\% data
is used for training.

Traditionally, X-ray scattering techniques have been used to detect the
breaking of the structural symmetry of the lattice, which accompanies a
periodic displacement of the atoms associated with charge density wave (CDW)
formation in the cuprate pseudogap states. Similarly, the Spectroscopic Imaging
Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (SI-STM) has visualized the short-range CDW.
However, local coupling of electrons to the lattice in the form of a
short-range CDW has been a challenge to visualize, thus a link between these
measurements has been missing. Here, we introduce a novel STM-based technique
to visualize the local bond length variations obtained from topographic imaging
with picometer precision. Application of this technique to the high-Tc cuprate
superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} revealed a high-fidelity local lattice
distortion of the BiO lattice as large as 2%. In addition, analysis of local
breaking of rotational symmetry associated with the bond lengths reveals
modulations around four-unit-cell periodicity in both B1 and E representations
in the C4v group of the lattice, which coincides with the uni-directional
d-symmetry CDW (dCDW) previously identified within the CuO2 planes, thus
providing direct evidence of electron-lattice coupling in the pseudogap state
and a link between the X-ray scattering and STM measurements. Overall, our
results suggest that the periodic lattice displacements in E representations
correspond to a locally-frozen version of the soft phonons identified by the
X-ray scattering measurements, and a fluctuation of the bond length is
reflected by the fluctuation of the dCDW formation near the quantum critical
point.

Topological semimetal materials have become a research hotspot due to their
intrinsic strong spin-orbit coupling which leads to large charge-to-spin
conversion efficiency and novel transport behaviors. In this work, we have
observed a bilinear magnetoelectric resistance (BMER) of up to 0.1 nm2A-1Oe-1
in a singlelayer of sputtered semimetal Pt3Sn at room temperature. Different
from previous observations, the value of BMER in sputtered Pt3Sn does not
change out-of-plane due to the polycrystalline nature of Pt3Sn. The observation
of BMER provides strong evidence of the existence of spin-momentum locking in
the sputtered polycrystalline Pt3Sn. By adding an adjacent CoFeB magnetic
layer, the BMER value of this bilayer system is doubled compared to the single
Pt3Sn layer. This work broadens the material system in BMER study, which paves
the way for the characterization of topological states and applications for
spin memory and logic devices.

<h3>Relaxation behaviours in ferromagnetic monolayers</h3>

In this article, we briefly review the studies on magnetic relaxation
behaviours. The theoretical as well as experimental investigations are reported
briefly. A major part of this article is devoted to the recent Monte Carlo
investigations into the roles of boundary conditions, dynamics and the
Geometrical structures on the relaxation of magnetic monolayers modelled by
two-dimensional Ising ferromagnet. We have studied all these effects for a two
dimensional Ising system with two types of deformations, namely preserving and
area non-preserving.The Glauber protocol and Metropolis dynamical rules are
employed in our simulations and we investigated the systems with both periodic
and open boundary conditions.
The major findings are the exponential relaxation and the dependence of
relaxation time ($\tau$) on the aspect ratio $R$ (length over breadth). A power
law dependence ($\tau \sim R^{-s}$) has been observed for larger values of
aspect ratio ($R$). The linear thermal ($T$) dependence of exponent ($s$) has
been noticed ($s = aT + b$). The transient behaviours of the spin-flip density
have also been studied here for both surface and bulk/core. Both the saturated
bulk/core and saturated surface spin-flip density are observed to follow the
logarithmic dependence $f_{d} = a + b~\log(L)$ with the system size ($L$).
For open boundary condition with any kind (Metropolis/Glauber) of dynamical
rule, the faster relaxation has been observed. Similarly, Metropolis algorithm
yields faster relaxation for any kind (open/periodic) of boundary condition. We
appeal to the experimentalists for experimental support which may be applied in
judicious {\it magnetic coating} of the credit cards for quicker response.

An overestimation of the fundamental band gap values by the density
functional theory within the local density approximation and associated
approaches is a well-known challenge of ab-initio electronic structure
computations. Motivated by recent optical experiments [D. Santos-Cottin et al.,
arXiv:2301.08014], we have revisited first-principle results obtained earlier
for EuCd2As2 and extended the computational studies to the whole class of
systems EuCd2X2 (X = P, As, Sb, Bi), to EuIn2X2 (X = P, As, Sb), and to
nonmagnetic AEIn2As2 (AE= Ca, Sr, Ba) employing a hybrid functional method. We
find that our approach provides the magnitude of the energy gap for EuCd2As2 in
agreement with the experimental value. Actually, our results indicate that
EuSn2As2, BaIn2As2, EuCd2Bi2 and EuCd2SbBi are robust topological insulators,
while all other compounds are topologically trivial semiconductors. The
topologically trivial Eu-based systems are antiferromagnetic semiconductors
with a strong red shift of the energy gap in a magnetic field caused by the
exchange coupling of the band states to spins localized on the 4f-shell of Eu
ions. Additionally, the EuIn2X2 (X = P, As) compounds show altermagnetic
exchange-induced band spin-splitting, particularly noticeable in the case of
states derived from 5d-Eu orbitals.

<h3>Bidisperse ring polymers: topological glass to stacking</h3>

Via large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we observe the melting of a
topological glass of stiff ring polymers by incorporating flexible ring
polymers, along an isobaric path. As more flexible ring polymers are
introduced, cluster glass-like structures emerge in the stiffer ring polymers
with reduced orthogonal threading. This eventually evolves to a stacked
columnar structure at an increased fraction of flexible ring polymers.
Depletion interactions between the stiff and flexible rings drive the stacking,
contingent on the disparity in flexibility in the ring polymer mixture.

<br>
We describe the parameterization of a tungsten-hydrogen empirical potential
designed for use with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of highly
irradiated tungsten containing hydrogen isotope atoms, and report test results.
Particular attention has been paid to getting good elastic properties,
including the relaxation volumes of small defect clusters, and to the
interaction energy between hydrogen isotopes and typical irradiation-induced
defects in tungsten. We conclude that the energy ordering of defects changes
with the ratio of H atoms to point defects, indicating that this potential is
suitable for exploring mechanisms of trap mutation, including vacancy loop to
plate-like void transformations.

<br>
<br>
Optical orientation of carrier spins by circularly polarized light is the
basis of spin physics in semiconductors. Here, we demonstrate strong optical
orientation of 85\%, approaching the ultimate limit of unity, for excitons in
FA$_{0.9}$Cs$_{0.1}$PbI$_{2.8}$Br$_{0.2}$ lead halide perovskite bulk crystals.
Time-resolved photoluminescence allows us to distinguish excitons with 60~ps
lifetime from electron-hole recombination in the spin dynamics detected via
coherent spin quantum beats in magnetic field. We reveal electron-hole spin
correlations through linear polarization beats after circularly polarized
excitation. Detuning of the excitation energy from the exciton resonance up to
0.5~eV does not reduce the optical orientation, evidencing clean chiral
selection rules in agreement with atomistic calculations, and suppressed spin
relaxation of electrons and holes even with large kinetic energies.

<h3>Spontaneous Electric Polarization in Graphene Polytypes</h3>

A crystalline solid is a periodic sequence of identical cells, each
containing one or more atoms. If the constituting unit cell is not
centrosymmetric, charge may distribute unevenly between the atoms, resulting in
internal electric polarization. This effect serves as the basis for numerous
ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric phenomena. In nearly all polar
materials, including multilayered van der Waals stacks that were recently found
to exhibit interfacial polarization, inversion symmetry is broken by having two
or more atomic species within the unit cell. Here, we show that even elemental
crystals, consisting of one type of atom, and composed of non-polar
centrosymmetric layers, exhibit electric polarization if arranged in an
appropriate three-dimensional architecture. This concept is demonstrated here
for inversion and mirror asymmetric mixed-stacking tetra-layer polytypes of
non-polar graphene sheets. Furthermore, we find that the room temperature
out-of-plane electric polarization increases with external electrostatic
doping, rather than decreases owing to screening. Using first-principles
calculations, as well as tight-binding modeling, we unveil the origin of
polytype-induced polarization and its dependence on doping. Extension of this
idea to graphene multilayers suggests that solely by lateral shifts of
constituent monolayers one can obtain multiple meta-stable interlayer stacking
sequences that may allow for even larger electrical polarization.

<h3>Mixed-Stacking Few-Layer Graphene as an Elemental Weak Ferroelectric  Material</h3>

<br>
<br>
Ferroelectricity (Valasek, J. Phys. Rev. 1921, 17, 475) - a spontaneous
formation of electric polarisation - is a solid state phenomenon, usually,
associated with ionic compounds or complex materials. Here we show that,
atypically for elemental solids, few-layer graphenes can host an equilibrium
out-of-plane electric polarisation, switchable by sliding the constituent
graphene sheets. The systems hosting such effect include mixed-stacking
tetralayers and thicker (5-9 layers) rhombohedral graphitic films with a twin
boundary in the middle of a flake. The predicted electric polarisation would
also appear in marginally (small-angle) twisted few-layer flakes, where lattice
reconstruction would give rise to networks of mesoscale domains with
alternating value and sign of out-of-plane polarisation.

<br>
<br>
We study spin-orbit proximity effects in a hybrid heterostructure build of a
one-dimensional (1D) armchair carbon nanotube and two-dimensional (2D) buckled
monolayer bismuthene. We show, by performing first-principles calculations,
that Dirac electrons in the nanotube exhibit large spin-orbit coupling due to a
close vicinity of bismuthene. The calculated low-energy band structures of the
proximized nanotube display a strong dependence on the position of the nanotube
on the substrate, similar to twist-angle dependence found in 2D
heterostructures. Based on the first-principles results, we formulate an
effective low-energy Hamiltonian of the nanotube and identify key interactions
governing the proximity spin-orbit coupling. The proximity-induced spin
splitting of Dirac cone bands is in meV range, confirming an efficient transfer
of spin-orbit coupling from bismuthene to the nanotube.

<br>
The lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) of two ceramic materials, cerium
dioxide (CeO$_2$) and magnesium oxide (MgO), is computed up to 1500 K using
first principles and the phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation (PBTE) and
compared to time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) measurements up to 800 K.
Phonon renormalization and the four-phonon effect, along with high temperature
thermal expansion, are integrated in our \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics
(AIMD) calculations. This is done by first relaxing structures and then fitting
to a set of effective force constants employed in a temperature-dependent
effective potential (TDEP) method. Both three-phonon and four-phonon scattering
rates are computed based on these effective force constants. Our calculated
thermal conductivities from the PBTE solver agree well with literature and our
TDTR measurements. Other predicted thermal properties including thermal
expansion, frequency shift, and phonon linewidth also compare well with
available experimental data. Our results show that high temperature softens
phonon frequency and reduces four-phonon scattering strength in both ceramics.
Compared to MgO, we find that CeO$_2$ has weaker four-phonon effect and
renormalization greatly reduces its four-phonon scattering rates.

Recently, the higher-order topological phases from the chiral AIII symmetry
classes are characterized by a Z topological invariant known as the multipole
chiral numbers, which indicate the number of degenerate zero-energy corner
states at each corner. Here, we report the first experimental realization of
higher-order topological insulators protected by multipole chiral numbers with
using acoustic crystals. Our acoustic measurements demonstrate unambiguously
the emergence of multiple corner states in the middle of the gap, as predicted
by the quantized multipole chiral numbers. Our study may provoke new
possibilities for controlling sound, such as acoustic sensing and energy
trapping.

Tantalum and aluminum on sapphire are widely used platforms for qubits of
long coherent time. As quantum chips scale up, the number of Josephson
junctions on Sapphire increases. Thus, both the uniformity and stability of the
junctions are crucial to quantum devices, such as scalable superconducting
quantum computer circuit, and quantum-limited amplifiers. By optimizing the
fabrication process, especially, the conductive layer during the electron beam
lithography process, Al/AlOx/Al junctions of sizes ranging from 0.0169 to 0.04
{\mu}m2 on sapphire substrates were prepared. The relative standard deviation
of room temperature resistances (RN) of these junctions is better than 1.7% on
15 mmx15 mm chips, and better than 2.66% on 2 inch wafers, which is the highest
uniformity on sapphire substrates has been reported. The junctions are robust
and stable in resistances as temperature changes. The resistances increase by
the ratio of 9.73% relative to RN as the temperature ramp down to 4K, and
restore their initial values in the reverse process as the temperature ramps
back to RT. After being stored in a nitrogen cabinet for 100 days, the
resistance of the junctions changed by1.16% in average. The demonstration of
uniform and stable Josephson junctions in large area paves the way for the
fabrication of superconducting chip of hundreds of qubits on sapphire
substrates.

Intrigued by the discovery of the long lifetime in the
{\alpha}-Ta/Al2O3-based Transmon qubit, researchers recently found {\alpha}-Ta
film is a promising platform for fabricating multi-qubits with long coherence
time. To meet the requirements for integrating superconducting quantum
circuits, the ideal method is to grow {\alpha}-Ta film on silicon substrate
compatible with industrial manufacturing. Here we report the {\alpha}-Ta film
sputter-grown on Si (100) with low-loss superconducting TiNx buffer layer. The
pure-phase {\alpha}-Ta film with a large growth temperature window has good
crystalline character. The critical temperature (Tc) and residual resistance
ration (RRR) in the {\alpha}-Ta film grown at 500 oC are higher than that in
the {\alpha}-Ta film grown at room temperature. These results provide crucial
experimental clues towards understanding the connection between the
superconductivity and the materials' properties in the {\alpha}-Ta film, and
open a new route for producing high-quality {\alpha}-Ta film on silicon
substrate for future industrial superconducting quantum computer.

We analyze the changes in the vicinal acidity (pH) at a spherical amphiphilic
membrane. The membrane is assumed to contain solvent accessible, embedded,
dissociable, charge regulated moieties. Basing our approach on the linear
Debye-H\"uckel as well as the non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann theory, together
with the general Frumkin-Fowler-Guggenheim adsorption isotherm model of the
charge regulation process, we analyse and review the dependence of the local pH
on the position, as well as bulk electrolyte concentration, bulk pH and
curvature of the amphiphilic single membrane vesicle. With appropriately chosen
adsorption parameters of the charge regulation model, we find a good agreement
with available experimental data.

<br>
Stochastic processes are encountered in many contexts, ranging from
generation sizes of bacterial colonies and service times in a queueing system
to displacements of Brownian particles and frequency fluctuations in an
electrical power grid. If such processes are Markov, then their probability
distribution is governed by the Kramers-Moyal (KM) equation, a partial
differential equation that involves an infinite number of coefficients, which
depend on the state variable. The KM coefficients must be evaluated based on
measured time series for a data-driven reconstruction of the governing
equations for the stochastic dynamics. We present an accurate method of
computing the KM coefficients, which relies on computing the coefficients'
conditional moments based on the statistical moments of the time series. The
method's advantages over state-of-the-art approaches are demonstrated by
investigating prototypical stochastic processes with well-known properties.

The entropy of random graph ensembles has gained widespread attention in the

ensembles. Our estimate reproduces the Bender-Canfield formula in the limit of
large graphs.

Thin films of molybendum disulfide grown via thermal atomic layer deposition
at low temperatures, suitable for temperature sensible substrates, can be
amorphous. To avoid a high temperature post treatment of the whole sample,
which can cause thermal degradation of the substrate or other layers, a
ultrashort pulse (usp) laser-induced transformation to crystalline layers is
one of the most promising routes. In this paper we report the crystallization
of amorphous MoS$_2$ layers processed with ultrashort laser pulses. The
amorphous MoS$_2$ films were deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and
exposed to picosecond laser pulses ($\lambda = 532$ nm). The crystallization
and the influence of the processing parameters on the film morphology were
analyzed in detail by Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy.
Furthermore, a transition of amorphous MoS$_2$ by laser annealing to
self-organized patterns is demonstrated and a possible process mechanism for
the ultrashort pulse laser annealing is discussed. Finally, the usp laser
annealed films were compared to thermally and continuous wave (cw) laser
annealed samples.

<h3>Multi-Relevance: Coexisting but Distinct Notions of Scale in Large  Systems</h3>

<br>
<br>
Renormalization group (RG) methods have begun to see usage in biology and
computer science to support the search for simplifying structure in complex
models in high dimensional spaces. In this report, we show that mixture models
can be thought of as having multiple coexisting, exactly independent RG flows,
each with its own notion of scale, and define this property as multi-relevance.
To understand how this property affects RG analysis, we construct a model that
has two distinct notions of scale, each corresponding to the state of an
unobserved latent variable. In the regime where this latent variable can be
inferred using a linear classifier, the vertex expansion approach in
non-perturbative RG can be applied successfully but will give different answers
depending the choice of expansion point in state space. Next, in the regime
where linear estimation of the latent state fails, we show that an application
of the vertex expansion predicts a decrease in the total number of relevant
couplings from four to three. One consequence of this is that PCA-like
coarse-graining can eliminate important, resolvable parameters, and further, it
may only identify meaningless collective degrees of freedom. Taken together,
these results suggest that using RG in these new domains may lead to
oversimplification if multi-relevance is not accounted for.

Differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) can be used to extract mean particle
size from videos of suspensions. However, many suspensions have multimodal
particle size distributions (PSDs), for which this is not a sufficient
description. After clarifying how different particle sizes contribute to the
signal in DDM, we show that standard DDM analysis can extract the mean sizes of
two populations in a bimodal suspension given prior knowledge of the sample's
bimodality. Further, the use of the CONTIN algorithm obviates the need for such
prior knowledge. Finally, we show that by selectively analysing portions of the
DDM images, we can size a trimodal suspension where the large particles would
otherwise dominate the signal, again without prior knowledge of the
trimodality.

Using Legendre transformation, a standard theoretical approach extensively
used in classical mechanics as well as thermal dynamics, two-dimensional
non-linear auto-oscillators including spin torque nano-oscillators (STNOs) can
be equivalently expressed either in phase space or in configuration space where
all of them can be modeled by terminal velocity motion (TVM) particles. The
transformation completely preserves the dynamic information about the canonical
momenta, leading to very precise analytical predictions about the phase-locking
of a coupled pair of perpendicular to plane STNOs (PERP-STNOs) including
dynamical phase diagrams, (un)phase-locked frequencies, phase-locked angles,
and transient evolutions, which are all solved based on Newton mechanics.
Notably, the TVM model successfully solves the difficulty of the generalized
pendulum-like model [Chen \textit{et al}. \textbf{J. Appl. Phys. 130}, 043904
(2021)] failing to make precise predictions for the higher range of current in
serial connection. Additionally, how to simply search for the critical currents
for phase-locked (PL) and asynchronized (AS) states by numerically simulating
the macrospin as well as TVM model, which gets inspired through analyzing the
excitations of a forced pendulum, is also supplied here. Therefore, we believe
that the TVM model can bring a more intuitive and precise way to explore all
types of two-dimensional non-linear auto-oscillators.

Coupled colloidal quantum dot molecules are an emerging class of
nanomaterials, introducing new degrees of freedom for designing quantum
dot-based technologies. The properties of multiply excited states in these
materials are crucial to their performance as quantum light emitters but cannot
be fully resolved by existing spectroscopic techniques. Here we study the
characteristics of biexcitonic species, which represent a rich landscape of
different configurations, such as segregated and localized biexciton states. To
this end, we introduce an extension of Heralded Spectroscopy to resolve
different biexciton species in the prototypical CdSe/CdS coupled quantum dot
dimer system. We uncover the coexistence and interplay of two distinct
biexciton species: A fast-decaying, strongly-interacting biexciton species,
analogous to biexcitons in single quantum dots, and a long-lived,
weakly-interacting species corresponding to two nearly-independent excitons
separated to the two sides of the coupled quantum dot pair. The two biexciton
types are consistent with numerical simulations, assigning the
strongly-interacting species to two excitons localized at one side of the
quantum dot molecule and the weakly-interacting species to excitons segregated
to the two quantum dot molecule sides. This deeper understanding of multiply
excited states in coupled quantum dot molecules can support the rational design
of tunable single- or multiple-photon quantum emitters.

We study fluid-induced deformation and fracture of cohesive granular media,
and apply photoporomechanics to uncover the underpinning grain-scale mechanics.
We fabricate photoelastic spherical particles of diameter d=2mm, and make a
monolayer granular pack with tunable intergranular cohesion in a circular
Hele-Shaw cell that is initially filled with viscous silicone oil. We inject
water into the oil-filled photoelastic granular pack, varying the injection
flow rate, defending-fluid viscosity, and intergranular cohesion. We find two
different modes of fluid invasion: viscous fingering, and fracturing with
leak-off of the injection fluid. We directly visualize the evolving effective
stress field through the particles' photoelastic response, and discover a hoop
effective stress region behind the water invasion front, where we observe
tensile force chains in the circumferential direction. Outside the invasion
front, we observe compressive force chains aligning in the radial direction. We
conceptualize the system's behavior by means of a two-phase poroelastic
continuum model. The model captures granular pack dilation and compaction with
the boundary delineated by the invasion front, which explains the observed
distinct alignments of the force chains. Finally, we rationalize the crossover
from viscous fingering to fracturing by comparing the competing forces behind
the process: viscous force from fluid injection that drives fractures, and
intergranular cohesion and friction that resist fractures.

Active constituents burn fuel to sustain individual motion, giving rise to
collective effects that are not seen in systems at thermal equilibrium, such as
phase separation with purely repulsive interactions. There is a great potential
in harnessing the striking phenomenology of active matter to build novel
controllable and responsive materials that surpass passive ones. Yet, we
currently lack a systematic roadmap to predict the protocols driving active
systems between different states in a way that is thermodynamically optimal.
Equilibrium thermodynamics is an inadequate foundation to this end, due to the
dissipation rate arising from the constant fuel consumption in active matter.
Here, we derive and implement a versatile framework for the thermodynamic
control of active matter. Combining recent developments in stochastic
thermodynamics and nonequilibrium response theory, our approach shows how to
find the optimal control for either continuous- or discrete-state active
systems operating arbitrarily far from equilibrium. Our results open the door
to designing novel active materials which are not only built to stabilize
specific nonequilibrium collective states, but are also optimized to switch
between different states at minimum dissipation.

<h3>The effect of vacancies on magnetic correlations and conductance in  graphene nanoflakes with realistic Coulomb interaction</h3>

We study the effect of various configurations of vacancies on the magnetic
properties of graphene nanoflake (GNF) with screened realistic long-range
electron interaction [T. O. Wehling, et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 236805
(2011)] within the functional renormalization group approach. In agreement with
previous studies, the presence of vacancies in GNF yields to a strong
enhancement of spin-density-wave (SDW) correlations. We show however that only
some part of the considered configurations of vacancies posses SDW ground
state. The probability of a system with a random configuration of vacancies to
be in the SDW ground state increases with increase of vacancy concentration.
The disorder-averaged sublattice magnetization increases linearly with the
concentration of vacancies. The ratio of the sublattice magnetizations at the
center and edges of GNF, averaged over various realizations of disorder,
depends only weakly on the number of vacancies. The effects of vacancies on the
linear conductance and charge properties of GNF are discussed.

We present a self-consistent Maxwell-Bloch theory to analytically study the
interaction between a nanostructure consisting of a metal nanoparticle and a
monolayer of transition metal dichalcogenide. For the combined system, we
identify an effective eigenvalue equation that governs the center-of-mass
motion of the dressed excitons in a plasmon-induced potential. Examination of
the dynamical equation of the exciton-plasmon hybrid reveals the existence of
bound states with negative eigenenergies, which we interpret as excitons
localized in the plasmon-induced potential. The appearance of these bound
states in the potential indicates strong coupling between excitons and
plasmons. We quantify this coupling regime by computing the scattered light in
the near-field explicitly and identify signatures of strong exciton-plasmon
coupling with an avoided crossing behavior and an effective Rabi splitting of
tens of meV.

Unfaulting of Frank loops in irradiated fluoride oxides are of significance
to microstructural evolution. However, the mechanisms have not been directly
observed. To this end, we utilize molecular dynamics to reveal the atomistic
details related to the unfaulting process of interstitial Frank loop in
ThO$_2$, which involve nucleation of single or multiple Shockley partial pairs
at the loop circumference. The unfaulting is achieved via a synchronous shear
of the partial pairs to remove the extrinsic stacking fault in the cation
sublattice and the intrinsic stacking fault in the anion sublattice. The strong
oxygen motion at the dislocation core may reduce the activation barriers of
dislocation nucleation and migration. These findings provide a fundamental
understanding of the transformation of faulted loops in irradiated ThO$_2$, and
could be transferable to other fluorite systems.

<h3>Accuracy of ghost-rotationally-invariant slave-boson theory for  multi-orbital Hubbard model and realistic material</h3>

<i>Tsung-Han Lee, Corey Melnick, Ran Adler, Nicola Lanatà, Gabriel Kotliar</i>
<br>
<br>
We assess the accuracy of the ghost-rotationally-invariant slave-boson
(g-RISB) theory in multi-orbital systems by applying it to both the
three-orbital degenerate Hubbard model and a realistic Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ model
extracted from first principle simulations, and comparing the results to those
obtained using the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Our findings indicate
that g-RISB's accuracy can be systematically improved toward the exact DMFT
limit in infinite dimensional multiorbital models by increasing the number of
ghost orbitals. This allows for a more precise description of Hund's metal
behavior and Mott transition compared to the original RISB approach. We also
demonstrate that g-RISB reliably captures the quasiparticle weight, spectral
functions, and Fermi surface for the realistic Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ model compared to
DMFT. These results show the potential of g-RISB as a reliable tool for
simulating correlated materials. The connection between the g-RISB and DMFT
self-energy is also discussed.

<h3>Are Symmetry Protected Topological Phases Immune to Dephasing?</h3>

Harnessing topological phases with their dissipationless edge-channels
coupled with the effective engineering of quantum phase transitions is a spinal
aspect of topological electronics. The accompanying symmetry protection leads
to different kinds of topological edge-channels which include, for instance,
the quantum spin Hall phase, and the spin quantum anomalous Hall phase. To
model realistic devices, it is important to ratify the robustness of the
dissipationless edge-channels, which should typically exhibit a perfect quantum
of conductance, against various disorder and dephasing. This work is hence
devoted to a computational exploration of topological robustness against
various forms of dephasing. For this, we employ phenomenological dephasing
models under the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function formalism using a
model topological device setup on a 2D-Xene platform. Concurrently, we also
explicitly add disorder via impurity potentials in the channel and averaging
over hundreds of configurations. To describe the extent of robustness, we
quantify the decay of the conductance quantum with increasing disorder under
different conditions. Our analysis shows that these topological phases are
robust to experimentally relevant regimes of momentum dephasing and random
disorder potentials. We note that Rashba mixing worsens the performance of the
QSH phase and point out a mechanism for the same. Further, we observe that the
quantum spin Hall phase break downs due to spin dephasing, but the spin quantum
anomalous Hall phase remains robust. The spin quantum anomalous Hall phase
shows stark robustness under all the dephasing regimes, and shows promise for
realistic device structures for topological electronics applications.

<h3>In-plane magnetic penetration depth in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$: muon-spin  rotation/relaxation study</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report on measurements of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth
($\lambda_{\rm ab}$) in single crystals of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ down to $\simeq 0.015$
K by means of muon-spin rotation/relaxation. The linear temperature dependence
of $\lambda^{-2}_{\rm ab}$ for $T\lesssim 0.7$ K suggests the presence of nodes
in the superconducting gap. This statement is further substantiated by
observation of the Volovik effect, $i.e.$ the reduction of $\lambda_{ab}^{-2}$
as a function of the applied magnetic field. The experimental zero-field and
zero-temperature value of $\lambda_{\rm ab}=124(3)$ nm agrees with
$\lambda_{\rm ab}\simeq 130$ nm, calculated based on results of electronic
structure measurements reported in [Phys. Rev X 9, 021048 (2019)]. Our analysis
reveals that a simple nodal superconducting energy gap, described by the lowest
possible harmonic of a gap function, does not capture the dependence of
$\lambda_{\rm ab}^{-2}$ on $T$, so the higher angular harmonics of the energy
gap function need to be introduced.

<h3>Magnetic catalysis in weakly interacting hyperbolic Dirac materials</h3>

Due to linearly vanishing density of states, emergent massless Dirac
quasiparticle resulting from the free fermion motion on a family of
two-dimensional half-filled bipartite hyperbolic lattices feature dynamic mass
generation through quantum phase transitions only for sufficiently strong
finite-range Coulomb repulsion. As such, strong nearest-neighbor Coulomb
repulsion ($V$) is conducive to the nucleation of a charge-density-wave (CDW)
order with a staggered pattern of average fermionic density between two
sublattices of bipartite hyperbolic lattices. Considering a collection of
spinless fermions (for simplicity), here we show that application of strong
external magnetic fields by virtue of producing a \emph{finite} density of
states near the zero energy triggers the condensation of the CDW order even for
\emph{infinitesimal} $V$. The proposed magnetic catalysis mechanism is
operative for uniform as well as inhomogeneous (bell-shaped) magnetic fields.
We present scaling of the CDW order with the total flux enclosed by hyperbolic
Dirac materials for a wide range of (especially subcritical) $V$.
