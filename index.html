<h3>Density profiles and correlations of harmonically trapped ultracold  fermions via complex Langevin</h3>

Standard lattice formulations of non-relativistic Fermi gases with two spin
components suffer from a sign problem in the cases of repulsive contact
interactions and attractive contact interactions with spin imbalance. We
discuss the nature of this sign problem and the applicability of stochastic
quantisation with complex Langevin evolution in both cases. For repulsive
interactions, we find that the results converge, using adaptive step size
scaling and a Gaussian regulator to modify the lattice action. We present
results on density profiles and correlations of a harmonically trapped system
in one spatial dimension.

Magnetic topological quantum materials are attracting considerable attention
owing to their potential technological applications. However, only a small
number of these materials have been experimentally realized, thereby giving
rise to the need for new stable magnetic topological quantum materials.
Magnetism and spin-orbit coupling, two essential ingredients of the oxide
materials, lead to various topological transport phenomena such as the
anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst effects, which can be significantly
enhanced by designing an electronic structure with a large Berry curvature. In
that respect, double perovskites with the general formula A$_2$BB'O$_6$ with an
alternating ordered arrangement of two transition metal sites, B(3d) and
B'(4d/5d), present attractive possibilities as they are robustly stable against
oxidation under ambient conditions and versatile. These double perovskites also
offer a high energy scale for magnetism as well as strong spin-orbit coupling
with a high magnetic ordering temperature. Here, using first-principles density
functional theory calculations, we present a comprehensive study of the
intrinsic anomalous transport for 3d-4d/5d based cubic and tetragonal stable
double perovskite (DP) compounds. A few of the DPs exhibit a very large
anomalous Hall effect with a distinct topological band crossing in the vicinity
of the Fermi energy. Our results show the importance of symmetries,
particularly the mirror planes, as well as the clean topological band crossing
near the Fermi energy, which is primarily contributed by the 5d-t$_{2g}$ for
large anomalous Hall and Nernst effects.

Combining experimental observations of Quincke roller clusters with computer
simulations and a stability analysis, we explore the formation and stability of
two interlocked self-propelled dumbbells. For large self-propulsion and
significant geometric interlocking, there is a stable joint spinning motion of
two dumbbells. The spinning frequency can be tuned by the self-propulsion speed
of a single dumbbell, which is controlled by an external electric field for the
experiments. For typical experimental parameters the rotating pair is stable
with respect to thermal fluctuations but hydrodynamic interactions due to the
rolling motion of neighboring dumbbells leads to a break-up of the pair. Our
results provide a general insight into the stability of spinning active
colloidal molecules which are geometrically locked.

<h3>Nanostructuring Strategies for Silicon-based Anodes in Lithium-ion  Batteries: Tuning Areal Silicon Loading, SEI Formation/Irreversible Capacity  Loss, Rate Capability Retention and Electrode Durability</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11678" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11678</a>

Silicon is one of the most promising anode materials for Lithium-ion
batteries. Silicon endures volume changes upon cycling, which leads to
subsequent pulverization and capacity fading. These drawbacks lead to a poor
lifespan and hamper the commercialization of silicon anodes. In this work, a
hybrid nanostructured anode based on silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) anchored on
vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) with defined spacing to
accommodate volumetric changes is synthesized on commercial macroscopic current
collector. Achieving electrodes with good stability and excellent
electrochemical properties remain a challenge. Therefore, we herein tune the
active silicon areal loading either through the modulation of the SiNPs volume
by changing the silicon deposition time at a fixed VACNTs carpet length or
through the variation of the VACNT length at a fixed SiNPs volume. The low
areal loading of SiNPs improves capacity stability during cycling but triggers
large irreversible capacity losses due to the formation of the solid
electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. By contrast, higher areal loading electrode
reduces the quantity of the SEI formed, but negatively impacts the capacity
stability of the electrode during the subsequent cycles. A higher gravimetric
capacity and higher areal loading mass of silicon is achieved via an increase
of VACNTs carpet length without compromising cycling stability. This hybrid
nanostructured electrode shows an excellent stability with reversible capacity
of 1330 mAh g-1 after 2000 cycles.

<h3>Epitaxial growth of atomically thin Ga2Se2 films on c-plane sapphire  substrates</h3>

<br>
<br>
Broadening the variety of two-dimensional (2D) materials and improving the
synthesis of ultrathin films are crucial to the development of the
semiconductor industry. As a state-of-the-art 2D material, Ga2Se2 has
attractive optoelectronic properties when it reaches the atomically-thin
regime. However, its van der Waals epitaxial growth, especially for the
atomically-thin films, has seldom been studied. In this paper, we used
molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize Ga2Se2 single-crystal films with a surface
roughness down to 1.82 nm on c-plane sapphire substrates by optimizing
substrate temperature, Se:Ga flux ratio, and growth rate. Then we used a 3-step
mode to grow Ga2Se2 films with a thickness as low as 3 tetralayers and a
surface roughness as low as 0.61 nm, far exceeding the performance of direct
growth. Finally, we found that the surface morphology strongly depends on the
Se:Ga flux ratio, and higher growth rates widened the suitable flux ratio
window for growing Ga2Se2. Overall, this work advances the understanding of the
vdW epitaxy growth mechanism for post-transition metal monochalcogenides on
sapphire substrates.

<h3>Atomic-scale modeling of the thermal decomposition of  titanium(IV)-isopropoxide</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11871" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11871</a>

<br>
<br>
The metal-organic (MO) compound titanium(IV)-isopropoxide (Ti(OiPr)4, TTIP)
has tremendous technological relevance for thin film growth and coating
technologies, offering a low-temperature deposition route for titania and
titanium-oxide-based compounds. Thermal decomposition via the release of
organic ligands, a key process in any TTIP-based synthesis approach, is
commonly assumed to take place only via the beta-hydride elimination process.
Here, we present reactive force field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF-MD) and
metadynamics simulations that challenge this conventionally assumed scenario by
revealing different, energetically preferred reaction pathways. The complete
reaction scheme for the TTIP thermolysis, along with the statistics for the
different ligand liberation steps and the associated reaction barriers for the
bond dissociation events is presented. ReaxFF-MD simulations performed in the
dilute limit realistically capture typical thin film deposition conditions,
which in combination with metadynamics data, which produces free energies,
constitutes a very powerful tool to quantitatively analyze the reaction
dynamics of MO-based thin film growth processes and provide an atomic-scale
understanding of how the remaining organic ligands detach from different
titanium-containing MO fragments. The approach presented here allows for
effective and straightforward identification of the undesirable temperature
biasing effects in ReaxFF-MD and represents a predictive framework to identify
chemical reaction pathways relevant to film growth processes at the atomic
scale under realistic, experimentally relevant conditions. It enables
computationally informed engineering of MO molecules with tailored
decomposition and reaction pathways, and thus rapid and cost-effective
advancements in MO molecule design for existing and future applications of thin
film deposition and coating processes.

<h3>Metallic water: transient state under ultrafast electronic excitation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11897" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11897</a>
<br>
<i>Nikita Medvedev, Roman Voronkov, Alexander E. Volkov</i>
<br>
<br>
The modern means of controlled irradiation by femtosecond lasers or swift
heavy ion beams can transiently produce such energy densities in samples that
reach collective electronic excitation levels of the warm dense matter state
where the potential energy of interaction of the particles is comparable to
their kinetic energies (temperatures of a few eV). Such massive electronic
excitation severely alters the interatomic potentials, producing unusual
nonequilibrium states of matter and different chemistry. We employ density
functional theory and tight binding molecular dynamics formalisms to study the
response of bulk water to ultrafast excitation of its electrons. After a
certain threshold electronic temperature, the water becomes electronically
conducting via the collapse of its band gap. At high doses, it is accompanied
by nonthermal acceleration of ions to a temperature of a few thousand Kelvins
within sub-100 fs timescales. We identify the interplay of this nonthermal
mechanism with the electron-ion coupling, enhancing the electron-to-ions energy
transfer. Various chemically active fragments are formed from the
disintegrating water molecules, depending on the deposited dose.

<h3>Stoichiometric Control and Optical Properties of BaTiO3 Thin Films Grown  by Hybrid MBE</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11898" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11898</a>

<br>
<br>
BaTiO3 is a technologically relevant material in the perovskite oxide class
with above room temperature ferroelectricity and a very large electro optical
coefficient, making it highly suitable for emerging electronic and photonic
devices. An easy, robust, straightforward, and scalable growth method is
required to synthesize epitaxial BaTiO3 thin films with sufficient control over
the film stoichiometry to achieve reproducible thin film properties. Here we
report the growth of BaTiO3 thin films by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy. A self
regulated growth window is identified using complementary information obtained
from reflection high energy electron diffraction, the intrinsic film lattice
parameter, film surface morphology, and scanning transmission electron
microscopy. Subsequent optical characterization of the BaTiO3 films by
spectroscopic ellipsometry revealed refractive index and extinction coefficient
values closely resembling those of stoichiometric bulk BaTiO3 crystals for
films grown inside the growth window. Even in the absence of a lattice
parameter change of BaTiO3 thin films, degradation of optical properties was
observed, accompanied by the appearance of a wide optical absorption peak in
the infrared spectrum, attributed to optical transitions involving defect
states present. Therefore, the optical properties of BaTiO3 can be utilized as
a much finer and more straightforward probe to determine the stoichiometry
level present in BaTiO3 films.

<h3>Marginal Fermi liquid at magnetic quantum criticality from dimensional  confinement</h3>

Metallic quantum criticality is frequently discussed as a source for
non-Fermi liquid behavior, but controlled theoretical treatments are scarce.
Here we identify and study a novel magnetic quantum critical point in a
two-dimensional antiferromagnet coupled to a three-dimensional environment of
conduction electrons. Using sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations
and an effective field-theory analysis, we demonstrate that the quantum
critical point is characterized by marginal Fermi liquid behavior. In
particular, we compute the electrical resistivity for transport across the
magnetic layer, which is shown to display a linear temperature dependence at
criticality. Experimental realizations in Kondo heterostructures are discussed.

<h3>Interacting Bosons on Crystalline and Quasiperiodic Ladders in a  Magnetic Field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11286" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11286</a>

We study a variety of Hofstadter ladders in order to probe the interplay
between interactions, an applied magnetic field and crystalline or
quasiperiodic geometries. Rotational motion will be induced on charged
particles when a magnetic field is present, which can result in exotic
distributions of current on a lattice. Typically, the geometry of a ladder
lattice is assumed to be homogeneous. In this work, however, we will also study
ladders that possess non-uniform bond lengths, in order to study the formation
of localised currents. By using Density Matrix Renormalisation Group (DMRG) to
characterise the quantum phases, we confirm the presence of the usual vortex
and Meissner distributions of current, in which particles circulate within the
bulk and around the edge respectively. Furthermore, it is also possible to
observe variations to these patterns; which combine both vortex and Meissner
order, and the onset of incompressible domains for certain fillings of the
lattice. If the bond lengths of a ladder fluctuate, we find substantial
differences to the structure of currents. This is a consequence of an
inhomogeneous, effective magnetic flux, resulting in preferential localisation
of currents throughout the lattice bulk, towards the smaller bond lengths. We
then find that incompressible domains can significantly grow in size extent
across the parameter space, with currents no longer possessing an extended
structure across the longitudinal direction of the ladder.

<h3>Stability and strength of monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$</h3>

Two-dimensional fullerene networks have been synthesized in several forms
[Hou \textit{et al}., \textit{Nature} \textbf{2022}, 606, 507], and it is
unknown which monolayer form is stable at ambient condition. Using first
principles calculations, I show that the believed stability of the
quasi-tetragonal phases is challenged by mechanical, dynamic or thermodynamic
stability. For all temperatures, the quasi-hexagonal phase is thermodynamically
least stable. However, the relatively high dynamic and mechanical stabilities
suggest that the quasi-hexagonal phase is intrinsically stronger than the other
phases under various strains. The origin of the high stability and strength of
the quasi-hexagonal phase can be attributed to the strong covalent C$-$C bonds
that strongly hold the linked C$_{60}$ clusters together, enabling the closely
packed hexagonal network. These results rationalize the experimental
observations that so far only the quasi-hexagonal phase has been exfoliated
experimentally as monolayers.

<h3>Adiabatic preparation of fractional Chern insulators from an effective  thin-torus limit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11294" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11294</a>
<br>
<i>Benjamin Michen, Cécile Repellin, Jan Carl Budich</i>
<br>
<br>
We explore the quasi one-dimensional (thin torus, or TT) limit of fractional
Chern insulators (FCIs) as a starting point for their adiabatic preparation in
quantum simulators. Our approach is based on tuning the hopping amplitude in
one direction as an experimentally amenable knob to dynamically change the
effective aspect ratio of the system. Similar to the TT limit of fractional
quantum Hall (FQH) systems in the continuum, we find that the hopping-induced
TT limit adiabatically connects the FCI state to a trivial charge density wave
(CDW) ground state. This adiabatic path may be harnessed for state preparation
schemes relying on the initialization of a CDW state followed by the adiabatic
decrease of a hopping anisotropy. Our findings are based on the calculation of
the excitation gap in a number of FCI models, both on a lattice and consisting
of coupled wires. By analytical calculation of the gap in the limit of strongly
anisotropic hopping, we show that its scaling is compatible with the
preparation of large size FCIs for sufficiently large hopping anisotropy. Our
numerical simulations in the framework of exact diagonalization explore the
full anisotropy range to corroborate these results.

<h3>Finite-size Topology</h3>

<br>
<i>Ashley M. Cook, Anne E. B. Nielsen</i>
<br>
<br>
The bulk-boundary correspondence is a corner stone of topological physics and
yields phenomena of great interest, such as the quasiparticles of
topologically-protected quantum computation schemes and the boundary metals of
spintronics platforms. Here, we show that bulk-boundary correspondence in
finite-size systems is fundamentally different from that of infinite-size
systems: as D-1 dimensional topological boundary states permeate into a
system's D dimensional bulk with decreasing system size, they interfere to
create novel topological phases, including some with an additional
bulk-boundary correspondence: the value of a topological invariant computed for
the quasi-(D-1) dimensional bulk (D-dimensional system with open boundary
conditions and finite size in one direction) determines the presence or absence
of quasi-(D-2) dimensional boundary modes. This additional bulk-boundary
correspondence occurs while the system exhibits topological responses
associated with a non-trivial D-dimensional topological invariant. We
demonstrate this physics for the paradigmatic Chern insulator phase, but show
its requirements for realization are satisfied by a much broader set of
topological systems.

<h3>A $j_{\rm eff}=1/2$ Kitaev material on the triangular lattice: The case  of NaRuO$_2$</h3>

<br>
<i>Aleksandar Razpopov, David A. S. Kaib, Steffen Backes, Leon Balents, Stephen D. Wilson, Francesco Ferrari, Kira Riedl, Roser Valenti</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by recent reports of a quantum disordered ground state in the
triangular lattice compound NaRuO$_2$, we derive a $j_{\rm eff}=1/2$ magnetic
model for this system by means of first-principles calculations. The pseudospin
Hamiltonian features a ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor Heisenberg exchange and
large anisotropic couplings, most notably antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor
Kitaev and off-diagonal $\Gamma$ terms. In addition to bilinear interactions,
we find a sizable four-spin ring exchange contribution with a strongly
anisotropic character, which has been so far overlooked when modeling Kitaev
materials. The analysis of the magnetic model, based on the minimization of the
classical energy and exact diagonalization of the quantum Hamiltonian, points
toward the existence of a rather robust (in-plane) ferromagnetic order, which
cannot be easily destabilized by physically relevant perturbations.

We introduce an end-to-end computational framework that enables
hyperparameter optimization with the DeepHyper library, accelerated training,

the prediction of user-specified materials properties in modern computing
environments, and to demonstrate translational applications for the modeling of
small molecules, crystals and metal organic frameworks with a unified,
stand-alone framework. We deployed and tested this framework in the ThetaGPU
supercomputer at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, and the Delta

<h3>Exploring a novel class of Janus MXenes by first principles  calculations: structural, electronic and magnetic properties of Sc2CXT, X=O,  F, OH; T=C, S, N</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11326" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11326</a>
<br>
<i>Sibel Özcan, Blanca Biel</i>
<br>
<br>
The already intriguing electronic and optical properties of the MXene Sc2C
family can be further tuned through a wide range of possible
functionalizations. Here, by means of Density Functional Theory, we show that
the 36 possible elements of the Janus MXT (M:Sc2C, X:O, F, OH, T:C, N, S)
family, built by considering the four possible structural models (i) FCC, (ii)
HCP , (iii) FCC + HCP, and (iv) HCP + FCC, are all potentially stable. The
analysis of their mechanical properties shows the excellent mechanical
flexibility of functionalized MXenes (f-MXenes) under large strain, making them
more suitable for applications where stress could be an issue. Interestingly,
while Sc2C presents a metallic character, Sc2COS, Sc2CFN and Sc2COHN are found
to be semiconductors with bandgaps of 2.5 eV (indirect), 1.67 eV (indirect) and
1.1 eV (direct), respectively, which presents promising applications for nano-
and optoelectronics. Moreover, Sc2CFC presents a ferromagnetic ground state
with the 2x2x1 supercell magnetic moment of 3.99 muB, while the ground state of
Sc2COHC might be antiferromagnetic with a magnetic moment of 3.98 muB,
depending on the environment. Remarkably, the band structures of Sc2CFC and
Sc2COHC present a half-metallic character with an HSE06 fundamental band gap of
0.60 eV and 0.48 eV, respectively. Our results confirm the extraordinary
potential of the Janus MXT (M:Sc2C, X:O, F, OH, T:C, N, S) family for novel
applications in 2D nano-,opto- and spintronics.

<br>
<br>
Quantum magnetic impurities give rise to a wealth of phenomena attracting
tremendous research interest in recent years. On a normal metal, magnetic
impurities generate the correlation-driven Kondo effect. On a superconductor,
bound states emerge inside the superconducting gap called the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov
(YSR) states. Theoretically, quantum impurity problems have been successfully
tackled by numerical renormalization group (NRG) theory, where the Kondo and
YSR physics are shown to be unified and the normalized YSR energy scales
universally with the Kondo temperature divided by the superconducting gap.
However, experimentally the Kondo temperature is usually extracted from
phenomenological approaches, which gives rise to significant uncertainties and
cannot account for magnetic fields properly. Using scanning tunneling
microscopy at 10mK, we apply a magnetic field to several YSR impurities on a
vanadium tip to reveal the Kondo effect and employ the microscopic single
impurity Anderson model with NRG to fit the Kondo spectra in magnetic fields
accurately and extract the corresponding Kondo temperature unambiguously. Some
YSR states move across the quantum phase transition (QPT) due to the changes in
atomic forces during tip approach, yielding a continuous universal scaling with
quantitative precision for quantum spin-1/2 impurities.

We measured room-temperature phonon Raman spectra of changchengite (IrBiS)
and compared the experimental phonon wavenumbers to the theoretical ones
obtained by means of the \emph{ab initio} density-functional-theory
calculations in the presence and absence of the spin-orbit coupling effects.
Combining two different excitation photon energies all the symmetry predicted
Raman modes are experimentally observed. The electronic properties of IrBiS are
found to be similar to the recently studied isostructural compound IrBiSe
showing a large Dresselhaus spin-orbit valence band splitting. A good agreement
between the experimental and theoretically predicted Raman phonon wavenumbers
is found only when the lattice parameter is constrained to the experimental
value. The inclusion of the spin orbit coupling does not significantly affect
the phonon wavenumbers.

<h3>Post-Synthetic Treatment of Nickel-Iron Layered Double Hydroxides for  the Optimum Catalysis of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</h3>

<br>
<br>
Nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) platelets with high
morphological regularity and sub-micrometre lateral dimensions were synthesized
using a homogeneous precipitation technique for highly efficient catalysis of
the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Considering edge sites are the point of
activity, efforts were made to control platelet size within the synthesized
dispersions. The goal is to controllably isolate and characterize size-reduced
NiFe LDH particles. Synthetic approaches for size control of NiFe LDH platelets
have not been transferable based on published work with other LDH materials and
for that reason, we instead use post-synthetic treatment techniques to improve
edge-site density. In the end, size reduced NiFe LDH/single-wall carbon
nanotube (SWCNT) composites allowed to further reduce the OER overpotential to
237 plus/minus 7 mV ( L = 0.16 plus/minus 0.01 micrometres, 20 wt% SWCNT),
which is one of the best values reported to date. This approach as well
improved the long term activity of the catalyst in operating conditions.

Topological semimetals are a class of novel three-dimensional (3D) electronic
phases that feature topologically protected conical band-touchings at the Fermi
level. These band-touching points are monopoles of Berry curvature in momentum
space and effectively realize (3+1)-dimensional Weyl fermions as emergent
quasiparticles. Such features are robust to perturbations but not completely
insensitive to them. In this thesis, we explore the yet fertile ground of
disordered Weyl semimetals (WSMs), most notably by analysing the effects of
on-site random fields, random smooth potential regions, point-like scalar
impurities, and lattice point-defects in their electronic structure and
electrodynamic properties.

We introduce a model of Dirac fermions in 2+1 dimensions with a semimetallic,
a quantum spin-Hall insulating (QSHI), and an s-wave superconducting (SSC)
phase. The phase diagram features a multicritical point at which all three
phases meet as well as a QSHI-SSC deconfined critical point. The QSHI and SSC
orders correspond to mutually anti-commuting mass terms of the Dirac
Hamiltonian. Based on this algebraic property, SO(5) symmetric field theories
have been put forward to describe both types of critical points. Using quantum
Monte Carlo simulations, we directly study the operator that rotates between
QSHI and SSC states. The results suggest that it commutes with the low-energy
effective Hamiltonian at criticality but has a gap in the ordered phases. This
implies an emergent SO(5) symmetry at both the multicritical and the deconfined
critical points.

Interactions between organic species and natural minerals are fundamental to
the processes around us. With the aid of molecular dynamics simulations, we
identify key adsorption mechanisms of apigenin on smectite clay minerals. The
mechanism is highly sensitive to the pH -- changing from co-crystallisation in
acidic-to-neutral solutions to the ion-bridging in mild-alkaline. The ionic
species play a significant role in alkaline environments: the deprotonated
apigenin species chelate metals, which, in turn, leads to the formation of a
stable organic-metal-mineral complex and stronger adsorption in the presence of
divalent cations.Smectite clays buffer the solution to mildly alkaline; hence,
the type of exchangeable cations in the clay will be critical in determining
the adsorption mechanism and organic retention capacity. Overall, our study
showcases a computational strategy that can be transferred to a wide variety of
organic-mineral systems in the natural environment.

<br>
<br>
We report experimental observation and theoretical modeling of fluctuations
in a non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate of polaritons near the phase
boundary for onset of condensation. We find a critical fluctuation effect in
which the fluctuations have a maximum at the phase boundary. Surprisingly, we
see these fluctuations on time scales very long compared to the intrinsic
scattering time of the polaritons, indicating that the system has metastable
telegraph-type switching between modes. The theoretical modeling reproduces the
experimental effects, and indicates that classical noise is not sufficient to
explain the experiments; quantum noise must be introduced in the model.

<h3>Computing the intrinsic grain boundary mobility tensor</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11462" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11462</a>
<br>
<i>Xinyuan Song, Liang Yang, Chuang Deng</i>
<br>
<br>
Grain boundary (GB) mobility has been conventionally computed as a single
value; however, a recent study has suggested that GB mobility should be
expressed as a tensor. In this work, by using atomistic simulations, the
concept of GB mobility being applied to the shear direction was re-examined and
it is found that it follows the same physical rule as the conventionally
defined GB mobility based on the normal direction. The interface random walk
method was then used to compute the intrinsic GB mobility tensor at the
zero-driving force limit. In order to compute the off-diagonal elements of the
intrinsic GB mobility tensor, a shear coupling strength S is introduced in this
study, which we believe can better reflect the intrinsic characteristics of a
GB for its coupling trend between the normal and shear motion than the widely
used shear coupling factor. Furthermore, the effect of temperature and external
driving force on the GB mobility tensor, especially on its symmetry, was
systematically investigated. It is shown that the GB mobility in either the
normal or shear direction can show a non-Arrhenius type dependence on the
applied driving force, which is similar to the widely reported non-Arrhenius
(or anti-thermal) dependence of GB mobility on temperature. Accordingly, the
classical GB migration equation was adapted to describe the diverse variation
of GB mobility due to changes in both temperature and driving force.

<br>
<br>
In this work we perform a detailed first-principles analysis of the
electronic and optical properties of NiBr$_2$ within the state-of-the-art
$GW$+BSE scheme to determine whether this system displays negative excitonic
energies, which would identify it as an (half) excitonic insulator. Particular
attention is payed to the convergence of the $GW$ band structure and to the
consistency between approximations employed in the ground-state calculations
and approximations employed in the linear response calculations. We show that
these two issues play a crucial role in identifying the excitonic nature of
NiBr$_2$.

<h3>Explicit derivation of the chiral and (generic) helical edge states for  the Kane-Mele model: Closed expressions for the wave function, dispersion  relation, and spin rotation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11520" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11520</a>
<br>
<i>Fatemeh Rahmati, Mohsen Amini, Morteza Soltani, Mozhgan Sadeghizadeh</i>
<br>
<br>
While one of the most important and intriguing features of the topological
insulators is the presence of edge states, the closed-form expressions for the
edge states of some famous topological models are still lacking. Here, we focus
on the Kane-Mele model with and without Rashba spin-orbit coupling as a
well-known model to describe a two-dimensional version of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$
topological insulator to study the properties of its edge states analytically.
By considering the tight-binding model on a honeycomb lattice with zigzag
boundaries and introducing a perturbative approach, we derive explicit
expressions for the wave functions, energy dispersion relations, and the spin
rotations of the (generic) helical edge states. To this end, we first map the
edge states of the ribbon geometry into an effective two-leg ladder model with
momentum-dependent energy parameters. Then, we split the Hamiltonian of the
system into an unperturbed part and a perturbation. The unperturbed part has a
flat-band energy spectrum and can be solved exactly which allows us to consider
the remaining part of the Hamiltonian perturbatively. The resulting energy
dispersion relation within the first-order perturbation, surprisingly, is in
excellent agreement with the numerical spectra over a very wide range of
wavenumbers. Our perturbative framework also allows deriving an explicit form
for the rotation of the spins of the momentum edge states in the absence of
axial spin symmetry due to the Rashba spin-orbit interaction.

<h3>The role of damping rate amplitude in the synchronization of two coupled  oscillators</h3>

<br>
<i>A. Hamadeh, A. Koujok, I. Medlej, P. Pirro, S. Petit</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the synchronization phenomenon between two Spin-transfer
Torque Nano-Oscillators (STNOs) of different frequencies in two pillar systems
under vortex configuration detunings or driving frequencies. The oscillators'
mutual synchronization occurs through magnetic dipolar interaction. Our
micromagnetic simulations show that an amplitude fluctuation referred to as
$\Gamma_p$ has a significant impact on determining the synchronization
frequency. The evolution of frequency and amplitude fluctuation rate in two
different oscillator sizes versus external perpendicular field are compared and
discussed. Our results reveal that the oscillator with lower $\Gamma_p$,
referred to as the "Leader" oscillator, leads the synchronization process. As
such, the "follower" oscillator adjusts its frequency as to that of the
"Leader", thus achieving synchronization. We believe that taking $\Gamma_p$
into consideration can help in controlling synchronization frequencies in
future building blocks of any network multi-array spintronics' devices.

<h3>Increased material differentiation through multi-contrast x-ray imaging:  a preliminary evaluation of potential applications to the detection of threat  materials</h3>

Most material discrimination in security inspections is based on dual-energy
x-ray imaging, which enables the determination of a material's effective atomic
number (Zeff) as well as electron density and its consequent classification as
organic or inorganic. Recently phase-based "dark-field" x-ray imaging
approaches have emerged that are sensitive to complementary features of a
material, namely its unresolved microstructure. It can therefore be speculated
that their inclusion in the security-based imaging could enhance material
discrimination, for example of materials with similar electron densities and Z
eff but different microstructures. In this paper, we present a preliminary
evaluation of the advantages that such a combination could bear. Utilising an
energy-resolved detector for a phase-based dark-field technique provides
dual-energy attenuation and dark-field images simultaneously. In addition,
since we use a method based on attenuating x-ray masks to generate the
dark-field images, a fifth (attenuation) image at a much higher photon energy
is obtained by exploiting the x-rays transmitted through the highly absorbing
mask septa. In a first test, a threat material is imaged against a non-threat
one, and we show how their discrimination based on maximising their relative
contrast through linear combinations of two and five imaging channels leads to
an improvement in the latter case. We then present a second example to show how
the method can be extended to discrimination against more than one non-threat
material, obtaining similar results. Albeit admittedly preliminary, these
results indicate that significant margins of improvement in material
discrimination are available by including additional x-ray contrasts in the
scanning process.

<h3>Hybrid Magnonic-Oscillator System</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11532" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11532</a>
<br>
<i>A. Hamadeh, D. Breitbach, M. Ender, A. Koujok, M. Mohseni, F. Kohl, J. Maskill, M. Bechberger, P. Pirro</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a hybrid magnonic-oscillator system based on the combination of a
spin transfer auto-oscillator and a magnonic waveguide to open new perspectives
for spin-wave based circuits. The system is composed of a spin transfer
oscillator based on a vortex state which is dipolarly coupled to a nanoscale
spin-wave waveguide with longitudinal magnetization. In its auto-oscillating
regime, the oscillator emits coherent spin waves with tunable and controllable
frequencies, directions and amplitudes into the waveguide. We demonstrate the
principle of this method using micromagnetic simulations and show that
reconfiguration of the system is possible by changing the chirality and
polarity of the magnetic vortex. Spin waves are emitted into the waveguide with
high non-reciprocity and the preferred direction depends on the core polarity
of the vortex. In contrast, different vortex chiralities lead to different
amplitudes of the emitted waves. Our findings open up a novel way to design an
agile spintronic device for the coherent and tunable generation of propagating
spin waves.

<h3>Prediction of surface reconstructions using MAGUS</h3>

<br>
<i>Yu Han, Junjie Wang, Chi Ding, Hao Gao, Shuning Pan, Qiuhan Jia, Jian Sun</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, we present a new module to predict the potential surface
reconstruction configurations of given surface structures in the framework of
our machine learning and graph theory assisted universal structure searcher
(MAGUS). In addition to random structures generated with specific lattice
symmetry, we made full use of bulk materials to obtain a better distribution of
population energy, namely, randomly appending atoms to a surface cleaved from
bulk structures or moving/removing some of the atoms on the surface, which is
inspired by natural surface reconstruction processes. In addition, we borrowed
ideas from cluster predictions to spread structures better between different
compositions, considering that surface models of different atom numbers usually
have some building blocks in common. To validate this newly developed module,
we tested it with studies on the surface reconstructions of Si (100), Si (111)
and 4H-SiC(1-102)-c(2x2), respectively. We successfully gave the known ground
states as well as a new SiC surface model in an extremely Si-rich environment.

<h3>Scaling, saturation, and upper bounds in the failure of topologically  interlocked structures</h3>

<br>
<br>
Topological Interlocking Structures (TIS) have been increasingly studied in
the past two decades. However, some fundamental questions concerning the
effects of Young's modulus and the friction coefficient on the structural
mechanics of the most common type of TIS application - centrally loaded slabs -
are not yet clear. Here, we present a first-of-its-kind parametric study based
on the Level-Set-Discrete-element-Method that aims to clarify how these two
parameters affect multiple aspects of the behavior and failure of
centrally-loaded TIS slabs. This includes the evolution of the structural
response up to and including failure, the foremost structural response
parameters, and the residual carrying capacity. We find that the structural
response parameters in TIS slabs scale linearly with Young's modulus, that they
saturate with the friction coefficient, and that the saturated response
provides an upper-bound on the capacity of centrally loaded TIS slabs reported
in the literature. This, together with additional findings, insights, and
observations, comprise a novel contribution to our understanding of the
interlocked structural form.

<h3>Low temperature amorphous solids: mean field theory and beyond</h3>

<br>
Amorphous solids at low temperature display unusual features which have been
escaped a clear and unified comprehension. In recent years a mean field theory
of amorphous solids constructed in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions has
been proposed. I will briefly review what is the outcome of this theory
focusing the low temperature phase and discuss some perspectives to go beyond
the mean field limit.

<h3>Design of a room-temperature topological exciton-polariton laser in a  ZnO/TiO$_2$-photonic crystal slab</h3>

<br>
<i>I. Septembre, C. Leblanc, L. Hermet, H. S. Nguyen, X. Letartre, D. D. Solnyshkov, G. Malpuech</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose theoretically a scheme to get a room-temperature 2D topological
exciton-polariton laser with propagating topological lasing modes. The
structure uses guided modes in a photonic crystal slab. A ZnO layer provides
strong excitonic resonances stable at room temperature. It is capped by a
TiO$_2$ layer pierced by a triangular lattice. The exciton-polariton modes of
the 3D structure are computed by solving numerically Maxwell's equations
including the excitonic response. The designed triangular lattice shows a
transverse electric gap. The triangular lattice is shown to be the limit of a
staggered honeycomb lattice when one of the sub-lattices vanishes. Its topology
can be characterized by symmetry indicators. The interface between two shifted
triangular lattices supports two counter-propagating modes lying in the gap of
the bulk modes. The interface states are analogous to quantum pseudospin Hall
interface states. These modes show orthogonal polarizations. They can be
selectively excited using polarized excitation and are well-protected from
back-scattering. These modes can benefit from the exciton-polariton gain at
room temperature because of their sufficiently large exciton fraction and
favorable position in energy. The strong localization of these propagating
modes makes them suitable to host topological lasing triggered by a
non-resonant pump localized on the interface.

<h3>Elastic precursor effects during the Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$TiO$_{3}$  ferroelastic phase transitions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11564" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11564</a>

<br>
<br>
Elastic softening in the paraelastic phases of Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$TiO$_{3}$ is
largest near the transition temperatures and decreases on heating smoothly over
extended temperature ranges. Softening extends to the highest measured
temperature(850~K) for Ba-rich compounds. The temperature evolution of the
excess compliance of the precursor softening follows a power law $\delta
S\propto |T-T_{\mathrm{C}}|^{-\kappa }$\ with a characteristic exponent $\kappa
$\ ranging between 1.5 in SrTiO$_{3}$\ and 0.2 in BaTiO$_{3}$. The latter value
is below the estimated lower bounds of displacive systems with three orthogonal
soft phonon branches (0.5). An alternative Vogel-Fulcher analysis shows that
the softening is described by extremely low Vogel-Fulcher energies $E_{a}$,
which increase from SrTiO$_{3}$% \ to BaTiO$_{3}$\ indicating a change from a
displacive to a weakly order/disorder character of the elastic precursor. Mixed
crystals of Ba$_{x}$% Sr$_{1-x}$TiO$_{3}$ possess intermediate behaviour. The
amplitudes of the precursor elastic softening increases continuously from
SrTiO$_{3}$ to BaTiO$% _{3}$. Using power law fittings reveals that the elastic
softening is still $% 33\%$ of the unsoftened Young's modulus at temperatures
as high as 750 K in BaTiO$_{3}$ with $\kappa \simeq $ 0.2. This proves that the
high temperature elastic properties of these materials are drastically affected
by elastic precursor softening.

<h3>Better than counting: Orientational distribution functions from torque  sampling</h3>

<br>
<i>Johannes Renner, Matthias Schmidt, Daniel de las Heras</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce a method to sample the orientational distribution function in
computer simulations. The method is based on the exact torque balance equation
for classical many-body systems of interacting anisotropic particles in
equilibrium. Instead of the traditional counting of events, we reconstruct the
orientational distribution function via an orientational integral of the torque
acting on the particles. We test the torque sampling method in two- and
three-dimensions, using both Langevin dynamics and overdamped Brownian
dynamics, and with two interparticle interaction potentials. In all cases the
torque sampling method produces profiles of the orientational distribution
function with better accuracy than those obtained with the traditional counting
method. The accuracy of the torque sampling method is independent of the bin
size, and hence it is possible to resolve the orientational distribution
function with arbitrarily small angular resolutions.

<br>
<br>
We developed a parabolic effective mass model with the aim to describe the
in-plane constricted superconductivity in few-monolayer MgB$_2$. The model was
employed to study a constricted quasi-$1$D superlattice with the simplest
version of the Anderson approximation. Resonant Fano-Feshbach-like effect was
found, between a miniband of a continuous normal state dispersion cutting
across $E_F$ and a miniband of quasi-discrete dispersion, even though the
latter is significantly energetically distanced from the Fermi level. The
origin of the phenomenon was identified to be the presence of characteristic
strongly localised eigenstates, due to the specific material parameters.
Moreover, the mechanism leading to a "precursor" pseudogap region in a system
with a non-zero phase difference is described, when the strength of the
coupling is still not sufficient to open a superconducting gap, but enough to
introduce electron-hole mixing into the system.

<h3>Modular nanomagnet design for spin qubits confined in a linear chain</h3>

<br>
<br>
On-chip micromagnets enable electrically controlled quantum gates on electron
spin qubits. Extending the concept to a large number of qubits is challenging
in terms of providing large enough driving gradients and individual
addressability. Here we present a design aimed at driving spin qubits arranged
in a linear chain and strongly confined in directions lateral to the chain.
Nanomagnets are placed laterally to one side of the qubit chain, one nanomagnet
per two qubits. The individual magnets are "U"-shaped, such that the magnetic
shape anisotropy orients the magnetization alternately towards and against the
qubit chain even if an external magnetic field is applied along the qubit
chain. The longitudinal and transversal stray field components serve as
addressability and driving fields. Using micromagnetic simulations we calculate
driving and dephasing rates and the corresponding qubit quality factor. The
concept is validated with spin-polarized scanning electron microscopy of Fe
nanomagnets fabricated on silicon substrates, finding excellent agreement with
micromagnetic simulations. Several features required for a scalable spin qubit
design are met in our approach: strong driving and weak dephasing gradients,
reduced crosstalk and operation at low external magnetic field.

We show that the amplitude, or Higgs mode of a superconductor with strong
spin-orbit coupling and an exchange field, couples linearly to the
electromagnetic field. Furthermore, by coupling such a superconductor to an LC
resonator, we demonstrate that the Higgs resonance becomes a regular mode at
frequencies smaller than the quasiparticle energy threshold $2\Delta$. We
finally propose and discuss a possible experiment based on microwave
spectroscopy for an unequivocal detection of the Higgs mode. Our approach may
allow visualizing Higgs modes also in more complicated multiband
superconductors with a coupling between the charge and other electronic degrees
of freedom.

<br>
<br>
We demonstrate the use of a ring-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate as a
rotation sensor by measuring the interference between two counter-propagating
phonon modes imprinted azimuthally around the ring. We observe rapid decay of
the excitations, quantified by quality factors of at most $Q \approx 27$. We
numerically model our experiment using the c-field methodology, allowing us to
estimate the parameters that maximise the performance of our sensor. We explore
the damping mechanisms underlying the observed phonon decay, and identify two
distinct Landau scattering processes that each dominate at different driving
amplitudes and temperatures. Our simulations reveal that $Q$ is limited by
strong damping of phonons even in the zero temperature limit. We perform an
experimental proof-of-principle rotation measurement using persistent currents
imprinted around the ring. We demonstrate a rotation sensitivity of up to
$\Delta \Omega \approx 0.3$ rad/s from a single image, with a theoretically
achievable value of $\Delta \Omega \approx 0.04$ rad/s in the atomic shot-noise
limit. This is a significant improvement over the shot-noise-limited $\Delta
\Omega \approx 1$ rad/s sensitivity obtained by Marti et al. [Phys. Rev. A 91,

The magnetic subsystem of nabokoite, KCu$_7$(TeO$_4$)(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl, is
constituted by buckled square kagome lattice of copper decorated by
quasi-isolated Cu$^{2+}$ ions. This combination determines peculiar physical
properties of this compound evidenced in electron spin resonance (ESR)
spectroscopy, dielectric permittivity $\varepsilon$, magnetization $M$ and
specific heat $C_p$ measurements. At lowering temperature, the magnetic
susceptibility $\chi = M/H$ passes through broad hump at about 150 K inherent
for low-dimensional magnetic systems and evidences sharp peak at
antiferromagnetic phase transition at $T_N = 3.2 $K. The $C_p(T)$ curve also
exhibits sharp peak at $T_N$ readily suppressed by magnetic field and
additional peak-like anomaly at $T_\textrm{peak}= 5.7$ K robust to magnetic
field. The latter can be ascribed to low-lying singlet excitations filling the
singlet-triplet gap in magnetic excitation spectrum of the square kagome
lattice [J.Richter, O.Derzhko and J.Schnack, Phys. Rev. B 105, 144427 (2022)].
According to position of $T_\textrm{peak}$, the leading exchange interaction
parameter $J$ in nabokoite is estimated to be about 60K. ESR spectroscopy
provides indications that antiferromagnetic structure below $T_N$ is
non-collinear. These complex thermodynamic and resonant properties signal the
presence of two weakly coupled magnetic subsystems in nabokoite, namely
spin-liquid with large singlet-triplet gap and antiferromagnet represented by
decorating ions. Separate issue is the observation of antiferroelectric-type
behavior in $\varepsilon$ at low temperatures, which tentatively reduces the
symmetry and partially lifts frustration of magnetic interactions of decorating
copper ions with buckled square kagome lattice.

A kagome lattice naturally features Dirac fermions, flat bands and van Hove
singularities in its electronic structure. The Dirac fermions encode topology,
flat bands favour correlated phenomena such as magnetism, and van Hove
singularities can lead to instabilities towards long-range many-body orders,
altogether allowing for the realization and discovery of a series of
topological kagome magnets and superconductors with exotic properties. Recent
progress in exploring kagome materials has revealed rich emergent phenomena
resulting from the quantum interactions between geometry, topology, spin and
correlation. Here we review these key developments in this field, starting from
the fundamental concepts of a kagome lattice, to the realizations of Chern and
Weyl topological magnetism, to various flat-band many-body correlations, and
then to the puzzles of unconventional charge-density waves and
superconductivity. We highlight the connection between theoretical ideas and
experimental observations, and the bond between quantum interactions within
kagome magnets and kagome superconductors, as well as their relation to the
concepts in topological insulators, topological superconductors, Weyl
semimetals and high-temperature superconductors. These developments broadly
bridge topological quantum physics and correlated many-body physics in a wide
range of bulk materials and substantially advance the frontier of topological
quantum matter.

<br>
<br>
We theoretically discuss the non-Hermitian superfluid phase transition in
one-dimensional two-component Fermi gases near the $p$-wave Feshbach resonance
accompanied by the two-body loss associated with the dipolar relaxation. For
the first time we point out that this system gives us an opportunity to explore
the interplay among various non-trivial properties such as universal
thermodynamics at divergent $p$-wave scattering length, topological phase
transition at vanishing chemical potential, and non-Hermitian
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer(BCS) to Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) transition, in
a unified manner. In the BCS phase, the loss-induced superfluid-normal
transition occurs when the exceptional point appears in the effective
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. In the BEC phase, the diffusive gapless mode can be
regarded as a precursor of the instability of the superfluid state. Moreover,
we show that the superfluid state is fragile against the two-body loss near the
topological phase transition point.

<h3>Anharmonic effects on the reflectivity of CaS and MgS: A  first-principles based study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11645" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11645</a>
<br>
<i>Artem Chmeruk, Maribel Núñez-Valdez</i>
<br>
<br>
We employ systematic calculations based on density functional theory to model
the reflectivity of CaS and MgS in the infrared region. We show that in
addition to the modeling using the harmonic approximation, an accurate spectral
description requires the inclusion of anharmonic effects. Due to their
conceptual simplicity, CaS and MgS are excellent systems for the explicit
consideration of the anharmonicity, which we include here using a perturbative
approach up to three-phonon scattering processes, and the consideration of
isotopic disorder. All physical quantities, such as Born effective charges and
dielectric constant, necessary for the calculation of the reflectivity within
the Lorentz model are extracted from our first-principles computations. To
validate our predicted optical and transversal modes, and reflectivity spectra,
we compare them to available experimental results. We find that the overall
agreement is good, which supports the importance of the inclusion of anharmonic
terms in the modeling of optical properties in the infrared region.

<h3>Integrability of two-species partially asymmetric exclusion processes</h3>

<br>
<i>Ivan Lobaskin, Martin R Evans, Kirone Mallick</i>
<br>
<br>
We classify all one-dimensional exclusion processes with two species of
particles that can be solved by a nested coordinate Bethe Ansatz. Using the
Yang-Baxter equations, we obtain conditions on the model parameters that ensure
that the underlying system is integrable. Three classes of integrable models
are thus found. Of these, two classes are well known in literature, but the
third has not been studied until recently, and never in the context of the
Bethe ansatz. The Bethe equations are derived for the latter model as well as
for the associated dynamics encoding the large deviation of the currents.

<h3>Polarized tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy at liquid He temperature in  ultrahigh vacuum using an off-axis parabolic mirror</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11655" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11655</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) combines inelastic light scattering
well below the diffraction limit down to the nanometer range and scanning probe
microscopy and, possibly, spectroscopy. In this way, topographic and
spectroscopic as well as single- and two-particle information may
simultaneously be collected. While single molecules can now be studied
successfully, bulk solids are still not meaningfully accessible. It is the
purpose of the work presented here to outline approaches toward this objective.
We describe a home-built, liquid helium cooled, ultrahigh vacuum tip-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy system (LHe-UHV-TERS). The setup is based on a scanning
tunneling microscope and, as an innovation, an off-axis parabolic mirror having
a high numerical aperture of approximately $0.85$ and a large working distance.
The system is equipped with a fast load-lock chamber, a chamber for the
\textit{in situ} preparation of tips, substrates, and samples, and a TERS
chamber. Base pressure and temperature in the TERS chamber were approximately
$3\times 10^{-11}$~mbar and 15~K, respectively. Polarization dependent
tip-enhanced Raman spectra of the vibration modes of carbon nanotubes were
successfully acquired at cryogenic temperature. Enhancement factors in the
range of $10^7$ were observed. The new features described here including very
low pressure and temperature and the external access to the light
polarizations, thus the selection rules, may pave the way towards the
investigation of bulk and surface materials.

<h3>The spin Hall effect</h3>

<br>
<i>Cosimo Gorini</i>
<br>
<br>
In metallic systems with spin-orbit coupling a longitudinal charge current
may generate a transverse pure spin current; vice-versa an injected pure spin
current may result in a transverse charge current. Such direct and inverse spin
Hall effects share the same microscopic origin: intrinsic band/device structure
properties, external factors such as impurities, or a combination of both. They
allow all-electrical manipulation of the electronic spin degrees of
freedom,i.e. without magnetic elements, and their transverse nature makes them
potentially dissipationless. It is customary to talk of spin Hall effects in
plural form, referring to a group of related phenomena typical of spin-orbit
coupled systems of lowered symmetry.

<h3>Resolving spin currents and spin densities generated by charge-spin  interconversion in systems with reduced crystal symmetry</h3>

<br>
<br>
The ability to control the generation of spins in arbitrary directions is a
long-sought goal in spintronics. Charge-to-spin interconversion (CSI) phenomena
depend strongly on symmetry. Systems with reduced crystal symmetry allow
anisotropic CSI with unconventional components, where charge and spin currents
and the spin polarization are not mutually perpendicular to each other. Here,
we demonstrate experimentally that the CSI in graphene-WTe2 induces spins with
components in all three spatial directions. By performing multi-terminal
nonlocal spin precession experiments, with specific magnetic field
orientations, we discuss how to disentangle the CSI from the spin Hall and
inverse spin galvanic effects.

<h3>Tunneling anisotropic spin galvanic effect</h3>

<br>
<i>Geneviève Fleury, Michael Barth, Cosimo Gorini</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that pure spin injection from a magnetic electrode into an inversion
symmetry-broken system composed of a tunnelling barrier and a metallic region
generates a transverse charge current. Such a tunnelling spin galvanic
conversion is non-local and may be strongly anisotropic even in linear
response, contrary to what happens in bulk conversion setups lacking tunnelling
elements. This is particularly relevant for spin-charge conversion at oxide
interfaces, where both the tunnel barrier and the receiving low-dimensional
metallic system host effective spin-orbit fields with complex angular
symmetries.

<h3>On the REM approximation of TAP free energies</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11718" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11718</a>
<br>
<i>Nicola Kistler, Marius Alexander Schmidt, Giulia Sebastiani</i>
<br>
<br>
The free energy of TAP-solutions for the SK-model of mean field spin glasses
can be expressed as a nonlinear functional of local terms: we exploit this
feature in order to contrive abstract REM-like models which we then solve by a
classical large deviations treatment. This allows to identify the origin of the
physically unsettling quadratic (in the inverse of temperature) correction to
the Parisi free energy for the SK-model, and formalizes the $\textit{true}$
cavity dynamics which acts on TAP-space, i.e. on the space of TAP-solutions.
From a non-spin glass point of view, this work is the first in a series of
refinements which addresses the stability of hierarchical structures in models
of evolving populations.

Hydrogels are widespread soft materials, which can serve a wide range of
applications. The control over the viscoelastic properties of the gel is of
paramount importance. Ongoing environmental issues have raised the consumer's
concern towards the use of more sustainable materials, including hydrogels.
However, are greener materials compatible with high functionality? In a
safe-by-design approach, this work demonstrates that functional hydrogels with
in situ responsivity of their elastic properties by external stimuli can be
developed from entirely ``sustainable'' components, a biobased amphiphile and
biopolymers (gelatin, chitosan and alginate). The bioamphiphile is a
stimuli-responsive glycolipid obtained by microbial fermentation, which can
self-assemble into fibers, but also micelles or vesicles, in water under high
dilution and by a rapid variation of the stimuli. The elastic properties of the
bioamphiphile/biopolymer interpenetrated hydrogels can be modulated by
selectively triggering the phase transition of the glycolipid and/or the
biopolymer inside the gel by mean of temperature or pH.

<h3>Adsorption-controlled plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy of LaInO3  on DyScO3(110): Growth window, strain relaxation, and domain pattern</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We report the growth of epitaxial LaInO3 on DyScO3(110) substrates by
adsorption-controlled plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PA-MBE). The
adsorption-controlled growth was monitored using line-of-sight quadrupole mass
spectrometry. In a thermodynamics of MBE (TOMBE) diagram, the experimental
growth window was found to be significantly narrower than the predicted one. We
found the critical thickness for strain relaxation of the LaInO3 layer (lattice
mismatch $\approx$ -4$\%$) to be of 1 nm using in-situ RHEED analysis.
Substrate and film possess an orthorhombic crystal structure which can be
approximated by a pseudo-cubic lattice. X-ray-diffraction (XRD) analysis
revealed the pseudo-cube-on-pseudo-cube epitaxial relationship ofthe LaInO3
films to the DyScO3 substrates. This relation was confirmed by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), which further resolved the presence of rotational
orthorhombic domains - the majority of which have coinciding c-axis with that
of the substrate. Raman spectroscopy further confirmed the presence of a LaInO3
layer. Our findings open up the possibility for 2-dimensional electron gases at
the MBE-grown heterointerface with BaSnO3.

<h3>Separability and entanglement of resonating valence-bond states</h3>

<br>
<i>Gilles Parez, Clément Berthiere, William Witczak-Krempa</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate separability and entanglement of Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) states
and resonating valence-bond (RVB) states. These states play a prominent role in
condensed matter physics, as they can describe quantum critical states of
matter and quantum spin liquids, depending on their underlying lattices. For
dimer RK states on arbitrary tileable graphs, we prove the exact separability
of the reduced density matrix of two disconnected subsystems, implying the
absence of entanglement between the two subsystems. For more general RK states
with local constraints, we argue separability in the thermodynamic limit, and
show that any local RK state has zero logarithmic negativity, even if the
density matrix is not exactly separable. In the case of adjacent subsystems, we
find an exact expression for the logarithmic negativity in terms of partition
functions of the underlying statistical model. For RVB states, we show
separability for disconnected subsystems up to exponentially small terms in the
distance $d$ between the two subsystems, and that the logarithmic negativity is
exponentially suppressed with $d$. We argue that separability does hold in the
scaling limit, even for arbitrarily small ratio $d/L$, where $L$ is the
characteristic size of the subsystems.

<h3>Amoeba formulation of the non-Hermitian skin effect in higher dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11743" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11743</a>
<br>
<i>Hong-Yi Wang, Fei Song, Zhong Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
The non-Hermitian skin effect dramatically reshapes the energy bands of
non-Hermitian systems, meaning that the usual Bloch band theory is
fundamentally inadequate as their characterization. The non-Bloch band theory,
in which the concept of Brillouin zone is generalized, has been widely applied
to investigate non-Hermitian systems in one spatial dimension. However, its
generalization to higher dimensions has been challenging. Here, we develop a
formulation of the non-Hermitian skin effect and non-Bloch band theory in
arbitrary spatial dimensions, which is based on a natural geometrical object
known as the amoeba. Our theory provides a general framework for studying
non-Hermitian bands beyond one dimension. Key quantities of non-Hermitian
bands, including the energy spectrum, eigenstates profiles, and the generalized
Brillouin zone, can be efficiently obtained from this approach.

<h3>Fractional transconductance via non-adiabatic topological Cooper pair  pumping</h3>

<br>
<br>
Many robust physical phenomena in quantum physics are based on topological
invariants arising due to intriguing geometrical properties of quantum states.
Prime examples are the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects that
demonstrate quantized Hall conductances, associated with topology both in the
single particle and the strongly correlated many-body limit. Interestingly, the
topology of the integer effect can be realized in superconducting multiterminal
systems, but a proposal for the more complex fractional counterpart is lacking.
In this work, we theoretically demonstrate how to achieve fractional quantized
transconductance in an engineered chain of Josephson junctions. Crucially,
similar to the stabilization of the conductance plateaus in Hall systems by
disorder, we obtain stable transconductance plateaus as a result of
non-adiabatic Landau-Zener transitions. We furthermore show that the fractional
plateaus are robust to disorder and study the optimal operation regime to
observe these effects. Our proposal paves the way for quantum simulation of
exotic many-body out-of-equilibrium states in Josephson junction systems.

<h3>State-and-rate friction in contact-line dynamics</h3>

<br>
<i>Chloe W. Lindeman, Sidney R. Nagel</i>
<br>
<br>
In order to probe the dynamics of contact-line motion, we study the
macroscopic properties of sessile drops deposited on and then aspirated from
carefully prepared horizontal surfaces. By measuring the contact angle and drop
width simultaneously during droplet removal, we determine the changes in the
shape of the drop as it depins and recedes. Our data indicate that there is a
force which opposes the motion of the contact line that depends both on the
amount of time that the drop has been in contact with the surface and on the
withdrawal rate. For water on silanized glass, we capture the experimentally
observed behavior with an overdamped dynamical model of contact-line motion in
which the phenomenological drag coefficient and the assumed equilibrium contact
angle are the only inputs. For other liquid/substrate pairs, the observed
contact-line motion suggests that a maximum static friction force is important
in addition to damping. The dependence on time of contact and withdrawal rate,
reminiscent of rate-and-state friction between solid surfaces, is qualitatively
consistent across three substrate-liquid pairs.

<h3>Phonon self-energy corrections: To screen, or not to screen</h3>

<br>
<i>Jan Berges, Nina Girotto, Tim Wehling, Nicola Marzari, Samuel Poncé</i>
<br>
<br>
First-principles calculations of phonons are often based on the adiabatic
approximation, and Brillouin-zone samplings that might not always be sufficient
to capture the subtleties of Kohn anomalies. These shortcomings can be
addressed through corrections to the phonon self-energy arising from the
low-energy electrons. A well-founded correction method exists [Phys. Rev. B 82,
165111 (2010)], which only relies on adiabatically screened quantities.
However, many-body theory suggests to use one bare electron-phonon vertex in
the phonon self-energy [Rev. Mod. Phys. 89, 015003 (2017)] to avoid double
counting. We assess the accuracy of both approaches in estimating the
low-temperature phonons of monolayer TaS$_2$ and doped MoS$_2$. We find that
the former yields excellent results at low computational cost due to its
designed error cancellation to first order, while the latter becomes exact in
the many-body limit but is not accurate in approximate contexts. We offer a
third strategy based on downfolding to partially screened phonons and
interactions [Phys. Rev. B 92, 245108 (2015)] to keep both advantages.

<br>
<br>
The fermion disorder operator is shown to reveal the entanglement information
in 1D Luttinger liquids and 2D free and interacting Fermi and non-Fermi liquids
emerging at quantum critical points(QCP). Here we study, by means of
large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, the scaling behavior of disorder
operator in correlated Dirac systems. We first demonstrate the logarithmic
scaling behavior of the disorder operator at the Gross-Neveu (GN) chiral Ising
and Heisenberg QCPs, where consistent conformal field theory (CFT) content of
the GN-QCP in its coefficient is found. Then we study a 2D monopole free
deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) realized between a quantum-spin Hall
insulator and a superconductor. Our data point to negative values of the
logarithmic coefficients such that the DQCP does not correspond to a unitary
CFT. Density matrix renormalization group calculations of the disorder operator
on a 1D DQCP model also detect emergent continuous symmetries.

Simulated configurations of flexible knotted rings confined inside a
spherical cavity are fed into long-short term memory neural networks (LSTM NNs)
designed to distinguish knot types. The results show that they perform well in
knot recognition even if tested against flexible, strongly confined and
therefore highly geometrically entangled rings. In agreement with the
expectation that knots are delocalized in dense polymers, a suitable
coarse-graining procedure on configurations boosts the performance of the LSTMs
when knot identification is applied to rings much longer than those used for
training. Notably, when the NNs fail, usually the wrong prediction still
belongs to the same topological family of the correct one. The fact that the
LSTMs are able to grasp some basic properties of the ring's topology is
corroborated by a test on knot types not used for training. We also show that
the choice of the NN architecture is important: simpler convolutional NNs do
not perform so well. Finally, all results depend on the features used for
input: surprisingly, coordinates or bond directions of the configurations
provide the best accuracy to the NNs, even if they are not invariant under
rotations (while the knot type is invariant). Other rotational invariant
features we tested are based on distances, angles, and dihedral angles.

<br>
<br>
During In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF), combining time-lapse contrast microscopy
with suitable image processing techniques could facilitate non-invasive
classification of oocyte health, driving oocyte selection to maximise success
rates. One image processing technique, Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM),
has been used in a variety of microscopy settings including bright field, dark
field and fluorescence. However, in some applications, effects stemming from
the choice of microscopy may invalidate underlying assumptions of DDM. Here, we
study the DDM analysis of differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy
movies. DIC exhibits a characteristic shadowing effect that gives the illusion
of a 3D appearance, which we show causes deformation of the output DDM matrix.
We present a mathematical description of this deformation, and conclude that,
when studying isotropic motion, no account of the DIC shadow needs to be
considered during DDM analysis. We validate our conclusions with simulated
particle data, and with DIC images of colloidal dispersions. Although this
conclusion does not generally extend to anisotropic motion, we demonstrate that
for directed advection and diffusion behaviour, parameter fitting invariance
still holds. These results validate the current practice of applying DDM to
DIC, and are a foundation for further exploration of DDM in other
phase-contrast image datasets.

<br>
<br>
The interaction between surface acoustic waves (SAWs) and spin waves (SWs) in
a piezoelectric/magnetic thin film heterostructure yields potential for the
realization of novel microwave devices and applications in magnonics. In the
present work, we investigate the SAW-SW interaction in a Pt/Co(2 nm)/Ru(0.85
nm)/Co(4 nm)/Pt synthetic antiferromagnet (SAF) composed of two ferromagnetic
layers with different thicknesses separated by a thin nonmagnetic Ru spacer
layer. Because of the combined presence of interfacial Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya
interaction (iDMI) and interlayer dipolar coupling fields, the optical SW mode
shows a large nondegenerate dispersion relation for oppositely propagating SWs.
Due to SAW-SW interaction, we observe nonreciprocal SAW transmission in the
piezoelectric/SAF hybrid device. The equilibrium magnetization directions of
both Co layers are manipulated by an external magnetic field to set a
ferromagnetic, canted, or antiferromagnetic configuration. This has a strong
impact on the SW dispersion, its nonreciprocity, and SAW-SW interaction. The
experimental results are in agreement with a phenomenological SAW-SW
interaction model, which considers the interlayer exchange coupling, iDMI, and
interlayer dipolar coupling fields of the SWs.

<br>
<br>
We present strong evidences for the deterministic role of magnetoelasticity
in ultrafast spin dynamics of ferromagnetic NixFe100-x alloy films. Without a
change in the crystal structure, we observed sudden Pi-phase inversion of the
spin precession in the range of x = 87.0 - 97.5. In addition, it was found that
the phase was continuously changed and reversed its sign by varying the pump
fluence. These cannot be explained simply by temperature dependence of
magnetocrystalline, demagnetizing, and Zeeman fields which have been
conventionally considered so far in describing the spin dynamics. Through the
temperature- and composition-dependent simulations adding the magnetoelastic
field generated from the lattice thermal strain, we revealed that the
conventional and magnetoelastic fields were competing around x = 95.3, where
the spin dynamics showed the largest phase shift. For analytic understanding,
we further show that the temperature-dependent interplay of the Curie
temperature, saturation magnetization, and magnetostriction, which are
demonstrated to be the most important macroscopic parameters, determines the
ultrafast spin dynamics. Our extensive study emphasizes that magnetoelasticity
is the key ingredient for fully understanding the driving mechanism of
ultrafast spin dynamics.

<br>
The discovery of novel materials drives industrial innovation, although the
pace of discovery tends to be slow due to the infrequency of "Eureka!" moments.
These moments are typically tangential to the original target of the
experimental work: "accidental discoveries". Here we demonstrate the
acceleration of intentional materials discovery - targeting material properties
of interest while generalizing the search to a large materials space with
machine learning (ML) methods. We demonstrate a closed-loop ML discovery
process targeting novel superconducting materials, which have industrial
applications ranging from quantum computing to sensors to power delivery. By
closing the loop, i.e. by experimentally testing the results of the
ML-generated superconductivity predictions and feeding data back into the ML
model to refine, we demonstrate that success rates for superconductor discovery
can be more than doubled. In four closed-loop cycles, we discovered a new
superconductor in the Zr-In-Ni system, re-discovered five superconductors
unknown in the training datasets, and identified two additional phase diagrams
of interest for new superconducting materials. Our work demonstrates the
critical role experimental feedback provides in ML-driven discovery, and
provides definite evidence that such technologies can accelerate discovery even
in the absence of knowledge of the underlying physics.

Three-particle correlators are relevant for, among others, Raman, Hall and
non-linear responses. They are also required for the next order of
approximations extending dynamical mean-field theory diagrammatically. We
present a general formalism on how to treat these three-particle correlators
and susceptibilities, and calculate the local three-particle response of the
Anderson impurity model numerically. We find that genuine three-particle vertex
corrections are sizable. In particular, it is not sufficient to just take the
bare bubble terms or corrections based on the two-particle vertex. The full
three-particle vertex must be considered.

<br>
Low magnetic damping and high group velocity of spin waves (SWs) or magnons
are two crucial parameters for functional magnonic devices. Magnonics research
on signal processing and wave-based computation at GHz frequencies focussed on
the artificial ferrimagnetic garnet Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (YIG) so far. We report
on spin-wave spectroscopy studies performed on the natural mineral hematite
($\alpha\text{-Fe}_2\text{O}_3$) which is a canted antiferromagnet. By means of
broadband GHz spectroscopy and inelastic light scattering, we determine a
damping coefficient of $1.1\times10^{-5}$ and magnon group velocities of a few
10 km/s, respectively, at room temperature. Covering a large regime of wave
vectors up to $k\approx 24~{\rm rad}/\mu$m, we find the exchange stiffness
length to be relatively short and only about 1 \r{A}. In a small magnetic field
of 30 mT, the decay length of SWs is estimated to be 1.1 cm similar to the best
YIG. Still, inelastic light scattering provides surprisingly broad and partly
asymmetric resonance peaks. Their characteristic shape is induced by the large
group velocities, low damping and distribution of incident angles inside the
laser beam. Our results promote hematite as an alternative and sustainable
basis for magnonic devices with fast speeds and low losses. It particularly
avoids the lead-based synthesis route for high-quality wafer-scale YIG.

Moir\'{e} twist angle underpins the interlayer interaction of excitons in
twisted van der Waals hetero- and homo-structures. The influence of twist angle
on the excitonic absorption of twisted bilayer tungsten diselenide (WSe$_{2}$)
has been investigated using electron energy-loss spectroscopy.
Atomic-resolution imaging by scanning transmission electron microscopy was used
to determine key structural parameters, including the nanoscale measurement of
the relative twist angle and stacking order. Detailed spectral analysis
revealed a pronounced blueshift in the high-energy excitonic peak C with
increasing twist angle, up to 200 meV when compared to the AA$^{\prime}$
stacking. The experimental findings have been discussed relative to
first-principle calculations of the dielectric response of the AA$^{\prime}$
stacked bilayer WSe$_{2}$ as compared to monolayer WSe$_{2}$ by employing the
\textit{GW} plus Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) approaches, resolving the origin
of higher energy spectral features from ensembles of excitonic transitions, and
thus any discrepancies between previous calculations. Furthermore, the
electronic structure of moir\'{e} supercells spanning twist angles of
$\sim$9.5-46.5$^{\circ}$ calculated by density functional theory (DFT) were
unfolded, showing an uplifting of the conduction band minimum near the $Q$
point and minimal change in the upper valence band concurrently. The combined
experiment/theory investigation provides valuable insight into the physical
origins of high-energy absorption resonances in twisted bilayers, which enables
to track the evolution of interlayer coupling from tuning of the exciton C
transitions by absorption spectroscopy.

<h3>Generating soliton trains through Floquet engineering</h3>

We study a gas of interacting ultracold bosons held in a parabolic trap in
the presence of an optical lattice potential. Treating the system as a
discretised Gross-Pitaevskii model, we show how Floquet engineering, by rapidly
``shaking'' the lattice, allows the ground-state of the system to be converted
into a train of bright solitons by inverting the sign of the hopping energy. We
study how the number of solitons produced depends on the system's nonlinearity
and the curvature of the trap, show how the technique can be applied both in
the high and low driving-frequency regimes, and demonstrate the phenomenon's
stability against noise. We conclude that the Floquet approach is a useful and
stable method of preparing solitons in cold atom systems.

<h3>A new efficient ab-initio approach for calculating the bending stiffness  of 2D materials</h3>

This work proposes a new efficient approach for calculating the bending
stiffness of two-dimensional materials using simple atomistic tests on small
periodic unit cells. The tests are designed such that bending deformations are
dominating and membrane deformations are minimized. Atomistic ab-initio
simulations then allow for the efficient computation of bending energies.
Density functional theory is used for this. Atomistic bending energies are then
compared to classical models from structural mechanics. Two different models
are considered for this -- one based on beam theory and one based on rigid
linkage theory -- and their results are compared with each other. Four
different materials with 2D hexagonal (honeycomb) structure are chosen as a
case study: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, silicene, and blue phosphorene.
The calculated bending stiffnesses converge with increasing unit cell size,
such that small unit cells already provide accurate results that are in good
agreement with the literature. Using the same atomistic tests, it is shown that
the bending stiffness of graphene can still be considered constant at
moderately large deformations. Apart from being efficient and accurate, the
proposed approach allows for various extensions.

<h3>Majorana Scars as Group Singlets</h3>

In some quantum many-body systems, the Hilbert space breaks up into a large
ergodic sector and a much smaller scar subspace. It has been suggested
[arXiv:2007.00845] that the two sectors may be distinguished by their
transformation properties under a large group whose rank grows with the system
size (it is not a symmetry of the Hamiltonian). The quantum many-body scars are
invariant under this group, while all other states are not. Here we apply this
idea to lattice systems with $N$ sites that contain $M$ Majorana fermions per
site. The Hilbert space may be decomposed under the action of the
${\text{SO}}(N)\times {\text{SO}}(M)$ group, and the scars are the $
{\text{SO}}(N)$ singlets. For any even $M$ there are two families of scars. One
of them, which we call the $\eta$ states, is symmetric under the group O$(N)$
that includes a reflection. The other, the $\zeta$ states, has the $
{\text{SO}}(N)$ invariance only. For $M=4$, where our construction reduces to a
deformed $ {\text{SU}}(2)$ Hubbard chain with local interactions, the former
family are the $N+1$ $\eta$-pairing states, while the latter are the $N+1$
states of maximum spin. We generalize this construction to $M>4$. For $M=6$ we
exhibit explicit formulae for the scar states and use them to calculate the
bipartite entanglement entropy analytically. For large $N$, it grows
logarithmically with the region size. In general, the energies of the scars
within each family are not equidistant. For $M>6$ we also find that the scars
will local Hamiltonians typically have certain degeneracies.

Cryogenic semiconductor device models are instrumental in designing control
systems for quantum devices and in benchmarking the benefits of cryogenic
cooling for high-performance computing. In particular, the saturation of
subthreshold swing due to band tails is an important phenomenon to include in
low-temperature analytical MOSFET models as it predicts theoretical lower
bounds on the leakage power and supply voltage in tailored cryogenic CMOS
technologies with tuned threshold voltages. Previous physics-based modeling
required to evaluate functions with no closed-form solutions, defeating the
purpose of fast and efficient model evaluation. Thus far, only the empirically
proposed expressions are in closed form. This article bridges this gap by
deriving a physics-based and closed-form model for the full saturating trend of
the subthreshold swing from room down to low temperature. The proposed model is
compared against experimental data taken on long nMOS and pMOS devices from a
commercial 28-nm bulk CMOS technology from 300 down to 4.2 K.

<h3>A Coarse-Grained Simulation Model for Self-Assembly of Liquid Droplets  Featuring Explicit Mobile Binders</h3>

Colloidal particles with mobile binding moities constitute a powerful
platform for probing the physics of self-assembly, because the valence of the
particles arises naturally depending on the number of available neighbors. This
has been realized experimentally with DNA-coated oil emulsion droplets, where
it has been shown that valence control can be tuned through the concentration
of DNA on the surface as well as the strength of the binding or unbinding
interactions. Moreover, chains of these droplets termed `colloidomers' can be
used to probe the physics of polymer folding. Here, we present a coarse-grain
(CG) molecular dynamics simulation model to study the self-assembly of this
class of systems using explicit representations of mobile binding sites. Using
this model, we explore how valence and assembled structures can be tuned both
with these thermodynamic factors, as well as through kinetic control in the
strong binding limit. As example uses of our framework, we show that we can
determine principles that allow us to optimize conditions in which colloidomer
chains are preferred, and our model exhibits folding behavior of colloidomers
commensurate with recent work on this topic. A crucial element of our
simulation framework is a model for dynamic binding and unbinding where
kinetics are tunable, and can depend on external factors such as temperature.
This dynamic binding is implemented as an open-source custom plugin to
HOOMD-Blue which allows us to study our model on relatively large scales. Our
CG platform lays the groundwork for future studies of this class of systems,
including pathways for colloidomer folding, and the mechanical factors
governing binding patch size, both of which have been explored in recent
experimental studies.

<h3>Nonlinear perturbation of Random Matrix Theory</h3>

We consider a system of linear oscillators, or quantum states, described by
Random Matrix Theory and analyze how its time evolution is affected by a
nonlinear perturbation. Our numerical results show that above a certain chaos
border a weak or moderate nonlinearity leads to a dynamical thermalization of a
finite number of degrees of freedom with energy equipartition over linear
eigenmodes as expected from the laws of classical statistical mechanics. The
system temperature is shown to change in a broad range from positive to
negative values and the dependence of system characteristics on the initial
injected energy is determined. Below the chaos border the dynamics is described
by the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser integrability. Due to universal features of
Random Matrix Theory we argue that the obtained results describe the generic
properties of its nonlinear perturbation.

<h3>Structure of Charge Density Waves in La1.875Ba0.125CuO4</h3>

Although charge-density wave (CDW) correlations exist in several families of
cuprate superconductors, they exhibit substantial variation in CDW wavevector
and correlation length, indicating a key role for CDW-lattice interactions. We
investigated this interaction in La1.875Ba0.125CuO4 using single crystal x-ray
diffraction to collect a large number of CDW peak intensities, and determined
the Cu and La/Ba atomic distortions induced by the formation of CDW order.
Within the CuO2 planes, the distortions involve a sinusoidal modulation of the
Cu-Cu spacing along the direction of the ordering wave vector. The charge
ordering within the copper-oxygen layer induces an out-ofplane breathing
modulation of the surrounding lanthanum layers, which leads to a related
distortion on the adjacent copper-oxygen layer. Our result implies that the
CDW-related structural distortions do not remain confined to a single layer but
rather propagate an appreciable distance through the crystal. This leads to
overlapping structural modulations, in which CuO2 planes exhibit distortions
arising from the orthogonal CDWs in adjacent layers as well as distortions from
the CDW within the layer itself. We attribute this striking effect to the weak
c-axis charge screening in cuprates and suggest this effect could help couple
the CDW between adjacent planes in the crystal.

<h3>Tangent Space Approach for Thermal Tensor Network Simulations of 2D  Hubbard Model</h3>

Accurate simulations of the two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model constitute one
of the most challenging problems in condensed matter and quantum physics. Here
we develop a tangent space tensor renormalization group ($tan$TRG) approach for
the calculations of 2D Hubbard model at finite temperature. An optimal
evolution of density operator is achieved in $tan$TRG with a mild $O(D^3)$
complexity, where the bond dimension $D$ controls the accuracy. With $tan$TRG
we boost the low-temperature calculations of large-scale 2D Hubbard systems on
up to width-8 cylinder and $10\times10$ square lattice. For the half-filled
Hubbard model, the obtained results are in excellent agreement with those of
determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC). Moreover, $tan$TRG can be used to
explore the low-temperature, finite-doping regime inaccessible for DQMC. The
calculated charge compressibility and Matsubara Green's function are found to
reflect the strange metal and pseudogap behaviors, respectively. The
superconductive pairing susceptibility is computed down to a low temperature of
approximately $1/24$ of the hoping energy, where we find $d$-wave pairing
responses are most significant near the optimal doping. Equipped with the
tangent-space technique, $tan$TRG constitutes a well-controlled, highly
efficient and accurate tensor network method for strongly correlated 2D lattice
models at finite temperature.

In quantum gas microscopy experiments, reconstructing the site-resolved
lattice occupation with high fidelity is essential for the accurate extraction
of physical observables. For short interatomic separations and limited
signal-to-noise ratio, this task becomes increasingly challenging. Common
methods rapidly decline in performance as the lattice spacing is decreased
below half the imaging resolution. Here, we present a novel algorithm based on
deep convolutional neural networks to reconstruct the site-resolved lattice
occupation with high fidelity. The algorithm can be directly trained in an
unsupervised fashion with experimental fluorescence images and allows for a
fast reconstruction of large images containing several thousand lattice sites.
We benchmark its performance using a quantum gas microscope with cesium atoms
that utilizes short-spaced optical lattices with lattice constant $383.5\,$nm
and a typical Rayleigh resolution of $850\,$nm. We obtain promising
reconstruction fidelities~$\gtrsim 96\%$ across all fillings based on a
statistical analysis. We anticipate this algorithm to enable novel experiments
with shorter lattice spacing, boost the readout fidelity and speed of
lower-resolution imaging systems, and furthermore find application in related
experiments such as trapped ions.
