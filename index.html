<h3>Chiral Symmetry Restoration and the Ultraquantum limit of Axionic Charge  Density Waves in Weyl Semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07644" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07644</a>
<br>
<i>Joan Bernabeu, Alberto Cortijo</i>
<p>A new mechanism for chiral symmetry restoration at extreme high magnetic
fields is proposed in the context of the Magnetic Catalysis scenario in Weyl
Semimetals. Contrary to previous proposals, here we show that, at very large
magnetic fields, the transverse velocity of the axion field, the phase mode of
the chiral condensate $\langle\bar{\psi}\psi\rangle$, becomes effectively
one-dimensional and its fluctuations destroy a possible nonzero value of this
fermionic condensate. We also show that, despite of the $U(1)$ chiral symmetry
is not broken at extremely large magnetic fields, the spectrum of the system is
comprised by a well defined gapless bosonic excitation, connected to the axion
mode, and a correlated insulating fermionic liquid that is neutral to $U(1)$
chiral transformations. We also discuss some consequences of this theory that
can be contrasted to experiments.

<br>
<i>Jonas B. Hauck, Dante M. Kennes, Lennart Klebl</i>
<p>We present divERGe, an open source, high-performance C/C++/Python library for
functional renormalization group (FRG) calculations on lattice fermions. The
versatile model interface is tailored to real materials applications and
seamlessly integrates with existing, standard tools from the ab-initio
community. The code fully supports multi-site, multi-orbital, and non-SU(2)
models in all of the three included FRG variants: TU$^2$FRG, N-patch FRG, and
grid FRG. With this, the divERGe library paves the way for widespread
application of FRG as a tool in the study of competing orders in quantum
materials.

<h3>Dissipation-induced long-range order in the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard  model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07683" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07683</a>
<br>
<i>Afonso L. S. Ribeiro, Paul McClarty, Pedro Ribeiro, Manuel Weber</i>
<p>Understanding the stability of strongly correlated phases of matter when
coupled to environmental degrees of freedom is crucial for identifying the
conditions under which these states may be observed. Here, we focus on the
paradigmatic one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, and study the stability of the
Luttinger liquid and Mott insulating phases in the presence of local particle
exchange with site-independent baths of non-interacting bosons. We perform a
numerically exact analysis of this model by adapting the recently developed
wormhole quantum Monte Carlo method for retarded interactions to a
continuous-time formulation with worm updates; we show how the wormhole updates
can be easily implemented in this scheme. For an Ohmic bath, our numerical
findings confirm the scaling prediction that the Luttinger-liquid phase becomes
unstable at infinitesimal bath coupling. We show that the ensuing phase is a
long-range ordered superfluid with spontaneously-broken U(1) symmetry. While
the Mott insulator remains a distinct phase for small bath coupling, it
exhibits diverging compressibility and non-integer local boson occupation in
the thermodynamic limit. Upon increasing the bath coupling, this phase
undergoes a transition to a long-range ordered superfluid. Finally, we discuss
the effects of super-Ohmic dissipation on the Luttinger-liquid phase. Our
results are compatible with a stable dissipative Luttinger-liquid phase that
transitions to a long-range ordered superfluid at a finite system-bath
coupling.

<h3>Correlated volumes for extended wavefunctions on a random-regular graph</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07690" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07690</a>
<br>
<i>Manuel Pino, Jose E. Roman</i>
<p>We analyze the ergodic properties of a metallic wavefunction for the Anderson
model in a disordered random-regular graph with branching number $k=2.$ A few
q-moments $I_q$ associated with the zero energy eigenvector are numerically
computed up to sizes $N=4\times 10^6.$ We extract their corresponding fractal
dimensions $D_q$ in the thermodynamic limit together with correlated volumes
$N_q$ that control finite-size effects. At intermediate values of disorder $W,$
we obtain ergodicity $D_q=1$ for $q=1,2$ and correlation volumes that increase
fast upon approaching the Anderson transition $\log(\log(N_q))\sim W.$ We then
focus on the extraction of the volume $N_0$ associated with the typical value
of the wavefunction $e^{<\log|\psi|^2>},$ which follows a similar tendency as
the ones for $N_1$ or $N_2.$ Its value at intermediate disorders is close, but
smaller, to the so-called ergodic volume previously found via the
super-symmetric formalism and belief propagator algorithms. None of the
computed correlated volumes shows a tendency to diverge up to disorders
$W\approx 15$, specifically none with exponent $\nu=1/2$. Deeper in the metal,
we characterize the crossover to system sizes much smaller than the first
correlated volume $N_1\gg N.$ Once this crossover has taken place, we obtain
evidence of a scaling in which the derivative of the first fractal dimension
$D_1$ behaves critically with an exponent $\nu=1.$

<h3>Nematic superconductivity from selective orbital pairing in  Ba(Fe1-xMx)2As2 (M = Co, Ni) single crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07697" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07697</a>
<br>
<i>Mason Klemm, Shirin Mozaffari, Rui Zhang, Brian W. Casas, Alexei E. Koshelev, Ming Yi, Luis Balicas, Pengcheng Dai</i>
<p>We use transport measurements to determine the in-plane anisotropy of the
upper critical field Hc2 in detwinned superconducting Ba(Fe1-xMx)2As2 (M = Co,
Ni) single crystals. In previous measurements on twinned single crystals, the
charge carrier doping dependence (x) of the upper critical field anisotropy for
fields along the inter-planar (c-axis) and in-plane field directions was found
to increase in the overdoped regime. For underdoped samples, which exhibit a
spin nematic phase below the tetragonal to orthorhombic structural transition
temperature Ts , we find that Hc2 along the a-axis is considerably lower than
that along the b-axis. The upper critical field anisotropy disappears in the
over-doped regime when the system becomes tetragonal. By combining these
results with inelastic neutron scattering studies of spin excitations, and
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we conclude that superconductivity
in under-doped iron pnictides is orbital selective - with a dominant
contribution from electrons with the dyz orbital character and being intimately
associated with spin excitations.

<h3>Coarse-grained modelling of DNA-RNA hybrids</h3>

<br>
<i>Eryk J. Ratajczyk, Petr Šulc, Andrew J. Turberfield, Jonathan P.K. Doye, Ard A. Louis</i>
<p>We introduce oxNA, a new model for the simulation of DNA-RNA hybrids which is
based on two previously developed coarse-grained models$\unicode{x2014}$oxDNA
and oxRNA. The model naturally reproduces the physical properties of hybrid
duplexes including their structure, persistence length and force-extension
characteristics. By parameterising the DNA-RNA hydrogen bonding interaction we
fit the model's thermodynamic properties to experimental data using both
average-sequence and sequence-dependent parameters. To demonstrate the model's
applicability we provide three examples of its use$\unicode{x2014}$calculating
the free energy profiles of hybrid strand displacement reactions, studying the
resolution of a short R-loop and simulating RNA-scaffolded wireframe origami.

<h3>Polyurea-Graphene Nanocomposites -- the Influence of Hard-Segment  Content and Nanoparticle Loading on Mechanical Properties</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07721" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07721</a>
<br>
<i>Demetrios A. Tzelepis, Arman Khoshnevis, Mohsen Zayernouri, Valeriy V. Ginzburg</i>
<p>Polyurethane and polyurea-based adhesives are widely used in various
applications, from automotive to electronics to medical. The adhesive
performance depends strongly on its composition, and developing the
formulation-structure-property relationship is crucial to making better
products. Here, we investigate the dependence of the linear viscoelastic
properties of polyurea nanocomposites, with IPDI-based polyurea (PUa) matrix
and exfoliated graphene nanoplatelet (xGnP) fillers, on the hard segment weight
fraction (HSWF) and the xGnP loading. We characterize the material using
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and dynamical mechanical analysis (DMA). It
is found that changing HSWF leads to a significant variation in the stiffness
of the material, from about 10 MPa for the 20% HSWF to about 100 MPa for the
30% HSWF to about 250 MPa for the 40% HSWF polymer (as measured by the tensile
storage modulus at room temperature). The effect of the xGNP loading is
significantly more limited and is generally within experimental error, except
for the 20% HSWF material where the xGNP addition leads to about 80% increase
in stiffness. To correctly interpret the DMA results, we developed a new
physics-based rheological model for the description of the storage and loss
moduli. The model is based on the fractional calculus approach and successfully
describes the material rheology in a broad range of temperatures (-70{\deg}C to
+70{\deg}C) and frequencies (0.1 to 100 s-1), using only six physically
meaningful fitting parameters for each material. The results provide guidance
for the development of nanocomposite PUa-based materials.

<h3>Ab initio amorphous spin Hamiltonian for the description of topological  spin textures in FeGe</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07725" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07725</a>
<br>
<i>Temuujin Bayaraa, Sinéad M. Griffin</i>
<p>Topological spin textures in magnetic materials such as skyrmions and
hopfions are interesting manifestations of geometric structures in real
materials, concurrently having potential applications as information carriers.
In the crystalline systems, the formation of these topological spin textures is
well understood as a result of the competition between interactions due to
symmetry breaking and frustration. However, in systems without translation
symmetry such as amorphous materials, a fundamental understanding of the
driving mechanisms of non-trivial spin structures is lacking owing to the
structural and interaction complexity in these systems. In this work, we use a
suite of first-principles-based calculations to propose an ab initio spin
Hamiltonian that accurately represents the diversity of structural and magnetic
properties in the exemplar amorphous FeGe. Monte Carlo simulations of our
amorphous Hamiltonian find emergent skyrmions that are driven by frustrated
geometric and magnetic exchange, consistent with those observed in experiment.
Moreover, we find that the diversity of local structural motifs results in a
large range of exchange interactions, far beyond those found in crystalline
materials. Finally, we observe the formation of large-scale emergent structures
in amorphous materials, far beyond the relevant interaction length-scale in the
systems, suggesting a new route to emergent correlated phases beyond the
crystalline limit.

<h3>Magnetic-coupled electronic landscape in bilayer-distorted  titanium-based kagome metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07747" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07747</a>
<br>
<i>Yong Hu, Congcong Le, Long Chen, Hanbin Deng, Ying Zhou, Nicholas C. Plumb, Milan Radovic, Ronny Thomale, Andreas P. Schnyder, Jia-Xin Yin, Gang Wang, Xianxin Wu, Ming Shi</i>
<p>Quantum materials whose atoms are arranged on a lattice of corner-sharing
triangles, $\textit{i.e.}$, the kagome lattice, have recently emerged as a
captivating platform for investigating exotic correlated and topological
electronic phenomena. Here, we combine ultra-low temperature angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with scanning tunneling microscopy and
density functional theory calculations to reveal the fascinating electronic
structure of the bilayer-distorted kagome material
$\textit{Ln}$Ti${_3}$Bi${_4}$, where $\textit{Ln}$ stands for Nd and Yb.
Distinct from other kagome materials, $\textit{Ln}$Ti${_3}$Bi${_4}$ exhibits
two-fold, rather than six-fold, symmetries, stemming from the distorted kagome
lattice, which leads to a unique electronic structure. Combining experiment and
theory we map out the electronic structure and discover double flat bands as
well as multiple van Hove singularities (VHSs), with one VHS exhibiting
higher-order characteristics near the Fermi level. Notably, in the magnetic
version NdTi${_3}$Bi${_4}$, the ultra-low base temperature ARPES measurements
unveil an unconventional band splitting in the band dispersions which is
induced by the ferromagnetic ordering. These findings reveal the potential of
bilayer-distorted kagome metals $\textit{Ln}$Ti${_3}$Bi${_4}$ as a promising
platform for exploring novel emergent phases of matter at the intersection of
strong correlation and magnetism.

<h3>Control of the nonlinear frequency shift for the spin-transfer  nanooscillator using a bias magnetic field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07757" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07757</a>
<br>
<i>A.A Matveev, A.R. Safin, S.A. Nikitov</i>
<p>We investigated the possibilities of controlling the nonlinear frequency
shift of the magnetization oscillations in a spin-transfer nanoscillator by
varying the magnitude and direction of the bias magnetic field. We considered
both isotropic ferromagnetic materials and crystals with uniaxial and cubic
crystallographic anisotropies. We have shown that achieving a zero nonlinear
frequency shift is possible with a certain orientation of the bias magnetic
field vector. The results of the theoretical analysis based on the method of
Hamiltonian formalism are in good agreement with the micromagnetic simulations.
Our research reveals the way to control the frequency tuning of a spin transfer
nanoscillator, which is crucial for spintronic signal generation devices.

<h3>Fracture of bio-cemented sands</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07785" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07785</a>
<br>
<i>C. Konstantinou, E. Martínez-Pañeda, G. Biscontin, N.A. Fleck</i>
<p>Bio-chemical reactions enable the production of biomimetic materials such as
sandstones. In the present study, microbiologically-induced calcium carbonate
precipitation (MICP) is used to manufacture laboratory-scale specimens for
fracture toughness measurement. The mode I and mixed-mode fracture toughnesses
are measured as a function of cementation, and are correlated with strength,
permeability and porosity. A micromechanical model is developed to predict the
dependence of mode I fracture toughness upon the degree of cementation. In
addition, the role of the crack tip $T$-stress in dictating kink angle and
toughness is determined for mixed mode loading. At a sufficiently low degree of
cementation, the zone of microcracking in the vicinity of the crack tip is
sufficiently large for a crack tip $K$-field to cease to exist and for crack
kinking theory to not apply. The interplay between cementation and fracture
properties of sedimentary rocks is explained; this understanding underpins a
wide range of rock fracture phenomena including hydraulic fracture.

<h3>Hybrid Synaptic Structure for Spiking Neural Network Realization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07787" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07787</a>
<br>
<i>Sasan Razmkhah, Mustafa Altay Karamuftuoglu, Ali Bozbey</i>
<p>Neural networks and neuromorphic computing play pivotal roles in deep
learning and machine vision. Due to their dissipative nature and inherent
limitations, traditional semiconductor-based circuits face challenges in
realizing ultra-fast and low-power neural networks. However, the spiking
behavior characteristic of single flux quantum (SFQ) circuits positions them as
promising candidates for spiking neural networks (SNNs). Our previous work
showcased a JJ-Soma design capable of operating at tens of gigahertz while
consuming only a fraction of the power compared to traditional circuits, as
documented in [1]. This paper introduces a compact SFQ-based synapse design
that applies positive and negative weighted inputs to the JJ-Soma. Using an
RSFQ synapse empowers us to replicate the functionality of a biological neuron,
a crucial step in realizing a complete SNN. The JJ-Synapse can operate at
ultra-high frequencies, exhibits orders of magnitude lower power consumption
than CMOS counterparts, and can be conveniently fabricated using commercial Nb
processes. Furthermore, the network's flexibility enables modifications by
incorporating cryo-CMOS circuits for weight value adjustments. In our endeavor,
we have successfully designed, fabricated, and partially tested the JJ-Synapse
within our cryocooler system. Integration with the JJ-Soma further facilitates
the realization of a high-speed inference SNN.

<h3>Deconstructing Magnetization Noise: Degeneracies, Phases, and Mobile  Fractionalized Excitations in Tetris Artificial Spin Ice</h3>

<br>
<i>M. Goryca, X. Zhang, J. Ramberger, J. D. Watts, C. Nisoli, C. Leighton, P. Schiffer, S. A. Crooker</i>
<p>Direct detection of spontaneous spin fluctuations, or "magnetization noise",
is emerging as a powerful means of revealing and studying magnetic excitations
in both natural and artificial frustrated magnets. Depending on the lattice and
nature of the frustration, these excitations can often be described as
fractionalized quasiparticles possessing an effective magnetic charge. Here, by
combining ultrasensitive optical detection of thermodynamic magnetization noise
with Monte Carlo simulations, we reveal emergent regimes of magnetic
excitations in artificial "tetris ice". A marked increase of the intrinsic
noise at certain applied magnetic fields heralds the spontaneous proliferation
of fractionalized excitations, which can diffuse independently, without cost in
energy, along specific quasi-1D spin chains in the tetris ice lattice.

<i>Xinyuan Lai, Daniele Guerci, Guohong Li, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Justin Wilson, Jedediah H. Pixley, Eva Y. Andrei</i>
<p>Using scanning-tunneling-microscopy and theoretical modeling on
heterostructures of twisted bilayer graphene and hexagonal Boron-Nitride, we
show that the emergent super-moire structures display a rich landscape of
moire-crystals and quasicrystals. We reveal a phase-diagram comprised of
commensurate moire-crystals embedded in swaths of moire quasicrystals. The 1:1
commensurate crystal, expected to be a Chern insulator, should only exist at
one point on the phase-diagram, implying that it ought to be practically
undetectable. Surprisingly we find that the commensurate crystals exist over a
much wider than predicted range, providing evidence of an unexpected
self-alignment mechanism that is explained using an elastic-network model. The
remainder of the phase-diagram, where we observe tunable quasicrystals, affords
a new platform for exploring the unique electronic-properties of these rarely
found in nature structures.

<h3>Machine learning analysis of dimensional reduction conjecture for  nonequilibrium Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in three dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07828" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07828</a>
<br>
<i>Taiki Haga</i>
<p>We investigate the recently proposed dimensional reduction conjecture in
driven disordered systems using a machine learning technique. The conjecture
states that a static snapshot of a disordered system driven at a constant
velocity is equal to a space-time trajectory of its lower-dimensional pure
counterpart. This suggests that the three-dimensional random field XY model
exhibits the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition when driven out of
equilibrium. To verify the conjecture directly by observing configurations of
the system, we utilize the capacity of neural networks to detect subtle
features of images. Specifically, we train a convolutional neural network to
differentiate snapshots of the three-dimensional driven random field XY model
from space-time trajectories of the two-dimensional pure XY model. Our results
demonstrate that the network cannot distinguish between the two, confirming the
dimensional reduction conjecture.

<h3>Challenges in molecular dynamics simulations of heat exchange statistics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07830" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07830</a>
<br>
<i>Jonathan J. Wang, Matthew Gerry, Dvira Segal</i>
<p>We study heat exchange in temperature-biased metal-molecule-metal molecular
junctions by employing the LAMMPS atomic molecular dynamics simulator.
Generating the nonequilibrium steady state with Langevin thermostats at the
boundaries of the junction, we show that the {\it average} heat current across
a gold-alkanedithiol-gold nanojunction behaves correctly-physically, with the
thermal conductance value matching the literature. In contrast, the {\it full
probability distribution function} for heat exchange, as generated by the
simulator, violates the fundamental fluctuation symmetry for entropy
production. We trace this failure back to the implementation of the thermostats
and the expression used to calculate the heat exchange. To rectify this issue
and produce the correct statistics, we introduce single-atom thermostats as an
alternative to conventional many-atom thermostats. Once averaging heat exchange
over the hot and cold thermostats, this approach successfully generates the
correct probability distribution function, which we use to study the behavior
of both the average heat current and its noise. We further examine the
thermodynamic uncertainty relation in the molecular junction and show that it
holds, albeit demonstrating nontrivial trends. Our study points to the need to
carefully implement nonequilibrium molecular dynamics solvers in atomistic
simulation software tools for future investigations of noise phenomena in
thermal transport.

<h3>Neural integration for constitutive equations using small data</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07849" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07849</a>
<br>
<i>Filippo Masi, Itai Einav</i>
<p>Data-driven models based on deep learning algorithms intend to overcome the
limitations of traditional constitutive modelling by directly learning from
data. However, the need for extensive data that collate the full state of the
material is hindered by traditional experimental observations, which typically
provide only small data - sparse and partial material state observations. To
address this issue, we develop a novel deep learning algorithm referred to as
Neural Integration for Constitutive Equations to discover constitutive models
at the material point level from scarce and incomplete observations. It builds
upon the solution of the initial value problem describing the time evolution of
the material state, unlike the majority of data-driven approaches for
constitutive modelling that require large data of increments of state
variables. Numerical benchmarks demonstrate that the method can learn accurate,
consistent, and robust constitutive models from incomplete, sparse, and noisy
data collecting simple conventional experimental protocols.

<h3>Topological and spectral properties of random digraphs</h3>

<br>
<i>C. T. Martínez-Martínez, J. A. Méndez-Bermúdez, José M. Sigarreta</i>
<p>We investigate some topological and spectral properties of
Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) random digraphs $D(n,p)$. In terms of topological
properties, our primary focus lies in analyzing the number of non-isolated
vertices $V_x(D)$ as well as two vertex-degree-based topological indices: the
Randi\'c index $R(D)$ and sum-connectivity index $\chi(D)$. First, by
performing a scaling analysis we show that the average degree $\langle k
\rangle$ serves as scaling parameter for the average values of $V_x(D)$, $R(D)$
and $\chi(D)$. Then, we also state expressions relating the number of arcs,
spectral radius, and closed walks of length 2 to $(n,p)$, the parameters of ER
random digraphs. Concerning spectral properties, we compute six different graph
energies on $D(n,p)$. We start by validating $\langle k \rangle$ as the scaling
parameter of the graph energies. Additionally, we reformulate a set of bounds
previously reported in the literature for these energies as a function $(n,p)$.
Finally, we phenomenologically state relations between energies that allow us
to extend previously known bounds.

<h3>Broadening of In-Field Superconducting Transitions in Hydrides</h3>

<p>J. E. Hirsch and F. Marsiglio in their publication, Phys. Rev. B 103, 134505
(2021), assert that hydrogen-rich compounds do not exhibit superconductivity.
Their argument hinges on the absence of broadening of superconducting
transitions in applied magnetic fields. We argue, that this assertion is
incorrect, as it relies on a flawed analysis and a selective and inaccurate
report of published data, where data supporting the authors' perspective are
highlighted while data demonstrating clear broadening are intentionally
disregarded.

<h3>Nonreciprocal transport in U(1) gauge theory of high-Tc cuprates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07882" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07882</a>
<br>
<i>Taekoo Oh, Naoto Nagaosa</i>
<p>The nature of the charge carriers in high-Tc cuprates is an essential issue
to reveal their novel physical properties and the mechanism of their
superconductivity. However, the experimental probes and the theoretical
analysis have been mostly restricted to the linear responses. On the other
hand, recent observations of Rashbatype spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the
surface of high-Tc cuprates imply the possible nonlinear and nonreciprocal
transport phenomena under in-plane magnetic fields. In this paper, we study the
nonreciprocal transport properties on the surface of cuprates by employing a
U(1) gauge theory framework, where the electrons are considered to be
fractionalized. Our investigation highlights the intricate variations in
nonreciprocal transport with respect to temperatures and dopings. First, it
reveals contrasting behavior of nonreciprocity in each normal phase. Second, it
discerns the tendencies between underdoped and overdoped superconducting states
and their paraconductivity. The complex behaviors of nonreciprocal transport
originate from the spinful and spinless nature of the charge carriers and their
kinetic energy scales. These findings pave a new avenue to explore the
electronic states in high-Tc cuprates in terms of nonreciprocal transport
phenomena.

<h3>Hyperuniformity in two-dimensional periodic and quasiperiodic point  patterns</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07901" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07901</a>
<br>
<i>A. Koga, S. Sakai</i>
<p>We study hyperuniform properties in various two-dimensional periodic and
quasiperiodic point patterns. Using the histogram of the two-point distances,
we develop an efficient method to calculate the hyperuniformity order metric,
which quantifies the regularity of the hyperuniform point patterns. The results
are compared with those calculated with the conventional running average
method. To discuss how the lattice symmetry affects the order metric, we treat
the trellis and Shastry-Sutherland lattices with the same point density as
examples of periodic lattices, and Stampfli hexagonal and dodecagonal
quasiperiodic tilings with the same point density as examples of quasiperiodic
tilings. It is found that the order metric for the Shastry-Sutherland lattice
(Stampfli dodecagonal tilings) is smaller than the other in the periodic
(quasiperiodic) tiling, meaning that the order metric is deeply related to the
lattice symmetry. Namely, the point pattern with higher symmetry is
characterized by the smaller order metric when their point densities are
identical. Order metrics for several other quasiperiodic tilings are also
calculated.

topology leading to the emergence of counter-intuitive phenomena. One example
is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), which involves the concentration of
eigenstates at the boundary. However, despite the potential insights that can
be gained from high-dimensional non-Hermitian quantum systems in areas like
curved space, high-order topological phases, and black holes, the realization
of this effect in high dimensions remains unexplored. Here, we create a
two-dimensional (2D) non-Hermitian topological band for ultracold fermions in
spin-orbit-coupled optical lattices with tunable dissipation, and
experimentally examine the spectral topology in the complex eigenenergy plane.
We experimentally demonstrate pronounced nonzero spectral winding numbers when
the dissipation is added to the system, which establishes the existence of 2D
skin effect. We also demonstrate that a pair of exceptional points (EPs) are
created in the momentum space, connected by an open-ended bulk Fermi arc, in
contrast to closed loops found in Hermitian systems. The associated EPs emerge
and shift with increasing dissipation, leading to the formation of the Fermi
arc. Our work sets the stage for further investigation into simulating
non-Hermitian physics in high dimensions and paves the way for understanding
the interplay of quantum statistics with NHSE.

<p>Exploring new unconventional superconductors is of great value for both
fundamental research and practical applications. It is a long-term challenge to
develop and study more hole-doped superconductors in 1111 system of iron-based
superconductors. However, fifteen years after the discovery of iron-based
superconductors, it has become increasingly difficult to discover new members
in this system by conventional means. Here we report the discovery of
superconductivity with the critical transition temperature up to 30.7 K in the
parent compound CaFeAsF by an annealing treatment in air atmosphere. The
superconducting behaviors are verified in both the single-crystalline and
polycrystalline samples by the resistance and magnetization measurements. The
analysis by combining the depth-resolved time-of-flight secondary ion mass
spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements
show that the introduction of oxygen elements and the consequent changing in Fe
valence by the annealing treatment may lead to the hole-type doping, which is
the origin for the occurrence of superconductivity. Our results provide a new
route to induce hole-doped superconductivity in Fe-based superconductors.

<h3>Domain formation and universally critical dynamics through phase  separation in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07959" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07959</a>
<br>
<i>Yikai Ji, Xizhou Qin, Bin Liu, Yongyao Li, Bo Lu, Xunda Jiang, Chaohong Lee</i>
<p>We explore the defect formation and universally critical dynamics in
two-dimensional (2D) two-component Bose-Einstein condensates(BECs) subjected to
two types of potential traps: a homogeneous trap and a harmonic trap.We focus
on the non-equilibrium universal dynamics of the miscible-immiscible phase
transition with both linear and nonlinear quenching types.Although there exists
spatial independence of the critical point, we find that the inhomogeneity of
trap doesn't affect the phase transition of system and the critical exponents
can still be explained by the homogeneous Kibble-Zurek mechanism. By analyzing
the Bogoliubov excitations, we establish a power-law relationship between the
domain correlation length, the phase transition delay, and the quench
time.Furthermore, through real-time simulations of phase transition dynamics,
the formation of domain defects and the delay of phase transition in
non-equilibrium dynamics are demonstrated, along with the corresponding
universal scaling of correlation length and phase transition delay for various
quench time and quench coefficients, which align well with our analytical
predictions.Our study confirms that the universality class of two-component
BECs remains unaffected by dimensionality, while the larger nonlinear
coefficients effectively suppress non-adiabatic excitations, offering a novel
perspective for addressing adiabatic evolution.

<h3>Dynamical theory of topological defects II: Universal aspects of defect  motion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07970" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07970</a>
<br>
<i>Jacopo Romano, Benoît Mahault, Ramin Golestanian</i>
<p>We study the dynamics of topological defects in continuum theories governed
by a free energy minimization principle, building on our recently developed
framework [Romano J, Mahault B and Golestanian R 2023 J. Stat. Mech.: Theory
Exp. 083211]. We show how the equation of motion of point defects, domain
walls, disclination lines and any other singularity can be understood with one
unifying mathematical framework. For disclination lines, this also allows us to
study the interplay between the internal line tension and the interaction with
other lines. This interplay is non-trivial, allowing defect loops to expand,
instead of contracting, due to external interaction. We also use this framework
to obtain an analytical description of two long-lasting problems in point
defect motion, namely the scale dependence of the defect mobility and the role
of elastic anisotropy in the motion of defects in liquid crystals. For the
former, we show that this dependence is strongly problem-dependent, but it can
be computed with high accuracy for a pair of annihilating defects. For the
latter, we show that at the first order in perturbation theory anisotropy
causes a non-radial force, making the trajectory of annihilating defects
deviate from a straight line. At higher orders, it also induces a correction in
the mobility, which becomes non-isotropic for the $+1/2$ defect. We argue that,
due to its generality, our method can help to shed light on the motion of
singularities in many different systems, including driven and active
non-equilibrium theories.

<h3>Engineering of a Low-Entropy Quantum Simulator for Strongly Correlated  Electrons Using SU($\mathcal{N}$)-Symmetric Cold Atom Mixtures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08014" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08014</a>
<br>
<i>Daisuke Yamamoto, Katsuhiro Morita</i>
<p>An advanced cooling scheme, incorporating entropy engineering, is vital for
isolated artificial quantum systems designed to emulate the low-temperature
physics of strongly correlated electron systems (SCESs). This study
theoretically demonstrates a cooling method employing multi-component Fermi
gases with SU($\mathcal{N}$)-symmetric interactions, focusing on the case of
$^{173}$Yb atoms in a two-dimensional optical lattice. Adiabatically
introducing a nonuniform state-selective laser gives rise to two distinct
subsystems: a central low-temperature region, exclusively composed of two
specific spin components, acts as a quantum simulator for SCESs, while the
surrounding $\mathcal{N}$-component mixture retains a significant portion of
the entropy of the system. The SU($\mathcal{N}$)-symmetric interactions ensure
that the total particle numbers for each component become good quantum numbers,
creating a sharp boundary for the two-component region. The cooling efficiency
is assessed through extensive finite-temperature Lanczos calculations. The
results lay the foundation for quantum simulations of two-dimensional systems
of Hubbard or Heisenberg type, offering crucial insights into intriguing
low-temperature phenomena in condensed-matter physics.

<h3>Why TiSe$_2$ is a band insulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08015" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08015</a>
<br>
<i>Dimitar Pashov, Ross E. Larsen, Swagata Acharya, Mark van Schilfgaarde</i>
<p>In its crystalline form, TiSe$_2$ is thought to be an insulator with a
bandgap of ~0.1-0.2 eV. This materials system has attracted a much interest
because of its rich array of unique properties. It forms a charge density wave
(CDW) in both bulk and monolayer form, and there has been wide speculation that
TiSe$_2$ is a rare realisation of an excitonic insulator. Using a
self-consistent form of many body perturbation theory, we establish that
TiSe$_2$ is a band insulator, but it is only nonmetallic as a consequence of
fluctuations in nuclear positions about its nominally high-symmetry (P-3m1)
phase. Below 200 K, TiSe$_2$ undergoes a transition to a charge density-wave
(P-3c1) phase, which activates coupling between states near the Fermi level and
causes a gap to form. Above 200 K the nominal P-3m1 symmetry represents only a
time average of the true configuration. Dynamics in the nuclear configuration
are responsible for TiSe$_2$ being nonmetallic. We demonstrate this through a
combination of molecular dynamics and the Self-consistent Quasiparticle
Approximation. We further establish that ladder diagrams included in the
polarizability (which includes the mechanism needed to form an excitonic
insulator) are of little importance.

<h3>Relaxation dynamics in the staggered XY chain after a quantum quench</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08025" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08025</a>
<br>
<i>Kaiyuan Cao, Yayun Hu, Peiqing Tong, Guangwen Yang, Peng Liu</i>
<p>We investigate the relaxation dynamics of the fermion two-point correlation
function $C_{mn}(t)=\langle\psi(t)|c_{m}^{\dag}c_{n}|\psi(t)\rangle$ in the XY
chain with staggered nearest-neighbor hopping interaction after a quench. We
find that the deviation $\delta C_{mn}(t)=C_{mn}(t)-C_{mn}(\infty)$ decays with
time following the power law behavior $t^{-\mu}$, where the exponent $\mu$
depends on whether the quench is to the commensurate phase ($\mu=1$) and
incommensurate phase ($\mu=\frac{1}{2}$). This decay of $\delta C_{mn}(t)$
arises from the transient behavior of the double excited quasiparticle
occupations and the transitions between different excitation spectra.
Furthermore, we find that the steady value $C_{mn}(\infty)$, which is different
from the ground state expectation value, only involves the average fermion
occupation numbers (i.e. the average excited single particle). We also observe
nonanalytic singularities in the steady value $C_{mn}(\infty)$ for the quench
to the critical points of the quantum phase transitions (QPTs), suggesting its
potential use as a signature of QPTs.

<br>
<i>Shalini Badola, Supratik Mukherjee, Greeshma Sunil, B. Ghosh, Devesh Negi, G. Vaitheeswaran, A. C. Garcia-Castro, Surajit Saha</i>
<p>Multifunctional properties in quantum systems require the interaction between
different degrees of freedom. As such, spin-phonon coupling emerges as an ideal
mechanism to tune multiferroicity, magnetism, and magnetoelectric response. In
this letter, we demonstrate and explain, based on theoretical and experimental
analyses, an unusual manifestation of spin-phonon coupling, i.e., prevention of
a ferroelastic structural transition, and locking of high-temperature R-3m
phase in a magnetically frustrated perovskite-like oxide Ba2NiTeO6. We present
Ba2NiTeO6 as a prototype example among its family where long-range
antiferromagnetic structure couples with a low-frequency Eg mode (at 55 cm-1)
that exhibits a large anharmonicity. Our findings establish that spin-phonon
coupling clearly suppresses the phonon anharmonicity preventing the structural
phase transition from the R-3m to the C2/m phase in Ba2NiTeO6.

<p>The covalent functionalization of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)
with luminescent quantum defects enables their application as near-infrared
single-photon sources, as optical sensors, and for in-vivo tissue imaging.
Tuning the emission wavelength and defect density are crucial for these
applications. While the former can be controlled by different synthetic
protocols and is easily measured, defect densities are still determined as
relative rather than absolute values, limiting the comparability between
different nanotube batches and chiralities. Here, we present an absolute and
unified quantification metric for the defect density in SWCNT samples based on
Raman spectroscopy. It is applicable to a range of small-diameter nanotubes and
for arbitrary laser wavelengths. We observe a clear inverse correlation of the
D/G$^{+}$ ratio increase with nanotube diameter, indicating that curvature
effects contribute significantly to the defect-activation of Raman modes.
Correlation of intermediate frequency modes with defect densities further
corroborates their activation by defects and provides additional quantitative
metrics for the characterization of functionalized SWCNTs.

<h3>Emerging topological characterization in non-equilibrium states of  quenched Kitaev chains</h3>

<br>
<i>Y. B. Shi, X. Z. Zhang, Z. Song</i>
<p>Topological characteristics in quantum systems typically determine the ground
state, while the corresponding quantum phase transition (QPT) can be identified
through quenching dynamics. Based on the exact results of extended Kitaev
chains, we demonstrate that the system dynamics can be comprehended through the
precession of an ensemble of free-pseudo spins under a magnetic field. The
topology of the driven Hamiltonian is determined by the average winding number
of the non-equilibrium state. Furthermore, we establish that the singularity of
the dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) arises from two perpendicular
pseudo-spin vectors associated with the preand post-quenched Hamiltonians.
Moreover, we investigate the distinct behaviors of the dynamic pairing order
parameter in both topological and non-topological regions. These findings offer
valuable insights into the non-equilibrium behavior of topological
superconductors, contributing to the understanding of the resilience of
topological properties in driven quantum systems.

<p>The discrete stochastic dynamics of a random walker in the presence of
resetting and memory is analyzed. Resetting and memory effects may compete for
certain parameter regime and lead to significant changes in the long time
dynamics of the walker. Analytic exact results are obtained for a model memory
where the walker remembers all the past events equally. In most cases,
resetting effects dominate at long times and dictate the asymptotic dynamics.
We discuss the full phase diagram of the asymptotic dynamics and the resulting
changes due to the resetting and the memory effects.

<h3>Charged vacancy in graphene: interplay between Landau levels and atomic  collapse resonances</h3>

<br>
<i>Jing Wang, Wen-Sheng Zhao, Yue Hu, R. N. Costa Filho, Francois M. Peeters</i>
<p>The interplay between a magnetic field and the Coulomb potential from a
charged vacancy on the electron states in graphene is investigated within the
tight-binding model. The Coulomb potential removes locally Landau level
degeneracy, while the vacancy introduces a satellite level next to the normal
Landau level. These satellite levels are found throughout the positive energy
region, but in the negative energy region they turn into atomic collapse
resonances. Crossings between Landau levels with different angular quantum
number $m$ are found. Unlike the point impurity system in which an anticrossing
occurs between Landau levels of the same $m$, in this work anticrossing is
found between the normal Landau level and the vacancy induced level. The atomic
collapse resonance hybridize with the Landau levels. The charge at which the
lowest Landau level $m = -1, N = 1$ crosses increases $E = 0$ with enhancing
magnetic field. Landau level scaling anomaly occurs when the charge is larger
than the critical charge $\beta\approx0.6$ and this critical charge is
independent of the magnetic field.

<h3>Generation of electric current and electromotive force by an  antiferromagnetic domain wall</h3>

<br>
<i>A. G. Mal'shukov</i>
<p>Dynamic magnetic textures may transfer the angular moment from the varying in
time antiferromagnetic order to spins of conduction electrons. Due to the spin
orbit coupling (SOC) these spin excitations can induce the electric current of
conduction electrons. We calculated the electric current and the electromotive
force (EMF) which are produced by a domain wall (DW) moving parallel to the
magnetically compensated interface between an antiferromagnetic insulator
(AFMI) and a two-dimensional spin orbit coupled metal. Spins of conduction
electrons interact with localized spins of a collinear AFMI through the
interface exchange interaction. The Keldysh formalism of nonequilibrium Green
functions was applied for the analysis of this system. It is shown that a Bloch
DW generates the current perpendicular to the DW motion direction. At the same
time a N\'{e}el DW creates the electric potential which builds up across the
wall. The total charge which is pumped by a Bloch DW can be expressed in terms
of a topologically invariant charge quantum. The latter does not depend on
variations of DW's velocity and shape. These effects increase dramatically when
the Fermi energy approaches the van Hove singularity of the Fermi surface. The
obtained results are important for the electrical detection and control of
dynamic magnetic textures in antiferromagnets.

<h3>First Principles Prediction Unveils High-T$_c$ Superconductivity in  YSc$_2$H$_{24}$ Cage Structures</h3>

<i>Viet-Ha Chu, Truong-Tho Pham, Duc-Long Nguyen</i>
<p>The quest for room-temperature superconductivity has been a long-standing
aspiration in the field of materials science, driving extensive research
efforts. In this work, we present a novel hydride, YSc$_2$H$_{24}$, which is
stable at high pressure using a crystal structure prediction approach with a
fixed composition based on known structures. The discovered material is
crystalline in a hexagonal unit cell with space group P6/mmm and has a
fastinating structure consisting of two distinct cages: Sc@H$_{24}$ and
Y@H$_{30}$. By conducting an extensive numerical investigation of lattice
dynamics, electron-phonon coupling, and solving the isotropic Eliashberg
equation, we have revealed a significant value of $\lambda$ = 2.96 as the
underlying factor responsible for the remarkably high critical temperature
(T$_c$) of 306-332 K in YSc$_2$H$_{24}$. As pressure increases, the T$_c$
remains above the ambient temperature. Our work has the potential to enhance
the existing understanding of high-temperature superconductors, with
implications for practical applications. The unique network of these cage-like
structures holds great promise for advancing our understanding of
high-temperature superconductors, potentially leading to innovative
applications.

<br>
<i>Misaki Ozawa, Jean-Louis Barrat, Walter Kob, Francesco Zamponi</i>
<p>Creating amorphous solid states by randomly bonding an ensemble of dense
liquid monomers is a common procedure which is applied to create a variety of
materials such as epoxy resins, colloidal gels, and vitrimers. The properties
of the resulting solid do, however, {\it a priori} strongly depend on the
preparation history. This can lead to substantial aging of the material, i.e.,
properties such as mechanical moduli and transport coefficients depend on the
time elapsed since solidification, which can lead to a slow degradation of the
material in technological applications. It is therefore important to understand
under which conditions random monomer bonding can lead to stable solid states,
i.e., long-lived metastable states whose properties do not change over time. In
this work, we present a theoretical and computational analysis of this problem,
and introduce a random bonding procedure that guarantees the proper
equilibration of the resulting amorphous states. Our procedure also provides a
new route to investigate the fundamental properties of glassy energy landscapes
by producing translationally-invariant ultrastable glassy states of simple
particle models.

<p>Liquid water is reluctant to lose hydrogen-bond coordination. Here we reveal
that it also demands contraction and reorientation of the second molecular
shell to compensate for coordination defects. Such molecular principle will be
shown to lie at the heart of the two-liquids scenario and to determine the
behavior of water in hydration and nanoconfinement. Furthermore, it allows to
define conditions for wettability (quantifying hydrophobicity and predicting
drying transitions), thus opening the possibility to elucidate the active role
of water in central fields of research.

<h3>DFT+DMFT study of exchange interactions in cobalt and their implications  for the competition of hcp and fcc phases</h3>

<i>A. A. Katanin</i>
<p>We reconsider magnetic properties of fcc and hcp cobalt within the density
functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) approach in the
paramagnetic phase. Using recently proposed approach of calculation of exchange
interactions in paramagnetic phase, we extract exchange interaction parameters
of fcc and hcp cobalt and show that the hcp phase possesses larger spin
stiffness, in agreement with the experimental data, showing stronger tendency
to ferromagnetism. Accordingly, the DMFT Curie temperature of the hcp phase
appears to be higher, than that of the fcc phase. The disappearance of magnetic
order in the fcc phase well below the cobalt Curie temperature is expected to
affect its structural stability and make this phase energetically unfavourable
near the experimental Curie temperature. This may explain the "revival" of the
hcp phase near the Curie temperature of cobalt, observed in the recent
experimental results of perturbed angular correlation study [Sci. Rep. {\bf

<i>Jie Chen, Shijie Hu, Lihui Pan, Xiaoqun Wang</i>
<p>The generation of nonuniform quadrupole states plays a crucial role in
understanding various fascinating phenomena observed in the advancement of
several research areas, e.g., multiferroic compounds, nonmagnetic
superconductors, etc. In this work, we investigate the ground-state phase
diagram of a generalized spin-3/2 bilinear-biquadratic-bicubic Heisenberg chain
in the representation of multipolar operators. By numerical simulations with
the large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we
successfully identify a tetramerization phase and a stripe-Q phase. These
phases are characterized by the emergence of nonuniform quadrupole orders
resulting from the spontaneous breaking of translation symmetry. In particular,
tetramerization phase refers to the quadrupole operators take a four-cycle,
while the stripe-Q phase represents a striped pattern in quadrupole operators.
Additionally, we demonstrate the presence of a Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model
with level k = 1 at the transition point between the dimerized (DM) phase and
the Luttinger liquid (LL) phase, based on strong numerical findings.

<br>
<i>F. X. Bronold, F. Willert</i>
<p>Quite a many electron transport problems in condensed matter physics are
analyzed with a quasiparticle Boltzmann equation. For sufficiently slowly
varying weak external potentials it can be derived from the basic equations of
quantum kinetics, provided quasiparticles can be defined and lead to a pole in
the quantum-mechanical propagators. The derivation breaks down, however, in the
vicinity of an interface which constitutes an abrupt strong perturbation of the
system. In this contribution we discuss in a tutorial manner a particular
technique to systematically derive, for a planar, nonideal interface, matching
conditions for the quasi-particle Boltzmann equation. The technique is based on
pseudizing the transport problem by two auxiliary interface-free systems and
matching Green functions at the interface. Provided quasiparticles exist in the
auxiliary systems, the framework can be put onto the semiclassical level and
the desired boundary conditions result. For ideal interfaces, the conditions
can be guessed from flux conservation, but for complex interfaces this is no
longer the case. The technique presented in this work is geared towards such
interfaces.

<i>Adam B. Cahaya</i>
<p>Paramagnetism or diamagnetism of a material are shown by parallel or
antiparallel directions, respectively, of the induced magnetization under the
influence of external magnetic field. Theoretical study of paramagnetic
susceptibility and diamagnetic susceptibility of non-interacting electrons
system are well described by Pauli's spin susceptibility and Landau-Peierls'
orbital susceptibility, respectively. For interacting electron systems, the
paramagnetic susceptibility has been widely studied by using Hubbard's electron
- electron interaction. However, due to its smaller value, the diamagnetic
susceptibility has not been studied. To investigate the enhancement of an
interacting electrons system, we study a generalized space and time-dependent
orbital susceptibility of conduction electron with a repulsive Hubbard's
electron - electron interaction. By using the retarded Green function
expression of the space and time-dependent orbital susceptibility, we found
that the orbital susceptibility is enhanced when Hubbard's electron - electron
interaction is negative.

<h3>Entanglement and correlations in an exactly-solvable model of a  Bose-Einstein condensate in a cavity</h3>

<br>
<i>Ofir E. Alon, Lorenz S. Cederbaum</i>
<p>An exactly solvable model of a trapped interacting Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC) coupled in the dipole approximation to a quantized light mode in a cavity
is presented. The model can be seen as a generalization of the
harmonic-interaction model for a trapped BEC coupled to a bosonic bath. After
obtaining the ground-state energy and wavefunction in closed form, we focus on
computing the correlations in the system. The reduced one-particle density
matrices of the bosons and the cavity are constructed and diagonalized
analytically, and the von Neumann entanglement entropy of the BEC and the
cavity is also expressed explicitly as a function of the number and mass of the
bosons, frequencies of the trap and cavity, and the cavity-boson coupling
strength. The results allow one to study the impact of the cavity on the bosons
and vice versa on an equal footing. As an application we investigate a specific
case of basic interest for itself, namely, non-interacting bosons in a cavity.
We find that both the bosons and the cavity develop correlations in a
complementary manner while increasing the coupling between them. Whereas the
cavity wavepacket broadens in Fock space, the BEC density saturates in real
space. On the other hand, while the cavity depletion saturates, and hence does
the BEC-cavity entanglement entropy, the BEC becomes strongly correlated and
eventually increasingly fragmented. The latter phenomenon implies single-trap
fragmentation of otherwise ideal bosons, where their induced long-range
interaction is mediated by the cavity. Finally, as a complimentary
investigation, the mean-field equations for the BEC-cavity system are solved
analytically as well, and the breakdown of mean-field theory for the cavity and
the bosons with increasing coupling is discussed. Further applications are
envisaged.

<i>Harish Gudla, Kristina Edström, Chao Zhang</i>
<p>Functoinal polymers can be used as electrolyte and binder materials in
solid-state batteries. This often requires performance targets in terms of both
transport and mechanical properties. In this work, a model ionic conductive
polymer system, i.e., poly(ethylene oxide)-LiTFSI, was used to study the impact
of salt concentrations on mechanical properties, including different types of
elastic moduli and the visoelasticity with both non-equilibrium and equilibrium
molecular dynamics simulations. We found an encouragingly good agreement
between experiments and simulations regarding the Young's modulus, bulk modulus
and viscosity. In addition, we identified an intermediate salt concentration at
which the system shows high ionic conductivity, high Young's modulus and short
elastic restoration time. Therefore, this study laid down the groundwork for
investigating ionic conductive polymer binders with self-healing functionality
from molecular dynamics simulations.

<p>Topological quantum materials can exhibit unconventional surface states and
anomalous transport properties, but their applications to spintronic devices
are restricted as they require the growth of high-quality thin films with
bulk-like properties. Here, we study 10--30 nm thick epitaxial ferromagnetic
Co$_{\rm 2}$MnGa films with high structural order. Very high values of the
anomalous Hall conductivity, $\sigma_{\rm xy}=1.35\times10^{5}$ $\Omega^{-1}
m^{-1}$, and the anomalous Hall angle, $\theta_{\rm H}=15.8\%$, both comparable
to bulk values. We observe a dramatic crystalline orientation dependence of the
Gilbert damping constant of a factor of two and a giant intrinsic spin Hall
conductivity, $\mathit{\sigma_{\rm SHC}}=(6.08\pm 0.02)\times 10^{5}$
($\hbar/2e$) $\Omega^{-1} m^{-1}$, which is an order of magnitude higher than
literature values of single-layer Ni$_{\rm 80}$Fe$_{\rm 20}$, Ni, Co, Fe, and
multilayer Co$_{\rm 2}$MnGa stacks. Theoretical calculations of the intrinsic
spin Hall conductivity, originating from a strong Berry curvature, corroborate
the results and yield values comparable to the experiment. Our results open up
for the design of spintronic devices based on single layers of topological
quantum materials.

<p>By effectively controlling the dipole-dipole interaction, we investigate the
characteristics of the ground state of bright solitons in a spin-orbit coupled
dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate. The dipolar atoms are trapped within a
double-lattice which consists of a linear and a nonlinear lattice. We derive
the motion equations of the different spin components, taking the controlling
mechanisms of the diolpe-dipole interaction into account. An analytical
expression of dipole-dipole interaction is derived. By adjusting the dipole
polarization angle, the dipole interaction can be adjusted from attraction to
repulsion. On this basis, we study the generation and manipulation of the
bright solitons using both the analytical variational method and numerical
imaginary time evolution. The stability of the bright solitons is also analyzed
and we map out the stability phase diagram. By adjusting the long-range
dipole-dipole interaction, one can achieve manipulation of bright solitons in
all aspects, including the existence, width, nodes, and stability. Considering
the complexity of our system, our results will have enormous potential
applications in quantum simulation of complex systems.

<h3>Angular dependence of the interlayer coupling at the interface between  two dimensional materials 1T-PtSe2 and graphene</h3>

<i>P. Mallet, F. Ibrahim, K. Abdukayumov, A. Marty, C. Vergnaud, F. Bonell, M. Chshiev, M. Jamet, J-Y Veuillen</i>
<p>We present a study by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy, supported by ab initio
calculations, of the interaction between graphene and monolayer
(semiconducting) PtSe2 as a function of the twist angle {\theta} between the
two layers. We analyze the PtSe2 contribution to the hybrid interface states
that develop within the bandgap of the semiconductor to probe the interaction.
The experimental data indicate that the interlayer coupling increases markedly
with the value of {\theta}, which is confirmed by ab initio calculations. The
moir\'e patterns observed within the gap are consistent with a momentum
conservation rule between hybridized states, and the strength of the
hybridization can be qualitatively described by a perturbative model.

<br>
<i>Frédéric Paquin-Lefebvre, David Holcman</i>
<p>The flow of ions through permeable channels causes voltage drop in
physiological nanodomains such as synapses, dendrites and dendritic spines, and
other protrusions. How the voltage changes around channels in these nanodomains
has remained poorly studied. We focus this book chapter on summarizing recent
efforts in computing the steady-state current, voltage and ionic concentration
distributions based on the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations as a model of
electro-diffusion. We first consider the spatial distribution of an uncharged
particle density and derive asymptotic formulas for the concentration
difference by solving the Laplace's equation with mixed boundary conditions. We
study a constant particles injection rate modeled by a Neumann flux condition
at a channel represented by a small boundary target, while the injected
particles can exit at one or several narrow patches. We then discuss the case
of two species (positive and negative charges) and take into account motions
due to both concentration and electrochemical gradients. The voltage resulting
from charge interactions is calculated by solving the Poisson's equation. We
show how deep an influx diffusion propagates inside a nanodomain, for
populations of both uncharged and charged particles. We estimate the
concentration and voltage changes in relations with geometrical parameters and
quantify the impact of membrane curvature.

<h3>The GōMartini approach: Revisiting the concept of contact maps and the  modelling of protein complexes</h3>

<i>Luis F. Cofas-Vargas, Rodrigo A. Moreira, Simón Poblete, Mateusz Chwastyk, Adolfo B. Poma</i>
<p>We present a review of a series of contact maps for the determination of
native interactions in proteins and nucleic acids based on a
distance-threshold. Such contact maps are mostly based on physical and chemical
construction, and yet they are sensitive to some parameters (e.g. distances or
atomic radii) and can neglect some key interactions. Furthermore, we also
comment on a new class of contact maps that only requires geometric arguments.
The contact map is a necessary ingredient to build a robust G\=oMartini model
for proteins and their complexes in the Martini 3 force field. We present the
extension of a popular structure-based G\=o-like approach for the study of
protein-sugar complexes, and also limitations of this approach are discussed.
The G\=oMartini approach was first introduced by Poma et al. J. Chem. Theory
Comput. 2017, 13(3), 1366-1374 in Martini 2 force field and recently, it has
gained the status of gold-standard for protein simulation undergoing
conformational changes in Martini 3 force field. We discuss several studies
that have provided support to this approach in the context of the biophysical
community.

<h3>Overcoming the Size Limit of First Principles Molecular Dynamics  Simulations with an In-Distribution Substructure Embedding Active Learner</h3>

<br>
<i>Lingyu Kong, Jielan Li, Lixin Sun, Han Yang, Hongxia Hao, Chi Chen, Nongnuch Artrith, Jose Antonio Garrido Torres, Ziheng Lu, Yichi Zhou</i>
<p>Large-scale first principles molecular dynamics are crucial for simulating
complex processes in chemical, biomedical, and materials sciences. However, the
unfavorable time complexity with respect to system sizes leads to prohibitive
computational costs when the simulation contains over a few hundred atoms in
practice. We present an In-Distribution substructure Embedding Active Learner
(IDEAL) to enable efficient simulation of large complex systems with quantum
accuracy by maintaining a machine learning force field (MLFF) as an accurate
surrogate to the first principles methods. By extracting high-uncertainty
substructures into low-uncertainty atom environments, the active learner is
allowed to concentrate on and learn from small substructures of interest rather
than carrying out intractable quantum chemical computations on large
structures. IDEAL is benchmarked on various systems and shows sub-linear
complexity, accelerating the simulation thousands of times compared with
conventional active learning and millions of times compared with pure first
principles simulations. To demonstrate the capability of IDEAL in practical
applications, we simulated a polycrystalline lithium system composed of one
million atoms and the full ammonia formation process in a Haber-Bosch reaction
on a 3-nm Iridium nanoparticle catalyst on a computing node comprising one
single A100 GPU and 24 CPU cores.

<h3>Competing charge transfer and screening effects in two-dimensional  ferroelectric capacitors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08187" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08187</a>
<br>
<i>Jiawei Huang, Changming Ke, Zhuang Qian, Shi Liu</i>
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics offer the potential for ultrathin
flexible nanoelectronics, typically utilizing a metal-ferroelectric-metal
sandwich structure as the functional unit. Electrodes can either contribute
free carriers to screen the depolarization field, enhancing nanoscale
ferroelectricity, or they can induce charge doping, disrupting the long-range
crystalline order. Here, we explore the dual roles of electrodes in 2D
ferroelectric capacitors, supported by extensive first-principles calculations
covering a range of electrode work functions. Our results reveal volcano-type
relationships between ferroelectric-electrode binding affinity and work
function, which are further unified by a quadratic scaling between the binding
energy and the transferred interfacial charge. At the monolayer limit, the
charge transfer dictates the ferroelectric stability and switching properties.
This is a general characteristic confirmed in various 2D ferroelectrics
including $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$, CuInP$_2$S$_6$, and SnTe. As the ferroelectric
layer's thickness increases, the stability of the capacitor evolves from a
charge transfer-dominated to a screening-dominated state. The delicate
interplay between these two effects will have important implications for the
applications of 2D ferroelectric capacitors.

<h3>Large deviations in statistics of the convex hull of passive and active  particles: A theoretical study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08193" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08193</a>
<br>
<i>Soheli Mukherjee, Naftali R. Smith</i>
<p>We investigate analytically the distribution tails of the area A and
perimeter L of a convex hull for different types of planar random walks. For N
noninteracting Brownian motions of duration T we find that the large-L and A
tails behave as $\mathcal{P}\left(L\right)\sim e^{-b_{N}L^{2}/DT}$ and
$\mathcal{P}\left(A\right)\sim e^{-c_{N}A/DT}$, while the small-$L$ and $A$
tails behave as $\mathcal{P}\left(L\right)\sim e^{-d_{N}DT/L^{2}}$ and
$\mathcal{P}\left(A\right)\sim e^{-e_{N}DT/A}$, where $D$ is the diffusion
coefficient. We calculated all of the coefficients ($b_N, c_N, d_N, e_N$)
exactly. Strikingly, we find that $b_N$ and $c_N$ are independent of N, for
$N\geq 3$ and $N \geq 4$, respectively. We find that the large-L (A) tails are
dominated by a single, most probable realization that attains the desired L
(A). The left tails are dominated by the survival probability of the particles
inside a circle of appropriate size. For active particles and at long times, we
find that large-L and A tails are given by $\mathcal{P}\left(L\right)\sim
e^{-T\Psi_{N}^{\text{per}}\left(L/T\right)}$ and $\mathcal{P}\left(A\right)\sim
e^{-T\Psi_{N}^{\text{area}}\left(\sqrt{A}/T\right)}$ respectively. We calculate
the large deviation functions $\Psi_N$ exactly and find that they exhibit
multiple singularities. We interpret these as dynamical phase transitions of
first order. We extended several of these results to dimensions $d>2$. Our
analytic predictions display excellent agreement with existing results that
were obtained from extensive numerical simulations.

<h3>Thermodynamics of the $S=1/2$ hyperkagome-lattice Heisenberg  antiferromagnet</h3>

<br>
<i>Taras Hutak, Taras Krokhmalskii, Oleg Derzhko, Jürgen Schnack, Johannes Richter</i>
<p>The $S=1/2$ hyperkagome-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which for
instance is related to the experimentally accessible spinel oxide
Na$_4$Ir$_3$O$_8$, allows to study the interplay of geometrical frustration and
quantum as well as thermal fluctuations in three dimensions. We use 16 terms of
a high-temperature series expansion complemented by the entropy-method
interpolation to examine the specific heat and the uniform susceptibility of
the $S=1/2$ hyperkagome-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet. We obtain
thermodynamic quantities for the two possible scenarios of either a gapless or
a gapped energy spectrum. We have found that the specific heat $c$ exhibits,
besides the high-temperature peak around $T\approx 0.669$, a low-temperature
one at $T\approx 0.021\ldots0.033$. The functional form of the uniform
susceptibility $\chi$ below about $T=0.5$ depends strongly on whether the
energy spectrum is gapless or gapped. The value of the ground-state energy can
be estimated to $e_{0}\approx-0.440\ldots-0.435$. In addition to the
entropy-method interpolation we use the finite-temperature Lanczos method to
calculate $c$ and $\chi$ for finite lattices of $N=24$ and $36$ sites. A
combined view on both methods leads us to favour a gapless scenario since then
the maximum of the susceptibility agrees better between both methods.

<p>The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in the
Ruddlesden-Popper phase La3Ni2O7 under high pressure marks a significant
breakthrough in the field of 3d transition-metal oxide superconductors. For an
emerging novel class of high-Tc superconductors, it is crucial to find more
analogous superconducting materials with a dedicated effort toward broadening
the scope of nickelate superconductors. Here, we report on the observation of
high-Tc superconductivity in the high-pressure tetragonal I4/mmm phase of
La2PrNi2O7 above ~10 GPa, which is distinct from the reported orthorhombic Fmmm
phase of La3Ni2O7 above 14 GPa. For La2PrNi2O7, the onset and the
zero-resistance temperatures of superconductivity reach Tconset = 78.2 K and
Tczero = 40 K at 15 GPa. This superconducting phase shares the samilar
structural symmetry as many cuprate superconductors, providing a fresh platform
to investigate underlying mechanisms of nickelate superconductors.

<p>In this work the explicit solution of the electronic plasma diffusion with
radiation reaction force, under the action of an exponential decay external
electric field is given. The electron dynamics is described by a classical
generalized Langevin equation characterized by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-type
friction memory kernel, with an effective memory time which accounts for the
effective thermal interaction between the electron and its surroundings
(thermal collisions between electrons + radiation reaction force). The incident
electric field exerts an electric force on the electron, which in turn can
induce an additional damping to the braking radiation force, allowing a delay
in the electron characteristic time. This fact allows that the effective memory
time be finite and positive, and as a consequence, obtaining physically
admissible solutions of the stochastic Abraham-Lorentz-like equation. It is
shown that the diffusion process is quasi-Markovian which includes the
radiation effects.

<h3>Softness Matters: Effects of Compression on the Behavior of Adsorbed  Microgels at Interfaces</h3>

<br>
<i>Yuri Gerelli, Fabrizio Camerin, Steffen Bochenek, Maximilian M. Schmidt, Armando Maestro, Walter Richtering, Emanuela Zaccarelli, Andrea Scotti</i>
<p>Deformable colloids and macromolecules adsorb at interfaces, as they decrease
the interfacial energy between the two media. The deformability, or softness,
of these particles plays a pivotal role in the properties of the interface. In
this study, we employ a comprehensive \emph{in situ} approach, combining
neutron reflectometry with molecular dynamics simulations, to thoroughly
examine the profound influence of softness on the structure of microgel
Langmuir monolayers under compression. Lateral compression of both hard and
soft microgel particle monolayers induces substantial structural alterations,
leading to an amplified protrusion of the microgels into the aqueous phase.
However, a critical distinction emerges: hard microgels are pushed away from
the interface, in stark contrast to the soft ones, which remain steadfastly
anchored to it. Concurrently, on the air-exposed side of the monolayer, lateral
compression induces a flattening of the surface of the hard monolayer. This
phenomenon is not observed for the soft particles as the monolayer is already
extremely flat even in the absence of compression. These findings significantly
advance our understanding of the pivotal role of softness on both the
equilibrium phase behavior of the monolayer and its effect when soft colloids
are used as stabilizers of responsive interfaces and emulsions.

<h3>Fermi accelerating an Anderson-localized Fermi gas to superdiffusion</h3>

<br>
<i>Sian Barbosa, Maximilian Kiefer-Emmanouilidis, Felix Lang, Jennifer Koch, Artur Widera</i>
<p>Disorder can have dramatic impact on the transport properties of quantum
systems. On the one hand, Anderson localization, arising from destructive
quantum interference of multiple-scattering paths, can halt transport entirely.
On the other hand, processes involving time-dependent random forces such as
Fermi acceleration, proposed as a mechanism for high-energy cosmic particles,
can expedite particle transport significantly. The competition of these two
effects in time-dependent inhomogeneous or disordered potentials can give rise
to interesting dynamics but experimental observations are scarce. Here, we
experimentally study the dynamics of an ultracold, non-interacting Fermi gas
expanding inside a disorder potential with finite spatial and temporal
correlations. Depending on the disorder's strength and rate of change, we
observe several distinct regimes of tunable anomalous diffusion, ranging from
weak localization and subdiffusion to superdiffusion. Especially for strong
disorder, where the expansion shows effects of localization, an intermediate
regime is present in which quantum interference appears to counteract
acceleration. Our system connects the phenomena of Anderson localization with
second-order Fermi acceleration and paves the way to experimentally
investigating Fermi acceleration when entering the regime of quantum transport.

topological superconductivity. Although the band structure of KTaO3 surfaces of
various crystallographic orientations has already been mapped using
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy(ARPES), this is not the case for
superconducting KTaO3 2DEGs. Here, we reveal the electronic structure of
superconducting 2DEGs based on KTaO3 (111) single crystals through ARPES
measurements. We fit the data with a tight-binding model and compute the
associated spin textures to bring insight into the SOC-driven physics of this

<h3>A calculation method to estimate thermal conductivity of high entropy  ceramic for thermal barrier coatings</h3>

<i>Yuxuan Wang, Guoqiang Lan, Jun Song</i>
<p>High entropy ceramics are highly promising as next generation thermal barrier
coatings due to their unique disorder structure, which imparts ultra-low
thermal conductivity and good high temperature stability. Unlike traditional
ceramic materials, the thermal resistance in high entropy ceramics
predominantly arises from phonon-disorder scattering rather than phonon-phonon
interactions. In this study, we propose a calculation method based on the
supercell phonon unfolding (SPU) technique to predict the thermal conductivity
of high entropy ceramics, specially focusing on rocksalt oxides structures. Our
prediction method relies on using the reciprocal value of SPU phonon spectra
linewidth as an indicator of phonon lifetime. The obtained results demonstrate
a strong agreement between the predicted thermal conductivities and the
experimental measurements, validating the feasibility of our calculation
method. Furthermore, we extensively investigate and discuss the atomic
relaxation and lattice distortion effects in 5-dopants and 6-dopants rocksalt
structures during the process.

<p>We present a comprehensive study of broadband spin pumping utilizing the
inverse spin Hall effect phenomena in bilayer samples comprising Ni81Fe19 (15
nm) and NbN (with NbN thickness varying from 20 nm to 140 nm), conducted over a
temperature and frequency range spanning from 300 K to 4 K and 2 GHz to 12 GHz,
respectively. Our investigations reveal a systematic shift in ferromagnetic
resonance fields, amplitude, and line widths as functions of both frequency and
temperature. Notably, we observed a temperature-dependent increase in the spin
Hall angle value, surpassing previously reported values. Furthermore, our
results demonstrate a pronounced temperature dependence in the inverse spin
Hall effect voltage, exhibiting a significant reduction below the Tc. This
reduction in inverse spin Hall effect voltage is accompanied by an increase in
the linewidth of the ferromagnetic resonance mode.

<p>Electrical transport in non-centrosymmetric materials departs from the
well-established phenomenological Ohm's law. Instead of a linear relation
between current and electric field, a non-linear conductivity emerges along
specific crystallographic directions. This non-linear transport is
fundamentally related to the lack of spatial inversion symmetry. However, the
experimental implications of an inversion symmetry operation on the non-linear
conductivity remain to be explored. Here, we report on a large, non-linear
conductivity in chiral Tellurium. By measuring samples with opposite
handedness, we demonstrate that the non-linear transport is odd under spatial
inversion. Furthermore, by applying an electrostatic gate, we modulate the
non-linear output by a factor of 300, reaching the highest reported value
excluding engineered heterostructures. Our results establish chiral Te as an
ideal compound not just to study the fundamental interplay between crystal
structure, symmetry operations and non-linear transport, but also to develop
wireless rectifiers and energy-harvesting chiral devices.

<p>Achieving robust and electrically controlled valley polarization in monolayer
transition metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs) is a frontier challenge for
realistic valleytronic applications. Theoretical investigations show that
integration of 2D materials with ferroelectrics is a promising strategy;
however, its experimental demonstration has remained elusive. Here, we
fabricate ferroelectric field-effect transistors using a ML-WSe2 channel and a
AlScN ferroelectric dielectric, and experimentally demonstrate efficient tuning
as well as non-volatile control of valley polarization. We measured a large
array of transistors and obtained a maximum valley polarization of ~27% at 80 K
with stable retention up to 5400 secs. The enhancement in the valley
polarization was ascribed to the efficient exciton-to-trion (X-T) conversion
and its coupling with an out-of-plane electric field, viz. the quantum-confined
Stark effect. This changes the valley depolarization pathway from strong
exchange interactions to slow spin-flip intervalley scattering. Our research
demonstrates a promising approach for achieving non-volatile control over
valley polarization and suggests new design principles for practical
valleytronic devices.

<i>Oleksandr V. Dobrovolskiy</i>
<p>The last decade has been marked by great interest in the dynamics of vortices
moving at high ($>$10\,km/s) velocities in superconductors. However, the
flux-flow instability (FFI) prevents its exploration and sets practical limits
for the use of vortices in various applications. Even so, FFI has turned into a
valuable tool for studying the quasiparticle energy relaxation in
superconductors, with the view of enhancement of the single-photon detection
capability of micrometer-wide strips operated at large bias currents. In this
context, the failure of ``global'' FFI models for materials with strong
intrinsic and edge vortex pinning has urged the elaboration of ``local'' FFI
models. This chapter outlines the recent advances in the research on FFI and
highlights superconductors with perfect edges and weak volume pinning as
prospective materials for studying fast vortex dynamics and nonequilibrium
superconductivity. This manuscript is based on the author-prepared version of

<p>The presence of hot carriers is presented in the operational properties of an
(FA,Cs)Pb(I, Br, Cl)3 solar cell at ambient temperatures and under practical
solar concentration. At 100 K, clear evidence of hot carriers is observed in
both the high energy tail of the photoluminescence spectra and from the
appearance of a non-equilibrium photocurrent at higher fluence in light J-V
measurements. At room temperature, however, the presence of hot carriers in the
emission at elevated laser fluence are shown to compete with a gradual red
shift in the PL peak energy as photo induced halide segregation begins to occur
at higher lattice temperature. The effects of thermionic emission of hot
carriers and the presence of a non-equilibrium carrier distribution are also
shown to be distinct from simple lattice heating. This results in large
unsaturated photocurrents at high powers as the Fermi distribution exceeds that
of the heterointerface controlling carrier transport and rectification.

<p>Trapped samples of ultracold molecules are often short-lived, because close

shielding with static electric fields to create repulsive barriers between
polar molecules to prevent such loss. Shielding is very effective even for
RbCs, with a relatively low dipole moment, and even more effective for
molecules such as NaK, NaRb and NaCs, with progressively larger dipoles.
Varying the electric field allows substantial control over the scattering
length, which will be crucial for the stability or collapse of molecular
Bose-Einstein condensates. This arises because the dipole-dipole interaction
creates a long-range attraction that is tunable with electric field. For RbCs,
the scattering length is positive across the range where shielding is
effective, because the repulsion responsible for shielding dominates. For NaK,
the scattering length can be tuned across zero to negative values. For NaRb and
NaCs, the attraction is strong enough to support tetraatomic bound states, and
the scattering length passes through resonant poles where these states cross
threshold. For KAg and CsAg, there are multiple bound states and multiple
poles. For each molecule, we calculate the variation of scattering length with
field and comment on the possibilities for exploring new physics.

<p>Brownian fluctuations arise for any quantity that depends on the stochastic
variables of a Brownian particle. In this study, we explore the Brownian
fluctuations of a bidimensional quadratic potential that exhibits two regimes:
a confining regime and a non-confining regime. We divide the total potential
into two contributions and analyze the mean, variance, skewness, excess
kurtosis, and their distributions for each contribution as well as for the
total potential. Our analysis offers an understanding into the statistical
behavior of each quantity.

<h3>Exchange gap in GdPtBi probed by magneto-optics</h3>

<i>S. Polatkan, E. Uykur, I. Mohelsky, J. Wyzula, M. Orlita, C. Shekhar, C. Felser, M. Dressel, A. V. Pronin</i>
<p>We measured the magneto-reflectivity spectra (4 - 90 meV, 0 - 16 T) of the
triple-point semimetal GdPtBi and found them to demonstrate two unusual broad
features emerging in field. The electronic bands of GdPtBi are expected to
experience large exchange-mediated shifts, which lends itself to a description
via effective Zeeman splittings with a large g factor. Based on this approach,
along with an ab initio band structure analysis, we propose a model Hamiltonian
that describes our observations well and allows us to estimate the effective g
factor, g* = 95. We conclude that we directly observe the exchange-induced
$\Gamma_{8}$ band inversion in GdPtBi by means of infrared spectroscopy.

<h3>Magnetic dynamics driven integer and fractional high harmonic generation  arising from highly nonlinear instantaneous energy levels</h3>

<i>O. Ly</i>
<p>We demonstrate that the strongly nonlinear regime of the magnetic dynamics
driven high harmonic generation (HHG) can be captured through an adiabatic
treatment. Within this approximation, the instantaneous energy levels reveal a
highly nonlinear term that mirrors the high-frequency excitations present in
non-equilibrium transport quantities. Therefore, we find that the revelation of
nonlinear dynamics in the instantaneous energy levels offers a simplified
understanding of HHG in magnetic systems. Additionally, leveraging the highly
nonlinear nature of these instantaneous bands, we predict the emergence of
tunable integer and fractional high harmonics in the presence of a
time-modulated spin-orbit interaction. Our findings, opens up tantalizing
prospects for harnessing HHG in condensed matter systems.

<h3>Mott insulating negative thermal expansion perovskite TiF3</h3>

<p>We characterize perovskite TiF_3, a material which displays significant
negative thermal expansion at elevated temperatures above its
cubic-to-rhombohedral structural phase transition at 330 K. We find the optical
response favors an insulating state in both structural phases, which we show
can be produced in density functional theory calculations only through the
introduction of an on-site Coulomb repulsion. Analysis of the magnetic
susceptibility data gives a S=1/2 local moment per Ti+3 ion and an
antiferromagnetic exchange coupling. Together, these results show that TiF_3 is
a strongly correlated electron system, a fact which constrains possible
mechanisms of strong negative thermal expansion in the Sc_1-xTi_xF3 system. We
consider the relative strength of the Jahn-Teller and electric dipole
interactions in driving the structural transition.

<h3>Giant Resistance Switch in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenide  Tunnel Junctions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08397" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08397</a>

<i>Marc Vila</i>
<p>Resistance switching in multilayer structures are typically based on
materials possessing ferroic orders. Here we predict an extremely large
resistance switching based on the relative spin-orbit splitting in twisted
transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers tunnel junctions. Because of
the valence band spin splitting which depends on the valley index in the
Brillouin zone, the perpendicular electronic transport through the junction
depends on the relative reciprocal space overlap of the spin-dependent Fermi
surfaces of both layers, which can be tuned by twisting one layer. Our quantum
transport calculations reveal a switching resistance of up to $10^6 \%$ when
the relative alignment of TMDs goes from $0^{\circ}$ to $60^{\circ}$ and when
the angle is kept fixed at $60^{\circ}$ and the Fermi level is varied. By
creating vacancies, we evaluate how inter-valley scattering affects the
efficiency and find that the resistance switching remains large ($10^4 \%$) for
typical values of vacancy concentration. Not only this resistance switching
should be observed at room temperature due to the large spin splitting, but our
results show how twist angle engineering and control of van der Waals
heterostructures could be used for next-generation memory and electronic
applications.
