<h3>Energetic cost of microswimmer navigation: the role of body shape</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07301" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07301</a>

We study the energetic efficiency of navigating microswimmers by explicitly
taking into account the geometry of their body. We show that, as their shape
transitions from prolate to oblate, non-steering microswimmers rotated by flow
gradients naturally follow increasingly time-optimal trajectories. At the same
time, they also require larger dissipation to swim. The coupling between body
geometry and hydrodynamics thus leads to a generic trade-off between the
energetic costs associated with propulsion and navigation, which is accompanied
by the selection of a finite optimal aspect ratio. We derive from optimal
control theory the steering policy ensuring overall minimum energy dissipation,
and characterize how navigation performances vary with the swimmer shape. Our
results highlight the important role of the swimmer geometry in realistic
navigation problems.

<br>
<br>
We study a two-dimensional (2D) electron system with a linear spectrum in the
presence of Rashba spin-orbit (RSO) coupling in the hydrodynamic regime. We
derive a semiclassical Boltzmann equation with a collision integral due to
Coulomb interactions in the basis of the eigenstates of the system with RSO
coupling. Using the local equilibrium distribution functions, we obtain a
generalized hydrodynamic Navier-Stokes equation for electronic systems with RSO
coupling. In particular, we discuss the influence of the spin-orbit coupling on
the viscosity and the enthalpy of the system and present some of its observable
effects in hydrodynamic transport.

<h3>One-step Preparation of ZnO Electron Transport Layers Functionalized  with Benzoic Acid Derivatives</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present a "one-step" approach to modify ZnO electron transport layers
(ETLs) used in organic solar cells. This approach involves adding benzoic acid
(BZA) derivatives directly to the ZnO precursor solution, which are then
present at the surface of the resulting ZnO film. We demonstrate this approach
for three different BZA derivatives, namely benzoic acid, chlorobenzoic acid,
and 4-hydrazinobenzoic acid. For all molecules, improved device performance and
stability is demonstrated in solar cells using an active layer blend of PTQ10
(donor) and ITIC-Br (non-fullerene acceptor) compared to such cells prepared
using untreated ZnO. Furthermore, similar or improved device performance and
stability is demonstrated compared to conventional PEIE treatment of ZnO. The
presence of the BZA derivatives at the surface after processing is established
using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and near-edge X-ray absorption
fine-structure spectroscopy. From atomic force microscopy analysis and X-ray
diffraction studies, the addition of BZA derivatives appears to restrict ZnO
grain growth; however, this does not negatively impact device performance. ZnO
layers treated with BZA derivatives also exhibit higher water contact angle and
lower work function compared to untreated ZnO. This approach enables
simplification of device manufacture while still allowing optimization of the
surface properties of metal oxide ETLs. Keywords: electron transport layers,

The electronic band structure is an intrinsic property of solid-state
materials that is intimately connected to the crystalline arrangement of atoms.
Moir\'e crystals, which emerge in twisted stacks of atomic layers, feature a
band structure that can be continuously tuned by changing the twist angle
between adjacent layers. This class of artificial materials blends the discrete
nature of the moir\'e superlattice with intrinsic symmetries of the constituent
materials, providing a versatile platform for investigation of correlated
phenomena whose origins are rooted in the geometry of the superlattice, from
insulating states at "magic angles" to flat bands in quasicrystals. Here we
present a route to mechanically tune the twist angle of individual atomic
layers with a precision of a fraction of a degree inside a scanning probe
microscope, which enables continuous control of the electronic band structure
in-situ. Using nanostructured rotor devices, we achieve the collective rotation
of a single layer of atoms with minimal deformation of the crystalline lattice.
In twisted bilayer graphene, we demonstrate nanoscale control of the moir\'e
superlattice period via external rotations, as revealed using piezoresponse
force microscopy. We also extend this methodology to create twistable boron
nitride devices, which could enable dynamic control of the domain structure of
moir\'e ferroelectrics. This approach provides a route for real-time
manipulation of moir\'e materials, allowing for systematic exploration of the
phase diagrams at multiple twist angles in a single device.

We generalize the Thiele equation with a transverse velocity to the skyrmion
motion described by the collective coordinate of magnetization vector. It is
applied to investigate significant disparity in the existing data sets of
skyrmion and antiskyrmion Hall angles. Our analysis further reveals interesting
differences of these Hall angles near the angular momentum compensation point.
We identify a possible physical quantity that is responsible for the disparity.

<h3>Exciton-polaritons in CsPbBr$_3$ crystals revealed by optical  reflectivity in high magnetic fields and two-photon spectroscopy</h3>

Cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr$_3$) is a representative material of the emerging
class of lead halide perovskite semiconductors that possess remarkable
optoelectronic properties. Its optical properties in the vicinity of the band
gap energy are greatly contributed by excitons, which form exciton-polaritons
due to strong light-matter interactions. We examine exciton-polaritons in
solution-grown CsPbBr$_3$ crystals by means of circularly-polarized reflection
spectroscopy measured in high magnetic fields up to 60 T. The excited 2P
exciton state is measured by two-photon absorption. Comprehensive modeling and
analysis provides detailed quantitative information about the exciton-polariton
parameters: exciton binding energy of 32.5 meV, oscillator strength
characterized by longitudinal-tranverse splitting of 5.3 meV, damping of 6.7
meV, reduced exciton mass of $0.18 m_0$, exciton diamagnetic shift of 1.6
$\mu$eV/T$^2$, and exciton Land\'e factor $g_X=+2.35$. We show that the exciton
states can be well described within a hydrogen-like model with an effective
dielectric constant of 8.7. From the measured exciton longitudinal-transverse
splitting we evaluate the Kane energy of $E_p=15$ eV, which is in reasonable
agreement with values of $11.8-12.5$ eV derived from the carrier effective
masses.

Surface-layer (S-layer) proteins form the outermost envelope in many bacteria
and most archaea and arrange in 2D quasi-crystalline structures via
self-assembly. We investigated S-layer proteins extracted from the archaeon
Pyrobaculum aerophilium with a qPlus sensor-based atomic force microscope (AFM)
in both liquid and ambient conditions and compared it to transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images under vacuum conditions. For AFM scanning, a
next-generation liquid cell and a new protocol for creating long and sharp
sapphire tips was introduced. Initial AFM images showed only layers of residual
detergent molecules (SDS), which are used to isolate the S-layer proteins from
the cells. SDS was not visible in the TEM images, requiring a more thorough
sample preparation for AFM measurements. These improvements allowed us to
resolve the crystal-like structure of the S-layer samples with
frequency-modulation AFM in both air and liquid.

Response theories in condensed matter typically describe the response of an
electron fluid to external electromagnetic fields, while perturbations on
neutral particles are often designed to mimic such fields. Here, we study the
response of fermions to a space-time-dependent velocity field, thereby
sidestepping the issue of a gauge charge. We first develop a semiclassical
chiral kinematic theory that contains a subtle modification of the phase space
measure due to the interplay between the Berry curvature and fluid rotation.
The theory immediately predicts a converse vortical effect, defined as an
orbital magnetization driven by linear velocity. It receives contributions from
magnetic moments on the Fermi surface and Berry curvature of the occupied
bands, with the latter stemming from the modified measure. Then, transcending
semiclassics via a complementary Kubo formalism reveals that the uniform limit
of a clean system receives only the Berry curvature contribution, thus
asserting the importance of the modified measure, while other limits sense the
Fermi surface magnetic moments too. We propose CoSi as a candidate material,
and we suggest conducting magnetometry measurements on a sample under a thermal
gradient to detect the effect. Overall, our study sheds light on the effects of
a space-time-dependent velocity field on electron fluids and paves the way for
exploring quantum materials using new probes and perturbations.

<h3>Elastic Modulus of Polycrystalline Halide Perovskite Thin Films on  Substrates</h3>

Using an innovative combination of multi beam-optical sensor (MOSS) curvature
and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques, the Young's modulus, E, of
polycrystalline MAPbI3 metal-halide perovskite (MHP) thin films attached to two
different types of substrates (SiO2 and Si) is measured to be in the 6.1-6.2
GPa range. This is significantly lower than that of corresponding MAPbI3
single-crystals, which offers a new avenue of tuning E of MHP thin films via
microstructural tailoring for influencing the mechanical reliability of
perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

<h3>Photoinduced High-Chern-Number Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect from  Higher-Order Topological Insulators</h3>

<br>
<br>
Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators with high Chern number host multiple
dissipationless chiral edge channels, which are of fundamental interest and
promising for applications in spintronics and quantum computing. However, only
a limited number of high-Chern-number QAH insulators have been reported to
date. Here, we propose a dynamic approach for achieving high-Chern-number QAH
phases in periodically driven two-dimensional higher-order topological
insulators (HOTIs).In particular, we consider two representative kinds of HOTIs
which are characterized by a quantized quadruple moment and the second
Stiefel-Whitney number, respectively. Using the Floquet formalism for
periodically driven systems, we demonstrate that QAH insulators with tunable
Chern number up to four can be achieved. Moreover, we show by first-principles
calculations that the monolayer graphdiyne, a realistic HOTI, is an ideal
material candidate. Our work not only establishes a strategy for designing
high-Chern-number QAH insulators in periodically driven HOTIs, but also
provides a powerful approach to investigate exotic topological states in
nonequilibrium cases.

Nanomaterials exhibit unique optical phenomena, in particular excitonic
quantum processes occurring at room temperature. The low dimensionality,
however, imposes strict requirements for conventional optical excitation, and
an approach for bypassing such restrictions is desirable. Here we report on
exciton transfer in carbon-nanotube/tungsten-diselenide heterostructures, where
band alignment can be systematically varied. The mixed-dimensional
heterostructures display a pronounced exciton reservoir effect where the
longer-lifetime excitons within the two-dimensional semiconductor are funneled
into carbon nanotubes through diffusion. This new excitation pathway presents
several advantages, including larger absorption areas, broadband spectral
response, and polarization-independent efficiency. When band alignment is
resonant, we observe substantially more efficient excitation via tungsten
diselenide compared to direct excitation of the nanotube. We further
demonstrate simultaneous bright emission from an array of carbon nanotubes with
varied chiralities and orientations. Our findings show the potential of
mixed-dimensional heterostructures and band alignment engineering for energy
harvesting and quantum applications through exciton manipulation.

<h3>Bilayer Kagome Borophene with Multiple van Hove Singularities</h3>

<br>
<br>
The appearance of van Hove singularities near the Fermi level leads to
prominent phenomena, including superconductivity, charge density wave, and
ferromagnetism. Here a bilayer Kagome lattice with multiple van Hove
singularities is designed and a novel borophene with such lattice
(BK-borophene) is proposed by the first-principles calculations. BK-borophene,
which is formed via three-center two-electron (3c-2e) sigma-type bonds, is
predicted to be energetically, dynamically, thermodynamically, and mechanically
stable. The electronic structure hosts both conventional and high-order van
Hove singularities in one band. The conventional van Hove singularity resulting
from the horse saddle is 0.065 eV lower than the Fermi level, while the
high-order one resulting from the monkey saddle is 0.385 eV below the Fermi
level. Both the singularities lead to the divergence of electronic density of
states. Besides, the high-order singularity is just intersected to a Dirac-like
cone, where the Fermi velocity can reach 1340000 m/s. The interaction between
the two Kagome lattices is critical for the appearance of high-order van Hove
singularities. The novel bilayer Kagome borophene with rich and intriguing
electronic structure offers an unprecedented platform for studying correlation
phenomena in quantum material systems and beyond.

<h3>Antiadiabatic Small Polaron Formation in the Charge Transfer Insulator  ErFeO3</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Small polaron formation is dominant across a range of condensed matter
systems. Small polarons are usually studied in terms of ground-state transport
and thermal fluctuations, but small polarons can also be created impulsively by
photoexcitation. The temporal response of the lattice and local electron
correlations can then be separated, such as with transient XUV spectroscopy. To
date, photoexcited small polaron formation has only been measured to be
adiabatic. The reorganization energy of the polar lattice is large enough that
the first electron-optical phonon scattering event creates a small polaron
without significant carrier thermalization. Here, we use transient XUV
spectroscopy to measure antiadiabatic polaron formation by frustrating the
iron-centered octahedra in a rare-earth orthoferrite lattice. The small polaron
is measured to take several picoseconds to form over multiple coherent charge
hopping events between neighboring Fe3+-Fe2+ sites, a timescale that is more
than an order of magnitude longer compared to previous materials. The measured
interplay between optical phonons, electron correlations, and on-site lattice
deformation give a clear picture of how antiadiabatic small polaron transport
would occur in the material. The measurements also confirm the prediction of
the Holstein and Hubbard-Holstein model that the electron hopping integral must
be larger than the reorganization energy to achieve antiadiabaticity. Moreover,
the measurements emphasize the importance of considering dynamical electron
correlations, and not just changes in the lattice geometry, for controlling
small polarons in transport or photoexcited applications.

<h3>Intrinsic time-reversal-even linear displacement Hall effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07145" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07145</a>
<br>
<i>Longjun Xiang, Bin Wang, Yadong Wei, Jian Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
Ruled by the time-reversal-odd ($\mathcal{T}$-odd) nature of linear DC
conductivity, the intrinsic linear Hall effect is forbidden by
$\mathcal{T}$-symmetry. Herein, inspired by the intimate connection between
displacement current and electric polarization, we predict the intrinsic
$\mathcal{T}$-even linear displacement Hall effect (LDHE), which refers to an
intrinsic transverse displacement current response in $\mathcal{T}$-invariant
systems by applying a longitudinal AC electric field. Particularly, we develop
the quantum theory for displacement current under an AC electric field. We find
that the displacement current conductivity (DCC), arising from the AC
polarization, contains both the $\mathcal{T}$-even and $\mathcal{T}$-odd
contributions, which are closely related to the quantum metric and Berry
curvature of Bloch electrons, respectively. Furthermore, by symmetry analysis,
we find that the $\mathcal{T}$-even DCC can favor a transverse component and
hence allows the intrinsic LDHE in $\mathcal{T}$-invariant systems. We also
confirm that our formulation recovers the result of semiclassical theory in the
adiabatic limit. Additionally, guided by symmetry, two models are used to
illustrate our theory. Finally, the candidate materials to capture the
intrinsic LDHE in $\mathcal{T}$-invariant systems are proposed.

<h3>Critical charge and spin instabilities in superconducting  La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07154" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07154</a>

<i>Xuejiao Chen, Peiheng Jiang, Jie Li, Zhicheng Zhong, Yi Lu</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
under high pressure, we explore its potential charge and spin instabilities
through combined model analysis and first-principles calculations. Taking into
account the negative charge-transfer nature of high valence nickel, a fully
correlated two-cluster model identifies a lattice-coupled rocksalt-type charge
instability characterized by substantial fluctuations of oxygen holes. This
instability is corroborated by density-functional-theory plus $U$ calculations
that also reveal a strong tendency towards concurrent antiferromagnetic
ordering. The charge, spin, and associated lattice instabilities are
significantly suppressed with increasing external pressure, contributing to the
emergence of superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Carrier doping
is found to effectively suppress these instabilities, suggesting a viable
strategy to stabilize a superconducting phase under ambient pressure.

<h3>Non-equilibrium phases of Fermi gas inside a cavity with imbalanced  pumping</h3>

<br>
<i>Xiaotian Nie, Wei Zheng</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional
spinless fermions loaded in a cavity with imbalanced pumping lasers. Our study
is motivated by previous work on a similar setup using bosons, and we explore
the unique properties of fermionic systems in this context. By considering the
imbalance in the pumping, we find that the system exhibits multiple
superradiant steady phases and an unstable phase. Furthermore, by making use of
the hysteresis structure of superradiant phases, we propose a unidirectional
topological pumping. Unlike the usual topological pumping in which the driving
protocol breaks time reversal symmetry, the driving protocol can be time
reversal invariant in our proposal.

Correlation and frustration play essential roles in physics, giving rise to
novel quantum phases [1-6]. A typical frustrated system is correlated bosons on
moat bands, which could host topological orders with long-range quantum
entanglement [4]. However, the realization of moat-band physics is still
challenging. Here, we explore moat-band phenomena in shallowly-inverted
InAs/GaSb quantum wells, where we observe an unconventional
time-reversal-symmetry breaking excitonic ground state under imbalanced
electron and hole densities. We find a large bulk gap exists encompassing a
broad range of density imbalance at zero magnetic field (B), accompanied by
edge channels that resemble helical transport. Under an increasing
perpendicular B, the bulk gap persists, and an anomalous plateau of Hall
signals appears, which demonstrates an evolution from helical-like to
chiral-like edge transport with a Hall conductance ~e2/h at 35 Tesla.
Theoretically, we show that strong frustration from density imbalance leads to
a moat band for excitons, resulting in a time-reversal-symmetry breaking
excitonic topological order, which explains all our experimental observations.
Our work opens up a new direction for research on topological and correlated
bosonic systems in solid states beyond the framework of symmetry-protected
topological phases, including but not limited to the bosonic fractional quantum
Hall effect.

<h3>Giant geometry modulation on magnetic proximity effect observed in  isomeric oxide heterostructures</h3>

<br>
<br>
Magnetic proximity effect (MPE) is generally considered to occur at the
magnetic-nonmagnetic material interface within a short-range space domain,
while the structural geometry modulation on such an interface effect has not
been explored. Here, we fabricate isomeric paramagnetic metallic IrO2 with
rutile and anatase structures, respectively, on a ferrimagnetic insulating
CoFe2O4, and study the MPE-induced magnetism by anomalous Hall effect (AHE)
measurements. The rutile phase with layered structure shows a conventional AHE
and identical coercive-field with CoFe2O4, indicating a concomitant magnetic
switching as a result of a strong magnetic coupling at the interface. In
contrast, the anatase phase with tetrahedral structure exhibits an
unconventional AHE with negative coercive-field at low temperatures. Further
analyses indicate that in anatase, the contribution that strongly couples with
CoFe2O4 is dramatically suppressed while a giant frustration-like response
emerges. Our findings reveal that the MPE-induced spin orders can be
pronouncedly modulated by structural geometry.

Information scrambling is nowadays one of the most important topics in
various fields of research. Measurement-only circuit (MoC) exhibits specific
information scrambling dynamics, depending on the types of projective
measurements and their mutual anti-commutativity. The spatial range of the
projective measurements in MoCs gives significant influences on circuit
dynamics. In this work, we introduce and study long-range MoCs, which exhibit
an interesting behavior in their dynamics. In particular, the long-range
measurements can induce volume-law phases in MoCs without unitary time
evolution, which come from anti-commutative frustration of measurements
specific to the long-range MoCs. This phenomenon occurs even in MoCs composed
of solely two-body measurements, and it accompanies an entanglement phase
transition. Crucially, our numerics find evidences that MoCs can be a fast
scrambler. Interplay of high anti-commutativity among measurements and their
long-range properties generates fast entanglement growth in the whole system
beyond linear-light-cone spreading.

<br>
<br>
The electrical polarization switching on stoichiometric GaFeO$_{3}$ single
crystal was measured, and a new model of atomic displacements responsible for
the polarization reverse was proposed. The widely adapted mechanism of
polarization switching in GaFeO$_{3}$ can be applied to stoichiometric,
perfectly ordered crystals. However, the grown single crystals, as well as thin
films of Ga-Fe-O, show pronounced atomic disorder. By piezoresponse force
microscopy, the electrical polarization switching on a crystal surface
perpendicular to the electrical polarization direction was demonstrated. Atomic
disorder in the crystal was measured by X-ray diffraction and M\"ossbauer
spectroscopy. These measurements were supported by ab initio calculations. By
analysis of atomic disorder and electronic structure calculations, the energies
of defects of cations in foreign cationic sites were estimated. The energies of
the polarization switch were estimated, confirming the proposed mechanism of
polarization switching in GaFeO$_{3}$ single crystals.

<h3>Linear and non-linear current response in disordered d-wave  superconductors</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present a detailed theoretical investigation of the linear and non-linear
optical response in a model system for a disordered d-wave superconductor,
showing that for both quantities the gap symmetry considerably changes the
paradigm of the optical response based on the conventional s-wave case. For
what concerns the linear response our findings agree with previous work showing
that in strongly-disordered d-wave superconductors a large fraction of
uncondensed spectral weight survives below Tc, making the optical absorption
around the gap-frequency scale almost unchanged with respect to the normal
state. Our numerical results are in excellent quantitative agreement with
experiments in overdoped cuprates. In the non-linear regime we focus on the
third-harmonic generation (THG), finding that, as already established for the
s-wave case, in general a large THG is triggered by disorder-activated
paramagnetic processes. However, in the d-wave case the BCS response is
monotonously increasing in frequency, loosing any signature of THG enhancement
when the THz pump frequency $\omega$ matches the gap maximum $\Delta$, a
hallmark of previous experiments in conventional s-wave superconductors. Our
findings, along with the mild polarization dependence of the response, provides
an explanation for recent THG measurements in cuprates, setting the framework
for the theoretical understanding of non-linear effects in unconventional
cuprates.

An uncertainty in studying twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) is the minimum
energy geometry, which strongly affects the electronic structure. The minimum
energy geometry is determined by the potential energy surface, which is
dominated by van der Waals (vdW) interactions. In this work, large-scale
diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations are performed to evaluate the
energy of bilayer graphene at various interlayer distances for four stacking
registries. An accurate registry-dependent potential is fit to the QMC data and
is used to describe interlayer interactions in the geometry of near-magic-angle
TBG. The band structure for the optimized geometry is evaluated using the
accurate local-environment tight-binding model. We find that compared to QMC,
DFT-based vdW interactions can result in errors in the corrugation magnitude by
a factor of 2 or more near the magic angle. The error in corrugation then
propagates to the flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene, where the error in
corrugation can affect the bandwidth by about 30% and can change the nature and
degeneracy of the flat bands.

We study the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) caging effect in rhombic exciton-polariton
lattices, with the Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling (RDSOC) in acting a
synthetic gauge field. The effective magnetic flux through each plaquette is
controlled by the orientation of the RDSOC and geometry of the rhombic lattice.
The results show that the interplay of lattice geometry and the RDSOC will
dramatically influence the energy band structure, furthermore, determining the
transportation properties of exciton-polariton condensates. Non-Hermitian
effects, which arise from the polariton intrinsic loss mechanism, on the AB
caging is also discussed in detail. Meanwhile, the effect of disorder on the
dynamics of AB caging is investigated, and we find that the disorder will lead
to the inverse Anderson localization. We propose that using the AB caging
effect allows to trap and steer the propagation of polaritons in a given
parameter regime. Considering the specific example of a photonic liquid crystal
microcavity to achieve our theoretical predictions, the AB caging could be
switched on and off by applying an external voltage.

With the field of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials expanding rapidly,
noncollinear topological magnetic textures in 2D materials are attracting
growing interest recently. As the in-plane counterpart of magnetic skyrmions,
magnetic bimerons have the same topological advantages, but are rarely observed
in experiments. Employing first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo
simulations, we predict that the centrosymmetric transition metal halide CoX2
(X = Cl, Br) monolayers can be promising candidates for observing the
frustration-induced bimerons. These bimerons crystallize into stable triangular
lattice under an appropriate magnetic field. Compared to the skyrmions driven
by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction or the long-ranged magnetic
dipole-dipole interactions, these frustration-induced bimerons have much
smaller size and flexible tunability. Furthermore, the biaxial strain provides
an effective method to tune the frustration and thereby to tune the bimeron
lattice. In detail, for CoCl2 monolayer, tensile strain can be applied to
generate bimeron lattice, further shrink bimeron size and increase the density
of bimerons. For CoBr2 monolayer with inherent bimeron lattice state, a unique
orientation rotation of bimeron lattice controlled by compressive strain is
predicted.

In recent years, much research has been undertaken to investigate the
suitability of two-dimensional materials to act as single-photon sources with
high optical and quantum optical quality. Amongst them, transition-metal
dichalcogenides, especially WSe$_{2}$, have been one of the subjects of
intensive studies. Yet, their single-photon purity and photon
indistinguishability, remain the most significant challenges to compete with
mature semiconducting systems such as self-assembled InGaAs quantum dots. In
this work, we explore the emission properties of quantum emitters in a
WSe$_{2}$ monolayer which are induced by metallic nanoparticles. Under
quasi-resonant pulsed excitation, we verify clean single-photon emission with a
$g^{(2)}(0) = 0.036\pm0.004$. Furthermore, we determine its temperature
dependent coherence time via Michelson interferometry, where a value of
(13.5$\pm$1.0) ps is extracted for the zero-phonon line (ZPL) at 4 K, which
reduces to (9$\pm$2) ps at 8 K. Associated time-resolved photoluminescence
experiments reveal a decrease of the decay time from (2.4$\pm$0.1) ns to
(0.42$\pm$0.05) ns. This change in decay time is explained by a model which
considers a F\"orster-type resonant energy transfer process, which yields a
strong temperature induced energy loss from the SPE to the nearby Ag
nanoparticle.

<h3>Influence of quadrupolar interaction on NMR spectroscopy</h3>

Optically driven electronic spins coupled in quantum dots to nuclear spins
show a pre-pulse signal (revival amplitude) after having been trained by long
periodic sequences of pulses. The size of this revival amplitude depends on the
external magnetic field in a specific way due to the varying commensurability
of the nuclear Larmor precession period with the time $T_\text{rep}$ between
two consecutive pulses. In theoretical simulations, sharp dips occur at fields
when an integer number of precessions fits in $T_\text{rep}$; this feature
could be used to identify nuclear isotopes spectroscopically. But these sharp
and characteristic dips have not (yet) been detected in experiment. We study
whether the nuclear quadrupolar interaction is the reason for this discrepancy
because it perturbs the nuclear precessions. But our simulations show that the
absolute width of the dips and their relative depth are not changed by
quadrupolar interactions. Only the absolute depth decreases. We conclude that
quadrupolar interaction alone cannot be the reason for the absence of the
characteristic dips in experiment.

<h3>Achieving unidirectional propagation of twisted magnons in a magnetic  nanodisk array</h3>

Twisted magnons (TMs) have great potential applications in communication and
computing owing to the orbital angular momentum (OAM) degree of freedom.
Realizing the unidirectional propagation of TMs is the key to design functional
magnonics devices. Here we theoretically study the propagation of TMs in
one-dimensional magnetic nanodisk arrays. By performing micromagnetic
simulations, we find that the one-dimensional nanodisk array exhibits a few
bands due to the collective excitations of TMs. A simple model by considering
the exchange interaction is proposed to explain the emerging multiband
structure and theoretical results agree well with micromagnetic simulations.
Interestingly, for a zigzag structure, the dispersion curves and propagation
images of TMs show obvious nonreciprocity for specific azimuthal quantum number
($l$), which originates from a geometric effect depending on the phase
difference of TMs and the relative angle between two adjacent nanodisks.
Utilizing this feature, one can conveniently realize the unidirectional
propagation of TMs with arbitrary nonzero $l$. Our work provides important
theoretical references for controlling the propagation of TMs.

<h3>Mott-Enhanced Exciton Condensation in a Hubbard bilayer</h3>

We study the conditions to realize an excitonic condensed phase in an
electron-hole bilayer system with local Hubbard-like interactions at
half-filling, where we can address the interplay with Mott localization. Using
Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we find that an excitonic state is stable in a
sizeable region of a phase diagram spanned by the intra-layer (U) and
inter-layer (V) interactions. The latter term is expected to favour the
excitonic phase which is indeed found in a slice of the phase diagram with V >
U . Remarkably, we find that when U is large enough, the excitonic region
extends also for U > V in contrast with naive expectations. The extended
stability of the excitonic phase can be linked to in-layer Mott localization
and inter-layer spin correlations. Using a mapping to a model with attractive
inter-layer coupling, we fully characterize the condensate phase in terms of
its superconducting counterpart, thereby addressing its coherence and
correlation length.

<h3>Dynamical simulation of the injection of vortices into a Majorana edge  mode</h3>

The chiral edge modes of a topological superconductor can transport fermionic
quasiparticles, with Abelian exchange statistics, but they can also transport
non-Abelian anyons: Majorana zero-modes bound to a {\pi}-phase domain wall that
propagates along the boundary. Such an edge vortex is injected by the
application of an h/2e flux bias over a Josephson junction. Existing
descriptions of the injection process rely on the instantaneous scattering
approximation of the adiabatic regime, where the internal dynamics of the
Josephson junction is ignored. Here we go beyond that approximation in a
time-dependent many-body simulation of the injection process, followed by a
braiding of the mobile edge vortex with an immobile Abrikosov vortex in the
bulk of the superconductor. Our simulation sheds light on the properties of the
Josephson junction needed for a successful implementation of a flying Majorana
qubit.

<h3>Rigorous Wilsonian Renormalization Group for impurity models with a  spectral gap</h3>

The Anderson impurity model (AIM) has long served as a cornerstone in the
study of correlated electron systems. While numerical renormalization group
(RG) offers great flexibility for metallic reservoirs, it becomes impossible in
an unbiased way when a spectral gap $\Delta$ opens up in the tunneling density
of states. The only known exception is provided by the superconducting bath. In
this paper, we lift these limitations by a novel numerical RG procedure that
employs a discretization of the gapped tunneling densities of states into
patches which accumulate at the gap edges. This reveals an unusual double
scaling which is a shared behavior by the superconducting and the scalar gapped
AIMs. Moreover, it requires a special iterative diagonalization procedure with
an alternating scheme for discarding states only every second iteration. The
discretization and the diagonalization scheme form together, what we refer to
as, the log-gap numerical RG. It is successfully applied to the superconducting
and to the scalar gapped AIM. Consequently, it reveals that both models belong
to the same RG equivalence class which manifests physically in common
singlet-doublet quantum phase transitions accompanied by in-gap bound states of
given parities. While superconducting AIM is mainly used for benchmarking of
the log-gap numerical RG, we also rigorously confirm the phenomenon of in-gap
states escaping into the continuum, which was recently indirectly considered in
Ref. [1]. The gapped AIM is then tackled in a first ever exact numerical RG
approach and confirms quantitatively assertions based on models with auxiliary
metallic leads [2-5]. Moreover, it reveals that calculations performed in Refs.
[6-8] are of strictly approximate nature.

<h3>Community detection forecasts material failure in a sheared granular  material</h3>

The stability of a granular material is a collective phenomenon controlled by
individual particles through their interactions. Forecasting when granular
materials will undergo an abrupt failure is an ongoing challenge due to the
intricate interactions between particles. Here, we report experiments on
photoelastic disks undergoing intermittent stick-slip dynamics in a quasi-2D
annular shear apparatus, with the evolving network of contact forces made
visible via polarized light. We characterize the system by interpreting the
interparticle forces as a multilayer network, and apply GenLouvin community
detection to identify strongly correlated groups of particles. We observe that
the community structure becomes increasingly volatile as the material
approaches failure, and that this volatility provides a forecast that precedes
what is detectable by considering the forces alone. We additionally observe
that both weak and strong forces contribute to the strength of this forecast.
These findings provide a new approach to detect patterns of causality and
forecast impending failures.
