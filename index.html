<h3>Finite-size effects in hyperuniform vortex matter</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05915" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05915</a>

<p>Novel hyperuniform materials are emerging as an active field of applied and
basic research since they can be designed to have exceptional physical
properties. This ubiquitous state of matter presents a hidden order that is
characterized by the density of constituents of the system being uniform at
large scales, as in a perfect crystal, although they can be isotropic and
disordered like a liquid. In the quest for synthesizing hyperuniform materials
in experimental conditions, the impact of finite-size effects remains as an
open question to be addressed. We use vortex matter in type-II superconductors
as a toy model system to study this issue. We previously reported that vortex
matter nucleated in samples with point disorder is effectively hyperuniform and
thus presents the interesting physical properties inherent to hyperuniform
systems. In this work we present experimental evidence that on decreasing the
thickness of the vortex system its hyperuniform order is depleted. By means of
hydrodynamic arguments we show that the experimentally observed depletion can
be associated to two crossovers that we describe within a hydrodynamic
approximation. The first crossover length is thickness-dependent and separates
a class-II hyperuniform regime at intermediate lengthscales from a regime that
can become asymptotically non-hyperuniform for large wavelengths in very thin
samples. The second crossover takes place at smaller lengthscales and marks the
onset of a faster increase of density fluctuations due to the dispersivity of
the elastic constants. Our work points to a novel mechanism of emerging
hyperuniformity controlled by the thickness of the host sample, an issue that
has to be taken into account when growing hyperuniform structures for
technological applications.

<h3>Discrete Boltzmann model with split collision for combustion with  nonequilibrium effects</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05953" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05953</a>
<br>
</p><i>Chuandong Lin, Kai H. Luo, Huilin Lai</i>
<p>A multi-relaxation-time discrete Boltzmann model (DBM) with split collision
is proposed for both subsonic and supersonic compressible combustion where the
chemical reaction takes place among various components. The physical model is
based on a unified set of discrete Boltzmann equations which describes the
evolution of each chemical species with an adjustable acceleration, specific
heat ratio and Prandtl number. On the righ-hand side of discrete Boltzmann
equations, the collision, force, and reaction terms denote the change rates of
distribution functions due to self- and cross-collisions, external forces, and
chemical reactions. The source terms can be calculated in three ways among
which the matrix inversion method possesses the highest physical accuracy and
computational efficiency. Via the Chapman-Enskog analysis, it is proved that
the DBM is consistent with the reactive Navier-Stokes equations with external
forces, Fick's law and Stefan-Maxwell diffusion equation in the hydrodynamic
limit. Compared with the one-step-relaxation model, the hydrodynamic,
thermodynamic, and chemical nonequilibrium effects can be captured and measured
more detailedly and precisely by the split collision model. Finally, the model
is validated by six benchmarks, i.e., the multicomponent diffusion,
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, mixture in the force field, flame at constant
pressure, opposing chemical reaction, and steady detonation.

<h3>Flat or crumpled: states of active symmetric membranes</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06256" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06256</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sudip Mukherjee, Abhik Basu</i>
<p>We set up and study the hydrodynamic theory for active fluid and tethered
membranes. We focus on those membranes which are inversion-symmetric. We show
that such membranes are either described by appropriate linear hydrodynamic
equations, which are exact in the asymptotic long wavelength limit, giving
stable flat phases with positional quasi long range orders, or be linearly
unstable, implying crumpling of the membranes. We argue that in a such an
active membrane thermal noises dominate over any active noises, and use it to
calculate the correlation functions of the undulation and in-plane
displacements of the membrane in the stable case, and the associated
correlation functions of the embedding bulk flow velocities.

<h3>Attractive Haldane bilayers for trapping non-Abelian anyons</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05622" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05622</a>
<br>
</p><i>Valentin Crépel, Nicolas Regnault</i>
<p>We study the interplay between intrinsic topological order and
superconductivity in a two-component Haldane bilayer, where the two layers are
coupled by an attractive force. We obtain the phase diagram of the model with
exact diagonalization in finite-size, and develop arguments to assess the
stability of the observed phases in the thermodynamic limit. Our main result is
that a finite critical attraction strength is needed to pair fermions forming a
fractional topological order. This behavior can be harnessed to create clean
interfaces between a fractional topological insulator and a superconductor by
gating, wherein non-Abelian parafermionic modes are trapped. We discuss
realization of such interfaces in the bulk of double bilayers of transition
metal dichalcogenides by inhomogenous electrostatic gating, which should
mitigate the spurious effects of disorder and crystalline defects present on
physical edges.

<h3>Multipolar magnetism in $5d^2$ vacancy-ordered halide double perovskites</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05633" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05633</a>
<br>
</p><i>Koushik Pradhan, Arun Paramekanti, Tanusri Saha-Dasgupta</i>
<p>Vacancy-ordered halide double perovskites hosting 4d/5d transition metals
have emerged as a distinct platform for investigating unconventional magnetism
arising out of the interplay of strong atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and
Coulomb interactions. Focusing on the $d^2$ system Cs$_2$WCl$_6$, our ab initio
electronic structure calculation reveals very narrow electronic bands,
fulfilling the necessary condition to realize exotic orders. Using this input,
we solve the many-body spin-orbit coupled single-site problem by exact
diagonalization and show that the multiplet structure of Cs$_2$WCl$_6$ hosts
ground non-Kramers doublets on W, with vanishing dipole moment and a small gap
to an excited magnetic triplet. Our work provides the rationale for the
observed strong deviation from the classic Kotani behaviour in Cs$_2$WCl$_6$
for the measured temperature dependence of the magnetic moment. The non-Kramers
doublets on W exhibit non-zero quadrupolar and octupolar moments, and our
calculated two-site exchange supports the dominance of inter-site octupolar
exchange over quadrupolar interactions. We predict ferro-octupolar order with a
transition temperature $T_c \sim 5$K which may get somewhat suppressed by
quantum fluctuations and disorder; this could be tested in future
low-temperature experiments.

<p>The fuel-driven process of replication in living systems generates
distributions of copied entities with varying degrees of copying accuracy. Here
we introduce a thermodynamically consistent ensemble for investigating
universal population features of replicating systems. In the context of
copolymer copying, coarse-graining over molecular details, we establish a phase
diagram of copying accuracy. We discover sharp non-equilibrium transitions
between populations of random and accurate copies. Maintaining a population of
accurate copies requires a minimum energy expenditure that depends on the
configurational entropy of copolymer sequences.

<h3>Simulating Charged Defects at Database Scale</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05689" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05689</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jimmy-Xuan Shen, Lars F. Voss, Joel Basile Varley</i>
<p>Point defects have a strong influence on the physical properties of
materials, often dominating the electronic and optical behavior in
semiconductors and insulators. The simulation and analysis of point defects is
therefore crucial for understanding the growth and operation of materials
especially for optoelectronics applications. In this work, we present a
general-purpose Python framework for the analysis of point defects in
crystalline materials, as well as a generalized workflow for their treatment
with high-throughput simulations. The distinguishing feature of our approach is
an emphasis on a unique, unitcell, structure-only, definition of point defects
which decouples the defect definition and the specific supercell representation
used to simulate the defect. This allows the results of first-principles
calculations to be aggregated into a database without extensive provenance
information and is a crucial step in building a persistent database of point
defects that can grow over time, a key component towards realizing the idea of
a ``defect genome' that can yield more complex relationships governing the
behavior of defects in materials. We demonstrate several examples of the
approach for three technologically relevant materials and highlight current
pitfalls that must be considered when employing these methodologies, as well as
their potential solutions.

<h3>From electrons to phase diagrams with classical and machine learning  potentials: automated workflows for materials science with pyiron</h3>

<p>We present a comprehensive and user-friendly framework built upon the pyiron
integrated development environment (IDE), enabling researchers to perform the
entire Machine Learning Potential (MLP) development cycle consisting of (i)
creating systematic DFT databases, (ii) fitting the Density Functional Theory
(DFT) data to empirical potentials or MLPs, and (iii) validating the potentials
in a largely automatic approach. The power and performance of this framework
are demonstrated for three conceptually very different classes of interatomic
potentials: an empirical potential (embedded atom method - EAM), neural
networks (high-dimensional neural network potentials - HDNNP) and expansions in
basis sets (atomic cluster expansion - ACE). As an advanced example for
validation and application, we show the computation of a binary
composition-temperature phase diagram for Al-Li, a technologically important
lightweight alloy system with applications in the aerospace industry.

<h3>Systematic assessment of various universal machine-learning interatomic  potentials</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05729" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05729</a>
<br>
</p><i>Haochen Yu, Matteo Giantomassi, Giuliana Materzanini, Gian-Marco Rignanese</i>
<p>Machine-learning interatomic potentials have revolutionized materials
modeling at the atomic scale. Thanks to these, it is now indeed possible to
perform simulations of \abinitio quality over very large time and length
scales. More recently, various universal machine-learning models have been
proposed as an out-of-box approach avoiding the need to train and validate
specific potentials for each particular material of interest. In this paper, we
review and evaluate five different universal machine-learning interatomic
potentials (uMLIPs), all based on graph neural network architectures which have
demonstrated transferability from one chemical system to another. The
evaluation procedure relies on data both from a recent verification study of
density-functional-theory implementations and from the Materials Project.
Through this comprehensive evaluation, we aim to provide guidance to materials
scientists in selecting suitable models for their specific research problems,
offer recommendations for model selection and optimization, and stimulate
discussion on potential areas for improvement in current machine-learning
methodologies in materials science.

<h3>Switching intrinsic magnetic skyrmions with controllable magnetic  anisotropy in van der Waals multiferroic heterostructures</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05747" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05747</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ze-quan Wang, Feng Xue, Liang Qiu, Zhe Wang, Ruqian Wu, Yusheng Hou</i>
<p>Magnetic skyrmions, topologically nontrivial whirling spin textures at
nanometer scales, have emerged as potential information carriers for spintronic
devices. The ability to efficiently create and erase magnetic skyrmions is
vital yet challenging for such applications. Based on first-principles studies,
we find that switching between intrinsic magnetic skyrmion and high-temperature
ferromagnetic states can be achieved in two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW)
multiferroic heterostructure CrSeI/In2Te3 by reversing the ferroelectric
polarization of In2Te3. The core mechanism of this switching is traced to the
controllable magnetic anisotropy of CrSeI influenced by the ferroelectric
polarization of In2Te3. We propose a useful descriptor linking the presence of
magnetic skyrmions to magnetic parameters, and validate this connection through
studies of a variety of similar vdW multiferroic heterostructures. Our work
demonstrates that manipulating magnetic skyrmions via tunable magnetic
anisotropies in vdW multiferroic heterostructures represents a highly promising
and energy-efficient strategy for future development of spintronics.

<p>The superconducting coplanar waveguide (SCPW) cavity plays an essential role
in various areas like superconducting qubits, parametric amplifiers, radiation
detectors, and studying magnon-photon and photon-phonon coupling. Despite its
wide-ranging applications, the use of SCPW cavities to study various van der
Waals 2D materials is relatively unexplored. The resonant modes of the SCPW
cavity exquisitely sense the dielectric environment. In this work, we measure
the charge compressibility of bilayer graphene coupled to a half-wavelength
SCPW cavity. Our approach provides a means to detect subtle changes in the
capacitance of the bilayer graphene heterostructure, which depends on the
compressibility of bilayer graphene, manifesting as shifts in the resonant
frequency of the cavity. This method holds promise for exploring a wide class
of van der Waals 2D materials, including transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs) and their moir\'e where DC transport measurement is challenging.

<p>BaTiS3, a quasi-1D complex chalcogenide, has gathered considerable scientific
and technological interest due to its giant optical anisotropy and electronic
phase transitions. However, the synthesis of high-quality BaTiS3 crystals,
particularly those featuring crystal sizes of millimeters or larger, remains a
challenge. Here, we investigate the growth of BaTiS3 crystals utilizing a
molten salt flux of either potassium iodide, or a mixture of barium chloride
and barium iodide. The crystals obtained through this method exhibit a
substantial increase in volume compared to those synthesized via the chemical
vapor transport method, while preserving their intrinsic optical and electronic
properties. Our flux growth method provides a promising route towards the
production of high-quality, large-scale single crystals of BaTiS3, which will
greatly facilitate advanced characterizations of BaTiS3 and its practical
applications that require large crystal dimensions. Additionally, our approach
offers an alternative synthetic route for other emerging complex chalcogenides.

</p><i>Bhuvaneswari R, Mandar M Deshmukh, Umesh V Waghmare</i>
<p>Magnetic field emerging from the geometric curvature of quantum structure of
electrons in a crystal bends electronic trajectory causing anomalous linear and
nonlinear electrical Hall effects that have been observed in low symmetry
crystals with narrow electronic band gap. We present first-principles
theoretical analysis to show that dynamical lowering of crystal symmetry by
lattice vibrations results in oscillations in the quantum geometry of electrons
which have observable nonlinear Hall signatures. Using these, we introduce a
vibrational spectroscopy based on Geometry of Quantum Electronic Structure
(GQuES) making specific predictions for the transport and radiative GQuES
spectra of 2D materials. As the crystal symmetry is commonly lowered by
dynamical fields, GQuES is applicable to a wide range of materials and
excitations spanning sub-GHz, THz and infrared frequencies.

<h3>Enhanced performance of MoS$_2$/SiO$_2$ field-effect transistors by  hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) encapsulation</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Santu Prasad Jana, Shivangi, Suraina Gupta, Anjan K. Gupta</i>
<p>Scalable methods for improving the performance and stability of a
field-effect transistor (FET) based on two-dimensional materials are crucial
for its real applications. A scalable method of encapsulating the exfoliated
MoS$ _{2} $ on SiO$ _{2} $/Si substrate by hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) is
explored here for reducing the influence of interface traps and ambient
contaminants. This leads to twenty-five times reduction in trap density, three
times decrease in subthreshold swing, three times increase in the peak
field-effect mobility and a drastic reduction in hysteresis. This performance
remains nearly the same after several weeks of ambient exposure of the device.
This is attributed to the superhydrophobic nature of HMDS and the SiO$_2$
surface hydrophobization by the formation of covalent bonds between the methyl
groups of HMDS and silanol groups of SiO$_{2}$.

<h3>What do we learn from impurities and disorder in High Tc cuprates?</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05889" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05889</a>
<br>
</p><i>Henri Alloul</i>
<p>We established that the morphology of the phase diagrams is mostly governed
by disorder in the various cuprate families. In the minimally disordered YBCO
substitutions of Zn or Li spinless impurities on the planar Cu sites control
the extent of the spin glass phase and superconducting (SC) dome. NMR data
establish that these defects induce in their vicinity a cloud with a Kondo like
paramagnetic behavior that differs markedly between the pseudogap and strange
metal regimes. We have studied the evolution of transport properties with
disorder by introduction of a controlled content of in plane vacancies by
electron irradiation. At high T the inelastic scattering of the carriers is
surprisingly disorder independent, and governed by the excitations of the
correlated electronic state. The low T upturns of the resistivity, that are
associated with single impurity Kondo like scattering, agree qualitatively with
the local magnetism induced by spinless impurities. Very large defect contents
are required to induce Metal Insulator Crossovers. In the SC state, the defect
induced reduction of Tc scales quasi linearly with residual resistivity. The
paraconductivity due to SC fluctuations, deduced from high field
magnetoresistance measurements vanishes beyond a temperature T//c and a field
H//c that decrease with increasing defect content. In the pseudogap regime the
weaker decrease of T//c with respect to that of Tc reveals a loss of SC phase
coherence in presence of disorder. This initiates a discussion of its interplay
with pair breaking and allows us to confirm that the family specific dopant
induced disorder or order controls the phase diagram. In the ideal disorder
free cuprate the 2D SC state would certainly persist at low doping. This
ensemble of data provides serious challenges for the theoretical understanding
of superconductivity and the normal state in these SC correlated electron
systems.

<h3>Topological superconductivity with mixed singlet-triplet pairing in  moiré transition-metal-dichalcogenide bilayers</h3>

<p>We investigate strong coupling topological superconductivity in twisted
moir\'e bilayer WSe$_2$. Our approach is based on an effective $t$-$J$ model
with displacement-field-dependent complex hoppings, which is treated with the
variational Gutzwiller projection method. The calculated phase diagram contains
domes of topologically nontrivial superconducting phases, with Chern numbers
$C=\pm 2,\;\pm 4$. The order parameter is characterized by a mixed
$d$+$id$-wave (singlet) and $p$-$ip$-wave (triplet) gap symmetry. We also
report on the appearance of an additional topologically trivial extended
$s$-wave and $f$-wave paired phase. As we show, by changing the electron
density and displacement field, one can tune the singlet and triplet
contributions to the pairing, as well as induce topological phase transitions
between superconducting states characterized by different values of the Chern
number. We analyze the physical origin of the reported effects and discuss it
briefly in the view of new possibilities for designing unconventional
superconductivity in moir\'e systems.

<p>Polymer-like structures are ubiquitous in nature and synthetic materials.
Their configurational and migration properties are often affected by crowded
environments leading to non-thermal fluctuations. Here, we study an ideal Rouse
chain in contact with a non-homogeneous active bath, characterized by the
presence of active self-propelled agents which exert time-correlated forces on
the chain. By means of a coarse-graining procedure, we derive an effective
evolution for the center of mass of the chain and show its tendency to migrate
towards and preferentially localize in regions of high/low bath activity
depending on the model parameters. In particular, we demonstrate that an active
bath with non-uniform activity can be used to separate efficiently polymeric
species with different lengths and/or connectivity.

<br>
</p><i>Vivek Mishra, Ge Wang, P. J. Hirschfeld</i>
<p>There is considerable evidence that the heavy fermion material UTe$_2$ is a
spin-triplet superconductor, possibly manifesting time-reversal symmetry
breaking, as measured by Kerr effect and muon spin resonance experiments below
the critical temperature, in some samples. Such signals can arise due to a
chiral orbital state, or possible nonunitary pairing. Although experiments at
low $T$ appear to be consistent with point nodes in the spectral gap, the
detailed form of the order parameter and even the nodal positions are not yet
determined. Thermal conductivity measurements can extend to quite low
temperatures, with varying heat current direction can therefore provide
information on the order parameter structure. Here we derive a general
expression for the thermal conductivity of a spin triplet superconductor, and
use it to compare the low-temperature behavior of various states proposed for
UTe$_2$.

<h3>Distributed fixed resources exchanging particles: Phases of an  asymmetric exclusion process connected to two reservoirs</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05945" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05945</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sourav Pal, Parna Roy, Abhik Basu</i>
<p>We propose and study a conceptual one-dimensional model to explore how the
combined interplay between fixed resources and particle exchanges between
different parts of an extended system can affect the stationary densities in a
current carrying channel connecting different parts of the system. To this end,
we consider model composed of a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process
(TASEP) in a lattice connecting two particle reservoirs without any internal
dynamics but which can exchange particles, ensuring nonvanishing currents in
the steady states. The total particle number in the system that defines the
``resources'' available, although is kept constant by the model dynamics, but
can take any value independent of the model parameters that define the
dynamical update rules. We show that the resulting phase diagrams of the model
are parametrised by the parameters which define the various dynamical update
rules together with the total available resources. These parameters can be
tuned to make the density on the TASEP lane globally uniform or piecewise
continuous, and can also control populations of the two reservoirs. In general,
the phase diagrams are quite different from a TASEP with open boundaries. In
the limit of large amount of resources, the phase diagrams become topologically
identical to that for an open TASEP.

<h3>Free-standing cubic gauche nitrogen stable at 760 K under ambient  pressure</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Yuxuan Xu, Guo Chen, Fei Du, Ming Li, Liangfei Wu, Deyuan Yao, Junfeng Ding, Zhi Zeng, Haiqing Lin, Xianlong Wang</i>
<p>Cubic gauche nitrogen (cg-N) has received wide attention due to its high
energy density and environmental friendliness. However, existing synthesis
methods for cg-N predominantly rely on the high-pressure techniques, or the
utilization of nanoconfined effects using highly toxic and sensitive sodium
azide as precursor, which significantly restrict the practical application of
cg-N as high energy density materials (HDEM). Here, based on the
first-principles simulations, we find that the adsorption of potassium on the
cg-N surface exhibits superior stabilization compared to sodium. Then, we chose
the safer potassium azide as raw material for synthesizing cg-N. Through
plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition treatment, the free-standing cg-N was
successfully synthesized without the need of high-pressure and nanoconfined
effects. Importantly, it demonstrates excellent thermal stability up to 760 K,
and then a rapid and intense thermal decomposition occurs, exhibiting typical
behaviors of HDEM thermal decomposition. Our work has significantly promoted
the practical application of cg-N as HDEM.

<h3>Hybrid Spin-Orbit Exciton-Magnon Excitations in FePS$_3$</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Ramesh Dhakal, Samuel Griffith, Stephen M. Winter</i>
<p>FePS$_3$ is a layered van der Waals (vdW) Ising antiferromagnet that has
recently been studied in the context of true 2D magnetism, and emerged as an
ideal material platform for investigating strong spin-phonon coupling, and
non-linear magneto-optical phenomena. In this work, we demonstrate an important
unresolved role of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the ground state and
excitations of this compound. Combining first principles calculations with
Linear Flavor Wave Theory (LFWT), we find strong mixing and spectral overlap of
different spin-orbital single-ion states. As such, the low-lying excitations
form complex mixtures of local degrees of freedom most accurately viewed as
hybrid spin-orbit exciton-magnon modes. Complete parameterization of the
resulting low-energy model including all such degrees of freedom requires
nearly half a million coupling constants. Despite this complexity, we show that
such a model can be inexpensively derived using local many-body-based
approaches, which yield quantitative agreement with recent experiments. The
results highlight the importance of SOC even in first row transition metals,
and provide essential insight into the properties of 2D magnets with unquenched
orbital moments.

<p>Harmonic balance (HB) is a popular Fourier-Galerkin method used in the
analysis of nonlinear vibration problems where dynamical systems are subjected
to periodic forcing. We adapt HB to find the periodic steady-state response of
nonlinear differential constitutive models subjected to large amplitude
oscillatory shear flow. By incorporating the alternating-frequency-time scheme
into HB, we develop a computer program called FLASH (acronym for Fast Large
Amplitude Simulation using Harmonic balance), which makes it convenient to
apply HB to any differential constitutive model. We validate FLASH by
considering two representative constitutive models, viz., the exponential
Phan-Thien Tanner model and a nonlinear temporary network model. In terms of
accuracy and speed, FLASH outperforms the conventional approach of solving
initial value problems by numerical integration via time-stepping methods often
by several orders of magnitude. We discuss how FLASH can be conveniently
extended for other nonlinear constitutive models, which opens up potential
applications in model calibration and selection, and stability analysis.

<h3>Training physical matter to matter</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Heinrich M. Jaeger, Arvind Murugan, Sidney R. Nagel</i>
<p>Biological systems offer a great many examples of how sophisticated, highly
adapted behavior can emerge from training. Here we discuss how training might
be used to impart similarly adaptive properties in physical matter. As a
special form of materials processing, training differs in important ways from
standard approaches of obtaining sought after material properties. In
particular, rather than designing or programming the local configurations and
interactions of constituents, training uses externally applied stimuli to
evolve material properties. This makes it possible to obtain different
functionalities from the same starting material (pluripotency). Furthermore,
training evolves a material in-situ or under conditions similar to those during
the intended use; thus, material performance can improve rather than degrade
over time. We discuss requirements for trainability, outline recently developed
training strategies for creating soft materials with multiple, targeted and
adaptable functionalities, and provide examples where the concept of training
has been applied to materials on length scales from the molecular to the
macroscopic.

<h3>Multiphysics Modeling of Surface Diffusion Coupled with Large  Deformation in 3D Solids</h3>

</p><i>Jaemin Kim, Keon Ho Kim, Nikolaos Bouklas</i>
<p>We present a comprehensive theoretical and computational model that explores
the behavior of a thin hydrated film bonded to a non-hydrated / impermeable
soft substrate in the context of surface and bulk elasticity coupled with
surface diffusion kinetics. This type of coupling can manifests as an integral
aspect in diverse engineering processes encountered in optical interference
coatings, tissue engineering, soft electronics, and can prove important in
design process for the next generation of sensors and actuators, especially as
the focus is shifted to systems in smaller lengthscales. The intricate
interplay between solvent diffusion and deformation of the film is governed by
surface poroelasticity, and the viscoelastic deformation of the substrate.
While existing methodologies offer tools for studying coupled poroelasticity
involving solvent diffusion and network deformation, there exists a gap in
understanding how coupled poroelastic processes occurring in a film attached to
the boundary of a highly deformable solid can influence its response. In this
study, we introduce a non-equilibrium thermodynamics formulation encompassing
the multiphysical processes of surface poroelasticity and bulk viscoelasticity,
complemented by a corresponding finite element implementation. Our approach
captures the complex dynamics between the finite deformation of the substrate
and solvent diffusion on the surface. This work contributes valuable insights,
particularly in scenarios where the coupling of surface diffusion kinetics and
substrate elasticity is an important design factor.

<h3>Enhancement of interlayer exciton emission in a TMDC heterostructure via  a multi-resonant chirped microresonator up to room temperature</h3>

<p>We report on multi-resonance chirped distributed Bragg reflector (DBR)
microcavities. These systems are employed to investigate the light-mater
interaction with both intra- and inter-layer excitons of transition metal
dichalcogenide (TMDC) bilayer heterostructures. The chirped DBRs consisting of
SiO2 and Si3N4 layers with gradually changing thickness exhibit a broad
stopband with a width exceeding 600 nm. Importantly, and in contrast to
conventional single-resonance microcavities, our structures provide multiple
resonances across a broad spectral range, which can be matched to spectrally
distinct resonances of the embedded TMDC heterostructures. We study
cavity-coupled emission of both intra- and inter-layer excitons from an
integrated WSe2/MoSe2 heterostructure in a chirped microcavity system. We
observe an enhanced interlayer exciton emission with a Purcell factor of 6.67
+- 1.02 at 4 K. Additionally, we take advantage of cavity-enhanced emission of
the interlayer exciton to investigate its temperature-dependent luminescence
lifetime, which yields a value of 60 ps at room temperature. Our approach
provides an intriguing platform for future studies of energetically distant and
confined excitons in different semiconducting materials, which paves the way
for various applications such as microlasers and single-photon sources by
enabling precise control and manipulation of excitonic interactions utilizing
multimode resonance light-matter interaction.

<h3>Intrinsic magnetism in KTaO$_3$ heterostructures</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Patrick W. Krantz, Alexander Tyner, Pallab Goswami, Venkat Chandrasekhar</i>
<p>There has been intense recent interest in the two-dimensional electron gases
(2DEGs) that form at the surfaces and interfaces of KTaO$_3$ (KTO), with the
discovery of superconductivity at temperatures significantly higher than those
of similar 2DEGs based on SrTiO$_3$ (STO). Like STO heterostructures, these KTO
2DEGs are formed by depositing an overlayer on top of appropriately prepared
KTO surfaces. Some of these overlayers are magnetic, and the resulting 2DEGs
show signatures of this magnetism, including hysteresis in the
magnetoresistance (MR). Here we show that KTO 2DEGs fabricated by depositing
AlO$_x$ on top of KTO also show hysteretic MR, indicative of long range
magnetic order, even though the samples nominally contain no intrinsic magnetic
elements. The hysteresis appears in both the transverse and longitudinal
resistance in magnetic fields both perpendicular to and in the plane of the
2DEG. The hysteretic MR has different characteristic fields and shapes for
surfaces of different crystal orientations, and vanishes above a few Kelvin.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the magnetism likely
arises from Ta$^{4+}$ local moments created in the presence of oxygen
vacancies.

<h3>Implementation and characterization of the dice lattice in the electron  quantum simulator</h3>

</p><i>Camillo Tassi, Dario Bercioux</i>
<p>Materials featuring touching points, localized states, and flat bands are of
great interest in condensed matter and artificial systems due to their
implications in topology, quantum geometry, superconductivity, and
interactions. In this theoretical study, we propose the experimental
realization of the dice lattice with adjustable parameters by arranging carbon
monoxide molecules on a two-dimensional electron system at a (111) copper
surface. First, we develop a theoretical framework to obtain the spectral
properties within a nearly free electron approximation and then compare them
with tight-binding calculations. Our investigation reveals that the high
mobility of Shockley state electrons enables an accurate theoretical
description of the artificial lattice using a next-nearest-neighbor
tight-binding model, resulting in the emergence of a touching point, a
quasi-flat band, and localized lattice site behavior in the local density of
states. Additionally, we present theoretical results for a long-wavelength
low-energy model that accounts for next-nearest-neighbor hopping terms.
Furthermore, we theoretically examine the model's behavior under an external
magnetic field by employing Peierl's substitution, a commonly used technique in
theoretical physics to incorporate magnetic fields into lattice models. Our
theoretical findings suggest that, owing to the exceptional electron mobility,
the highly degenerate eigenenergy associated with the Aharonov-Bohm caging
mechanism may not manifest in the proposed experiment.

<p>A hallmark of unconventional superconductors is their complex electronic
phase diagrams where "intertwined orders" of charge-spin-lattice degrees of
freedom compete and coexist as in copper oxides and iron pnictides. While the
electronic phase diagram of kagome lattice superconductor such as CsV3Sb5 also
exhibits complex behavior involving coexisting and competing charge density
wave order and superconductivity, much is unclear about the microscopic origin
of superconductivity. Here, we study the vortex lattice (VL) in superconducting
state of Cs(V0.86Ta0.14)3Sb5, where the Ta-doping suppresses charge order and
enhances superconductivity. Using small-angle neutron scattering, a strictly
bulk probe, we show that the VL exhibits a strikingly conventional behavior.
This includes a triangular VL with a period consistent with 2e-pairing, a field
dependent scattering intensity that follows a London model, and a temperature
dependence consistent with a uniform superconducting gap expected for s-wave
pairing. These results suggest that optimal bulk superconductivity in
Cs(V1-xTax)3Sb5 arises from a conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer
electron-lattice coupling, different from spin fluctuation mediated
unconventional copper and iron based superconductors.

<h3>X-ray and molecular dynamics study of the temperature-dependent  structure of molten NaF-ZrF4</h3>

<p>The local atomic structure of NaF-ZrF$_4$ (53-47 mol%) molten system and its
evolution with temperature are examined with x-ray scattering measurements and
compared with $ab-initio$ and Neural Network-based molecular dynamics (NNMD)
simulations in the temperature range 515-700 {\deg}C. The machine-learning
enhanced NNMD calculations offer improved efficiency while maintaining accuracy
at higher distances compared to ab-initio calculations. Looking at the
evolution of the Pair Distribution Function with increasing temperature, a
fundamental change in the liquid structure within the selected temperature
range, accompanied by a slight decrease in overall correlation is revealed.
NNMD calculations indicate the co-existence of three different fluorozirconate
complexes: [ZrF$_6$]$^{2-}$, [ZrF$_7$]$^{3-}$, and [ZrF$_8$]$^{4-}$, with a
temperature-dependent shift in the dominant coordination state towards a
6-coordinated Zr ion at 700{\deg}C. The study also highlights the metastability
of different coordination structures, with frequent interconversions between 6
and 7 coordinate states for the fluorozirconate complex from 525 {\deg}C to 700
{\deg}C. Analysis of the Zr-F-Zr angular distribution function reveals the
presence of both $"$edge-sharing$"$ and $"$corner-sharing$"$ fluorozirconate
complexes with specific bond angles and distances in accord with previous
studies, while the next-nearest neighbor cation-cation correlations demonstrate
a clear preference for unlike cations as nearest-neighbor pairs, emphasizing
non-random arrangement. These findings contribute to a comprehensive
understanding of the complex local structure of the molten salt, providing
insights into temperature-dependent preferences and correlations within the
molten system.

<p>The newly discovered Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb and Cs)
continue to bring surprises in generating unusual phenomena and physical
properties, including anomalous Hall effect, unconventional charge density
wave, electronic nematicity and time-reversal symmetry breaking. Here we report
an unexpected emergence of multiple flat bands in the AV$_3$Sb$_5$
superconductors. By performing high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission
(ARPES) measurements, we observed four branches of flat bands that span over
the entire momentum space. The appearance of the flat bands is not anticipated
from the band structure calculations and cannot be accounted for by the known
mechanisms of flat band generation. It is intimately related to the evolution
of van Hove singularities. It is for the first time to observe such emergence
of multiple flat bands in solid materials. Our findings provide new insights in
revealing the underlying mechanism that governs the unusual behaviors in the
Kagome superconductors. They also provide a new pathway in producing flat bands
and set a platform to study the flat bands related physics.

<h3>Dynamical generation of skyrmion and bimeron crystals by a circularly  polarized electric field in frustrated magnets</h3>

</p><i>Ryota Yambe, Satoru Hayami</i>
<p>A skyrmion crystal (SkX) has attracted much attention in condensed matter
physics, since topologically nontrivial structures induce fascinating physical
phenomena. The SkXs have been experimentally observed in a variety of
materials, where the Zeeman coupling to the static magnetic field plays an
important role in the formation of the SkXs. In this study, we theoretically
propose another route to generate the SkXs by using a circularly polarized
electric field. We investigate a non-equilibrium steady state in a classical
frustrated Heisenberg magnet under the circularly polarized electric field,
where the electric field is coupled to the electric polarization via the
spin-current mechanism. By numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
equation at zero temperature, we show that the electric field radiation
generates a SkX with a high topological number in the high-frequency regime,
where the sign of the skyrmion number is fixed to be negative (positive) under
the left (right) circularly polarized field. The intense electric field melts
these SkXs and generates isolated skyrmions. We clarify that the microscopic
origin is effective electric-field-induced three-spin interactions by adopting
the high-frequency expansion in the Floquet formalism. Furthermore, we find
that the electric field radiation generates another type of SkXs, a bimeron
crystal, in the low-frequency regime. Our results provide a way to generate the
SkXs and control the topology by the circularly polarized electric field.

<h3>Periodically driven three-dimensional Kitaev model</h3>

</p><i>Soumya Sasidharan, Naveen Surendran</i>
<p>We study the dynamics of a three-dimensional generalization of Kitaev's
honeycomb lattice spin model (defined on the hyperhoneycomb lattice) subjected
to a harmonic driving of $J_z$, one of the three types of spin-couplings in the
Hamiltonian. Using numerical solutions supported by analytical calculations
based on a rotating wave approximation, we find that the system responds
nonmonotonically to variations in the frequency $\omega$ (while keeping the
driving amplitude $J$ fixed) and undergoes dynamical freezing, where at
specific values of $\omega$, it gets almost completely locked in the initial
state throughout the evolution. However, this freezing occurs only when a
constant bias is present in the driving, i.e., when $J_z = J'+ J\cos{\omega
t}$, with $J'\neq 0$. Consequently, the bias acts as a switch that triggers the
freezing phenomenon. Dynamical freezing has been previously observed in other
integrable systems, such as the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model.

<h3>A Parisi Formula for Quantum Spin Glasses</h3>

<p>We establish three equivalent versions of a Parisi formula for the free
energy of mean-field spin glasses in a transversal magnetic field. These
results are derived from available results for classical vector spin glasses by
an approximation method using the functional integral representation of the
partition function. In this approach, the order parameter is a non-decreasing
function with values in the non-negative, real hermitian Hilbert-Schmidt
operators. For the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, we also show that
under the assumption of self-averaging of the self-overlap, the optimising
Parisi order parameter is found within a two-dimensional subspace spanned by
the self-overlap and the fully stationary overlap.

<h3>Superconductivity in the Fibonacci Chain</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Ying Wang, Gautam Rai, Chris Matsumura, Anuradha Jagannathan, Stephan Haas</i>
<p>Superconductivity was recently reported in several quasicrystalline systems.
These are materials which are structurally ordered, but since they are not
translationally invariant, the usual BCS theory does not apply. At the present
time, the underlying mechanism and the properties of the superconducting phase
are insufficiently understood. To gain a better understanding of quasiperiodic
superconductors, we consider the attractive Hubbard model on the Fibonacci
chain, and examine its low-temperature superconducting phase in detail using
the Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field approach. We obtain superconducting
solutions as a function of the parameters controlling the physical properties
of the system: the strength of the Hubbard attraction $U$, the chemical
potential $\mu$, and the strength of the modulation of the Fibonacci
Hamiltonian, $w$. We find that there is a bulk transition at a critical
temperature that obeys a power law in $U$, where all sites become
superconducting at once. All sites with the Fibonacci chain have the same
superconducting gap width. The local superconducting order parameter is
self-similar both in real and perpendicular space. The interplay between the
Hubbard attraction and the intrinsic gaps of the Fibonacci chain results in a
complex zero-temperature $\mu$-$U$ phase diagram with insulating domes
surrounded by superconducting regions. Finally, we show that tuning $w$ from
weak to strong quasicrystalline modulation gives rise to qualitatively
different thermodynamic behaviors as could be observed by measuring the
specific heat.

<h3>Nonequilibrium Phase Transition in a 2D Ferromagnetic Spins with  Effective Interactions</h3>

<p>We investigate nonequilibrium phase transitions (PTs) in a 2D ferromagnetic
Ising model on a square lattice with effective interactions via Monte Carlo
(MC) based computational algorithms. Possibly, we simplify the generic
complexity of energy function describing the system model to manage the
algorithms. The importance of accounting for the effective interactions to
admit establishing the nature of nonequilibrium PT emphasizes. The existence of
an effective parameter $h$ is verified employing mean-field theory, and the
self-consistent equations (SCEs) are derived based on the two familiar
dynamics$-$Metropolis and Glauber algorithms. The results qualitatively
demonstrate that both dynamics estimate the same SCE for $-1<h<1$. We show the
critical temperature $T_{c}$ of the model {\it with} effective interactions to
be given as $T_{c}(h\neq 0)=4(1+h)/\ln(3 + 2\sqrt{2})$ where
$T_{c}^{0}=T_{c}(h=0)$ retrieves the well-known analytical result of
equilibrium Ising model {\it without} the effective interactions. Furthermore,
we perform Metropolis MC simulations for a finite system of different lattice
sizes with periodic boundary conditions and measure physical quantities of
interest. By using data of the measurements, $T_{c}(h)$ and relevant critical {
\it exponents} for various values of $h$ are determined employing finite-size
scaling (FSS) techniques. The FSS result of $T_{c}(h\neq 0)$ obtained from
numerical data is accurately in agreement with analytical results and quite
different from $T_{c}^{0}$ as expected. Even so, the numerical results of the
exponents are consistent with analytical values of the equilibrium 2D Ising
model$-$belonging to the same universality class.

<p>Two-dimensional (2D) Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) have
attracted much interest due to their exciting quantum properties arising from
their unique two-faced structure, broken-mirror symmetry, and consequent
colossal polarisation field within the monolayer. While efforts have been made
to achieve high-quality Janus monolayers, the existing methods rely on highly
energetic processes that introduce unwanted grain-boundary and point defects
with still unexplored effects on the material's structural and excitonic
properties Through High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy
(HRSTEM), density functional theory (DFT), and optical spectroscopy
measurements; this work introduces the most encountered and energetically
stable point defects. It establishes their impact on the material's optical
properties. HRSTEM studies show that the most energetically stable point
defects are single (Vs and Vse) and double chalcogen vacancy (Vs-Vse),
interstitial defects (Mi), and metal impurities (MW) and establish their
structural characteristics. DFT further establishes their formation energies
and related localized bands within the forbidden band. Cryogenic excitonic
studies on h-BN-encapsulated Janus monolayers offer a clear correlation between
these structural defects and observed emission features, which closely align
with the results of the theory. The overall results introduce the defect genome
of Janus TMDs as an essential guideline for assessing their structural quality

<p>The pyrochlore iridates have become ideal platforms to unravel fascinating
correlated and topolog?ical phenomena that stem from the intricate interplay
among strong spin-orbit coupling, electronic correlations, lattice with
geometric frustration, and itinerancy of the 5d electrons. The all-in-all?out
antiferromagnetic state, commonly considered as the magnetic ground state, can
be dramatically altered in reduced dimensionality, leading to exotic or hidden
quantum states inaccessible in bulk. Here, by means of magnetotransport,
resonant elastic and inelastic x-ray scattering experiments, we discover an
emergent quantum disordered state in (111) Y2Ir2O7 thin films (thickness less
than 30 nm) per?sisting down to 5 K, characterized by dispersionless magnetic
excitations. The anomalous Hall effect observed below an onset temperature near
135 K corroborates the presence of chiral short-range spin configurations
expressed in non-zero scalar spin chirality, breaking the macroscopic
time-reversal symmetry. The origin of this chiral state is ascribed to the
restoration of magnetic frustration on the pyrochlore lattice in lower
dimensionality, where the competing exchange interactions together with
enhanced quantum fluctuations suppress any long-range order and trigger
spin-liquid-like behavior with degenerate ground-state manifold.

<p>Relaxation processes are crucial in understanding the structural
rearrangements of liquids and amorphous materials. However, the overarching
principle that governs these processes across vastly different materials
remains an open question. Substantial analysis has been carried out based on
the motions of individual particles. Here, alternatively, we propose viewing
the global configuration as a single entity. We introduce a global order
parameter, namely the inherent structure minimal displacement (IS Dmin), to
quantify the variability of configurations by a pattern-matching technique.
Through atomic simulations of seven model glass-forming liquids, we unify the
influences of temperature, pressure, and perturbation time on the relaxation
dissipation, via a scaling law between the mechanical damping factor and IS
Dmin. Fundamentally, this scaling reflects the curvature of the local potential
energy landscape. Our findings uncover a universal origin of glassy relaxation
and offer an alternative approach to studying disordered systems.

promising platforms for realizing Majorana zero modes, which are considered as
novel non-Abelian anyons with potential applications in topological quantum

conductance peaks (ZBCPs) in a two-dimensional (2D) magnetic-superconducting
heterostructure consisting of a single-layer chromium diiodide (CrI2) on a
niobium diselenide (NbSe2) superconductor. Single-layer CrI2 nanosheets, which
hold antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground states according to our first-principles
calculations, were epitaxially grown on the layered NbSe2 substrate. By using
scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we observed robust in-gap states
spatially located at the edge of the nanosheets and defect-induced ZBCPs inside
the CrI2 nanosheets. Magnetic-flux vortices induced by an external field
exhibit broken threefold rotational symmetry of the pristine NbSe2
superconductor, implying the efficient modulation of the interfacial
superconducting states by the epitaxial CrI2 layer. A phenomenological model
was proposed and suggested the existence of chiral edge states in a 2D
AFM-superconducting hybrid system with an even Chern number, providing a

<p>Vibrating probes when immersed in a fluid can provide powerful tools for
characterising the surrounding medium. In superfluid 3He-B, a condensate of
Cooper pairs, the dissipation arising from the scattering of quasiparticle
excitations from a mechanical oscillator provides the basis of extremely
sensitive thermometry and bolometry at sub-millikelvin temperatures. The unique
properties of the Andreev reflection process in this condensate also assist by
providing a significantly enhanced dissipation. While existing models for such
damping on an oscillating cylinder have been verified experimentally, they are
valid only for flows with scales much greater than the coherence length of 3He,
which is of the order of a hundred nanometres. With our increasing proficiency
in fabricating nanosized oscillators which can be readily used in this

account for the modification of the flow around these smaller oscillators. Here
we report preliminary results on measurements of the damping in superfluid
3He-B of a range of cylindrical nano-sized oscillators with radii comparable to
the coherence length, and outline a model for calculating the associated drag.

</p><i>Hannah Kleine-Pollmann, Guido Homann, Ludwig Mathey</i>
<p>We present optimal control strategies for the DC transport across a Josephson
junction. Specifically, we consider a junction in which the Josephson coupling
is driven parametrically, with either a bichromatic or a trichromatic driving
protocol, and optimize the prefactor of the 1/$\omega$ divergence of the
imaginary part of the conductivity. We demonstrate that for an optimal
bichromatic protocol an enhancement of 70 can be reached, and for an optimal
trichromatic protocol an enhancement of 135. This is motivated by pump-probe
experiments that have demonstrated light-enhanced superconductivity along the
c-axis of underdoped YBCO, where the junction serves as a minimal model for the
c-axis coupling of superconducting layers. Therefore, the significant
enhancement of superconductivity that we show for multi-frequency protocols
demonstrates that the advancement of pump-probe technology towards these
strategies is highly desirable.

</p><i>Shuaibo Ding, Yunfei Bai, Wenhui Zhang, A. A. Shanenko, Yajiang Chen</i>
<p>The Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states in kagome superconductors have been studied
recently in theory and experiments. However, more details of local
superconductivity around the YSR states in kagome superconductors and the
existence of the related first-order phase transition remain unclear. Based on
the self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for the $s-$wave
superconducting kagome Hubbard model, we show that first-order phase
transitions occur when varying the spin-magnetic interaction $J$ of the
magnetic impurity, and discontinuities of hysteresis loops in the plots of the
local pair potential versus $J$ happen at the upper and lower critical
interactions $J_{\rm c1}$ and $J_{\rm c2}$, rather than the conventional
critical interaction $J_c$. The minimal energy of the stable YSR state $E_{\rm
YSR, min}$ is non-zero for the chemical potential at the van Hove
singularities, Dirac point, and the flat band. Furthermore, $J_{\rm c1}$,
$J_{\rm c2}$, and $E_{\rm YSR, min}$ are dependent on the chemical potential
and the superconducting coupling interaction.

<h3>Emergence of Surface Superconductivity through Interference in  Superconducting-proximity Topological Insulators</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06232" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06232</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yajiang Chen, Ke-Ji Chen, Jia-Ji Zhu, A. A. Shanenko</i>
<p>Superconducting-proximity topological insulators (STIs) have garnered
significant research attention over the past two decades. In this Letter, we
demonstrate that a low-dimensional STI in the topological-nontrivial phase (TP)
exhibits an interference-induced surface (boundary) superconductivity with the
surface critical temperature $T_{cs}$ significantly higher than the bulk one
$T_{cb}$. Such a surface superconductivity is built due to the interference of
the scattering quasiparticle states, rather than due to the presence of the
topological bound states (TBSs). As the system goes deeper into the TP, the
surface exhibits a crossover from the interference- to TBS-induced phase, where
the surface enhancement of superconductivity is governed by the TBSs. Our study
unveils a substantial variation in the maximal $T_{cs}$ along this crossover,
attaining values being twice the maximal bulk critical temperature of the STI.
Beyond shedding light on the nature of surface superconductivity in STIs, our
study introduces a tangible method for experimentally manipulating their
critical superconducting temperatures.

</p><i>S.G. Alekseev, N.I. Polzikova, V.A. Luzanov, S.A. Nikitov</i>
<p>In this work, we present the results of a systematic experimental study of
linear and parametric spin wave resonant excitation accompanied by spin
currents (spin pumping) in a multifrequency composite bulk acoustic wave
resonator with a ZnO-YIG-GGG-YIG/Pt structure. The features of magnetic
dynamics excitation in YIG films due to magnetoelastic coupling with acoustic
thickness modes of various polarizations are studied. Acoustic spin waves and
spin pumping are detected by simultaneous frequency-field mapping of the
inverse spin Hall effect voltage and the resonant frequencies of thickness
extensional modes. In the parametric range of frequencies and fields, acoustic
spin pumping induced by both shear and longitudinal polarization modes was
observed. Linear acoustic spin waves are excited only by shear thickness
extensional modes because longitudinal acoustic waves do not couple with the
magnetic subsystem in linear regime.

</p><i>Marcelo Lapola, Luiz Antonio Barreiro</i>
<p>We examine the analogue gravity model within the context of f(R,T) gravity
applied to graphene. The derivation of the Lagrangian density in two dimensions
(2D) is undertaken, accounting for the altered gravitational effects as
characterized by the function f(R,T). The Lagrangian encompasses the
quasiparticle field $\psi(x)$, its adjoint $\overline{\psi}$, the effective
metric tensor $g^{\mu\nu}$, and the gauge field $A_{\nu}$. The equations of
motion are established through variational principles applied to the
Lagrangian, resulting in modified Dirac equations. We discuss the
interpretation of the additional terms in the equations of motion and their
significance in capturing the modified gravitational dynamics in the graphene
system. Our findings contribute to the understanding of analogue gravity models
and their applications in condensed matter systems.

<p>The exploration of magnetic topological states is instrumental in exploring
axion electrodynamics and intriguing transport phenomena, such as the quantum
anomalous Hall effect. Here, we predict that the recently-synthesized material
Eu$_{3}$In$_{2}$As$_{4}$ exhibits as both an axion insulator and a 3D
Stiefel-Whitney insulator with an altermagnetic order. When spins align in the
$ab$ plane, we find an unpinned surface Dirac cone on the $ab$ plane and chiral
hinge states along the $c$ direction, where hinge states can generate a
half-quantized surface anomalous Hall effect on the $ac$ and $bc$ facets. When
spins align along $c$, we observe a mirror-protected topological crystalline
insulator. Furthermore, the ferromagnetic phase, in which spins are aligned in
the same direction by an external in-plane magnetic field, presents an ideal
Weyl semimetal with a single pair of type-I Weyl points and no extra Fermi
pocket. Our work predicts rich topological states tuned by magnetic structures
in Eu$_{3}$In$_{2}$As$_{4}$, supporting the further study of the topological

<h3>Preparation of Epitaxial Scandium Trifluoride Thin Films using Pulsed  Laser Deposition</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Amani S. Jayakody, Joseph Budnick, Jason N. Hancock, Daniela Morales, Barrett O. Wells</i>
<p>Bulk Scandium trifluoride ($\mathrm{ScF_3}$) is known for a pronounced
negative thermal expansion (NTE) over a wide range of temperature, from
$10~\mathrm{K}~\text{to}~ 1100~\mathrm{K}$. The structure of $\mathrm{ScF_3}$
can be described as an $\mathrm{ABX_3}$ perovskite with an empty A-site and a
space group of Pm-3m. Growing thin films of $\mathrm{ScF_3}$ allows for tuning
the lattice constant, the thermal expansion, and the construction of devices
based upon differential thermal expansion. We have investigated the growth of
$\mathrm{ScF_3}$ films on oxide and fluoride substrates using pulsed laser
deposition (PLD) This letter describes the successful growth recipe for
producing high quality epitaxial $\mathrm{ScF_3}$ thin films on positive
thermal expansion (PTE) lithium fluoride ($\mathrm{LiF}$) substrates, at
substrate temperature, $350^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ with a laser repetition rate of
$1~\mathrm{Hz}$, with an energy per pulse of $600~\mathrm{mJ}$, under a vacuum
of $1.5\times 10^{-6}~ \mathrm{torr}$, for a growth time of $6$ hours. However,
even for films with excellent epitaxy and sharp peaks along the principal axes,
diffraction peaks from certain crystallographic directions are extremely broad,
with the example of ($104$) reflections, in this work. We attribute this
broadening to disorder in the $\mathrm{F_6}$ octahedral rotations that occur as
an attempt to accommodate the large temperature-induced lattice mismatch that
results in cooling from the growth temperature for this system of a NTE film
mated to a PTE substrate.

<h3>Odd-frequency superfluidity from a particle-number-conserving  perspective</h3>

<br>
</p><i>K. Thompson, U. Zülicke, M. Governale, J. Brand</i>
<p>We investigate odd-in-time (or odd-frequency) pairing of fermions in
equilibrium systems within the particle-number-conserving framework of Penrose,
Onsager and Yang, where superfluid order is defined by macrosocopic eigenvalues
of reduced density matrices. We show that odd-frequency pair correlations are
synonymous with even fermion-exchange symmetry in a time-dependent correlation
function that generalises the two-body reduced density matrix. Macroscopic
even-under-fermion-exchange pairing is found to emerge from conventional
Penrose-Onsager-Yang condensation in two-body or higher-order reduced density
matrices through the symmetry-mixing properties of the Hamiltonian. We identify
and characterise a transformer matrix responsible for producing macroscopic
even fermion-exchange correlations that coexist with a conventional Cooper-pair
condensate, while a generator matrix is shown to be responsible for creating
macroscopic even fermion-exchange correlations from hidden orders such as a
multi-particle condensate. The transformer scenario is illustrated using the
spin-imbalanced Fermi superfluid as an example. The generator scenario is
demonstrated by the composite-boson condensate arising for itinerant electrons
coupled to magnetic excitations. Structural analysis of the transformer and
generator matrices is shown to provide general conditions for odd-frequency
pairing order to arise in a given system.

<h3>Active Learning for Rapid Targeted Synthesis of Compositionally Complex  Alloys</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Nathan Johnson, Aashwin Ananda Mishra, Apurva Mehta</i>
<p>The next generation of advanced materials is tending toward increasingly
complex compositions. Synthesizing precise composition is time-consuming and
becomes exponentially demanding with increasing compositional complexity. An
experienced human operator does significantly better than a beginner but still
struggles to consistently achieve precision when synthesis parameters are
coupled. The time to optimize synthesis becomes a barrier to exploring
scientifically and technologically exciting compositionally complex materials.
This investigation demonstrates an Active Learning (AL) approach for optimizing
physical vapor deposition synthesis of thin-film alloys with up to five
principal elements. We compared AL based on Gaussian Process (GP) and Random
Forest (RF) models. The best performing models were able to discover synthesis
parameters for a target quinary alloy in 14 iterations. We also demonstrate the
capability of these models to be used in transfer learning tasks. RF and GP
models trained on lower dimensional systems (i.e. ternary, quarternary) show an
immediate improvement in prediction accuracy compared to models trained only on
quinary samples. Furthermore, samples that only share a few elements in common
with the target composition can be used for model pre-training. We believe that
such AL approaches can be widely adapted to significantly accelerate the
exploration of compositionally complex materials.

<p>The quantum cellular automata (QCA) effect is a transition in which multiple
electron move coordinately by Coulomb interactions and observed in multiple

this paper, we investigate the real-time dynamics of the QCA charge transitions
in a triple quantum dot by using fast charge-state readout realized by rf
reflectometry. We observe real-time charge transitions and analyze the
tunneling rate comparing with the first-order tunneling processes. We also
measure the gate voltage dependence of the QCA transition and show that it can
be controlled by the voltage.

channels (GCs) and the gate barrier layers (BLs). Such bolometers use the
thermionic emission of the hot electrons heated by incident modulated THz
radiation. The hot electron transfer from the GC into the metal gate. As the
THz detectors, these bolometers can operate at room temperature. We show that
the response and ultimate modulation frequency of the GC-FET bolometers are
determined by the efficiency of the hot-electron energy transfer to the lattice
and the GC side contacts due to the 2DEG lateral thermal conductance. The
dependences of these mechanisms on the band structure and geometrical
parameters open the way for the GC-FET bolometers optimization, in particular,
for the enhancement of the maximum modulation frequency.

<p>Compounds from groups IV and V have been the focus of recent research due to
their impressive physical characteristics and structural stability. In this
study, the MX monolayers (M=Sn, Pb; N=P, As) are investigated with
first-principles calculations based on Boltzmann transport theory. The results
show that SnP, SnAs, and PbAs all exhibit indirect band gaps, whereas PbP is
the only semiconductor with a direct band gap. One important finding is that
intravalley scattering has a significant impact on electron-phonon coupling.
Interestingly, changes in carrier concentration do not affect the electron
mobility within these MX monolayers, with SnP exhibiting the highest electron
mobility among them. Subsequently, the SnP under a 6% biaxial strain is further
explored and the results demonstrated a considerable increase in electron
mobility to 2,511.9 cm^2/Vs, which is attributable to decreased scattering.
This suggests that MX monolayers, especially SnP, are promising options for 2D

</p><i>Matthias Maier, Dennis Corraliza, Dionisios Margetis</i>
<p>We study numerically and analytically how the Dyakonov-Shur instability for a
two-dimensional (2D) inviscid electronic fluid in a long channel can be
affected by an external, out-of-plane static magnetic field. By linear
stability analysis for a model based on the shallow-water equations, we
describe the discrete spectrum of frequencies in the complex plane. When the
fluid system is near the subsonic-to-supersonic transition point, a
magnetically controlled gap between the stability and instability spectra of
the complex eigen-frequencies is evident by our computations. This suggests
that the passage from stability to instability (and vice versa) is no longer
continuous in the effective Mach parameter of the boundary conditions. We
connect this complex-valued gap to a multivalued function characterizing the
exact electronic steady state. In a regime of weak magnetic fields, we derive a
scaling law for the eigen-frequencies by perturbation theory. We discuss
implications of our results in efforts to generate terahertz electromagnetic
radiation by 2D electronic transport.

</p><i>Cun Xue, Kai-Wei Cao, Tian He, Chong Wei, Wei Liu, Jun-Yi Ge</i>
<p>Flux jumps observed in high-$J_c$ Nb$_3$Sn conductors are urgent problems to
construct high field superconducting magnets. The low-field instabilities
usually reduce the current-carrying capability and thus cause the premature
quench of Nb$_3$Sn coils at low magnetic field. In this paper, we explore
suppressing the flux jumps by ferromagnetic (FM) layer. Firstly, we
experimentally and theoretically investigate the flux jumps of Nb$_3$Sn/FM
hybrid wires exposed to a magnetic field loop with constant sweeping rate.
Comparing with bare Nb$_3$Sn and Nb$_3$Sn/Cu wires, we reveal two underlying
mechanisms that the suppression of flux jumps is mainly attributed to the
thermal effect of FM layer for the case of lower sweeping rate, whereas both
thermal and electromagnetic effects play a crucial role for the case of higher
sweeping rate. Furthermore, we explore the flux jumps of Nb$_3$Sn/FM hybrid
wires exposed to AC magnetic fields with amplitude $B_{a0}$ and frequency
$\rm\omega$. We build up the phase diagrams of flux jumps in the plane
$\rm\omega$-$B_{a0}$ for bare Nb$_{3}$Sn wire, Nb$_{3}$Sn/Cu wire and
Nb$_{3}$Sn/FM wire, respectively. We stress that the region of flux jumps of
Nb$_{3}$Sn/FM wire is much smaller than the other two wires, which indicates
that the Nb$_{3}$Sn/FM wire has significant advantage over merely increasing
the heat capacity. The findings shed light on suppression of the flux jumps by
utilizing FM materials, which is useful for developing new type of high-$J_c$
Nb$_{3}$Sn conductors.

<p>In nearly free electron theory the imposition of a periodic electrostatic
potential on free electrons creates the bandstructure of a material, determined
by the crystal lattice spacing and geometry. Imposing an artificially designed
potential to the electrons confined in a GaAs quantum well makes it possible to
engineer synthetic two-dimensional band structures, with electronic properties
different from those in the host semiconductor. Here we report the fabrication
and study of a tuneable triangular artificial lattice on a GaAs/AlGaAs
heterostructure where it is possible to transform from the original GaAs
bandstructure and Fermi surface to a new bandstructure with multiple artificial
Fermi surfaces simply by altering a gate bias. For weak electrostatic potential
modulation magnetotransport measurements reveal quantum oscillations from the
GaAs two-dimensional Fermi surface, and classical oscillations due to these
electrons scattering from the artificial lattice. Increasing the strength of
the modulation reveals new quantum oscillations due to the formation of
multiple artificial Fermi surfaces, and ultimately to new classical
oscillations of the electrons from the artificial Fermi surface scattering from
the superlattice modulation. These results show that low disorder gate-tuneable
lateral superlattices can be used to form artificial two dimensional crystals
with designer electronic properties.

<h3>Symmetry Hierarchy and Thermalization Frustration in Graphene  Nanoresonators</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Yisen Wang, Liang Huang</i>
<p>As the essential cause of the intrinsic dissipation that limits the quality
of graphene nanoresonators, intermodal energy transfer is also a key issue in
thermalization dynamics. Typically systems with larger initial energy demand
shorter time to be thermalized. However, we find quantitatively that instead of
becoming shorter, the equipartition time of the graphene nanoresonator can
increase abruptly by one order of magnitude. This thermalization frustration
emerges due to the partition of the normal modes based on the hierarchical
symmetry, and a sensitive on-off switching of the energy flow channels between
symmetry classes controlled by Mathieu instabilities. The results uncover the
decisive roles of symmetry in the thermalization at the nanoscale, and may also
lead to strategies for improving the performance of graphene nanoresonators.

<p>Frustrated magnets offer a plethora of exotic magnetic ground states,
including quantum spin liquids (QSLs), in which enhanced quantum fluctuations
prevent a long-range magnetic ordering of the strongly correlated spins down to
lowest temperature. Here we have investigated the trimer based mixed valence
hexagonal rhodate Ba$_4$NbRh$_3$O$_{12}$ using a combination of dc and ac
magnetization, electrical resistivity, specific heat, and muon spin
rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements. Despite the substantial
antiferromagnetic exchange interactions, as evident from the Weiss temperature
($\theta_{\mathrm{W}}\sim -35$ to -45 K), among the Rh-local moments, neither
long-range magnetic ordering nor spin-freezing is observed down to at least 50
mK, in ac-susceptibility, specific heat and ZF-$\mu$SR measurements (down to
0.26 K). We ascribe the absence of any magnetic transition to enhanced quantum
fluctuations as a result of geometrical frustration arising out of the
edge-sharing equilateral Rh-triangular network in the structure. Our
longitudinal-field $\mu$SR result evidences persistent spin fluctuations down
to 0.26~K, thus stabilizing a dynamic QSL ground state in
Ba$_4$NbRh$_3$O$_{12}$. Furthermore, the magnetic specific heat
($C_{\mathrm{m}}$) data at low-$T$ reveal a significant $T$-linear contribution
plus a quadratic $T$-dependence. A $T$-linear behavior is evocative of gapless
spin excitations, while the $T^2$-term of $C_{\mathrm{m}}$ may indicate the
Dirac QSL phenomenology of the spinon excitations with a linear dispersion.

<p>In the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method, the Pseudo-Random Number Generator
(PRNG) plays a crucial role in determining the computation time. However, the
hidden structure of the PRNG may lead to serious issues such as the breakdown
of the Markov process. Here, we systematically analyze the performance of the
different PRNGs on the widely used QMC method -- stochastic series expansion
(SSE) algorithm. To quantitatively compare them, we introduce a quantity called
QMC efficiency that can effectively reflect the efficiency of the algorithms.
After testing several representative observables of the Heisenberg model in one
and two dimensions, we recommend using LCG as the best choice of PRNGs. Our
work can not only help improve the performance of the SSE method but also shed
light on the other Markov-chain-based numerical algorithms.

term, and results in the so-called quantum double models. Extensive resources
have been invested into the search for $\rm{SU}(2)_k$ anyon quasi-particles; in
particular the so-called Ising anyons ($k=2$) of which Majorana zero modes are
believed to be an incarnation. In contrast to the $\rm{SU}(2)_k$ models,
quantum doubles have attracted little attention in experiments despite their
pivotal role in the theory of error correction. Beyond topological error
correcting codes, the appearance of quantum doubles has been limited to
contexts primarily within mathematical physics, and as such, they are of
seemingly little relevance for the study of experimentally tangible systems.
However, recent works suggest that quantum double anyons may be found in spinor
Bose-Einstein condensates. In light of this, the core purpose of this article
is to provide a self-contained exposition of the quantum double structure,
framed in the context of spinor condensates, by constructing explicitly the
quantum doubles for various ground state symmetry groups and discuss their
experimental realisability. We also derive analytically an equation for the
quantum double Clebsch-Gordan coefficients from which the relevant braid
matrices can be worked out. Finally, the existence of a particle-vortex duality
is exposed and illuminated upon in this context.

<h3>What is a proper definition of spin current? -- Lessons from the  Kane-Mele Model</h3>

<p>Spin current, a key concept in spintronics that carries spin angular
momentum, has a non-unique definition due to the non-conservation of spins in
solids. While two primary definitions exist -- conventional spin current and
conserved spin current -- their validity has not been quantitatively examined.
Here, we examine the validity of these definitions of spin current by comparing
their spin Hall conductivities to the spin accumulation on edges of materials
calculated in a real-time evolution simulation. Employing the Kane-Mele model
with the Rashba term, which explicitly violates spin conservation, we reveal
that the spin Hall conductivities calculated under both definitions fail to
reproduce the simulated results of spin accumulation when the Rashba term is
large. Our results suggest that the standard definitions of spin current and
the associated spin Hall conductivity do not give an accurate quantitative
estimate of spin accumulation. This conclusion indicates that real-time
simulations are necessary to accurately estimate spin accumulation on
edges/surfaces of materials.

topology-stabilized magnetic fluctuations [N. Drucker \textit{et al}., Nat.
Commun. \textbf{14}, 5182 (2023)] in the noncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl
semimetal candidate CeAlGe, we performed systematic studies on the local static
and dynamic spin susceptibilities by $^{27}$Al nuclear magnetic resonance. Due
to the large spin susceptibility from Ce-$4f$ electrons, the theoretically
predicted responses from Weyl fermions are overwhelmed. A Knight-shift anomaly
is observed below $T^*\sim50$ K, a signature of the onset of coherent Kondo
coupling. In addition, an anomalous peak is found in $1/T_1T$ near 15 K, well
above the magnetic ordering temperature $T_N \approx 5$ K, which probably is a
consequence of topology-stabilized magnetic fluctuations. These results
highlight the interplay among electronic correlation, magnetism and band

<p>Thouless charge pumps are quantum mechanical devices whose operation relies
on topology. They provide the means for transporting quantum matter in space
lattices with a single quantum precision. Contrasting space crystals that
spontaneously break a continuous spatial translation symmetry and form crystals
in space,time crystals have emerged as novel states of matter that organize
into time lattices and spontaneously break a discrete time translation
symmetry. The utility of Thouless pumps that enable topologically protected
quantised transport of electrons and neutral atoms in spatial superlattices
leads to the question if corresponding devices exist for time crystals? Here we
show that topological pumps can be realized for time solids by transporting
droplets of a liquid forward and backward in time lattices and we measure the
topological index that characterises such pumping processes. By exploiting a
synthetic time dimension classical time crystals can circumvent the quantum
tunneling that underpins Thouless charge pumps. Our results establish
topological pumping through time instead of space and pave the way for
applications of time crystals.

<p>Spin-squeezing in systems with single-particle control is a well-established

consider dynamic generation of spin-squeezing with ultra-cold bosonic atoms
with two internal states loaded into an optical lattice in the strongly
interacting regime as realized with state-of-the-art experiments using a
quantum gas microscope. We show that anisotropic interactions and inhomogeneous
magnetic fields generate scalable spin-squeezing if their magnitudes are
sufficiently small, but not negligible. The effect of non-uniform filling
caused by hole doping, non-zero temperature and external confinement is studied
at a microscopic level demonstrating their limiting role in the dynamics and
scaling of spin squeezing.

<h3>Ultrafast switching of sliding ferroelectricity and dynamical magnetic  field in van der Waals bilayer induced by light</h3>

<p>Sliding ferroelectricity is a unique type of polarity recently observed in a
properly stacked van der Waals bilayer. However, electric-field control of
sliding ferroelectricity is hard and could induce large coercive electric
fields and serious leakage currents which corrode the ferroelectricity and
electronic properties, which are essential for modern two-dimensional
electronics and optoelectronics. Here, we proposed laser-pulse deterministic
control of sliding ferroelectricity in bilayer h-BN by first principles and
molecular dynamics simulation with machine-learned force fields. The laser
pulses excite shear modes which exhibit certain directional movements of
lateral sliding between bilayers. The vibration of excited modes under laser
pulses is predicted to overcome the energy barrier and achieve the switching of
sliding ferroelectricity. Furthermore, it is found that three possible sliding
transitions - between AB (BA) and BA (AB) stacking - can lead to the occurrence
of dynamical magnetic fields along three different directions. Remarkably, the
magnetic fields are generated by the simple linear motion of nonmagnetic
species, without any need for more exotic (circular, spiral) pathways. Such
predictions of deterministic control of sliding ferroelectricity and
multi-states of dynamical magnetic field thus expand the potential applications
of sliding ferroelectricity in memory and electronic devices.

<p>Antiferromagnetic magnons possess a distinctive feature absent in their
ferromagnetic counterparts: the presence of two distinct handedness modes, the
right-handed (RH) and left-handed (LH) precession modes. The magnon handedness
determines the sign of spin polarization carried by the propagating magnon,
which is indispensable for harnessing the diverse functionalities. However, the
control of coherently propagating magnon handedness in antiferromagnets has
remained elusive so far. Here we demonstrate the manipulation and electrical
readout of propagating magnon handedness in perpendicularly magnetized
synthetic antiferromagnets (SAF). We find that the antiferromagnetic magnon
handedness can be directly identified by measuring the inverse spin Hall effect
(ISHE) voltage, which arises from the spin pumping effect caused by the
propagating antiferromagnetic magnons in the SAF structure. The RH and LH modes
of the magnon can be distinguishable particularly when the SAF structure is
sandwiched by heavy metals with the same sign of spin Hall angle. Moreover, we
succeed in controlling the handedness of propagating antiferromagnetic magnons
by tuning the excitation microwave frequency. This work unveils promising
avenues for harnessing magnon unique properties in antiferromagnet-based
magnonic applications.

<h3>Topological properties of a class of generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger  networks: chains and meshes</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06556" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06556</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sougata Biswas, Arunava Chakrabarti</i>
<p>We analyze the topological properties of a family of generalized
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains and mesh geometries. In both the geometries
the usual staggering in the distribution of the two overlap integrals is
delayed (in space) by the inclusion of a third (additional) hopping term. A
tight-binding Hamiltonian is used to unravel the topological phases,
characterized by a topological invariant. While in the linear chains, the
topological invariant (the Zak phase) always appears to be quantized, in the
quasi-one dimensional strip geometries and the generalized SSH mesh patterns
the quantization of the Zak phase is sensitive to the strength of the
additional interaction (the `extra' hopping integral). We study its influence
thoroughly and explore the edge states and their robustness against disorder in
the cross-linked generalized SSH mesh geometries. The systems considered here
can be taken to model (though crudely) two-dimensional polymers where the
cross-linking brings in non-trivial modification of the energy bands and
transport properties. In addition to the topological features studied, we
provide a prescription to unravel any flat, non-dispersive energy bands in the
mesh geometries, along with the structure and distribution of the compact
localized eigenstates. Our results are analytically exact.

</p><i>Jing-Xin Liu, Jian-Te Wang, Hai-Tao Ding</i>
<p>In this paper, we present a novel experimental approach for simulating and
detecting topological invariants using ultracold fermions confined in
two-dimensional hexagonal optical lattices. We propose achieving two-fold
degenerate four-band models with non-trivial topologies in both the AII and A
classes by introducing additional inertial forces, Raman processes, or periodic
driving. By implementing various quench sequences and observing the evolution
of the time-of-flight pattern, we can gather comprehensive information about
the ground states and determine the topology of the valence bands. Through the
analysis of tomographic results, we are able to extract and calculate the spin
Chern number for both spin-conserving and spin-nonconserving cases.
Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of the quantized topological
invariants and discuss the effects of various experimental parameters.

<h3>Thermoelectric transport of the coexistence topological semimetal in the  quantum limit</h3>

<br>
</p><i>L. W. Guo, C. M. Wang</i>
<p>We explore the thermoelectric transport properties of a coexistence
topological semimetal, characterized by the presence of both a pair of Weyl
points and a nodal ring in the quantum limit. This system gives rise to complex
Landau bands when subjected to a magnetic field aligned with the direction
connecting two Weyl points. In the longitudinal configuration, where the
magnetic field is parallel to the electric field or the temperature gradient,
the thermoelectric conductivity indicates a plateau independent of the magnetic
field and the Fermi energy at $\delta$-form short-range scattering. This
platform structure should also exist in pure two-node Weyl semimetals. However,
the thermoelectric conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient are significantly
influenced by the parameters of long-ranged Gaussian or screened Coulomb
scattering potentials for both fixed carrier density and Fermi energy
scenarios. In the transverse configuration, both Gaussian and screened Coulomb
scatterings yield substantial positive magnetoresistance and thermoelectric
conductance. Since the Hall conductivity is larger than the longitudinal one,
the Seebeck coefficient, exhibiting a quadratic increase with the magnetic
field, is close to the dissipationless limit irrespective of scatterings, while
the Nernst response is notably dependent on the scattering mechanism.
Additionally, the model parameter, distinct from the two-node Weyl model,
influences the thermoelectric transport properties. The magnetic field response
of the thermoelectric coefficients to different scattering potentials can be
used as a basis for distinguishing scattering mechanisms in materials.

</p><i>Qingyuan Zhou, Roland R. Netz, Benjamin A. Dalton</i>
<p>The mean first-passage time (MFPT) is one standard measure for the reaction
time in thermally activated barrier-crossing processes. While the relationship
between MFPTs and phenomenological rate coefficients is known for systems that
satisfy Markovian dynamics, it is not clear how to interpret MFPTs for
experimental and simulation time-series data generated by non-Markovian
systems. Here, we simulate a one-dimensional generalized Langevin equation
(GLE) in a bistable potential and compare two related numerical methods for
evaluating MFPTs: one that only incorporates information about first arrivals
between subsequent states and is equivalent to calculating the waiting time, or
dwell time, and one that incorporates information about all first-passages
associated with a given barrier-crossing event and is therefore typically
employed to enhance numerical sampling. In the Markovian limit, the two methods
are equivalent. However, for significant memory times, the two methods suggest
dramatically different reaction kinetics. By focusing on first-passage
distributions, we systematically reveal the influence of memory-induced rapid
state-recrossing on the MFPTs, which we compare to various other numerical or
theoretical descriptions of reaction times. Overall, we demonstrate that it is
necessary to consider full first-passage distributions, rather than just the
mean barrier-crossing kinetics when analyzing non-Markovian time series data.

<h3>Mapping a dissipative quantum spin chain onto a generalized Coulomb gas</h3>

<p>An XXZ spin chain at zero magnetization is subject to spatially correlated
baths acting as dissipation. We show that the low-energy excitations of this
model are described by a dissipative sine-Gordon field theory, i.e. a
sine-Gordon action with an additional long-range interaction emerging from
dissipation. The field theory is then exactly mapped onto a generalized Coulomb
gas which, in addition to the usual integer charges, displays half-integer
charges that originate from the dissipative baths. These new charges come in
pairs linked by a charge-independent logarithmic interaction. In the Coulomb
gas picture, we identify a Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like phase transition
corresponding to the binding of charges and derive the associated perturbative
renormalization group equations. For superohmic baths, the transition is due to
the binding of the integer charges, while for subohmic baths, it is due to the
binding of the half-integer charges, thereby signaling a dissipation-induced
transition.

<h3>Bulk and interface spin-orbit torques in Pt/Co/MgO thin film structures</h3>

<br>
</p><i>M.S. Gabor, M. Belmeguenai, I.M. Miron</i>
<p>We investigate the origin of spin-orbit torques (SOTs) in archetypical
Pt/Co/MgO thin films structures by performing harmonic Hall measurements. The
behaviour of the damping like (DL) effective field ($h_{DL}$) with varying the
Pt layer thickness and the Co layer thickness indicates that bulk spin-Hall
effect (SHE) in Pt is mainly responsible for DL-SOT. The insertion of a Pd
ultrathin layer at the Pt/Co interface leads to a step decrease in $h_{DL}$,
attributed to the modification of interfacial spin transparency. Further
increase in Pd thickness led to a reduction of the interfacial spin-orbit
coupling (iSOC) quantified by the decrease in the surface magnetic anisotropy.
The consistent insensitivity of $h_{DL}$ to variations in iSOC at the bottom
Pt/Co interface and oxidation at the top Co/MgO interface provides additional
evidence for the bulk SHE origin of DL-SOT. The strong reduction in the
field-like (FL) torque effective field ($h_{FL}$) with decreasing iSOC at the
Pt/Co interface points to the interfacial nature of FL-SOT, either due to iSOC
induced interfacial spin-currents or to the Rashba-Edelstein effect at the
Pt/Co interface. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a FL-SOT develops at the top
Co/MgO interface opposing the one generated at the bottom Pt/Co interface,
whose strength increases with Co/MgO interfacial oxidation, and attributed to
the Rashba-Edelstein effect.

of hot electron injection with a graded conduction band profile and subsequent
filtering of hot and relaxed electrons with rectangular energy barriers. The
number of electron passing the barrier depends exponentially on the transport
length with a mean free path of 200 - 260 nm and reaches ballistic transport
regime for the shortest devices with 70 % of the electrons flying freely
through the base electrode and the barrier reflections limiting the transport

<p>The Bose-Hubbard model (BHM) has been widely explored to develop a profound
understanding of the strongly correlated behavior of interacting bosons.
Quantum simulators not only allow the exploration of the BHM but also extend it
to models with interesting phenomena such as gapped phases with multiple orders
and topological phases. In this work, an extended Bose-Hubbard model involving
a dimerized one-dimensional model of long-range interacting hard-core bosons is
studied. Bond-order density wave phases (BODW) are characterized in terms of
their symmetry breaking and topological properties. At certain fillings,
interactions combined with dimerized hoppings give rise to an emergent
symmetry-breaking leading to BODW phases, which differs from the case of
non-interacting models that require an explicit breaking of the symmetry.
Specifically, the BODW phase at filling $\rho=1/3$ possesses no analogue in the
non-interacting model in terms of its symmetry-breaking properties and the unit
cell structure. Upon changing the dimerization pattern, the system realizes
topologically trivial BODW phases. At filling $\rho=1/4$, on-site density
modulations are shown to stabilize the topological BODW phase. Our work
provides the bridge between interacting and non-interacting BODW phases and
highlights the significance of long-range interactions in a dimerized lattice
by showing unique BODW phases that do not exist in the non-interacting model.

<p>The heavy fermion material UTe$_2$ possesses a rich phase diagram with
multiple superconducting phases, several of which exhibit characteristics of
odd-parity pairing. Here, we report on the pressure dependence of signatures of
the superconducting transition in the temperature dependent ac magnetic
susceptibility $\chi(T)$ in high quality UTe$_2$ single crystals. We resolve a
single superconducting transition in $\chi(T)$ at low pressures $<$ 0.3 GPa. At
higher pressure, however, a second feature emerges in $\chi(T)$, which is
located at the thermodynamic phase boundary between two separate
superconducting states previously identified by specific heat studies. The
observation of a two-step transition in $\chi(T)$ can be understood as a
consequence of the change in the London penetration depth, when UTe$_2$
switches from one superconducting phase into another.

<h3>Beyond Pairwise: Higher-order physical interactions affect phase  separation in multi-component liquids</h3>

</p><i>Chengjie Luo, Yicheng Qiang, David Zwicker</i>
<p>Phase separation, crucial for spatially segregating biomolecules in cells, is
well-understood in the simple case of a few components with pairwise
interactions. Yet, biological cells challenge the simple picture in at least
two ways: First, biomolecules, like proteins and nucleic acids, exhibit
complex, higher-order interactions, where a single molecule may interact with
multiple others simultaneously. Second, cells comprise a myriad of different
components that form various droplets. Such multicomponent phase separation has
been studied in the simple case of pairwise interactions, but an analysis of
higher-order interactions is lacking. We propose such a theory and study the
corresponding phase diagrams numerically. We find that interactions between
three components are similar to pairwise interactions, whereas
composition-dependent higher-order interactions between two components can
oppose phase separation. This surprising result can only be revealed from the
equilibrium phase diagrams, implying that the often-used stability analysis of
homogeneous states is inadequate to study these systems. We thus show that
higher-order interactions could play a crucial role in forming droplets in
cells, and their manipulation could offer novel approaches to controlling
multicomponent phase separation.

<p>Ensemble inequivalence, i.e. the possibility of observing different
thermodynamic properties depending on the statistical ensemble which describes
the system, is one of the hallmarks of long-range physics, which has been
demonstrated in numerous classical systems. Here, an example of ensemble
inequivalence of a long-range quantum ferromagnet is presented. While the $T=0$
microcanonical quantum phase-diagram coincides with that in the canonical
ensemble, the phase-diagrams of the two ensembles are different at finite
temperature. This is in contrast with the common lore of statistical mechanics
of systems with short-range interactions where thermodynamic properties are
bound to coincide for macroscopic systems described by different ensembles. The
consequences of these findings in the context of atomic, molecular and optical
(AMO) setups are delineated.

<p>The current work is focused on the impact of the lithium stoichiometry on
electrical conductivity, acoustic properties and high-temperature stability of
single crystalline Li(Nb,Ta)O$_{3}$ at high temperatures. The crystals grown
from Li-deficient melts were treated by the vapor transport equilibration (VTE)
method, achieving near stoichiometric Li-content. It is shown, that the
VTE-treated specimens generally exhibit lower conductivity at temperatures
below 800 {\deg}C, which is attributed to the reduced number of Li-vacancies in
near stoichiometric Li(Nb,Ta)O$_{3}$, provided that the Li-ion migration
dominates the conductivity in this temperature range. Further, it is shown,
that above 600-650 {\deg}C different mechanism increasingly contributes to the
conductivity, which is consequently attributed to the electronic conduction.
Further, it is shown that losses in LNT strongly increase above about 500
{\deg}C, which is interpreted to originate from conductivity-related relaxation
mechanism. Finally, the thermal stability of Li(Nb,Ta)O$_{3}$ is evaluated by
the measurement of the conductivity and resonance frequency as a function of
time. It is found that during annealing at 700 {\deg}C for 350 hours, the
resonance frequency of LiNbO$_{3}$ remains in a {\textpm} 100 ppm range of the
initial value of 3.5 MHz.

</p><i>Xin Lin, Lijun Zhu</i>
<p>The efficiencies of the spin-orbit torques (SOTs) play a key role in the
determination of the power consumption, integration density, and endurance of
SOT-driven devices. Accurate and time-efficient determination of the SOT
efficiencies is of great importance not only for evaluating the practical
potential of SOT devices but also for developing new mechanisms for enhancing
the SOT efficiencies. Here, we develop a "two-field-scan" harmonic Hall voltage
(HHV) analysis that collects the second HHV as a function of a swept in-plane
magnetic field at 45{\deg} and 0{\deg} relative to the excitation current. We
demonstrate that this two-field-scan analysis is as accurate as the
well-established but time-consuming angle-scan HHV analysis even in the
presence of considerable thermoelectric effects but takes more than a factor of
7 less measurement time. We also show that the 3-parameter fit of the HHV data
from a single field scan at 0{\deg}, which is commonly employed in the
literature, is not reliable because the employment of too many free parameters
in the fitting of the very slowly varying HHV signal allows unrealistic
pseudo-solution and thus erroneous conclusion about the SOT efficiencies.

particle in a shear flow. Subsequently, the effect of adding noise was
investigated. The theory has been applied to colloidal particles,
macromolecules, anisometric granular particles and most recently to
microswimmers, for example bacteria. We study the Jeffery orbits of elongated
particles subject to noise using Langevin simulations and a Fokker-Planck
equation. We extend the analytical solution for infinitely thin needles
($\beta=1$) obtained by Doi and Edwards to particles with arbitrary shape
factor ($0\le \beta\le 1$) and validate the theory by comparing it with
simulations. We examine the rotation of the particle around the vorticity axis
and study the orientational order matrix. We use the latter to obtain scalar
order parameters $s$ and $r$ describing nematic ordering and biaxiality from
the orientational distribution function. The value of $s$ (nematic ordering)
increases monotonically with increasing P\'eclet number, while $r$ (measure of
biaxiality) displays a maximum value. From perturbation theory we obtain simple
expressions that provide accurate descriptions at low noise (or large P\'eclet
numbers). We also examine the orientational distribution in the v-grad v plane
and in the perpendicular direction. Finally we present the solution of the
Fokker-Planck equation for a strictly two-dimensional (2D) system. For the same
noise amplitude the average rotation speed of the particle in 3D is larger than
in 2D.

<h3>A perspective on active glassy dynamics in biological systems</h3>

<p>Dynamics is central to living systems. In the last two decades, experiments
have revealed that the dynamics in diverse biological systems - from
intracellular cytoplasm to cellular and organismal aggregates - are remarkably
similar to that in dense systems of inanimate particles in equilibrium. They
show a glass transition from a solid-like jammed state to a fluid-like flowing
state, where a moderate change in control parameter leads to an enormous
variation in relaxation time. However, biological systems have crucial
differences from the equilibrium systems: the former have activity that drives
them out of equilibrium, novel control parameters, and enormous levels of
complexity. These active systems showing glassy dynamics are known as active
glasses. The field is at the interface of physics and biology, freely borrowing
tools from both disciplines and promising novel, fascinating discoveries. We
review the experiments that started this field, simulations that have been
instrumental for insights, and theories that have helped unify diverse
phenomena, reveal correlations, and make novel quantitative predictions. We
discuss the primary characteristics that define a glassy system. For most
concepts, we first discuss the known equilibrium scenario and then present the
key aspects when activity is introduced. We end the article with a discussion
of the challenges in the field and possible future directions.

<h3>Dynamics of Polyalkylfluorene Conjugated Polymers: Insights from Neutron  Spectroscopy and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06822" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06822</a>

</p><i>Mohamed Zbiri, Anne A. Y. Guilbert</i>
<p>Dynamics of the conjugated polymers poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PF8) and
poly(9,9-didodecylfluorene) (PF12), differing by the length of their side
chains, is investigated in the amorphous phase using the quasielastic neutron
scattering (QENS) technique. The neutron spectroscopy measurements are
synergistically underpinned by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The probe
is focused on the picosecond time scale where the structural dynamics of both
PF8 and PF12 would mainly be dominated by the motions of their side chains. The
measurements highlighted temperature-induced dynamics reflected in the
broadening of the QENS spectra upon heating. The MD simulations reproduced well
the observations, hence the neutron measurements validate the MD force fields,
the adopted amorphous model structures and the numerical procedure. As the QENS
spectra are dominated by the signal from the hydrogens on the backbones and
side chains of PF8 and PF12, extensive analysis of the MD simulations allowed:
(i) tagging these hydrogens, (ii) estimating their contributions to the self
part of the van Hove functions and hence to the QENS spectra, and (iii)
determining the activation energies of the different motions involving the
tagged hydrogens. PF12 is found to exhibit broader QENS spectra than PF8,
signature of a more pronounced motions of the didodecyl chains as compared to
dioctyl chains. This is in agreement with the outcome of our MD analysis: (i)
confirming a lower glass transition temperature of PF12 compared to PF8, (ii)
showing PF12 having a lower density than PF8, and (iii) highlighting lower
activation energies of the motions of PF12 in comparison with PF8. This study
helped gaining insights into the temperature-induced side chains dynamics of
the PF8 and PF12 conjugated polymers influencing their stability, and thus
could practically impact the performance of the associated optoelectronic
active layer.

<h3>Entanglement and logarithmic spirals in a quantum spin-1 many-body  system with competing dimer and trimer interactions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06825" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06825</a>
<br>
</p><i>Huan-Qiang Zhou, Qian-Qian Shi, Ian P. McCulloch, Murray T. Batchelor</i>
<p>Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) with type-B Goldstone modes is
investigated in the macroscopically degenerate phase for a quantum spin-1
many-body system with competing dimer and trimer interactions. The SSB involves
three distinct patterns. The first occurs at the dimer point, with the pattern
from staggered ${\rm SU}(3)$ to ${\rm U}(1)\times{\rm U}(1)$. The second occurs
at the trimer point, with the pattern from uniform ${\rm SU}(3)$ to ${\rm
U}(1)\times{\rm U}(1)$. The third occurs in the dimer-trimer regime, with the
pattern from uniform ${\rm SU}(2)$ to ${\rm U}(1)$. The number of type-B
Goldstone modes is thus two, two and one for the three patterns, respectively.
The ground state degeneracies arising from the three patterns are exponential
with the system size, which may be recognized as sequences of integers relevant
to self-similar logarithmic spirals. This in turn is attributed to the presence
of an emergent symmetry operation tailored to a specific degenerate ground
state. As a consequence, the residual entropy is non-zero, which measures the
disorder present in a unit cell of highly degenerate ground state generated
from a generalized highest weight state. An exact Schmidt decomposition exists
for the highly degenerate ground states, thus exposing the self-similarities
underlying an abstract fractal, described by the fractal dimension. The latter
is extracted from performing a universal finite system-size scaling analysis of
the entanglement entropy, which is identical to the number of type-B Goldstone
modes. The model under investigation thus accommodates an exotic scale
invariant quantum state of matter.

<h3>Orbital relaxation length from first-principles scattering calculations</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Max Rang, Paul J. Kelly</i>
<p>The orbital Hall effect generates a current of orbital angular momentum
perpendicular to a charge current. Experiments suggest that this orbital
current decays on a long length scale that is of the order of the spin flip
diffusion length or longer. We examine this suggestion using first-principles
quantum mechanical scattering calculations to study the decay of orbital
currents injected from an orbitally-polarized lead into thermally disordered
bulk systems of selected transition metals. We find that the decay occurs over
only a few atomic layers. On this length scale the orbital current may be
converted into a spin current if the spin Hall angle is sufficiently large, as
for Pt. In Cu, Cr and V with small spin Hall angles, the conversion into a spin
current is negligible in the bulk and significant conversion only occurs at
interfaces.

<h3>Structure and dielectric properties of BFN-KN solid solutions  synthesized through solution combustion route</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Vijay Khopkar, Balaram Sahoo</i>
<p>We demonstrate that the solution combustion reaction (SCR) route is suitable
for the synthesis of phase pure (x)BaFe0.5Nb0.5O3-(1-x)KNbO3 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4,
0.6, 0.8, 1) (BFN-KN) solid solutions due to atomic level of mixing of
precursors than that of the solid-state reaction (SSR) route. A variation in
composition 'x' of our double perovskite samples leads to a gradual variation
in the structural disorder associated with the disorder in the distribution in
the cationic positions, the lattice strain, and the defects at the grain
boundaries. With the increase in the BFN content in the solid solutions, a
decrease in bandgap and a corresponding change in the color of the samples are
observed. Furthermore, three distinct characteristic features in the
frequency-dependent polarization behavior in our samples are observed at
different frequencies. These features observed to be sustaining up to gradually
increasing frequencies are assigned to (1) the interfacial polarization
originating due to the structural disorder present at the grain boundaries, (2)
the cationic positions leading to tilting/expansion of oxygen octahedra, and
(3) the ionic size mismatch leading to strain distribution. The results are
well supported by the results obtained for the microstructural, structural, and
optical properties of our samples. Hence, our work provides a better
understanding of the dielectric polarization behavior of double perovskites.

<h3>Ising model with non-reciprocal interactions</h3>

</p><i>Agney K. Rajeev, A. V. Anil Kumar</i>
<p>Effective interactions that violate Newton's third law of action-reaction
symmetry are common in systems where interactions are mediated by a
non-equilibrium environment. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are carried out
on a two-dimensional Ising model, where the interactions are modified
non-reciprocally. We demonstrate that the critical temperature decreases as the
non-reciprocity increases and this decrease depends only on the magnitude of
non-reciprocity. Further, travelling spin waves due to the local fluctuations
in magnetisation are observed and these spin waves travel opposite to the
non-reciprocity vector.

<h3>Anderson-Higgs amplitude mode in Josephson junctions</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Pierre Vallet, Jérôme Cayssol</i>
<p>The Anderson-Higgs mode in a superconductor corresponds to a collective and
coherent oscillation of the order parameter amplitude. We propose to detect
this mode in a tunnel Josephson junction between two singlet s-wave diffusive
superconductors. We find a strong enhancement of the tunneling current when the
junction is pumped at the equilibrium gap frequency, corresponding to the
activation of the Anderson-Higgs mode. By solving the Keldysh-Usadel equations,
we obtain current peaks at specific bias voltages that can serve as signatures
of the Anderson-Higgs mode.

<h3>Heat transport in the quantum Rabi model: Universality and ultrastrong  coupling effects</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06909" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06909</a>
<br>
</p><i>L. Magazzù, E. Paladino, M. Grifoni</i>
<p>Heat transport in the quantum Rabi model at weak interaction with the heat
baths is controlled by the qubit-oscillator coupling. Universality of the
linear conductance versus the temperature is found for $T\lesssim T_K$, with
$T_K$ a coupling-dependent Kondo-like temperature. At low temperature, coherent
heat transfer via virtual processes yields a $\sim T^3$ behavior with
destructive interference in the presence of quasi-degeneracies in the spectrum.
As the temperature increases, incoherent emission and absorption dominate and a
maximum is reached at $T\sim T_K/2$. In the presence of a bias on the qubit,
the conductance makes a transition from a resonant to a broad, zero-bias peak
regime. Parallels and differences are found compared to the spin-boson model in
[K. Saito and T. Kato, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{111}, 214301 (2013)], where the
qubit-bath coupling instead of the internal qubit-oscillator coupling rules
thermal transport.

<h3>Memory in cyclically crumpled sheets</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06918" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06918</a>
<br>
</p><i>Amit Dawadi, Arshad Kudrolli</i>
<p>We investigate the crumpling of a sheet as it is repeatedly crushed onto
itself by rolling it into a cylinder and twisting it axially while allowing the
end-to-end length to evolve freely. As deduced from its plastic deformations,
the sheet creases and collapses into structures which repeat and sharpen over
hundreds of cycles to a remarkable degree before forming new configurations.
The observed metastablilty increases with applied cycles leading to recurrent
structures over a significant range of loading, but reconfigurations can
continue to occur for large enough loading as the creases develop tears. The
evolution of the sheet structure as measured by the mean curvature and the
total crease length is found to increase logarithmically with cycle number with
a rate which increases with degree of compression. We explain the overall
extent of creasing using flat folding models, and show the logarithmic growth
as being a consequence of individual creases becoming sharper with number of
folding cycles, and due to the bifurcation in the curvature field leading to
the formation of new creases and folding pathways. Thus, we show that
elastoplastic sheets can follow complex folding pathways to form convergent
structures after a sufficiently large number of training cycles provided
material fatigue remains unimportant.

<h3>Impact of spin torques and spin pumping phenomena on magnon-plasmon  polaritons in antiferromagnetic insulator-semiconductor heterostructures</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Vemund Falch, Jeroen Danon, Alireza Qaiumzadeh, Arne Brataas</i>
<p>We investigate the impact of spin torque and spin pumping on the surface
magnon polariton dispersion in a antiferromagnetic insulator-semiconductor
heterostructure. In the bilayer system, the surface magnon polaritons
conventionally couple to the plasma-oscillations in the semiconductor via
electromagnetic fields. Additionally, magnons in the antiferromagnetic
insulator layer may interact with the semiconductor layer via spin torques and
their reciprocal phenomena of spin pumping. Due to the spin-to-charge
conversion from the spin Hall and inverse spin Hall effects in the
semiconductor layer with a strong spin-orbit coupling, this can couple the
magnons to the plasmons in the semiconductor layer. Our research reveals that
modifications in the mode frequency and the hybridization gap induced by these
phenomena depend on the thickness of the antiferromagnetic layer. In thick
layers, the spin-pumping contribution to the frequency shift and damping is
inversely proportional to the wavelength, while in thin layers it is inversely
proportional to the thickness. Furthermore, hybridization of the surface magnon
polariton and dispersive magnons in the antiferromagnet is shown to depend on
both the thickness and wavelength of the modes.

<h3>Materials science in the era of large language models: a perspective</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Ge Lei, Ronan Docherty, Samuel J. Cooper</i>
<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered considerable interest due to their
impressive natural language capabilities, which in conjunction with various
emergent properties make them versatile tools in workflows ranging from complex
code generation to heuristic finding for combinatorial problems. In this paper
we offer a perspective on their applicability to materials science research,
arguing their ability to handle ambiguous requirements across a range of tasks
and disciplines mean they could be a powerful tool to aid researchers. We
qualitatively examine basic LLM theory, connecting it to relevant properties
and techniques in the literature before providing two case studies that
demonstrate their use in task automation and knowledge extraction at-scale. At
their current stage of development, we argue LLMs should be viewed less as
oracles of novel insight, and more as tireless workers that can accelerate and
unify exploration across domains. It is our hope that this paper can
familiarise material science researchers with the concepts needed to leverage
these tools in their own research.

<h3>Accurate Crystal Structure Prediction of New 2D Hybrid Organic Inorganic  Perovskites</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06955" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06955</a>
<br>
</p><i>Nima Karimitari, William J. Baldwin, Evan W. Muller, Zachary J. L. Bare, W. Joshua Kennedy, Gábor Csányi, Christopher Sutton</i>
<p>Low dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) represent a
promising class of electronically active materials for both light absorption
and emission. The design space of HOIPs is extremely large, since a diverse
space of organic cations can be combined with different inorganic frameworks.
This immense design space allows for tunable electronic and mechanical
properties, but also necessitates the development of new tools for in silico
high throughput analysis of candidate structures. In this work, we present an
accurate, efficient, transferable and widely applicable machine learning
interatomic potential (MLIP) for predicting the structure of new 2D HOIPs.
Using the MACE architecture, an MLIP is trained on 86 diverse experimentally
reported HOIP structures. The model is tested on 73 unseen perovskite
compositions, and achieves chemical accuracy with respect to the reference
electronic structure method. Our model is then combined with a simple random
structure search algorithm to predict the structure of hypothetical HOIPs given
only the proposed composition. Success is demonstrated by correctly and
reliably recovering the crystal structure of a set of experimentally known 2D
perovskites. Such a random structure search is impossible with ab initio
methods due to the associated computational cost, but is relatively inexpensive
with the MACE potential. Finally, the procedure is used to predict the
structure formed by a new organic cation with no previously known corresponding
perovskite. Laboratory synthesis of the new hybrid perovskite confirms the
accuracy of our prediction. This capability, applied at scale, enables
efficient screening of thousands of combinations of organic cations and
inorganic layers.

<h3>Decorrelation of a leader by the increasing number of followers</h3>

</p><i>Satya N. Majumdar, Gregory Schehr</i>
<p>We compute the connected two-time correlator of the maximum $M_N(t)$ of $N$
independent Gaussian stochastic processes (GSP) characterised by a common
correlation coefficient $\rho$ that depends on the two times $t_1$ and $t_2$.
We show analytically that this correlator, for fixed times $t_1$ and $t_2$,
decays for large $N$ as a power law $N^{-\gamma}$ (with logarithmic
corrections) with a decorrelation exponent $\gamma = (1-\rho)/(1+ \rho)$ that
depends only on $\rho$, but otherwise is universal for any GSP. We study
several examples of physical processes including the fractional Brownian motion
(fBm) with Hurst exponent $H$ and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. For the
fBm, $\rho$ is only a function of $\tau = \sqrt{t_1/t_2}$ and we find an
interesting ``freezing'' transition at a critical value $\tau=
\tau_c=(3-\sqrt{5})/2$. For $\tau < \tau_c$, there is an optimal $H^*(\tau) >
0$ that maximises the exponent $\gamma$ and this maximal value freezes to
$\gamma= 1/3$ for $\tau >\tau_c$. For the OU process, we show that $\gamma =
{\rm tanh}(\mu \,|t_1-t_2|/2)$ where $\mu$ is the stiffness of the harmonic
trap. Numerical simulations confirm our analytical predictions.
