<h3>Hamiltonian active particles in the overdamped limit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08903" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08903</a>

<i>Diego Marcel Fieguth</i>

We examine the behaviour of a Hamiltonian particle with a degree of freedom
representing an energy depot in a strongly damped environment, the so called
overdamped limit. Recent papers have shown that this particular Hamiltonian
mechanism, called the Hamiltonian active partilce, can deplete its internal
energy depot to work against external forces. We show that this behaviour
persists in the overdamped limit, although it conceptually differs completely
from the underdamped case. The Hamiltonian active partilce adapts its behaviour
to achieve the same efficiency as before. Additionally we perform a mean
squared displacement analysis for a Brownian environment.

<h3>Taxis of cargo-carrying microswimmers in traveling activity waves</h3>

Many fascinating properties of biological active matter crucially depend on
the capacity of constituting entities to perform directed motion, e.g.,
molecular motors transporting vesicles inside cells or bacteria searching for
food. While much effort has been devoted to mimicking biological functions in
synthetic systems, such as transporting a cargo to a targeted zone, theoretical
studies have primarily focused on single active particles subject to various
spatial and temporal stimuli. Here we study the behavior of a self-propelled
particle carrying a passive cargo in a travelling activity wave and show that
this active-passive dimer displays a rich, emergent tactic behavior. For
cargoes with low mobility, the dimer always drifts in the direction of the wave
propagation. For highly-mobile cargoes, instead, the dimer can also drift
against the traveling wave. The transition between these two tactic behaviors
is controlled by the ratio between the frictions of the cargo and the
microswimmer. In slow activity waves the dimer can perform an active surfing of
the wave maxima, with an average drift velocity equal to the wave speed. These
analytical predictions, which we confirm by numerical simulations, might be
useful for the future efficient design of bio-hybrid microswimmers.

<h3>Frequency-dependent hydrodynamic finite size correction in molecular  simulations reveals the long-time hydrodynamic tail</h3>

Finite-size effects are challenging in molecular dynamics simulations because
they have significant effects on computed static and dynamic properties, in
particular diffusion constants, friction coefficients and time- or
frequency-dependent response functions. We investigate the influence of
periodic boundary conditions on the velocity autocorrelation function and the
frequency-dependent friction of a particle in a fluid and show that the
long-time behavior (starting at the picosecond timescale) is significantly
affected. We develop an analytical correction allowing to subtract the periodic
boundary condition effects. By this we unmask the power-law long-time tails of
the memory kernel and the velocity autocorrelation function in liquid water and
a Lennard-Jones fluid from rather small simulation boxes.

<h3>Ostwald-like ripening in the two-dimensional clustering of passive  particles induced by swimming bacteria</h3>

Clustering passive particles by active agents is a promising route for
fabrication of colloidal structures. Here, we report the dynamic clustering of
micrometric beads in a suspension of motile bacteria. We characterize the
coarsening dynamics for various bead sizes, surface fractions and bacterial
concentrations, and observe a robust cluster growth as $t^{1/3}$ at large time.
From bead tracking measurements, we extract the short-range bacteria-induced
attractive force at the origin of this clustering. We propose a
phenomenological law similar to the Ostwald ripening process, in good agreement
with our experiments.

<h3>Two-way photoeffect-like occupancy dynamics in a single (InGa)As quantum  dot</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09035" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09035</a>
<br>
<i>Pavel Sterin, Kai Hühn, Jens Hübner, Michael Oestreich</i>
<br>
<br>
We extend optical spin noise spectroscopy on single (InGa)As quantum dots to
high magnetic fields at which the splitting between the two optical active
Zeeman branches of the positively charged quantum dot trion transition is
significantly larger than the homogeneous line width. Under such conditions,
the typical theoretical approximations concerning the decoupling of spin and
charge dynamics are in general not valid anymore and the Kerr fluctuations show
significantly richer detuning-dependent features in the spectral region between
the two Zeeman branches. A comparison of the experimental data with an extended
theory suggests that the typical Auger-recombination can be neglected at high
magnetic fields in favour of a probe-laser induced photoeffect that shuffles
not only the resident hole out of the quantum dot but also activates
acceptor-bound holes which recharge the empty quantum dot.

<h3>Generalized Survival Probability</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08512" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08512</a>
<br>
<i>David A. Zarate-Herrada, Lea F. Santos, E. Jonathan Torres-Herrera</i>
<br>
<br>
The survival probability measures the probability that a system taken out of
equilibrium has not yet moved out from its initial state. Inspired by the
generalized entropies used to analyze nonergodic states, we introduce a
generalized version of the survival probability, and discuss how it can assist
studies of the structure of the eigenstates and ergodicity.

<h3>Pair Density Wave Instability in the Kagome Hubbard Model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08517" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08517</a>
<br>
<i>Tilman Schwemmer, Hendrik Hohmann, Matteo Dürrnagel, Janik Potten, Jacob Beyer, Stephan Rachel, Yi-Ming Wu, Srinivas Raghu, Tobias Müller, Werner Hanke, Ronny Thomale</i>
<br>
<br>
We identify a pair density wave (PDW) instability for electrons on the kagome
lattice subject to onsite Hubbard $U$ and nearest neighbor $V$ interactions.
Within our functional renormalization group analysis, the PDW appears with a
concomitant $d$-wave superconducting (SC) instability at zero lattice momentum,
where the PDW distinguishes itself through intra-unit cell modulations of the
pairing function. The relative weight of PDW and $d$-wave SC is influenced by
the absolute interaction strength and coupling ratio $V$/$U$. Parametrically
adjacent to this domain at weak coupling, we find an intra-unit cell modulated
vestigial charge density wave and an $s$-wave SC instability. Our study
provides a microscopic setting for PDW in a controlled limit.

Strong light-matter interactions as realized in an optical cavity provide a
tantalizing opportunity to control the properties of condensed matter systems.
Inspired by experimental advances in cavity quantum electrodynamics and the
fabrication and control of two-dimensional magnets, we investigate the fate of
a quantum critical antiferromagnet coupled to an optical cavity field. Using
unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we compute the scaling behavior of
the magnetic structure factor and other observables. While the position and
universality class are not changed by a single cavity mode, the critical
fluctuations themselves obtain a sizable enhancement, scaling with a fractional
exponent that defies expectations based on simple perturbation theory. The
scaling exponent can be understood using a generic scaling argument, based on
which we predict that the effect may be even stronger in other universality
classes. Our microscopic model is based on realistic parameters for
two-dimensional magnetic quantum materials and the effect may be within the
range of experimental detection.

<h3>Magnetization reversal in FePt thin films: Experiments and simulations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08538" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08538</a>

<br>
<br>
The competition between shape and perpendicular magnetic anisotropies (PMA)
in magnetic thin films gives rise to unusual magnetic behaviors. In
ferromagnetic films with moderate PMA the magnetic domain configuration
transitions from planar to stripe-like domains above a critical thickness,
$t_c$. In this article, we present a detailed study of the magnetization
switching mechanism in FePt thin films, where this phenomenon is observed.
Using micromagnetic simulations and experiments, we found that below $t_c$ the
reversal mechanism is well described by the two-phase model while above this
thickness the magnetization within each stripe reverses by coherent rotation.
We also analyzed the PMA and its temperature dependence, probing that
substrate-induced strains are responsible for the abnormal coercive field
behavior observed for FePt films with $t>t_c$.

<h3>Melting curves of ice polymorphs in the vicinity of the liquid-liquid  critical point</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08540" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08540</a>
<br>
<i>Pablo M. Piaggi, Thomas E. Gartner III, Roberto Car, Pablo G. Debenedetti</i>
<br>
<br>
The possible existence of a liquid-liquid critical point in deeply
supercooled water has been a subject of debate in part due to the challenges
associated with providing definitive experimental evidence. Pioneering work by
Mishima and Stanley [Nature 392, 164 (1998) and Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 334
(2000)] sought to shed light on this problem by studying the melting curves of
different ice polymorphs and their metastable continuation in the vicinity of
the expected location of the liquid-liquid transition and its associated
critical point. Based on the continuous or discontinuous changes in slope of
the melting curves, Mishima suggested that the liquid-liquid critical point
lies between the melting curves of ice III and ice V. Here, we explore this
conjecture using molecular dynamics simulations with a purely-predictive
machine learning model based on ab initio quantum-mechanical calculations. We
study the melting curves of ices III, IV, V, VI, and XIII using this model and
find that the melting lines of all the studied ice polymorphs are supercritical
and do not intersect the liquid-liquid transition locus. We also find a
pronounced, yet continuous, change in slope of the melting lines upon crossing
of the locus of maximum compressibility of the liquid. Finally, we analyze
critically the literature in light of our findings, and conclude that the
scenario in which melting curves are supercritical is favored by the most
recent computational and experimental evidence. Thus, although the
preponderance of experimental and computational evidence is consistent with the
existence of a second critical point in water, the behavior of the melting
lines of ice polymorphs does not provide strong evidence in support of this
viewpoint, according to our calculations.

<h3>First-principles calculations of magnetic states in pyrochlores using a  source-corrected exchange and correlation functional</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present a first-principles investigation of the spin-ice state in
Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ using a magnetic source-free exchange and correlation
functional, implemented in the Castep electronic-structure code. By comparing
results from the conventional local spin-density approximation, we show that a
spin-ice state in Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ can be reliably obtained by removing the
magnetic sources from the exchange and correlation contributions to the
potential, and we contrast this against the computed ground states of other
frustrated pyrochlore magnets.

<h3>Anharmonic Terms of the Potential Energy Surface: A Group Theoretical  Approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08615" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08615</a>
<br>
<i>Davide Mitoli, Jefferson Maul, Alessandro Erba</i>
<br>
<br>
In the framework of density functional theory (DFT) simulations of molecules
and materials, anharmonic terms of the potential energy surface are commonly
computed numerically, with an associated cost that rapidly increases with the
size of the system. Recently, an efficient approach to calculate cubic and
quartic interatomic force constants in the basis of normal modes [Theor. Chem.
Acc., 120, 23 (2008)] was implemented in the Crystal program [J. Chem. Theory
Comput., 15, 3755-3765 (2019)]. By applying group theory, we are able to
further reduce the associated computational cost, as the exploitation of point
symmetry can significantly reduce the number of distinct atomically displaced
nuclear configurations to be explicitly explored for energy and forces
calculations. Our strategy stems from Wigner's theorem and the fact that normal
modes are bases of the irreducible representations (irreps) of the point group.
The proposed group theoretical approach is implemented in the Crystal program
and its efficiency assessed on six test case systems: four molecules (methane,
CH4; tetrahedrane, C4H4; cyclo-exasulfur, S6; cubane, C8H8), and two
three-dimensional crystals (Magnesium oxide, MgO; and a prototypical
Zinc-imidazolate framework, ZIF-8). The speedup imparted by this approach is
consistently very large in all high-symmetry molecular and periodic systems,
peaking at 76% for MgO.

The phenomenon of high temperature superconductivity, approaching room
temperature, has been realized in a number of hydrogen-dominant alloy systems
under high pressure conditions1-12. A significant discovery in reaching room
temperature superconductivity is the photo-induced reaction of sulfur,
hydrogen, and carbon that initially forms of van der Waals solids at
sub-megabar pressures. Carbonaceous sulfur hydride has been demonstrated to be
tunable with respect to carbon content, leading to different superconducting
final states with different structural symmetries. A modulated AC
susceptibility technique adapted for a diamond anvil cell confirms a Tc of 260
kelvin at 133 GPa in carbonaceous sulfur hydride. Furthermore, direct
synchrotron infrared reflectivity measurements on the same sample under the
same conditions reveal a superconducting gap of ~85 meV at 100 K in close
agreement to the expected value from Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)
theory13-18. Additionally, x-ray diffraction in tandem with AC magnetic
susceptibility measurements above and below the superconducting transition
temperature, and as a function of pressure at 107-133 GPa, reveal the Pnma
structure of the material is responsible for the close to room-temperature
superconductivity at these pressures.

<h3>Spark plasma sintering synthesis of ReB2-type medium-entropy diboride  (W1/3Re1/3Ru1/3)B2 with high hardness</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08654" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08654</a>
<br>
<i>Wuzhang Yang, Guorui Xiao, Zhi Ren</i>
<br>
<br>
A new medium-entropy diboride (MEDB) (W1/3Re1/3Ru1/3)B2 has been synthesized
by spark plasma sintering of elemental powders at 1600 oC. Despite the
dissimilar structures of WB2, ReB2 and RuB2, the sintered MEDB consists of a
single hexagonal ReB2-type phase (space group P63/mmc) with a relative density
of 94.2% and an average grain size of 6.8 $\pm$ 2.2 um. Structural refinement
and electron microscopy measurements show that the W, Re, and Ru atoms occupy
the same crystallographic site and are distributed uniformly in the lattice.
The (W1/3Re1/3Ru1/3)B2 MEDB has Vickers hardnesses of 30.7 GPa at a load of
0.49 N and 20.5 GPa at a load of 9.8 N, which are comparable or higher than
those reported for individual binary counterparts.

<h3>Control of the magnon-polariton hybridization with a microwave pump</h3>

<br>
<br>
Pump-induced magnon modes (PIMs) are recently discovered elementary
excitations in ferrimagnets that offer significant tunability to spin dynamics.
Here, we investigate the strong interaction between a PIM and cavity magnon
polaritons (CMPs) by driving a cavity magnonic system away from equilibrium
with a microwave pump. In our experiment, the Walker mode simultaneously
couples with the PIM and cavity photons and thus combines two strongly coherent
coupling processes in a single cavity structure. Such a PIM-CMP hybridization
system acquires complementary properties from both the PIM and CMPs, allowing
it to be freely manipulated by the magnetic field, the pump power and the pump
frequency. These coherent manipulations exhibit unique behaviors beyond the
intrinsic properties limited by the material nature and electromagnetic
boundary conditions, thereby creating opportunities for extending the control
of hybrid devices.

<h3>Inverse-current quantum electro-oscillations in a charge-density wave  insulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08677" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08677</a>

<br>
<br>
Quantum magneto-oscillations have long been a vital subject in condensed
matter physics with ubiquitous quantum phenomena and various underlying
physical mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate the intrinsic and reproducible
d.c.-currentdriven quantum electro-oscillations with a periodicity in the
inverse of current (1/I), in quasi-one-dimensional charge-density-wave (CDW)
insulator (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I and TaS$_3$ nanowires. Such oscillations manifest in
the nearly infinite Frohlich conductivity region where the CDW depinning occurs
in a finite electric current, and finally disappear after the oscillation index
n reaches 1. A systematic investigation on the effect of temperature and
magnetic field establishes that the observed electro-oscillations are a
coherent quantum phenomenon. A possible mechanism is proposed based on
zero-phason-assisted resonant tunneling, associated with sliding-driven
inherent Floquet sidebands. Our results introduce a new member in the quantum
oscillations family, and shed light on plausible routes to explore novel
physics and potential applications of coherent density-wave condensates.

<h3>Complex strengthening mechanisms in nanocrystalline Ni-Mo alloys  revealed by a machine-learning interatomic potential</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08698" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08698</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
A nanocrystalline metal's strength increases significantly as its grain size
decreases, a phenomenon known as the Hall-Petch relation. Such relation,
however, breaks down when the grains become too small. Experimental studies
have circumvented this problem in a set of Ni-Mo alloys by stabilizing the
grain boundaries (GB). Here, using atomistic simulations with a machine
learning-based interatomic potential (ML-IAP), we demonstrate that the inverse
Hall-Petch relation can be correctly reproduced due to a change in the dominant
deformation mechanism as the grain becomes small in the Ni-Mo polycrystals. It
is found that the atomic von Mises strain can be significantly reduced by
either solute doping and/or annealing for small-grain-size polycrystals,
leading to the increased strength of the polycrystals. On the other hand, for
large-grain-size polycrystals, annealing weakens the material due to the large
atomic movements in GB regions. Over a broad range of grain size, the
superposition of the solute and annealing effects on polycrystals enhances the
strength of those with small grain size more than those with large ones, giving
rise to the continuous strengthening at extremely small grain sizes. Overall,
this study not only demonstrates the reliability of the ML-IAP, but also
provides a comprehensive atomistic view of complex strengthening mechanisms in
nanocrystals, opening up a new avenue to tailor their mechanical properties.

<h3>Significantly increased magnetic anisotropy in Co nano-columnar  multilayer structure via a unique sequential oblique-normal deposition  approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08739" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08739</a>
<br>
<i>Arun Singh Dev, Sharanjeet Singh, Anup Kumar Bera, Pooja Gupta, Velaga Srihari, Pallavi Pandit, Matthias Schwartzkopf, Stephan V. Roth, Dileep Kumar</i>
<br>
<br>
Oblique/normal sequential deposition technique is used to create Co based
unique multilayer structure [Co-oblique(4.4nm)/Co-normal (4.2 nm)]x10, where
each Co-oblique layer is deposited at an oblique angle of 75deg, to induce
large in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA). Compared to the previous
ripple, stress and oblique angle deposition (OAD) related studies on Cobalt in
literature, one-order higher UMA with the easy axis of magnetization along the
projection of the tilted nano-columns in the multilayer plane is observed. The
multilayer retains magnetic anisotropy even after annealing at 450C. The
in-plane UMA in this multilayer is found to be the combination of shape, and
magneto-crystalline anisotropy (MCA) confirmed by the temperature-dependent
grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS), in situ reflection
high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and grazing incidence X-ray
diffraction (GIXRD) measurements. The crystalline texturing of hcp Co in the
multilayer minimizes spin-orbit coupling energy along the column direction,
which couples with the shape anisotropy energies and results in preferential
orientation of the easy magnetic axis along the projection of the columns in
the multilayer plane. Reduction in UMA after annealing is attributed to
diffusion/merging of columns and annihilating crystallographic texturing. The
obtained one-order high UMA demonstrates the potential application of the
unique structure engineering technique, which may have far-reaching advantages
in magnetic thin films/multilayers and spintronic devices.

<h3>Analytic elastic constants in molecular calculations: Finite strain,  non-affine displacements, and many-body interatomic potentials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08754" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08754</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Elastic constants are among the most fundamental and important properties of
solid materials, which is why they are routinely characterized in both
experiments and simulations. While conceptually simple, the treatment of
elastic constants is complicated by two factors not yet having been
concurrently discussed: finite-strain and non-affine, internal displacements.
Here, we revisit the theory behind zero-temperature, finite-strain elastic
constants and extend it to explicitly consider non-affine displacements. We
further present analytical expressions for second-order derivatives of the
potential energy for two-body and generic many-body interatomic potentials,
such as cluster and empirical bond-order potentials. Specifically, we revisit
the elastic constants of silicon, silicon carbide and silicon dioxide under
hydrostatic compression and dilatation. Based on existing and new results, we
outline the effect of multiaxial stress states as opposed to volumetric
deformation on the limits of stability of their crystalline lattices.

<h3>Effect of sample height and particle elongation in the sedimentation of  colloidal rods</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08790" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08790</a>
<br>
<i>Tobias Eckert, Matthias Schmidt, Daniel de las Heras</i>
<br>
<br>
We study theoretically the effect of a gravitational field on the equilibrium
behaviour of a colloidal suspension of rods with different length-to-width
aspect ratios. The bulk phases of the system are described with analytical
equations of state. The gravitational field is then incorporated via
sedimentation path theory, which assumes a local equilibrium condition at each
altitude of the sample. The bulk phenomenology is significantly enriched by the
presence of the gravitational field. In a suspension of elongated rods with
five stable phases in bulk, the gravitational field stabilizes up to fifteen
different stacking sequences. The sample height has a non-trivial effect on the
stable stacking sequence. New layers of distinct bulk phases appear either at
the top, at the bottom, or simultaneously at the top and the bottom when
increasing the sample height at constant colloidal concentration. We also study
sedimentation in a mass-polydisperse suspension in which all rods have the same
shape but different buoyant masses.

<h3>Optimum dissipation by cruising in dense suspensions</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Dense suspensions tend to shear jam at large packing fractions. However, it
has recently been shown that various oscillation protocols can unjam as well as
reduce viscosity and dissipation. In this numerical work, we ask ourselves what
is the optimum shear protocol in terms of dissipation. We show that many
cruising protocols' dissipation are similar to shear protocols with a steady
primary shear and superimposed cross oscillations, even though the latter's
viscosity reduction is more considerable. Furthermore, we find that alternating
between primary and perpendicular oscillations yields a much higher dissipation
than the two protocols mentioned above, yet has similar viscosity as the
cross-oscillatory one. While self-organization has been shown to minimize
viscosity, our findings challenge the idea that random organization is the
underlying mechanism for reducing dissipation. Instead, shear ``fragility''
combined with geometry seems to be the key ingredients, which explains the
counter-intuitive decoupling of the minima of viscosity and dissipation for the
cruising protocol. This work paves the way for a new class of highly-energy
efficient flow protocols.

The use of a novel three-dimensional graphene structure allows circumventing
the limitations of the two-dimensional nature of graphene and its application
in hydrogen absorption. Here we investigate hydrogen-bonding on monolayer
graphene conformally grown via the epitaxial growth method on the (0001) face
of a porousified 4H-SiC wafer. Hydrogen absorption is studied via Thermal
Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS), exposing the samples to either atomic (D) or
molecular (D2) deuterium. The graphene growth temperature, hydrogen exposure
temperature, and the morphology of the structure are investigated and related
to their effect on hydrogen absorption. The three-dimensional graphene
structures chemically bind atomic deuterium when exposed to D2. This is the
first report of such an event in unfunctionalized graphene-based materials and
implies the presence of a catalytic splitting mechanism. It is further shown
that the three-dimensional dendritic structure of the porous material
temporarily retains the desorbed molecules and causes delayed emission. The
capability of chemisorbing atoms after a catalytic splitting of hydrogen,
coupled to its large surface-to-volume ratio, make these structures a promising
substrate for hydrogen storage devices.

<h3>Quantum-interference origin and magnitude of 1/$f$ noise in Dirac nodal  line IrO$_2$ nanowires at low temperatures</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present 1/$f$ noise measurements of IrO$_2$ nanowires from 1.7 to 350 K.
Results reveal that the noise magnitude (represented by Hooge parameter
$\gamma$) increases at low temperatures, indicating low-frequency resistance
noise from universal conductance fluctuations. The cause of this noise is
determined to be due to oxygen vacancies in the rutile structure of IrO$_2$.
Additionally, the number density of these mobile defects can be calculated from
the $\sqrt{T}$ resistance rise caused by the orbital two-channel Kondo effect
in the Dirac nodal line metal IrO$_2$.

<h3>Josephson effects between the Kitaev ladder superconductors</h3>

<i>Osamu Kanehira, Hiroki Tsuchiura</i>
<br>
<br>
The two-leg ladder system consisting of the Kitaev chains is known to exhibit
a richer phase diagram than that of the single chain. We theoretically
investigate the variety of the Josephson effects between the ladder systems. We
consider the Josephson phase difference $\theta$ between these two ladder
systems as well as the phase difference $\phi$ between the parallel chains in
each ladder system. The total energy of the junction at $T = 0$ is calculated
by a numerical diagonalization method as functions of $\theta$, $\phi$, and
also a transverse hopping $t_{\perp}$ in the ladders. We find that, by
controlling $t_{\perp}$ and $\phi$, the junction exhibits not only the
fractional Josephson effect for the phase difference $\theta$, but also the
usual 0-junction and even $\pi$-junction properties.

<h3>Symmetry of the Hyperfine and Quadrupole Interactions of Boron Vacancies  in a Hexagonal Boron Nitride</h3>

<br>
<br>
The concept of optically addressable spin states of deep level defects in
wide band gap materials is successfully applied for the development of quantum
technologies. Recently discovered negatively charged boron vacancy defects (VB)
in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) potentially allow a transfer of this concept
onto atomic thin layers due to the van der Waals nature of the defect host.
Here, we experimentally explore all terms of the VB spin Hamiltonian reflecting
interactions with the three nearest nitrogen atoms by means of conventional
electron spin resonance and high frequency (94 GHz) electron-nuclear double
resonance. We establish symmetry, anisotropy, and principal values of the
corresponding hyperfine interaction (HFI) and nuclear quadrupole interaction
(NQI). The HFI can be expressed in the axially symmetric form as Aperp = 45.5
MHz and Apar = 87 MHz, while the NQI is characterized by quadrupole coupling
constant Cq = 1.96 MHz with slight rhombisity parameter n = (Pxx - Pyy)/Pzz =
-0.070. Utilizing a conventional approach based on a linear combination of
atomic orbitals and HFI values measured here, we reveal that almost all spin
density (84 %) of the VB electron spin is localized on the three nearest
nitrogen atoms. Our findings serve as valuable spectroscopic data and direct
experimental demonstration of the VB spin localization in a single two
dimensional BN layer.

<br>
The present Comment demonstrates important flaws of the paper Phys. Chem.
Chem. Phys. 2022, 24, 11958 by Opodi~\emph{et al.} Their crown result
(``applicability map'') aims at indicating parameter ranges wherein two
approximate methods (called method 2 and 3) apply. My calculations reveal that
the applicability map is a factual error. Deviations of $I_2$ from the exact
current $I_1$ do not exceed 3\% for model parameters where Opodi~\emph{et al.}
claimed that method 2 is inapplicable. As for method 3, the parameter range of
the applicability map is beyond its scope, as stated in papers cited by
Opodi~\emph{et al.}~themselves.

<h3>Dynamic imprinting of nanoscale topological phases into an  antiferromagnet</h3>

Controlling the magnetic order of antiferromagnets is challenging due to the
vanishing net magnetisation. For this reason, the study of topologically
protected real-space states of antiferromagnets is restricted by the difficulty
in nucleating such states. Here, using atomistic simulations we demonstrate how
to nucleate predefined, localised spin textures in a thin film antiferromagnet,
$\gamma$-IrMn$_3$. Utilising the exchange bias coupling between a ferromagnet
and an antiferromagnet, we imprint the topological states on the former onto
the latter by means of a thermal cycling procedure. The imprinted textures are
shown to be stable against field perturbations. We also discuss how various
material parameters affect the efficiency of the imprinting and the
characteristics of the imprinted textures. This work paves way for further
studies on topologically protected real-space phases in antiferromagnets and
promotes the development of denser and faster spintronic devices.

<h3>Classical and quantum facilitated exclusion processes</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We demonstrate exciting similarities between classical and quantum many body
systems whose microscopic dynamics are composed of non-reciprocal three-site
facilitated exclusion processes. We show that the quantum analogue of the
classical facilitated process engineers an interesting $quantum$ $absorbing$
$transition$ where the quantum particles transit from an unentangled
direct-product absorbing phase to an entangled steady state with a finite
current at density $\rho=1/2$. In the generalised classical facilitated
exclusion process, which includes independent hopping of particles with rate
$p$, our analytical and Monte-Carlo results establish emergence of a special
density $\rho^*=\frac{1}{3}$ that demarcates two regimes in the steady state,
based on the competition between two current carrying modes (facilitated and
independent). The corresponding quantum system also displays similar
qualitative behaviours with striking non-monotonic features in the bipartite
entanglement. Our work ties the two sub-fields of classically interacting
exclusion processes, and interacting non-Hermitian quantum Hamiltonians to show
common themes in the non-equilibrium phases they realise.

<h3>A renewal approach to configurational entropy in one dimension</h3>

<br>
<i>P. L. Krapivsky, J. M. Luck</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce a novel approach, inspired from the theory of renewal processes,
to determine the configurational entropy of ensembles of constrained
configurations of particles on the one-dimensional lattice. The proposed method
can deal with all local rules involving only the lengths of clusters of
occupied and empty sites. Within this scope, this method is both more
systematic and easier to implement than the transfer-matrix approach. It is
illustrated in detail on the $k$-mer deposition model and on ensembles of
trapped Rydberg atoms with blockade range $b$.

<h3>Tunable Lyapunov exponent in a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev-type model</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model shows chaotic behavior with a maximal
Lyapunov exponent. In this paper, we investigate the four-point function of a
SYK-type model numerically, which gives us access to its Lyapunov exponent. The
model consists of two sets of Majorana fermions, called A and B, and the
interactions are restricted to being exclusively pairwise between the two sets,
not within the sets. We find that the Lyapunov exponent is maximal, within
numerical accuracy, for a range of ratios of A and B centered around equal
population at strong coupling. In this region we recover the Lyapunov exponent
of the conventional SYK model.

<h3>Acoustic metric and acoustic Planck constants</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08894" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08894</a>
<br>
<i>G.E. Volovik</i>
<br>
<br>
Based on Akama-Diakonov (AK) theory of emergent tetrads, it was
suggested\cite{Volovik2023b} that one can introduce two Planck constants, which
are the parameters of the corresponding components of Minkowski metric. In the
AK theory, the interval $ds$ is dimensionless, as a result the metric elements
and thus the Planck constants have nonzero dimensions. The Planck constant
$\hbar$ has dimension of time, and the second Planck constant $\hslash$ has
dimension of length. It is natural to compare $\hslash$ with the Planck length
$l_{\rm P}$, which is related to the Newton constant as $l_{\rm P}^2= \hslash
G$. However, this connection remains an open question, because the microscopic
(trans-Planckian) physics of the quantum vacuum is not known. Here we study
this question using the effective gravity emerging for sound wave quanta
(phonons) in superfluid Bose liquid, such as $^4$He, where the microscopic
physics is known: it is atomic physics. The elements of the effective acoustic
metric are determined by the parameters of this Bose liquid, and as in the AK
theory, the interval $ds$ is dimensionless. One may introduce the effective
"acoustic Planck constants" as elements of acoustic metric, $g^{\mu\nu}_{\rm
ac}= {\rm diag}(-\hbar_{\rm ac}^2,\hslash_{\rm ac}^2,\hslash_{\rm
ac}^2,\hslash_{\rm ac}^2)$. Then one obtains that the acoustic Planck constant
$\hslash_{\rm ac}$ has dimension of length, and in liquid helium it is on the
order of the interatomic distance in this liquid, $\hslash_{\rm ac} \sim a$.
This supports the scenario in which the Planck constant in the relativistic
quantum vacuum is on the order of the Planck length, $\hslash\sim l_{\rm P}
\sim G$. We also use the acoustic metric for consideration of the possible
dependence of the Planck constant on the Hubble parameter in expanding
Universe.

<h3>Coherent Microwave Emission of a Gain-Driven Polariton</h3>

<br>
<br>
By developing a gain-embedded cavity magnonics platform, we create
gain-driven polariton (GDP) that is activated by an amplified electromagnetic
field. Distinct effects of gain-driven light-matter interaction, such as
polariton auto-oscillations, polariton phase singularity, self-selection of a
polariton bright mode, and gain-induced magnon-photon synchronization, are
theoretically studied and experimentally manifested. Utilizing the
gain-sustained photon coherence of the GDP, we demonstrate polariton-based
coherent microwave amplication (~ 40 dB) and achieve high-quality coherent
microwave emission (Q > 10^9).

<br>
<br>
We demonstrate the influence of damping and field-like torques in the
magnon-photon coupling process by classically integrating the generalized
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with RLC equation in which a phase correlation
between dynamic magnetization and microwave current through combined Amp\`ere
and Faraday effects are considered. We show that the gap between two hybridized
modes can be controlled in samples with damping parameter in the order of
$10^{-3}$ by changing the direction of the dc current density $J$ if a certain
threshold is reached. Our results suggest that an experimental realization of
the proposed magnon-photon coupling control mechanism is feasible in yttrium
iron garnet/Pt hybrid structures.

<h3>Effect of electron- and hole-doping on properties of kagome-lattice  ferromagnet Fe3Sn2</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report a theoretical investigation of effects of Mn and Co substitution in
the transition metal sites of the kagome-lattice ferromagnet, Fe3Sn2. Herein,
hole- and electron-doping effects of Fe3Sn2 have been studied by
density-functional theory calculations on the parent phase and on the
substituted structural models of Fe3-xMxSn2 (M = Mn, Co; x = 0.5, 1.0). All
optimized structures favor the ferromagnetic ground state. Analysis of the
electronic density of states (DOS) and band structure plots reveals that the
hole (electron) doping leads to a progressive decrease (increase) in the
magnetic moment per Fe atom and per unit cell overall. The high DOS is retained
nearby the Fermi level in the case of both Mn and Co substitutions. The
electron doping with Co results in the loss of nodal band degeneracies, while
in the case of hole doping with Mn emergent nodal band degeneracies and
flatbands initially are suppressed in Fe2.5Mn0.5Sn2 but re-emerge in Fe2MnSn2.
These results provide key insights into potential modifications of intriguing
coupling between electronic and spin degrees of freedom observed in Fe3Sn2.

Programmable quantum simulator using Rydberg-atom array provides a promising
route to demystifying quantum many-body physics in strongly correlated systems.
Motivated by recent realization of various quantum magnetic phases on
frustrated Rydberg-atom array, we perform numerically exact quantum Monte-Carlo
simulation to investigate the exotic states of matter emerging in the model
describing Rydberg atom on triangular lattice. Our state-of-the-art simulation
unveils the $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ triangular anti-ferromagnetic(TAF) order
exists at $\frac{1}{3}$/$\frac{2}{3}$-Rydbreg filling, consistent with the
observation in experiments. More fantastically, $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$
long-range order arising from order-by-disorder mechanism emerges at
$\frac{1}{2}$-filling. At finite temperature, $U(1)$ symmetry is emergent at
$\frac{1}{2}$-filling and a Kosterlitz-Thouless(KT) phase transition occurs
with increasing temperature. These intriguing phenomena are potentially
detected in future Rydberg-atom experiments.

<br>
<br>
Topological superconductivity is a very promising concept for generating
fault tolerant qubits in quantum computation[1-3]. Early experimental
achievements study hybrid systems[4-5] as well as doped intrinsic topological
or superconducting materials[6-8]. These pioneering results concern either
inconclusive phenomenology or very-low temperatures. In a very recent work
intrinsic two-dimensional low-temperature superconductivity has been reported
in the type-I Weyl semimetal trigonal PtBi2[9]. However, larger critical
temperatures are indispensable for technological exploitation. Here we show
that trigonal PtBi2 possesses high-temperature surface superconductivity. By
means of scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, we reveal that the superconducting
gap can be as large as 20 meV, suggesting a critical temperature in the 100 K
range, like in cuprate high-temperature superconductors. To our knowledge, this
is the largest superconducting gap that has been observed so far in a
topological material. The superconducting state at 5 K persists up to
Tesla-range applied fields and the upper critical field at this temperature is
of roughly 12 Tesla. Our results therefore render trigonal PtBi2 a prime
candidate for topological superconductivity at technologically relevant
temperatures.

Glidcop is an oxide-particle-dispersion strengthened copper composite that
has a combination of high mechanical strength and high electrical conductivity.
It has been used as a conductor for 100 T ultrahigh field pulsed magnets by the
National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, USA. In the quest for even higher
field pulsed magnets, material development is crucial. Since the mechanical
properties of a material are often determined by its micro-structure, full
characterization of the microstructure of Glidcop is necessary. In this work,
we studied the microstructure of Glidcop AL-60 using both transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). We
identified both alpha-Al2O3 and cubic eta-Al2O3 nanoparticles in AL-60 and
investigated their size and density distribution. The small alumina particles
eta-Al2O3 nanoparticles with typical size of 5 to 30 nm are of triangular
shape. They have had well defined crystal orientation relation-ship with the Cu
matrix. We observed dislocations pinned by the alumina nanoparticles in
cold-drawn wires. We believed that dislocation bypassing alumina particles via
Orowan looping was the main strengthening mechanism. We observed microcracks
near large particles, demonstrating the detrimental effect of large particles
in AL-60.

Development of REBCO cables that carry high electrical current in high
magnetic field is crucial for future large-scale magnet applications. This
experimental work presents the critical current measurements of two different
REBCO cables by a test facility at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory
(NHMFL). The simple-stacked cable is made by the NHMFL by stacking 21 REBCO
tapes without soldering. The Conductor-on-Round-Core (CORC) cable provided by
Advanced Conductor Technologies has 21 layers of REBCO tapes with 2
tapes/layer. The test facility consists of a 12 T split solenoid magnet with 15
cm bore providing transverse field to the samples, a superconducting
transformer (SCT) as a current source providing up to 45 kA current. Special
attentions were paid to fabrication of solder joints between REBCO cables and
the SCT output. The voltage-current traces were measured as a function of
magnetic field at 4.2 K, from which the critical currents are determined. The
details of this measurement are discussed.

This paper presents a simple formalism for calculating X-ray absorption (XAS)
and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) that has as input
orbital-resolved density of states from a single-particle or many-body
\textit{ab initio} calculation and is designed to capture itinerant-like
features. We use this formalism to calculate both the XAS and RIXS with input
from DFT and DFT+DMFT for the recently studied reduced valence nickelates
$R_4$Ni$_3$O$_8$ and $R$NiO$_2$ ($R$ a rare earth), and these results are then
contrasted with those for the cuprate CaCuO$_2$ and the unreduced nickelate
$R_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. In contrast to the unreduced $R_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, the
reduced valence nickelates as well as the cuprate show strong orbital
polarization due to the dominance of $x^2-y^2$ orbitals for the unoccupied $3d$
states. We also reproduce two key aspects of a recent RIXS experiment for
$R_4$Ni$_3$O$_8$: (i) a charge transfer feature between $3d$ and oxygen $2p$
states whose energy we find to decrease as one goes from $R$NiO$_2$ to
$R_4$Ni$_3$O$_8$ to the cuprate, and (ii) an energy-dependent polarization
reversal of the fluorescence line that arises from hybridization of the
unoccupied $z^2$ states with $R$ 5d states. We end with some implications of
our results for the nature of the $3d$ electrons in reduced valence nickelates.

<h3>Plasmon-plasmon interaction and the role of buffer in epitaxial graphene  micro-flakes</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the origin of the translational symmetry breaking in
epitaxially grown single-layer graphene. Despite the surface morphology of
homogeneous graphene films influenced by the presence of mutually parallel SiC
surface terraces, the far-infrared magneto-plasmon absorption is almost
independent of the angle between the probing light polarization and the
orientation of terraces. Based on a detailed analysis of the plasmon absorption
lineshape and its behavior in the magnetic field, supported by confocal Raman
mapping and atomic force microscopy, we explain this discrepancy by
spontaneously formed graphene micro flakes. We further support our conclusions
using data collected on artificially created graphene nanoribbons: we recognize
similar plasmon origin in artificial ribbons and naturally formed grains. An
unexpectedly large plasmon resonance redshift was observed in nanoribbons. In a
hydrogen-intercalated sample (which does not contain the buffer), this redshift
is quantitatively taken into account by a plasmon-plasmon interaction. In
non-intercalated samples featuring a buffer layer, this redshift is due to an
interplay between the plasmon-plasmon coupling and Coulomb screening by the
buffer-induced interface states. This model determines the density of interface
states in good agreement with experimentally reported values.

<h3>Heating and Cooling are Fundamentally Asymmetric and Evolve Along  Distinct Pathways</h3>

According to conventional wisdom, a system placed in an environment with a
different temperature tends to relax to the temperature of the latter, mediated
by the flows of heat and/or matter that are set solely by the temperature
difference. It is becoming clear, however, that thermal relaxation is much more
intricate when temperature changes push the system far from thermodynamic
equilibrium. Interestingly, under such conditions heating was predicted to be
faster than cooling, which we experimentally confirm using an optically trapped
colloidal particle. More strikingly, we show with both experiments and theory
that between any pair of temperatures, heating is not only faster than cooling
but the respective processes in fact evolve along fundamentally distinct
pathways, which we explain with a new theoretical framework we coin "thermal
kinematics".
