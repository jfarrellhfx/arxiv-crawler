<h3>Quantum error correction in a time-dependent transverse field Ising model</h3>

We describe a simple quantum error correcting code built out of a
time-dependent transverse field Ising model. The code is similar to a
repetition code, but has two advantages: an $N$-qubit code can be implemented
with a finite-depth spatially local unitary circuit, and it can subsequently
protect against both $X$ and $Z$ errors if $N\ge 10$ is even. We propose an
implementation of this code with 10 ultracold Rydberg atoms in optical
tweezers, along with further generalizations of the code.

<h3>Non-Gaussian displacement distributions in models of heterogeneous active particle dynamics</h3>

We study the effect of randomly distributed diffusivities and speeds in two
models for active particle dynamics with active and passive fluctuations. We
demonstrate how non-Gaussian displacement distributions emerge in these models
in the long time limit, including Cauchy-type and exponential (Laplace) shapes.
Notably the resulting shapes of the displacement distributions with distributed
diffusivities for the active models considered here are in striking contrast to
passive diffusion models. For the active motion models our discussion points
out the differences between active- and passive-noise. Specifically, we
demonstrate that the case with active-noise is in nice agreement with measured
data for the displacement distribution of social amoeba.

We extend recent work on hydrodynamics with global multipolar symmetries --
known as "fracton hydrodynamics" -- to systems in which the multipolar
symmetries are gauged. We refer to the latter as "fracton
magnetohydrodynamics", in analogy to magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), which governs
systems with gauged charge conservation. Fracton MHD arises naturally from
higher-rank Maxwell's equations and in systems with one-form symmetries obeying
certain constraints; while we focus on "minimal" higher-rank generalizations of
MHD that realize diffusion, our methods may also be used to identify other,
more exotic hydrodynamic theories (e.g., with magnetic subdiffusion). In
contrast to phenomenological MHD, our approach -- based on higher-form
symmetries -- provides a systematic treatment of hydrodynamics beyond "weak
coupling", and provides an effective hydrodynamic description, e.g., of quantum
spin liquids, whose emergent gauge fields are strongly coupled.
