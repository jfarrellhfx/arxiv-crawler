<h3>Spin wavepacket propagation in quasi-2D antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03261" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03261</a>
<br>
<i>Yue Sun, Joseph Orenstein</i>
<br>
<br>
Antiferromagnets are attractive platforms for the propagation of information
via spin waves, offering advantages over ferromagnets in speed of response and
immunity to external fields. A recent study of the quasi-2D antiferromagnet
CrSBr reported that spin wavepackets propagate with group velocities that are
orders of magnitude higher than expected from the magnon dispersion obtained by
inelastic neutron scattering [1,2]. Here we show that the anomalous magnitude
and anisotropy of the group velocity, v_g, are naturally explained by
considering the long-range magnetic dipole-dipole interaction. We also
demonstrate that v_g can be tuned over orders of magnitude by applying an
external magnetic field or varying the sample thickness. Beyond spin wavepacket
propagation, the dipolar interaction creates the possibility of non-equilibrium
Bose-Einstein condensation in antiferromagnets, previously thought to be a
property unique to ferromagnets.

<h3>Tricritical behavior in dynamical phase transitions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03324" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03324</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We identify a new scenario for dynamical phase transitions occurring in
diffusive systems. It is characterized by the pairwise meeting of first- and
second-order bias-induced phase transition curves at two tricritical points. We
formulate a simple, general criterion for its appearance and derive an exact
Landau theory for the tricritical behavior. The scenario is demonstrated in
three examples: the simple symmetric exclusion process biased by an
activity-related structural observable; the Katz-Lebowitz-Spohn lattice gas
model biased by its current; and in an active lattice gas biased by its entropy
production.

<h3>Self-bound clusters of one-dimensional fermionic mixtures</h3>

<i>M.C. Gordillo</i>
<br>
<br>
Diffusion Monte Carlo calculations on the possibility of having self-bound
one-dimensional droplets of SU(6) $\times$ SU(2) fermionic mixtures are
presented. We found that, even though arrangements with attractive interactions
with only two spin types are not self-bound, the relaxation of the Pauli
repulsion brought about by an increasing in the number of fermion species
produced stable small drops for the same value of the parameters that define
the system.

<h3>Dynamics of self-propelled tracer particles inside a polymer network</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03626" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03626</a>

Transport of tracer particles through mesh-like environments such as
biological hydrogels and polymer matrices is ubiquitous in nature. These
tracers could be passive, such as colloids or active (self-propelled), such as
synthetic nanomotors or bacteria. Computer simulations in principle should be
extremely useful in exploring the mechanism of active (self-propelled)
transport of tracer particles through the mesh-like environments. Therefore, we
construct a polymer network on a diamond lattice and use computer simulations
to investigate the dynamics of spherical self-propelled particles inside the
network. Our main objective is to elucidate the effect of the self-propulsion
on the dynamics of the tracer particle as a function of tracer size and
stiffness of the polymer network. We compute the time-averaged mean-squared
displacement (MSD) and the van-Hove correlations of the tracer. On one hand, in
the case of the bigger sticky particle, caging caused by the network particles
wins over the escape assisted by the self-propulsion. This results
intermediate-time subdiffusion. On the other hand, smaller tracers or tracers
with high self-propulsion velocities can easily escape from the cages and show
intermediate-time superdiffusion. Stiffer the network, slower the dynamics of
the tracer, and the bigger tracers exhibit longer lived intermediate time
superdiffusion, as the persistence time scales as $\sim \sigma^3$, where
$\sigma$ is the diameter of the tracer. In intermediate time, non-Gaussianity
is more pronounced for active tracers. In the long time, the dynamics of the
tracer, if passive or weakly active, becomes Gaussian and diffusive, but
remains flat for tracers with high self-propulsion, accounting for their
seemingly unrestricted motion inside the network.

<h3>Non-linear fluctuating hydrodynamics for KPZ scaling in isotropic spin  chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03696" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03696</a>

Finite temperature spin transport in integrable isotropic spin chains is
known to be superdiffusive, with dynamical spin correlations that are
conjectured to fall into the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class.
However, integrable spin chains have time-reversal and parity symmetries that
are absent from the KPZ/stochastic Burgers equation, which force higher-order
spin fluctuations to deviate from standard KPZ predictions. We put forward a
non-linear fluctuating hydrodynamic theory consisting of two coupled stochastic
modes: the local spin magnetization and the local imbalance between right and
left-moving giant quasiparticles. Our theory fully explains the emergence of
anomalous spin dynamics in isotropic chains: it predicts KPZ scaling for the
spin structure factor, but with a symmetric, quasi-Gaussian, distribution of
spin fluctuations. We substantiate our results using matrix-product states
calculations.

<h3>Unidirectional Rashba Spin Splitting in Single Layer  WS$_{2(1-x)}$Se$_{2x}$ alloy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03248" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03248</a>
<br>

Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) layered semiconductors such as
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted considerable attention
due to their tunable band gap, intriguing spin-valley physics, piezoelectric
effects and potential device applications. Here we study the electronic
properties of a single layer WS$_{1.4}$Se$_{0.6}$ alloys. The electronic
structure of this alloy, explored using angle resolved photoemission
spectroscopy, shows a clear valence band structure anisotropy characterized by
two paraboloids shifted in one direction of the k-space by a constant in-plane
vector. This band splitting is a signature of a unidirectional Rashba spin
splitting with a related giant Rashba parameter of 2.8 0.7 eV . The combination
of angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy with piezo force microscopy
highlights the link between this giant unidirectional Rashba spin splitting and
an in-plane polarization present in the alloy. These peculiar anisotropic
properties of the WS$_{1.4}$Se$_{0.6}$ alloy can be related to local atomic
orders induced during the growth process due the different size and
electronegativity between S and Se atoms. This distorted crystal structure
combined to the observed macroscopic tensile strain, as evidenced by
photoluminescence, displays electric dipoles with a strong in-plane component,
as shown by piezoelectric microscopy. The interplay between semiconducting
properties, in-plane spontaneous polarization and giant out-of-plane Rashba
spin-splitting in this two-dimensional material has potential for a wide range
of applications in next-generation electronics, piezotronics and spintronics
devices.

<h3>Quantum chaos and phase transition in the Yukawa-SYK model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03265" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03265</a>
<br>
<i>Andrew Davis, Yuxuan Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
We analyze the quantum chaotic behavior of the Yukawa-SYK model as a function
of filling and temperature, which describes random Yukawa interactions between
$N$ complex fermions and $M$ bosons in zero spatial dimensions, for both the
non-Fermi liquid and insulating states at finite temperature and chemical
potential. We solve the ladder equations for the out-of-time-order correlator
(OTOC) for both the bosons and fermions. Despite the appearance of the chemical
potential in the Hamiltonian, which explicitly introduces an additional energy
scale, the OTOCs for the fermions and bosons in the non-Fermi liquid state turn
out to be unaffected, and the Lyapunov exponents that diagnose chaos remain
maximal. As the chemical potential increases, the system is known to experience
a first-order transition from a critical phase to a gapped insulating phase. We
postulate that the boundary of the region in parameter space where each phase
is (meta)stable coincides with the curve on which the Lyapunov exponent is
maximal. By calculating the exponent in the insulating phase and comparing to
numerical results on the boundaries of stability, we show that this is
plausible.

<h3>$H$-$φ$ formulation in Sparselizard combined with domain  decomposition methods for modeling superconducting tapes, stacks, and twisted  wires</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03274" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03274</a>

The growing interest in the modeling of superconductors has led to the
development of increasingly effective numerical methods and software. One of
the most utilized approaches for magnetoquasistatic simulations in applied
superconductivity is the $H$ formulation. However, due to the large number of
degrees of freedom (DOFs) present when modeling large and complex systems, such
as large coils for fusion applications, electrical machines, and medical
applications, using the standard $H$ formulation on a desktop machine becomes
infeasible. The $H$ formulation solves the Faraday's law formulated in terms of
the magnetic field intensity $\mathbf{H}$ using edge elements in the whole
modeling domain. For this reason, a very high resistivity is assumed for the
non-conducting domains, leading to an ill-conditioned system matrix and
therefore long computation times. In contrast, the $H$-$\phi$ formulation uses
the $H$-formulation in the conducting region, and the $\phi$ formulation
(magnetic scalar potential) in the surrounding non-conducting domains,
drastically reducing DOFs and computation time. In this work, we use the
$H$-$\phi$ formulation in 2D for the magnetothermal (AC losses and quench)
analysis of stacks of REBCO tapes. The same approach is extended to a 3D case
for the AC loss analysis of tapes and stack of tapes. All the results obtained
by simulations in Sparselizard are compared with results obtained with COMSOL.
Our custom tool allows us to distribute the simulations over hundreds of CPUs
using domain decomposition methods, considerably reducing the simulation times
without compromising accuracy.

<h3>Multilayer Graphene as an Endoreversible Otto Engine</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03286" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03286</a>
<br>
<i>Nathan M Myers, Francisco J. Peña, Natalia Cortés, Patricio Vargas</i>
<br>
<br>
Graphene is perhaps the most prominent "Dirac material," a class of systems
whose electronic structure gives rise to charge carriers that behave as
relativistic fermions. In multilayer graphene several crystal sheets are
stacked such that the honeycomb lattice of each layer is displaced along one of
the lattice edges. When subject to an external magnetic field, the scaling of
the multilayer energy spectrum with the magnetic field, and thus the system's
thermodynamic behavior, depends strongly on the number of layers. With this in
mind, we examine the performance of a finite-time endoreversible Otto cycle
with multilayer graphene as its working medium. We show that there exists a
simple relationship between the engine efficiency and the number of layers, and
that the efficiency at maximum power can exceed that of a classical
endoreversible Otto cycle.

<h3>Determination of superexchange interactions for the CuO$_2$ chains in  LiCu$_2$O$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03318" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03318</a>
<br>
<i>N. Aucar Boidi, Christian Helman, Y. Núñez-Fernández, K. Hallberg, A. A. Aligia</i>
<br>
<br>
Starting from \textit{ab-initio} calculations, we derive a five-band Hubbard
model to describe the CuO$_2$ chains of LiCu$_2$O$_2$. This model is further
simplified to a low-energy effective Heisenberg model with nearest-neighbor
(NN) $J_1$, and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) $J_2$ interactions, combining
perturbation theory, exact diagonalization calculations and Density Matrix
Renormalization Group results. For realistic parameters we find the
corresponding values of these interactions. The obtained effective model is
consistent with a spiral-magnetic ground state as experimentally observed.
Using symmetry arguments, the spiral state is a sufficient condition for the
ferroelectricity observed in the system.

The electronic structure and the magnetic properties of iron-based
superconductors are highly sensitive to the pnictogen height. Coherent
excitation of the $A_{1g}$ phonon by femtosecond laser directly modulates the
pnictogen height, which has been used to control the physical properties of
iron-based superconductors. Previous studies show that the driven $A_{1g}$
phonon resulted in a transient increase of the pnictogen height in
BaFe$_2$As$_2$, favoring an enhanced Fe magnetic moment. Here, we use
time-resolved broadband terahertz spectroscopy to investigate the dynamics of
BaFe$_2$As$_2$ in the $A_{1g}$ phonon driven state. Below the spin-density wave
(SDW) transition temperature, we observe a transient gap generation at early
time delays. A similar transient feature is observed in the normal state up to
room temperature.

<h3>Dissipative symmetry breaking in non-equilibrium steady states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03353" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03353</a>
<br>
<i>Matteo Sireci, Daniel Maria Busiello</i>
<br>
<br>
The connection between dissipation and symmetry breaking is a long-standing
enigma in statistical physics. It is intimately connected to the quest of a
non-equilibrium functional whose minimization gives the non-equilibrium steady
state (NESS). Writing down such a functional, we show that, in the presence of
additive noise, any NESS is characterized by the minimum entropy production
compatible with the maximum dissipation along cycles in the trajectory space.
This result sheds light on the excess entropy production principle and the
onset of topological symmetry breaking out-of-equilibrium. Finally, when
multiplicative noise is present, we find that the non-equilibrium functional
has two dissipative symmetry-breaking contributions, one stemming from cycles
and the other from a thermophoresis-like effect. Our framework paves the way to
understand selection phenomena as symmetry-breaking processes driven by
non-equilibrium dissipation.

<h3>Interlaced scan patterns based on progressive hexagonal grids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03356" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03356</a>
<br>
<i>Jacob D. Hinkle, Debangshu Mukherjee</i>
<br>
<br>
Progressive acquisition of slowly-scanned images is desirable for drift
correction and real-time visualization. Interlacing methods are common
approaches to storing and transmitting data on rectilinear grids, and here we
propose using them for acquisition in scanning-mode image modalities.
Especially in these cases, it is essential to make optimal use of sample points
to speed up the scan and reduce damage to the subject. It has long been known
that optimal sampling of band-limited signals is achieved using hexagonal
scanning grids. In this note, we demonstrate two new methods for interlacing
hexagonal grids, which enable early full field-of-view imaging with optimal
sampling and resolution doubling.

<h3>Multipolar interactions and magnetic excitation gap in d$^3$ spin-orbit  Mott insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03358" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03358</a>
<br>
<i>Leonid V. Pourovskii</i>
<br>
<br>
In Mott insulators with a half-filled $t_{2g}$ shell the Hund's rule coupling
induces a spin-3/2 orbital-singlet ground state. The spin-orbit interaction is
not expected to qualitatively impact low-energy degrees of freedom in such
systems. Indeed, $d^3$ cubic double perovskites (DP) of heavy transition metals
are believed to exhibit conventional collinear magnetic orders. However, their
inelastic neutron scattering spectra feature large gaps of unclear origin. Here
we derive first-principles low-energy Hamiltonians for the cubic DP
Ba$_2$Y$B'$O$_6$ ($B'=$ Os, Ru) and show that they include significant
multipolar - dipole-octupolar - intesite exchange terms. These terms break
continuous symmetry of the spin-3/2 Hamiltonian opening an excitation gap. The
calculated gap magnitudes are in good agreement with experiment. The
dipole-octupolar intersite exchange is induced due to excited states of the
$t_{2g}^3$ manifold that are admixed by spin-orbit into the spin-3/2 ground
state.

<h3>Visualizing and manipulating chiral edge states in a moiré quantum  anomalous Hall insulator</h3>

<br>
<br>
Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators are topological phases of matter that
host one-dimensional chiral edge states that result in unidirectional
electrical current flow, quantized Hall conductance, and dissipationless
carrier transport. We have used scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy
to directly visualize and manipulate chiral edge states in a moir\'e QAH
insulator made from twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene. We are able to control
the Chern number in our device by tuning the carrier concentration, thus
stabilizing adjacent domains having opposite Chern number and enabling the
visualization of chiral edge states residing at domain interfaces independent
of any structural boundaries within our sample. Formation of tip-induced
quantum dots provides additional local control over the carrier density and
Chern number, enabling the creation of chiral edge states with desired
chirality at predetermined locations. Our approach of combining visualization
of QAH chiral edge states with full electrical control creates new
possibilities for exploring the exotic topological properties of QAH
insulators.

<h3>Asymptotic Theory for Directed Transport of Suspended Ferromagnetic  Nanoparticles</h3>

<br>
<i>S.I. Denisov, T.V. Lyutyy, M.M. Moskalenko, A.T. Liutyi</i>
<br>
<br>
Using the rigid dipole model, we study the translational and rotational
motions of single-domain fer-romagnetic nanoparticles in a dilute suspension
induced by the harmonically oscillating gradient magnetic field in the presence
of a time-independent uniform magnetic field. Our approach is based on a set of
the first-order differential equations that describe the time dependencies of
the particle coordinate and mag-netization angle. We find the asymptotic
solutions of this set of equations at small and large times and, by applying
the matched asymptotic expansions for discrete times, derive analytical
expressions for the aver-age particle coordinate and velocity.

Ultracold atoms are an ideal platform for understanding system-reservoir
dynamics of many-body systems. Here, we study quantum back-action in atomic
Bose-Einstein condensates, weakly interacting with a far-from resonant, i.e.,
dispersively interacting, probe laser beam. The light scattered by the atoms
can be considered as a part of quantum measurement process whereby the change
in the system state derives from measurement back-action. We experimentally
quantify the resulting back-action in terms of the deposited energy. We model
the interaction of the system and environment with a generalized measurement
process, leading to a Markovian reservoir. Further, we identify two systematic
sources of heating and loss: a stray optical lattice and probe-induced light
assisted collisions (an intrinsic atomic process). The observed heating and
loss rates are larger for blue detuning than for red detuning, where they are
oscillatory functions of detuning with increased loss at molecular resonances
and reduced loss between molecular resonances.

<h3>Confinement of many-body Bethe strings</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03442" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03442</a>
<br>
<i>Jiahao Yang, Tao Xie, S. E. Nikitin, Jianda Wu, A. Podlesnyak</i>
<br>
<br>
Based on Bethe-ansatz approach and inelastic neutron scattering (INS)
experiments, we reveal evolution of confinement of many-body Bethe strings in
ordered regions of quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnet $\rm YbAlO_3$. In the
antiferromagnetic phase, the spin dynamics is dominated by the confined
length-1 Bethe strings, whose dominancy in the high-energy branch of the spin
dynamics yields to the confined length-2 Bethe strings when the material is
tuned to the spin-density-wave phase. In disordered region the confinement
effect disappears, and the system restores the physics of the one-dimensional
Heisenberg model. The distinctive many-body excitations appearing in different
phases of the material imply rich spin dynamics, which not only bring in deeper
understanding beyond static order parameters but can also serve as unique
dynamical features to characterize different phases. Based on confinement of
Bethe strings our results establish a unified dynamical picture for different
magnetic phases, and thus provides profound insight into the many-body quantum
magnetism.

<h3>Acoustic Frequency Multiplication and Pure Second Harmonic Generation of  Phonons by Magnetic Transducers</h3>

<br>
<i>Chengyuan Cai, Xi-Han Zhou, Weichao Yu, Tao Yu</i>
<br>
<br>
We predict frequency multiplication of surface acoustic waves in dielectric
substrates via the ferromagnetic resonance of adjacent magnetic transducers
when driven by microwaves. We find pure second harmonic generation (SHG)
without any linear and third harmonic components by a magnetic nanowire. The
SHG and linear phonon pumping are switched by varying the saturated
magnetization direction of the wire, or resolved directionally when pumped by
magnetic nano-disc. We address the high efficiency of SHG with comparable
magnitude to that of linear response, as well as unique non-reciprocal phonon
transport that is remarkably distinct in different phonon harmonics. Such
acoustic frequency comb driven by microwaves should bring unprecedented
tunability for the miniaturized phononic and spintronic devices.

<h3>Nodal s$_\pm$ Pairing Symmetry in an Iron-Based Superconductor with only  Hole Pockets</h3>

The origin of the high temperature superconductivity in the iron-based
superconductors remains elusive after being extensively studied for more than a
decade. Determination of the pairing symmetry is essential in understanding the
superconductivity mechanism. In the iron-based superconductors that have hole
pockets around the Brillouin zone center and electron pockets around the zone
corners, the pairing symmetry is generally considered to be s$_\pm$, endowing a
sign change in the superconducting gap between the hole and electron pockets.
For the iron-based superconductors with only hole pockets, however, a couple of
pairing scenarios have been proposed but the exact symmetry is still highly
controversial. Here we report our determination of the pairing symmetry in
KFe$_2$As$_2$ which is a prototypical iron-based superconductor with hole
pockets both around the zone center and around the zone corners. By taking
laser-based angle resolved photoemission measurements with super-high
resolution and at ultra-low temperature, we have precisely determined the
superconducting gap distribution and identified the locations of the gap nodes
on all the Fermi surface around the zone center and the zone corners. The
complete superconducting gap structure, in combination with the observation of
the spin resonance in neutron scattering, provides strong evidence on the
s$_\pm$ pairing symmetry in KFe$_2$As$_2$ with a gap sign reversal between the
hole pockets around the zone center and the hole pockets around the zone
corners. These results unify the pairing symmetry in the hole-doped iron-based
superconductors and point to the spin fluctuation as the pairing glue in
generating superconductivity.

BaCu$_3$(VO$_4$)$_2$(OH)$_2$. For each compound, the ground state is seemingly
A-type antiferromagnetic order. At low temperatures, applying a magnetic field
causes a metamagnetic-like transition described by the transition in which
antiferromagnetically-aligned canted moments change to
ferromagnetically-aligned ones. These ground and field-induced states include a
canted ferromagnetic component perpendicular to the kagome planes favored by
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. These magnetic properties are well
characterized by the J$_{eff}$ = 1/2 physics. Our findings will be the first
step toward clarifying the J$_{eff}$ = 1/2 kagome physics, which has been
little studied experimentally or theoretically.

The three-dimensional emergent magnetic field $\textbf{B}^e$ of a magnetic
hopfion gives rise to emergent magneto-multipoles in a similar manner to the
multipoles of classical electromagnetic field. Here, we show that the nonlinear
responses of a hopfion are characterized by its emergent magnetic toroidal
moment ${T}^e_z = \frac{1}{2}\int (\textbf{r}\times \textbf{B}^e)_z dV$ and
emergent magnetic octupole component ${\it \Gamma}^e =\int [(x^2+y^2)B^e_z - xz
B^e_x - y z B^e_y] dV$. The hopfion exhibits nonreciprocal dynamics (nonlinear
hopfion Hall effect) under an ac driving current applied along (perpendicular
to) the direction of ${T}^e_z$. The sign of nonreciprocity and nonlinear Hall
angle is determined by the polarity and chirality of hopfion. The nonlinear
electrical transport induced by a magnetic hopfion is also discussed. This work
reveals the vital roles of emergent magneto-multipoles in nonlinear hopfion
dynamics and could stimulate further investigations on the dynamical responses
of topological spin textures induced by emergent electromagnetic multipoles.

The recrystallized grain size and texture in alloys can be controlled via the
microchemistry state during thermomechanical processing. The influence of
concurrent precipitation on recovery and recrystallization is here analyzed by
directly correlating (sub)grains of P, CubeND or Cube orientation with
second-phase particles in a cold-rolled and non-isothermally annealed Al-Mn
alloy. The recrystallized state is dominated by coarse elongated grains with a
strong P, weaker CubeND and even weaker Cube texture. The correlated data
enables orientation dependent quantification of the density and size of
dispersoids on sub-boundaries and subgrains in the deformation zones around
large constituent particles. A new modified expression for the Smith-Zener drag
from dispersoids on sub-boundaries is derived and used. The results show that
the drag on (sub)grain boundaries from dispersoids is orientation dependent,
with Cube subgrains experiencing the highest drag after recovery and partial
recrystallization. The often observed size advantage of Cube subgrains in Al
alloys is not realized due to the increased drag, thereby promoting
particle-stimulated nucleation (PSN). Relatively fewer and larger dispersoids
in deformation zones around large particles give a reduced Smith-Zener drag on
PSN nuclei, thus further strengthening the effect of PSN. Observations
substantiating the stronger P texture compared to the CubeND texture are a
higher frequency of P subgrains and a faster growth of these subgrains. The
applied methodology enables a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the
orientation dependent nucleation and growth behavior during recovery and
recrystallization with strong concurrent precipitation in Al-Mn alloys. In
particular, the methodology gives new insights into the strong P and CubeND
textures compared to the Cube texture.

<h3>Superfluid transition in quasi-two-dimensional disordered dipolar Fermi  gases</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the effect of weak disorder on the superfluid properties of
two-component quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Fermi gases. The dipole-dipole
interaction amplitude is momentum dependent, which violates the Anderson
theorem claiming that the weak disorder has practically no influence on the
superfluid transition temperature in the weakly interacting regime. For dipolar
fermions the superfluid transition temperature in this regime can be strongly
increased by the disorder. However, we find that the effect becomes smaller
with increasing the intercomponent fermion-fermion interaction, and in the
strongly interacting regime the superfluid transition temperature in the weak
disorder becomes very close to that in the absence of disorder.

Differential thermal analysis has been conducted for the Al-Cu-Co alloys with
the composition range of 15 at.% Co and 10 to 30 at.% Cu, and 25 at.% Co and
2.5 to 20 at.% Co. The features of the formation of solid phases have been
studied during the crystallization in a crucible in the conditions of slow
cooling (rate of cooling to 1 K s-1) at normal pressure. On the state diagram
of the Al-Cu-Co system with 15 at.% Co and 25 at.% Cu the concentration
sections have been built, which allows to determine the concentration ranges
from which different phases are formed during the first stage of
crystallization. Along the boundaries of different phase regions, extrema are
observed on the liquidus line. The observed extrema on the liquidus lines and
concentration dependences of undercooling are associated with change in the
chemical short-range order at the considered concentrations both in the liquid
and solid states.

Recently, many exotic electronic states, such as quantum spin liquid (QSL)
and superconductivity (SC), have been extensively discovered and introduced in
layered transition metal dichalcogenides 1T-TaS2 by controlling their complex
correlated charge-density-wave (CDW) states. However, few studies have focused
on its hysteretic electronic phase transitions based on the in-depth discussion
of the delicate interplay among temperature-dependent electronic interactions.
Here, we reported a sequence of spatial electronic phase transitions in the
hysteresis temperature range of 1T-TaS2 via variable-temperature scanning
tunneling microscopy (VT-STM). The emergence, evolution, coexistence, and
separation of diverse novel electronic states within the commensurate
CDW/triclinic CDW (CCDW/TCDW) phase are investigated in detail through the
warming/cooling process. These novel emergent electronic states can be
attributed to the delicate temperature-dependent competition and/or cooperation
of interlayer interactions, intralayer electron-electron correlation, and
electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling of 1T-TaS2. Our results not only provide a
novel insight to understand the hysteretic electronic phase transitions of
correlated CDW state, but also pave a way to realize more exotic quantum states
by accurately and effectively controlling various interactions in correlated
materials.

<h3>Fragile electronic superconductivity in Bi Single crystal</h3>

<br>
<br>
It was presumed that semimetal Bismuth (Bi) would not show superconductivity
(SC) even at ultra-low temperatures ($<$10 mK) due to its very low carrier
density ($\approx 3\times10^{17}$cm$^{-3}$). Recently, we have established bulk
superconductivity in ultra-pure (99.9999\%) Bi single crystal at $\mathrm{T_C =
0.53}$ mK with an extrapolated upper critical field $\mathrm{H_C(0) = 5.2\mu}$T
measured along the [$0001$] (trigonal) -crystallographic direction. At very low
concentrations of the charge carriers, we are dealing with fragile Cooper pairs
with an estimated large coherence length $\mathrm{\xi_{GL}(0)\approx 96 \mu}$m.
We also stated that one needs to go beyond the conventional electron-phonon
coupling (BCS-like) mechanism to understand the SC state in Bi. Bi is a
compensated semi-metal with electrons and holes as charge carriers. In order to
find the charge carriers responsible for the SC, we report the temperature
dependence of the anisotropic critical field along the [$01\bar 10$]
(bisectrix)-crystallographic direction and compared it with the earlier data
from measurements along the trigonal. Our theoretical analysis of the
anisotropy of critical fields suggests that the light electrons in the three
pockets of Bi bands are responsible for the SC and indicates that Bi is an
extremely weak type-II (close to type-I) superconductor. Finally, we review the
current theories proposed to explain the SC in Bi.

Light-matter interaction enables engineering of non-equilibrium quantum
systems. In condensed matter, spatially and temporally cyclic Hamiltonians are
expected to generate energy-periodic Floquet states, with properties
inaccessible at thermal equilibrium. A recent work explored the tunnelling
conductance of a planar Josephson junction under microwave irradiation, and
interpreted replicas of conductance features as evidence of steady
Floquet-Andreev states. Here we realise a similar device in a hybrid
superconducting-semiconducting heterostructure, which utilises a tunnelling
probe with gate-tunable transparency and allows simultaneous measurements of
Andreev spectrum and current-phase relation of the planar Josephson junction.
We show that, in our devices, spectral replicas in sub-gap conductance emerging
under microwave irradiation are caused by photon assisted tunnelling of
electrons into Andreev states. The current-phase relation under microwave
irradiation is also explained by the interaction of Andreev states with
microwave photons, without the need to invoke Floquet states. For engineering
and control of non-equilibrium states of matter, it is of paramount importance
to recognise the intricacies of mesoscopic systems. This study harnesses the
advantages of gate-tunable devices to build an understanding of light-matter
coupling in hybrid nanostructures.

<br>
In this work, a scanning inverse spin Hall effect measurement system based on
a shorted coaxial resonator has been built, which provides a high throughput
method to characterize spin transport properties. The spin diffusion length of
Ta at room temperature is determined via automatic measurements of Py/Ta
bilayer strips with different thicknesses of Ta. The results show that the spin
diffusion length is about 4 nm with a conductivity of about 7.5E5
{\Omega}-1m-1, which leads to the conclusion that the intrinsic mechanism of
spin relaxation of Ta is the Elliott-Yafet interactions. The setup developed in
this work provides a convenient, efficient, and non-destructive way to obtain
the spin and electron transportation characteristics of the spintronic
materials, which will fertilize this community by developing new materials and
figuring out their mechanism.

<br>
<br>
Recently, uniaxial negative thermal expansion (NTE) has been observed in
transition-metal zirconides including tetragonal (CuAl2-type) CoZr2 and
orthorhombic (Re3B-type) CoZr3. Here, we report the observation of uniaxial NTE
in tetragonal (V3S-type) IrZr3. With increasing temperature, the lattice
parameter for the a-axis and volume of IrZr3 increase, but the lattice
parameter for the c-axis decreases. IrZr3 is a superconductor with a transition
temperature of 2.3 K. The present result suggests that uniaxial NTE and related
anomalous axis thermal expansion occur in various transition-metal zirconides,
which will be important for designing superconducting device robust to
temperature cycles using zero-thermal-expansion superconductors.

The study of the interaction between superconductivity and charge ordering is
helpful to resolve the pairing mechanism in high-temperature superconductors.
Recently, several resistance oscillations studies trigger the speculation that
a long-range charge ordering, with an enormous mesh size of several tens of
nanometer, can possibly emerge in underdoped high Tc superconductor. However,
spectroscopy studies have not traced this kind of long-range charge ordering.
Here, we clarify the disagreement between the transport and spectroscopy
studies on the mysterious long-range charge ordering by investigating the
magneto-oscillations in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} flakes. Inspired by
the observation that the oscillations evolve from a periodic to an aperiodic
one with decreasing doping level, we conclude that the magneto-oscillations can
be generated by the interaction between vortices and superconducting loops that
enclose randomly distributed underdoped puddles while an assumption of
long-range charge ordering is not necessary.

the core repulsions drastically broaden the coexistence region for the

<h3>Rheology of Granular Rafts</h3>

<br>
<br>
Rheology of macroscopic particle-laden interfaces, called "Granular Rafts"
has been experimentally studied, in the simple shear configuration. The
shear-stress relation obtained from a classical rheometer exhibits the same
behavior as a Bingham fluid and the viscosity diverges with the surface
fraction according to evolutions similar to 2D suspensions. The velocity field
of the particles that constitute the granular raft has been measured in the
stationary state. These measurements reveal non-local rheology similar to dry
granular materials. Close to the walls of the rheometer cell, one can observe
regions of large local shear rate while in the middle of the cell a quasistatic
zone exists. This flowing region, characteristic of granular matter, is
described in the framework of an extended kinetic theory showing the evolution
of the velocity profile with the imposed shear stress. Measuring the
probability density functions of the elementary strains, we provide evidence of
a balance between positive and negative elementary strains. This behavior is
the signature of a quasistatic region inside the granular raft.

Traditionally, the formation of off-stoichiometric compounds is believed to
be the growth effect rather than the intrinsic tendency of the system. However,
here, using the example of La3Te4, we demonstrate that in n-type gapped metals
having a large internal gap between principal band edges and the Fermi level
inside of the principal conduction band, Fermi-level instability can develop,
resulting in a reduction of formation energy for acceptor defects.
Specifically, La vacancies in La3Te4 form spontaneously to produce the acceptor
states and remove a fraction of free carriers from the principal conduction
band via electron-hole recombination. Such a unique self-doping mechanism
allows to stabilize a range of off-stoichiometric La3-xTe4 compounds, which
have different electronic properties. Moreover, we thus show how controlling
synthesis conditions can be used as a knob to reach the target functionality,
including controllable metal-to-insulator transition.

<h3>Coherent Phonons-Driven Hot Carrier Effect in a Superlattice Solar Cell</h3>

Carrier thermalization in a superlattice solar cell is studied theoretically
by considering electron-phonon scattering as the principal channel of carrier
energy loss. Importantly, the effect of an intrinsic quantum mechanical
property; the phonon coherence, on carrier thermalization is investigated,
within semiclassical picture in terms of phonon wave packet. It turns out that
coherent longitudinal optical (LO) phonons weaken the effective electron-phonon
coupling, thus supposedly lowering the carrier energy loss rate in solar cell.
The resulting thermalization power is indeed significantly reduced by the
coherent phonons, resulting in enhanced hot carrier effect, particularly for
thin enough well layer where carrier confinement is also strong. A recent
experiment on superlattice solar cell prototype is shown to manifest the
coherent phonons-driven phenomenon. Our results demonstrate the practical
implications of the fundamental quantum coherence property of phonons in
semiconductors for improving superlattice solar cell performance, via hot
carrier effect.

Cold atomic gases offer the prospect of simulating the physics of the very
early universe in the laboratory. In the condensate phase, the gas is described
by a field theory with key features of high energy particle theory. This paper
describes a three level system which undergoes a first order phase transition
through the nucleation of bubbles. The theoretical investigation shows bubbles
nucleating in two dimensions at non-zero temperature. There is good agreement
between the bubble nucleation rates calculated from a Stochastic Projected
Gross-Pitaevskii equation and from a non-perturbative instanton method. When an
optical box trap is included in the simulations, the bubbles nucleate
preferentially near the walls of the trap.

Fusion of three benzene rings in a triangular fashion gives rise to the
smallest open-shell graphene fragment, the phenalenyl radical, whose
${\pi}$-extension leads to an entire family of non-Kekul\'e triangular
nanographenes with high-spin ground states. Here, we report the first synthesis
of unsubstituted phenalenyl on a Au(111) surface, which is achieved by
combining in-solution synthesis of the hydro-precursor and on-surface
activation by atomic manipulation, using the tip of a scanning tunneling
microscope (STM). Single-molecule structural and electronic characterization
confirm its open-shell S = 1/2 ground state that gives rise to Kondo screening
on the Au(111) surface. In addition, we compare the phenalenyl's electronic
properties with those of triangulene, the second homolog in the series, whose S
= 1 ground state induces an underscreened Kondo effect. Our results set a new
lower size-limit in the on-surface synthesis of magnetic nanographenes that can
serve as building blocks for the realization of new exotic quantum phases of
matter.

<br>
Hole spins in semiconductor quantum dots can be efficiently manipulated with
radio-frequency electric fields owing to the strong spin-orbit interactions in
the valence bands. Here we show that the motion of the dot in inhomogeneous
strain fields gives rise to linear Rashba spin-orbit interactions (with
spatially dependent spin-orbit lengths) and g-factor modulations that allow for
fast Rabi oscillations. Such inhomogeneous strains may build up spontaneously
due to process and cool down stress. We discuss spin qubits in Ge/GeSi
heterostructures as an illustration. We highlight that Rabi frequencies can be
enhanced by one order of magnitude by shear strain gradients as small as
$3\times 10^{-6}$ nm$^{-1}$ within the dots. This underlines that spin in
solids can be very sensitive to strains and opens the way for strain
engineering in hole spin devices for quantum information and spintronics.

Resistance of certain (conductive and otherwise isotropic) ferromagnets turns
out to exhibit anisotropy with respect to the direction magnetisation:
R$_\parallel$ different from R$_\perp$ with reference to the electric current
direction. This century-old phenomenon is reviewed both from the perspective of
materials and physical mechanisms involved. More recently, this effect has also
been extended to antiferromagnets. This opens the possibility for industrial
applications reaching far beyond the current ones,e.g.hard drive read heads.

We show that time-reversal symmetry broken, centrosymmetric antiferromagnets
with nonrelativistic spin-splitting are conveniently described in terms of the
ferroic ordering of magnetic octupoles. The magnetic octupoles are the
lowest-order ferroically ordered magnetic quantity in this case, and so are the
natural order parameter for the transition into the magnetically ordered state.
They provide a unified description of the broken time-reversal symmetry and the
non-relativistic spin splitting as well as a platform for manipulating the
latter, and account for other phenomena, such as piezomagnetism, characteristic
of this class of antiferromagnets. Unusually for antiferromagnets, we show that
the magnetic octupoles cause a non-zero magnetic Compton scattering, providing
a route for their direct experimental detection. We illustrate these concepts
using density-functional and model calculations for the prototypical
non-relativistic spin-split antiferromagnet, rutile-structure manganese
difuoride, MnF2.

<h3>Landau level spectrum and magneto-optical conductivity in tilted Weyl  semimetal</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present a systematic investigation of the magnetoresponses of the Weyl
points (WPs) with a topological charge of n = 2, 3 and 4, and with both linear
and quadratic energy tilt. The linear tilt always tends to squeeze the Landau
levels (LLs) of both conduction and valence bands of all the WPs, and
eventually leads to LL collapse in the type-II phase. However, the quadratic
energy tilt has more complex influences on the LLs of the unconventional WPs.
For charge-n (n = 2, 4) WP, the influence of the quadratic tilt on the LLs of
conduction and valence bands are opposite, i.e. if the LLs of conduction
(valence) bands are squeezed, then that of the valence (conduction) bands are
broadened, and the squeezed LL spectrum will be collapsed in type-III phase.
But, the LL collapse generally can not be found in the type-III charge-3 WP.
Moreover, for charge-n (n = 2, 3) WP, the quadratic tilt breaks the degeneracy
of the chiral LLs regardless of the direction of the magnetic field, leading to
additional optical transitions and magneto-optical conductivity peaks at low
frequencies. Interestingly, the four chiral LLs in charge-4 WP are always not
degenerate. Hence, there inevitably exist magneto-optical conductivity peaks at
low frequencies for charge-4 WP. Since the density of state of the LL spectrum
is very large, one can expect that the low-frequency magneto-optical responses
in unconventional WPs would be significant and may be used for developing
efficient terahertz photodetectors.

A deeper understanding of the differences between quantum and classical
dynamics promises great potential for emerging technologies. Nevertheless, some
aspects remain poorly understood, particularly concerning the role of quantum
coherence in open quantum systems. On the one hand, coherence leads to
entanglement and even nonlocality. On the other, it may lead to a suppression
of fluctuations, causing violations of thermo-kinetic uncertainty relations
(TUR/KUR) that are valid for classical processes. These represent two different
manifestations of coherence, one depending only on the state of the system
(static) and one depending on two-time correlation functions (dynamical). Here
we employ these manifestations of coherence to determine when mesoscopic
quantum transport can be captured by a classical model based on stochastic
jumps, and when such a model breaks down implying nonclassical behavior. To
this end, we focus on a minimal model of a double quantum dot coupled to two
thermal reservoirs. In this system, quantum tunneling induces Rabi oscillations
and results in both entanglement and nonlocality, as well as TUR/KUR
violations. These effects, which describe the breakdown of a classical
description, are accompanied by a peak in coherence. Our results provide
guiding principles for the design of out-of-equilibrium devices that exhibit
nonclassical behavior.

<h3>New duality relation for the Discrete Gaussian SOS model on a torus</h3>

<br>
<i>F. Cornu, H.J. Hilhorst, M. Bauer</i>
<br>

We construct a new duality for two-dimensional Discrete Gaussian models. It
is based on a known one-dimensional duality and on a mapping, implied by the
Chinese remainder theorem, between the sites of an $N\times M$ torus and those
of a ring of $NM$ sites. The duality holds for an arbitrary translation
invariant interaction potential $v(\mathbf{r})$ between the height variables on
the torus. It leads to pairs $(v,\widetilde{v})$ of mutually dual potentials
and to a temperature inversion according to $\widetilde{\beta}=\pi^2/\beta$.
When $v(\mathbf{r})$ is isotropic, duality renders an anisotropic
$\widetilde{v}$. This is the case, in particular, for the potential that is
dual to an isotropic nearest-neighbor potential. In the thermodynamic limit
this dual potential is shown to decay with distance according to an inverse
square law with a quadrupolar angular dependence. There is a single pair of
self-dual potentials $v^\star=\widetilde{v^\star}$. At the self-dual
temperature $\beta^\star=\widetilde{\beta^\star}=\pi$ the height-height
correlation can be calculated explicitly; it is anisotropic and diverges
logarithmically with distance.

Tellurium is a gyrotropic, p-type Weyl semiconductor with remarkable
electronic, optical, and transport properties. It has been argued that some of
these properties might stem from Weyl nodes at crossing points in the band
structure, and their nontrivial topological textures. However, Weyl nodes in
time-reversal invariant semiconductors are split up in energy, rather than in
momentum, and located deep below (far above) the top (bottom) of the valence
(conduction) band, challenging such an interpretation. Here, instead, we use a
4-band kp Hamiltonian for $p-$type tellurium to show how the k-dependent
spin-orbit interaction mixes up the top two (Weyl node free) and bottom two
(Weyl node containing) valence bands, generating a 3D hedgehog orbital magnetic
texture at the uppermost valence band, accessible to transport already at the
lowest doping. Hedgehog textures are important signatures of Weyl fermion
physics in general and in the context of condensed matter physics arise form
the carriers' wave packet rotation being locked to their propagation
wavevector. For spatially dispersive media, such an induced hedgehog
texture/carrier rotation stabilizes two novel, nonreciprocal and antisymmetric
components to the Hall transport within different weak-localization
(antilocalization) relaxation regimes: the anomalous and planar Hall effects,
usually forbidden by time reversal symmetry. Our AC magnetotransport
measurements on Sn-doped tellurium confirm the theoretical predictions and our
work demonstrates how Weyl signatures generally appear in transport on
enantiomorphic materials with natural optical activity.

The determination of the exact exponents of the KPZ class in any substrate
dimension $d$ is one of the most important open issues in Statistical Physics.
Based on the behavior of the dimensional variation of some exact exponent
differences for other growth equations, I find here that the KPZ growth
exponents (related to the temporal scaling of the fluctuations) are given by
$\beta_d = \frac{7}{8d+13}$. These exponents present an excellent agreement
with the most accurate estimates for them in the literature. Moreover, they are
confirmed here through extensive Monte Carlo simulations of discrete growth
models and real space renormalization group (RG) calculations for directed
polymers in random media (DPRM), up to $d=15$. The left-tail exponents of the
probability density functions for the DPRM energy provide another striking
verification of the analytical result above.

Recently 3d$^7$ Co$^{2+}$-based magnets with strong spin-orbit coupling
effects have been proposed to show dominant Kitaev magnetic exchange
interactions and a suppression of Heisenberg interactions. This makes them good
candidates to observe Kitaev quantum spin liquid behavior on honeycomb
lattices. Here we present physical properties and the phase diagram of a
prominent Co$^{2+}$-based Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate \NCTO{} for
magnetic fields along the $a$, $a^*$ and $c$-axis. We measured magnetization,
specific heat, dielectric constant, thermal expansion, and magnetocaloric
effect to 14 T for most measurements and 60 T for the magnetization along the
$a^*$- and the $c$-axis. At zero field we find no electric polarization, which
is more consistent with a zigzag antiferromagnetic state than a 3Q model that
was proposed. In applied fields sharp features in the dielectric constant
indicate the involvement of electric dipoles strongly coupled to magnetism that
locally break spatial inversion symmetry, though without net electric
polarization. We observe three successive field-induced phase transitions
before saturation is reached for fields along $a$ and $a^*$, and two new
temperature-induced phase boundaries in the spin-polarized phase. The
lowest-field boundary is strongly hysteretic whereas the others are all
second-order-like. The highest-field phase boundary has a mean field-like dome
shape in temperature-field space. Above the highest-field phase transition at
9.5 T for fields along $a$, $a^*$, the magnetocaloric effect shows a drop in
spin entropy continuing up at least 20 T, consistent with a spin gap opening.
Above 9.5 T the magnetization vs magnetic field approaches saturation, though
subject to an additional linear Van-Vleck-like contribution continuing to at
least 60 T...
