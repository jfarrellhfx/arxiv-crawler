<h3>Deconfinement Dynamics of Fractons in Tilted Bose-Hubbard Chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08455" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08455</a>

<i>Julian Boesl, Philip Zechmann, Johannes Feldmeier, Michael Knap</i>
<p>Fractonic constraints can lead to exotic properties of quantum many-body
systems. Here, we investigate the dynamics of fracton excitations on top of the
ground states of a one-dimemnsional, dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model. We
show that nearby fractons undergo a collective motion mediated by exchanging
virtual dipole excitations, which provides a powerful dynamical tool to
characterize the underlying ground state phases. We find that in the gapped
Mott insulating phase, fractons are confined to each other as motion requires
the exchange of massive dipoles. When crossing the phase transition into a
gapless Luttinger liquid of dipoles, fractons deconfine. Their transient
deconfinement dynamics scales diffusively and exhibits strong but subleading
contributions described by a quantum Lifshitz model. We examine prospects for
the experimental realization in tilted Bose-Hubbard chains by numerically
simulating the adiabatic state preparation and subsequent time evolution, and
find clear signatures of the low-energy fracton dynamics.

<h3>From chiral spin liquids to skyrmion fluids and crystals, and their  interplay with itinerant electrons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08468" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08468</a>
<br>
<i>F. A. Gómez Albarracín, H. D. Rosales, Masafumi Udagawa, P. Pujol, Ludovic D. C Jaubert</i>
<p>We present an in-depth study of the competition between skyrmions and a
chiral spin liquid in a model on the kagome lattice that was recently proposed
by some of the authors [H. D. Rosales, et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 106703
(2023)]. We present an analytical overview of the low-energy states using the
Luttinger-Tisza approximation. Then we add thermal fluctuations thanks to
large-scale Monte-Carlo simulations, and explore the entire parameter space
with a magnetic field $B$, in-plane $D^{xy}$ and out-of-plane $D^z$
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, using the ferromagnetic strength as unit of
energy. While skyrmions and the chiral spin liquid live in different regions of
parameter space, we show how to bring them together, stabilizing a skyrmion
fluid in between; a region where the density of well-defined skyrmions can be
tuned from quasi-zero (gas) to saturated (liquid) before ordering of the
skyrmions (solid). In particular, we investigate the two-dimensional melting of
the skyrmion solid. Our analysis also brings to light a long-range ordered
phase with Z$_3$ symmetry. To conclude, when conduction electrons are coupled
to the local spins, different chiral magnetic textures stabilized in this model
(skyrmion solid, liquid and gas \& chiral spin liquid) induce anomalous Quantum
Hall effect in the magnetically disordered skyrmion liquid for specific
band-filling fractions. Landau levels persist even in the skyrmion-liquid
regime in absence of broken translational symmetry and gradually disappear as
the skyrmion density decreases to form a gas.

<h3>Spin vestigial orders in extended Heisenberg-Kitaev models near hidden  SU(2) points: Application to \texorpdfstring{Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$}{Na2Co2TeO6}</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08475" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08475</a>
<br>
<i>Niccolò Francini, Lukas Janssen</i>
<p>The honeycomb magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ has recently been argued to realize
an approximate hidden SU(2) symmetry that can be understood by means of a
duality transformation. Using large-scale classical Monte Carlo simulations, we
study the finite-temperature phase diagram of the pertinent
Heisenberg-Kitaev-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ model near the hidden-SU(2)-symmetric
point, in the presence of a six-spin ring exchange perturbation. At low
temperatures, the model features collinear single-$\mathbf{q}$ zigzag and
noncollinear triple-$\mathbf{q}$ ground states, depending on the sign of the
ring exchange coupling. We show that in the vicinity of the
hidden-SU(2)-symmetric point, the magnetic long-range orders melt in two
stages. The corresponding finite-temperature transitions are continuous and
fall into 2D Ising and 2D Potts universality classes, respectively. The two
fluctuation-induced phases at intermediate temperatures spontaneously break
spin rotational and lattice translational symmetries, respectively, but both
leave time reversal symmetry intact. They are characterized by finite
expectation values of a real, symmetric, traceless, second-rank tensor, and are
naturally understood as vestigial orders of the underlying magnetic states. We
identify these vestigial orders as $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin nematic and
$\mathbb{Z}_4$ spin current density wave phases, respectively. For increasing
ring exchange perturbations, the width of the vestigial phases decreases,
eventually giving rise to a direct first-order transition from the
magnetically-ordered phase to the disordered paramagnet. We propose the
$\mathbb{Z}_4$ spin current density wave phase, which is the vestigial phase of
the primary triple-$\mathbf q$ magnetic order, as a natural candidate for the
paramagnetic 2D long-range-ordered state observed in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ in a
small window above the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature.

<h3>Electronic excitation spectra of molecular hydrogen in Phase I from  Quantum Monte Carlo and Many-Body perturbation methods</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08506" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08506</a>
<br>
<i>Vitaly Gorelov, Markus Holzmann, David M. Ceperley, Carlo Pierleoni</i>
<p>We study the electronic excitation spectra in solid molecular hydrogen (phase
I) at ambient temperature and 5-90 GPa pressures using Quantum Monte Carlo
methods and Many-Body Perturbation Theory. In this range, the system changes
from a wide gap molecular insulator to a semiconductor, altering the nature of
the excitations from localized to delocalized. Computed gaps and spectra agree
with experiments, proving the ability to predict accurately band gaps of
many-body systems in presence of nuclear quantum and thermal effects. We
explore changes in the electronic gap for the hydrogen isotopes.

<h3>Visualizing thickness-dependent magnetic textures in few-layer  $\text{Cr}_2\text{Ge}_2\text{Te}_6$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08529" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08529</a>
<br>
<i>Andriani Vervelaki, Kousik Bagani, Daniel Jetter, Manh-Ha Doan, Tuan K. Chau, Boris Gross, Dennis Christensen, Peter Bøggild, Martino Poggio</i>
<p>Magnetic ordering in two-dimensional (2D) materials has recently emerged as a
promising platform for data storage, computing, and sensing. To advance these
developments, it is vital to gain a detailed understanding of how the magnetic
order evolves on the nanometer-scale as a function of the number of atomic
layers and applied magnetic field. Here, we image few-layer
$\text{Cr}_2\text{Ge}_2\text{Te}_6$ using a combined scanning superconducting
quantum interference device and atomic force microscopy probe. Maps of the
material's stray magnetic field as a function of applied magnetic field reveal
its magnetization per layer as well as the thickness-dependent magnetic
texture. Using a micromagnetic model, we correlate measured stray-field
patterns with the underlying magnetization configurations, including labyrinth
domains and skyrmionic bubbles. Comparison between real-space images and
simulations demonstrates that the layer dependence of the material's magnetic
texture is a result of the thickness-dependent balance between crystalline and
shape anisotropy. These findings represent an important step towards 2D
spintronic devices with engineered spin configurations and controlled
dependence on external magnetic fields.

<h3>Unsupervised segmentation of irradiation$\unicode{x2010}$induced  order$\unicode{x2010}$disorder phase transitions in electron microscopy</h3>

<i>Arman H Ter-Petrosyan, Jenna A Bilbrey, Christina M Doty, Bethany E Matthews, Le Wang, Yingge Du, Eric Lang, Khalid Hattar, Steven R Spurgeon</i>
<p>We present a method for the unsupervised segmentation of electron microscopy
images, which are powerful descriptors of materials and chemical systems.
Images are oversegmented into overlapping chips, and similarity graphs are
generated from embeddings extracted from a domain$\unicode{x2010}$pretrained
convolutional neural network (CNN). The Louvain method for community detection
is then applied to perform segmentation. The graph representation provides an
intuitive way of presenting the relationship between chips and communities. We
demonstrate our method to track irradiation$\unicode{x2010}$induced amorphous
fronts in thin films used for catalysis and electronics. This method has
potential for "on$\unicode{x2010}$the$\unicode{x2010}$fly" segmentation to

<h3>Theory of mobility edge and non-ergodic extended phase in coupled random  matrices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08643" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08643</a>
<br>
<i>Xiaoshui Lin, Guang-Can Guo, Ming Gong</i>
<p>The mobility edge, as a central concept in disordered models for
localization-delocalization transitions, has rarely been discussed in the
context of random matrix theory (RMT). Here we report a new class of random
matrix model by direct coupling between two random matrices, showing that their
overlapped spectra and un-overlapped spectra exhibit totally different scaling
behaviors, which can be used to construct tunable mobility edges. This model is
a direct generalization of the Rosenzweig-Porter model, which hosts ergodic,
localized, and non-ergodic extended (NEE) phases. A generic theory for these
phase transitions is presented, which applies equally well to dense, sparse,
and even corrected random matrices in different ensembles. We show that the
phase diagram is fully characterized by two scaling exponents, and they are
mapped out in various conditions. Our model provides a general framework to
realize the mobility edges and non-ergodic phases in a controllable way in RMT,
which pave avenue for many intriguing applications both from the pure
mathematics of RMT and the possible implementations of ME in many-body models,
chiral symmetry breaking in QCD and the stability of the large ecosystems.

<h3>Strongly pinned skyrmionic bubbles and higher-order nonlinear Hall  resistances at the interface of Pt/FeSi bilayer</h3>

<i>T. Hori, N. Kanazawa, K. Matsuura, H. Ishizuka, K. Fujiwara, A. Tsukazaki, M. Ichikawa, M. Kawasaki, F. Kagawa, M. Hirayama, Y. Tokura</i>
<p>Engineering of magnetic heterostructures for spintronic applications has
entered a new phase, driven by the recent discoveries of topological materials
and exfoliated van der Waals materials. Their low-dimensional properties can be
dramatically modulated in designer heterostructures via proximity effects from
adjacent materials, thus enabling the realization of diverse quantum states and
functionalities. Here we investigate spin-orbit coupling (SOC) proximity
effects of Pt on the recently discovered quasi-two-dimensional ferromagnetic
state at FeSi surface. Skyrmionic bubbles (SkBs) are formed as a result of the
enhanced interfacial Dzyloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The strong pinning
effects on the SkBs are evidenced from the significant dispersion in size and
shape of the SkBs and are further identified as a greatly enhanced threshold
current density required for depinning of the SkBs. The robust integrity of the
SkB assembly leads to the emergence of higher-order nonlinear Hall effects in
the high current density regime, which originate from nontrivial Hall effects
due to the noncollinearity of the spin texture, as well as from the
current-induced magnetization dynamics via the augmented spin-orbit torque.

<h3>Realization of corner and helical edge states in topologically trivial  band gap by twig edge</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08733" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08733</a>
<br>
<i>Jianfei Li, Ying Wang, Zhongxiang Zhou, Jingfeng Yao, Zhihao Lan, Chengxun Yuan</i>
<p>The twig edge states in graphene-like structures are viewed as the fourth
states complementary to their zigzag, bearded, and armchair counterparts. In
this work, we study a rod-in-plasma system in honeycomb lattice with twig edges
under external magnetic fields and lattice scaling and show that twig edge
states can exist in different phases of the system, such as quantum Hall phase,
quantum spin Hall phase and insulating phase. The twig edge states in the
quantum Hall phase exhibit robust one-way transmission property immune to
backscattering and thus provide a novel avenue for solving the plasma
communication blackout problem. Moreover, we demonstrate that corner and edge
states can exist within the trivial band gap of the insulating phase by
modulating the on-site potential of the twig edges. Especially, helical edge
states with the unique feature of pseudospin-momentum locking that could be
exited by chiral sources are demonstrated at the twig edges within the trivial
band gap. Our results show that many topological-like behaviors of
electromagnetic waves are not necessarily tied to the exact topology of the
systems and the twig edges and interface engineering can bring new
opportunities for more flexible manipulation of electromagnetic waves.

<h3>Probing Iron in Earth's Core With Molecular-Spin Dynamics</h3>

<p>Dynamic compression of iron to Earth-core conditions is one of the few ways
to gather important elastic and transport properties needed to uncover key
mechanisms surrounding the geodynamo effect. Herein a new machine-learned
ab-initio derived molecular-spin dynamics (MSD) methodology with explicit
treatment for longitudinal spin-fluctuations is utilized to probe the dynamic
phase-diagram of iron. This framework uniquely enables an accurate resolution
of the phase-transition kinetics and Earth-core elastic properties, as
highlighted by compressional wave velocity and adiabatic bulk moduli
measurements. In addition, a unique coupling of MSD with time-dependent density
functional theory enables gauging electronic transport properties, critically
important for resolving geodynamo dynamics.

<br>
<i>Nathan Ronceray, Massimo Spina, Vanessa Hui Yin Chou, Chwee Teck Lim, Andre K. Geim, Slaven Garaj</i>
<p>Biological nanostructures change their shape and function in response to
external stimuli, and significant efforts have been made to design artificial
biomimicking devices operating on similar principles. In this work we
demonstrate a programmable nanofluidic switch, driven by elastocapillarity, and
based on nanochannels built from layered two-dimensional nanomaterials
possessing atomically smooth surfaces and exceptional mechanical properties. We
explore operational modes of the nanoswitch and develop a theoretical framework
to explain the phenomenon. By predicting the switching-reversibility phase
diagram - based on material, interfacial and wetting properties, as well as the
geometry of the nanofluidic circuit - we rationally design switchable
nano-capsules capable of enclosing zeptoliter volumes of liquid, as small as
the volumes enclosed in viruses. The nanoswitch will find useful application as
an active element in integrated nanofluidic circuitry and could be used to
explore nanoconfined chemistry and biochemistry, or be incorporated into
shape-programmable materials.

<h3>Filled Colloidal Gel Rheology: Strengthening, Softening, and Tuneability</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08751" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08751</a>
<br>
<i>Yujie Jiang, Yang Cui, Yankai Li, Zhiwei Liu, Christopher Ness, Ryohei Seto</i>
<p>Filler-induced strengthening is ubiquitous in material science and is
particularly well-established in polymeric nanocomposites. Despite having
similar constituents, colloidal gels with solid filling exhibit distinct
rheology, which is poorly understood. We show using experiments and simulations
that filling monotonically enhances the yield stress of colloidal gels, while
the elastic modulus first increases before decreasing. The latter effect
results from a disturbed gel matrix at dense filling, evidenced by a growing
inter-phase stress. This structural frustration is, however, not detrimental to
yielding resistance. Instead, fillers offer additional mechanical support to
the gel backbone via percolating force chains, at the same time decreasing the
yield strain. We develop a mechanistic picture of this phenomenology that leads
us to a novel `filler-removal protocol,' making possible individual control
over the strength and brittleness of a composite gel.

<h3>Infrared Imaging of Magnetic Octupole Domains in Non-collinear  Antiferromagnets</h3>

<br>
<i>Peng Wang, Wei Xia, Jinhui Shen, Yulong Chen, Wenzhi Peng, Jiachen Zhang, Haolin Pan, Xuhao Yu, Zheng Liu, Yang Gao, Qian Niu, Zhian Xu, Hongtao Yang, Yanfeng Guo, Dazhi Hou</i>
<p>Magnetic structure plays a pivotal role in the functionality of
antiferromagnets (AFMs), which not only can be employed to encode digital data
but also yields novel phenomena. Despite its growing significance, visualizing
the antiferromagnetic domain structure remains a challenge, particularly for
non-collinear AFMs. Currently, the observation of magnetic domains in
non-collinear antiferromagnetic materials is feasible only in Mn$_{3}$Sn,
underscoring the limitations of existing techniques that necessitate distinct
methods for in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic domain imaging. In this study,
we present a versatile method for imaging the antiferromagnetic domain
structure in a series of non-collinear antiferromagnetic materials by utilizing
the anomalous Ettingshausen effect (AEE), which resolves both the magnetic
octupole moments parallel and perpendicular to the sample surface. Temperature
modulation due to the AEE originating from different magnetic domains is
measured by the lock-in thermography, revealing distinct behaviors of octupole
domains in different antiferromagnets. This work delivers an efficient
technique for the visualization of magnetic domains in non-collinear AFMs,
which enables comprehensive study of the magnetization process at the
microscopic level and paves the way for potential advancements in applications.

<h3>Topological Domain-Wall States Hosting Quantized Polarization and  Majorana Zero Modes Without Bulk Boundary Correspondence</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08771" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08771</a>
<br>
<i>Sang-Hoon Han, Myungjun Kang, Moon Jip Park, Sangmo Cheon</i>
<p>Bulk-boundary correspondence is a concept for topological insulators and
superconductors that determines the existence of topological boundary states
within the tenfold classification table. Contrary to this belief, we
demonstrate that topological domain-wall states can emerge in all forbidden 1D
classes in the classification table using representative generalized
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Kitaev models, which manifests as quantized electric
dipole moments and Majorana zero modes, respectively. We first show that a
zero-energy domain-wall state can possess a quantized polarization, even if the
polarization of individual domains is not inherently quantized. A quantized
Berry phase difference between the domains confirms the non-trivial nature of
the domain-wall states, implying a general-bulk-boundary principle, further
confirmed by the tight-binding, topological field, and low-energy effective
theories. Our methodology is then extended to a superconducting system,
resulting in Majorana zero modes on the domain wall of a generalized Kitaev
model. Finally, we suggest potential systems where our results may be realized,
spanning from condensed matter to optical.

<i>Gu-Wen Chen, Liang Xu, Yao-Ming Li, Zhi-Pan Liu, Sheng-Cai Zhu</i>
<p>The shock strength dependent formation of diamond represents one of the most
intriguing questions in graphite research. Using ab initio DFT-trained carbon
GNN model, we observe a strength-dependent graphite transition under shock. The
poor sliding caused by scarce sliding time under high-strength shock forms
hexagonal diamond with an orientation of (001)G//(100)HD+[010]G//[010]HD; under
low-strength shock, cubic diamond forms after enough sliding time, unveiling
the strength-dependent graphite transition. We provide computational evidence
of the strength-dependent graphite transition from first principles, clarifying
the long-term shock-induced hexagonal formation and structural
strength-dependent trend source.

<h3>Growth and Characterization of $β$-Mn Structured CoZn Thin Films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08824" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08824</a>
<br>
<i>M. Dearg, G. Burnell, S. Langridge, C. H. Marrows</i>
<p>Thin films of polycrystalline $\beta$-Mn structure CoZn have been grown on
thermally oxidized Si substrates by co-sputtering from elemental targets
followed by annealing. A range of films grown with variable Co deposition power
and fixed Zn deposition power were produced, so as to vary the proportions of
the two elements reaching the substrate, which were annealed post-growth.
Whilst all films exhibited a (211) $\beta$-Mn structure CoZn texture in X-ray
diffraction, transmission electron microscopy showed that the composition with
the highest integrated intensity for that Bragg peak contained large vacancies
and was covered by a thick ZnO cap owing to being Co-deficient overall. CoZn
films deposited at ratios tuned to give the optimal volume fraction of
$\beta$-Mn were continuous, with crystallites up to 200~nm in size, with a much
thinner ZnO cap layer. Magnetic measurements show that such optimal CoZn films
have a Curie temperature $T_\mathrm{C} \sim 420$~K and saturation magnetization
of 120~emu/cm$^3$, properties close to those reported for bulk crystals. The
$\beta$-Mn structure is chiral (P4$_{1}$32/P4$_{3}$32 space group) and is known
to give rise to a Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya interaction (DMI) that stabilizes
room-temperature skyrmions in the bulk. Our thin films are thus a potential
materials platform, compatible with planar processing technology, for magnetic
skyrmions arising from a bulk DMI.

<h3>Unravelling Interaction and Temperature Contributions in Unpolarized  Trapped Fermionic Atoms in the BCS Regime</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08853" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08853</a>
<br>
<i>Sejung Yong, Sian Barbosa, Jennifer Koch, Felix Lang, Axel Pelster, Artur Widera</i>
<p>In the BCS limit density profiles for unpolarized trapped fermionic clouds of
atoms are largely featureless. Therefore, it is a delicate task to analyze them
in order to quantify their respective interaction and temperature
contributions. Temperature measurements have so far been mostly considered in
an indirect way, where one sweeps isentropically from the BCS to the BEC limit.
Instead we suggest here a direct thermometry, which relies on measuring the
column density and comparing the obtained data with a Hartree-Bogoliubov
mean-field theory combined with a local density approximation. In case of an
attractive interaction between two-components of $^{6}$Li atoms trapped in a
tri-axial harmonic confinement we show that minimizing the error within such an
experiment-theory collaboration turns out to be a reasonable criterion for
analyzing in detail measured densities and, thus, for ultimately determining
the sample temperatures. The findings are discussed in view of various possible
sources of errors.

<h3>Stark-Many body localization in interacting infinite dimensional systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08893" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08893</a>
<br>
<i>Hristiana Atanasova, André Erpenbeck, Emanuel Gull, Yevgeny Bar Lev, Guy Cohen</i>
<p>We study bulk particle transport in a Fermi-Hubbard model on an
infinite-dimensional Bethe lattice, driven by a constant electric field.
Previous numerical studies showed that one dimensional analogs of this system
exhibit a breakdown of diffusion due to Stark many-body localization
(Stark-MBL) at least up to time which scales exponentially with the system
size. Here, we consider systems initially in a spin density wave state using a
combination of numerically exact and approximate techniques. We show that for
sufficiently weak electric fields, the wave's momentum component decays
exponentially with time in a way consistent with normal diffusion. By studying
different wavelengths, we extract the dynamical exponent and the generalized
diffusion coefficient at each field strength. Interestingly, we find a
non-monotonic dependence of the dynamical exponent on the electric field. As
the field increases towards a critical value proportional to the Hubbard
interaction strength, transport slows down, becoming sub-diffusive. At large
interaction strengths, however, transport speeds up again with increasing
field, exhibiting super-diffusive characteristics when the electric field is
comparable to the interaction strength. Eventually, at the large field limit,
localization occurs and the current through the system is suppressed.

<h3>Flow curve approximation using Avitzur's model for barreling compression  test</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08900" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08900</a>
<br>
<i>Soheil Solhjoo</i>
<p>The combination of the Cylindrical Profile Model (CPM) and Avitzur's model is
commonly used to determine flow stress curves in material testing using
compression test. In this process, stress is corrected for friction using
Avitzur's model and the average strain is calculated from CPM. This study
proposes a method for estimating strain based on Avitzur's model. The presented
case studies demonstrate the impact of this strain correction on the flow
curves. The results show that increasing friction leads to higher strain values
at the center of the sample due to barreling. The proposed method provides a
more accurate interpretation of compression test results.

<h3>Evidence for charge delocalization crossover in the quantum critical  superconductor CeRhIn$_5$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08928" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08928</a>
<br>
<i>Honghong Wang, Tae Beom Park, Jihyun Kim, Harim Jang, Eric D. Bauer, Joe D. Thompson, Tuson Park</i>
<p>The nature of charge degrees-of-freedom distinguishes scenarios for
interpreting the character of a second order magnetic transition at zero
temperature, that is, a magnetic quantum critical point (QCP). Heavy-fermion
systems are prototypes of this paradigm, and in those, the relevant question is
where, relative to a magnetic QCP, does the Kondo effect delocalize their
$f$-electron degrees-of-freedom. Herein, we use pressure-dependent Hall
measurements to identify a finite-temperature scale $E_\text{loc}$ that signals
a crossover from $f$-localized to $f$-delocalized character. As a function of
pressure, $E_\text{loc}(P)$ extrapolates smoothly to zero temperature at the
antiferromagnetic QCP of CeRhIn$_5$ where its Fermi surface reconstructs,
hallmarks of Kondo-breakdown criticality that generates critical magnetic and
charge fluctuations. In 4.4% Sn-doped CeRhIn$_5$, however, $E_\text{loc}(P)$
extrapolates into its magnetically ordered phase and is decoupled from the
pressure-induced magnetic QCP, which implies a spin-density-wave (SDW) type of
criticality that produces only critical fluctuations of the SDW order
parameter. Our results demonstrate the importance of experimentally determining
$E_\text{loc}$ to characterize quantum criticality and the associated
consequences for understanding the pairing mechanism of superconductivity that
reaches a maximum $T_\text{c}$ in both materials at their respective magnetic
QCP.

<h3>The Anatomy of a Topological Phase Transition in a 2D Chern Insulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08932" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08932</a>
<br>
<i>Arjo Dasgupta, Indra Dasgupta</i>
<p>The onset of the topological phase transition in a two-dimensional model for
a Chern Insulator, namely the Qi-Wu-Zhang(QWZ) model, is illustrated, with
particular emphasis on the appearance of chiral edge-modes. The edge-modes are
studied by analysing the dynamics of the edge-states in an equivalent model for
a one-dimensional charge pump, using a technique known as dimensional
extension. A further real-space analysis allows us to explain the onset of the
topological phase transition in terms of time-reversal symmetry breaking and to
quantitatively study the localisation of the edge-modes.

<p>Rare-earth-based triangular-lattice magnets provide the fertile ground to
explore the exotic quantum magnetic state. Herein, we report a new family of
RE-based triangular-lattice magnets Ba6RE2Ti4O17(RE= rare earth ions)
crystallized into the hexagonal structure with space group of P63 mmc, where
magnetic rare earth ions form an ideal triangular lattice within the ab-plane
and stack in an AA -type fashion along the c-axis. The low-temperature magnetic
susceptibility results reveal all the serial compounds have the dominant
antiferromagnetic interactions and an absence of magnetic ordering down to 1.8
K. The magnetization and electron spin resonance results indicate distinct
magnetic anisotropy for the compounds with different RE ions. Moreover,
Ba6Nd2Ti4O17 single crystal is successfully grown and it exhibits strong Ising
like anisotropy with magnetic easy-axis perpendicular to the triangle-lattice
plane, being a candidate to explore quantum spin liquid state with dominant
Ising-type interaction.

<h3>Klein tunneling degradation and enhanced Fabry-Pérot interference in  graphene/h-BN moiré-superlattice devices</h3>

<i>Viet-Anh Tran, Viet-Hung Nguyen, Jean-Christophe Charlier</i>
<p>Hexagonal boron-nitride (h-BN) provides an ideal substrate for supporting
graphene devices to achieve fascinating transport properties, such as Klein
tunneling, electron optics and other novel quantum transport phenomena.
However, depositing graphene on h-BN creates moir\'e superlattices, whose
electronic properties can be significantly manipulated by controlling the
lattice alignment between layers. In this work, the effects of these moir\'e
structures on the transport properties of graphene are investigated using
atomistic simulations. At large misalignment angles (leading to small moir\'e
cells), the transport properties (most remarkably, Klein tunneling) of pristine
graphene devices are conserved. On the other hand, in the nearly aligned cases,
the moir\'e interaction induces stronger effects, significantly affecting
electron transport in graphene. In particular, Klein tunneling is significantly
degraded. In contrast, strong Fabry-P\'erot interference (accordingly, strong
quantum confinement) effects and non-linear I-V characteristics are observed.
P-N interface smoothness engineering is also considered, suggesting as a
potential way to improve these transport features in graphene/h-BN devices.

<p>The 2D semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (e.g., WS2) host
strong coupling between various degrees of freedom leading to potential
applications in next-generation device applications including optoelectronics.
Such applications are strongly influenced by defects which can control both the
optical and electronic properties of the material. We demonstrate the
possibility to tailor the defect-related electronic states and the lattice
dynamics properties of WS2 in their heterostructures with h-BN which host a
strong interlayer coupling between the charge carriers in the WS2 layer and the
phonons of h-BN. This coupling is observed to induce modifications to the
interlayer phonons (manifested by their modified Raman-activity) and to the
charge carrier mobilities in the WS2 layer (which results in creation of
mid-gap energy states associated with many-body quasiparticle states). Our
study also includes a detailed characterization of the defects through Raman
measurements revealing an A_1g-type nature with differential resonance behavior
for the modes that are related to defect scattering with respect to the other
normal phonon modes of WS2.

<p>Utilizing an interplay between band topology and intrinsic magnetism, the
two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) system MnBi_2Te_4 provides an ideal
platform for realizing exotic quantum phenomena and offers great opportunities
in the emerging field of antiferromagnetic spintronic technology. Yet, the
fabrication of MnBi_2Te_4-based nanodevices is hindered by the high sensitivity
of this material, which quickly degrades when exposed to air or to elevated
temperatures. Here, we demonstrate an alternative route of fabricating
vdW-MnBi_2Te_4-based electronic devices using the cryogenic dry transfer of a
printable circuit embedded in an inorganic silicon nitride membrane. The
electrical connections between the thin crystal and the top surface of the
membrane are established through via contacts. Our magnetotransport study
reveals that this innovative via contact approach enables exploring the
MnBi_2Te_4-like sensitive 2D materials and engineering synthetic
heterostructures as well as complex circuits based on the two-dimensional vdW
systems.

<h3>Transport theory in non-Hermitian systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Qing Yan, Hailong Li, Qing-Feng Sun, X. C. Xie</i>
<p>Non-Hermitian systems have garnered significant attention due to the
emergence of novel topology of complex spectra and skin modes. However,
investigating transport phenomena in such systems faces obstacles stemming from
the non-unitary nature of time evolution. Here, we establish the continuity
equation for a general non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in the Schr\"odinger picture.
It attributes the universal non-conservativity to the anti-commutation
relationship between particle number and non-Hermitian terms. Our work derives
a comprehensive current formula for non-Hermitian systems using Green's
function, applicable to both time-dependent and steady-state responses. To
demonstrate the validity of our approach, we calculate the local current in
models with one-dimensional and two-dimensional settings, incorporating
scattering potentials. The spatial distribution of local current highlights the
widespread non-Hermitian phenomena, including skin modes, non-reciprocal
quantum dots, and corner states. Our findings offer valuable insights for
advancing theoretical and experimental research in the transport of
non-Hermitian systems.

<h3>Transport properties of strongly correlated Fermi systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08974" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08974</a>
<br>
<i>V.R. Shaginyan, A.Z. Msezane, M.V. Zverev</i>
<p>In our short review, we consider the transport properties of strongly
correlated Fermi systems like heavy fermion metals and high-$T_c$
superconductors. Their transport properties are defined by strong
inter-particle interaction forming flat bands in these compounds. Indeed, in
contrast to the behavior of the transport properties of conventional metals,
the strongly correlated compounds exhibit the linear in temperature
resistivity, $\rho(T)\propto T$. We analyze the magnetoresistance and show that
it under the application of magnetic field becomes negative. It is shown that
near a quantum phase transition, when the density of electronic states
diverges, semiclassical physics remains applicable to describe the resistivity
$\rho$ of strongly correlated metals due to the presence of a transverse
zero-sound collective mode, representing the phonon mode in solids. We
demonstrate that when $T$ exceeds the extremely low Debye temperature $T_D$,
the resistivity $\rho(T)$ changes linearly with $T$, since the mechanism of
formation of the $T$-dependence $\rho(T)$ is similar electron-phonon mechanism,
which predominates at high temperatures in ordinary metals. Thus, in the region
of $T$-linear resistance, electron-phonon scattering leads to a lifetime of
$\tau$ quasiparticles practically independent of the material, which is
expressed as the ratio of the Planck constant $\hbar$ to the Boltzmann constant
constant $k_B$, $T\tau\sim \hbar/k_B$. We explain that due to the
non-Fermi-liquid behavior the real part of the frequency-dependent optical
conductivity $\sigma^R_{opt}(\omega)$ exhibits a scaling behavior, and
demonstrates the unusual power law behavior
$\sigma^R_{opt}(\omega)\propto\omega^{-1}$, rather than the well-known one
shown by conventional metals, $\sigma^R_{opt}(\omega)\propto\omega^{-2}$.

<h3>Local strain enhanced switching of magnetic tunnel junctions for energy  efficient computing</h3>

<p>Strain-controlled modulation of the magnetic switching behavior in magnetic
tunnel junctions (MTJs) could provide the energy efficiency needed to
accelerate the use of MTJs in memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing, as
well as an additional way to tune MTJ properties for these applications.
State-of-the-art CoFeB-MgO based MTJs still require too high voltages to alter
their magnetic switching behavior with strain. In this study, we demonstrate
strain-enhanced field switching of nanoscale MTJs through electric field
control via voltage applied across local gates. The results show that
record-low voltage down to 200 mV can be used to control the switching field of
the MTJ through enhancing the magnetic anisotropy, and that tunnel
magnetoresistance is linearly enhanced with voltage through straining the
crystal structure of the tunnel barrier. These findings underscore the
potential of electric field manipulation and strain engineering as effective
strategies for tailoring the properties and functionality of nanoscale MTJs.

<p>Two dimensional (2D) layered transition-metal-based tellurides (chalcogens)
are known to harness their surface atoms characteristics to enhance
topographical activities for energy conversion, storage, and magnetic
applications. High surface energy due to unsaturated dangling bonds and larger
lateral size than the thickness (volume) makes them a potential candidate for
emerging electronics. Nevertheless, the gradual stacking of each sheet alters
the surface atoms' subtle features, such as lattice expansion, leading to
several phenomena and rendering tunable properties. In the present work, we
have monitored thickness-dependent properties of the 2D CoTe2 sheets from
nanoscale mechanics, tribology, surface potential distributions, interfacial
interaction and magnetism using atomically resolved spectroscopy and different
surface probe techniques, in conjunction with theoretical investigations:
density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD). The variation in
properties observed in theoretical investigation unleashes the crucial role of
crystal planes of the CoTe2. The presented results are beneficial in expanding
the use of 2D telluride family in flexible electronics, piezo sensors,
tribo-generator, and next-generation memory devices.

<h3>Josephson Diode Effect in Topological Superconductor</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09009" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09009</a>
<br>
<i>Zhaochen Liu, Linghao Huang, Jing Wang</i>
<p>We investigate the Josephson diode effect in topological Josephson junctions.
We find that while a Josephson junction in the topological phase may exhibit
higher diode efficiency compared to that in the trivial phase, this behavior is
not universal. The presence of Majorana bound states is not a sufficient
condition for a large diode effect. Furthermore, the diode efficiency undergoes
substantial changes only in specific regions along the topological phase
transition boundary, and a significant diode effect does coincide with the
topological phases. Thereby the Josephson diode effect may be serves as a weak
indicator for topological superconductor phase. These results suggest a nuanced
relationship between the topological aspects of Josephson junctions and
Josephson diode effect.

<h3>Exact first-order effect of interactions on the ground-state energy of  harmonically-confined fermions</h3>

<br>
<i>Pierre Le Doussal, Naftali R. Smith, Nathan Argaman</i>
<p>We consider a system of $N$ spinless fermions, interacting with each other
via a power-law interaction $\epsilon/r^n$, and trapped in an external harmonic
potential $V(r) = r^2/2$, in $d=1,2,3$ dimensions. For any $0 < n < d+2$, we
obtain the ground-state energy $E_N$ of the system perturbatively in
$\epsilon$, $E_{N}=E_{N}^{\left(0\right)}+\epsilon
E_{N}^{\left(1\right)}+O\left(\epsilon^{2}\right)$. We calculate
$E_{N}^{\left(1\right)}$ exactly, assuming that $N$ is such that the "outer
shell" is filled. For the case of a Coulomb interaction $n=1$, we extract the
$N \gg 1$ behavior of $E_{N}^{\left(1\right)}$, focusing on the corrections to
the exchange term with respect to the leading-order term that is predicted from
the local density approximation applied to the Thomas-Fermi approximate density
distribution. The leading correction contains a logarithmic divergence, and is
of particular importance in the context of density functional theory. We also
study the effect of the interactions on the fermions' spatial density. Finally,
we find that our result for $E_{N}^{\left(1\right)}$ significantly simplifies
in the case where $n$ is even.

<br>
<i>Yi-Ting Tseng, M. O. Malcolms, Henri Menke, Marcel Klett, Thomas Schäfer, P. Hansmann</i>
<p>We compare the dynamical mean-field descriptions of the single-band Hubbard
model and the three-band Emery model at the one- and two-particle level for
parameters relevant to high-Tc superconductors. We show that even within
dynamical mean-field theory, accounting solely for temporal fluctuations, the
intrinsic multi-orbital nature of the Emery model introduces effective
non-local correlations. These lead to a non-Curie-like temperature-dependence
of the magnetic susceptibility, also seen in nuclear magnetic resonance
experiments in the pseudogap regime by M. Avramovska, et al. [Journal of
Superconductivity and Novel Magnetism 33, 2621 (2020)]. We demonstrate the
agreement of our results with these experiments for a large range of dopings
and trace back the effective non-local correlations to an emerging
oxygen-copper singlet by analyzing a minimal finite-size cluster model. Despite
this correct description of the hallmark of the pseudogap at the two-particle
level, i.e., the drop in the Knight shift of nuclear magnetic resonance,
dynamical mean-field theory fails to properly describe the spectral properties
of the pseudogap.

<h3>Metal-free Stoner and Mott-Hubbard magnetism in 2D polymers with  honeycomb lattice</h3>

<i>Hongde Yu, Thomas Heine</i>
<p>We computationally demonstrate Stoner-ferromagnetic half-metals and
antiferromagnetic Mott-Hubbard insulators in metal-free 2D polymers. Coupling
radicaloid (hetero)triangulene monomers via strong covalent bonds preserving
the in-plane conjugation of the electronic {\pi} system yields 2D crystals with
long-range magnetic order and magnetic couplings above the Landauer limit.
Dual-site honeycomb lattices produce both flat bands and Dirac cones. Depending
on the monomers, electron correlations lead to either a bandgap at the Dirac
points for antiferromagnetic Mott insulators, or Stoner ferromagnetism with
both spin-polarized Dirac cones and flat bands at the Fermi level. These
results pioneer a new type of Stoner and Mott-Hubbard magnetism emerging in the
electronic pi system of crystalline conjugated 2D polymers.

<p>The family of transition metal dipnictides (TMDs) has been of theoretical and
experimental interest because this family hosts topological states and
extremely large magnetoresistance (MR). Recently, TaAs2, a member of this
family, has been predicted to support a topological crystalline insulating
state. Here, by using high resolution. Angle resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES), we reveal both closed and open pockets in the metallic
Fermi surface and linearly dispersive bands on the (201) surface, along with
the presence of extreme MR observed from magneto-transport measurements. A
comparison of the ARPES results with first-principles computations show that
the linearly dispersive bands on the measured surface of TaAs2 are trivial bulk
bands. The absence of symmetry-protected surface state on the (201) surface
indicates its topologically dark nature. The presence of open Fermi surface
features suggests that the open orbit fermiology could contribute to the
extremely large MR of TaAs.

<i>Che Chen Tho, Xukun Feng, Zhuoling Jiang, Liemao Cao, Chit Siong Lau, San-Dong Guo, Yee Sin Ang</i>
<p>Recent discovery of ultrathick $\mathrm{MoSi_2N_4(MoN)_n}$ monolayers open up
an exciting platform to engineer 2D material properties via intercalation
architecture. Here we computationally investigate a series of ultrathick
MA$_2$N$_4$(M'N) monolayers (M, M' = Mo, W; A = Si, Ge) under both homolayer
and heterolayer intercalation architectures in which the same and different
species of transition metal nitride inner core layers are intercalated by outer
passivating nitride sublayers, respectively. The MA$_2$N$_4$(M'N) monolayers
are thermally, dynamically and mechanically stable with excellent mechanical
strength and metallic properties. Intriguingly, the metallic states around
Fermi level are localized within the inner core layers. Carrier conduction
mediated by electronic states around the Fermi level is thus spatially
insulated from the external environment by the native outer nitride sublayers,
suggesting the potential of MA$_2$N$_4$(M'N) in back-end-of-line (BEOL) metal
interconnect applications. Nitrogen vacancy defect at the outer sublayers
creates `punch through' states around the Fermi level that bridges the carrier
conduction in the inner core layers and the outer environment, forming a
electrical contact akin to the `vias' structures of metal interconnects. We
further show that MoSi$_2$N$_4$(MoN) can serve as a quasi-Ohmic contact to 2D
WSe$_2$. These findings reveal the promising potential of ultrathick
MA$_2$N$_4$(MN) monolayers as metal electrodes and BEOL interconnect
applications.

<br>
<i>Xiaoliang Xiao, Yuanjun Jin, Da-Shuai Ma, Haoran Wei, Jing Fan, Rui Wang, Xiaozhi Wu</i>
<p>The realization of single-pair chiral fermions in Weyl systems remains
challenging in topology physics, especially for the systems with higher chiral
charges $|C|$. In this work, based on the symmetry analysis and low-energy
effective model, we propose that single-pair high-fold topological fermions
with $C$ = $\pm{2}$ can be achieved in chiral space groups P2$_1$3, P4$_3$32,
and P4$_1$32. Here, a single pair of Weyl points with the oppositely chiral
charges of $|C| = 2$ has been proved by the minimal lattice model and shows the
unique characteristics compared to multi-pair Weyl fermionic systems, including
the larger nontrivial energy window and the ultralong double Fermi arcs
extended to the whole Brillouin zone. Furthermore, we show the first ultralight
chiral crystal P4$_3$32-type LiC$_2$ and its inversion enantiomer as
high-quality candidate materials, whose Weyl nodes exhibit the large linear
energy range to surmount the interruption of irrelevant bands, and we observe a
reversal of their Fermi-arc velocities. Our work not only provides a promising
platform for detecting ultralong chiral fermi arcs but also certainly leads to
continued exploration of unconventional fermions.

<i>F. Terragni, W. D. Martinson, M. Carretero, P. K. Maini, L. L. Bonilla</i>
<p>Complex biological processes involve collective behavior of entities
(bacteria, cells, animals) over many length and time scales and can be
described by discrete models that track individuals or by continuum models
involving densities and fields. We consider hybrid stochastic agent-based
models of branching morphogenesis and angiogenesis (new blood vessel creation
from pre-existing vasculature), which treat cells as individuals that are
guided by underlying continuous chemical and/or mechanical fields. In these
descriptions, leader (tip) cells emerge from existing branches and follower
(stalk) cells build the new sprout in their wake. Vessel branching and fusion
(anastomosis) occur as a result of tip and stalk cell dynamics. Coarse-graining
these hybrid models in appropriate limits produces continuum partial
differential equations (PDEs) for endothelial cell densities that are more
analytically tractable. While these models differ in nonlinearity, they produce
similar equations at leading order when chemotaxis is dominant. We analyze this
leading order system in a simple quasi-one-dimensional geometry and show that
the numerical solution of the leading order PDE is well described by a soliton
wave that evolves from vessel to source. This wave is an attractor for
intermediate times until it arrives at the hypoxic region releasing the growth
factor. The mathematical techniques used here thus identify common features of
discrete and continuum approaches and provide insight into general biological
mechanisms governing their collective dynamics.

<h3>Orbital degree of freedom in high entropy oxides</h3>

<br>
<i>Jiaqiang Yan, Abinash Kumar, Miaofang Chi, Matthew Brahlek, Thomas Z Ward, Michael McGuire</i>
<p>The spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom and their interplay in high
entropy oxides were intensively investigated in recent years. However, how the
orbital degree of freedom is affected by the extreme disorder in high entropy
oxides hasn't been studied. In this work, using perovskite structured
\textit{R}VO$_3$ as a materials playground, we report how the disorder arising
from mixing different rare earth ions at the rare earth site affects the
orbital ordering of V$^{3+}$ t$_{2g}$-electrons. Since each member of
\textit{R}VO$_3$ crystallizes into the same orthorhombic \textit{Pbnm}
structure, the configurational entropy should not be critical for the success
synthesis of (\textit{R}$_1$,...,\textit{R}$_n$)VO$_3$. The spin and orbital
ordering was studied by measuring magnetic properties and specific heat of
single crystals. Rather than the number and type of rare earth ions, the
average ionic radius and size variance are the key factors determining the spin
and orbital order in (\textit{R}$_1$,...,\textit{R}$_n$)VO$_3$. When the size
variance is small, the average ionic radius takes precedence in dictating spin
and orbital order. Increasing size variance suppresses the G-type orbital order
and C-type magnetic order but favors the C-OO/G-AF state and the spin-orbital
entanglement. These findings suggest that the extreme disorder introduced by
mixing multiple rare earth ions in high entropy perovskites might be employed
to preserve the orbital degree of freedom to near the magnetic ordering
temperature, which is necessary for the electronic driven orbital ordering in a
Kugel-Khomskii compound.

<p>We report the experimental observation of large spin pumping signals in
YIG/Pt system driven by broad-wavevector spin-wave spin current. 280 nm-wide
microwave inductive antennas offer broad-wavevector excitation which, in
combination with quasi-flatband of YIG, allows a large number of magnons to
participate in spin pumping at a given frequency. Through comparison with
ferromagnetic resonance spin pumping, we attribute the enhancement of the spin
current to the multichromatic magnons. The high efficiency of spin current
generation enables us to uncover nontrivial propagating properties in ultra-low
power regions. Additionally, our study achieves the spatially separated
detection of magnons, allowing the direct extraction of the decay length. The
synergistic combination of the capability of broad-wavevector excitation,
enhanced voltage signals, and nonlocal detection provides a new avenue for the
electrical exploration of spin waves dynamics.

<p>In the last few years there is an unprecedented progress in the increase of
the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells. Evidently, further
advances of the efficiency of these devices will depend on the constraints
imposed by the optical and electronic properties of their constituents. Quite
apparently that during the manufacturing process of a solar cell, there is an
inevitable variation in the thicknesses of various functional layers, which
affects the optoelectronic characteristics of the final sample. In this work a
possible strategy of the analysis of the solar cell performance is suggested,
based on statistically averaging procedure of experimental data. We present a
case study, in which the optoelectronic properties of the meso-structured
perovskite solar cell (with a mesoporous TiO$_2$ layer) are analysed within the
method providing a deeper understanding of the device operation. This method
enables an assessment of the overall quality of the device, pointing pathways

<i>Virgile Thiévenaz, Nathan Vani, Alban Sauret</i>
<p>We investigate the link between the geometric environment of particles, the
local deformations of the solvent, and the bulk effective viscosity in
non-Brownian suspensions. First, we discuss the caging of particles by their
neighbors,and especially the caging of small particles by large ones in
bidisperse suspensions.We develop a model that attributes an effective volume
to particles depending on their environment, and yields the local deformations
and effective viscosity. We compare this model to data from the literature, as
well as to our own experiments with suspensions of non-Brownian polystyrene
beads. Using dissolved polymers and their coil-stretch transition as strain
probes, we measure the local deformation of the liquid and the effect of caging
thereon. We obtain a linear relationship between the amplified local strain
rate and the particle volume fraction, in which the critical volume fraction
$\phi_\mathrm{c}$ appears as an effective volume of the particles; this
relationship is found valid up into the dense regime.

<p>We determine the local charge dynamics of a $z-z$ electrolyte embedded in a

separation between the axial and transverse direction of the channel, we derive
closed formulas for the local excess charge for both, dielectric and conducting
walls, in $2D$ (planar geometry) as well as in $3D$ (cylindrical geometry). Our
results show that, even at equilibrium, the local charge electroneutrality is
broken whenever the section of the channel is not homogeneous for both
dielectric and conducting walls as well as for $2D$ and $3D$ channels.
Interestingly, even within our expansion, the local excess charge in the fluid
can be comparable to the net charge on the walls. We critically discuss the
onset of such local electroneutrality breakdown in particular with respect to
the correction that it induces on the effective free energy profile experienced
by tracer ions.

<i>Siamak Mirfendereski, Jae Sung Park</i>
<p>The rheological behaviour of dense suspensions of ideally conductive
particles in the presence of both electric field and shear flow is studied
using large-scale numerical simulations. Under the action of an electric field,
these particles are known to undergo dipolophoresis, which is the combination
of two nonlinear electrokinetic phenomena -- induced-charge electrophoresis and
dielectrophoresis. For ideally conductive particles, induced-charge
electrophoresis is predominant over dielectrophoresis, resulting in transient
pairing dynamics. The shear viscosity and first and second normal stress
differences $N_1$ and $N_2$ of such suspensions are examined over a range of
volume fractions $15\% \leqslant \phi \leqslant 50\%$ as a function of Mason
number $Mn$, which measures the relative importance of viscous shear stress
over electrokinetic-driven stress. For $Mn < 1$ or low shear rates, the
dipolophoresis is shown to dominate the dynamics, resulting in a relatively
low-viscosity state. The positive $N_1$ and negative $N_2$ are observed at
$\phi < 30\%$, which is similar to Brownian suspensions, while their signs are
reversed at $\phi \ge 30\%$. For $Mn \ge 1$, the shear thickening starts to
arise at $\phi \ge 30\%$, and an almost five-fold increase in viscosity occurs
at $\phi = 50\%$. Both $N_1$ and $N_2$ are negative for $Mn \gg 1$ at all
volume fractions considered. We illuminate the transition in rheological
behaviours from dipolophoresis to shear dominance around $Mn = 1$ in connection
to suspension microstructure and dynamics. Lastly, our findings reveal the
potential use of nonlinear electrokinetics as a means of active rheology
control for such suspensions.

<h3>Frustrated magnets in the limit of infinite dimensions: dynamics and  disorder-free glass transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09124" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09124</a>

<i>Achille Mauri, Mikhail I. Katsnelson</i>
<p>We study the statistical mechanics and the equilibrium dynamics of a system
of classical Heisenberg spins with frustrated interactions on a $d$-dimensional
simple hypercubic lattice, in the limit of infinite dimensionality $d \to
\infty$. In the analysis we consider a class of models in which the matrix of
exchange constants is a linear combination of powers of the adjacency matrix.
This choice leads to a special property: the Fourier transform of the exchange
coupling $J(\mathbf{k})$ presents a $(d-1)$-dimensional surface of degenerate
maxima in momentum space. Using the cavity method, we find that the statistical
mechanics of the system presents for $d \to \infty$ a paramagnetic solution
which remains locally stable at all temperatures down to $T = 0$. To
investigate whether the system undergoes a glass transition we study its
dynamical properties assuming a purely dissipative Langevin equation, and
mapping the system to an effective single-spin problem subject to a colored
Gaussian noise. The conditions under which a glass transition occurs are
discussed including the possibility of a local anisotropy and a simple type of
anisotropic exchange. The general results are applied explicitly to a simple
model, equivalent to the isotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the
$d$-dimensional fcc lattice with first and second nearest-neighbour
interactions tuned to the point $J_{1} = 2J_{2}$. In this model, we find a
dynamical glass transition at a temperature $T_{\rm g}$ separating a
high-temperature liquid phase and a low temperature vitrified phase. At the
dynamical transition, the Edwards-Anderson order parameter presents a jump
demonstrating a first-order phase transition.

<h3>Transient nucleation driven by solvent evaporation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09126" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09126</a>
<br>
<i>R. de Bruijn, J.J. Michels, P. van der Schoot</i>
<p>We theoretically investigate homogeneous crystal nucleation in a solution
containing a solute and a volatile solvent. The solvent evaporates from the
solution, thereby continuously increasing the concentration of the solute. We
view it as an idealized model for the far-out-of-equilibrium conditions present
during the liquid-state manufacturing of organic electronic devices. Our model
is based on classical nucleation theory, taking the solvent to be a source of
the transient conditions in which the solute drops out of solution. Other than
that, the solvent is not directly involved in the nucleation process itself. We
approximately solve the kinetic master equations using a combination of Laplace
transforms and singular perturbation theory, providing an analytical expression
for the nucleation flux, predicting that (i) the nucleation flux lags slightly
behind a commonly used quasi-steady-state approximation, an effect that is
governed by two counteracting effects originating from the solvent evaporation:
while a faster evaporation rate results in an increasingly larger influence of
the lag time on the nucleation flux, this lag time itself we find to decrease
with increasing evaporation rate, (ii) the nucleation flux and the
quasi-steady-state nucleation flux are never identical, except trivially in the
stationary limit and (iii) the initial induction period of the nucleation flux,
which we characterize with a generalized induction time, decreases weakly with
the evaporation rate. This indicates that the relevant time scale for
nucleation also decreases with increasing evaporation rate. Our analytical
theory compares favorably with results from numerical evaluation of the
governing kinetic equations.

<h3>Scale-free chaos in the 2D harmonically confined Vicsek model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09135" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09135</a>
<br>
<i>R. González-Albaladejo, L. L. Bonilla</i>
<p>Animal motion and flocking are ubiquitous nonequilibrium phenomena that are
often studied within active matter. In examples such as insect swarms,
macroscopic quantities exhibit power laws with measurable critical exponents
and ideas from phase transitions and statistical mechanics have been explored
to explain them. The widely used Vicsek model with periodic boundary conditions
has an ordering phase transition but the corresponding homogeneous ordered or
disordered phases are different from observations of natural swarms. If a
harmonic potential (instead of a periodic box) is used to confine particles,
the numerical simulations of the Vicsek model display periodic, quasiperiodic
and chaotic attractors. The latter are scale free on critical curves that
produce power laws and critical exponents. Here we investigate the
scale-free-chaos phase transition in two space dimensions. We show that the
shape of the chaotic swarm on the critical curve reflects the split between
core and vapor of insects observed in midge swarms and that the dynamic
correlation function collapses only for a finite interval of small scaled
times, as also observed. We explain the algorithms used to calculate the
largest Lyapunov exponents, the static and dynamic critical exponents and
compare them to those of the three-dimensional model.

<h3>An Open-Source 3D FE Quench Simulation Tool for No-Insulation HTS  Pancake Coils</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09177" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09177</a>

<i>Sina Atalay, Erik Schnaubelt, Mariusz Wozniak, Julien Dular, Georgia Zachou, Sebastian Schöps, Arjan Verweij</i>
<p>A new module, Pancake3D, of the open-source Finite Element Quench Simulator
(FiQuS) has been developed in order to perform transient simulations of
no-insulation (NI) high-temperature superconducting (HTS) pancake coils in
3-dimensions. FiQuS/Pancake3D can perform magnetodynamic or coupled
magneto-thermal simulations. Thanks to the use of thin shell approximations, an
$\vec{H}-\phi$ formulation, and anisotropic homogenization techniques, each
turn can be resolved on the mesh level in an efficient and robust manner.
FiQuS/Pancake3D relies on pre-formulated finite-element (FE) formulations and
numerical approaches that are programmatically adjusted based on a text input
file. In this paper, the functionalities and capabilities of FiQuS/Pancake3D
are presented. The challenges of FE simulation of NI coils and how
FiQuS/Pancake3D addresses them are explained. To highlight the functionalities,
the results of a magneto-thermal analysis of a double pancake coil with 40
turns per pancake with local degradation of the critical current density are
conducted and discussed. Furthermore, a parameter sweep of the size of this
local degradation is presented. All the FiQuS input files for reproducing the
simulations are provided.

<h3>Structure responsible for the superconducting state in La3Ni2O7 at low  temperature and high pressure conditions</h3>

<p>Very recently, a new superconductor with Tc = 80 K was reported in nickelate
(La3Ni2O7) at around 15 - 40 GPa conditions (Nature, 621, 493, 2023) [1], which
is the second type of unconventional superconductor, beside the cuprates, with
Tc above liquid nitrogen temperature. However, the phase diagram plotted in
this report mostly based on the transport measurement at low temperature and
high pressure conditions, and the assumed corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD)
results was carried out at room temperature. This encouraged us to carry out in
situ low temperature and high pressure synchrotron XRD experiments to determine
which phase is responsible for the high Tc state. In addition to the phase
transition from orthorhombic Amam structure to orthorhombic Fmmm structure, a
tetragonal phase with space group of I4/mmm was discovered at 40 K when
compressed to 19 GPa at which the superconductivity takes palce in La3Ni2O7.
This work sheds new lights to identify what is the most likely phase
responsible for superconductivity in the double layered nickelate.
