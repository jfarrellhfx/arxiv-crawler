<h3>Obstructed Atomic Insulators and Superfluids of Fermions Coupled to  $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Gauge Fields</h3>

We study spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ fermions coupled to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge fields
on a lattice. We show how a spatial modulation of the fermion hopping allows
for the realization of various obstructed atomic insulators that host
higher-order band topology. Studying the effect of quantum dynamics of the
gauge fields within a simplified model, we find a rich phase diagram of this
system with a number of superfluid phases arising from the attractive
interactions meditated by the gauge fields. A key finding of this work is that
the evolution from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid state to a
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of tightly bound pairs occurs via the
realization of these different superfluid phases separated by first-order
transitions.

Controlling the motion of active matter is a central issue that has recently
received significant attention, from non-equilibrium physics to chemical
engineering and biology. Distinct methods of controlling active matter have
been developed, and physical confinement to limited space and active matter
with broken rotational symmetry (chirality) are two prominent control
mechanisms. However, the interplay of pattern formation by physical constraints
and the ordering by chiral motion needs to be better understood. In this study,
we conduct numerical simulations of chiral self-propelled particles under
circular boundary confinement. The collective motion of confined self-propelled
particles can go to drastically different states depending on their chirality.
The balance of orientation changes between particle interaction and the
boundary wall is essential for generating ordered collective emotion. Our
results clarify the role of the steric boundary effect in controlling chiral
active matter.

<h3>Pseudogap effects in the strongly correlated regime of the  two-dimensional Fermi gas</h3>

The two-species Fermi gas with attractive short-range interactions in two
spatial dimensions provides a paradigmatic system for the understanding of
strongly correlated Fermi superfluids in two dimensions. It is known to exhibit
a BEC-BCS crossover as a function of $\ln(k_F a)$, where $a$ is the scattering
length, and to undergo a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless superfluid transition
below a critical temperature $T_c$. However, the extent of a pseudogap regime
in the strongly correlated regime of $\ln(k_F a)\sim 1$, in which pairing
correlations persist above $T_c$, remains largely unexplored with controlled
theoretical methods. Here we use finite-temperature auxiliary-field quantum
Monte Carlo (AFMC) methods on discrete lattices in the canonical ensemble
formalism to calculate thermodynamical observables in the strongly correlated
regime. We extrapolate to continuous time and the continuum limit to eliminate
systematic errors and present results for particle numbers ranging from $N=42$
to $N=162$. We estimate $T_c$ by a finite-size scaling analysis, and observe
clear pseudogap signatures above $T_c$ and below a temperature $T^*$ in both
the spin susceptibility and free-energy gap. We also present results for the
contact, a fundamental thermodynamic property of quantum many-body systems with
short-range interactions.

<h3>Frustrated Ferromagnetism of Honeycomb Cobaltates: Incommensurate  Spirals, Quantum Disordered Phases, and Out-of-Plane Ising Order</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14053" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14053</a>

Recent experiments on the Co-based $d^7$ honeycomb materials
BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ and BaCo$_2$(PO$_4$)$_2$ have drawn renewed interest to
XXZ models with competing interactions beyond the nearest neighbor exchange.
While the case of dominant antiferromagnetic exchange has been extensively
studied, the actual materials exhibit a ferromagnetic nearest neighbor
exchange. Here we show that such a sign change of the dominant nearest neighbor
coupling has substantial consequences on the phase diagram. In particular, the
nature of the quantum disordered phase of interest changes from a plaquette
valence bond crystal to a long-range entangled spin liquid phase. By means of
complementary numerical simulations, based on exact diagonalization and the
pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group, we demonstrate the formation
of a gapless spin liquid state at the heart of the ferromagnetic phase diagram
in the isotropic Heisenberg limit, which gives way to out-of-plane Ising
magnetic order upon inclusion of XXZ anisotropy. The magnetically ordered
phases surrounding this quantum disordered region are much less sensitive to
the sign change of the dominant interaction and can be understood from their
classical analogs. We briefly comment on the relevance of our results for
Co-based $d^7$ honeycomb materials.

<h3>Quantized valley Hall response from local bulk density variations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14054" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14054</a>
<br>
<i>Maxime Jamotte, Lucila Peralta Gavensky, Cristiane Morais Smith, Marco Di Liberto, Nathan Goldman</i>
<br>
<br>
The application of a mechanical strain to a 2D material can create
pseudo-magnetic fields and lead to a quantized valley Hall effect. While
transport measurements can be performed to detect this phenomenon, the
resulting signatures are typically fragile and highly dependent on the sample's
edge termination. Here, we introduce an alternative way of detecting the
quantized valley Hall effect, which entirely relies on local density
measurements, performed deep in the bulk of the sample. The resulting quantized
bulk response is independent of the edge physics, and reflects the underlying
valley Hall effect through the Widom-St\v{r}eda formula. Specifically, our
approach is based on measuring the variation of the particle density, locally
in the bulk, upon varying the strength of the applied strain. This approach to
the quantized valley Hall effect is particularly well suited for experiments
based on synthetic lattices, where the particle density (or integrated density
of states) can be spatially resolved.

<h3>Thermal resonance in harmonically driven segmented Frenkel-Kontorova  lattices with next-nearest-neighbor interactions</h3>

Problems of heat transport are ubiquitous to various technologies such as
power generation, cooling, electronics, and thermoelectrics. Within this
context it is natural that external heat flux control on nanoscale devices
became an appealing strategy that has been explored in recent years. In this
work we study the thermal resonance phenomenon, i.e., the maximum heat flux
obtained by means of an external periodic driving, of a one-dimensional system
composed of two dissimilar Frenkel-Kontorva lattices with both nearest-neighbor
(NN) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interactions connected by time-modulated
NN and NNN couplings in contact with two heat reservoirs operating at different
temperature. We study the effect of the NNN interactions on the various heat
transport regimes afforded by the structural modifications that can be made on
the model. The dependence of the thermal resonance on the system size is
studied as well. Our results show that, despite the increased connectivity of
both sides afforded by the NNN interactions, the overlap of the phonon bands of
both parts of the system still determines the frequency range wherewith thermal
resonance emerges.

<h3>Low-temperature magnetoresistance hysteresis in Vanadium-doped  Bi$_{2}$Te$_{2.4}$Se$_{0.6}$ bulk topological insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14078" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14078</a>
<br>
<i>Birkan Düzel, Christian Riha, Karl Graser, Olivio Chiatti, Saskia F. Fischer</i>
<br>
<br>
Bi$_{2}$Te$_{2.4}$Se$_{0.6}$ single crystals show gapless topological surface
states and doping with Vanadium allows to shift the chemical potential in the
bulk band gap. Accordingly, the resistivity, carrier density, and mobility are
constant below 10 K and the magnetoresistance shows weak antilocalization as
expected for low-temperature transport properties dominated by gapless surface
states of so-called three-dimensional topological "insulators". However, the
magnetoresistance also shows a hysteresis depending on the sweep rate and the
magnetic field direction. Here, we provide evidence for
Bi$_{2-x}$Te$_{2.4}$Se$_{0.6}$ single crystals with concentrations $x$ = 0,
0.015 and 0.03 of Vanadium, that such magnetoresistance hysteresis is enhanced
if both, three-dimensional bulk states and quasi-two-dimensional topological
states contribute to the transport ($x$ = 0 and 0.03), and it is mostly
suppressed if the topological states govern transport ($x$ = 0.015). The
results are discussed in terms of spin-dependent scattering between the
different available states.

<h3>Machine learning reveals memory of the parent phases in ferroelectric  relaxors Ba(Ti$_{1-x}$,Zr$_x$)O$_3$</h3>

Machine learning has been establishing its potential in multiple areas of
condensed matter physics and materials science. Here we develop and use an
unsupervised machine learning workflow within a framework of
first-principles-based atomistic simulations to investigate phases, phase
transitions, and their structural origins in ferroelectric relaxors,
Ba(Ti$_{1-x}$,Zr$_x$)O$_3$. We first demonstrate the applicability of the
workflow to identify phases and phase transitions in the parent compound, a
prototypical ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$. We then apply the workflow on
Ba(Ti$_{1-x}$,Zr$_x$)O$_3$, with $x\leq0.25$ to reveal (i) that some of the
compounds bear a subtle memory of BaTiO$_3$, phases beyond the point of the
pinched phase transition, which could contribute to their enhanced
electromechanical response; (ii) the existence of peculiar phases with
delocalized precursors of nanodomains -- likely candidates for the
controversial polar nanoregions; and (iii) nanodomain phases for the largest
concentrations of $x$

<h3>An Atomistic Model of Field-Induced Resistive Switching in Valence  Change Memory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14090" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14090</a>
<br>
<i>Manasa Kaniselvan, Mathieu Luisier, Marko Mladenović</i>
<br>
<br>
In Valence Change Memory (VCM) cells, the conductance of an insulating
switching layer is reversibly modulated by creating and redistributing point
defects under an external field. Accurate simulations of the switching dynamics
of these devices can be difficult due to their typically disordered atomic
structures and inhomogeneous arrangements of defects. To address this, we
introduce an atomistic framework for modelling VCM cells. It combines a
stochastic Kinetic Monte Carlo approach for atomic rearrangement with a quantum
transport scheme, both parameterized at the ab-initio level by using inputs
from Density Functional Theory (DFT). Each of these steps operates directly on
the underlying atomic structure. The model thus directly relates the energy
landscape and electronic structure of the device to its switching
characteristics. We apply this model to simulate non-volatile switching between
high- and low-resistance states in an TiN/HfO2/Ti/TiN stack, and analyze both
the kinetics and stochasticity of the conductance transitions. We also resolve
the atomic nature of current flow resulting from the valence change mechanism,
finding that conductive paths are formed between the undercoordinated Hf atoms
neighboring oxygen vacancies. The model developed here can be applied to
different material systems to evaluate their resistive switching potential,
both for use as conventional memory cells and as neuromorphic computing
primitives.

<h3>Every-other-layer Dipolar Excitons in a Spin-Valley locked Superlattice</h3>

<br>
<br>
Monolayer semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides possess broken
inversion symmetry and strong spin-orbit coupling, which leads to unique
spin-valley locking effect. In 2H stacked pristine multilayers, the spin-valley
locking yields an electronic superlattice structure, where alternating layers
correspond to barrier and quantum well respectively, conditioned on the
spin-valley indices. Here, we show that the spin-valley locked superlattice
hosts a new kind of dipolar excitons with the electron and hole constituents
separated in an every-other-layer configuration, i.e., either in two even or
two odd layers. Such excitons become optically bright via hybridization with
intralayer excitons, displaying multiple anti-crossing patterns in optical
reflection spectrum as the dipolar exciton is tuned through the intralayer
resonance by electric field. The reflectance spectra also reveal an excited
state orbital of the every-other-layer exciton, pointing to a sizable binding
energy in the same order of magnitude as the intralayer exciton. As layer
thickness increases, the dipolar exciton can form one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard
chain displaying a layer number dependent fine-structures in the reflectance
spectra. Our work reveals a distinct valleytronic superlattice with highly
tunable dipolar excitons for exploring light-matter interactions.

<h3>Dynamics of flexible fibers in Couette flows at finite Reynolds numbers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14153" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14153</a>
<br>
<i>Jian Su, Kun Ma, Zhongyu Yan, Qiaolin He, Xinpeng Xu</i>
<br>
<br>
We carry out a numerical study on the dynamics of a single non-Brownian
flexible fiber in two-dimensional Couette flows at finite Reynolds numbers. We
employ the bead-spring model of flexible fibers to extend the fluid particle
dynamics (FPD) method that is originally developed for rigid particles in
viscous liquids. We implement the extended FPD method using a
multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) scheme of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM).
The numerical scheme is validated firstly by a series of benchmark simulations
that involve liquid-solid coupling. The method is then used to study the
dynamics of flexible fibers in Couette flows. We only consider the highly
symmetric case where the fibers are placed on the symmetry center of Couette
flows and we focus on the effects of the fiber stiffness, the confinement
strength, and the finite Reynolds number (from 1 to 10). A diagram of the fiber
shape is obtained. For fibers under weak confinement and a small Reynolds
number, three distinct tumbling orbits have been identified. (1) Jeffery orbits
of rigid fibers. The fibers behave like rigid rods and tumble periodically
without any visible deformation. (2) S-turn orbits of slightly flexible fibers.
The fiber is bent to an S-shape and is straightened again when it is aligned
parallel to the walls. (3) S-coiled orbits of fairly flexible fibers. The fiber
is folded to an S-shape and tumbles periodically and steadily without being
straightened anymore during its rotation. Moreover, the fiber tumbling is found
to be hindered by increasing either the Reynolds number or the confinement
strength, or both.

<h3>Magnetic oxides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14176" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14176</a>
<br>

In this article we give a general survey of the main properties of magnetic
oxides - mostly the oxides of transition metals, but sometime also containing
rare earths ions. This is a very rich class of materials, among which there are
insulators and metals, systems with insulator-metal transitions, and there are
among them even high-temperature superconductors. One of the main features of
these compounds, which attract to them special attention and which serve as a
basis of many applications, are their rich magnetic properties. In this article
we discuss the main physical effects determining their behaviour, and describe
in detail especially their magnetic properties, but not only. After shortly
discussing the basic structure of isolated magnetic ions, we concentrate on the
collective effects depending on the interaction between sites, especially
exchange interaction, giving rise to different magnetic properties: different
types of magnetic ordering in conventional systems, but also more exotic states
such as spin liquid states in frustrated systems. We also cover related
phenomena in magnetic oxides, such as magnetoelectric and multiferroic
behaviour, and discuss at the end their diverse useful properties serving as a
basis of many applications.

<h3>Superconductivity of MgB$_3$C$_3$: A root from critical reduction Mg  atoms in MgB$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14184" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14184</a>
<br>
<i>Truong-Tho Pham, Duc-Long Nguyen</i>
<br>
<br>
From first-principles density functional theory calculations, we propose
hexagonal layered MgB$_3$C$_3$ as a potential phonon-mediated superconductor at
59 K, which is far higher than the superconductivity of MgB$_2$ ($\approx$ 39
K). The MgB$_3$C$_3$ is energetically and dynamic stability at ambient pressure
in the \textit{P-62m} hexagonal structure with c/a $\approx$ 0.79 and forms in
stacks of honeycomb B-C layers with Mg as a space filler. Band structure
calculations indicate that the bands at the Fermi level derive mainly from B
and C orbitals in which two $\sigma$- and two $\pi$-bonding bands both
contribute to the total density of state. The $\pi$ bonding bands are found to
be strongly couple with out-of-plane acoustic phonon mode, while the $\sigma$
bonding bands coupled with the in-plane bond-stretching optical E$^{\prime} $
phonon modes produces a sizable superconductivity in MgB$_3$C$_3$.

<h3>Density-and-phase domain walls in a condensate with dynamical gauge  potentials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14195" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14195</a>
<br>
<i>Sayak Bhattacharjee, Roderich Moessner, Shovan Dutta</i>
<br>
<br>
We show how one can generate domain walls that separate high- and low-density
regions with opposite momenta in the ground state of a harmonically trapped
Bose-Einstein condensate using a density-dependent gauge potential. Within a
Gross-Pitaevskii framework, we elucidate the distinct roles of vector and
scalar potentials and how they lead to synthetic electromagnetic fields that
are localized at the domain wall. In particular, the kinetic energy cost of a
steep density gradient is compensated by an electrostatic field that pushes
particles away from a special value of density. We show numerically in one
dimension that such a domain wall is more prominent for repulsive contact
interactions, and becomes metastable at strong electric fields through a
first-order phase transition that ends at a critical point as the field is
reduced. Our findings build on recent experimental developments and may be
realized with cold atoms in a shaken optical lattice, providing insights into
collective phenomena arising from dynamical gauge fields.

<h3>Ultrafast switching dynamics of the ferroelectric order in  stacking-engineered ferroelectrics</h3>

<br>
<br>
The recently discovered ferroelectricity of van der Waals bilayers offers an
unconventional route to improve the performance of devices. Key parameters such
as switching field and speed depend on the static and dynamic properties of
domain walls (DWs). Here we theoretically explore the properties of textures in
stacking-engineered ferroelectrics from first principles. Employing a
machine-learning potential model, we present results of large-scale atomistic
simulations of stacking DWs and Moir\'e structure of boron nitride bilayers. We
predict that the competition between the switching barrier of stable
ferroelectric states and the in-plane lattice distortion leads to a DW width of
the order of ten nanometers. DWs motion reduces the critical ferroelectric
switching field of a monodomain by two orders of magnitude, while high
domain-wall velocities allow domain switching on a picosecond-timescale. The
superior performance compared to conventional ferroelectrics (or ferromagnets)
may enable ultrafast and power-saving non-volatile memories. By twisting the
bilayer into a stacking Moir\'e structure, the ferroelectric transforms into a
super-paraelectric since DWs move under ultralow electric fields.

<h3>Enhanced coercivity and emergence of spin cluster glass state in 2D  ferromagnetic material Fe3GeTe2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14221" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14221</a>

<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials with high
coercivity and high $T_\text{C}$ are desired for spintronics and memory storage
applications. Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ (F3GT) is one such 2D vdW ferromagnet with a
reasonably high $T_\text{C}$, but with a very low coercive field, $H_\text{c}$
($\lesssim$100~Oe). Some of the common techniques of enhancing $H_\text{c}$ are
by introducing pinning centers, defects, stress, doping, etc. They involve the
risk of undesirable alteration of other important magnetic properties. Here we
propose a very easy, robust, and highly effective method of phase engineering
by altering the sample growth conditions to greatly enhance the intrinsic
coercivity (7-10 times) of the sample, without compromising its fundamental
magnetic properties ($T_\text{C}\simeq$210K). The phase-engineered sample
(F3GT-2) comprises of parent F3GT phase with a small percentage of randomly
embedded clusters of a coplanar FeTe (FT) phase. The FT phase serves as both
mosaic pinning centers between grains of F3GT above its antiferromagnetic
transition temperature ($T_\text{C1}\sim$70~K) and also as anti-phase domains
below $T_\text{C1}$. As a result, the grain boundary disorder and metastable
nature are greatly augmented, leading to highly enhanced coercivity, cluster
spin glass, and meta-magnetic behavior. The enhanced coercivity ($\simeq$1~kOe)
makes F3GT-2 much more useful for memory storage applications and is likely to
elucidate a new route to tune useful magnetic properties. Moreover, this method
is much more convenient than hetero-structure and other cumbersome techniques.

<h3>Global quantum phase diagram and non-Abelian chiral spin liquid in a  spin-3/2 square lattice antiferromagnet</h3>

Since strong quantum fluctuations are essential for the emergence of quantum
spin liquids, there have been extensive exploration and identification of spin
liquid candidates in spin-$1/2$ systems, while such activities are rare in
higher spin systems. Here we report an example of non-Abelian chiral spin
liquid emerging in spin-$3/2$ Heisenberg model on a square lattice. By tuning
Heisenberg exchange interaction and scalar chirality interaction, we map out a
quantum phase diagram enclosing three conventional magnetic orders and a chiral
spin liquid based on density matrix renormalization group studies. The nature
of the spin liquid is identified as a long-sought bosonic version of
Read-Rezayi state that supports non-Abelian Fibonacci anyonic statistics,
identified by the ground state entanglement spectrum. Significantly, we
establish that the non-Abelian CSL emerges through the enlarged local degrees
of freedom and enhanced quantum fluctuations near the classical phase
boundaries of competing magnetic orders. Our numerical discovery of an exotic
quantum spin liquid in spin-$3/2$ system suggests a new route for discovering
fractionalized quantum phases in frustrated higher spin magnetic compounds.

<br>
<br>
We report a systematic study of the dynamics of self-propelled particles
(SPPs) over a one-dimensional periodic potential landscape, which is fabricated
on a microgroove-patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. From the
measured non-equilibrium probability density function of the SPPs, we find that
the escape dynamics of the slow-rotating SPPs across the potential landscape
can be described by an effective potential, once the self-propulsion force is
included into the potential under the fixed angle approximation. This work
demonstrates that the parallel microgrooves provide a versatile platform for a
quantitative understanding of the interplay among the self-propulsion force,
spatial confinement by the potential landscape, and thermal noise, as well as
its effects on activity-assisted escape dynamics and transport of the SPPs.

<h3>Rational design of large anomalous Nernst effect in Dirac semimetals</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Anomalous Nernst effect generates a transverse voltage perpendicular to the
temperature gradient. It has several advantages compared with the longitudinal
thermoelectricity for energy conversion, such as decoupling of electronic and
thermal transports, higher flexibility, and simpler lateral structure. However,
a design principle beyond specific materials systems for obtaining a large
anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) is still absent. In this work, we
theoretically demonstrate that a pair of Dirac nodes under a Zeeman field
manifests a double-peak anomalous Hall conductivity curve with respect to the
chemical potential and a compensated carriers feature, leading to an enhanced
ANC pinning at the Fermi level compared with that of a simple Weyl semimetal
with two Weyl nodes. Based on first-principles calculations, we then provide
two Dirac semimetal candidates, i.e., Na3Bi and NaTeAu, and show that under a
Zeeman field they exhibit a sizable ANC value of 0.4 A/(m*K) and 1.3 A/(m*K),
respectively, near the Fermi level. Our work provides a design principle with a
prototype band structure for enhanced ANC pinning at Fermi level, shedding
light on the inverse design of other specific functional materials base on
electronic structure.

Interface-specific hydrogen- (H-)bonding network of water next to a substrate
(including air) directly controls the energy transfer and chemical reaction
pathway at many charged aqueous interfaces. Yet, experimental characterization
of such bonded water layer structure is still a challenge due to the presence
of the ion diffuse layer. We now develop a sum-frequency (SF) spectroscopic
scheme with varying photon momentums as an all-optic solution for retrieving
the vibrational spectra of the bonded water layer and the diffuse layer, and
hence microscopic structural and charging information about an interface.
Application of the method to a charged surfactant-water interface reveals a
hidden weakly-donor-H-bonded water species, suggesting an asymmetric
hydration-shell structure of fully solvated surfactant headgroups. In another
application to a zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid monolayer-water
interface, we find a highly polarized bonded water layer structure associating
to the PC headgroup, while the diffuse layer contribution is experimentally
proven to be negligible. Our all-optic method offers not only an in situ
microscopic probe of the electrochemical and biological interfaces, but also a
new opportunity for promoting these researches toward high spatial and temporal
resolutions.

We performed inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments to measure spin
dynamics on a polycrystalline sample of a spin tube candidate CsCrF$_{4}$. The
compound exhibits a successive phase transition from a paramagnetic phase
through an intermediate temperature (IT) phase of a 120$^{\circ}$ structure to
a low temperature (LT) phase of another 120$^{\circ}$ structure. Elaborate
comparison between observed and calculated neutron spectra in LT phase reveals
that the spin Hamiltonian is identified as antiferromagnetic spin tubes
including perturbative terms of intertube interaction, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction, and single ion anisotropy. A phase diagram for the ground state is
classically calculated. A set of parameters in the spin Hamiltonian obtained
from the INS spectra measured in LT phase is quite close to a boundary to the
phase of the 120$^{\circ}$ structure of IT phase. The INS spectra measured in
IT phase is, surprisingly, the same as those in LT phase in the level of powder
averaged spectra, even though the magnetic structures in IT and LT phases are
different. Identical dynamical structures compatible with two different static
structures are observed. No difference in the observed spectra indicates no
change of the spin Hamiltonian with the temperature, suggesting that the origin
of the successive phase transition being order-by-disorder mechanism.

<br>
Spin-orbit torque (SOT) provides an efficient way to achieve charge-to-spin
conversion and can switch perpendicular magnetization, which is essential for
designing novel energy-efficient spintronic devices. An out-of-plane SOT could
directly switch perpendicular magnetization. Encouragingly, field-free
perpendicular magnetization switching of a two-dimensional (2D) material
WTe2/ferromagnet (FM) bilayer has been reported recently, but the working
temperature (200 K) is below room temperature. Here, we report the field-free
perpendicular magnetization switching carried out at room temperature on a
WTe2/Pt/Co/Pt multilayer film. Controlled experiments confirm that the
field-free switching is caused by the in-plane antidamping SOT generated in the
Pt/Co/Pt multilayer and the out-of-plane generated in the a-axis WTe2 thin
film. This work offers a potential method for using spintronic devices made of
two-dimensional materials at room temperature.

<h3>Exact new mobility edges between critical and localized states</h3>

The disorder systems host three types of fundamental quantum states, known as
the extended, localized, and critical states, of which the critical states
remain being much less explored. Here we uncover a novel type of exactly
solvable mobility edges (MEs) separating localized states from robust critical
states, and propose experimental realization. Here the robustness refers to the
stability against both single-particle perturbation and interactions. The new
MEs are exactly solved from a one-dimensional model, where both hopping
coefficients and on-site potential are in a quasiperiodic mosaic manner. The
analytic results enable us to unambiguously obtain the critical states which
otherwise require arduous numerical verification including the careful finite
size scalings. We further investigate the proposed model in the presence of
perturbation and interactions, and show the robustness of the new MEs. The
robustness of critical zones is protected by zeros of hopping coefficients in
the thermodynamics limit. Finally, we propose a novel experimental scheme to
realize the exactly solvable model and the new MEs in Rydberg array. This work
may pave a way to precisely explore the critical states and new ME physics with
experimental feasibility.

We report the optical and structural properties of starch films formed on
drying droplets of starch solutions on a flat substrate. The starch films
formed after drying are circular in shape and have an azimuthally symmetric
"M-shaped" height profile along their diameter. These films are found to be
semi-crystalline in nature and transparent in visible light. Our experimental
results show that these films are optically uniaxial at their center but
biaxial away from the center. The variation of birefringence along the radial
direction is studied for the films formed after drying droplets with different
volumes and starch concentrations. The cryo-SEM studies on the drying droplets
and the films reveal the micro-structures and the possible origin of
birefringence of these films.

Strain-engineering is a powerful means to tune the polar, structural, and
electronic instabilities of incipient ferroelectrics. KTaO3 is near a polar
instability and shows anisotropic superconductivity in electron-doped samples.
Here, we demonstrate growth of high quality KTaO3 thin films by molecular-beam
epitaxy. Tantalum was provided by both a suboxide source emanating a TaO2 flux
from Ta2O5 contained in a conventional effusion cell as well as an
electron-beam-heated tantalum source. Excess potassium and a combination of
ozone and oxygen (10 \% O3 + 90 \% O2) were simultaneously supplied with the
TaO$_2$ (or tantalum) molecular beams to grow the KTaO$_3$ films. Laue fringes
suggest that the films are smooth with an abrupt film/substrate interface.
Cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy does not show any
extended defects and confirms that the films have an atomically abrupt
interface with the substrate. Atomic force microscopy reveals atomic steps at
the surface of the grown films. Reciprocal space mapping demonstrates that the
films, when sufficiently thin, are coherently strained to the SrTiO$_3$ (001)
and GdScO$_3$ (110) substrates.

The theory of localized spin-wave excitations in random-anisotropy magnets
has been developed. Starting with a pure Heisenberg ferromagnet, we study the
evolution of standing spin waves in a finite-size sample towards localized
modes on increasing the strength of random anisotropy. Profiles of the
localized modes and their phases are analyzed and visualized in a 2D sample.
Localization length is obtained by several methods and its dependence on random
anisotropy is computed. The connection between the localization of spin
excitations and the broadband nature of the absorption of microwave power by
random-anisotropy magnets is elucidated.

<h3>Reduced basis emulation of pairing in finite systems</h3>

In recent years, reduced basis methods (RBMs) have been adapted to the
many-body eigenvalue problem and they have been used, largely in nuclear
physics, as fast emulators able to bypass expensive direct computations while
still providing highly accurate results. This work is meant to show that the
RBM is an efficient and accurate emulator for the strong correlations induced
by the pairing interaction in a variety of finite systems like ultrasmall
superconducting grains, interacting topological superfluids and mesoscopic
hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices, all of which require an expensive,
beyond-mean-field, particle-number conserving description. These systems are
modelled by the number-conserving Richardson pairing Hamiltonian and its
appropriate generalizations. Their ground state is solved for exactly using the
Density Matrix Renormalization Group. The reduced basis is assembled
iteratively from a small number of exact ground state vectors, well-chosen from
across the relevant parameter space using a fast estimate of the emulation
error and a greedy local optimization algorithm. The reduced basis emulation is
found to accurately describe the weak-to-strong pairing cross-over in small
grains, the third-order topological phase transition of the interacting
Richardson-Kitaev chain, and the complex charge stability diagram of a hybrid
quantum dot - superconductor device. RBMs are thus confirmed to be cheap and
accurate emulators for the widely encountered superconducting phenomena.
Capable of providing orders of magnitude computational speed-up with respect to
approaches based only on traditional many-body solvers, they open new
possibilities in building and solving models of interacting many-body systems
and in better interfacing them with experimental design and data analysis.

In this letter, we propose a mechanism to control the magnetic properties of
topological quantum material (TQM) by using magnetoelectric coupling: this
mechanism uses a heterostructure of TQM with two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric
material, which can dynamically control the magnetic order by changing the
polarization of the ferroelectric material and induce possible topological
phase transitions. This concept is demonstrated using the example of the
bilayer MnBi2Te4 on ferroelectric In2Se3 or In2Te3, where the polarization
direction of the 2D ferroelectrics determines the interfacial band alignment
and consequently the direction of the charge transfer. This charge transfer, in
turn, enhances the stability of the ferromagnetic state of MnBi2Te4 and leads
to a possible topological phase transition between the quantum anomalous Hall
(QAH) effect and the zero plateau QAH. Our work provides a route to dynamically
alter the magnetic ordering of TQMs and could lead to the discovery of new
multifunctional topological heterostructures.

<h3>Probability transport on the Fock space of a disordered quantum spin  chain</h3>

Within the broad theme of understanding the dynamics of disordered quantum
many-body systems, one of the simplest questions one can ask is: given an
initial state, how does it evolve in time on the associated Fock-space graph,
in terms of the distribution of probabilities thereon? A detailed quantitative
description of the temporal evolution of out-of-equilibrium disordered quantum
states and probability transport on the Fock space, is our central aim here. We
investigate it in the context of a disordered quantum spin chain which hosts a
disorder-driven many-body localisation transition. Real-time
dynamics/probability transport is shown to exhibit a rich phenomenology, which
is markedly different between the ergodic and many-body localised phases. The
dynamics is for example found to be strongly inhomogeneous at intermediate
times in both phases, but while it gives way to homogeneity at long times in
the ergodic phase, the dynamics remain inhomogeneous and multifractal in nature
for arbitrarily long times in the localised phase. Similarly, we show that an
appropriately defined dynamical lengthscale on the Fock-space graph is directly
related to the local spin-autocorrelation, and as such sheds light on the
(anomalous) decay of the autocorrelation in the ergodic phase, and lack of it
in the localised phase.

Experiments identified Co3Sn2S2 as the first magnetic Weyl semimetal (MWSM).
Using first-principles calculation with a global optimization approach, we
explore the structural stabilities and topological electronic properties of
cobalt (Co-based shandite and alloys, Co3MM-X2 (M/M-=Ge, Sn, Pb, X=S, Se, Te),
and identify new stable structures with new Weyl phases. Using a tight-binding
model, for the first time, we reveal that the physical origin of the nodal
lines of a Co-based shandite structure is the interlayer coupling between Co
atoms in different Kagome layers, while the number of Weyl points and their
types are mainly governed by the interaction between Co and the metal atoms,
Sn, Ge, and Pb. The Co3SnPbS2 alloy exhibits two distinguished topological
phases, depending on the relative positions of the Sn and Pb atoms: a
three-dimensional quantum anomalous Hall metal, and a MWSM phase with anomalous
Hall conductivity (~1290) that is larger than that of Co2Sn2S2. Our work
reveals the physical mechanism of the origination of Weyl fermions in Co-based
shandite structures and proposes new topological quantum states with high
thermal stability.

The fundamental properties of an exciton are determined by the spin, valley,
energy, and spatial wavefunctions of the Coulomb bound electron and hole. In
van der Waals materials, these attributes can be widely engineered through
layer stacking configuration to create highly tunable interlayer excitons with
static out-of-plane electric dipoles, at the expense of the strength of the
oscillating in-plane dipole responsible for light-matter coupling. Here we show
that interlayer excitons in bi- and tri-layer 2H-MoSe$_2$ crystals exhibit
electric-field-driven coupling with the ground ($1s$) and excited states ($2s$)
of the intralayer A excitons. We demonstrate that the hybrid states of these
distinct exciton species provide strong oscillator strength, large permanent
dipoles (up to $0.73 \pm 0.01$ enm), high energy tunability (up to $\sim$ 200
meV), and full control of the spin and valley characteristics such that the
exciton g-factor can be manipulated over a large range (from -4 to +14).
Further, we observe the bi- and tri-layer excited state ($2s$) interlayer
excitons and their coupling with the intralayer excitons states ($1s$ and
$2s$). Our results, in good agreement with a coupled oscillator model with spin
(layer)-selectivity and beyond standard density functional theory calculations,
promote multilayer 2H-MoSe$_2$ as a highly tunable platform to explore
exciton-exciton interactions with strong light-matter interactions.

<h3>Correlated Mott insulators in a strong electric field: The effects of  phonon renormalization</h3>

We characterize the response of a Mott insulating system to a static electric
field in terms of its conducting and spectral properties. Dissipation is
included by a coupling to fermionic baths and to either optical or acoustic
phonons. This paper extends and completes the analysis made in a previous work
by the authors [arXiv:2207.01921]. In the present work phonons are included
diagrammatically within the Migdal approximation by also including
self-consistency from the electronic feedback. The nonequilibrium steady-state
is addressed by means of the dynamical mean-field theory based on the
nonequilibrium Green's function approach, while the so-called auxiliary master
equation approach is employed as impurity solver. With optical phonons the
self-consistency suppresses the steady-state current at the onset of the
metallic phase with respect to the nonself-consistent case. This is due to the
interaction of phonons with the hot electrons of the lattice which increases
their temperature, thus providing a less effective relaxation channel for the
current-induced Joule heat. In addition, in the case of optical phonons the
results are essentially independent of the temperature of the fermionic baths,
as the latter is sensibly smaller than their characteristic frequency. On the
other hand, with acoustic phonons the steady-state current is slightly
suppressed by the self-consistent treatment only at field strengths close to
half of the gap, away from the metallic phase, and especially at very small
phonon frequency. Also, in this case the results seem to slightly depend on the
temperature of the fermionic baths.

Using Monte Carlo simulations we study the two-dimensional Ising model on
triangular, square, and hexagonal lattices with various topologies. We focus on
the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility and of the specific heat near the
critical point of the planar bulk system. We find that scaling functions of
these quantities on the spherical surface (Euler characteristic K = 2) differ
from the scaling functions on the projective plane (K = 1) which, in turn,
differ from the scaling functions on the torus and on the Klein bottle (both K
= 0). This provides strong evidence that phase transitions of the Ising model
on two-dimensional surfaces depend on their topologies.

The Bose-Einstein condensation of excitons into a single quantum state is
known as exciton condensation. Exciton condensation, which potentially supports
the frictionless flow of energy, has recently been realized in graphene
bilayers and van der Waals heterostructures. Here we show that exciton
condensates can be predicted from a combination of reduced density matrix
theory and cumulant theory. We show that exciton condensation occurs if and
only if there exists a large eigenvalue in the cumulant part of the
particle-hole reduced density matrix. In the thermodynamic limit we show that
the large eigenvalue is bounded from above by the number of excitons. In
contrast to the eigenvalues of the particle-hole matrix, the large eigenvalue
of the cumulant matrix has the advantage of providing a size-extensive measure
of the extent of condensation. Here we apply this signature to predict exciton
condensation in both the Lipkin model and molecular stacks of benzene. The
computational signature has applications to the prediction of exciton
condensation in both molecules and materials.

The results of systematic experimental studies of quantum oscillations of
resistivity, Hall coefficient and capacitance in GaAs and In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As
quantum wells (QWs) with a simple electron spectrum and HgTe QWs with a
complicated non-parabolic spectrum and strong spin-orbit interaction are
reported. A striking result is the ratio of the amplitudes of the resistance
and Hall coefficient oscillations. In GaAs QW with a simple spectrum
characterized by negligibly small Zeeman and spin-orbit splitting, the ratio of
amplitudes is close to that predicted theoretically. In HgTe QWs, this ratio is
very different and behaves differently in QWs with normal and inverted electron
spectra. In HgTe WQs with a normal spectrum, it tends to a theoretical value
with an increase of the filling factor ($N$), while for HgTe QWs with an
inverted spectrum, it differs significantly from the theoretical one for all
available $N$. It is assumed that such a difference in the ratio of amplitudes
in GaAs and HgTe QWs is due not to the peculiarities of the energy spectrum of
HgTe, but to the peculiarities of electron scattering due to spin-orbit
interaction with the potential of the scatterers. This assumption is justified
by analysis of experimental results obtained for a heterostructure with a
In$_{0.2}$Ga$_{0.8}$As QW, which spectrum is very close to the GaAs QW
spectrum, but characterizes by much stronger spin-orbit splitting value. It has
been found that the positions of the resistance and capacitance oscillations,
the difference between the phases of the resistance and Hall coefficient
oscillations and its $N$ dependence are close to those observed in GaAs QW. At
the same time the ratio of the amplitude of the resistance oscillations to the
Hall coefficient oscillations and its $N$ dependence differs very strongly and
they are close to that observed in HgTe quantum wells.

We show that classical DNA unzipping transition which is equivalently
described by quantum mechanical localization-delocalization transition in the
ground state of non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson Hamiltonian is underpinned by
generalized parity ({\bf P})-time reversal ({\bf T}) symmetry breaking
transition. We also study the one-dimensional discretized version of
Hatano-Nelson model in the presence of the single impurity and quasiperiodic
potential on a finite-size lattice. Our results show that these models undergo
a phase transition from a {\bf PT} unbroken phase to a broken phase.
Interestingly, the generalized {\bf PT} phase transition points also coincide
with the localization-delocalization transition for both models.

<h3>Emergent maximal categorical symmetry in a gapless state</h3>

A gapless liquid state can have many different emergent symmetries, which can
be viewed as invariants or fingerprints of the gapless state. The emergent
symmetries can be anomaly-free (classified by groups or higher groups),
anomalous (classified by groups plus group cocycles), or even beyond group and
beyond anomalous. To understand all those emergent symmetries in an unified
way, it is better to put all the emergent symmetries of the state together, and
refer to the maximal emergent symmetry as maximal categorical symmetry. A
systematic understanding of those emergent symmetries is achieved after
realizing that categorical symmetry is nothing but (non-invertible)
gravitational anomaly, which is the same as topological order in one higher
dimension if the categorical symmetry is finite. The above description of
maximal categorical symmetry is just a vague idea. In this paper, we propose a
precise way to define the notion of maximal categorical symmetry. For example,
the 1+1D Ising critical point has a maximal categorical symmetry described by
the 2+1D doulbe-Ising topological order. Such a categorical symmetry is not
associated to any anomaly-free symmetry. The maximal categorical symmetry is a
very detailed characterization of the gapless state (much more than the
projective symmetry group introduced before for the same purpose). It may be
close to the full characterization of the local low energy properties of
gapless liquid state. Therefore, the study of maximal categorical symmetry may
be a key to gaining a systematic understanding or even a classification of
gapless liquid states, up to local low energy equivalence, where two gapless
states are local low energy equivalent if they differ by stacking a gapped
state.

The development of differentiable invariant descriptors for accurate
representations of atomic environments plays a central role in the success of
interatomic potentials for chemistry and materials science. We introduce a
method to generate fast proper orthogonal descriptors for the construction of
many-body interatomic potentials and discuss its relation to exising empirical
and machine learning interatomic potentials. A traditional way of implementing
the proper orthogonal descriptors has a computational complexity that scales
exponentially with the body order in terms of the number of neighbors. We
present an algorithm to compute the proper orthogonal descriptors with a
computational complexity that scales linearly with the number of neighbors
irrespective of the body order. We show that our method can enable a more
efficient implementation for a number of existing potentials and provide a
scalable systematic framework to construct new many-body potentials. The new
potentials are demonstrated on a data set of density functional theory
calculations for Tantalum and compared with other interatomic potentials.

The steelpan is a pitched percussion instrument that takes the form of a
concave bowl with several localized dimpled regions of varying curvature. Each
of these localized zones, called notes, can vibrate independently when struck,
and produces a sustained tone of a well-defined pitch. While the association of
the localized zones with individual notes has long been known and exploited,
the relationship between the shell geometry and the strength of the mode
confinement remains unclear. Here, we explore the spectral properties of the
steelpan modeled as a vibrating elastic shell. To characterize the resulting
eigenvalue problem, we generalize a recently developed theory of localization
landscapes for scalar elliptic operators to the vector-valued case, and predict
the location of confined eigenmodes by solving a Poisson problem. A finite
element discretization of the shell shows that the localization strength is
determined by the difference in curvature between the note and the surrounding
bowl. In addition to providing an explanation for how a steelpan operates as a
two-dimensional xylophone, our study provides a geometric principle for
designing localized modes in elastic shells.

Topological insulator (TI) nanoribbons with proximity-induced
superconductivity are a promising platform for Majorana bound states (MBSs). In
this work, we consider a detailed modeling approach for a TI nanoribbon in
contact with a superconductor via its top surface, which induces a
superconducting gap in its surface-state spectrum. The system displays a rich
phase diagram with different numbers of end-localized MBSs as a function of
chemical potential and magnetic flux piercing the cross section of the ribbon.
These MBSs can be robust or fragile upon consideration of electrostatic
disorder. We simulate a tunneling spectroscopy setup to probe the different
topological phases of top-proximitized TI nanoribbons. Our simulation results
indicate that a top-proximitized TI nanoribbon is ideally suited for realizing
fully gapped topological superconductivity, in particular when the Fermi level
is pinned near the Dirac point. In this regime, the setup yields a single pair
of MBSs, well separated at opposite ends of the proximitized ribbon, which
gives rise to a robust quantized zero-bias conductance peak.

Bismuth (Bi) atomic layers are known as 2D topological materials with variety
of the electronic structures and topological orders depending on the number of
stacking layers. Recently, it is reported that few layers of Bi grown on
semiconductor substrate InSb(111)B exhibit the Sierpi\'{n}ski-triangle (ST)
fractal patterns on the surface. In this work, we have grown Bi layers on
InSb(111)B and traced the evolution of the atomic and electronic structures of
Bi. The surface atomic structures and growth modes were monitored by using
reflective high-energy electron diffraction and core-level photoelectron
spectroscopy. It is suggested that the single layer of the ST-phase Bi grows on
InSb(111)B and the following Bi deposition causes layer-by-layer growth up to
nominally 4 atomic layers. Diffuse band dispersion and quantum well states
observed by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy are consistent with the
small surface domains and variation of the thickness even during the
layer-by-layer growth region. The further Bi evaporation changes the growth
mode to the 3D island formation. The unveiled growth behavior of Bi on
InSb(111)B would provide a new interesting playground to study 2D topological
electronic structure of quasi-periodic 2D atomic layers.

Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) combined with broken inversion symmetry play key
roles in inducing Rashba effect. The combined spontaneous polarization and
Rashba effect enable controlling a material's spin degrees of freedom
electrically. In this work we investigated the electronic band structure for
several combinations of TiX2 monolayers (X= Te, S and Se): TiTe2/TiSe2,
TiTe2/TiS2, and TiSe2/TiS2. Based on the observed orbital hybridization between
the different monolayers in these hetero-structures (HSs), we conclude that the
most significant Rashba splitting occurs in TiSe2/TiS2. Subsequently, we used
Fluorine (F) as an adatom over the surface of TiSe2/TiS2 at hollow and top
sites of the surface to enhance the Rashba intensity, as the F adatom induces
polarization due to difference in charge distribution. Furthermore, by
increasing the number of F atoms on the surface, we reinforced the band
splitting, i.e., we observe Rashba splitting accompanied by Zeeman splitting at
the valence-band edge states. Berry curvatures at K and K' with equal and
opposite nature confirms the existence of valley polarization. The
computationally observed properties suggest that these HSs are promising
candidates for spin-valley Hall effect devices and other spintronic
applications.

<h3>Electronic structure of biased alternating twist multilayer graphene</h3>

<br>
We theoretically study the energy and optical absorption spectra of
alternating twist multilayer graphene (ATMG) under a perpendicular electric
field. We obtain analytically the low-energy effective Hamiltonian of ATMG up
to pentalayer in the presence of the interlayer bias by means of first-order
degenerate-state perturbation theory, and present general rules for
constructing the effective Hamiltonian for an arbitrary number of layers. Our
analytical results agree to an excellent degree of accuracy with the fully
numerical calculations for twist angles $\theta \gtrsim 2.2^{\circ}$ that are
larger than the typical range of magic angles. We also calculate the optical
conductivity of ATMG and determine its characteristic optical spectrum, which
is tunable by the interlayer bias. When the interlayer potential difference is
applied between consecutive layers of ATMG, the Dirac cones at the two
moir\'{e} Brillouin zone corners $\bar{K}$ and $\bar{K}'$ acquire different
Fermi velocities, generally smaller than that of monolayer graphene, and the
cones split proportionally in energy resulting in a step-like feature in the
optical conductivity.

We study bosonic topological phases constructed from electrons. In addition
to a bulk excitation energy gap, these bosonic phases also have a fermion
energy gap, below which all local excitations in the bulk and on the edge are
even combinations of electrons. We focus on chiral phases, in which all
low-energy edge excitations move in the same direction, that arise from the
short-range entangled $E_8$ quantum Hall state, the bosonic analog of the
filled lowest Landau level of electrons. The $E_8$ edge-state theory features
an $E_8$ Kac-Moody symmetry that can be decomposed into ${\cal G}_A \times
{\cal G}_B$ subalgebras, such as $SU(3) \times E_6$, $SO(M) \times SO(16-M)$,
and $G_2 \times F_4$. (Here, $\{SO(M) \}$, $\{SU(N)\}$, and $\{E_8, G_2, F_4
\}$ denote orthogonal, unitary, and exceptional Lie algebras.) Using these
symmetry decompositions, we construct exactly solvable coupled-wire model
Hamiltonians for families of long-range entangled ${\cal G}_A$ or ${\cal G}_B$
bosonic fractional quantum Hall states that ``partially fill" the $E_8$ state
and are pairwise related by a generalized particle-hole symmetry. These
long-range entangled states feature either Abelian or non-Abelian topological
order. Some support the emergence of non-local Dirac and Majorana fermions,
Ising anyons, metaplectic anyons, Fibonacci anyons, as well as deconfined
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge fluxes and charges.

The interfacial structure of a silicon grain boundary (Si-GB) plays a
decisive role on its chemical functionalization and has implications in diverse
physical-chemical properties of the material. Therefore, GB interface is
particularly relevant when the material is employed in high performance
technological applications. Here, we studied from first principles the role of
GB interface by providing an atomistic understanding of two different
$\Sigma$3\{112\} Si-GB models. These models are (1$\times$1) and (1$\times$2)
$\Sigma$3\{112\} Si-GBs which lead to different structural reconstruction.
Starting from these two models, we have shown that geometry optimization has an
important role on the structural reconstruction of the GB interface and
therefore on its properties. For this reason, we discussed different
methodologies to define an optimal relaxation protocol. The influence of the
local structures in (1$\times$1) and (1$\times$2) models have also been
investigated in the presence of vacancies where different light impurities of
different valency (C, N, H, O) can segregate. We studied how local structures
in (1$\times$1) and (1$\times$2) models are modified by the presence of
vacancies and impurities. These structural modifications have been correlated
with the changes of the energetics and electronic properties of the GBs. The
behavior of (1$\times$1) and (1$\times$2) models demonstrated to be
significantly different. The interaction with vacancies and the segregation of
C, N, H and O are significantly different depending on the type of local
structures present in $\Sigma$3\{112\} Si-GB.

The random quantum $q$-state clock and Potts models are studied in 2 and 3
dimensions. The existence of Griffiths phases is tested in the 2D case with
$q=6$ by sampling the integrated probability distribution of local
susceptibilities of the equivalent McCoy-Wu 3D classical modelswith Monte Carlo
simulations. No Griffiths phase is found for the clock model. In contrast,
numerical evidences of the existence of Griffiths phases in the random Potts
model are given and the Finite Size effects are analyzed. The critical point of
the random quantum clock model is then studied by Strong-Disorder
Renormalization Group. Despite a chaotic behavior of the Renormalization-Group
flow at weak disorder, evidences are given that this critical behavior is
governed by the same Infinite-Disorder Fixed Point as the Potts model,
independently from the number of states $q$.

Microstructural heterogeneity affects the macro-scale behavior of materials.
Conversely, load distribution at the macro-scale changes the microstructural
response. These up-scaling and down-scaling relations are often modeled using
multiscale finite element (FE) approaches such as FE-squared ($FE^2$). However,
$FE^2$ requires numerous calculations at the micro-scale, which often renders
this approach intractable. This paper reports an enormously faster machine
learning (ML) based approach for multiscale mechanics modeling. The proposed
ML-driven multiscale analysis approach uses an ML-model that predicts the local
stress tensor fields in a linear elastic fiber-reinforced composite
microstructure. This ML-model, specifically a U-Net deep convolutional neural
network (CNN), is trained separately to perform the mapping between the spatial
arrangement of fibers and the corresponding 2D stress tensor fields. This
ML-model provides effective elastic material properties for up-scaling and
local stress tensor fields for subsequent down-scaling in a multiscale analysis
framework. Several numerical examples demonstrate a substantial reduction in
computational cost using the proposed ML-driven approach when compared with the
traditional multiscale modeling approaches such as full-scale FE analysis, and
homogenization based $FE^2$ analysis. This approach has tremendous potential in
efficient multiscale analysis of complex heterogeneous materials, with
applications in uncertainty quantification, design, and optimization.

Small angle grain boundaries (SAGBs) with pure tilt/twist characters have
been extensively studied, but most SAGB characters are referred to be the mixed
type in the GB space with five Degrees of Freedom (DOFs), which makes their
dislocation structures complicated. With a machine learning potential trained
by ab initio datasets of silicon, we reported dislocation structures of silicon
[001] SAGBs under the effects of two DOFs and discussed the structural and
energetic correlations between mixed and individual tilt/twist characters. This
work only reveals a small part of the entire structural landscape but
highlights promising prospects in the design and application of these complex
dislocation network structures.

The preparation method of thermoelectric PbTe-CdTe semiconductor
nanocomposite in the form of a bulk material doped with Bi, I or Na, intended
for production the mid-temperature thermoelectric energy generators is
presented. The method takes advantage of the extremely low mutual solubility of
both semiconductors, resulting from their different crystal structure, and is
based on a specifically designed Bridgman growth procedure. It is shown that
the formation of zinc-blende crystalline CdTe grains in the rock-salt matrix of
thermoelectric PbTe can be forced during the synthesis of a composite by
introducing Cd in the form of CdTe compound and choosing the growth temperature
above the melting point of PbTe but below the melting point of CdTe. X-ray
diffraction and SEM-EDX spectroscopy analyzes as well as basic electric and
thermoelectric characterization of the nanocomposite samples containing 2, 5
and 10 at. \% of Cd showed that using proposed growth procedure, it is possible
to obtain both n-type (Bi- or I-doped) and p-type (Na-doped) material with
carrier concentration of 1{\div}5 x 10\^{19} cm\^{-3} and uniformly distributed
CdTe grains with a diameter of the order of 100 nm.

Faces-classes of grains, often referred to as topological features, largely
dictate the evolution of polycrystalline microstructures during grain growth.
Realising these topological features is generally an arduous task, often
demanding sophisticated techniques. In the present work, a distinct
machine-learning algorithm is extended for the first time to comprehend the
topological distribution of the grains constituting a polycrystalline
continuum. This regression-based object-detection approach, besides
significantly reducing human-efforts and ensuring computational efficiency,
predicts the face-class of the grains by introducing appropriate bounding
boxes. After sufficient training and validation, over 500 epochs, the current
model exhibits a remarkable overlap with the ground truth that encompasses
manually realised topological features of the polycrystalline microstructures.
Accuracy of this treatment is further substantiated by relevant statistical
studies including precision-recall analysis. The model is exposed to unknown
test dataset and its performance is assessed by comparing its predictions with
the labelled microstructures. Reflecting the statistical accuracy, a strong
agreement between the algorithm-predictions and the ground truth is noticeable
in these comparative studies involving polycrystalline systems with varying
number of grains.

<h3>Interference effects in polarization controlled Rayleigh scattering in  twisted bilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14633" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14633</a>
<br>
<i>Disha Arora, Deepanshu Aggarwal, Sankalpa Ghosh, Rohit Narula</i>
<br>
<br>
We calculate the polarization controlled, \textit{Rayleigh scattering}
response of twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) for a wide range of
misorientation/twist angles $\theta$ including the magic angle. The dominant
regions of the Moir\'e Brillouin zone (MBZ) contributing to the Rayleigh
scattering process are identified and we describe their evolution in detail
with the variation in the twist angle and the incoming laser energy.
Remarkably, in a broad range of cases, the dominant wavevectors are found to
emanate instead from the $\bm{\Gamma}$ point of the MBZ in contrast to
single-layer graphene (SLG) and AB-stacked bilayer graphene where the
significant contributions always stem from the vicinity of the $\bm{K}$ point.
Compared to the SLG, the integrated Rayleigh intensity is strongly enhanced for
small twist angles ($\approx $ 4500 \% increase for twist angle $ \theta =
1.5^{\circ} $ at laser energy $ E_L=2\si{\electronvolt} $ ) in the case of
parallel polarization, while it exhibits a markedly complex behaviour
suggestive of strong interference effects mediated by the optical matrix
elements in the cross polarization case where the polariser and analyser are at
an angle of $90^\circ$ with each other. While investigating the optical ratio
$R_A$ over a range of incoming laser energies we observe a characteristic
evolution as the twist angle reduces, thus providing a unique fingerprint
capable of serving as an experimental identification of the prevailing twist
angle of the tBLG sample under study.

<h3>Unique definition of localized states in molecular spin</h3>

Although localized basis plays an important role in providing a physics
picture of the magnetic dynamics in molecular spins, little attention has been
given to the uniqueness and rigor in its definition. Here we propose a new
definition of the localized basis for both non-Kramers and Kramers system based
on the time-reversal symmetry of the spin Hamiltonian and the easy magnetic
axis of the molecular spin. Given this definition, a unique and practical
determination of the localized basis is achieved, which allows to associate a
wave function with either "up" or "down" magnetic moment orientation in
molecular spins. This facilitates a comprehensible interpretations of
magnetization dynamics and eases the process of building simplified theoretical
models involving the materials.

<h3>Topological electronic structure of twin boundaries and twinning  superlattices in the SnTe material class</h3>

<br>
<br>
The topological electronic structure of a single twin boundary and coherent
twinning superlattices (TSLs) based on the SnTe class of material is calculated
and discussed within a supercell implementation. The superlattices consist of
two twin planes (TPs) in the supercell arranged in such a way that each of the
boundaries forms a mirror plane for the entire structure. Two types of TP
boundary, cationic and anionic, can exist, and so three types of supercells can
be constructed. We study the topological phases of each twinning configuration
using the tight-binding approximation and calculating the topological
invariants. We show that they differ by topological properties. We find that
all-cationic TSLs are topologically distinct from the anionic case due to the
opposite sign of the Berry curvature around the $ \mathrm{ \Gamma} $ point of
the TSLs Brillouin Zone. Our findings are consistent with a complementary
analysis of (111)-oriented slabs with a single twin boundary in the presence of
the Zeeman field. They are also consistent with the number of spin-polarized
Dirac-like edge states of both superlattices and slabs. We conclude that each
type of TP forms the 2D mirror-plane-protected topological crystalline
insulator.

<br>

<br>
<br>
We discuss a Rydberg atom chain with a tunable blockade radius from the gauge
theoretic perspective. When the blockade radius is one lattice spacing, this
system can be formulated in terms of the PXP model, and there is a
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ Ising phase transition known to be equivalent to a
confinement-deconfinement transition in a gauge theory, the lattice Schwinger
model. Further increasing the blockade radius, one can add a next-nearest
neighbor (NNN) interaction into the PXP model. We discuss the interpretation of
NNN interaction in terms of the gauge theory and how finite NNN interaction
alters the deconfinement behavior and propose a corresponding experimental
protocol. When the blockade radius reaches two lattice spacing, the model
reduces to the PPXPP model. A novel gauge theory equivalent to the PPXPP model
is formulated, and the phases in the two formulations are delineated. These
results are readily explored experimentally in Rydberg quantum simulators.

<h3>Commensurate and incommensurate magnetic order in the doped  two-dimensional Hubbard model: dynamical mean-field theory analysis</h3>

<br>
<i>I. A. Goremykin, A. A. Katanin</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop dynamical mean field theory approach for the incommensurate
magnetic order, passing to a local coordinate frame with preferable spin
alignment along $z$-axis, which can be considered with the standard impurity
solvers. We apply this approach to describe the evolution of antiferromagnetic
order with doping in the $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model with $t'=0.15$, which is a
typical value for the doped La$_2$CuO$_4$ high-temperature superconductor. We
find that with doping the antiferromagnetic order changes to $(Q,\pi)$
incommensurate one, and then to the paramagnetic phase. The dispersion of holes
in antiferromagnetic phase shows qualitative agreement with the results of the
$t$-$J$ model consideration, but does not cross the Fermi level, such that the
system appears to be in the insulating phase. In the incommensurate phase we
find two branches of holes dispersion, one of them crossing the Fermi level.
The resulting Fermi surface forms hole pockets. We also consider dispersion of
the magnetic excitations, obtained from the non-local dynamic magnetic
susceptibilities, the latter are extracted from the Bethe-Salpeter equations.
The transverse spin excitations are gapless fulfilling Goldstone theorem. The
longitudinal excitations are characterized by a small gap, showing rigidity of
spin excitations. For realistic parameters of hopping and interaction we
reproduce experimentally measured spin-wave dispersion of La$_2$CuO$_4$.

<br>
<br>
In periodic systems, band degeneracies are usually protected and classified
by spatial symmetries. However, the Gamma point at zero-frequency of a photonic
system is an intrinsic degeneracy due to the polarization degree of freedom of
electromagnetic waves. We show here that in chiral photonic crystals, such an
intrinsic degeneracy node carries +(-)2 chiral topological charge and the
topological characters is the same as a spin-1 Weyl point manifested as a
triple degeneracy of two linear propagating bands intersecting a flat band
representing the electrostatic solution. Such an intrinsic triple degeneracy
point (TDP) at Gamma is usually buried in bulk band projections and the
topological charge at photonic zero-frequency has never been observed. Here, by
imposing space-group screw symmetry to the chiral photonic crystal, the
Brillouin zone boundary is transformed into an oppositely charged nodal surface
enclosing the Gamma point. The emergent Fermi-arcs on sample surface are then
forced to connect the bulk band projections of these topological singularities,
revealing the embedded non-trivial topology.

<h3>Enhancement of Second-Order Non-Hermitian Skin Effect by Magnetic Fields</h3>

<i>Chang-An Li, Björn Trauzettel, Titus Neupert, Song-Bo Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
The non-Hermitian skin effect is a unique phenomenon in which an extensive
number of eigenstates are localized at the boundaries of a non-Hermitian
system. Recent studies show that the non-Hermitian skin effect will be
significantly suppressed by magnetic fields. In contrast, we demonstrate that
the second-order skin effect (SOSE) is robust and can be enhanced by magnetic
fields. Moreover, the SOSE can even be induced by magnetic fields from a
trivial non-Hermitian system that does not experience any skin effect at zero
fields. Such anomalous behavior is attributed to the persistence and emergence
of topological line gaps in the complex energy spectrum in presence of magnetic
fields. Our results describe a qualitatively new magnetic field behavior of the
non-Hermitian skin effect.

Exchange interactions determine the correlations between microscopic spins in
magnetic materials. Probing the dynamics of these spin correlations on
ultrashort length and time scales is, however rather challenging, since it
requires simultaneously high spatial and high temporal resolution. Recent
experimental demonstrations of laser-driven two-magnon modes - zone-edge
excitations in antiferromagnets governed by exchange coupling - posed questions
about the microscopic nature of the observed spin dynamics, the mechanism
underlying its excitation, and their macroscopic manifestation enabling
detection. Here, on the basis of a simple microscopic model, we derive the
selection rules for cubic systems that describe the polarization of pump and
probe pulses required to excite and detect dynamics of nearest-neighbor spin
correlations, and can be employed to isolate such dynamics from other magnetic
excitations and magneto-optical effects. We show that laser-driven spin
correlations contribute to optical anisotropy of the antiferromagnet even in
the absence of spin-orbit coupling. In addition, we highlight the role of
subleading anisotropy in the spin system and demonstrate that the dynamics of
the antiferromagnetic order parameter occurs only in next-to-leading order,
determined by the smallness of the magnetic anisotropy as compared to the
isotropic exchange interactions in the system. We expect that our results will
stimulate and support further studies of magnetic correlations on the shortest
length and time scale.

We address the problem of boundary s-wave superconductivity on rectangular
honeycomb lattices: nanoflakes, armchair and zigzag nanotubes. We discuss how
the presence of edges and corners in these systems can significantly alter the
superconducting correlations at a macroscopic length scale, leading to either
nontrivial enhancement or suppression of the superconducting gap value near the
boundaries. This in turn results in different critical temperatures of the gap
closure at boundaries compared to the bulk gap. The effects are macroscopic but
strongly depend on the atomic-level structure of the boundaries.

With the original Bak-Tang-Wisenefeld (BTW) sandpile we uncover the
$1/\varphi$ noise in the mechanism maintaining self-organized criticality (SOC)
- the question raised together with the concept of SOC. We posit that the
dynamics of stress in the BTW sandpile follows quasi-cycles of graduate stress
accumulation that end up with an abrupt stress-release and the drop of the
system to subcritical state. In thermodynamic limit, the intra-cycle dynamics
exhibits the $1/\varphi$ spectrum that extends infinitely and corresponds to
the stress-release within the critical state.

We present a method for computing thermal properties of classical spin
clusters with arbitrarily chosen interactions between spins. For such systems,
instability channels are \textit{a priori} not known. The method is based on
the Fluctuating Local Field (FLF) approach, the effective description of the
system with a nonlinear and fluctuating field, and achieves substantial
improvements over mean-field theory. We show that two fluctuating modes are
sufficient for numerically accurate solution of systems consisting of two dozen
spins, while for larger systems it is needed to account for a larger number of
fluctuating modes for a full quantitative agreement with the exact solution.

The realization of Weyl systems with the minimum nonzero number of Weyl
points (WPs) and full spin polarization remains challenging in topology physics
and spintronic. In this study, for the first time, we used first-principle
calculations and symmetry analysis to demonstrate that BaNiIO$_6$, a
dynamically and thermodynamically stable half-metallic material, hosts fully
spin-polarized single-pair WPs (SP-WPs) with a charge number ($\cal{C}$) of
$\pm$2 and a type-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral3} band dispersion around
the Fermi level. Moreover, the fully spin-polarized SP-WPs induce
double-helicoid Fermi arcs on the (10$\overline{1}$0) surface. The
half-metallic state and the spin-polarized SP-WPs are robust to uniform strains
(from -10\% to +8\%) and on-site Hubbard-Coulomb interactions (from 0 eV to 6

hosts six additional type-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2} WPs with
$\lvert{\cal{C}}\rvert=1$ in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone in addition
to the two type-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral3} WPs with

The open water surface is known to be charged. Yet, the magnitude of the
charge and the physical mechanism of the charging remain unclear, causing
heated debates across the scientific community. Here we directly measure the
charge Q of microdrops ejected from hydrophilic and hydrophobic capillaries and
show that the water surface can take both positive or negative charge values
depending on pH and the capillary type. Our experiments, theory, and
simulations provide evidence that a junction of two aqueous interfaces with a
different ion adsorption energy (e.g., liquid-solid and liquid-air interfaces)
develops a pH-dependent contact potential difference {\Delta}{\phi} up to 52
mV. The longitudinal charge transfer between the interfaces stimulated by
{\Delta}{\phi} determines the charge of the open water surface. The suggested
static electrification mechanism provides far-reaching insights into the origin
of electrical potentials in biological and electrochemical energy systems.

<h3>Understanding the Anomalous Hall effect in Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$ from  crystal and magnetic structures</h3>

A large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) has recently been observed in the
intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$ below a
known magnetic phase transition at $T_N$ = 29 K. The spins in this material are
widely believed to order in a highly symmetric collinear antiferromagnetic
configuration, causing extensive debate about how reports of an AHE can be
reconciled with such a state. In this article, we address this controversy by
presenting new neutron diffraction data on single crystals of
Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$ and an analysis that implies that moments in this material
order into a non-collinear configuration, but one that maintains the same
refelction symmetries as the collinear phase. We present new transport and
magneto-optic Kerr measurements which show that AHE signatures persist below
$T_N$ to temperatures as low as $T$ = 5 K and firmly associate them with the
long-range antiferromagnetic order. Finally, we show that these AHE signatures
can be quantitatively reproduced by density functional theory (DFT)
calculations based on the lattice and spin state determined with neutron
diffraction. These combined findings establishes the veracity of the 'crystal
Hall effect' picture, which shows how such effects can emerge from the shape of
magnetic orbitals in compounds containing chiral lattice symmetry regardless of
the symmetry of the ordered spin configuration. These results illuminate a new
path for the discovery of anomalous Hall materials and motivate a targeted
study of the transport properties of intercalated TMDCs and other compounds
containing antiferromagnetic order and chiral lattice symmetry.

<h3>Misleading convergence of the skeleton diagrammatic technique: when the  correct solution can be found</h3>

Convergence of the self-consistent skeleton diagrammatic technique (SDT) --
in which the full Green's function is determined through summation of Feynman
diagrams in terms of itself -- to the wrong answer has been associated with the
existence of non-perturbative branches of the Luttinger-Ward functional.
Although it has been possible to detect misleading convergence without the
knowledge of the exact result, the SDT has remained inapplicable in the regimes
where this happens. We show that misleading convergence does not always
preclude recovering the exact solution. In addition to the established
mechanism, convergence of the SDT to the wrong answer can stem from divergence
of the inherent diagrammatic series, which allows us to recover the exact
solution by a modified SDT protocol based on controlled analytic continuation.
We illustrate this approach by its application to the analytically solvable
(0+0)d Hubbard model, the Hubbard atom, and the 2d Hubbard model in a
challenging strong-coupling regime, for which the SDT is solved with controlled
accuracy by the diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC) technique.

This article presents a design for the two-dimensional heterostructure (2DH)
systems of graphane quantum dot array in graphane (GQD/Graphane), and silicene
quantum dot array in silicane (SiQD/Silicane). A first-principles method was
used to evaluate the deformation effect for magnetism as well as the electronic
properties for the 2DH systems. The energy levels of quantum dot (QD) array and
the band structure of its hydrogenated counterpart are coupling for both 2DH
systems of C and Si. The hydrogenated part shares part of strain on QD array,
however, the strain sharing effect is stronger in SiQD/silicane than in
GQD/graphane. The strain sharing enhances the band coupling of the QD and its
hydrogen counterpart in the low energy region. The band coupling alters the
electronic properties of the 2DH systems and change the magnetic properties of
triangular and parallelogram of SiQD/Silicane array under compressive strain
larger than 5%. Strain modulates the band gap of the 2DH system. For
SiQD/Silicane systems, the homogeneous strain not only induces the phase
transition of from semiconductor to metal, but also remove the magnetism of
triangular and parallelogram SiQD array. The 2DH system can be used in the
design of nanoelectronic devices and binary logic based on nanoscale magnetism.

<h3>Exciton magnetic polaron in CdTe/Cd_{1-x}Mn_{x}Te semimagnetic quantum  ring</h3>

Magnetically doped nanostructures can significantly enhance the interaction
between the band carriers and the dopant atoms. Motivated by the demonstration
of the enhanced sp-d exchange interaction in quantum confined structures with
the increased stability of the exciton magnetic polaron (EMP), we report the
quantitative and qualitative analyses of the EMP formation in
CdTe/Cd_{1-x}Mn_{x}Te diluted magnetic quantum ring (QR). The QR with two
different configurations: (i) the non-magnetic ring (CdTe) embedded in the
semimagnetic Cd_{1-x}Mn_{x}Te matrix, and (ii) magnetically non-uniform quantum
structures embedded with Mn2+ ions both in the ring and in the barrier regimes,
have been investigated for various mole fractions of the Mn dopants. The larger
polaron binding energy (EMP) of 23meV is estimated for the 5% molar Mn contents
compared to the other quantum confined systems made of CdMnTe. The magnetic
field dependence of the MP energy and the corresponding polaron parameters like
exchange field, localization radius of the MP, and the degree of circular
polarization induced by the external applied magnetic field at T = 4.2K have
been derived. The obtained results are in excellent agreement with the trend of
the significant degradation of EMP in an external magnetic field, and with the
contradictory tendencies of EMP for the QR with configuration (i) and (ii), as
reported from the time-integrated measurements based on selective excitation
for the quantum systems made of CdMnTe and other DMS materials.

<h3>Unsupervised learning for structure detection in plastically deformed  crystals</h3>

Detecting structures at the particle scale within plastically deformed
crystalline materials allows a better understanding of the occurring phenomena.
While previous approaches mostly relied on applying hand-chosen criteria on
different local parameters, these approaches could only detect already known
structures.We introduce an unsupervised learning algorithm to automatically
detect structures within a crystal under plastic deformation. This approach is
based on a study developed for structural detection on colloidal materials.
This algorithm has the advantage of being computationally fast and easy to
implement. We show that by using local parameters based on bond-angle
distributions, we are able to detect more structures and with a higher degree
of precision than traditional hand-made criteria.

<h3>Boundary Quantum Phase Transitions in the Spin $\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg  Chain with Boundary Magnetic Fields</h3>

We consider the spin $\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain with boundary magnetic
fields and analyze it using a combination of Bethe ansatz and density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) techniques. We show that the system exhibits
several different ground states which depend on the orientation of the boundary
magnetic fields. When both the boundary fields take equal values greater than a
critical field strength, each edge in the ground state accumulates a fractional
spin which saturates to spin $\frac{1}{4}$, which is similar to systems
exhibiting symmetry protected topological phases (SPT). Unlike in SPT systems,
the fractional boundary spin in the Heisenberg spin chain is not a genuine
quantum number since the variance of the associated operator does not vanish,
this is due to the absence of a bulk gap. The system exhibits high energy bound
states when the boundary fields take values greater than the critical field.
All the excitations in the system can be sorted out into towers whose number
depends on the number of bound states exhibited by the system. As the boundary
fields are varied, in addition to the ground state phase transition, we find
that the system may undergo an eigenstate phase transition (EPT) where the
number of towers of the Hilbert space changes. We further inquire how the EPT
reflects itself on local ground state properties by computing the magnetization
profile $\langle S^z_j \rangle$ using DMRG. We identify a clear qualitative
change from low edge fields to high edge fields when crossing the critical
field. We though are unable to conclude on the basis of our data that EPT
corresponds to a genuine phase transition in the ground state.

We propose and theoretically investigate a novel Maxwell's demon
implementation based on the spin-momentum locking property of topological
matter. We use nuclear spins as a memory resource which provides the advantage
of scalability. We show that this topological information device can ideally
operate at the Landauer limit; the heat dissipation required to erase one bit
of information stored in the demon's memory approaches $k_B T\ln2$.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that all available energy, $k_B T\ln2$ per one bit
of information, can be extracted in the form of electrical work. Finally, we
find that the current-voltage characteristics of topological information device
satisfy the conditions of an ideal memristor.

<h3>High critical field superconductivity at ambient pressure in MoB$_2$  stabilized in the P6/mmm structure via Nb substitution</h3>

<br>
<br>
Recently it was discovered that, under elevated pressures, MoB$_2$ exhibits
superconductivity at a critical temperature, $T_c$, as high as 32 K. The
superconductivity appears to develop following a pressure-induced structural
transition from the ambient pressure R$\bar{3}$m structure to an MgB$_2$-like
P6/mmm structure. This suggests that remarkably high $T_c$ values among
diborides are not restricted to MgB$_2$ as previously appeared to be the case,
and that similarly high $T_c$ values may occur in other diborides if they can
be coerced into the MgB$_2$ structure. In this paper, we show that density
functional theory calculations indicate that phonon free energy stabilizes the
P6/mmm structure over the R$\bar{3}$m at high temperatures across the
Nb$_{1-x}$Mo$_x$B$_2$ series. X-ray diffraction confirms that the synthesized
Nb-substituted MoB$_2$ adopts the MgB$_2$ crystal structure. High magnetic
field electrical resistivity measurements and specific heat measurements
demonstrate that Nb$_{1-x}$Mo$_x$B$_2$ exhibits superconductivity with $T_c$ as
high as 8 K and critical fields approaching 6 T.
