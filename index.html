<h3>Description of the three phases of water regarded as Bose-Einstein  condensates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07991" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07991</a>
<br>
<i>François Fillaux</i>
<br>
<br>
The pivotal reason why many physical properties of water are notoriously at
odd with Boltzmann's statistics is that the states of equilibrium of H$_2$O are
Bose-Einstein-condensates -- free of quantum and statistical fluctuations --
protected against depletion by the modest dissociation threshold of the
H-bonds. Indeed, condensates support a line of reasoning proceeding from the
laws of quantum mechanics to macroscopic phenomena, with no
quantum-to-classical discontinuity and no arbitrary hypothesis. The phases of
water are two-level systems, with or without tunneling splittings of second
order. The heat capacity indicates departure from equipartition of energy due
to entanglement. The thermal energy of every phase is determined by occupation
numbers and a phase transition occurs whenever molecules bunch into either
level. The latent heats mirror changes of the number of degenerate condensates
and of the H-bonds. The structures of the three phases are isomorphic hexagonal
lattices. This case study demonstrates existence of condensates for the three
phases of the matter in an everyday environment.

<h3>The quantum geometric origin of capacitance in insulators</h3>

In band insulators, where the Fermi surface is absent, adiabatic transport is
allowed only due to the geometry of the Hilbert space. By driving the system at
a small but finite frequency $\omega$, transport is still expected to depend
sensitively on the quantum geometry. Here we show that this expectation is
correct and can be made precise by expressing the Kubo formula for conductivity
as the variation of the \emph{time-dependent polarization} with respect to the
applied field. In particular, a little appreciated effect is that at linear
order in frequency, the longitudinal conductivity results from an intrinsic
capacitance, determined by the ratio of the quantum metric and the spectral
gap. We demonstrate that this intrinsic capacitance has a measurable effect in
a wide range of insulators with non-negligible metric, including the electron
gas in a quantizing magnetic field, the gapped bands of hBN-aligned twisted
bilayer graphene, and obstructed atomic insulators such as diamond whose large
refractive index has a topological origin. We also discuss the influence of
quantum geometry on the dielectric constant.

Hybrid systems represent one of the frontiers in the study of unconventional
superconductivity and are a promising platform to realize topological
superconducting states. Owing to their mesoscopic dimensions, these materials
are challenging to probe using many conventional measurement techniques, and
require new experimental probes to successfully characterize. In this work, we
develop a probe that enables us to measure the superfluid density of
micron-size superconductors using microwave techniques drawn from circuit
quantum electrodynamics (cQED). We apply this technique to a paradigmatic
hybrid system, the superconductor/ferromagnet bilayer, and find that the
proximity-induced superfluid density is two-fold anisotropic within the plane
of the sample and exhibits power law temperature-scaling which is indicative of
a nodal superconducting state. These experimental results are consistent with
the theoretically predicted signatures of induced triplet pairing with a nodal
$p$-wave order parameter. Moreover, we unexpectedly observe drastic
modifications to the microwave response at frequencies near the ferromagnetic
resonance, suggesting a coupling between the spin dynamics and induced
superconducting order in the ferromagnetic layer. Our results offer new
insights into the unconventional superconducting states induced in
superconductor/ferromagnet heterostructures and simultaneously establish a new
avenue for the study of fragile unconventional superconductivity in
low-dimensional materials such as van der Waals heterostructures.

<h3>Effect of electron-electron interaction and disorder potential on the  localization of two-dimensional electrons in a strong magnetic field</h3>

The density functional theory is used to study the electronic structure of a
quantum wire in a magnetic field. The Kohn-Sham equations are solved
numerically for different values of electron densities and filling factors. The
critical density, below which the electron density has a strong spatial
inhomogeneity, was found in GaAs quantum wire. An empirical formula for the
critical density is obtained. The effect of the disorder potential on the
electron density profile in a two-dimensional electron gas is estimated.

<h3>Photocurrents induced by structured light</h3>

Advances in manipulating the structure of optical beams enable the study of
interaction between structured light and low-dimensional semiconductor systems.
We explore the photocurrents in two-dimensional systems excited by such
inhomogeneous radiation with structured field. Besides the contribition
associated with the intensity gradient, the photocurrent contains contributions
driven by the gradients of the Stokes polarization parameters and the phase of
the electromagnetic field. We develop a microscopic theory of the photocurrents
induced by structured light and derive analytical expressions for all the
photocurrent contributions at intraband transport of electrons. The theory is
applied to analyze the radial and azimuthal photocurrents excited by twisted
light beams carrying orbital angular momentum, and possible experiments to
detect the photocurrents are discussed.

<h3>Topological characterization of special edge modes from the winding of  relative phase</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08100" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08100</a>
<br>
<i>Sudarshan Saha, Tanay Nag, Saptarshi Mandal</i>
<br>
<br>
The symmetry-constrained topological invariant fails to explain the emergence
of the special edge modes when system does not preserve discrete symmetries.
The inversion or chiral symmetry broken SSH model is an example of one such
system where one-sided edge state with finite energy appears at one end of the
open chain. To investigate whether this special edge mode is of topological
origin or not, we introduce a concept of relative phase between the components
of a two-component spinor and define a winding number by the change of this
relative phase over the one-dimensional Brillouin zone. The relative phase
winds non-trivially (trivially) in accord with the presence (absence) of the
one-sided edge mode inferring the bulk boundary correspondence. We extend this
analysis to a two dimensional case where we characterize the non-trivial phase,
hosting gapped one-sided edge mode, by the winding in relative phase only along
a certain axis in the Brillouin zone. We demonstrate all the above findings
from a generic parametric representation while topology is essentially
determined by whether the underlying lower-dimensional projection includes or
excludes the origin. Our study thus reveals a new paradigm of symmetry broken
topological phases for future studies.

<h3>Oxygen isotope effect on the superfluid density within the $d-$wave and  $s-$wave pairing channels of YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08112" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08112</a>
<br>
<i>Rustem Khasanov, Alexander Shengelaya, Kazimierz Conder, Janusz Karpinski, Annette Bussmann-Holder, Hugo Keller</i>
<br>
<br>
We report on measurements of the oxygen isotope ($^{16}$O/$^{18}$O) effect
(OIE) on the transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ and the zero-temperature
in-plane magnetic penetration depth $\lambda_{\rm ab}(0)$ in the stoichiometric
cuprate superconductor YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$ by means of muon-spin
rotation/relaxation. An analysis of the temperature evolution of
$\lambda^{-2}_{\rm ab}$ in terms of coexisting $s+d-$wave order parameters
reveals that the OIE on the superfluid density $\rho_{\rm
s}(0)\propto\lambda^{-2}_{\rm ab}(0)$ stems predominantly from the $d-$wave
component while the contribution of the $s-$wave one is almost zero. The OIE on
the transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ is found to be rather small: $\delta
T_{\rm c}/T_{\rm c}= -0.32(7)$%, compared to the total OIE on the superfluid
density $\rho_{\rm s}(0)$: $\delta \rho_{\rm s}(0)/\rho_{\rm s}(0)=
-2.8(1.0)$%. The partial OIE's on the corresponding $d-$wave and $s-$wave
components of $\rho_{\rm s}(0)$ are $\delta \rho_{\rm s,d}(0)/\rho_{\rm s}(0)=
-3.0(1.2)$%, and $\delta \rho_{\rm s,s}(0)/\rho_{\rm s}(0)= 0.2(1.2)$%,
respectively. Our results demonstrate that polaron formation in the CuO$_2$
planes is the origin of the observed OIE in the $d-$wave channel. In the much
weaker $s-$wave channel, fermionic quasiparticles are present, which do not
contribute to the OIE on $\rho_{\rm s}(0)$. Our results support the original
idea of K. Alex M\"{u}ller on the polaronic nature of the supercarries in
high-temperature cuprate superconductors.

<h3>Pausing ultrafast melting by multiple femtosecond-laser pulses</h3>

<br>
<br>
An intense femtosecond-laser excitation of a solid induces highly nonthermal
conditions. In materials like silicon, laser-induced bond-softening leads to a
highly incoherent ionic motion and eventually nonthermal melting. But is this
outcome an inevitable consequence, or can it be controlled? Here, we performed
ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of crystalline silicon after multiple
femtosecond-laser pulse excitations with total energy above the nonthermal
melting threshold. Our results demonstrate an excitation mechanism, which can
be generalized to other materials, that pauses nonthermal melting and creates a
metastable state instead, which has an electronic structure similar to the
ground state. Our findings open the way for a search for metastable structural
and/or electronic transitions in the high-excitation regime. In addition, our
approach could be used to switch off nonthermal contributions in experiments,
which could be used to obtain reliable electron-phonon coupling constants more
easily.

<h3>Emergent conformal boundaries from finite-entanglement scaling in matrix  product states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08163" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08163</a>
<br>
<i>Rui-Zhen Huang, Long Zhang, Andreas M. Läuchli, Jutho Haegeman, Frank Verstraete, Laurens Vanderstraeten</i>
<br>
<br>
The use of finite entanglement scaling with matrix product states (MPS) has
become a crucial tool for studying 1+1d critical lattice theories, especially
those with emergent conformal symmetry. We argue that finite entanglement
introduces a relevant deformation in the critical theory. As a result, the
bipartite entanglement Hamiltonian defined from the MPS can be understood as a
boundary conformal field theory with a physical and an entanglement boundary.
We are able to exploit the symmetry properties of the MPS to engineer the
physical conformal boundary condition. The entanglement boundary, on the other
hand, is related to the concrete lattice model and remains invariant under this
relevant perturbation. Using critical lattice models described by the Ising,
Potts, and free compact boson CFTs, we illustrate the influence of the symmetry
and the relevant deformation on the conformal boundaries in the entanglement
spectrum.

<h3>Nonlinear phonon Hall effects in ferroelectrics: its existence and  non-volatile electrical control</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08177" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08177</a>
<br>
<i>W. Luo, J. Y. Ji, P. Chen, Y. Xu, L. F. Zhang, H. J. Xiang, L. Bellaiche</i>
<br>
<br>
Nonlinear Hall effects have been previously investigated in
non-centrosymmetric systems for electronic systems. However, they only exist in
metallic systems and are not compatible with ferroelectrics since these latter
are insulators, hence limiting their applications. On the other hand,
ferroelectrics naturally break inversion symmetry and can induce a non-zero
Berry curvature. Here, we show that a non-volatile electric-field control of
heat current can be realized in ferroelectrics through the nonlinear phonon
Hall effects. More precisely, based on Boltzmann equation under the
relaxation-time approximation, we derive the equation for nonlinear phonon Hall
effects, and further show that the behaviors of nonlinear phonon (Boson) Hall
effects are very different from nonlinear Hall effects for electrons (Fermion).
Our work provides a route for electric-field control of thermal Hall current in
ferroelectrics.

<h3>Two-Dimensional Melting of two- and three-component mixtures</h3>

<br>
<i>Yan-Wei Li, Yugui Yao, Massimo Pica Ciamarra</i>
<br>
<br>
We elucidate the interplay between diverse two-dimensional melting pathways
and establish solid/hexatic and hexatic/liquid transition criteria via the
numerical simulations of the melting transition of two- and three-component
mixtures of hard polygons and disks. We show that a mixture's melting pathway
may differ from its components and demonstrate eutectic mixtures that
crystallize at a higher density than their pure components. Comparing the
melting scenario of many two- and three-component mixtures, we establish
universal melting criteria: the solid and hexatic phases become unstable as the
density of topological defects respectively overcomes $\rho_{d,{\rm s}} \simeq
0.046$ and $\rho_{d,{\rm h}}\simeq 0.123$.

<h3>Designer Edge States in Fractional Polarization Insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08220" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08220</a>
<br>
<i>Wei Jie Chan, Peihao Fu, L. K. Ang, Yee Sin Ang</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically investigated the topological-protected edge states (TESs) in
an anisotropic honeycomb lattice with mirror and chiral symmetries,
characterized by an alternative topological invariant - fractional polarization
(FP), rather than the conventional Chern number. This system termed an FP
insulator is a potential platform for edge-state engineering due to its
disconnected TESs. These disconnected and robust TESs are susceptible to
perturbative chiral symmetry-breaking terms which can generate various patterns
including the vanishing helical, spin-polarized, and chiral TESs. Moreover,
helical and chiral TES can be achieved by the finite size effect, not possible
from the aforementioned terms alone. The demonstration of these various TES in
an FP-insulator offers an alternative route in designing reconfigurable
two-dimensional nanoelectronic devices.

<h3>Reentrant quantum spin Hall effect in the presence of an exchange field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08225" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08225</a>
<br>
<i>Xiaoyu Cheng, Xiaohong Zheng, Jun Chen, Liantuan Xiao, Suotang Jia, Lei Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
Driven by various physical origins, the interesting reentrant phenomena in
quantum Hall effect (QHE), quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) and
non-Hermitian systems have been discussed recently. Here, we present that the
reentrant phenomena of quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) can be achieved by
introducing a uniform exchange field into a topological insulator with a
four-band model Hamiltonian. Furthermore, it is found that both time-reversal
(TR) symmetry broken QSHE and spin-polarized QAHE can simultaneously be
generated in the system with proper exchange field strength by inspecting the
corresponding edge states. Through analyzing the energy dependent spin-Chern
number $\nu_s$ and transmission in the presence of random disorders, we verify
the topological protection and the robustness of induced QSHE and QAHE.
Finally, the theoretical realization of reentrant QSHE in a topolectrical
circuit is demonstrated. Our work not only extends the reentrant phenomena into
the QSHE but also stimulates interest in their realization in different
systems.

<h3>Unlocking the Structural Mystery of Vaterite CaCO3</h3>

<br>
<br>
Calcium carbonate (CaCO3), the most abundant biogenic mineral on earth, plays
a crucial role in various fields. Of the four polymorphs, calcite, aragonite,
vaterite, and amorphous CaCO3, vaterite is the most enigmatic one due to an
ongoing debate regarding its structure that has persisted for nearly a century.
In this work, based on systematic transmission electron microscopy
characterizations, elaborate crystallographic analysis and machine learning
aided molecular dynamics simulations with ab initio accuracy, we reveal that
vaterite can be regarded as a polytypic structure. The basic phase is a
monoclinic lattice possessing pseudohexagonal symmetry. Direct imaging and
atomic-scale simulations provide evidence that a single grain of vaterite can
have three orientation variants. Additionally, we find that vaterite undergoes
a second-order phase transition. These atomic scale insights provide a
comprehensive understanding of the structure of vaterite and offer new
perspectives on the biomineralization process of calcium carbonate.

<h3>Eigenmodes of the Laplacian on Hyperbolic Lattices</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We examine a specific category of eigenfunctions of the lattice Laplacian on
$\{p,q\}$-tessellations of the Poincar\'e disk that bear resemblance to plane
waves in the continuum case. Our investigation reveals that the lattice
eigenmodes deviate from the continuum solutions by a factor that depends solely
on the local inclination of the vertex in relation to the wave's propagation
direction. This allows us to compute certain eigenfunctions by numerical and
analytical methods. For various special cases we find explicit exact
eigenfunctions and their eigenvalues on the infinite lattice.

<h3>Geometric and Dynamic Properties of Entangled Polymer Chains in Athermal  Solvents: A Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08260" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08260</a>
<br>
<i>Jiayi Wang, Ping Gao</i>
<br>
<br>
We used a coarse-grained model to study the geometric and dynamic properties
of flexible entangled polymer chains dissolved in explicit athermal solvents.
Our simulations successfully reproduced the geometrical properties including
the scaling relationships between mean-square end-to-end distance $<R_{ee}^2>$,
chain entanglement lengths $N_{e}$ and concentration $\Phi$. Specifically, we
find that $<R_{ee}^2>\sim N*\Phi^{-1/4}$,$N_{e} = 30.01\Phi^{-5/4}+31.23$.
Dynamically, our model confirmed the ratio of the dynamic critical entanglement
$N_{c}$ and the geometric entanglement length $N_{e}$ is constant, with
$N_{c}/N_{e} = 5\sim 6$. To account for the local swelling effect for chains
confined in athermal solvents, we treated the chains using the concept of blobs
where each blob occupies a volume $\Omega_{b}$, with length $g$. Direct MD
simulations and scaling analysis showed that $g \sim \Phi^{-25/36}$,
$\Omega_{b}\sim\Phi^{-5/4}$. Using these together with the concentration
dependent packing length $p \sim \Phi^{-5/12}$, we obtained a modified the
Lin-Noolandi ansatz for concentrated flexible polymer chains in athermal
solvents: $G \sim \frac{\Phi}{\left(N_{e} / g\right) \Omega_{b}} \sim
\Phi^{-2.28}$. We demonstrate this modified ansatz agrees well with our
coarse-grained numerical simulations.

<h3>Irreversible evolution of dislocation pile-ups during cyclic  microcantilever bending</h3>

<br>
<br>
In metals geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) are generated primarily
to accommodate strain gradients and they play a key role in the Bauschinger
effect, strain hardening, micron-scale size effects and fatigue. During bending
large strain gradients naturally emerge which makes this deformation mode
exceptionally suitable to study the evolution of GNDs. Here we present
bi-directional bending experiment of a Cu single crystalline microcantilever
with in situ characterisation of the dislocation microstructure in terms of
high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD). The experiments are
complemented with dislocation density modelling to provide physical
understanding of the collective dislocation phenomena. We find that dislocation
pile-ups form around the neutral zone during initial bending, however, these do
not dissolve upon reversed loading, rather they contribute to the development
of a much more complex GND dominated microstructure. This irreversible process
is analysed in detail in terms of the involved Burgers vectors and slip systems
to provide an in-depth explanation of the Bauschinger-effect and strain
hardening at this scale. We conclude that the most dominant role in this
behaviour is played by short-range dislocation interactions.

<h3>Eshelby's method for unidirectional periodic composites</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08264" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08264</a>
<br>
<i>Guo-Qing Gu, En-Bo Wei</i>
<br>
<br>
Open boundary conditions are always used in investigating the effective
properties of composites. In this paper, Eshelby's transformation field method
is developed to deal with the effective response of unidirectional periodic
composites having an open boundary. In the method, Hermite polynomials are used
to cope with the open boundary conditions of the perturbation fields induced by
the inclusions. The transformation fields are introduced in the composite
system to meet the interface conditions between complex structure inclusions
and matrix. As an example, Eshelby's method is used to estimate the effective
responses of two-dimensional unidirectional periodic dielectric composites
having an open boundary. The validity is verified by comparing the effective
responses calculated by the method with the exact solutions of dilute limit. It
is shown that the method is valid to solve the open boundary problem of
unidirectional periodic composites having complex geometric inclusions.

<br>
<i>Sen Mu, Jiangbin Gong, Gabriel Lemarié</i>
<br>
<br>
We identify the key features of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in the
fluctuations of the wave density logarithm, in a two-dimensional Anderson
localized wave packet. In our numerical analysis, the fluctuations are found to
exhibit an algebraic scaling with distance characterized by an exponent of
$1/3$, and a Tracy-Widom probability distribution of the fluctuations.
Additionally, within a directed polymer picture of KPZ physics, we identify the
dominant contribution of a directed path to the wave packet density and find
that its transverse fluctuations are characterized by a roughness exponent
$2/3$. Leveraging on this connection with KPZ physics, we verify that an
Anderson localized wave packet in 2D exhibits a stretched-exponential
correction to its well-known exponential localization.

Deep potentials for molecular dynamics (MD) achieve first-principles accuracy
at much lower computational cost. However, their use in large length- and
time-scale simulations is limited by their lower speeds compared to analytical
atomistic potentials, primarily due to network complexity and long embedding
time. Here, based on the moments theorem, we develop a chemical-bonding-aware
embedding for neural network potentials that achieve state-of-the-art accuracy
in forces and local electronic density of states prediction with an ultrasmall
16x32 neural network resulting in significantly lower computational cost.

Freckles, one of the common defects in blades used in heavy duty gas
turbines, hugely deteriorates blades mechanical properties and liability under
service conditions. Thermal-solutal convection theory is a widely adopted
formation mechanism but few solid experimental evidences were reported. Here
for the first time we systematically studied the microstructure of 117 grains
in freckle chains from four different Nickel-based superalloys of either single
crystal or directionally solidified alloys. The relationship between the
internal stress and the misorientation throughout the freckle chains is studied
by means of state-of-the-art electron microscopy. All results give new
experimental proof to the theory of thermal-solutal convection, which is
further supported by the fact that borides at the boundary are randomly
orientated to alloys. Our results enrich the methodology of freckle study,
providing a new sight of the formation mechanism of casting defects.

<h3>Fast reconstruction of microstructures with ellipsoidal inclusions using  analytical descriptors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08316" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08316</a>

<br>
<br>
Microstructure reconstruction is an important and emerging aspect of
computational materials engineering and multiscale modeling and simulation.
Despite extensive research and fast progress in the field, the application of
descriptor-based reconstruction remains limited by computational resources.
Common methods for increasing the computational feasibility of descriptor-based
microstructure reconstruction lie in approximating the microstructure by simple
geometrical shapes and by utilizing differentiable descriptors to enable
gradient-based optimization. The present work combines these two ideas for
structures composed of non-overlapping ellipsoidal inclusions such as
magnetorheological elastomers. This requires to express the descriptors as a
function of the microstructure parametrization. Deriving these relations leads
to analytical solutions that further speed up the reconstruction procedure.
Based on these descriptors, microstructure reconstruction is formulated as a
multi-stage optimization procedure. The developed algorithm is validated by
means of different numerical experiments and advantages and limitations are
discussed in detail.

The motion of partly gold (Au)-coated Janus particles under laser irradiation
is caused by self-thermophoresis. Despite numerous studies addressing this
topic, the impact of the preparation method and the degree of coverage of the
particle with Au on the resulting thermophoretic velocity has not yet been
fully understood. A detailed understanding of the most important tuning
parameters during the preparation process is crucial to design Janus particles
that are optimized in Au coverage to receive a high thermophoretic velocity. In
this study, we explore the influence of the fabrication process, which changes
the Au cap size, on the resulting self-propulsion behavior of partly Au-coated
polystyrene particles (Au-PS). Additionally, also the impact of an underlying
adhesion chromium layer is investigated. In addition to the most commonly used
qualitative SEM and EDX measurements, we propose a novel technique utilizing
AFM studies to quantify the cap size. This non-invasive technique can be used
to determine both the size and the maximum thickness of the Au cap. The Au cap
size was systematically varied in a range between about 36 % and 74 % by
different preparation strategies. Nevertheless, we showed that the differing Au
cap size of the Janus particles in this range has no effect on the
thermophoretic velocity. This surprising result is discussed in the paper.

NaCl-type metal tellurides (MTe) have been widely studied due to unique
physical properties. We investigated the In-doping effects on structural and
physical properties of Na-Cl type (AgPbBi)(1-x)/3InxTe and the superconducting
properties of the In-doped samples. Polycrystalline samples with x = 0-0.5 were
synthesized by utilizing high-pressure synthesis. For x = 0.2-0.5,
superconductivity was observed in magnetization measurements, where the highest
transition temperature (Tc) was 2.8 K for x = 0.4. We measured specific heat
for x = 0.4 and confirmed the bulk nature of the superconductivity. The
evolution of the Seebeck coefficient and lattice constant by In doping suggests
that In valence state is In+3, and the In doping generates electron carriers in
the (AgPbBi)(1-x)/3InxTe system.

Weyl semimetals (WSMs) are three-dimensional topological materials that
exhibit fascinating properties due to the presence of Weyl nodes in their band
structure. However, existing WSMs discovered so far often possess multiple
pairs of Weyl nodes, posing a challenge in disentangling the contributions to
transport phenomena from different energy bands. To overcome this challenge, we
have identified field-induced ferromagnetic MnBi$_{2-x}$Sb$_{x}$Te$_{4}$ as an
ideal type-II WSM with a single pair of Weyl nodes. By employing a combination
of quantum oscillations and high-field Hall measurements, we have resolved the
evolution of Fermi-surface sections as the Fermi level is tuned across the
charge neutrality point, precisely matching the band structure of an ideal
type-II WSM. Furthermore, the anomalous Hall conductivity exhibits a
heartbeat-like behavior as the Fermi level is tuned across the Weyl nodes, a
unique feature previously predicted for a type-II WSM. Our findings establish
MnBi$_{2-x}$Sb$_{x}$Te$_{4}$ as an ideal platform for further investigation
into Weyl physics.

<h3>Superconductivity in unconventional metals</h3>

In this work, we define unconventional metals, where a set of low-energy
bands belong to an elementary band representation (EBR) on an empty site. The
characteristic could give rise to soft phonon modes and strong electron-phonon
coupling, yielding charge-density wave (CDW) or/and superconductivity (SC).
Based on the first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that 1H/2H-phase
transition metal dichalcogenides $MX_2~(M={\rm Nb,Ta}; X={\rm S,Se,Te})$ are
unconventional metals, which have a single band of $A_1'@1e$ EBR at the Fermi
level ($E_F$). The computed phonon dispersions indicate the stability of the
system at high temperatures, while the presence of soft phonon modes suggests a
phase transition to the CDW state at low temperatures. Based on the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory and computed electron-phonon coupling,
our calculations show that the SC in NbSe$_2$ is mainly attributed to the soft
phonon modes. In the end, the SC has been predicted in unconventional metal
2H-TaN$_2$ with estimated $T_C= 26$ K. These results demonstrate that the
unconventional metals offer an attractive platform for studying the interplay
between the empty-site EBR and correlated states.

<h3>Chirality Enables Thermal Magnon Transistors</h3>

We report a theory of thermal spin pumping into proximity magnets under a
transverse-bias-driven heat flow of magnons in magnetic films when the dipolar
coupling to the magnetic gate is tuned to be ``chiral". While there is no
rectification of the magnon current in the film, we predict that chirality
diverts up to half of it into the gate. This transverse thermal spin pumping
effect can be controlled by rotating the film magnetization and may help manage
the heat flow in future magnonic circuits.

Binary compositions of surface ligands are known to improve the colloidal
stability and fluorescence quantum yield of nanocrystals (NCs), due to
ligand-ligand interactions and surface organization. Herein, we follow the
thermodynamics of a ligand exchange reaction of CdSe NCs with alkylthiols
mixtures. The effects of ligand polarity and length difference on ligand
packing were investigated using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The
thermodynamic signature of the formation of mixed ligand shells was observed.
Correlating the experimental results with thermodynamic mixing models has
allowed us to calculate the inter-chain interactions and infer the final ligand
shell configuration. Our findings demonstrate that the small dimensions of the
NCs and the subsequent increased interfacial region between dissimilar ligands,
in contrast to macroscopic surfaces, allow the formation of a myriad of
clustering patterns, controlled by the inter-ligand interactions. This work
provides a fundamental understanding of the parameters determining the ligand
shell structure and should help guide smart surface design toward NC-based
applications.

<h3>Effects of lattice imperfections on high-harmonic generation from  correlated systems</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Using the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model we study the effects of lattice
imperfections on high-harmonic generation (HHG) from correlated systems. We
simulate such imperfections by randomly modifying the chemical potential across
the individual lattice sites. We control the degree of correlation by varying
the Hubbard $U$. In the limit of vanishing $U$, this approach results in
Anderson localization. For non-vanishing $U$, we explain the spectral
observations using a qualitative picture in which correlation and the
imperfections may balance each other out, causing Bloch-like transitions, i.e.,
transitions similar to those occurring in the case with small or vanishing $U$
and with vanishing imperfection-induced energy gaps, even though the dynamics
take place under conditions of high $U$ and severe imperfections. We verify
this picture by studying HHG spectra where imperfections are found to cause
gain in the HHG spectra. The spectral gain is mainly in high harmonic orders
for low correlation and low harmonic orders for high correlation. We explain
this using the following qualitative picture. For low correlation, the addition
of imperfections gives rise to significant energy gaps in the system,
corresponding to high harmonics, and when the correlation is massive the
addition of imperfections balances out the correlation, resulting in smaller
energy gaps, meaning lower harmonic orders.
We further demonstrate how in the unbalanced cases, i.e., high $U$ and
relatively small amount of imperfection or vice versa, the dynamics are largely
adiabatic, and how in the balanced cases, with similar magnitude of correlation
and imperfection, the dynamics are qualitatively similar.

Near the melting temperature, equilibrium bismuth melt is characterized by
structural features that are absent in equilibrium monatomic simple liquids. In
the present work, the structure of bismuth melt is studied by X-ray diffraction
experiments and quantum chemical calculations. The presence of quasi-stable
structures in the melt has been found, the lifetime of which exceeds the
structural relaxation time of this melt. It is shown that these structures are
characterized by a low degree of ordering and spatial localisation. It was
found that up to $50$\% of the atoms in the melt can be involved in the
formation of these structures. The elementary structural units of these
structures are triplets of regular geometry with the characteristic lengths
$3.25$ \AA~and $4.7$ \AA~as well as with the characteristic angles $45^{\circ}$
and $90^{\circ}$. The characteristic lengths of these triplets are fully
consistent with correlation lengths associated with the short-range order in
bismuth melt.

<h3>Neural network as a tool for design of amorphous metal alloys with  desired elastoplastic properties</h3>

The development and implementation of the methods for designing amorphous
metal alloys with desired mechanical properties is one of the most promising
areas of modern materials science. Here, the machine learning methods appear to
be a suitable complement to empirical methods related to the synthesis and
testing of amorphous alloys of various compositions. In the present work, it is
proposed a method to determine amorphous metal alloys with mechanical
properties closest to those required. More than $50\,000$ amorphous alloys of
different compositions have been considered, and the Young's modulus $E$ and
the yield strength $\sigma_{y}$ have been evaluated for them by the machine
learning model trained on the fundamental physical properties of the chemical
elements. Statistical treatment of the obtained results reveals that the
fundamental physical properties of the chemical element with the largest mass
fraction are the most significant factors, whose values correlate with the
values of the mechanical properties of the alloys, in which this element is
involved. It is shown that the values of the Young's modulus $E$ and the yield
strength $\sigma_{y}$ are higher for amorphous alloys based on Cr, Fe, Co, Ni,
Nb, Mo and W formed by the addition of semimetals (e.g. Be, B, Al, Sn),
nonmetals (e.g. Si and P) and lanthanides (e.g. La and Gd) than for alloys of
other compositions. Increasing the number of components in alloy from $2$ to
$7$ and changing the mass fraction of chemical elements has no significantly
impact on the strength characteristics $E$ and $\sigma_{y}$. Amorphous metal
alloys with the most improved mechanical properties have been identified. In
particular, such extremely high-strength alloys include Cr$_{80}$B$_{20}$
(among binary), Mo$_{60}$B$_{20}$W$_{20}$ (among ternary) and
Cr$_{40}$B$_{20}$Nb$_{10}$Pd$_{10}$Ta$_{10}$Si$_{10}$ (among multicomponent).

Traditional electronic devices rely on electron's inherent degree of freedom
(d.o.f.) to process information. However, additional d.o.f. like the valley,
can emerge in the low-energy states of certain systems. Here, we show that the
low-energy states of two-dimensional (2D) second-order topological insulators
(SOTIs) possess a new d.o.f., referring to the topological corner states.
Analogous to valleytronic, we term the systems hosting controllable corner
states as cornertronics materials. Via symmetry analysis and material search,
we identify the TiSiCO-family monolayers as the first prototype of
cornertronics materials, where the corner states can be controlled by both
electric and optical fields, due to the novel corner-layer coupling (CLC)
effect and the corner-contrasted optical selection rules. Furthermore, we find
that for the SOTI-based quantum dots (QDs), the confinement energy is very
small and robust against the size reduction, distinguished from the
conventional QDs. Our findings not only pave the way for the cornertronics, but
also open a new direction for the research in 2D SOTI and QD.

The Young's modulus $E$ is the key mechanical property that determines the
resistance of solids to tension/compression. In the present work, the
correlation of the quantity $E$ with such characteristics as the total molar
mass $M$ of alloy components, the number of components $n$ forming an alloy,
the yield stress $\sigma_{y}$ and the glass transition temperature $T_{g}$ has
been studied in detail based on a large set of empirical data for the Young's
modulus of different amorphous metal alloys. It has been established that the
values of the Young's modulus of metal alloys under normal conditions correlate
with such a mechanical characteristic as the yield stress as well as with the
glass transition temperature. As found, the specificity of the ``chemical
formula'' of alloy, which is determined by molar mass $M$ and number of
components $n$, does not affect on elasticity of the material. The machine
learning algorithm identified both the quantities $M$ and $n$ as insignificant
factors in determining $E$. A simple non-linear regression model is obtained
that relates the Young's modulus with $T_{g}$ and $\sigma_{y}$, and this model
correctly reproduces the experimental data for metal alloys of different types.
This obtained regression model generalizes the previously presented empirical
relation $E\simeq49.8\sigma_{y}$ for amorphous metal alloys.

<h3>Non-linear physical aging of supercooled glycerol induced by large  upward ideal temperature steps monitored through cooling experiments</h3>

<br>
<br>
The physical aging of supercooled glycerol induced by upward temperature
steps of amplitude reaching 45 K was studied by a new method consisting in
heating a micrometer-thick liquid film at a rate of up to 60 000 K/s, holding
it at a constant high temperature for a controlled duration before letting it
quickly cool down to the initial temperature. By monitoring the final slow
relaxation of the dielectric loss, we were able to obtain quantitative
information on the liquid response to the initial upward step. The so-called
TNM (Tool-Narayanaswamy-Moynihan) formalism provided a good description of our
observations despite the large distance from equilibrium, provided that
different values of the nonlinearity parameter were used for the cooling phase
and for the (much further from equilibrium) heating phase. In this form, it
allowed to precisely quantify how to design an ideal temperature step, i.e.,
where no relaxation occurs during the heating phase. It helped bringing a clear
physical understanding of how the (kilosecond long) final relaxation is related
to the (millisecond long) liquid response to the upward step. Finally, it made
possible the reconstruction of the fictive temperature evolution immediately
following a step, evidencing the highly non-linear character of the liquid
response to such large amplitude temperature steps. This work illustrates both
the strengths and limitations of the TNM approach. This new experimental device
offers a promising tool to study far-from-equilibrium supercooled liquids
through their dielectric response.

The electronic structure and magnetism of individual Dy atom adsorbed on the
MgO(001) substrate is investigated using the combination of the density
functional theory with the Hubbard-I approximation to the Anderson impurity
model (DFT+U(HIA)). The divalent Dy$^{2+}$ adatom in $f^{10}$ configuration is
found. The calculated x-ray absorption (XAS) and magnetic circular dichroism
(XMCD) spectra are compared to the experimental data. Quantum tunneling between
degenerate $|{J=8.0, J_z= \pm 4.0}>$ states leads to formation of $|{J=8.0,
J_z= 0.0}>$ ground state with an in-plane orientation of the magnetic moment.
It explains absence of remanent magnetization in MgO adatom on the top of
Mg(001) substrate. Our studies can provide a viable route for further
investigation and prediction of the rare-earth single atom magnets.

<i>R. Avriller, A. Marché, G. Jonusauskas</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate theoretically the stochastic dynamics of Resonance Electronic
Energy Transfer (RET), in a bi-dimensional overexcited ensemble of donor and
acceptor molecules. We find that, after initial optical excitation of all the
donors, the reaction kinetics is well-described by a non-linear mean-field
theory. The latter provides a solid way to define and compute an effective rate
of RET, even for disordered samples. We predict that this effective rate scales
as $\left\langle R \right\rangle^{\alpha}$ with $\left\langle R \right\rangle$
the average distance between individual excited donors and their
nearest-neighbor acceptor molecules, and $\alpha \in \left\lbrack -6,-2
\right\rbrack$ an exponent depending on the spatial distribution of molecular
pairs in the sample. Using a kinetic Monte-Carlo approach, we show departures
from this macroscopic mean-field description arising from fluctuations and
spatial correlations between several molecules involved in the RET process. We
expect this prediction to be relevant for both molecular science and biology,
where the control and optimization of the RET dynamics is a key issue.

Edge states of topological systems have attracted great interest due to their
robustness and linear dispersions. Here a superconducting-proximitized edge
interferometer is engineered on a second-order topological insulator Ta2Pd3Te5
with asymmetric edges to realize the interfering Josephson diode effect (JDE),
which hosts many advantages, such as the high efficiency as much as 73% at tiny
applied field 8.4 mT an ultra-low switching power around picowatt, and a giant
interfering magnetochiral anisotropy with a coefficient $\gamma$ = 1.2 $\times
10^9$ T$^{-1}$A$^{-1}$ - three orders of magnitude larger than the reported
record. As an important element to induce such JDE, the second-order harmonic
in the current-phase relation is also experimentally confirmed by half Shapiro
steps. This edge interferometer offers a novel and effective method to enhance
the overall performance of JDE and magnetochiral anisotropy, and boosts great
potential application for future superconducting quantum devices.

We study theoretically the Faraday and Kerr rotation of a probe field due to
the orbital magnetization of a two-dimensional electron gas induced by a
circularly polarized pump. We develop a microscopic theory of these effects in
the intraband spectral range based on the analytical solution of the kinetic
equation for linear and parabolic energy dispersion of electrons and arbitrary
scattering potential. We show that the spectral dependence of rotation angles
and accompanying ellipticities experiences a sharp resonance when the probe and
pump frequencies are close to each other. At the resonance, the Faraday and
Kerr rotation angles are of the order of $0.1^\circ$ per 1~kW/cm$^2$ of the
pump intensity in graphene samples, corresponding to a pump-induced synthetic
magnetic field of about 0.1~T. We also analyze the influence of the dielectric
contrast between dielectric media surrounding the two-dimensional electron gas
on the rotation angles.

We report a statistical analysis of computational nitrogen K-edge spectra of
aqueous triglycine. Structural and spectral variation across the sampled phase
space is notable and can be traced to the collaborative action of numerous
structural degrees of freedom. We train a neural network to predict the
intensities of spectral regions of interest from the structure. These regions
are defined by the temperature-difference profile of the simulated spectra, and
the analysis yields a structural interpretation for their behaviour. Even
though the utilized local many-body tensor representation implicitly encodes
the secondary structure of the peptide, the applied emulator-based component
analysis proves that this information is irrecoverable from the spectra. A hard
X-ray Raman scattering experiment confirms the overall sensibility of the
simulated spectra, but the predicted temperature-dependent effects therein

on the non-reciprocality. The traveling stripe pattern is also found when the
diffusion constants are highly asymmetric and the non-reciprocality is small.

The halide perovskite CsPbBr$_3$ belongs to the Cs-Pb-Br material system,
which features two additional thermodynamically stable ternary phases,
Cs$_4$PbBr$_6$ and CsPb$_2$Br$_5$. The coexistence of these phases and their
reportedly similar photoluminescence have resulted in a debate on the nature of
the emission in these systems. Here, we combine optical and microscopic
characterization with an effective mass, correlated electron-hole model of
excitons in confined systems, to investigate the emission properties of the
ternary phases in the Cs-Pb-Br system. We find that all Cs-Pb-Br phases exhibit
green emission and the non-perovskite phases exhibit photoluminescence quantum
yields orders of magnitude larger than CsPbBr$_3$. In particular, we measure
blue- and red-shifted emission for the Cs- and Pb-rich phases, respectively,
stemming from embedded CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals. Our model reveals that the
difference in emission shift is caused by the combined effects of nanocrystal
size and different band mismatch. Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of
including the dielectric mismatch in the calculation of the emission energy for
Cs-Pb-Br composites. Our results explain the reportedly limited blue shift in
CsPbBr$_3$@Cs$_4$PbBr$_6$ composites and rationalize some of its differences
with CsPb$_2$Br$_5$.

This paper discusses the topological and transport properties of binary
heterostructures of different topological materials. The creation of multilayer
devices is an alternative to building synthetic topological materials. By
adjusting the pattern of layers, we control the global topological properties
that favor tunneling and optimize the conductance of the edge state. Using a
one-dimensional model and the method of Green's functions, we characterize each
layer's edge states and make the chains couplings to generate the
heterostructure. To study the bulk properties, we calculate the topological
invariant from the Zak phase to build phase diagrams, and we obtain an
analytical result for the separation line between different phases that depends
on the hopping parameters of the heterostructure. We calculate the differential
conductance with the non-equilibrium Green function technique showing the
tunneling of the edge states and discussing its possible design and
experimental application.

The $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ method and group theory provide
straightforward analytical expressions for the low energy effective
Hamiltonians of crystalline materials, however it does not provide the
numerical values for its coefficients. These are typically cast as matrix
elements of the generalized momentum operator
$\mathbf{\pi}=\mathbf{p}+\mathbf{p}_{{\rm SOC}}$, which includes spin-orbit
coupling corrections. Their numerical values are usually obtained by fitting
either experimental data, or fitting the ab initio band structure. Here we
develop a code to explicitly calculate the Kane and Luttinger parameters of
$\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ effective Hamiltonians directly from ab initio
wave-functions provided by Quantum Espresso. Additionally, the code analyzes
the symmetry transformations of the wave-functions to optimize the final
Hamiltonian. This an optional step in the code, where it numerically finds the
unitary transformation U that rotates the basis towards an optimal
representation informed by the user. Throughout the paper we present the
methodology in detail, and illustrate the capabilities of the code applying it
to a selection of relevant materials. Particularly, we show a "hands on"

We consider adiabatic quantum pumping through a resonant level model, a
single-level quantum dot connected to two fermionic leads. We develop a
consistent thermodynamic description of this model accounting for the variation
of the energy level of the dot and the tunnelling rates with the thermal baths.
We study various examples of pumping cycles computing the relevant
thermodynamic quantities, such as the entropy produced and the dissipated
power. We then compare these quantities with the transport properties of the
system. Among other results, we find that the entropy production rate vanishes
in the charge quantization limit while the dissipated power is quantized in the
same limit.

We study an exactly solvable model with bond-directional quadrupolar and
octupolar interactions between spin-orbital entangled $j_{\mathrm{eff}} = 3/2$
moments on the honeycomb lattice. We show that this model features a multipolar
spin liquid phase with gapless fermionic excitations. In the presence of
perturbations that break time-reversal and rotation symmetries, we find Abelian
and non-Abelian topological phases in which the Chern number evaluates to $0$,
$\pm 1$, and $\pm 2$. We also investigate quantum phase transitions out of the
multipolar spin liquid using a parton mean-field approach and orbital wave
theory. In the regime of strong integrability-breaking interactions, the
multipolar spin liquid gives way to ferro-quadrupolar-vortex and
antiferro-octupolar ordered phases that harbor a hidden spin-$1/2$ Kitaev spin
liquid. Our work unveils new mechanisms for unusual multipolar orders and
quantum spin liquids in Mott insulators with strong spin-orbit coupling.

<br>
<br>
In this work, we present a ready-to-use symmetry invariant expansion form of
the eight-band k.p Hamiltonian for perovskites. The model is derived to account
for the C4v symmetry and it is utilized to determine the band structures for
perovskite materials of pseudo-cubic phase. In order to find respective
parameters, the band structures of considered materials were calculated within
state-of-the-art DFT approach and used next as targets to adjust the k.p bands.
The calculated band structure was used to obtain the material gain for bulk
crystals (CsPbCl$_3$, CsPbBr$_3$, CsPbI$_3$, MAPbCl$_3$, MAPbBr$_3$ and
MAPbI$_3$) which is compared with well-established III-V semiconductors. It was
shown that the calculated gain is stronger than for the reference materials
GaAs and InP.

<br>
<br>
We experimentally show that, unlike the solid-solid frictional force, the
solid-liquid retention force is determined by interactions at the triple line
rather than over the solid-liquid contact area, as predicted by theory. We have
prepared drops whose triple line enclosed a uniform surface, a hydrophobic
island, and topographical inhomogeneities, and measured the same retention
force for all three cases. We have also studied the retention force on drops
whose initial triple line was non-circumferential and measured different
retention forces for different shapes, also as predicted by theory. The
experiments with non-circumferential drops provide (1) another way to show that
the retention force is not proportional to the contact area, and (2) a manner
to falsify a recent theory on drop depinning.

<h3>GHP-MOFassemble: Diffusion modeling, high throughput screening, and  molecular dynamics for rational discovery of novel metal-organic frameworks  for carbon capture at scale</h3>

<br>
<br>
We introduce GHP-MOFassemble, a Generative artificial intelligence (AI), High
Performance framework to accelerate the rational design of metal-organic
frameworks (MOFs) with high CO2 capacity and synthesizable linkers. Our
framework combines a diffusion model, a class of generative AI, to generate
novel linkers that are assembled with one of three pre-selected nodes into MOFs
in a primitive cubic (pcu) topology. The CO2 capacities of these AI-generated
MOFs are predicted using a modified version of the crystal graph convolutional
neural network model. We then use the LAMMPS code to perform molecular dynamics
simulations to relax the AI-generated MOF structures, and identify those that
converge to stable structures, and maintain their porous properties throughout
the simulations. Among 120,000 pcu MOF candidates generated by the
GHP-MOFassemble framework, with three distinct metal nodes (Cu paddlewheel, Zn
paddlewheel, Zn tetramer), a total of 102 structures completed molecular
dynamics simulations at 1 bar with predicted CO2 capacity higher than 2 mmol/g
at 0.1 bar, which corresponds to the top 5% of hMOFs in the hypothetical MOF
(hMOF) dataset in the MOFX-DB database. Among these candidates, 18 have change
in density lower than 1% during molecular dynamics simulations, indicating
their stability. We also found that the top five GHP-MOFassemble's MOF
structures have CO2 capacities higher than 96.9% of hMOF structures. This new
approach combines generative AI, graph modeling, large-scale molecular dynamics
simulations, and extreme scale computing to open up new pathways for the
accelerated discovery of novel MOF structures at scale.

<h3>Slope of the upper critical field at $T_{c}$ in two-band superconductors  with non-magnetic disorder: $s_{++}$ superconductivity in  (Ba,K)Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
A recent theory of the non-magnetic disorder-dependent slope of the upper
critical field at the transition temperature, $T_{c}$, is extended to multiband
superconductors aiming at iron-based superconductors where two constant gaps of
different magnitude and, potentially, different signs are considered. The
result shows that there is only a very small domain inside the $s_{\pm}$
pairing state where the slope would increase with the increase of transport
(non-magnetic) scattering rate. In most of the phase space, the slope should
decrease. The experiment, however, shows that at least in BaK122, nonmagnetic
disorder induced by 2.5 MeV electron irradiation results in the increase of the
slope. Considering available information, including literature, we conclude
that BaK122 is most likely an $s_{++}$ superconductor with two gaps of
different magnitudes. This work reopens a decade-long discussion of the nature
of the superconducting order parameter in iron pnictides.

<br>
<br>
Thermoelectric effects are highly sensitive to the asymmetry in the density
of states around the Fermi energy and can be exploited as probes of the
electronic structure. We experimentally study thermopower in high-quality
monolayer graphene, within heterostructures consisting of complete hBN
encapsulation and 1D edge contacts, where the graphene and hBN lattices are
aligned. When graphene is aligned to one of the hBN layers, we demonstrate the
presence of additional sign reversals in the thermopower as a function of
carrier density, directly evidencing the presence of the moir\'e superlattice.
We show that the temperature dependence of the thermopower enables the
assessment of the role of built-in strain variation and van Hove singularities
and hints at the presence of Umklapp electron-electron scattering processes. As
the thermopower peaks around the neutrality point, this allows to probe the
energy spectrum degeneracy. Further, when graphene is double-aligned with the
top and bottom hBN crystals, the thermopower exhibits features evidencing
multiple cloned Dirac points caused by the differential super-moir\'e lattice.
For both cases we evaluate how well the thermopower agrees with Mott's
equation. Finally, we show the same superlattice device can exhibit a
temperature-driven thermopower reversal from positive to negative and vice
versa, by controlling the carrier density. The study of thermopower provides an
alternative approach to study the electronic structure of 2D superlattices,
whilst offering opportunities to engineer the thermoelectric response on these
heterostructures.

<h3>Scale-free switching of polarization in the layered ferroelectric  material CuInP$_2$S$_6$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08714" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08714</a>
<br>
<i>N. Sivadas, Bobby G. Sumpter, P. Ganesh</i>
<br>
<br>
Using first-principles calculations we model the out-of-plane switching of
local dipoles in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ (CIPS) that are largely induced by Cu
off-centering, and where previously a qudrupule-well potential for polarization
switching was claimed. In the supercells considered, we find multiple
structures with similar energies but with different local polar order. Our
results suggest that individual dipoles are weakly coupled in-plane, due to
weak in-plane Cu-Cu interactions, and as such under an electric field at very
low temperatures, these dipoles in CIPS should undergo incoherent disordered
switching, with the barrier for switching determined by the single Cu-ion
switching barrier. This in turn suggests a scale free polarization with a
switching barrier between these metastable structures of $\sim$203.6-258.0
meV/f.u., a factor of at least five smaller than that of HfO$_2$ (1380
meV/f.u.), with strain tunable quadrupule potential energy surface underlying
the switching of each weakly interacting dipole, rather than the macroscopic
polarization itself, as previously hypothesized. These findings reconcile prior
observation of a quadrupule well with measured sloping hysteresis loops, large
ionic conductivity even at 250K that is well below the Curie temperature, as
well as significant wake-up effects where the macroscopic polarization is slow
to order and set-in under an applied electric field. We also find that computed
piezoelectric response and the polarization show a linear dependence on the
local dipolar order which is consistent with having scale-free polarization
(and related properties) and opens doors for engineering large degrees of
metastability by-design in CIPS (and related family of materials) for
neuromorphic applications.

<br>
<br>
Metastable cation-disordered compounds have greatly expanded the
synthesizable compositions of solid-state materials and drawn sharp attention
among battery electrochemists. While such a strategy has been very successful
in a few well-known structures, such as rock salts, metastable
cation-disordered materials for other structural types, especially for
non-close packed structures, are peculiarly underexplored. In this work, we
develop a new series of fully cation-disordered metastable niobium tungsten
oxides with a simple structure, and name this new structural type anti-Li3N.
Furthermore, we find that metastable anti-Li3N NWOs transform to a
cation-disordered cubic structure when applied as a Li-ion battery anode,
highlighting an intriguing non-close packed to close packed conversion between
two cation-disordered phases, as evidenced in various physicochemical
characterizations, in terms of diffraction, electronic, and vibrational
structures. This work enriches the structural and compositional space of
niobium tungsten oxide families, cation-disordered solid-state materials, and
the working mechanisms of Li-ion battery anodes.

<h3>Fano resonances for tilted linear and quadratic band touching  dispersions in a harmonically driven potential well</h3>

<br>
<i>Anton Gregefalk, Annica Black-Schaffer, Tanay Nag</i>
<br>
<br>
Considering models with tilted linear and quadratic band touching
dispersions, we analyze the effect of the transverse linear tilt on the
transmission spectra through a harmonically driven potential well oriented
longitudinally. Employing the Floquet scattering matrix formalism, we find Fano
resonances as an outcome of matching between the Floquet sidebands and
quasi-bound states, where the tilt renormalizes their energies and wave
vectors. We find that the Fano resonance energy decreases (increases) for
linear (quadratic) band touchings as the magnitude of the transverse momentum
increases, indicating a distinct signature of the underlying band dispersion in
the transmission profile. The sign of the product of the transverse momentum
and the tilt also determines the relative shift in the Fano resonance energy
with respect to the untilted case for both band dispersions, suggesting a
possible tunability of the Fano resonance for tilted systems. Importantly, the
tilt strength can also be directly determined by measuring the Fano resonance
energy as function of the transverse momenta direction. We furthermore study
the shot noise spectra and their differential property where we find an
inflection region and undulation, respectively, around the Fano resonance
energy. Interestingly, differential shot noise and transmission spectra both
qualitatively behave in a similar fashion and might thus serve as important
observables for future experiments on driven solid-state systems.

The steady state distribution of the position of a Brownian particle
diffusing in logarithmic-harmonic potential with stochastic resetting is
obtained analytically. We show that there are two critical conditions that

of the logarithmic-harmonic potential in the absence of reset, changes in the
presence of the reset mechanism.

In this letter, we investigate the stable and commensurate van der Waals
heterostructures of metallic and semiconducting $1H$ transition-metal
dichalcogenides, NbS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$ (WSe$_2$), which possess almost the same
lattice constant of the pristine honeycomb structure. In the most stable
structure, the metallic and semiconducting layers are stacked in a similar
manner to $3R$ stacking but the period is a pair of a metallic layer and a
semiconducting layer. The heterostructure aligns the spin-polarization in each
valley among all layers and induces spin-selective charge transfer between the
metallic and semiconducting layers. Especially in hetero-trilayers, the
electronic spin is conserved due to mirror symmetry along the out-of-plane axis
in contrast to the $3R$ stacking structure. A drastic enhancement of spin Hall
effect is numerically shown as an example of electronic spin transport
phenomena in the hetero-trilayers.

Anderson localization transitions are usually referred to as quantum phase
transitions from delocalized states to localized states in disordered systems.
Here we report an unconventional ``Anderson localization transition'' in
two-dimensional quantized quadrupole insulators. Such transitions are from
symmetry-protected topological corner states to disorder-induced normal
Anderson localized states that can be localized in the bulk, as well as at
corners and edges. We show that these localization-localization transitions
(transitions between two different localized states) can happen in both
Hermitian and non-Hermitian quantized quadrupole insulators and investigate
their criticality by finite-size scaling analysis of the corner density. The
scaling analysis suggests that the correlation length of the phase transition,
on the Anderson insulator side and near critical disorder $W_c$, diverges as
$\xi(W)\propto \exp[\alpha/\sqrt{|W-W_c|}]$, a typical feature of
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. A map from the quantized
quadrupole model to the quantum two-dimensional $XY$ model motivates why the
localization-localization transitions are Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type.

<br>
<br>
We report the elastic properties of the Kondo semimetal CeBi by resonant
ultrasound spectroscopy measurements at zero magnetic field. Clear elastic
softening is found in bulk modulus $C_B$ below $\sim 60$ K. Such a softening in
$C_B$, in addition to the anomalous temperature dependence of Poisson's ratio,
is hardly attributable to magnetic transition or multipolar response for stable
localized $4f$ orbital, but can be well described by a two-band model arising
from the hybridization between conduction- and $4f$- electrons. Our results
thus corroborate valence fluctuations in this Kondo semimetal as originally
suggested by a Fermi-surface expansion observed in a previous angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy study.

<br>
<br>
Despite extensive research interests in perovskite oxides, low energy
consumption, non-destructive and maneuverable methods for phase transition in
perovskite oxides are still the under its exploration, and the underlying
mechanisms remain ambiguous. Here, optical susceptibility including electronic
and anharmonic phononic contributions is used to evaluate Gibbs free energy
variations of $\mathrm{PbTiO}_3$ and $\mathrm{BaTiO}_3$ under terahertz
irradiation. This corresponds to an off-resonant light-controlled phase
transition, rather than the resonant approaches that excites hot carriers over
electronic band or infrared-active vibrations in the phonon band. We show that
intermediate terahertz light can trigger polarization change between
ferroelectric orientation variants of $\mathrm{PbTiO}_3$ at room temperature
300 K. Furthermore, the phase transition from low symmetric ferroelectric phase
to high symmetric paraelectric structure in $\mathrm{PbTiO}_3$ can be driven by
changing the direction and intensity of the incident light under the same
conditions. Similar results are observed in $\mathrm{BaTiO}_3$. In detail,
phonon spectrum and optical susceptibility are obviously modified and show
temperature dependence, in which we show the significant effects of anharmonic
vibration. In order to show its nonlinear optical nature, we perform an
alternating electric field dressed ab initio molecular dynamics simulation,
which maps the Raman-active phonon excitation under off-resonant terahertz
irradiation.

Due to its high energy efficiency and environmental friendliness, solid-state
cooling based on the barocaloric (BC) effect represents a promising alternative
to traditional refrigeration technologies relying on greenhouse gases. Plastic
crystals displaying orientational order-disorder solid-solid phase transitions
have emerged among the most gifted materials on which to realize the full
potential of BC solid-state cooling. However, a comprehensive understanding of
the atomistic mechanisms on which order-disorder BC effects are sustained is
still missing, and rigorous and systematic methods for quantitatively
evaluating and anticipating them have not been yet established. Here, we
present a computational approach for the assessment and prediction of BC
effects in orientationally disordered materials that relies on atomistic
molecular dynamics simulations and emulates quasi-direct calorimetric BC
measurements. Remarkably, the proposed computational approach allows for a
precise determination of the partial contributions to the total entropy
stemming from the vibrational and molecular orientational degrees of freedom.
Our BC simulation method is applied on the technologically relevant material
CH$_{3}$NH$_{3}$PbI$_{3}$ (MAPI), finding giant BC isothermal entropy changes
($|\Delta S_{\rm BC}| \sim 10$ J K$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$) under moderate pressure
shifts of $\sim 0.1$ GPa. Intriguingly, our computational analysis of MAPI
reveals that changes in the vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecular
cations, not their reorientational motion, have a major influence on the
entropy change that accompanies the order-disorder solid-solid phase
transition.

The freshly synthesized two-dimensional biphenylene carbon network composed
of a hexagon, a square and an octagonal configuration is a fascinating
structure that attracts attention. In this work, the first principles
calculations have been used to explore the similar biphenylene network of
boron-carbon-nitrogen. There are six possible phases of borocarbonitrides which
are isoelectronic to biphenylene carbon networks with a stoichiometric ratio of
1:1:1 for borons, C, and N atoms. All possible isoelectronic structures of the
BCN combination of biphenylene networks are found to be stable, according to
first principles calculations. The relatively significant number of robust C-C,
B-N bonds and strong partial ionic-covalent B-C and C-N bonds inside these
bpn-BCN monolayers efficiently stabilize in terms of formation energies, phonon
dispersion calculations, mechanical strength ( by elastic moduli) and ab initio
molecular dynamics at finite temperature. The electronic properties reveal the
metallic nature of all bpn-BCN phases. These conducting monolayers might be
advantageous for electrochemical potential, catalytic activity, and hydrogen
evolution processes.

<br>
In this work, the interplay among non-Hermiticity, quasidisorder, and
repulsive interaction is studied for hard-core bosons confined in a
one-dimensional optical lattice, where the non-Hermiticity is induced by the
non-reciprocal hoppings and the on-site gain and loss breaking the
time-reversal symmetry. The energy spectra of the system are fully complex and
the time evolution of the real part of the energy is dynamically stable. By
means of the entanglement entropy and its dynamical evolution, as well as the
inverse participation ratio, the many-body localization (MBL) is found in
playing a key role on the stability of the dynamical behavior. Meanwhile, the
nearest-neighbor level spacings statistics shows the MBL transition accompanied
by the transition from the Ginibre distribution to the complex Poisson
distribution, different from the one in the time-reversal invariant system.
Moreover, the dynamical stability of the real part of the energy and the MBL
transition can be characterized by the winding number. By the scaling exponent
of the entanglement entropy, it is argued that the MBL transition in the
complex energy spectrum system shall belong to a new university class.

In recent years, coherent electrons driven by light fields have attracted
significant interest in exploring novel material phases and functionalities.
However, observing coherent light-field-driven electron dynamics in solids is
challenging because the electrons are scattered within several ten femtoseconds
in ordinary materials, and the coherence between light and electrons is
disturbed. However, when we use Weyl semimetals, the electron scattering
becomes relatively long (several hundred femtoseconds - several picoseconds),
owing to the suppression of the back-scattering process. This study presents
the light-field-driven dynamics by the THz pulse to Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2,
where the intense THz pulse of a monocycle electric field nonlinearly generates
direct current (DC) via coherent acceleration without scattering and
non-adiabatic excitation (Landau-Zener Transition). In other words, the
non-Ohmic current appears in the Weyl semimetal with a combination of the long
relaxation time and an intense THz pulse. This nonlinear DC generation also
demonstrates a Keldysh crossover from a photon picture to a light-field picture
by increasing the electric field strength.

We study the one-dimensional Bak-Sneppen model for the evolution of species
in an ecosystem. Of particular interest are the temporal fluctuations in the
fitness variables. We numerically compute the power spectral density and apply
the finite-size scaling method to get data collapse. A clear signature of
$1/f^{\alpha}$ noise with $\alpha\approx 1.2$ (long-time correlations) emerges
for both local and global (or average) fitness noises. The limiting value 0 or
2 for the spectral exponent corresponds to the no interaction or random
neighbors version model, respectively. The local power spectra are spatially
uncorrelated and also show an additional scaling $\sim 1/L$ in the frequency
regime $L^{-\lambda}\ll f\ll 1/2$, where $L$ is the linear extent of the
system.

The orbital, which represents the shape of the electron cloud, very often
strongly influences the manifestation of various exotic phenomena, e.g.,
magnetism, metal-insulator transition, colossal magnetoresistance,
unconventional superconductivity etc. in solid-state systems. The observation
of the antiferromagnetism in $RE$TiO$_3$ ($RE$=rare earth) series has been
puzzling since the celebrated Kugel-Khomskii model of spin-orbital super
exchange predicts ferromagnetism in an orbitally degenerate $d^1$ systems.
Further, the existence of the orbitally ordered vs. orbital liquid phase in
both antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phase have been unsettled issues thus
far. To address these long-standing questions, we investigate single
crystalline film of PrTiO$_3$. Our synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements
confirm the retention of bulk-like orthorhombic ($D_{2h}$) symmetry in the thin
film geometry. We observe similar X-ray linear dichroism signal in both
paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phase, which can be accounted by ferro
orbital ordering (FOO). While the presence of $D_{2h}$ crystal field does not
guarantee lifting of orbital degeneracy always, we find it to be strong enough
in these rare-earth titanates, leading to the FOO state. Thus, our work
demonstrates the orthorhombic distortion is the driving force for the orbital
ordering of antiferromagnetic $RE$TiO$_3$.

Hamiltonian. In this letter, we propose a non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE)
enforced by nonsymmorphic symmetries. We show that the
nonsymmorphic-symmetry-enforced NHSE inevitably occurs if a two-dimensional
non-Hermitian system satisfies certain conditions characterized by
nonsymmorphic symmetries. This NHSE can occur even in the presence of
time-reversal symmetry. The nonsymmorphic-symmetry-enforced NHSE always occurs
simultaneously with the closing of the point gap at zero energy. We also show
that such a NHSE can occur in specific three-dimensional space groups with
nonsymmorphic symmetries.

A novel carbon allotrope, hexagonal C12, is proposed from crystal chemistry
and quantum density functional theory DFT calculations of ground state and
physical properties. The structure exhibits corner sharing distorted tetrahedra
with the presence of C3 triangular cyclopropane-like moiety connecting planar
carbon. C12 allotrope is found cohesive and stable both mechanically (elastic
constants and their combinations) and dynamically -- phonons band structures --
and presents ultra-hardness with Vickers number of 70 GPa. The temperature
dependence of the heat capacity CV shows close magnitudes to experimental
results of diamond. The electronic band structure reveals closely insulating
behavior with 2.5 eV band gap, half smaller than in diamond.

Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides are among the most promising
materials for water-splitting catalysts. While a variety of methods have been
applied to promote the hydrogen evolution reaction on the transition metal
dichalcogenides, doping of transition metal heteroatoms have attracted much
attention since it provides effective ways to optimize the hydrogen adsorption
and H2 generation reactions. Herein, we provide in-depth and systematic
analyses on the trends of the free energy of hydrogen adsorption ({\Delta}GH*),
the most well-known descriptor for evaluating hydrogen evolution reaction
performance, in the doped transition metal dichalcogenides. Using the total 150
doped transition metal dichalcogenides, we carried out the atom-level analysis
on the origin of {\Delta}GH* changes upon the transition metal heteroatom
doping, and suggest two key factors that govern the hydrogen adsorption process
on the doped transition metal dichalcogenides: 1) the changes in the charge of
chalcogen atoms where hydrogen atoms adsorbed for the early transition metal
doped structures, and 2) the structural deformation energies accompanying in
introduced dopants for the late transition metal doped structures. Based on our
findings, we interpret from a new perspective how vacancies in the TM-doped
TMDs can provide optimal {\Delta}GH* in HER. We suggest electrostatic control
for early TM doped systems and structural control for late TM doped systems as
the effective strategies for the thermoneutral {\Delta}GH* in TMD.

In the fundamental understanding of magnetic interactions between atoms in
solids, the crystal lattice is one of the key parameters. As the effective tool
for controlling the lattice using tensile stress is limited, there are only few
demonstrations of the control in magnetic properties with expanding the lattice
structure. Here, we observe that the Curie temperature (Tc) of quasi
two-dimensional Cr2Ge2Te6 with NiO overlayer doubles from ~60 K to ~120 K,
describe a clear correlation of magnetic properties with lattice expansion,
which is characterized by several probes and computational approaches, and
address on the mechanisms leading to the increase in Tc via the change in
exchange interactions.

This work finds its place in the statistical mechanical approach to light
amplification in disordered media, namely Random Lasers (RLs). The problem of
going beyond the standard mean-field Replica Symmetry Breaking (RSB) theory
employed to find the solution of spin-glass models for RLs is addressed,
improving the theory towards a more realistic description of these optical
systems. The leading model of the glassy lasing transition is considered: the
Mode-Locked (ML) 4 phasor model. This is a complex spherical 4-spin model, with
a deterministic selection rule, affecting the coupling of the electromagnetic
field modes. The model is investigated with both numerical and analytical
techniques.

We report two non-degenerate magnon modes with opposite spin in
antiferromagnetic insulators which arises from the symmetry-determined
anisotropic exchange coupling. The giant spin splitting contributes to spin
Seebeck and spin Nernst effects with a very efficient generation of
longitudinal and transverse spin currents when the temperature gradient
direction lies along and deviates from the main crystal axis, respectively,
without any external magnetic field and Berry curvature. Based on
first-principles calculations, we predict feasible material candidates holding
robust altermagnetic spin configurations and room-temperature structural
stability to realize spin thermal transport.

<h3>Roughness evolution induced by third-body wear</h3>

<br>
<br>
Surface roughness is a key factor when it comes to friction and wear, as well
as to other physical properties. These phenomena are controlled by mechanisms
acting at small scales, in which the topography of apparently-flat surfaces is
revealed. Roughness in natural surfaces has been reported to conform to
self-affine statistics in a wide variety of settings (ranging from earthquake
physics to micro-electro-mechanical devices), meaning that the height profile
can be described using a spectrum where the amplitude is proportional to its
wavelength raised to a constant power, which is related to a statistical
parameter named Hurst exponent. We analyze the roughness evolution in atomistic
surfaces during molecular dynamics simulations of wear. Both pairs of
initially-flat and initially-rough surfaces in contact are worn by a third body
formed by particles trapped between them during relative sliding. During the
first sliding stages, the particles trapped between the first bodies scratch
the surfaces. Once the former become coated with atoms from the latter, the
wear process slows down and becomes "adhesive-like". The initial particle sizes
are consistent with the minimum size to be expected for the debris, but tend to
grow by material removal from the surfaces and to agglomerate. We show that,
for the particular configurations under consideration, the surface roughness
seems to converge to a steady state characterized by Hurst exponent close to
0.8, independently of the initial conditions.

<h3>Generation and modulation of multiple 2D bulk photovoltaic effects in  space-time reversal asymmetric 2H-FeCl2</h3>

The two-dimensional (2D) bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) is a cornerstone for
future highly efficient 2D solar cells and optoelectronics. The ferromagnetic
semiconductor 2H-FeCl2 is shown to realize a new type of BPVE in which spatial
inversion (P), time reversal (T), and space-time reversal (PT) symmetries are
broken (PT-broken). Using density functional theory and perturbation theory, we
show that 2H-FeCl2 exhibits giant photocurrents, photo-spin-currents, and
photo-orbital-currents under illumination by linearly polarized light. The
injection-like and shift-like photocurrents coexist and propagate in different
directions. The material also demonstrates substantial photoconductance,
photo-spin-conductance, and photo-orbital-conductance, with magnitudes up to
4650 (nm{\cdot}{\mu}A/V2), 4620 (nm{\cdot}{\mu}A/V2 {\hbar}/2e), and 6450
(nm{\cdot}{\mu}A/V2 {\hbar}/e), respectively. Furthermore, the
injection-currents, shift-spin-currents, and shift-orbital-currents can be
readily switched via rotating the magnetizations of 2H-FeCl2. These results
demonstrate the superior performance and intriguing control of a new type of
BPVE in 2H-FeCl2.

A long operational lifetime is required for the use of solar cells in
real-life photovoltaic applications. The optimization of operational lifetimes
is achieved through understanding the inherent degradation phenomena in solar
cells. In this study, graphene/Si Schottky-junction solar cells were produced,
utilizing liquid-phase-exfoliated graphene as an active surface. The
operational and interface stability of these solar cells over a period of 5
years in ambient conditions (following ISOS-D protocols: dark storage/shelf
life) was examined, and the origin of their degradation was reported. It was
found that the dominant degradation mechanism could be attributed to the
degradation of silver contacts. This was indicated by a decrease in shunt
resistance, an increase in the ideality factor (due to a higher carrier
recombination), and a constant defect density in graphene films for up to 4
years. Measurements across the solar cell's active area during the 5-year
period revealed neither significant spatial inhomogeneity, nor shunt channel
defects.

<h3>Heterogeneity can markedly increase final outbreak size in the SIR model  of epidemics</h3>

<br>

We study the SIR model of epidemics on positively correlated heterogeneous
networks with population variability, and explore the dependence of the final
outbreak size on the network heterogeneity strength and basic reproduction
number $R_0$ -- the ratio between the infection and recovery rates per
individual. We reveal a critical value $R_0^c$, above which the maximal
outbreak size is obtained at zero heterogeneity, but below which, the maximum
is obtained at finite heterogeneity strength. This second-order phase
transition, universal for all network distributions with finite standardized
moments indicates that, network heterogeneity can greatly increase the final
outbreak size. We also show that this effect can be enhanced by adding
population heterogeneity, in the form of varying inter-individual
susceptibility and infectiousness. Notably, our results provide key insight as
to the predictability of the well-mixed SIR model for the final outbreak size,
in realistic scenarios.

<h3>Localization transitions in non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattice</h3>

The delocalization-localization (DL) transition in non-Hermitian systems
exhibits intriguing features distinct from their Hermitian counterparts. In
this study, we investigate the DL transition in a generalized non-Hermitian
lattice with asymmetric hopping and complex quasi-periodic potential.
Irrespective of the boundary conditions, the lattice undergoes a DL transition
at a critical strength of the quasiperiodic potential with identical modulation
of its real and complex parts. For periodic boundary conditions (PBC), we
obtained an analytical expression that accurately predicts this critical point.
Our numerical results indicate that the critical point remains the same with
the open boundary condition (OBC) as well. Interestingly, we observe that a
difference in the modulation of the real and the complex part of potential
leads to a mixed phase that appears between the delocalized and the localized
phases. Intriguingly, within the mixed state region, we observed a coexistence
of skin modes and localized states in the case of OBC, while in the case of
PBC, a mixed phase is created by a coexistence of delocalized and localized
states. We mapped out the phase diagrams for different scenarios offering
valuable insights into the role of different parameters in a wide class of
non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattices.

<br>
<br>
The corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) algorithm has been
extensively used to investigate both classical and quantum two-dimensional (2D)
lattice models. The convergence of the algorithm can strongly vary from model
to model depending on the underlying geometry and symmetries, and the presence
of algebraic correlations. An important factor in the convergence of the
algorithm is the lattice symmetry, which can be broken due to the necessity of
mapping the problem onto the square lattice. We propose a variant of the CTMRG
algorithm, designed for models with $C_3$-symmetry, which we apply to the
conceptually simple yet numerically challenging problem of the triangular
lattice Ising antiferromagnet in a field, at zero and low temperatures. We
study how the finite-temperature three-state Potts critical line in this model
approaches the ground-state Kosterlitz-Thouless transition driven by a reduced
field ($h/T$). In this particular instance, we show that the $C_3$-symmetric
CTMRG leads to much more precise results than both existing results from exact
diagonalization of transfer matrices and Monte Carlo.

We present a method, based on the classical Green-Kubo theory of linear
response, to compute the heat conductivity of extended systems, leveraging
energy-density, rather than energy-current, fluctuations, thus avoiding the
need to devise an analytical expression for the macroscopic energy flux. The
implementation of this method requires the evaluation of the long-wavelength
and low-frequency limits of a suitably defined correlation function, which we
perform using a combination of recently-introduced cepstral-analysis and
Bayesian extrapolation techniques. Our methodology is demonstrated against
standard current-based Green-Kubo results for liquid argon and water, and
compared with a recently proposed similar technique, which utilizes
mass-density, instead of energy-density, fluctuations.

<br>
<br>
Important properties of complex quantum many-body systems and their phase
diagrams can often already be inferred from the impurity limit. The Bose
polaron problem describing an impurity atom immersed in a Bose-Einstein
condensate is a paradigmatic example. One of the most interesting features of
this model is the competition between the emergent impurity-mediated attraction
between the bosons and their intrinsic repulsion. The arising higher-order
correlations make the physics rich and interesting, but also complex to
describe theoretically. To tackle this challenge, we develop a quantum
chemistry-inspired computational technique and compare two state-of-the-art
variational methods that fully include both the boson-impurity and boson-boson
interactions on a non-perturbative level. For a sweep of the boson-impurity
interaction strength, we find two regimes of qualitatively different behaviour.
If the impurity-mediated interactions overcome the repulsion between the
bosons, the polaron becomes unstable due to the formation of large bound
clusters. If instead the interboson interactions dominate, the impurity will
experience a crossover from a polaron into a small molecule. We achieve a
unified understanding incorporating both of these regimes and the transition
between them. We show that both the instability and crossover regime can be
studied in realistic cold-atom experiments. Moreover, we develop a simple
analytical model that allows us to interpret these phenomena in the typical
Landau framework of first-order phase transitions that turn second-order at a
critical endpoint, revealing a deep connection of the Bose polaron model to
both few- and many-body physics.

Identifying the full entropy production of active particles is a challenging
task. We introduce a microscopic, thermodynamically consistent model, which
leads to active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck statistics in the continuum limit. Our
minimal model consists of a particle with a fluctuating number of active
reaction sites which contribute to its active self-propulsion on a lattice. In
addition, the model also takes ordinary thermal noise into account. This
approach allows us to identify the full entropy production stemming from both
thermal diffusion and active driving. Extant methods based on the comparison of
forward and time-reversed trajectory underestimate the physical entropy
production when applied to the Langevin equations obtained from our model.
Constructing microscopic Markovian models can thus provide a benchmark for
determining the entropy production in non-Markovian active systems.

Electronic devices that work in the quantum regime often employ hybrid
nanostructures to bring about a nonlinear behaviour. The nonlinearity that
these can provide has proven to be useful, in particular, for applications in
quantum computation. Here we present a hybrid device that acts as a capacitor
with a nonlinear charge-voltage relation. The device consists of a nanowire
placed between the plates of a coplanar capacitor, with a co-parallel
alignment. At low temperatures, due to the finite density of states on the
nanowire, the charge distribution in the capacitor is uneven and
energy-dependent, resulting in a charge-dependent effective capacitance. We
study this system analytically and numerically, and show that the nonlinearity
of the capacitance is significant enough to be utilized in circuit quantum
electrodynamics. The resulting nonlinearity can be switched on, modulated and
switched off by an external potential, thus making this capacitive device
highly versatile for uses in quantum computation.

<h3>Effect of anisotropic impurity scattering in d-wave superconductors</h3>

<br>
<br>
In d$_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductors, the effect of s-wave point disorder
has been extensively studied in the literature. In this work, we study the
anisotropic disorder with a the form of $V_{kk'}^{\rm imp}=V_if_kf_{k'}$ with
$f_k=\cos(2\theta)$ (with $\theta$ the azimuthal angle of $k$), as proposed to
be caused by apical oxygen vacancies in overdoped La-based cuprate films, under
the Born approximation. The disorder self-energy and d-wave pairing affect each
other and have to be solved simultaneously self-consistently. We find the
self-energy is reduced at low frequencies and thus weakens the pair-breaking
effect. This frequency-dependence vanishes in the dirty limit for which the
disorder is well described by a scattering rate $\Gamma_k=\Gamma_if_k^2$. One
consequence of the disorder effect is the gap-to-$T_c$ ratio $2\Delta(0)/T_c$
is greatly enhanced by the d-wave disorder, much larger than the s-wave
disorder and the clean BCS value $4.28$. At last, we generalize the d-wave
scattering rate to a general form
$\Gamma_\theta=\Gamma_\alpha|\theta-\theta_0|^\alpha$ around each nodal
direction $\theta_0$. We find the density of states
$\rho(\omega)-\rho(0)\propto|\omega|$ ($\omega^2$) for all $\alpha\ge1$
($\alpha<1$) in the limit of $\omega\to0$. As a result, the superfluid density
$\rho_s$ exhibits two and only two possible scaling behaviors:
$\rho_s(0)-\rho_s(T)\propto T$ ($T^2$) for $\alpha\ge1$ ($\alpha<1$) in the low
temperature limit.

We study the generation of collective orbital modes, their evolution, and the
characteristic non-linear optical response induced by them in a photoinduced
orbital-ordered correlated oxide using real-time simulations based on an
interacting multiband tight-binding (TB) model. The d-d optical transitions
under femtoseconds light-pulse in a orbital-ordered state excite collective
orbital modes, also known as "orbitons". The consistent inclusion of electronic
interactions and the coupling between charge, spin, and lattice degrees of
freedom in the TB-model provide a better understanding of the underlying
mechanisms of the collective orbital modes. The dynamics of Jahn-Teller
vibrational modes in the photoinduced state modify the intersite orbital
interaction, which further amplifies these orbital modes. In the presence of
weak ferroelectricity, the excitation of collective orbital modes induces a
strong THz oscillatory photocurrent which is long-lived. This suggests an
alternative way to experimentally detect quasiparticles describing such
collective modes through THz-emission studies in the photoinduced state. Our
study also elucidates that quasiparticle dynamics in improper ferroelectric
oxides can be exploited to achieve highly interesting and non-trivial
optoelectronic properties.

Molecular dynamics (MD) enables the study of physical systems with excellent
spatiotemporal resolution but suffers from severe time-scale limitations. To
address this, enhanced sampling methods have been developed to improve
exploration of configurational space. However, implementing these is
challenging and requires domain expertise. In recent years, integration of
machine learning (ML) techniques in different domains has shown promise,
prompting their adoption in enhanced sampling as well. Although ML is often
employed in various fields primarily due to its data-driven nature, its
integration with enhanced sampling is more natural with many common underlying
synergies. This review explores the merging of ML and enhanced MD by presenting
different shared viewpoints. It offers a comprehensive overview of this rapidly
evolving field, which can be difficult to stay updated on. We highlight
successful strategies like dimensionality reduction, reinforcement learning,
and flow-based methods. Finally, we discuss open problems at the exciting
ML-enhanced MD interface.

We propose a universal spin superconducting diode effect (SDE) induced by
spin-orbit coupling (SOC), where the critical spin supercurrents in opposite
directions are unequal. By analysis from both the Ginzburg-Landau theory and
energy band analysis, we show that the spin-$\uparrow \uparrow$ and
spin-$\downarrow \downarrow$ Cooper pairs possess opposite phase gradients and
opposite momenta from the SOC, which leads to the spin SDE. Two superconductors
with SOC, a $p$-wave superconductor as a toy model and a practical
superconducting nanowire, are numerically studied and they both exhibit spin
SDE. In addition, our theory also provides a unified picture for both spin and
charge SDEs. Besides, we propose spin-polarized detection and nonlocal spin
transport, as mature experimental technologies, to confirm the spin SDE in
superconducting nanowires.

<h3>Quantum Potts chain in alternating field</h3>

The $q$-state Potts chain with ferromagnetic couplings, $J=1$, in the
presence of a transverse field, $\Gamma$, has a quantum phase transition at
$\Gamma/q=1$, which is continuous for $q \le 4$ and of first order for $q>4$.
Here we introduce a $q$-periodic alternating longitudinal field of strength,
$h$, and study the phase diagram and the critical properties of the model. For
$h<q/(q-1)$ there is a ferromagnetic ordered phase, for $\Gamma<\Gamma_c(h)$
and at $h=q/(q-1)$ there is a classical endpoint at $\Gamma=0$, with finite
entropy at $T=0$. We considered the $q=3$ model and using DMRG techniques we
calculated the low-laying spectrum of the Hamiltonian, the transverse
magnetisation and the spin-spin correlation function, all of which signalled a
diverging correlation length at the transition point with the exponent of the
three-state Potts model. In the vicinity of the classical endpoint the model is
mapped to a quantum hard rod model, which belongs also to the universality
class of the three-state Potts model. Also the spectrum of the critical
Hamiltonian is found in agreement with conformal invariance. At the same time
the correlation function shows a jump at the transition point, thus the
transition is of mixed order for $h<q/(q-1)$.

<br>
The Kitaev-type spin chains have been demonstrated to be fertile playgrounds
in which exotic phases and unconventional phase transitions are ready to
appear. In this work, we use the density-matrix renormalization group method to
study the quantum phase diagram of a spin-1 Kitaev chain with a tunable
negative single-ion anisotropy (SIA). When the strength of the SIA is small,
the ground state is revealed to be a spin-nematic phase which escapes
conventional magnetic order but is characterized by a finite spin-nematic
correlation because of the breaking spin-rotational symmetry. As the SIA
increases, the spin-nematic phase is taken over by either a dimerized phase or
an antiferromagnetic phase through an Ising-type phase transition, depending on
the direction of the easy axis. For large enough SIA, the dimerized phase and
the antiferromagnetic phase undergo a ``Landau-forbidden" continuous phase
transition, suggesting new platform of deconfined quantum critical point in
spin-1 Kitaev chain.

<h3>Depinning transition of self-propelled particles</h3>

<br>
<i>Arthur V. Straube, Felix Höfling</i>
<br>
<br>
A depinning transition is observed in a variety of contexts when a certain
threshold force must be applied to drive a system out of an immobile state. A
well-studied example is the depinning of colloidal particles from a corrugated
landscape, whereas its active-matter analogue has remained unexplored. We
discuss how active noise due to self-propulsion impacts the nature of the
transition: it causes a change of the critical exponent from 1/2 for quickly
reorienting particles to 3/2 for slowly reorienting ones. In between these
analytically tractable limits, the drift velocity exhibits a superexponential
behavior as is corroborated by high-precision data. Giant diffusion phenomena
occur in the two different regimes. Our predictions appear amenable to
experimental tests, lay foundations for insight into the depinning of
collective variables in active matter, and are relevant for any system with a
saddle-node bifurcation in the presence of a bounded noise.

White light emitting diodes are gaining popularity and are set to become the
most common light source in the US by 2025. Their performance is still limited
by the lack of an efficient red-emitting component with narrow band emission.
The red phosphor SrLiAl$_3$N$_4$:Eu$^{2+}$ is among the first promising
phosphors with small bandwidth for the next-generation lighting but the
microscopic origin of this narrow emission remains elusive. In the present
work, density functional theory, the $\Delta$SCF-constrained occupation method,
and a generalized Huang-Rhys theory are used to provide an accurate description
of the vibronic processes occurring at the two Sr$^{2+}$ sites that the
Eu$^{2+}$ activator can occupy. The emission bandshape of Eu(Sr1), with a
zero-phonon line at 1.906 eV and high luminescence intensity, is shown to be
controlled by the coupling between the 5d$_{z^2}$-4f electronic transition and
the low-frequency phonon modes associated to Sr and Eu displacements along the
Sr channel. The good agreement between our computations and experimental
results allows us to provide a structural assignment of the observed total
spectrum. By computing explicitly the effect of the thermal expansion on
zero-phonon line energies, the agreement is extended to the
temperature-dependent spectrum. These results provide insights into the
electron-phonon coupling accompanying the 5d-4f transition in similar
UCr$_4$C$_4$-type phosphors: they highlight the importance of the Sr channel in
shaping the narrow emission of SrLiAl$_3$N$_4$:Eu$^{2+}$, and shed new light
into the structure-property relations of such phosphors.

The physics of micron-scale biological colonies usually benefits from
different out-of-equilibrium sources. In bacterial colonies and cellular
tissues, the growth process is among the important active sources that
determine the dynamics. In this article, we study the generic dynamical
instabilities associated with the growth phenomena that may arise in both
scalar and vectorial systems. In vectorial systems, where the rotational
degrees of particles play a role, a phenomenological growthmediated torque can
affect the rotational dynamics of individual particles. We show that such a
growth-mediated torque can result in active traveling waves in the bulk of a
growing system. In addition to the bulk properties, we analyze the
instabilities in the shape of growing interfaces in both scalar and vectorial
systems.

At low injection or low temperatures, electron transport in disordered
semiconductors is dominated by phonon-assisted hopping between localized
states. A very popular approach to this hopping transport is the
Miller-Abrahams model that requires a set of empirical parameters to define the
hopping rates and the preferential paths between the states. We present here a
transport model based on the localization landscape (LL) theory in which the
location of the localized states, their energies, and the coupling between them
are computed for any specific realization, accounting for its particular
geometry and structure. This model unveils the transport network followed by
the charge carriers that essentially consists in the geodesics of a metric
deduced from the LL. The hopping rates and mobility are computed on a
paradigmatic example of disordered semiconductor, and compared with the
prediction from the actual solution of the Schr\"odinger equation. We explore
the temperature-dependency for various disorder strengths and demonstrate the
applicability of the LL theory in efficiently modeling hopping transport in
disordered systems.

<h3>Growth kinetics and substrate stability during high-temperature  molecular beam epitaxy of AlN nanowires</h3>

We study the molecular beam epitaxy of AlN nanowires between 950 and 1215
{\deg}C, well above the usual growth temperatures, to identify optimal growth
conditions. The nanowires are grown by self-assembly on TiN(111) films
sputtered onto Al$_2$O$_3$. Above 1100 {\deg}C, the TiN film is seen to undergo
grain growth and its surface exhibits {111} facets where AlN nucleation
preferentially occurs. Modelling of the nanowire elongation rate measured at
different temperatures shows that the Al adatom diffusion length is maximised
at 1150 {\deg}C, which appears to be the optimum growth temperature. However,
analysis of the nanowire luminescence shows a steep increase in the deep-level
signal already above 1050 {\deg}C, associated with O incorporation from the
Al$_2$O$_3$ substrate. Comparison with AlN nanowires grown on Si, MgO and SiC
substrates suggests that heavy doping of Si and O by interdiffusion from the
TiN/substrate interface increases the nanowire internal quantum efficiency,
presumably due to the formation of a SiN$_x$ or AlO$_x$ passivation shell. The
outdiffusion of Si and O would also cause the formation of the inversion
domains observed in the nanowires. It follows that for optoelectronic and
piezoelectric applications, optimal AlN nanowire ensembles should be prepared
at 1150 {\deg}C on TiN/SiC substrates and will require an ex situ surface
passivation.

Sensors based on spin qubits in 2D crystals offer the prospect of nanoscale
sensing volumes, where the close proximity of the sensor and source could
provide access to otherwise inaccessible signals. For AC magnetometry, the
sensitivity and frequency range is typically limited by the noise spectrum,
which determines the qubit coherence time. This poses a problem for III-V
materials, as the non-zero spin of the host nuclei introduces a considerable
source of magnetic noise. Here, we overcome this with a sensing protocol based
on phase modulated continuous concatenated dynamic decoupling, which extends
the coherence time towards the $T_1$ limit at room temperature and enables
tuneable narrowband AC magnetometry. We demonstrate the protocol with an
ensemble of negatively charged boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride,
detecting in-plane AC fields within $\pm 150~\mathrm{MHz}$ of the electron spin
resonance, and out-of-plane fields in the range of $\sim10-150~\mathrm{MHz}$.
We measure an AC magnetic field sensitivity of $\sim1~\mathrm{\mu T/\sqrt{Hz}}$
at $\sim2.5~\mathrm{GHz}$, for a sensor volume of $\sim0.1~\mathrm{\mu m^3}$,
and demonstrate that the sensor can reconstruct the AC magnetic field from a
wire loop antenna. This work establishes the viability of spin defects in 2D
materials for high frequency magnetometry, demonstrating sensitivities that are
comparable to nitrogen vacancy centres in diamond for microscopic sensing
volumes, and with wide-ranging applications across science and technology.

The relation between spontaneous and stimulated brain activity is a
fundamental question in neuroscience, which has received wide attention in
experimental studies. Recently, it has been suggested that the evoked response
to external stimuli can be predicted from temporal correlations of spontaneous
activity. Previous theoretical results, confirmed by the comparison with MEG
data for human brains, were obtained for the Wilson-Cowan model in the
condition of balance of excitation and inhibition, signature of a healthy
brain. Here we extend previous studies to imbalanced conditions, by examining a
region of parameter space around the balanced fixed point. Analytical results
are compared to numerical simulations of Wilson-Cowan networks. We evidence
that in imbalance conditions the functional form of the time correlation and
response functions can show several behaviors, exhibiting also an oscillating
regime caused by the emergence of complex eigenvalues. The analytical
predictions are fully in agreement with numerical simulations, validating the
role of cross-correlations in the response function. Furthermore, we identify
the leading role of inhibitory neurons in controlling the overall activity of
the system, tuning the level of excitability and imbalance.

The work of this thesis concerns the problem of linear low energy excitations
of vector spin glass models. An analytical and numerical study is carried out,
considering a fully connected random-field Heisenberg model at zero
temperature, a fully-connected vector p-spin glass model and a sparse
random-field Heisenberg model. We test these models against the low temperature
behavior of finite dimensional glassy systems, in particular we show that they
posses phases where the density of states is gapless with quasi-localised
modes. In the case of the sparse model, we show that the density of states
follows a quartic law at low frequency, consistently with several recent
measures of this quantity that can be found in the literature of computer
glasses. In all the three models, the spin glass transition is characterised in
terms of the behavior of the softest excitations. We found that in the fully
connected models the zero temperature spin glass transition in a field is a
delocalisation transition of the softest modes. In the sparse case, a weaker
form of delocalisation appears at the transition. These results broaden our
understanding of the zero temperature critical point, by showing how spin glass
ordering affects the way the system responds to small magnetic perturbations.

Nonreciprocal gyrotropic materials have attracted significant interest
recently in material physics, nanophotonics, and topological physics. Most of
the well-known nonreciprocal materials, however, only show nonreciprocity under
a strong external magnetic field and within a small segment of the
electromagnetic spectrum. Here, through first-principles density functional
theory calculations, we show that due to strong spin-orbit coupling
manganese-bismuth (MnBi) exhibits nonreciprocity without any external magnetic
field and a large gyrotropy in a broadband long-wavelength infrared regime
(LWIR). Further, we design a multi-layer structure based on MnBi to obtain a
maximum degree of spin-polarized thermal emission at 7 $\mu$m. The connection
established here between large gyrotropy and the spin-polarized thermal
emission points to a potential use of MnBi to develop spin-controlled thermal
photonics platforms.

<h3>Nonequilibrium thermodynamics of the majority vote model</h3>

The majority vote model is one of the simplest opinion systems yielding
distinct phase transitions and has garnered significant interest in recent
years. However, its original formulation is not, in general, thermodynamically
consistent, precluding the achievement of quantities such as power and heat, as
well as their behaviors at phase transition regimes. Here, we circumvent this
limitation by introducing the idea of a distinct heat bath per local
configuration, in such a way that each neighborhood value is associated with a
distinct and well-defined thermal bath. Thermodynamic properties are derived
for a generic majority vote model, irrespective of its neighborhood and lattice
topology. The behavior of energy/heat fluxes at phase transitions, whether
continuous or discontinuous, in regular and complex topologies, is investigated
in detail. Unraveling the contribution of each local configuration explains the
nature of the phase diagram and reveals how dissipation arises from the
dynamics.

<h3>Potential and Feshbach $s$-wave resonances in coupled atomic collision  channels</h3>

We discuss $s$-wave scattering in an atomic binary collision with two coupled
channels, tunable by an external magnetic field, one channel open and the other
closed for the incident energies considered. The analysis is performed with a
stylized model of square-well potentials. This simplification allows for a
pedagogically thorough discussion of the different scattering resonances that
appear in coupled channels. One of the them, the potential resonances at
vanishing energy, occur as a bound state of the coupled system emerges, in
turned tuned at a very precise value of the external field. The other
resonances, described by Feshbach theory, occur when the incident energy is
near a bound state of the closed channel, as if it were decoupled from the open
channel. These resonances exist for values of the external field above a
particular threshold value. Besides the potential intrinsic value of this study
in a quantum mechanics course, as the analysis can be performed with minor
numerical calculations, it is also an aid for the understanding of current
research advances in the exciting field of ultracold gases.

We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of non-interacting atoms confined
within a one-dimensional harmonic trap triggered by dragging an external
long-range potential through the system. The symmetry-breaking nature of this
moving potential leads to trap-induced shape resonances (TISR) between adjacent
eigenstates in the atoms' effective potential. We propose to exploit the TISR
to selectively excite the atoms into higher vibrational states of the harmonic
trap by controlling the motion of the dragged potential. To this end, we
consider two protocols designs: the first protocol strives to maintain
adiabaticity at critical points during the atoms' dynamics, whilst the second
protocol utilises the fast tunnelling of the atoms within their effective
double-well potential. These protocols take place in the few to many
millisecond regime and achieve high-fidelity excitation of the atoms into pure
vibrational states and superpositions thereof. Overall, our study highlights
the significance of TISR in controlling and manipulating atom dynamics and
offers intuitive protocols for achieving desired excitations.

The Berry curvature and quantum metric are the imaginary part and real part,
respectively, of the quantum geometric tensor which characterizes the topology
of quantum states. The former is known to generate a zoo of important
discoveries such as quantum Hall effect and anomalous Hall effect (AHE), while
the consequences of the quantum metric have rarely been probed by transport. In
this work, we observed quantum metric induced nonlinear transport, including
both nonlinear AHE and diode-like nonreciprocal longitudinal response, in thin
films of a topological antiferromagnet, MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Our observation reveals
that the transverse and longitudinal nonlinear conductivities reverse signs
when reversing the antiferromagnetic order, diminish above the N\'eel
temperature, and are insensitive to disorder scattering, thus verifying their
origin in the band structure topology. They also flip signs between electron
and hole-doped regions, in agreement with theoretical calculations. Our work
provides a pathway to probe the quantum metric through nonlinear transport and
to design magnetic nonlinear devices.

We have performed a comprehensive, first-principles high-throughput study of
the magnetic properties of halide double perovskites, $Cs_2BB^\prime Cl_6$,
with magnetic ions occupying one or both B and B$^\prime$ sites. Our findings
indicate a general tendency for these materials to exhibit antiferromagnetic
ordering with low N\'eel temperatures. At the same time, we reveal a few
potential candidates that predicted to be ferromagnetic with relatively high
Curie temperatures. Achieving ferromagnetic coupling might be feasible via
simultaneously alloying at B and B$^\prime$ sites with magnetic 3d and
non-magnetic 5d ions. With this approach, we discover that $Cs_2HgCrCl_6$,
$Cs_2AgNiCl_6$ and $Cs_2AuNiCl_6$ have high Curie temperatures relative to
their peers, with the latter two exhibiting half metallic behaviour. Further,
this study illuminates the underpinning mechanism of magnetic exchange
interactions in halide double perovskites, enabling a deeper understanding of
their magnetic behaviour. Our findings, especially the discovery of the
compounds with robust half-metallic properties and high Curie temperatures
holds promise for potential applications in the field of spintronics.

<h3>Interacting bosons on a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger ladder: Topological phases  and Thouless pumping</h3>

We study the topological properties of hardcore bosons on a two-leg ladder
consisting of two Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains that are coupled via
hopping and interaction. We chart out the phase diagram for the system and show
that based on the relative hopping dimerization pattern along the legs,
distinctly different topological phases and phase transitions can occur. When
the dimerization along the legs are uniform, we find that the topological
nature vanishes for even the slightest rung hopping. For staggered
dimerization, the system exhibits a well defined topological character and a
topological phase transition as a function of rung hopping. While the
topological phase shows bond order character, the trivial phase shows the
behavior of a rung-Mott insulator. For this case, the topological nature is
found to survive even in the presence of finite inter-leg interactions.
Moreover, we find that the critical point of the topological phase transition
shifts to a higher or a lower rung hopping strength depending on the attractive
or repulsive nature of the interaction. To highlight the marked effects of
interactions, we propose a scheme involving a Thouless charge pump that
provides insights for the topological phases characterized by a quantised
particle transport through a periodic modulation of appropriate system
parameters. In our studies, we show an interaction induced charge pumping
following specific pumping protocols in the case of staggered dimerization.
