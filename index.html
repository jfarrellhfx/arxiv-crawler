<p>Hydrodynamics, as an effective theory capturing long-wavelength and late-time
dynamics around thermal equilibrium states, finds applications in diverse
physical systems, ranging from electron flow in metals, to ocean wave
propagation, traffic flow, bacterial motion and the quark-gluon plasma. On the
other hand, non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), characterized by a stationary
flow of energy or matter in the presence of a driving force, are pervasive in
nature but they present significant challenges to the foundational principles
of statistical physics, as it is generally unclear if and how they satisfy the
axiomatic assumptions of thermodynamics. The capability of hydrodynamics to
accurately describe slow and long-wavelength fluctuations around a NESS remains
an open question. In this study, we provide positive evidence by specifically
addressing electrically driven non-equilibrium charged steady states. Our
approach involves introducing gapped modes and extending the effective
description into a relaxed hydrodynamic theory (RHT). Leveraging the
gauge-gravity duality as a tool for controlled computations within
non-equilibrium systems, we establish an ultraviolet complete model for these
NESS that confirms the validity of our RHT. In summary, our findings present a
concrete realization of a RHT applicable to a NESS. This expands the regime of
validity of hydrodynamics beyond thermal equilibrium, offering valuable
insights into the dynamics of non-equilibrium systems.

<h3>Critical behavior of dirty parafermionic chains</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04324" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04324</a>

</p><i>Akshat Pandey, Aditya Cowsik</i>
<p>A family of $\mathbb Z_n$-symmetric non-Hermitian models of Baxter was shown
by Fendley to be exactly solvable via a parafermionic generalization of the
Clifford algebra. We study these models with spatially random couplings, and
obtain several exact results on thermodynamic singularities as the
distributions of couplings are varied. We find that these singularities,
independent of $n$, are identical to those in the random transverse-field Ising
chain; correspondingly the models host infinite-randomness critical points.
Similarities in structure to exact methods for random Ising models, a
strong-disorder renormalization group, and generalizations to other models with
free spectra, are discussed.

<h3>Signatures of fragmentation for periodically driven fermions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04328" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04328</a>
<br>
</p><i>Somsubhra Ghosh, Indranil Paul, K. Sengupta</i>
<p>We study the possible signatures of prethermal strong Hilbert space
fragmentation (HSF) for one-dimensional (1D) fermions subjected to a periodic
drive. We extend the results of Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 120401 (2023) to show the
possibility of such fragmentation for a large class of experimentally relevant
drive protocols. Moreover, we demonstrate the persistence of HSF when the
fermion chain is taken away from half-filling. Both these analysis indicate the
robustness of the fragmentation phenomenon reported earlier. We also provide an
alternate derivation of the Floquet Hamiltonian of the driven chain which
yields insight into the generic nested commutator structure of its higher order
terms. Finally, we study the density-density out-of-time-correlators (OTOC) of
the driven chain both away and near the special drive frequencies at which its
first order Floquet Hamiltonian exhibits fragmentation. We show that these
OTOCs, for a chain with open boundary condition, exhibit a distinct periodic
unscrambling of information at special drive frequencies; such unscrambling can
therefore serve as a marker of prethermal HSF. We provide an approximate
analytic explanation of the role of HSF behind such periodic unscrambling and
discuss experiments which can detect signatures of strong HSF in such driven
chains.

<h3>Optical absorption signatures of superconductors driven by Van Hove  singularities</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04329" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04329</a>
<br>
</p><i>Hyeok-Jun Yang, Yi-Ting Hsu</i>
<p>Due to the diverging density of states (DOS), Van Hove singularities (VHS)
near the Fermi level are known to boost the susceptibility to a wide variety of
electronic instabilities, including superconductivity. We theoretically show
that the number of VHS in the normal state can be qualitatively inferred from
the optical absorption spectra Re $\sigma_{ii}(\omega)$ in the superconducting
state. The key feature is the absorption peak at frequency $\omega=2\Delta$
from the optical transition across the superconducting gap $\Delta$, which is
forbidden in a single-band clean superconductor when the inversion symmetry is
preserved and the band is quadratic. Although VHS dispersions are mostly
quadratic, we find that a divergent peak occurs when there are multiple VHS on
the Fermi surface under an applied current. In contrast, we find non-diverging
weak peaks when there is only a single VHS. Depending on whether this single
VHS has logarithmically or power-law divergent DOS, the peaks in Re
$\sigma_{xx}(\omega)$ and Re $\sigma_{yy}(\omega)$ are nearly isotropic and
anisotropic, respectively. Therefore, we propose that experimentally measured
peak magnitude and anisotropy in the optical absorption spectra of VH-driven
superconductors can be used to determine the number and type of VHS on the
Fermi surface. Disorders could even facilitate in distinguishing the multiple
and single VHS scenarios since only the diverging peak in the latter case is
expected to survive.

<h3>Bipartite Fluctuations of Critical Fermi Surfaces</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04331" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04331</a>
<br>
</p><i>Xiao-Chuan Wu</i>
<p>We investigate the scaling behaviors of bipartite fluctuations $\mathcal{F}$
of conserved quantities across a class of interaction-driven quantum phase
transitions out of Landau fermi liquids, where other phases involve
fermi-surface states of fractionalized degrees of freedom. Examples of such
phases include (compressible) composite fermi liquids for spinless electrons
and (incompressible) spin-liquid Mott insulators for spin-$1/2$ electrons. The
two sides of the critical points are typically distinguished by distinct
leading-order scalings of bipartite charge fluctuations, $\mathcal{F}\sim L\log
(L)$ in Landau fermi liquids, and $\mathcal{F}\sim L$ in the other phases,
where $L$ is the linear size of the subsystem under bipartition. In the case of
composite fermi liquids (with continuous translational and rotational
invariance), we also identify a universal constant term
$-\mathtt{F}(\theta)\sigma_{xy}/\pi$ arising when the subsystem geometry
incorporates a sharp corner. Here, $\mathtt{F}(\theta)$ represents a function
of the corner angle, and $\sigma_{xy}$ denotes the Hall conductivity. At the
critical point of each example, we find that the leading-order scaling
$\mathcal{F}\sim L$ is accompanied by a subleading universal corner
contribution $-\mathtt{F}(\theta)C_{\rho}\log(L)$ with the same angle
dependence $\mathtt{F}(\theta)$. The universal coefficient $C_{\rho}$ is linked
to the predicted universal longitudinal (and Hall) resistivity jump
$\Delta\rho_{xx}$ (and $\Delta\rho_{xy}$) at the critical point.

<h3>Disorder operators in 2D Fermi and non-Fermi liquids through  multidimensional bosonization</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04334" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04334</a>
<br>
</p><i>Kang-Le Cai, Meng Cheng</i>
<p>Disorder operators are a type of non-local observables for quantum many-body
systems, measuring the fluctuations of symmetry charges inside a region. It has
been shown that disorder operators can reveal global aspects of many-body
states that are otherwise difficult to access through local measurements. We
study disorder operator for U(1) (charge or spin) symmetry in 2D Fermi and
non-Fermi liquid states, using the multidimensional bosonization formalism. For
a region $A$, the logarithm of the charge disorder parameter in a Fermi liquid
with isotropic interactions scales asympototically as $l_A\ln l_A$, with $l_A$
being the linear size of the region $A$. We calculate the proportionality
coefficient in terms of Landau parameters of the Fermi liquid theory. We then
study models of Fermi surface coupled to gapless bosonic fields realizing
non-Fermi liquid states. In a simple spinless model, where the fermion density
is coupled to a critical scalar, we find that at the quantum critical point,
the scaling behavior of the charge disorder operators is drastically modified
to $l_A \ln^2 l_A$. We also consider the composite Fermi liquid state and argue
that the charge disorder operator scales as $l_A$.

<h3>Evidence for charge mediated coupling in Fe-Ga/PMN-PT composite  multiferroic</h3>

<p>We present an experimental study of the magnetoelectric coupling (MEC) in the
Fe-Ga/PMN-PT thin film multiferroic composite by means of x-ray magnetic
circular dichroism (XMCD) and ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). Our measurements
show evidence for a charge mediated coupling mechanism, suggested by the
asymmetric magnetic remanence (M$_{rem}$) behaviour under opposite electric
fields ($\pm$ E) and the asymmetric resonance field (H$_r$) in the FMR
measurements. Also, the FMR measurements reveal a perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy (PMA), that can be related to an interface charge effect. and it is
tunable by E field. Ab initio calculations support the existence of a charge
mediated coupling at the Fe-Ga/PMN-PT interface.

<h3>Field-dependent Magnons in a Honeycomb Antiferromagnet CoTiO$_3$</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04390" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04390</a>
<br>
</p><i>Bo Yuan, Ezekiel Horsley, M.B. Stone, Nicholas P. Butch, Guangyong Xu, Guo-Jiun Shu, J. P. Clancy, Young-June Kim</i>
<p>We report field-dependent high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering (INS)
measurements on the honeycomb lattice magnet, CoTiO$_3$, to study the evolution
of its magnon excitations across a spin reorientation transition driven by an
in-plane magnetic field. By carrying out elastic neutron scattering in a
magnetic field, we show that the sample transitions from a collinear
antiferromagnetic state with multiple magnetic domains at a low field to a
mono-domain state with a canted magnetic structure at a high field. Concurrent
with this transition, we observed significant changes in both the energy and
the width of the zone center magnon peak. The observed width change is argued
to be consistent with an unusual zero-field state with extended domain walls.
On the other hand, the magnon spectra near the $\mathbf{K}$ point of the
Brillouin zone boundary are found to be largely insensitive to the changes in
the ordered moment directions and the domain configuration. We argue that this
observation is difficult to explain within the framework of the bond-dependent
model proposed in a recent INS study [Elliot \textit{et\,al}, Nat. Commun.,
\textbf{12}, 3936 (2021)]. Our study therefore calls for alternative
explanations for the observed $\mathbf{K}$-point gap in CoTiO$_3$.

<h3>Contact-based molecular dynamics of structured and disordered proteins  in a coarse-grained model: fixed contacts, switchable contacts and those  described by pseudo-improper-dihedral angles</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04431" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04431</a>
<br>
</p><i>Łukasz Mioduszewski, Jakub Bednarz, Mateusz Chwastyk, Marek Cieplak</i>
<p>We present a coarse-grained C$\alpha$-based protein model that can be used to
simulate structured, intrinsically disordered and partially disordered
proteins. We use a Go-like potential for the structured parts and two different
variants of a transferable potential for the disordered parts. The first
variant uses dynamic structure-based (DSB) contacts that form and disappear
quasi-adiabatically during the simulation. By using specific structural
criteria we distinguish sidechain-sidechain, sidechain-backbone and
backbone-backbone contacts. The second variant is a non-radial multi-body
pseudo-improper-dihedral (PID) potential that does not include time-dependent
terms but requires more computational resources. Our model can simulate in
reasonable time thousands of residues on millisecond time scales.

<h3>Magnetoroton in a two-dimensional Bose-Bose mixture</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04440" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04440</a>
<br>
</p><i>O. I. Utesov, S. V. Andreev</i>
<p>We extend our theory of slow magnons in a two-component Bose-Einstein
condensate to the case of two spatial dimensions (2D). We provide a detailed
discussion of polaronic corrections to the magnon branch of the elementary
excitation spectrum in a weakly- and strongly-interacting regimes. In a dilute
system, the latter may be achieved by adjusting inter-species attraction such
as to obtain a resonance in the $p$-wave scattering channel. Resonantly
enhanced $p$-wave attraction results in the self-localization of magnons and
formation of a magnetoroton. The nature of a ground state beyond the
magnetoroton instability remains to be explored. We suggest a dilute p-wave
crystal of alternating polarization as a possible candidate. In contrast to
three dimensions (3D), the required strength of the attractive potential in the
$s$-wave channel here corresponds to tight binding, and we suggest a potential
realization of our model with excitons in 2D semiconductors.

<h3>Spin-charge-lattice coupling across the charge density wave transition  in a Kagome lattice antiferromagnet</h3>

</p><i>Xiaokun Teng, David W. Tam, Lebing Chen, Hengxin Tan, Yaofeng Xie, Bin Gao, Garrett E. Granroth, Alexandre Ivanov, Philippe Bourges, Binghai Yan, Ming Yi, Pengcheng Dai</i>
<p>Understanding spin and lattice excitations in a metallic magnetic ordered
system form the basis to unveil the magnetic and lattice exchange couplings and
their interactions with itinerant electrons. Kagome lattice antiferromagnet
FeGe is interesting because it displays rare charge density wave (CDW) deep
inside the antiferromagnetic ordered phase that interacts with the magnetic
order. We use neutron scattering to study the evolution of spin and lattice
excitations across the CDW transition $T_{\rm CDW}$ in FeGe. While spin
excitations below $\sim$100 meV can be well described by spin waves of a spin-1
Heisenberg Hamiltonian, spin excitations at higher energies are centered around
the Brillouin zone boundary and extend up to $\sim180$ meV consistent with
quasiparticle excitations across spin-polarized electron-hole Fermi surfaces.
Furthermore, $c$-axis spin wave dispersion and Fe-Ge optical phonon modes show
a clear hardening below $T_{\rm CDW}$ due to spin-charge-lattice coupling but
with no evidence for a phonon Kohn anomaly. By comparing our experimental
results with density functional theory calculations in absolute units, we
conclude that FeGe is a Hund's metal in the intermediate correlated regime
where magnetism has contributions from both itinerant and localized electrons
arising from spin polarized electronic bands near the Fermi level.

<h3>Unsupervised machine learning for supercooled liquids</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04473" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04473</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yunrui Qiu, Inhyuk Jang, Xuhui Huang, Arun Yethiraj</i>
<p>Unraveling dynamic heterogeneity in supercooled liquids from structural
information is one of the grand challenges of physics. In this work, we
introduce an unsupervised machine learning approach based on a time-lagged
autoencoder (TAE) to elucidate the effect of structural features on the
long-term dynamics of supercooled liquids. The TAE uses an autoencoder to
reconstruct features at time $t + \Delta t$ from input features at time $t$ for
individual particles, and the resulting latent space variables are considered
as order parameters. In the Kob-Andersen system, with a $\Delta t$ about a
thousand times smaller than the relaxation time, the TAE order parameter
exhibits a remarkable correlation with the long-time propensity. We find that
short-range radial features correlate with the short-time dynamics, and
medium-range radial features correlate with the long-time dynamics. This shows
that fluctuations of medium-range structural features contain sufficient
information about the long-time dynamic heterogeneity, consistent with some
theoretical predictions.

<h3>Possible charge density wave induced lattice distortion in ferromagnetic  FeGe film</h3>

<p>Binary compound FeGe hosts multiple structures, where skyrmion lattice
emerges in the chiral B20 phase and antiferromagnet with charge density wave
shows up in the hexagonal phase. Here, we synthesized monoclinic FeGe films
which are ferromagnetic with Curie temperature as high as 800 K. By low
temperature transmission electron microscope, lattice reconstructions in both
real and reciprocal space were captured at 100 K whereas no observable
transition was observed in either transport nor magnetic characterizations. We
infer the lattice distortion may be induced by charge density wave. Our work
suggests FeGe films an ideal platform for understanding the intertwining of
charge density wave, lattice distortion and magnetism, and paves the way to the
tuning charge density wave by means of lattice engineering.

<h3>Formation and Microwave Losses of Hydrides in Superconducting Niobium  Thin Films Resulting from Fluoride Chemical Processing</h3>

<p>Superconducting Nb thin films have recently attracted significant attention
due to their utility for quantum information technologies. In the processing of
Nb thin films, fluoride-based chemical etchants are commonly used to remove
surface oxides that are known to affect superconducting quantum devices
adversely. However, these same etchants can also introduce hydrogen to form Nb
hydrides, potentially negatively impacting microwave loss performance. Here, we
present comprehensive materials characterization of Nb hydrides formed in Nb
thin films as a function of fluoride chemical treatments. In particular,
secondary-ion mass spectrometry, X-ray scattering, and transmission electron
microscopy reveal the spatial distribution and phase transformation of Nb
hydrides. The rate of hydride formation is determined by the fluoride solution
acidity and the etch rate of Nb2O5, which acts as a diffusion barrier for
hydrogen into Nb. The resulting Nb hydrides are detrimental to Nb
superconducting properties and lead to increased power-independent microwave
loss in coplanar waveguide resonators. However, Nb hydrides do not correlate
with two-level system loss or device aging mechanisms. Overall, this work
provides insight into the formation of Nb hydrides and their role in microwave
loss, thus guiding ongoing efforts to maximize coherence time in
superconducting quantum devices.

<h3>Heat flows from hot to cold: A simple rigorous example of thermalization  in an isolated macroscopic quantum system</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04533" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04533</a>
<br>
</p><i>Hal Tasaki</i>
<p>In the present note, we discuss a simple example of a macroscopic quantum
many-body system in which the approach to thermal equilibrium from an arbitrary
initial state in the microcanonical energy shell is proved without relying on
any unproven assumptions. The model, which is equivalent to a free fermion
chain, is designed to be a toy model for a weakly heat-conducting
one-dimensional solid. We take a phenomenological point of view and perceive
that the system is in thermal equilibrium when the measured coarse-grained
energy distribution is uniform.
The result on thermalization reported here is a variation (and an
improvement) of our previous result on the irreversible expansion in a free
fermion chain. As far as we know, this is the first concrete and rigorous
realization of the philosophy on the foundation of equilibrium statistical
mechanics proposed by von Neumann in 1929, and further developed recently by
Goldstein, Lebowitz, Mastrodonato, Tumulka, and Zangh\`\i and the present
author, namely, to characterize thermal equilibrium from a macroscopic
viewpoint and to make use of the strong ETH to control the long-time dynamics.
This note will be the most technical part of my longer article on
thermalization, "What is thermal equilibrium and how do we get there?". I am
making this document public at this stage since I have already announced (and
will announce) the results at some of my talks.

<h3>Ferroelectric metals in van der Waals bilayers</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04571" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04571</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jiagang Zhang, Ting Zhang</i>
<p>The combination of metallicity and ferroelectricity breaks traditional
boundaries, paving new avenues for innovative electronic materials and devices.
This breakthrough is particularly notable, as metallicity and ferroelectricity
have traditionally been considered mutually exclusive physical properties. In
this work, starting with non-polar metallic single layers, we propose a general
scheme for designing 2D ferroelectric metals (FEMs) based on van der Waals
interaction. By first-principles calculations, we further substantiate the
feasibility of the design scheme in real materials such as FeSe and H-MnTe2.
Notably, this scheme unveils unique metallic ferroelectricity, characterized by
reversing polarization through interlayer sliding. Furthermore, the combination
of inherent magnetism with sliding ferroelectricity leads to multiferroicity.
The investigated design scheme and observed phenomena have broad applicability
across 2D materials. Our results not only pave the way for research in 2D FEMs
but also offer promising prospects for foundational studies of coupled physical
phenomena in 2D lattices.

<h3>Quantum magnetic oscillations in the absence of closed electron  trajectories</h3>

</p><i>Z. E. Krix, O. A. Tkachenko, V. A. Tkachenko, D. Q. Wang, O. Klochan, A. R. Hamilton, O. P. Sushkov</i>
<p>Quantum magnetic oscillations in crystals are typically understood in terms
of Bohr-Sommerfeld quantisation, the frequency of oscillation is given by the
area of a closed electron trajectory. However, since the 1970s, oscillations
have been observed with frequencies that do not correspond to closed electron
trajectories and this effect has remained not fully understood. Previous theory
has focused on explaining the effect using various kinetic mechanisms, however,
frequencies without a closed electron orbit have been observed in equilibrium
and so a kinetic mechanism cannot be the entire story. In this work we develop
a theory which explains these frequencies in equilibrium and can thus be used
to understand measurements of both Shubnikov-de Haas and de Haas-van Alphen
oscillations. We show, analytically, that these frequencies arise due to
multi-electron correlations. We then extend our theory to explain a recent
experiment on artificial crystals in GaAs two-dimensional electron gases, which
revealed for the first time magnetic oscillations having frequencies that are
half of those previously observed. We show that the half-frequencies arise in
equilibrium from single-particle dynamics with account of impurities. Our
analytic results are reinforced by exact numerics, which we also use clarify
prior works on the kinetic regime.

<h3>Theory of local $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological markers for finite and  periodic two-dimensional systems</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Nicolas Baù, Antimo Marrazzo</i>
<p>The topological phases of two-dimensional time-reversal symmetric insulators
are classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological invariant. Usually, the
invariant is introduced and calculated by exploiting the way time-reversal
symmetry acts in reciprocal space, hence implicitly assuming periodicity and
homogeneity. Here, we introduce two space-resolved $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological
markers that are able to probe the local topology of the ground-state
electronic structure also in the case of inhomogeneous and finite systems. The
first approach leads to a generalized local spin-Chern marker, that usually
remains well-defined also when the perpendicular component of the spin,
$S_{z}$, is not conserved. The second marker is solely based on time-reversal
symmetry, hence being more general. We validate our markers on the Kane-Mele
model both in periodic and open boundary conditions, also in presence of
disorder and including topological/trivial heterojunctions.

<p>The paramagnetic phase diagrams of the half-filled Hubbard model on a twisted
bilayer square lattice are investigated using coherent potential approximation.
Besides the conventional metallic, band insulating, and Mott insulating phases,
we find two site-selective insulating phases where certain sites exhibit band
insulating behaviors while the others display Mott insulating behaviors. These
phases are identified by the band gap, the double occupancy, the density of
states, as well as the imaginary part of self-energy. Furthermore, we examine
the effect of on-site potential on the stability of the site-selective
insulating phases. Our results indicate that fruitful site-selective phases can
be engineered by twisting.

detrimental effects on electronic transport. Here, we focus on a special type
of impurities that preferentially adsorb onto the hollow regions of graphene
nanoribbons (GNRs), and study how they affect the quantum transport in GNRs.
Contrary to previous knowledge that random adatoms should localize electrons,
the so-called Anderson localization, noteworthy quantized conductance peaks
(QCPs) are observed at specific electron energies. These QCPs are remarkably
robust against variations in system size, GNR edge, and adatom properties, and
they can reappear at identical energies following an arithmetic sequence of
device width. Further investigation of wavefunction reveals a unique transport
mode at each QCP energy which transmits through disordered GNRs
reflectionlessly, while all the others become fully Anderson localized,
indicating the survival of quantum ballistic transport in the localized regime.
Our findings highlight the potential utility of hollow adatoms as a powerful
tool to manipulate the conductivity of GNRs, and deepen the understanding of
the interplay between impurities and graphene.

<p>We introduce a novel model, comprising self-avoiding surfaces and
incorporating edges and tubules, that is designed to characterize the
structural morphologies and transitions observed within the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER). By employing discretized models, we model smooth membranes with
triangulated surfaces, and we utilize numerical variational methods to minimize
energies associated with periodic morphologies. Our study obtains phases, their
morphologies, and their transitions and examines their dependence on the
membrane chemical potential, the line tensions, and the positive Gaussian
curvature stiffness. By starting with diverse topological structures, we
explore shape variations by using Surface Evolver, while maintaining fixed
topology. Notably, we identify the region of parameter space where the model
displays lamellae, with a lattice of helical edges connecting the layers; this
resembles structures that have been observed in the rough ER. Furthermore, our
investigation reveals an intricate phase diagram with periodic structures,
including flat lamellar sheets, sponge phases, and configurations comprising
tubules with junctions, which are akin to the morphology of the smooth ER. An
estimation of lattice parameters is achieved through fluctuation analysis.
Significantly, our model predicts a transition between homotopically equivalent
lamellae, with helical edges and configurations featuring tubules with
junctions.

<p>To develop new devices based on synthetic ferrimagnetic (S-FiM)
heterostructures, understanding the material's physical properties is pivotal.
Here, the induced magnetic moment (IMM), magnetic exchange-coupling, and spin
textures were investigated at room-temperature in Pt/Co/Gd multilayers using a
multiscale approach. The magnitude and direction of the IMM were interpreted
experimentally and theoretically in the framework of both X-ray magnetic
circular dichroism (XMCD) and density functional theory (DFT). The results
demonstrate that the IMM transferred by Co across the Gd paramagnetic (PM)
thickness leads to a flipped spin state (FSS) within the Gd layers, in which
their magnetic moments couple antiparallel/parallel with the ferromagnetic (FM)
Co near/far from the Co/Gd interface, respectively. For the Pt, in both Pt/Co
and Gd/Pt interfaces the IMM follows the same direction as the Co magnetic
moment, with negligible IMM in the Gd/Pt interface. Additionally, zero-field
spin spirals were imaged using scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM),
while micromagnetic simulations employed to unfold the interactions stabilizing
the FiM configurations, where the existence of a sizable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction is demonstrated to be crucial for the formation of those spin
textures. Our outcomes may add fundamental physical and technological aspects
for using FiM films in antiferromagnetic spintronic devices.

<h3>Collective charge excitations studied by electron energy-loss  spectroscopy</h3>

</p><i>Peter Abbamonte, Jörg Fink</i>
<p>The dynamic charge susceptibility, $\chi(q,\omega)$, is a fundamental
observable of all materials, in one, two, and three dimensions, quantifying the
collective charge modes, the ability of a material to screen charge, as well as
its electronic compressibility. Here, we review the current state of efforts to
measure this quantity using inelastic electron scattering, which historically
has been called electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). We focus on
comparison between transmission (T-EELS) and reflection (R-EELS) geometries as
applied to a selection of 3D conductors. While a great deal is understood about
simple metals, measurements of more strongly interacting and strange metals are
currently contradictory, with different groups obtaining fundamentally
conflicting results, emphasizing the importance of improved EELS measurements.
Further, current opportunities for improvement in EELS techniques are vast,
with the most promising future developments being in hemispherical and
time-of-flight analyzers, as well as STEM instruments configured for high
momentum resolution. We conclude that, despite more than half a century of
work, EELS techniques are currently still in their infancy

<p>Description of electrons as solitons of the polarization field implies that
an ordinary dielectric has a hidden order, associated with the invariance with
respect to adding loops of quantized electric flux. We describe the mechanism
by which the finite polarizability of the medium renders the interaction
between the solitons short-ranged (prior to their coupling to electromagnetism)
and argue that the structure of the solitons allows them to be quantized as
either fermions or bosons. At the quantum level, the theory has, in addition to
the solitonic electric, elementary magnetic excitations, suggesting that small
dielectrics may host quantized magnetic vortices carrying circular polarization
currents.

<p>The interrelationship between flat bands and correlated phenomena such as
unconventional superconductivity stands as an intriguing subject in condensed
matter physics. Here, by first-principles calculations and random phase
approximation analyses, we investigate the electronic structure,
superconducting instability, as well as roles of the incipient flat bands in
kagome superconductor CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$. Our calculations reveal strong
antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$, which mediates two sets
of spin-singlet superconducting orders with $s_{\pm}$- and ($d_{xy}$,
$d_{x^2-y^2}$)-wave symmetries. Under the dominance of local Coulomb
interactions, the unoccupied incipient flat bands are shown to be crucial for
the momentum dependence of spin fluctuations and thus the superconductivity.
Our further analyses unveil a sublattice-momentum-coupling-driven mechanism for
this momentum-dependent enhancement of the fluctuations, which provides us a
new perspective for future studies of geometrically frustrated systems.

<p>The bond-dependent Kitaev model offers a playground in which one can search
for quantum spin liquids. In these Kitaev materials, a symmetric off-diagonal
$\Gamma$ term emerges, hosting a number of remarkable features, which has been
particularly challenging to fully understand. One primary question that arises
after recognizing a new phase is how information will spread in it.
Out-of-time-ordered commutators and entanglement entropy describe processes
whereby information about the initial condition of a unitarily evolving system
propagates over the system. A possible way to investigate dynamics in such
systems is by considering one-dimensional models. We investigate here the
one-dimensional spin-1/2 XY model in a transverse field with a $\Gamma$
interaction with periodic boundary conditions imposed. We will show that the
$\Gamma$ interaction constructs an asymmetric "light-cone" with different
butterfly velocities. In addition, it leads to faster information propagation
in the spiral phase and slower propagation in the ferromagnetic and
paramagnetic phases. Interestingly, we observe a pronounced effect in the
entanglement entropy, explicitly showing up as a two-stage linear growth in
time as fast/slow then slow/fast for quenches originating from the spiral
phase. We hope our work paves the way for studying more about the spreading of
information in one-dimensional Kitaev materials, which can in turn help to
discover unknown aspects of higher-dimensional models.

<p>Antiferromagnets have attracted significant attention in the field of
magnonics, as promising candidates for ultralow-energy carriers for information
transfer for future computing. The role of crystalline orientation distribution
on magnon transport has received very little attention. In multiferroics such
as BiFeO$_3$ the coupling between antiferromagnetic and polar order imposes yet
another boundary condition on spin transport. Thus, understanding the
fundamentals of spin transport in such systems requires a single domain, a
single crystal. We show that through Lanthanum(La) substitution, a single
ferroelectric domain can be engineered with a stable, single-variant spin
cycloid, controllable by an electric field. The spin transport in such a single
domain displays a strong anisotropy, arising from the underlying spin cycloid
lattice. Our work shows a pathway to understand the fundamental origins of spin
transport in such a single domain multiferroic.

<h3>Infinite Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method for  zero-temperature equilibrium quantum impurity problems</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04757" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04757</a>
<br>
</p><i>Chu Guo, Ruofan Chen</i>
<p>The Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator (GTEMPO) method has
proven to be an accurate and efficient numerical method for the real-time
dynamics of quantum impurity problems. Whereas its application for
imaginary-time calculations is much less competitive compared to
well-established methods such as the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo
(CTQMC). In this work, we unleash the full power of GTEMPO for zero-temperature
imaginary-time calculations: the multi-time impurity state is
time-translationally invariant with infinite boundary condition, therefore it
can be represented as an infinite Grassmann matrix product state (GMPS) with
nontrivial unit cell in a single time step, instead of an open boundary GMPS
spanning the whole imaginary-time axis. We devise a very efficient infinite
GTEMPO algorithm targeted at zero-temperature equilibrium quantum impurity
problems, which is known to be a hard regime for quantum Monte Carlo methods.
To demonstrate the performance of our method, we benchmark it against exact
solutions in the noninteracting limit, and against CTQMC calculations in the
Anderson impurity models with up to two orbitals, where we show that the
required bond dimension of the infinite GMPS is much smaller than its
finite-temperature counterpart.

<h3>Quantification of the strong, phonon-induced Urbach tails in  \b{eta}-Ga2O3 and their implications on electrical breakdown</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04768" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04768</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ariful Islam, Nathan David Rock, Michael A. Scarpulla</i>
<p>In ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) nitride and oxide semiconductors, increased
bandgap (Eg) correlates with greater ionicity and strong electron-phonon
coupling. This limits mobility through polar optical phonon scattering,
localizes carriers via polarons and self-trapping, broadens optical transitions
via dynamic disorder, and modifies the breakdown field. Herein, we use
polarized optical transmission spectroscopy from 77-633 K to investigate the
Urbach energy (Eu) for many orientations of Fe- and Sn-doped \b{eta}-Ga2O3 bulk
crystals. We find Eu values ranging from 60-140 meV at 293 K and static
(structural defects plus zero-point phonons) disorder contributes more to Eu
than dynamic (finite temperature phonon-induced) disorder. This is evidenced by
lack of systematic Eu anisotropy, and Eu correlating more with X-ray
diffraction rocking-curve broadening than with Sn-doping. The lowest measured
Eu are ~10x larger than for traditional semiconductors, pointing out that band
tail effects need to be carefully considered in these materials for high field
electronics. We demonstrate that, because optical transmission through thick
samples is sensitive to sub-gap absorption, the commonly-used Tauc extraction
of bandgap from transmission through Ga2O3 greater than 1-3 micro meter thick
is subject to errors. Combining our Eu(T) from Fe-doped samples with Eg(T) from
ellipsometry, we extract a measure of an effective electron-phonon coupling
indicating increases in weighted 2nd order deformation potential with
temperature and a larger value for E parallel b than E parallel c. The large
electron-phonon coupling in beta-Ga2O3 suggests that theories of electrical
breakdown for traditional semiconductors need expansion to account not just for
lower scattering time but also for impact ionization thresholds fluctuating in
both time and space.

<p>We consider a refinement of the usual Hartree-Fock method applied the 2D
Hubbard model, in Nambu spinor formulation. The new element is the addition of
a ''condensate inducing'' term proportional to a variational parameter h to the
Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian, which generates an s- or d-wave condensate. This
modified Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian is used only to generate variational trial
states; energy expectation values are computed in the full two-dimensional
Hubbard Hamiltonian with no modification. It is found that there exist trial
states with non-vanishing condensates that are significantly lower in energy
than the standard Hartree-Fock ground states, in some range of the U/t-density
plane.

<p>The incommensurate charge density wave states (CDWs) can exhibit steady
motion in the flow limit after depinning, behaving as a nonequilibrium system
with time-dependent states. Since the moving CDW, like an electric current,
breaks both time-reversal and inversion symmetries, one may speculate the
emergence of nonreciprocal nonlinear responses from such motion. However, the
moving CDW order parameter is intrinsically time-dependent in the lab frame,
and it is known to be challenging to evaluate the responses of such a
time-varying system. In this work, following the principle of Galilean
relativity, we resolve this time-dependent hard problem in the lab frame by
mapping the system to the comoving frame with static CDW states through the
Galilean transformation. We explicitly show that the nonreciprocal nonlinear
responses would be generated by the movement of CDW states through violating
Galilean relativity. Our work demonstrates not only nonreciprocal nonlinear
responses in nonequilibrium states but also the application of Galilean
transformation in simplifying time-dependent problems.

<p>Computational prediction of stable crystal structures has a profound impact
on the large-scale discovery of novel functional materials. However, predicting
the crystal structure solely from a material's composition or formula is a
promising yet challenging task, as traditional ab initio crystal structure
prediction (CSP) methods rely on time-consuming global searches and
first-principles free energy calculations. Inspired by the recent success of
deep learning approaches in protein structure prediction, which utilize
pairwise amino acid interactions to describe 3D structures, we present
AlphaCrystal-II, a novel knowledge-based solution that exploits the abundant
inter-atomic interaction patterns found in existing known crystal structures.
AlphaCrystal-II predicts the atomic distance matrix of a target crystal
material and employs this matrix to reconstruct its 3D crystal structure. By
leveraging the wealth of inter-atomic relationships of known crystal
structures, our approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness and reliability
in structure prediction through comprehensive experiments. This work highlights
the potential of data-driven methods in accelerating the discovery and design
of new materials with tailored properties.

</p><i>Zhongdong Han, Tingxin Li, Long Zhang, Rui-Rui Du</i>
<p>We report a magneto-induced topological phase transition in inverted
InAs/GaSb bilayers from a quantum spin Hall insulator to a normal insulator. We
utilize a dual-gated Corbino device in which the degree of band inversion, or
equivalently the electron and hole densities, can be continuously tuned. We
observe a topological phase transition around the magnetic field where a band
crossing occurs, that is accompanied by a bulk-gap closure characterized by a
bulk conductance peak (BCP). In another set of experiments, we study the
transition under a tilted magnetic field (tilt angle $\theta$). We observe the
characteristic magneto-conductance around BCP as a function of $\theta$, which
dramatically depends on the density of the bilayers. In a relatively
deep-inversion (hence a higher density) regime, where the electron-hole
hybridization dominates the excitonic interaction, the BCP grows with $\theta$.
On the contrary, in a shallowly-inverted (a lower density) regime, where the
excitonic interaction dominates the hybridization, the BCP is suppressed
indicating a smooth crossover without a gap closure. This suggests the
existence of a low-density, correlated insulator with spontaneous symmetry
breaking near the critical point. Our highly controllable electron-hole system
offers an ideal platform to study interacting topological states as proposed by
recent theories.

<p>Fe5GeTe2 single crystals can be divided into nonquenched (NQ) and
quench-cooled (QC) phases with different magnetic properties. A comprehensive
understanding of the magnetic property variations in the NQ and QC phases is
imperative for guiding Fe5GeTe2 towards spintronics applications; however, it
remains elusive. Here, we report a real-space study on the structural and
magnetic properties of these two magnetic phases using cryogenic magnetic force
microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy. The thermal history introduces
disorder and order to the Fe(1) sites, resulting in the NQ and QC phases
exhibiting global and broken inversion symmetry, respectively. The observed
magnetic domain transitions (branching to labyrinthine) in the spin
reorientation process and the distinct 3D spin textures stabilized by magnetic
dipolar interaction observed in field-dependent studies allow the NQ phase to
exhibit a more resilient global magnetic state. In contrast, the QC phase
exhibits enhanced magnetic anisotropy, resulting in a higher TC. Meanwhile, the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) introduced by the broken inversion
symmetry causes the QC phase to exhibit a localized magnetic state: no domain
transformation occurs during spin reorientation, and irregular domain states
are observed in field-related studies. Our work provides an important reference
for understanding the complex magnetic properties in Fe5GeTe2.

<p>The population-averaged contact maps generated by the chromosome conformation
capture technique provide important information about the average frequency of
contact between pairs of chromatin loci as a function of the genetic distance
between them. However, these datasets do not tell us anything about the joint
statistics of simultaneous contacts between genomic loci in individual cells.
This kind of statistical information can be extracted using the single-cell
Hi-C method, which is capable of detecting a large fraction of simultaneous
contacts within a single cell, as well as through modern methods of fluorescent
labeling and super-resolution imaging. Motivated by the prospect of the
imminent availability of relevant experimental data, in this work we
theoretically model the joint statistics of pairs of contacts located along a
line perpendicular to the main diagonal of the single-cell contact map. The
analysis is performed within the framework of an ideal polymer model with
quenched disorder of random loops, which, as previous studies have shown,
allows to take into account the influence of the loop extrusion process on the
conformational properties of interphase chromatin.

oxygen incorporation at top electrode edges and grain boundaries accompanied
with an increase in current leakage and the disappearance of ferroelectric
properties, was observed in nanoscale after long-term field cycling. This
observation indicates the emergence of non-ferroelectric and even amorphous
states. This presented work revealed solid experimental evidence of an

<p>We present a detailed theoretical study of the optoelectronic properties of a
Na$_3$Bi-based three-dimensional Dirac electronic system (3DDES). The optical
conductivity is evaluated using the energy-balance equation derived from a
Boltzmann equation, where the electron Hamiltonian is taken from a simplified
$\mathbf{k}\cdotp \mathbf{p}$ approach. We find that for short-wavelength
irradiation, the optical absorption in Na$_3$Bi is mainly due to inter-band
electronic transitions. In contrast to the universal optical conductance
observed for graphene, the optical conductivity for Na$_3$Bi based 3DDES
depends on the radiation frequency but not on temperature, carrier density and
electronic relaxation time. In the radiation wavelength regime of about 5 $\mu
m<\lambda<$ 200 $\mu m$, an optical absorption window is found. This is similar
to what is observed in graphene. The position and width of the absorption
window depend on the direction of the light polarization and sensitively on
temperature, carrier density, and electronic relaxation time. Particularly, we
demonstrate that the inter-band optical absorption channel can be switched on
and off by applying the gate voltage. This implies that similar to graphene,
Na$_3$Bi based 3DDES can also be applied in infrared electro-optical
modulators. Our theoretical findings are helpful in gaining an in-depth
understanding of the basic optoelectronic properties of recently discovered
3DDESs.

</p><i>Kangzhi Zhou, Jiajun Feng, Ziran Liu, Huiqiu Deng, Lixia Jia, Xinfu He</i>
<p>In body-centered cubic (bcc) metals such as molybdenum, screw dislocations
often exhibit non-Schmid behavior, moving in directions unpredicted by the
Schmid law. The mobility of these dislocations is notably influenced by the
presence of solute atoms within the alloy matrix. In this study, employing
first-principles calculations, we delve into the electronic origins of these
influences.Initially, we construct both single atomic column and triple atomic
column models to simulate the formation of screw dislocations with solute
atoms. Our investigation reveals that tantalum (Ta) and tungsten (W) increase
the formation energy of solute-dislocation complexes, in contrast to osmium
(Os), iridium (Ir), and platinum (Pt). Subsequently, employing a comprehensive
screw dislocation dipole model under shear deformation, we explore the combined
effects of solute atoms and deformation on dislocation core movement. Our
findings demonstrate that Ta and W, positioned as first nearest neighbors,
reduce the stress required to move dislocation cores away from corresponding
dislocation dipoles. Conversely, Os, Ir, and Pt exhibit an attractive effect on
dislocation cores, lowering the energy barrier for screw dislocation formation
and enticing dislocation cores towards these solute atoms.

<p>The Loschmidt echo is a popular quantity that allows making predictions about
the stability of quantum states under time evolution. In our work, we present
an approach that allows us to find a differential equation that can be used to
compute the Loschmidt echo. This approach, while in essence perturbative, has
the advantage that it converges at finite order. We demonstrate that the
approach for generically chosen matrix Hamiltonians often offers advantages
over Taylor and cumulant expansions even when we truncate at finite order. We
then apply the approach to two ordinary band Hamiltonians (multi-Weyl
semimetals and AB bilayer graphene) to obtain the Loschmidt echo after a quench
for an arbitrary starting state and find that the results readily generalize to
find transmission amplitudes and specific contributions to the partition
function, too. We then test our methods on many body spin and fermionic
Hamiltonians and find that while the approach still offers advantages, more
care has to be taken than in a generic case.

<p>Polarized neutron scattering is a very important analysis technique for
studies of magnetism, spintronics, and high-sensitivity measurements, among
others, offering invaluable information. Yet, the efficiency of such
experiments rely on the performance of the polarizing neutron optics to provide
high reflectivity and polarization. Presently, state-of-the-art polarizers like
Fe/Si supermirrors are not able to polarize neutrons at low scattering angles
in a monochromatic beam or able to polarize neutrons with a variety of
wavelengths as for a non-monochromatic beam. To overcome this limitation, it is
suggested to use Co/Ti multilayers on Ti substrates owing to their favorable
scattering length density characteristics. It is shown that this approach
enables a wavelength bandwidth several times larger than achievable with
state-of-the-art materials on Si or glass substrates. Consequently, enabling
the possibility of polarizing neutrons across an extended wavelength range,
including those with very high wavelengths.

chemically homogeneous BxC (x>4) matrix with internal high precision 10B/11B
isotope modulation. Simulations predict that these mirrors exhibit very high
neutron reflectivities for a small number of bilayer periods. This is
experimentally confirmed by neutron reflectivity measurements of mirrors
synthesized by ion-assisted magnetron sputter deposition. For example, a 120 nm
thick multilayer consisting of just 20 bilayer periods of 10B5.7C/11B5.7C, with
a periodicity of 61.5 {\AA}, exhibits a neutron reflectivity of 13 percent at
an incidence angle of 4.7 deg for neutrons with a wavelength of 4.825 {\AA}.
This is attributed to a high scattering length density contrast between the
layers with an interface width <5 {\AA}. Structural analyses by X-ray
diffraction, X-ray reflectivity, and transmission electron microscopy
demonstrate that the 10B5.7C/11B5.7C multilayer mirrors are composed of
amorphous, chemically homogenous B5.7C, without any internal chemical
modulation. The data show that 10BxC/11BxC multilayer mirrors have the
potential for higher neutron reflectivities at higher q-values using fewer and
thinner layers, compared to todays state-of-the-art chemically modulated
neutron multilayer mirrors.

<p>Light-matter interaction at the nanoscale in magnetic alloys and
heterostructures is a topic of intense research in view of potential
applications in high-density magnetic recording. While the element-specific
dynamics of electron spins is directly accessible to resonant x-ray pulses with
femtosecond time structure, the possible element-specific atomic motion remains
largely unexplored. We use ultrafast electron diffraction to probe the temporal
evolution of lattice Bragg peaks of FePt nanoparticles embedded in a carbon
matrix following excitation by an optical femtosecond laser pulse. The
diffraction interference between Fe and Pt sublattices enables us to
demonstrate that the Fe mean-square vibration amplitudes are significantly
larger that those of Pt as expected from their different atomic mass. Both are
found to increase as energy is transferred from the laser-excited electrons to
the lattice. Contrary to this intuitive behavior, we observe a laser-induced
lattice expansion that is larger for Pt than for Fe atoms during the first
picosecond after laser excitation. This effect points to the strain-wave driven
lattice expansion with the longitudinal acoustic Pt motion dominating that of
Fe.

<p>Semiconductor quantum dot arrays are a leading architecture for the
development of quantum technologies. Over the years, the constant capacitance
model has served as a fundamental framework for simulating, understanding, and
navigating the charge stability diagrams of small quantum dot arrays. However,
while the size of the arrays keeps growing, solving the constant capacitance
model becomes computationally prohibitive. This paper presents an open-source
software package able to compute a $100 \times 100$ pixels charge stability
diagram of a 16-dot array in less than a second. Smaller arrays can be
simulated in milliseconds - faster than they could be measured experimentally,
enabling the creation of diverse datasets for training machine learning models
and the creation of digital twins that can interface with quantum dot devices
in real-time. Our software package implements its core functionalities in the
systems programming language Rust and the high-performance numerical computing
library JAX. The Rust implementation benefits from advanced optimisations and
parallelisation, enabling the users to take full advantage of multi-core
processors. The JAX implementation allows for GPU acceleration.

<p>One of the daunting challenges in modern low temperature scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) is the difficulty of combining atomic resolution with cryogen
free cooling. Further functionality needs, such as ultra-high vacuum (UHV),
high magnetic field, and compatibility with {\mu}m-sized samples, pose
additional challenges to an already ambitious build. We present the design,
construction, and performance of a cryogen free, UHV, low temperature, and high
magnetic field system for modular STM operation. An internal vibration isolator
reduces vibrations in this system allowing atomic resolution STM imaging while
maintaining a low base temperature of ~4K and magnetic fields up to 9T. Samples
and tips can be conditioned in-situ utilizing a heating stage, an ion
sputtering gun, an e-beam evaporator, a tip treater, and sample exfoliation.
In-situ sample and tip exchange and alignment are performed in a connected UHV
room temperature stage with optical access. Multisite operation without
breaking vacuum is enabled by a unique quick-connect STM head design. A novel
low-profile vertical transfer mechanism permits transferring the STM between
room temperature and the low temperature cryostat.

<p>The first-order phase transition between the liquid and gaseous phases ends
at a critical point. Critical opalescence occurs at this singularity.
Discovered in 1822, it is known to be driven by diverging fluctuations in the
density. During the past two decades, boundaries between the gas-like and
liquid-like regimes have been theoretically proposed and experimentally
explored. Here, we show that fast cooling of near-critical sulfur hexafluoride
(SF$_6$), in presence of Earth's gravity, favors dark opalescence, where
visible photons are not merely scattered, but also absorbed. When the isochore
fluid is quenched across the critical point, its optical transmittance drops by
more than three orders of magnitude in the whole visible range, a feature which
does not occur during slow cooling. We show that transmittance shows a dip at
2eV near the critical point, and the system can host excitons with binding
energies ranging from 0.5 to 4 eV. The spinodal decomposition of the liquid-gas
mixture, by inducing a periodical modulation of the fluid density, can provide
a scenario to explain the emergence of this platform for coupling between light
and matter. The possible formation of excitons and polaritons points to the
irruption of quantum effects in a quintessentially classical context.

<h3>Inducing a Metal-Insulator Transition through Systematic Alterations of  Local Rewriting Rules in a Quantum Graph</h3>

<p>The Anderson localization transition in quantum graphs has garnered
significant recent attention due to its relevance to many-body localization
studies. Typically, graphs are constructed using top-down methods. Here, we
explore a bottom-up approach, employing a simple local rewriting rule to
construct the graph. Through the use of ratio statistics for the energy
spectrum and Kullback-Leibler divergence correlations for the eigenstates,
numerical analysis demonstrates that slight adjustments to the rewriting rule
can induce a transition from a localized to an extended quantum phase. This
extended state exhibits non-ergodic behavior, akin to the non-ergodic extended
phase observed in the Porter-Rosenzweig model and suggested for many-body
localization. Thus, by adapting straightforward local rewriting rules, it
becomes feasible to assemble complex graphs from which desired global quantum
phases emerge. This approach holds promise for numerical investigations and
could be implemented in building optical realizations of complex networks using
optical fibers and beam splitters.

<p>{\alpha}-MnTe is an antiferromagnetic semiconductor with above room
temperature TN = 310 K, which is promising for spintronic applications.
Recently, it was predicted to be an altermagnet, containing bands with
momentum-dependent spin splitting; time-resolved experimental probes of
magnetism in MnTe are therefore important both for understanding the magnetic
structure and potential device applications. We investigate ultrafast spin
dynamics in epitaxial MnTe(001)/InP(111) thin films using the time-resolved
magneto-optical Kerr effect. At room temperature, we observe an oscillation
mode at 55 GHz that does not appear at zero magnetic field. Combining field,
polarization, and temperature dependence, we identify this mode as an acoustic
phonon-coupled magnon, likely originating from inverse stimulated Raman
scattering. Additionally, we observe two optical phonons at 3.6 THz and 4.2
THz, which broaden and redshift with increasing temperature.

<h3>Effect of nonlocal interlayer hopping on wave function in twisted  bilayer graphene</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05025" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05025</a>
<br>
</p><i>Hridis K. Pal</i>
<p>The conventional low-energy theory employed to describe twisted bilayer
graphene (TBG) relies on a local interlayer Hamiltonian. According to this
theory, TBG has the same linear-in-momentum dispersion and spinor wave function
at the Dirac point as single-layer graphene (SLG), albeit with a renormalized
velocity that decreases as the rotation angle between the layers decreases,
eventually reaching zero at the magic angle. In this work, I expand upon this
low-energy theory by including nonlocal terms in the interlayer part of the
Hamiltonian, and explore the consequences at the Dirac point. It is found that
the nonlocality predominantly influences the wave function rather than the
energy spectrum: despite the persistence of the linear-in-momentum dispersion
with a renormalized velocity, the wave functions no longer mirror those of SLG.
Instead, an additional contribution to the phase difference between the
sublattice components of the spinor emerges. This gives rise to interesting
effects in scattering which are demonstrated with a simple example.

<p>Fusion of lipid bilayers in membranes is important in processes from
vesicle-cell interactions (as in drug delivery) to exosome-cell signaling,
while transient transmembrane electric fields are known to occur spontaneously.
Two contacting phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid membranes are known to fuse into
one under external electric fields, suggesting that the interaction between
them is modified by the field as they approach, prior to the fusion event. Here
we measure directly the adhesion energy between dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine
(DMPC) and between distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) surface layers attached
to solid substrates both without and with a transmembrane electric field. We
find a marked pressure-dependent adhesion behavior in the electric field, which
we attribute to fusion intermediates that are formed, shedding new light on
membrane electro-fusion.

<p>Bernal-stacked tetralayer graphene (4LG) exhibits intriguing low-energy
properties, featuring two massive subbands and showcasing diverse features of
topologically distinct, anisotropic Fermi surfaces, including Lifshitz
transitions and trigonal warping. Here, we study the influence of the band
structure on electron dynamics within 4LG using transverse magnetic focusing.
Our analysis reveals two distinct focusing peaks corresponding to the two
subbands. Furthermore, we uncover a pronounced dependence of the focusing
spectra on crystal orientations, indicative of an anisotropic Fermi surface.
Utilizing the semiclassical model, we attribute this orientation-dependent
behavior to the trigonal warping of the band structure. This phenomenon leads
to variations in electron trajectories based on crystal orientation. Our
findings not only enhance our understanding of the dynamics of electrons in
4LG, but also offer a promising method for probing anisotropic Fermi surfaces
in other materials.

<h3>Detailed balance in non-equilibrium dynamics of granular matter:  derivation and implications</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Clara C. Wanjura, Amelie Mayländer, Othmar Marti, Raphael Blumenfeld</i>
<p>Discovering fundamental principles governing the dynamics of granular media
has been a long-standing challenge. Recent predictions of detailed balance
steady states (DBSS), supported by experimental observations in cyclic shear
experiments of planar granular systems, called into question the common belief
that the detailed balance principle is only a feature of equilibrium. Here, we
first show analytically that DBSS in planar granular dynamics arise when a
certain conditional cell order distribution is independent of the condition. We
then demonstrate that this condition is met in rotational shear experiments,
which indeed also give rise to robust DBSS. This suggests that DBSS not only
exist but are also quite common. We also show that, when the unconditional cell
order distribution maximises the entropy, as has been found recently, then this
distribution is determined by a single parameter - the ratio of splitting and
merging rates of cells of any arbitrary order. These results simplify the
modelling of the complex dynamics of planar granular systems to the solution of
recently proposed evolution equations, demonstrating their predictive power.

<p>The Random Sequential Adsorption (RSA) problem holds crucial theoretical and
practical significance, serving as a pivotal framework for understanding and
optimizing particle packing in various scientific and technological
applications. Here the problem of the one-dimensional RSA of k-mers onto a
substrate with correlated defects controlled by uniform and power-law
distributions is theoretically investigated: the coverage fraction is obtained
as a function of the density of defects and several scaling laws are examined.
The results are compared with extensive Monte Carlo simulations and more
traditional methods based on master equations. Emphasis is given in elucidating
the scaling behavior of the fluctuations of the coverage fraction. The
phenomenon of universality breaking and the issues of conventional gaussian
fluctuations and the L\'evy type fluctuations from a simple perspective,
relying on the Central Limit Theorem, are also addressed.

<br>
</p><i>Jin Zhang, Peter W. Voorhees</i>
<p>A large electric field is typically present in anodic or passive oxide films.
Stresses induced by such a large electric field are critical in understanding
the breakdown mechanism of thin oxide films and improving their corrosion
resistance. In this work, we consider electromechanical coupling through the
electrostrictive effect. A continuum model incorporating lattice misfit and
electric field-induced stresses is developed. We perform a linear stability
analysis of the full coupled model and show that, for typical oxides,
neglecting electrostriction underestimates the film's instability, especially
in systems with a large electric field. Moreover, a region where
electrostriction can potentially provide a stabilizing effect is identified,
allowing electrostriction to enhance corrosion resistance. We identified an
equilibrium electric field intrinsic to the system and the corresponding
equilibrium film thickness. The film's stability is very sensitive to the
electric field: a 40 percent deviation from the equilibrium electric field can
change the maximum growth rate by nearly an order of magnitude. Moreover, our
model reduces to classical morphological instability models in the limit of
misfit-only, electrostatic-only, and no-electrostriction cases. Finally, the
effect of various parameters on the film's stability is studied.

<h3>Convergence, and lack of convergence, of phase space distributions to  microcanonical equilibrium</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Casey O. Barkan</i>
<p>It is well known that phase space distribution functions obeying Liouville's
theorem can converge weakly, but not strongly, to the microcanonical
distribution. Similarly, coarse-grained distributions can converge pointwise,
although unlike weak convergence, coarse-graining involves an arbitrary
partition of phase space. We prove a theorem that strengthens the result that
strong convergence cannot occur. Specifically, we show that time evolution is
an isometry for a broad class of metrics of statistical distance on the space
of phase space distributions. We also compare the physical significance of both
weak and strong convergence. Next, we generalize the definition of
coarse-graining to remove the need for a partition of phase space. This
generalized coarse-graining is similar to E.T. Jaynes' maximum entropy
distribution, but with an important difference. Much of the literature on the
dynamics of phase space distributions is focused on providing a rigorous
description of thermalization and the 2nd law of thermodynamics; meanwhile, a
separate body of literature questions the relevance of weak convergence to
thermalization. We aim to clarify this disagreement by specifying more clearly
the scenarios in which weak convergence is, and is not, relevant.

<p>Moir\'e superlattices consisting of two-dimensional (2D) materials have
attracted immense attention because of emergent phenomena such as flat
band-induced Mott insulating states and unconventional superconductivity.
However, the effects of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on them have not been fully
explored yet. Here we show that single- and double-bilayer (BL) Sb honeycomb
lattices, referred to as antimonene, forms moir\'e superlattices on a Bi(111)
substrate due to a lattice mismatch. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM)
measurements reveal the presence of spectral peaks near the Fermi level, which
are spatially modulated with the moir\'e period. Angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations
clarifies the surface band structure with saddle points near the Fermi level,
which allows us to attribute the observed STM spectral peaks to the van Hove
singularity. Spin-resolved ARPES measurements also shows that the observed
surface states are Rashba-type spin-polarized. The present work has significant
implications that Fermi surface instability and symmetry breaking may emerge at
low temperatures, where spin degree of freedom and electron correlation will
also play important roles.

<h3>A Fast Analytical Model for Predicting Battery Performance Under Mixed  Kinetic Control</h3>

</p><i>Hongxuan Wang, Fan Wang, Ming Tang</i>
<p>The prediction of battery rate performance traditionally relies on
computation-intensive numerical simulations. While simplified analytical models
have been developed to accelerate the calculation, they usually assume battery
performance to be controlled by a single rate-limiting process, such as solid
diffusion or electrolyte transport. Here, we propose an improved analytical
model that could be applied to battery discharging under mixed control of mass
transport in both solid and electrolyte phases. Compared to previous
single-particle models extended to incorporate the electrolyte kinetics, our
model is able to predict the effect of salt depletion on diminishing the
discharge capacity, a phenomenon that becomes important in thick electrodes
and/or at high rates. The model demonstrates good agreement with the full-order
simulation over a wide range of cell parameters and offers a speedup of over
600 times at the same time. Furthermore, it could be combined with
gradient-based optimization algorithms to very efficiently search for the
optimal battery cell configurations while numerical simulation fails at the
task due to its inability to accurately evaluate the derivatives of the
objective function. The high efficiency and the analytical nature of the model
render it a powerful tool for battery cell design and optimization.

<p>Probing strongly coupled quasiparticle excitations at their intrinsic length
scales offers unique insights into their properties and facilitates the design
of devices with novel functionalities. In this work, we investigate the
formation and emission characteristics of plexcitons, arising from the
interaction between surface plasmons in narrow gold nanotrenches and excitons
in monolayer WSe2. We study this strong plasmon-exciton coupling in both the
far-field and the near-field. Specifically, we observe a Rabi splitting in the
far-field reflection spectra of about 80 meV under ambient conditions,
consistent with our theoretical modeling. Using a custom-designed near-field
probe, we find that plexciton emission originates predominantly from the
lower-frequency branch, which we can directly probe and map the local field
distribution. We precisely determine the plexciton extension, similar to the
trench width, with nanometric precision via collecting spectra at controlled
probe locations. Our work opens exciting prospects for nanoscale mapping and
engineering of plexcitons in complex nanostructures with potential applications
in nanophotonic devices, optoelectronics, and quantum electrodynamics in

<p>Improving the high-temperature performance and low-temperature plasticity of
tantalum (Ta) alloys is a significant scientific challenge. We employed
first-principles calculations to study the interaction between screw
dislocations and solute atoms in the body centered cubic (BCC) structure of Ta,
with a particular focus on solid solution softening and strengthening. We
analyzed the impact of various solute elements on the generalized stacking
fault energy (GSFE), energy barriers within the single-atom column displacement
model, and their interaction with screw dislocations. The results indicate that
Hf and Zr, either individually or in combination, exhibit notable solute
softening effects in BCC Ta, significantly reducing GSFE, energy barriers, and
interaction energies. In contrast, Nb shows relative insensitivity to solute
effects, while Mo, W, and Ir demonstrate solute strengthening effects. The
calculations suggest that the interaction energy between screw dislocations and
solute atoms is a reliable indicator for predicting strengthening and softening
effects. Additionally, we extend these predictions to ternary alloys,
demonstrating that the strengthening and softening phenomena in these materials
can be explained through the electronic work function at the electronic level.

extensive and intensive conjugate variables in equilibrium thermodynamics. This
duality manifests from the distinction between closed and open boundary
conditions of a thermodynamic system, to the relationship between the Internal
Energy and its Legendre transformations, to the point-line duality in
calculating convex hulls versus half-space intersections. Here we focus on the
duality relationships of chemical work, with extensive composition variables,
N, and intensive chemical potentials, {\mu}. In particular, we explore mixed
composition-chemical potential diagrams for oxynitride synthesis, lithium-ion
cathode stability, and oxidation of high-entropy alloys. We further illustrate
how chemical potential diagrams reveal the driving forces for non-equilibrium
growth and dissolution kinetics.

<p>Are quasicrystals stable or metastable? Density functional theory (DFT) is
often used to evaluate thermodynamic stability, but quasicrystals are
long-range aperiodic and their energies cannot be calculated using conventional
ab initio methods. Here, we perform first-principles calculations on
quasicrystal nanoparticles of increasing sizes, from which we can directly
extrapolate their bulk and surface energies. Using this technique, we determine
with high confidence that the icosahedral quasicrystals ScZn7.33 and YbCd5.7
are ground-state phases--revealing that translational symmetry is not a
necessary condition for the T = 0 K stability of inorganic solids. Although we
find the ScZn7.33 quasicrystal to be thermodynamically stable, we show on a
mixed thermodynamic and kinetic phase diagram that its solidification from the
melt is nucleation-limited, which illustrates why even stable materials may be
kinetically challenging to grow. Our techniques here broadly open the door to
first-principles investigations into the structure-bonding-stability
relationships of aperiodic materials.

<p>Phase boundaries on high-dimensional phase diagrams are also high-dimensional
objects, and can represent phase coexistence between numerous phases
simultaneously. On a 2D temperature-pressure phase diagram, phase boundaries
are 1D lines separating two phases, with a slope given by the
Clausius-Clapeyron relation, dP/dT = {\Delta}S/{\Delta}V. Here, we derive a
parametric form of the Clausius-Clapeyron relation that readily scales to
high-dimensional phase boundaries. The gradient of a phase boundary guides us
on how to increase or decrease the relative stability of a target compound,
meaning this generalized Clausius-Clapeyron relation enables us to engineer
relative stability with respect to multiple thermodynamic conditions
simultaneously. Using this approach, we analyze the acid stability of manganese

state in real space. To investigate this effect, we calculate the linear
optical conductivity by calculating the real-time evolution of the Kondo
lattice model on the triangular lattice, which hosts an all-in/all-out magnetic
structure. In the linear conductivity spectra, we observe multiple peaks below
the bandgap regime, attributed to the resonant contributions of collective
modes similar to the skyrmionic system, alongside broadband modifications
resulting from off-resonant spin dynamics. The result shows that the collective
excitation, similar to the skyrmionic system, influences the optical response
of the electron systems based on symmetry analysis. We elucidate the
interference between the contributions from the different spin excitations to
the optical conductivity in the multiple spin texture, pointing out the
mode-dependent electrical activity. We show the complex interplay between the

applications. Due to hBN's 2D nature, spin center in hBN can be engineered in
close proximity to target material, providing advantages over their 3D
counterparts, such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Here we propose
a novel quantum sensing protocol driven by exchange interaction between spin
center in hBN and the underlying magnetic substrate induced by magnetic
proximity effect. By first-principle calculation, we demonstrate the induced
exchange interaction dominates over dipole-dipole interaction by orders of
magnitude when in proximity. The interaction remains antiferromagnetic across
all stacking configuration between the spin center in hBN and the target van
der Waals magnets. Additionally, we explored the scaling behavior of the
exchange field as a function of the spatial separation between the spin center
and the targets.

<p>Healthy articular cartilage has excellent lubricating properties, with
friction coefficients reaching extremely low values at physiological pressures.
Such high-performing lubricating layer in joints is attributed to the surface
hydration arising from the interplay between multiple hydrophilic biopolymers
(such as hyaluronic acid, proteoglycans, and lubricin) and phospholipids in the
cartilage matrix. Mimicking such molecular structure, hydrogels, composed of a
hydrophilic polymer network, have the potential to replicate the lubricating
feature and possibly replace natural cartilages. In this study, we have
synthesized a poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl
phosphorylcholine-co-N-isopropylacrylamide) (PMPC-co-PNIPAM, PMN)random
copolymer with highly-hydrated lubricious 2-methacryloyloxyethyl
phosphorylcholine moieties and less hydrated N-isopropylacrylamide moieties.
Incorporation of PMN copolymers within various hydrogels significantly reduces
the gels sliding surface friction, resulting in low friction coefficients
against different counter surfaces, including stainless steel (hard metal
surface), polyethylene (hydrophobic surface), and polyHEMA (soft hydrogel
surface). Additionally, hydrogels containing PMN are shown to be biocompatible
and have excellent antifouling properties, making them an ideal coating for
commercially available stents. With these qualities, hydrogels containing PMN
stand out as a promising new material with numerous possible applications.

<h3>Hidden charge density wave induced shadow bands and ultrafast dynamics  of CuTe investigated using time-resolved ARPES</h3>

<p>Revealing the fine electronic structure is critical for understanding the
underlying physics of low-dimensional materials. Angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) is a powerful experimental technique for mapping out the
experimental electronic structure. By reducing the photon energy (e.g. to 6 eV)
using laser sources, a greatly improved momentum resolution can be achieved,
thereby providing opportunities for ``zooming in'' the fine electronic
structure and even revealing the previously unresolvable bands near the
Brillouin zone center. Here, by using quasi-one-dimensional material CuTe as an
example, we demonstrate the unique capability of laser-based ARPES in revealing
the fine electronic structures of ``hidden'' charge density wave induced shadow
bands near the Brillouin zone center, which are previously unresolvable using
synchrotron sources. The observation of the shadow bands reveals the CDW phase
from the aspect of band folding, and the unpredicted CDW band hybridization
strongly modifies the electronic structure and Fermi surface, which suggests
that such hybridization must be taken into account for studying the CDW
transition. Moreover, the ultrafast non-equilibrium carrier dynamics are
captured by time-resolved ARPES, revealing the relaxation dynamics through
electron-phonon scattering. Our work demonstrates the advantages of laser-based
ARPES in zooming in the fine electronic structures, as well as capturing the
ultrafast dynamics of low-dimensional materials.

<h3>Cooling dynamics of a free ion in a Bose-Einstein condensate</h3>

<p>We investigate the dynamics of an ion moving through a homogeneous
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) after an initial momentum is imparted. For this,
we derive a master equation in the weak-coupling limit and Lamb-Dicke
approximation for the reduced density matrix of the ion. We study the time
evolution of the ion's kinetic energy and observe that its expectation value,
identified as the ion temperature $T_\mathrm{ion}$, is reduced by several
orders of magnitude in a time on the order of microseconds for a condensate
density in the experimentally relevant range between
$10^{13}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and $10^{14}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. We characterize
this behavior by defining the duration at half maximum as the time required by
$T_\mathrm{ion}$ to reach half of its initial value, and study its dependence
on the system parameters. Similarly, we find that the expectation value of the
ion's momentum operator is reduced by nine orders of magnitude on the same
timescale, making the ion's position converge to a final value. Based on these
results, we conclude that the interaction with the bosonic bath allows for
cooling and pinning of the ion by decreasing the expectation value of its
kinetic energy and velocity, which constitutes a result of direct relevance for
current atom-ion experiments.

<p>Optical orientation of carrier spins by circularly polarized light is the
basic concept and tool of spin physics in semiconductors. We study the optical
orientation of electrons and holes in a crystal of the
FA$_{0.9}$Cs$_{0.1}$PbI$_{2.8}$Br$_{0.2}$ lead halide perovskite by means of
polarized photoluminescence, time-resolved differential reflectivity, and
time-resolved Kerr rotation. At the cryogenic temperature of 1.6 K the optical
orientation degree measured for continuous-wave excitaton reaches 6\% for
localized electrons and 2\% for localized holes. Their contributions are
distinguished from each other and from exciton optical orientation through the
pronounced Hanle effect in transverse magnetic fields and the polarization
recovery effect in longitudinal magnetic fields. The optical orientation degree
is highly stable against detuning of the laser photon energy from the band gap
by up to 0.25 eV, showing then a gradual decrease for detunings up to 0.9 eV.
This evidences the inefficiency of spin relaxation mechanisms for free carriers
during their energy relaxation. Spin relaxation for localized electrons and
holes is provided by the hyperfine interaction with the nuclear spins. Dynamic
polarization of nuclear spins is demonstrated by the Overhauser field reaching
4 mT acting on the electrons and $-76$ mT acting on the holes. This confirms
the specifics of lead halide perovskite semiconductors, where the hole
hyperfine interaction with the nuclei considerably exceeds that of the
electron.

<p>Controlled engineering of vortex pinning sites in copper-oxide
superconductors is a critical issue in manufacturing devices based on magnetic
flux quanta. To address this, we employed a focused He-ion beam (He-FIB) to
irradiate thin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films and create ultradense
hexagonal arrays of defects with lattice spacings as small as 20 nm. Critical
current and magnetoresistance measurements demonstrate efficient pinning by an
unprecedentedly high matching field of 6 T visible in a huge temperature range
from the critical temperature $T_c$ down to 2 K. These results show that He-FIB
irradiation provides excellent opportunities for the development and
application of superconducting fluxonic devices based on Abrikosov vortices. In
particular, our findings suggest that such devices can operate at temperatures
far below $T_c$, where superconductivity is robust.

<h3>Multiple Floquet Chern insulator phases in the spin-charge coupled  triangular-lattice ferrimagnet: Crucial roles of higher-order terms in the  high-frequency expansion</h3>

</p><i>Rintaro Eto, Masahito Mochizuki</i>
<p>We study the effects of photoirradiation with circularly polarized light on
the Dirac half-metal state induced by the ferrimagnetic order in a triangular
Kondo-lattice model. Our analysis based on the Floquet theory reveals that two
types of Floquet Chern insulator phases appear as photoinduced nonequilibrium
steady states and that these two phases can be experimentally detected and
distinguished by measurements of the Hall conductivity. It is elucidated that
these rich nonequilibrium topological phases come from higher-order terms in
the high-frequency expansion called Brillouin-Wigner expansion, which is in
striking contrast to usually discussed Floquet Chern insulator phases
originating from the lowest-order terms of the expansion. So far, the lattice
electron models on simple non-multipartite lattices such as triangular lattices
and square lattices have not been regarded as targets of the Floquet
engineering because the lowest-order terms of the high-frequency expansion for
Floquet effective Hamiltonians cancel each other to vanish in these systems.
Our findings of the Floquet Chern insulator phases in a triangular
Kondo-lattice model are expected to expand the range of potential models and
even materials targeted by the Floquet engineering.

<p>Rock weathering is a common phenomenon in most engineering applications, such
as underground storage or geothermal energy. This work offers a discrete
element modelization of the problem considering cohesive granular material and
debonding effect. Oedometer conditions are applied during the weathering and
the evolution of the coefficient of lateral earth pressure, a proxy of the
state of stress, is tracked. Especially, the influence of the degree of
cementation, the confining pressure, the initial value of k0 and the history of
load are investigated. It has been emphasized that the granular media aims to
reach an attractor configuration. And the grain reorganization occurring is
divided into two main phenomena: the collapse of the unstable chain forces
(stable only thanks to the cementation) and the softening of the grains.

<br>
</p><i>Giulia Pisegna, Suropriya Saha, Ramin Golestanian</i>
<p>Phenomenological rules that govern the collective behaviour of complex
physical systems are powerful tools because they can make concrete predictions
about their universality class based on generic considerations, such as
symmetries, conservation laws, and dimensionality. While in most cases such
considerations are manifestly ingrained in the constituents, novel
phenomenology can emerge when composite units associated with emergent
symmetries dominate the behaviour of the system. We study a generic class of
active matter systems with non-reciprocal interactions and demonstrate the
existence of true long-range polar order in two dimensions and above, both at
the linear level and by including all relevant nonlinearities in the
Renormalization Group sense. We achieve this by uncovering a mapping of our
scalar active mixture theory to the Toner-Tu theory of dry polar active matter
by employing a suitably defined polar order parameter. We then demonstrate that
the complete effective field theory -- which includes all the soft modes and
the relevant nonlinear terms -- belongs to the (Burgers-) Kardar-Parisi-Zhang
universality class. This classification allows us to prove the stability of the
emergent polar long-range order in scalar non-reciprocal mixtures in two
dimensions, and hence a conclusive violation of the Mermin-Wagner theorem.

<p>Hafnium Nitride (HfN) is a promising and very robust alternative to gold for
applications of nanoscale metals. Details of the nanomorphology related to
variations in strain states and optical properties can be crucial for
applications in nanophotonics and plasmon-assisted chemistry. We use ultrafast
reciprocal space mapping (URSM) with hard x-rays to unveil the nanomorphology
of thin HfN films. Static high-resolution x-ray diffraction reveals a twofold
composition of the thin films being separated into regions with identical
lattice constant and similar out-of-plane but hugely different in-plane
coherence lengths. URSM upon femtosecond laser excitation reveals different
transient strain dynamics for the two respective Bragg peak components. This
unambiguously locates the longer in-plane coherence length in the first 15\,nm
of the thin film adjacent to the substrate. The transient shift of the broad
diffraction peak displays the strain dynamics of the entire film, implying that
the near-substrate region hosts nanocrystallites with small and large coherence
length, whereas the upper part of the film grows in small columnar grains. Our
results illustrate that URSM is a suitable technique for non-destructive
investigations of the depth-resolved nanomorphology of nanostructures.

<p>Water surfaces catalyze some organic reactions more effectively, making them
unique for 2D organic material synthesis. This report introduces a new
synthesis method via surfactant-monolayer-assisted interfacial synthesis on
water surfaces for ring-opening polymerization of pyrrole, producing distinct
polypyrrole derivatives with polyacetylene backbones and ionic substitutions.
The synthesis result in quasi 2D polyacetylene (q2DPA) film with enhanced

measurements using pulsed laser light of tunable wavelength for photoexcitation
of the charge carriers within the q2DPA film. The charge transport was measured
in the lateral direction as a function of external bias voltage ranging from 0
V to 200 V. We observed high electron mobility ({\mu}) of q2DPA reaching values
of 375 cm2 V-1 s-1 at bias voltage Vb = -20V and photon energy of 3.8 eV.

<h3>Solving quantum impurity problems on the L-shaped Kadanoff-Baym contour</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Ruofan Chen, Chu Guo</i>
<p>The path integral formalism is the building block of many powerful numerical
methods for quantum impurity problems. However, existing path integral based
numerical calculations have only been performed in either the imaginary-time or
the real-time axis, while the most generic scenario formulated on the L-shaped
Kadanoff-Baym contour is left unexplored. In this work, we extended the
recently developed Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator (GTEMPO)
method to solve quantum impurity problems directly on the Kadanoff-Baym
contour. The resulting method is numerically exact, with only two sources of
numerical errors, e.g., the time discretization error and the matrix product
state bond truncation error, which can both be well controlled. The accuracy of
this method is numerically demonstrated against exact solutions in the
noninteracting case, and against existing calculations on the real- and
imaginary-time axes for the single-orbital Anderson impurity model. Our method
is a perfect benchmarking baseline for its alternatives which often employ
less-controlled approximations, and can also be used as a real-time impurity
solver in dynamical mean field theory and its non-equilibrium extension.

<p>Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are spatially localized states with
energy embedded in the continuum spectrum of extended states. The combination
of BICs physics and nontrivial band topology theory giving rise to topological
BICs, which are robust against disorders and meanwhile of the merit of
conventional BICs, is attracting wide attention recently. Here, we report
valley edge states as topological BICs, which appear at domain wall between two
distinct valley topological phases. The robustness of such BICs is
demonstrated. The simulations and experiments show great agreement. Our
findings of valley related topological BICs shed light on both BICs and valley
physics, and may foster innovative applications of topological acoustic

<p>Active systems -- including sperm cells, living organisms like bacteria,
fish, birds, or active soft matter systems like synthetic ''microswimmers'' --
are characterized by motility, i.e., the ability to propel using their own
''engine''. Motility is the key feature that distinguishes active systems from
passive or externally driven systems. In a large ensemble, motility of
individual species can vary in a wide range. Selecting active species according
to their motility represents an exciting and challenging problem. We propose a
new method for selecting active species based on their motility using an
acoustofluidic setup where highly motile species escape from the acoustic trap.
This is demonstrated in simulations and in experiments with self-propelled
Janus particles and human sperm. The immediate application of this method is
selecting highly motile sperm for medically assisted reproduction (MAR). Due to
the tunable acoustic trap, the proposed method is more flexible than the
existing passive microfluidic methods. The proposed selection method based on
motility can also be applied to other active systems that require selecting
highly motile species or removing immotile species.

<p>The burgeoning fields of spintronics and topological electronics require
materials possessing a unique combination of properties: ferromagnetism,
metallicity, and chemical stability. SrRuO3 (SRO) stands out as a compelling
candidate due to its exceptional combination of these attributes. However,
understanding its behavior under tensile strain, especially its
thickness-dependent changes, remains elusive. This study employs
machine-learning-assisted molecular beam epitaxy to investigate SRO films with
thicknesses from 1 to 10 nm. This work complements the existing focus on
compressive-strained SRO, opening a new avenue for exploring its hitherto
concealed potential. Using soft X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, we uncover
an intriguing interplay between film thickness, electronic structure, and
magnetic properties. Our key findings reveal an intensified localization of Ru
4d t2g-O 2p hybridized states at lower thicknesses, attributed to the weakened
orbital hybridization. Furthermore, we find a progressive reduction of magnetic
moments for both Ru and O ions as film thickness decreases. Notably, a
non-ferromagnetic insulating state emerges at a critical thickness of 1 nm,
marking a pivotal transition from the metallic ferromagnetic phase. These
insights emphasize the importance of considering thickness-dependent properties
when tailoring SRO for next-generation spintronic and topological electronic
devices.

<p>The dipole-dipole interactions between excitons are of paramount importance
in the nanoscale structures. When two excitons are placed together they can
exchange the energy can manifest in the resonant Raman cross sections. We
provide theoretical framework for such effects by combining the coupled
oscillator model and perturbation theory. We apply this theory to a hybrid film
comprising semiconducting quantum dots and metallic carbon nanotubes. The
quantum dots exciton has a fixed energy, while the nanotube resonances span
across a larger range from 1.7 to \SI{1.93}{eV}. We acquire the resonant Raman
profiles of the pristine nanotubes and hybrids and find a relative shift
between them. The shift direction depends on the relative energies between the
CNT and QD exciton energies, as predicted by our theory.

increasing rotation frequency at constant atom number and temperature. We
detect the vortex positions and study the order of the lattice using the pair
correlation function and the orientational correlation function. We evidence
the melting transition by an abrupt change in the decay of orientational

<p>We provide a theoretical framework to describe the quantum many-body dynamics
of Andreev states in Josephson junctions with spin-orbit coupling and a

description is technically advantageous but one then has to be careful to avoid
double-counting problems. By deriving the Lindblad master equation in the
socalled excitation picture, we show that a physically consistent many-body
theory free from doublecounting problems follows. We apply our formalism to a
study of dynamical parity stabilization of the Andreev sector at intermediate
times after an initial microwave pulse, in particular addressing the combined
effects of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman field.

<p>Moir\'e materials provide a unique platform for studies of correlated
many-body physics of the Fermi-Hubbard model on triangular spin-charge
lattices. Bilayer Hubbard models are of particular significance with regard to
the physics of Mott insulating states and their relation to unconventional
superconductivity, yet their experimental implementation in moir\'e systems has
so far remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate the realization of a staggered
bilayer triangular lattice of electrons in an antiparallel MoSe$_{2}$/WS$_{2}$
heterostructure. The bilayer lattice emerges due to strong electron confinement
in the moir\'e potential minima and the near-resonant alignment of conduction
band edges in MoSe$_{2}$ and WS$_{2}$. As a result, charge filling proceeds
layer-by-layer, with the first and second electron per moir\'e cell
consecutively occupying first the MoSe$_{2}$ and then the WS$_{2}$ layer. We
describe the observed charging sequence by an electrostatic model and provide
experimental evidence of spin correlations on the vertically offset and
laterally staggered bilayer lattice, yielding absolute exciton Land\'e factors
as high as $600$ at lowest temperatures. The bilayer character of the
implemented spin-charge lattice allows for electrostatic tunability of
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida magnetism, and establishes antiparallel
MoSe$_{2}$/WS$_{2}$ heterostructures as a viable platform for studies of
bilayer Hubbard model physics with exotic magnetic phases on frustrated

<p>The development of superconducting electronics requires careful
characterization of the components that make up electronic circuits.
Superconducting weak links are the building blocks of most superconducting
electronics components and are characterized by highly nonlinear
current-to-phase relations (CPR), which are often not perfectly known. Recent
research has found that the Josephson diode effect (JDE) can be related to the
high harmonic content of the current-to-phase relation of the weak links
embedded in superconducting interferometers. This makes the JDE a natural tool
for exploring the harmonic content of weak links beyond single-harmonic CPR. In
this study, we present the theoretical model and experimental characterization
of a double-loop superconducting quantum interference device (DL-SQUID) that
embeds all-metallic superconductor-normal metal-superconductor junctions. The
proposed device exhibits the JDE due to the interference of the supercurrents
of three weak links in parallel, and this feature can be adjusted through two
magnetic fluxes, which act as experimental knobs. We carry out a theoretical
study of the device in terms of the relative weight of the interferometer arms
and the experimental characterization concerning flux tunability and

coexisting magnon excitations remain a puzzle. Here, by incorporating the
spin-lattice coupling and the consequent four-spin interactions through the
site-phonon model, we accomplish a unified description of the molecular and
magnon excitations, revealing the molecular modes as statistical approximations
of the dispersive magnon excitations. Our work demonstrates a general approach
to understand exotic spin dynamics in magnetoelastic systems.

<p>Twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) provides a fascinating platform for
engineering flat bands and inducing correlated phenomena. By designing the
stacking architecture of graphene layers, twisted multilayer graphene can
exhibit different symmetries with rich tunability. For example, in twisted
monolayer-bilayer graphene (tMBG) which breaks the C2z symmetry, transport
measurements reveal an asymmetric phase diagram under an out-of-plane electric
field, exhibiting correlated insulating state and ferromagnetic state
respectively when reversing the field direction. Revealing how the electronic
structure evolves with electric field is critical for providing a better
understanding of such asymmetric field-tunable properties. Here we report the
experimental observation of field-tunable dichotomic electronic structure of
tMBG by nanospot angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (NanoARPES) with
operando gating. Interestingly, selective enhancement of the relative spectral
weight contributions from monolayer and bilayer graphene is observed when
switching the polarity of the bias voltage. Combining experimental results with
theoretical calculations, the origin of such field-tunable electronic
structure, resembling either tBLG or twisted double-bilayer graphene (tDBG), is
attributed to the selectively enhanced contribution from different stacking
graphene layers with a strong electron-hole asymmetry. Our work provides
electronic structure insights for understanding the rich field-tunable physics
of tMBG.

<h3>Overcomplete intermediate representation of two-particle Green's  functions and its relation to partial spectral functions</h3>

<p>Two-particle response functions are a centerpiece of both experimental and
theoretical quantum many-body physics. Yet, due to their size and discontinuity
structure, they are challenging to handle numerically. Recently, two advances
were made to tackle this problem: first, the overcomplete intermediate
representation (OIR), which provides a highly efficient compression of Green's
functions in imaginary frequency, and second, partial spectral functions
(PSFs), which allow for an efficient evaluation in real frequency. We show that
there is a two-to-one correspondence between PSFs and OIR coefficients and
exploit this fact to construct the OIR for three-or-more-particle propagators.
We then use OIR to fit and compress imaginary-frequency data obtained from the
numerical renormalization group (NRG), reaching a compression ratio of more
than 400. Finally, we attempt to match the OIR data to partial Green's
functions from NRG.Due to the overcompleteness, we achieve only qualitative
agreement.

<h3>Giant photocaloric effects across a vast temperature range in  ferroelectric perovskites</h3>

<p>Solid-state cooling presents an energy-efficient and environmentally friendly
alternative to traditional refrigeration technologies that rely on
thermodynamic cycles involving greenhouse gases. However, conventional caloric
effects face several challenges that impede their practical application in
refrigeration devices. Firstly, operational temperature conditions must align
closely with zero-field phase transition points; otherwise, the required
driving fields become excessively large. But phase transitions occur
infrequently near room temperature. Additionally, caloric effects typically
exhibit strong temperature dependence and are sizeable only within relatively
narrow temperature ranges. In this study, we employ first-principles simulation
methods to demonstrate that light-driven phase transitions in polar oxide
perovskites have the potential to overcome such limitations. Specifically, for
the prototypical ferroelectric KNbO$_{3}$ we illustrate the existence of giant
photocaloric effects induced by light absorption ($\Delta S_{\rm PC} \sim
100$~J~K$^{-1}$~kg$^{-1}$ and $\Delta T_{\rm PC} \sim 10$~K) across a vast
temperature range of several hundred Kelvin, encompassing room temperature.
These findings are expected to be generalizable to other materials exhibiting
similar polar behavior.

<h3>Wetting on Silicone Surfaces</h3>

<p>Silicone is frequently used as a model system to investigate and tune wetting
on soft materials. Silicone is biocompatible and shows excellent thermal,
chemical, and UV stability. Moreover, the mechanical properties of the surface
can be easily varied by several orders of magnitude in a controlled manner.
Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a popular choice for coating applications such
as lubrication, self-cleaning, and drag reduction, facilitated by low surface
energy. Aiming to understand the underlying interactions and forces, motivated
numerous and detailed investigations of the static and dynamic wetting behavior
of drops on PDMS-based surfaces. Here, we recognize the three most prevalent
PDMS surface variants, namely liquid-infused (SLIPS/LIS), elastomeric, and
liquid-like (SOCAL) surfaces. To understand, optimize, and tune the wetting
properties of these PDMS surfaces, we review and compare their similarities and
differences by discussing (i) the chemical and molecular structure, and (ii)
the static and dynamic wetting behavior. We also provide (iii) an overview of
methods and techniques to characterize PDMS-based surfaces and their wetting
behavior. The static and dynamic wetting ridge is given particular attention,
as it dominates energy dissipation, adhesion, and friction of sliding drops and
influences the durability of the surfaces. We also discuss special features
such as cloaking and wetting-induced phase separation. Key challenges and
opportunities of these three surface variants are outlined.

<h3>Prediction of topotactic transition from black to blue phosphorus  induced by surface Br adsorption</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Hao Tian, Wenjun Xie, Maohai Xie, Chuanhui Zhu, Hu Xu, Shuk-Yin Tong</i>
<p>Based on first-principles calculations, we propose a potential access to the
yet unrealized freestanding blue phosphorus (blueP) through transformation of
black phosphorus (blackP) induced by surface bromine (Br) adsorption. Formation
of the Br-P bonds disrupts the original sp3 configurations in blackP, generates
unpaired pz electrons and induces a structural transformation that results in
blueP formation by re-pairing the pz orbitals. Ab initio molecular dynamics
simulations confirm that randomly adsorbed Br adatoms on bilayer blackP
spontaneously diffuse into specific patterns to render the emergence of the
blueP phase. The expected obtainment Br-passivated blueP nanoribbons exhibit
tunable band gaps in a wide range and high carrier mobilities of the order of
1000 cm2V-1s-1. This study provides an opportunity to fabricate blueP through
the conversion from blackP by tuning its surface chemistry.

<h3>Spin Radiation of Electrons, Excitons, and Phonons</h3>

</p><i>Chengyuan Cai, Tao Yu</i>
<p>In the celebrated Stern-Gerlach experiment an inhomogeneous static magnetic
field separates a beam of charge-neutral atoms with opposite spins, thereby
driving a ``spin current" normal to the propagation direction. Here we
generalize it to the dynamic scenario by demonstrating a spin transfer between
an AC inhomogeneous magnetic field and intraband electrons or charge-neutral
excitons and phonons. We predict that parametric pumping can efficiently
radiate their DC spin currents from local AC magnetic sources with van der
Waals semiconductors as prototypes. This mechanism brings a unified and
efficient paradigm in the spin transport of distinct mobile carriers.

<h3>Towards an understanding of particle-scale flaws and microstructure  evolution in cold-spray via accumulation of single particle impacts</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05601" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05601</a>
<br>
</p><i>Alain Reiser, Christopher Allan Schuh</i>
<p>Cold spray coatings are the sum of countless individual bonding events
between single particles impacting on top of one another at high velocities.
Thus, the collective behavior of microparticles must be considered to elucidate
the origins of coating flaws at the scale of the particles and larger, or the
dynamic evolution of the overall coating microstructure. Laser-induced particle
impact testing (LIPIT) has been extensively used to study single-particle
impacts, and in this work is adapted to study the accumulation of numerous
particles with knowledge of each individual particle's impact parameters
(particle size, velocity). The method reproducibly deposits stacks of gold
particles (>20 particles) with different characteristic spectra of impact
velocity. The quantitative single-particle data are analyzed in a correlative
manner to the structure and flaws in the resulting stacks, providing some first
semi-quantitative connections between, e.g., strain and recrystallization, or
aberrant particle characteristics and defects. The results highlight
opportunities for the study of many-particle phenomena in microparticle
impact--from interaction of particles in cold spray to multi-step erosion
processes--with a quantitative view of the behavior of single particles.

<h3>Spin conductances and magnetization production in chiral molecular  junctions</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Richard Korytár, Jan M. van Ruitenbeek, Ferdinand Evers</i>
<p>Motivated by experimental reports on chirality induced spin selectivity, we
investigate a minimal model that allows us to calculate the charge and spin
conductances through helical molecules analytically. The spin-orbit interaction
is assumed to be non-vanishing on the molecule and negligible in the reservoirs
(leads). The band-structure of the molecule features four helical modes with
spin-momentum locking that are analogous of edge-currents in the quantum spin
Hall effect. While charge is conserved and therefore the charge current is
independent of where it is measured, - reservoirs or molecule, - our detailed
calculations reveal that the spin currents in the left and right lead are equal
in magnitudes but with opposite signs (in linear response).
We predict that transport currents flowing through helical molecules are
accompanied by a spin accumulation in the contact region with the same
magnetization direction for source and drain. Further, we predict that the
spin-conductance can be extracted directly from measuring the (quasi-static)
spin accumulation - rather than the spin current itself, which is very
challenging to obtain experimentally.

<p>Motivated by recent numerical studies reporting putative quantum paramagnetic
behavior in spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg models on the maple-leaf lattice, we classify
Abrikosov fermion mean-field Ans\"atze of fully symmetric $U(1)$ and
$\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquids within the framework of projective
symmetry groups. We obtain a total of $17$ $U(1)$ and $12$ $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
algebraic PSGs, and, upon restricting their realization via mean-field
Ans\"atze with nearest-neighbor amplitudes (relevant to the studied models),
only 12 $U(1)$ and 8 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ distinct phases are obtained. We present
both singlet and triplet fields for all Ans\"atze up to third nearest-neighbor
bonds and discuss their spinon dispersions as well as their dynamical spin
structure factors. We further assess the effects of Gutzwiller projection on
the equal-time spin structure factors, and identify a $U(1)$ Fermi surface spin
liquid whose structure factor most closely reproduces the one obtained from
pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group calculations.

<h3>Why does silicon have an indirect band gap?</h3>

</p><i>Emily Oliphant, Veda Mantena, Madison Brod, G. Jeffrey Snyder, Wenhao Sun</i>
<p>Density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful tool for predicting the
electronic band structures of functional materials. However, it is often
difficult to intuit how major band structure features$-$such as band gap
magnitude, location of band extrema, effective masses, etc.$-$arise from the
underlying crystal chemistry of a material. Band structure is represented in
reciprocal space, but arises from the orbital and bonding interactions between
atoms in real space. Here, we present a conceptual and computable framework to
extract chemical bonding origins of DFT-calculated band structure features. As
a key example, we explain here the indirect band gap of silicon, which
profoundly impacts its properties for use in photovoltaics and electronics.
Even in this basic semiconductor material, our approach leads to new insights
to understand and engineer its conduction band minimum position. These
calculation techniques can be broadly applied to reveal the crystal chemistry
origins of electronic structure features in other optical, electronic, and
magnetic materials.

<h3>Confinement controls the creep rate in soft granular packings</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Joshua A. Dijksman, Tom Mullin</i>
<p>Flow in soft materials encompasses a wide range of viscous, plastic and
elastic phenomena which provide challenges to modelling at the microscopic
level. To create a controlled flow, we perform falling ball viscometry tests on
packings of soft, frictionless hydrogel spheres. Systematic creep flow is found
when a controlled driving stress is applied to a sinking sphere embedded in a
packing. Here, we take the novel approach of applying an additional global
confinement stress to the packing using an external load. This has enabled us
to identify two distinct creep regimes. When confinement stress is small, the
creep rate is independent of the load imposed. For larger confinement stresses,
we find that the creep rate is set by the mechanical load acting on the
packing. In the latter regime, the creep rate depends exponentially on the
imposed stress. We can combine the two regimes via a rescaling onto a master
curve, capturing the creep rate over five orders of magnitude. Our results
indicate that bulk creep phenomena in these soft materials can be subtly
controlled using an external mechanical force.

</p><i>Paramvir Ahlawat</i>
<p>The efficiency and stability of halide perovskite-based solar cells and
light-emitting diodes directly depend on the intricate dynamics of solid-solid
crystallization[1-23]. In this study, we employ a multi-scale approach using
random phase approximation, density functional theory, machine learning
potentials, reduced charge force fields, and both enhanced sampling biased and
brute-force unbiased molecular dynamics simulations to understand the
solid-solid phase transitions in cesium lead iodide perovskite. Our simulations
uncover that the direct phase transition from the non-perovskite to the
perovskite involves the formation of stacked-faulted and low-dimensional
intermediate structures. Through extensive large-scale all-atom simulations
encompassing up to 650,000 atoms, we observe that solid-solid crystallization
may require the formation of a sufficiently large critical nucleus to grow into
a faceted perovskite crystal. Based on simulations, we determine that utilizing
(100)-faceted seeded crystallization could offer a promising path for
manufacturing high-performance and stable perovskite solar cells.

<h3>Significant Photoluminescence Improvements from Bulk Germanium-Based  Thin Films with Ultra-low Threading Dislocation Densities</h3>

</p><i>Liming Wang, Gideon Kassa, Jifeng Liu, Guangrui Xia</i>
<p>Bulk Ge crystals, characterized by significantly lower threading dislocation
densities (TDD) than their epitaxial counterparts, emerge as optimal candidates
for studying and improving Ge laser performance. Our study focused on the Ge
thickness and TDD impacts on Ge's photoluminescence (PL). The PL peak intensity
of a bulk Ge sample (TDD = 6000 cm^(-2), n-doping = 10^16 cm^(-3)) experiences
a remarkable 32-fold increase as the thickness is reduced from 535 to 2 micron.
This surpasses the PL peak intensity of a 0.75 micron thick epi-Ge on Si
(biaxial tensile strain= 0.2 %, n-doping = 10^19 cm^(-3)) by a factor of 2.5.
Furthermore, the PL peak intensity of a 405 micron thick zero-TDD bulk Ge
sample (n-doping = 5 * 10^17 cm^(-3)) is ten times that of the 0.75 micron
thick epi-Ge, rising to twelve times when thinned to 1 micron. The TDD
reduction method is highly effective, which relaxes the requirements of high
n-doping and stress in enhancing Ge laser performance and thus reduces the side
effects of high optical absorption, high non-radiative recombination, bandgap
narrowing, and large footprints associated with these two techniques.

<h3>Global phase diagram of doped quantum spin liquid on the Kagome lattice</h3>

<p>It has long been believed that doped quantum spin liquids (QSLs) can give
rise to fascinating quantum phases, including the possibility of
high-temperature superconductivity (SC) as proposed by P. W. Anderson's
resonating valence bond (RVB) scenario. The Kagome lattice $t$-$J$ model is
known to exhibit spin liquid behavior at half-filling, making it an ideal
system for studying the properties of doped QSL. In this study, we employ the
fermionic projected entangled simplex state (PESS) method to investigate the
ground state properties of the Kagome lattice $t$-$J$ model with $t/J = 3.0$.
Our results reveal a phase transition from charge density wave (CDW) states to
uniform states around a critical doping level $\delta_c \approx 0.27$. Within
the CDW phase, we observe different types of Wigner crystal (WC) formulated by
doped holes that are energetically favored. As we enter the uniform phase, a
non-Fermi liquid (NFL) state emerges within the doping range $0.27 < \delta <
0.32$, characterized by an exponential decay of all correlation functions. With
further hole doping, we discover the appearance of a pair density wave (PDW)
state within a narrow doping region $0.32 < \delta < 1/3$. We also discuss the
potential experimental implications of our findings.

<p>We introduce the Chebyshev pseudosite matrix product state approach
(ChePSMPS) as a solver for cluster perturbation theory (CPT), crucial for
simulating spectral functions in two-dimensional electron-phonon ($e$-ph)
coupling systems. ChePSMPS distinguishes itself from conventional exact
diagonalization solvers by supporting larger clusters, thereby significantly
mitigating finite-size effects. Free from the fermion sign problem, ChePSMPS
enhances its ability to explore $e$-ph effects and generate high-resolution
spectral functions in doped Mott insulators. We use this method to simulate the
spectra for both one- and two-dimensional Hubbard-Holstein models, highlighting
its superiority over other methods. Our findings validate ChePSMPS as a
powerful and reliable Green's function solver. In conjunction with embedding
methods, ChePSMPS emerges as an essential tool for simulating strongly
correlated $e$-ph coupling systems.

<h3>Higher Landau-Level Analogues and Signatures of Non-Abelian States in  Twisted Bilayer MoTe$_2$</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Chong Wang, Xiao-Wei Zhang, Xiaoyu Liu, Jie Wang, Ting Cao, Di Xiao</i>
<p>Recent experimental discovery of fractional Chern insulators at zero magnetic
field in moir\'e superlattices has sparked intense interests in bringing Landau
level physics to flat Chern bands. In twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers (tMoTe$_2$),
recent theoretical and experimental studies have found three consecutive flat
Chern bands at twist angle $\sim 2^\circ$. In this work, we investigate whether
higher Landau level physics can be found in these consecutive Chern bands. At
twist angles $2.00^\circ$ and $1.89^\circ$, we identify four consecutive $C =
1$ bands for the $K$ valley in tMoTe$_2$. By constructing Wannier functions
directly from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a six-orbital model
is developed to describe the consecutive Chern bands, with the orbitals forming
a honeycomb lattice. Exact diagonalization on top of Hartree-Fock calculations
are carried out with the Wannier functions. Especially, when the second moir\'e
miniband is half-filled, signatures of non-Abelian states are found. Our
Wannier-based approach in modelling moir\'e superlattices is faithful to DFT
wave functions and can serve as benchmarks for continuum models. The
possibility of realizing non-Abelian anyons at zero magnetic field also opens
up a new pathway for fault-tolerant quantum information processing.

<p>The ground states of interacting one-dimensional metals are generically
Luttinger liquids. Luttinger liquid theory is usually considered for
translation invariant systems. The Luttinger liquid description remains valid
for weak quasiperiodic modulations; however, as the quasiperiodic modulation
gets increasingly strong, it is increasingly renormalized and eventually fails,
as the system becomes localized. We explore how quasiperiodic modulation
renormalizes the Luttinger parameter characterizing this emergent Luttinger
liquid, using the renormalization of transmission coefficients across a barrier
as a proxy that remains valid for general quasiperiodic modulation. We find,
unexpectedly, that quasiperiodic modulation weakens the effects of short-range
interactions, but enhances those of long-range interactions. We support the
former finding with matrix-product numerics. We also discuss how interactions
affect the localization phase boundary.

<p>Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) represents a highly tunable, strongly
correlated electron system owed to its unique flat electronic bands. However,
understanding the single-particle band structure alone has been challenging due
to complex lattice reconstruction effects and a lack of spectroscopic
measurements over a broad energy range. Here, we probe the band structure of
TBG around the magic angle using infrared spectroscopy. Our measurements reveal
spectral features originating from interband transitions whose energies are
uniquely defined by the twist angle. By combining with quantum transport, we
connect spectral features over a broad energy range (10 to 700 meV) spanning
several superlattice minibands and track their evolution with twist angle. We
compare our data with calculations of the band structures obtained via the
continuum model and find good agreement only when considering a variation of
interlayer/intralayer tunnelling parameters with the twist angle. Our analysis
suggests that the magic angle also shifts due to lattice relaxation, and is
better defined for a wide angular range from 0.9{\deg} to 1.1{\deg}. Our work
provides spectroscopic insights into TBG's band structure and offers an optical
fingerprint of the magic angle for screening heterostructures before
nanofabrication.

<p>Nanotechnology's impact on semiconductor industry advancement, particularly
through the engineering of nanostructures like nanowires, opens new
possibilities for material functionality due to the tunable physical properties
of nanostructures compared to bulk materials. This paper presents a
comprehensive study on group IV semiconductors and their binaries across four
polytypes: 2H, 3C, 4H, and 6H, focusing on their optoelectronic application
potential. Deep understanding of these polytypes is particularly relevant for
nanowire-based technologies. Through first principles modeling, we examine the
structural and electronic properties of these materials, emphasizing their band
structure, stability, and the feasibility for light-emitting applications. We
use a generalized Ising model to discuss materials stability and tendency for
polytypism. We also determine relative band edge positions and employ a six
$k\cdot p$ model for a detailed understanding of the materials' electronic
properties. Due to the comprehensive nature of this study, we provide insight
on the chemical trends present in all of the studied properties. Our
theoretical predictions align well with existing experimental data, suggesting
new avenues for nanostructure-based device development. The discussion extends
to the implications of these findings for the fabrication of optoelectronic
devices with the studied IV-IV materials, highlighting the challenges and
opportunities for future research in nanowire synthesis and their application.
