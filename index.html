<h3>Wetting dynamics by mixtures of fast and slow self-propelled particles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01856" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01856</a>
<br>
<i>Mauricio Rojas-Vega, Pablo de Castro, Rodrigo Soto</i>

<br>
We study active surface wetting using a minimal model of bacteria that takes
into account the intrinsic motility diversity of living matter. A mixture of
"fast" and "slow" self-propelled Brownian particles is considered in the
presence of a wall. The evolution of the wetting layer thickness shows an
overshoot before stationarity and its composition evolves in two stages,
equilibrating after a slow elimination of excess particles. Non-monotonic
evolutions are shown to arise from delayed avalanches towards the dilute phase
combined with the emergence of a transient particle front.

<h3>Dynamics of active particles with translational and rotational inertia</h3>

<br>
Inertial effects affecting both the translational and rotational dynamics are
inherent to a broad range of active systems at the macroscopic scale. Thus,
there is a pivotal need for proper models in the framework of active matter to
correctly reproduce experimental results, hopefully achieving theoretical
insights. For this purpose, we propose an inertial version of the active
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle (AOUP) model accounting for particle mass
(translational inertia) as well as its moment of inertia (rotational inertia)
and derive the full expression for its steady-state properties. The inertial
AOUP dynamics introduced in this paper is designed to capture the basic
features of the well-established inertial active Brownian particle (ABP) model,
i.e., the persistence time of the active motion and the long-time diffusion
coefficient. For a small or moderate rotational inertia, these two models
predict similar dynamics at all timescales and, in general, our inertial AOUP
model consistently yields the same trend upon changing the moment of inertia
for various dynamical correlation functions.

<h3>Intrinsically-multilayer moiré heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01777" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01777</a>
<br>
<i>Aaron Dunbrack, Jennifer Cano</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce trilayer and multilayer moir\'e heterostructures that cannot be
viewed from the ``moir\'e-of-moir\'e" perspective of helically-twisted trilayer
graphene. These ``intrinsically trilayer" moir\'e systems feature periodic
modulation of a local quasicrystalline structure. They open the door to
realizing moir\'e heterostructures with vastly more material constituents
because they do not constrain the lattice constants of the layers. In this
manuscript, we define intrinsically multilayer patterns, provide a recipe for
their construction, derive their local configuration space, and connect the
visual patterns to physical observables in material systems.

<h3>Measuring out quasi-local integrals of motion from entanglement</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01787" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01787</a>

Quasi-local integrals of motion are a key concept underpinning the modern
understanding of many-body localisation, an intriguing phenomenon in which
interactions and disorder come together. Despite the existence of several
numerical ways to compute them - and astoundingly in the light of the
observation that much of the phenomenology of many properties can be derived
from them - it is not obvious how to directly measure aspects of them in real
quantum simulations; in fact, the smoking gun of their experimental observation
is arguably still missing. In this work, we propose a way to extract the
real-space properties of such quasi-local integrals of motion based on a
spatially-resolved entanglement probe able to distinguish Anderson from
many-body localisation from non-equilibrium dynamics. We complement these
findings with a new rigorous entanglement bound and compute the relevant
quantities using tensor networks. We demonstrate that the entanglement gives
rise to a well-defined length scale that can be measured in experiments.

<h3>Plasticity in irradiated FeCrAl nanopillars investigated using discrete  dislocation dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01812" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01812</a>
<br>
<i>Yash Pachaury, George Warren, Janelle P. Wharry, Giacomo Po, Anter El-Azab</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, we investigate plasticity in irradiated FeCrAl nanopillars
using discrete dislocation dynamics simulations (DDD), with comparisons to
transmission electron microscopic (TEM) in situ tensile tests of ion and
neutron irradiated commercial FeCrAl alloy C35M. The effects of
irradiation-induced defects, such as a/2 111 and a 100 type loops and
composition fluctuations representative of phase separation in irradiated
FeCrAl alloys, are investigated separately as well as superposed together in
simulations. We explore the effects of defects on the stress-strain behavior,
specifically yield strength and hardening response, of FeCrAl nanopillars. Our
simulations confirm the widely accepted fact that irradiated alloys exhibit a
stress-strain response with higher yield strength and hardening as compared to
homogeneous alloys. However, our DDD calculations reveal an atypical
superposition of the hardening contributions due to composition inhomogeneity
and irradiation loops wherein hardening due composition inhomogeneity
counteracts hardening due to irradiation loops at small scales. As a result, we
observe that the yield strength in irradiated alloys, after taking into
consideration the effects of both composition inhomogeneity and irradiation
loops, is smaller than the yield strength of the alloys with only irradiation
loops and is approximately same for the alloy with composition inhomogeneity
alone. We identify this destructive interference in the superposition in our
parallel TEM in situ tensile tests on unirradiated, ion irradiated, and neutron
irradiated C35M FeCrAl alloy as well. This destructive interference in the
hardening contributions contrasts with the widely utilized dispersed barrier
hardening (DBH) models by the experimental community to model the hardening
contributions due to different irradiation induced defects.

Water is a key ingredient for life and plays a central role as solvent in
many biochemical reactions. However, the intrinsically quantum nature of the
hydrogen nucleus, revealing itself in a large variety of physical
manifestations, including proton transfer, gives rise to unexpected phenomena
whose description is still elusive. Here we study, by an unprecedented
combination of state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo methods and path-integral
molecular dynamics, the structure and hydrogen-bond dynamics of the protonated
water hexamer, the fundamental unit for the hydrated proton. We report a
remarkably low thermal expansion of the hydrogen bond from zero temperature up
to 300 K, owing to the presence of short-Zundel configurations, characterised
by proton delocalisation and favoured by the synergy of nuclear quantum effects
and thermal activation. The hydrogen bond strength progressively weakens above
300 K, when localised Eigen-like configurations become relevant. Our analysis,
supported by the instanton statistics of shuttling protons, reveals that the
near-room-temperature range from 250 K to 300 K is a ``sweet spot'' for proton
transfer, and thus for many phenomena depending on it, including life.

<h3>Ab initio calculations of thermal conductivities in crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01831" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01831</a>
<br>
<i>Krzysztof Parlinski</i>
<br>
<br>
The calculations of thermal conductivity requires to know anharmonic
properties of the crystal. For this purpose a non-perturbative anharmonic
theory is applied, which do not make use of the potential energy expansion over
atomic displacements, but instead, runs ab initio calculations of
Hellmann-Feynman forces for atomic patterns of atoms with specific
displacements to rebuild the anharmonic phonon frequencies, and group
velocities. see [K.Parlinski, Phys.Rev. B 98, 054305 (2018),] The Green-Kubo
equation for the thermal conductivity needs to know the above quantities and
the phonon relaxation times, which are related to the 4th-order phonon
correlation function expressed in terms of phonon anihilation and creation Bose
operators. In currect formulation of anharmonic theory the relaxation times can
be derived as analitical expression. The Green-Kubo formulae was succesfully
applied to find thermal conductivity of Si and conductivities, related to the
phonon and elastic waves, respectivily, were computed.

<h3>Probabilistic Genotype-Phenotype Maps Reveal Mutational Robustness of  RNA Folding, Spin Glasses, and Quantum Circuits</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01847" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01847</a>
<br>
<i>Anna Sappington, Vaibhav Mohanty</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent studies of genotype-phenotype (GP) maps have reported universally
enhanced phenotypic robustness to genotype mutations, a feature essential to
evolution. Virtually all of these studies make a simplifying assumption that
each genotype maps deterministically to a single phenotype. Here, we introduce
probabilistic genotype-phenotype (PrGP) maps, where each genotype maps to a
vector of phenotype probabilities, as a more realistic framework for
investigating robustness. We study three model systems to show that our
generalized framework can handle uncertainty emerging from various physical
sources: (1) thermal fluctuation in RNA folding, (2) external field disorder in
spin glass ground state finding, and (3) superposition and entanglement in
quantum circuits, which are realized experimentally on a 7-qubit IBM quantum
computer. In all three cases, we observe a novel biphasic robustness scaling
which is enhanced relative to random expectation for more frequent phenotypes
and approaches random expectation for less frequent phenotypes.

<h3>Kagome qubit ice</h3>

<br>
<br>
Topological phases of spin liquids with constrained disorder can host a
kinetics of fractionalized excitations. However, spin-liquid phases with
distinct kinetic regimes have proven difficult to observe experimentally. Here
we present a realization of kagome spin ice in the superconducting qubits of a
quantum annealer, and use it to demonstrate a field-induced kinetic crossover
between spin-liquid phases. Employing fine control over local magnetic fields,
we show evidence of both the Ice-I phase and an unconventional field-induced
Ice-II phase. In the latter, a charge-ordered yet spin-disordered topological
phase, the kinetics proceeds via pair creation and annihilation of strongly
correlated, charge conserving, fractionalized excitations. As these kinetic
regimes have resisted characterization in other artificial spin ice
realizations, our results demonstrate the utility of quantum-driven kinetics in
advancing the study of topological phases of spin liquids.

<h3>Free energy and specific heat near a quantum critical point of a metal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01873" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01873</a>
<br>
<i>Shang-Shun Zhang, Erez Berg, Andrey V. Chubukov</i>
<br>
<br>
We analyze free energy and specific heat for fermions interacting with
gapless bosons at a quantum-critical point (QCP) in a metal. We use the
Luttinger-Ward-Eliashberg formula for the free energy in the normal state,
which includes contributions from bosons, fermions, and their interaction, all
expressed via fully dressed fermionic and bosonic propagators. The sum of the
last two contributions is the free energy $F_\gamma$ of an effective low-energy
model of fermions with boson-mediated dynamical 4-fermion interaction $V
(\Omega_m) \propto 1/|\Omega_m|^\gamma$ (the $\gamma-$model). This purely
electronic model has been used to analyze the interplay between non-Fermi
liquid (non-FL) behavior and pairing near a QCP, which are both independent of
the upper energy cutoff $\Lambda$. However, the specific heat $C_\gamma (T)$,
obtained from $F_\gamma$, does depend on $\Lambda$. We argue that this
dependence is spurious and cancels out, once we include the contribution from
bosons. We compare our $C(T)$ with the one obtained within the $\gamma-$model
using recently proposed regularization of $F_\gamma$. We argue that for $\gamma
<1$, the full $C(T)$ and the regularized $C_\gamma (T)$ differ by a
$\gamma-$dependent prefactor, while for $\gamma >1$, the full $C(T)$ is the sum
of $ C_\gamma (T)$ and the specific heat of free bosons with fully dressed
mass. For these $\gamma$, $C_\gamma (T)$ is negative. The authors of Ref. [1]
argued that a negative $ C_\gamma (T)$ implies that the normal state becomes
unstable at some distance to a QCP. In our calculation, both terms in $C(T)$
come from the same source, and $ C_\gamma (T)$ is smaller as long as vertex
corrections can be safely neglected. We then argue that the normal state
remains stable even at a QCP.

<h3>Phase Asymmetry of Andreev Spectra From Cooper-Pair Momentum</h3>

In analogy to conventional semiconductor diodes, the Josephson diode exhibits
superconducting properties that are asymmetric in applied bias. The effect has
been investigated in number of systems recently, and requires a combination of
broken time-reversal and inversion symmetries. We demonstrate a dual of the
usual Josephson diode effect, a nonreciprocal response of Andreev bound states
to a superconducting phase difference across the normal region of a
superconductor-normal-superconductor Josephson junction, fabricated using an
epitaxial InAs/Al heterostructure. Phase asymmetry of the subgap Andreev
spectrum is absent in the absence of in-plane magnetic field and reaches a
maximum at 0.15 T applied in the plane of the junction transverse to the
current direction. We interpret the phase diode effect in this system as
resulting from finite-momentum Cooper pairing due to orbital coupling to the
in-plane magnetic field, without invoking Zeeman or spin-orbit coupling.

<h3>Local electronic structure of dilute hydrogen in $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$  probed by muons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01883" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01883</a>
<br>
<i>M. Hiraishi, H. Okabe, A. Koda, R. Kadono, T. Ohsawa, N. Ohashi, K. Ide, T. Kamiya, H. Hosono</i>
<br>
<br>
The local electronic structure of muons (Mu) as dilute pseudo-hydrogen in
single-crystalline $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ has been studied by the muon spin
rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR). High-precision measurements over a long time
range of $\sim$25 $\mu$s have clearly identified two distinct Mu states: a
quasi-static Mu (Mu$_1$) and fast-moving Mu (Mu$_2$). By comparing this result
with predictions from the recently established ambipolarity model, these two
states are respectively attributed to the relaxed-excited states associated
with the donor ($E^{+/0}$) and acceptor ($E^{-/0}$) levels predicted by density
functional theory (DFT) calculations for the interstitial H. Furthermore, the
local electronic structure of Mu$_1$ is found to be an OMu-bonded state with
three-coordinated oxygen. The structure is almost identical with the thermal
equilibrium state of H, and it is found to function as an electron donor. The
other Mu$_2$ is considered to be in the hydride state (Mu$^-$) from the
ambipolarity model, suggesting that it is in fast diffusion motion through the
short-lived neutral state due to the charge exchange reaction with conduction
electrons (Mu$^0+e^-\rightleftarrows$Mu$^-$).

<h3>Local Fluctuations in Cavity Control of Ferroelectricity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01884" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01884</a>
<br>
<i>Jonathan B. Curtis, Marios H. Michael, Eugene Demler</i>
<br>
<br>
Control of quantum matter through resonant electromagnetic cavities is a
promising route towards establishing control over material phases and
functionalities. Quantum paraelectric insulators -- materials which are nearly
ferroelectric -- are particularly promising candidate systems for this purpose
since they have strongly fluctuating collective modes which directly couple to
the electric field. In this work we explore this possibility in a system
comprised of a quantum paraelectric sandwiched between two high-quality metal
mirrors, realizing a Fabry-Perot type cavity. By developing a full multimode,
continuum description we are able to study the effect of the cavity in a
spatially resolved way for a variety of system sizes and temperatures.
Surprisingly, we find that once a continuum of transverse modes are included
the cavity ends up suppressing ferroelectric correlations. This effect arises
from the screening out of transverse photons at the cavity boundaries and as a
result is confined to the surface of the paraelectric sample. We also explore
the temperature dependence of this effect and find it vanishes at high
temperatures, indicating it is a purely quantum mechanical effect. We connect
our result to calculations of Casimir and Van der Waals forces, which we argue
are closely related to the dipolar fluctuations in the quantum paraelectric.
Our results are based on a general formalism and are expected to be widely
applicable, paving the way towards studies of the quantum electrodynamics of
heterostructures featuring multiple materials and phases.

<h3>Observation of room temperature anomalous Hall effect in graphene-WSe2  heterostructures</h3>

Proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling in graphene offers an exciting platform
to probe spin-based effects in chiral Dirac fermionic systems. These systems
are believed to be intrinsically time-reversal symmetric, which should ensure
that the charge Hall response vanishes without a magnetic field. In contrast to
this expectation, we report the first observation of anomalous Hall effect
(AHE) in single-layer graphene/single-layer WSe2 heterostructures that persists
up to room temperature. The magnitude and the sign of the AHE can be tuned
using an external perpendicular electric field. Our joint experimental and
theoretical study establishes that the observed anomalous Hall signal arises
from the combined effect of strain and spin-orbit coupling in graphene, which
induces time-reversal symmetry breaking and manifests as a valley asymmetry.
Our observation broadens the prospects of realizing high-temperature anomalous
Hall effects in a completely new system, namely graphene-transition metal
dichalcogenide-based heterostructures.

<h3>Control over Berry Curvature Dipole with Electric Field in WTe2</h3>

Berry curvature dipole plays an important role in various nonlinear quantum
phenomena. However, the maximum symmetry allowed for nonzero Berry curvature
dipole in the transport plane is a single mirror line, which strongly limits
its effects in materials. Here, via probing the nonlinear Hall effect, we
demonstrate the generation of Berry curvature dipole by applied dc electric
field in WTe2, which is used to break the symmetry constraint. A linear
dependence between the dipole moment of Berry curvature and the dc electric
field is observed. The polarization direction of the Berry curvature is
controlled by the relative orientation of the electric field and crystal axis,
which can be further reversed by changing the polarity of the dc field. Our
Letter provides a route to generate and control Berry curvature dipole in broad
material systems and to facilitate the development of nonlinear quantum
devices.

<h3>Two-dimensional Heisenberg models with materials-dependent superexchange  interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01923" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01923</a>

The two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals ferromagnetic semiconductors, such as
CrI$_3$ and Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, and the 2D ferromagnetic metals, such as
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ and MnSe$_2$, have been obtained in recent experiments and
attracted a lot of attentions. The superexchange interaction has been suggested
to dominate the magnetic interactions in these 2D magnetic systems. In the
usual theoretical studies, the expression of the 2D Heisenberg models were
fixed by hand due to experiences. Here, we propose a method to determine the
expression of the 2D Heisenberg models by counting the possible superexchange
paths with the density functional theory (DFT) and Wannier function
calculations. With this method, we obtain a 2D Heisenberg model with six
different nearest-neighbor exchange coupling constants for the 2D ferromagnetic
metal Cr$_3$Te$_6$, which is very different for the crystal structure of Cr
atoms in Cr$_3$Te$_6$. The calculated Curie temperature Tc = 328 K is close to
the Tc = 344 K of 2D Cr$_3$Te$_6$ reported in recent experiment. In addition,
we predict two stable 2D ferromagnetic semiconductors Cr$_3$O$_6$ and
Mn$_3$O$_6$ sharing the same crystal structure of Cr$_3$Te$_6$. The similar
Heisenberg models are obtained for 2D Cr$_3$O$_6$ and Mn$_3$O$_6$, where the
calculated Tc is 218 K and 208 K, respectively. Our method offers a general
approach to determine the expression of Heisenberg models for these 2D magnetic
semiconductors and metals, and builds up a solid basis for further studies.

<h3>Optimizing density-functional simulations for two-dimensional metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01945" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01945</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Unlike covalent two-dimensional (2D) materials like graphene, 2D metals have
non-layered structures due to their non-directional, metallic bonding. While
experiments on 2D metals are still scarce and challenging, density-functional
theory (DFT) provides an ideal approach to predict their basic properties and
assist in their design. However, DFT methods have been rarely benchmarked
against metallic bonding at low dimensions. Therefore, to identify optimal DFT
attributes for a desired accuracy, we systematically benchmark
exchange-correlation functionals from LDA to hybrids and basis sets from plane
waves to local basis with different pseudopotentials. With 1D chain, 2D
honeycomb, 2D square, 2D hexagonal, and 3D bulk metallic systems, we compare
the DFT attributes using bond lengths, cohesive energies, elastic constants,
densities of states, and computational costs. Although today most DFT studies
on 2D metals use plane waves, our comparisons reveal that local basis with
often-used PBE exchange-correlation is well sufficient for most purposes, while
plane waves and hybrid functionals bring limited improvement compared to the
greatly increased computational cost. These results ease the demands for
generating DFT data for better interaction with experiments and for data-driven
discoveries of 2D metals incorporating machine learning algorithms.

<h3>Application of Machine Learning to Sporadic Experimental Data for  Understanding Epitaxial Strain Relaxation</h3>

Understanding epitaxial strain relaxation is one of the key challenges in
functional thin films with strong structure-property relation. Herein, we
employ an emerging data analytics approach to quantitatively evaluate the
underlying relationships between critical thickness (hc) of strain relaxation
and various physical and chemical features, despite the sporadic experimental
data points available. First, we have collected and refined reported hc of
perovskite oxide thin film/substrate system to construct a consistent
sub-dataset which captures a common trend among the varying experimental
details. Then, we employ correlation analyses and feature engineering to find
the most relevant feature set which include Poisson's ratio and lattice
mismatch. With the insight offered by correlation analyses and feature
engineering, machine learning (ML) models have been trained to deduce a decent
accuracy, which has been further validated experimentally. the demonstrated
framework is expected to be efficiently extended to the other classes of thin
films in understanding hc.

<h3>Nonlinear photoconductivities and quantum geometry of chiral multifold  fermions</h3>

Chiral multifold fermions are quasi-particles that appear only in chiral
crystals such as transition metal silicides in the cubic B20 structure (i.e.,
the CoSi family), and they may show exotic physical properties. Here we study
the injection and shift photoconductivities and also the related geometrical
quantities for several types of chiral multifold fermions, including spin-1/2
as well as pseudospin-1 and -3/2 fermions, dubbed as Kramers Weyl, triple point
and Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (RSW) fermions, respectively. We utilize the minimal
symmorphic model to describe the triple point fermions (TPF). We also consider
the more realistic model Hamiltonian for the CoSi family including both linear
and quadratic terms. We find that circular injection currents are quantized as
a result of the Chern numbers carried by the multifold fermions within the
linear models. Surprisingly, we discover that in the TPF model, linear shift
conductivities are proportional to the pseudo spin-orbit coupling and
independent of photon frequency. In contrast, for the RSW and Kramer Weyl
fermions, the linear shift conductivity is linearly proportional to photon
frequency. The numerical results agree with the power-counting analysis for
quadratic Hamiltonians. The frequency independence of the linear shift
conductivity could be attributed to the strong resonant symplectic Christoffel
symbols of the flat bands. Moreover, the calculated symplectic Christoffel
symbols show significant peaks at the nodes, suggesting that the shift currents
are due to the strong geometrical response near the topological nodes.

<h3>Theory of shallow and deep boron defects in 4H-SiC</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01979" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01979</a>

Abstract Despite advances toward improving the quality of $p$-type 4H-SiC
substrates and layers, we still have no model capable of accounting for the
multitude of boron-related optical, junction, and paramagnetic resonance
experiments available in the literature. A conspicuous puzzle is the
observation of two shallow boron defects with rather distinct axial
orientations as found by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron
nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) data. This feature is not observed in material
doped with other group-III elements. Another open issue involves conflicting
conclusions from photoluminescence and EPR studies of a deeper boron center,
which has been linked to rather distinct models, either based on substitutional
or vacancy-related boron defects. We unlock these and other problems by means
of first-principles calculations, where the temperature-dependent stability,
the electronic activity, and the paramagnetic response of boron defects in
4H-SiC are investigated.

Electrocatalysis plays a crucial role in realizing the transition towards
green energy, driving research directions from hydrogen generation to carbon
dioxide reduction. Understanding electrochemical reactions is crucial to
improve their efficiency and to bridge the gap toward a sustainable zero-carbon
future. Surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) is a
suitable method for investigating these processes because it can monitor with
chemical specificity the mechanisms of the reactions. However, it remains
difficult to detect many relevant aspects of electrochemical reactions such as
short-lived intermediates. Here, we develop and experimentally realize an
integrated nanophotonic-electrochemical SEIRAS platform for the in situ
investigation of molecular signal traces emerging during electrochemical
experiments. Specifically, we implement a platinum nano-slot metasurface
featuring strongly enhanced electromagnetic near fields and spectrally target
it at the weak vibrational bending mode of adsorbed CO at ~2033 cm-1.
Crucially, our platinum nano-slot metasurface provides high molecular
sensitivity. The resonances can be tuned over a broad range in the mid-infrared
spectrum. Compared to conventional unstructured platinum layers, our
nanophotonic-electrochemical platform delivers a substantial improvement of the
experimentally detected characteristic absorption signals by a factor of 27,
enabling the detection of new species with weak signals, fast conversions, or
low surface concentrations. By providing a deeper understanding of catalytic
reactions, we anticipate our nanophotonic-electrochemical platform to open
exciting perspectives for electrochemical SEIRAS, surface-enhanced Raman
spectroscopy, and the study of reactions in other fields of chemistry such as
photoelectrocatalysis.

<h3>Floquet engineering non-equilibrium steady states</h3>

<br>
Non-equilibrium steady states are created when a periodically driven quantum
system is also incoherently interacting with an environment -- as it is the
case in most realistic situations. The notion of Floquet engineering refers to
the manipulation of the properties of systems under periodic perturbations.
Although it more frequently refers to the coherent states of isolated systems
(or to the transient phase for states that are weakly coupled to the
environment), it may sometimes be of more interest to consider the final steady
states that are reached after decoherence and dissipation take place. In this
work, we propose a computational method to find the multicolor periodic
perturbations that lead to the final steady states that are optimal with
respect to a given predefined metric, such as for example the maximization of
the temporal average value of some observable. We exemplify the concept using a
simple model for the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond: the goal in this case
is to find the driving periodic magnetic field that maximizes a time-averaged
spin component. We show that, for example, this technique permits to prepare
states whose spin values are forbidden in thermal equilibrium at any
temperature.

<br>
<br>
Owing to their high magnon frequencies, antiferromagnets are key materials
for future high-speed spintronics. Picosecond switching of antiferromagnetic
order has been viewed a milestone for decades and pursued only by using
ultrafast external perturbations. Here, we show that picosecond spin switching
occurs spontaneously due to thermal fluctuations in the antiferromagnetic
orthoferrite Sm0.7Er0.3FeO3. By analysing the correlation between the
pulse-to-pulse polarisation fluctuations of two femtosecond optical probes, we
extract the autocorrelation of incoherent magnon fluctuations. We observe a
strong enhancement of the magnon fluctuation amplitude and the coherence time
around the critical temperature of the spin reorientation transition. The
spectrum shows two distinct modes, one corresponding to the quasi-ferromagnetic
mode and another one which has not been previously reported in pump-probe
experiments. Comparison to a stochastic spin dynamics simulation reveals this
new mode as smoking gun of ultrafast spontaneous spin switching within the
double-well anisotropy potential.

<br>
<br>
Abstract: We report on emergence of an abnormal electronic polarization in
twisted double bilayer WSe2 in antiparallel interface stacking geometry, where
local centrosymmetry of atomic registries at the twist interface does not favor
the spontaneous electronic polarizations as recently observed in the parallel
interface stacking geometry. The unconventional ferroelectric behaviors probed
by electronic transport measurement occur at half filling insulating states at
1.5 K and gradually disappear at about 40 K. Single band Hubbard model based on
the triangular moir\'e lattice and the interlayer charge transfer controlled by
insulating phase transition are proposed to interpret the formation of
electronic polarization states near half filling in twisted WSe2 devices. Our
work highlights the prominent role of many-body electronic interaction in
fostering novel quantum states in moir\'e-structured systems.

<h3>Tuning electronic and phononic states with hidden order in disordered  crystals</h3>

<br>
<br>
Disorder in crystals is rarely random, and instead involves local
correlations whose presence and nature are hidden from conventional
crystallographic probes. This hidden order can sometimes be controlled, but its
importance for physical properties of materials is not well understood. Using
simple models for electronic and interatomic interactions, we show how crystals
with identical average structures but different types of hidden order can have
very different electronic and phononic band structures. Increasing the strength
of local correlations within hidden-order states can open band gaps and tune
mode (de)localisation -- both mechanisms allowing for fundamental changes in
physical properties without long-range symmetry breaking. Taken together, our
results demonstrate how control over hidden order offers a new mechanism for
tuning material properties, orthogonal to the conventional principles of
(ordered) structure/property relationships.

<h3>In-situ electrical and thermal transport properties of FeySe1-xTex films  with ionic liquid gating</h3>

<br>
<br>
We combine in-situ electrical transport and Seebeck coefficient measurements
with the ionic liquid gating technique to investigate superconductivity and the
normal state of FeySe1-xTex (FST) films. We find that the pristine FST films
feature a non-Fermi liquid temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient,
i.e., S/T ~ AS lnT, and AS is strongly correlated with the superconducting
transition temperature (Tc). Ionic liquid gating significantly raises Tc of FST
films, for which the Seebeck coefficient displays a novel scaling behavior and
retains the logarithmic temperature dependence. Moreover, a quantitative
relationship between the slope of T-linear resistivity (A\r{ho}) and Tc for
gated films is observed, i.e., (A\r{ho})1/2 ~ Tc, consistent with previous
reports on cuprates and FeSe. The scaling behaviors of AS and A\r{ho} point to
a spin-fluctuation-associated transport mechanism in gated FeySe1-xTex
superconductors.

<h3>First-Order Excited-State Quantum Phase Transition in the Transverse  Ising Model with a Longitudinal Field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02066" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02066</a>
<br>
<i>Yun-Tong Yang, Hong-Gang Luo</i>
<br>
<br>
The investigation of the first-order quantum phase transition (QPT) is far
from clarity in comparison to that of the second-order or continuous QPT, in
which the order parameter and associated broken symmetry can be clearly
identified and at the same time the concepts of universality class and critical
scaling can be characterized by critical exponents. Here we present a compared
study of these two kinds of QPT in the transverse Ising model. In the absence
of a longitudinal field, the ground state of the model exhibits a second-order
QPT from paramagnetic phase to ferromagnetic one, which is smeared out once the
longitudinal field is applied. Surprisingly, the first excited state involves a
first-order QPT as the longitudinal field increases, which has not been
reported in literature. Within the framework of a pattern picture we clearly
identify the difference between these two kinds of QPT: for the continuous QPT
only the pattern flavoring ferromagnetic phase is always dominant over the
others, and on the contrary, there exist at least two competitive patterns in
the first-order QPT, which is further indicated by patterns' occupancies
calculated by pattern projections on the ground and first excited states
wavefunctions. Our result has not only a fundamental significance in the
understandings of the nature of QPTs, but also a practical interest in quantum
simulations used to test the present finding.

Curved magnetic architectures are key enablers of the prospective magnetic
devices with respect to size, functionality and speed. By exploring
geometry-governed magnetic interactions, curvilinear magnetism offers a number
of intriguing effects in curved magnetic wires and curved magnetic films. The
applicability of the current micromagnetic theory requires that the sample has
constant width and thickness, which does not correspond in many cases to
specificity of experimental sample preparation. Here, we put forth a
self-consistent micromagnetic framework of curvilinear magnetism of nanowires
and narrow stripes with spatially inhomogeneous cross-section. The influence of
the varying cross-section is exploited and illustrated by an example of the
simplest topological texture, which is a transversal head-to-head
(tail-to-tail) domain wall. The cross-section gradient becomes a source of
domain wall pinning which competes the curvature gradient. Eigenfrequencies of
the domain wall free oscillations at the pinning potential are determined by
both curvature and cross-section gradients. Prospects for curvilinear magnonics
and spintronics are discussed.

<h3>Probing RG flows, symmetry resolution and quench dynamics through the  capacity of entanglement</h3>

<br>
<i>Raúl Arias, Giuseppe Di Giulio, Esko Keski-Vakkuri, Erik Tonni</i>
<br>
<br>
We compare the capacity of entanglement with the entanglement entropy by
considering various aspects of these quantities for free bosonic and fermionic
models in one spatial dimension, both in the continuum and on the lattice.
Substantial differences are observed in the subleading terms of these
entanglement quantifiers when the subsystem is made by two disjoint intervals,
in the massive scalar field and in the fermionic chain. We define $c$-functions
based on the capacity of entanglement similar to the one based on the
entanglement entropy, showing through a numerical analysis that they display a
monotonic behaviour under the renormalisation group flow generated by the mass.
The capacity of entanglement and its related quantities are employed to explore
the symmetry resolution. The temporal evolutions of the capacity of
entanglement and of the corresponding contour function after a global quench
are also discussed.

<br>
Accurate and efficient tools for calculating the ground state properties of
interacting quantum systems are essential in the design of nanoelectronic
devices. The exact diagonalization method fully accounts for the Coulomb
interaction beyond mean field approximations and it is regarded as the
gold-standard for few electron systems. However, by increasing the number of
instances to be solved, the computational costs become prohibitive and new
approaches based on machine learning techniques can provide a significant
reduction in computational time and resources, maintaining a reasonable
accuracy. Here, we employ pix2pix, a general-purpose image-to-image translation
method based on conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), for
predicting ground state densities from randomly generated confinement
potentials. Other mappings were also investigated, like potentials to
non-interacting densities and the translation from non-interacting to
interacting densities. The architecture of the cGAN was optimized with respect
to the internal parameters of the generator and discriminator. Moreover, the
inverse problem of finding the confinement potential given the interacting
density can also be approached by the pix2pix mapping, which is an important
step in finding near-optimal solutions for confinement potentials.

<h3>Rényi entropies for one-dimensional quantum systems with mixed  boundary conditions</h3>

<br>
<i>Benoit Estienne, Yacine Ikhlef, Andrei Rotaru</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a general method for calculating R\'enyi entropies in the ground
state of a one-dimensional critical system with mixed open boundaries, for an
interval starting at one of its ends. In the conformal field theory framework,
this computation boils down to the evaluation of the correlation function of
one twist field and two boundary condition changing operators in the cyclic
orbifold. Exploiting null-vectors of the cyclic orbifold, we derive ordinary
differential equations satisfied by these correlation functions. In particular,
we obtain an explicit expression for the second R\'enyi entropy valid for any
diagonal minimal model, but with a particular set of mixed boundary conditions.
In order to compare our results with numerical data for the Ising and
three-state Potts critical chains, we also identify and compute the leading
finite size corrections.

<h3>Next fifty years of thermodynamics and its modeling: Integrating  quantum, statistical, classical, and irreversible thermodynamics for  prediction of transformative properties</h3>

Thermodynamics is a science concerning the state of a system, whether it is
stable, metastable, or unstable. The combined law of thermodynamics derived by
Gibbs about 150 years ago laid the foundation of thermodynamics. In Gibbs
combined law, the entropy production due to internal processes was not
included, and the 2nd law was thus practically removed from the Gibbs combined
law, so it is only applicable to systems under equilibrium. Gibbs further
derived the classical statistical thermodynamics in terms of the probability of
configurations in a system. With the quantum mechanics (QM) developed, the
QM-based statistical thermodynamics was established and connected to classical
statistical thermodynamics at the classical limit as shown by Landau. The
development of density function theory (DFT) by Kohn and co-workers enabled the
QM prediction of properties of the ground state of a system. On the other hand,
the entropy production due to internal processes in non-equilibrium systems was
studied separately by Onsager and Prigogine and co-workers. The digitization of
thermodynamics was developed by Kaufman in the framework of the CALPHAD
modeling of individual phases. Our recently termed zentropy theory integrates
DFT and statistical mechanics through the replacement of the internal energy of
each individual configuration by its DFT-predicted free energy. Furthermore,
through the combined law of thermodynamics with the entropy production as a
function of internal degrees of freedom, it is shown that the kinetic
coefficient matrix of independent internal processes is diagonal with respect
to the conjugate potentials in the combined law, and the cross phenomena
represented by the phenomenological Onsager reciprocal relationships are due to
the dependence of the conjugate potential of the molar quantity in a flux on
nonconjugate potentials.

<h3>Time-reversal invariant finite-size topology</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02134" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02134</a>
<br>
<i>R. Flores-Calderón, Roderich Moessner, Ashley M. Cook</i>
<br>
<br>
We report finite-size topology in the quintessential time-reversal (TR)
invariant systems, the quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) and the
three-dimensional, strong topological insulator (STI): previously-identified
helical or Dirac cone boundary states of these phases hybridize in wire or slab
geometries with one open boundary condition for finite system size, and
\textit{additional, topologically-protected, lower-dimensional} boundary modes
appear for open boundary conditions in \textit{two or more} directions. For the
quasi-one-dimensional (q(2-1)D) QSHI, we find topologically-protected,
quasi-zero-dimensional (q(2-2)D) boundary states within the hybridization gap
of the helical edge states, determined from q(2-1)D bulk topology characterized
by topologically non-trivial Wilson loop spectra. We show this finite-size
topology furthermore occurs in 1T'-WTe\textsubscript{2} in ribbon geometries
with sawtooth edges, based on analysis of a tight-binding model derived from
density-functional theory calculations, motivating experimental investigation
of our results. In addition, we find quasi-two-dimensional (q(3-1)D)
finite-size topological phases occur for the STI, yielding helical boundary
modes distinguished from those of the QSHI by a non-trivial magneto-electric
polarizability linked to the original 3D bulk STI. Finite-size topological
phases therefore exhibit signatures associated with the non-trivial topological
invariant of a higher-dimensional bulk. Finally, we find the q(3-2)D STI also
exhibits finite-size topological phases, finding the first signs of
topologically-protected boundary modes of codimension greater than $1$ due to
finite-size topology. Finite-size topology of four or higher-dimensional
systems is therefore possible in experimental settings without recourse to
thermodynamically large synthetic dimensions.

<h3>Impact of electron correlations on the $\mathbf{k}$-resolved electronic  structure of PdCrO$_{2}$ revealed by Compton scattering</h3>

<br>
<i>Alyn D. N. James, David Billington, Stephen B. Dugdale</i>
<br>
<br>
Delafossite PdCrO$_2$ is an intriguing material which displays nearly-free
electron and Mott insulating behaviour in different layers. Both angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and Compton scattering measurements have
established a hexagonal Fermi surface in the material's paramagnetic phase.
However, the Compton experiment detected an additional structure in the
projected occupancy which was originally interpreted as an additional Fermi
surface feature not seen by ARPES. Here, we revisit this interpretation of the
Compton data. State-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) with dynamical
mean field theory (DMFT), the so-called DFT+DMFT method, predicts the Mott
insulating state along with a single hexagonal Fermi surface in excellent
agreement with ARPES and Compton. However, DFT+DMFT fails to predict the
intensity of the additional spectral weight feature observed in the Compton
data. We infer that this discrepancy may arise from the DFT+DMFT not being able
to correctly predict certain features in the shape and dispersion of the
unoccupied quasiparticle band near the Fermi level. Therefore, a theoretical
description beyond our DFT+DMFT model is needed to incorporate vital electron
interactions, such as inter-layer electron coupling interactions which for
PdCrO$_2$ gives rise to the Kondo-like so-called intertwined excitation.

<h3>Physical Realization of a Hyper Unclonable Function</h3>

<br>
<br>
Disordered photonic structures are promising materials for the realization of
physical unclonable functions (PUF), physical objects that can overcome the
limitations of conventional digital security methods and that enable
cryptographic protocols immune against attacks by future quantum computers. One
PUF limitation, so far, has been that their physical configuration is either
fixed or can only be permanently modified, and hence allowing only one token
per device. We show that it is possible to overcome this limitation by creating
a reconfigurable structure made by light-transformable polymers, in which the
physical structure of the unclonable function itself can be reversibly
reconfigured. We term this novel concept Hyper PUF or HPUF in that it allows a
large number of physical unclonable functions to co-exist simultaneously within
one and the same device. The physical transformation of the structure is done
all-optically in a reversible and spatially controlled fashion. Our novel
technology provides a massive enhancement in security generating more complex
keys containing a larger amount of information. At the same time, it allows for
new applications, for example serving multiple clients on a single encryption
device and the practical implementation of quantum secure authentication of
data.

In this work, a unified numerical model is used to determine the melting
thresholds and to investigate early stages of melting of several crystalline
semiconductors (Si, Ge, GaAs, CdTe and InP) irradiated by nanosecond laser
pulses. A molten fraction approach is used for continuous transition over the
melting point. The results are compared with previously published theoretical
and experimental data. A survey on the thermophysical and optical properties of
the selected materials has been carried out to gather the most relevant data on
temperature dependent properties for the solid and liquid states of these
semiconductors where such data are available. A generalization of the obtained
results is established which enables evaluation of the melting thresholds for
different semiconductors based on their properties and irradiation conditions
(laser wavelength, pulse duration).

<i>S. Varela, M. Peralta, V. Mujica, B. Berche, E. Medina</i>
<br>
<br>
Basic questions on the nature of spin polarization in two terminal systems
and the way in which decoherence breaks Time-Reversal Symmetry (TRS) are
analyzed. We exactly solve several one-dimensional models of tunneling
electrons and show the interplay of spin precession and decay of the
wavefunction in either a U(1) magnetic field or an effective Spin-Orbit (SO)
magnetic field. Spin polarization is clearly identified as the emergence of a
spin component parallel to either magnetic field. We show that Onsager's
reciprocity is fulfilled when time reversal symmetry is present and no spin
polarization arises, no matter the barrier parameters or the SO strength.
Introducing a Buttiker's decoherence probe, that preserves unitarity of time
evolution, we show that breaking of TRS results in a strong spin polarization
for realistic SO, and barrier strengths. We discuss the significance of these
results as a very general scenario for the onset of the Chiral-Induced Spin
Selectivity effect (CISS), now possibly matching experiments in a quantitative
manner.

We propose a transformation for spin and charge degrees of freedom in
one-dimensional lattice systems, constrained to have no doubly occupied sites,
that allows direct access to the dynamical correlations of the system. The
transformation delivers particle creation and annihilation operators in a form
of a spinless particle and a non-local operator acting on the space of states
of a spin-$1/2$ chain. This permits a decomposition of dynamical correlation
functions as a convolution of those for impenetrable anyons together with those
of a spin chain. Further analysis can be done by methods tailored for each part
of the convolution, greatly increasing the impact and flexibility of the
approach.

Carbon nanotube Y-junctions are of great interest to the next generation of
innovative multi-terminal nanodevices. Topological indices are
graph-theoretically based parameters that describe various structural
properties of a chemical molecule. The entropy of a graph is a topological
descriptor that serves to characterize the complexity of the underlying
molecular graph. The concept of entropy is a physical property of a
thermodynamic system. Graph entropies are the essential thermophysical
quantities defined for various graph invariants and are applied to measure the
heterogeneity and relative stabilities of molecules. In this paper, several
neighborhood degree sum-based topological indices including graph-based
entropies of carbon nanotube Y-junction graphs are computed.

The structure-property relationship plays a central role in materials
science. Understanding the structure-property relationship in solid-state
materials is crucial for structure design with optimized properties. The past
few years witnessed remarkable progress in correlating structures with
properties in crystalline materials, such as machine learning methods and
particularly graph neural networks as a natural representation of crystal
structures. However, significant challenges remain, including predicting
properties with complex unit cells input and material-dependent,
variable-length output. Here we present the virtual node graph neural network
to address the challenges. By developing three types of virtual node approaches
- the vector, matrix, and momentum-dependent matrix virtual nodes, we achieve
direct prediction of $\Gamma$-phonon spectra and full dispersion only using
atomic coordinates as input. We validate the phonon bandstructures on various
alloy systems, and further build a $\Gamma$-phonon database containing over
146,000 materials in the Materials Project. Our work provides an avenue for
rapid and high-quality prediction of phonon spectra and bandstructures in
complex materials, and enables materials design with superior phonon properties
for energy applications. The virtual node augmentation of graph neural networks
also sheds light on designing other functional properties with a new level of
flexibility.

Machine learning (ML) accelerates the exploration of material properties and
their links to the structure of the underlying molecules. In previous work [J.
Shi, M. J. Quevillon, P. H. A. Valen\c{c}a, and J. K. Whitmer, \textit{ACS
Appl. Mater. Interfaces.}, 2022, 14, 32, 37161--37169], ML models were applied
to predict the adhesive free energy of polymer--surface interactions with high
accuracy from the knowledge of the sequence data, demonstrating successes in
inverse-design of polymer sequence for known surface compositions. While the
method was shown to be successful in designing polymers for a known surface,
extensive datasets were needed for each specific surface in order to train the
surrogate models. Ideally, one should be able to infer information about
similar surfaces without having to regenerate a full complement of adhesion
data for each new case. In the current work, we demonstrate a transfer learning
(TL) technique using a deep neural network to improve the accuracy of ML models
trained on small datasets by pre-training on a larger database from a related
system and fine-tuning the weights of all layers with a small amount of
additional data. The shared knowledge from the pre-trained model facilitates
the prediction accuracy significantly on small datasets. We also explore the
limits of database size on accuracy and the optimal tuning of network
architecture and parameters for our learning tasks. While applied to a
relatively simple coarse-grained (CG) polymer model, the general lessons of
this study apply to detailed modeling studies and the broader problems of
inverse materials design.

Systems of fermions with multiple internal states, such as quarks in quantum
chromodynamics and nucleons in nuclear matter, are at the heart of some of the
most complex quantum many-body problems. The stability of such many-body
multi-component systems is crucial to understanding, for instance, baryon
formation and the structure of nuclei, but these fermionic problems are
typically very challenging to tackle theoretically. Versatile experimental
platforms on which to study analogous problems are thus sought after. Here, we
report the creation of a uniform gas of three-component fermions. We
characterize the decay of this system across a range of interaction strengths
and observe nontrivial competition between two- and three-body loss processes.
We observe anomalous decay of the polarized (i.e. spin-population imbalanced)
gas, in which the loss rates of each component unexpectedly differ. We
introduce a generalized three-body rate equation which captures the decay
dynamics, but the underlying microscopic mechanism is unknown.
