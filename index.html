<h3>A new microscopic representation of the spin dynamics in quantum systems  with the Coulomb exchange interactions</h3>

There is a version of the Landau-Lifshitz equation that takes into account
the Coulomb exchange interactions between atoms. It contains the vector product
of the magnetization and the second spatial derivative of the magnetization. We
propose a new fundamental microscopic derivation of such an equation using the
method of many-particle quantum hydrodynamics. Although we are considering a
crystal lattice in which ions do not move, the resulting equations turn out to
be hydrodynamics type. The equations for the evolution of the spin density are
obtained from the Schrodinger-Pauli equation and contain the contribution of
the usual Coulomb exchange interactions and bi-quadratic exchange. Furthermore,
the derived equations contain the nematic tensor of atoms with spin S=1. Our
method very attractive for further studies of the magnetoelectric effect in
multiferroics with exchange interactions.

<h3>Interactions enhance dispersion in fluctuating channels via emergent  flows</h3>

Understanding particle motion in narrow channels is essential to guide
progress in numerous applications, from filtration to vascular transport.
Thermal or active fluctuations of channel walls for fluid-filled channels can
slow down or increase the dispersion of tracer particles. Entropic trapping in
the wall bulges slows dispersion, and hydrodynamic flows induced by wall
fluctuations enhance dispersion. Previous studies primarily concentrated on the
case of a single Brownian tracer either embedded in an incompressible fluid or
in the ideal case where the presence of fluid is ignored. Here we address the
question of what happens when there is a large ensemble of interacting Brownian
tracers -- a common situation in applications. Introducing repulsive
interactions between the tracer particles, while ignoring the presence of a
background fluid, leads to an effective flow field. This flow field enhances
tracer dispersion, a phenomenon strongly reminiscent of that seen in
incompressible background fluid. We characterise the dispersion by the
long-time diffusion coefficient of a single tracer, numerically and
analytically with a mean-field density functional analysis. We find a
surprising effect where an increased particle density enhances the diffusion
coefficient, challenging the notion that crowding effects tend to reduce
diffusion. Here, inter-particle interactions push particles closer to the
fluctuating channel walls. Then, interactions between the fluctuating wall and
the now-nearby particles drive particle mixing. Our mechanism is sufficiently
general that we expect it to apply to various systems. In addition, the
perturbation theory we derive quantifies dispersion in generic
advection-diffusion systems with arbitrary spatiotemporal drift.

<h3>Edge-Induced Excitations in Bi$_2$Te$_3$ from Spatially-Resolved  Electron Energy-Gain Spectroscopy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03752" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03752</a>

Among the many potential applications of topological insulator materials,
their broad potential for the development of novel tunable plasmonics at THz
and mid-infrared frequencies for quantum computing, terahertz detectors, and
spintronic devices is particularly attractive. The required understanding of
the intricate relationship between nanoscale crystal structure and the
properties of the resulting plasmonic resonances remains, however, elusive for
these materials. Specifically, edge- and surface-induced plasmonic resonances,
and other collective excitations, are often buried beneath the continuum of
electronic transitions, making it difficult to isolate and interpret these
signals using techniques such as electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). Here
we focus on the experimentally clean energy-gain EELS region to characterise
collective excitations in the topologically insulating material Bi$_2$Te$_3$
and correlate them with the underlying crystalline structure with nanoscale
resolution. We identify with high significance the presence of a distinct
energy-gain peak around -0.8 eV, with spatially-resolved maps revealing that
its intensity is markedly enhanced at the edge regions of the specimen. Our
findings illustrate the reach of energy-gain EELS analyses to accurately map
collective excitations in quantum materials, a key asset in the quest towards
new tunable plasmonic devices.

<h3>Commensurate and incommensurate 1D interacting quantum systems</h3>

We use dynamically varying microscopic light potentials in a quantum-gas
microscope to study commensurate and incommensurate 1D systems of interacting
bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. Such incommensurate systems are analogous
to doped insulating states that exhibit atom transport and compressibility.
Initially, a commensurate system with unit filling and fixed atom number is
prepared between two potential barriers. We deterministically create an
incommensurate system by dynamically changing the position of the barriers such
that the number of available lattice sites is reduced while retaining the atom
number. Our commensurate and incommensurate systems are characterised by
measuring the distribution of particles and holes as a function of the lattice
filling, and interaction strength, and we probe the particle mobility by
applying a bias potential. Our work provides the foundation for preparation of
low-entropy states with controlled filling in optical lattice experiments.

Materials informatics, data-enabled investigation, is a "fourth paradigm" in
materials science research after the conventional empirical approach,
theoretical science, and computational research. Materials informatics has two
essential ingredients: fingerprinting materials proprieties and the theory of
statistical inference and learning. We have researched the organic
semiconductor's enigmas through the materials informatics approach. By applying
diverse neural network topologies, logical axiom, and inferencing information
science, we have developed data-driven procedures for novel organic
semiconductor discovery for the semiconductor industry and knowledge extraction
for the materials science community. We have reviewed and corresponded with
various algorithms for the neural network design topology for the materials
informatics dataset.

<h3>Incommensurability enabled quasi-fractal order in 1D narrow-band moiré  systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03800" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03800</a>
<br>
<i>Miguel Gonçalves, Bruno Amorim, Flavio Riche, Eduardo V. Castro, Pedro Ribeiro</i>
<br>
<br>
We demonstrate that quasiperiodicity can radically change the ground state
properties of 1D moir\'e systems with respect to their periodic counterparts.
By studying an illustrative example we show that while narrow bands play a
significant role in enhancing interactions both for commensurate and
incommensurate structures, only quasiperiodicity is able to extend the ordered
phase down to an infinitesimal interaction strength. In this regime, the
quasiperiodic-enabled state has contributions from infinitely many wave
vectors. This quasi-factal regime cannot be stabilized in the commensurate case
even in the presence of a narrow band. These findings suggest that
quasiperiodicity may be a critical factor in stabilizing non-trivial ordered
phases in interacting moir\'e structures and signal out multifractal
non-interacting phases, recently found in 2D incommensurate moir\'e systems, as
particularly promising parent states.

I present a novel equivariant neural network architecture for the large-scale
spin dynamics simulation of the Kondo lattice model. This neural network mainly
consists of tensor-product-based convolution layers and ensures two
equivariances: translations of the lattice and rotations of the spins. I
implement equivariant neural networks for two Kondo lattice models on
two-dimensional square and triangular lattices, and perform training and
validation. In the equivariant model for the square lattice, the validation
error (based on root mean squared error) is reduced to less than one-third
compared to a model using invariant descriptors as inputs. Furthermore, I
demonstrate the ability to reproduce phase transitions of skyrmion crystals in
the triangular lattice, by performing dynamics simulations using the trained
model.

<h3>Local structural ordering determines the mechanical damage tolerance of  amorphous grain boundary complexions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03805" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03805</a>
<br>
<i>Pulkit Garg, Timothy J. Rupert</i>
<br>
<br>
Amorphous grain boundary complexions act as toughening features within a
microstructure because they can absorb dislocations more efficiently than
traditional grain boundaries. This toughening effect should be a strong
function of the local internal structure of the complexion, which has recently
been shown to be determined by grain boundary crystallography. To test this
hypothesis, molecular dynamics are used here to simulate dislocation absorption
and damage nucleation for complexions with different distributions of
structural short-range order. The complexion with a more disordered structure
at the dislocation absorption site is actually found to fail earlier, as damage
tolerance requires delocalized deformation and the operation of
shear-transformation zones through the complexion thickness. The more damage
tolerant complexion accommodates plastic strain efficiently within the entire
complexion, providing a key mechanistic insight into the toughening effect of
amorphous complexions as well as a pathway to design nanocrystalline alloys
with improved mechanical properties.

<h3>Thermodynamics of a collisional quantum-dot machine: the role of stages</h3>

<br>
<br>
Sequential (or collisional) engines have been put forward as an alternative
candidate for the realisation of reliable engine setups. Despite this, the role
of the different stages and the influence of the intermediate reservoirs is not
well understood. We introduce the idea of conveniently adjusting/choosing
intermediate reservoirs at engine devices as a strategy for optimizing its
performance. This is done by considering a minimal model composed of a
quantum-dot machine sequentially exposed to distinct reservoirs at each stage,
and for which thermodynamic quantities (including power and efficiency) can be
obtained exactly from the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, irrespective
the number of stages. Results show that a significant gain can be obtained by
increasing the number of stages and conveniently choosing their parameters.

<h3>Magnetic excitation spectrum and Hamiltonian of the quantum spin chain  BaCuTe2O6</h3>

<br>
<br>
The magnetic excitation spectrum and Hamiltonian of the quantum magnet
BaCuTe2O6 is studied by inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and density
functional theory (DFT). INS on powder and single crystal samples reveals
overlapping spinon continuua - the spectrum of an antiferromagnetic spin-1/2
spin chain - due to equivalent chains running along the a, b, and c directions.
Long-range magnetic order onsets below TN = 6.3 K due to interchain
interactions, and is accompanied by the emergence of sharp spin-wave
excitations which replace the continuua at low energies. The spin-wave spectrum
is highly complex and was successfully modelled achieving excellent agreement
with the data. The extracted interactions reveal an intrachain interaction, J3
= 2.9 meV, while the antiferromagnetic hyperkagome interaction J2, is the
sub-leading interaction responsible for coupling the chains together in a
frustrated way. DFT calculations reveal a similar picture for BaCuTe2O6 of
dominant J3 and sub-leading J2 antiferromagnetic interactions and also indicate
a high sensitivity of the interactions to small changes of structure which
could explain the very different Hamiltonians observed in the sister compounds
SrCuTe2O6 and PbCuTe2O6.

<h3>When does an active bath behave as an equilibrium one?</h3>

<br>
<i>Shubhendu Shekhar Khali, Fernando Peruani, Debasish Chaudhuri</i>
<br>
<br>
Active baths are characterized by a non-Gaussian velocity distribution and a
quadratic dependence with active velocity $v_0$ of the kinetic temperature and
diffusion coefficient. While these results hold in over-damped active systems,
inertial effects lead to normal velocity distributions, with kinetic
temperature and diffusion coefficient increasing as $\sim v_0^\alpha$ with
$1<\alpha<2$. Remarkably, the late-time diffusivity and mobility decrease with
mass. Moreover, we show that the equilibrium Einstein relation is
asymptotically recovered with inertia. In summary, the inertial mass restores
an equilibrium-like behavior.

<h3>Understanding the swap Monte Carlo algorithm in a size-polydisperse  model glassformer</h3>

<br>
<i>Niklas Küchler, Jürgen Horbach</i>
<br>
<br>
The dynamics of a polydisperse model glassformer are investigated by
augmenting molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with swap Monte Carlo (SMC).
Three variants of the SMC algorithm are analyzed with regard to convergence and
performance. We elucidate the microscopic mechanism responsible for the drastic
speed-up of structural relaxation at low temperature. It manifests in a
stepwise increase of the mean squared displacement when the time scale between
the application of swap sweeps is significantly larger than a characteristic
microscopic time scale. Compared to Newtonian dynamics, with the hybrid MD-SMC
dynamics the glass transition shifts to a lower temperature and a different
temperature dependence of the localization length is found.

<h3>Andreev reflection at altermagnet/superconductor interface</h3>

<br>
<br>
Altermagnets are a new class of magnetic materials, which exhibit large spin
splitting, but due to the combined spin and real space group symmetry
protection maintain zero net macroscopic magnetization. Such a characteristic
may prove them to be superior in applications in superconducting
heterostructures and thus here we investigate the Andreev reflection at the
altermagnet/superconductor interface. We compare and contrast altermagnets to
other magnetic materials, revealing qualitative differences in the behavior of
altermagnetic junction depending on the Fermi surface orientation. We study the
resonant states arising in setups with strong tunneling barriers and show that
sensitivity to non-magnetic disorder is also dependent on the orientation. Our
results provide a building block for altermagnetic superconducting
heterostructures such as Josephson $\pi$ junctions with superior properties.

<h3>Coexistence of Dirac Fermions and Magnons in a Layered Two-Dimensional  Semiquinoid Metal-Organic Framework</h3>

<i>Christopher Lane, Yixuan Huang, Jian-Xin Zhu</i>
<br>
<br>
We predict the magnetic and electronic properties of a novel metal-organic
framework. By combining density functional theory and density matrix
renormalization group approaches, we find the diatomic Kagome crystal structure
of the metal-semiquinoid framework (H$_2$NMe$_2$)$_2$M$_2$(Cl$_2$dhbq)$_3$ (M =
Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) to host a rich variety of
antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) Dirac semimetallic,
spin-polarized Dirac fermions, and flat band magnetic insulators and metallic
phases. Concomitantly, the spin excitation spectrum of the various magnetic
systems display multiple Dirac-like and nodal-ring crossings. This suggests
that the metal-semiquinoid system is an ideal platform for examining the
intertwining of Dirac fermions and magnons.

<h3>Giant magnetostriction in La2CoMnO6 synthesized by microwave irradiation</h3>

<br>
<br>
Polycrystalline insulating ferromagnetic double perovskite La2CoMnO6
possessing monoclinic structure and a high ferromagnetic Curie temperature (TC
= 222 K) was rapidly synthesized ( 30 min) by irradiating stoichiometric
mixture of oxides with the microwave. The sample exhibits negative
magnetostriction, i.e., contraction of length along the magnetic field
direction in the ferromagnetic state. At 10 K, the parallel magnetostriction
does not show saturation up to a magnetic field of 50 kOe where it reaches 610
ppm which is one of the highest values of magnetostriction found so far among
perovskite oxides with 3d ions. The magnitude of magnetostriction decreases
monotonically as the temperature increases and becomes negligible above TC. The
giant magnetostriction in this double perovskite is suggested to originate from
large spin-orbit coupling associated with Co2+ (d7) cation. The obtained
magnetostriction value is comparable to 630 ppm in an identical composition
obtained through solid-state reaction over several days in a conventional
furnace which indicates the advantages of microwave-assisted synthesis in
saving reaction time and electric power without deteriorating physical
properties.

<h3>Many-body non-Hermitian skin effect under dynamic gauge coupling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03891" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03891</a>
<br>
<i>Haowei Li, Haojie Wu, Wei Zheng, Wei Yi</i>
<br>
<br>
We study an atom-cavity hybrid system where fermionic atoms in a
one-dimensional lattice are subject to a cavity-induced dynamic gauge
potential. The gauge coupling leads to highly-degenerate steady states in which
the fermions accumulate to one edge of the lattice under an open boundary
condition. Such a phenomenon originates from the many-body Liouvillian
superoperator of the system, which, being intrinsically non-Hermitian, is
unstable against boundary perturbations and manifests the non-Hermitian skin
effect. Contrary to the single-body case, the steady state of a multi-atom
system is approached much slower under the open boundary condition, as the
long-time damping of the cavity mode exhibits distinct rates at different
times. This stage-wise slowdown is attributed to the competition between
light-assisted hopping and the dynamic gauge coupling, which significantly
reduces the steady-state degeneracy under the open boundary condition, as
distinct hosts of quasi-steady states dominate the dynamics at different time
scales.

<h3>Self-similar evolution of wave turbulence in Gross-Pitaevskii system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03924" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03924</a>
<br>
<i>Ying Zhu, Boris Semisalov, Giorgio Krstulovic, Sergey Nazarenko</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the universal non-stationary evolution of wave turbulence (WT) in
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Their temporal evolution can exhibit
different kinds of self-similar behavior corresponding to a large-time
asymptotic of the system or to a finite-time blowup. We identify self-similar
regimes in BECs by numerically simulating the forced and unforced
Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) and the associated wave kinetic equation (WKE)
for the direct and inverse cascades, respectively. In both the GPE and the WKE
simulations for the direct cascade, we observe the first-kind self-similarity
that is fully determined by energy conservation. For the inverse cascade
evolution, we verify the existence of a self-similar evolution of the second
kind describing a self-accelerating dynamics of the spectrum leading to blowup
at the zero mode (condensate) at a finite time. We believe that the universal
self-similar spectra found in the present paper are as (more) important and
relevant for understanding the BEC turbulence in past and future experiments as
(than) the commonly studied stationary Kolmogorov-Zakharov (KZ) spectra.

<h3>Thermal features of Heisenberg antiferromagnets on edge- versus  corner-sharing triangular-based lattices: A message from spin waves</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03958" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03958</a>
<br>
<i>Shoji Yamamoto, Jun Ohara</i>
<br>
<br>
We construct modified spin-wave thermodynamics for frustrated noncollinear
antiferromagnets for the first time. The well-known modified spin-wave theory
for collinear antiferromagnets diagonalizes a bosonic Hamiltonian subject to
the constraint that the total staggered magnetization be zero. Applying this
scheme as it is to frustrated noncollinear antiferromagnets ends in a poor
thermodynamics, missing the optimal ground state and breaking the local U(1)
rotational symmetry. We find a new double-constraint modification scheme to
overcome this difficulty, which is tuned especially to frustrated spiral
magnets but spontaneously goes back to the standard single-constraint condition
at the onset of a collinear N\'eel-ordered classical ground state.
We apply this new scheme to triangular-based polyhedral and planar
antiferromagnets with particular interest in a possible contrast between edge-
versus corner-sharing geometries. Under such circumstances that very few
methods are available to calculate finite-temperature properties of frustrated
noncollinear quantum magnets in the thermodynamic limit, our newly developed
modified spin-wave theory predicts that the specific heat of the kagome-lattice
Heisenberg antiferromagnet in the corner-sharing geometry remains having both
mid-temperature broad maximum and low-temperature narrow peak in the
thermodynamic limit, while the specific heat of the triangular-lattice
Heisenberg antiferromagnet in the edge-sharing geometry retains a
low-temperature sharp peak followed by a mid-temperature weak anormaly in the
thermodynamic limit.

<h3>Insights into the Structure and Ion Transport of Pectin-[BMIM][PF$_6$]  Electrolytes</h3>

We investigate the effect of pectin on the structure and ion transport
properties of the room-temperature ionic liquid electrolyte
1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([BMIM][PF$_6$]) using
molecular dynamics simulations. We find that pectin induces intriguing
structural changes in the electrolyte that disrupt large ionic aggregates and
promote the formation of smaller ionic clusters, which is a promising finding
for ionic conductivity. Due to pectin in [BMIM][PF$_6$] electrolytes, the
diffusion coefficient of cations and anions is observed to decrease by a factor
of four for a loading of 25 wt. % in pectin. A strong correlation between the
ionic diffusivities (D) and ion-pair relaxation timescales ($\tau$) is observed
such that D~$\tau^{-0.75}$ for cations and D~$\tau^{-0.82}$ for anions. The
relaxation timescale exponents indicate that the ion transport mechanisms in
pectin-[BMIM][PF$_6$] electrolytes are slightly distinct from those found in
neat [BMIM][PF6] electrolytes. These findings suggest that pectin-based solid
polymer electrolytes may offer improved properties for battery applications,
including ionic conductivity, mechanical stability, and biodegradability.

<br>
<br>
Current-induced spin-orbit torques (SOTs) enable fast and efficient
manipulation of the magnetic state of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), making
it attractive for memory, in-memory computing, and logic applications. However,
the requirement of the external magnetic field to achieve deterministic
switching in perpendicular magnetized SOT-MTJs limits its implementation for
practical applications. Here, we introduce a field-free switching (FFS)
solution for the SOT-MTJ device by shaping the SOT channel to create a "bend"
in the SOT current. The resulting bend in the charge current creates a
spatially non-uniform spin current, which translates into inhomogeneous SOT on
an adjacent magnetic free layer enabling deterministic switching. We
demonstrate FFS experimentally on scaled SOT-MTJs at nanosecond time scales.
This proposed scheme is scalable, material-agnostic, and readily compatible
with wafer-scale manufacturing, thus creating a pathway for developing purely
current-driven SOT systems.

<h3>Mechanisms of DNA-mediated allostery</h3>

<br>
<i>Midas Segers, Aderik Voorspoels, Takahiro Sakaue, Enrico Carlon</i>
<br>
<br>
Proteins often regulate their activities via allostery - or action at a
distance - in which the binding of a ligand at one binding site influences the
affinity for another ligand at a distal site. Although less studied than in
proteins, allosteric effects have been observed in experiments with DNA as
well. In these experiments two or more proteins bind at distinct DNA sites and
interact indirectly with each other, via a mechanism mediated by the linker DNA
molecule. We develop a mechanical model of DNA/protein interactions which
predicts three distinct mechanisms of allostery. Two of these involve an
enthalphy-mediated allostery, while a third mechanism is entropy driven. We
analyze experiments of DNA allostery and highlight the distinctive signatures
allowing one to identify which of the proposed mechanisms best fits the data.

During embryonic development, structures with complex geometry can emerge
from planar epithelial monolayers and to study these shape transitions is of
key importance for revealing the biophysical laws involved in the morphogenesis
of biological systems. Here, using the example of normal proliferative monkey
kidney (COS) cell monolayers, we investigate global and local topological
characteristics of this model system in dependence on its shape. The obtained
distributions of cells by their valence demonstrate a previously undetected
difference between the spherical and planar monolayers. In addition, in both
spherical and planar monolayers, the probability to observe a pair of
neighboring cells with certain valences depends on the topological charge of
the pair. The zero topological charge of the cell pair can increase the
probability for the cells to be the nearest neighbors. We then test and confirm
that analogous relationships take place in a more ordered spherical system with
a larger fraction of 6-valent cells, namely in the non-proliferative epithelium
(follicular system) of ascidian species oocytes. However, unlike spherical COS
cell monolayers, ascidian monolayers are prone to non-random agglomeration of
6-valent cells and have linear topological defects called scars and pleats. The
reasons for this difference in morphology are discussed. The morphological
peculiarities found are compared with predictions of widely used vertex model
of epithelium.

Point defect tolerance in materials, which extends operational lifetime, is
essential for societal sustainability, and the creation of a framework to
design such properties is a grand challenge in the material sciences. Using
three prototypical lead bromide perovskites in single crystal form and
high-resolution synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopy, we reveal the
unexpectedly pivotal role of the A-cation in mediating the influence of
photoinduced defects. Organic A-cation hydrogen bonding facilitates chemical
flexing of the lead-bromide bond that mitigates the self-doping effect of
bromide vacancies. The contribution of partially ionic lead-bromide bonding to
the electronic band edges, where the bonding becomes more ionic upon the
formation of defects, mitigates re-hybridization of the electronic structure
upon degradation. These findings reveal two new general design principles for
defect tolerance in materials. Our findings uncover the foundations of defect
tolerance in halide perovskites and have implications for defect calculations,
all beam-based measurements of photophysical properties and perovskite solar
cell technology.

<h3>Spontaneous rotation of active droplets in two and three dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04018" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04018</a>
<br>
<i>Mehrana R. Nejad, Julia M. Yeomans</i>
<br>
<br>
We use numerical simulations and linear stability analysis to study active
nematic droplets, in the regime where the passive phase is isotropic. We show
that activity leads to the emergence of nematic order and of spontaneous
rotation in both two and three dimensions. In 2D the rotation is caused by the
formation of a chiral $+1$ defect at the center of the drop. With increasing
activity the droplet deforms to an ellipse, and then to a rotating annulus.
Growing droplets form extended active arms which loop around to produce holes.
In 3D the rotation is due to a disclination which loops away from and back to
the surface, defining the rotation axis. In the bulk the disclination loop ends
at a skyrmion. Active extensile flows deform the droplet to an oblate
ellipsoid, contractile flows elongate it along the rotation axis. We compare
our results to examples of cellular rotation in living systems.

<br>
<br>
In this work we investigate the role of exciton resonances in coherent
anti-Stokes Raman scattering (er-CARS) in single walled carbon nanotubes
(SWCNTs). We drive the nanotube system in simultaneous phonon and excitonic
resonances, where we observe a superior enhancement by orders of magnitude
exceeding non-resonant cases. We investigated the resonant effects in five
$(n,m)$ chiralities and find that the er-CARS intensity varies drastically
between different nanotube species. The experimental results are compared with
a perturbation theory model. Finally, we show that such giant resonant
non-linear signals enable rapid mapping and local heating of individualized
CNTs, suggesting easy tracking of CNTs for future nanotoxology studies and
therapeutic application in biological tissues.

<br>
<br>
We study a system of hard-core bosons on a two-dimensional periodic honeycomb
lattice subjected to an on-site potential with alternating signs along
$y$-direction, using machine learning (ML) techniques. The model hosts a rich
phase diagram consisting of six different phases including a charge density
wave, a superfluid phase and two dimer insulator phases, one of which is also a
weak topological insulator with zero Chern number but a non-trivial Berry phase
[SciPost Phys. 10, 059 (2021)]. Using two distinct correlation functions
computed via quantum Monte Carlo method, a relatively simple ML model is able
to learn information from the various phases simultaneously and accurately
predict their phase boundaries. By employing our ML model trained on the
non-interacting dataset, we determine the phase structure of the system in the
presence of nearest-neighbor interactions. Additionally, we investigate the
robustness of the weak topological insulator phase against interactions by
predicting the topological invariant, which is otherwise difficult to obtain.

Patterning antidots ("voids") into well-defined antidot lattices creates an
intriguing class of artificial structures for the periodic modulation of 2D
electron systems, leading to anomalous transport properties and exotic quantum
phenomena as well as enabling the precise bandgap engineering of 2D materials
to address technological bottleneck issues. However, realizing such
atomic-scale quantum antidots (QADs) is infeasible by current nanolithographic
techniques. Here, we report an atomically-precise bottom-up fabrication of a
series of atomic-scale QADs with elegantly engineered quantum states through a
controllable assembly of a chalcogenide single vacancy (SV) in 2D PtTe2, a
type-II Dirac semimetal. Te SVs as atomic-scale "antidots" undergo thermal
migration and assembly into highly-ordered SV lattices spaced by a single Te
atom, reaching the ultimate downscaling limit of antidot lattices. Increasing
the number of SVs in QADs strengthens the cumulative repulsive potential and
consequently enhances collective interference of multiple-pocket scattered
quasiparticles inside QADs, creating multi-level quantum hole states with
tunable gap from telecom to far-infrared regime. Moreover, precisely engineered
quantum hole states of QADs are symmetry-protected and thus survive upon
atom-by-atom oxygen substitutional doping. Therefore, SV-assembled QADs exhibit
unprecedented robustness and property tunability, which not only holds the key
to their future applications but also embody a wide variety of material
technologies.

Polar skyrmions are topologically stable, swirling polarization textures with
particle-like characteristics, which hold promise for next-generation,
nanoscale logic and memory. While understanding of how to create ordered polar
skyrmion lattice structures and how such structure respond to applied electric
fields, temperature, and film thickness remains elusive. Here, using
phase-field simulations, the evolution of polar topology and the emergence of a
phase transition to a hexagonal close-packed skyrmion lattice is explored
through the construction of a temperature-electric field phase diagram for
ultrathin ferroelectric PbTiO3 films. The hexagonal-lattice skyrmion crystal
can be stabilized under application of an external, out-of-plane electric field
which carefully adjusts the delicate interplay of elastic, electrostatic, and
gradient energies. In addition, the lattice constants of the polar skyrmion
crystals are found to increase with film thickness, consistent with expectation
from Kittel law. Our studies pave the way for the development of novel ordered
condensed matter phases assembled from topological polar textures and related
emergent properties in nanoscale ferroelectrics.

<h3>Anisotropic-Isotropic Transition of Cages at the Glass Transition</h3>

<br>
<br>
Characterizing the local structural evolution is an essential step in
understanding the nature of glass transition. In this work, we probe the
evolution of Voronoi cell geometry in simple glass models, and find that the
individual particle cages deform anisotropically in supercooled liquid and
isotropically in glass. We introduce an anisotropy parameter $k$ for each
Voronoi cell, which mean value exhibits a sharp change at the mode-coupling
glass transition $\phi_\mathrm{c}$. Moreover, a power law of packing fraction
$\phi\propto q_1^{-d}$ is discovered in the liquid regime with $d>D$, in
contrast to $d=D$ in the glass regime, where $q_1$ is the first peak position
of structure factor, and $D$ is the space dimension. This power law is
explained by the change of $k$. The active motions in supercooled liquid are
spatially correlated with long axes rather than short axes of Voronoi cells. In
addition, the dynamic slowing down approaching the glass transition can be well
characterized through a modified free volume model based on $k$. These findings
reveal that the nonagnostic structural parameter $k$ determines glassy dynamics
and is effective in identifying the structure-dynamics correlations and the
glass transition.

In the early 2000s, low dimensional systems were predicted to have
topologically nontrivial polar structures, such as vortices or skyrmions,
depending on mechanical or electrical boundary conditions. These structures
have been experimentally observed only in thin film model systems, where they
are engineered by balancing electrostatic charge and elastic distortion
energies. However, the measurement and classification of topological textures
for general ferroelectric nanostructures have remained elusive, as it requires
mapping the local polarization at the atomic scale in three dimensions. Here we
unveil topological polar structures in ferroelectric BaTiO3 nanoparticles via
atomic electron tomography, which enables us to reconstruct the full
three-dimensional arrangement of cation atoms. Our three-dimensional
polarization maps reveal a clear vortex ordering, along with evidence of
size-dependent topological transitions from a single vortex structure to
multiple vortices. These findings not only allow a comprehensive understanding
of the complex topological nature of nanoscale ferroelectrics but also have the
potential for practical applications utilizing contact-free switchable toroidal
moments.

<h3>Nanoindentation-induced evolution of atomic-level properties in silicate  glass: Insights from molecular dynamics simulations</h3>

<br>
<br>
Indentation has been widely used for investigating the mechanical behavior of
glasses. However, how the various microscopic properties (such as atomic
structure and mechanics) of glass evolve from the immediate contact with the
indenter to the far-field regions, and how these observables are correlated to
each other remain largely unknown. Here, using large-scale molecular dynamics
simulations, we investigate the response of a prototypical sodium silicate
glass under shape contact load up to an indentation depth of 25 nm. Both the
short- and intermediate-range structures are found to exhibit notable changes
below the indent, indicating that indentation deformation induces a more
disordered and heterogeneous network structure. In addition, we find that the
indentation-induced changes of local properties all exhibit an exponential
decaying behavior with increasing distance from the indent. Comparison of the
characteristic decay lengths of these local properties indicates that the
structural origins of shear flow and densification are the changes of the
network modifier's coordination environment and the inter-tetrahedral
connection, respectively. The decay of densification is considerably slower
than that of shear strain, implying that the former might contribute more to
the deformation at the far-field regions. Our findings not only contribute to
an atomistic understanding of the indentation response of silicate glasses but
also pave the way towards rational design of damage-resistant glassy materials.

We report a new type of supercurrent diode effect on the surface of a
superconductor with surface states, such as the (001) surface of iron-based
superconductors BaFe$_{2-x}$Co$_x$As$_2$ under in-plane magnetic fields.
Surface supercurrent diode effect can lead to a perfect supercurrent diode in a
considerably wide range of fields. For comparison, the conventional
supercurrent diode effect due to the spin-orbit coupling in a two-dimensional
superconductor cannot be perfect in usual cases. Calculations are within the
Ginzburg-Landau formalism.

The prediction of new high entropy oxides (HEOs) remains a profound challenge
due to their inherent chemical complexity. In this work, we combine
experimental and computational methods to search for new HEOs in the
tetravalent $A$O$_2$ family, using exclusively $d^0$ and $d^{10}$ cations, and
to explain the observed phase stability of the $\alpha$-PbO$_2$ structure, as
found for the medium entropy oxide (Ti, Zr, Hf, Sn)O$_2$. Using a pairwise
approach to approximate the mixing enthalpy, we confirm that $\alpha$-PbO$_2$
is the expected lowest energy structure for this material above other
candidates including rutile, baddeleyite, and fluorite structures. We also show
that no other five-component compound composed of the tetravalent cations
considered here is expected to form under solid state synthesis conditions,
which we verify experimentally. Ultimately, we conclude that the flexible
geometry of the $\alpha$-PbO$_2$ structure can be used to understand its
stability among tetravalent HEOs.

Non-radiative exciton relaxation processes are critical for energy
transduction efficiencies in optoelectronic materials, but how these processes
are connected to the underlying crystal structure and its associated electron,
exciton, and phonon band structures is poorly understood. Here, we present a
first-principles approach to explore exciton relaxation pathways in pentacene,
a paradigmatic molecular crystal and optoelectronic semiconductor. We compute
the momentum- and band-resolved exciton-phonon interactions, and use them to
analyse key scattering channels. We find that exciton intraband transitions on
femtosecond timescales leading to dark-state occupation is a dominant
nonradiative relaxation channel in pentacene. We further show how the nature of
real-time propagation of the exciton wavepacket is connected with the
longitudinal-transverse exciton splitting, stemming from crystal anisotropy,
and concomitant anisotropic exciton and phonon dispersions. Our results provide
a framework for understanding time-resolved exciton propagation and energy
transfer in molecular crystals and beyond.

Ubiquitous in most superconducting materials, weak-links are well-known for
their limiting effect on the critical current. Still, they are at the root of
important features of superconductivity. Using quantitative magneto-optical
imaging and the thermomagnetic model, we correlate local maxima in
magnetization loops of patterned Nb films to a magnetic field-induced
weak-to-strong-link crossover. This tunable phenomenon can be exploited in
superconducting electronics, e.g., flux valves and injectors, or as a simple
strategy to adjust the critical current in specialized devices.

<br>
Neutron scattering is used to study spin waves in the three-dimensional
Heisenberg ferromagnet YTiO$_3$, with spin-spin exchange disorder introduced
$via$ La-substitution at the Y site. No significant changes are observed in the
spin-wave dispersion up to a La concentration of 20%. However, a strong
broadening of the spectrum is found, indicative of shortened spin-wave
lifetimes. Density-functional theory calculations predict minimal changes in
exchange constants as a result of average structural changes due to La
substitution, in agreement with the data. The absence of significant changes in
the spin-wave dispersion, the considerable lifetime effect, and the reduced
ordered magnetic moment previously observed in the La-substituted system are
qualitatively captured by an isotropic, nearest-neighbor, three-dimensional
Heisenberg ferromagnet model with random antiferromagnetic exchange. We
therefore establish Y$_{1-x}$La$_x$TiO$_3$ as a model system to study the
effect of antiferromagnetic spin-exchange disorder in a three-dimensional
Heisenberg ferromagnet.

Given increasing energy storage demands and limited natural resources of Li,
K-ion batteries (KIBs) could be promising next-generation systems having
natural abundance, similar chemistry and energy density. Here, we have
investigated the P3-type K$_{0.5}$TMO$_2$ (where TM = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, or Ni)
systems using density functional theory calculations, as potential positive
intercalation electrodes (or cathodes) for KIBs. Specifically, we have
identified the ground state configurations, and calculated the average
topotactic voltages, electronic structures, on-site magnetic moments, and
thermodynamic stabilities of all P3-K$_{0.5}$TMO$_2$ compositions and their
corresponding depotassiated P3-TMO$_2$ frameworks. We find that K adopts the
honeycomb or zig-zag configuration within each K-layer of all P3 structures
considered, irrespective of the TM. In terms of voltages, we find the Co- and
Ti-based compositions to exhibit the highest (4.59 V vs. K) and lowest (2.24 V)
voltages, respectively, with the TM contributing to the redox behavior upon K
(de-)intercalation. We observe all P3-K$_{0.5}$TMO$_2$ to be (meta)stable, and
hence experimentally synthesizeable according to our 0 K convex hull
calculations, while all depotassiated P3-TMO$_2$ configurations are unstable
and may appear during electrochemical cycling. Also, we verified the stability
of the prismatic coordination environment of K compared to octahedral
coordination at the K$_{0.5}$TMO$_2$ compositions using Rouxel and cationic
potential models. Finally, combining our voltage and stability calculations, we
find P3-K$_x$CoO$_2$ to be the most promising cathode composition, while
P3-K$_x$NiO$_2$ is worth exploring. Our work should contribute to the
exploration of strategies and materials required to make practical KIBs.

Magnetic properties of Hubbard model have been studied extensively. A
theoretical description of these states, however, is not straight forward
within conventional mean-field approach due to the electron correlation
effects. Here we provide a slave spin theory of the magnetic states in the
single band Hubbard model. By introducing an additional decomposition of the
on-site Coulomb interaction in the magnetic channel in both the slave spin and
the fermionic spinon sectors, we show a magnetic solution with renormalized
quasiparticle spectral weight can be stabilized at both half-filling and finite
doping. By comparing the energies of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic
states, we provide a ground-state phase diagram for generic electron filling.
We further discuss possible generalization of the slave-spin method.

<h3>An investigation into the reliability of newly proposed  MoSi$_2$N$_4$/WSi$_2$N$_4$ field-effect transistors: A monte carlo study</h3>

<br>
Recently, the two dimensional complex MA$_2$Z$_4$ structures have been
suggested as suitable replacements for silicon channels in field-effect
transistors (FETs). Specifically, two materials of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ and
WSi$_2$N$_4$ due to their very desirable electrical and thermal properties are
noticed. On the other hand, the reliability of transistors, which is determined
by the maximum temperature they obtain during the performance, specifies the
usefulness of the newly proposed channels for thermal management solution. In
this work, the FETs, including MoSi$_2$N$_4$ and WSi$_2$N$_4$ channels, are
investigated using Monte Carlo simulation of the phonon Boltzmann equation. In
particular, the phonon analysis has been carried out to investigate the peak
temperature rise. Our calculations confirm that MoSi$_2$N$_4$ and WSi$_2$N$_4$
present lower maximum temperature than the previously suggested candidate, the
blue phosphorene (BP) which itself reaches a shallow temperature. Concretely,
the phonon exploration shows that the competition between the dominant heat
carrier velocity, and its related frequency settles the maximum temperature
value. The material WSi$_2$N$_4$ with much more phonons in TA mode, with almost
high velocity and relatively low-frequency, shows adequate thermal condition,
and its peak temperature is very low, say 110 K, less than that of BP. The
material MoSi$_2$N$_4$ attains the maximum temperature of only 10 K less than
BP peak temperature. This behavior attributes to the dominant LA phonons which
are fast but also have high frequency and consequently make the temperature get
larger than that of the WSi$_2$N$_4$. In summary, WSi$_2$N$_4$, with very low
peak temperature, and in the next step MoSi$_2$N$_4$, both with beneficial
electrical/thermal properties, are suggested as very suitable candidates for
producing more reliable FETs, fulfilling the thermal management.

<br>
<br>
A first-principles approach to describe electron dynamics in open quantum
systems driven far from equilibrium via external time-dependent stimuli is
introduced. Within this approach, the driven Liouville von Neumann methodology
is used to impose open boundary conditions on finite model systems, whose
dynamics is described using time-dependent density functional theory. As proof
of concept, the developed methodology is applied to simple spin-compensated
model systems including a hydrogen chain and a graphitic molecular junction.
Good agreement between steady-state total currents obtained via direct
propagation and from the self-consistent solution of the corresponding
Sylvester equation indicates the validity of the implementation. The capability
of the new computational approach to analyze, from first principles,
non-equilibrium dynamics of open quantum systems in terms of temporally and
spatially resolved current densities is demonstrated. Future extensions of the
approach towards the description of dynamical magnetization and decoherence
effects are briefly discussed.

<br>
It is known that in thermal systems of finite size that are subject to second
order phase transitions and until the spontaneous symmetry breaking is
completed, the fluctuations of the order parameter obey to the dynamics of
critical intermittency. Beyond the SSB, critical intermittency does not hold.
Thus, it is not expected that the distribution of the waiting times in the
order parameter timeseries would hold any power law. However we reveal for the
first time that right after the SSB, power laws still exist within a small zone
of temperatures. These power laws emerge due to another form of intermittency
that determines the dynamics of the order parameter fluctuations in the
beginning of the tricritical crossover, without this crossover ever being
completed in a first order phase transition. In the work pesented hereby, we
present and explain this change of the dynamics of the order parameter
fluctuations, as the temperature drops under the temperature of the SSB.
Finally, it is mentioned that such a phenomenon has been already observed in
preseismic processes.

<br>
<br>
Ultrafast carrier and phonon dynamics at the buried heterointerface of
GaP/Si(001) are investigated by means of two-color pump-probe reflectivity
measurements. The carrier-induced reflectivity signal exhibits a resonant
enhancement at pump-photon energies of 1.4 eV, which can be assigned to an
optical transition between electronic interface states. The transient
reflectivity is modulated by a coherent oscillation at 2 THz, whose amplitude
also becomes maximum at 1.4 eV. The observed resonant behavior of the phonon
mode in combination with a characteristic wavelength-dependence of, both, its
frequency and initial phase, strongly indicate that the 2-THz mode is a
difference-combination mode of a GaP-like and a Si-like phonon at the
heterointerface and that this second-order scattering process can be enhanced
by a double resonance involving the interfacial electronic states.

Enhancement of Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{C}$) of two-dimensional (2D)
magnets is immensely desirable for room temperature spintronic applications.
Fe$_{5}$GeTe$_{2}$ is an exceptional van der Waals metallic ferromagnet due to
its tunable physical properties and relatively higher $T_\mathrm{C}$ than other
2D magnets. Using density functional theory combined with dynamical mean field
theory and Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the $T_\mathrm{C}$ of
Fe$_{5}$GeTe$_{2}$ monolayer can increase well-above room temperature by
substitutional doping with Ni. It is found that two specific sublattices (Fe1
and Fe4) are the first and second most energetically preferred occupation sites
for Ni. $T_\mathrm{C}$ of Fe$_{5-\delta}$Ni$_{\delta}$GeTe$_{2}$ increases up
to $\sim$ 400 K at $\delta \sim$20\%. Exchange interactions between particular
Fe5-Fe4 pairs play a dominating role in tuning the transition temperature,
influenced by doping-induced structural distortions. Finally, we highlight the
effect of dynamical electron correlation in site-specific electronic structure
and quasi-particle mass of Fe-$d$ orbitals with varying Ni dopi

Herein, we present a detailed study of the structural, optical, and
electrochemical responses of Gd$_2$O$_3$ doped with nickel zinc ferrite
nanoparticles. Doping of Ni$_{0.5}$Zn$_{0.5}$Fe$_2$O$_4$ nanoparticles to
Gd$_2$O$_3$ powder was done through thermal decomposition at 1000 C. The
average grain size of the mixture was determined to be approximately 95 nm, and
phases of cubic Gd$_2$O$_3$, GdO, and orthorhombic prisms of GdFeO$_3$ were
identified. The focused ion beam energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (FIB-EDX)
mapping results clearly show the morphology of the particles with Gd and Fe as
the dominant elements. The structural data were compared with the spectroscopic
measurements confirming the formation of multiple phases of oxides and
ferrites. The measured optical band gap is significantly redshifted to 1.8 eV
and is close to that of nitride compounds of gadolinium metal. The measured
specific capacitance was almost 7 Fg-1 at a current density of 1 Ag-1, showing
a small drop of 27% when the current density is increased to 10 Ag-1. Cyclic
voltammetry (CV) plots of the ferrite doped Gd2O3 electrode at a scan rate of 5
to 100 mV/s indicate the pseudocapacitive nature of the material.

Creating single photons in the telecommunication wavelength range from
semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) and interfacing them with spins of electrons
or holes has been of high interest in recent years, with research mainly
focusing on indium based QDs. However, there is not much data on the optical
and spin properties of galliumantimonide (GaSb) QDs, despite it being a
physically rich system with an indirect to direct bandgap crossover in the
telecom wavelength range. Here, we investigate the (quantum-) optical
properties of GaSb quantum dots, which are fabricated by filling droplet-etched
nanoholes in an aluminum-galliumantimonide (AlGaSb) matrix. We observe
photoluminescence (PL) features from isolated and highly symmetric QDs that
exhibit narrow linewidth in the telecom S-band and show an excitonic fine
structure splitting of $\Delta E=(12.0\pm0.5)\mu eV$. Moreover, we perform
time-resolved measurements of the decay characteristics of an exciton and
measure the second-order photon autocorrelation function of the charge complex
to $g^{(2)}(0)=0.16\pm0.02$, revealing clear antibunching and thus proving the
capability of this material platform to generate non-classical light.

In this series of lectures, we discuss the basic theoretical concepts of
magnonics and spintronics. We first briefly recall the relevant topics from
quantum mechanics, electrodynamics of continuous media, and basic theory of
magnetism. We then discuss the classical theory of magnetic dynamics:
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic resonance, dynamic susceptibilities, and
spin waves. We open the main discussion with phenomena of spin and exchange
spin currents, spin torques, the spin Hall effect, and the spin Hall and Hanle
magnetoresistance. Special emphasis is given to the effects of spin transfer
torque and spin pumping, where we follow the celebrated derivation utilizing
Landauer quantum multi-channel scattering matrix approach. Finally, we outline
the most important features distinguishing antiferromagnetic dynamics from
ferromagnetic one, which make antiferromagnets particularly promising material
candidates for spintronics and magnonics.

An experimental determination of electronic phase diagrams of high-transition
temperature (high-$T_c$) superconductors forms the basis for a microscopic
understanding of unconventional superconductivity. For most high-$T_c$
superconductors, the electronic phase diagrams are established through partial
chemical substitution, which also induces lattice disorder. Here we show that
symmetry-specific uniaxial strain can be used to study electronic phases in
iron-based superconductors, composed of two-dimensional nearly square iron
lattice planed separated by other elements. By applying tunable uniaxial strain
along different high symmetry directions and carrying out transport
measurements, we establish strain-tuning dependent electronic nematicity,
antiferromagnetic (AF) order, and superconductivity of
BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_2$ superconductor. We find that uniaxial strain
along the nearest Fe-Fe direction can dramatically tune the AF order and
superconductivity, producing an electronic phase diagram clearly different from
the chemical substitution-induced one. Our results thus establish strain tuning
as a way to study the intertwined orders in correlated electron materials
without using chemical substitution.

The Josephson junction is typically tuned by a magnetic field or
electrostatic gates to realize a superconducting transistor, which manipulates
the supercurrent in integrated superconducting circuits. However, this tunable
method does not achieve simultaneous control for the supercurrent phase (phase
difference between two superconductors) and magnitude. Here, we propose a novel
scheme for the light-controlled superconducting transistor, which is composed
of two superconductor leads linked by a coherent light-driven quantum dot. We
discover a Josephson-like relation for supercurrent
$I_{\mathrm{s}}=I_{c}(\Phi)\,\sin\Phi$, where both supercurrent phase $\Phi$
and magnitude $I_{c}$ could be entirely controlled by the phase, intensity, and
detuning of the driving light. Additionally, the supercurrent magnitude
displays a Fano profile with the increase of the driving light intensity, which
is clearly understood by comparing the level splitting of the quantum dot under
light driving and the superconducting gap. Moreover, when two such
superconducting transistors form a loop, they make up a light-controlled
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). Such a light-controlled
SQUID could demonstrate the Josephson diode effect, and the optimized
non-reciprocal efficiency achieves up to $54\%$, surpassing the maximum record
reported in recent literature. Thus, our feasible scheme delivers a promising
platform to perform diverse and flexible manipulations in superconducting
circuits.

<h3>Enhanced Itinerant Ferromagnetism in Hole-doped Transition Metal Oxides:  Beyond the Canonical Double Exchange Mechanism</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04459" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04459</a>

<br>
<br>
Here we demonstrate the occurrence of robust itinerant ferromagnetism in
Mott-Hubbard systems at both low and high doping concentrations. Specifically,
we study the effect of hole doping on the experimentally synthesized LaCrAsO
via first-principles calculations and observe that the parent G-type
antiferromagnetism vanishes quickly at low doping concentration ($x$ $\sim$
0.20) and the system becomes ferromagnetic metal due to the canonical double
exchange (CDE) mechanism. As $x$ continues to increase, the onsite energy
difference between Cr 3$d$ and As 4$p$ orbitals decreases and the system
transitions to a ferromagnetic negative charge-transfer energy metal.
Therefore, the itinerant ferromagnetism doesn't terminate at intermediate $x$
as CDE mechanism usually predicts. Furthermore, our calculations reveal that
both nearest and next-nearest ferromagnetic exchange coupling strengths keep
growing with $x$, showing that ferromagnetism caused by negative
charge-transfer energy state is "stronger" than that of CDE picture. Our work
not only unveils an alternative mechanism of itinerant ferromagnetism, but also
has the potential to attract immediate interest among experimentalists.

The integration of high-temperature superconducting YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO) into
flexible electronic devices has the potential to revolutionize the technology
industry. The effective preparation of high-quality flexible YBCO films
therefore plays a key role in this development. We present a novel approach for
transferring water-sensitive YBCO films onto flexible substrates without any
buffer layer. Freestanding YBCO film on a polydimethylsiloxane substrate is
extracted by etching the Sr3Al2O6 sacrificial layer from the LaAlO3 substrate.
A comprehensive characterization involving multiple experimental techniques
including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron
microscopy, Raman and X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy is conducted to investigate
the morphology, structural and electronic properties of the YBCO film before
and after the extraction process where it shows the preservation of the
structural and superconductive properties of the freestanding YBCO virtually in
its pristine state. Further investigation reveals the formation of a YBCO
passivated layer serves as a protective layer which effectively preserves the
inner section of the freestanding YBCO during the etching process. This work
plays a key role in actualizing the fabrication of flexible oxide thin films
and opens up new possibilities for a diverse range of device applications
involving thin-films and low-dimensional materials.

<br>
<br>
Studying the upper critical field ($\mu_0$$H$$_{\rm{c2}}$) and its anisotropy
of superconductors is of great importance because it can provide an unusual
insight into the pair-breaking mechanism. Since Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_x$
exhibits the high $\mu_0$$H$$_{\rm{c2}}$ and small anisotropic
superconductivity, it has attracted considerable attention. However, some
issues related to $\mu_0$$H$$_{\rm{c2}}$ are still unknown, including the
effect of excess Fe content on $\mu_0$$H$$_{\rm{c2}}$ behavior and the origin
of the crossover of the $\mu_0H_{\rm{c2}}^c $ -- $ T$ and
$\mu_0H_{\rm{c2}}^{ab}$ -- $T$ curves. In this work, the value of
$\mu_0$$H$$_{\rm{c2}}$ of Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{0.6}$Se$_{0.4}$ single crystals with
controlled amounts of excess Fe was obtained by resistivity measurements over a
wide range of temperatures down to $\sim$ 1.5 K, and magnetic fields up to
$\sim$ 60 T. The crossover of the $\mu_0H_{\rm{c2}}^c $ -- $ T$ and
$\mu_0H_{\rm{c2}}^{ab}$ -- $T$ curves was found to be independent of the excess
Fe content. The angle dependence of $\mu_0H_{\rm{c2}}$ was also checked. The
$\mu_0H_{\rm{c2}}(\theta)$ symmetry at higher temperature near $T_c$ could be
fitted by anisotropic G-L model, and novel fourfold symmetry of
$\mu_0H_{\rm{c2}}$ at lower temperature was found. Based on our spin-locking
pairing model, the crossover behavior originates from the anisotropic
spin-paramagnetic effect, and the novel fourfold symmetry of $\mu_0H_{\rm{c2}}$
could be understood by our extended anisotropic G-L model.

Structure formation in non-equilibrium steady state conditions is poorly
understood. Non-equilibrium steady state can be achieved in a system by
maintaining temperature gradient. A class of cross-linked micro-gel particles,
poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (PNIPAM, are reported to increase in size due to
adsorption of water as temperature decreases. Here we study thermo-responsive
particles with temperature sensitive diameter in presence of temperature
gradient, using Molecular dynamics simulation with Langevin thermostat. We find
long-ranged structural order using bond order parameters in both cold and hot
region of the system beyond a certain diameter ratio of the cold and hot
particles. This is due to increase in packing and pressure in both regions. Our
observations might be useful in understanding ordered structures in extreme
conditions of non-equilibrium steady state.

<h3>Thermodynamic Trade-off Relation for First Passage Time in Resetting  Process</h3>

<br>
Resetting is a strategy for boosting the speed of a target-searching process.
Since its introduction over a decade ago, most studies have been carried out
under the assumption that resetting takes place instantaneously. However, due
to its irreversible nature, resetting processes incur a thermodynamic cost,
which becomes infinite in case of instantaneous resetting. Here, we take into
consideration both the cost and first passage time (FPT) required for a
resetting process, in which the reset or return to the initial location is
implemented using a trapping potential over a finite but random time period. An
iterative generating function and counting functional method \`a la Feynman and
Kac are employed to calculate the FPT and average work for this process. From
these results, we obtain an explicit form of the time-cost trade-off relation,
which provides the lower bound of the mean FPT for a given work input when the
trapping potential is linear. This trade-off relation clearly shows that
instantaneous resetting is achievable only when an infinite amount of work is
provided. More surprisingly, the trade-off relation derived from the linear
potential seems to be valid for a wide range of trapping potentials. In
addition, we have also shown that the fixed-time or sharp resetting can further
enhance the trade-off relation compared to that of the stochastic resetting.

Angle-resolved spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements are carried
out in heterostructures consisting of Py (Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$) and a
noncollinear antiferromagnetic quantum material $\gamma-$IrMn$_{3}$. The
structural characterization reveals that $\gamma-$IrMn$_{3}$ is polycrystalline
in nature. A large exchange bias of 158~Oe is found in Py/$\gamma-$IrMn$_{3}$
at room temperature, while $\gamma-$IrMn$_{3}$/Py and Py/Cu/$\gamma-$IrMn$_{3}$
exhibited no exchange bias. Regardless of the exchange bias and stacking
sequence, we observe a substantial unconventional out-of-plane anti-damping
torque when $\gamma-$IrMn$_{3}$ is in direct contact with Py. The magnitude of
the out-of-plane spin-orbit torque efficiency is found to be twice as large as
the in-plane spin-orbit torque efficiency. The unconventional spin-orbit torque
vanishes when a Cu spacer is introduced between Py and $\gamma-$IrMn$_{3}$,
indicating that the unconventional spin-orbit torque in this system originates
at the interface. These findings are important for realizing efficient
antiferromagnet-based spintronic devices via interfacial engineering.

Superconducting germanium films are an intriguing material for possible
applications in fields such as cryogenic electronics and quantum bits.
Recently, there has been great deal of progress in hyperdoping of Ga doped Ge
using ion implantation. The thin film growths would be advantageous allowing
homoepitaxy of doped and undoped Ge films opening possibilities for vertical
Josephson junctions. Here, we present our studies on the growth of one layer of
hyperdoped superconducting germanium thin film via molecular beam epitaxy. We
observe a fragile superconducting phase which is extremely sensitive to
processing conditions and can easily phase-segregate, forming a percolated
network of pure gallium metal. By suppressing phase segregation through
temperature control we find a superconducting phase that is unique and appears
coherent to the underlying Ge substrate.

<h3>Epithelial-substrate coupling strength regulates the landscape of the  traction in cohesive monolayers: a parametric study and a revisit to "size  effect"</h3>

Epithelial cells can assemble into cohesive colonies and collectively
interact with substrates by generating extracellular forces through focal
adhesions. Recently, a molecularly based thermodynamic model, which integrates
both the monolayer elasticity and force-mediated focal adhesion formation, has
been developed to elucidate the regulation of the cellular force landscape
induced by the active epithelial-substrate coupling. However, how
epithelial-substrate coupling strength mediate the landscapes of the traction,
the cellular displacement, and the focal adhesion distribution in a cohesive
monolayer remains unexamined in details. In this work, we follow the procedures
by the previous work to re-formulate the free energy of the
epithelial-substrate system and obtain the thermodynamic steady-state
equations. We then derive a simplified form of the complete equation system,
and solve it both semi-analytically and numerically. We find that the parameter
which characterizes the epithelial-substrate coupling strength can
significantly affect the landscapes of the traction the cellular displacement,
and the focal adhesion distribution. We also revisit the "size effect"
addressed by previous works and demonstrate that such effect is the natural
outcome of a strong epithelial-substrate coupling without introducing any extra
factors. For epithelial-substrate coupling which is not strong enough, the
currently observed "size effect" does not hold. A scaling law that determines
whether the previously observed "size effect" holds is proposed based on our
model.

Quantum anomalies are the breakdowns of classical conservation laws that
occur in quantum-field theory description of a physical system. They appear in
relativistic field theories of chiral fermions and are expected to lead to
anomalous transport properties in Weyl semimetals. This includes a chiral
anomaly, which is a violation of the chiral current conservation that takes
place when a Weyl semimetal is subjected to parallel electric and magnetic
fields. A charge pumping between Weyl points of opposite chirality causes the
chiral magnetic effect that has been extensively studied with electrical
transport. On the other hand, if the thermal gradient, instead of the
electrical field, is applied along the magnetic field, then as a consequence of
the gravitational (also called the thermal chiral) anomaly an energy pumping
occurs within a pair of Weyl cones. As a result, this is expected to generate
anomalous heat current contributing to the thermal conductivity. We report an
increase of both the magneto-electric and magneto-thermal conductivities in
quasi-classical regime of the magnetic Weyl semimetal NdAlSi. Our work also
shows that the anomalous electric and heat currents, which occur due to the
chiral magnetic effect and gravitational anomalies respectively, are still
linked by a 170 years old relation called the Wiedemann-Franz law.

The paper analyzes the entropy of a system composed by non-interacting and
indistinguishable particles whose quantum state numbers are modelled as
independent and identically distributed classical random variables. The crucial
observation is that, under this assumption, whichever is the number of
particles that constitute the system, the occupancy numbers of system's quantum
(micro)states are multinomially distributed. This observation leads to an
entropy formula for the physical system, which is nothing else than the entropy
formula of the multinomial distribution, for which we claim novelty, in the
sense that it is proposed here for the first time that the entropy of the
multinomial distribution is the entropy of the physical system. The entropy
formula of the multinomial distribution unveils yet unexplored connections
between information theory and statistical mechanics, among which we mention
the connection between conditional entropy of the random microstate given the
random occupancy numbers and the Boltzmann-Planck entropy $\log(W)$ and between
these two and the Gibbs correction term $\log(N!)$, thermalization and
communication-theoretic preparation of a thermal state, accessible information
of the thermal state and physical entropy of the thermalized system. A
noticeable specific result that descends from our approach is the exact quantum
correction to the textbook Sackur-Tetrode formula for the entropy of an ideal
gas at the thermal equilibrium in a container.

Defect-free graphene is impermeable to all atoms and ions at ambient
conditions. Experiments that can resolve gas flows of a few atoms per hour
through micrometre-sized membranes found that monocrystalline graphene is
completely impermeable to helium, the smallest of atoms. Such membranes were
also shown to be impermeable to all ions, including the smallest one, lithium.
On the other hand, graphene was reported to be highly permeable to protons,
nuclei of hydrogen atoms. There is no consensus, however, either on the
mechanism behind the unexpectedly high proton permeability or even on whether
it requires defects in graphene's crystal lattice. Here using high resolution
scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), we show that, although proton
permeation through mechanically-exfoliated monolayers of graphene and hexagonal
boron nitride cannot be attributed to any structural defects, nanoscale
non-flatness of 2D membranes greatly facilitates proton transport. The spatial
distribution of proton currents visualized by SECCM reveals marked
inhomogeneities that are strongly correlated with nanoscale wrinkles and other
features where strain is accumulated. Our results highlight nanoscale
morphology as an important parameter enabling proton transport through 2D
crystals, mostly considered and modelled as flat, and suggest that strain and
curvature can be used as additional degrees of freedom to control the proton
permeability of 2D materials.

Observing stochastic trajectories with rare transitions between states,
practically undetectable on time scales accessible to experiments, makes it
impossible to directly quantify the entropy production and thus infer whether
and how far systems are from equilibrium. To solve this issue for Markovian
jump dynamics, we show a lower bound that outperforms any other estimation of
entropy production (including Bayesian approaches) in regimes lacking data due
to the strong irreversibility of state transitions. Moreover, in the limit of
complete irreversibility, our novel effective version of the thermodynamic
uncertainty relation sets a lower bound to entropy production that depends only
on non-dissipative aspects of the dynamics. Such an approach is also valuable
when dealing with jump dynamics with a deterministic limit, such as
irreversible chemical reactions.

<h3>Ultralow power and shifting-discretized magnetic racetrack memory device  driven by chirality switching and spin current</h3>

<br>
<br>
Magnetic racetrack memory has significantly evolved and developed since its
first experimental verification and is considered as one of the most promising
candidates for future high-density on-chip solid state memory. However, the
lack of a fast and precise magnetic domain wall (DW) shifting mechanism and the
required extremely high DW motion (DWM) driving current both make the racetrack
difficult to commercialize. Here, we propose a method for coherent DWM that is
free from above issues, which is driven by chirality switching (CS) and an
ultralow spin-orbit-torque (SOT) current. The CS, as the driving force of DWM,
is achieved by the sign change of DM interaction which is further induced by a
ferroelectric switching voltage. The SOT is used to break the symmetry when the
magnetic moment is rotated to the Bloch direction. We numerically investigate
the underlying principle and the effect of key parameters on the DWM through
micromagnetic simulations. Under the CS mechanism, a fast (102 m/s), ultralow
energy (5 attojoule), and precisely discretized DWM can be achieved.
Considering that skyrmions with topological protection and smaller size are
also promising for future racetrack, we similarly evaluate the feasibility of
applying such a CS mechanism to a skyrmion. However, we find that the CS only
causes it to "breathe" instead of moving. Our results demonstrate that the CS
strategy is suitable for future DW racetrack memory with ultralow power
consumption and discretized DWM.

Co3Sn2S2 and AV3Sb5. Inspired by the intriguing properties of these compounds,
we investigate the temperature-dependent electromagnetic properties of ScV6Sn6,
a non-magnetic charge density wave (CDW) compound. We found AHC of the order of
104 with a 20 % of anomalous Hall angle, which are fully consistent with the
CDW phase and disappear above the CDW transition. Moreover, only the
topological Fermi surfaces containing cone and van Hove singularity are
typically active and exhibit the Shubnikov de-Haas oscillations, contrary to
those displayed by AV3Sb5, with an average of 70-fold increase in the momentum
conserving time in the CDW phase. Combining these interesting physical
properties with the CDW phase, ScV6Sn6 presents a unique material example of
the versatile HfFe6Ge6 family and provides various promising opportunities to
explore the series further.

At sufficiently high concentrations, motile bacteria suspended in fluids
exhibit a range of ordered and disordered collective motions. Here we explore
the combined effects of confinement, periodicity and curvature induced by the
active motion of E. coli bacteria in a thin spherical shell (cortex) of an
oil-water-oil (O/B/O) double emulsion drop. Confocal microscopy of the
bacterial flow fields shows that at high density and activity, they exhibit
azimuthal zonal flows which oscillate between counterclockwise and clockwise
circulating states. We characterize these oscillatory patterns via their
Fourier spectra and the distributions of their circulation persistence times.
To explain our observations, we used numerical simulations of active particles
and characterize the two-dimensional phase space of bacterial packing fraction
and activity associated with persistent collective motions. All together, our
study shows how geometric effects lead to new types of collective dynamics.

This letter reports a highly scaled 90 nm gate length beta-Ga2O3 T-gate
MOSFET with no current collapse and record power gain cut off frequency (fMAX).
The epitaxial stack of 60 nm thin channel MOSFET was grown by Molecular Beam
Epitaxy (MBE) and highly doped (n++) contact regrowth was carried out by Metal
Organic Chemical Vapour Deposition (MOCVD) in the source/drain region. Maximum
on current (IDS, MAX) of 160 mA/mm and transconductance (gm) around 36 mS/mm
was measured at VDS= 10 V for LSD= 1.5 micrometer channel length.
Transconductance is limited by higher channel sheet resistance (Rsheet). We
observed no current collapse for both drain and gate lag measurement even at
higher VDG,Q quiescent bias points. This is the first report of Ga2O3 FET
showing no current collapse without any external passivation. Breakdown voltage
around 125 V was reported for LGD= 1.2 micrometer. We extracted 27 GHz current
gain cut off frequency (fT) and 100 GHz fMAX for 20 V drain bias. fMAX value
mentioned here is the highest for Ga2O3 and the first demonstration of 100 GHz
operation. fT. VBR product of 3.375 THz.V has been calculated which is
comparable with state-of-art GaN HEMT. This letter suggests that Ga2O3 can be a
suitable candidate for X-band application.

Following the general theory of categorified quantum groups developed by the
author previously (arxiv:2304.07398), we construct the 2-Drinfel'd double
associated to a finite group $N=G_0$. For $N=\mathbb{Z}_2$, we explicitly
compute the braided 2-categories of 2-representations of certain version of
this 2-Drinfel'd double, and prove that they characterize precisely the 4d
toric code and its spin-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ variant. This result relates the two
descriptions (categorical vs. field theoretical) of 4d gapped topological
phases in existing literature and, perhaps more strikingly, displays the first
ever instances of {higher Tannakian duality} for braided 2-categories. In
particular, we show that particular twists of the underlying 2-Drinfel'd double
is responsible for much of the higher-structural properties that arise in 4d
topological orders.

<h3>Photo-accelerated hot carrier transfer at MoS2/WS2:a first-principles  study</h3>

Charge transfer in type-II heterostructures plays important roles in
determining device performance for photovoltaic and photocatalytic
applications. However, current theoretical studies of charge transfer process
don't consider the effects of operating conditions such as illuminations and
yield systemically larger interlayer transfer time of hot electrons in MoS2/WS2
compared to experimental results. Here in this work, we propose a general
picture that, illumination can induce interfacial dipoles in type-II
heterostructures, which can accelerate hot carrier transfer by reducing the
energy difference between the electronic states in separate materials and
enhancing the nonadiabatic couplings. Using the first-principles calculations
and the ab-initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, we demonstrate this picture
using MoS2/WS2 as a prototype. The calculated characteristic time for the
interlayer transfer (60 fs) and the overall relaxation (700 fs) processes of
hot electrons is in good agreement with the experiments. We further find that
illumination mainly affects the ultrafast interlayer transfer process but has
little effects on the relatively slow intralayer relaxation process. Therefore,
the overall relaxation process of hot electrons has a saturated time with
increased illumination strengths. The illumination-accelerated charge transfer
is expected to universally exist in type-II heterostructures.

Modeling of physical systems must be based on their suitability to
unavoidable physical laws. In this work, in the context of classical,
isothermal, finite-time, and weak drivings, I demonstrate that physical
systems, driven simultaneously at the same rate in two or more external
parameters, must have the Fourier transform of their relaxation functions
composing a positive-definite matrix in order to satisfy the Second Law of
Thermodynamics. By evaluating them in the limit of near-to-equilibrium
processes, I identify that such coefficients are nothing more than the Onsager
ones. The result is verified in paradigmatic models, where the extended Onsager
matrices of the overdamped and underdamped white noise Brownian motions, driven
simultaneously at the same rate in the stiffening and moving laser traps, are
positive-definite.

Single-crystal growth, magnetic properties, and magnetocaloric effect of the
$S = 3/2$ kagome ferromagnet Li$_9$Cr$_3$(P$_2$O$_7$)$_3$(PO$_4$)$_2$
(trigonal, space group: $P\bar{3}c1$) are reported. Magnetization data suggest
dominant ferromagnetic intra-plane coupling with a weak anisotropy and the
onset of ferromagnetic ordering at $T_{\rm C} \simeq 2.6$ K. Microscopic
analysis reveals a very small ratio of interlayer to intralayer ferromagnetic
couplings ($J_{\perp}/J \simeq 0.02$). Electron spin resonance data suggest the
presence of short-range correlations above $T_{\rm C}$ and confirms
quasi-two-dimensional character of the spin system. A large magnetocaloric
effect characterized by isothermal entropy change of $-\Delta S_{\rm m}\simeq
31$ J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ and adiabatic temperature change of $-\Delta T_{\rm
ad}\simeq 9$ K upon a field sweep of 7 T is observed around $T_{\rm C}$. This
leads to a large relative cooling power of $RCP \simeq 284$ J kg$^{-1}$. The
large magnetocaloric effect, together with negligible hysteresis render
Li$_9$Cr$_3$(P$_2$O$_7$)$_3$(PO$_4$)$_2$ a promising material for magnetic
refrigeration at low temperatures. The magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant
$K \simeq -7.42 \times 10^4$ erg cm$^{-3}$ implies that the compound is an
easy-plane type ferromagnet with the hard axis normal to the $ab$-plane,
consistent with the magnetization data.

With the help of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) it has become possible
to address single magnetic impurities on superconducting surfaces and to
investigate the peculiar properties of the in-gap states known as
Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states. However, until very recently YSR states were
only investigated with conventional tunneling spectroscopy, missing the crucial
information contained in other transport properties such as shot noise. Here,
we adapt the concept of full counting statistics (FCS) to provide a very deep
insight into the spin-dependent transport in these hybrid systems. We
illustrate the power of FCS by analyzing different situations in which YSR
states show up including single-impurity junctions, as well as double-impurity
systems where one can probe the tunneling between individual YSR states. The
FCS concept allows us to unambiguously identify every tunneling process that
plays a role in these situations. Moreover, FCS provides all the relevant
transport properties, including current, shot noise and all the cumulants of
the current distribution. Our approach can reproduce the experimental results
recently reported on the shot noise of a single-impurity junction with a normal
STM tip. We also predict the signatures of resonant (and non-resonant) multiple
Andreev reflections in the shot noise of single-impurity junctions with two
superconducting electrodes. In the case of double-impurity junctions we show
that the direct tunneling between YSR states is characterized by a strong
reduction of the Fano factor that reaches a minimum value of 7/32, a new
fundamental result in quantum transport. The FCS approach presented here can be
naturally extended to investigate the spin-dependent superconducting transport
in a variety of situations, and it is also suitable to analyze multi-terminal
superconducting junctions, irradiated contacts, and many other basic
situations.

<h3>Equilibration of Topological Defects at the Deconfined Quantum Critical  Point</h3>

<br>
<i>Yu-Rong Shu, Shao-Kai Jian, Anders W. Sandvik, Shuai Yin</i>
<br>
<br>
Deconfined quantum criticality (DQC) arises from fractionalization of
quasi-particles and leads to fascinating behaviors beyond the
Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson (LGW) description of phase transitions. The unusual
aspects of DQC in equilibrium also suggest exotic phenomena out of equilibrium,
which are still largely unexplored. Here we study manifestations of DQC when
driving (quantum annealing) a two-dimensional quantum magnet through a critical
point separating antiferromagnetic and spontaneously dimerized ground states.
Numerical simulations show that the celebrated Kibble-Zurek scaling (KZS)
mechanism is inadequate for describing the annealing process. To explain our
results, we introduce the concept of dual asymmetric KZS, where a deconfinement
time enters in addition to the conventional relaxation time and the scaling
also depends on the direction in which the system is driven through the
critical point according to a duality principle connecting the topological
defects in the two phases. These defects -- spinons in the dimerized phase and
space-time hedgehogs in the antiferromagnetic phase -- require a much longer
time scale for equilibration than the amplitude of the order parameter. Beyond
the new insights into DQC, our scaling approach provides a new window into
out-of-equilibrium criticality with multiple length and time scales.

In the recent years, the thermal Hall transport has risen as an important
diagnosis of the physical properties of the elementary excitations in various
quantum materials, especially among the Mott insulating systems where the
electronic transports are often featureless. Here we review the recent
development of thermal Hall effects in quantum magnets where all the relevant
excitations are charge-neutral. In addition to summarizing the existing
experiments, we pay a special attention to the underlying mechanisms of the
thermal Hall effects in various magnetic systems, and clarify the connection
between the microscopic physical variables and the emergent degrees of freedom
in different quantum phases. The external magnetic field is shown to modify the
intrinsic Berry curvature properties of various emergent and/or exotic
quasiparticle excitations in distinct fashions for different quantum systems
and quantum phases, contributing to the thermal Hall transports. These include,
for example, the conventional ones like the magnons in ordered magnets, the
triplons in dimerized magnets, the exotic and fractionalized quasparticles such
as the spinons and the magnetic monopoles in quantum spin liquids. We review
their contribution and discuss their presence in the thermal Hall conductivity
in different physical contexts. We expect this review to provide a useful
guidance for the physical mechanism of the thermal Hall transports in quantum
magnets.

<br>
<br>
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful tool for
electrochemical analysis; however, its data can be challenging to interpret.
Here, we introduce a new open-source tool named AutoEIS that assists EIS
analysis by automatically proposing statistically plausible equivalent circuit
models (ECMs). AutoEIS does this without requiring an exhaustive mechanistic
understanding of the electrochemical systems. We demonstrate the
generalizability of AutoEIS by using it to analyze EIS datasets from three
distinct electrochemical systems, including thin-film oxygen evolution reaction
(OER) electrocatalysis, corrosion of self-healing multi-principal components
alloys, and a carbon dioxide reduction electrolyzer device. In each case,
AutoEIS identified competitive or in some cases superior ECMs to those
recommended by experts and provided statistical indicators of the preferred
solution. The results demonstrated AutoEIS's capability to facilitate EIS
analysis without expert labels while diminishing user bias in a high-throughput
manner. AutoEIS provides a generalized automated approach to facilitate EIS
analysis spanning a broad suite of electrochemical applications with minimal
prior knowledge of the system required. This tool holds great potential in
improving the efficiency, accuracy, and ease of EIS analysis and thus creates
an avenue to the widespread use of EIS in accelerating the development of new
electrochemical materials and devices.

The Hubbard model provides an idealized description of electronic
correlations in solids. Despite its simplicity, the model features a
competition between several different phases that have made it one of the most
studied systems in theoretical physics. Real materials usually deviate from the
ideal of the Hubbard model in several ways, but the monolayer of Nb$_3$Cl$_8$
has recently appeared as a potentially optimal candidate for the realization of
such a single-orbital Hubbard model. Here we show how this single orbital
Hubbard model can be indeed constructed within a "molecular" rather than atomic
basis set using ab initio constrained random phase approximation calculations.
This way, we provide the essential ingredients to connect experimental reality
with ab initio material descriptions and correlated electron theory, which
clarifies that monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ is a Mott insulator with a gap of about 1
to 1.2eV depending on its dielectric environment. By comparing with an
atomistic three-orbital model, we show that the single molecular orbital
description is indeed adequate. We furthermore comment on the expected
electronic and magnetic structure of the compound and show that the Mott
insulating state survives in the low-temperature and bulk phases of the
material.

We study superconductivity in the superionic phase of the clathrate hydride
Li$_2$MgH$_{16}$, where hydrogen ions diffuse among the lattice formed by
lithium and magnesium ions. By employing the stochastic path-integral approach,
we non-perturbatively take into account the effects of quantum diffusion and
anharmonic vibrations. Our calculations reveal strong electron-ion coupling
($\lambda(0)$ = 3.48) and a high superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$)
of 286 K under 260 GPa, at which the material is still superionic. $T_c$ is
significantly suppressed compared with the result $T_c$ = 473 K obtained from
the conventional approach based on the harmonic approximation. Our study, based
on a first-principles approach applicable to superionic systems, indicates that
the superconductivity and superionicity can coexist in Li$_2$MgH$_{16}$.

<br>
<br>
Bilayer graphene exhibits a rich phase diagram in the quantum Hall regime,
arising from a multitude of internal degrees of freedom, including spin,
valley, and orbital indices. The variety of fractional quantum Hall states
between filling factors $1 < \nu \leq 2$ suggests, among other things, a
quantum phase transition between valley-unpolarized and polarized states at a
perpendicular electric field $D^{*}$. We find the behavior of $D^{*}$ with
$\nu$ changes markedly as $B$ is reduced. At $\nu = 2$, $D^{*}$ may even vanish
when $B$ is sufficiently small. We present a theoretical model for
lattice-scale interactions which explains these observations; surprisingly,
both repulsive and attractive components in the interactions are required.
Within this model we analyze the nature of the $\nu = 2$ state as a function of
the magnetic and electric fields, and predict that valley-coherence may emerge
for $D \sim D^{*}$ in the high $B$ regime. This suggests the system supports
Kekule bond-ordering, which could in principle be verified via STM
measurements.

Via the hierarchy of correlations, we study doublon-holon pair creation in
the Mott state of the Fermi-Hubbard model induced by a time-dependent electric
field. Special emphasis is placed on the analogy to electron-positron pair
creation from the vacuum in quantum electrodynamics (QED). We find that the
accuracy of this analogy depends on the spin structure of the Mott background.
For Ising type anti-ferromagnetic order, we derive an effective Dirac equation.
A Mott state without any spin order, on the other hand, does not explicitly
display such a quasi-relativistic behavior.

<br>
<br>
Through extensive molecular simulations we determine a phase diagram of
attractive, flexible polymer chains in two and three dimensions. A surprisingly
rich collection of distinct crystal morphologies appear, which can be finely
tuned through the range of attraction. In three dimensions these include the
face centered cubic, hexagonal close packed, simple hexagonal and body centered
cubic crystals and the Frank-Kasper phase. A simple geometric model is
proposed, based on the concept of cumulative neighbours of ideal crystals,
which can accurately predict most of the observed structures and the
corresponding transitions. The attraction range can thus be considered as an
adjustable parameter for the design of colloidal polymer crystals with tailored
morphologies.

<br>
<br>
The notion of quasi-particles is essential for understanding the behaviour of
complex many-body systems. A prototypical example of a quasi-particle, a
polaron, is an impurity strongly interacting with a surrounding medium. Fermi
polarons, created in a Fermi sea, provide a paradigmatic realization of this
concept. As an inherent and important property such quasi-particles interact
with each other via modulation of the medium. While quantum simulation
experiments with ultracold atoms have significantly improved our understanding
of individual polarons, the detection of their interactions has remained
elusive in these systems. Here, we report the unambiguous observation of
mediated interactions between Fermi polarons consisting of K impurities
embedded in a Fermi sea of Li atoms. Our results confirm two landmark
predictions of Landau's Fermi-liquid theory: the shift of the polaron energy
due to mediated interactions, linear in the concentration of impurities, and
its sign inversion with impurity quantum statistics. For weak to moderate
interactions between the impurities and the medium, we find excellent agreement
with the static (zero-momentum and energy) predictions of Fermi-liquid theory.
For stronger impurity-medium interactions, we show that the observed behaviour
at negative energies can be explained by a more refined many-body treatment
including retardation and molecule formation

<br>
<br>
The identification of microscopic models describing the low-energy properties
of correlated materials has been a central goal of spectroscopic measurements.
We demonstrate how 2D non-linear spectroscopy can be used to distinguish
effective spin models whose linear responses show similar behavior. Motivated
by recent experiments on the quasi-1D Ising magnet CoNb$_2$O$_6$, we focus on
two proposed models, the ferromagnetic twisted Kitaev chain with bond dependent
interactions and the transverse field Ising model. The dynamical spin structure
factor probed in linear response displays similar broad spectra for both models
from their fermionic domain wall excitations. In sharp contrast, the 2D
non-linear spectra of the two models show clear qualitative differences: those
of the twisted Kitaev model contain off-diagonal peaks originating from the
bond dependent interactions and transitions between different fermion bands
absent in the transverse field Ising model. We discuss the different signatures
of spin fractionalization in integrable and non-integrable regimes of the
models and their connection to experiments.
