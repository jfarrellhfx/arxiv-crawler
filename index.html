<h3>Power-law intermittency in the gradient-induced self-propulsion of  colloidal swimmers</h3>

Active colloidal microswimmers serve as archetypical active fluid systems,
and as models for biological swimmers. Here, by studying in detail their
velocity traces, we find robust power-law intermittency with system-dependent
exponential cut off. We model the motion by an interplay of the field
gradient-dependent active force and the locally fluctuating hydrodynamic drag,
set by the wetting properties of the substrate. The model closely describes the
velocity distributions of two disparate swimmer systems: AC field activated and
catalytic swimmers. The generality is highlighted by the collapse of all data
in a single master curve, suggesting the applicability to further systems, both
synthetic and biological.

<h3>Topological holography, quantum criticality, and boundary states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16878" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16878</a>

Topological holography is a holographic principle that describes the
generalized global symmetry of a local quantum system in terms of a topological
order in one higher dimension. This framework separates the topological data
from the local dynamics of a theory and provides a unified description of the
symmetry and duality in gapped and gapless phases of matter. In this work, we
develop the topological holographic picture for (1+1)d quantum phases,
including both gapped phases as well as a wide range of quantum critical
points, including phase transitions between symmetry protected topological
(SPT) phases, symmetry enriched quantum critical points, deconfined quantum
critical points and intrinsically gapless SPT phases. Topological holography
puts a strong constraint on the emergent symmetry and the anomaly for these
critical theories. We show how the partition functions of these critical points
can be obtained from dualizing (orbifolding) more familiar critical theories.
The topological responses of the defect operators are also discussed in this
framework. We further develop a topological holographic picture for conformal
boundary states of (1+1)d rational conformal field theories. This framework
provides a simple physical picture to understand conformal boundary states and
also uncovers the nature of the gapped phases corresponding to the boundary
states.

<h3>Spontaneous breaking of U(1) symmetry at zero temperature in one  dimension</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16881" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16881</a>

The Hohenberg--Mermin--Wagner theorem states that there is no spontaneous
breaking of continuous symmetries in spatial dimensions $d\leq2$ at finite
temperature. At zero temperature, the classical/quantum mapping further implies
the absence of continuous symmetry breaking in one dimension, which is also
known as Coleman's theorem in the context of relativistic quantum field
theories. Except for the classic example of the Heisenberg ferromagnet and its
variations, there has been no known counterexample to the theorem. In this
Letter, we discuss new examples that display spontaneous breaking of a U(1)
symmetry at zero temperature, although the order parameter does not commute
with the Hamiltonian unlike the Heisenberg ferromagnet. We argue that a more
general condition for this behavior is that the Hamiltonian is
frustration-free.

Ultrathin bismuth exhibits rich physics including strong spin-orbit coupling,
ferroelectricity, nontrivial topology, and light-induced structural dynamics.
We use \textit{ab initio} calculations to show that light can induce structural
transitions to four transient phases in bismuth monolayers. These light-induced
phases exhibit nontrivial topological character, which we illustrate using the
recently introduced concept of spin bands and spin-resolved Wilson loops.
Specifically, we find that the topology changes via the closing of the electron
and spin band gaps during photo-induced structural phase transitions, leading
to distinct edge states. Our study provides strategies to tailor electronic and
spin topology via ultrafast control of photo-excited carriers and associated
structural dynamics.

Conventional antiferromagnetic materials have long been recognized for their
time-reversal symmetry, resulting in a zero anomalous Hall coefficient.
However, a paradigm shift occurs when examining easy-axis antiferromagnets and
their spin-flop transition. This transition introduces a magnetic canted
moment, leading to the emergence of a non-zero anomalous Hall signal and the
generation of a non-dissipative transversal current. While high symmetry
systems typically manifest an isotropic Hall effect, our study unveils the
extraordinary behavior exhibited by hematite that becomes conductive due to
small Ti doping. We investigate the magnetotransport in Titanium-doped
hematite, uncovering a highly pronounced and unconventional symmetry. Notably,
this effect displays a remarkable dependence on the crystal orientation of the
material. We establish a compelling correlation between our experimental
observations and the predicted anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets through
symmetry analysis. This study expands our understanding of the Hall effect in
antiferromagnetic materials and sheds light on the intricate interplay between
crystal orientation and unconventional Hall phenomena.

<h3>Geodynamics in spacetime crystal under slow perturbation and deformation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16918" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16918</a>
<br>
<i>Anzhuoer Li, Liang Dong, Qian Niu</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a theory of geodynamics in a spacetime crystal based on an event
wavepacket constructed from the Floquet-Bloch waves, which not only involve a
scalar dispersion function but also a Berry curvature tensor in the phase space
manifold of spacetime and the reciprocal quasi energy-momentum. In the presence
of structural deformation, this theory is naturally extended into a covariant
form with the introduction of a lattice connection constructed out of the
gradients of the local lattice vectors. The geodesic equation for a free
particle involves not only the lattice connection but also higher-order
corrections from spacetime inhomogeneity of Berry curvatures and quasi
energy-momentum dispersion.

<h3>Anomalous diffusion of self-propelled particles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16926" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16926</a>
<br>
<i>Francisco J. Sevilla, Guillermo Chacón-Acosta, Trifce Sandev</i>
<br>
<br>
The transport equation of active motion is generalised to consider
time-fractional dynamics for describing the anomalous diffusion of
self-propelled particles observed in many different systems. In the present
study, we consider an arbitrary active motion pattern modelled by a scattering
function that defines the dynamics of the change of the self-propulsion
direction. The exact probability density of the particle positions at a given
time is obtained. From it, the time dependence of the moments, i.e., the mean
square displacement and the kurtosis for an arbitrary scattering function, are
derived and analysed. Anomalous diffusion is found with a crossover of the
scaling exponent from $2\alpha$ in the short-time regime to $\alpha$ in the
long-time one, $0<\alpha<1$ being the order of the fractional derivative
considered. It is shown that the exact solution found satisfies a fractional
diffusion equation that accounts for the non-local and retarded effects of the
Laplacian of the probability density function through a coupled temporal and
spatial memory function. Such a memory function holds the complete information
of the active motion pattern. In the long-time regime, space and time are
decoupled in the memory function, and the time fractional telegrapher's
equation is recovered. Our results are widely applicable in systems ranging
from biological microorganisms to artificially designed self-propelled
micrometer particles.

<h3>Direct numerical analysis of dynamic facilitation in glass-forming  liquids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16935" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16935</a>
<br>
<i>Cecilia Herrero, Ludovic Berthier</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a computational strategy to quantify the temperature evolution of
the timescales and lengthscales over which dynamic facilitation affects the
relaxation dynamics of glass-forming liquids at low temperatures, that requires
no assumption about the nature of the dynamics. In two glass models, we find
that dynamic facilitation depends strongly on temperature, leading to a
subdiffusive spreading of relaxation events which we characterize using a
temperature-dependent dynamic exponent. We also establish that this temperature
evolution represents a major contribution to the increase of the structural
relaxation time.

<h3>Bound on Thermalization from Diffusive Fluctuations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16948" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16948</a>
<br>
<i>Luca V. Delacretaz</i>
<br>
<br>
The local equilibration time of quantum many-body systems has been
conjectured to satisfy a "Planckian bound", $\tau_{\rm eq}\gtrsim
\frac{\hbar}{T}$. We provide a sharp and universal definition of this time
scale, and show that it is bounded below by the strong coupling scale of
diffusive fluctuations, which can be expressed in terms of familiar transport
parameters. When applied to conformal field theories at finite temperature,
this fluctuation bound implies the Planckian bound. The fluctuation bound
moreover applies to any local thermalizing system, and we study its implication
for correlated insulators, metals, as well as disordered fixed points, where it
can be used to establish a lower bound on the diffusivity in terms of the
specific heat $D\gtrsim 1/(c_V^{2/d}\tau_{\rm eq})$. Finally, we discuss how
the local equilibration time can be directly measured in experiments.

<h3>Inchworm quasi Monte Carlo for quantum impurities</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16957" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16957</a>
<br>
<i>Hugo U. R. Strand, Joseph Kleinhenz, Igor Krivenko</i>
<br>
<br>
The inchworm expansion is a promising approach to solving strongly correlated
quantum impurity models due to its reduction of the sign problem in real and
imaginary time. However, inchworm Monte Carlo is computationally expensive,
converging as $1/\sqrt{N}$ where $N$ is the number of samples. We show that the
imaginary time integration is amenable to quasi Monte Carlo, with enhanced
$1/N$ convergence, by mapping the Sobol low-discrepancy sequence from the
hypercube to the simplex with the so-called Root transform. This extends the
applicability of the inchworm method to, e.g., multi-orbital Anderson impurity
models with off-diagonal hybridization, relevant for materials simulation,
where continuous time hybridization expansion Monte Carlo has a severe sign
problem.

<h3>Understanding the large shift photocurrent of WS$_{2}$ nanotubes: A  comparative analysis with monolayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16977" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16977</a>
<br>
<i>Jyoti Krishna, Peio Garcia-Goiricelaya, Fernando de Juan, Julen Ibañez-Azpiroz</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the similarities and differences in the shift photocurrent
contribution to the bulk photovoltaic effect between transition-metal
dichalcogenide monolayers and nanotubes. Our analysis is based on density
functional theory in combination with the Wannier interpolation technique for
the calculation of the shift photoconductivity tensor. Our results show that
for nanotube radii of practical interest $r>60$~\AA, the shift
photoconductivity of a single-wall nanotube is well described by that of the
monolayer. Additionally, we quantify the shift photocurrent generated under
realistic experimental conditions like device geometry and absorption
capabilities. We show that a typical nanotube can generate a photocurrent of
around 10 nA, while the monolayer only attains a maximum of 1 nA. This
enhancement is mainly due to the larger conducting cross section of a nanotube
in comparison to a monolayer. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of
recent experimental measurements on WS$_{2}$ monolayer and nanotubes[Zhang et
al., Nature 570, 349 (2019)].

<h3>Ultrasound-propelled nano- and microspinners</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17018" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17018</a>
<br>
<i>Johannes Voß, Raphael Wittkowski</i>
<br>
<br>
We study nonhelical nano- and microparticles that, through a particular
shape, rotate when they are exposed to ultrasound. Employing acoustofluidic
computer simulations, we investigate the flow field that is generated around
these particles in the presence of a planar traveling ultrasound wave as well
as the resulting propulsion force and torque of the particles. We study how the
flow field and the propulsion force and torque depend on the particles'
orientation relative to the propagation direction of the ultrasound wave.
Furthermore, we show that the orientation-averaged propulsion force vanishes
whereas the orientation-averaged propulsion torque is nonzero. Thus, we reveal
that these particles can constitute nano- and microspinners that persistently
rotate in isotropic ultrasound.

<h3>Phase Change Induced Magnetic Switching through Metal-insulator  Transition in VO2/TbFeCo Films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17045" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17045</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The ability to manipulate spins in magnetic materials is essential in
designing spintronics devices. One method for magnetic switching is through
strain. In VO2 on TiO2 thin films, while VO2 remains rutile across the
metal-insulator transition, the in-plane lattice area expands going from low
temperature insulating phase to high temperature conducting phase. In a
VO2/TbFeCo bilayer, the expansion of the VO2 lattice area exerts tension on the
amorphous TbFeCo layer. Through the strain effect, magnetic properties,
including the magnetic anisotropy and magnetization, of TbFeCo can be changed.
In this work, the changes in magnetic properties of TbFeCo on VO2/TiO2(011) are
demonstrated using anomalous Hall effect measurements. Across the
metal-insulator transition, TbFeCo loses perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and
the magnetization in TbFeCo turns from out-of-plane to in-plane. Using
atomistic simulations, we confirm these tunable magnetic properties originating
from the metal-insulator transition of VO2. This study provides the groundwork
for controlling magnetic properties through a phase transition.

<h3>Quantum criticality at cryogenic melting of polar bubble lattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17073" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17073</a>
<br>
<i>W. Luo, A. Akbarzadeh, Y. Nahas, S. Prokhorenko, L. Bellaiche</i>
<br>
<br>
Quantum fluctuations (QFs) caused by zero-point phonon vibrations (ZPPVs) are
known to prevent the occurrence of polar phases in bulk incipient
ferroelectrics down to 0K1-3. On the other hand, little is known about the
effects of QFs on the recently discovered topological patterns in ferroelectric
nanostructures4-9. Here, by using an atomistic effective Hamiltonian within
classical Monte Carlo (CMC) and path integral quantum Monte Carlo
(PI-QMC)1,3,10,11, we unveil how QFs affect the topology of several dipolar
phases in ultrathin Pb(Zr0.4Ti0.6)O3 (PZT) films. In particular, our PI-QMC
simulations show that the ZPPVs do not suppress polar patterns but rather
stabilize the labyrinth4, bimeron5 and bubble phases12,13 within a wider range
of bias field magnitudes. Moreover, we reveal that quantum fluctuations induce
a quantum critical point (QCP) separating a hexagonal bubble lattice from a
liquid-like state characterized by spontaneous motion, creation and
annihilation of polar bubbles at cryogenic temperatures. Finally, we show that
the discovered quantum melting is associated with anomalous physical response,
as, e.g., demonstrated by a negative longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient.

<h3>Vison crystal in quantum spin ice on the breathing pyrochlore lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17076" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17076</a>
<br>
<i>Alaric Sanders, Claudio Castelnovo</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent excitement in the quantum spin ice community has come from the
experimental discovery of pseudospin-$1/2$ breathing pyrochlores, including
Ba$_3$Yb$_2$Zn$_5$O$_{11}$, in which inversion symmetry is broken by the `up'
and `down' tetrahedra taking different physical sizes. We show here that the
often-neglected $J_{z\pm}$ coupling between Kramers ions, in combination with
the breathing nature of the lattice, can produce an imaginary ring flip term.
This can lead to an unconventional '$U(1)_{\pi/2}$ phase', corresponding to a
maximally dense packing of visons on the lattice. Coherent dynamics persists in
all phases, together with its emergent QED description, in a manner reminiscent
of fragmentation in spinon crystals. We characterize the enlarged QSI phase
diagram and its excitations, showing that the imaginary ring flip acts both as
a chemical potential for visons and as an effective three-photon vertex akin to
strong light-matter coupling. The novel coupling causes a structured
high-energy continuum to emerge above the photon dispersion, which is naturally
interpreted as three photon up-conversion in a nonlinear optical crystal.

<h3>Disorder induced topological phase transition in a driven Majorana chain</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study a periodically driven one dimensional Kitaev model in the presence
of disorder. In the clean limit our model exhibits four topological phases
corresponding to the existence or non-existence of edge modes at zero and pi
quasienergy. When disorder is added, the system parameters get renormalized and
the system may exhibit a topological phase transition. When starting from the
Majorana $\pi$ Mode (MPM) phase, which hosts only edge Majoranas with
quasienergy pi, disorder induces a transition into a neighboring phase with
both pi and zero modes on the edges. We characterize the disordered system
using (i) exact diagonalization (ii) Arnoldi mapping onto an effective tight
binding chain and (iii) topological entanglement entropy.

<h3>Unusual phase transition in 1D localization and its observability in  optics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17108" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17108</a>
<br>
<i>S.I.Bozhevolnyi, I.M.Suslov</i>
<br>
<br>
Localization of electrons in 1D disordered systems is usually described in
the random phase approximation, when distributions of phases \varphi and
\theta, entering the transfer matrix, are considered as uniform. In the general
case, the random phase approximation is violated, and the evolution equations
are written in terms of the Landauer resistance \rho and the combined phases
\psi=\theta-\varphi and \chi=\theta+\varphi. The distribution of the phase \psi
is found to exhibit an unusual phase transition at the point E_0 when changing
the electron energy E, which manifests itself in the appearance of the
imaginary part of \psi. The distribution of resistance P(\rho) has no
singularity at the point E_0, and the transition seems unobservable in the
framework of condensed matter physics. However, the theory of 1D localization
is immediately applicable to the scattering of waves propagating in a
single-mode optical waveguide. Modern optical methods open a way to measure
phases \psi and \chi. As a result, the indicated phase transition becomes
observable.

<h3>Unveiling microstructural damage for leakage current degradation in SiC  Schottky diode after heavy ions irradiation under 200 V</h3>

<br>
<br>
Single-event burnout and single-event leakage current (SELC) in SiC power
devices induced by heavy ions severely limit their space application, and the
underlying mechanism is still unclear. One fundamental problem is lack of
high-resolution characterization of radiation damage in the irradiated SiC
power devices, which is a crucial indicator of the related mechanism. In this
letter, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to
characterize the radiation damage in the 1437.6 MeV 181Ta-irradiated SiC
junction barrier Schottky diode under 200 V. The amorphous radiation damage
with about 52 nm in diameter and 121 nm in length at the Schottky metal
(Ti)-semiconductor (SiC) interface was observed. More importantly, in the
damage site the atomic mixing of Ti, Si, and C was identified by electron
energy loss spectroscopy and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM. It
indicates that the melting of the Ti-SiC interface induced by localized Joule
heating is responsible for the amorphization and the formation of titanium
silicide, titanium carbide, or ternary phases. These modifications at nanoscale
in turn cause the localized degradation of the Schottky contact into Ohmic
contact, resulting in the permanent increase in leakage current. This
experimental study provides some valuable clues to thorough understanding of
the SELC mechanism in SiC diode.

Collective dynamics of many particle systems is tightly linked to their
underlying symmetry and phase transitions. Higgs and Nambu-Goldstone modes are,
respectively, collective amplitude and phase modes of the order parameter that
are widely observed in various physical systems at different energy scales,
ranging from magnets, superfluids, superconductors to our universe. The Higgs
mode is a massive excitation, which is a condensed-matter analog of Higgs
particle in high-energy physics, while the Nambu-Goldstone mode is a massless
excitation that appears when a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken.
They provide important information on the fundamental aspects of many particle
systems, such as symmetry, phases, dynamics, response to external fields, and
so on. In this article, we review the physics of Higgs and Nambu-Goldstone
modes in condensed matter physics. Especially, we focus on the development on
the study of collective modes in superconductors and cold-atom systems.

The interaction of water with surfaces is crucially important in a wide range
of natural and technological settings. In particular, at low temperatures,
unveiling the atomistic structure of adsorbed water clusters would provide
valuable data for understanding the ice nucleation process. Using
high-resolution Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Scanning Tunnelling
Microscopy, several studies have demonstrated the presence of water pentamers,
hexamers, heptamers (and of their combinations) on a variety of metallic
surfaces, as well the initial stages of 2D ice growth on an insulating surface.
However, in all these cases, the observed structures were completely flat,
providing a relatively straightforward path to interpretation. Here, we present
high-resolution AFM measurements of several new water clusters on Au(111) and
Cu(111), whose understanding presents significant challenges, due to both their
highly 3D configuration and to their large size. For each of them, we use a
combination of machine learning, atomistic modelling with neural network
potentials and statistical sampling to propose an underlying atomic structure,
finally comparing its AFM simulated images to the experimental ones. These
results provide new insights into the early phases of ice formation, which is a
ubiquitous phenomenon ranging from biology to astrophysics.

<h3>Local Coordination Modulates the Reflectivity of Liquefied Si-Ge Alloys</h3>

<br>
<br>
The properties of liquid Si-Ge binary systems at melting conditions deviate
from those expected by the ideal alloy approximation. Particularly, a
non-linear dependence of the dielectric functions occurs with the reflectivity
of liquid Si-Ge being 10\% higher at intermediate Ge content than in pure Si or
Ge. Using \textit{ab initio} methodologies, we revealed a direct correlation
between reflectivity and atomic coordination, discovering that Si-Ge's higher
local coordination drives the aforementioned optical behavior. These findings
extend the physical understanding of liquefied semiconductors and hold the
promise of further generalization.

<br>
<br>
We studied helicity resolved Raman scattering in PtSe$_2$ flakes with
different thicknesses. The peak amplitude of helicity-switched Raman scattering
is significantly larger than that of helicity-conserved scattering for the
in-plane $E_{g}$ mode, consistent with the Raman tensor analyses and
conservation law of angular momentum. The peak amplitude of the
helicity-switched $E_{g}$ mode is larger for the thinner flakes. In addition,
we find Raman peaks near the energy levels of infrared (IR)-active $E_u$ and
$A_{2u}$ modes, only for monolayer and a few-layers thick flakes.
Interestingly, these peaks manifest themselves only for helicity-switched Raman
scattering; they are nearly absent for helicity-conserved scattering.

<h3>On-chip all-electrical determination of the magnetoelastic coupling  constant of magnetic heterostructures</h3>

We have developed an approach to determine the magnetoelastic coupling
constant of magnetic layers in thin film heterostructures. The film is formed
on a piezoelectric substrate between two interdigital transducers (IDT), a
platform often used to construct a surface acoustic wave device. With the
substrate piezoelectricity, strain is induced into the film by applying a dc
voltage to the IDTs. The strain causes changes in the magnetization direction
of the magnetic layer, which is probed by measuring changes, if any, in the
transverse resistance of the heterostructure. We find the extracted
magnetoelastic coupling constant of the magnetic layer (CoFeB) depends on the
film stacking. Such change can be accounted for provided that the elastic
properties of the layers that constitute the heterostructures are taken into
account. The on-chip all-electrical approach described here provides a
versatile means to quantitatively assess the magnetoelastic coupling constant
of thin film heterostructures.

(CVD) is reported. Towards this end, a two-step procedure was developed,
involving the 4H-SiC substrate boridation under BCl 3 precursor at
1200{\textdegree}C, followed by conventional CVD under BCl 3 + C 3 H 8 at
1600{\textdegree}C. Such a procedure allowed obtaining reproducibly
monocrystalline (0001) oriented films of B x C with a step flow morphology at a
growth rate of 1.9 $\mu$m/h. Without the boridation step, the layers are
systematically polycrystalline. The study of the epitaxial growth mechanism
shows that a monocrystalline B x C layer is formed after boridation but covered
with a B-and Si-containing amorphous layer. Upon heating up to
1600{\textdegree}C, under pure H 2 atmosphere, the amorphous layer was
converted into epitaxial B x C and transient surface SiB x and Si crystallites.
These crystallites disappear upon CVD growth.

Using a combination of resistance fluctuation (noise) and dielectric
spectroscopy we investigate the nature of relaxor-type electronic
ferroelectricity in the organic conductor $\kappa$-(BETS)$_2$Mn[N(CN)$_2$]$_3$,
a system representative for a wider class of materials, where strong
correlations of electrons on a lattice of dimerized molecules results in an
insulating ground state. The two complementary spectroscopies reveal a distinct
low-frequency dynamics. By dielectric spectroscopy we detect an intrinsic
relaxation that is typical for relaxor ferroelectrics below the
metal-to-insulator transition at $T_{\rm{MI}}\sim 25\,$K. Resistance noise
spectroscopy reveals fluctuating two-level processes above $T_{\rm MI}$ which
strongly couple to the applied electric field, a signature of fluctuating polar
nanoregions (PNR), i.e. clusters of quantum electric dipoles fluctuating
collectively. The PNR preform above the metal insulator transition. Upon
cooling through $T_{\rm MI}$, a drastic increase of the low-frequency
$1/f$-type fluctuations and slowing down of the charge carrier dynamics is
accompanied by the onset of strong non-equilibrium dynamics indicating a glassy
transition of interacting dipolar clusters, the scaling properties of which are
consistent with a droplet model. The freezing of nano-scale polar clusters and
non-equilibrium dynamics is suggested to be a common feature of organic
relaxor-type electronic ferroelectrics and needs to be considered in
theoretical models describing these materials.

<h3>Topological phase transition in a narrow bandgap semiconductor nanolayer</h3>

Narrow bandgap semiconductor nanostructures have been explored for
realization of topological superconducting quantum devices in which Majorana
states can be created and employed for constructing topological qubits.
However, a prerequisite to achieve the topological phase transition in these
nanostructures is application of a magnetic field, which could complicate the
technology development towards topological quantum computing. Here we
demonstrate that a topological phase transition can be achieved in a narrow
bandgap semiconductor nanolayer under application of a perpendicular electric
field. Based on full band structure calculations, it is shown that the
topological phase transition occurs at an electric-field induced band inversion
and is accompanied by a sharp change of the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ invariant at the
critical field. We also demonstrate that the nontrivial topological phase is
manifested by the quantum spin Hall edge states in a band-inverted nanolayer
Hall-bar structure. We present the phase diagram of the nanolayer in the space
of layer thickness and electric field strength, and discuss the optimal
conditions to achieve a large topological bandgap in the electric-field induced
topological phase of a semiconductor nanolayer.

The search for evidence of Majorana states on the edges of topological
superconductors (TSCs) is challenging due to the difficulty of detecting such
charge-neutral electronic quasiparticles. Local microwave spectroscopy has been
shown to be a possible method to detect propagating Majorana modes, where a
spatially focused light beam must be used. Here, we show that helical Majorana
modes in TSCs allow inter-band transitions and thus contribute to optical
conductivity under a spatially uniform light. The existence of such a signal
requires the system to break certain symmetries so that the projection of the
charge current operator onto helical Majorana edge states leads to inter-band
hybridization terms. The general form of this contribution under a tunable
time-reversal breaking field is derived, which is valid in the sub-gap
low-frequency regime where the edge energy spectrum is linear, and numerical
results are obtained in three TSC models, showing remarkable consistency with
the analytical prediction. In comparison, the current operator for normal
helical edge states, such as in quantum spin Hall insulators, does not cause
inter-band transitions and the related optical conductivity vanishes unless the
time-reversal symmetry is broken. Our results may help guide feasible
experiments to provide evidence of Majorana edge modes in TSCs.

We consider a game where $N$ players bet on the outcome of a biased coin and
share the entry fees pot if successful. We assume that one player holds
information about past outcomes of the game, which they may either use
exclusively to improve their betting strategy or offer to sell to another
player. We determine analytically the optimal price curves for the data seller
and the prospective buyer. We find a sharp transition in the number $N$ of
players that separates a phase where the transaction is always profitable for
the seller from one where it may not be. In both phases, different regimes are
possible, depending on the "quality" of information being put up for sale: we
observe symbiotic regimes, where both parties collude effectively to rig the
game in their favor, competitive regimes, where the transaction is unappealing
to the data holder as it overly favors a competitor for scarce resources, and
even prey-predator regimes, where the data holder is eager to give away
bad-quality data to undercut a competitor. Our framework can be generalized to
more complex settings and constitutes a flexible tool to address the rich and
timely problem of pricing information in games of chance.

We study phase separation in the $t-t'-J$ model in which the constraint of no

van der Waals (vdW) layered materials exhibit fruitful novel physical
properties. The energy band of such materials depends strongly on their
structures and a tremendous variation in their physical properties can be
deduced from a tiny change in inter-layer spacing, twist angle, or in-plane
strain. In this work, a kind of vdW layered material of spiral antimonene is
constructed, and the strain effects in the material are studied. The spiral
antimonene is grown on a germanium (Ge) substrate and is induced by a helical
dislocation penetrating through few-atomic-layers of antimonene
(\b{eta}-phase). The as-grown spiral is intrinsically strained and the lattice
distortion is found to be pinned around the dislocation. Both spontaneous
inter-layer twist and in-plane anisotropic strain are observed in scanning
tunneling microscope (STM) measurements. The strain in the spiral antimonene
can be significantly modified by STM tip interaction, leading to a variation in
the surface electronic density of states (DOS) and a large modification in the
work function of up to a few hundreds of milli-electron-volts (meV). Those
strain effects are expected to have potential applications in building up novel
piezoelectric devices.

Altermagnetism represents an emergent collinear magnetic phase with
compensated order and an unconventional alternating even-parity wave spin order
in the non-relativistic band structure. We investigate directly this
unconventional band splitting near the Fermi energy through spinintegrated soft
X-ray angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The experimentally obtained
angle-dependent photoemission intensity, acquired from epitaxial thin films of
the predicted altermagnet CrSb, demonstrates robust agreement with the
corresponding band structure calculations. In particular, we observe the
distinctive splitting of an electronic band on a low-symmetry path in the
Brilliouin zone that connects two points featuring symmetry-induced degeneracy.
The measured large magnitude of the spin splitting of approximately 0.6 eV and
the position of the band just below the Fermi energy underscores the
signifcance of altermagnets for spintronics based on robust broken time
reversal symmetry responses arising from exchange energy scales, akin to
ferromagnets, while remaining insensitive to external magnetic fields and
possessing THz dynamics, akin to antiferromagnets.

<h3>The role of solvent interfacial structural ordering in maintaining  stable graphene dispersions</h3>

Liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) is the most promising method for the low-cost,
scalable production of two-dimensional nanosheets from their bulk counterparts.
Extensive exfoliation occurs in most solvents due to the huge amount of energy
introduced by sonication or shear mixing. However, the subsequent dispersion is
not always stable, with extensive reaggregation occurring in some solvents.
Identifying the optimal solvent for a particular layered material is difficult
and requires a fundamental understanding of the mechanism involved in
maintaining a stable dispersion. Here, we use molecular dynamics calculations
to show that when graphene is immersed in a solvent, distinct solvation layers
are formed irrespective of the choice of solvent and their formation is
energetically favourable for all considered solvents. However, energetic
considerations such as these do not explain the experimental solvent-dependence
of the dispersion concentration. Instead, we find that solvents with high
diffusion coefficients parallel to the graphene layer result in the lowest
experimental concentration of graphene in solution. This can be explained by
the enhanced ease of reaggregation in these solvents. Solvents with smaller
diffusion coefficients result in higher experimental graphene concentrations as
reaggregation is prevented. In the low diffusion limit, however, this
relationship breaks down. We suggest that here the concentration of graphene in
solution depends primarily on the separation efficiency of the initial
exfoliation step. Based on this, we predict that the concentration of
exfoliated graphene in solvents such as benzaldehyde and quinoline, which have
low diffusion constants, can be increased dramatically by careful tuning of the
experimental sonication parameters.

<h3>Surface transfer doping of hydrogen-terminated diamond probed by shallow  nitrogen-vacancy centers</h3>

The surface conductivity of hydrogen-terminated diamond is a topic of great
interest from both scientific and technological perspectives. This is primarily
due to the fact that the conductivity is exceptionally high without the need
for substitutional doping, thus enabling a wide range of electronic
applications. Although the conductivity is commonly explained by the surface
transfer doping due to air-borne surface acceptors, there remains uncertainty
regarding the main determining factors that govern the degree of band bending
and hole density, which are crucial for the design of electronic devices. Here,
we elucidate the dominant factor influencing band bending by creating shallow
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers beneath the hydrogen-terminated diamond surface
through nitrogen ion implantation at varying fluences. We measured the
photoluminescence and optically detected magnetic resonance of the NV centers
as well as the surface conductivity as a function of the implantation fluence.
Our findings indicate that band bending is not exclusively determined by the
work-function difference between diamond and the surface acceptor material, but
by the finite density of surface acceptors. Furthermore, this study also
suggests the presence of spatial inhomogeneities in the surface conductivity
and the charge state of the NV centers when the implantation fluence is close
to the density of negatively charged surface acceptors. This work emphasizes
the importance of distinguishing work-function-difference-limited band bending
and surface-acceptor-density-limited band bending when modeling the surface
transfer doping and provides useful insights for the development of devices
based on hydrogen-terminated diamond.

We study the crossed Andreev reflection and the nonlocal transport in the
proximitized graphene/supercondcutor/proximitized graphene junctions with the
pseudospin staggered potential and the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. The
crossed Andreev reflection with the local Andreev reflection and the elastic
cotunneling being completely eliminated can be realized for the electrons with
the specific spin-valley index when the intrinsic spin-orbit couplings in the
left graphene and the right graphene possess the opposite sign. The perfect
crossed Andreev reflection with its probability equal to $100\%$ can be
obtained in the space consisting of the incident angle and the energy of the
electrons. The crossed conductance and its oscillation with the superconductor
length are also investigated. The energy ranges for the crossed Andreev
reflection without the local Andreev reflection and the elastic cotunneling are
clarified for the different magnitudes of the pseudospin potential and the
spin-orbit coupling. The spin-valley index of the electrons responsible for the
perfect crossed Andreev reflection can be switched by changing the sign of the
intrinsic spin-orbit coupling or exchanging the biases applied on the left
graphene and the right graphene. Our results are helpful for designing the
flexible and high-efficiency Cooper pair splitter based on the spin-valley
degree of freedom.

<h3>Mott transition and pseudogap of the square-lattice Hubbard model:  results from center-focused cellular dynamical mean-field theory</h3>

<br>
<br>
The recently proposed center-focused post-processing procedure [Phys. Rev.
Research 2, 033476 (2020)] of cellular dynamical mean-field theory suggests
that central sites of large impurity clusters are closer to the exact solution
of the Hubbard model than the edge sites. In this paper, we systematically
investigate results in the spirit of this center-focused scheme for several
cluster sizes up to $8\times 8$ in and out of particle-hole symmetry. First we
analyze the metal-insulator crossovers and transitions of the half-filled
Hubbard model on a simple square lattice. We find that the critical interaction
of the crossover is reduced with increasing cluster sizes and the critical
temperature abruptly drops for the $4\times 4$ cluster. Second, for this
cluster size, we apply the center-focused scheme to a system with more
realistic tight-binding parameters, investigating its pseudogap regime as a
function of temperature and doping, where we find doping dependent
metal-insulator crossovers, Lifshitz transitions and a strongly renormalized
Fermi-liquid regime. Additionally to diagnosing the real space origin of the
suppressed antinodal spectral weight in the pseudogap regime, we can infer
hints towards underlying charge ordering tendencies.

The covariant form of the multivariable diffusion-drift process is described
by the covariant Fokker--Planck equation using the standard toolbox of Riemann
geometry. The covariant form of the equivalent Langevin stochastic equation is
long sought after. We start from the simplest covariant Stratonovich stochastic
differential equation depending on the local orthogonal frame (cf. vielbein).
We show that this stochastic differential equation (Graham, 1977) becomes the
desired covariant Langevin equation but only if we impose an additional
covariant constraint: the vectors of the frame must be divergence-free.

Latest since the landmark studies of Kovacs and co-workers on the glass
transition of polymers, it is clear that thermally induced volume changes are
of central importance for the understanding of the nature of the glass
transition. Due to the kinetic background of the canonical (thermal) glass
transition, it does not seem possible to derive a well-defined glass transition
temperature T_g based on susceptibilities such as the thermal volume expansion
coefficient, \beta(T), being strongly coupled to the glass transition process.
Therefore, in practice, T_g is for example defined via the inflection point of
the step-like \beta(T) curve. In this publication, we propose to use a
thermo-optical feature, preceding the glass transition in the high-temperature
phase, to determine the glass transition temperature T_g of a model polymer in
a rather narrow temperature interval.

The direct bandgap found in hexagonal germanium and some of its alloys with
silicon allows for an optically active material within the group-IV
semiconductor family with various potential technological applications.
However, there remain some unanswered questions regarding several aspects of
the band structiure, including the strength of the electric dipole transitions
at the center of the Brillouin zone. Using the $\mathbf{k\cdot p}$ method near
the $\Gamma$ point, including 10 bands, and taking spin-orbit coupling into
account, we obtain a self-consistent model that produces the correct band
curvatures, with previously unknown inverse effective mass parameters, to
describe 2H-Ge via fitting to {\it ab initio} data and to calculate effective
masses for electrons and holes. To understand the weak dipole coupling between
the lowest conduction band and the top valance band, we start from a spinless
12-band model and show that when adding spin-orbit coupling, the lowest
conduction band hybridizes with a higher-lying conduction band, which cannot be
explained by the spinful 10-band model. With the help of L\"owdin's
partitioning, we derive the effective low-energy Hamiltonian for the conduction
bands for the possible spin dynamics and nanostructure studies and in a similar
manner, we give the best fit parameters for the valance-band-only model that
can be used in the transport studies. Finally, using the self-consistent
10-band model, we include the effects of a magnetic field and predict the
electron and hole g-factor of the conduction and valance bands.

We study Berry connection polarizability (BCP) induced electric polarization
and third-order Hall (TOH) effect in a two-dimensional electron/hole gas
(2DEG/2DHG) with Rashba-Dresselhaus (RD) spin-orbit couplings in III-V
semiconductor heterostructures. The electric polarization decreases with the
increase of the Fermi energy and is responsive to the electric field
orientation in the presence of RD spin-orbit couplings for both systems. We
determine the BCP-induced TOH conductivity ($\chi_{\perp}^{\text{I}}$) along
with the TOH conductivity associated with the band velocity
($\chi_{\perp}^{\text{II}}$). We find that the presence of an infinitesimal
amount of Dresselhaus coupling in addition to the dominant Rashba coupling
results in finite TOH responses. These conductivities vanish when the field is
aligned with and/or orthogonal to the symmetry lines $k_x\pm k_y=0$ in both
systems. For typical system parameters in a 2DEG with $k$-linear RD
interactions, the magnitude of $\chi_{\perp}^{\text{I}}$ is smaller than that
of $\chi_{\perp}^{\text{II}}$. On the other hand, when both the SO couplings
are comparable, $\chi_{\perp}^{\text{I}}$ shows a notable increase in
magnitude, owing to the distinctive characteristics of BCP. The TOH
conductivity of 2DEG remains unchanged when Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit
couplings are exchanged. For 2DHG with $k$-cubic RD interactions,
$\chi_{\perp}^{\text{I},h}$ exhibits a larger magnitude compared to
$\chi_{\perp}^{\text{II},h}$. Unlike the electron case, the BCP induced
$\chi_{\perp}^{\text{I},h}$ alters under the exchange of spin-orbit coupling
parameters, whereas $\chi_{\perp}^{\text{II},h}$ remains the same.

<br>
<br>
In this paper, we examine the magnetoelectric response of Ising pyrochlores,
focusing on both the ordered antiferromagnetic state and the frustrated
ferromagnetic case known as "spin-ice". We employ a model which accounts for
magnetoelastic effects by considering the interplay between oxygen distortions
and superexchange magnetic interactions within pyrochlores. This, together with
numerical simulations, provides a tool to make quantitative comparisons with
experiments. Our main target is then to see how to extract relevant information
from this simple model, and to explore its limitations. We obtain a direct
estimation of quantities such as the electric dipole moment, the central oxygen
displacement and the effective magnetoelastic energy for the canonical spin-ice
material \DTO. We also inquire about the possibility of using the electric
dipole carried by magnetic monopoles to obtain a direct measure of their
density. In each studied scenario the correlations between monopoles, induced
by their number or by the magnetic background,renders these findings less
straightforward than initially anticipated. Furthermore, the coupling between
electrical and magnetic degrees of freedom provides additional tools to
investigate magnetic order in these systems. As an example of this we discuss
the phase diagram of the antiferromagnetic pyrochlore under applied magnetic
field along the [111] direction. We find an instance where the phase stability
at nonzero temperatures is not dictated by the energy associated with different
ground states but (akin to the phenomenon of order-by-disorder) is instead
determined by their accessibility to thermal fluctuations.

<h3>Theory of Hyperuniformity at the Absorbing State Transition</h3>

<br>
<br>
Hyperuniformity, whereby the static structure factor (or density correlator)
obeys $S(q)\sim q^{\varsigma}$ with $\varsigma> 0$, emerges at criticality in
systems having multiple absorbing states, such as periodically sheared
suspensions. These lie in the conserved directed percolation (C-DP)
universality class, for which analytic results for $\varsigma$ are lacking.
Specifically, $\varsigma$ appears inaccessible within an exact `interfacial
mapping' that yields other C-DP exponents via functional renormalization group
(FRG). Here, using Doi-Peliti field theory for interacting particles and
perturbative RG about a Gaussian model, we find $\varsigma = 0^+$ and
$\varsigma= 2\epsilon/9 + O(\epsilon^2)$ in dimension $d>4$ and $d=4-\epsilon$
respectively. The latter disproves a previously conjectured scaling relation
for $\varsigma$. We show how hyperuniformity emerges from anticorrelation of
strongly fluctuating active and passive densities. Our calculations also yield
the remaining C-DP exponents without recourse to functional RG methods.

The valley splitting (VS) of a silicon quantum dot plays an important role
for the performance and scalability of silicon spin qubits. In this work we
investigate the VS of a SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructure as a function of the size
and location of the silicon quantum dot. We use the effective mass approach to
describe a realistic system, which takes into account concentration
fluctuations at the Si/SiGe interfaces and also the interface roughness. We
predict that the size of the quantum dot is an important parameter for the
enhancement of the VS and it can also induce a transition between the
disorder-dominated to deterministic-enhanced regimes. Analyzing how the VS
changes when we move the quantum dot in a specific direction, we obtain that
the size of the quantum dot can be used to reduce the variability of the VS,
which is relevant for charge/spin shuttling.

Modelling the electrical response of multi-level quantum systems at finite
frequency has been typically performed in the context of two incomplete
paradigms: (i) Input-output theory, which is valid at any frequency but
neglects dynamic losses, and (ii) semiclassical theory, which captures well
dynamic dissipation effects but is only accurate at low frequencies. Here, we
develop a unifying theory, valid for arbitrary frequencies, that captures the
non-unitary effects introduced by finite relaxation and dephasing. The theory
allows a multi-level system to be described by a universal small-signal
equivalent circuit model, a resonant RLC circuit, whose topology only depends
on the number of energy levels, which we apply here to the case of a charge
qubit in a double quantum dot. Our model will facilitate the design of hybrid
quantum-classical circuits and the simulation of qubit control and quantum
state readout.

Silicon Emitting Centers (SEC) constitute promising candidates for quantum
telecommunication technologies. Their operation depends on the fabrication of
light emitting defect centers such as the triinterstitial Si complex, the
W-Center. In this paper the formation of Si tri-interstitial clusters after Ga
ion beam bombardment on pure silicon substrates and a subsequent annealing
stage is investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This study
aims to understand the dynamic formation process of W centers after Ga
implantation and annealing in order to assist the focused ion beam and
annealing experimental systems. A new tri-interstitial cluster identification
method is proposed which considers the configuration of the clusters in the Si
lattice in order to identify the defects which will act as candidates for the W
center. This method successfully identifies W center defect candidates in an
ideal system. The number of tri-interstitial clusters increases and spread
deeper into the Si for higher energies and their probability of generation
increases until a limiting Ga dose. Furthermore, annealing can eliminate a lot
of the unwanted defects maintaining at the same time the number of the
tri-interstitial clusters, leading to isolated clusters with less distorted
local environment.

Moir\'{e} excitons (MXs) are electron-hole pairs localised by the periodic
(moir\'{e}) potential forming in two-dimensional heterostructures (HSs). MXs
can be exploited, $e.g.$, for creating nanoscale-ordered quantum emitters and
achieving or probing strongly correlated electronic phases at relatively high
temperatures. Here, we studied the exciton properties of a WSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ HS
from $T$=6 K to room temperature using time-resolved and continuous-wave
micro-photoluminescence, also under magnetic field. The exciton dynamics and
emission lineshape evolution with temperature show clear signatures that MXs
de-trap from the moir\'{e} potential and turn into free interlayer excitons
(IXs) at $T\gtrsim$120 K. The MX-to-IX transition is also apparent from the
exciton magnetic moment reversing its sign when the moir\'{e} potential is not
capable to localise excitons at elevated temperatures. Concomitantly, the
exciton formation and decay times reduce drastically. Thus, our findings
establish the conditions for a truly confined nature of the exciton states in a
moir\'{e} superlattice with increasing temperature.

This work discusses the rich phase diagram of non-trivial chiral spin
textures in confined ferromagnetic/heavy-metal (FM/HM) bilayer nanomagnets of
circular cross-section. These spin textures are realized as a minimum-energy
ground state during an external bias field sweep for a range of nanomagnet's
diameter (d). Our study, based on micromagnetic simulations, has revealed a
novel Hopfion-like state which can be stabilized for a wide range of diameters
and external magnetic fields. We explored the dynamical characteristics of this
novel Hopfion-like state under a transient magnetic field applied along the
plane's perpendicular direction. Simulation results have demonstrated the
excitation of nonreciprocal spin wave (SW) modes for this novel chiral state,
in contrast to other stabilized chiral states. These modes are characterized as
breathing and quantized radial modes, which also exhibit hybridization with
azimuthal modes. The resonant SW modes have been used to demonstrate the
switching from a Hopfion-like state to a skyrmion within a few nanoseconds of
SW excitation. Furthermore, we establish a correlation between the behavior of
excited SW modes as a function of external magnetic field strength and
underlying chiral spin texture states.

Bottom-up synthesis from molecular precursors is a powerful route for the
creation of novel synthetic carbon-based low-dimensional materials, such as
planar carbon lattices. The wealth of conceivable precursor molecules
introduces a significant number of degrees-of-freedom for the design of
materials with defined physical properties. In this context, a priori knowledge
of the electronic, vibrational and optical properties provided by modern ab
initio simulation methods can act as a valuable guide for the design of novel
synthetic carbon-based building blocks. Using density functional theory, we
performed simulations of the electronic properties of armchair-edged graphene
nanoribbons (AGNR) with a bisecting 4-8 ring defect line. We show that the
electronic structures of the defective nanoribbons of increasing width can be
classified into three distinct families of semiconductors, similar to the case
of pristine AGNR. In contrast to the latter, we find that every third
nanoribbon is a zero-gap semiconductor with Dirac-type crossing of linear bands
at the Fermi energy. By employing tight-binding models including interactions
up to third-nearest neighbors, we show that the family behavior, the formation
of direct and indirect band gaps and of linear band crossings in the defective
nanoribbons is rooted in the electronic properties of the individual nanoribbon
halves on either side of the defect lines, and can be effectively through
introduction of additional 'interhalf' coupling terms.

Unconventional superconductivity in bulk materials under ambient pressure is
extremely rare among the 3$d$ transition-metal compounds outside the layered
cuprates and iron-based family. It is predominantly linked to highly
anisotropic electronic properties and quasi-two-dimensional (2D) Fermi
surfaces. To date, the only known example of the Co-based exotic superconductor
was the hydrated layered cobaltate, Na$_{x}$CoO$_{2}\cdot$ yH$_{2}$O, and its
superconductivity is realized in the vicinity of a spin-1/2 Mott state.
However, the nature of the superconductivity in these materials is still an
active subject of debate, and therefore, finding new class of superconductors
will help unravel the mysteries of their unconventional superconductivity. Here
we report the discovery of unconventional superconductivity at $\sim$ 6.3 K in
our newly synthesized layered compound Na$_{6}$Co$_{3}$Se$_{6}$O$_{3}$, in
which the edge-shared CoSe$_{6}$ octahedra form [CoSe$_{2}$] layers with a
perfect triangular lattice of Co ions. It is the first 3$d$ transition-metal
oxychalcogenide superconductor with distinct structural and chemical
characteristics. Despite its relatively low $T_{c}$, material exhibits
extremely high superconducting upper critical fields, $\mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)$, which
far exceeds the Pauli paramagnetic limit by a factor of 3 - 4. First-principles
calculations show that Na$_{6}$Co$_{3}$Se$_{6}$O$_{3}$ is a rare example of
negative charge transfer superconductor. This new cobalt oxychalcogenide with a
geometrical frustration among Co spins, shows great potential as a highly
appealing candidate for the realization of high-$T_{c}$ and/or unconventional
superconductivity beyond the well-established Cu- and Fe-based superconductor
families, and opened a new field in physics and chemistry of low-dimensional
superconductors.

<h3>Critical role of interlayer dimer correlations in the superconductivity  of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h3>

The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with
$T_\mathrm{c} \simeq 80~\mathrm{K}$ under high pressure opens up a new route to
high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity. This material realizes a bilayer square
lattice model featuring a strong interlayer hybridization unlike many
unconventional superconductors. A key question in this regard concerns how
electronic correlations driven by the interlayer hybridization affect the
low-energy electronic structure and the concomitant superconductivity. Here, we
demonstrate using a cluster dynamical mean-field theory that the interlayer
electronic correlations (IECs) induce a Lifshitz transition resulting in a
change of Fermi surface topology. By solving an appropriate gap equation, we
further show that the dominant pairing instability (intraorbital
$s$-wave/interorbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave) is enhanced by the IECs. The
underlying mechanism is the quenching of a strong ferromagnetic channel,
resulting from the Lifshitz transition driven by the IECs. Our finding
establishes the role of IECs in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and potentially paves the way
to designing higher-\Tc nickelates.

<h3>Buckling mediated by mobile localized elastic excitations</h3>

Experiments reveal that structural transitions in thin sheets are mediated by
the passage of transient and stable mobile localized elastic excitations. These
``crumples'' or ``d-cones'' nucleate, propagate, interact, annihilate, and
escape. Much of the dynamics occurs on millisecond time scales. Nucleation
sites correspond to regions where generators of the ideal unstretched surface
converge. Additional stable intermediate states illustrate two forms of
quasistatic inter-crumple interaction through ridges or valleys. These
interactions create pairs from which extended patterns may be constructed in
larger specimens. The onset of localized transient deformation with increasing
sheet size is correlated with a characteristic stable crumple size, whose
measured scaling with thickness is consistent with prior theory and experiment
for localized elastic features in thin sheets. We offer a new theoretical
justification of this scaling.

Key requirements for quantum plasmonic nanocircuits are reliable
single-photon sources, high coupling efficiency to the plasmonic structures and
low propagation losses. Self-assembled epitaxially grown GaAs quantum dots are
close to ideal stable, bright and narrowband single-photon emitters. Likewise,
wet-chemically grown monocrystalline silver nanowires are among the best
plasmonic waveguides. However, large propagation losses of surface plasmons on
the high-index GaAs substrate prevent their direct combination. Here, we show
by experiment and simulation that the best overall performance of the quantum
plasmonic nanocircuit based on these building blocks is achieved in the
intermediate field regime with an additional spacer layer between the quantum
dot and the plasmonic waveguide. High-resolution cathodoluminescence
measurements allow a precise determination of the coupling distance and support
a simple analytical model to explain the overall performance. The coupling
efficiency is increased up to four times by standing wave interference near the
end of the waveguide.

The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a robust topological phenomenon
that features quantized Hall resistance at zero magnetic field. Here we report
the observation of the QAHE in a rhombohedral pentalayer graphene/monolayer WS2
heterostructure. Distinct from all existing QAHE systems, this system has
neither magnetic element nor moir\'e superlattice effect. The QAH states emerge
at charge neutrality and feature Chern numbers C = +-5 at temperatures up to
about 1.5 K. This large QAHE in our system arises from the synergy of the
electron correlation effect in intrinsic flat bands of pentalayer graphene, the
gate-tuning effect that breaks the layer/spin-degeneracy, and the
proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit-coupling (SOC) effect that further lifts the
valley-degeneracy. Our experiment demonstrates the great potential of
crystalline two-dimensional materials for intertwined electron correlation and
band topology physics, and points to engineering chiral Majorana edge states
towards topological quantum computation.

Achieving versatile routes to generate crystalline carbon-based
nanostructures has become a fervent pursuit in photocatalysis-related fields.
We demonstrate that the direct electrooxidation of ethanol, performed on Ni
foam, yields ultra-small and highly crystalline graphene-like structures named
carbon quantum dots (CQDs). We perform simulations of various sp2 and sp3
domains in order to understand the optical properties of CQDs by accounting
their contribution as absorbance/luminescent centers in the overall optical
response. Experiments and simulations reveal that absorbance bands for
as-synthesized CQDs are dominated by small sp2 domains comprised of r7
aromatic-rings. After 48 h synthesis, the dispersion transition from yellow to
red, exhibiting new and red shifted absorbance bands. Furthermore, fluorescence
emission is governed by medium-sized sp 2 domains (with aromatic ring counts
r12) and oxygen-containing groups. These oxygen-rich groups within the CQDs,
confirmed by FT-IR and XPS, are responsible for the fast photodegradation of
organic dyes, with B90% of methylene blue (MB) being degraded within the first
5 min of light exposure. Our work provides crucial insights about the
electrochemical synthesis and overall optical properties of carbon
nanostructures, while being effective and reliable toward the degradation of
contaminants in water.

Elucidating the interplay between nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom
that govern the complex dielectric behavior of materials under intense
photoexcitation is essential for tailoring optical properties on demand.
However, conventional transient reflectivity experiments have been unable to
differentiate between real and imaginary components of the dielectric response,
omitting crucial electron-lattice interactions. Utilizing thin film
interference we unambiguously determined the photoinduced change in complex
dielectric function in the Peierls semimetal bismuth and examined its
dependence on the excitation density and nuclear motion of the A$_{1g}$ phonon.
Our modeled transient reflectivity data reveals a progressive broadening and
redshift of Lorentz oscillators with increasing excitation density and
underscores the importance of both, electronic and nuclear coordinates in the
renormalization of interband transitions.

Chiral fluids - such as fluids under rotation or a magnetic field as well as
synthetic and biological active fluids - flow in a different way than ordinary
ones. Due to symmetries broken at the microscopic level, chiral fluids may have
asymmetric stress and viscosity tensors, for example giving rise to a
hydrostatic torque or non-dissipative (odd) and parity-violating viscosities.
In this article, we investigate the motion of rigid bodies in such an
anisotropic fluid in the incompressible Stokes regime through the mobility
matrix, which encodes the response of a solid body to forces and torques. We
demonstrate how the form of the mobility matrix, which is usually determined by
particle geometry, can be analogously controlled by the symmetries of the
fluid. By computing the mobility matrix for simple shapes in a
three-dimensional anisotropic chiral fluid, we predict counter-intuitive
phenomena such as motion perpendicular to applied forces and spinning under the
force of gravity.

Liquid-liquid phase separation is key to understanding aqueous two-phase
systems (ATPS) arising throughout cell biology, medical science, and the
pharmaceutical industry. Controlling the detailed morphology of
phase-separating compound droplets leads to new technologies for efficient
single-cell analysis, targeted drug delivery, and effective cell scaffolds for
wound healing. We present a computational model of liquid-liquid phase
separation relevant to recent laboratory experiments with gelatin-polyethylene
glycol mixtures. We include buoyancy and surface-tension-driven finite
viscosity fluid dynamics with thermally induced phase separation. We show that
the fluid dynamics greatly alters the evolution and equilibria of the phase
separation problem. Notably, buoyancy plays a critical role in driving the ATPS
to energy-minimizing crescent-shaped morphologies and shear flows can generate
a tenfold speedup in particle formation. Neglecting fluid dynamics produces
incorrect minimum-energy droplet shapes. The model allows for optimization of
current manufacturing procedures for structured microparticles and improves
understanding of ATPS evolution in confined and flowing settings important in
biology and biotechnology.

We examine run and tumble disks in two-dimensional systems where the
particles also have a Magnus component to their dynamics. For increased
activity, we find that the system forms a motility-induced phase-separated
(MIPS) state with chiral edge flow around the clusters, where the direction of
the current is correlated with the sign of the Magnus term. The stability of
the MIPS state is non-monotonic as a function of increasing Magnus term
amplitude, with the MIPS region first extending down to lower activities
followed by a break up of MIPS at large Magnus amplitudes into a gel-like
state. We examine the dynamics in the presence of quenched disorder and a
uniform drive, and find that the bulk flow exhibits a drive-dependent Hall
angle. This is a result of the side jump effect produced by scattering from the
pinning sites, and is similar to the behavior found for skyrmions in chiral
magnets with quenched disorder.

We introduce a novel geometrically frustrated classical Ising model, dubbed
the "spin vorticity model", whose ground state manifold is a novel classical
spin liquid, a "2-form Coulomb phase". We study the thermodynamics of this
model both analytically and numerically, exposing the presence of algebraically
decaying correlations and demonstrating an extensive ground state entropy, and
give a comprehensive account of its ground state properties and excitations.
Each classical ground state may be decomposed into collections of closed
2-dimensional membranes, supporting fractionalized string excitations attached
to the boundaries of open membranes. At finite temperature, the model can then
be described as a gas of closed strings in a background of fluctuating
membranes. We demonstrate that the emergent gauge structure of the
low-temperature phase is naturally captured in the formalism of 2-form
electrodynamics, which describes 1-dimensional charged strings coupled to a
rank-2 anti-symmetric gauge field. After establishing the classical spin
vorticity model, we consider perturbing it with quantum exchange interactions,
from which we derive an effective membrane exchange model of the quantum
dynamics of these membranes, which maps to a frustrated 2-form U(1) lattice
gauge theory. We show the existence of a fine-tuned Rokhsar-Kivelson point
where the quantum ground state is an equal weight superposition of all
classical ground state configurations. We further demonstrate how to quantize
the string excitations, by coupling a 1-form string field to the emergent
2-form U(1) gauge field, thus mapping a quantum spin model to a 2-form
gauge-Higgs model. We discuss the stability of the gapless deconfined phase of
this gauge theory and the possibility of realizing a novel class of phases of
quantum matter: 2-form U(1) quantum spin liquids.

We investigate the effects of electronic correlations on the
Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model using the real-space density matrix renormalization
group (DMRG) algorithm. We introduce a method to probe topological phase
transitions in systems with strong correlations using DMRG, substantiated by an
unsupervised machine learning methodology that analyzes the orbital structure
of the real-space edges. Including the full multi-orbital Hubbard interaction
term, we construct a phase diagram as a function of a gap parameter ($m$) and
the Hubbard interaction strength ($U$) via exact DMRG simulations on $N\times
4$ cylinders. Our analysis confirms that the topological phase persists in the
presence of interactions, consistent with previous studies, but it also reveals
an intriguing phase transition from a paramagnetic to an antiferromagnetic
topological insulator. The combination of the magnetic structure factor,
strength of magnetic moments, and the orbitally resolved density, provides
real-space information on both topology and magnetism in a strongly correlated
system.
