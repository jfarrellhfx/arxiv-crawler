<h3>Holographic models of non-Fermi liquid metals revisited: an effective  field theory approach</h3>

Accessing the physics of strongly coupled metals in a controlled way is a
challenging problem in theoretical condensed matter physics. In this paper, we
revisit the possibility of understanding strongly coupled metals through a
holographic duality with a weakly coupled gravitational theory in one higher
dimension (i.e.\ a suitable generalization of the "AdS/CFT duality". Previous
attempts at devising holographic models of strongly coupled metals have
suffered from severe drawbacks; for example, they do not even seem to be able
to describe a Fermi surface that satisfies Luttinger's theorem, which is ought
to be a core requirement in any physically reasonable model of a metal. Here,
we propose a radically different approach to constructing holographic models of
strongly coupled metals. The idea is that for applications, it should be
sufficient to construct a holographic dual of the effective field theory that
controls the infra-red physics of the metal. We invoke recent work that has
identified a precise criterion for such an effective field theory to be
"emergeable" from a continuum ultra-violet (UV) theory at nonzero charge
density (or its equivalent in lattice models, namely an incommensurate charge
filling). We show that imposing this criterion leads to a holographic model of
a strongly coupled metal with physically reasonable properties, including a
Fermi surface satisfying Luttinger's theorem. We discuss a possible physical
interpretation of our results.

<h3>Phenomenology of bond and flux orders in kagome metals</h3>

Despite much experimental and theoretical work, the nature of the charge
order in the kagome metals belonging to the family of materials AV$_3$Sb$_5$
(A=Cs,Rb,K) remains controversial. A crucial ingredient for the identification
of the ordering in these materials is their response to external perturbations,
such as strain or magnetic fields. To this end, we provide a comprehensive
symmetry classification of the possible charge orders in kagome materials with
a $2\times2$ increase of the unit cell. Motivated by the experimental reports
of time-reversal-symmetry breaking and rotational anisotropy, we consider the
interdependence of flux and bond orders. Deriving the relevant Landau free
energy for possible orders, we study the effect of symmetry-breaking
perturbations such as strain and magnetic fields. Our results, thus, provide a
roadmap for future tests of these intricate orders.

<h3>Majorana chain and Ising model -- (non-invertible) translations,  anomalies, and emanant symmetries</h3>

We study the symmetries of closed Majorana chains in 1+1d, including the
translation, fermion parity, spatial parity, and time-reversal symmetries. The
algebra of the symmetry operators is realized projectively on the Hilbert
space, signaling anomalies on the lattice, and constraining the long-distance
behavior. In the special case of the free Hamiltonian (and small deformations
thereof), the continuum limit is the 1+1d free Majorana CFT. Its continuum
chiral fermion parity $(-1)^{F_\text{L}}$ emanates from the lattice translation
symmetry. We find a lattice precursor of its mod 8 't Hooft anomaly. Using a
Jordan-Wigner transformation, we sum over the spin structures of the lattice
model (a procedure known as the GSO projection), while carefully tracking the
global symmetries. In the resulting bosonic model of Ising spins, the Majorana
translation operator leads to a non-invertible lattice translation symmetry at
the critical point. The non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality operator of the
continuum Ising CFT emanates from this non-invertible lattice translation of
the transverse-field Ising model.

We present, in this dissertation, a pedagogical review of the formalism for
Fermi liquids developed in [Delacretaz et al., arXiv:220305004] that exploits
an underlying algebro-geometric structure described by the group of canonical
transformations of a single particle phase space. This infinite-dimensional
group governs the space of states of zero temperature Fermi liquids and thereby
allows us to write down a nonlinear, bosonized action that reproduces Landau's
kinetic theory in the classical limit. Upon quantizing, we obtain a systematic
effective field theory as an expansion in nonlinear and higher derivative
corrections suppressed by the Fermi momentum $p_F$, without the need to
introduce artificial momentum scales through, e.g., decomposition of the Fermi
surface into patches. We find that Fermi liquid theory can essentially be
thought of as a non-trivial representation of the Lie group of canonical
transformations, bringing it within the fold of effective theories in many-body
physics whose structure is determined by symmetries. We survey the benefits and
limitations of this geometric formalism in the context of scaling, diagrammatic
calculations, scattering and interactions, coupling to background gauge fields,
etc. After setting up a path to extending this formalism to include
superconducting and magnetic phases, as well as applications to the problem of
non-Fermi liquids, we conclude with a discussion on possible future directions
for Fermi surface physics, and more broadly, the usefulness of diffeomorphism
groups in condensed matter physics. Unlike [Delacretaz et al.,
arXiv:220305004], we present a microscopic perspective on this formalism,
motivated by the closure of the algebra of bilocal fermion bilinears and the
consequences of this fact for finite density states of interacting fermions.

<h3>Deconfined quantum criticality lost</h3>

Over the past two decades, the enigma of the deconfined quantum critical
point (DQCP) attracted broad attention across condensed matter and quantum
materials to quantum field theory and high-energy physics communities, as it is
expected to offer a new paradigm in theory, experiment, and numerical
simulations that goes beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson framework of symmetry
breaking and phase transitions. However, the lattice realizations of DQCP have
been controversial. For instance, in the square-lattice spin-1/2 $J$-$Q$ model,
believed to realize the DQCP between N\'eel and valence bond solid states,
conflicting results, such as first-order versus continuous transition, and
drifting critical exponents incompatible with conformal bootstrap bounds, have
been reported. Here, we solve this two-decades-long mystery by taking a new
viewpoint, in that we systematically study the entanglement entropy of
square-lattice SU($N$) DQCP spin models, from $N=2,3,4$ within the $J$-$Q$
model to $N=5,6,\dots,12,15,20$ within the $J_1$-$J_2$ model. We unambiguously
show that for $N \le 6$, the previously determined DQCPs do not belong to
unitary conformal fixed points. In contrast, when $N\ge N_c$ with a finite $N_c
\ge 7$, the DQCPs correspond to unitary conformal fixed points that can be
understood within the Abelian Higgs field theory with $N$ complex components.
From the viewpoint of quantum entanglement, our results suggest the realization
of a genuine DQCP between N\'eel and valence bond solid phases at finite $N$,
and yet explain why the SU(2) case is ultimately weakly-first-order, as a
consequence of a collision and annihilation of the stable critical fixed point
of the $N$-component Abelian Higgs field theory with another, bicritical, fixed
point, in agreement with four-loop renormalization group calculations. The
experimental relevance of our findings is discussed.

Ultracold atomic gases can undergo phase transitions that mimic relativistic
vacuum decay, allowing us to empirically test early-Universe physics in
tabletop experiments. We investigate the physics of these analogue systems,
going beyond previous analyses of the classical equations of motion to study
quantum fluctuations in the cold-atom false vacuum. We show that the
fluctuation spectrum of this vacuum state agrees with the usual relativistic
result in the regime where the classical analogy holds, providing further
evidence for the suitability of these systems for studying vacuum decay. Using
a suite of semiclassical lattice simulations, we simulate bubble nucleation
from this analogue vacuum state in a 1D homonuclear potassium-41 mixture,
finding qualitative agreement with instanton predictions. We identify realistic
parameters for this system that will allow us to study vacuum decay with
current experimental capabilities, including a prescription for efficiently
scanning over decay rates, and show that this setup will probe the quantum
(rather than thermal) decay regime at temperatures $T\lesssim10\,\mathrm{nK}$.
Our results help lay the groundwork for using upcoming cold-atom experiments as
a new probe of nonperturbative early-Universe physics.

<h3>Low temperature spin Seebeck effect in non-magnetic vanadium dioxide</h3>

<br>
<br>
The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) is sensitive to thermally driven magnetic
excitations in magnetic insulators. Vanadium dioxide in its insulating low
temperature phase is expected to lack magnetic degrees of freedom, as vanadium
atoms are thought to form singlets upon dimerization of the vanadium chains.
Instead, we find a paramagnetic SSE response in VO2 films that grows as the
temperature decreases below 50 K. The field and temperature dependent SSE
voltage is qualitatively consistent with a general model of paramagnetic SSE
response and inconsistent with triplet spin transport. The microscopic nature
of the magnetic excitations in VO2 requires further examination.

<h3>Theoretical determination of Ising-type transtion by using the  Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation</h3>

<br>
Over the years, the Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) has been
successfully utilized to determine the transition temperature of many different
magnetic models, particularly the Berezinskii-Thouless-Kosterlitz transition in
two-dimensional ferromagnets. More recently, the SCHA has found application in
describing ferromagnetic samples in spintronic experiments. In such a case, the
SCHA has proven to be an efficient formalism for representing the coherent
state in the ferromagnetic resonance state. One of the main advantages of using
the SCHA is the quadratic Hamiltonian, which incorporates thermal spin
fluctuations through renormalization parameters, keeping the description simple
while providing excellent agreement with experimental data. In this article, we
investigate the SCHA application in easy-axis magnetic models, a subject that
has not been adequately explored to date. We obtain both semiclassical and
quantum approaches of the SCHA for a general anisotropic magnetic model and
employ them to determine various quantities such as the transition temperature,
spin-wave energy spectrum, magnetization, and critical exponents. To verify the
accuracy of the method, we compare the SCHA results with experimental and Monte
Carlo simulation data for many distinct well-known magnetic materials.

<h3>Active Dynamics of Linear Chains and Rings in Porous Media</h3>

<br>
<br>
To understand the dynamical and conformational properties of deformable
active agents in porous media, we computationally investigate the dynamics of
linear chains and rings made of active Brownian monomers. In porous media,
flexible linear chains and rings always migrate smoothly and undergo
activity-induced swelling. However, semiflexible linear chains though navigate
smoothly, shrink at lower activities, followed by swelling at higher
activities, while semiflexible rings exhibit a contrasting behavior.
Semiflexible rings shrink, get trapped at lower activities, and escape at
higher activities. This demonstrates how activity and topology interplay and
control the structure and dynamics of linear chains and rings in porous media.
We envision that our study will shed light on understanding the mode of
transport of shape-changing active agents in porous media.

<h3>Flowering of Developable 2D Crystal Shapes in Closed, Fluid Membranes</h3>

The morphologies of two-dimensional (2D) crystals, nucleated, grown, and
integrated within 2D elastic fluids, for instance in giant vesicle membranes,
are dictated by an interplay of mechanics, permeability, and thermal
contraction. Mitigation of solid strain drives formation of crystals with
developable shapes (e.g. planar or cylindrical) that expel Gaussian curvature
into the 2D fluid. However, upon cooling to grow the crystals, large vesicles
sustain greater inflation and tension because their small area to volume ratio
slows water permeation. As a result, more elaborate shapes, for instance
flowers with bendable but inextensible petals form on large vesicles despite
their more gradual curvature, while small vesicles harbor compact planar
crystals. This size dependence runs counter to the known cumulative growth of
strain energy of 2D colloidal crystals on rigid spherical templates. This
interplay of intra-membrane mechanics and processing points to the scalable
production of flexible molecular crystals of controllable complex shape.

<h3>Hofstadter-like spectrum and Magnetization of Artificial Graphene  constructed with cylindrical and elliptical quantum dots</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this paper a comparative study of the electronic and magnetic properties
of quasi-two-dimensional electrons in an artificial graphene-like superlattice
composed of circular and elliptical quantum dots is presented. A complete
orthonormal set of basis wave functions, which has previously been constructed
in the frame of the Coulomb gauge for the vector potential has been implemented
for calculation of the energy dispersions, the Hofstadter spectra, the density
of states and the orbital magnetization of the considered systems, taking into
account both the translational symmetry of the superlattice and the wave
function phase-shifts due to the presence of a transverse external magnetic
field. Our calculations indicate a topological change in the miniband structure
due to the ellipticity of the quantum dots, and non-trivial modifications of
the electron energy dispersion surfaces in reciprocal space with the change of
the number of magnetic flux quanta through the unit cell of the superlattice.
The ellipticity of the QDs leads to an opening of a gap and considerable
modifications of the Hofstadter spectrum. The orbital magnetization is shown to
reveal significant oscillations with the change of the magnetic flux. The
deviation from the circular geometry of quantum dots has a qualitative impact
on the dependencies of the magnetization on both the magnetic flux and the
temperature.

<h3>Influence of interface-induced valley-Zeeman and spin-orbit couplings\\  on transport in graphene-on-WSe$_{2}$ heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02636" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02636</a>
<br>
<i>M. Zubair, P. Vasilopoulos, M. Tahir</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the electronic dispersion and transport properties of
graphene/WSe$_{2}$ heterostructures in the presence of a proximity induced
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) using a low-energy Hamiltonian, with different types
of symmetry breaking terms, obtained from a four-band, first and second
nearest-neighbour tight-binding (TB) one. The competition between different
perturbation terms leads to inverted SOC bands. Further, we study the effect of
symmetry breaking terms on ac and dc transport by evaluating the corresponding
conductivities within linear response theory. The scattering-independent part
of the valley-Hall conductivity, as a function of the Fermi energy $E_{F}$, is
mostly negative in the ranges $-\lambda_{R}\leqslant E_{F}$ and
$E_{F}\geqslant\lambda_{R}$ when the strength $\lambda_{R}$ of the Rashba SOC
increases except for a very narrow region around $E_{F}=0$ in which it peaks
sharply upward. The scattering-dependent diffusive conductivity increases
linearly with electron density, is directly proportional to $\lambda_{R}$ in
the low- and high-density regimes, but weakens for $\lambda_{R}=0$. We
investigate the optical response in the presence of a SOC-tunable band gap for
variable $E_{F}$. An interesting feature of this SOC tuning is that it can be
used to switch on and off the Drude-type intraband response. Furthermore, the
ac conductivity exhibits interband responses due to the Rashba SOC. We also
show that the valley-Hall conductivity changes sign when $E_F$ is comparable to
$\lambda_R$ and vanishes at higher values of $E_F$. It also exhibits a strong
dependence on temperature and a considerable structure as a function of the
frequency.

<h3>Energy Transfer in Random-Matrix ensembles of Floquet Hamiltonians</h3>

<i>Christina Psaroudaki, Gil Refael</i>
<br>
<br>
We explore the statistical properties of energy transfer in ensembles of
doubly-driven Random- Matrix Floquet Hamiltonians, based on universal symmetry
arguments. The energy pumping efficiency distribution P(E) is associated with
the Hamiltonian parameter ensemble and the eigenvalue statistics of the Floquet
operator. For specific Hamiltonian ensembles, P(E) undergoes a transition that
cannot be associated with a symmetry breaking of the instantaneous Hamiltonian.
The Floquet eigenvalue spacing distribution indicates the considered ensembles
constitute generic nonintegrable Hamiltonian families. As a step towards
Hamiltonian engineering, we develop a machine-learning classifier to understand
the relative parameter importance in resulting high conversion efficiency. We
propose Random Floquet Hamiltonians as a general framework to investigate
frequency conversion effects in a new class of generic dynamical processes
beyond adiabatic pumps.

<h3>Valley-controlled transport in graphene/ WSe$_{2}$ heterostructures  under an off-resonant polarized light</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02642" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02642</a>
<br>
<i>M. Zubair, P. Vasilopoulos, M. Tahir</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the electronic dispersion and transport properties of
graphene/WSe$_{2}$ heterostructures in the presence of a proximity-induced
spin-orbit coupling $\lambda_{v}$, sublattice potential $\Delta$, and an
off-resonant circularly polarized light of frequency $\Omega$ that renormalizes
$\Delta$ to $\bar{\Delta}_{\eta p} = \Delta +\eta p \Delta_{\Omega} $ with
$\eta$ and $p$ the valley and polarization indices, respectively, and $
\Delta_{\Omega} $ the gap due to the off-resonant circularly polarized light.
Using a low-energy Hamiltonian we find that the interplay between different
perturbation terms leads to inverted spin-orbit coupled bands. At high $\Omega$
we study the band structure and dc transport using the Floquet theory and
linear response formalism, respectively. We find that the inverted band
structure transfers into the direct band one when the off-resonant light is
present. The valley-Hall conductivity behaves as an even function of the Fermi
energy in the presence and absence of this light. At $\Delta_{\Omega}$ =
$\lambda_{v}$ - $\Delta$ a transition occurs from the valley-Hall phase to the
anomalous Hall phase. In addition, the valley-Hall conductivity switches sign
when the polarization of the off-resonant light changes. The valley
polarization vanishes for $\Delta_{\Omega}$ = 0 but it is finite for
$\Delta_{\Omega}$ $\neq$ 0 and reflects the lifting of the valley degeneracy of
the energy levels, for $\Delta_{\Omega} \neq 0$, when the off-resonant light is
present. The corresponding spin polarization, present for $\Delta_{\Omega}$ =
0, increases for $\Delta_{\Omega}$ $\neq$ 0. Further, pure $K$ or $K^{\prime}$
valley polarization is generated when $\Delta_{\Omega}$ changes sign. Also, the
charge Hall conductivity is finite for $\Delta_{\Omega}\neq 0$ and changes sign
when the handedness of the light polarization changes.

<h3>Noise-dissipation relation for nonlinear electronic circuits</h3>

<i>Léopold Van Brandt, Jean-Charles Delvenne</i>
<br>
<br>
An extension of fluctuation-dissipation theorem is used to derive a "speed
limit" theorem for nonlinear electronic devices. This speed limit provides a
lower bound on the dissipation that is incurred when transferring a given
amount of electric charge in a certain amount of time with a certain noise
level (average variance of the current). This bound, which implies a high
energy dissipation for fast, low-noise operations (such as switching a bit in a
digital memory), brings together recent results of stochastic thermodynamics
into a form that is usable for practical nonlinear electronic circuits, as we
illustrate on a switching circuit made of an nMOS pass gate in a
state-of-the-art industrial technology.

We carried out fully atomistic reactive molecular dynamics simulations to
study the mechanical behavior of six newly proposed hybrid schwarzite-based
structures (interlocked petal-schwarzites). Schwarzites are carbon crystalline
nanostructures with negative Gaussian curvature created by mapping a TPMS
(Triply Periodic Minimal Surface) with carbon rings containing six to eight
atoms. Our simulations have shown that petal-schwarzite structures can
withstand uni-axial compressive stress up to the order of GPa and can be
compressed past 50 percent strain without structural collapse. Our most
resistant hierarchical structure has a calculated compressive strength of
260~GPa and specific energy absorption (SEA) of 45.95 MJ/kg, while possessing a
mass density of only 685 kg/m$^3$. These results show that these structures
could be excellent lightweight materials for applications that require
mechanical energy absorption.

<br>
The interplay between chirality and topology nurtures many exotic electronic
properties. For instance, topological chiral semimetals display multifold
chiral fermions which manifest nontrivial topological charge and spin texture.
They are an ideal playground for exploring chirality-driven exotic physical
phenomena. In this work, we reveal a monopole-like orbital-momentum locking
texture on the three-dimensional Fermi surfaces of topological chiral
semimetals with B20 structures (e.g., RhSi and PdGa). This orbital texture
enables a large orbital Hall effect (OHE) and a giant orbital magnetoelectric
(OME) effect in the presence of current flow. Different enantiomers exhibit the
same OHE which can be converted to the spin Hall effect by spin-orbit coupling
in materials. In contrast, the OME effect is chirality dependent and much
larger than its spin counterpart. Our work reveals the crucial role of orbital
texture for understanding OHE and OME effect in topological chiral semimetals
and paves the path for applications in orbitronics, spintronics and enantiomer
recognition.

<h3>Superconductivity in the two-dimensional Hubbard model with cellular  dynamical mean-field theory: a quantum impurity model analysis</h3>

<br>
<br>
Doping a Mott insulator gives rise to unconventional superconducting
correlations. Here we address the interplay between d-wave superconductivity
and Mott physics using the two-dimensional Hubbard model with cellular
dynamical mean-field theory on a $2\times2$ plaquette. Our approach is to study
superconducting correlations from the perspective of a cluster quantum impurity
model embedded in a self-consistent bath. At the level of the cluster, we
calculate the probabilities of the possible cluster electrons configurations.
Upon condensation we find an increased probability that cluster electrons
occupy a four-electron singlet configuration, enabling us to identify this type
of short-range spin correlations as key to superconducting pairing. Increased
probability of this four-electron singlet comes at the expenses of reduced
probability of a four-electron triplet with no significant probability
redistribution of fluctuations of charges. This allows us to establish that
superconductivity at the level of the cluster primarily involves a
reorganisation of short-range spin correlations rather than charge
correlations. We gain information about the bath by studying the spectral
weight of the hybridization function. Upon condensation, we find a transfer of
spectral weight leading to the opening of a superconducting gap. We use these
insights to interpret the signatures of superconducting correlations in the
density of states of the system and in the zero-frequency spin susceptibility.

<h3>The Kibble-Zurek Scenario and Coarsening Across Nonequilibrium Phase  Transitions in Driven Vortices and Skyrmions</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the topological defect populations for superconducting
vortices and magnetic skyrmions on random pinning substrates under driving
amplitudes that are swept at different rates or suddenly quenched. When the
substrate pinning is sufficiently strong, the system exhibits a nonequilibrium
phase transition at a critical drive into a more topologically ordered state.
We examine the number of topological defects that remain as we cross the
ordering transition at different rates. In the vortex case, the system
dynamically orders into a moving smectic, and the Kibble-Zurek scaling
hypothesis gives exponents consistent with directed percolation. Due to their
strong Magnus force, the skyrmions dynamically order into an isotropic crystal,
producing different Kibble-Zurek scaling exponents that are more consistent
with coarsening. We argue that in the skyrmion crystal, the topological defects
can both climb and glide, facilitating coarsening, whereas in the vortex
smectic state, the defects cannot climb and coarsening is suppressed. We also
examine pulsed driving across the ordering transition and find that the defect
population on the ordered side of the transition decreases with time as a power
law, indicating that coarsening can occur across nonequilibrium phase
transitions. Our results should be general to a wide class of nonequilibrium
systems driven over random disorder where there are well-defined topological
defects.

<h3>Integral fluctuation theorems and trace-preserving map</h3>

The detailed fluctuation theorem implies the symmetry on the generating
function of the entropy production probability. The integral fluctuation
theorem follows immediately from this symmetry and normalization of the
probability. In this paper, we rewrite the generating function with complete
positive maps and show that the integral FT is determined by the
trace-preserving property of constructed maps. We demonstrate the convenience
of this framework by discussing the eigenstate fluctuation theorem and the heat
exchange between two systems. This set of methods is also applicable to the
generating function of quasi-probability, and we find that the Petz recovery
map can arise naturally from this framework. We also briefly discuss generating
functions for multitime processes, which may be helpful in studying the
generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.

A magnetic order in orthorhombic GdCu$_2$ was investigated via a single
crystal neutron diffraction with thermal neutron. Magnetic peaks were observed
at incommensurate positions described by the ordering vector
$q$=(${\delta}$,~1,~0) with ${\delta}$=0.678 at 4.6~K. This ordering vector is
close to the commensurate one with $q_{\rm c}$=(2/3,~1,~0) reported earlier,
but clearly deviates. The incommensurate nature of the magnetic order in
GdCu$_2$ is further corroborated by the peak shift with temperature below
$T_{\rm N}$.

Two-dimensional (2D) elemental semiconductors have great potential for device
applications, but their performance is limited by the lack of efficient doping
methods. Here, combining molecular beam epitaxy, scanning tunneling
microscopy/spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density
functional theory calculations, we investigate the evolution of the structural
and electronic properties of 2D selenium/tellurium films with increased Se
dosages on graphene/6H-SiC(0001) substrates. We found that Se atoms form
isovalent dopants by replacing surface Te atoms, which introduces efficient
electron doping and lowers the work function of Te films. With the Se dosage
increasing, two types of elemental 2D crystalline Se structures, trigonal Se
and Se8 molecular assembly films, are obtained on ultrathin Te films, which are
distinct from the amorphous Se acquired by depositing Se directly on
graphene/6H-SiC(0001). Our results shed light on tuning the electronic
properties of 2D elemental semiconductors by isovalent doping and constructing
heterostructures of isovalent 2D elemental materials.

<h3>Spin transport from order to disorder</h3>

Schwinger boson mean-field theory (SBMFT) is a non-perturbative approach
which treats ordered and disordered phases of magnetic systems on equal
footing. We leverage its versatility to evaluate the spin correlators which
determine thermally-induced spin transport (the spin Seebeck effect) in
Heisenberg ferromagnets (FMs) and antiferromagnets (AFs), at arbitrary
temperatures. In SBMFT, the spin current, $J_s$, is made up of
particle-hole-like excitations which carry integral spin angular momentum. Well
below the ordering temperature, $J_s$ is dominated by a magnonic contribution,
reproducing the behavior of a dilute-magnon gas. Near the transition
temperature, an additional, paramagnetic-like contribution becomes significant.
In the AF, the two contributions come with opposite signs, resulting in a
signature, rapid inversion of the spin Seebeck coefficient as a function of
temperature. Ultimately, at high temperatures, the low-field behavior of the
paramagnetic SSE reduces to Curie-Weiss physics. Analysis based on our theory
confirms that in recent experiments on gadolinium gallium garnet, the low-field
spin Seebeck coefficient $\mathcal{S}(T) \propto \chi(T)$, the spin
susceptibility, down to the Curie-Weiss temperature. At lower temperatures in
the disordered phase, our theory shows a deviation of $\mathcal{S}(T)$ relative
to $\chi(T)$ in both FMs and AFs, which increases with decreasing temperature
and arises due to a paramagnetic liquid phase in our theory. These results
demonstrate that the SSE can be a probe of the short-ranged magnetic
correlations in disordered correlated spin systems and spin liquids.

<br>
We developed a metallic pressure cell made of nickel-chromium-aluminum
(NiCrAl) for use with a non-destructive pulse magnet and a magnetic
susceptibility measurement apparatus with a proximity detector oscillator (PDO)
in pulsed magnetic fields of up to 51 T under pressures of up to 2.1 GPa. Both
the sample and sensor coil of the PDO were placed in the cell so that the
magnetic signal from NiCrAl would not overlay the intrinsic magnetic
susceptibility of the sample. A systematic investigation of the Joule heating
originating from metallic parts of the pressure cell revealed that the
temperature at the sample position remains at almost 1.4 K until approximately
80 $\%$ of the maximum applied magnetic field ($H_{\rm max}$) in the
field-ascending process (e.g., 40 T for $H_{\rm max}$ of 51 T). The
effectiveness of our apparatus was demonstrated, by investigating the pressure
dependence of the magnetization process of the triangular-lattice
antiferromagnet Ba$_3$CoSb$_2$O$_9$.

The donor-acceptor interaction of a charge-coupled heterostructure
encompassing a metal and an amorphous semiconductor subjected to a laser field
has many potential applications in the realm of nonlinear optics. In this work,
we fabricate an electron donor gold nanoparticle (AuNP) and acceptor amorphous
Ge24Se76 heterostructure on a quartz substrate using a sequential thermal
evaporation technique. In this charge-coupled heterostructure, we demonstrate
the ultrafast third-order nonlinear absorptive and refractive response and
their sign reversal compared to pristine Ge24Se76. Enhanced optical
nonlinearity in these heterostructures of varying plasmonic wavelengths is due
to charge transfer, verified by the Raman spectroscopy. Further, the ultrafast
transient absorption measurements support the thesis of charge transfer in the
AuNP/Ge24Se76 heterostructure. These findings open up exciting opportunities
for developing novel device technologies with far-reaching applications in
nonlinear optics.

<h3>On the conditions of validity of the Boltzmann equation and Boltzmann  H-theorem</h3>

In this paper the problem is posed of the formulation of the so-called "ab
initio" approach to the statistical description of the Boltzmann-Sinai N-body
classical dynamical system (CDS) formed by identical smooth hard spheres. This
amounts to introducing a suitably-generalized version of the axioms of
Classical Statistical Mechanics. The latter involve a proper definition of the
functional setting for the N-body probability density function (PDF), so that
it includes also the case of the deterministic N-body PDF. In connection with
this issue, a further development concerns the introduction of modified
collision boundary conditions which differ from the usual ones adopted in
previous literature. Both features are proved to be consistent with the
validity of exact H-theorems for the N-body and 1-body PDFs respectively.
Consequences of the axiomatic approach which concern the conditions of validity
of the Boltzmann kinetic equation and the Boltzmann H-theorem are investigated.
In particular, the role of the modified boundary conditions is discussed. It is
shown that both theorems fail in the case in which the N-body PDF is identified
with the deterministic PDF. Finally, the issue of applicability of the Zermelo
and Loschmidt paradoxes to the "ab initio" approach presented here is
discussed.

<br>
<br>
An important challenge in active matter lies in harnessing useful global work
from entities that produce work locally, e.g., via self-propulsion. We
investigate here the active matter version of a classical capillary rise
effect, by considering a non-phase separated sediment of self-propelled Janus
colloids in contact with a vertical wall. We provide experimental evidence of
an unexpected and dynamic adsorption layer at the wall. Additionally, we
develop a complementary numerical model that recapitulates the experimental
observations. We show that an adhesive and aligning wall enhances the
pre-existing polarity heterogeneity within the bulk, enabling polar active
particles to climb up a wall against gravity, effectively powering a global
flux. Such steady-state flux has no equivalent in a passive wetting layer.

<h3>Early stage of Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate test: Fracture of a  high-volume-fraction gel</h3>

<br>
<br>
Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) is a clinical parameter used as a
non-specific marker for inflammation, and recent studies have shown that it is
linked to the collapse of the gel formed by red blood cells (RBCs) at
physiological hematocrits (i.e. RBC volume fraction). Previous research has
suggested that the delay time before the sedimentation process is related to
the formation of fractures in the gel. Moreover, RBC gels present specific
properties due to the anisotropic shape and flexibility of the RBCs. Namely,
the onset of the collapse is reached earlier and the settling velocity of the
gel increases with increasing attraction between the RBCs, while gel of
spherical particles show the opposite trend. Here, we report experimental
observations of the gel structure during this onset and suggest an equation
modeling this initial process as fracturing of the gel. We demonstrate that
this equation provides a model for the motion of the interface between blood
plasma and the RBC gel, along the whole time span. We also observe that the
increase in the attraction between the RBCs modifies the density of fractures
in the gel, which explains why the gel displays a decrease in delay time when
the aggregation energy between the RBCs increases. Our work uncovers the
detailed physical mechanism underlying the ESR and provides insights into the
fracture dynamics of a RBC gel. These results can improve the accuracy of
clinical measurements.

<br>
<br>
Microwave loss in superconducting titanium nitride (TiN) films is attributed
to two-level systems in various interfaces arising in part from oxidation and
microfabrication-induced damage. Atomic layer etching (ALE) is an emerging
subtractive fabrication method which is capable of etching with Angstrom-scale
etch depth control and potentially less damage. However, while ALE processes
for TiN have been reported, they either employ HF vapor, incurring practical
complications; or the etch rate lacks the desired control. Further, the
superconducting characteristics of the etched films have not been
characterized. Here, we report an isotropic plasma-thermal TiN ALE process
consisting of sequential exposures to molecular oxygen and an SF$_6$/H$_2$
plasma. For certain ratios of SF$_6$:H$_2$ flow rates, we observe selective
etching of TiO$_2$ over TiN, enabling self-limiting etching within a cycle.
Etch rates were measured to vary from 1.1 \r{A}/cycle at 150 $^\circ$C to 3.2
\r{A}/cycle at 350 $^\circ$C using ex-situ ellipsometry. We demonstrate that
the superconducting critical temperature of the etched film does not decrease
beyond that expected from the decrease in film thickness, highlighting the
low-damage nature of the process. These findings have relevance for
applications of TiN in microwave kinetic inductance detectors and
superconducting qubits.

<h3>Sampling efficiency of transverse forces in dense liquids</h3>

<br>
<br>
Sampling the Boltzmann distribution using forces that violate detailed
balance can be faster than with the equilibrium evolution, but the acceleration
depends on the nature of the nonequilibrium drive and the physical situation.
Here, we study the efficiency of forces transverse to energy gradients in dense
liquids through a combination of techniques: Brownian dynamics simulations,
exact infinite-dimensional calculation and a mode-coupling approximation. We
find that the sampling speedup varies non-monotonically with temperature, and
decreases as the system becomes more glassy. We characterize the interplay
between the distance to equilibrium and the efficiency of transverse forces by
means of odd transport coefficients.

Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic transition metal compounds with atomic
thickness exhibit intriguing physics in fundamental research and great
potential for device applications. Understanding the correlations between their
macrosopic magnetic properties and the dimensionality of microscopic magnetic
exchange interactions are valuable for the designing and applications of 2D
magnetic crystals. Here, using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy,
magnetization and magneto-transport measurements, we identify the
zigzag-antiferromagnetism in monolayer CrTe2, incipient ferromagnetism in
bilayer CrTe2, and robust ferromagnetism in bilayer Cr3Te4 films. Our density
functional theory calculations unravel that the magnetic ordering in ultrathin
CrTe2 is sensitive to the lattice parameters, while robust ferromagnetism with
large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in Cr3Te4 is stabilized through its
anisotropic 3D magnetic exchange interactions.

The multifunctional materials with prominent properties such as electrical,
ferroelectric, magnetic, optical and magneto-optical are of keen interest to
several practical implications. In the roadmap of designing such materials, in
the present work, using density functional theory based first-principles
calculations, we have investigated the functional properties of transition
metal substituted-NBT. Our calculations predict the emergence of half-metallic
ferromagnetism in the system. A nonzero magnetic moment of 1.49 $\mu_{\rm
B}/{\rm f.u.}$ is obtained for 25\% concentration of Ni. Our data on optical
properties for pure NBT is in excellent agreement with available theory and
experiments. For Ni-NBT, we observed a diverging nature of static dielectric
constant, which could be attributed to the induced metallic character in the
material. Our simulations on MOKE predict a significant Kerr signal of
0.7$^\circ$ for 6.25\% Ni-concentration.

<h3>Critical behavior of Anderson transitions in higher dimensional  Bogoliubov-de Gennes symmetry classes</h3>

<br>
<br>
Disorder is ubiquitous in solid-state systems, and its crucial influence on
transport properties was revealed by the discovery of Anderson localization.
Generally speaking, all bulk states will be exponentially localized in the
strong disorder limit, but whether an Anderson transition takes place depends
on the dimension and symmetries of the system. The scaling theory and symmetry
classes are at the heart of the study of the Anderson transition, and the
critical exponent $\nu$ characterizing the power-law divergence of localization
length is of particular interest. In contrast with the well-established lower
critical dimension $d_l=2$ of the Anderson transition, the upper critical
dimension $d_u$, above which the disordered system can be described by
mean-field theory, remains uncertain, and precise numerical evaluations of the
critical exponent in higher dimensions are needed. In this study, we apply
Borel-Pad\'e resummation method to the known perturbative results of the
non-linear sigma model (NL$\sigma$M) to estimate the critical exponents of the
Boguliubov-de Gennes (BdG) classes. We also report numerical simulations of
class DIII in 3D, and classes C and CI in 4D, and compare the results of the
resummation method with these and previously published work. Our results may be
experimentally tested in realizations of quantum kicked rotor models in
atomic-optic systems, where the critical behavior of dynamical localization in
higher dimensions can be measured.

The rising demand for high-performing batteries requires new technological
concepts. To facilitate fast charge and discharge, hierarchically structured
electrodes offer short diffusion paths in the active material. However, there
are still gaps in understanding the influences on the cell performance of such
electrodes. Here, we employed a cell model to demonstrate that the morphology
of the hierarchically structured electrode determines which electrochemical
processes dictate the cell performance. The potentially limiting processes
include electronic conductivity within the porous secondary particles, solid
diffusion within the primary particles, and ionic transport in the electrolyte
surrounding the secondary particles. Our insights enable a goal-oriented
tailoring of hierarchically structured electrodes for high-power applications.

<h3>Spin and orbital Edelstein effect in a bilayer system with Rashba  interaction</h3>

<br>
<br>
The spin Edelstein effect has proven to be a promising phenomenon to generate
spin polarization from a charge current in systems without inversion symmetry.
In recent years, a current-induced orbital magnetization, called orbital
Edelstein effect, has been predicted for various systems with broken inversion
symmetry, using the atom-centered approximation and the modern theory of
orbital magnetization. In this work, we study the current-induced spin and
orbital magnetization for a bilayer system with Rashba interaction, using the
modern theory of orbital magnetization and Boltzmann transport theory in
relaxation-time approximation. We found that the orbital effect can be
significantly larger than the spin effect, depending on the model parameters.
Furthermore, the Edelstein response can be enhanced, suppressed, and even
reversed, depending on the relation of the effective Rashba parameters of each
layer. A sign change of the orbital polarization is related to an interchange
of the corresponding layer localization of the states.

We have performed micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on
NdSb which exhibits the type-I antiferromagnetism below TN = 16 K. We succeeded
in selectively observing the band structure for all the three types of single-q
antiferromagnetic (AF) domains at the surface. We found that the two of three
surfaces whose AF-ordering vector lies within the surface plane commonly show
two-fold-symmetric surface states (SSs) around the bulk-band edges, whereas the
other surface with an out-of-plane AF-ordering vector displays
four-fold-symmetric shallow electronlike SS at the Brillouin-zone center. We
suggest that these SSs commonly originate from the combination of the PT
(space-inversion and time-reversal) symmetry breaking at the surface and the
band folding due to the AF order. The present results pave a pathway toward
understanding the relationship between the symmetry and the surface electronic
states in antiferromagnets.

Graphene is thought to be a promising materials for many applications.
However, pristine graphene is not suitable for most electrochemical devices,
where defect engineering is crucial for its performance. We demonstrate how
boron doping of graphene can alter its reactivity, electrical conductivity and
potential application for sodium and aluminium storage, with the emphasis on
novel metal-ion batteries. Using DFT calculations, we investigate both the
influence of boron concentration and the oxidation of the material, on the
mentioned properties. It is demonstrated that the presence of boron in graphene
increases its reactivity towards atomic hydrogen and oxygen-containing species,
in other words, it makes B-doped graphene more prone to oxidation.
Additionally, the presence of these surface functional groups significantly
alters the type and strength of the interaction of Na and Al with the given
materials. Boron-doping and oxidation of graphene is found to increase Na
storage capacity of graphene by the factor of up to 4.

Misfit layer compounds are heterostructures composed of rocksalt units
stacked with few layers transition metal dichalcogenides. They host Ising
superconductivity, charge density waves and good thermoelectricity. The design
of misfits emergent properties is, however, hindered by the lack of a global
understanding of the electronic transfer among the constituents. Here, by
performing first principles calculations, we unveil the mechanism controlling
the charge transfer and demonstrate that rocksalt units are always donor and
dichalcogenides acceptors. We show that misfits behave as a periodic
arrangement of ultra-tunable field effect transistors where a charging as large
as 6\times10^{14} e^-cm^{-2} can be reached and controlled efficiently by the
La-Pb alloying in the rocksalt. Finally, we identify a strategy to design
emergent superconductivity and demonstrate its applicability in
(LaSe)_{1.27}(SnSe_2)_2. Our work paves the way to the design synthesis of
misfit compounds with tailored physical properties.

Photons are emitted or absorbed by a nano-circuit under both equilibrium and
non-equilibrium situations. Here, we focus on the non-equilibrium situation
arising due to a temperature difference between the leads of a quantum point
contact, and study the finite frequency (colored) noise. We explore this
delta-$T$ noise in the finite frequency regime for two systems: conventional
conductors described by Fermi liquid scattering theory and the fractional
quantum Hall system at Laughlin filling fractions, described by the chiral
Luttinger liquid formalism. We study the emission noise, its expansion in the
temperature difference (focusing on the quadratic component) as well as the
excess emission noise defined with respect to a properly chosen equilibrium
situation. The behavior of these quantities are markedly different for the
fractional quantum Hall system compared to Fermi liquids, signalling the role
of strong correlations. We briefly treat the strong backscattering regime of
the fractional quantum Hall liquid, where a behavior closer to the Fermi liquid
case is observed.

<br>
Few-layer graphene deposited on semiconductor nanorods separated by undoped
spacers has been studied in perspective for the fabrication of stable
nanoresonators. We show that an applied bias between the graphene layer and the
nanorod substrate affects the graphene electrode in two ways: 1) by a change of
the carrier concentration in graphene and 2) by inducing strain, as
demonstrated by the Raman spectroscopy. The capacitance of the investigated
structures scales with the area of graphene in contact with the nanorods. Due
to the reduced contact surface, the efficiency of graphene gating is one order
of magnitude lower than for a comparable structure without nanorods. The shift
of graphene Raman modes observed under bias clearly shows the presence of
electrostatically-induced strain and only a weak modification of carrier
concentration, both independent of number of graphene layers. A higher impact
of bias on strain was observed for samples with a larger contact area between
the graphene and the nanorods which shows perspective for the construction of
sensors and nanoresonator devices.

Rare-earth engineering is an effective way to introduce and tune the
magnetism in topological Kagome magnets, which has been acting as a fertile
platform to investigate the quantum interactions between geometry, topology,
spin, and correlation. Here we report the structure and properties of three
newly discovered Titanium-based Kagome metals RETi3Bi4 (RE = Yb, Pr, and Nd)
with various magnetic states. They crystalize in the orthogonal space group
Fmmm (No.69), where slightly distorted Ti Kagome lattice, RE triangular
lattice, Bi honeycomb and triangular lattices stack along the a axis. By
changing the rare earth atoms on RE zag-zig chains, the magnetism can be tuned
from nonmagnetic YbTi3Bi4 to short-range ordered PrTi3Bi4 (Tanomaly ~ 8.2 K),
and finally to ferromagnetic NdTi3Bi4 (Tc ~ 8.5 K). The measurements of
resistivity and specific heat capacity demonstrate an evolution of electron
correlation and density of states near the Fermi level with different rare
earth atoms. In-situ resistance measurements of NdTi3Bi4 under high pressure
further reveal a potential relationship between the electron correlation and
ferromagnetic ordering temperature. These results highlight RETi3Bi4 as another
family of topological Kagome magnets to explore nontrivial band topology and
exotic phases in Kagome materials.

The discovery of superconductivity with a critical temperature of 80~K in
La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ under pressure has received enormous attention.
La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ is not superconducting under ambient pressure but
exhibits a density-wave-like transition at $T^{\ast} \simeq 115$~K.
Understanding the electronic correlations, charge dynamics and dominant
orbitals are important steps towards the mechanism of superconductivity and
other instabilities. Here, our optical study shows that La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$
features strong electronic correlations which significantly reduce the
electron's kinetic energy and place it in the proximity of the Mott phase. The
low-frequency optical conductivity reveals two Drude components arising from
multiple bands dominated by the Ni-$d_{x^2 - y^2}$ and Ni-$d_{3z^2 - r^2}$
orbitals at the Fermi level. Above $T^{\ast}$, the scattering rates for both
Drude components vary linearly with temperature, indicating non-Fermi-liquid
behavior which may be associated with spin-fluctuation scattering. Below
$T^{\ast}$, a gap opens in the Ni-$d_{3z^2 - r^2}$ orbital, suggesting the
importance of the Ni-$d_{3z^2 - r^2}$ orbital in the density-wave-like
instability. Our experimental results provide key insights into the mechanism
of the density-wave-like order and superconductivity in
La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$.

The phase field crystal model allows the study of materials on atomic length
and diffusive time scales. It accounts for elastic and plastic deformation in
crystal lattices, including several processes such as growth, dislocation
dynamics, and microstructure evolution. The amplitude expansion of the phase
field crystal model (APFC) describes the atomic density by a small set of
Fourier modes with slowly-varying amplitudes characterizing lattice
deformations. This approach allows for tackling large, three-dimensional
systems. However, it has been used mostly for modeling basic lattice
symmetries. In this work, we present a coarse-grained description of the
hexagonal closed-packed (HCP) lattice that supports lattice deformation and
defects. It builds on recent developments of the APFC model and introduces
specific modeling aspects for this crystal structure. After illustrating the
general modeling framework, we show that the proposed approach allows for
simulating relatively large three-dimensional HCP systems hosting complex
defect networks.

In an open quantum system having a channel in the form of loop geometry, the
current inside the channel, namely circular current, and overall junction
current, namely transport current, can be different. A quantum ring has doubly
degenerate eigen energies due to periodic boundary condition that is broken in
an asymmetric ring where the ring is asymmetrically connected to the external
electrodes. Kramers' degeneracy and spin degeneracy can be lifted by
considering non-zero magnetic field and spin-orbit interaction (SOI),
respectively. Here, we find that symmetry breaking impacts the circular current
density vs energy ($E$) spectra in addition to lifting the degeneracy. For
charge and spin current densities, the corresponding effects are not the same.
Under symmetry-breaking they may remain symmetric or anti-symmetric or
asymmetric around $E = 0$ whereas the transmission function (which is
proportional to the junction current density) vs energy characteristic remains
symmetric around $E = 0$. This study leads us to estimate the qualitative
nature of the circular current and the choices of Fermi-energy/chemical
potential to have a net non-zero current. As a result, we may manipulate the
system to generate pure currents of charge, spin, or both, which is necessary
for any spintronic and electronic applications.

The spin of a single electron confined in a semiconductor quantum dot is a
natural qubit candidate. Fundamental building blocks of spin-based quantum
computing have been demonstrated in double quantum dots with significant
spin-orbit coupling. Here, we show that spin-orbit-coupled double quantum dots
can be categorised in six classes, according to a partitioning of the
multi-dimensional space of their $g$-tensors. The class determines physical
characteristics of the double dot, i.e., features in transport, spectroscopy
and coherence measurements, as well as qubit control, shuttling, and readout
experiments. In particular, we predict that the spin physics is highly
simplified due to pseudospin conservation, whenever the external magnetic field
is pointing to special directions (`magic directions'), where the number of
special directions is determined by the class. We also analyze the existence
and relevance of magic loops in the space of magnetic-field directions,
corresponding to equal local Zeeman splittings. These results present an
important step toward precise interpretation and efficient design of spin-based
quantum computing experiments in materials with strong spin-orbit coupling.

In this study, we investigate the behavior of vortex singularities in the
phase of the Green's function of a general non-interacting fermionic lattice
model in three dimensions after an instantaneous quench. We find that the full
set of vortices form one-dimensional dynamical objects, which we call vortex
loops. The number of such vortex loops can be interpreted as a quantized order
parameter that distinguishes between different non-equilibrium phases. We show
that changes in this order parameter are related to dynamical quantum phase
transitions (DQPTs). Our results are applicable to general lattice models in
three dimensions. For concreteness, we present them in the context of a simple
two-band Weyl semimetal. We also show that the vortex loops survive in weakly
interacting systems. Finally, we observe that vortex loops can form complex
dynamical patterns in momentum space due to the existence of band touching Weyl
nodes. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing definitions of
dynamical order parameters in non-equilibrium systems.

The van der Waals (vdW) semiconductor black phosphorus has been widely
studied, especially after the discovery of phosphorene. On the contrary, its
sister compound violet phosphorus, also a vdW semiconductor, has been rarely
studied. Here we report the pressure-induced superconductivity in violet
phosphorus up to $\sim$40 GPa. The superconductivity emerges at 2.75 GPa, which
is well below the structural transition from monoclinic ($M$) to rhombohedral
($R$) structure at 8.5 GPa. The superconducting transition temperature
($T$$\rm_c$) shows a plateau of $\sim$7 K from 3.6 to 15 GPa, across the $M$ to
$R$ structural transition, then jumps to another plateau of $\sim$10 K in the
simple cubic ($C$) structure above 15 GPa. The temperature-pressure
superconducting phase diagram of violet phosphorus is established, which is
different from that of black phosphorus at low pressure. For black phosphorus,
the superconductivity emerges until the structural transition from orthorhombic
($O$) to $R$ structure at $\sim$5 GPa, with a lower $T$$\rm_c$ than violet
phosphorus. The pressure-induced superconductivity in violet phosphorus
demonstrates its tunable electronic properties, and more electronics and
optoelectronic applications are expected from this stable vdW semiconductor at
ambient conditions.

<h3>Thermal properties of athermal granular materials</h3>

Two and a half centuries after Coulomb's explanation of the angle of repose
of a granular pile in relation to frictional slip between different layers, our
understanding of yielding processes in granular materials remains incomplete.
The main reason for this is that granular piles are comprised of a vast
ensemble of discrete solid particles that interact through intricate molecular
contact forces. Here, we explore the dynamics of a dry granular system at both
the granular and molecular levels, revealing two qualitatively distinct
yielding behaviors. We show that, while the friction peak associated with the
granular rearrangement is independent of time, the molecular friction displays
aging that is thermal in nature. We observe that a granular system subjected to
a sub-critical stress can show thermally activated processes through slow creep
deformations. As a result, the system under stress, without granular-level
friction, is susceptible to a spontaneous failure, which may occur after a
delay as long as several hundred seconds. These findings have important
practical implications for understanding the yielding of granular materials
under various loading conditions at different temperatures, with potential
applications spanning from the processing of powdered materials in the polymer,
pharmaceutical, and food industries to geotechnical engineering and geophysics.

How dissipation affects transport is an important theme in quantum science.
Here we theoretically investigate an impact of a single-particle loss in
mesoscopic transport, which has been an issue in experiments of ultracold
atomic gases. By explicitly analyzing quantum point contact and quantum dot
systems, we obtain a cumulant generating function on the particle current whose
formal expression turns out to be common to two systems. In terms of this
generating function, behaviors of average current, particle loss rate, and
noises in presences of losses introduced in conduction channels are exemplified
for free fermions. It is shown that the current noise contains the component
proportional to the particle loss rate, which may be measurable in experiments.

Inspired by recent experimental discoveries of superconductivity in
chirally-stacked and twisted multilayer graphene, we study models of $f$-wave
superconductivity on the honeycomb lattice with arbitrary numbers of layers.
These models respect a mirror symmetry that allows classification of the bands
by a mirror-projected winding number $\nu_\pm$. For odd numbers of layers, the
systems are topologically nontrivial with $\nu_\pm = \pm 1$. Along each
mirror-preserving edge in armchair nanoribbons, there are two protected
Majorana zero modes. These modes are present even if the sample is finite in
both directions, such as in rectangular and hexagonal flakes. Crucially, zero
modes can also be confined to vortex cores, which can be created by a magnetic
field or localized magnetic impurities and accessed by local scanning probes.
Finally, we apply these models to twisted bilayer and trilayer systems, which
also feature boundary-projected and vortex-confined zero modes. Since vortices
are experimentally accessible, our study suggests that superconducting
multilayer graphene systems are promising platforms to create and manipulate
Majorana zero modes.

<h3>Bose metal in exactly solvable model with infinite-range  Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction</h3>

In a conventional boson system, the ground state can either be an insulator
or a superfluid (SF) due to the duality between particle number and phase. This
paper reveals that the long-sought Bose metal (BM) state can be realized in an
exactly solvable interacting bosonic model, i.e. the Bose-Hatsugai-Kohmoto
(BHK) model, which acts as the nontrivial extension of Bose-Hubbard (BH) model.
By tuning the parameters such as bandwidth $W$, chemical potential $\mu$, and
interaction strength $U$, a BM state without any symmetry-breaking can be
accessed for a generic $W/U$ ratio, while a Mott insulator (MI) with integer
boson density is observed at small $W/U$. The quantum phase transition between
the MI and BM states belongs to the universality class of the Lifshitz
transition, which is further confirmed by analyzing the momentum-distribution
function, the Drude weight, and the superfluid density. Additionally, our
investigation at finite temperature reveals similarities between the BM state
and the Fermi liquid, such as a linear-$T$ dependent heat capacity ($Cv\sim
\gamma T$) and a saturated charge susceptibility ($\chi_{c} \sim $ constant) as
$T$ approaches zero. Comparing the BM state with the SF state in the standard
BH model, we find that the key feature of the BM state is a compressible total
wavefunction accompanied by an incompressible zero-momentum component. Given
that the BM state prevails over the SF state at any finite $U$ in the BHK
model, our work suggests the possibility of realizing the BM state with on-site
repulsion interactions in momentum space.

The stability of a quantum critical point in the $O(N)$ universality class
with respect to an elastic coupling, that preserves $O(N)$ symmetry, is
investigated for isotropic elasticity in the framework of the renormalization
group (RG) close to the upper critical dimension $d=3-\epsilon$. If the elastic
coupling is relevant in the RG sense, we find that the crystal becomes
microscopically unstable, i.e., a sound velocity vanishes, at a finite value of
the correlation length $\xi$. If the elastic coupling is irrelevant, an
additional fixed point emerges that is located at a finite value of the
dimensionless elastic coupling. This fixed point is repulsive and separates the
flow to weak and strong elastic coupling. As the fixed point is approached the
sound velocity is found to vanish only asymptotically as $\xi \to \infty$ such
that the crystal remains microscopically stable for any finite value of $\xi$.
The fixed point structure we find for the quantum problem is distinct from the
classical counterpart in $d=4-\epsilon$, where the crystal remains always
microscopically stable for finite $\xi$.

<h3>Ergodicity-breaking phase diagram and fractal dimensions in long-range  models with generically correlated disorder</h3>

Models with correlated disorders are rather common in physics. In some of
them, like the Aubry-Andr\'e (AA) model, the localization phase diagram can be
found from the (self)duality with respect to the Fourier transform. In the
others, like the all-to-all translation-invariant Rosenzweig-Porter (TI RP)
ensemble or the Hilbert-space structure of the many-body localization, one
needs to develop more sophisticated and usually phenomenological methods to
find the localization transition. In addition, such models contain not only
localization but also the ergodicity-breaking transition, giving way to the
non-ergodic extended phase of states with non-trivial fractal dimensions $D_q$.
In this work, we suggest a method to calculate both the above transitions and a
lower bound to the fractal dimensions $D_2$ and $D_\infty$, relevant for
physical observables. In order to verify this method, we apply it to the class
of long-range (self-)dual models, interpolating between AA and TI RP ones via
both power-law dependences of on-site disorder correlations and hopping terms,
and, thus, being out of the validity range of the previously developed methods.
We show that the interplay of the correlated disorder and the power-law
decaying hopping terms leads to the emergence of the two types of fractal
phases in an entire range of parameters, even without having any
quasiperiodicity of the AA potential. The analytical results of the above
method are in full agreement with the extensive numerical calculations.

The ability to reversibly toggle between two distinct states in a
non-volatile method is important for information storage applications. Such
devices have been realized for phase-change materials, which utilizes local
heating methods to toggle between a crystalline and an amorphous state with
distinct electrical properties. To expand such kind of switching between two
topologically distinct phases requires non-volatile switching between two
crystalline phases with distinct symmetries. Here we report the observation of
reversible and non-volatile switching between two stable and closely-related
crystal structures with remarkably distinct electronic structures in the near
room temperature van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_{5-\delta}$GeTe$_2$. From a
combination of characterization techniques we show that the switching is
enabled by the ordering and disordering of an Fe site vacancy that results in
distinct crystalline symmetries of the two phases that can be controlled by a
thermal annealing and quenching method. Furthermore, from symmetry analysis as
well as first principle calculations, we provide understanding of the key
distinction in the observed electronic structures of the two phases:
topological nodal lines compatible with the preserved global inversion symmetry
in the site-disordered phase, and flat bands resulting from quantum destructive
interference on a bipartite crystaline lattice formed by the presence of the
site order as well as the lifting of the topological degeneracy due to the
broken inversion symmetry in the site-ordered phase. Our work not only reveals
a rich variety of quantum phases emergent in the metallic van der Waals
ferromagnets due to the presence of site ordering, but also demonstrates the
potential of these highly tunable two-dimensional magnets for memory and
spintronics applications.

Non-Hermitian topological phases have gained immense attention due to their
potential to unlock novel features beyond Hermitian bounds. PT-symmetric
(Parity Time-reversal symmetric) non-Hermitian models have been studied
extensively over the past decade. In recent years, the topological properties
of general non-Hermitian models, regardless of the balance between gains and
losses, have also attracted vast attention. Here we propose a non-Hermitian
second-order topological (SOT) insulator that hosts gapless corner states on a
two-dimensional quasi-crystalline lattice (QL). We first construct a
non-Hermitian extension of the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model on a QL
generated by the Amman-Beenker (AB) tiling. This model has real spectra and
supports helical edge states. Corner states emerge by adding a proper Wilson
mass term that gaps out the edge states. We propose two variations of the mass
term that result in fascinating characteristics. In the first variation, we
obtain a purely real spectra for the second-order topological phase. In the
latter, we get a complex spectra with corner states localized at only two
corners. Our findings pave a path to engineering exotic SOT phases where corner
states can be localized at designated corners.

Proteins involved in signaling pathways represent an interesting target for

determines the translational mobility at the surface of proteins. They also
represent a challenge, since the hydration dynamics at all sites remains
relatively rapid, requiring sensitive measurements capable of drawing finder
distinctions. Targeting the protein K-Ras, we find ODNP cross-relaxivity values
that appear consistent within similar regions of 3D space, regardless of the
specific residue where the spin probe used to select the location has been

Elementary point charge excitations in 3+1D topological phases can condense
along a line and form a descendant excitation called the Cheshire string.
Unlike the elementary flux loop excitations in the system, Cheshire strings do
not have to appear as the boundary of a 2D disc and can exist on open line
segments. On the other hand, Cheshire strings are different from trivial
excitations that can be created with local unitaries in 0d and finite depth
quantum circuits in 1d and higher. In this paper, we show that to create a
Cheshire string, one needs a linear depth circuit that acts sequentially along
the length of the string. Once a Cheshire string is created, its deformation,
movement and fusion can be realized by finite depths circuits. This circuit
depth requirement applies to all nontrivial descendant excitations including
symmetry-protected topological chains and the Majorana chain.

We theoretically investigate the possibility of obtaining Majorana zero modes
(MZMs) in penta-silicene nanoribbons (p-SiNRs) with induced \textit{p}-wave
superconductivity. The model explicitly considers an external magnetic field
perpendicularly applied to the nanoribbon plane, as well as an extrinsic Rashba
spin-orbit coupling (RSOC), in addition to the first nearest neighbor hopping
term and \textit{p}-wave superconducting pairing. By analyzing the dispersion
relation profiles, we observe the successive closing and reopening of the
induced superconducting gap with a single spin component, indicating a
spin-polarized topological phase transition (TPT). Correspondingly, the plots
of the energy spectrum versus the chemical potential reveal the existence of
zero-energy states with a preferential spin orientation characterized by
nonoverlapping wave functions localized at opposite ends of the superconducting
p-SiNRs. These findings strongly suggest the emergence of topologically
protected, spin-polarized MZMs at the ends of the p-SiNRs with induced
\textit{p}-wave superconducting pairing, which can be realized by proximitizing
the nanoribbon with an \textit{s}-wave superconductor, such as lead. The
proposal paves the way for silicene-based Majorana devices hosting multiple
MZMs with a well-defined spin orientation, with possible applications in
fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms and Majorana spintronics.
