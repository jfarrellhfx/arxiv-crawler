Hydrodynamics is a powerful emergent theory for the large-scale behaviours in
many-body systems, quantum or classical. It is a gradient series expansion,
where different orders of spatial derivatives provide an effective description
on different length scales. We here report the first general derivation of
third-order, or "dispersive", terms in the hydrodynamic expansion. We obtain
fully general Kubo-like expressions for the associated hydrodynamic
coefficients, and we determine their expressions in quantum integrable models,
introducing in this way purely quantum higher-order terms into generalised
hydrodynamics. We emphasise the importance of hydrodynamic gauge fixing at
diffusive order, where we claim that it is parity-time-reversal, and not
time-reversal, invariance that is at the source of Einstein's relation,
Onsager's reciprocal relations, the Kubo formula and entropy production. At
higher hydrodynamic orders we introduce a more general, n-th order "symmetric"
gauge, which we show implies the validity of the higher-order hydrodynamic
description.

<h3>Phase diagram, band structure and density of states in two-dimensional  attractive Fermi-Hubbard model with Rashba spin-orbit coupling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16974" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16974</a>

<br>
<br>
Based on the two-dimensional (2D) attractive Fermi-Hubbard model with Rashba
spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the SOC strength and Zeeman field dependences of the
phase diagram are investigated by calculating the pairing gap
self-consistently. The results reveal that the phase transition from the BCS
superfluid to the topological superfluid happens under proper Zeeman field
strength and SOC strength. In particular, in contrast to the BCS superfluid
decreasing monotonically as the SOC strength increasing, the topological
superfluid region shows a dome with the SOC strength increasing. An optimal
region in the phase diagram to find the topological superfluid can be found,
which is important to realize the topological superfluid in optical lattice
experimentally. Then we obtain the change of both band structure and density of
states (DOS) during the topological phase transition, and explain the four
peaks of DOS in the topological superfluid by the topology change of the
low-energy branch of quasiparticle energy spectra. Moreover, the topological
superfluid can be suppressed by the doping concentration.

<h3>On Topology of the Moduli Space of Gapped Hamiltonians for Topological  Phases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16535" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16535</a>

The moduli space of gapped Hamiltonians that are in the same topological
phase is an intrinsic object that is associated to the topological order. The
topology of these moduli spaces is used recently in the construction of Floquet
codes. We propose a systematical program to study the topology of these moduli
spaces. In particular, we use effective field theory to study the cohomology
classes of these spaces, which includes and generalizes the Berry phase. We
discuss several applications to studying phase transitions. We show that
nontrivial family of gapped systems with the same topological order can protect
isolated phase transitions in the phase diagram, and we argue that the phase
transitions are characterized by screening of topological defects. We argue
that family of gapped systems obey a version of bulk-boundary correspondence.
We show that family of gapped systems in the bulk with the same topological
order can rule out family of gapped systems on the boundary with the same
topological boundary condition, constraining phase transitions on the boundary.

<h3>Flat bands, quantum Hall effect and superconductivity in twisted bilayer  graphene at magic angles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16568" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16568</a>
<br>
<i>Leonardo A. Navarro-Labastida, Gerardo G. Naumis</i>
<br>
<br>
Flat band electronic modes are responsible for superconductivity in twisted
bilayer graphene (TBG) rotated at magic angles. From there other magic angles
can be found for any multilayered twisted graphene systems. Eventually, this
lead to the discovery of the highest ever known electron-electron correlated
material. Moreover, the quantum phase diagram of TBG is akin to those observed
among high-$T_{c}$ superconductors and thus there is a huge research effort to
understand TBG in the hope of clarifying the physics behind such strong
correlations. A particularity of the TBG is the coexistence of
superconductivity and the fractional Quantum Hall effect, yet this relationship
is not understood. In this work, a simple $2\times 2$ matrix model for TBG is
introduced. It contains the magic angles and due to the intrinsic chiral
symmetry in TBG, a lowest energy level related to the quantum Hall effect. The
non-Abelian properties of this Hamiltonian play a central role in the
electronic localization to produce the flat bands and here it is proved that
the squared Hamiltonian of the chiral TBG model is equivalent to a single
electron Hamiltonian inside of a non-Abelian pseudo-magnetic field produced by
electrons in other layers. Therefore, the basic and fundamental elements in the
physics of magic angles are determined. In particular, a study is made on these
fundamental energy contributions at the $\Gamma$-point due to its relation to
the recurrence of magic angles and its relationship with the Quantum Hall
effect.

<h3>Physics-Based Machine Learning Approach for Modeling the  Temperature-Dependent Yield Strength of Superalloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16576" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16576</a>

In the pursuit of developing high-temperature alloys with improved properties
for meeting the performance requirements of next-generation energy and
aerospace demands, integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) has
played a crucial role. In this paper a machine learning (ML) approach is
presented, capable of predicting the temperature-dependent yield strengths of
superalloys, utilizing a bilinear log model. Importantly, the model introduces
the parameter break temperature, $T_{break}$, which serves as an upper boundary
for operating conditions, ensuring acceptable mechanical performance. In
contrast to conventional black-box approaches, our model is based on the
underlying fundamental physics, directly built into the model. We present a
technique of global optimization, one allowing the concurrent optimization of
model parameters over the low-temperature and high-temperature regimes. The
results presented extend previous work on high-entropy alloys (HEAs) and offer
further support for the bilinear log model and its applicability for modeling
the temperature-dependent strength behavior of superalloys as well as HEAs.

<h3>Random Bitstream Generation using Voltage-Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy  and Spin Orbit Torque Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</h3>

<br>
<br>
Probabilistic computing using random number generators (RNGs) can leverage
the inherent stochasticity of nanodevices for system-level benefits. The
magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) has been studied as an RNG due to its
thermally-driven magnetization dynamics, often using spin transfer torque (STT)
current amplitude to control the random switching of the MTJ free layer
magnetization, here called the stochastic write method. There are additional
knobs to control the MTJ-RNG, including voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy
(VCMA) and spin orbit torque (SOT), and there is need to systematically study
and compared these methods. We build an analytical model of the MTJ to
characterize using VCMA and SOT to generate random bit streams. The results
show that both methods produce high quality, uniformly distributed bitstreams.
Biasing the bitstreams using either STT current or an applied magnetic field
shows an approximately sigmoidal distribution vs. bias amplitude for both VCMA
and SOT, compared to less sigmoidal for stochastic write for the same
conditions. The energy consumption per sample is calculated to be 0.1 pJ (SOT),
1 pJ (stochastic write), and 20 pJ (VCMA), revealing the potential energy
benefit of using SOT and showing using VCMA may require higher damping
materials. The generated bitstreams are then applied to two example tasks:
generating an arbitrary probability distribution using the Hidden Correlation
Bernoulli Coins method and using the MTJ-RNGs as stochastic neurons to perform
simulated annealing in a Boltzmann machine, where both VCMA and SOT methods
show the ability to effectively minimize the system energy with small delay and
low energy. These results show the flexibility of the MTJ as a true RNG and
elucidate design parameters for optimizing the device operation for
applications.

<h3>Structural evolution of the kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ =  K, Rb, and Cs) through charge density wave order</h3>

<br>
<br>
The kagome superconductors KV$_3$Sb$_5$, RbV$_3$Sb$_5$, and CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ are
known to display charge density wave (CDW) order which impacts the topological
characteristics of their electronic structure. Details of their structural
ground states and how they evolve with temperature are revealed here using
single crystal X-ray crystallographic refinements as a function of temperature,
carried out with synchrotron radiation. The compounds KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and
RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ present 2$\times$2$\times$2 superstructures in the $Fmmm$ space
group with a staggered tri-hexagonal deformation of vanadium layers.
CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ displays more complex structural evolution, whose details have
been unravelled by applying machine learning methods to the scattering data.
Upon cooling through the CDW transition, CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ displays a staged
progression of ordering from a 2$\times$2$\times$1 supercell and a
2$\times$2$\times$2 supercell into a final 2$\times$2$\times$4 supercell that
persists to $T$ = 11 K and exhibits an average structure where vanadium layers
display both tri-hexagonal and Star of David patterns of deformations.
Diffraction from CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ under pulsed magnetic fields up to $\mu_0H$ = 28
T suggest the real component of the CDW state is insensitive to external
magnetic fields.

<h3>From spin liquid to magnetic ordering in the anisotropic kagome  Y-Kapellasite Y3Cu9(OH)19Cl8: a single crystal study</h3>

<br>
<br>
Y3Cu9(OH)19Cl8 realizes an original anisotropic kagome model hosting a rich
magnetic phase diagram [M. Hering et al, npj Computational Materials 8, 1
(2022)]. We present an improved synthesis of large phase-pure single crystals
via an external gradient method. These crystals were investigated in details by
susceptibility, specific heat, thermal expansion, neutron scattering and local
muSR and NMR techniques. At variance with polycristalline samples, the study of
single crystals gives evidence for subtle structural instabilities at 33K and
13K which preserve the global symmetry of the system and thus the magnetic
model. At 2.1K the compound shows a magnetic transition to a coplanar (1/3,1/3)
long range order as predicted theoretically. However our analysis of the spin
wave excitations yields magnetic interactions which locate the compound closer
to the phase boundary to a classical jammed spin liquid phase. Enhanced quantum
fluctuations at this boundary may be responsible for the strongly reduced
ordered moment of the Cu2+, estimated to be 0.075muB from muSR.

<br>
<br>
We investigate the electronic transport properties of copper-graphene
composites using a density-functional framework. Conduction in composites by
varying the interface distance of a copper/graphene/copper (Cu/G/Cu) interface
models was studied. The electronic density of states reveals increasing
contributions from both copper and carbon atoms near the Fermi level with
decreasing Cu-G interfacial distance. Electronic conductivity of the models
computed using the Kubo-Greenwood formula showed the conductivity increases
with decreasing Cu-G distance. We also find that the conductivity saturates
below a threshold Cu-G distance. By computing the space-projected conductivity
of the Cu/G/Cu models, we show that the graphene forms a bridge to the
electronic conduction at small copper-graphene distances, thereby enhancing the
conductivity.

<h3>Supercurrent-induced Anomalous Thermal Hall Effect as a New Probe to  Superconducting Gap Anisotropy</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16651" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16651</a>

<br>

Two-dimensional superconductors have been realized in various atomically thin
films, some of which are anticipated to involve unconventional pairing
mechanisms, including twisted bilayer graphene. Due to the low dimensionality,
experimental probes of the superconductivity in these systems have been
limited. In this paper we consider a Josephson junction formed by stacking two
atomically thin films, and propose an anomalous thermal Hall effect induced by
the Josephson supercurrent, in the absence of an external magnetic field. We
find that this effect can be significant, and interestingly, it sharply probes
the \emph{in-plane} anisotropy of the superconducting gap function
$\varDelta_{\boldsymbol{k}}$, which may be useful in experimental
investigations on two-dimensional superconductivity.

<h3>Quantum light from lossy semiconductor Rydberg excitons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16658" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16658</a>
<br>
<i>Valentin Walther, Anders S. Sørensen</i>
<br>
<br>
The emergence of photonic quantum correlations is typically associated with
emitters strongly coupled to a photonic mode. Here, we show that semiconductor
Rydberg excitons, which are only weakly coupled to a free-space light mode can
produce strongly antibunched fields, i.e. quantum light. This effect is fueled
by micron-scale excitation blockade between Rydberg excitons inducing pair-wise
polariton scattering events. Photons incident on an exciton resonance are
scatted into blue- and red-detuned pairs, which enjoy relative protection from
absorption and thus dominate the transmitted light. We demonstrate that this
effect persists in the presence of additional phonon coupling, strong
non-radiative decay and across a wide range of experimental parameters. Our
results pave the way for the observation of quantum statistics from weakly
coupled semiconductor excitons.

<h3>Capturing long-range interaction with reciprocal space neural network</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16684" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16684</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Machine Learning (ML) interatomic models and potentials have been widely
employed in simulations of materials. Long-range interactions often dominate in
some ionic systems whose dynamics behavior is significantly influenced.
However, the long-range effect such as Coulomb and Van der Wales potential is
not considered in most ML interatomic potentials. To address this issue, we put
forward a method that can take long-range effects into account for most ML
local interatomic models with the reciprocal space neural network. The
structure information in real space is firstly transformed into reciprocal
space and then encoded into a reciprocal space potential or a global descriptor
with full atomic interactions. The reciprocal space potential and descriptor
keep full invariance of Euclidean symmetry and choice of the cell. Benefiting
from the reciprocal-space information, ML interatomic models can be extended to
describe the long-range potential including not only Coulomb but any other
long-range interaction. A model NaCl system considering Coulomb interaction and
the GaxNy system with defects are applied to illustrate the advantage of our
approach. At the same time, our approach helps to improve the prediction
accuracy of some global properties such as the band gap where the full atomic
interaction beyond local atomic environments plays a very important role. In
summary, our work has expanded the ability of current ML interatomic models and
potentials when dealing with the long-range effect, hence paving a new way for
accurate prediction of global properties and large-scale dynamic simulations of
systems with defects.

<h3>High-Throughput $\textit{Ab Initio}$ Design of Atomic Interfaces using  InterMatch</h3>

<br>
<br>
Forming a hetero-interface is a materials-design strategy that can access an
astronomically large phase space. However, the immense phase space necessitates
a high-throughput approach for optimal interface design. Here we introduce a
high-throughput computational framework, InterMatch, for efficiently predicting
charge transfer, strain, and superlattice structure of an interface by
leveraging the databases of individual bulk materials. Specifically, the
algorithm reads in the lattice vectors, density of states, and the stiffness
tensors for each material in their isolated form from the Materials Project.
From these bulk properties, InterMatch estimates the interfacial properties. We
benchmark InterMatch predictions for the charge transfer against experimental
measurements and supercell density-functional theory calculations. We then use
InterMatch to predict promising interface candidates for doping transition
metal dichalcogenide MoSe$_2$. Finally, we explain experimental observation of
factor of 10 variation in the supercell periodicity within a few microns in
graphene/$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ by exploring low energy superlattice structures as a
function of twist angle using InterMatch. We anticipate our open-source
InterMatch algorithm accelerating and guiding ever-growing interfacial design
efforts. Moreover, the interface database resulting from the InterMatch
searches presented in this paper can be readily accessed through

<h3>Electronic Origin of Half-metal to Semiconductor Transition and Colossal  Magnetoresistance in Spinel HgCr2Se4</h3>

<br>
<br>
Half-metals are ferromagnets hosting spin-polarized conducting carriers and
crucial for spintronics applications. The chromium spinel HgCr2Se4 represents a
unique type of half-metal, which features a half-metal to semiconductor
transition (HMST) and exhibits colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) across the
ferromagnetic-paramagnetic (FM-PM) transition. Using angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we find that the Fermi surface of n-type
HgCr2Se4 (n-HgCr2Se4) consists of a single electron pocket which moves above
the Fermi level (EF) upon the FM-PM transition, leading to the HMST. Such a
Lifshitz transition manifests a giant band splitting which originates from the
exchange interaction unveiled with a specific chemical nonstoichiometry. The
exchange band splitting and the chemical nonstoichiometry are two key
ingredients to the HMST and CMR, consistent with our ab-initio calculation. Our
findings provide spectroscopic evidences of the electronic origin of the
anomalous properties of HgCr2Se4, which address the unique phase transition in
half-metals.

<h3>ACFlow: An open source toolkit for analytical continuation of quantum  Monte Carlo data</h3>

The purpose of analytical continuation is to establish a real frequency
spectral representation of single-particle or two-particle correlation function
(such as Green's function, self-energy function, and dynamical
susceptibilities) from noisy data generated in finite temperature quantum Monte
Carlo simulations. It requires numerical solutions of a family of Fredholm
integral equations of the first kind, which is indeed a challenging task. In
this paper, an open source toolkit (dubbed ACFlow) for analytical continuation
of quantum Monte Carlo data is presented. We at first give a short introduction
to the analytical continuation problem. Next, three primary analytical
continuation algorithms, including maximum entropy method, stochastic
analytical continuation, and stochastic optimization method, as implemented in
this toolkit are reviewed. And then we elaborate major features, implementation
details, and basic usage of this toolkit. Finally, four representative examples
are shown to demonstrate usefulness and flexibility of the ACFlow toolkit.

<h3>Anomalous temperature evolution of the Dirac band in ZrTe$_5$ across  topological phase transition</h3>

<br>
<br>
Characteristic features of topological phase transition (TPT) in solid-state
materials usually compose of a non-monotonic band gap evolution across the
parameter space and a gap closure at the transition point. Here, using
semiconducting zirconium pentatelluride (ZrTe5) and magneto-infrared
spectroscopy, we identify a TPT from a strong topological insulator (TI) to a
weak TI with increasing temperatures, but the band gap exhibits different
behavior. Specifically, we find that the bandgap in ZrTe5 does not fully close
at the TPT, and it becomes temperature independent at lower temperatures. Our
observations can be explained by considering the effect of conduction-valence
band mixing and band inversion in the strong TI phase of ZrTe5 at low
temperatures.

<h3>Transport in honeycomb lattice with random $π$-fluxes</h3>

<i>Zekun Zhuang</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the transport problems in the Kitaev-type spin liquids, we
consider a nearest-neighbor tight-binding model on the honeycomb lattice in the
presence of random uncorrelated $\pi$-fluxes. We employ different numerical
methods to study its transport properties near half-filling. Using the Landauer
approach, we calculate the zero-temperature DC conductivity away from the Dirac
point, which is quadratic in Fermi momentum and inversely proportional to the
flux density. The conductivity shows a negative logarithmic dependence on the
system size, consistent with the weak localization theory for the orthogonal
universality class. By computing the Lyapunov exponent with the transfer matrix
method, we extract the two-dimensional localization length near the Dirac
point, which suggests possible strong localization near the Dirac point for
realistic system size.

<h3>Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear Study of a Colloidal Gel at the  Critical State</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16724" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16724</a>
<br>
<i>Khushboo Suman, Sachin Shanbhag, Yogesh M. Joshi</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of a colloidal dispersion
at the critical gel state using large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS)
rheology. The colloidal gel at the critical point is subjected to oscillatory
shear flow with increasing strain amplitude at different frequencies. We
observe that the first harmonic of the elastic and viscous moduli exhibits a
monotonic decrease as the material undergoes a linear to nonlinear transition.
We analyze the stress waveform across this transition and obtain the nonlinear
moduli and viscosity as a function of frequency and strain amplitude. The
analysis of the nonlinear moduli and viscosities suggests intracycle strain
stiffening and intracycle shear thinning in the colloidal dispersion. Based on
the insights obtained from the nonlinear analysis, we propose a potential
scenario of the microstructural changes occurring in the nonlinear region. We
also develop an integral model using the time-strain separable K-BKZ
constitutive equation with a power-law relaxation modulus and damping function
obtained from experiments. At low strain amplitudes, this model compares well
with experimental data at all frequencies. However, a stronger damping
function, which can be efficiently inferred using a spectral method, is
required to obtain quantitative fits across the entire range of strain
amplitudes and the explored frequencies.

<h3>Spin-polarized antichiral exciton-polariton edge states</h3>

<i>Ruiqi Bao, S. Mandal, Huawen Xu, Xingran Xu, R. Banerjee, Timothy C. H. Liew</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider theoretically a system of exciton-polariton micropillars arranged
in a honeycomb lattice. The naturally present TE-TM splitting and an
alternating Zeeman splitting, where the different sublattices experience
opposite Zeeman splitting, shifts the Dirac points in energy, giving rise to
antichiral behavior. In a strip geometry having zigzag edges, two pairs of edge
states exist and propagate in the same direction (including the states at the
opposite edges). The edge modes localized at the opposite edges have opposite
spins (circular polarizations), which leads to co-propagating "+-" spin
channels. The antichiral edge states are protected by non-zero winding numbers
and can propagate around a 60 degree bend without being reflected. We further
compare the transport properties of these edge states with chiral edge modes
and propose a scheme to realize them experimentally.

We investigate the physical properties of a single crystal of uranium
telluride U$_{7}$Te$_{12}$. We have confirmed that U$_{7}$Te$_{12}$
crystallizes in the hexagonal structure with three nonequivalent
crystallographic uranium sites. The paramagnetic moments are estimated to be
approximately 1 $\mu_{\rm B}$ per the uranium site, assuming a uniform moment
on all the sites. A ferromagnetic phase transition occurs at $T_{\rm C}=48$ K,
where the in-plane magnetization increases sharply, whereas the out-of-plane
component does not increase significantly. With decreasing temperature further
below $T_{\rm C}$ under field-cooling conditions, the out-of-plane component
increases rapidly around $T^{\star}=26$ K. In contrast, the in-plane component
hardly changes at $T^{\star}$. Specific heat measurement indicates no
$\lambda$-type anomaly around $T^{\star}$, so this is a cross-over suggesting a
reorientation of the ordering moments or successive magnetic ordering on the
part of the multiple uranium sites.

<h3>NMR evidence for a Peierls transition in the layered square-net compound  LaAgSb$_2$</h3>

<br>
We measured the central ($1/2\leftrightarrow -1/2$) and first satellite
($\pm3/2\leftrightarrow \pm1/2$) lines of the \la\ NMR spectra as a function of
temperature in LaAgSb$_2$, in order to elucidate the origin and nature of the
charge-density-wave (CDW) transitions at $T_\text{CDW1}=207$ K and
$T_\text{CDW2}=186$ K. In the normal state, the Knight shift K reveals a fairly
linear relationship with decreasing temperature, which is ascribed to a
pseudogap in the spin excitation spectrum, pointing towards the material being
an unconventional metal. Upon further cooling, K decreases more steeply below
$T_\text{CDW1}$, indicative of the partial Fermi surface gap opening on top of
the pseudogap. The most remarkable finding in our study is a clear splitting of
the satellite lines at $T_\text{CDW1}$ observed for $H\parallel c$, whose
temperature dependence behaves as the BCS order parameter in the weak-coupling
limit, evidencing that the CDW transition induces the periodic lattice
distortion. Our NMR findings therefore demonstrate that the CDW transition in
LaAgSb$_2$ is of Peierls type, being driven by the electronic instability in
the vicinity of the Fermi level.

Spintronic THz emitters (STE) are efficient THz sources constructed using
thin heavy-metal (HM) and ferromagnetic-metal (FM) layers. To improve the
performance of the STE, different structuring methods (trilayers, stacked
bilayers) have been experimentally applied. A theoretical description of the
overall THz emission process is necessary to optimize the efficiency of STE. In
particular, geometry, composition, pump laser frequency, and spin diffusion
will be significant in understanding the pathways for further research
developments. This work will apply a generalized model based on a modified
Transfer Matrix Method (TMM). We will consider the spin generation and
diffusion in the FM and HM layers and explain the spintronic THz emission
process. This model is suitable for calculating emitted THz signal as a
function of FM and HM thicknesses for different geometrical configurations. We
will investigate a bilayer geometry as a test case, but the extension to a
multi-layer configuration is straightforward. We will show how the different
configurations of the sample will influence the THz emission amplitude.

Despite the rapid development of powerful supercomputers in recent years, the
human brain still has some abilities that outperform modern computers which are
based on the von Neumann architecture. The human brain is much more energy
efficient than state-of-the-art digital computers and can at the same time
perform complex tasks such as pattern recognition. The brain-inspired
neuromorphic computing paradigm is a promising path towards next generation
analogue computers with fundamentally different architecture. The building
blocks of the human brain are neurons with leaky integrate-and-fire mechanisms.
In this work, using the advantage of antiferromagnetic insulators, we propose a
non-volatile spintronic-based neuron. In our proposal, an antiferromagnetic
domain wall in the presence of a magnetic anisotropy gradient mimics a
biological neuron with leaky and integrative properties. This single neuron is
controlled by polarized antiferromagnetic magnons, activated by either a
magnetic field pulse or a spin transfer torque mechanism. We propose that this
single neuron, based on antiferromagnetic insulators, is faster and more energy
efficient than other metallic ferromagnetic-based neurons.

Multiferroics have found renewed interest in topological magnetism and for
logic-in-memory applications. Among them, SrMnO$_{3}$, possessing strong
magnetoelectric coupling is gaining attention for the design of coexisting
magnetic and polar orders upon straining. Here we demonstrate antiferromagnetic
exchange interactions in strained SMO thin films extracted from a new feature
in the phase response of Spin Hall magnetoresistance, which has not been
explored in earlier works, such as in magnetic insulators. We explain our
findings with a model that incorporates magnetic anisotropy along [110]
direction, corroborates with DFT studies and is consistent with the direction
of ferroelectric polarization in SrMnO$_{3}$. The fundamental insights obtained
from our studies establishes the potential of this material in
magnetoelectrically coupled devices for different logic and memory
applications.

The recent observed anomalous Hall effect in magic angle twisted bilayer
graphene (TBG) aligned to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and unconventional
ferroelectricity in Bernal bilayer graphene sandwiched by hBN present a new
platform to tune the correlated properties in graphene systems. In these
graphene-based moir\'e superlattices, the aligned hBN substrate plays an
important role. In this paper, we analyze the effects of hBN substrate on the
band structure of the TBG. By means of an atomistic tight-binding model we
calculate the electronic properties of TBG suspended and encapsulated with hBN.
Interestingly, we found that the physical properties of TBG are extremely
sensitive to the presence of hBN and they may be completely different if TBG is
suspended or encapsulated. We quantify these differences by analysing their
electronic properties, optical conductivity and band topology. We found that
the narrow bandwidth, band gap, local density of states and optical
conductivity are significantly modified by the aligned hBN substrates.
Interestingly, these electronic properties can be used as a signature of the
alignment in experiment. Moreover, the TBG/hBN superlattices in the presence or
absence of the two-fold rotation symmetry response differently to the external
electric field. For the TBG suspended in the hBN, application of an electric
field results in the charge unevenly distributed between graphene layers, which
can be used to tune the strength of the valley Hall effect or the anomalous
Hall effect. Such rich topological phase diagram in these systems may be useful
for experiments.

An accurate knowledge of the lattice parameters of the new nitride
Sc$_\textit{x}$Al$_\textit{1-x}$N is essential for understanding the elastic
and piezoelectric properties of this compound as well as for the ability to
engineer its strain state in heterostructures. Using high-resolution x-ray
diffractometry, we determine the lattice parameters of 100-nm-thick undoped
Sc$_\textit{x}$Al$_\textit{1-x}$N layers grown on GaN(0001) templates by
plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. The Sc content $\textit{x}$ of the
layers is measured independently by both x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and
energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and ranges from 0 to 0.25. The in-plane
lattice parameter of the layers linearly increases with increasing
$\textit{x}$, while their out-of-plane lattice parameter remains constant.
Layers with $\textit{x}$ $\approx$ 0.09 are found to be lattice matched to GaN,
resulting in a smooth surface and a structural perfection equivalent to that of
the GaN underlayer. In addition, a two-dimensional electron gas is induced at
the Sc$_\textit{x}$Al$_\textit{1-x}$N/GaN heterointerface, with the highest
sheet electron density and mobility observed for lattice-matched conditions.

The phase of the quantum-mechanical wave function can encode a topological
structure with wide-ranging physical consequences, such as anomalous transport
effects and the existence of edge states robust against perturbations. While
this has been exhaustively demonstrated for electrons, properties associated
with the elementary quasiparticles in magnetic materials are still
underexplored. Here, we show theoretically and via inelastic neutron scattering
experiments that the bulk ferromagnet Mn$_5$Ge$_3$ hosts gapped topological
Dirac magnons. Although inversion symmetry prohibits a net
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in the unit cell, it is locally allowed and
is responsible for the gap opening in the magnon spectrum. This gap is
predicted and experimentally verified to close by rotating the magnetization
away from the $c$-axis. Hence, Mn$_5$Ge$_3$ is the first realization of a
gapped Dirac magnon material in three dimensions. Its tunability by chemical
doping or by thin film nanostructuring defines an exciting new platform to
explore and design topological magnons.

Synthetic methods to control the structure of materials at sub-micron scales
are typically based on the self-assembly of structural building blocks with
precise size and morphology. On the other hand, many living systems can
generate structure across a broad range of length scales in one step directly
from macromolecules, using phase separation. Here, we introduce and control
structure at the nano- and microscales through polymerization in the solid
state, which has the unusual capability of both triggering and arresting phase
separation. In particular, we show that atom transfer radical polymerization
(ATRP) enables control of nucleation, growth, and stabilization of
phase-separated poly-methylmethacrylate (PMMA) domains in a solid polystyrene
(PS) matrix. ATRP yields durable nanostructures with low size dispersity and
high degrees of structural correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
length scale of these materials is controlled by the synthesis parameters.

We investigate the ground state of the spin $S=1/2$ Heisenberg
anti-ferromagnet on the Shuriken lattice, also in the presence of an external
magnetic field. To this end, we employ two-dimensional tensor network
techniques based on infinite projected entangled pair and simplex states
considering states with different sizes of the unit cells. We show that a
valence bond crystal with resonances over length six loops emerges as the
ground state (at any given finite bond dimension) yielding the lowest reported
estimate of the ground state energy $E_0/J = -0.4410 \pm 0.0001$ for this
model, estimated in the thermodynamic limit. We also study the model in the
presence of an external magnetic field and find the emergence of $0$, $1/3$ and
$2/3$ magnetization plateaus with states respecting translation and point group
symmetries, that feature loop-four plaquette resonances instead.

<br>
As a candidate Kitaev material, Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ exhibits intriguing
magnetism on a honeycomb lattice that is believed to be $C_3$-symmetric. Here
we report a neutron diffraction study of high quality single crystals under
$a$-axis magnetic fields. Our data support the less common notion of a magnetic
ground state that corresponds to a triple-$\mathbf{q}$ magnetic structure with
$C_3$ symmetry, rather than the multi-domain zigzag structure typically assumed
in prototype Kitaev spin liquid candidates. In particular, we find that the
field is unable to repopulate the supposed zigzag domains, where the only
alternative explanation is that the domains are strongly pinned by hitherto
unidentified structural reasons. If the triple-$\mathbf{q}$ structure is
correct then this requires reevaluation of many candidate Kitaev materials. We
also find that fields beyond about 10 Tesla suppress the long range
antiferromagnetic order, allowing new magnetic behavior to emerge different
from that expected for a spin liquid.

<br>
Magnetic-field-resilient superconducting coplanar waveguide (SCPW) resonators
are essential for developing integrated quantum circuits of various qubits and
quantum memory devices. Molybdenum-Rhenium (MoRe), which is a disordered
superconducting alloy forming a highly transparent contact to the graphene and
carbon nanotubes (CNTs), would be a promising platform for realizing the
field-resilient SCPW resonators combined with graphene- and CNT-based
nano-hybrid qubits. We fabricated MoRe SCPW resonators and investigated their
microwave transmission characteristics with varying temperature and external
magnetic field. Our observations show that the thickness of MoRe film is a
critical parameter determining the lower critical field, kinetic inductance,
and characteristic impedance of the SCPW resonator, resulting in drastic
changes in the quality factor and the resonance frequency. As a result, we
obtained a maximum value of $Q_{i} > 10^{4}$ in parallel magnetic fields up to
$B_{||} = 0.15$ T for the 27-nm-thick MoRe resonator. Our experimental results
suggest that MoRe SCPW resonator would be useful for integrating nano-hybrid
spin or gatemon qubits and for developing spin-ensemble quantum memory devices.

<h3>The evaporation of concentrated polymer solutions is insensitive to  relative humidity</h3>

A recent theory suggests that the evaporation kinetics of macromolecular
solutions may be insensitive to the ambient relative humidity (RH) due to the
formation of a `polarisation layer' of solutes at the air-solution interface.
We study the evaporation of polyvinyl alcohol solutions from an open-ended
capillary, and find RH-insensitive evaporation up to RH~$\approx 85\%$. We also
confirm the predicted decrease in evaporation rate over time. However,
RH-insensitive evaporation sets in earlier than predicted by theory, suggesting
additional polymer-interface interactions. We discuss the relevance of these
observations for respiratory virus transmission via aerosols.

<h3>Triple-Q order in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ from proximity to  hidden-SU(2)-symmetric point</h3>

<br>
<br>
In extended Heisenberg-Kitaev-Gamma-type spin models, hidden-SU(2)-symmetric
points are isolated points in parameter space that can be mapped to pure
Heisenberg models via nontrivial duality transformations. Such points
generically feature quantum degeneracy between conventional single-Q and exotic
multi-Q states. We argue that recent single-crystal inelastic neutron
scattering data place the honeycomb magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ in proximity to
such a hidden-SU(2)-symmetric point. The low-temperature order is identified as
a triple-Q state arising from the N\'eel antiferromagnet with staggered
magnetization in the out-of-plane direction via a 4-sublattice duality
transformation. This state naturally explains various distinctive features of
the magnetic excitation spectrum, including its surprisingly high symmetry and
the dispersive low-energy and flat high-energy bands. Our result demonstrates
the importance of bond-dependent exchange interactions in cobaltates, and
illustrates the intriguing magnetic behavior resulting from them.

Modification of interatomic distances due to high pressure leads to exotic
phenomena, including metallicity, superconductivity and magnetism, observed in
materials not showing such properties in normal conditions. In two-dimensional
crystals, such as graphene, atomic bond lengths can be modified by more that 10
percent by applying in-plane strain, i.e., without generating high pressure in
the bulk. In this work, we study the strain-induced Mott transition on
a~honeycomb lattice by using computationally inexpensive techniques, including
Gutzwiller Wave Function (GWF) and Coherent Potential Approximation (CPA),
which provide the lower and upper bounds for critical Hubbard repulsion ($U$)
of electrons. For uniaxial strain in the armchair direction the band gap is
absent, and electron correlations play a~dominant role. A significant reduction
of the critical Hubbard $U$ is predicted. Model considerations are mapped onto
tight-binding Hamiltonian for monolayer graphene by the auxiliary
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model for acoustic phonons, assuming zero stress in the
direction perpendicular to the strain applied. Our results suggest that
graphene, although staying in semimetallic phase even for extremely high
uniaxial strains, may enter the so-called correlated semimetal phase, in which
the Hartree-Fock description is insufficient and considerable renormalization
of measurable quantities appears.

The vertex model of confluent epithelia describes the apical surface of a
tissue as a tiling of polygonal cells, with a mechanical energy governed by
deviations in cell shape from preferred $A_0$, and perimeter, $P_0$. Even in
the absence of topological rearrangements, the model exhibits a solid-solid
rigidity transition driven by geometric incompatibility and tuned by the target
shape index of the cell, $p_0 = P_0 / \sqrt{A_0}$. For $p_0 > p_*(6) = \sqrt{8
\sqrt{3}} \approx 3.72$, with $p_*(6)$ the perimeter of a regular hexagon of
unit area, a cell can simultaneously attain both the preferred area and
perimeter. As a result, the tissue is in a mechanically soft compatible state,
with a manifold of degenerate zero-energy states and zero shear and Young's
moduli. For $p_0 < p_*(6)$, it is geometrically impossible for any cell to
realize the preferred area and perimeter simultaneously, and the tissue is in
an incompatible rigid solid state. Using a mean-field approach, we present a
complete analytical calculation of both the ground states and the linear
elastic moduli of an ordered vertex model. In addition to the standard affine
transformations, we analyze a relaxation step that allows for non-affine
deformations, leading to a softening of the system. The origin of the vanishing
shear and Young's moduli in the compatible state is the presence of zero-energy
deformations of cell shape within the manifold of degenerate ground states. The
bulk modulus exhibits a jump discontinuity at the transition and, for some
parameters, can be lower in the rigid state than in the fluid-like state. The
Poisson ratio becomes negative at small $p_0$ and intermediate contractility,
which lowers the bulk and Young's moduli. Our work provides a unified treatment
of linear elasticity for the vertex model and demonstrates that this linear
response is protocol-dependent.

<br>
Extensive studies of electron transport in Dirac materials have shown
positive magneto-resistance (MR) and positive magneto-thermopower (MTP) in a
magnetic field perpendicular to the excitation current or thermal gradient. In
contrast, measurements of electron transport often show a negative longitudinal
MR and negative MTP for a magnetic field oriented along the excitation current
or thermal gradient; this is attributed to the chiral anomaly in Dirac
materials. Here, we report a very different magneto-thermoelectric transport
behavior in the massive Dirac material ZrTe5. Although thin flakes show a
commonly observed positive MR in a perpendicular magnetic field, distinct from
other Dirac materials, we observe a sharp negative MTP. In a parallel magnetic
field, we still observe a negative longitudinal MR, however, a remarkable
positive MTP is observed for the fields parallel to the thermal gradients. Our
theoretical calculations suggest that this anomalous magneto-thermoelectric
behavior can be attributed to the screened Coulomb scattering. This work
demonstrates the significance of impurity scattering in the electron transport
of topological materials and provides deep insight into the novel
magneto-transport phenomena in Dirac materials.

Irreversibility is commonly quantified by entropy production. An external
observer can estimate it through measuring an observable that is antisymmetric
under time-reversal like a current. We introduce a general framework that,
inter alia, allows us to infer a lower bound on entropy production through
measuring the time-resolved statistics of events with any symmetry under
time-reversal, in particular, time-symmetric instantaneous events. We emphasize
Markovianity as a property of certain events rather than of the full system and
introduce an operationally accessible criterion for this weakened Markov
property. Conceptually, the approach is based on snippets as particular
sections of trajectories, for which a generalized detailed balance relation is
discussed.

Quantum metrology that employs weak-values can potentially effectuate
parameter estimation with an ultra-high sensitivity and has been typically
explored across quantum optics setups. Recognizing the importance of sensitive
parameter estimation in the solid-state, we propose a spintronic device
platform to realize this. The setup estimates a very weak localized Zeeman
splitting by exploiting a resonant tunneling enhanced magnetoresistance
readout. We establish that this paradigm offers nearly optimal performance with
a quantum Fisher information enhancement of about $10^4$ times that of single
high-transmissivity barriers. The obtained signal also offers a high
sensitivity in the presence of dephasing effects typically encountered in the
solid state. These results put forth definitive possibilities in harnessing the
inherent sensitivity of resonant tunneling for solid-state quantum metrology
with potential applications, especially, in the sensitive detection of small
induced Zeeman effects in quantum material heterostructures.

<br>
<br>
The propagation of chirality across scales is a common but poorly understood
phenomenon in soft matter. In this work, we use computer simulations to study
chiral monolayer assemblies formed by hard rod-like colloidal particles in the
presence of non-adsorbing polymer and characterize the thermodynamic driving
forces responsible for the twisting. Simulations show that straight (achiral)
rods assemble into monolayers with a spontaneous twist that is either left- or
right-handed, while helical (chiral) rods lead to assemblies with preferential
chiral features that depend on their handedness and curliness. The onset of
chirality in these monolayers can be traced back to small clusters formed at
the initial stage of the self-assembly. In these microscopic monolayers,
entropy drives twisting in ways that differ from the assumptions on which
existing continuum theory is built. Depending on the geometry of the
constituent rods, the preferred chiral twist can be driven by entropy gain of
the polymers, or of the rods, or both. In addition, the variation of the
polymer entropy with twist depends on changes in both the surface area and the
volume of the monolayer. Rod fluctuations perpendicular to the monolayer also
play an important role in stabilising the twisting.

Frenkel polaritons, hybrid light-matter quasiparticles, offer promises for
the designing of new opto-electronic devices. However, their technological
implementations are hindered by sensitivity to imperfections. Topology has
raised as a way to circumvent defects and fabrication limitations. Here, we
propose a lattice of cavities to realize the one-dimensional
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model (SSH) for topological Frenkel polaritons. By
engineering the configuration of the cavities we demonstrate that the SSH
topological and trivial phases can be accessed, which we unravel by
complementary classical and quantum theories. We demonstrate the polariton edge
state robustness under defects and the broadening of the photon and exciton
lines. Our findings propose a realistic yet simple experimental setup to
realize topological room temperature polaritons.

The different superfluid phases of $^3$He break several symmetries. The
resulting $p$-wave order parameters include anisotropy axes both in the orbital
and spin spaces, characterizing those broken symmetries. The free energy has
several degenerate minima for certain orientations of anisotropy axes and
spatial variation of the order parameter between two such regions, settled in
different energy minima, forms a topological soliton. Such solitons can
terminate in the bulk liquid, where the termination line forms a vortex with
trapped circulation of mass and spin superfluid currents. We discuss possible
soliton-vortex structures based on the symmetry and topology arguments and
focus on the three structures observed in the experiments: solitons bounded by
spin-mass vortices in the B phase, solitons bounded by half-quantum vortices in
the polar and polar-distorted A phases, and composite defect of the soliton and
the Kibble-Lazarides-Shafi wall in the polar-distorted B phase. The
observations are based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques and are
of three types: soliton can form a potential well for trapped spin waves,
observed as an extra peak in the NMR spectrum; soliton can increase relaxation
rate of the NMR spin precession; and the soliton can present the boundary
conditions for the anisotropy axes in bulk and thus modify the bulk NMR signal.
Thanks to the prominent NMR signature and the ability to manipulate the soliton
structure with external magnetic field, solitons have become an important tool
for probing and controlling the structure and dynamics of superfluid $^3$He, in
particular half-quantum vortices with core-bound Majorana modes.

Buildings are responsible for a considerable fraction of the energy wasted
globally every year, and as a result, excess carbon emissions. While heat is
lost directly in colder months and climates, resulting in increased heating
loads, in hot climates cooling and ventilation is required. One avenue towards
improving the energy efficiency of buildings is to integrate thermoelectric
devices and materials within the fabric of the building to exploit the
temperature gradient between the inside and outside to do useful work.
Cement-based materials are ubiquitous in modern buildings and present an
interesting opportunity to be functionalised. We present a systematic
investigation of the electronic transport coefficients relevant to the
thermoelectric materials of the calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) gel analogue,
tobermorite, using Density Functional Theory calculations with the Boltzmann
transport method. The calculated values of the Seebeck coefficient are within
the typical magnitude (200 - 600 $\mu V/K$) indicative of a good thermoelectric
material. The tobermorite models are predicted to be intrinsically $p$-type
thermoelectric material because of the presence of large concentration of the
Si-O tetrahedra sites. The calculated electronic $ZT$ for the tobermorite
models have their optimal values of 0.983 at (400 $\mathrm{K}$ and $10^{17}$
$\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$) for tobermorite 9 \r{A}, 0.985 at (400 $\mathrm{K}$ and
$10^{17}$ $\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$) for tobermorite 11 \r{A} and 1.20 at (225
$\mathrm{K}$ and $10^{19}$ $\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$) for tobermorite 14 \r{A},

Metals in amorphous state are promising for the use as structural materials
due to their superior properties related to the absence of grain boundaries and
dislocations.Obtaining the amorphous state requires quenching with a high
cooling rate.In conventional technologies,this is the reason for a considerable
size limitation hindering application of amorphous alloys.Additive
manufacturing (AM) is free of the size limitation.The so-called bulk metallic
glass (BMG) alloys have extremely low critical cooling rates and can be used in
AM. Recent studies on AM from Zr-based BMGs by selective laser melting(SLM)has
proved the possibility of attaining the amorphous state and revealed partial
crystallization to be the principal drawback of this process.The present work
aims to analyze the conditions for partial crystallization and try to control
it by optimizing the process parameters.A comprehensive parametric analysis is
accomplished in single-track SLM experiments with Zr-based BMG alloy Vit
106.The observed microstructures are related to the temperature fields and
thermal cycles estimated by an analytic heat-transfer model in the laser-impact
zone.In the cross section of a laser track,a central bright domain is
identified as the remelted zone.An annular darker crystallization zone
encircles the remelted zone.The model fits the experimentally obtained
dependencies of the remelted zone size versus laser power and scanning speed.It
seems that primary crystalline inclusions existing in the substrate before
laser processing dissolve at the laser melting.The mean cooling rate in the
remelted zone is much greater than the critical cooling
rate.Therefore,homogeneous nucleation isn't expected.Nevertheless,the
theoretically estimated crystallization times are sufficient for a considerable
crystal growth in the heat-affected zone where primary crystalline inclusions
and nuclei are not completely dissolved

<h3>A Rate Model of Electron Populations for Non-linear High-Fluence X-ray  Absorption Near-Edge Spectra</h3>

Absorbing a focused, femtosecond X-ray pulse from a Free-Electron Laser (FEL)
can lead to extreme electronic excitations in solids. This excitation drives
changes of the electronic system over the course of the pulse duration and the
overall absorption of the pulse becomes fluence-dependent. Thus,
fluence-dependent non-linear X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) is
sensitive to the valence excitation dynamics around the Fermi level on the
few-femtosecond timescale. Here we present a simplified rate model based on
well-established physical mechanisms to describe the evolution of the
electronic system.
We construct temporal and spatial differentials for the processes of resonant
absorption, stimulated emission, non-resonant absorption, Auger decay, valence
band thermalization and scattering cascades of free electrons.
The phenomenological rate model approach provides a direct understanding how
each physical process contributes to the fluence-dependent changes observed in
XANES measurements. Without accounting for fluence-dependent changes to the
density of states, the model shows good agreement with experimental results on
metallic nickel over more than three orders of magnitude in fluence,
establishing electron redistribution as the main driver of non-linear
absorption changes at high fluences. Although in the closest vicinity of the
resonance, more complex approaches are necessary to describe remaining
discrepancies of the fluence-dependence changes, the demonstrated capability to
describe spectral changes up to extreme fluences yields fundamental insights
into the complex dynamics after intense core excitation and provides an
important tool for the design and evaluation of future FEL experiments, in
particular for the development of non-linear X-ray spectroscopy.

<h3>Robust retrieval of dynamic sequences through interaction modulation</h3>

Many biological systems dynamically rearrange their components through a
sequence of configurations in order to perform their functions. Such dynamic
processes have been studied using network models that sequentially retrieve a
set of stored patterns. Previous models of sequential retrieval belong to a
general class in which the components of the system are controlled by a
feedback ("input modulation"). In contrast, we introduce a new class of models
in which the feedback modifies the interactions among the components
("interaction modulation"). We show that interaction modulation models are not
only capable of retrieving dynamic sequences, but they do so more robustly than
input modulation models. In particular, we find that modulation of symmetric
interactions allows retrieval of patterns with different activity levels and
has a much larger dynamic capacity. Our results suggest that interaction
modulation may be a common principle underlying biological systems that show
complex collective dynamics.

<h3>Carrier Recombination in Highly Uniform and Phase-Pure GaAs/(Al,Ga)As  Core/Shell Nanowire Arrays on Si(111): Mott Transition and Internal Quantum  Efficiency</h3>

GaAs-based nanowires are among the most promising candidates for realizing a
monolithical integration of III-V optoelectronics on the Si platform. To
realize their full potential for applications as light absorbers and emitters,
it is crucial to understand their interaction with light governing the
absorption and extraction efficiency, as well as the carrier recombination
dynamics determining the radiative efficiency. Here, we study the spontaneous
emission of zincblende GaAs/(Al,Ga)As core/shell nanowire arrays by
$\mu$-photoluminescence spectroscopy. These ordered arrays are synthesized on
patterned Si(111) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy, and exhibit an
exceptionally low degree of polytypism for interwire separations exceeding a
critical value. We record emission spectra over more than five orders of
excitation density for both steady-state and pulsed excitation to identify the
nature of the recombination channels. An abrupt Mott transition from excitonic
to electron-hole-plasma recombination is observed, and the corresponding Mott
density is derived. Combining these experiments with simulations and additional
direct measurements of the external quantum efficiency using a perfect diffuse
reflector as reference, we are able to extract the internal quantum efficiency
as a function of carrier density and temperature as well as the extraction
efficiency of the nanowire array. The results vividly document the high
potential of GaAs/(Al,Ga)As core/shell nanowires for efficient light emitters
integrated on the Si platform. Furthermore, the methodology established in this
work can be applied to nanowires of any other materials system of interest for
optoelectronic applications.

<h3>Ground-state stability and excitation spectrum of a one-dimensional  dipolar supersolid</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the behavior of the excitation spectrum across the quantum phase
transition from a superfluid to a supersolid phase of a dipolar Bose gas
confined to a one-dimensional geometry. Including the leading beyond-mean-field
effects within an effective Hamiltonian, the analysis is based on Bogoliubov
theory with several order parameters accounting for the superfluid as well as
solid structure. We find fast convergence of the ground-state energy in the
supersolid with the number of order parameters and demonstrate a stable
excitation spectrum with two Goldstone modes and an amplitude mode in the
low-energy regime. Our results imply that for realistic experimental parameters
with Dysprosium atoms, the supersolid phase is stable in the thermodynamic
limit and the transition into the supersolid phase is of second order driven by
the roton instability.

<h3>Spin diffusion in perturbed isotropic Heisenberg spin chain</h3>

<br>
<br>
The isotropic Heisenberg chain represents a particular case of an integrable
many-body system exhibiting superdiffusive spin transport at finite
temperatures. Here, we show that this model has distinct properties also at
finite magnetization $m\ne0$, even upon introducing the SU(2) invariant
perturbations. Specifically, we observe nonmonotonic dependence of the
diffusion constant ${\cal D}_0(\Delta)$ on the spin anisotropy $\Delta$, with a
pronounced maximum at $\Delta =1$. The latter dependence remains true also in
the zero magnetization sector, with superdiffusion at $\Delta=1$ that is
remarkably stable against isotropic perturbation (at least in finite-size
systems), consistent with recent experiments with cold atoms.

<br>
<br>
Terahertz nonlinear optics is a viable method to interrogate collective
phenomena in quantum materials spanning ferroelectrics, charge-density waves,
and superconductivity. In superconductors this includes the Higgs amplitude and
Josephson phase modes. We have investigated the nonlinear c-axis response of
optimally doped La$_{1.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$CuO$_4$ using high-field THz time domain
spectroscopy (THz-TDS) at field strengths up to $\sim$80 kV/cm. With increasing
field, we observe a distinct red-shift of the Josephson plasma edge and
enhanced reflectivity (above the plasma edge) arising from third harmonic
generation. The non-monotonic temperature dependent response is consistent with
nonlinear drive of the Josephson Plasma Mode (JPM) as verified with comparison
to theoretical expectations. Our results add to the understanding that, using
THz light, the JPM (in addition to the Higgs mode) provides a route to
interrogate and control superconducting properties.

<h3>Twist angle dependent interlayer transfer of valley polarization from  excitons to free charge carriers in WSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterobilayers</h3>

<br>
<br>
We identify an optical excitation mechanism that transfers a valley
polarization from photo-excited electron-hole pairs to free charge carriers in
twisted WSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterobilayers. For small twist angles, the valley
lifetimes of the charge carriers are surprisingly short, despite the occurrence
of interlayer excitons with their presumably long recombination and
polarization lifetimes. For large twist angles, we measure an increase in both
the valley polarization and its respective lifetime by more than two orders of
magnitude. Interestingly, in such heterobilayers we observe an interlayer
transfer of valley polarization from the WSe$_2$ layer into the MoSe$_2$ layer.
This mechanism enables the creation of a photo-induced valley polarization of
free charge carriers in MoSe$_2$, which amplitude scales with the gate-induced
charge carrier density. This is in contrast to monolayer MoSe$_2$, where such a
gate-tunable valley polarization cannot be achieved. By combining time-resolved
Kerr rotation, photoluminesence and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
measurements with first principles calculations, we show that these findings
can be explained by twist angle dependent interlayer scattering mechanisms
involving the Q- and $\Gamma$-valleys.

<h3>Unification of Nonlinear Anomalous Hall Effect and Nonreciprocal  Magnetoresistance in Metals by the Quantum Geometry</h3>

<br>

The quantum geometry has significant consequences in determining transport
and optical properties in quantum materials. Here, we derive a quantum kinetic
equation unifying the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect (NLAHE) and nonreciprocal
magnetoresistance (NMR) from the quantum geometry. In the dc limit, both
transverse and longitudinal nonlinear conductivities include a term due to the
normalized quantum metric dipole. The quantum metric contribution is intrinsic
and does not scale with the quasiparticle lifetime. We demonstrate the
coexistence of large a NLAHE and NMR driven by the quantum metric dipole in
films of the doped antiferromagentic topological insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Our
work indicates that both longitudinal and transverse nonlinear transports
provide a sensitive probe of the quantum geometry in solids.

<h3>High-efficiency quantum rectification via nonlinear Hall effect</h3>

<br>
<i>Yugo Onishi, Liang Fu</i>
<br>
<br>
Noncentrosymmetric quantum materials can convert AC input current into DC
transverse current at zero magnetic field through the nonlinear Hall effect. We
analyze the AC-DC power conversion efficiency of such "Hall rectifier" and
suggest its application in wireless charging and energy harvesting. Our key
observation is that the development of Hall field results in a change of
longitudinal conductivity in the Hall rectifier. This feedback mechanism
balances the input power and the output power and hence is crucial to
understanding the power transfer from source to load. Since the nonlinear Hall
current is always perpendicular to the electric field and therefore does not by
itself generate Joule heating, the efficiency can in principle approach
\SI{100}{\percent}. We demonstrate high power conversion efficiency at large
nonlinear Hall angle and optimized load resistance.

<h3>Half-integer conductance plateau at the $ν= 2/3$ fractional quantum  Hall state in a quantum point contact</h3>

<br>
<br>
The $\nu = 2/3$ fractional quantum Hall state is the hole-conjugate state to
the primary Laughlin $\nu = 1/3$ state. We investigate transmission of edge
states through quantum point contacts fabricated on a GaAs/AlGaAs
heterostructure designed to have a sharp confining potential. When a small but
finite bias is applied, we observe an intermediate conductance plateau with $G
= 0.5 \frac{e^2}{h}$. This plateau is observed in multiple QPCs, and persists
over a significant range of magnetic field, gate voltage, and source-drain
bias, making it a robust feature. Using a simple model which considers
scattering and equilibration between counterflowing charged edge modes, we find
this half-integer quantized plateau to be consistent with full reflection of an
inner counterpropagating -1/3 edge mode while the outer integer mode is fully
transmitted. In a QPC fabricated on a different heterostructure which has a
softer confining potential, we instead observe an intermediate conductance
plateau at $G = \frac{1}{3} \frac{e^2}{h}$. These results provide support for a
model at $\nu = 2/3$ in which the edge transitions from a structure having an
inner upstream -1/3 charge mode and outer downstream integer mode to a
structure with two downstream 1/3 charge modes when the confining potential is
tuned from sharp to soft and disorder prevails.

<br>
<br>
We perform a symmetry analysis of the ABC-stacked kagome planes of Mn atoms
common to the $L1_2$ Mn$_3$X and antiperovskite Mn$_3$AB alloys. In addition to
the single-ion-anisotropy and Kitaev-type anisotropic exchange known to
stabilize 120{\deg} spin structures in these materials, our analysis results in
a staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and further gamma-type
anisotropic exchange between nearest-neighbor spins. The presence of these new
terms is shown not to affect the energetics of the 120{\deg} ground-states
which explains their absence in prior minimal magnetic models. We go on to
show, however, that their influence becomes apparent when spin-wave excitations
are considered. We highlight these effects by calculating inelastic neutron
scattering cross-sections to illustrate experimental means of probing the
existence and relative strengths of these cloaked interactions.

<h3>Quantum fluctuations in one-dimensional supersolids</h3>

<br>
<i>Chris Bühler, Tobias Ilg, Hans Peter Büchler</i>
<br>
<br>
In one-dimension, quantum fluctuations prevent the appearance of long-range
order in a supersolid, and only quasi long-range order can survive. We derive
this quantum critical behavior and study its influence on the superfluid
response and properties of the solid. The analysis is based on an effective
low-energy description accounting for the two coupled Goldstone modes. We find
that the quantum phase transition from the superfluid to the supersolid is
shifted by quantum fluctuations from its mean-field prediction. However, for
current experimental parameters with dipolar atomic gases, this shift is not
observable and the transition appears to be mean-field like.

Dark blue single crystals of Al_1.75^(3+) Ti_1.0^(4+) Ti_0.25^(3+) O_5 were
grown with a novel synthesis method based on the reaction of a Ti3+/Ti4+
containing langbeinite melt and Al2O3. The obtained needles crystallize in the
pseudobrookite structure and undergo two reversible phase transitions from
orthorhombic Cmcm to C2/m first and subsequently to C2 symmetry. Like the known
aluminum titanate pseudobrookites, anistropic thermal expansion is observed.
The temperature evolution of the crystal structure reveals some insights into
the mechanism leading to the decomposition of the Al1.75Ti1.25O5 above
725{\deg}C. The magnetic and electrical properties are discussed and compared
to other reported aluminum titanate pseudobrookites.
