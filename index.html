<br>
We present a theory of hydrodynamics for a vector U(1) charge in 2+1
dimensions, whose rotational symmetry is broken to the point group of an
equilateral triangle. We show that it is possible for this U(1) to have a
chiral anomaly. The hydrodynamic consequence of this anomaly is the
introduction of a ballistic contribution to the dispersion relation for the
hydrodynamic modes. We simulate classical Markov chains and find compelling
numerical evidence for the anomalous hydrodynamic universality class.
Generalizations of our theory to other symmetry groups are also discussed.

Natural language processing (NLP) has an immense potential to aid materials
design processes. While there have been several advancements in this field, a
complete and integrated framework with well-curated dataset and tools to apply
NLP is still needed. In this work, we present the ChemNLP library and an
accompanying web-app that can be used to analyze important materials chemistry
information. We use the publicly available arXiv dataset that has been
collected over 34 years and contains ~1.8 million articles. First, we analyze
the article publication trend, categorizations, and common phrases in the arXiv
dataset. Then, we develop a user-friendly, interactive web-app to retrieve
articles for a given chemical compound. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework to accelerate the identification of
superconducting materials. We determine the overlap between density functional
theory and text-based databases for superconductors. Finally, we perform
machine learning based clustering and classification tasks to quickly
categorize scholarly articles given article title information with accuracy up
to 81.2 %. ChemNLP is available at the websites:

<h3>Active photocatalysts for CO2 conversion by severe plastic deformation  (SPD)</h3>

Excessive CO2 emission from fossil fuel usage has resulted in global warming
and environmental crises. To solve this problem, photocatalytic conversion of
CO2 to CO or useful components is a new strategy that has received significant
attention. The main challenge in this regard is exploring photocatalysts with
high activity for CO2 photoreduction. Severe plastic deformation (SPD) through
the high-pressure torsion (HPT) process has been effectively used in recent
years to develop novel active catalysts for CO2 conversion. These active
photocatalysts have been designed based on four main strategies (i) oxygen
vacancy and strain engineering, (ii) stabilization of high-pressure phases,
(iii) synthesis of defective high-entropy oxides, and (iv) synthesis of
low-bandgap high-entropy oxynitrides. These strategies can enhance the
photocatalytic efficiency compared to conventional and benchmark photocatalysts
by improving CO2 adsorption, increasing light absorbance, aligning the band
structure, narrowing the bandgap, accelerating the charge carrier migration,
suppressing the recombination rate of electrons and holes, and providing active
sites for photocatalytic reactions. This article reviews recent progress in the
application of SPD to develop functional ceramics for photocatalytic CO2
conversion.

<h3>Out-of-plane polarization and topological magnetic vortices in  multiferroic CrPSe$_3$</h3>

<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) multiferroic materials are ideal systems for exploring
new coupling mechanisms between different ferroic orders and producing novel
quantum phenomena with potential applications. We employed first-principles
density functional theory calculations to discover intrinsic ferroelectric and
anti-ferroelectric phases of CrPSe$_3$, which show ferromagnetic order and
compete with the centrosymmetric phase with an antiferromagnetic order. Our
analysis show that the electrical dipoles of such type-I multiferroic phases
come from the out-of-plane displacements of phosphorus ions due to the
stereochemically active lone pairs. The coupling between polar and magnetic
orders creates the opportunity for tunning the magnetic ground state by
switching from the centrosymmetric to the ferroelectric phase using an
out-of-plane electric field. In ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases, the
combination of easy-plane anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions
(DMI) indicate they can host topological magnetic vortices like meron pairs.

<h3>Polarization analysis of the terahertz emission from Bi-2212  cross-whisker intrinsic Josephson junction and its refractive index</h3>

Polarization analyses of the THz emission from
Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212) whisker crystals as a new
material for superconducting THz emitters were conducted. The THz emission mode
was estimated by a simple polarization measurement, and a simulation study was
conducted to examine the validity of the polarization analysis. The refractive
index of whisker crystals revealed through the polarization analysis is greater
than that of bulk single crystals, and agrees well with our previous THz
emission report. The simulation study suggests the complexed plasma excitation
mode of the THz emission, then an interpretation of the refractive index
obtained in this study is given.

<h3>Multiscale heat transport with inertia and thermal vortices</h3>

In this paper, we present a Hamiltonian and thermodynamic theory of heat
transport on various levels of description. Transport of heat is formulated
within kinetic theory of polarized phonons, kinetic theory of unpolarized
phonons, hydrodynamics of polarized phonons, and hydrodynamics of unpolarized
phonons. These various levels of description are linked by Poisson reductions,
where no linearizations are made. Consequently, we obtain a new phonon
hydrodynamics that contains convective terms dependent on vorticity of the heat
flux, which are missing in the standard theories of phonon hydrodynamics.
Moreover, the equations are hyperbolic and Galilean invariant, unlike current
theories for beyond-Fourier heat transport. The vorticity-dependent terms
violate the alignment of the heat flux with the temperature gradient even in
the stationary state, which is expressed by a Fourier-Crocco equation. The new
terms also cause that temperature plays in heat transport a similar role as
pressure in aerodynamics.

<h3>Exploring the phonon-assisted excitation mechanism of luminescent  centres in hexagonal boron nitride by photoluminescence excitation  spectroscopy</h3>

<br>
The two-dimensional material hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) hosts
single-photon emitters active at room temperature. However, the microscopic
origin of these emitters, as well as the mechanism through which they are
excited, remain elusive. We address these issues by combining \emph{ab initio}
calculations with low-temperature photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. By
studying 26 defect transitions, we find excellent qualitative agreement of
experiments with the emission and absorption line shapes of the carbon trimers
$\mathrm{C_2C_N}$ and $\mathrm{C_2C_B}$, while enabling us to exclude 24 defect
transitions for one luminescent centre. Furthermore, we show an enhanced
zero-phonon line intensity at two-phonon detuning. This unambiguously
demonstrates that luminescent centers in hBN, and by inference single-photon
emitters, are excited through a phonon-assisted mechanism. To the best of our
knowledge, this study provides the most comprehensive insight into the
excitation mechanism and the microscopic origin of luminescent centers in hBN.

<h3>Molecular origin of the two-step mechanism of gellan aggregation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08975" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08975</a>
<br>
<i>Letizia Tavagnacco, Ester Chiessi, Leonardo Severini, Silvia Franco, Elena Buratti, Angela Capocefalo, Francesco Brasili, Adriano Mosca Conte, Mauro Missori, Roberta Angelini, Simona Sennato, Claudia Mazzuca, Emanuela Zaccarelli</i>
<br>
Among hydrocolloids, gellan is one of the most used anionic polysaccharides,
because of its capability of forming mechanically stable gels at relatively low
concentrations. Despite its long-standing use and importance, the gellan
aggregation mechanism is still not presently understood at the microscopic
level due to the lack of atomistic information. Here we will fill this gap by
reporting molecular dynamics simulations of gellan chains at different polymer
and salt contents, being able to unveil the occurrence of the two steps in the
process, in agreement with existing hypotheses. At first, the formation of
double helices takes place, followed by the aggregation into super-structures.
For both steps, the role of bivalent cations appears to be crucial, as also
shown by rheology and atomic force microscopy measurements: they not only
facilitate the junction of the chains into double helices, but also promote
through bridging their arrangement into larger aggregates. On the other hand,
monovalent cations have a much more reduced role, making it possible to form
double helices only at very high salt content and not actively participating in
the formation of gels. Our simulations thus offer the first complete
microscopic overview of gellan aggregation and will be important for future use
of gellan-based systems for a wide variety of applications, ranging from food
science to art restoration.

<h3>Cooper approach to pair formation in a tight-binding model of La-based  cuprate superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09057" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09057</a>
<br>
<i>Klaus M. Frahm, Dima L. Shepelyansky</i>
<br>
We study numerically, in the framework of the Cooper approach from 1956,
mechanisms of pair formation in a model of La-based cuprate superconductors
with longer-ranged hopping parameters reported in the literature at different
values of center of mass momentum. An efficient numerical method allows to
study lattices with more than a million sites. We consider the cases of
attractive Hubbard and d-wave type interactions and a repulsive Coulomb
interaction. The approach based on a frozen Fermi sea leads to a complex
structure of accessible relative momentum states which is very sensitive to the
total pair momentum of static or mobile pairs. It is found that interactions
with attraction of approximately half of an electronvolt give a satisfactory
agreement with experimentally reported results for the critical superconducting
temperature and its dependence on hole doping. Ground states exhibit d-wave
symmetries for both attractive Hubbard and d-wave interactions which is
essentially due to the particular Fermi surface structure and not entirely to
an eventual d-wave symmetry of the interaction. We also find pair states
created by Coulomb repulsion at excited energies above the Fermi energy and
determine the different mechanisms of their formation. In particular, we
identify such pairs in a region of negative mass at rather modest excitation
energies which is due to a particular band structure.

<h3>Effect of Local Chain Dynamics on the Structure of Free Volume Elements  in Glassy Polymer Membranes from All-Atom Molecular Dynamics Simulations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09142" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09142</a>
<br>
<i>Mohammed Al Otmi, Janani Sampath</i>
<br>
Polymers are attractive membrane materials owing to their mechanical
robustness and relatively inexpensive fabrication. An important dictator of
membrane performance are free volume elements (FVEs), microporous void spaces
created by the inefficient packing of bulky groups along the polymer chain.
FVEs tend to degrade over time as polymer chains reorganize irreversibly;
relating local chain dynamics to the distribution of FVEs can help control
phenomena like plasticization and aging. In this work, we implement all-atom
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study three polymers with different
glass transition temperatures (Tg): polymethylpentene (PMP), polystyrene (PS),
and HAB-6FDA thermally rearranged polymer (TRP). We observe that chain segments
near FVEs have higher mobility compared to the atoms in the bulk; the extent of
this difference is a function of Tg. To capture penetrant diffusion through the
polymer matrix, hydrogen is inserted, and the mean squared displacement is
calculated; penetrant mobility is dependent on both FVE distribution and
polymer chain dynamics.

<h3>Stationary states of an active Brownian particle in a harmonic trap</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09184" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09184</a>
<br>
<i>Urvashi Nakul, Manoj Gopalakrishnan</i>
<br>
We study the stationary states of an over-damped active Brownian particle
(ABP) in a harmonic trap in two dimensions, via mathematical calculations and
numerical simulations. In addition to translational diffusion, the ABP
self-propels with a certain velocity, whose magnitude is constant, but its
direction is subject to Brownian rotation. In the limit where translational
diffusion is negligible, the stationary distribution of the particle's position
shows a transition between two different shapes, one with maximum and the other
with minimum density at the centre, as the trap stiffness is increased. We show
that this non-intuitive behaviour is captured by the relevant Fokker-Planck
equation, which, under minimal assumptions, predicts a continuous ``phase
transition" between the two different shapes. As the translational diffusion
coefficient is increased, both these distributions converge into the
equilibrium, Boltzmann form. Our simulations support the analytical
predictions, and also show that the probability distribution of the orientation
angle of the self-propulsion velocity undergoes a transition from unimodal to
bimodal forms in this limit. We also extend our simulations to a three
dimensional trap, and find similar behaviour.

<h3>Theoretical bound of the efficiency of learning</h3>

<br>
A unified thermodynamic formalism describing the efficiency of learning is
proposed. First, we derive an inequality, which is more strength than
Clausius's inequality, revealing the lower bound of the entropy-production rate
of a subsystem. Second, the inequality is transformed to determine the general
upper limit for the efficiency of learning. In particular, we exemplify the
bound of the efficiency in nonequilibrium quantum-dot systems and networks of
living cells. The framework provides a fundamental trade-off relationship
between energy and information inheriting in stochastic thermodynamic
processes.

<h3>Interplay of Structural Chirality, Electron Spin and Topological Orbital  in Chiral Molecular Spin Valves</h3>

<br>
Chirality has been a property of central importance in chemistry and biology
for more than a century, and is now taking on increasing relevance in condensed
matter physics. Recently, electrons were found to become spin polarized after
transmitting through chiral molecules, crystals, and their hybrids. This
phenomenon, called chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), presents broad
application potentials and far-reaching fundamental implications involving
intricate interplays among structural chirality, topological states, and
electronic spin and orbitals. However, the microscopic picture of how chiral
geometry influences electronic spin remains elusive. In this work, via a direct
comparison of magnetoconductance (MC) measurements on magnetic
semiconductor-based chiral molecular spin valves with normal metal electrodes
of contrasting strengths of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), we unambiguously
identified the origin of the SOC, a necessity for the CISS effect, given the
negligible SOC in organic molecules. The experiments revealed that a
heavy-metal electrode provides SOC to convert the orbital polarization induced
by the chiral molecular structure to spin polarization. Our results evidence
the essential role of SOC in the metal electrode for engendering the CISS spin
valve effect. A tunneling model with a magnetochiral modulation of the
potential barrier is shown to quantitatively account for the unusual transport
behavior. This work hence produces critical new insights on the microscopic
mechanism of CISS, and more broadly, reveals a fundamental relation between
structure chirality, electron spin, and orbital.

<h3>Ferroelectric Domain Wall Logic Gates</h3>

Fundamentally, lithium niobate is an extremely good electrical insulator.
However, this can change dramatically when 180{\deg} domain walls are present,
as they are often found to be strongly conducting. Absolute conductivities
depend on the inclination angles of the walls with respect to the [001]
polarisation axis and so, if these inclination angles can be altered, then
electrical conductivities can be tuned, or even toggled on and off. In 500nm
thick z-cut ion-sliced thin films, localised wall angle variations can be
controlled by both the sense and magnitude of applied electrical bias. We show
that this results in a diode-like charge transport response which is effective
for half-wave rectification, albeit only at relatively low ac frequencies. Most
importantly, however, we also demonstrate that such domain wall diodes can be
used to construct "AND" and inclusive "OR" logic gates, where "0" and "1"
output states are clearly distinguishable. Realistic device modelling allows an
extrapolation of results for the operation of these domain wall diodes in more
complex arrangements and, although non-ideal, output states can still be
distinguished even in two-level cascade logic. Although conceptually simple, we
believe that our experimental demonstration of operational domain wall-enabled
logic gates represents a significant step towards the future broader
realisation of "domain wall nanoelectronics".

<h3>Nanostructured Pt-Doped 2D MoSe$_2$: An Efficient Bifunctional  Electrocatalyst for both Hydrogen Evolution and Oxygen Reduction Reactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08152" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08152</a>

TMDs are a new family of 2D materials with features that make them appealing
for potential applications in nanomaterials science and engineering. Although,
the edges of the 2D TMDs show excellent electrocatalytic performance, their
basal plane is inert which hinders the industrial applications for
electrocatalysis. Here, we have computationally designed the 2D monolayer
MoSe$_2$ and studied its electronic properties with electrocatalytic
activities. Pt-atom has been doped in the pristine 2D MoSe$_2$ to activate the
inert basal plane resulting zero bandgap. This study reveals that the
Pt-MoSe$_2$ is an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the aid of
the DFT. Periodic hybrid DFT method has been applied to compute the electronic
properties of both the pristine MoSe$_2$ and Pt-MoSe$_2$. To determine both the
HER and ORR mechanisms on the surface of the Pt-MoSe2 material, a non-periodic
DFT calculation has been performed by considering a molecular
Pt1-Mo$_9$Se${21}$ cluster model. The present study shows that the 2D
Pt-MoSe$_2$ follows Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for HER with the energy barriers
about 9.29 kcal/mol and 10.55 kcal.mol-1 during the H-migration and Heyrovsky
reactions. The ORR is achieved by four-electron transfer mechanism with the
formation of two transition energy barriers about 14.94 kcal/mol and 11.10
kcal/mol, respectively. The lower energy barriers and high turnover frequency
during the reactions expose that the Pt-MoSe$_2$ can be adopted as an efficient
bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the HER and ORR. The present studies
demonstrate that the exceptional HER and ORR activity and stability performance
shown by the MoSe$_2$ electrocatalyst can be enhanced by Pt-doping, opening a
promising concept for the sensible design of high-performance catalyst for H2
production and O2 reduction.

<h3>Predicting the Mpemba Effect Using Machine Learning</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08161" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08161</a>
<br>

<br>
The Mpemba Effect -- when a system that is further from equilibrium relaxes
faster than a system that is closer -- can be studied with Markovian dynamics
in a non-equilibrium thermodynamics framework. The Markovian Mpemba Effect can
be observed in a variety of systems including the Ising model. We demonstrate
that the Markovian Mpemba Effect can be predicted in the Ising model with
several machine learning methods: the decision tree algorithm, neural networks,
linear regression, and non-linear regression with the LASSO method. The
effectiveness of these methods are compared. Additionally, we find that machine
learning methods can be used to accurately extrapolate to data outside the
range which they were trained. Neural Networks can even predict the existence
of the Mpemba Effect when they are trained only on data in which the Mpemba
Effect does not occur. This indicates that information about the effect is
contained even in systems where it is not present. All of these results
demonstrate that the Mpemba Effect can be predicted in complex, computationally
expensive systems, without performing full calculations.

<h3>Engineering Chemo-Mechanical Properties of Zn Surfaces via Alucone  Coating</h3>

Aqueous zinc (Zn)-ion batteries (AZIB) are promising candidates for the
next-generation energy store systems due to their high capacity and low cost.
Despite their nominal performance, Zn anodes tend to rapidly develop dendrite
and fracture, leading to substantial capacity loss and cycling stability
failure. Well-controlled coating using organic-inorganic hybrid molecules is
highly promising to substantially improve their chemo-mechanical stability
without compromising their performance. We herein present a critical assessment
of the chemical and mechanical stability of alucone-coated Zn surfaces using
first-principles simulations. Negative adsorption energies indicate strong
cohesive strengths between alucone and the selected Zn surfaces. Energetically
favorable alucone coatings are further verified by charge transfer at
interfaces as seen through Bader charge analysis. Negative surface stress
profiles at alucone coated interface are mostly responsible for surface
reconstruction. The contributions of surface elastic constants are dependent on
the selection of slip planes and the thickness of the thin film. By considering
plane stress conditions, we calculate the mechanical properties which indicate
the ductility of the alucone-coated basal thin film.

Site-Net is a transformer architecture that models the periodic crystal
structures of inorganic materials as a labelled point set of atoms and relies
entirely on global self-attention and geometric information to guide learning.
Site-Net processes standard crystallographic information files to generate a
large real-space supercell, and the importance of interactions between all
atomic sites is flexibly learned by the model for the prediction task
presented. The attention mechanism is probed to reveal Site-Net can learn
long-range interactions in crystal structures, and that specific attention
heads become specialized to deal with primarily short- or long-range
interactions. We perform a preliminary hyperparameter search and train Site-Net
using a single graphics processing unit (GPU), and show Site-Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance on a standard band gap regression task.

We report on transport characteristics of field effect two-dimensional
electron gases in surface indium antimonide quantum wells. A 5 nm thin $n$-InSb
capping layer is shown to promote the formation of reliable, low resistance
Ohmic contacts to surface InSb quantum wells. High quality single-subband
magnetotransport with clear quantized integer quantum Hall plateaus are
observed to filling factor $\nu$=1 in magnetic fields of up to B=18 T. We show
that the electron density is gate-tunable, reproducible, and stable from
pinch-off to 4$\times$10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$, and peak mobilities exceed 24,000
cm$^2$/Vs. Rashba spin-orbit coupling strengths up to 130 meV$\cdot$\r{A} are
obtained through weak anti-localization measurements. An effective mass of
0.019$m_e$ is determined from temperature-dependent magnetoresistance
measurements, and a g-factor of 41 at a density of 3.6$\times$10$^{11}$
cm$^{-2}$ is obtained from coincidence measurements in tilted magnetic fields.

quantum well, we find that the carrier density is stable with time when doping
in the ternary AlInSb barrier is not present. Finally, the effect of modulation
doping on structural asymmetry between the two heterostructures is
characterized.

<h3>Unusual magnetotransport in twisted bilayer graphene from strain-induced  open Fermi surfaces</h3>

<br>
Anisotropic hopping in a toy Hofstadter model was recently invoked to explain
a rich and surprising Landau spectrum measured in twisted bilayer graphene away
from the magic angle. Suspecting that such anisotropy could arise from
unintended uniaxial strain, we extend the Bistritzer-MacDonald model to include
uniaxial heterostrain. We find that such strain strongly influences band
structure, shifting the three otherwise-degenerate van Hove points to different
energies. Coupled to a Boltzmann magnetotransport calculation, this reproduces
previously-unexplained non-saturating $B^2$ magnetoresistance over broad ranges
of density near filling $\nu=\pm 2$, and predicts subtler features that had not
been noticed in the experimental data. In contrast to these distinctive
signatures in longitudinal resistivity, the Hall coefficient is barely
influenced by strain, to the extent that it still shows a single sign change on
each side of the charge neutrality point -- surprisingly, this sign change no
longer occurs at a van Hove point. The theory also predicts a marked rotation
of the electrical transport principal axes as a function of filling even for
fixed strain and for rigid bands. More careful examination of
interaction-induced nematic order versus strain effects in twisted bilayer
graphene could thus be in order.

<br>
Magneto-transport measurements on two dimensional van der Waals
heterostructures have recently shown signatures of uniaxial anisotropy. Such
measurements are almost exclusively performed in a Hall bar geometry which
makes it difficult to extract the full resistivity tensor. The goal of this
paper is to theoretically analyze anisotropic magneto-transport in a
homogeneous disk geometry and to provide a closed form expression for the
electrical potential anywhere on the disk if the current source and drain are
located somewhere on the circumference. This expression can then be used to
experimentally extract the full resistivity tensor.

The high-pressure melting diagram of iron is a vital ingredient for the
geodynamic modeling of planetary interiors. Nonetheless, available data for
molten iron show an alarming discrepancy. Herein, we propose an efficient
one-phase approach to capture the solid-liquid transition of iron under extreme
conditions. Our basic idea is to extend the statistical moment method to
determine the density of iron in the TPa region. On that basis, we adapt the
work-heat equivalence principle to appropriately link equation-of-state
parameters with melting properties. This strategy allows explaining
cutting-edge experimental and ab initio results without massive computational
workloads. Our theoretical calculations would be helpful to constrain the
chemical composition, internal dynamics, and thermal evolution of the Earth and
super-Earths.

<br>
It has been well established that nitrogen coordinated transition metal,
TM-N$_{4}$-C (TM$=$Fe and Co) moieties, are responsible for the higher
catalytic activity for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction. However,
the results obtained using density functional theory calculations vary from one
to another, which can lead to controversy. Herein, we assess the accuracy of
the theoretical approach using different class of exchange-correlation
functionals, i.e., Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and revised PBE (RPBE), those
with the Grimme's semiempirical dispersion correction (PBE+D3 and RPBE+D3), and
the Bayesian error estimate functional with the nonlocal correlation (BEEF-vdW)
on the reaction energies of oxygen reduction reaction on TM-N$_{4}$ moieties in
graphene and those with OH-termination. We found that the predicted
overpotentials using RPBE+D3 are comparable and consistent with those using
BEEF-vdW. Our finding indicates that a proper choice of the
exchange-correlation functional is crucial to a precise description of the
catalytic activity of this system.

<h3>Onset Temperatures for Superconducting Fluctuations in Te-annealed  FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ Single Crystals: Evidence for the BCS-BEC Crossover</h3>

<br>
<i>Yu Uezono, Takumi Otsuka, Shotaro Hagisawa, Haruka Taniguchi, Michiaki Matsukawa, Takenori Fujii, Takao Watanabe</i>
<br>
Recently, the superconductors' community has witnessed an unsettled debate
regarding whether iron-based superconductors, in particular FeSe and
FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$, are in the Bardeen-Cooper-Shrieffer (BCS) - Bose-Einstein
condensation (BEC) crossover regime. Nonetheless, one particular system,
FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$, has been less investigated in this regard owing to the
screening of its intrinsic superconducting properties by the inevitable iron
excess. Herein, the onset temperatures for superconducting fluctuations
($T_{scf}$) are investigated by measuring the magnetoresistance (MR) of
Te-annealed, high-quality FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ ($x$ = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4)
single crystals. The results reveal very high $T_{scf}$ values for these
crystals. Particularly for $x$ = 0.4, $T_{scf}$ reaches approximately 40 K,
which is 2.7 times larger than $T_c$. This indicates that the superconductivity
of the FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ system is well within the BCS-BEC crossover regime.

<br>
<i>Zhuoran Geng, Ilari J. Maasilta</i>
<br>
When two piezoelectric solids are placed in close proximity, acoustic waves
can "tunnel" across a vacuum gap transmitting energy between the two solids.
Here, we demonstrate analytically that not only is such a phenomenon possible,
but that a simple resonance condition exists for which the complete
transmission of the incoming wave is possible. This result is derived for an
arbitrary anisotropic crystal symmetry and orientation. We also show that the
complete transmission condition can be related to the surface electric
impedance and the effective surface permittivity of the piezoelectric material,
making it possible to be determined experimentally. In addition, we present
numerical results for the maximum power transmittance of a slow transverse
wave, tunneling between identical ZnO crystals, as function of all possible
crystal orientations. The results show a large range of orientations for which
complete tunneling can be achieved.

<br>
High-entropy alloys and ceramics containing at least five principal elements
have received high attention in recent years for various mechanical and
functional applications. The application of severe plastic deformation (SPD),
particularly the high-pressure torsion (HPT) method combined with the CALPHAD
and first-principles calculations, resulted in the development of numerous
superfunctional high-entropy materials with superior properties compared to the
normal functions of engineering materials. This article reviews the recent
advances in the application of SPD to achieving superfunctional high-entropy
materials. These superfunctional properties include (i) ultrahigh hardness
levels in high-entropy alloys which are comparable to ceramics, (ii) high yield
strength and good hydrogen embrittlement resistance in high-entropy alloys;
(iii) high strength, low elastic modulus, and high biocompatibility in
high-entropy alloys, (iv) fast and reversible hydrogen storage in high-entropy
alloys and corresponding hydrides, (v) photovoltaic performance and
photocurrent generation on high-entropy semiconductors, (vi) photocatalytic
oxygen and hydrogen production on high-entropy oxides and oxynitrides from
water splitting, and (vii) CO2 photoreduction on high-entropy ceramics. These
findings introduce SPD as not only a processing tool to improve the properties
of existing high-entropy materials but also as a synthesis tool to synthesize
novel high-entropy materials with superior properties compared with
conventional engineering materials.

<i>Kaveh Edalati</i>
<br>
Superfunctional materials are defined as materials with specific properties
being superior to the normal functions of engineering materials. Numerous
studies introduced severe plastic deformation (SPD) as an effective process to
improve the functional and mechanical properties of various metallic and
non-metallic materials. Moreover, the concept of ultra-SPD - introducing shear
strains over 1,000 to reduce the thickness of sheared phases to levels
comparable to atomic distances - was recently utilized to synthesize novel
superfunctional materials. In this article, after a brief review of the recent
advances in the SPD field, the application of ultra-SPD for controlling atomic
diffusion and phase transformation and achieving superfunctional properties is
discussed. The main properties achieved by ultra-SPD include (i)
high-temperature thermal stability in new immiscible age-hardenable aluminum
alloys, (ii) room-temperature superplasticity for the first time in magnesium
and aluminum alloys, (iii) high strength and high plasticity in nanograined
intermetallics, (iv) low elastic modulus and high hardness in biocompatible
binary and high-entropy alloys, (v) superconductivity and high strength in the
Nb-Ti alloys, (vi) room-temperature hydrogen storage for the first time in
magnesium alloys, and (vii) superior photocatalytic hydrogen production, oxygen
production, and carbon dioxide conversion on high-entropy oxides and
oxynitrides as a new family of photocatalysts.

We consider the dynamics of lattice random walks with resetting. The walker
moving randomly on a lattice of arbitrary dimensions resets at every time step
to a given site with a constant probability $r$. We construct a discrete
renewal equation and present closed-form expressions for different quantities
of the resetting dynamics in terms of the underlying reset-free propagator or
Green's function. We apply our formalism to the biased random walk dynamics in
one-dimensional unbounded space and show how one recovers in the continuous
limits results for diffusion with resetting. The resetting dynamics of biased
random walker in one-dimensional domain bounded with periodic and reflecting
boundaries is also analyzed. Depending on the bias the first-passage
probability in periodic domain shows multi-fold non-monotonicity as $r$ is
varied. Finally, we apply our formalism to study the transmission dynamics of
two lattice walkers with resetting in one-dimensional domain bounded by
periodic and reflecting boundaries. The probability of a definite transmission
between the walkers shows non-monotonic behavior as the resetting probabilities
are varied.

A rigorous understanding of the spin incoherent Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid
(TLL), which displays solely a propagating charge mode but not a spin mode, and
the interaction-driven quantum phase transitions in one-dimensional (1D)
systems still remain elusive. In this Letter, we report the universal
properties of spin incoherent TLL and interaction-driven criticality of the 1D
repulsive Hubbard model by means of fractional charge and spin excitations,
asymptotic of correlation functions as well as the lattice Contact. We build up
an essential connection of Contact susceptibilities to the variations of
density, magnetization and entropy with respect to the interaction strength,
providing a rigorous understanding of interaction-driven phase transitions,
Mott insulator and quantum cooling in the model. These relations hold true for
higher dimensional systems.

<br>
Among several well-known transition metal-based compounds, the van der Waals
(vdW) Fe3-xGeTe2 (FGT) magnet is a strong candidate for use in two-dimensional
(2D) magnetic devices due to its strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy,
sizeable Curie temperature (TC ~ 154 K), and versatile magnetic character that
is retained in the low-dimensional limit. While the TC remains far too low for
practical applications, there has been a successful push toward improving it
via external driving forces such as pressure, irradiation, and doping. Here we
present experimental evidence of a novel room-temperature (RT) ferromagnetic
phase induced by the electrochemical intercalation of common tetrabutylammonium
cations (TBA+) into FGT bulk crystals. We obtained Curie temperatures as high
as 350 K with chemical and physical stability of the intercalated compound. The
temperature-dependent Raman measurements in combination with vdW-corrected ab
initio calculations suggest that charge transfer (electron doping) upon
intercalation could lead to the observation of RT ferromagnetism. This work
demonstrates that molecular intercalation is a viable route in realizing
high-temperature vdW magnets in an inexpensive and reliable manner.

<br>
We propose a time-reversal-even spin generation in second order of electric
fields, which dominates the current induced spin polarization in a wide class
of centrosymmetric nonmagnetic materials, and leads to a novel nonlinear
spin-orbit torque in magnets. We reveal a quantum origin of this effect from
the momentum space dipole of the anomalous spin polarizability.
First-principles calculations predict sizable spin generations in several
nonmagnetic hcp metals, in monolayer TiTe$_{2}$, and in ferromagnetic monolayer
MnSe$_{2}$, which can be detected in experiment. Our work opens up the broad
vista of nonlinear spintronics in both nonmagnetic and magnetic systems.

<h3>Thermal annealing effects on Graphene/n-Si Schottky junction Solar cell:  Removal of PMMA residues</h3>

<br>
<i>Yuzuki Ono, Hojun Im</i>
<br>
Thermal annealing is one of most effective way to improve the efficiency of
graphene/n-Si Schottky junction solar cell. Here, its underlying mechanism has
been investigated by comparative studies in terms of the removal of polymethyl
methacrylate (PMMA) residues, using the J-V characteristics, the transient
photocurrent and photovoltage measurements. Experimental results have revealed
that there are trap states which are originated from the PMMA residues and
cause the large photocurrent leakage as the intensity of the incident light
increases. It is also found that the PMMA residues accelerate deterioration and
rapidly invalidate hole doping effects. Such undesirable PMMA residues were
effectively removed by the thermal annealing treatments, serving to reduce the
photocurrent leakage and to increase the stability.

<br>
We report the discovery of an intriguing pressure-driven phase transformation
in the layered Kitaev-material $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. By analyzing both the Bragg
scattering as well as the diffuse scattering of high-quality single crystals,
we reveal a collective reorganization of the layer stacking throughout the
crystal. Importantly, this transformation also effects the structure of the
RuCl$_3$ honeycomb layers, which acquire a high trigonal symmetry with a single
Ru--Ru distance of 3.41\r{A} and a single Ru--Cl--Ru bond angle of 92.8{\deg}.
Hydrostatic pressure therefore allows to tune the structure of
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ much closer to the ideal Kitaev-limit. The high-symmetry
phase can also be stabilized by biaxial stress, which can explain conflicting
results reported earlier and, more importantly, makes the high-symmetry phase
accessible to a variety of experiments.

We report on temperature-dependent size and anisotropy of the Fermi pockets
in graphite revealed by magnetotransport measurements. The magnetoresistances
obtained in fields along the c-axis obey an extended Kohler's rule, with the
carrier density following prediction of a temperature-dependent Fermi energy,
indicating a change in the Fermi pocket size with temperature. The
angle-dependent magnetoresistivities at a given temperature exhibit a scaling
behavior. The scaling factor that reflects the anisotropy of the Fermi surface
is also found to vary with temperature. Our results demonstrate that
temperature-driven changes in Fermi surface can be ubiquitous and need to be
considered in understanding the temperature-dependent carrier density and
magnetoresistance anisotropy in semimetals.

<br>
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is the primary mechanism for
realizing real-space chiral spin textures, which are regarded as key components
for the next-generation spintronics. However, DMI arises from a perturbation
term of the spin-orbit interaction and is usually weak in pristine magnetic
semiconductors. To date, large DMI and the resulting skyrmions are only
realized in a few materials under stringent conditions. Using first-principles
calculations, we demonstrate that significant DMI occurs between
nearest-neighbor Cr atoms in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic semiconductor
CrI$_3$ on Au or Cu substrates. This exceptionally strong DMI is generated by
the interfacial charge transfer and weak chemical interactions between chromium
halides and metal substrates, which break the spatial inversion symmetry. These
findings highlight the significance of substrate effects in 2D magnets and
expand the inventory of feasible materials with strong DMI.

It is shown that the structure of non-equilibrium thermodynamic system far
from equilibrium can be captured in terms of a generalized "Nambu dynamics", in
the presence of fluctuation effects in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. As
concrete examples, chemical reaction systems with time oscillation, such as the

We report a study of structural, magnetic, heat capacity and thermoelectric
properties of a Rubased Heusler alloy, Ru2TiGe. The magnetic measurements
reveal that at higher temperatures, diamagnetic and Pauli paramagnetic
contributions dominate the magnetic behaviour whereas, at lower temperatures
(T<= 20 K), superparamagnetic interaction among clusters is observed. Effect of
such magnetic defects is also evident in the electrical resistivity behaviour
at lower temperatures. Though the temperature dependence of resistivity
exhibits a metal-like nature, the large value of Seebeck coefficient leads to
an appreciable power factor of the order of 1 mW/mK2 at 300 K. Large power
factor as well as low thermal conductivity results in a value of ZT = 0.025 at
390 K for Ru2TiGe that is orders of magnitude higher than that of the other
pure Heusler alloys and point towards its high potential for practical
thermoelectric applications.

We present a thorough study on the magnetoanisotropic properties and
magnetocaloric effect in the layered ferromagnetic Cr$_4$Te$_5$ single crystals
by performing the critical behaviour analysis of magnetization isotherms. The
critical exponents $\beta$=0.485(3), $\gamma$=1.202(5), and $\delta$=3.52(3)
with a Curie temperature of $T_C \approx 340.73(4)$ K are determined by the
modified Arrott plots. We observe a large magnetocrystalline anisotropy
K$_u$=330 kJ/$m^3$ at 3 K which gradually decreases with increasing
temperature. Maximum entropy change -$\Delta S_{M}^{max}$ and the relative
cooling power (RCP) are found to be 2.77 $J/kg-K$ and 88.29 $J/kg$,
respectively near $T_C$ when the magnetic field applied parallel to
$\it{ab}$-plane. Rescaled -$\Delta S_M (T, H)$ data measured at various
temperatures and fields collapse into a single universal curve, confirming the
second order magnetic transition in this system. Following the renormalization
group theory analysis, we find that the spin-coupling is of 3D Heisenberg-type,
$\{d:n\}=\{3:3\}$, with long-range exchange interactions decaying as $J (r) =
r^{-(d+\sigma)}= r^{-4.71}$.

Quasicrystal (QC) possesses a unique lattice structure with rotational
symmetry forbidden in conventional crystals. The electric property is far from
complete understanding and it has been a long-standing issue whether the
magnetic long-range order is realized in the QC. The main difficulty was lack
of microscopic theory to analyze the effect of the crystalline electric field
(CEF) at the rare-earth atom in QCs. Here we show the full microscopic analysis
of the CEF in Tb-based QCs. We find that magnetic anisotropy arising from the
CEF plays a key role in realizing unique magnetic textures on the icosahedron
whose vertices Tb atoms are located at. Our analysis suggests that the
long-range order of the hedgehog characterized by the topological charge of one
is stabilized in the Tb-based QC. We also find that the whirling-moment state
is characterized by unusually large topological charge of three. The magnetic
textures as well as the topological states are shown to be switched by
controlling compositions of the non-rare-earth elements in the ternary
compounds. Our model is useful to understand the magnetism as well as the
topological property in the rare-earth-based QCs and approximant crystals.

Weyl semimetals are phases of matter with gapless electronic excitations that
are protected by topology and symmetry. Their properties depend on the
dimensions of the systems. It has been theoretically demonstrated that
five-dimensional (5D) Weyl semimetals emerge as novel phases during the
topological phase transition in analogy to the three-dimensional case. However,
experimental observation of such a phenomenon remains a great challenge because
the tunable 5D system is extremely hard to construct in real space. Here, we
construct 5D electric circuit platforms in fully real space and experimentally
observe topological phase transitions in five dimensions. Not only are Yang
monopoles and linked Weyl surfaces observed experimentally, but various phase
transitions in five dimensions are also proved, such as the phase transitions
from a normal insulator to a Hopf link of twoWeyl surfaces and then to a 5D
topological insulator. The demonstrated topological phase transitions in five
dimensions leverage the concept of higher-dimensional Weyl physics to control
electrical signals in the engineered circuits.

The proximity effect in normal/superconductor heterostructures is an
intriguing phenomenon in that the normal side takes on the properties of a
superconductor with an induced gap. However, the structural and pinning
properties of vortices inside the normal regions remain poorly understood.
Here, we report structure and superconducting properties of a proximity-coupled
Mg/MgO/MgB2 system with ~30 vol. % of superconducting MgB2, in which MgB2
nanograins are distributed in a fractal manner to form a proximity network with
clean interfaces. Conductivity and magnetic measurements demonstrate that this
proximity-coupled system acts as a fully phase coherent superconductor with
isotropic pinning. Magneto-optical imaging also reveals a rather homogeneous
flux density distribution with no apparent granularity. Furthermore, we observe
quantized proximity vortices and their clustering behavior by scanning
superconducting quantum interface device microscopy. These results show that in
contrast to the case of conventional granular superconductors, the grain
boundaries in the present sample carry high critical currents and have high
vortex pinning efficiency, resulting in a robust phase coherent state
irrespective of the low volume fraction of the MgB2 nanograins. This finding
not only reveals the features of proximity-induced vortices, but also
demonstrates an excellent phase-locked capability of the proximity-coupled
fractal system.

excitonic transitions followed by their replicas involving acoustic and optical
phonons are distinguished using classical intensity correlation analysis. The
emission is attributed to the recombination of excitons bound to iodine (I$_2$)
molecules intercalated between layers of HfS$_2$. The I$_2$ molecules are
introduced to the crystal during the growth as halogen transport agents in the
CVT growth process. Their presence in the crystal is confirmed by secondary ion
mass spectroscopy.

Bismuth-based metal oxides are an intriguing class of photoelectrode
materials that can potentially enable large-scale solar hydrogen production via
photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting. For realizing such PEC devices,
Kusachiite (copper bismuth oxide) is one of the most promising photocathode
materials for high solar to hydrogen efficiency. Here we attempt to synthesize
phase pure copper bismuth oxide (CuBi2O4) nanopowders using a facile
solid-state reaction technique subsequently sintered at 750 0C for 4 h in air.
These CuBi2O4 (CBO) powders have been further sequentially ball milled (SBM) up
to 25 h to elucidate the milling duration effect on the optical bandgap of the
ball milled CuBi2O4 (SBM-CBO). The structural, optical, and Raman studies
suggest that phase pure tetragonal CBO could be grown from raw CuO and Bi2O3
powders. The variations in morphology and chemical composition of CBO with
increasing milling hours were examined using field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FE-SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis,
respectively. The optical bandgap was measured in the range of 1.70 - 1.85 eV
from the UV-VIS-NIR Diffuse reflection data of SBM-CBO powders. The CBO
photocathode materials with variable structural and optical properties could be
a promising candidate for self-sustained PEC generation of hydrogen fuel.

Photocatalytic nitrogen fixation from air directly under sunlight can
contribute significantly to carbon neutralization. It is an ideal pathway to
replace the industrial Haber Bosch process in future. A Fe-doped layered WO$_3$
photocatalyst containing oxygen vacancies was developed which can fix nitrogen
from air directly under sunlight at atmospheric pressure. The iron doping
enhances the transport efficiency of photogenerated electrons. The
photocatalytic efficiency is around 4 times higher than that of pure WO$_3$.
The optimum nitrogen fixation conditions were examined by orthogonal
experiments and its nitrogen fixation performance could reach up to 477 $\mu
\text{g} \cdot \text{g}_{\text{cat}}^{-1} \cdot \text{h}^{-1}$ under sunlight.
In addition, the process of nitrogen fixation was detected by situ infrared,
which confirmed the reliability of nitrogen fixation. Also, modelling on the
interactions between light and the photocatalyst was carried out to study the
distribution of surface charge and validate the light absorption of the
photocatalyst. This work provides a simple and cheap strategy for
photocatalytic nitrogen fixation from air under mild conditions.

Recently, charge or spin nonlinear transport with nontrivial topological
properties in crystal materials has attracted much attention. In this paper, we
perform a comprehensive symmetry analysis for all 122 magnetic point groups
(MPGs) and provide a useful dictionary for charge and spin nonlinear transport
from Berry curvature dipole, Berry connection polarization and Drude term with
nontrivial topological nature. The results are obtained by making a full
symmetry investigation on matrix representations of six nonlinear response
tensors. We further identify every MPG that can accommodate two or three of the
nonlinear tensors. The present work gives a solid theoretical basis for overall
understanding the second-order nonlinear responses in realistic materials.

<h3>Vacancy-ordered Double Perovskites A$_2$BX$_6$ (A = Cs, B = Pt, Pd, Te,  Sn, X = I): An Emerging Class of Thermoelectric Materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08559" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08559</a>
<br>
<i>Preeti Bhumla, Manjari Jain, Sajjan Sheoran, Saswata Bhattacharya</i>
<br>
Vacancy-ordered double perovskites (A$_2$BX$_6$), being one of the
environmentally friendly and stable alternatives to lead halide perovskites,
have garnered considerable research attention in the scientific community.
However, their thermal transport has not been explored much despite their
potential applications. Here, we explore A$_2$BX$_6$ (A = Cs, B = Pt, Pd, Te,
Sn, X = I) as potential thermoelectric materials using the state-of-the-art
first-principles based methodologies, viz., density functional theory (DFT)
combined with many-body perturbation theory (G$_0$W$_0$) and spin-orbit
coupling (SOC). The phonon dispersion plots and Poisson's and Pugh's ratios
show the dynamical and mechanical stability of this class of perovskites. The
absence of polyhedral connectivity in vacancy-ordered perovskites gives rise to
additional degrees of freedom leading to lattice anharmonicity. The presence of
anharmonic lattice dynamics leads to strong electron-phonon coupling, which is
well captured by Fr\"{o}hlich mesoscopic model to investigate the interaction
of longitudinal optical phonon modes with the carriers that strongly influence
the carrier mobility. The lattice anharmonicity is further studied using $ab$
$initio$ molecular dynamics simulations and electron localization function. The
maximum anharmonicity is observed in Cs$_2$PtI$_6$, followed by Cs$_2$PdI$_6$,
Cs$_2$TeI$_6$ and Cs$_2$SnI$_6$. Also, the computed average thermoelectric
figure of merit ($zT$) for Cs$_2$PtI$_6$, Cs$_2$PdI$_6$, Cs$_2$TeI$_6$ and
Cs$_2$SnI$_6$ are 0.88, 0.85, 0.95 and 0.78, respectively, which reveals their
promising renewable energy applications.

Unconventional Weyl point with nonlinear dispersion features higher
topological charge $|{\cal{C}}|>1$ and multiple topologically protected Fermi
arc states at its boundary. As a novel topological state, it has been
attracting widespread attention. However, the unconventional Weyl point with
$|{\cal{C}}|=3$ has not yet been reported in realistic materials, even though
it has been theoretically proposed for more than a decade. In this work, based
on first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we predict the
existing material, $\rm\alpha$-LiIO$_3$ as the first realistic example with
this unconventional Weyl point. Particularly, in the phonon spectra of
$\rm\alpha$-LiIO$_3$, two Weyl points with ${\cal{C}}=-3$, connected by
time-reversal symmetry, appear at the neck crossing-point of a hourglass-type
band, leading to two hourglass charge-3 Weyl phonons. The symmetry protection
and the associated novel triple- and sextuple-helicoid surface arc states of
the hourglass charge-3 Weyl phonons are revealed. Our results uncover a hidden
topological character of $\rm\alpha$-LiIO$_3$ and also show that the phonon
spectra is a great platform for exploring unconventional topological states.

<h3>Dynamical phase transition in random walk subject to random drives</h3>

<br>
Random walk subject to random drive has been extensively employed as models
of physical and biological processes. While equilibrium statistical mechanics
has yielded significant insights into the distributions of dynamical fixed
points of such a system, its non-equilibrium properties are still largely left
unknown. In contrast, most real world applications concern dynamical aspects of
this model. In particular, dynamical quantities like heat dissipation and work
absorption plays a central role in predicting and controlling non-equilibrium
phases of matter. Recent advances in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics
enables a more refined study of the dynamical aspects of random walk under
random drives. We perform a numerical study on this model, and demonstrate that
this model exhibits two dynamical phases: a phase where typical random walk
trajectories are non-extensive and confined to neighborhood of fix points, and
another phase where typical random walk trajectories are extensive and can
transition between fixed points. We propose different summary statistics of the
heat dissipation, and show that these two phases are distinctively different.
Our characterization of these distinctive phases deepens the understanding of
and provides novel strategies for the nonequilibrium phase of this model.

<br>
It is predicted that strongly interacting spins on a frustrated lattice may
lead to a quantum disordered ground state or even form a quantum spin liquid
with exotic low-energy excitations. However, a thorough tuning of the
frustration strength, separating its effects from those of disorder and other
factors, is pending. Here we break the symmetry of a kagome-lattice compound in
a controlled manner by applying $in$ $situ$ uniaxial stress. The transition
temperature of $\rm Y_3Cu_9(OH)_{18}OCl_8$ is linearly enhanced with strain,
$\Delta T_{\rm N}/T_{\rm N} \approx 10\%$ upon in-plane compression of order
$1\%$, providing clear evidence for a release of frustration and its pivotal
role for magnetic order. Our comprehensive $^1$H NMR results suggest a
$\overrightarrow{Q}=(1/3\times 1/3)$ state under unstrained conditions and
further reveal an incomplete antiferromagnetic transition with fluctuating
moments in this strongly frustrated system.

<h3>Strong Spin Filtering by Silicon Nanoparticles with Adsorbed Bismuth  Atom Clusters: Role of Symmetry and Electrostatic Control of the Direction of  the Spin Polarization</h3>

<br>
<i>Alireza Saffarzadeh, George Kirczenow</i>
<br>
We present a theoretical study, based on density functional theory and tight
binding modeling, of the electronic structure and spin transport properties of
silicon nanoparticles with adsorbed bismuth atoms. We find the bismuth atoms to
form clusters separated by quantum tunnel barriers. We predict strong spin
filtering by these nanostructures in the high conductance regime when the
source and drain leads are connected to the same bismuth cluster and in the low
conductance regime when the source and drain leads are connected to different
bismuth clusters. We relate the spin filtering to a symmetry obeyed by the spin
transmission probability matrix of the system. We also predict that for such
systems the direction of the spin polarization in the drain lead can be tuned
through large angles and even reversed electrostatically simply by varying the
voltage applied to a gate. Realization of these silicon-bismuth nanostructures
in the laboratory is feasible. We expect the predicted spin filtering to be
experimentally accessible and potentially relevant for device applications.

We evidence the possibility for coherent electrical manipulation of the spin
orientation of topologically protected edge states in a low-symmetry quantum
spin Hall insulator. By using a combination of ab-initio simulations,
symmetry-based modeling, and large-scale calculations of the spin Hall
conductivity, it is shown that small electric fields can efficiently vary the
spin textures of edge currents in monolayer 1T'-WTe2 by up to a 90-degree spin
rotation, without jeopardizing their topological character. These findings
suggest a new kind of gate-controllable spin-based device, topologically
protected against disorder and of relevance for the development of topological
spintronics.

<h3>Control of chiral orbital currents in a colossal magnetoresistance  material</h3>

<br>
Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is an extraordinary enhancement of the
electric conductivity in the presence of a magnetic field. It is conventionally
associated with a field-induced spin polarization, which drastically reduces
spin scattering and thus electric resistance. However, ferrimagnetic Mn3Si2Te6
is an intriguing exception to this rule: it exhibits a 7-order-of-magnitude
reduction in ab-plane resistivity with a 13-Tesla anisotropy field which occur
only when a magnetic polarization is avoided [1]. Here we report an exotic
quantum state that is driven by ab-plane chiral orbital currents (COC) flowing
along edges of MnTe6 octahedra. The c-axis orbital moments of ab-plane COC
couple to the ferrimagnetic Mn spins to drastically increase the ab-plane
conductivity (CMR) when an external magnetic field is aligned along the
magnetic hard c-axis. Both the COC state and its CMR are extraordinarily
susceptible to small DC currents exceeding a critical threshold, and a hallmark
of this COC state is an exotic time-dependent, bistable switching mimicking a
first-order melting transition. The control of the COC-enabled CMR and bistable
switching offers a fundamentally new paradigm for quantum technologies.

<i>R.D. Mckenzie, M. Libersky, D.M. Silevitch, T.F. Rosenbaum</i>
<br>
We present a theory of magnon-polaritons in quantum Ising materials, and
develop a formalism describing the coupling between light and matter as an
Ising system is tuned through its quantum critical point. The theory is applied
to Ising materials having multilevel single-site Hamiltonians, in which
multiple magnon modes are present, such as the insulating Ising magnet
LiHoF$_4$ . We find that the magnon-photon coupling strengths may be tuned by
the applied transverse field, with the coupling between the soft mode present
in the quantum Ising material and a photonic resonator mode diverging at the
quantum critical point of the material. A fixed system of spins will not
exhibit the diamagnetic response expected when light is coupled to mobile spins
or atoms. Without the diamagnetic response, one expects a divergent
magnon-photon coupling strength to lead to a superradiant quantum phase
transition. However, this neglects the effects of damping and decoherence
present in any real system. We show that damping and decoherence may block the
superradiant quantum phase transition, and lead to weak coupling between the
soft magnon mode and the resonator mode. The results of the theory are applied
to experimental data on the model system LiHoF$_4$ in a microwave resonator.

<br>
The capacity to electrically detect phonons, ultimately at the single-phonon
limit, is a key requirement for many schemes for phonon-based quantum
computing, so-called quantum phononics. Here, we predict that by exploiting the
strong coupling of their electrons to surface-polar phonons, van der Waals
heterostructures can offer a suitable platform for phonon sensing, capable of
resolving energy transfer at the single-phonon level. The geometry we consider
is one in which a drag momentum is exerted on electrons in a graphene layer, by
a single out-of-equilibrium phonon in a dielectric layer of hexagonal boron
nitride, giving rise to a measurable induced voltage ($V_{\rm drag}$). Our
numerical solution of the Boltzmann Transport Equation shows that this drag
voltage can reach a level of a few hundred microvolts per phonon, well above
experimental detection limits. Furthermore, we predict that $V_{\rm drag}$
should be highly insensitive to the mobility of carriers in the graphene layer
and to increasing the temperature to at least 300 K, offering the potential of
a versatile material platform for single-phonon sensing.

This work maps deep neural networks to classical Ising spin models, allowing
them to be described using statistical thermodynamics. The density of states
shows that structures emerge in the weights after they have been trained --
well-trained networks span a much wider range of realizable energies compared
to poorly trained ones. These structures propagate throughout the entire
network and are not observed in individual layers. The energy values correlate
to performance on tasks, making it possible to distinguish networks based on
quality without access to data. Thermodynamic properties such as specific heat
are also studied, revealing a higher critical temperature in trained networks.

The iron-based superconductors are an ideal platform to reveal the enigma of
the unconventional superconductivity and potential topological
superconductivity. Among them, the monolayer Fe(Se,Te)/SrTiO3(001), which is
proposed to be topological nontrivial, shows interface-enhanced
high-temperature superconductivity in the two dimensional limit. However, the
experimental studies on the superconducting pairing mechanism of monolayer
Fe(Se,Te) films are still limited. Here, by measuring quasiparticle
interference in monolayer Fe(Se,Te)/SrTiO3(001), we report the observation of
the anisotropic structure of the large superconducting gap and the sign change
of the superconducting gap on different electron pockets. The results are well
consistent with the 'bonding-antibonding' s+- wave pairing symmetry driven by
spin fluctuations in conjunction with spin-orbit coupling. Our work is of basic
significance not only for a unified superconducting formalism in the iron-based
superconductors, but also for understanding of topological superconductivity in

Understanding energy transport in semiconductors is critical for design of
electronic and optoelectronic devices. Semiconductor material properties such
as charge carrier mobility or diffusion length are measured in bulk crystals
and determined using models that describe transport behavior in homogeneous
media, where structural boundary effects are minimal. However, most emerging
semiconductors exhibit microscale heterogeneity. Therefore, experimental
techniques with high spatial resolution paired with models that capture
anisotropy and domain boundary behavior are needed. We develop a diffusion
tensor-based framework to analyze experimental photoluminescence (PL) diffusion
maps accounting for material microstructure. Specifically, we quantify both
carrier transport and recombination in single crystal and polycrystalline lead
halide perovskites by globally fitting diffusion maps, with spatial, temporal,
and PL intensity data. We reveal a 29% difference in principal diffusion
coefficients and alignment between electronically coupled grains for CH3NH3PbI3
polycrystalline films. This framework allows for understanding and optimizing
anisotropic energy transport in heterogeneous materials.

At the surfaces of materials, the bulk symmetry of the charge density is
broken and electron spill-out into the vacuum region creates a surface dipole.
Such spill-out has been historically calculated by Lang and Kohn [Phys. Rev. B
\textbf{3}, 1215 (1971)] using average electron density to sucessfully explain
the workfunction in metals. However, despite its initial success, in the fifty
years since it has not been extended beyond simple metals. Here we show that
the degree of charge spill-out is largely controlled by the innate bulk
workfunction $\phi_I$, which is the Fermi level position of $\it bulk$ relative
to the ideal vacuum. By incorporating the contribution of $\phi_I$ to the
surface dipole we show that Lang-Kohn's $\it jellium$ based approach can be
broadly expanded to understand the workfunction over a wide range of metals,
semiconductors, and insulators.

<br>
While valleys (energy extrema) are present in all band structures of solids,
their preeminent role in determining exciton resonances and dynamics in
atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) is unique. Using
two-dimensional coherent electronic spectroscopy, we find that exciton
decoherence occurs on a much faster time scale in MoSe$_2$ bilayers than that
in the monolayers. We further identify two population relaxation channels in
the bilayer, a coherent and an incoherent one. Our microscopic model reveals
that phonon-emission processes facilitate scattering events from the $K$ valley
to other lower energy $\Gamma$ and $\Lambda$ valleys in the bilayer. Our
combined experimental and theoretical studies unequivocally establish different
microscopic mechanisms that determine exciton quantum dynamics in TMDC
monolayers and bilayers. Understanding exciton quantum dynamics provides
critical guidance to manipulation of spin/valley degrees of freedom in TMDC
bilayers.

<br>
The control and manipulation of the valley and spin degrees of freedom have
received great interests in fundamental studies and advanced information
technologies. Compared with magnetic means, it is highly desirable to realize
more energy-efficient electric control of valley and spin. Using the
first-principles calculations, we demonstrate tunable valley and spin
degeneracy splittings in $\rm VSi_2N_4$ bilayers, with the aid of the layered
structure and associated electric control. Depending on different interlayer
magnetic couplings and stacking orders, the $\rm VSi_2N_4$ bilayers exhibit a
variety of combinations of valley and spin degeneracies. Under the action of a
vertical electric field, the degeneracy splittings become highly tunable for
both the sign and magnitude. As a result, a series of anomalous Hall currents
can be selectively realized with varied indices of valley and spin. These
intriguing features offer a practical way for designing energy-efficient
devices based on the couplings between multiple electronic degrees of freedom.

We consider the transverse field Ising model with additional all-to-all
interactions between the spins. We show that a mean-field treatment of this
model becomes exact in the thermodynamic limit, despite the presence of 1D
short-range interactions. This is established by looking for eigenstates as
coherent states with an amplitude that varies through the Hilbert space. We
study then the thermodynamics of the model and identify the different phases.
Among its peculiar features, this 1D model possesses a second-order phase

<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) Fermi gases subject to s-wave pairing, spin-orbit
coupling and large-enough Zeeman spin splitting are expected to form a
topological superfluid. While the general argument of bulk-boundary
correspondence assures the existence of topologically protected zero-energy
quasiparticle excitation at such a system's boundaries, it does not fully
determine the physical properties of the low-energy edge states. Here we
develop a versatile theoretical method for elucidating microscopic
characteristics of interface-localized subgap excitations within the
spin-resolved Bogoliubov-deGennes formalism. Our analytical results extend
current knowledge about edge excitations existing at the boundary between
vacuum and a 2D superfluid that is in its topological or nontopological regime.
We also consider the Andreev bound states that emerge at an interface between
coexisting time-reversal-symmetry-breaking topological and nontopological
superfluids and juxtapose their unusual features with those of
vacuum-boundary-induced edge excitations. Our theory provides a more complete
understanding of how the spin-orbit-coupled polarized 2D Fermi gas can be
tailored as a platform for realizing unconventional Majorana excitations.

Stochastic modeling of chemical reaction systems based on master equations
has been an indispensable tool in physical sciences. In the long-time limit,
the properties of these systems are characterized by stationary distributions
of chemical master equations. In this paper, we describe a novel method for
computing stationary distributions analytically, based on a parallel formalism
between stochastic chemical reaction systems and second quantization. Anderson,
Craciun, and Kurtz showed that, when the rate equation for a reaction network
admits a complex-balanced steady-state solution, the corresponding stochastic
reaction system has a stationary distribution of a product form of Poisson
distributions. In a formulation of stochastic reaction systems using the
language of second quantization initiated by Doi, product-form Poisson
distributions correspond to coherent states. Pursuing this analogy further, we
study the counterpart of squeezed states in stochastic reaction systems. Under
the action of a squeeze operator, the time-evolution operator of the chemical
master equation is transformed, and the resulting system describes a different
reaction network, which does not admit a complex-balanced steady state. A
squeezed coherent state gives the stationary distribution of the transformed
network, for which analytic expression is obtained.

Last year, we reported a perturbative theory of the Casimir-Lifshitz torque
between planar biaxially anisotropic materials in the retarded limit [Phys.
Rev. Lett. {\bf 120}, 131601 (2018)], which is applied here to study the change
of sign and magnitude of the torque with separation distance in biaxial black
phosphorus having excess charge carriers. The study is carried out both in
vacuum as well as in a background fluid medium. The presence of extra charge
carriers and that of an intervening fluid medium are both found to promote
enhancement of the magnitude of the torque between identical slabs. The degree
of enhancement of the magnitude of torque increases not only with an increased
carrier concentration but also with separation distance. In the non-identical
case when different planes of anisotropic black phosphorus face each other,
owing to the non-monotonic characteristic of the sign-reversal effect of the
torque, the enhancement by carrier addition and intervening medium also becomes
non-monotonic with distance. In the presence of a background medium, the
non-monotonic degree of enhancement of the torque with distance is observed
even between identical slabs.

<br>
We investigate a Geometric Brownian Information Engine (GBIE) in the presence
of an error-free feedback controller that transforms the information gathered
on the state of Brownian particles entrapped in monolobal geometric confinement
into extractable work. Outcomes of the information engine depend on the
reference measurement distance $x_m$, feedback site $x_f$ and the transverse
force $G$. We determine the benchmarks for utilizing the available information
in an output work and the optimum operating requisites for best work
extraction. Transverse bias force ($G$) tunes the entropic contribution in the
effective potential and hence the standard deviation ($\sigma$) of the
equilibrium marginal probability distribution. We recognize that the amount of
extracted work reaches a global maximum when $x_f = 2x_m$ with $x_m \sim
0.6\sigma$, irrespective of the extent of the entropic limitation. Because of
the higher loss of information during the relaxation process, the best
achievable work of a GBIE is lower in an entropic system. The feedback
regulation also bears the unidirectional passage of particles. The average
displacement increases with growing entropic control and is maximum when $x_m
\sim 0.81\sigma$. Finally, we explore the efficacy of the information engine, a
quantity that regulates the efficiency in utilizing the information acquired.
With $x_f=2x_m$, the maximum efficacy reduces with increasing entropic control
and shows a cross over from $2$ to $11/9$. We discover that the condition for
the best efficacy depends only on the confinement length scale along the
feedback direction. The broader marginal probability distribution accredits the
increased average displacement in a cycle and the lower efficacy in an
entropy-dominated system.

<i>Misaki Ozawa, Giulio Biroli</i>
<br>
We study the role of elasticity-induced facilitation on the dynamics of
glass-forming liquids by a coarse-grained two-dimensional model in which local
relaxation events, taking place by thermal activation, can trigger new
relaxations by long-range elastically-mediated interactions. By simulations and
an analytical theory, we show that the model reproduces the main salient facts
associated with dynamic heterogeneity and offers a mechanism to explain the
emergence of dynamical correlations at the glass transition. We also discuss
how it can be generalized and combined with current theories.

<h3>Effect of alloying on the microstructure, phase stability, hardness and  partitioning behavior of a new dual-superlattice nickel-based superalloy</h3>

<br>
A novel y-y'-y" dual-superlattice superalloy, with promising mechanical
properties up to elevated temperatures was recently reported. The present work
employs state of the art chemical and spatial characterization techniques to
study the effect systematic additions of Mo, W and Fe and variations in Nb and
Al contents have on the phase fraction, thermal stability, elemental
partitioning and mechanical properties. Alloys were produced through arc
melting followed by heat treatment. Multi-scale characterization techniques and
hardness testing were employed to characterize their microstructure, thermal
stability and mechanical properties. Alterations in such properties or in
elemental partitioning behaviour were then explained through thermodynamic
modelling.
A modest addition of 1.8 at.% Mo had a strong effect on the microstructure
and thermal stability: it minimized microstructural coarsening during heat
treatments while not significantly decreasing the y' solvus temperature. A
reduction of Nb by 0.6 at.%, strongly reduced the y" volume fraction, without
affecting the y' volume fraction. The reduced precipitate fraction led to a
significant reduction in alloy hardness. Fe, added to achieve better
processability and reduced material cost, decreased the y' solvus temperature
and caused rapid microstructural coarsening during heat treatments, without
affecting alloy hardness. A reduction of Al by 0.4 at.%, reduced the y' volume
fraction and the y' solvus temperature, also without affecting alloy hardness.
The addition of 0.9 at.% W decreased the y' solvus temperature but increased
both precipitate volume fractions. These data will be invaluable to optimize
current alloy design and to inform future alloy design efforts.

<br>
Standard Monte Carlo (MC) approach is often first method of choice for
testing the static properties of a system. However, there are a lot of
simulations where detailed dynamic information is required. The distribution of
states obtained on a short-time scale usually has different configuration than
the stationary ones. Here, we show that simple modification of MC algorithm,
named step Monte Carlo (sMC), allows to simulate processes far from equilibrium
and/or obtain information about dynamic properties of the system under
investigation. The details of sMC approach are explained for the case of simple
spin model. The comparison of its results with the ones obtained within the
frame of stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (Langevin dynamics) indicates the
correctness of sMC. In our opinion, the proposed here method can be applied to
simulate other processes, for example dynamics of classical atoms and complex
fluids, diffusion, nucleation, surface adsorption and crystal growth processes.

<br>
The restoration of symmetries is one of the most fascinating properties of
turbulence. We report a study of the emergence of isotropy in the
Gross-Pitaevskii model with anisotropic forcing. Inspired by recent
experiments, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a
cylindrical box driven along the symmetry axis of the trap by a spatially
uniform force. We introduce a measure of anisotropy $A(k,t)$ defined on the
momentum distributions $n(\boldsymbol{k},t)$, and study the evolution of
$A(k,t)$ and $n(\boldsymbol{k},t)$ as turbulence proceeds. As the system
reaches a steady state, the anisotropy, large at low momenta because of the
large-scale forcing, is greatly reduced at high momenta. While
$n(\boldsymbol{k},t)$ exhibits a self-similar cascade front propagation,
$A(k,t)$ decreases without such self-similar dynamics. Finally, our numerical
calculations show that the isotropy of the steady state is robust with respect
to the amplitude of the drive.

<br>
In ferroelectrics, complex interactions among various degrees of freedom
enable the condensation of topologically protected polarization textures. Known
as ferroelectric solitons, these particle-like structures represent a new class
of materials with promise for beyond CMOS technologies due to their ultrafine
size and sensitivity to external stimuli. Such polarization textures have
scarcely been reported in multiferroics. Here, we report a range of soliton
topologies in bismuth ferrite strontium titanate superlattices. High-resolution
piezoresponse force microscopy and Cs-corrected high-angle annular dark-field
scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal a zoo of topologies, and
polarization displacement mapping of planar specimens reveals center-convergent
and divergent topological defects as small as 3 nm. Phase field simulations
verify that some of these topologies can be classed as bimerons, with a
topological charge of plus and minus one, and first-principles-based effective
Hamiltonian computations show that the co-existence of such structures can lead
to non-integer topological charges, a first observation in a BiFeO3-based
system. Our results open new opportunities in multiferroic topotronics.

<h3>Dilution of the magnetic lattice in the Kitaev candidate  $α$-RuCl$_3$ by Rh$^{3+}$ doping</h3>

<br>
Magnetic dilution of a well-established Kitaev candidate system is realized
in the substitutional Ru$_{1-x}$Rh$_x$Cl$_3$ series ($x = 0.02-0.6$). Optimized
syntheses protocols yield uniformly-doped single crystals and polycrystalline
powders that are isostructural to the parental $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ as per X-ray
diffraction. The Rh content $x$ is accurately determined by the quantitative
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy technique with standards. We determine the
magnetic phase diagram of Ru$_{1-x}$Rh$_x$Cl$_3$ for in-plane magnetic fields
from magnetization and specific-heat measurements as a function of $x$ and
stacking periodicity, and identify the suppression of the magnetic order at $x
\approx 0.2$ towards a disordered phase, which does not show any clear
signature of freezing into a spin glass. Comparing with previous studies on the
substitution series Ru$_{1-x}$Ir$_x$Cl$_3$, we propose that chemical pressure
would contribute to the suppression of magnetic order especially in
Ru$_{1-x}$Ir$_x$Cl$_3$ and that the zigzag magnetic ground state appears to be
relatively robust with respect to the dilution of the
Kitaev--$\Gamma$--Heisenberg magnetic lattice. We also discovered a slight
dependence of the magnetic properties on thermal cycling, which would be due to
an incomplete structural transition.

<h3>Interface dynamics in the two-dimensional quantum Ising model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08992" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08992</a>
<br>
<i>Federico Balducci, Andrea Gambassi, Alessio Lerose, Antonello Scardicchio, Carlo Vanoni</i>
<br>
In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 120601] we have shown that the
dynamics of interfaces, in the symmetry-broken phase of the two-dimensional
ferromagnetic quantum Ising model, displays a robust form of ergodicity
breaking. In this paper, we elaborate more on the issue. First, we discuss two
classes of initial states on the square lattice, the dynamics of which is
driven by complementary terms in the effective Hamiltonian and may be solved
exactly: (a) strips of consecutive neighbouring spins aligned in the opposite
direction of the surrounding spins, and (b) a large class of initial states,
characterized by the presence of a well-defined "smooth" interface separating
two infinitely extended regions with oppositely aligned spins. The evolution of
the latter states can be mapped onto that of an effective one-dimensional
fermionic chain, which is integrable in the infinite-coupling limit. In this
case, deep connections with noteworthy results in mathematics emerge, as well
as with similar problems in classical statistical physics. We present a
detailed analysis of the evolution of these interfaces both on the lattice and
in a suitable continuum limit, including the interface fluctuations and the
dynamics of entanglement entropy. Second, we provide analytical and numerical
evidence supporting the conclusion that the observed non-ergodicity -- arising
from Stark localization of the effective fermionic excitations -- persists away
from the infinite-Ising-coupling limit, and we highlight the presence of a
timescale $T\sim e^{c L\ln L}$ for the decay of a region of large linear size
$L$. The implications of our work for the classic problem of the decay of a
false vacuum are also discussed.

<h3>The influence of magnetic vortices motion on the inverse ac Josephson  effect in asymmetric arrays</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08998" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08998</a>
<br>
<i>Boris Chesca, Marat Gaifullin, Daniel John, Jonathan Cox, Sergey Savelev, Christopher Mellor</i>
<br>
We report on the influence a preferential magnetic vortices motion has on the
magnitude of the inverse ac Josephson effect (the appearance of dc current
Shapiro steps) and the coherent operation of asymmetrical parallel arrays of
YBaCuO Josephson junctions (JJ) irradiated with microwave (MW) radiation in the
presence of an applied magnetic field B. The preferential direction of motion
of the Josephson vortices is due to the asymmetry-induced ratchet effect and
has a dramatic impact: for a particular positive dc bias current I when the
flux-flow is robust multiple pronounced Shapiro-steps are observed consistent
with a coherent operation of the array. This suggests an efficient
emission/detection of MW in related applications. In contrast, when we reverse
the direction of I, the flux-flow is reduced and the Shapiro-steps are strongly
suppressed due to a highly incoherent operation that suggests an inefficient
emission/detection of MW. Remarkably, by changing B slightly, the situation is
reversed: Shapiro steps are now suppressed for a positive I, while well
pronounced for a reverse current -I. Our results suggest that a preferential
vortex-flow has a very significant impact on the coherent MW operation of
superconducting devices consisting of either multiple JJs or a single long JJ
asymmetrically biased. This is particular relevant in the case of flux-flow
oscillators for sub-terahertz integrated-receivers, flux-driven Josephson
(travelling-wave) parametric amplifiers, or on-chip superconducting MW
generators which usually operate at bias currents in the Shapiro step region.

<h3>Particle-Environment Interactions In Arbitrary Dimensions: A Unifying  Analytic Framework To Model Diffusion With Inert Spatial Heterogeneities</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09014" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09014</a>
<br>
<i>Seeralan Sarvaharman, Luca Giuggioli</i>
<br>
Abridged abstract: Inert interactions between randomly moving entities and
spatial disorder play a crucial role in quantifying the diffusive properties of
a system. These interactions affect only the movement of the entities, and
examples range from molecules advancing along dendritic spines to anti-predator
displacements of animals due to sparse vegetation. Despite the prevalence of
such systems, a general framework to model the movement explicitly in the
presence of spatial heterogeneities is missing. Here, we tackle this challenge
and develop an analytic theory to model inert particle-environment interactions
in domains of arbitrary shape and dimensions. We use a discrete space
formulation which allows us to model the interactions between an agent and the
environment as perturbed dynamics between lattice sites. Interactions from
spatial disorder, such as impenetrable and permeable obstacles or regions of
increased or decreased diffusivity, as well as many others, can be modelled
using our framework. We provide exact expressions for the generating function
of the occupation probability of the diffusing particle and related transport
quantities such as first-passage, return and exit probabilities and their
respective means. We uncover a surprising property, the disorder indifference
phenomenon of the mean first-passage time in the presence of a permeable
barrier in quasi-1D systems. We demonstrate the widespread applicability of our
formalism by considering three examples that span across scales and
disciplines. (1) We explore an enhancement strategy of transdermal drug
delivery. (2) We associate the disorder with a decision-making process of an
animal to study thigmotaxis. (3) We illustrate the use of spatial
heterogeneities to model inert interactions between particles by modelling the
search for a promoter region on the DNA by transcription factors during gene
transcription.

<h3>Observation of nonreciprocal magnon Hanle effect</h3>

<br>
The precession of magnon pseudospin about the equilibrium pseudofield, the
latter capturing the nature of magnonic eigen-excitations in an
antiferromagnet, gives rise to the magnon Hanle effect. Its realization via
electrically injected and detected spin transport in an antiferromagnetic
insulator demonstrates its high potential for devices and as a convenient probe
for magnon eigenmodes and the underlying spin interactions in the
antiferromagnet. Here, we observe a nonreciprocity in the Hanle signal measured
in hematite using two spatially separated platinum electrodes as spin
injector/detector. Interchanging their roles was found to alter the detected
magnon spin signal. The recorded difference depends on the applied magnetic
field and reverses sign when the signal passes its nominal maximum at the
so-called compensation field. We explain these observations in terms of a spin
transport direction-dependent pseudofield. The latter leads to a
nonreciprocity, which is found to be controllable via the applied magnetic
field. The observed nonreciprocal response in the readily available hematite
films opens interesting opportunities for realizing exotic physics predicted so
far only for antiferromagnets with special crystal structures.

<h3>Lacing topological orders in two dimensions: exactly solvable models for  Kitaev's sixteen-fold way</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09054" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09054</a>
<br>
<i>Jin-Tao Jin, Jian-Jian Miao, Yi Zhou</i>
<br>
A family of two-dimensional (2D) spin-1/2 models have been constructed to
realize Kitaev's sixteen-fold way of anyon theories. Defining a one-dimensional
(1D) path through all the lattice sites, and performing the Jordan-Wigner
transformation with the help of the 1D path, we find that such a spin-1/2 model
is equivalent to a model with $\nu$ species of Majorana fermions coupled to a
static $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. Here each specie of Majorana fermions gives
rise to an energy band that carries a Chern number $\mathcal{C}=1$, yielding a
total Chern number $\mathcal{C}=\nu$. It has been shown that the ground states
are three (four)-fold topologically degenerate on a torus, when $\nu$ is an odd
(even) number. These exactly solvable models can be achieved by quantum
simulations.

<h3>Plastic ridge formation in a compressed thin amorphous film</h3>

<br>

<br>
We demonstrate that surface morphogenesis in compressed thin films may result
from spatially correlated plastic activity. A soft glassy film strongly
adhering to a smooth and rigid substrate and subjected to uniaxial compression,
indeed, does not undergo any global elastic pattern-forming instability, but
responds plastically via localized burst events that self-organize, leading to
the emergence of a series of parallel ridges transverse to the compression
axis. This phenomenon has been completely overlooked, but results from common
features of the plastic response of glasses, hence should be highly generic for
compressed glassy thin films.

<br>
Solid-state redox-driven phase transformation is associated with mass loss,
accommodated by vacancies that develop into pores. These influence the kinetics
of the redox reactions and phase transformation. We have investigated the
underlying structural and chemical mechanisms in and at pores in a combined
experimental-theoretical study, using the reduction of iron oxide by hydrogen
as a model system. The redox product (water vapor) accumulates in the pores and
shifts the local equilibrium at the pore back towards the parent material -
cubic-Fe1-xO (where x refers to Fe deficiency, space group Fm3-m). Our insights
explain the sluggish reduction of cubic-Fe1-xO and improve our understanding of
the kinetics of redox-driven phase transformations.

<br>
In this work, we report a novel design, one-transistor-one-inverter (1T1I),
to satisfy high speed and low power on-chip training requirements. By
leveraging doped HfO2 with ferroelectricity, a non-volatile inverter is
successfully demonstrated, enabling desired continuous weight transition
between negative and positive via the programmable threshold voltage (VTH) of
ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs). Compared with commonly used
designs with the similar function, 1T1I uniquely achieves pure on-chip-based
weight transition at an optimized working current without relying on assistance
from off-chip calculation units for signed-weight comparison, facilitating
high-speed training at low power consumption. Further improvements in linearity
and training speed can be obtained via a two-transistor-one-inverter (2T1I)
design. Overall, focusing on energy and time efficiencies, this work provides a
valuable design strategy for future FeFET-based computing-in-memory (CiM).

<h3>Orbital magnetoelectric effect in nanoribbons of transition metal  dichalcogenides</h3>

<br>

<br>
The orbital magnetoelectric effect (OME) generically refers to the appearance
of an orbital magnetization induced by an applied electric field. Here, we show
that nanoribbons of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with zigzag (ZZ)
edges may exhibit a sizeable OME activated by an electric field applied along
the ribbons' axis. We examine nanoribbons extracted from a monolayer (1L) and a
bilayer (2L) of MoS$_2$ in the trigonal (H) structural phase. Transverse
profiles of the induced orbital angular momentum accumulations are calculated
to first order in the longitudinally applied electric field. Our results show
that close to the nanoribbon's edge-state crossings energy, the orbital angular
momentum accumulations take place mainly around the ribbons' edges. They have
two contributions: one arising from the orbital Hall effect (OHE) and the other
consists in the OME. The former is transversely anti-symmetric with respect to
the principal axis of the nanoribbon, whereas the latter is symmetric, and
hence responsible for the resultant orbital magnetization induced in the
system. We found that the orbital accumulation originating from the OHE for the
1L-nanoribbon is approximately half that of a 2L-nanoribbon. Furthermore, while
the OME can reach fairly high values in 1L-TMD nanoribbons, it vanishes in the
2L ones that preserve spatial inversion symmetry. The microscopic features that
justify our findings are also discussed.

<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides are potential
candidates for ultrathin solid-state lubricants in low-dimensional systems
owing to their flatness, high in-plane mechanical strength, and low shear
interlayer strength. Yet, the effects of surface topography and surface
chemistry on the tribological properties of 2D layers are still unclear. In
this work, we performed a comparative investigation of nanoscale tribological
properties of ultra-thin highly-ordered PtSe2 layers deposited on the sapphire
substrates with the in-plane and out-of-plane crystallographic orientation of
the PtSe2 c-axis flakes, and also layers consisting of epitaxial PtSe2. PtSe2
c-axis orientation was found to has a moderate impact on the nanotribological
and morphological properties of PtSe2, in particular the change in the
alignment of the PtSe2 flakes from vertical (VA) to horizontal (HA) led to 1.3
times lower coefficient of friction. This observation was accompanied by an
increase in the root-mean-square surface roughness from 1.0 to 1.7 nm for the
HA and VA films, respectively. The epitaxial films with larger flakes showed
lower friction caused by lowering adhesion when compared to other investigated
films, whereas the friction coefficient was similar to films with HA flakes.
The observed trends in nanoscale friction is attributed to a different
distribution of PtSe2 structure.

We investigate signal propagation in a quantum field simulator of the
Klein-Gordon model realized by two strongly coupled parallel one-dimensional
quasi-condensates. By measuring local phononic fields after a quench, we
observe the propagation of correlations along sharp light-cone fronts. If the
local atomic density is inhomogeneous, these propagation fronts are curved. For
sharp edges, the propagation fronts are reflected at the system's boundaries.
By extracting the space-dependent variation of the front velocity from the
data, we find agreement with theoretical predictions based on curved geodesics
of an inhomogeneous metric. This work extends the range of quantum simulations
of non-equilibrium field dynamics in general spacetime metrics.

<br>
Hydrogen embrittlement in Zr alloy fuel cladding is a primary safety concern
for water based nuclear reactors. Here we investigated the stabilisation of
planar defects within the forming hydrides by Sn, the primary alloying element
of Zircaloy-4 used in the cladding. In order to explain formation of hydrides
and planar defects observed in our experiments, we performed atomic-scale ab
initio calculations focusing on the solute interactions with generalized
stacking faults in hcp $\alpha$-Zr and fcc zirconium hydrides. Our calculations
showed that an increase in Sn concentration leads to a stabilisation of
stacking faults in both $\alpha$-Zr and hydride phases. However, the solution
enthalpy of Sn is lower in the $\alpha$-Zr as compared to the other hydride
phases indicative of two competing processes of Sn depletion/enrichment at the
Zr hydride/matrix interface. This is corroborated by experimental findings,
where Sn is repelled by hydrides and is mostly found trapped at interfaces and
planar defects indicative of stacking faults inside the hydride phases. Our
systematic investigation enables us to understand the presence and distribution
of solutes in the hydride phases, which provides a deeper insight into the
microstructural evolution of such alloy's properties during its service
lifetime.

<br>
The Mullins effect is a common name for a family of intriguing inelastic
responses of various solid materials, in particular filled rubbers. Given the
importance of the Mullins effect, there have been many attempts to develop
mathematical models describing the effect. However, most of available models
focus exclusively on the mechanical response, and are restricted to the
idealised isothermal setting. We lift the restriction to isothermal processes,
and we propose a full thermodynamic framework for a class of phenomenological
models of the Mullins effect. In particular, we identify energy storage
mechanisms (Helmholtz free energy) and entropy production mechanisms that on
the level of stress--strain relation lead to the idealised Mullins effect or to
the Mullins effect with permanent strain. The models constructed within the
proposed framework can be used in the modelling of fully coupled
thermo-mechanical processes, and the models are guaranteed to be consistent
with the laws of thermodynamics.

<h3>Molecular motors enhance microtubule lattice plasticity</h3>

<br>
Microtubules are key structural elements of living cells that are crucial for
cell division, intracellular transport and motility. Recent experiments have
shown that microtubule severing proteins and molecular motors stimulate the
direct and localized incorporation of free tubulin into the shaft. However, a
mechanistic picture how microtubule associated proteins affect the lattice is
completely missing. Here we theoretically explore a potential mechanism of
lattice turnover stimulated by processive molecular motors in which a weak
transient destabilization of the lattice by the motor stepping promotes the
formation of mobile vacancies. In the absence of free tubulin the defect
rapidly propagates leading to a complete fracture. In the presence of free
tubulin, the motor walk induces a vacancy drift in the direction opposite of
the motor walk. The drift is accompanied by the direct and localized
incorporation of free tubulin along the trajectory of the vacancy. Our results
are consistent with experiments and strongly suggest that a weak lattice-motor
interaction is responsible for an augmented microtubule shaft plasticity.

Helical edge states in quantum spin Hall (QSH) materials are central building
blocks of topological matter design and engineering. Despite their principal
topological protection against elastic backscattering, the level of operational
stability depends on manifold parameters such as the band gap of the given
semiconductor system in the 'inverted' regime, temperature, disorder, and
crystal orientation. We theoretically investigate electronic and transport
properties of QSH edge states in large gap 1-T' WTe$_{2}$ monolayers. We
explore the impact of edge termination, disorder, temperature, and interactions
on experimentally addressable edge state observables, such as local density of
states and conductance. We show that conductance quantization can remain
surprisingly robust even for heavily disordered samples because of an
anomalously small edge state decay length and additional protection related to
the large direct gap allowed by glide symmetry. From the simulation of
temperature-dependent resistance, we find that moderate disorder enhances the
stability of conductance by localizing bulk states. We evaluate the edge state
velocity and Luttinger liquid parameter as functions of the chemical potential,
finding prospects for physics beyond linear helical Luttinger liquids in
samples with ultra-clean and well-defined edges.

Diffusion through semipermeable structures arises in a wide range of
processes in the physical and life sciences. Examples at the microscopic level
range from artificial membranes for reverse osmosis to lipid bilayers
regulating molecular transport in biological cells to chemical and electrical
gap junctions. There are also macroscopic analogs such as animal migration in
heterogeneous landscapes. It has recently been shown that one-dimensional
diffusion through a barrier with constant permeability $\kappa_0$ is equivalent
to snapping out Brownian motion (BM). The latter sews together successive
rounds of partially reflecting BMs that are restricted to either the left or
right of the barrier. Each round is killed when its Brownian local time exceeds
an exponential random variable parameterized by $\kappa_0$. A new round is then
immediately started in either direction with equal probability. In this paper
we use a combination of renewal theory, Laplace transforms and Green's function
methods to show how an extended version of snapping out BM provides a general
probabilistic framework for modeling diffusion through a semipermeable barrier.
This includes modifications of the diffusion process away from the barrier (eg.
stochastic resetting) and non-Markovian models of membrane absorption that kill
each round of partially reflected BM. The latter leads to time-dependent
permeabilities.

We study a system of a few ultracold bosons loaded into the states with
orbital angular momentum $l=1$ of a one-dimensional staggered lattice of rings.
Local eigenstates with winding numbers $+l$ and $-l$ form a Creutz ladder with
a real dimension and a synthetic one. States with opposite winding numbers in
adjacent rings are coupled through complex tunnelings, which can be tuned by
modifying the central angle $\phi$ of the lattice. We analyze both the
single-particle case and the few boson bound-state subspaces for the regime of
strong interactions using perturbation theory, showing how the geometry of the
system can be engineered to produce an effective $\pi$-flux through the
plaquettes. We find non-trivial topological band structures and many-body
Aharonov-Bohm caging in the $N$-particle subspaces even in the presence of a
dispersive single-particle spectrum. Additionally, we study the family of
models where the angle $\phi$ is introduced at an arbitrary lattice periodicity
$\Gamma$. For $\Gamma>2$, the $\pi$-flux becomes non-uniform, which enlarges
the spatial extent of the Aharonov-Bohm caging as the number of flat bands in
the spectrum increases. All the analytical results are benchmarked through
exact diagonalization.

We study how the three-dimensional shape of rigid filaments determines the
microscopic dynamics and macroscopic rheology of entangled semi-dilute Brownian
suspensions. To control the filament shape we use bacterial flagella, which are
micron-long helices assembled from flagellin monomers. We compare the dynamics
of straight rods, helical filaments, and shape diblock copolymers composed of
seamlessly joined straight and helical segments. Caged by their neighbors,
straight rods preferentially diffuse along their long axis, but exhibit
significantly suppressed rotational diffusion. Entangled helical filaments
escape their confining tube by corkscrewing through the dense obstacles created
by other filaments. By comparison, the adjoining segments of the rod-helix
shape-diblocks suppress both the translation and the corkscrewing dynamics, so
that shape-diblocks become permanently jammed at exceedingly low densities. We
also measure the rheological properties of semi-dilute suspensions and relate
their mechanical properties to the microscopic dynamics of constituent
filaments. In particular, rheology shows that an entangled suspension of shape
rod-helix copolymers forms a low-density glass whose elastic modulus can be
estimated by accounting for how shear deformations reduce the entropic degrees
of freedom of constrained filaments. Our results demonstrate that the
three-dimensional shape of rigid filaments can be used to design rheological
properties of semi-dilute fibrous suspensions.

<h3>Bond-dependent slave-particle cluster theory based on density matrix  expansion</h3>

We introduce a cluster slave-particle theory for Hubbard models based on a
density matrix expansion approach over overlapping real-space clusters. We
improve on prior slave-particle approaches by extending the description of the
slave operators to correctly describe particle hopping along bonds between
sites in the system. The interacting lattice slave-particle problem is then
turned into a set of overlapping real-space clusters which are solved
self-consistently and with appropriate physical matching constraints at shared
lattice sites between clusters. Our cluster expansion approach leads to an
exact description for short-ranged correlations with the cluster radius and
joins that smoothly to an approximated description of long-ranged correlations.
Specifically, it avoids making large errors caused by cutting bonds at cluster
boundaries. We test our theory in 1D and 2D $d$-$p$ Hubbard model and compare
it to exact ground-state benchmark results. Our method produces accurate total
energies, site occupancies, and double occupancies with modest computational
costs.

<h3>Origin and fate of the pseudogap in the doped Hubbard model</h3>

We investigate the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model at finite temperature
using controlled diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculations allowing for the
computation of spectral properties in the infinite-size limit and, crucially,
with arbitrary momentum resolution. We show that three distinct regimes are
found as a function of doping and interaction strength, corresponding to a
weakly correlated metal with properties close to those of the non-interacting
system, a correlated metal with strong interaction effects including a
reshaping of the Fermi surface, and a pseudogap regime at low doping in which
quasiparticle excitations are selectively destroyed near the antinodal regions
of momentum space. We study the physical mechanism leading to the pseudogap and
show that it forms both at weak coupling when the magnetic correlation length
is large and at strong coupling when it is shorter. In both cases, we show that
spin-fluctuation theory can be modified in order to account for the behavior of
the non-local component of the self-energy. We discuss the fate of the
pseudogap as temperature goes to zero and show that, remarkably, this regime
extrapolates precisely to the ordered stripe phase found by ground-state
methods. This handshake between finite temperature and ground-state results
significantly advances the elaboration of a comprehensive picture of the
physics of the doped Hubbard model.
