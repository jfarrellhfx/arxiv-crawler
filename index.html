<h3>Robust extended states in Anderson model on partially disordered random  regular graphs</h3>

In this work we analytically explain the origin of the mobility edge in
partially disordered ensemble of random regular graphs (RRG), with the
connectivity $d$, the position of which is under control. It is shown that the
mobility edge in the spectrum survives in some region in $(\beta,d)$-parameter
plane at infinitely large uniformly distributed disorder, where $\beta$ stands
for the fraction of %clean disordered nodes. The critical curve separating
%regimes with and without mobility edge extended and localized states is
derived analytically and confirmed numerically. The duality in the localization
properties between the sparse and extremely dense RRG has been found and
understood. The localization properties of the partially disordered RRG
supplemented by the non-reciprocity parameter as well as the chemical potential
for the $3$-cycles have been analyzed numerically.

<h3>Mixed-valence state approaching the single-impurity limit in  La-substituted SmB$_6$</h3>

One of the most intriguing aspects of $f$-electron systems is their
homogeneous mixed valence (MV) behavior. Despite extensive efforts, a
fundamental aspect which remains unsettled is the determination of the limiting
cases for which MV emerges, as highlighted by Haldane's theoretical proposal of
the occurrence of a MV state for a single $f$-type impurity in a Fermi sea of
$d$-electrons. Here we address this open question for SmB$_6$, a prototypical
system characterized by the interplay between two nearly-degenerate Sm$^{2+}$
and Sm$^{3+}$ configurations. By combining La substitution with angle resolved
photoemission (ARPES) and x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we track the
evolution of the mean Sm valence for the $f$-shell, $v_{Sm}$, in the
Sm$_x$La$_{1-x}$B$_6$ series. Upon substitution of Sm ions by trivalent
La$^{3+}$, we observe a linear decrease of valence fluctuations to an almost
complete suppression at $x$$\,$=$\,$0.2, with $v_{Sm}$$\,$$\sim$$\,$2;
surprisingly, by further reducing $x$, a re-entrant increase of $v_{Sm}$
develops for $x$$\,$<$\,$0.2, approaching a single-impurity-limit value of
$v_{imp}$$\,$$\sim$$\,$2.35. Such observation marks a stark deviation from a
monotonic evolution of $v_{Sm}$ across the entire series, as well as from the
expectation of its convergence to an integer value for
$x$$\,$$\rightarrow$$\,$0. Our study suggests the realization of a
$\textit{mixed-valence single-impurity state}$ in Sm$_x$La$_{1-x}$B$_6$, paving
the way to further considerations on the concept of MV and its influence on the
macroscopic properties of rare-earth compounds in the dilute-to-intermediate
impurity regime.

<h3>Thermal Hall Effect and Neutral Spinons in a Doped Mott Insulator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05711" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05711</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
In the pseudogap phase of the cuprate, a thermal Hall response of neutral
objects has been recently detected experimentally, which continuously persists
into the antiferromagnetic insulating phase. In this work, we study the
transport properties of neutral spinons as the elementary excitation of a doped
Mott insulator, which is governed by a mutual Chern-Simons topological gauge
structure. We show that such a chiral spinon as a composite of an $S=1/2$ spin
sitting at the core of a supercurrent vortex, can contribute to the thermal
Hall effect, thermopower, and Hall effect due to its intrinsic transverse
(cyclotron) motion under internal fictitious fluxes. In particular, the
magnitudes of the transport coefficients are phenomenologically determined by
two basic parameters: the doping concentration and $T_c$, quantitatively
consistent with the experimental measurements including the signs and
qualitative temperature and magnetic field dependence. Combined with the
predictions of the spinon longitudinal transport properties, including the
Nernst and spin Hall effects, a phenomenological description of the pseudogap
phase is established as characterized by the neutral spinon excitations, which
eventually become "confined" with an intrinsic superconducting transition at
$T_c$. Finally, within this theoretical framework, the "order to order" phase
transition between the superconducting and antiferromagnetic insulating phases
are briefly discussed, with the thermal Hall monotonically increasing into the
latter.

<h3>Cubic* criticality emerging from quantum loop model on triangular  lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05715" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05715</a>

<br>
<br>
Quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal examples of correlated systems
with local constraints, whose generic solutions for different lattice
geometries and parameter regimes are difficult to obtain due to the lack of
controlled methods to solve them in the thermodynamic limit, yet their
solutions are of immediate relevance towards both statistical and quantum field
theories and the fast-growing experiments in Rydberg atom arrays and quantum
moir\'e materials where the interplay between correlation and local constraints
give rise to a plethora of novel phenomena. In a recent work [1], it was found
via the sweeping cluster quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations and field theory
analysis that the triangular lattice quantum loop model (QLM) host a rich
ground state phase diagram with lattice nematic (LN), vison plaquette (VP)
crystals and the Z2 quantum spin liquid (QSL) close to the Rokhsar-Kivelson
(RK) point. Here, we focus on the continuous quantum critical point separating
the VP and QSL phases, and demonstrate via both the static and dynamic probes
in QMC simulations that this transition is of the (2+1)d Cubic* universality in
which the fractionalized visons in QSL condense to give rise to the crystalline
VP phase, meanwhile leaves its trace in the anomalously large anomalous
dimension exponent and pronounced continua in the dimer and vison spectra
compared with those at the conventional Cubic or O(3) quantum critical points.
The experiment proposal of the detection of such phenomena is discussed.

<h3>Spin-Hall effect due to the bulk states of topological insulators:  Extrinsic contribution to the conserved spin current</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05723" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05723</a>

The substantial amount of recent research into spin torques has been
accompanied by a revival of interest in the spin-Hall effect. This effect
contributes to the spin torque in many materials, including topological
insulator/ferromagnet devices, Weyl semimetals, and van der Waals
heterostructures. In general the relative sizes of competing spin torque
mechanisms remain poorly understood. Whereas a consensus is beginning to emerge
on the evaluation of a conserved spin current, the role of extrinsic disorder
mechanisms in the spin-Hall effect has not been clarified. In this work we
present a comprehensive calculation of the extrinsic spin Hall effect while
focussing on the bulk states of topological insulators as a prototype system
and employing a fully quantum mechanical formalism to calculate the proper spin
current. Our calculation of the proper spin current employs a 4x4 k.p
Hamiltonian describing the bulk states of topological insulators. At the same
time, we provide a qualitative explanation of the proper spin currents
calculated based on an effective $2\times2$ Hamiltonian obtained via a
Schrieffer-Wolf transformation. We find that the extrinsic contribution to the
proper spin current, driven by side jump, skew scattering and related
mechanisms, is of a comparable magnitude to the intrinsic contribution, making
it vital to take such disorder effects into account when seeking to understand
experiments. Among the scattering effects considered, side jump scattering is
the primary contributor to the extrinsic spin Hall effect. The total spin
susceptibility calculated here is too small to explain experimentally measured
spin torques, hence we expect the spin Hall effect to make a negligible
contribution to the spin torque in topological insulator structures.

<h3>Strong Pairing Originated from an Emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Berry Phase in  $\mathbf{La}_3 \mathbf{Ni}_2 \mathbf{O}_7$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05726" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05726</a>
<br>
<i>Jia-Xin Zhang, Hao-Kai Zhang, Yi-Zhuang You, Zheng-Yu Weng</i>
<br>
<br>
The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in $\mathrm{La}_3
\mathrm{Ni}_2 \mathrm{O}_7$ offers a fresh platform for exploring
unconventional pairing mechanisms. Based on a single-orbital bilayer model with
intralayer hopping $t_{\|}$ and interlayer super-exchange $J_{\perp}$, we
investigate the impact of the on-site Hubbard interaction $U$ in the Ni-3d
orbital on the binding strength of Cooper pairs. By extensive density matrix
renormalization group calculations, we observe a remarkable enhancement in
binding energy as much as $10$-$20$ times larger with $U/t_\|$ increasing from
$0$ to $12$ at $J_{\perp}/t_\|\sim 1$. We demonstrate that such a substantial
enhancement stems from a kinetic-energy-driven mechanism. Specifically, a
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ Berry phase will emerge at large $U$ due to the Hilbert space
restriction (Mottness), which strongly suppresses the mobility of single
particle propagation as compared to $U=0$. However, the kinetic energy of the
electrons (holes) can be greatly restored by forming an interlayer spin-singlet
pairing, which naturally results in a superconducting state even for relatively
small $J_\perp$. An effective hard-core bosonic model is further proposed to
provide an estimate for the superconducting transition temperature at the
mean-field level.

<h3>Circuit complexity and functionality: a thermodynamic perspective</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05731" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05731</a>
<br>
<i>Claudio Chamon, Andrei E. Ruckenstein, Eduardo R. Mucciolo, Ran Canetti</i>
<br>
<br>
We explore a link between complexity and physics for circuits of given
functionality. Taking advantage of the connection between circuit counting
problems and the derivation of ensembles in statistical mechanics, we tie the
entropy of circuits of a given functionality and fixed number of gates to
circuit complexity. We use thermodynamic relations to connect the quantity
analogous to the equilibrium temperature to the exponent describing the
exponential growth of the number of distinct functionalities as a function of
complexity. This connection is intimately related to the finite compressibility
of typical circuits. Finally, we use the thermodynamic approach to formulate a
framework for the obfuscation of programs of arbitrary length -- an important
problem in cryptography -- as thermalization through recursive mixing of
neighboring sections of a circuit, which can viewed as the mixing of two
containers with ``gases of gates''. This recursive process equilibrates the
average complexity and leads to the saturation of the circuit entropy, while
preserving functionality of the overall circuit. The thermodynamic arguments
hinge on ergodicity in the space of circuits which we conjecture is limited to
disconnected ergodic sectors due to fragmentation. The notion of fragmentation
has important implications for the problem of circuit obfuscation as it implies
that there are circuits with same size and functionality that cannot be
connected via local moves. Furthermore, we argue that fragmentation is
unavoidable unless the complexity classes NP and coNP coincide, a statement
that implies the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy of complexity theory to
its first level.

<h3>Conductance and thermopower fluctuations in interacting quantum dots</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05741" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05741</a>
<br>
<i>Henry Shackleton, Laurel E. Anderson, Philip Kim, Subir Sachdev</i>
<br>
<br>
We model an interacting quantum dot of electrons by a Hamiltonian with random
and all-to-all single particle hopping (of r.m.s. strength $t$) and
two-particle interactions (of r.m.s. strength $J$). For $t \ll J$, such a model
has a regime exhibiting the non-quasiparticle physics of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev
model at temperatures $E_{\rm coh} \ll T \ll J$, and that of a renormalized
Fermi liquid at $T \ll E_{\rm coh}$, where $E_{\rm coh} = t^2 / J$. Extending
earlier work has computed the mean thermoelectric properties of such a dot
weakly coupled to two external leads, we compute the sample-to-sample
fluctuations in the conductance and thermopower of such a dot, and describe
several distinct regimes. In all cases, the effect of the SYK interactions is
to reduce the strength of the sample-to-sample fluctuations. We also find that
in the regime where the mean transport co-efficients are determined only by the
value of $J$ at leading order, the sample-to-sample fluctuations can be
controlled by the influence of the smaller $t$.

<h3>Internal Levin-Wen models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05755" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05755</a>
<br>
<i>Vincentas Mulevicius, Ingo Runkel, Thomas Voß</i>
<br>
<br>
Levin-Wen models are a class of two-dimensional lattice spin models with a
Hamiltonian that is a sum of commuting projectors, which describe topological
phases of matter related to Drinfeld centres. We generalise this construction
to lattice systems internal to a topological phase described by an arbitrary
modular fusion category $\mathcal{C}$. The lattice system is defined in terms
of an orbifold datum $\mathbb{A}$ in $\mathcal{C}$, from which we construct a
state space and a commuting-projector Hamiltonian $H_{\mathbb{A}}$ acting on
it. The topological phase of the degenerate ground states of $H_{\mathbb{A}}$
is characterised by a modular fusion category $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{A}}$
defined directly in terms of $\mathbb{A}$. By choosing different $\mathbb{A}$'s
for a fixed $\mathcal{C}$, one obtains precisely all phases which are
Witt-equivalent to $\mathcal{C}$.
As special cases we recover the Kitaev and the Levin-Wen lattice models from
instances of orbifold data in the trivial modular fusion category of vector
spaces, as well as phases obtained by anyon condensation in a given phase
$\mathcal{C}$.

<h3>Anisotropic diffusion of radiation-induced self-interstitial clusters in  HCP zirconium: a molecular dynamics and rate-theory assessment</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05781" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05781</a>
<br>
<i>Amir Ghorbani, Yu Luo, Peyman Saidi, Laurent Karim Beland</i>
<br>
<br>
Under irradiation, Zr and Zr alloys undergo growth in the absence of applied
stress. This phenomenon is thought to be associated with the anisotropy of
diffusion of either or both radiation-induced point defects and defect
clusters. In this work, molecular dynamic simulations are used to study the
anisotropy of diffusion of self-interstitial atom clusters. Both
near-equilibrium clusters generated by aggregation of self-interstitial atoms
and cascade-induced clusters were considered. The cascade-induced clusters
display more anisotropy than their counterparts produced by aggregation. In
addition to 1-dimensional diffusing clusters, 2-dimensional diffusing clusters
were observed. Using our molecular dynamic simulations, the input parameters
for the "self-interstitial atom cluster bias" rate-theory model were estimated.
The radiation-induced growth strains predicted using this model are largely
consistent with experiments, but are highly sensitive to the choice of
interatomic interaction potential.

<h3>Selective formation of metastable polymorphs in solid-state synthesis</h3>

<br>
<br>
Metastable polymorphs often result from the interplay between thermodynamics
and kinetics. Despite advances in predictive synthesis for solution-based
techniques, there remains a lack of methods to design solid-state reactions
targeting metastable materials. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework to
predict and control polymorph selectivity in solid-state reactions. This
framework presents reaction energy as a rarely used handle for polymorph
selection, which influences the role of surface energy in promoting the
nucleation of metastable phases. Through in situ characterization and density
functional theory calculations on two distinct synthesis pathways targeting
LiTiOPO4, we demonstrate how precursor selection and its effect on reaction
energy can effectively be used to control which polymorph is obtained from
solid-state synthesis. A general approach is outlined to quantify the
conditions under which metastable polymorphs are experimentally accessible.
With comparison to historical data, this approach suggests that using
appropriate precursors could enable the synthesis of many novel materials
through selective polymorph nucleation.

<h3>Simulated multi-component metallic glasses akin to experiments</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study a three-component metallic glass system by means of a hybrid Monte
Carlo and Molecular Dynamics algorithm which allows the generation of
equilibrated samples for temperatures below the conventional glass transition
accessible by conventional methods. Using a realistic potential for the atomic
interactions we explore the kinetics, thermodynamics, and rheology of a
Cu-Zr-Al metallic glass composition in the ultrastable glass regime, showing in
particular how the configurational entropy depends on the temperature, and
compare it to the ubiquitous Cu-Zr one. Our results pave the way for
theoretical studies of complex metallic glasses and comparisons with
experiments.

<h3>Purely anharmonic charge-density wave in the 2D Dirac semimetal SnP</h3>

<br>
<br>
Charge density waves (CDWs) in two-dimensional (2D) materials have been a
major focus of research in condensed matter physics for several decades due to
their potential for quantum-based technologies. In particular, CDWs can induce
a metal-insulator transition by coupling two Dirac fermions, resulting in the
emergence of a topological phase. Following this idea, here we explore the
behavior of three different CDWs in a new 2D layered material, SnP, using both
density functional theory calculations and experimental synthesis to study its
stability. The layered structure of its bulk counterpart, Sn4P3, suggests that
the structure can be synthesized down to the monolayer by exfoliation or
chemical means. However, despite the stability of the bulk, the monolayer shows
unstable phonons at {\Gamma}, K, and M points of the Brillouin zone, which lead
to three possible charge-density-wave phases. All three CDWs lead to metastable
insulating phases, with the one driven by the the active phonon in the K point
being topologically non-trivial under strain. Strikingly, the ground-state
structure is only revealed due to the presence of strong anharmonic effects.
This, underscores the importance of studying CDWs beyond the conventional
harmonic picture, where the system's ground state can be elucidated solely from
the harmonic phonon spectra.

<h3>Choosing restart strategy at partial knowledge of process statistics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05877" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05877</a>
<br>
<i>Ilia Nikitin, Sergey Belan</i>
<br>
<br>
Optimization of a random processes by restart is a subject of active
theoretical research in statistical physics and has long found practical
application in computer science. Meanwhile, one of the key issues remains
largely unsolved: when should we restart a process whose detailed statistics
are unknown to ensure that our intervention will improve performance?
Addressing this query here we propose several constructive criteria for the
effectiveness of various protocols of non-instantaneous restart in the mean
completion time problem and in the success probability problem. Being expressed
in terms of a small number of easily estimated statistical characteristics of
the original process, these criteria allow informed restart decision based on
partial information.

Topological superconductors present an ideal platform for exploring
nontrivial superconductivity and realizing Majorana boundary modes in
materials. However, finding a single-phase topological material with nontrivial
superconducting states is a challenge. Here, we predict nontrivial
superconductivity in the pristine chiral metal RhGe with a transition
temperature of 5.8 K. Chiral symmetries in RhGe enforce multifold Weyl fermions
at high-symmetry momentum points and spin-polarized Fermi arc states that span
the whole surface Brillouin zone. These bulk and surface chiral states support
multiple type-II van Hove singularities that enhance superconductivity in RhGe.
Our detailed analysis of superconducting pairing symmetries involving Chiral
Fermi pockets in RhGe, indicates the presence of nontrivial superconducting
pairing. Our study establishes RhGe as a promising candidate material for
hosting mixed-parity pairing and topological superconductivity.

<h3>Coexistence of near-EF flat band and van Hove singularity in a two-phase  superconductor</h3>

<br>
<br>
In quantum many-body systems, particularly, the ones with large near-EF
density states, like flat bands or van Hove singularity (VHS), electron
correlations often give rise to rich phase diagrams with multiple
coexisting/competing orders occurring at similar energy scales. The recently
discovered locally noncentrosymmetric heavy fermion superconductor CeRh2As2 has
stimulated extensive attention due to its unusual H-T phase diagram, consisting
of two-phase superconductivity, antiferromagnetic order, and possible
quadrupole-density wave orders. However, despite its great importance, the
near-EF electronic structure remains experimentally elusive. Here, we provide
this key information by combining soft X-ray and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and atom-resolved DFT+U
calculations. With bulk-sensitive soft X-rays, we reveal quasi-2D hole- and 3D
electron- pockets with a pronounced nesting feature. Most importantly, we
observe a symmetry-protected fourfold VHS coexisting with the Ce 4f flat bands
near the EF, which, to the best of our knowledge, has never been reported
before. Such a rare coexistence is expected to lead to a large density of
states at the zone edge, enhancement in electron correlations, and a large
upper critical field of the odd-parity superconducting phase. Uniquely, it will
also result in a new type of f-VHS hybridization that alters the order and fine
electronic structure of the symmetry-protected VHS and flat bands. These
peculiarities offer important dimensions for understanding the reported rich
phase diagram and are discussed as an origin of superconductivity with two
phases. Our findings not only provide key insights into the nature of multiple
phases in CeRh$_2$As$_2$, but also open up new prospects for exploring the
novelties of many-body systems with f-VHS hybridization.

<h3>Silicon charge pump operation limit above and below liquid helium  temperature</h3>

Semiconductor tunable barrier single-electron pumps can produce output
current of hundreds of picoamperes at sub ppm precision, approaching the
metrological requirement for the direct implementation of the current standard.
Here, we operate a silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor electron pump up to a
temperature of 14 K to understand the temperature effect on charge pumping
accuracy. The uncertainty of the charge pump is tunnel limited below liquid
helium temperature, implying lowering the temperature further does not greatly
suppress errors. Hence, highly accurate charge pumps could be confidently
achieved in a $^4$He cryogenic system, further promoting utilization of the
revised quantum current standard across the national measurement institutes and
industries worldwide.

<h3>High-chirality Weyl nodes in hexagonal ReO$_3$</h3>

<br>
<i>Siyu Chen, Robert-Jan Slager, Bartomeu Monserrat, Adrien Bouhon</i>
<br>
<br>
The emergence of two-band nodal points (i.e. Weyl nodes) in gapless
topological phases only requires translational symmetry, however, their
necessary existence in the electronic band structure of materials can be
deduced when additional crystalline symmetries are present. In particular,
rotation symmetries have been known to be able to protect Weyl nodes of high
chirality. In this work, we identify ReO$_3$ as an ideal high-chirality Weyl
semimetal in which hexagonal screw symmetry plays a crucial role. To show this,
we revisit in detail the algebraic determination of the chirality of Weyl nodes
from the spinful irreducible representations of occupied bands, and combine it
with the complementary $C_{2}T$-symmetry-protected patch Euler class that
indicates the pinning of the Weyl nodes on $C_{2}T$-invariant planes.
Supporting our findings with first-principles calculations, we furthermore
reveal very clear Fermi arc signatures of the high-chirality Weyl nodes at the
Fermi level and for different surface orientations. We finally consider the
effect of strain upon which the reconfiguration of Weyl nodes further unveils
their Chern (i.e. high chirality) and Euler (i.e. symmetry-plane pinning)
topological nature.

We propose MatSci ML, a novel benchmark for modeling MATerials SCIence using
Machine Learning (MatSci ML) methods focused on solid-state materials with
periodic crystal structures. Applying machine learning methods to solid-state
materials is a nascent field with substantial fragmentation largely driven by
the great variety of datasets used to develop machine learning models. This
fragmentation makes comparing the performance and generalizability of different
methods difficult, thereby hindering overall research progress in the field.
Building on top of open-source datasets, including large-scale datasets like
the OpenCatalyst, OQMD, NOMAD, the Carolina Materials Database, and Materials
Project, the MatSci ML benchmark provides a diverse set of materials systems
and properties data for model training and evaluation, including simulated
energies, atomic forces, material bandgaps, as well as classification data for
crystal symmetries via space groups. The diversity of properties in MatSci ML
makes the implementation and evaluation of multi-task learning algorithms for
solid-state materials possible, while the diversity of datasets facilitates the
development of new, more generalized algorithms and methods across multiple
datasets. In the multi-dataset learning setting, MatSci ML enables researchers
to combine observations from multiple datasets to perform joint prediction of
common properties, such as energy and forces. Using MatSci ML, we evaluate the
performance of different graph neural networks and equivariant point cloud
networks on several benchmark tasks spanning single task, multitask, and
multi-data learning scenarios. Our open-source code is available at

Ferrimagnetic nodal-line semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ keeps the records
of colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and angular magnetoresistance (AMR). Here
we report tuning the electronic transport properties via doping and pressure in
(Mn$_{1-x}$Mg$_x$)$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$. As the substitution of nonmagnetic
Mg$^{2+}$ for magnetic Mn$^{2+}$, ferrimagnetic transition temperature $T_C$
gradually decreases, while the resistivity increases significantly. At the same
time, the CMR and AMR are both enhanced for the low-doping compositions (e.g.,
$x = 0.1$ and 0.2), which can be attributed to doping-induced broadening of the
band gap and a larger variation range of the resistivity when undergoing a
metal-insulator transition by applying a magnetic field along the $c$ axis. On
the contrary, $T_C$ rises with increasing pressure due to the enhancement of
the magnetic exchange interactions until a structural transition at $\sim$13
GPa. Meanwhile, the activation gap is lowered under pressure and the
magnetoresistance is decreased dramatically above 6 GPa where the gap is
closed. The results reveal that doping and pressure are effective methods to
tune the activation gap, and correspondingly, the CMR and AMR in nodal-line
semiconductors, providing an approach to investigate the magnetoresistance
materials for novel spintronic devices.

Disorder is the primary obstacle in current Majorana nanowire experiments.
Reducing disorder or achieving ballistic transport is thus of paramount
importance. In clean and ballistic nanowire devices, quantized conductance is
expected with plateau quality serving as a benchmark for disorder assessment.
Here, we introduce ballistic PbTe nanowire devices grown using the
selective-area-growth (SAG) technique. Quantized conductance plateaus in units
of $2e^2/h$ are observed at zero magnetic field. This observation represents an
advancement in diminishing disorder within SAG nanowires, as none of the
previously studied SAG nanowires (InSb or InAs) exhibit zero-field ballistic
transport. Notably, the plateau values indicate that the ubiquitous valley
degeneracy in PbTe is lifted in nanowire devices. This degeneracy lifting
addresses an additional concern in the pursuit of Majorana realization.
Moreover, these ballistic PbTe nanowires may enable the search for clean
signatures of the spin-orbit helical gap in future devices.

<h3>Anisotropy-assisted magnon condensation in ferromagnetic thin films</h3>

<br>
We theoretically demonstrate that adding an easy-axis magnetic anisotropy
facilitates magnon condensation in thin yttrium iron garnet (YIG) films.
Dipolar interactions in a quasi-equilibrium state stabilize room-temperature
magnon condensation in YIG. Even though the out-of-plane easy-axis anisotropy
generally competes with the dipolar interactions, we show that adding such
magnetic anisotropy may assist the generation of the magnon condensation
electrically, via the spin transfer torque mechanism. We use analytical
calculations and micromagnetic simulations to illustrate this effect. Our
results may explain the recent experiment on Bi-doped YIG and open a new
pathway toward application of current-driven magnon condensation in quantum
spintronics.

A fundamental issue of the Mott transition is how electrons behaving as
single particles carrying spin and charge in a metal change into those
exhibiting separated spin and charge excitations (low-energy spin excitation
and high-energy charge excitation) in a Mott insulator. This issue has
attracted considerable attention particularly in relation to high-temperature
cuprate superconductors, which exhibit electronic states near the Mott
transition that are difficult to explain in conventional pictures. Here, from a
new viewpoint of the Mott transition based on analyses of the Hubbard model, we
review anomalous features observed in high-temperature cuprate superconductors
near the Mott transition.

<h3>Temperature-driven change in band structure reflecting spin-charge  separation of Mott and Kondo insulators</h3>

The electronic band structure can change with temperature in Mott and Kondo
insulators, even without a phase transition. Here, to clarify the underlying
mechanism, the spectral function at nonzero temperature is studied. By
considering selection rules, the spin excited states of Mott and Kondo
insulators, whose excitation energies are lower than the charge gap, are shown
to emerge in the electronic spectral function at nonzero temperature,
exhibiting momentum-shifted magnetic dispersion relations from the band edges,
as in the case of the doping-driven Mott transition at zero temperature. Based
on this characteristic, we interpret the numerical results for
temperature-driven change in band structure in the one- and two-dimensional and
ladder Hubbard models and one-dimensional periodic Anderson model at half
filling obtained using cluster perturbation theory with the low-temperature
Lanczos method. This characteristic also explains why the band structures can
change with temperature even in the energy regime far higher than the
temperature and why spectral weights emerge in the energy regime within the
band gap, where excitation energies are lower than the lowest electronic
excitation energy from the ground state. Furthermore, if the band width of the
spin excitation is comparable to the band gap, the emergent electronic modes
can cross the Fermi level and gain spectral weight as the temperature
increases, which leads to an insulator-metal crossover. These features are
primarily caused by the spin excited states that are transparent in electronic
measurements at zero temperature, in contrast to the conventional view where
thermal effects on electron-added and removed states and static spin
correlations are considered to mainly affect the band structure. This
innovative perspective provides a different understanding from the conventional
view on electronic states at nonzero temperatures.

<h3>Three-Dimensional Quantum Hall Effect in Topological Amorphous Metals</h3>

<br>
<br>
Weyl semimetals have been theoretically predicted to become topological
metals with anomalous Hall conductivity in amorphous systems. However,
measuring the anomalous Hall conductivity in realistic materials, particularly
those with multiple pairs of Weyl points, is a significant challenge. If a
system respects time-reversal symmetry, then the anomalous Hall conductivity
even vanishes. As such, it remains an open question how to probe the Weyl band
like topology in amorphous materials. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that,
under magnetic fields, a topological metal slab in amorphous systems exhibits
three-dimensional quantum Hall effect, even in time-reversal invariant systems,
thereby providing a feasible approach to exploring Weyl band like topology in
amorphous materials. We unveil the topological origin of the quantized Hall
conductance by calculating the Bott index. The index is carried by broadened
Landau levels with bulk states spatially localized except at critical
transition energies. The topological property also results in edge states
localized at distinct hinges on two opposite surfaces.

<h3>Convergence to the asymptotic large deviation limit</h3>

Large deviation theory offers a powerful and general statistical framework to
study the asymptotic dynamical properties of rare events. The application of
the formalism to concrete experimental situations is, however, often restricted
by finite statistics. Data might not suffice to reach the asymptotic regime or
judge whether large deviation estimators converge at all. We here
experimentally investigate the large deviation properties of the stochastic
work and heat of a levitated nanoparticle subjected to nonequilibrium feedback
control. This setting allows us to determine for each quantity the convergence
domain of the large deviation estimators using a criterion that does not
require the knowledge of the probability distribution. By extracting both the
asymptotic exponential decay and the subexponential prefactors, we demonstrate
that singular prefactors significantly restrict the convergence
characteristics. Our results provide unique insight into the approach to the
asymptotic large deviation limit and underscore the pivotal role of singular
prefactors.

<h3>Electronic structure and optoelectronic properties of halide double  perovskites: Fundamental insights and design of a theoretical workflow</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06065" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06065</a>
<br>
<i>Mayank Gupta, Susmita Jana, B. R. K. Nanda</i>
<br>
<br>
Like single perovskites, halide double perovskites (HDP) have truly emerged
as efficient optoelectronic materials since they display superior stability and
are free of toxicity. However, challenges still exist due to either wide and
indirect bandgaps or parity-forbidden transitions in many of them. The lack of
understanding in chemical bonding and the formation of parity-driven valence
and conduction band edge states have hindered the design of optoelectronically
efficient HDPs. In this study, we have developed a theoretical workflow using a
multi-integrated approach involving ab-initio density functional theory (DFT)
calculations, model Hamiltonian studies, and molecular orbital picture leading
to momentum matrix element (MME) estimation. This workflow gives us detailed
insight into chemical bonding and parity-driven optical transition between edge
states. In the process, we have developed a band-projected molecular orbital
picture (B-MOP) connecting free atomic orbital states obtained at the
Hartree-Fock level and orbital-resolved DFT bands. From the B-MOP, we show that
the nearest neighbor cation-anion interaction determines the position of
atom-resolved band states, while the second neighbor cation-cation interactions
determine the shape and width of band dispersion and, thereby, MME. The latter
is critical to quantify the optical absorption coefficient. Considering both
B-MOP and MME, we demonstrate a mechanism of tailoring bandgap and optical
absorptions through chemical doping at the cation sites. Furthermore, the cause
of bandgap bowing, a common occurrence in doped HDPs, is explained by ascribing
it to chemical effect and structural distortion.

<br>
<br>
We study the time evolution of a $d$-wave superconductor irradiated by
intense circularly-polarized laser light. We consider the Floquet $t$-$J$ model
with time-periodic interactions, and investigate its mean-field dynamics by
formulating the time-dependent Gutzwiller approximation. We observe the
development of the $id_{xy}$-wave pairing amplitude along with the original
$d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave order upon gradual increasing of the field amplitude, owing
to the three-site term with broken time-reversal symmetry. We further
numerically construct the Floquet Hamiltonian for the steady state, with which
we identify the system as the fully-gapped $d+id$ superconducting phase with a
nonzero Chern number. We explore the low-frequency regime where the
perturbative approaches in the previous studies break down, and find that the
topological gap of an experimentally-accessible size can be achieved at much
lower laser intensities.

<br>
<br>
The influence of different Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) tensor
components on the static and dynamic properties of domain walls (DWs) in
magnetic nanowires is investigated using one dimensional collective coordinates
models and micromagnetic simulations. It is shown how the different
contributions of the DMI can be compactly treated by separating the symmetric
traceless, antisymmetric and diagonal components of the DMI tensor. First, we
investigate the effect of all different DMI components on the static DW tilting
in the presence and absence of in plane (IP) fields. We discuss the
possibilities and limitations of this measurement approach for arbitrary DMI
tensors. Secondly, the interplay of different DMI tensor components and their
effect on the field driven dynamics of the DWs are studied and reveal a
non-trivial effect of the Walker breakdown field of the material. It is shown
how DMI tensors combining diagonal and off-diagonal elements can lead to a
non-linear enhancement of the Walker field, in contrast with the linear
enhancement obtainable in the usual cases (interface DMI or bulk DMI).

<h3>A robust synthetic data generation framework for machine learning in  High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM)</h3>

<br>
<br>
Machine learning techniques are attractive options for developing
highly-accurate automated analysis tools for nanomaterials characterization,
including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). However,
successfully implementing such machine learning tools can be difficult due to
the challenges in procuring sufficiently large, high-quality training datasets
from experiments. In this work, we introduce Construction Zone, a Python
package for rapidly generating complex nanoscale atomic structures, and develop
an end-to-end workflow for creating large simulated databases for training
neural networks. Construction Zone enables fast, systematic sampling of
realistic nanomaterial structures, and can be used as a random structure
generator for simulated databases, which is important for generating large,
diverse synthetic datasets. Using HRTEM imaging as an example, we train a
series of neural networks on various subsets of our simulated databases to
segment nanoparticles and holistically study the data curation process to
understand how various aspects of the curated simulated data -- including
simulation fidelity, the distribution of atomic structures, and the
distribution of imaging conditions -- affect model performance across several
experimental benchmarks. Using our results, we are able to achieve
state-of-the-art segmentation performance on experimental HRTEM images of
nanoparticles from several experimental benchmarks and, further, we discuss
robust strategies for consistently achieving high performance with machine
learning in experimental settings using purely synthetic data.

<br>
<br>
Single crystals of the novel strontium osmate Sr3Os4O14 have been grown by
the hydrothermal method using opposed anvil high-pressure and high-temperature
technique. The reaction took place in sealed gold capsules at 3 GPa and a
temperature of 1100 C, with water acting as a solvent. The employed method
yields up to 1 mm crystals with quite uncommon double-terminated morphologies.
The crystal structure was identified as tetragonal by single-crystal X-ray
diffraction, with lattice parameters a = 12.2909(8) A and c = 7.2478(5) A. The
structural analysis suggests P42nm or P42/mnm as a possible space group. In
general, the structure belongs to the pyrochlore type and is composed of a
network of symmetrically arranged OsO6 octahedra. Resistivity measurements
evidence a metallic behavior, accompanied by a temperature-independent
paramagnetism. Heat capacity measurements reveal a slightly enhanced value of
the Sommerfeld coefficient 34 mJ/mol K2. Superconductivity has not been
observed down to 2 K.

<h3>Developing correlation-consistent numeric atom-centered orbital basis  sets for Krypton: Applications in RPA-based correlated calculations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06145" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06145</a>
<br>
<i>Sixian Yang, Igor Ying Zhang, Xinguo Ren</i>
<br>
<br>
Localized atomic orbitals are the preferred basis-set choice for large-scale
explicit correlated calculations, and high-quality hierarchical
correlation-consistent basis sets are a prerequisite for correlated methods to
deliver numerically reliable results. At present, Numeric Atom-centered Orbital
(NAO) basis sets with valence correlation consistency (VCC), designated as
NAO-VCC-$n$Z, are only available for light elements from hydrogen (H) to argon
(Ar) (\textit{New J. Phys.} \textbf{15}, 123033, (2013) ). In this work, we
extend this series by developing NAO-VCC-$n$Z basis sets for krypton (Kr), a
prototypical element in the fourth row of periodic table. We demonstrate that
NAO-VCC-$n$Z basis sets facilitate the convergence of electronic total-energy
calculations using the Random Phase Approximation (RPA), which can be used
together with a two-point extrapolation scheme to approach the
complete-basis-set (CBS) limit. Notably, the Basis Set Superposition Error
(BSSE) associated with the newly generated NAO basis sets is minimal, making
them suitable for applications where BSSE correction is either cumbersome or
impractical to do. After confirming the reliability of NAO basis sets for Kr,
we proceed to calculate the Helmholtz free energy for Kr crystal at the
theoretical level of RPA plus renormalized single excitation (rSE) correction.
From this, we derive the pressure-volume ($P$-$V$) diagram, which shows
excellent agreement with the latest experimental data. Our work demonstrates
the capability of correlation-consistent NAO basis sets for heavy elements,
paving the way toward numerically reliable correlated calculations for bulk
materials.

<h3>Distinguishing the importance of different charge trapping centers in  CaF2-based 2D material MOSFETs</h3>

<br>
<br>
Crystalline CaF2 is drawing huge attentions due to its great potential of
being the gate dielectric of two-dimensional (2D) material MOSFETs. It is
deemed to be much superior than boron nitride and traditional SiO2 because of
its larger dielectric constant, wider band gap, and lower defect density.
Nevertheless, the CaF2-based MOSFETs fabricated in experiment still present
notable reliability issues, and the underlying reason remains unclear. Here we
studied the various intrinsic defects and adsorbates in CaF2/MoS2 and
CaF2/MoSi2N4 interface systems to reveal the most active charge trapping
centers in CaF2-based 2D material MOSFETs. An elaborate Table that comparing
the importance of different defects in both n-type and p-type device is
provided. Most impressively, the oxygen molecules adsorbed at the interface or
surface, which are inevitable in experiments, are as active as the intrinsic
defects in channel materials, and they can even change the MoSi2N4 to p-type
spontaneously. These results mean that it is necessary to develop high vacuum
packaging process as well as preparing high-quality 2D materials for better
device performance.

In the search for stable lead (Pb) free perovskites, Vacancy ordered double
perovskite (VODP), A$_2$BX$_6$ has emerged as a promising class of materials
for solar harvesting owing to their nontoxicity, better stability, and unique
optoelectronic properties. Here, we present the stability and the key physical
attributes of few selected compounds in a systematic manner using
state-of-the-art first-principle calculations. A careful structural and
stability analysis via simulating convex hull and compositional phase diagrams
for different structural prototypes discloses 14 stable and 1 metastable
compounds in this class. The electronic structure calculations using hybrid
functional reveals six compounds to acquire band gap in the ideal visible
region. These six compounds, namely Cs$_2$SnI$_6$, Cs$_2$PdI$_6$,
Cs$_2$TeI$_6$, Cs$_2$TiI$_6$, Cs$_2$PtI$_6$, and Cs$_2$PdBr$_6$, show high
optical absorption ($\approx$ 10$^{5}$ cm $^{-1}$) giving rise to high
spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency, SLME (15-23\%) in the thin-film
thickness range. Close inspection of transport properties reveals polar optical
phonon scattering to be the dominant mechanism limiting the overall mobility.
Further analysis of the polaron excitations discloses the possibility of large
polaron formation at low to moderate defect concentrations. At high defect
concentrations, ionized impurity scattering takes over. This suggests that, a
simulation based guided control of defect concentrations during synthesis can
yield a desired candidate for promissing device application. Additionally, few
selected compounds show moderate to high electron mobility values ($\sim$13-63
cm$^2$V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$) at room temperature. Overall, the present study paves
an important path to help design VODP as Pb-free potential candidates for
future optoelectronic applications.

<h3>Effect of Rare-earth Element Substitution in Superconducting  R$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Under Pressure</h3>

<br>
<br>
Recently, high temperature ($T_c\approx 80$K) superconductivity (SC) has been
discovered in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) under pressure. Question arises whether
the transition temperature $T_c$ could be further enhanced under suitable
conditions. A possible route for realizing higher $T_c$ is element
substitution. Similar SC could appear in rare-earth (RE) R$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (RNO,
R=RE element) material series under pressure. The electronic properties in the
RNO materials are dominated by the Ni $3d$ orbitals in the bilayer NiO$_2$
plane. In the strong coupling limit, the SC could be fully characterized by a
bilayer single $3d_{x^2-y^2}$-orbital $t$-$J_{\parallel}$-$J_{\perp}$ model.
Under RE element substitution from La to RE element, the lattice constant
decreases and the electronic hopping increases, leading to stronger
superexchanges between the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Based on the slave-boson
mean-field theory, we explore the pairing nature and the evolution of $T_c$ in
RNO materials. Consequently, it is found that the element substitution does not
alter the pairing nature, i.e. the inter-layer $s$-wave pairing is always
favored in RNO. However, the $T_c$ increases from La to Sm and a nearly doubled
$T_c$ is achieved for SmNO. This work provides evidence for possible higher
$T_c$ R$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ materials, which may be realized in further experiments.

Xenes, two-dimensional (2D) monolayers composed of a single element, with
graphene as a typical representative, have attracted widespread attention. Most
of the previous Xenes, X from group-IIIA to group-VIA elements have bonding
characteristics of covalent bonds. In this work, we for the first time unveil
the pivotal role of a halogen bond, which is a distinctive type of bonding with
interaction strength between that of a covalent bond and a van der Waals
interaction, in 2D group-VIIA monolayers. Combing the ingenious
non-edge-to-edge tiling theory and state-of-art ab initio method with refined
local density functional M06-L, we provide a precise and effective bottom-up
construction of 2D iodine monolayer sheets, iodinenes, primarily governed by
halogen bonds, and successfully design a category of stable iodinenes,
encompassing herringbone, Pythagorean, gyrated truncated hexagonal, i.e.
diatomic-kagome, and gyrated hexagonal tiling pattern. These iodinene
structures exhibit a wealth of properties, such as flat bands, nontrivial
topology, and fascinating optical characteristics, offering valuable insights
and guidance for future experimental investigations. Our work not only unveils
the unexplored halogen bonding mechanism in 2D materials but also opens a new
avenue for designing other non-covalent bonding 2D materials.

The discoveries of two-dimensional ferromagnetism and magnetic semiconductors
highly enrich the magnetic material family for constructing spin-based
electronic devices but with an acknowledged challenge that the Curie
temperature (Tc) is usually far below room temperature. Many efforts such as
voltage control and magnetic ion doping are currently underway to enhance the
functional temperature, in which the involvement of additional electrodes or
extra magnetic ions limits their plenty of applications in practical devices.
Here we demonstrate that the magnetic proximity, a robust effect but with
elusive mechanisms, can induce room-temperature ferromagnetism at the interface
between sputtered Pt and semiconducting Fe3GeTe2, both of which do not show
ferromagnetism at 300 K. The independent electrical and magnetization
measurements, structure analysis, and control samples with Ta highlighting the
role of Pt confirm that the ferromagnetism with the Tc of above 400 K arises
from the Fe3GeTe2/Pt interfaces, rather than Fe aggregation or other artificial
effects. Moreover, contrary to conventional ferromagnet/Pt structures, the spin
current generated by the Pt layer is enhanced more than two times at the
Fe3GeTe2/Pt interfaces, indicating the potential applications of the unique
proximity effect in building high-efficient spintronic devices. These results
may pave a new avenue to create room-temperature functional spin devices based
on low-Tc materials and provide clear evidences of magnetic proximity effects
by using non-ferromagnetic materials.

We introduce a general method to determine the large scale non-equilibrium
steady-state properties of one-dimensional multi-species driven diffusive
systems with open boundaries, generalizing thus the max-min current principle
known for systems with a single type of particles. This method is based on the
solution of the Riemann problem of the associated system of conservation laws.
We demonstrate that the effective density of a reservoir depends not only on
the corresponding boundary hopping rates but also on the dynamics of the entire
system, emphasizing the interplay between bulk and reservoirs. We highlight the
role of Riemann variables in establishing the phase diagram of such systems. We
apply our method to three models of multi-species interacting particle systems
and compare the theoretical predictions with numerical simulations.

fluctuating quantities and for the dynamical activity of nonequilibrium systems
described by Markovian master equations. As special limiting cases, KSE
reproduces the so-called kinetic uncertainty relation and its multivariate
extension. To derive KSE, we also show a kinetic generalization of fluctuation
theorem, and an equality for the susceptibility and the observable-frenetic
covariance. Hence, KSE provides a master relation of these nonequilibrium
kinetic relations.

<h3>Towards analogue black hole merger</h3>

We study the effects of the wavevector-dependent losses on polariton
condensates. We demonstrate that because of these losses, a single vortex
becomes a center of a convergent flow, which allows describing it by an
analogue Kerr black hole metric with a dynamically evolving origin. For a pair
of vortices, we find an analogue of the 3rd Kepler's law and estimate the
emission rate of the gravitational waves. We simulate an analogue of the
inspiral phase of a black hole merger. Our work therefore suggests that
polariton condensates with quantum vortices represent a setting with a fully
self-consistent dynamical metric for broad analogue studies.

In this work, we study the quench dynamics of quantum phases of ultracold
neutral bosons trapped in optical lattices. We investigate the validity of the
Kibble-Zurek (KZ) scaling laws with the single-site Gutzwiller mean-field
(SGMF) and cluster Gutzwiller mean-field (CGMF) theory. With CGMF, we note the
evolution of the dynamical wavefunction in the ``impulse" regime of the
Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We obtain the power law scalings for the crossover time
and defect density with the quench rate predicted by KZ scaling laws. The
critical exponents obtained from dynamics are close to their equilibrium
values. Furthermore, it is observed that the obtained dynamical critical
exponent $z$ improves towards the equilibrium value with increasing cluster
sizes in CGMF.

<h3>Probing spatial variation of magnetic order in strained SrMnO$_3$ thin  films using Spin Hall Magnetoresistance</h3>

SrMnO$_{3}$ (SMO) is a magnetic insulator and predicted to exhibit a
multiferroic phase upon straining. Strained films of SMO display a wide range
of magnetic orders, ranging from G-type to C-and A-type, indicative of
competing magnetic interactions. The potential of spin Hall magnetoresistance
(SMR) is exploited as an electrical probe for detecting surface magnetic order,
to read surface magnetic moments in SMO and its spatial variation, by designing
and positioning electrodes of different sizes on the film. The findings
demonstrate antiferromagnetic domains with different magnetocrystalline
anisotropies along with a ferromagnetic order, where the magnetization arises
from double exchange mediated ferromagnetic order and canted antiferromagnetic
moments. Further, from a complete analysis of the SMR, a predominance of
antiferromagnetic domain sizes of 3.5 $\mu$m$^2$ is extracted. This work
enhances the applicability of SMR in unraveling the richness of correlation
effects in complex oxides, as manifested by the detection of coexisting and
competing ground states and lays the foundation for the study of magnon
transport for different magnetoelectric based computing applications.

We study the efficiency of both classical and quantum heat engines using an
Ising model as working fluid and the mean field equation for its
non-equilibrium dynamics, formulated earlier [1,2] for the study of dynamical
hysteresis in quantum Ising model. We studied numerically the Ising magnet's
equation of motion for a four stroke Otto engine and compared the efficiencies
in both classical and quantum limit using a quasi-static approximation, and
they fit well with the numerical estimates. In both cases, the efficiencies are
much less than the corresponding Carnot value.

<h3>Detecting molecular folding from noise measurements</h3>

Detecting conformational transitions in molecular systems is key to
understanding biological processes. Here, we investigate the force variance in
single-molecule pulling experiments as an indicator of molecular folding
transitions. We consider cases where Brownian force fluctuations are large,
masking the force rips and jumps characteristic of conformational transitions.
We compare unfolding and folding data for DNA hairpin systems of loop sizes
4,8, and 20 and the 110 amino acids protein barnase, finding conditions that
facilitate the detection of folding events at low forces where the
signal-to-noise ratio is low. In particular, we discuss the role of temperature
as a useful parameter to improve the detection of folding transitions in
entropically driven processes where folding forces are temperature-independent.
The force variance approach might be extended to detect the elusive
intermediate states in RNA and protein folding.

<h3>On the coexistence of localized and delocalized states in the Anderson  model with long hops</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06345" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06345</a>
<br>
<i>V. Temkin, A. S. Ioselevich</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the states with different energies $E$ arising due to fluctuations
of disorder potential in the systems with long-range hopping. We demonstrate
that, in contrast to the conventional systems with short-range hops, the
optimal fluctuations of disorder, responsible for creation of the states in the
gap, do not become shallow and long-range when $E$ approaches the band edge
($E\to 0$), but remain deep and short-range ones. The corresponding electronic
wave functions also remain short-range localized for all $E<0$ up to the very
band edge. The most intriguing question that we address in this paper is the
structure of the wave functions slightly above $E=0$. To get a comprehensive
answer to this question it was necessary to perform the corresponding study for
a finite system of size $L$. We demonstrate that upon crossing the $E=0$ level
the wave functions $\Psi_E$ undergo transformation from localized to
quasilocalized type. The quasilocalized $\Psi_{E>0}(r)$ consists of two parts:
(a) a short range core which is basically the same as $\Psi_{E=0}$, (b) a
delocalized tail that spans to the boundaries of the system. The amplitude of
the tail is small for small $E$, but the tail decreases with $r$ too slowly, so
that its contribution to the norm of the wave function dominates for large
enough systems with $L\gg L_c(E)$; such systems therefore behave as delocalized
ones. On the other hand, small systems with $L\ll L_c(E)$ are dominated by
localized core and are effectively localized. Moreover, if one is interested in
the Inverse Participation Ratio, then the latter is dominated by the localized
core of the wave function even for large systems with $L\gg L_c(E)$.

We report the observation of the metallic niobium migration within the molten
Cu-Nb alloy mass on the synthesis of nano-granular Cuxwt\%Nb evolution, we
prepared a series of granular samples by rapidly cooling a molten mixture of
Cuxwt\%Nb, where the niobium concentration varied (x=3,5,15,20). Our main goal
in this work was not only to establish a systematic, innovative and robust
method to obtaining good quality samples, but also provide a clear recipe for
obtaining similar systems to the investigations of their interesting physical
properties. Beyond the understanding of the Cocoon Effect in Niobium-Copper
alloys, we include a wide complementary elsewhere investigation into the very
interesting and rich superconducting properties exhibited by the Niobium-Copper
alloy. By employing a robust synthesis method, we successfully obtained samples
characterized by well-defined spherical nano-precipitates of niobium, featuring
regular sizes and grain spacing. Our study contributes not only to our
understanding of the Niobium-Copper molten phase separation, micro-structure
and the Cocoon Effect in these metallic alloys, but also sheds light on the
intricate and important implications for the development and optimization of
good quality granular metallic alloys for various applications. From our work,
we obtained very impressive micro structural results, such as: $ d_{m} $ = 1.2
\mu, $ D_{m} $\le 2.2 \mu$m$ \ and \ \rho =1.785 \mu$m^{2}$, where $ d_{m} $ is
the distance between Niobium grains, $D_{m}$ is the mean diameter of Niobium
grains and \rho$ is the Niobium grain mean density in the Copper matrix.

<h3>A universal interatomic potential for perovskite oxides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06391" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06391</a>

<br>
<br>
With their celebrated structural and chemical flexibility, perovskite oxides
have served as a highly adaptable material platform for exploring emergent
phenomena arising from the interplay between different degrees of freedom.
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations leveraging classical force fields, commonly
depicted as parameterized analytical functions, have made significant
contributions in elucidating the atomistic dynamics and structural properties
of crystalline solids including perovskite oxides. However, the force fields
currently available for solids are rather specific and offer limited
transferability, making it time-consuming to use MD to study new materials
systems since a new force field must be parameterized and tested first. The
lack of a generalized force field applicable to a broad spectrum of solid
materials hinders the facile deployment of MD in computer-aided materials
discovery (CAMD). Here, by utilizing a deep-neural network with a
self-attention scheme, we have developed a unified force field that enables MD
simulations of perovskite oxides involving 14 metal elements and conceivably
their solid solutions with arbitrary compositions. Notably, isobaric-isothermal
ensemble MD simulations with this model potential accurately predict the
experimental phase transition sequences for several markedly different
ferroelectric oxides, including a 6-element ternary solid solution,
Pb(In$_{1/2}$Nb$_{1/2}$)O$_3$--Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_3$--PbTiO$_3$. We
believe the universal interatomic potential along with the training database,
proposed regression tests, and the auto-testing workflow, all released
publicly, will pave the way for a systematic improvement and extension of a
unified force field for solids, potentially heralding a new era in CAMD.

<h3>Orbital-selective effect of spin reorientation on the Dirac fermions in  a three-dimensional kagome ferromagnet Fe$_3$Ge</h3>

<br>
<br>
Kagome magnets provide a fascinating platform for the realization of
correlated topological quantum phases under various magnetic ground states.
However, the intricate effect of the magnetic spin configurations on the
characteristic electronic structure directly from the kagome lattice layer
remains still elusive. Here, utilizing angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we report the
spectroscopic evidence for the spin-reorientation effect of a kagome
ferromagnet Fe$_3$Ge, which is composed only of the kagome planes. There are
two kinds of kagome-derived Dirac fermions due to the structural
three-dimensionality -- one is less dispersive ($k_z$ $\sim$ 0) and the other
disperses linearly ($k_z$ $\sim$ $\pi$). As the Fe moments cant from the $c$
axis into the $ab$ plane upon cooling, the Dirac fermion in $k_z$ $\sim$ 0
plane with a mixture of the Fe-$3d_{xy}$ and Fe-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ components
evolves from gapped into nearly gapless, while the Dirac cone in $k_z$ $\sim$
$\pi$ plane mainly of the Fe-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital character remains intact,
suggesting that the effect of spin reorientation on the Dirac fermions has an
orbital selectivity. Our unambiguous observations provide a feasible route to
design and manipulate the mass of Dirac fermions for realizing the novel
quantum phases. We also perform comparative studies between the
non-charge-ordered Fe$_3$Ge and its sibling compound FeGe, a newly established
charge-density-wave kagome magnet, the results suggest that the
orbital-selective van Hove singularities near the Fermi level play an
indispensable part in driving the charge order on a magnetic kagome lattice.

<h3>Tunable Circular Photogalvanic and Photovoltaic Effect in 2D Tellurium  with Different Chirality</h3>

<br>
<br>
Chirality arises from the asymmetry of matters, where two counterparts are
the mirror image of each other. The interaction between circular-polarization
light and quantum materials is enhanced in chiral space groups due to the
structural chirality. Tellurium (Te) possesses the simplest chiral crystal
structure, with Te atoms covalently bonded into a spiral atomic chain (left- or
right-handed) with a periodicity of three. Here, we investigate the tunable
circular photo-electric responses in 2D Te field-effect transistor with
different chirality, including the longitudinal circular photogalvanic effect
induced by the radial spin texture (electron-spin polarization parallel to the
electron momentum direction) and the circular photovoltaic induced by the
chiral crystal structure (helical Te atomic chains). Our work demonstrates the
controllable manipulation of the chirality degree of freedom in materials.

Valence transitions in strongly correlated electron systems are caused by
orbital hybridization and Coulomb interactions between localized and
delocalized electrons. The transition can be triggered by changes in the
electronic structure and is sensitive to temperature variations, applications
of magnetic fields, and physical or chemical pressure. Launching the transition
by photoelectric fields can directly excite the electronic states and thus
provides an ideal platform to study the correlation among electrons on
ultrafast timescales. The EuNi$_2$(Si$_{0.21}$Ge$_{0.79}$)$_2$ mixed-valence
metal is an ideal material to investigate the valence transition of the Eu ions
via the amplified orbital hybridization by the photoelectric field on
sub-picosecond timescales. A direct view on the 4$f$ electron occupancy of the
Eu ions is required to understand the microscopic origin of the transition.
Here we probe the 4$f$ electron states of EuNi$_2$(Si$_{0.21}$Ge$_{0.79}$)$_2$
at the sub-ps timescale after photoexcitation by X-ray absorption spectroscopy
across the Eu $M_5$-absorption edge. The observed spectral changes due to the
excitation indicate a population change of total angular momentum multiplet
states $J$ = 0, 1, 2, and 3 of Eu$^{3+}$, and the Eu$^{2+}$ $J$ = 7/2 multiplet
state caused by an increase in 4$f$ electron temperature that results in a 4$f$
localization process. This electronic temperature increase combined with
fluence-dependent screening accounts for the strongly non-linear effective
valence change. The data allow us to extract a time-dependent determination of
an effective temperature of the 4$f$ shell, which is also of great relevance in
the understanding of metallic systems' properties, such as the ultrafast
demagnetization of ferromagnetic rare-earth intermetallics and their
all-optical magnetization switching.

The charge density wave (CDW) material 1T-TaS$_2$ exhibits a pulse-induced
insulator-to-metal transition, which shows promise for next-generation
electronics such as memristive memory and neuromorphic hardware. However, the
rational design of TaS$_2$ devices is hindered by a poor understanding of the
switching mechanism, the pulse-induced phase, and the influence of material
defects. Here, we operate a 2-terminal TaS$_2$ device within a scanning
transmission electron microscope (STEM) at cryogenic temperature, and directly
visualize the changing CDW structure with nanoscale spatial resolution and down
to 300 {\mu}s temporal resolution. We show that the pulse-induced transition is
driven by Joule heating, and that the pulse-induced state corresponds to nearly
commensurate and incommensurate CDW phases, depending on the applied voltage
amplitude. With our in operando cryo-STEM experiments, we directly correlate
the CDW structure with the device resistance, and show that dislocations
significantly impact device performance. This work resolves fundamental
questions of resistive switching in TaS$_2$ devices critical for engineering
reliable and scalable TaS$_2$ electronics.

We investigate the quantum transport dynamics of electrons in a multi-path
Aharonov-Bohm interferometer comprising several parallel graphene nanoribbons.
At low magnetic field strengths, the conductance displays a complex oscillatory
behavior stemming from the interference of electron wave functions from
different paths, reminiscent of the diffraction grating in optics. With
increasing magnetic field strength, certain nanoribbons experience transport
blockade, leading to conventional Aharonov-Bohm oscillations arising from
two-path interference. We also discuss the impact of edge effects and the
influence of finite temperature. Our findings offer valuable insights for
experimental investigations of quantum transport in multi-path devices and
their potential application for interferometry and quantum sensing.

<h3>Kubo formula for dc conductivity in the presence of spin-orbit coupling:  a revision</h3>

<br>
<i>I. A. Ado, M. Titov, Rembert A. Duine, Arne Brataas</i>
<br>
<br>
We revise the Kubo formula for the electric dc conductivity in the presence
of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We discover that each velocity operator that
enters this formula differs from $\partial H/\partial \boldsymbol p$, where $H$
is the Hamiltonian and $\boldsymbol p$ is the canonical momentum. Moreover, we
find an additional contribution to the Hall dc conductivity from noncommuting
coordinates that is missing in the conventional Kubo-Streda formula. We show
that the widely used Rashba model does in fact provide a finite anomalous Hall
dc conductivity in the metallic regime (in the noncrossing approximation). In
addition to the Kubo formula, the Berry-phase theory of the anomalous Hall
effect should also be revised for systems where the velocity operator differs
from $\partial H/\partial \boldsymbol p$. While we focus on the Hall response
of the charge current to the electric field, linear response theories of other
SOC-related effects should be modified similarly.

<br>
<br>
Newly discovered altermagnets are magnetic materials exhibiting both
compensated magnetic order, similar to antiferromagnets, and simultaneous
non-relativistic spin-splitting of the bands, akin to ferromagnets. This
characteristic arises from the specific symmetry operations that connect the
spin sublattices. In this report, we show with ab initio calculations that the
semiconductive MnSe exhibits altermagnetic spin-splitting in the wurtzite phase
as well as a critical temperature well above room temperature. It is the first
material from such space group identified to possess altermagnetic properties.
Furthermore, we demonstrate experimentally through structural characterization
techniques that it is possible to obtain thin films of both the intriguing
wurtzite phase of MnSe and the more common rock-salt MnSe using molecular beam
epitaxy on GaAs substrates. The choice of buffer layers plays a crucial role in
determining the resulting phase and consequently extends the array of materials
available for the physics of altermagnetism.

Here, we develop a framework for the prediction and screening of native
defects and functional impurities in a chemical space of Group IV, III-V, and
II-VI zinc blende (ZB) semiconductors, powered by crystal Graph-based Neural
Networks (GNNs) trained on high-throughput density functional theory (DFT)
data. Using an innovative approach of sampling partially optimized defect
configurations from DFT calculations, we generate one of the largest
computational defect datasets to date, containing many types of vacancies,
self-interstitials, anti-site substitutions, impurity interstitials and
substitutions, as well as some defect complexes. We applied three types of
established GNN techniques, namely Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Network
(CGCNN), Materials Graph Network (MEGNET), and Atomistic Line Graph Neural
Network (ALIGNN), to rigorously train models for predicting defect formation
energy (DFE) in multiple charge states and chemical potential conditions. We
find that ALIGNN yields the best DFE predictions with root mean square errors
around 0.3 eV, which represents a prediction accuracy of 98 % given the range
of values within the dataset, improving significantly on the state-of-the-art.
Models are tested for different defect types as well as for defect charge
transition levels. We further show that GNN-based defective structure
optimization can take us close to DFT-optimized geometries at a fraction of the
cost of full DFT. DFT-GNN models enable prediction and screening across
thousands of hypothetical defects based on both unoptimized and
partially-optimized defective structures, helping identify electronically
active defects in technologically-important semiconductors.

Topological semimetals, such as the Weyl and Dirac semimetals, represent one
of the most active research fields in modern condensed matter physics. The
peculiar physical behavior of these systems mainly originates from their
underlying symmetries, emergent relativistic dispersion, and band topology. In
this paper, we present a novel class of $\textit{geometric semimetals}$ in
three dimensions. These semimetals are protected by the generalized chiral and
rotation symmetries, but are topologically trivial. Nevertheless, we show that
their band geometry is nontrivial, as evidenced by the corresponding quantum
metric trace that can give rise to a quantized geometric invariant. The
possible realization in synthetic matter is also discussed.
