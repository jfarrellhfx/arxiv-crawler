<h3>Superconducting quantum criticality and the anomalous scaling: A  nonlinear relativistic equation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07567" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07567</a>
<br>
<i>Yong Tao</i>
<p>By using the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm, we show that, near a quantum
critical point (QCP), Cooper pairs at zero temperature would obey a nonlinear
relativistic equation, where the imaginary time emerges as a novel dimension.
This relativistic equation is applicable to certain superconductors at zero
temperature for which the Faber-Pippard coherence length formula holds at and
above the upper critical dimension. Here, we further show that the relativistic
equation leads to a testable prediction in the vicinity of the QCP $T_c=0$,
with $T_c$ being the transition temperature. That is, for 2D overdoped (clean)
superconducting films, when the parameter $T_c/(c_0v_F)$ is lower than a
characteristic scale, the Lorentz symmetry of relativistic equation arouses an
anomalous scaling $\xi_0 \propto T_c^{-1.34}$, where $\xi_0$ denotes the
zero-temperature coherence length, $v_F$ denotes the Fermi velocity, and $c_0$
denotes the Faber-Pippard coefficient. However, when the parameter
$T_c/(c_0v_F)$ is large enough, the Lorentz symmetry may be broken so that the
Faber-Pippard scaling $\xi_0 \propto T_c^{-1}$ is restored.

<h3>From Microscale Variations to Macroscopic Effects: Directional  Actuation, Phase Transition, and Negative Compressibility in Microfiber-Based  Shape-Morphing Networks</h3>

<p>Two-dimensional shape-morphing networks are common in biological systems and
have garnered attention due to their nontrivial physical properties that
emanate from their cellular nature. Here, we present the fabrication and
characterization of inhomogeneous shape-morphing networks composed of
thermoresponsive microfibers. By strategically positioning fibers with varying
responses, we construct networks that exhibit directional actuation. The
individual segments within the network display either a linear extension or
buckling upon swelling, depending on their radius and length, and the
transition between these morphing behaviors resembles Landau's second-order
phase transition. The microscale variations in morphing behaviors are
translated into observable macroscopic effects, wherein regions undergoing
linear expansion retain their shape upon swelling, whereas buckled regions
demonstrate negative compressibility and shrink. Manipulating the macroscale
morphing by adjusting the properties of the fibrous microsegments offers a
means to modulate and program morphing with mesoscale precision and unlocks
novel opportunities for developing programmable microscale soft robotics and
actuators.

<h3>Growth of large-sized relaxor ferroelectric PZN-PT single crystals by  modified flux growth method</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07593" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07593</a>
<br>
<i>P. Vijayakumar, C. Manikandan, R.M. Sarguna, Edward Prabu Amaladass, K.Ganesan, Varsha Roy, E. Varadarajan, S. Ganesamoorthy</i>
<p>A novel bottom-cooling high-temperature solution growth technique is
developed for growing large-sized relaxor ferroelectric
0.91Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3O3)-0.09PbTiO3 (PZN-PT) single crystals. During the growth, an
inverse temperature gradient is maintained in the crucible base by flowing air
at a controlled rate. This method restricts the number of spontaneously
nucleated crystals at crucible bottom, reduces loss of volatile PbO component
and favours the growth of large-sized PZN-PT single crystals. Large-sized
PZN-PT single crystals of dimensions ~ 22x20x14 mm3 are reproducibly grown by
the proposed method. The electrical characteristics of the PZN-PT wafers
oriented along the <100>, <010> and <001> directions are investigated. PZN-PT
wafers oriented along the <001> direction exhibited superior piezoelectric
coefficient (d33) of ~ 2221 pm/V. The homogeneity of the physical parameters is
analysed by preparing 10 elements with dimensions of ~5x2.5x2.5 mm3 which were
cut from single wafer oriented along the <001> direction. The ferro-, piezo-
and dielectric characteristics of these wafers were found to be highly uniform
with small standard deviation. The observation of d33 value with less than 2 %
deviation from mean value confirms the growth of high quality PZN-PT single
crystals.

<h3>Bisognano-Wichmann Hamiltonian for the entanglement spectroscopy of  fractional quantum Hall states</h3>

<i>A. Nardin, R. Lopes, M. Rizzi, L. Mazza, S. Nascimbene</i>
<p>We study the Bisognano-Wichmann Hamiltonian for fractional quantum Hall
states defined on a sphere and explore its relationship with the entanglement
Hamiltonian associated to the state. We present results for several examples,
namely the bosonic Laughlin state stabilized by contact two-body interactions
and the bosonic Moore-Read state by either three- or two-body interactions. Our
findings demonstrate that the Bisognano-Wichmann Hamiltonian provides a
reliable approximation of the entanglement Hamiltonian as a fully-local
operator that can be written without any prior knowledge of the specific state
under consideration.

<h3>Wigner Molecular Crystals from Multi-electron Moir√© Artificial Atoms</h3>

<i>Hongyuan Li, Ziyu Xiang, Aidan P. Reddy, Trithep Devakul, Renee Sailus, Rounak Banerjee, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Sefaattin Tongay, Alex Zettl, Liang Fu, Michael F. Crommie, Feng Wang</i>
<p>Semiconductor moir\'e superlattices provide a versatile platform to engineer
new quantum solids composed of artificial atoms on moir\'e sites. Previous
studies have mostly focused on the simplest correlated quantum solid - the
Fermi-Hubbard model - where intra-atom interactions are simplified to a single
onsite repulsion energy U. These studies have revealed novel quantum phases
ranging from Mott insulators to quantum anomalous Hall insulators at a filling
of one electron per moir\'e unit cell. New types of quantum solids should arise
at even higher filling factors where the multi-electron configuration of
moir\'e artificial atoms provides new degrees of freedom. Here we report the
experimental observation of Wigner molecular crystals emerging from
multi-electron artificial atoms in twisted bilayer WS2 moir\'e superlattices.
Moir\'e artificial atoms, unlike natural atoms, can host qualitatively
different electron states due to the interplay between quantized energy levels
and Coulomb interactions. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we
demonstrate that Wigner molecules appear in multi-electron artificial atoms
when Coulomb interactions dominate. Three-electron Wigner molecules, for
example, are seen to exhibit a characteristic trimer pattern. The array of
Wigner molecules observed in a moir\'e superlattice comprises a new crystalline
phase of electrons: the Wigner molecular crystal. We show that these Wigner
molecular crystals are highly tunable through mechanical strain, moir\'e
period, and carrier charge type. Our study presents new opportunities for
exploring quantum phenomena in moir\'e quantum solids composed of
multi-electron artificial atoms.

<h3>Reciprocal theorem for linear poro-viscoelastic materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07620" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07620</a>
<br>
<i>Moslem Moradi, Wenzheng Shi, Ehssan Nazockdast</i>
<p>In studying the transport of particles and inclusions in multi-phase systems
we are often interested in integrated quantities such as the total force and
the net velocity of the particles. Here, we derive a reciprocal formulation for
linear poro-viscoelastic (PVE) materials, which are composed of a linear
compressible viscoelastic phase, i.e. the network phase, permeated by a viscous
fluid. As an application of the reciprocal theorem, we analytically calculate
the time-dependent net force on a rigid stationary sphere in response to
point-forces applied to the elastic network and Newtonian fluid phases of a PVE
material. We show that the net force on the sphere in response to a point-force
in the fluid phase evolves over timescales that are independent of the distance
of the point-force to the sphere; in comparison, when the point-force is
applied to the network phase the timescale for force development becomes
distance-dependent. We discuss how in both cases these relaxation times are
related to the physical timescales that are determined by mechanical properties
of both phases -- such as the network's Poisson ratio, permeability and shear
modules, and the fluid viscosity -- as well as geometric factors, including the
size of the spherical inclusion and its distance from point-forces. The
reciprocal theorem presented here can be applied to a wide range of problems
involving the transport of cells, organelles and condensates in biological
systems composed of filamentous networks permeated by viscous fluids.

<h3>Dynamics and fluctuations of minimally-structured glass formers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07643" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07643</a>
<br>
<i>Patrick Charbonneau, Yi Hu, Peter K. Morse</i>
<p>The mean-field theory (MFT) of simple glasses, which is exact in the limit of
infinite spatial dimensions, $d\rightarrow\infty$, offers theoretical insight
as well as quantitative predictions about certain features of $d=3$ systems. In
order to more systematically relate the behavior of physical systems to MFT,
however, various finite-$d$ corrections need to be accounted for. Although some
efforts along this direction have already been undertaken, theoretical and
technical challenges hinder progress. A general approach to sidestep many of
these difficulties consists of simulating minimally-structured models whose
behavior smoothly converges to that described by the MFT as $d$ increases, so
as to permit a dimensional extrapolation. Using this approach, we here extract
the small fluctuations around the dynamical MFT captured by a standard
liquid-state observable the non-Gaussian parameter $\alpha_2$. The results
provide insight into the physical origin of these fluctuations as well as a
quantitative reference with which to compare observations in more realistic
glass formers.

<h3>Van-Hove tuning of Fermi surface instabilities through compensated  metallicity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07653" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07653</a>
<br>
<i>Hendrik Hohmann, Matteo D√ºrrnagel, Matthew Bunney, Tilman Schwemmer, Titus Neupert, Stephan Rachel, Ronny Thomale</i>
<p>Van-Hove (vH) singularities in the vicinity of the Fermi level facilitate the
emergence of electronically mediated Fermi surface instabilities. This is
because they provide a momentum-localized enhancement of density of states
enhancing selective electronic scattering channels. High-temperature
topological superconductivity has been argued for in graphene at vH filling
which, however, has so far proven inaccessible due to the demanded large doping
from pristine half filling. We propose compensated metallicity as a path to
unlock vH-driven pairing close to half filling in an electronic honeycomb
lattice model. It is enabled through the strong breaking of chiral symmetry
from intra-sublattice hybridization, leading to the emergence of a hole pocket
(hp) nearby the van-Hove points $M$ at the Brillouin zone boundary and an
electron pocket (ep) around the zone center $\Gamma$. While the ep is radially
symmetric and barely contributing to the electronic ordering selection, the hp
is dominated by its vH signature and yields electronic order at elevated
scales.

<h3>Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction inducing weak ferromagnetism in  centrosymmetric altermagnets and weak ferrimagnetism in noncentrosymmetric  altermagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07678" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07678</a>
<br>
<i>Carmine Autieri, Raghottam M Sattigeri, Giuseppe Cuono, Amar Fakhredin</i>
<p>The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) has explained successfully the
weak ferromagnetism in some centrosymmetric antiferromagnets. However, in the
last years, it was generally claimed that the DMI is not effective in
centrosymmetric systems. We reconciled these views by separating the
conventional antiferromagnets and altermagnets. Altermagnets represent
collinear antiferromagnetic compounds with spin-up and spin-down sublattices
connected only by mirror and roto-translational symmetries. Consequently, the
system shows even-parity wave spin order in the k-space lifting the Kramer's
degeneracy in the non-relativistic band structure. We emphasize that the DMI
can create weak ferromagnetism in centrosymmetric altermagnets while it is not
effective in centrosymmetric conventional antiferromagnets. Additionally, DMI
can create weak ferromagnetism or weak ferrimagnetism in noncentrosymmetric
altermagnets. Once the spin-orbit coupling is included in an altermagnetic
system without time-reversal symmetry, the components of spin moments of the
two sublattices along the Neel vector are antiparallel but the other two spin
components orthogonal to the N\'eel vector can be either parallel or
antiparallel for centrosymetric systems. For noncentrosymmetric systems, we can
have different bands showing parallel or antiparallel spin components resulting
in weak ferrimagnetism. We can divide the altermagnetic compounds into classes
based on the weak ferromagnetism or weak ferrimagnetism properties. The weak
ferromagnetism and weak ferrimagnetism induced by DMI is a property exclusively
of the altermagnets, not present in either ferromagnets or conventional
antiferromagnets so we propose that altermagnets should be classified based on
this property.

<h3>Confined magnon dispersion in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic thin  films in a second quantization approach: the case of Fe and NiO</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07715" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07715</a>
<br>
<i>Julio A. do Nascimento, Adam Kerrigan, S. A. Cavill, Phil J. Hasnip, Demie Kepaptsoglou, Quentin M. Ramasse, Vlado K. Lazarov</i>
<p>We present a methodology based on the calculation of the inelastic scattering
from magnons via the spin scattering function in confined geometries such as
thin films using a second quantization formalism, for both ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic materials. The case studies are chosen with an aim to
demonstrate the effects of film thickness and crystal orientation on magnon
modes, using bcc Fe(100) and NiO with (100) and (111) crystallographic
orientations as prototypical systems. Due to the quantization of the
quasi-momentum we observe a granularity in the inelastic spectra in the
reciprocal space path reflecting the orientation of the thin film. This
approach also allows to capture softer modes that appear due to the partial
interaction of magnetic moments close to the surface in a thin film geometry,
in addition to bulk modes. The softer modes are also affected by
crystallographic orientations as illustrated by the different surface-related
peaks of NiO magnon density of states at approximately ~ 65 meV for (100) and ~
42 meV for (111). Additionally, we explore the role of anisotropy on magnon
modes, revealing that introducing anisotropy to both Fe and NiO films increases
the overall hardness of the magnon modes. The introduction of a surface
anisotropy produces a shift of the surface-related magnon DOS peak to higher
energies with increased surface anisotropy, and in some cases leading to
surface confined mode.

<h3>Understanding disorder in Silicon quantum computing platforms:  Scattering mechanisms in Si/SiGe quantum wells</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07717" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07717</a>
<br>
<i>Yi Huang, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<p>Motivated by recent experiments on Si/SiGe quantum wells with a co-design of
high electron mobility and large valley splitting [B. Paquelet Wuetz, et al.,
Nature Communications 14, 1385 (2023); D. D. Esposti, et al.,
arXiv:2309.02832], suitable for a Si-based spin qubit quantum computing
platform, we examine the role of disorder by theoretically calculating mobility
and quantum mobility from various scattering mechanisms and their dependence on
the electron density. At low electron densities $n_e < 4 \times 10^{11}$
cm$^{-2}$, we find that mobility is limited by remote Coulomb impurities in the
capping layer, whereas interface roughness becomes the significant limiting
factor at higher densities. We also find that alloy disorder scattering is not
a limiting mechanism in the reported high-mobility structures. We estimate the
critical density of the disorder-driven low-density metal-insulator transition
using the Anderson-Ioffe-Regel localization criterion and qualitatively explain
the breakdown of the Boltzmann-Born theory at low densities. We also estimate
the critical density by considering inhomogeneous density fluctuations induced
by long-range Coulomb disorder in the system, and find a larger critical
density compared to the one obtained from the Anderson-Ioffe-Regel criterion.
For quantum mobility, our calculation suggests that remote and distant
background impurities are likely the limiting scattering sources across all
density. Future measurements of quantum mobility should provide more
information on the distribution of background impurities inside the SiGe
barriers. Moreover, we extend our theoretical analysis to the effect of quantum
degeneracy on transport properties and predict the mobility and the critical
density for the metal-insulator transition in spin-polarized high-mobility
structures under an external parallel magnetic field.

<h3>Analysis of photo-induced chirality and magnetic toroidal moment based  on Floquet formalism</h3>

<br>
<i>Satoru Hayami, Ryota Yambe, Hiroaki Kusunose</i>
<p>We analyze the condition of photo-induced atomic-scale chirality and magnetic
toroidal moment. By performing a high-frequency expansion in the Floquet
formalism, we derive an effective static model Hamiltonian from the spinful
$s$-$p$ hybridized model of a single atom interacting with an electromagnetic
wave with a particular polarization. The lowest-order and third-order
contributions in the high-frequency expansion give rise to the coupling to
induce an electric toroidal monopole corresponding to microscopic chirality,
while the second-order contribution provides the coupling to induce a magnetic
toroidal dipole. We also discuss the condition of the polarization of the
electromagnetic wave and induced multipoles. Our results stimulate a new
direction of controlling unconventional multipoles by electromagnetic waves.

<h3>Force on a sphere suspended in flowing granulate</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07764" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07764</a>
<br>
<i>Jing Wang, Bo Fan, Tivadar Pong√≥, Tam√°s B√∂rzs√∂nyi, Ra√∫l Cruz Hidalgo, Ralf Stannarius</i>
<p>We investigate the force of flowing granular material on an obstacle. A
sphere suspended in a discharging silo experiences both the weight of the
overlaying layers and drag of the surrounding moving grains. In experiments
with frictional hard glass beads, the force on the obstacle was practically
flow-rate independent. In contrast, flow of nearly frictionless soft hydrogel
spheres added drag to the gravitational force. The dependence of the total
force on the obstacle diameter is qualitatively different for the two types of
material: It grows quadratically with the obstacle diameter in the soft, low
friction material, while it grows much weaker, nearly linearly with the
obstacle diameter, in the bed of glass spheres. In addition to the drag, the
obstacle embedded in flowing low-friction soft particles experiences a total
force from the top as if immersed in a hydrostatic pressure profile, but a much
lower counterforce acting from below. In contrast, when embedded in frictional,
hard particles, a strong pressure gradient forms near the upper obstacle
surface.

<i>Ryan Krueger, Ella King, Michael Brenner</i>
<p>The precise control of complex reactions is critical for biological processes
ranging from cell division to metabolism. Synthetic analogues of living
materials suffer from our inability to tune chemical reactions with precise
outcomes. Here, we leverage differentiable simulators to design nontrivial
reaction pathways in colloidal assemblies. By optimizing interactions between
reactants and substrates, we achieve controlled disassembly of octahedral and
icosahedral shells. As a potential engineering target, we design a reaction
that provokes the release of a small particle trapped in a shell.

<h3>A simplified Parisi Ansatz II: REM Universality</h3>

<br>
<i>Simone Franchini</i>
<p>In a previous work [A simplified Parisi Ansatz, Franchini, S., Commun. Theor.
Phys., 73, 055601 (2021)] we introduced a simple method to compute the Random
Overlap Structure of Aizenmann, Simm and Stars and the full-RSB Parisi formula
for the Sherrington-Kirckpatrick Model without using replica theory. The method
consists in partitioning the system into smaller sub-systems that we call
layers, and iterate the Bayes rule. A central ansatz in our derivation was that
these layers could be approximated by Random Energy Models of the Derrida type.
In this paper we analyze the properties of the interface in detail, and show
the equivalence with the Random Energy Model at low temperature.

<i>Abdullah S. Abbas, Beiye C. Li, Richard D. Schaller, Vitali B. Prakapenka, Stella Chariton, Gregory S. Engel, A. Paul Alivisatos</i>
<p>Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals demonstrate efficient up-conversion,
although the precise mechanism remains a subject of active research. This study
utilizes both steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy methods to unravel
the mechanism driving the up-conversion process in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals.
Employing above- and below-gap photoluminescence measurements, we confirm an
up-conversion efficiency, reaching up to 75%. We identify a distinct phonon
mode with an energy of ~7 meV active in the up-conversion, corresponding to the
Pb-Br-Pb bending mode. Raman spectroscopy and transient absorption measurements
support these findings. Transient absorption measurements under conditions of
sub-gap excitation also unexpectedly reveal coherent phonons for the subset of
nanocrystals undergoing up-conversion. This coherence implies that the
up-conversion and subsequent relaxation is accompanied by a synchronized and
phased lattice motion. This study sheds light on how the unique interplay
between the soft lattice structure, phonons, and excited states dynamics of
CsPbBr3 nanocrystals powers efficient up-conversion.

<h3>Denoising diffusion-based synthetic generation of three-dimensional (3D)  anisotropic microstructures from two-dimensional (2D) micrographs</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07832" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07832</a>
<br>
<i>Kang-Hyun Lee, Gun Jin Yun</i>
<p>Integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) has significantly
enhanced the systemic analysis of the relationship between microstructure and
material properties, paving the way for the development of high-performance
materials. However, analyzing microstructure-sensitive material behavior
remains challenging due to the scarcity of three-dimensional (3D)
microstructure datasets. Moreover, this challenge is amplified if the
microstructure is anisotropic, as this results in anisotropic material
properties as well. In this paper, we present a framework for reconstruction of
anisotropic microstructures solely based on two-dimensional (2D) micrographs
using conditional diffusion-based generative models (DGMs). The proposed
framework involves spatial connection of multiple 2D conditional DGMs, each
trained to generate 2D microstructure samples for three different orthogonal
planes. The connected multiple reverse diffusion processes then enable
effective modeling of a Markov chain for transforming noise into a 3D
microstructure sample. Furthermore, a modified harmonized sampling is employed
to enhance the sample quality while preserving the spatial connection between
the slices of anisotropic microstructure samples in 3D space. To validate the
proposed framework, the 2D-to-3D reconstructed anisotropic microstructure
samples are evaluated in terms of both the spatial correlation function and the
physical material behavior. The results demonstrate that the framework is
capable of reproducing not only the statistical distribution of material phases
but also the material properties in 3D space. This highlights the potential
application of the proposed 2D-to-3D reconstruction framework in establishing
microstructure-property linkages, which could aid high-throughput material
design for future studies

<p>Epitaxially grown RuO2 films on TiO2 (110) exhibit significant in-plane
strain anisotropy, with a compressive strain of - 4.7% along the [001]
crystalline direction and a tensile strain of +2.3% along [1-10]. As the film
thickness increases, anisotropic strain relaxation is expected. By fabricating
Hall bar devices with current channels along two in-plane directions <001> and
<1-10>, we revealed anisotropic in-plane transport in RuO2/TiO2 (110) films
grown via solid-source metal-organic molecular beam epitaxy approach. For film
thicknesses (t_film) < 3.6 nm, the resistivity along <001> exceeds that along
<1-10> direction at all temperatures. With further decrease in film
thicknesses, we uncover a transition from metallic to insulating behavior at
t_film <2.1 nm. Our combined temperature- and magnetic field-dependent
electrical transport measurements reveal that this transition from metallic to
insulating behavior is driven by electron-electron interactions.

<i>Hanan Hamamera, Filipe Souza Mendes Guimar√£es, Manuel dos Santos Dias, Samir Lounis</i>
<p>The field of orbitronics has emerged with great potential to impact
information technology by enabling environmentally friendly electronic devices.
The main electronic degree of freedom at play is the orbital angular momentum,
which can give rise to a myriad of phenomena such as the orbital Hall effect
(OHE), torques and orbital magnetoelectric effects. Here, we explore via
realistic time-dependent electronic structure simulations the magnetic response
of a non-magnetic material, an ultrathin Pt film, to ultrafast laser pulses of
different polarizatons and helicities. We demonstrate the generation of
significant orbital and spin magnetizations and identify the underlying
mechanisms consisting of the interplay of the OHE, inverse Faraday effect and
spin-orbit interaction. Our discoveries advocate for the prospect of encoding
magnetic information using light in materials that are not inherently magnetic.

<h3>Ideas of lattice-basis reduction theory for error-stable Bravais lattice  determination and ab-initio indexing</h3>

<br>
<i>R. Oishi-Tomiyasu</i>
<p>Although newly developed indexing software is frequently reported in
crystallography, it is not widely recognized that the use of error-stable
Bravais lattice determinations can simplify indexing algorithms and increase
their success rates. In indexing, a code for error-stable unit-cell
identification is also required to exclude duplicate solutions. One of our
goals is to collect information on the lattice-basis reduction theory and its
application to these analyses.
The main result is an error-stable Bravais lattice determination algorithm
for 2D lattices, along with a mathematical proof that it works even for
parameters containing large observational errors. As in our algorithm for 3D
lattices, it uses two lattice-basis reduction methods that seem to be optimal
for different symmetries.
As another application of lattice-basis reduction theory to the unit-cell
identification, we introduce several methods to measure the difference of unit
cells known in crystallography and mathematics.

<i>Hokuto Nagatakiya, Naoyuki Sakumichi, Shunsuke Kobayashi, Ryuichi Tarumi</i>
<p>We derive an analytical expression for the strain field, including fracture
profile, during steady-state crack propagation in viscoelastic solids. This
expression, featuring the hypergeometric function, is obtained by exactly
solving a model that incorporates the standard linear solid (i.e.,
three-element Zener) model. We find three regions in the fracture profile,
distinguished by power-law exponents that evolve with distance from the crack
tip; this explains why crack tips become sharper in rubbers and gels as the
crack-propagation velocity increases. We also provide a solid foundation for de
Gennes' viscoelastic trumpet, previously based only on a scaling argument.
These insights should help prevent catastrophic failure of polymer materials
triggered by velocity jumps.

<h3>Antiparallel spin polarization and spin current induced by thermal  current and locally-broken inversion symmetry in a double-quantum-well  structure</h3>

<p>Generating a nonequilibrium spin polarization with a driving force has been
first realized by the electric current in a system with broken inversion
symmetry and extended to that induced by the thermal current and that appearing
in an inversion-symmetric system with locally-broken inversion symmetry. This
paper theoretically explores the spin polarization generated by the thermal
current and the locally-broken inversion symmetry in a symmetric
double-quantum-well structure (DQWS). This thermally-induced spin polarization
(TISP) appears in the antiparallel configuration with the TISP of two wells in
opposite directions. The calculation using the Boltzmann equation in the
relaxation-time approximation under the condition of zero charge current shows
that the local TISP exhibits the maximum at a finite Rashba spin-orbit
interaction when the electron density is fixed. This is because the local TISP
in the DQWS is enhanced at the chemical potential near the bottom of the
first-excited subband. This enhancement also occurs in a single quantum well
with globally-broken inversion symmetry. Another finding is that the maximum of
the local TISP appears at a nonzero interwell coupling. The spin current by the
diffusion of the local TISP into an adjacent electrode is also calculated.

<p>The realization of topological states of matter in ultracold atomic gases is

<h3>THz spectroscopy on amino acids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07996" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07996</a>
<br>
<i>Sebastian Emmert, Peter Lunkenheimer, Alois Loidl</i>
<p>We present a detailed study on the temperature-dependent THz spectra of the
polycrystalline amino acids L-serine and L-cysteine for wave numbers from 20 to
120 cm-1 and temperatures from 4 to 300 K. Even though the structure of these
two amino acids is very similar, with a sulfur atom in the side chain of
cysteine instead of an oxygen atom in serine, the excitation spectra are
drastically different. Obviously, the vibrational dynamics strongly depend on
the ability of cysteine to form sulfur-hydrogen bonds. In addition, cysteine
undergoes an order-disorder type phase transition close to 80 K, with
accompanying anomalies in our THz results. On increasing temperatures,
well-defined vibrational excitations, exhibit significant shifts in
eigenfrequencies with concomitant line-broadening yielding partly overlapping
modes. Interestingly, several modes completely lose all their dipolar strength
and are unobservable at ambient conditions. Comparing the recent results with
published work utilizing THz, Raman, and neutron-scattering techniques, as well
as with ab-initio simulations, we aim at a consistent analysis of the results
ascribing certain eigenfrequencies to distinct collective lattice modes. We
document that THz spectra can be used to fine-tune parameters of model
calculations and as a fingerprint property of certain amino acids. In addition,
we analyzed the temperature-dependent heat capacity of both compounds and
detected strong excess heat capacities at low temperatures compared to the
canonical Debye behavior of crystalline solids, indicating soft excitations and
a strongly enhanced phonon-density of states at low frequencies.

<h3>Effects of liquid fraction and contact angle on structure and coarsening  in two-dimensional foams</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08014" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08014</a>
<br>
<i>Jacob Morgan, Simon Cox</i>
<p>Aqueous foams coarsen with time due to gas diffusion through the liquid. The
mean bubble size grows, and small bubbles vanish. However, coarsening is little
understood for foams with an intermediate liquid content, particularly in the
presence of surfactant-induced attractive forces between the bubbles, measured
by the contact angle. Rigorous bubble growth laws have yet to be developed, and
the evolution of bulk foam properties is unclear. We present a quasi-static
numerical model for coarsening in two-dimensional wet foams, focusing on growth
laws and related bubble properties. The deformation of bubbles is modelled
using a finite-element approach, and the gas flow through both films and
Plateau borders is approximated. We give results for disordered two-dimensional
wet foams with 256 to 1024 bubbles, at liquid fractions from $2\%$ to beyond
the zero-contact-angle jamming transition, and with contact angles up to
$10^\circ$. Simple analytical models are developed to aid interpretation. We
find that nonzero contact angle causes a proxy of the initial coarsening rate
to plateau at large liquid fractions, and that the individual bubble growth
rates are closely related to their effective number of neighbours.

<h3>Tunneling through ABC-ABA-ABC trilayer graphene junction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08046" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08046</a>
<br>
<i>Abderrahim El Mouhafid, Mouhamadou Hassane Saley, Ahmed Jellal</i>
<p>The electronic tunneling properties of trilayer graphene (TLG) are
significantly influenced by the specific stacking order. To illustrate this
stacking influence, we investigate the transport properties of a p-n-p junction
formed with ABC-ABA-ABC stacking TLG. Utilizing the transfer matrix method and
considering continuity conditions at the junction boundaries, we establish
transmission, reflection probabilities, and conductance. Remarkably, electron
transport through the ABC-ABA-ABC junction demonstrates Klein tunneling,
resulting in high conductance even in the absence of a potential barrier $V_0$.
This phenomenon is attributed to the effective barrier induced by our stacking,
facilitating the passage of a maximum number of electrons. However, the
presence of $V_0$ diminishes Klein tunneling, leading to conductance minima.
Furthermore, we reveal that the interlayer bias $\delta$ causes hybridization
of the linear and parabolic bands of ABA-TLG in the junction, reducing
resonances. In cases where $\delta\neq0$ and $V_0\neq0$, a suppression of the
gap is observed, contrary to the results obtained in ABC tunneling studies
where a gap exists.

<i>Yangrui Liu, Yun Li, Jing Wu, Xinyu Zhang, Pengfei Nan, Pengfei Wang, Dapeng Sun, Yumei Wang, Jinlong Zhu, Binghui Ge, Joseph S. Francisco</i>
<p>The structure and properties of water or ice are of great interest to
researchers due to their importance in the biological, cryopreservation and
environmental fields. Hexagonal ice (Ih) is a common ice phase in nature and
has been extensively studied; however, microstructural investigations at the
atomic or molecular scale are still lacking. In this paper, the fine structure
of quasi-2-dimensional ice Ih films was directly examined using cryogenic
transmission electron microscopy. Two types of thin Ih films were observed:
perfect single crystals growing along the [0001] direction and crystals with
stacking faults, including both basal (BSF) and prismatic (PSF) ones, along the
orientation of [11-20]; these results were further confirmed by theoretical
calculations. Importantly, for the first time, the stacking faults in ice Ih
were directly visualized and resolved. In light of the extension behavior of
the chair conformation composed of the water molecules, we elucidated the
formation mechanism of BSF in Ih, namely, the Ic phase. This study not only
determined the structural characteristics of ice structure at the molecular
scale but also provided important concepts for researchers to more fully
understand the growth kinetics of ice crystals at the atomic scale.

<h3>Spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking by disorder in  superconductors</h3>

<br>
<i>Brian M. Andersen, Andreas Kreisel, P. J. Hirschfeld</i>
<p>A growing number of superconducting materials display evidence for
spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) below their critical
transition temperatures. Precisely what this implies for the nature of the
superconducting ground state of such materials, however, is often not
straightforward to infer. We review the experimental status and survey
different mechanisms for the generation of signatures of TRSB in
superconductors. In cases where a TRSB complex combination of two
superconducting order parameter components is realized, defects, dislocations
and sample edges may generate superflow patterns that can be picked up by
magnetic probes. However, even single-component condensates that do not break
time-reversal symmetry in their pure bulk phases can also support signatures of
magnetism inside the superconducting state. This includes, for example, the
generation of localized orbital current patterns or spin-polarization near
atomic-scale impurities, twin boundaries and other defects. Signals of TRSB may
also arise from a superconductivity-enhanced Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida
exchange coupling between magnetic impurity moments present in the normal
state. We discuss the relevance of these different mechanisms for TRSB in light
of recent experiments on superconducting materials of current interest.

<h3>Wide-band frequency modulation of a terahertz intrinsic Josephson  junction emitter of a cuprate superconductor</h3>

<br>
<i>M. Miyamoto, R. Kobayashi, G. Kuwano, M. Tsujimoto, I. Kakeya</i>
<p>Communication using terahertz (~10^12 Hz) electromagnetic waves is critical
for developing 6th-generation wireless network infrastructures. Conflictions
between stable radiation and the modulation frequency of terahertz sources
impede the superposing of transmitting signals on carrier waves. The Josephson
junctions included in a cuprate superconductor radiate terahertz waves with
frequencies proportional to the bias voltages. Thus, the modulation of the bias
voltage leads to the modulation of the Josephson plasma emission (JPE)
frequency. This study aims to demonstrate the generation of frequency-modulated
(FM) terahertz continuous waves from Josephson junctions. The results verify
that the instantaneous JPE frequency follows the gigahertz-modulated bias
voltage. The wide-band FM terahertz generation by a monolithic device shows a
sharp contrast to the mode-lock frequency comb constructed by highly
sophisticated optics on a bench. A further increase of the modulation amplitude
facilitates up- or down-frequency conversion over more than one octave. The
obtained FM bandwidth exhibited an improvement of two orders of magnitude in
the demodulation signal-to-noise ratio compared to the amplitude-modulated
signal. The demonstrated FM-JPE stimulates further research on terahertz
communication technology and metrology using superconducting devices.

<p>Advancement of technologies relies on discovery of new materials with
emerging physical properties that are determined by their crystal structures.
Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) phases with formula of $A_{n+1}$$B_n$$X_{3n+1}$
(n=1,2,3...) are among one of the most widely studied class of materials due to
their electrical, optical, magnetic, thermal properties and their combined
multifunctional properties(Ref.1-6). In R-P phases, intergrowth is well-known
in the short range(Ref.7-9); however, no existing compounds have been reported
to have different n mixed in bulk single crystals. Here we design a hybrid R-P
nickelate $La_2NiO_4$$La_3Ni_2O_7$ by alternatively stacking bilayers, which is
the active structural motif in the newly discovery high-$T_c$ superconductor
$La_3Ni_2O_7$ and single layers of the antiferromagnetic insulator $La_2NiO_4$.
We report the successful synthesis of $La_2NiO_4$$La_3Ni_2O_7$ single crystals,
and X-ray diffraction and real-space imaging vis STEM show that the crystal
structure consists of single layers and bilayers of $NiO_6$ octahedral stacking
alternatively perpendicular to the ab plane, characterized by the orthorhombic
Immm (No.71) space group. Resistivity measurements indicate a peculiar
insulator-to-metal transition around 140 K on cooling. Correlated density
functional theory calculations corroborate this finding, and reveal that the
single layer becomes paramagnetic metallic due to charge transfer via LaO
layers. The discovery of $La_2NiO_4$$La_3Ni_2O_7$ opens a door to access a
completely new family of 3D hybrid R-P phases with the formula of
$A_{n+1}$$B_n$$X_{3n+1}$$A'_{m+1}$$B'_m$$X'_{3m+1}$ which potentially host a
plethora of emerging physical properties for various applications.

<i>Yu. A. Sakhratov, L. E. Svistov, A. P. Reyes</i>
<p>The magnetic H - T phase diagram of a quasi-two-dimensional easy plane
antiferromagnet RbFe(MoO$_4$)$_2$ (S = 5/2) with an equilateral triangular
lattice structure is studied with $^{87}$Rb NMR technique for field directed
along hard axis C3. The studies confirm the two step transition from the low
field umbrella-like incommensurate magnetic phase to the paramagnetic state
observed recently (Mitamura et al. 2016). The transitions were identified as a
lambda anomaly in the spin-lattice relaxation rate and a step increase of
magnetic susceptibility at intermediate transition. The $^{87}$Rb NMR study
precludes the possibility of either V or fan spin textures in the X phase. The
additional transition is presumably associated with loss of inter plane
magnetic order before the transition to paramagnetic state of individual
triangular planes.

<h3>Detection of Geometric Phases in Spin Waves using Nitrogen-Vacancy  Centers</h3>

<p>Due to their robustness, the implementation of geometric phases provides a
reliable and controllable way to manipulate the phase of a spin wave, thereby
paving the way towards functional magnonics-based data processing devices.
Moreover, geometric phases in spin waves are interesting from a fundamental
perspective as they contain information about spin wave band structures and
play an important role in magnon Hall effects. In this paper we propose to
directly measure geometric phases in spin wave systems using the magnetic field
sensing capabilities of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. We demonstrate the
general principles of this method on two systems in which spin waves acquire a
geometric phase, namely a wire with a magnetic domain wall and a system with
position-dependent anisotropy axes, and explicitly show how this phase can be
deduced from the NV center signal.

<i>Grazi√¢ni Candiotto, Fernanda R. Silva, Deyse G. Costa, Rodrigo B. Capaz</i>
<p>Linear carbon chains (LCCs) are the ultimate 1D molecular system and they
show unique mechanical, optical and electronic properties that can be tuned by
altering the number of carbon atoms, strain, encapsulation, and other external
parameters. In this work, we probe the effects of quantum anharmonicity, strain
and finite size on the structural and vibrational properties of these chains,
using high$-$level density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We find strong
anharmonicity effects for infinite chains, leading to ground$-$state nuclear
wavefunctions that are barely localized at each of the dimerized geometries,
i.e. strong tunneling occurs between the two minima of the potential energy
surface. This effect is enhanced for compressive strains. In addition,
vibrational C$-$band frequencies deviate substantially from experimental
measurements in long chains encapsulated in carbon nanotubes. On the other
hand, calculations for finite chains suggest that quantum anharmonicity effects
are strongly suppressed in finite system, even in the extrapolation to the
infinite case. For finite systems, vibrational C$-$band frequencies agree well
with experimental values at zero pressure. However, these frequencies increase
under compressive strain, in contradiction with recent results. This
contradiction is not resolved by adding explicitly the encapsulating carbon
nanotubes to our calculations. Our results indicate that LCCs embody an
intriguing 1D system in which the behavior of very large finite systems do not
reproduce or converge to the behavior of truly infinite ones.

<i>Lucas Benoit--Mar√©chal, Marco Salvalaglio</i>
<p>The Swift-Hohenberg (SH) and Phase-Field Crystal (PFC) models are minimal yet
powerful approaches for studying phenomena such as pattern formation,
collective order, and defects via smooth order parameters. They are based on a
free-energy functional that includes elasticity with linear, nonlinear, and
strain-gradient contributions. The latter is peculiar to gradient elasticity
(GE), a theory that accounts for elasticity effects at microscopic scales by
introducing additional characteristic lengths. While numerical simulations of
SH and PFC models display some distinctive GE features, such as the
regularization of stress singularities at crystalline defects, a comprehensive
analysis has yet to be conducted. This study addresses how GE is incorporated
into SH and PFC models. We calculate its characteristic lengths for various
lattice symmetries in an approximated setting. We then discuss the effective
elasticity theory encoded in SH and PFC models via numerical simulations of
dislocation stress fields and comparisons with solutions within first and
second strain GE. We then demonstrate that effective GE characteristic lengths
depend on the free-energy parameters, similar to the correlation length, thus
unveiling how they change with the quenching depth and the phenomenological
temperature entering the considered models. The findings presented in this
study enable a thorough discussion and analysis of small-scale elasticity
effects in pattern formation using SH and PFC models and complete the
elasticity analysis therein. Additionally, we provide a microscopic foundation
for GE in the context of order-disorder phase transitions.

<i>Jaeryeong Chang, Sungjun Lee, Yoonsoo Kim, Younghoon Lim, Jee Woo Park</i>
<p>We report the creation of dual-species Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of
$^{23}$Na and $^{41}$K. Favorable background scattering lengths enable
efficient sympathetic cooling of $^{41}$K via forced evaporative cooling of
$^{23}$Na in a plugged magnetic trap and an optical dipole trap. The $1/e$
lifetime of the thermal mixture in the stretched hyperfine state exceeds 5 s in
the presence of background scattering. At the end of evaporation, we create
dual BECs in the immiscible phase, with about $3\times10^5$ $^{23}$Na atoms
surrounding $5\times10^4$ $^{41}$K atoms. To further enable the tuning of the
interspecies interaction strength, we locate multiple Feshbach resonances at
magnetic fields up to 100 G. The broadest $s$-wave resonance located at 73.4(3)
G features a favorable width of 1.8(2) G. This work sets the stage for the
creation of ultracold gases of strongly dipolar bosonic $^{23}$Na$^{41}$K

<br>
<i>Mohd. Gayas Ansari, Pragya Shukla</i>
<p>We numerically analyze the spectral statistics of the multiparametric
Gaussian ensembles of complex matrices with zero mean and variances with
different decay routes away from the diagonals. As the latter mimics different
degree of effective sparsity among the matrix elements, such ensembles can
serve as good models for a wide range of phase transitions e.g. localization to
delocalization in non-Hermitian systems or Hermitian to non-Hermitian one. Our
analysis reveals a rich behavior hidden beneath the spectral statistics e.g. a
crossover of the spectral statistics from Poisson to Ginibre universality class
with changing variances for finite matrix size, an abrupt transition for
infinite matrix size and the role of complexity parameter, a single functional
of all system parameters, as a criteria to determine critical point. We also
confirm the theoretical predictions in \cite{psnh}, regarding the universality
of the spectral statistics in non-equilibrium regime of non-Hermitian systems
characterized by the complexity parameter.

<h3>Disentangling stress and strain effects in ferroelectric HfO2</h3>

<p>Ferroelectric HfO2 films are usually polycrystalline and contain a mixture of
polar and nonpolar phases. This challenges the understanding and control of
polar phase stabilization and ferroelectric properties. Several factors such as
dopants, oxygen vacancies, or stress, among others, have been investigated and
shown to have a crucial role on optimizing the ferroelectric response. Stress
generated during deposition or annealing of thin films is a main factor
determining the formed crystal phases and influences the lattice strain of the
polar orthorhombic phase. It is difficult to discriminate between stress and
strain effects on polycrystalline ferroelectric HfO2 films, and the direct
impact of orthorhombic lattice strain on ferroelectric polarization has yet to
be determined experimentally. Here, we analyze the crystalline phases and
lattice strain of several series of doped HfO2 epitaxial films. We conclude
that stress has a critical influence on metastable orthorhombic phase
stabilization and ferroelectric polarization. On the contrary, the lattice
deformation effects are much smaller than those caused by variations in the
orthorhombic phase content. The experimental results are confirmed by density
functional theory calculations on HfO2 and Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 ferroelectric phases.

<h3>Understanding the Role of Four-Phonon Scattering in the Lattice Thermal  Transport of Monolayer MoS$_{2}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08219" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08219</a>
<br>
<i>Saumen Chaudhuri, Amrita Bhattacharya, A. K. Das, G. P. Das, B. N. Dev</i>
<p>In the calculations of lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\text{L}}$),
vital contributions stemming from four-phonon scattering are often neglected.
The significance of four-phonon scattering in the thermal transport properties
of monolayer (ML) MoS$_{2}$ has been unraveled using first-principles
calculations combined with the Boltzmann transport equation. If only
three-phonon scattering processes are considered then the $\kappa_{\text{L}}$
is found to be significantly overestimated ($\sim$ 115.8 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at
300 K). With the incorporation of the four-phonon scattering processes, the
$\kappa_{\text{L}}$ reduces to 24.6 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$, which is found to be
closer to the experimentally measured $\kappa_{\text{L}}$ of 34.5
Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$. Four-phonon scattering significantly impacts the carrier
lifetime ($\tau$) of the low-energy out-of-plane acoustic mode (ZA) phonons and
thereby, suppresses its contribution in $\kappa_{\text{L}}$ from 64% (for
three-phonon scattering) to 16% (for both three- and four-phonon scatterings).
The unusually high four-phonon scattering rate ($\tau_{4}^{-1}$) of the ZA
phonons is found to result from the simultaneous effect of the acoustic-optical
frequency gap, strong anharmonicity, and the reflection symmetry imposed
selection rule. The strong coupling between the quadratic dispersion of the ZA
mode and the $\tau_{4}^{-1}$ is discovered by the application of mechanical
strain. The strain induced increase in the linearity of the ZA mode dispersion
dramatically reduces the significance of the four-phonon scattering in the
strained ML-MoS$_{2}$, both qualitatively and quantitatively. These conclusions
will provide significant insights into the thermal transport phenomena in
ML-MoS$_{2}$, as well as any other 2D material.

<p>The interface between a metal electrode and an organic semiconductor (OS)
layer has a defining role in the properties of the resulting device. To obtain
a desired performance, interlayers are introduced to modify the adhesion and
growth of OS and enhance the efficiency of charge transport through the
interface. However, the employed interlayers face common challenges, including
a lack of electric dipoles to tune the mutual position of energy levels, being
too thick for efficient electronic transport, or being prone to intermixing
with subsequently deposited OS layers. Here, we show that monolayers of
1,3,5-tris(4 carboxyphenyl)benzene (BTB) with fully deprotonated carboxyl group
on silver substrates form a compact layer resistant to intermixing while
mediating energy level alignment and showing a large insensitivity to substrate
termination. Employing a combination of surface-sensitive techniques, i.e.,
low-energy electron microscopy and diffraction, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy, we have comprehensively
characterized the compact layer and proven its robustness against mixing with
the subsequently deposited organic semiconductor layer. DFT calculations show
that the robustness arises from a strong interaction of carboxylate groups with
the Ag surface, and thus, the BTB in the first layer is energetically favored.
Synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectroscopy shows that this layer displays
considerable electrical dipoles that can be utilized for work function
engineering and electronic alignment of molecular frontier orbitals with
respect to the substrate Fermi level. Our work thus provides a widely
applicable molecular interlayer and general insights necessary for engineering
of charge injection layers for efficient organic electronics.

<h3>Tensile Strain Induced Anomalous Enhancement in the Lattice Thermal  Transport of Monolayer ZnO: A First Principles Study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08236" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08236</a>
<br>
<i>Saumen Chaudhuri, Amrita Bhattacharya, A. K. Das, G. P. Das, B. N. Dev</i>
<p>Density functional theory based calculations have been performed for solving
the phonon Boltzmann transport equation to investigate the thermal transport
properties of monolayer (ML) ZnO under in-plane isotropic biaxial tensile
strain. The in-plane lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\text{L}}$) of
ML-ZnO increases dramatically in response to the biaxial tensile strain ranging
from 0% to 10%, conflicting with the general belief. The strain-induced
stiffening of the ZA phonon mode and the resulting concomitant increase in
group velocity and decrease in phonon population is found to play a significant
role behind the unusual enhancement of $\kappa_{\text{L}}$. The mode resolved
analysis shows the tensile strain driven competitive behavior between different
phonon properties, mainly the group velocity and phonon lifetimes, being
responsible for the observed unusual enhancement in $\kappa_{\text{L}}$.
Additionally, the phonon scattering calculations show the importance of
inclusion of 4-phonon scattering in the thermal transport calculations
suggesting the significance of higher-order anharmonicity in ML-ZnO. A
strikingly high 4-phonon scattering strength in ML-ZnO primarily results from
the strong anharmonicity, quadratic ZA mode dispersion, large frequency gap in
phonon dispersion, and reflection symmetry induced selection rule. The
incorporation of 4-phonon scattering significantly alters the transport
characteristics of all the phonon modes, in general and ZA phonons, in
particular. At large strains, a linear dispersion of the ZA mode and closure of
the frequency gap is observed, which results in a significant reduction of
4-phonon scattering strength in ML-ZnO.

<h3>Complex-valued in-medium potential between heavy impurities in ultracold  atoms</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08241" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08241</a>
<br>
<i>Yukinao Akamatsu, Shimpei Endo, Keisuke Fujii, Masaru Hongo</i>
<p>We formulate the induced potential in a finite temperature cold atomic medium
between two heavy impurities, or polarons, which is shown to be
\textit{complex-valued} in general. The imaginary part of the complex-valued
potential describes a decoherence effect, and thus, the resulting Schr\"odinger
equation for the two polarons acquires a non-Hermitian term. We apply the
developed formulation to two representative cases of polarons interacting with
medium particles through the $s$-wave contact interaction: (i) the normal phase
of single-component (i.e., spin-polarized) fermions using the fermionic field
theory, and (ii) a superfluid phase using the superfluid effective field
theory, which is valid either for a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of a
single-component Bose gas or for the BEC-BCS crossover in two-component
fermions at a low-energy regime. Computing the leading-order term, the
imaginary part of the potential in both cases is found to show a universal
$r^{-2}$ behavior at long distance. We propose three experimental ways to
observe the effects of the universal imaginary potential in cold atoms.

<h3>Capacity of the treelike sign perceptrons neural networks with one  hidden layer -- RDT based upper bounds</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08244" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08244</a>
<br>
<i>Mihailo Stojnic</i>
<p>We study the capacity of \emph{sign} perceptrons neural networks (SPNN) and
particularly focus on 1-hidden layer \emph{treelike committee machine} (TCM)
architectures. Similarly to what happens in the case of a single perceptron
neuron, it turns out that, in a statistical sense, the capacity of a
corresponding multilayered network architecture consisting of multiple
\emph{sign} perceptrons also undergoes the so-called phase transition (PT)
phenomenon. This means: (i) for certain range of system parameters (size of
data, number of neurons), the network can be properly trained to accurately
memorize \emph{all} elements of the input dataset; and (ii) outside the region
such a training does not exist. Clearly, determining the corresponding phase
transition curve that separates these regions is an extraordinary task and
among the most fundamental questions related to the performance of any network.
Utilizing powerful mathematical engine called Random Duality Theory (RDT), we
establish a generic framework for determining the upper bounds on the 1-hidden
layer TCM SPNN capacity. Moreover, we do so for \emph{any} given (odd) number
of neurons. We further show that the obtained results \emph{exactly} match the
replica symmetry predictions of \cite{EKTVZ92,BHS92}, thereby proving that the
statistical physics based results are not only nice estimates but also
mathematically rigorous bounds as well. Moreover, for $d\leq 5$, we obtain the
capacity values that improve on the best known rigorous ones of
\cite{MitchDurb89}, thereby establishing a first, mathematically rigorous,
progress in well over 30 years.

<h3>An estimator of entropy production for partially accessible Markov  networks based on the observation of blurred transitions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08246" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08246</a>
<br>
<i>Benjamin Ertel, Udo Seifert</i>
<p>A central task in stochastic thermodynamics is the estimation of entropy
production for partially accessible Markov networks. We establish an effective
transition-based description for such networks with transitions that are not
distinguishable and therefore blurred for an external observer. We demonstrate
that, in contrast to a description based on fully resolved transitions, this
effective description is typically non-Markovian at any point in time. We
derive an information-theoretic bound for this non-ideal observation scenario
which reduces to an operationally accessible entropy estimator under specific
conditions that are met by a broad class of systems. We illustrate the
operational relevance of this system class and the quality of the corresponding
entropy estimator based on the numerical analysis of various representative
examples.

<h3>Spin fluctuations sufficient to mediate superconductivity in nickelates</h3>

<p>Infinite-layer nickelates show high-temperature superconductivity, and the
experimental phase diagram agrees well with the one simulated within the
dynamical vertex approximation (D$\Gamma$A). Here, we compare the
spin-fluctuation spectrum behind these calculations to resonant inelastic X-ray
scattering experiments. The overall agreement is good. This independent
cross-validation of the strength of spin fluctuations strongly supports the
scenario, advanced by D$\Gamma$A, that spin-fluctuations are the mediator of
the superconductivity observed in nickelates.

<h3>Phase Pattern Formation in Grain Boundaries</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08272" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08272</a>
<br>
<i>Ian S. Winter, Timofey Frolov</i>
<p>In this work we derive conditions that predict the existence of two-phase
periodic-pattern grain boundary structures that are stable against coarsening.
While previous research has established that elastic effects can lead to phase
pattern formation on crystal surfaces, the possibility of stable grain boundary
structures composed of alternating grain boundary phases has not been
previously analyzed. Our theory identifies the specific combination of grain
boundary and materials properties that enable the emergence of patterned grain
boundary states and shows that the dislocation content of grain boundary phase
junctions, absent in surface phenomena, weakens the stability of the patterned
structures. The predictions of the theory are tested using a model copper grain
boundary that exhibits multiple phases and two-phase pattern formation. We
discuss how, similarly to surfaces, elastic effects associated with grain
boundary phase junctions have profound implications for how grain boundary
phases transform.

<h3>Unconventional correlated metallic behavior due to interorbital Coulomb  interaction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08284" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08284</a>
<br>
<i>N. Aucar Boidi, A. P. Kampf, K. Hallberg</i>
<p>We study the non-degenerate one dimensional two-orbital Hubbard model with
interorbital Coulomb interaction. By means of the density-matrix
renormalization group technique, we calculate the local single-particle density
of states and the optical conductivity at zero temperature. We find that a
finite interorbital Coulomb repulsion $V$ generates a new class of states
within the Mott-Hubbard band which has a large weight of holon-doublon pairs,
which we hence call the holon-doublon band (HDB). When $V$ is sufficiently
large, the HDB specifies the gapless low-energy excitations, and the system
becomes an unconventional correlated metal. Optical conductivity results
resolve different metallic behaviors for zero and finite interaction $V$.
Compared to the case without interorbital interaction, the conductivity is
strongly reduced in the correlated holon-doublon metal for finite $V$. In
addition, the absorption spectrum is dominated by the HDB, which is clearly
distinguishable from the Mott-Hubbard band.

<h3>Nonlinear kinetic inductance sensor</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08296" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08296</a>
<br>
<i>D. Yu. Vodolazov</i>
<p>The concept of nonlinear kinetic inductance sensor (NKIS) of electromagnetic
radiation is proposed. The idea is based on divergency of kinetic inductance
$L_k \sim dq/dI$ ($\hbar q$ is a momentum of superconducting electrons, $I$ is
a supercurrent) of hybrid superconductor/normal metal (SN) bridge at current
$I^*<I_{dep}$ ($I_{dep}$ is a depairing current of the hybrid) and temperature
$T^*$ much smaller than critical temperature $T_c$. It makes possible to have
large change of phase difference $\delta \phi$ along SN bridge in current
biased regime at $I\simeq I^*$ even for small electron temperature increase.
Appearance of $\delta \phi$ is accompanied by the change of the current and
magnetic flux through the coupled superconducting ring which could be measured
with help of superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). In some
respect proposed sensor may be considered as a superconducting counterpart of
transition edge sensor (TES) those work is based on large derivative $dR/dT$
($R$ is a resistance) near $T_c$. Because at $I \simeq I^*$ SN bridge is in
gapless regime there is no low boundary for frequency of detected e.m.
radiation. Our calculations show that such a sensor can operate in single
photon regime and detect single photons with frequency $\nu \gtrsim$ 10 GHz. We
argue that the nontrivial dependence $I(q)$ of SN bridge could be also used in
detectors of continuous e.m. radiation, current and magnetic field sensors.

<h3>Two $T$-linear scattering rate regimes in the triangular lattice Hubbard  model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08306" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08306</a>
<br>
<i>J√©r√¥me Fournier, Pierre-Olivier Downey, Charles-David H√©bert, Maxime Charlebois, Andr√©-Marie Tremblay</i>
<p>In recent years, the $T$-linear scattering rate found at low temperatures,
defining the strange metal phase of cuprates, has been a subject of interest.
Since a wide range of materials have a scattering rate that obeys the equation
$ \hbar / \tau \approx k_B T$, the idea of a universal Planckian limit on the
scattering rate has been proposed. However, there is no consensus on proposed
theories yet. In this work, we present our results for the $T$-linear
scattering rate in the triangular lattice Hubbard model obtained using the
dynamical cluster approximation. We find two regions with $T$-linear scattering
rate in the $T$ -- $p$ phase diagram: one emerges from the pseudogap to
correlated Fermi liquid phase transition at low doping, whereas the other is
solely caused by large interaction strength at large doping.

<h3>Polarization dynamics of trapped polariton condensates with  $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry</h3>

<br>
<i>I. Jes√°n Vel√°zquez-Res√©ndiz, Yuri G. Rubo</i>
<p>We propose a grated microcavity setup to form trapped polariton condensates
with parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry and study their polarization
dynamics. The pseudo-conservative dynamics of the Stokes vector in proposed
configuration is preserved in the presence of polariton-polariton interaction.
In the case of weak gain-dissipation inbalance, as compared to the linear
polarization splitting, the polarization Stokes spheres are deformed into
ellipsoids. When linear polarization splitting becomes weak, i.e., when
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is broken for noninteracting system, the Stokes spheres
are transformed into hyperboloids, but the dynamics is still described by
closed trajectories, allowing manipulation of the polarization of polariton
condensate by changing polarization splitting without losing its coherency.

<h3>Mapping the influence of impurities with varying interaction strength on  nucleation in the 2D Ising model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08342" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08342</a>
<br>
<i>Dipanjan Mandal, David Quigley</i>
<p>We study nucleation of magnetisation reversal in the two dimensional Ising
model at non-zero external field and in the presence of randomly placed static
and dynamic impurities. Impurity-spin interaction strengths are varied fixing
other interaction strengths. We observe a decrease in the nucleation rate when
the total interaction strength with impurities is decreased in the case of
static impurities. The nucleation rate saturates with respect to interaction
strength when the impurity density is low. However the nucleation rate does not
saturate for high impurity density. Similar behaviour is observed with dynamic
impurities both at low and high densities. We explore a broad range of both
spin-symmetric and spin-antisymmetric interaction strengths and map the regime
for which the impurities act as a surfactant, decreasing the surface energy of
the nucleating phase. We also characterise different nucleation regimes
observed at different values of interaction strength. These include regimes
where impurities are included or excluded from the nucleus, and a region in
which we observe cross nucleation of impurity clusters at the nucleus boundary.

<h3>Anti-Diffusion in an Algae-Bacteria Microcosm: Photosynthesis,  Chemotaxis, and Expulsion</h3>

<br>
<i>Praneet Prakash, Yasa Baig, Francois J. Peaudecerf, Raymond E. Goldstein</i>
<p>In Nature there are significant relationships known between microorganisms
from two kingdoms of life, as in the supply of vitamin B$_{12}$ by bacteria to
algae. Such interactions motivate general investigations into the
spatio-temporal dynamics of metabolite exchanges. Here we study by experiment
and theory a model system: a coculture of the bacterium $B. subtilis$, an
obligate aerobe that is chemotactic to oxygen, and a nonmotile mutant of the
alga $C. reinhardtii$, which photosynthetically produces oxygen when
illuminated. Strikingly, when a shaft of light illuminates a thin, initially
uniform suspension of the two, the chemotactic influx of bacteria to the
photosynthetically active region leads to expulsion of the algae from that
area. This effect arises from algal transport due to spatially-varying
collective behavior of bacteria, and is mathematically related to the
``turbulent diamagnetism" associated with magnetic flux expulsion in stars.

<h3>Topological entanglement entropy for torus knot bipartitions and the  Verlinde-like formulas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08348" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08348</a>
<br>
<i>Chih-Yu Lo, Po-Yao Chang</i>
<p>The topological R\'enyi and entanglement entropies depend on the bipartition
of the manifold and the choice of the ground states. However, these
entanglement quantities remain invariant under a coordinate transformation when
the bipartition also undergoes the same transformation. In the context of
topological quantum field theories, these coordinate transformations reduce to
representations of the mapping class group on the manifold of the Hilbert
space. We employ this invariant property of the R\'enyi and entanglement
entropies under coordinate transformations for TQFTs in (2 + 1) dimensions on a
torus with various bipartitions. By utilizing the replica trick and the surgery
method to compute the topological R\'enyi and entanglement entropies, the
invariant property results in Verlinde-like formulas. Furthermore, for the
bipartition with interfaces as two non-intersecting torus knots, an $SL(2,
\mathbb{Z})$ transformation can untwist the torus knots, leading to a simple
bipartition with an effective ground state. This invariant property allows us
to demonstrate that the topological entanglement entropy has a lower bound $-2
\ln D$, where $D$ is the total quantum dimensions of the system.

<i>Harry Lane, Hao Zhang, David Dahlbom, Sam Quinn, Rolando D. Somma, Martin Mourigal, Cristian D. Batista, Kipton Barros</i>
<p>Calculating dynamical spin correlations is essential for matching model
magnetic exchange Hamiltonians to momentum-resolved spectroscopic measurements.
A major numerical bottleneck is the diagonalization of the dynamical matrix,
especially in systems with large magnetic unit cells, such as those with
incommensurate magnetic structures or quenched disorder. In this paper, we
demonstrate an efficient scheme based on the kernel polynomial method for
calculating dynamical correlations of relevance to inelastic neutron scattering
experiments. This method reduces the scaling of numerical cost from cubic to
linear in the magnetic unit cell size.
