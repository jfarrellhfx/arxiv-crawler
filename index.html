<h3>Circular polarization immunity of the cyclotron resonance photoconductivity in two-dimensional electron systems</h3>

Studying the cyclotron resonance (CR)-induced photoconductivity in GaAs and
HgTe two-dimensional electron structures, we observed an anomalous
photoresponse for the CR-inactive geometry being of almost the same magnitude
as the CR-active one. This observation conflicts with simultaneous transmission
measurements and contradicts the conventional theory of CR which predicts no
resonant response for the CR-inactive geometry. We provide a possible route to
explain this fundamental failure of the conventional description of
light-matter interaction and discuss a modified electron dynamics near strong
impurities that may provide a local near-field coupling of the two helicity
modes of the terahertz field at low temperatures. This should result in a
CR-enhanced local absorption and, thus, CR photoconductivity for both magnetic
field polarities.

<h3>Demonstration of high sensitivity of microwave-induced resistance oscillations to circular polarization</h3>

We demonstrate that long-debated immunity of microwave-induced resistance
oscillations (MIRO) to the sense of circular polarization is not a generic
property of this phenomenon in solid-state two-dimensional electron systems.
Using a large-area GaAs-based heterostructure we detect up to 30 times larger
MIRO signal for the cyclotron resonance (CR) active helicity, fully consistent
with the concurrently measured transmission and the deduced CR shape of the
Drude absorption. We further elaborate conditions to avoid extrinsic factors
capable of producing an apparent immunity of the photoresponse.
