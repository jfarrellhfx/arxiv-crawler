<h3>Pulsating with discrete symmetry</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14370" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14370</a>
<br>
<i>Alessandro Manacorda, Étienne Fodor</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a class of diffusive lattice models where the internal states of
particles are subject to a periodic drive. The discrete symmetry of states
enforces an effective energy landscape which can counteract the drive to arrest
the dynamics. Such a mechanism is reminiscent of the arrest reported in dense
assemblies of pulsating deformable particles, in line with experiments in
confluent biological tissues. We show that the competition between arrest and
synchronisation promotes an instability which leads to spiral waves. Using
analytical coarse-graining, we rationalize the emergence of such spirals in
terms of a discrete gauge invariance at the hydrodynamic level.

<h3>Lyapunov vectors and excited energy levels of the directed polymer in  random media</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13696" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13696</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The scaling behavior of the excited energy levels of the directed polymer in
random media is analyzed numerically. We find that the spatial correlations of
polymer energies scale as $\sim k^{-\delta}$ for small enough wavenumbers $k$
with a nontrivial exponent $\delta \approx 1.3$. The equivalence between the
stochastic-field equation that describes the partition function of the directed
polymer and that governing the time evolution of infinitesimal perturbations in
space-time chaos is exploited to connect this exponent $\delta$ with the
spatial correlations of Lyapunov vectors reported in the literature. The
relevance of our results for other problems involving optimization in random
systems is discussed.

<h3>Optimized Analysis of the AC Magnetic Susceptibility Data in Several  Spin-Glass Systems using the Vogel-Fulcher and Power Laws</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13706" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13706</a>

In spin-glasses (SG), the relaxation time $\tau$ ($= 1/2{\pi}f$) vs. $T_f$
data at the peak position $T_f$ in the temperature variation of the ac magnetic
susceptibilities at different frequencies f is often fit to the Vogel-Fulcher
Law (VFL): $\tau=\tau_0\exp[E_a/k_b(T_f-T_0)]$ and to the Power Law (PL): $\tau
= \tau_0^*[(T_f-T_{SG}/T_{SG}]^{-z\nu}$. Both these laws have three fitting
parameters each, leaving a degree of uncertainty since the magnitudes of the
evaluated parameters $\tau_0$, $E_a/k_B$, $\tau_{0^*}$ and $z\nu$ depend
strongly on the choice of $T_0$ and $T_{SG}$. Here we report an optimized
procedure for the analysis of $\tau$ vs. $T_f$ data on several SG systems for
which we could extract such data from published sources. In this optimized
method, the data of $\tau$ vs. $T_f$ are fit by varying $T_0$ in the linear
plots of $\ln \tau$ vs $1/ (T_f - T_0)$ for the VFL and by varying $T_{SG}$ in
the linear plot of $\ln \tau$ vs. $\ln (T_f - T_{SG})/ T_{SG}$ for the PL till
optimum fits are obtained. The analysis of the associated magnitudes of
$\tau_0$, $E_a/k_B$, $\tau_{0^*}$ and $z\nu$ for these optimum values of $T_0$
and $T_{SG}$ shows that magnitudes of $\tau_{0^*}$, $\tau_0$ and $z\nu$ fail to
provide a clear distinction between canonical and cluster SG. However, new
results emerge showing $E_a/(k_BT_0) < 1$ in canonical SG whereas $E_a/(k_BT_0)
>1$ for cluster SG systems and the optimized $T_0 <$ optimized $T_{SG}$ in all
cases. Although some interpretation of these new results is presented, a more
rigorous theoretical justification of the boundary near $E_a/(k_BT_0) \sim 1$
is desired along with testing of these criteria in other SG systems.

<h3>Adhesion in soft contacts is minimum beyond a critical shear  displacement</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13708" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13708</a>
<br>
<i>C. Oliver, D. Dalmas, J. Scheibert</i>
<br>
<br>
The most direct measurement of adhesion is the pull-off force, i.e. the
tensile force necessary to separate two solids in contact. For a given
interface, it depends on various experimental parameters, including separation
speed, contact age and maximum loading force. Here, using smooth contacts
between elastomer spheres and rigid plates, we show that the pull-off force
also varies if the contact is sheared prior to separation. For shear
displacements below a critical valueabout 10% of that necessary to yield gross
sliding, the pull-off force steadily decreases as shear increases. For larger
shear, the pull-off force remains constant, at a residual value 10%--15% of its
initial value. Combining force measurements and in situ imaging, we show how
the unloading path leading to contact separation is modified by the initial
shear. In particular, we find that the residual pull-off force prevails if the
contact reaches full sliding during unloading. Based on those observations, a
first modeling attempt of the critical shear displacement is proposed,involving
a competition between jump instability and transition to sliding. Overall,
those results offer new insights into the interplay between adhesion and
friction, provide new constraints on adhesion measurements and challenge
existing adhesive models. They will be useful wherever soft contacts undergo
both normal and shear stresses, including tire grip, soft robotics, haptics and
animal locomotion.

<h3>Boundary conditions, phase distribution and hidden symmetry in 1D  localization</h3>

One-dimensional disordered systems with a random potential of a small
amplitude and short-range correlations are considered near the initial band
edge. The evolution equation is obtained for the mutual ditribution
P(\rho,\psi) of the Landauer resistance \rho and the phase variable
\psi=\theta-\varphi (\theta and \varphi are phases entering the transfer
matrix), when the system length L is increased. In the large L limit, the
equation allows separation of variables, which provides the existence of the
stationary distribution P(\psi), determinative the coefficients in the
evolution equation for P(\rho). The limiting distribution P(\rho) for
L\to\infty is log-normal and does not depend on boundary conditions. It is
determined by the 'internal' phase distribution, whose form is established in
the whole energy range including the forbidden band of the initial crystal. The
random phase approximation is valid in the deep of the allowed band, but
strongly violated for other energies. The phase \psi appears to be a 'bad'
variable, while the 'correct' vaiable is \omega=-ctg (psi/2). The form of the
stationary distribution P(\omega) is determined by the internal properties of
the system and is independent of boundary conditions. Variation of the boundary
conditions leads to the scale transformation \omega\to s\omega and translations
\omega \to \omega+\omega_0 and \psi\to\psi+\psi_0, which determinates the
'external' phase distribution, entering the evolution equations. Independence
of the limiting distribution P(\rho) on the external distribution P(\psi)
allows to say on the hidden symmetry, whose character is revealed below.

We study the behavior of the conductance and the current-noise in
three-terminal configurations of edge modes of a quantum Hall system in the
nu=2 filling factor with normal and s-wave superconducting contacts. We discuss
the impact of spin-orbit coupling in the quantum Hall system and the
possibility of effectively inducing triplet pairing in the egde states. We show
that the presence of these correlations imprints very clear signatures in both
the non-linear conductance and noise in these type of devices.

<h3>On quantum melting of superfluid vortex crystals: from Lifshitz scalar  to dual gravity</h3>

<br>
<i>Dung Xuan Nguyen, Sergej Moroz</i>
<br>
<br>
Despite a long history of studies of vortex crystals in rotating superfluids,
their melting due to quantum fluctuations is poorly understood. Here we develop
a fracton-elasticity duality to investigate a two-dimensional vortex lattice
within the fast rotation regime, where the Lifshitz model of the collective
Tkachenko mode serves as the leading-order low-energy effective theory. We
incorporate topological defects and discuss several quantum melting scenarios
triggered by their proliferation. Furthermore, we lay the groundwork for a dual
non-linear gravity description of the superfluid vortex crystals.

<h3>Designing Moiré Patterns by Bending</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13743" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13743</a>
<br>
<i>Pierre A. Pantaleón, Héctor Sainz-Cruz, Francisco Guinea</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by a recent experiment [Kapfer et. al., Science 381, 677 (2023)],
we analyze the low-energy physics of a bent nanoribbon placed on top of
graphene, which creates a gradually changing moir\'e pattern. By means of a
classical elastic model we derive the strains in the ribbon and we obtain its
spectrum with a scaled tight-binding model. In a nanoribbon on a substrate
pushed at one edge, the interplay between elasticity and van der Waals forces
lead to a quasi-universal shape, with a well defined maximum twist angle,
irrespective of the force applied at the end. Near the clamped edge, strong
strains and small angles leads to one-dimensional channels. Near the bent edge,
a long region behaves like magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), showing
a sharp peak in the density of states, mostly isolated from the rest of the
spectrum. We also calculate the band topology along the ribbon and we find that
it is stable for large intervals of strains an twist angles. Together with the
experimental observations, these results show that the bent nanoribbon geometry
is ideal for exploring superconductivity and correlated phases in TBG in the
very sought-after regime of ultra-low twist angle disorder.

<h3>Localization with non-Hermitian off-diagonal disorder</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13744" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13744</a>
<br>
<i>Aitijhya Saha, Debraj Rakshit</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work we discuss a non-Hermitian system described via a
one-dimensional single-particle tight-binding model, where the non-Hermiticity
is governed by a random nearest-neighbor tunnellings, such that the
left-to-right and right-to-left hopping strengths are unequal. A physical
situation of completely real eigenspectrum arises owing to the Hamiltonian's
tridiagonal matrix structure under a simple \emph {sign conservation} of the
product of the conjugate nearest-neighbor tunnelling terms. The off-diagonal
disorder leads the non-Hermitian system to a localization-delocalization
transition. The emergent nature of the transition is recognized through a
finite-size spectral analysis. A comprehensive scaling theorem is then
developed for characterizing the criticality. We perform careful analysis of
localization length, inverse participation ratio, and energy splitting for
reporting the scaling exponents, which turns out to be different from the ones
in the conventional Anderson localization.

<h3>Quantum vortex lattice via Lifshitz duality</h3>

<br>
<i>Yi-Hsien Du, Ho Tat Lam, Leo Radzihovsky</i>
<br>
<br>
We study an effective field theory of a vortex lattice in a two-dimensional
neutral rotating superfluid. Utilizing particle-vortex dualities we explore its
formulation in terms of a $U(1)$ gauge theory coupled to elasticity, that at
low energies reduces to a Lifshitz theory augmented with a Berry phase term
encoding the vortex dynamics in the presence of a superflow. Utilizing
elasticity- and Lifshitz-gauge theory dualities, we derive dual formulations of
the vortex lattice in terms of a traceless symmetric scalar-charge theory and
demonstrate low-energy equivalence of our dual gauge theory to its
elasticity-gauge theory dual. We further discuss a multipole symmetry of the
vortex lattice and its dual gauge theory's multipole one-form symmetries. We
also study its topological crystalline defects, where the multipole one-form
symmetry plays a prominent role, organizing the defects, explaining their
restricted mobility, and characterizing descendant vortex phases.

Vibrations in materials and nanostructures at sufficiently high temperatures
result in anharmonic atomic displacements, which leads to new phenomena such as
thermal expansion and multiphonon scattering processes, with a profound impact
on temperature-dependent material properties includ-ing thermal conductivity,
phonon lifetimes, nonradiative electronic transitions, and phase transi-tions.
Nanoscale momentum-resolved vibrational spectroscopy, which has recently become
possi-ble on monochromated scanning-transmission-electron microscopes, is a
unique method to probe the underpinnings of these phenomena. Here we report
momentum-resolved vibrational spectros-copy in hexagonal boron nitride at
temperatures of 300, 800, and 1300 K across three Brillouin zones (BZs) that
reveals temperature-dependent phonon energy shifts and demonstrates the
pres-ence of strong Umklapp processes. Density-functional-theory calculations
of temperature-dependent phonon self-energies reproduce the observed energy
shifts and identify the contributing mechanisms.

<h3>Morphological Study of Granular-Granular Impact Craters through  Time-of-Flight Cameras: from Concept to Automation in Python</h3>

Laboratory made granular-granular impact craters have been used as model
analogues of planetary impact craters. These kind of craters have been observed
and studied using profilometry techniques that allow to retrieve important
morphologic features from the impacted surface. In this work, we propose to use
a Time-of-Flight camera (Microsoft Kinect One) for the acquisition of depth
data. We show comparisons between the typically used technique and the analysis
derived from the Time-of-Flight data. We also release craterslab, a Python
library developed to automate most of the tasks from the process of studying
impact craters produced by granular projectiles hitting on the surface of
granular targets. The library is able to acquire, identify, and measure
morphological features of impacted surfaces through the reconstruction of 3D
topographic maps. Our results show that using a Time-of-Flight camera and
automating the data processing with a software library for the systematic study
of impact craters can produce very accurate results while reducing the time
spent on different stages of the process.

<br>
<br>
Tube processing and aging effects in FeCrAl ODS steels are investigated in
four mechanical alloyed ferritic ODS steels, Fe15Cr (SP2), Fe15Cr5Al (SP4),
Fe15Cr7Al (SP7) and Fe18Cr7Al (SP11). These steels were made into 0.3mm thick
plates by simulated tube processing (STP). Strengthening after partial
recrystallization was achieved after the last cold rolling and heat treatment
step. However, the ductility reduced about one third of the as-extruded steels.
The STPed steels were aged at 475{\deg}C in sealed vacuum tubes up to 2000 hrs
and 10000 hrs, respectively. The yield stress and elongation were investigated
by tensile tests. The results revealed that all the STPed steels fractured in a
ductile manner irrespective of aging conditions. Aging hardening and ductility
reduction in STPed steels are similar to as-extruded ones. The STPed ODS steels
showed similar ageing embrittlement resistance as as-extruded steels, but much
higher than the non-ODS steels. The aging hardening based on cut-through and
bow-pass mechanisms were discussed. The time dependent hardening of overaged
steel (beta prime only) was analyzed as well.

<h3>Ultralow lattice thermal transport and considerable wave-like phonon  tunneling in chalcogenide perovskite BaZrS$_3$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13851" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13851</a>

<br>
<br>
Chalcogenide perovskites provide a promising avenue for non-toxic, stable
thermoelectric materials. Here, thermal transport and thermoelectric properties
of BaZrS$_3$ as a typical orthorhombic perovskite are investigated. An
extremely low lattice thermal conductivity $\kappa_L$ of 1.84 W/mK at 300 K is
revealed for BaZrS$_3$, due to the softening effect of Ba atoms on the lattice
and the strong anharmonicity caused by the twisted structure. We demonstrate
that coherence contributions to $\kappa_L$, arising from wave-like phonon
tunneling, leading to a 18 \% thermal transport contribution at 300 K. The
increasing temperature softens the phonons, thus reducing the group velocity of
materials and increasing the scattering phase space. However, it simultaneously
reduces the anharmonicity, which is dominant in BaZrS$_3$ and ultimately
improves the particle-like thermal transport. Further, by replacing S atom with
Se and Ti-alloying strategy, $ZT$ value of BaZrS$_3$ is significantly increased
from 0.58 to 0.91 at 500 K, making it an important candidate for thermoelectric
applications.

Single flux quantum (SFQ) technology has garnered significant attention due
to its low switching power and high operational speed. Researchers have been
actively pursuing more advanced devices and technologies to further reduce the
reliance on inductors, bias, and dynamic power. Recently, innovative magnetic
Josephson junction devices have emerged, enhancing the field of superconductor
electronics (SCE) logic. This paper introduces a novel cell library design that
relies entirely on Josephson junctions (JJs), showing promising potential for
eliminating the need for inductors in conventional SFQ cells. This results in a
55% reduction in cell size and an 80% decrease in both static and dynamic power
consumption. The proposed library implements a half flux quantum (HFQ) logic,
where each pulse duration is half that of a single flux quantum pulse. The
paper presents the schematics of the basic cells, emphasizing critical circuit
parameters and their margins. Additionally, it examines layout blueprints,
showcasing the advantageous area-saving characteristics of the proposed design.

<h3>Symmetry-dependent dielectric screening of optical phonons in monolayer  graphene</h3>

Quantised lattice vibrations (i.e., phonons) in solids are robust and
unambiguous fingerprints of crystal structures and of their symmetry
properties. In metals and semimetals, strong electron-phonon coupling may lead
to so-called Kohn anomalies in the phonon dispersion, providing an image of the
Fermi surface in a non-electronic observable. Kohn anomalies become prominent
in low-dimensional systems, in particular in graphene, where they appear as
sharp kinks in the in-plane optical phonon branches. However, in spite of
intense research efforts on electron-phonon coupling in graphene and related
van der Waals heterostructures, little is known regarding the links between the
symmetry properties of optical phonons at and near Kohn anomalies and their
sensitivity towards the local environment. Here, using inelastic light
scattering (Raman) spectroscopy, we investigate a set of custom-designed
graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures, wherein dielectric screening is
finely controlled at the atomic layer level. We demonstrate experimentally and
explain theoretically that, depending exclusively on their symmetry properties,
the two main Raman modes of graphene react differently to the surrounding
environment. While the Raman-active near-zone-edge optical phonons in graphene
undergo changes in their frequencies due to the neighboring dielectric
environment, the in-plane, zone-centre optical phonons are symmetry-protected
from the influence of the latter. These results shed new light on the unique
electron-phonon coupling properties in graphene and related systems and provide
invaluable guidelines to characterise dielectric screening in van der Waals
heterostructures and moir\'e superlattices.

Further technological advancement of both lithium-ion and emerging battery
technologies can be catalyzed by an improved understanding of the chemistry and
working mechanisms of the solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) that form at
electrochemically active battery interfaces. However, collecting and
interpreting spectroscopy results of SEIs is difficult for several reasons,
including the chemically diverse composition of SEIs. To address this
challenge, we herein present a vibrational spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction
data library of ten suggested SEI chemical constituents relevant to both
lithium-ion and emerging battery chemistries. The data library includes
attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman
spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction data, collected in inert atmospheres
afforded by custom designed sample holders. The data library presented in this
work (and online repository) alleviates challenges with locating related work
that is either diffusely spread throughout the literature, or is non-existent,
and provides energy storage researchers streamlined access to vital
SEI-relevant data that can catalyse future battery research efforts.

Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), a workhorse of the semiconductor industry, has
progressed rapidly in the last few decades in the development of novel
materials. Recent developments in condensed matter and materials physics have
seen the rise of many novel quantum materials that require ultra-clean and
high-quality samples for fundamental studies and applications. Novel
oxide-based quantum materials synthesized using MBE have advanced the
development of the field and materials. In this review, we discuss the recent
progress in new MBE techniques that have enabled synthesis of complex oxides
that exhibit "quantum" phenomena, including superconductivity and topological
electronic states. We show how these techniques have produced breakthroughs in
the synthesis of 4d and 5d oxide films and heterostructures that are of
particular interest as quantum materials. These new techniques in MBE offer a
bright future for the synthesis of ultra-high quality oxide quantum materials.

<h3>Quantum theory of the magnetochiral anisotropy coefficient in ZrTe$_5$</h3>

Recent experiments performed the nonreciprocal magneotransport in ZrTe$_5$
and obtained a giant magnetochiral anisotropy (MCA) coefficient $\gamma'$. The
existing theoretical analysis was based on the semiclassical Boltzmann
equation. In this paper, we develop a full quantum theory to calculate
$\gamma'$. We reveal that the $xz$-mirror symmetry breaking term also breaks
the parity symmetry of the system, and leads to the mixed selection rules and a
nonvanishing second-order conductivity $\sigma_{xxx}$. The calculations show
that $\gamma'$ decreases with the magnetic field, survives only to weak
impurity scatterings, and grows almost linearly with the strength of the
$xz$-mirror symmetry breaking. Our paper can provide a deeper insight into the
intrinsic nonreciprocal magnetotransport phenomena in the topological semimetal
material.

Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) constitute the core group
of materials in the emerging semiconductor technology of valleytronics. While
the coupled spin-valley physics of pristine TMDC materials and their
heterstructures has been extensively investigated, less attention was given to
TMDC alloys, which could be useful in optoelectronic applications due to the
tunability of their band gaps. We report here our experimental investigations
of the spin-valley physics of the monolayer and bilayer TMDC alloy,
MoS$_{2x}$Se$_{2(1-x)}$, in terms of valley polarization and the generation as
well as electrical control of a photocurrent utilising the circular
photogalvanic effect. Piezoelectric force microscopy provides evidence for an
internal electric field perpendicular to the alloy layer, thus breaking the
out-of-plane mirror symmetry. This feature allows for the generation of a
photocurrent in the alloy bilayer even in the absence of an external electric
field. A comparison of the photocurrent device, based on the alloy material, is
made with similar devices involving other TMDC materials.

Metal borides have been considered as potential high-temperature
superconductors since the discovery of record-holding 39 K superconductivity in
bulk MgB2. In this work, we identified a superconducting yet thermodynamically
stable F43m Sr2B5 at 40 GPa with a unique covalent sp3-hybridized boron
framework through extensive first-principles structure searches. Remarkably,
solving the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations resulted in a high
superconducting critical temperature (Tc) around 100 K, exceeding the boiling
point (77 K) of liquid nitrogen. Our in-depth analysis revealed that the
high-temperature superconductivity mainly originates from the strong coupling
between the metalized {\sigma}-bonded electronic bands and E phonon modes of
boron atoms. Moreover, anharmonic phonon simulations suggest that F43m Sr2B5
might be recovered to ambient pressure. Our current findings provide a
prototype structure with a full {\sigma}-bonded boron framework for the design
of high-Tc superconducting borides that may expand to a broader variety of
lightweight compounds.

We report on scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) topographs of individual
metal phthalocyanines (MPc) on a thin salt (NaCl) film on a gold substrate, at
tunneling energies within the molecule's electronic transport gap. Theoretical
models of increasing complexity are discussed. The calculations for MPcs
adsorbed on a thin NaCl layer on Au(111) demonstrate that the STM pattern
rotates with the molecule's orientations - in excellent agreement with the
experimental data. Thus, even the STM topography obtained for energies in the
transport gap represent the structure of a one atom thick molecule. It is shown
that the electronic states inside the transport gap can be rather accurately
approximated by linear combinations of bound molecular orbitals (MOs). The gap
states include not only the frontier orbitals but also surprisingly large
contributions from energetically much lower MOs. These results will be
essential for understanding processes, such as exciton creation, which can be
induced by electrons tunneling through the transport gap of a molecule.

TlTaSe2 is a non-centrosymmetric quasi-2D crystal semi-metal hosting
nodal-line topological features protected by mirror-reflection symmetry. Here,
we investigated the superconducting properties of TlTaSe2 using the
first-principles anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg theory. The Fermi surface hosts
well gapped multiband features contributed by the Ta 5d and Tl 6p orbitals.
Moreso, anisotropic superconducting gaps were found to exist at 2.15 and 4.5
meV around the in-plane orbitals, coupling effectively with the in-plane
phonons of the Ta and Tl atoms. Using the Allen-Dynes-modified McMillan
formula, we found a superconducting transition temperature of 6.67 K,
accompanied by a robust electron-phonon coupling constant {\lambda} of 0.970.
This investigation provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying
anisotropic superconductivity in TlTaSe2.

Magnetic skyrmions offer promising prospects for constructing future
energy-efficient and high-density information technology, leading to extensive
explorations of new skyrmionic materials recently. The topological Hall effect
has been widely adopted as a distinctive marker of skyrmion emergence.
Alternately, here we propose a novel signature of skyrmion state by
quantitatively investigating the magnetoresistance (MR) induced by skyrmionic
bubbles in CeMn2Ge2. An intriguing finding was revealed: the anomalous MR
measured at different temperatures can be normalized into a single curve,
regardless of sample thickness. This behavior can be accurately reproduced by
the recent chiral spin textures MR model. Further analysis of the MR anomaly
allowed us to quantitatively examine the effective magnetic fields of various
scattering channels. Remarkably, the analyses, combined with the Lorentz
transmission electronic microscopy results, indicate that the in-plane
scattering channel with triplet exchange interactions predominantly governs the
magnetotransport in the Bloch-type skyrmionic bubble state. Our results not
only provide insights into the quantum correction on MR induced by skyrmionic
bubble phase, but also present an electrical probing method for studying chiral
spin texture formation, evolution and their topological properties, which opens
up exciting possibilities for identifying new skyrmionic materials and
advancing the methodology for studying chiral spin textures.

<h3>First-passage area distribution and optimal fluctuations of fractional  Brownian motion</h3>

We study the probability distribution $P(A)$ of the area $A=\int_0^T x(t) dt$
swept under fractional Brownian motion (fB\ m) $x(t)$ until its first passage
time $T$ to the origin. The process starts at $t=0$ from a specified point
$x=L$. We show that $P(A)$ obeys exact scaling relation $$ P(A) =
\frac{D^\frac{1}{2H}}{L^{1+\frac{1}{H}}}\,\Phi_H\left(\frac{D^\frac{1}{2H}
A}{L^{1+\frac{1}{H}}}\right)\,, $$ where $0<H<1$ is the Hurst exponent
characterizing the fBm, $D$ is the coefficient of fractional diffusion, and
$\Phi_H(z)$ is a scaling function. The small-$A$ tail of $P(A)$ has been
recently predicted by Meerson and Oshanin [Phys. Rev. E 105, 064137 (2022)],
who showed that it has an essential singularity at $A=0$, the character of
which depends on $H$. Here we determine the large-$A$ tail of $P(A)$. It is a
fat tail, in particular such that the average value of the first-passage area
$A$ diverges for all $H$. We also verify the predictions for both tails by
performing simple-sampling as well as large-deviation Monte Carlo simulations.
The verification includes measurements of $P(A)$ up to probability densities as
small as $10^{-190}$. We also perform direct observations of paths conditioned
to the area $A$. For the steep small-$A$ tail of $P(A)$ the "optimal paths",
i.e. the most probable trajectories of the fBm, dominate the statistics.
Finally, we discuss extensions of theory to a more general first-passage
functional of the fBm.

<br>
Confinement of water and methane in mesopores of hydrophobized SBA-15 is
demonstrated to promote methane hydrate formation. In comparison to
as-synthesized SBA-15, hydrophobization by C8 grafting accelerates the kinetics
of methane storage in and delivery from the hydrate. C8 grafting density was
determined at 0.5 groups nm-2 based on TGA and quantitative NMR spectroscopy.
Multinuclear 1H-1H DQSQ and 1H-1H RFDR NMR provided spectroscopic evidence for
the occurrence of C8 chains inside the mesopores of SBA-15, by showcasing close
spatial proximity between the grafted C8 chains and pore-intruded water
species. X-ray diffraction demonstrates formation of Structure I hydrate on
SBA-15 C8. At 7.0 MPa and 248 K, the water-to-hydrate conversion on
hydrophobized SBA-15 C8 reaches 96 pct. as compared to only 71 pct. on a
pristine SBA-15 sample with comparable pore size, pore volume and surface area.
The clathrate loading amounted to 14.8 g g-1. 2D correlation NMR spectroscopy
(1H-13C CP-HETCOR, 1H-1H RFDR) reveals hydrate formation occurs within pores of
SBA-15 C8 as well as in interparticle volumes. Following the initial
crystallization of SBA-15 C8-supported methane hydrate taking several hours, a
pressure swing process at 248 K allows to desorb and re-adsorb methane from the
structure within minutes and without thawing the frozen water structure. Fast
loading and unloading of methane was achieved in 19 subsequent cycles without
losses in kinetics. The ability to harvest the gas and regenerate the structure
without the need to re-freeze the water represents a 50 pct. energy gain with
respect to melting and subsequently recrystallizing the hydrate at 298 K and
248 K, respectively. After methane desorption, a small amount of residual
methane hydrate in combination with an amorphous yet locally ordered ice phase
is observed using 13C and 2H NMR spectroscopy.

Producing dense and homogeneous powder layers with smooth free surface is
challenging in additive manufacturing, as interparticle cohesion can strongly
affect the powder packing structure and therefore influence the quality of the
end product. We use the Discrete Element Method to simulate the spreading
process of spherical powders and examine how cohesion influences the
characteristics of the packing structure with a focus on the fluctuation of the
local morphology. As cohesion increases, the overall packing density decreases,
and the free surface roughness increases, which is calculated from digitized
surface height distributions. Local structural fluctuations for both quantities
are examined through the local packing anisotropy on the particle scale,
obtained from Vorono\"{\i} tessellation. The distributions of these
particle-level metrics quantify the increasingly heterogeneous packing
structure with clustering and changing surface morphology.

<br>
<br>
The nature of pseudogap lies at the heart of strongly-interacting
superconductivity and superfluidity. With known pairing interactions, unitary
Fermi gases provide an ideal testbed to verify whether a pseudogap can arise
from many-body pairing. Here we report the observation of the long-sought
pair-fluctuation-driven pseudogap in homogeneous unitary Fermi gases of
lithium-6 atoms, by precisely measuring the spectral function through
momentum-resolved microwave spectroscopy without the serious effects of
final-state effect. We find a large pseudogap above the superfluid transition.
The inverse pair lifetime exhibits a thermally-activated exponential behavior,
uncovering the microscopic virtual pair breaking and recombination mechanism.
The obtained large, T-independent single-particle scattering rate is comparable
with that set by the Planckian limit. Our findings quantitatively characterize
the pseudogap in strongly-interacting Fermi gases, highlighting the role of
preformed pairing as a precursor to superfluidity.

The packing behavior of powders is significantly influenced by various types
of inter-particle attractive forces, including adhesion and non-bonded van der
Waals forces [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Alongside particle size and shape
distributions, the inter-particle interactions, in particular frictional and
adhesive forces, play a crucial role in determining the flow behavior and
consequently the packing density of the powder layer. The impact of various
types of attractive forces on the packing density of powders with different
materials and particle size distributions remains largely unexplored and
requires further investigation. Accurately comprehending these effects through
experiments while considering specific particle size distributions and material
properties poses significant challenges. To address these challenges, we employ
Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations to characterize the packing behavior
of fine powders. We can demonstrate quantitative agreement with experimental
results by incorporating the appropriate particle size distribution and using
an adequate model of attractive particle interactions. Furthermore, our
findings indicate that both adhesion, which is modeled using the
Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) model [7], and van der Waals interactions are
crucial factors that must be taken into account in DEM simulations.

One of the problems concerning topological phases in solid-state systems
which still remains urgent is an issue of many-body effects. In this study we
address it within perturbative theory framework by considering topological
phase transitions related to charge correlations in the extended Kitaev chain
model that belongs to the BDI symmetry class. Obtained corrections to a
zero-frequency quasiparticle Green's function allow to separate the mean-field
and fluctuation contributions to a total winding number. As a result, the phase
transitions caused solely by the latter are unveiled. We thoroughly analyze the
mechanism of such transitions in terms of fluctuation-induced nodal points and
spectrum renormalization. Additionally, features of other quasiparticle
properties such as effective mass and damping are discussed in the context of
topological phase transitions.

Fullerene solids doped with alkali metals (A$_3$C$_{60}$, A = K, Rb, Cs)
exhibit a superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) as high as 40 K, and
their unconventional superconducting properties have been a subject of debate.
With application of high pressure on K$_3$C$_{60}$ and Rb$_3$C$_{60}$, the
experiments demonstrate the decrease of $T_c$. In this paper, we focus on
K$_3$C$_{60}$ and derive the structure of K$_3$C$_{60}$ under different
pressures based on first-principles calculations, exploring the trends of
Coulomb interactions at various pressures. By utilizing the Maximally Localized
Wannier function approach, Constrained Density Functional Perturbation Theory
(cDFPT), and Constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA), we construct a
microscopic low-energy model near the Fermi level. Our results strongly
indicate that, in the K$_3$C$_{60}$ system, as pressure increases, the effect
of phonons is the key to intraorbital electron pairing. There is a dominance of
the phonon-driven superconducting mechanism at high pressure.

<h3>The Sun within: active processes from two-temperature models</h3>

<br>
<i>Faezeh Khodabandehlou, Christian Maes</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose an embedding of standard active particle models in terms of
two-temperature processes. One temperature refers to an ambient thermal bath,
and the other temperature effectively describes ``hot spots,'' i.e., systems
with few degrees of freedom showing important population homogenization or even
inversion of energy levels as a result of activation. As a result, the
effective Carnot efficiency would get much higher than for our standard
macroscopic thermal engines, making connection with the recent conundrum of hot
mitochondria. Moreover, that setup allows to quantitatively specify the
resulting nonequilibrium driving, useful in particular for bringing the notion
of heat into play, and making easy contact with thermodynamic features.
Finally, we observe that the shape transition in the steady low-temperature
behavior of run-and-tumble particles (with the interesting emergence of edge
states at high persistence) is stable and occurs for all temperature
differences, including close-to-equilibrium.

The alkali halides are ionic compounds. Each alkali atom donates an electron
to a halogen atom, leading to ions with full shells. The valence band is mainly
located on halogen atoms, while, in a traditional picture, the conduction band
is mainly located on alkali atoms. Scanning tunnelling microscopy of NaCl at 4
K actually shows that the conduction band is located on Cl$^-$ because the
strong Madelung potential reverses the order of the Na$^+$ 3s and Cl$^-$ 4s
levels. We verify this reversal is true for both atomically thin and bulk NaCl,
and discuss implications for II-VI and I-VII compounds.

<h3>Observation of multiple attractors and diffusive transport in a  periodically driven Klein-Gordon chain</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We consider a Klein-Gordon chain that is periodically driven at one end and
has dissipation at one or both boundaries. An interesting numerical observation
in a recent study~[arXiv:2209.03977] was that for driving frequency in the
phonon band, there is a range of values of the driving amplitude $F_d\in (F_1,
F_2)$ over which the energy current remains constant. In this range, the system
exhibits a "resonant nonlinear wave" (RNW) mode of energy transmission which is
a time and space periodic solution. It was noted that the range $(F_1,F_2)$,
for which the RNW mode occurs, shrinks with increasing system size $N$ and
disappears eventually. Remarkably, we find that the RNW mode is in fact a
stable solution even for $F_d$ much larger than $F_2$ and quite large $N$
($\approx 1000$). For $F_d>F_{2}$, there exists a second attractor which is
chaotic. Both attractors have finite basins of attraction and can be reached by
appropriate choice of initial conditions. Corresponding to the two attractors
for large $F_d$, the system can now be in two nonequilibrium steady states. We
improve the perturbative treatment of [arXiv:2209.03977] for the RNW mode by
including the contributions of the third harmonics. We also consider the effect
of thermal noise at the boundaries and find that the RNW mode is stable for
small temperatures. Finally, we present results for a different driving
protocol studied in [arXiv:2205.03839] where $F_d$ is taken to scale with
system size as $N^{-1/2}$ and there is dissipation only at the non-driven end.
We find that the steady state can be characterized by Fourier's law as in
[arXiv:2205.03839] for a stochastic model. We point out interesting differences
that occur since our dynamics is nonlinear and Hamiltonian. Our results suggest
the intriguing possibility of observing the high current carrying RNW phase in
experiments by careful preparation of initial conditions.

The obstruction to constructing localized degrees of freedom is a signature
of several interesting condensed matter phases. We introduce a localization
renormalization procedure that harnesses this property, and apply our method to
distinguish between topological and trivial phases in quantum Hall and Chern
insulators. By iteratively removing a fraction of maximally-localized
orthogonal basis states, we find that the localization length in the residual
Hilbert space exhibits a power-law divergence as the fraction of remaining
states approaches zero, with an exponent of $\nu=0.5$. In sharp contrast, the
localization length converges to a system-size-independent constant in the
trivial phase. We verify this scaling using a variety of algorithms to truncate
the Hilbert space, and show that it corresponds to a statistically self-similar
expansion of the real-space projector. This result accords with a
renormalization group picture and motivates the use of localization
renormalization as a versatile numerical diagnostic for quantum Hall
insulators.

In this article, we examine the structure and the electronic, optical, and
magnetic properties of ZnTe before and after doping with the transition metal
Mn. The ab initio calculations of this compound were performed using the full
potential linearized extended full potential planar waveform (FP-LAPW) in the
context of density functional theory (DFT) implemented in the Wien2K code. The
potential for exchange and correlation was addressed by the generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) approximation. The electronic properties show that
the ZnTe material exhibits semiconductor behavior before doping. As a result,
it becomes semimetal after doping. The findings attained by Monte Carlo
simulations display that the ZnMnTe material goes from an antiferromagnetic
phase to the paramagnetic phase at the Neel temperature value TN =159.31 K.

The existence of bound states induced by local impurities coupled to an
insulating host depends decisively on the global topological properties of the
host's electronic structure. In this context, we consider magnetic impurities
modelled as classical unit-length spins that are exchange-coupled to the
spinful Haldane model on the honeycomb lattice. We investigate the spectral
flow of bound states with the coupling strength $J$ in both the topologically
trivial and Chern-insulating phases. In addition to conventional $k$-space
topology, an additional, spatially local topological feature is available,
based on the space of impurity-spin configurations forming, in case of $R$
impurities, an $R$-fold direct product of two-dimensional spheres. Global
$k$-space and local $S$-space topology are represented by different topological
invariants, the first ($k$-space) Chern number and the $R$-th ($S$-space)
spin-Chern number. We demonstrate that there is a local $S$-space topological
transition as a function of $J$ associated with a change in the spin Chern
number and work out the implications of this for the $J$-dependent local
electronic structure close to the impurities and, in particular, for in-gap
bound states. The critical exchange couplings' dependence on the parameters of
the Haldane model, and thus on the $k$-space topological state, is obtained
numerically to construct local topological phase diagrams for systems with
$R=1$ and $R=2$ impurity spins.

In this paper we investigate the interplay of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling
(RSOC) and a topological defect, such as a screw dislocation in an {\alpha}-T3
Aharonov-Bohm quantum ring and scrutinized the effect of an external transverse
magnetic field therein. Our study reveals that the energy spectrum follows a
parabolic dependence on the Burgers vector associated with the screw
dislocation. Moreover, its presence results in an effective flux, encompassing
the ramifications due to both the topological flux and that due to the external
magnetic field. Furthermore, we observe periodic oscillations in the persistent
current in both charge and spin sectors, with a period equal to one flux
quantum, which, however suffers a phase shift that is proportional to the
dislocation present in the system. Such tunable oscillations of the spin
persistent current highlights potential application of our system to be used as
spintronic devices. Additionally, we derive and analyse the thermodynamic
properties of the ring via obtaining the canonical partition function through
Euler-Maclaurin formula. In particular, we compute the thermodynamic
potentials, free energies, entropy, and heat capacity and found the latter to
yield the expected Dulong-Petit law at large temperatures.

<h3>Carrier doping of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ surface by chemical adsorption -- a DFT  study</h3>

<br>
<br>
Bi$_2$Se$_3$ is one of the most promising topological insulators, but it
suffers from intrinsic n-doping due to Se-vacancies, which shifts the Fermi
level into the bulk conduction band, leading to topologically trivial carriers.
Recently it was shown that this Fermi-level shift can be compensated by a
locally controlled surface p-doping process, through water adsorption and XUV
irradiation. Here, the microscopic mechanism of this surface doping is studied
by means of density functional theory (DFT) focusing on the adsorption of
H$_2$O, OH, O, C and CH on Bi$_2$Se$_3$. We find that water adsorption has a
negligible doping effect while hydroxyl groups lead to n-doping. Carbon
adsorption on Se vacancies gives rise to p-doping but it also strongly modifies
the electronic band structure around the Dirac point. Only if the Se vacancies
are filled with atomic oxygen, the experimentally observed p-doping without
change of the topological surface bands is reproduced. Based on the DFT
results, we propose a reaction path where photon absorption gives rise to water
splitting and the produced O atoms fill the Se vacancies. Adsorbed OH groups
appear as intermediate states and carbon impurities may have a catalytic effect
in agreement with experimental observations.

We present Floquet theory-based predictions and electrically detected
magnetic resonance (EDMR) experiments scrutinizing the nature of two-photon
magnetic resonance shifts of charge-carrier spin states in the perdeuterated
$\pi$-conjugated polymer poly[2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene
vinylene] (d-MEH-PPV) under strong magnetic resonant drive conditions
(radiation amplitude $B_1$ ~ Zeeman field $B_0$). Numerical calculations show
that the two-photon resonance shift with power is nearly drive-helicity
independent. This is in contrast to the one-photon Bloch-Siegert shift that
only occurs under non-circularly polarized strong drive conditions. We
therefore treated the Floquet Hamiltonian analytically under arbitrary
amplitudes of the co- and counter-rotating components of the radiation field to
gain insight into the nature of the helicity dependence of multi-photon
resonance shifts. In addition, we tested Floquet-theory predictions
experimentally by comparing one-photon and two-photon charge-carrier spin
resonance shifts observed through room-temperature EDMR experiments on
d-MEH-PPV-based bipolar injection devices [i.e., organic light emitting diode
structures (OLEDs)]. We found that under the experimental conditions of strong,
linearly polarized drive, our observations consistently agree with theory,
irrespective of the magnitude of $B_1$, and therefore underscore the robustness
of Floquet theory in predicting nonlinear magnetic resonance behaviors.

NiTe2, a type-II Dirac semimetal with strongly tilted Dirac band, has been
explored extensively to understand its intriguing topological properties. Here,
using density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we report that the strength
of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in NiTe2 can be tuned by Se substitution. This
results in negative shifts of the bulk Dirac point (BDP) while preserving the
type-II Dirac band. Indeed, combined studies using scanning tunneling
spectroscopy (STS) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)
confirm that the BDP in the NiTe2-xSex alloy moves from +0.1 eV (NiTe2) to -0.3
eV (NiTeSe) depending on the Se concentrations, indicating the effective
tunability of type-II Dirac fermions. Our results demonstrate an approach to
tailor the type-II Dirac band in NiTe2 by controlling the SOC strength via
chalcogen substitution. This approach can be applicable to different types of
topological materials.

quantized to be 0 or 1, independent of symmetries. In terms of $Q$, we
numerically investigate topological properties of the nonchiral Rice-Mele model
including random onsite potentials to show that nontrivial bulk topology is
sustained for weak enough disorder. In this regime, a finite spectral gap
persists, and then $Q$ is definitely identified. We also consider sublattice
polarization of disorder potentials. In this case, the energy spectrum retains
a gap regardless of disorder strength so that $Q$ is unaffected by disorder.
This implies that bulk topology remains intact as long as the spectral gap
opens.

In situ reflective high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) is widely used to
monitor the surface crystalline state during thin-film growth by molecular beam
epitaxy (MBE) and pulsed laser deposition. With the recent development of
machine learning (ML), ML-assisted analysis of RHEED videos aids in
interpreting the complete RHEED data of oxide thin films. The quantitative
analysis of RHEED data allows us to characterize and categorize the growth
modes step by step, and extract hidden knowledge of the epitaxial film growth
process. In this study, we employed the ML-assisted RHEED analysis method to
investigate the growth of 2D thin films of transition metal dichalcogenides
(ReSe2) on graphene substrates by MBE. Principal component analysis (PCA) and
K-means clustering were used to separate statistically important patterns and
visualize the trend of pattern evolution without any notable loss of
information. Using the modified PCA, we could monitor the diffraction intensity
of solely the ReSe2 layers by filtering out the substrate contribution. These
findings demonstrate that ML analysis can be successfully employed to examine
and understand the film-growth dynamics of 2D materials. Further, the ML-based
method can pave the way for the development of advanced real-time monitoring
and autonomous material synthesis techniques.

Vanadium diselenide (VSe2) has intriguing physical properties such as
unexpected ferromagnetism at the two-dimensional limit. However, the
experimental results for room temperature ferromagnetism are still
controversial and depend on the detailed crystal structure and stoichiometry.
Here we introduce crystal truncation rod (CTR) analysis to investigate the
atomic arrangement of bilayer VSe2 and bilayer graphene (BLG) hetero-structures
grown on a 6H-SiC(0001) substrate. Using non-destructive CTR analysis, we were
able to obtain electron density profiles and detailed crystal structure of the
VSe2/BLG heterostructures. Specifically, the out-of-plane lattice parameters of
each VSe2 layer were modulated by the interface compared to that of the bulk
VSe2 1T phase. The atomic arrangement of the VSe2/BLG heterostructure provides
deeper understanding and insight for elucidating the magnetic properties of the
van der Waals heterostructure.

Titanium nitride (TiN) presents superior electrical conductivity with
mechanical and chemical stability and compatibility with the semiconductor
fabrication process. Here, we fabricated epitaxial and polycrystalline TiN
(111) thin films on MgO (111), sapphire (001), and mica substrates at 640oC and
room temperature by using a DC sputtering, respectively. The epitaxial films
show less amount of surface oxidation than the polycrystalline ones grown at
room temperature. The epitaxial films show drastically reduced resistivity (~30
micro-ohm-cm), much smaller than the polycrystalline films.
Temperature-dependent resistivity measurements show a nearly monotonic
temperature slope down to low temperature. These results demonstrate that high
temperature growth of TiN thin films leads to significant enhancement of
electrical conductivity, promising for durable and scalable electrode
applications.

<br>
<br>
The morphing of 3D structures is suitable for i) future tunable material
design for customizing material properties and ii) advanced manufacturing tools
for fabricating 3D structures on a 2D plane. However, there is no inverse
design method for topologically variable and volumetric morphing or morphing
with shape locking, which limits practical engineering applications. In this
study, we construct a general inverse design method for 3D architected
materials for topologically variable and volumetric morphing, whose shapes are
lockable in the morphed states, which can contribute to future tunable
materials, design, and advanced manufacturing. Volumetric mapping of bistable
unit cells onto any 3D morphing target geometry with kinematic and kinetic
modifications can produce flat-foldable and volumetric morphing structures with
shape-locking. This study presents a generalized inverse design method for 3D
metamaterial morphing that can be used for structural applications with shape
locking. Topologically variable morphing enables the manufacture of volumetric
structures on a 2D plane, saving tremendous energy and materials compared with
conventional 3D printing. Volumetric morphing can significantly expand the
design space with tunable physical properties without limiting the selection of
base materials.

<br>
<br>
The sample quality of the hyperhoneycomb lattice Kitaev magnet
$\beta$-ZnIrO$_3$ was successfully improved by removing the maximum amount of
moisture from the reaction ampoule. The X-ray diffraction structural analysis
of the high-quality sample confirmed the presence of $P$2$_1$/$c$ superlattice
peaks of the Fddd structure in the original structural model. These peaks could
not be distinguished due to the presence of impurities in the low-quality
sample in a previous study. The structural analysis based on this monoclinic
crystal structure model showed no chemical disorder, suggesting that the
observed spin liquid type behavior is an intrinsic property unrelated to bond
randomness. The details of the $\beta$-ZnIrO$_3$ structure revealed in this
study will stimulate the further investigation of Kitaev physics.

<br>
Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model is paradigmatic to study quantum phase transition
in equilibrium or non-equilibrium systems and entanglement dynamics for a
variety of disciplines. In thermodynamics limit, quantum fluctuations are
negligible, its semiclassical dynamics in presence of only one nonlinear
couplings, as a good benchmark to study quantum fluctuation in finite-size
system, can be well obtained in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions. In this
work, we extend this semiclassical analysis into the regime where both
nonlinear interactions are present, and successfully obtain its exact solutions
of semiclassical equations by constructing an auxiliary function that is a
linear combination of the $y$ and $z$ component of the classical spin in
thermodynamic limit. Taking implementation of Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model in a
Bose-Einstein condensate setup as an example, we figure out all classical
dynamical modes, specially find out mesoscopic self-trapping mode in population
and phase-difference space even persists in presence of both nonlinear
couplings. Our results would be useful to analyze dynamical phase transitions
and entanglement dynamics of Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model in presence of both
nonlinear couplings.

<br>
We investigate the thermal expansion and superconducting properties of a
CuAl2-type (tetragonal) superconductor CoZr2 under high pressures. We perform
high-pressure synchrotron X-ray diffraction in a pressure range of 2.9 GPa < P
< 10.4 GPa and discover that CoZr2 exhibits volumetric negative thermal
expansion under high pressures. Although the uniaxial positive thermal
expansion (PTE) along the a-axis is observed under ambient pressure, that is
suppressed by pressure, while the large uniaxial negative thermal expansion
(NTE) along the c-axis is maintained under the pressure regime. As a result of
a combination of the suppressed uniaxial PTE along the a-axis and uniaxial NTE
along the c-axis, volumetric negative thermal expansion is achieved under high
pressure in CoZr2. The mechanisms of volumetric NTE would be based on the
flexible crystal structure caused by the soft Co-Co bond as seen in the
iso-structural compound FeZr2, which exhibits uniaxial NTE along the c-axis. We
also perform high-pressure electrical resistance measurements of CoZr2 to
confirm the presence of superconductivity under the examined pressure regime in
the range of 0.03 GPa < P < 41.9 GPa. We confirm the presence of
superconductivity under all pressures and observe dome-like shape pressure
dependence of superconducting transition temperature. Because of the
coexistence of two phenomena, which are volumetric NTE and superconductivity,
in CoZr2 under high pressure, the coexistence would be achievable under ambient
pressure by tuning chemical compositions after our present observation.

The interplay between ferromagnetism and the non-trivial topology has
unveiled intriguing phases in the transport of charges and spins. For example,
it is consistently observed the so-called topological Hall effect (THE)
featuring a hump structure in the curve of the Hall resistance (Rxy) vs. a
magnetic field (H) of a heterostructure consisting of a ferromagnet (FM) and a
topological insulator (TI). The origin of the hump structure is still
controversial between the topological Hall effect model and the multi-component
anomalous Hall effect (AHE) model. In this work, we have investigated a
heterostructure consisting of BixSb2-xTeySe3-y (BSTS) and Cr2Te3 (CT), which
are well-known TI and two-dimensional FM, respectively. By using the so-called
minor-loop measurement, we have found that the hump structure observed in the
CT/BSTS is more likely to originate from two AHE channels. Moreover, by
analyzing the scaling behavior of each amplitude of two AHE with the
longitudinal resistivities of CT and BSTS, we have found that one AHE is
attributed to the extrinsic contribution of CT while the other is due to the
intrinsic contribution of BSTS. It implies that the proximity-induced
ferromagnetic layer inside BSTS serves as a source of the intrinsic AHE,
resulting in the hump structure explained by the two AHE model.

Topological superconductors have drawn significant interest from the
scientific community due to the accompanying Majorana fermions. Here, we report
the discovery of electronic structure and superconductivity in high-entropy
ceramics Ti0.2Zr0.2Nb0.2Mo0.2Ta0.2Cx (x = 1 and 0.8) combined with experiments
and first-principles calculations. The Ti0.2Zr0.2Nb0.2Mo0.2Ta0.2Cx high-entropy
ceramics show bulk type-II superconductivity with Tc about 4.00 K (x = 1) and
2.65 K (x = 0.8), respectively. The specific heat jump is equal to 1.45 (x = 1)
and 1.52 (x = 0.8), close to the expected value of 1.43 for the BCS
superconductor in the weak coupling limit. The high-pressure resistance
measurements show that a robust superconductivity against high physical
pressure in Ti0.2Zr0.2Nb0.2Mo0.2Ta0.2C, with a slight Tc variation of 0.3 K
within 82.5 GPa. Furthermore, the first-principles calculations indicate that
the Dirac-like point exists in the electronic band structures of
Ti0.2Zr0.2Nb0.2Mo0.2Ta0.2C, which is potentially a topological superconductor.
The Dirac-like point is mainly contributed by the d orbitals of transition
metals M and the p orbitals of C. The high-entropy ceramics provide an
excellent platform for the fabrication of novel quantum devices, and our study
may spark significant future physics investigations in this intriguing
material.

<h3>On the dilemma between percolation processes and fluctuating pairs as  the origin of the enhanced conductivity above the superconducting transition  in cuprates</h3>

<br>
<br>
The confrontation between percolation processes and superconducting
fluctuations to account for the observed enhanced in-plane electrical
conductivity above but near $T_c$ in cuprates is revisited. The cuprates
studied here, La$_{1.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$CuO$_4$,
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$, and Tl$_2$Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10}$, have
a different number of superconducting CuO$_2$ layers per unit-cell length and
different Josephson coupling between them, and are optimally-doped to minimize
$T_c$-inhomogeneities. The excellent chemical and structural quality of these
samples also contribute to minimize the effect of extrinsic
$T_c$-inhomogeneities, a crucial aspect when analyzing the possible presence of
intrinsic percolative processes. Our analyses also cover the so-called high
reduced-temperature region, up to the resistivity rounding onset
$\varepsilon_{onset}$. By using the simplest form of the effective-medium
theory, we show that possible emergent percolation processes alone cannot
account for the measured enhanced conductivity. In contrast, these measurements
can be quantitatively explained using the Gaussian-Ginzburg-Landau (GGL)
approach for the effect of superconducting fluctuations in layered
superconductors, extended to $\varepsilon_{onset}$ by including a total energy
cutoff, which takes into account the limits imposed by the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle to the shrinkage of the superconducting wavefunction. Our
analysis confirms the adequacy of this cutoff, and that the effective
periodicity length is controlled by the relative Josephson coupling between
superconducting layers. These conclusions are reinforced by analyzing one of
the recent works that allegedly discards the superconducting fluctuations
scenario while supporting a percolative scenario for the enhanced conductivity
above $T_c$ in cuprates.

A magnetic phase diagram of the non-Heisenberg Tsai-type 1/1 Au-Ga-Tb
approximant crystal (AC) has been established across a wide electron-per-atom
(e/a) range via magnetization and powder neutron diffraction measurements. The
diagram revealed exotic ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders
that originate from the unique local spin icosahedron common to icosahedral
quasicrystals (iQCs) and ACs; The noncoplanar whirling AFM order is stabilized
as the ground state at the e/a of 1.72 or less whereas a noncoplanar whirling
FM order was found at the larger e/a of 1.80, with magnetic moments tangential
to the Tb icosahedron in both cases. Moreover, the FM/AFM phase selection rule
was unveiled in terms of the nearest neighbour (J1) and next nearest neighbour
(J2) interactions by numerical calculations on a non-Heisenberg single
icosahedron. The present findings will pave the way for understanding the
intriguing magnetic orders of not only non-Heisenberg FM/AFM ACs but also
non-Heisenberg FM/AFM iQCs, the latter of which are yet to be discovered.

Stable Tsai-type quinary 1/1 and 2/1 approximant crystals (ACs) with chemical
compositions Au56.25Al10Cu7In13Tb13.75 and Au55.5Al10Cu7In13Tb14.5,
respectively, exhibiting ferromagnetic (FM) long-range orders were successfully
synthesized and studied for their magnetic properties and magnetocaloric
effect. The 1/1 and 2/1 ACs primarily differ in their long-range atomic
arrangement and rare earth (RE) distribution, with the latter approaching
quasiperiodic order while still preserving periodicity. Analyses based on the
scaling principle and Kouvel-Fisher (KF) relations suggested mean-field-like
behavior near Curie temperatures in both compounds. From magnetization
measurements and the Maxwell equation, a magnetic entropy change of -4.3 and
-4.1 J/K mol Tb were derived under a magnetic field change of 7 T for the 1/1
and 2/1 ACs, respectively. The results indicated a prominent role of
intra-cluster magnetic interactions on critical behavior and magnetic entropy
of the Tsai-type compounds.

<h3>Characterizing the heterogeneity of membrane liquid-ordered domains</h3>

<br>
<br>
We use a lattice model of a ternary mixture containing saturated and
unsaturated lipids with cholesterol (Chol), to study the structural properties
characterizing the coexistence between the liquid-disordered and liquid-ordered
phases. Depending on the affinity of the saturated and unsaturated lipids, the
system may exhibit macroscopic (thermodynamic) liquid-liquid phase separation,
or be divided into small-size liquid-ordered domains surrounded by a
liquid-disordered matrix. In both cases, it is found that the nano-scale
structure of the liquid-ordered regions is heterogeneous, and that they are
partitioned into Chol-rich sub-domains and Chol-free, gel-like, nano-clusters.
This emerges as a characteristic feature of the liquid-ordered state, which
helps distinguishing between liquid-ordered domains in a two-phase mixture, and
similar-looking domains in a one-phase mixture that are rich in saturated
lipids and Chol, but are merely thermal density fluctuations. The
nano-structure heterogeneity of the liquid-ordered phase can be detected by
suitable experimental spectroscopic methods, and is observed also in atomistic
computer simulations.

Lightwave-driven terahertz scanning tunnelling microscopy (THz-STM) is
capable of exploring ultrafast dynamics across a wide range of materials with
angstrom resolution. In contrast to scanning near-field optical microscopy,
where photons scattered by the tip apex are analyzed to access the local
dielectric function on the nanoscale, THz-STM uses a strong-field single-cycle
terahertz pulse to drive an ultrafast current across a tunnel junction, thereby
probing the local density of electronic states. Yet, the terahertz field in a
THz-STM junction may also be spectrally modified by the electromagnetic
response of the sample. Here, we demonstrate a reliable and self-consistent
approach for terahertz near-field waveform acquisition in an atomic tunnel
junction that can be generally applied to electrically conductive surfaces. By
combining waveform sampling and tailoring with terahertz scanning tunnelling
spectroscopy (THz-STS), we comprehensively characterize the tunnel junction and
distinguish local sample properties from effects due to terahertz pulse
coupling and field enhancement. Through modelling, we verify the presence of an
isolated unipolar terahertz-induced current pulse, facilitating straightforward
interpretation for differential THz-STS with high spectral resolution. Finally,
we demonstrate the feasibility of atomic-scale terahertz time-domain
spectroscopy via the extremely localized near-fields in the tunnel junction.

<br>
<br>
Systems containing active components are intrinsically out of equilibrium,
while binary mixtures reach their equilibrium configuration when complete phase
separation is achieved. Active particles are found to stabilise non-equilibrium
morphologies in phase separating binary mixtures by arresting coarsening by
exerting active pressure that competes with surface tension driving forces. For
moderate activities, an emulsion morphology is stabilised, where the droplet
size is well-defined and controlled by activity. Conversely, the ability of
active particles to drive phase-separated mixtures away from their equilibrium
configuration is shown. A rich co-assembly behaviour is shown due to the
competing energy scales involved in the system.

Precious-metal-free spinel oxide electrocatalysts are promising candidates
for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline fuel cells. In
this theory-driven study, we use joint density-functional theory in tandem with
supporting electrochemical measurements to identify a novel theoretical pathway
for the ORR on cubic Co3O4 nanoparticle electrocatalysts. This pathway aligns
more closely with experimental results than previous models. The new pathway
employs the cracked adsorbates *(OH)(O) and *(OH)(OH), which, through hydrogen
bonding, induce spectator surface *H. This results in an onset potential
closely matching experimental values, in stark contrast to the traditional ORR
pathway, which keeps adsorbates intact and overestimates the onset potential by
0.7 V. Finally, we introduce electrochemical strain spectroscopy (ESS), a
groundbreaking strain analysis technique. ESS combines ab initio calculations
with experimental measurements to validate proposed reaction pathways and
pinpoint rate-limiting steps.

It is widely known that Boltzmann machines are capable of representing
arbitrary probability distributions over the values of their visible neurons,
given enough hidden ones. However, sampling -- and thus training -- these
models can be numerically hard. Recently we proposed a regularisation of the
connections of Boltzmann machines, in order to control the energy landscape of
the model, paving a way for efficient sampling and training. Here we formally
prove that such regularised Boltzmann machines preserve the ability to
represent arbitrary distributions. This is in conjunction with controlling the
number of energy local minima, thus enabling easy \emph{guided} sampling and
training. Furthermore, we explicitly show that regularised Boltzmann machines
can store exponentially many arbitrarily correlated visible patterns with
perfect retrieval, and we connect them to the Dense Associative Memory
networks.

The quasiparticle method, which has achieved a great success in solid state
electronics and crystal lattice vibration, is adopted to study the solid state
ion transport. A general recipe is put forward to map the classical solid state
ion system together with the short-range ion-ion repulsion to a quasiparticle
quantum system based on which simple tight-binding models are set up to study
popular solid state ionic issues. The derived ionic eigen-states and transport
can naturally incorporate the concerted behavior. The influence of mobile ion
doping to ionic conductivity is investigated by an explicit mean-field
expression of ion-ion Coulomb interaction to reveal the mechanism of
super-ionic conduction. Similar trick is also applied to study the the Onsager
transport originated from ion-electron interference. The so called high-entropy
mechanism is also explored where the lattice random distorsion and multi-site
percolation exhibit positive influence to increase ionic conductivity. Our
method is expected to provide a novel framework to understand and study the
solid state ion transport.

We establish low-temperature resonant inelastic light scattering (RILS)
spectroscopy as a tool to probe the formation of a series of moir\'e-bands in
twisted WSe2 bilayers by accessing collective inter-moir\'e-band excitations
(IMBE). We observe resonances in such RILS spectra at energies in agreement
with inter-moir\'e band (IMB) transitions obtained from an ab-initio based
continuum model. Transitions between the first and second IMB for a twist angle
of about 8{\deg} are reported and between first and second, third and higher
bands for a twist of about 3{\deg}. The signatures from IMBE for the latter
highlight a strong departure from parabolic bands with flat minibands
exhibiting very high density of states in accord with theory. These
observations allow to quantify the transition energies at the K-point where the
states relevant for correlation physics are hosted.

structure. We find that the differential conductance of such a device in the
absence of interactions has an infinitely sharp peak as a function of applied
voltage. Interaction between fermions results in broadening of the conductance
peak. We focus on the regime of strong interactions, in which the shape of the
peak manifests well defined features associated with the elementary excitations
of the system.

Materials able to rapidly switch between thermally conductive states by
external stimuli such as electric or magnetic fields can be used as
all-solid-state thermal switches and open a myriad of applications in heat
management, power generation and cooling. Here, we show that the large
magnetoresistance that occurs in the highly conducting semimetal
$\alpha$-WSi$_{2}$ single crystals leads to dramatically large changes in
thermal conductivity at temperatures <100 K. At temperatures <20 K, where
electron-phonon scattering is minimized, the thermal conductivity switching
ratio between zero field and a 9T applied field can be >7. We extract the
electronic and lattice components of the from the thermal conductivity
measurements and show that the Lorenz number for this material approximates the
theoretical value of L$_{0}$. From the heat capacity and thermal diffusivity,
the speed of thermal conductivity switching is estimated to range from 1 x
10$^{-4}$ seconds at 5 K to 0.2 seconds at 100 K for a 5-mm long sample. This
work shows that WSi$_{2}$, a highly conducting multi-carrier semimetal, is a
promising thermal switch component for low-temperature applications such
cyclical adiabatic demagnetization cooling, a technique that would enable
replacing $^{3}$He-based refrigerators.

We successfully synthesized ($p$-Py-V)[Cu(hfac)$_2$], a verdazyl-based
complex. Molecular orbital calculations revealed five types of intermolecular
interactions between the radical spins and two types of intramolecular
interactions between the radical and the Cu spins, resulting in a spin-1/2
distorted honeycomb-based lattice. Additionally, competing ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic (AF) interactions induce frustration. The magnetization curve
displayed a multistage increase, including a zero-field energy gap. Considering
the stronger AF interactions that form dimers and tetramers, the magnetic
susceptibility and magnetization curves were qualitatively explained. These
findings demonstrated that the quantum state, based on the dominant AF
interactions, was stabilized due to the effects of frustration in the lattice.
Hence, the exchange interactions forming two-dimensional couplings decoupled,
reducing energy loss caused by frustration and leading to frustration-induced
dimensional reduction.

We unveil that the holey graphyne (HGY), a two-dimensional carbon allotrope
where benzene rings are connected by two $-$C$\equiv$C$-$ bonds fabricated
recently in a bottom-up way, exhibits topological electronic states. Using
first-principles calculations and Wannier tight-binding modeling, we discover a
higher-order topological invariant associated with $C_2$ symmetry of the
material, and show that the resultant corner modes appear in nanoflakes
matching to the structure of precursor reported previously, which are ready for
direct experimental observations. In addition, we find that a band inversion
between emergent $g$-like and $h$-like orbitals gives rise to a nontrivial
topology characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant protected by an energy gap
as large as 0.52 eV, manifesting helical edge states mimicking those in the
prominent quantum spin Hall effect, which can be accessed experimentally after
hydrogenation in HGY. We hope these findings trigger interests towards
exploring the topological electronic states in HGY and related future
electronics applications.

<h3>The role of spin-orbit interaction in low thermal conductivity of  Mg$_3$Bi$_2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Three-dimensional layered Mg$_3$Bi$_2$ has emerged as thermoelectric material
due to its high cooling performance at ambient temperature, which benefits from
its low lattice thermal conductivity and semimetal character. However, the
semimetal character of Mg$_3$Bi$_2$ is sensitive to spin-orbit coupling (SOC).
Thus, the underlying origin of low lattice thermal conductivity needs to be
clarified in the presence of the SOC. In this work, the first-principles
calculations within the two-channel model are employed to investigate the
effects of the SOC on the phonon-phonon scattering on the phonon transport of
Mg$_3$Bi$_2$. Our results show that the SOC strongly reduces the lattice
thermal conductivity (up to $\sim 35$ %). This reduction originates from the
influence of the SOC on the transverse acoustic modes involving interlayer
shearing, leading to weak interlayer bonding and enhancement anharmonicity
around 50 cm$^{-1}$. Our results clarify the mechanism of low thermal
conductivity in Mg$_3$Bi$_2$ and support the design of Mg$_3$Bi$_2$-based
materials for thermoelectric applications.

<br>
<br>
In this work, we demonstrate the suitability of Reconfigurable Ferroelectric
Field-Effect- Transistors (Re-FeFET) for designing non-volatile reconfigurable
logic-in-memory circuits with multifunctional capabilities. Modulation of the
energy landscape within a homojunction of a 2D tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$)
layer is achieved by independently controlling two split-gate electrodes made
of a ferroelectric 2D copper indium thiophosphate (CuInP$_2$S$_6$) layer.
Controlling the state encoded in the Program Gate enables switching between p,
n and ambipolar FeFET operating modes. The transistors exhibit on-off ratios
exceeding 10$^6$ and hysteresis windows of up to 10 V width. The homojunction
can change from ohmic-like to diode behavior, with a large rectification ratio
of 10$^4$. When programmed in the diode mode, the large built-in p-n junction
electric field enables efficient separation of photogenerated carriers, making
the device attractive for energy harvesting applications. The implementation of
the Re-FeFET for reconfigurable logic functions shows how a circuit can be
reconfigured to emulate either polymorphic ferroelectric NAND/AND
logic-in-memory or electronic XNOR logic with long retention time exceeding
10$^4$ seconds. We also illustrate how a circuit design made of just two
Re-FeFETs exhibits high logic expressivity with reconfigurability at runtime to
implement several key non-volatile 2-input logic functions. Moreover, the
Re-FeFET circuit demonstrates remarkable compactness, with an up to 80%
reduction in transistor count compared to standard CMOS design. The 2D van de
Waals Re-FeFET devices therefore exhibit groundbreaking potential for both
More-than-Moore and beyond-Moore future of electronics, in particular for an
energy-efficient implementation of in-memory computing and machine learning
hardware, due to their multifunctionality and design compactness.

Fundamental understanding of macroscopic properties of polymer nanocomposites
(PNCs) remains difficult due to the complex interplay of microscopic dynamics
and structure, namely interfacial layer relaxations and three-dimensional
nanoparticle arrangements. The effect of surface modification by alkyl
methoxysilanes at different grafting densities has been studied in PNCs made of
poly(2-vinylpyridine) and spherical 20 nm silica nanoparticles (NPs). The
segmental dynamics has been probed by broadband dielectric spectroscopy, and
the filler structure by small-angle X-ray scattering and reverse Monte Carlo
simulations. By combining the particle configurations with the interfacial
layer properties, it is shown how surface modification tunes the attractive
polymer-particle interactions: bare NPs slow down the polymer interfacial layer
dynamics over a thickness of ca. 5 nm, while grafting screens these
interactions. Our analysis of interparticle spacing and segmental dynamics
provides unprecedented insight into the effect of surface modification on the
main characteristics of PNCs: particle interactions and polymer interfacial
layers.

<h3>On the absence of structure factors in concentrated colloidal  suspensions and nanocomposites</h3>

Small-angle scattering is a commonly used tool to analyze the dispersion of
nanoparticles in all kinds of matrices. Besides some obvious cases, the
associated structure factor is often complex and cannot be reduced to a simple
interparticle interaction, like excluded volume only. In recent experiments, we
have encountered a surprising absence of structure factors (S(q) = 1) in
scattering from rather concentrated polymer nanocomposites [A.-C. Genix et al,
ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 11 (2019) 17863]. In this case, quite pure form
factor scattering is observed. This somewhat ``ideal'' structure is further
investigated here making use of reverse Monte Carlo simulations in order to
shed light on the corresponding nanoparticle structure in space. By fixing the
target ``experimental'' apparent structure factor to one over a given q-range
in these simulations, we show that it is possible to find dispersions with this
property. The influence of nanoparticle volume fraction and polydispersity has
been investigated, and it was found that for high concentrations only a high
polydispersity allows reaching a state of S = 1. The underlying structure in
real space is discussed in terms of the pair-correlation function, which
evidences the importance of attractive interactions between polydisperse
nanoparticles. The calculation of partial structure factors shows that there is
no specific ordering of large or small particles, but that the presence of
attractive interactions together with polydispersity allows reaching an almost
``structureless'' state.

<h3>Aqueous self-assembly of a wide range of sophorolipid and glucolipid  microbial bioamphiphiles (biosurfactants): considerations on the  structure-properties relationship</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14727" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14727</a>

<br>
<br>
Sophorolipids are well-known scaled-up microbial glycolipid biosurfactants
with a strong potential for commercialization due to their biological origin
and mildness in contact with the skin and the environment compared to classical
surfactants. However, their association properties in water are still poorly
understood, they cannot be predicted and their behavior in solution challenges
half a century of knowledge generated in the field of surfactant science. By
studying forty different types of sophorolipids and sophorosides in water using
small angle X-ray scattering, and optical and cryogenic transmission electron
microscopy, this work provides better understanding of their structure-property
relationship and identifies which chemical groups in their molecular structure
have a critical influence on their self-assembly properties. Structural
features like the number of sugar headgroups, acetylation, end-chain functional
group, (un)saturation, lactonization and length of chain are adjusted to both
rationalize their impact and understand their effect on self-assembly. The
number of sugar groups, pH, (un)saturation and lactonization were found to have
a critical impact on sophorolipid self-assembly. The chemical nature of the
end-chain functional group and chain length were also found to have a possibly
critical impact, depending on the specific type of chemical function (COOH and
long chains are critical). Mono- and diacetylation, as well as the position of
sophorose in the fatty acid ($\omega$, $\omega$-1), are not critical, i.e.,
they did not significantly influence sophorolipid self-assembly.

<h3>Measuring the bending rigidity of microbial glucolipid (biosurfactant)  bioamphiphile self-assembled structures by neutron spin-echo (NSE):  interdigitated vesicles, lamellae and fibers</h3>

Bending rigidity, k, is classically measured for lipid membranes to
characterize their nanoscale mechanical properties as a function of
composition. Widely employed as a comparative tool, it helps understanding the
relationship between the lipid's molecular structure and the elastic properties
of its corresponding bilayer. Widely measured for phospholipid membranes in the
shape of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), bending rigidity is determined here
for three self-assembled structures formed by a new biobased glucolipid
bioamphiphile, rather associated to the family of glycolipid biosurfactants
than phospholipids. In its oleyl form, glucolipid G-C18:1 can assemble into
vesicles or crystalline fibers, while in its stearyl form, glucolipid G-C18:0
can assemble into lamellar gels. Neutron spin-echo (NSE) is employed in the
q-range between 0.3 nm-1 (21 nm) and 1.5 nm-1 (4.1 nm) with a spin-echo time in
the range of up to 500 ns to characterize the bending rigidity of three
different structures (Vesicle suspension, Lamellar gel, Fiber gel) solely
composed of a single glucolipid. The low (k= 0.30 $\pm$ 0.04 kbT) values found
for the Vesicle suspension and high values found for the Lamellar (k= 130 $\pm$
40 kbT) and Fiber gels (k= 900 $\pm$ 500 kbT) are unusual when compared to most
phospholipid membranes. By attempting to quantify for the first time the
bending rigidity of self-assembled bioamphiphiles, this work not only
contributes to the fundamental understanding of these new molecular systems,
but it also opens new perspectives in their integration in the field of soft
materials.

In this study, the non-equilibrium free energy corresponding to the curve
generated by a modified stochastic Loewner evolution (SLE), which is driven by
the Langevin equation, is theoretically investigated. Under certain conditions,
we prove that the time derivative of the (generalized) free energy expressed by
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the probability distributions of the curve
and driving function has a positive value, indicating the negativity of Gibbs
entropy production. In addition, it was implied that, in a certain restriction,
the free energy can be expressed as a function of a Lyapunov-type exponent of
the driving function. These results show a dissipative nature of conformal
dynamics, and indicate the growth-induced stability of the modified SLE curve.

The random transverse-field Ising ferromagnet (RTFIF) is a highly disordered
quantum system which contains randomness in the coupling strengths as well as
in the transverse-field strengths. In one dimension, the critical properties
are governed by an infinite-randomness fixed point (IRFP), and
renormalization-group studies argue that the two-dimensional (2D) model is also
governed by an IRFP. However, even the location of the critical point remains
unsettled among quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) studies. In this work, we perform
extensive QMC simulations to locate the quantum critical point and attempt a
finite-size scaling analysis to observe the critical behavior. We estimate the
critical field strength of the 2D RTFIF as $\Gamma_c = 7.52(2)$, together with
critical exponents such as $\beta=1.5(3)$, $\nu = 1.6(3)$, and $z=3.3(3)$ or
$\psi=0.50(3)$. We have also considered the McCoy-Wu model, which has
randomness in the ferromagnetic coupling strengths but not in the
transverse-field strength. Our QMC calculation shows that the critical behavior
of the 2D McCoy-Wu model is closer to that of the 2D transverse-field Ising
spin glass than to that of the 2D RTFIF. These numerical findings enhance our
understanding of disordered 2D quantum systems.

Reaction-diffusion systems, which consist of the reacting particles subject
to diffusion process, constitute one of the common examples of non-linear
statistical systems. In low space dimensions $d \leq 2$ the usual description
by means of kinetic rate equations is not sufficient and the effect of density
fluctuations has to be properly taken into account. Our aim here is to analyze
a particular multi-species reaction-diffusion system characterized by reactions
$\textit{A} +\textit{A} \rightarrow (\emptyset, A),$ $\textit{A} +\textit{B}
\rightarrow \textit{A}$ at and below its critical dimension $d_c = 2$. In
particular, we investigate effect of thermal fluctuations on the reaction
kinetics, which are generated by means of random velocity field modelled by a
stochastic Navier-Stokes equations. Main theoretical tool employed is
field-theoretic perturbative renormalization group. The analysis is performed
to the first order of the perturbation scheme (one-loop approximation).

Molecular junctions -- whether actual single molecules in nanowire break
junctions or artificial molecules realized in coupled quantum dot devices --
offer unique functionality due to their orbital complexity, strong electron
interactions, gate control, and many-body effects from hybridization with the
external electronic circuit. Inverse design involves finding candidate
structures that perform a desired function optimally. Here we develop an
inverse design strategy for generalized quantum impurity models describing
molecular junctions, and as an example, use it to demonstrate that many-body
quantum interference can be leveraged to realize the two-channel Kondo critical
point in simple 4- or 5-site molecular moieties. We show that remarkably high
Kondo temperatures can be achieved, meaning that entropy and transport
signatures should be experimentally accessible.

We review the GPAW open-source Python package for electronic structure
calculations. GPAW is based on the projector-augmented wave method and can
solve the self-consistent density functional theory (DFT) equations using three
different wave-function representations, namely real-space grids, plane waves,
and numerical atomic orbitals. The three representations are complementary and
mutually independent and can be connected by transformations via the real-space
grid. This multi-basis feature renders GPAW highly versatile and unique among
similar codes. By virtue of its modular structure, the GPAW code constitutes an
ideal platform for implementation of new features and methodologies. Moreover,
it is well integrated with the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) providing a
flexible and dynamic user interface. In addition to ground-state DFT
calculations, GPAW supports many-body GW band structures, optical excitations
from the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE), variational calculations of excited
states in molecules and solids via direct optimization, and real-time
propagation of the Kohn-Sham equations within time-dependent DFT. A range of
more advanced methods to describe magnetic excitations and non-collinear
magnetism in solids are also now available. In addition, GPAW can calculate
non-linear optical tensors of solids, charged crystal point defects, and much
more. Recently, support of GPU acceleration has been achieved with minor
modifications of the GPAW code thanks to the CuPy library. We end the review
with an outlook describing some future plans for GPAW.

This thesis is devoted to the study of extreme value statistics in stochastic
processes and their applications. In the first part, we obtain exact analytical
results on the extreme value statistics of both discrete-time and
continuous-time random walks. In particular, we focus on the gap statistics of
random walks and exhibit their asymptotic universality with respect to the jump
distribution in the limit of a large number of steps. In addition, we compute
the asymptotic behavior of the expected maximum of random walks in the presence
of a bridge constraint and reveal a rich behavior in their finite-size
correction. Moreover, we compute the expected length of the convex hull of
Brownian motion confined in a disk and show that it converges slowly to the
perimeter of the disk with a stretched exponential decay. In the second part,
we focus on numerically sampling rare trajectories of stochastic processes. We
introduce an efficient method to sample bridge discrete-time random walks. We
illustrate it and apply it to various examples. We further extend the method to
other stochastic processes, both Markovian and non-Markovian. We apply our
method to sample surviving particles in the presence of a periodic trapping
environment. Finally, we discuss several optimization problems in stochastic
processes involving extreme value statistics. In particular, we introduce a new
technique to optimally control dynamical systems undergoing a resetting policy.

Spin glasses featured by frustrated interactions and metastable states have
important applications in chemistry, material sciences and artificial neural
networks. However, the solution of the spin glass models is hindered by the
computational complexity that exponentially increases with the sample size.
Photonic Ising machines based on spatial light modulation can speed up the
calculation by obtaining the Hamiltonian from the modulated light intensity.
However, the large-scale generalization to various spin couplings and higher
dimensions is still elusive. Here, we develop a Fourier-mask method to program
the spin couplings in photonic Ising machines. We observe the phase transition
of the two-dimensional Mattis model and the J$\mathrm{_1}$-J$\mathrm{_2}$ model
and study the critical phenomena. We also demonstrate that the
three-dimensional Ising model, which has not been analytically solved, can be
effectively constructed and simulated in two-dimensional lattices with Fourier
masks. Our strategy provides a flexible route to tuning couplings and
dimensions of statistical spin models, and improves the applicability of
optical simulation in neural networks and combinatorial optimization problems.

<h3>Complete zero-energy flat bands of surface states in fully gapped chiral  noncentrosymmetric superconductors</h3>

Noncentrosymmetric superconductors can support flat bands of zero-energy
surface states in part of their surface Brillouin zone. This requires that they
obey time-reversal symmetry and have a sufficiently strong
triplet-to-singlet-pairing ratio to exhibit nodal lines in the bulk. These
bands are protected by a winding number that relies on chiral symmetry, which
is realized as the product of time-reversal and particle-hole symmetry. We
reveal a way to stabilize a flat band in the entire surface Brillouin zone,
while the bulk dispersion is fully gapped. This idea could lead to a robust
platform for quantum computation and represents an alternative route to
strongly correlated flat bands in two dimensions, besides twisted bilayer
graphene. The necessary ingredient is an additional spin-rotation symmetry that
forces the direction of the spin-orbit-coupling vector not to depend on the
momentum component normal to the surface. We define a winding number which
leads to flat zero-energy surface bands due to bulk-boundary correspondence. We
discuss under which conditions this winding number is nonzero in the entire
surface Brillouin zone and verify the occurrence of zero-energy surface states
by exact numerical diagonalization of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian for
a slab. In addition, we consider how a weak breaking of the additional symmetry
affects the surface band, employing first-order perturbation theory and a
quasiclassical approximation. We find that the surface states and the bulk gap
persist for weak breaking of the additional symmetry but that the band does not
remain perfectly flat. The broadening of the band strongly depends on the
deviation of the spin-orbit-coupling vector from its unperturbed direction as
well as on the spin-orbit-coupling strength and the triplet-pairing amplitude.

One of the key hallmarks of dense active matter in the liquid, supercooled,
and solid phases is so-called equal-time velocity correlations. Crucially,
these correlations can emerge spontaneously, i.e., they require no explicit
alignment interactions, and therefore represent a generic feature of dense
active matter. This indicates that for a meaningful comparison or possible
mapping between active and passive liquids one not only needs to understand
their structural properties, but also the impact of these velocity
correlations. This has already prompted several simulation and theoretical
studies, though they are mostly focused on athermal systems and thus overlook
the effect of translational diffusion. Here we present a fully microscopic
method to calculate nonequilibrium correlations in systems of thermal active
Brownian particles (ABPs). We use the integration through transients (ITT)
formalism together with (active) mode-coupling theory (MCT) and analytically
calculate qualitatively consistent static structure factors and active velocity
correlations. We complement our theoretical results with simulations of both
thermal and athermal ABPs which exemplify the disruptive role that thermal
noise has on velocity correlations.

Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) have gained significant popularity in
recent years due to their unique ability to provide a high surface area and
customizable pore geometry and chemistry. These traits make COFs a highly
promising choice for a range of applications. However, with their vast
potential structures, exploring COFs experimentally can be challenging and
time-consuming, yet it remains an attractive avenue for computational
high-throughput studies. However, generating COF structures can be a
time-consuming and challenging task. To address this challenge, here we
introduce the pyCOFBuilder, an open-source Python package designed to
facilitate the generation of COF structures for computational studies. The
pyCOFBuilder software provides an easy-to-use set of functionalities to

Topology is a fundamental aspect of quantum physics, and it has led to key
breakthroughs and results in various fields of quantum materials. In condensed
matters, this has culminated in the recent discovery of symmetry-protected
topological phases. However, symmetry-based topological characterizations rely
heavily on symmetry analysis and are incapable of detecting the topological
phases in systems where the symmetry is broken, thus missing a large portion of
interesting topological physics. Here, we propose a new approach to
understanding the topological nature of quantum materials, which we call
feature spectrum topology. In this framework, the ground-state is separated
into different partitions by the eigenspectrum of a feature, a particular
chosen internal quantum degree of freedom, such as spin or pseudo-spin, and the
topological properties are determined by analysis of these ground-state
partitions. We show that bulk-boundary correspondence guarantees gapless
spectral flows in either one of the energy or feature spectrum. Most
importantly, such 'feature-energy duality' of gapless spectral flows serves as
a fundamental manifestation of a topological phase, thereby paving a new way
towards topological characterizations beyond symmetry considerations. Our
development reveals the topological nature of a quantum ground state hidden
outside symmetry-based characterizations, hence, providing a platform for a
more refined search of unconventional topological materials.

Multiple exciton generation (MEG) is a widely studied phenomenon in
semiconductor nanocrystals and quantum dots, aimed at improving the energy
conversion efficiency of solar cells. MEG is the process wherein incident
photon energy is significantly larger than the band gap, and the resulting
photoexcited carriers relax by generating additional electron-hole pairs,
rather than decaying by heat dissipation. Here, we present an experimental
demonstration of MEG in a prototype strongly correlated material, VO2, through
photocurrent spectroscopy and ultrafast transient reflectivity measurements,
both of which are considered the most prominent ways for detecting MEG in
working devices. The key result of this paper is the observation of MEG at room
temperature (in a correlated insulating phase of VO2), and the estimated
threshold for MEG is 3Eg. We demonstrate an escalated photocurrent due to MEG
in VO2, and quantum efficiency is found to exceed 100%. Our studies suggest
that this phenomenon is a manifestation of expeditious impact ionization due to
stronger electron correlations and could be exploited in a large number of
strongly correlated materials.

We theoretically studied the exciton geometric structure in layered
semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides. Using the well-developed
three-orbital tight-binding models for the electron and hole constituents, an
effective exciton Hamiltonian can be constructed and solved perturbatively. We
show that the electron-hole Coulomb interaction gives rise to a non-trivial
inheritance of the exciton geometric structure from Bloch electrons, which
manifests as a center-of-mass anomalous Hall velocity of the exciton when two
external fields are applied on the electron and hole constituents,
respectively. The form of the center-of-mass anomalous velocity is obtained,
which is found to exhibit a non-trivial dependence on the fields as well as the
exciton wave function.

Mobility edge (ME), representing the critical energy that distinguishes
between extended and localized states, is a key concept in understanding the
transition between extended (metallic) and localized (insulating) states in
disordered and quasiperiodic systems. Here we explore the impact of dissipation
on a quasiperiodic system featuring MEs by calculating steady-state density
matrix and analyzing quench dynamics with sudden introduction of dissipation,
and demonstrate that dissipation can lead the system into specific states
predominantly characterized by either extended or localized states,
irrespective of the initial state. Our results establish the use of dissipation
as a new avenue for inducing transitions between extended and localized states,
and for manipulating dynamic behaviors of particles.

<br>
In the last years, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), especially at the
two-dimensional (2D) limit, gained a large interest due to their unique optical
and electronic properties. Among them, MoS2 received great attention from the
scientific community due to its versatility, workability, and applicability in
a large number of fields such as electronics, optoelectronics and
electrocatalysis. To open the possibility of 2D-MoS2 exploitation, its
synthesis over large macroscopic areas using cost-effective methods is
fundamental. In this study, we report a method for the synthesis of large-area
(~ cm2) few-layers MoS2 via liquid precursor CVD (L-CVD), where the Mo
precursor (i.e. ammonium heptamolybdate AHM) is provided via a solution that is
spin-coated over the substrate. Given the capability of organic and inorganic
molecules, such as alkaline salts, to enhance MoS2 growth, we investigated the
action of different inorganic salts as seed promoters. In particular, by using
visible Raman spectroscopy, we focused on the effect of Na(OH), KCl, KI, and
Li(OH) on the thickness, morphology, uniformity and degree of coverage of the
grown MoS2. We optimized the process tuning parameters such as the volume of
spin-coated solution, the growth temperature, and the seed promoter
concentration, to synthesise the lowest possible thickness which resulted to be
2 layers (2L) of the highest quality. We witnessed that the addition of an
inorganic seed promoter in the solution improves the extension of the grown
MoS2 promoting lateral growth front, and therefore the degree of coverage. From
this study, we conclude that, amongst the investigated seed promoters, K-based
salts proved to grant the growth of high-quality two-layer MoS2 with optimal
and uniform coverage of the SiO2/Si substrate surface.

We employ a mathematical model to analyze stress chains in thermoplastic
elastomers (TPEs) with a microphase-separated spherical structure composed of
triblock copolymers. The model represents stress chains during uniaxial and
biaxial extensions using networks of spherical domains connected by bridges. We
advance previous research and discuss permanent strain and other aspects of the
network. It explores the dependency of permanent strain on the extension
direction, using the average of tension tensors to represent isotropic material
behavior. The concept of deviation angle is introduced to measure network
anisotropy and is shown to play an essential role in predicting permanent
strain when a network is extended in a specific direction. The paper also
discusses methods to create a new network structure using various polymers.

<h3>Nonlinear Optical Effects Due to Magnetization Dynamics In a Ferromagnet</h3>

We theoretically consider magnetization dynamics in a ferromagnetic slab
induced by the magnetic field of a strong femtosecond laser pulse. The
longitudinal geometry, in which the initial magnetization lies in both the
plane of incidence and the sample plane, is studied. The magnetization
oscillations at the optical wave frequency are calculated with the use of the
Kapitza pendulum approach taking into account that the optical frequency is
much greater than the magnetization oscillation eigenfrequency. We study the
reflection of the electromagnetic wave from a ferromagnet %with such a dynamics
and show that this laser-induced low-frequency magnetization dynamics leads to
the appearance of the second-order nonlinearity in the Maxwell's equations,
which in turn gives rise to both the second harmonic generation (SHG) and
rectification effect. Although the amplitude of the magnetization oscillations
is small, the considered effect may be responsible for the SHG with the
efficiency comparable to that of nonmagnetic SHG from metal surfaces. Our
estimations show that the suggested mechanism may explain the recent
experiments on magnetization induced modulation of the SHG intensity in a
``forbidden'' $P_{in}P_{out}$ combination of incident and reflected waves in
cobalt/heavy metal systems, where it can be even more pronounced due to the
spin current flow through the ferromagnet/ heavy metal interface.

<h3>Robustness of stress focusing in soft lattices under topology-switching  deformation</h3>

Recent developments in topological mechanics have demonstrated the ability of
Maxwell lattices to effectively focus stress along domain walls between
differently polarized domains. The focusing ability can be exploited to protect
the lattice bulk from accidental stress concentration -- and eventually onset
and propagation of fracture -- at structural hot spots such as defects and
cracks. A recent study has revisited the problem for structural lattices
featuring non-ideal hinges, showing that the focusing remains robust, albeit
diluted in strength. Realizing that the problem of domain wall localization has
been traditionally framed in the context of linear elasticity, in this work we
extend the study to the realm of soft structures undergoing nonlinear finite
deformation. Through experiments performed on silicone hyperelastic prototypes,
we assess and quantify the robustness of the phenomenon against the macroscopic
shape changes induced by large deformation, with special attention to
deformation levels that alter the topology of the bulk, lifting the topological
protection. Furthermore, we identify a simple geometric indicator for this
transition.

Liquid Crystalline Elastomers (LCEs) are active materials that are of
interest due to their programmable response to various external stimuli such as
light and heat. When exposed to these stimuli, the anisotropy in the response
of the material is governed by the nematic director, which is a continuum
parameter that is defined as the average local orientation of the mesogens in
the liquid crystal phase. This nematic director can be programmed to be
heterogeneous in space, creating a vast design space that is useful for
applications ranging from artificial ligaments to deployable structures to
self-assembling mechanisms. Even when specialized to long and thin strips of
LCEs -- the focus of this work -- the vast design space has required the use of
numerical simulations to aid in experimental discovery. To mitigate the
computational expense of full 3-d numerical simulations, several
dimensionally-reduced rod and ribbon models have been developed for LCE strips,
but these have not accounted for the possibility of initial transverse
curvature, like carpenter's tape spring. Motivated by recent experiments
showing that transversely-curved LCE strips display a rich variety of
configurations, this work derives a dimensionally-reduced 1-d model for
pre-curved LCE strips. The 1-d model is validated against full 3-d finite
element calculations, and it is also shown to capture experimental
observations, including tape-spring-like localizations, in activated LCE
strips.

<h3>Drift velocity of edge magnetoplasmons due to magnetic edge channels</h3>

Edge magnetoplasmons arise on a boundary of conducting layer in perpendicular
magnetic field due to an interplay of electron cyclotron motion and Coulomb
repulsion. Lateral electric field, which confines electrons inside the sample,
drives their spiraling motion in magnetic field along the edge with the average
drift velocity contributing to the total magnetoplasmon velocity. We revisit
this classical picture by developing fully quantum theory of drift velocity
starting from analysis of magnetic edge channels and their electrodynamic
response. We derive the quantum-mechanical expression for the drift velocity,
which arises in our theory as a characteristic of such response. Using the
Wiener-Hopf method to solve analytically the edge mode electrodynamic problem,
we demonstrate that the edge channel response effectively enhances the bulk
Hall response of the conducting layer and thus increases the edge
magnetoplasmon velocity. In the quasiclassical long-wavelength limit of our
model, the drift velocity is simply added to the total magnetoplasmon velocity,
in agreement with the classical picture.

The crystallization of complex, concentrated alloys can result in
atomic-level short-range order, composition gradients, and phase separation.
These features govern the properties of the resulting alloy. While nucleation
and growth in single-element metals are well understood, several open questions
remain regarding the crystallization of multi-principal component alloys. We
use MD to model the crystallization of a five-element, equiatomic alloy modeled
after CoCrCuFeNi upon cooling from the melt. Stochastic, homogeneous nucleation
results in nuclei with a biased composition distribution, rich in Fe and Co.
This deviation from the random sampling of the overall composition is driven by
the internal energy and affects nuclei of a wide range of sizes, from tens of
atoms all the way to super-critical sizes. This results in short range order
and compositional gradients at nanometer scales.

Frustration in magnetic materials arising from competing exchange
interactions can prevent the system from adopting long-range magnetic order and
can instead lead to a diverse range of novel quantum and topological states
with exotic quasiparticle excitations. Here, we review prominent examples of
such emergent phenomena, including magnetically-disordered and extensively
degenerate spin ices, which feature emergent magnetic monopole excitations,
highly-entangled quantum spin liquids with fractional spinon excitations,
topological order and emergent gauge fields, as well as complex particle-like
topological spin textures known as skyrmions. We provide an overview of recent
advances in the search for magnetically-disordered candidate materials on the
three-dimensional pyrochlore lattice and two-dimensional triangular, kagome and
honeycomb lattices, the latter with bond-dependent Kitaev interactions, and on
lattices supporting topological magnetism. We highlight experimental signatures
of these often elusive phenomena and single out the most suitable experimental
techniques that can be used to detect them. Our review also aims at providing a
comprehensive guide for designing and investigating novel frustrated magnetic
materials, with the potential of addressing some important open questions in
contemporary condensed matter physics.

The area-normalized change of mass ($\Delta$m/A) with time during the
oxidation of metallic alloys is commonly used to assess oxidation resistance.
Analyses of such data can also aid in evaluating underlying oxidation
mechanisms. We performed an exhaustive literature search and digitized
normalized mass change vs. time data for 407 alloys. To maximize the impact of
these and future mass uptake data, we developed and published an open, online,
computational workflow that fits the data to various models of oxidation
kinetics, uses Bayesian statistics for model selection, and makes the raw data
and model parameters available via a queryable database. The tool, Refractory
Oxidation Database (https://nanohub.org/tools/refoxdb/), uses nanoHUB's Sim2Ls
to make the workflow and data (including metadata) findable, accessible,
interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). We find that the models selected by the
original authors do not match the most likely one according to the Bayesian
information criterion (BIC) in 71% of the cases. Further, in 56% of the cases,
the published model was not even in the top 3 models according to the BIC.
These numbers were obtained assuming an experimental noise of 2.5% of the mass
gain range, a smaller noise leads to more discrepancies. The RefOxDB tool is
open access and researchers can add their own raw data (those to be included in
future publications, as well as negative results) for analysis and to share
their work with the community. Such consistent and systematic analysis of open,
community generated data can significantly accelerate the development of
machine-learning models for oxidation behavior and assist in the understanding
and improvement of oxidation resistance.

The nonequilibrium dynamics of a periodically driven extended XY model, in
the presence of linear time dependent magnetic filed, is investigated using the
notion of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs). Along the similar lines
to the equilibrium phase transition, the main purpose of this work is to search
the fundamental concepts such as scaling and universality at the ramped quench
DQPTs. We have shown that the critical points of the model, where the gap
closing occurs, can be moved by tuning the driven frequency and consequently
the presence/absence of DQPTs can be flexibly controlled by adjusting the
driven frequency. %Taking advantage of this property, We have uncovered that,
for a ramp across the single quantum critical point, the critical mode at which
DQPTs occur is classified into three regions: the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) region,
where the critical mode scales linearly with the square root of the sweep
velocity, pre-saturated (PS) region, and the saturated (S) region where the
critical mode makes a plateau versus the sweep velocity. While for a ramp that
crosses two critical points, the critical modes disclose just KZ and PS
regions. On the basis of numerical simulations, we find that the dynamical free
energy scales linerly with time, as approaches to DQPT time, with the exponent
$\nu=1\pm 0.01$ for all sweep velocities and driven frequencies.

Topological bandstructures interfering with moir\'e superstructures give rise
to a plethora of emergent phenomena, which are pivotal for correlated
insulating and superconducting states of twisttronics materials. While
quasiperiodicity was up to now a notion mostly reserved for solid-state
materials and cold atoms, we here demonstrate the capacity of conventional
superconducting circuits to emulate moir\'e physics in charge space. With two
examples, we show that Hofstadter's butterfly and the magic-angle effect, are
directly visible in spectroscopic transport measurements. Importantly, these
features survive in the presence of harmonic trapping potentials due to
parasitic linear capacitances. Our proposed platform benefits from
unprecedented tuning capabilities, and opens the door to probe incommensurate
physics in virtually any spatial dimension.

Uranium-based materials are valuable assets in the energy, medical, and
military industries. However, understanding their sensitivity to hydrogen
embrittlement is particularly challenging due to the toxicity of uranium and
computationally expensive nature of the quantum-based methods generally
required to study such processes. In this regard, we have developed a Chebyshev
Interaction Model for Efficient Simulation (ChIMES) model that can be employed
to compute energies and forces of U and UH3 bulk structures with vacancies and
hydrogen interstitials with similar accuracy to Density Functional Theory (DFT)
while yielding linear scaling and orders of magnitude improvement in
computational efficiency. We show that that the bulk structural parameters,
uranium and hydrogen vacancy formation energies, and diffusion barriers
predicted by the ChIMES potential are in strong agreement with the reference
DFT data. We then use ChIMES to conduct molecular dynamics simulations of the
temperature-dependent diffusion of a hydrogen interstitial and determine the
corresponding diffusion activation energy. Our model has particular
significance in studies of actinides and other high-Z materials, where there is
a strong need for computationally efficient methods to bridge length and time
scales between experiments and quantum theory.

Cadmium sulfide (CdS) pigments have degraded in several well-known paintings,
but the mechanisms of degradation have yet to be fully understood. Traditional
non-destructive analysis techniques primarily focus on macroscopic degradation,
whereas microscopic information is typically obtained with invasive techniques
that require sample removal. Here, we demonstrate the use of pump-probe
microscopy to nondestructively visualize the three-dimensional structure and
degradation progress of CdS pigments in oil paints. CdS pigments, reproduced
following historical synthesis methods, were artificially aged by exposure to
high relative humidity (RH) and ultraviolet (UV) light. Pump-probe microscopy
was applied to track the degradation progress in single grains, and volumetric
imaging revealed early CdS degradation of small particles and on the surface of
large particles. This indicates that the particle dimension influences the
extent and evolution of degradation of historical CdS. In addition, the
pump-probe signal decrease in degraded CdS is observable before visible changes
to the eye, demonstrating that pump-probe microscopy is a promising tool to
detect early-stage degradation in artworks. The observed degradation by
pump-probe microscopy occurred through the conversion from CdS into CdSO4.xH2O,
verified by both FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared) and XPS (X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy) experiment.

Surrogate models driven by sizeable datasets and scientific machine-learning
methods have emerged as an attractive microstructure simulation tool with the
potential to deliver predictive microstructure evolution dynamics with huge
savings in computational costs. Taking 2D and 3D grain growth simulations as an
example, we present a completely overhauled computational framework based on
graph neural networks with not only excellent agreement to both the ground
truth phase-field methods and theoretical predictions, but enhanced accuracy
and efficiency compared to previous works based on convolutional neural
networks. These improvements can be attributed to the graph representation,
both improved predictive power and a more flexible data structure amenable to
adaptive mesh refinement. As the simulated microstructures coarsen, our method
can adaptively adopt remeshed grids and larger timesteps to achieve further
speedup. The data-to-model pipeline with training procedures together with the

We study double quantum dots coupled to a quasistatic cavity mode with high
mode-volume compression allowing for strong light-matter coupling. Besides the
cavity-mediated interaction, electrons in different double quantum dots
interact with each other via dipole-dipole (Coulomb) interaction. For
attractive dipolar interaction, a cavity-induced ferroelectric quantum phase
transition emerges leading to ordered dipole moments. Surprisingly, we find
that the phase transition can be either continuous or discontinuous, depending
on the ratio between the strengths of cavity-mediated and Coulomb interactions.
We show that, in the strong coupling regime, both the ground and the first
excited states of an array of double quantum dots are squeezed Schr\"{o}dinger
cat states. Such states are actively discussed as high-fidelity qubits for
quantum computing, and thus our proposal provides a platform for semiconductor
implementation of such qubits. We also calculate gauge-invariant observables
such as the net dipole moment, the optical conductivity, and the absorption
spectrum beyond the semiclassical approximation.
